    , Accepted 8th January 2016First published on 11th January 2016AbstractHere we report the synthesis of a pair of D1–A-bridge–D2-bridge–A–D1 type small molecules BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT which have different π-conjugated bridges between indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the electron-donating core and the electron-deficient difluorobenzothiadiazole unit and investigated the effects of the π-conjugated bridges on their photovoltaic properties. We found that the molecule BIT4FTT, containing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene which has two fused thiophene rings as the π-conjugated bridges, exhibits different photophysical properties, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, charge carrier mobilities and morphologies of blend films, and photovoltaic properties compared with the analogous system BIT4FDT which has 2,2′-bithiophene rings as the conjugated bridges. Moreover, the devices based on the two molecules after CH2Cl2 solvent annealing exhibited superior device performance to those not subjected to CH2Cl2 solvent annealing. The PCE of BHJ-OSC devices based on BIT4FTT and PC71BM increased from 5.85% to 7.57% (Jsc = 11.33 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V, and FF = 0.75) after exposure to CH2Cl2 vapor due to the obvious increase of both Jsc and FF. Interestingly, the devices based on BIT4FDT and PC71BM showed a weaker response to solvent vapor annealing and much lower PCEs in comparison with those based on BIT4FTT. The results indicate that highly efficient small-molecule solar cells can be achieved using fused aromatic bridges and a suitable solvent vapor annealing process.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) are considered to be one of the most promising candidates for the next generation energy sources because of their advantages such as light weight, flexibility, and low cost in recent years.1 Over the past few years, extensive research efforts and significant progress have been made in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) based on donor/acceptor materials.2 Recently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been achieved for single-junction solar cells based on π-conjugated polymer/fullerene derivatives.3 However, some intrinsic disadvantages of polymers, such as less reproducibility, complex purification, and the undefined relationship between the structure and performance of final active materials, are still big challenges for further enhancement of device performance. Compared to polymers, small-molecules possess unique features of easy purification and well-defined discrete structures, which can ensure greater reproducibility in the device performance.4 Furthermore, small molecules could be viewed as model materials to simulate the backbone of high performance polymers, which is beneficial to investigate the structure–property–device performance relationship and disclose the key to the design of high performance photovoltaic materials. So far, significant progress has been made in solution processed small-molecule organic solar cells and a notable PCE of over 9% has been achieved, which is approaching the best-performance of polymer solar cells.5 Most of the high PCEs of small-molecule organic solar cells are based on benzodithiophene (BDT) core units,6 dithienosilole (DTS) core units,7 porphyrin core units, and rhodanine derivative terminal groups.8 Using other building blocks, only moderate PCEs were obtained due to poor film quality and low fill factors. Obviously, it is very important and challenging to develop highly efficient novel conjugated small-molecule donor materials based on a next-generation core blocking unit with better film quality and high fill factor.
Recently, ladder-type indacenodithiophene (IDT) donor cores have been applied as small-molecule donors for BHJ-OSCs. However, most of these materials have exhibited relatively lower fill factors due to the inferior intermolecular interaction and poor active layer morphology of these materials.9 Meanwhile, incorporation of fluorine atoms into conjugated materials has become a popular strategy to improve the PCE relative to their fluorine-free analogues, which facilitated the increase of open circuit voltage and formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds enhancing the intermolecular interaction.10 In combination with the “fluorine (F) effect”, we just reported BIT-4F-T, a linear small molecule containing thiophene functionalized IDT as the central donor unit, with two difluorobenzothiadiazole units as the acceptors, which achieved excellent BHJ-OSC performance with a high FF.11 These encouraging results indicated that difluorobenzothiadiazole/IDT-based small molecules become another novel family of high-efficiency, solution-processed, small-molecule donor materials. Thus, designing new materials by incorporating and/or modifying IDT units might result in further advancement of small-molecule solar cells.
Meanwhile, it has been reported that the conjugation length and conjugation pattern of bridges between the electron-donating group and electron-withdrawing wing group have a significant impact on the photophysical properties, molecular packing, and charge carrier mobility of conjugated polymers and device performance.12 For example, incorporation of the fused ring thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene unit into conjugated polymers always enhances the π-electron delocalization and intermolecular interaction as well as reduces the energy bandgap in comparison with that of using the linear 2,2′-bithiophene unit.13 Moreover, incorporation of a thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene group functionalized difluorobenzothiadiazole unit into small molecule solar cell materials is really rare. Therefore, how the conjugation length and conjugation pattern of bridges of the small molecules affect their photophysical properties and device performance, particularly before/after solvent vapour annealing or other post-treatments, needs to be comprehensively investigated.
To address this challenge, in this work, two linear D1–A-bridge–D2-bridge–A–D1 tetrafluorine substituted very similar small-molecules, namely BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT (Chart 1) with the same electron-rich core (IDT as D1), and electron-deficient unit (two difluorobenzothiadiazoles as A) and end groups (two n-dodecyl-substituted bithiophenes) but different π-conjugated bridges (2,2′-bithiophenes, thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene) between the A unit and D1 unit, were designed and synthesized. Although these two compounds have a similar backbone, we are wondering about the impact of the fusion or single bond connection of two thiophene in backbone structures. Therefore, we focused on whether the different molecular rigidity and planarity of bithiophene and thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene as the bridges could affect the light-harvesting ability of the whole molecule, and the HOMO/LUMO energy level, charge carrier mobility and the morphologies of blend films, and their photovoltaic properties when used as electron donor materials in photoactive layers. These two materials both exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as CHCl3, THF, toluene, and chlorobenzene owing to the multiple alkyl chains on IDT units and terminal thiophene groups and can be readily solution-processed and form excellent smooth films by spin-coating. In combination with using PC71BM as the acceptor, the BHJ-OSC devices based on BIT4FTT with a more rigid and planar π-conjugated backbone exhibited a better PCE of 7.57% with a very-high FF of 0.75 for the device upon annealing with CH2Cl2 vapor for 30 s without using any additives, while the devices based on BIT4FDT and PC71BM give much lower PCEs in comparison with those based on BIT4FTT and PC71BM. Moreover, these results provide a systematic investigation to understand the influence of the bridge unit in a series of conjugated D1–A-bridge–D2-bridge–A–D1 small molecules by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, solvent vapor annealing processes, device stability in air, and transient photovoltage and photocurrent experiments and further correlate with the solar cell performances in this paper.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes to these small molecules are shown in Scheme 1. 2 was obtained by a Stille coupling reaction between 1 (ref. 11) and 2-tributyltinthiophene in 90% isolated yield. Treatment of 2 with LDA followed by trimethyltin chloride and recrystallization from methanol/chloroform affords the target product 3 as a red solid. Treatment of 4 (ref: 14) with N-iodobutanimide in the solvent mixtures of chloroform and AcOH gives dibromide 5 in high isolated yield. BIT4FDT with bithiopene as the bridge was obtained through a two-fold Stille coupling reaction between 3 and 5 in 61% isolated yield. 7 was prepared by a Stille coupling reaction between 6 (ref. 15) and 2-tributyltinthieno[3,2-b]-thiophene in 83% isolated yield, which was then converted to the corresponding ditin 8 using n-BuLi and trimethyltin chloride. Finally, a Stille coupling reaction was carried out between 1 and 8 to give BIT4FTT in 71% isolated yield. All compounds were purified by silica gel column chromatography, and their structures and purity were fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and ESI/MALDI-TOF MS. The thermal properties of two small molecules were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 1). Under a N2 atmosphere, the onset temperature with 5% weight-loss was about 416 °C for BIT4FDT and 407 °C for BIT4FTT, respectively, which indicated that the thermal stability of these small-molecules are stable enough for the studies of organic solar cells. Meanwhile, solid state thermal transitions were evaluated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under N2 in a heating/cooling cycle (Fig. S1†). During the heating process, the two molecules exhibit clear melting temperatures (Tm), BIT4FTT exhibited obviously higher melting points (about 255 °C), which indicated that it has stronger intermolecular interactions than BIT4FDT.

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of two small-molecules both in diluted chloroform solutions and in thin films, the two molecules showed two distinct absorption bands (band I: 300–500 nm; band II: 500–800 nm) in solution and the solid state due to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the molecular donor and acceptor units. In solution, the small-molecule BIT4FDT shows an absorption peak at 470 nm and another more obvious absorption peak at 548 nm. The absorption peak of BIT4FTT based on thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (TT) as the bridge was located at about 567 nm and red-shifted about 19 nm in comparison with BIT4FDT, which might be attributed to the increase of molecular electron-donating ability and planarity from 2,2′-bithiophenes to thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene. Consequently, there should have been more intense intermolecular π–π stacking interactions in BIT4FTT than BIT4FDT. The absorption spectra of the two molecules in films are red-shifted and broader compared with their absorption spectra in solution. For example, compared with those absorption maximum peaks in solutions, BIT4FTT showed a red-shift of 41 nm, while the λmax peak of BIT4FDT red-shifted only 12 nm in the band II region with a concomitant less intense peak at higher wavelengths in the solid state. The absorption spectra of BIT4FTT obviously increased the relative intensity of their 0–0 vibrational peak, which became the maximum absorption peak. These results are probably due to the bigger conformational change, more efficient interchain interaction, and higher π-electron delocalization of BIT4FTT than those of BIT4FDT in the solid states, which could be beneficial to a higher hole mobility and solar energy harvesting. From the onset of absorption in thin films, the optical band gaps of solid states were estimated to be 1.84 eV for BIT4FDT and 1.83 eV for BIT4FTT, respectively, as listed in Table 1.

In order to investigate the relationship between the chemical structures and the electrochemical properties of the desired materials, the electrochemical properties of two small-molecules in thin films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. S3† and Table 1, the CV curves of two materials both showed quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves. All potentials were recorded versus the Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M in anhydrous acetonitrile) reference electrode and calibrated with the redox couple of Fc/Fc+ under the same experimental conditions. The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO are calculated according to the following equation of EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.80) (eV). As shown in Table 1, the HOMO levels of BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT both are located around −5.30 eV. While the LUMO energy levels of BIT4FTT are slightly deeper relative to those of BIT4FDT, which is expected to gain a high Jsc of the resultant organic solar cells based on BIT4FTT. The electrochemical band gaps (Eg(cv)) albeit slightly larger than the corresponding optical band gaps (Eg(opt)) because states measured in the electrochemical experiments (free ions) and those of the optical results (neutral states) are somewhat different.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis sets to better understand the electronic structure geometry of BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT.16 As shown in Fig. 3, different π bridges between donor units and acceptor units can affect the molecular conformation. Due to the centrosymmetry of bithiophene and thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene bridges and the analysis of potential energy versus the torsional degree (see Fig. S4 and S5†), both BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT adapt the zigzag conformation as the lowest energy molecular conformation. While in the case of BIT4FDT, the dihedrals of the bithiophene bridge as well as between the bridge and IDT are ca. 2.7° and 11.8°, which are obviously larger than those in the case of BIT4FTT. Such non-coplanar features would lead to less effective stacking of BIT4FDT in the solid state. As shown in Table S2,† the computational results showed that for BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT the HOMO/LUMO energy levels were −4.68/−2.82, and −4.68/−2.83, respectively. The LUMO energy levels of BIT4FTT are deeper relative to those of BIT4FDT, which is consistent with the trend of electrochemical bandgaps.

To evaluate the potential of these small-molecules as promising electron donor materials in organic solar cells and understand the structure–property–performance relationship, we fabricated BHJ-OSCs with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/small-molecule:PC71BM (90–100 nm)/PFN (5 nm)/Al (80 nm). The active layer was spin-coated from the blend solution at 50 °C to obtain high quality films. As an effective method for the enhancement of PCE, solvent vapor annealing has been used in small molecule BHJ-OSCs to optimize the morphology of the active layer.17 We further optimized the device performance of our small-molecules by using CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s without any additive. Table 2 summarizes the device performance of the two materials before and after solvent vapor annealing, such as Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of the devices under 1 sun illumination.

The characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of these optimal devices are shown in Fig. 4. As expected, all of the devices based on our small-molecules and PC71BM without solvent vapor treatment exhibited high Voc values due to the relatively lower-lying HOMO energy levels of donor materials, which were about 0.90 V and 0.93 V for BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT, respectively, which is associated with the wide bandgap characteristics. Moreover Voc slightly decreased after solvent vapor annealing, which will be discussed later. Before solvent vapor annealing, the highest PCEs of BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT were about 5.17% and 5.85% with PC71BM in 1:3 ratios. There was no big difference between these two materials. While the overall performance of the devices from all of the donor materials was enhanced when CH2Cl2 vapor annealing treatment (30 s) was applied to the active layer, without the need for the incorporation of an additive. The best performance device based on BIT4FTT:PC71BM presents the highest PCE of 7.57%, with a Jsc of 11.33 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V, and a high FF of 0.75. It exhibits a large enhancement of PCE in comparison with its initial performance before CH2Cl2 vapor annealing, while the PCE of the device based on BIT4FDT:PC71BM was enhanced to some extent (5.17% vs. 5.71%) after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s due to a large enhancement of FF with a slight sacrifice of the Jsc. As shown in Fig. 4, all of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra covered a broad wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm for all the devices based on BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT. For BIT4FTT, the conversion of photons to electrons is significantly improved from 400 nm to 650 nm after exposure to CH2Cl2 vapor, which is consistent with the increase in Jsc, while the intensity of EQE spectra was obviously decreased in the entire photoactive region for BIT4FDT under CH2Cl2 vapor annealing which leads to a decrease of Jsc. We also further examined the effect of other organic vapors (such as chloroform or THF) on solar cell performances. However, neither chloroform nor THF vapor annealing processes can result in an enhanced PCE due to the significant decrease of Jsc and Voc (see Table S2†) when compared to dichloromethane vapor annealing. For example, PCEs of devices from the BIT4FTT/PC71BM blend after THF vapor annealing and after CHCl3 vapor annealing were ∼5.07% and ∼4.05%, respectively. All the integrated current densities from the EQE curve agree well with the Jsc value from J–V curves.

To determine the origin of the observed photovoltaic performance differences between BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT as well as the effect of solvent vapor annealing on the active layer, we carried out more detailed investigations on the absorption properties and morphology of blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM), their charge mobility by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method, device stability in air, and transient photovoltage and photocurrent experiments to draw structure–property relationships.
The origin of the obviously increased Jsc after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for BIT4FTT was first investigated by the blend absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. 4, compared to the absorption spectra of the as-cast film, the spectra of the film with solvent vapor annealing showed enhanced absorption in the 350–800 nm region, especially in the range between 500 and 700 nm. These more well-defined features across the entire visible spectrum and formation of a new vibronic shoulder at ca. 620 nm can be attributed to the reorganization of BIT4FTT in the blend, as a result of a more ordered morphology, an increase in molecular interaction and an enhancement in the absorption cross-section of the films. In contrast, the blends of BIT4FDT have relatively weaker influence, as indicated by the slight increase in intensity and absence of the obvious shoulder peak (see Fig. S6†). Therefore, the contribution from the increase of molecular interaction can be neglected, and it is not strange to see a decrease in Jsc after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing. Moreover, such results are consistent with the trend of EQE results of devices and will be discussed in detail from the view of film morphology later.
Given the important role of film morphology of the active layer in determining the device performance of OSCs, we carried out a tapping mode AFM study to reveal the morphology change upon the solvent annealing. The samples were prepared by spin-coating the donor:PC71BM blend on ITO/PEDOT:PSS in the same way as the photoactive layers for the solar cell devices. As shown in Fig. 5, without vapor annealing, the blend films based on BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT with PC71BM were very smooth surface and uniform morphology with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness 1.2 nm for BIT4FDT and 0.5 nm for BIT4FTT respectively, indicating all of the donor materials have a good miscibility with PC71BM. After CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s, the surfaces of the films based on BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT/PC71BM become slightly rougher with a RMS roughness of 1.6 nm and 0.9 nm in the same sequence as well as showed more phase-separated and slightly bigger domain size. Such features are in good agreement with the change of the blend films with/without solvent vapor annealing in the previous literature. We anticipated that CH2Cl2 vapor annealing can form a good interpenetrating network with a much rougher surface, which is consistent with features of the absorption of the blend films upon CH2Cl2 vapor annealing. It can really increase in the domain and the more ordered film morphology of the active layer in nanoscale through the solvent vapor annealing, and thus preferable to improve charge transport properties.

Fig. 6 shows the high-resolution TEM images of the blend films before and after the postsolvent vapor annealing. Both the as-cast films were homogeneous with inconspicuous phase-separated features. In contrast, after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing, the remarkable features of phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating network could be clearly observed for both the blend films. For example, phase-separated morphology with ca. 15–20 nm domain size for BIT4FTT/PC71BM can be seen, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation at the D/A interface and charge transport along the interpenetrating network, and thus is responsible for the increased Jsc and FF. On the other side, a larger domain size (ca. 25–30 nm) was found in the BIT4FDT/PC71BM film, which is away from the desired domain size for efficient diffusion. Nevertheless, the BIT4FDT/PC71BM device after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing shows a significant increase in FF, indicating the existence of a bicontinuous interpenetrating network, which is also very important for a high performance of OPV devices.

The crystalline structures of BIT4FTT/PC71BM blend films before/after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. S7,† the as-cast blend films exhibited poor crystallinity with a weak (100) diffraction peak at about 4.5° and a π–π stacking direction diffraction peak at about 22.5°. After the blend film was treated by CH2Cl2 vapor annealing, both diffraction peaks were obviously enhanced, which indicated that the solvent vapor annealing treatment effectively promoted the improvement of the order and crystallinity in the blend film.
To verify the positive effect of CH2Cl2 vapor annealing on charge transport and disclose its dependence on the structure of these two molecules, we compared the hole and electron mobility in the actual device before and after this treatment using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The structures of hole only and electron only devices are ITO/PEDOT/small-molecules:PC71BM/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/PFN/small-molecules:PC71BM/Ca/Al, respectively. Table 2 displays the hole and electron mobilities deduced from the SCLC method and Fig. S7 and 8† display the J–V characteristics of the hole-only and electron-only devices as obtained in the dark. As expected, the devices based on BIT4FDT have lower hole mobilities (1.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) before/after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing due to the worst effective π–π stacking by having the largest dihedrals in the structure as mentioned before. Moreover, the hole mobility for devices fabricated from two small-molecule materials was enhanced about one order of magnitude after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing. For example, the hole mobility for the original device fabricated from BIT4FTT is 3.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, while it was enhanced to 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after treatment with CH2Cl2 vapor for 30 s. Meanwhile, the electron mobility (μe) of the original device fabricated from small-molecule/PC71BM just increased slightly or unchanged. As a result, the imbalance of the hole and electron transport properties was dramatically improved after solvent vapor annealing. For BIT4FTT/PC71BM, the μe/μh ratios dropped from 7.0 to 1.0; meanwhile, for BIT4FDT/PC71BM it dropped from 14 to 3.3 before and after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s. Therefore, during the CH2Cl2 vapor annealing process, the much enhanced μh together with considerably balanced hole and electron mobility of the device could result in a much higher charge-carrier extraction efficiency, which should account for their high FF. Actually, compared with the moderate FF (ca. 0.55) of small-molecule-based regular devices, all of the devices after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s showed very high FFs (0.70–0.75), particularly for BIT4FTT based devices, even up to 0.75, which should be associated with the best balanced charge carrier mobility and less charge recombination loss therein.18
To further examine the origin of the improved device performances by CH2Cl2 vapor annealing, we carried out transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) experiments to investigate the charge decay dynamics and determine the charge density in the devices based on BIT4FDT or BIT4FTT blend with PC71BM with/without the CH2Cl2 vapor annealing under a given steady-state illumination.19 For the TPV measurements, the perturbation from a pulsed laser was attenuated by a set of neutral density filters so that the amplitude of TPV was much smaller as compared to Voc. Since there was no charge collected under open-voltage conditions, the excess charge carriers that excited by the pulsed laser were recombined inside the device. Therefore, the lifetime of the charge carriers could be extracted from the exponential fitting on the decay of the transient photovoltage. As shown in Fig. 7 and S9,† the extracted charge carrier lifetimes (s) for the two material-based devices before CH2Cl2 vapor annealing are similar (ca. 0.7 μs). However, after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing, the extracted charge carrier lifetime for the BIT4FDT-based device was slightly increased to 1.5 μs, suggesting a reduced bimolecular recombination loss upon vapour annealing. For the BIT4FTT-based device, the extracted charge carrier lifetime was unchanged. In conjunction with the slightly increased or unchanged extracted charge carrier lifetime and the obviously increased hole mobility after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing, the exciton diffusion length at the D/A interface after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing is remarkably longer than that of the device without CH2Cl2 vapor annealing, which is responsible for the significant improvement in charge transport and FF after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing. Meanwhile, as revealed by the TPC measurements, upon CH2Cl2 vapor annealing, the charge carrier density slightly decreases in the BIT4FDT device while it increases in the BIT4FTT devices, which are in good agreement with the change of Jsc after vapor annealing (Table 2). In order to test the possibility of practical applications, a device shelf lifetime (storage stability) test was carried out in air environment after simple encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 8, all of the devices retained over 85% of their initial PCE after about 150 h, which was obtained by counting the results from 8 individual cells of each type of small molecule and treatment conditions. Moreover, the BIT4FTT-based devices showed obviously better stability than the BIT4FDT-based devices. We believed that better device stability and lifetime could be achieved through an improved device architecture or proper encapsulation.

Conclusions
In this study, we have designed and synthesized two linear tetrafluorine substituted small-molecules with the same IDT core, the same electron-deficient difluorobenzothiadiazole unit, and the same end groups but different conjugated patterns of bridge (single bond connection or fusion of two thiophene rings) for application in solution-processable organic solar cells. Although BIT4FDT and BIT4FTT have a similar backbone, BIT4FTT containing thieno[3,2-b] thiophene as the π-conjugated bridges exhibits different photophysical properties, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, charge carrier mobilities and morphologies of blend films, and photovoltaic properties in comparison with the analogous system BIT4FDT with 2,2′-bithiophene rings as the conjugated bridges. The BHJ-OSC devices based on BIT4FTT and PC71BM show a significant improvement of performance and exhibit the best PCE of ca. 7.6% with a very-high FF of 0.75 upon annealing with CH2Cl2 for 30 s. These results indicated that CH2Cl2 vapor annealing is more effective for small molecules with fused π-bridges, which easily enhances the intermolecular interactions and the balance of charge carrier mobility and PCE. Throughout this study, it proves to be a valid strategy to combine the rational molecular design through fused π-bridges and device optimization to strike a suitable balance to achieve highly efficient organic photovoltaic devices.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization
All air and water sensitive reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. The other materials were of the common commercial level and used as received. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-400 (400 MHz) or ARX-500 (500 MHz) spectrometer, using CDCl3, except where noted. All chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm). 1H NMR chemical shifts were referenced to TMS (0 ppm), and 13C NMR chemical shifts were referenced to CDCl3 (77.23 ppm). MALDI-TOF-MS was recorded on a Bruker BIFLEX III mass spectrometer. Thermal gravity analyses (TGA) were carried out on a TA Instrument Q600 analyzer. Elemental analyses were performed using a German Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV-vis spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a BASI Epsilon workstation. A glassy carbon electrode was used as a working electrode and a platinum wire as a counter electrode; the films were drop-cast on a glass carbon working electrode from THF solutions. Measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in CH3CN containing 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. All potentials were calibrated with the redox couple of Fc/Fc+ under the same experimental conditions. The film morphology was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco MultiMode V) operating in tapping mode.
BHJ-OSC fabrication
Device preparation and characterization were carried out under clean room conditions with protection against dust and moisture. The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small-molecule:PC71BM/PFN/Al; a 40 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer was spin-cast on the ITO substrate and then dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight. The small-molecule:PC71BM active layer was prepared by spin-coating their mixture of chloroform and chlorobenzene solution with various weight ratios and then were placed in a glass Petri dish containing 1 mL CH2Cl2 for 30 s for solvent vapor annealing. A 5 nm PFN layer was then spin-coated from methanol solution in the presence of a trace amount of acetic acid onto the active layer. Subsequently, the films were transferred into a vacuum evaporator and 80 nm of Al was deposited as the cathode. The active area of OPV devices is 0.16 cm2 (∼2 × 8 mm2, as defined by a shadow mask).
