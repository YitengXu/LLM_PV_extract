However, it requires a high energy input to break the strong CO bond of CO2 molecules. Solar energy is a sustainable and green energy without environmental detriment. The utilization of solar energy especially visible light energy (which takes a large portion of solar energy) provides a promising approach to solve the energy issue for CO2 conversion. This review provides a panorama of the latest progress in visible-light photocatalytic CO2 conversion, including (1) photocatalytic CO2 reduction with water, (2) photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and (3) photocatalytic reforming of CO2 and CH4. The catalysts are assessed with emphasis on advanced strategies and superb materials. The current issues associated with visible-light photocatalytic conversion of CO2 are discussed and suggestions for future developments are provided as an outlook.Chunling WangChunling Wang is an assistant professor at the School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (China).

1. Introduction
Energy is indispensable for the development of human society. In the past century, the over-consumption of fossil fuels has resulted in excessive emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), which consequently causes global warming. Several technologies such as scrubbing and mineral carbonation, geological injection, and oceanic injection have been developed for the sequestration of CO2. However, these technologies are high in cost and involve the risk of CO2 leakage.1 Alternatively, CO2 can be considered as a cheap, safe and abundant carbon source for conversion into valuable energy fuels. This turn-waste-into-wealth strategy could not only mitigate the greenhouse effect for the reduction of CO2 emission but also contribute to the alleviation of the energy crisis.
CO2 is an extremely stable linear symmetrical molecule with fully oxidized carbon and an average CO double bond energy of up to 804.4 kJ mol−1 (at 298 K), making the reduction of CO2 highly thermodynamically unfavorable.2–4 Recent research studies related to CO2 reduction include thermal reforming,5–7 hydrothermal conversion,8–10 electrochemical reduction,11–14 and chemical transformation.15–17 However, most of them consume a great amount of fossil fuels to provide sufficient thermal- and/or electrical energy for the breakage of CO bonds.
On the other hand, the widespread solar energy is clean and renewable. Since Inoue et al. discovered the possibility of photo-electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 in CO2-saturated aqueous suspensions of semiconductors under irradiation of a Xe lamp in 1979,18 photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to fuels, as a promising approach to address the increasing global energy shortage and environmental issues, has been developing rapidly.19–25
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to useful chemicals can be achieved by two pathways. One is a homogeneous process26 which includes photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 in photovoltaic cells and photo-catalytically splitting water to hydrogenate CO2 to chemicals. Homogeneous photocatalysts are mainly based on ruthenium and rhenium complexes bearing chromophoric ligands (e.g. [Ru(bipy)3]Cl2, [Re(bipy)(CO)Cl], etc.).27 Difficulty in the separation of catalysts and products is the biggest disadvantage in a homogeneous reaction system.
The other is a heterogeneous process. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 takes place at the solid–liquid or the solid–gas interface as the reaction directly occurs on heterogeneous catalysts. Design of appropriate photocatalysts plays a key role in heterogeneous photocatalytic CO2 conversion. There are various materials that show heterogeneous photocatalytic capabilities such as metal oxide or metal sulphide semiconductors (TiO2, ZnO, ZrO2, CdS, Fe2O3, and WO3), transition metal (Cu, Ni, and Fe), noble metal or alloy promoted semiconductors (Pt, Au, Rh, Ru, PtCu, and AuCu), and carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, and C3N4), etc. To date, products of CO2 photoconversion, which have been reported, include CO, alkanes (methane and ethane), olefins (ethylene and propylene), alcohols (methanol and ethanol), and organic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, and malonic acid).
A key challenge of photocatalytic CO2 conversion is the extremely low utilization of solar energy. When the energy of a photon is larger than the band gap energy (Eg) of the photocatalyst, it will excite an electron (e−) from the valence band (VB) to fill the conduction band (CB), leaving behind a hole (h+) in the VB of the catalyst.28 If the photoinduced electrons and holes have enough activity, active species could be generated (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Schematic energy diagram of a photoexcitation system. Eg is the band gap energy between the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB). 
The photon energy required for the photoexcitation depends on the bandgap of the photocatalyst. Most photocatalysts possess a bandgap wider than 3.2 eV, where electrons can just be excited by ultraviolet light (<400 nm). Thus, only about 4% of the total solar radiation at the earth's surface could be utilized, that is, large quantities (about 45% of sunlight) of visible light (400–750 nm) and near infrared light (700–2500 nm) could not be utilized efficiently. This leads to the insufficient utilization of total solar energy. Therefore, engineering a heterogeneous photocatalyst with an aim to narrow its energy bands to increase the absorption of solar light with a focus on visible light utilization is one of the key challenges in photocatalytic conversion of CO2.
Another crucial challenge is the low efficiency of the photocatalytic CO2 processes due to easy electron–hole recombination. When the simulated light irradiation generates electron and hole pairs, most of the generated electron–hole pairs suffer from recombination both at the surface and in the bulk of the photocatalyst; the minority could transfer to the outer surface of the catalyst and get trapped by the adsorbed CO2 species, as an acceptor CO2 molecule accepts the donated electron to generate free radicals (CO2 + e− → ˙CO2), which represents a reduction process. Donors such as H2O or H2 provide an electron to a hole to undergo an oxidation process. Many such oxidation and reduction processes associated with secondary reactions of CO2 produce final products. The photocatalytic activity depends on the ability of the catalyst to create electron–hole pairs and the rate of electron–hole recombination.
It is well-known that charge separation/migration and recombination are two competitive processes, and the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is believed to be one of the main reasons for the low efficiency of photocatalysis. Several strategies such as hetero-structuring, doping, and crystal growth have been proposed to facilitate charge separation and migration.29
In this review, we will focus on progress in visible light utilization for driving CO2 photoconversion in recent years. Photocatalysis reaction types and structured photocatalysts with different structures and morphologies, which promoted catalytic CO2 conversion reactions under visible light irradiation, will be discussed. This assessment is organized by three types of photocatalytic processes: photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O, H2, and CH4, respectively.
2. Visible-light photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O as the reducing agent is attractive as it mimics photosynthesis of plants in nature.18 The process is usually composed of multi-electron reactions as the reduction potential of one-electron activation of CO2 to CO2* is around −1.9 eV, which is above the CB levels of almost all the known semiconductors.21,30 Resultantly, a series of products could be obtained, such as CO, CH4, and CH3OH. Taking the production of CH4 as an example, during the photocatalytic process, while the photo-generated holes (h+) in the VB of the photocatalyst oxidize water into oxygen with simultaneous generation of protons (eqn (1)), the photogenerated electrons (e−) in the CB reduce CO2 to CH4via an eight-electron reaction with eight protons (eqn (2)). H2O + 2h+ → 1/2O2 + 2H+, 1.23 eV(1) CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O, −0.48 eV(2)
Accordingly, a minimum band gap energy of ∼1.27 eV is required for the photocatalyst used for the generation of CH4 by CO2 reduction. Currently, there are two main reaction systems for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. One is an aqueous system, where the low solubility of CO2 (∼0.03 M under ambient conditions) seriously limits the CO2 reduction efficiency with competitive generation of H2 from H2O. Therefore, in this kind of system, many attempts such as enhancing CO2 gas pressure and using alkaline solutions have been made to improve the solubility of CO2.31 The other system utilizes a mixture of H2O vapor and CO2, achieving a significantly higher selectivity for CO2 reduction.32 Various semiconductors were explored as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 with H2O and are summarized in Table 1.

2.1 Visible-light photocatalytic CO2 reduction on modified TiO2
To date, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most studied photocatalyst due to its relatively high efficiency, chemically and biologically nontoxic nature, low cost and commercial availability.33–36 However, CO2 conversion on pure TiO2 is less than ∼1% for a large band gap of TiO2 (∼3.20 eV) which only allows the absorption of UV light and a low quantum efficiency caused by the fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.37 Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase visible-light absorption and enhance the quantum efficiency of TiO2, including high-pressure densification,38 introducing oxygen vacancies,33,39 non-metal doping,40,41 dye-sensitization,42 and forming heterostructures with other visible-light responsive photocatalysts.43,44 There have been several excellent review papers focusing on TiO2-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2.37,40–42 Here, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of TiO2-based photocatalysts under visible light irradiation will be discussed.

2.1.1 TiO2 with oxygen vacancies. 
The presence of oxygen vacancy-related defects could not only enhance the light absorption of TiO2 in the visible-light range,45 but also act as activation sites for CO2 as well.46,47 Blue TiO2 nanocrystals with coexposed {101} and {001} facets (TiO2−x{001}–{101}) and oxygen deficiencies were synthesized by a hydrothermal process with TTIP and HF followed by annealing with NaBH4.48 The optimal catalyst exhibited a CO production rate of 27 μmol g−1 h−1 and a quantum yield of 0.134% in CO2 photo-reduction with water vapor under visible light (400 nm < λ < 700 nm) irradiation, which was more than 4 times those of TiO2 with a single {001} plane or {101} plane and TiO2 (P25). The possible reasons for this excellent performance were the exposure of more active sites (e.g., undercoordinated Ti atoms and oxygen vacancies), the facilitated electron transfer between {001} and {101} planes, and the formation of a new energy state (Ti3+) within the TiO2 band gap to extend the visible light response. The coexposed {001}–{101} facets increased the capacity of reversible CO2 adsorption and that of the combination of {001}–{101}, and Ti3+ enhanced the activation and conversion kinetics of the adsorbed species.
Besides, the oxygen vacancies remained stable after long-term exposure to air. Alternatively, TiO2 with a high concentration of Ti3+ and co-exposed {001} and {101} facets could be obtained immediately using a simple one-pot hydrothermal method with TiCl3, HCl and HF.49 With the oxygen vacancies, wide-spectrum solar light absorption was seen, especially in the near-infrared region, and an enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance and a higher CH4 selectivity under simulated sunlight irradiation were attained compared to those of the sample synthesized without HF. Besides, the obtained samples exhibited high stability for the formation of a unique disordered layer with a thickness of 1–2 nm on their surfaces, preventing the oxidation of Ti3+ species in air.
It was found that structural defects could be induced by high pressure sintering. Nanostructured anatase TiO2 densified at high pressures (0.5–2.1 GPa) showed an enhancement in visible light absorption due to the formation of structural defects without the change of the crystalline phase. When tested for photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the gas phase, formaldehyde was the main product with 10.3 μM (2.25 h) and 5.48 μM (2.67 h) formaldehyde on TiO2 samples (200 mg) which densified at 0.7 and 2.1 GPa, respectively, under Hg lamp irradiation (315–400 nm radiance reaching the reactor's upper surface was 18 W m−2 and the 450–950 nm radiance was 300 W m−2).
Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 can also be created by adding metals. The photoreaction of CO2 with H2O vapor under visible-light irradiation50 was evaluated over TiO2-coated Cu nanoparticles (denoted as Cu@TiO2) (Fig. 2). The quantities of CO and CH4 photoproducts for Cu@TiO2 (∼4%Cu) reached 0.8 μmol g−1 h−1 and 0.13 μmol g−1 h−1, which are 1.7 times of those for its counterpart (bared black TiO2). The improved photoactivity was attributed to the embedded metallic Cu, which promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 through the metal-oxide interaction, thus increasing the visible-light absorption of Cu@TiO2 and the adsorption of CO2 on their surface (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, it was found that the pre-treatment of CuO/TiO2 in He and H2 atmospheres resulted in transition to a surface dominated by Cu+ and mixed Cu+/Cu0, respectively. The pre-treatment also induced the formation of defect sites of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+.51 The H2-treated Cu/TiO2 catalyst exhibited excellent performance for CO2 photoreduction with water vapor under simulated solar irradiation, producing 25 μmol g−1 h−1 CO and 4.4 μmol g−1 h−1 CH4. This was mainly attributed to the following two factors: (1) the formation of surface defect sites promoting CO2 adsorption and subsequent charge transfer to the adsorbed CO2 and (2) the existence of Cu+/Cu0 couples that facilitate electron and hole trapping at different sites, and the synergy of the formation of surface defect sites promoting CO2 adsorption and subsequent charge transfer to the adsorbed CO2.

Co-dopants were also explored to generate oxygen vacancies in TiO2. Lee et al. reported Cu and V co-doped TiO2/PU (Cu@V-TiO2/PU) (PU = polyurethane) (Fig. 3) and Cu and Ag co-doped TiO2/PU (Ag@Cu-TiO2/PU) for the reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor.52 High production yields of CH4 and CO from the CO2 photo-reduction under visible light were obtained, reaching 933 and 588 μmol g−1 h−1 over 2Cu@4V-TiO2/PU and 880 and 550 μmol gcat−1 over 2Ag@4Cu-TiO2/PU.53 These high efficiencies under visible light should be attributed to the formation of Ti3+ in the doped TiO2 lattice, which created an intermediate band between the valence band and the conduction band of TiO2 and thus accelerated electron–hole pair separation. Besides, the oxygen vacancies on the surface of the photocatalysts could provide new adsorption sites to adsorb CO2.

2.1.2 TiO2 doped with non-metal and transient metal ions. 
Doping titania with nonmetals such as nitrogen (N),54 sulphur (S),55 and fluorine (F),56,57 or transient metal ions (like Ni2+) could lead to a narrowed band gap and hence induce the visible-light activity of TiO2.58
It was reported that N-doped TiO2 reduced CO2 in water to CH4, C2H2 and C2H6 with yields of 0.93, 0.05, and 0.07 μmol g−1, respectively, in 6 h under irradiation of 13 W integrated bulbs (400–800 nm).59 However, in this aqueous system, the H2 yield (77.66 μmol g−1) was prominent. Loading the chlorophyll in Spirulina onto the N-TiO2 could promote the generation of higher-value hydrocarbons, i.e. C2H2 (0.12 μmol g−1) and C2H6 (0.17 μmol g−1). Nitrogen-doped anatase TiO2 microsheets with 65% (001) and 35% (101) exposed faces, which were fabricated by the hydrothermal method using TiN as the precursor in the presence of HF and HCl, achieved 0.14 μmol g−1 h−1 CH3OH yield due to their high crystallinity, large surface area, and desirable wide spectrum optical response. Furthermore, a high CO2 reduction activity (∼2.4 μmol g−1 h−1) has been observed for 10% I− doped TiO2 catalysts with a mixture of anatase and brookite phases under visible light irradiation (>400 nm).60 With metal particles loaded on the nitrogen-doped TiO2, the CO2 conversion could be further enhanced. It was demonstrated that the production of CH4 by CO2 photoreduction under visible light irradiation followed the order N-Pt (2.7 μmol g−1 h−1) > N-Au (1.5 μmol g−1 h−1) > N-Ag (0.7 μmol g−1 h−1).61 The optimum amounts of N and Pt were 0.84 and 0.2 at%, respectively. When both Cu and Pt nanoparticles were coated on N-doped TiO2, a hydrocarbon production rate of 160 μL h−1 g−1 without carbon monoxide was obtained under AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2) irradiation.
Incorporation of Ni2+ into the TiO2 matrix inhibits the grain growth of anatase crystallites and suppresses phase transformation.62 When the Ni2+ atom replaced some of the Ti atoms in the crystal lattice of TiO2, not only the electronic structure of the original TiO2 changed to allow extended optical absorption in the visible light range, but the surface area and grain size of the catalyst were also altered. Besides, the recombination of the photogenerated electron/hole pairs was greatly suppressed by the p–n junction of NiO–TiO2. Resultantly, the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction both in the UV and visible light was significantly enhanced with an optimal Ni2+ loading amount of 1.5 wt%. With varying concentrations of Cr, V and Co, the TiO2 sol deposited on ceramic honeycomb monolithic structures threaded with optical fibres showed red shifts of absorption edges and increased light absorption in the visible light region compared to pure TiO2.63 A maximum acetaldehyde rate of 11.13 μmol g−1 h−1 in vapour-phase CO2 photoreduction with H2O under visible light irradiation was achieved over the 0.5 wt% V–TiO2 monolith after 4 h of visible light irradiation.
Metal and non-metal co-doping of TiO2 has also been carried out for an advanced visible-light performance. The synergistic effect of N and Ni2+ on nano-structured TiO2 in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 rendered an optimal methanol yield of 3.59 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light (λ = 400–780 nm) irradiation.64 While the doped N enhanced the light response of TiO2, the Ni2+ in the lattice could improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by acting as a probable electron trapper to ensure a good separation of electron–hole pairs. Then the Ni+ formed could be oxidized back to Ni2+ by transferring electrons to the active CO2 species. However, an excessive amount of Ni+ could function as the recombination sites of photogenerated charges and resulted in decreased activities.


2.1.3 TiO2 deposited with plasmonic cocatalysts. 
Plasmonic metal nanoparticles such as Au and Ag deposited on TiO2 are expected to show various effects, including (i) enhancing the electron–hole separation for the formation of Schottky barriers,66 (ii) extending the light absorption into the visible range and enhancing the surface electron excitation by their surface plasmon resonance effects,67–69 and (iii) modify the surface properties of photocatalysts.70,71
Cronin et al. reported that Au nanoparticle/TiO2 catalyzed the photo-reduction of CO2 and water vapor over a wide range of wavelengths.65 When the photon energy matched the plasmon resonance energy of the Au nanoparticles (free carrier absorption), which was in the visible range (532 nm), a 24-fold (23.1 μmol m−2 h−1) enhancement in the photocatalytic activity could be observed because of the intense local electromagnetic fields created by the surface plasmons of the Au nanoparticles. These intense electromagnetic fields enhanced sub-bandgap absorption in the TiO2, enhancing the photocatalytic activity in the visible range (Fig. 4). When the photon energy was high enough to excite d band electronic transitions of the Au in the UV range (254 nm), a different mechanism occurred, resulting in the production of additional reaction products, including C2H6, CH3OH, and HCHO. Plasmonic Ag nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on TiO2 nano-wire films (Ag/TiO2) were used for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to obtain methanol (CH3OH).72 The composites exhibited visible-light-harvesting properties based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Ag and restrained recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes for Ag NPs functioning as electron traps. No CH3OH could be observed over the pure TiO2 film under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation, whereas 1.0 μmol cm−2 h−1 CH3OH yield was obtained on the 0.7 Ag/TiO2 film.

Recently, it was found that metal alloys with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects could exert a greater influence on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. For example, TiO2 nanofibers co-decorated with Au and Pt nanoparticles (5–12 nm) through facile electro-spinning exhibited a CH4 production rate of 114 μmol g−1 h−1 under irradiation of a 500 W Xe lamp, which was 1.35 and 1.8 times higher than that of Pt/TiO2 and Au/TiO2, respectively.73 Cu–Au alloy nanoparticles modified with commercial P25 as a thin film highly selectively convert CO2 to CH4 at a rate of above 2000 μmol g−1 h−1 under simulated sunlight.74 The Au and Cu were alloyed in the nanoparticles, which exhibited a photocatalytic behaviour completely different from that of Au/P25 (hydrogen evolution) and Cu/P25 (lower activity, but similar methane selectivity). FT-IR spectroscopy and chemical analysis revealed a mechanism, in which the role of Au was to respond to visible light and that of Cu was to bind to CO. Therefore, a direct reduction pathway was proposed.


2.1.4 TiO2-based heterostructures. 
Combining TiO2 with visible-light responsive photocatalysts to form heterojunctions is another way to enhance CO2 reduction activity on TiO2 under visible light. For many visible-light responsive photocatalysts, such as GaP,75 CdSe,76 PbS,77 and CdS,78 their narrow band structures may not allow CO2 reduction with simultaneous water oxidation. To obtain an appropriate matching of the CB and VB positions, integrating them with wide-band-gap TiO2 could not only promote the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs but also make CO2 reduction possible.
Although the electrons from the CB of GaP were able to reduce CO2 to CH4, the oxidation of water was limited by its high VB, rendering GaP an ineffective catalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with water as the reductant. But once it was combined with TiO2, a remarkable photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction with water to methane was achieved.75 Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity increased with the decreasing mass ratio of GaP/TiO2, reaching a CH4 production rate of 12 μmol g−1 h−1 at a mass ratio of 1/10. Such a good photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the tuned band structures of the composite and the efficient charge transfer between GaP and TiO2 heterojunctions.
Lead chalcogenides are exceptional candidates for solar energy conversion applications because of their small band gaps (even available for near IR absorption) and ability to undergo efficient carrier multiplication under visible light photoexcitation.77 As shown in Fig. 5a, the band alignment between small PbS quantum dots (QDs) and TiO2 favours charge separation across the interface, eliminating inefficiencies associated with direct carrier recombination. The sensitization of TiO2 catalysts by PbS quantum dots (QDs) led to the size dependent photocatalytic reduction of CO2 at frequencies ranging from the violet to the orange-red edge of the electromagnetic spectrum (λ = 420 to 610 nm) (Fig. 7).79 Under broadband illumination (UV-NIR), the PbS QDs enhanced CO2 photoreduction rates of TiO2 by a factor of 5 (CO 0.82 μmol g−1 h−1, H2 0.85 μmol g−1 h−1, CH4 0.58 μmol g−1 h−1, and C2H6 0.31 μmol g−1 h−1). CdSe quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 heterostructures were capable of catalysing the photoreduction of CO2 only under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm).76 The primary reaction product was CH4 (48 ppmg−1 h−1), while CH3OH, H2, and CO were observed as secondary products. Hybrid TiO2/CdS catalysts in water with isopropanol (IPA) were explored for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CH4.78 As compared to TiO2, TiO2/CdS increased the production of CH4 (1.8 μmol g−1 h−1) by a factor of ∼10, whereas the production of H2 and CO remained comparable.

LaFeO3 has been regarded as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst owing to its narrow bandgap (∼2.0 eV). Jing et al. reported that TiO2-coupled N-doped porous perovskite-type LaFeO3 nanocomposites (Fig. 6) exhibited exceptional visible-light photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion to CH4 and CO with yields of 13.75 μmol g−1 h−1 and 18.75 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively.80

2.1.5 TiO2 combined with carbon materials. 
Graphene is a single two-dimensional nanosheet composed of sp2 hybridized carbon81,82 with a highly flexible structure,83 a large surface area,84 and high transparency.85 Furthermore, it also possesses unique electrical properties such as massless fermions, ballistic electron transport, and ultrahigh electron mobility.86,87 The combination of graphene with TiO2 proves to be a promising way to improve photocatalytic activity. When combining TiO2 nanocrystals with graphene, the excited electrons of TiO2 transferring from the conduction band (CB) to graphene demonstrate the depression of electron–hole recombination via a percolation mechanism.88
Tan et al. reported that a graphene oxide-doped oxygen-rich TiO2 (5GO-OTiO2) photocatalyst possesses a sequential combination of both water oxidation and CO2 reduction with a CH4 yield of 1.8 μmol g−1 h−1 over 5GO-OTiO2 under visible light irradiation.89
The nanosheet structure of Ti0.91O2 and graphene (which forms hollow spheres) can achieve rates of 7.05 μmol g−1 h−1 (CH4) and 15.2 μmol g−1 h−1 (CO), which are much larger than those of commercial P25 TiO2 (0.69 and 0.16 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively).90 The higher photo-catalytic activity may be due to the hollow structure of Ti0.91O2. The Ti0.91O2 hollow spheres exhibit successful separation between the reduction sites (edge) and the oxidation sites (surface) and an ultrathin thickness. Therefore, the hollow structure allows charge carriers to move rapidly onto the surface to participate in the photoreduction reaction. Furthermore, the hollow structure may also allow the multiple scattering of incident light to enhance light absorption.
Graphene-based TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) were found to offer improved photoelectrochemical properties, since graphene can enhance light absorption and promote charge transfer.91 A one-dimensional array of TNTs covered with reduced graphene oxide-TiO2 nanoparticle composites (rGO-TiO2) showed a CH4 evolution (5.67 ppm cm−2 h−1) about 4.4 times higher than that of a pure TNT sample (1.28 ppm cm−2 h−1). The intimate contact between TiO2 and rGO was proposed to accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons on TiO2 to rGO, leading to effective charge anti-recombination and thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity under light irradiation.
Solvent-exfoliated graphene (SEG) is a kind of thinnest platelet which was produced by sedimentation steps.92 Hersam et al. found that RGO possesses a significantly higher defect density than SEG.93 In contrast to conventional recognition regarding the importance of defects in catalysis, the less defective SEG showed higher photocatalytic activity than RGO for the reduction of CO2 to CH4, with up to a 7-fold improvement compared to pure TiO2 under visible illumination. This is attributed to its superior electrical mobility, which facilitates the diffusion of photoexcited electrons to reactive sites.
Carbon nanomaterial dimensionality is a key factor in determining the spectral response and reaction specificity of carbon–titania nanosheet composite photocatalysts. Hersam et al. investigated the effect of dimensionality on the photocatalytic behaviour of graphene–titania.94 They found that 2D–2D graphene–titania nanosheet composites exhibit superior electronic coupling compared to 1D–2D carbon nanotube–titania nanosheet composites, leading to greater enhancement factors for CO2 photoreduction under ultraviolet irradiation, while 1D carbon nanotubes are shown to be more effective titania photosensitizers, leading to greater photoactivity enhancement factors under visible light illumination (2 μmol m−2 h−1).
Furthermore, Cu2O-doped graphene/TiO2 with the monolithic two-sided Cu2O/graphene/TiO2 nanotube array (TNA) heterostructure exhibits efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion to methanol under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm).96 The combined heterojunction in the ternary composite helps to improve the photocatalytic performance by increasing light absorption, preventing electron–hole recombination and facilitating electron transfer across the heterojunction interfaces, as revealed by photoelectrochemical measurements. A methanol generation rate of 45 μmol cm−2 h−1 was achieved, which is much higher than those reported with existing TNA-based photocatalysts. Moreover, a quantum efficiency of 5.71% at 420 nm has been attained. The improved photocatalytic activity together with the proposed reaction mechanism demonstrates the advantages of the Cu2O/graphene/TNA heterostructure, which can efficiently suppress charge recombination, enhance interfacial charge transfer, and inhibit the backward reaction by separating the photocatalytic reaction sites.


2.1.6 Amine-functionalized titanate. 
Titanate with a certain modification could exhibit a decent visible-light activity. Hierarchical amine-functionalized titanate nanosheets, which are based on yolk@shell microspheres with engineered multilevel microstructures as an advanced semiconductor photocatalyst, were used for the conversion of CO2 (Fig. 7).95 The organic amine diethylenetriamine played multiple roles, such as controlling the crystallography, morphology, and texture of titanate nano-architectures, strongly absorbing visible-light, and enhancing CO2 adsorption capacity. It was expected that such yolk@shell structures should introduce multiple reflections of incident light within the hollow chamber and improve the light harvesting. CH3OH (8 μmol g−1 h−1) was yielded as the major product, with a small amount of HCHO under visible-light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm).

2.2 Other metal oxide-based photocatalysts
While great efforts have been made to improve the CO2 photocatalytic performance based on TiO2 under visible light, exploration of other visible-light responsive semiconductors such as metal oxide composites and mixed metal oxides as alternatives to TiO2 has also been carried out.97
The first-row transition metal oxides (Fe2O3, Cu2O, etc.) are inexpensive, oxidatively robust, environmentally benign, and visible-light responsive.98 Many studies have been devoted to developing transition-metal-oxide-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2.99 α-Fe2O3 is an n-type semiconductor (2.2 eV), whose flat-band potential is lower than that required for CO2 reduction.100 Cu2O is an intrinsically p-type semiconductor with a bandgap of 2–2.2 eV and a conduction band at −1.15 eV. In the composite with p and n-type semiconductors, the photogenerated electrons from α-Fe2O3 with a higher conduction band could transport to Cu2O with a lower conduction band.
Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes from the lower Cu2O valence band transport to the higher α-Fe2O3 valence band. This may also lead to the separation of electrons and holes, enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency. For example, hematite–cuprous oxide (α-Fe2O3/Cu2O) nanocomposites for the photoreduction of CO2 attained a maximum CO yield of 1.67 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible-light irradiation in the presence of water vapor.102 The CO yields of all the composite samples are significantly higher than those of Fe2O3 or Cu2O. This work suggests that the photoactivity of this system is intensively related to the formation of heterojunctions.
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an n-type semiconductor with a relatively wide band gap of 3.37 eV.101 Single crystal zinc gallium oxynitride (ZnGaNO) nanotubes103 achieved an enhanced photo-catalytic performance in CO2 reduction with a visible-light production of 0.075 μmol g−1 h−1 CH4. In order to extend the operating conditions to higher wavelength, a p-type semiconductor, zinc telluride (ZnTe), with a band gap of 2.26 eV could be considered for the formation of a heterostructure. The ZnO/ZnTe cation heterostructure exhibited good photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 into CH4 (44.56 μmol g−1 h−1) under visible light.104
A reduced graphene oxide wrapped CuZnO@Fe3O4 microsphere (rGO@CuZnO@Fe3O4) photocatalyst with a highly efficient, recyclable, and magnetically separable core–shell structure has been developed for photoreduction of carbon dioxide with water to produce methanol under visible light irradiation.101 The synthesis process of rGO@CuZnO@Fe3O4 microspheres is shown in Fig. 8. Owing to the synergistic effect of the components and the presence of a thin Fe2O3 layer on Fe3O4, rGO@CuZnO@Fe3O4 exhibited a high visible-light activity with a methanol yield of 106.3 μmol g−1 h−1. This photocatalytic activity was assumed to be due to the restoration of the sp2 hybridized aromatic system in rGO, which facilitated the movement of electrons and resulted in better charge separation.

As one of the earth abundant oxides, WO3 possesses a band gap (Eg) of 2.5–2.8 eV and thus exhibits strong light absorption up to the near infrared (NIR) (780–1100 nm) region, leading to a high absorption of about 12% of the solar spectrum.107 WO3 also has better electron transport (ca. 12 cm2 V−1 s−1) than TiO2 (0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1).108 The crystal structure and morphology of WO3 can also affect its optical absorption, charge separation, redox capability, and electrical conductivity. The nanosheet structure of WO3 (4–5 nm in thickness), corresponding to six repeating unit cells of monoclinic WO3 along the c axis, enhanced the performance for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 (in the presence of water) into hydrocarbon fuels (CH4 1.14 μmol g−1 h−1), which does not occur with its bulk form (Fig. 9a).105 The size-quantization effects of this ultrathin nanostructure alter the WO3 band gap, leading to high photocatalytic activity. Tuning the crystal facets of WO3 is an important strategy to optimize its reactivity for targeted reactions. Liu et al. synthesized rectangular sheet-like WO3 crystals with predominant {002} facets by controlling acidic hydrolysis of crystalline (Fig. 9b).106 As a result of electronic structure effects induced by the crystal facets, the rectangular sheet-like WO3 crystals, with an elevated conduction band minimum of 0.3 eV, can photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CH4 with a yield of 0.34 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of H2O vapor.

Nanoplate containing ball-flower-like Bi2WO6 was investigated in a continuous-flow reaction system under visible light irradiation (420 nm < λ < 620 nm).109 CO (333 nmol g−1 h−1) was detected as the main product of this photocatalytic process, and H2O was found to suppress the conversion of CO2 to CO due to its competitive absorption with CO2 on the medium strength basic sites of Bi2WO6 while Bi2WO6 nanoplates with dominated {001} facets showed a CH4 production of 1.09 μmol g−1 h−1 when used for visible-light photocatalytic CO2 reduction.110 The ultrathin geometry of the nanoplates allowed charge carriers to move rapidly from the interior to the surface to participate in the photoreduction reaction, which also improved the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The replacement of the W atom with Mo generated hierarchical flower-like Bi2MoO6, exhibiting highly efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into methanol and ethanol under visible-light irradiation.111 After 4 h irradiation, the yields of methanol and ethanol were 24.8 and 18.8 μmol gcat−1, respectively, higher than that of Bi2WO6 hollow microspheres.
Indium-oxide (In2O3) has a reduction potential (−0.62 eV) that meets the requirement for converting CO2 to CO (−0.53 eV) and CH4 (−0.24 eV). In2O3 nanobelts coated with a 5 nm-thick carbon layer (Fig. 10) provided an enhanced photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4, yielding CO and CH4 evolution rates of 126.6 and 27.9 μmol h−1, respectively, with water as the reductant and Pt as the co-catalyst.112 The carbon coating promoted the absorption of visible light, improved the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs, increased the chemisorption of CO2, made more protons (from water splitting) participate in CO2 reduction, and thereby facilitated the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4.

Tantalum oxynitride (TaON), which is derived from Ta2O5 during the ammonification process, is one of the most important oxy-nitrides that show remarkable advantages for visible light absorption.113 The porous spherical architecture of TaON plays a significant role in the CO2 photocatalytic conversion into C2H5OH (2.03 μmol gcat−1 h−1) and CH3CHO (0.52 μmol gcat−1 h−1) under visible light irradiation.114
SnNb2O6 is a typical layer-structured semiconductor used as a photocatalyst in water splitting and the degradation of organic pollutants.115–117 Wang et al. applied monolayer SnNb2O6 nanosheets with high crystallinity to the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O in the absence of co-catalysts and sacrificial agents under visible light irradiation.118 The adsorption capacity of CO2 on the SnNb2O6 nanosheets was much higher than that of conventional SnNb2O6. By optimizing its crystallinity, purity, surface area and surface basicity, the obtained sample exhibited the highest CH4 evolution rate of 110.9 μL h−1 g−1 (4.95 μmol h−1 g−1).
Strontium titanate (SrTiO3), which is a wide band-gap semiconductor, is widely investigated as a photocatalyst.42,119 Attempts have been made to extend the activity of SrTiO3 for CO2 reduction from the UV light to the visible-light range. The substitution of Ti4+ ions in SrTiO3 by transition metal ions showed visible light activity for CO2 reduction.120 Among the SrTiO3 samples doped with Co, Fe, and Ni ions, the Co-doped SrTiO3 exhibited the most outstanding photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction. Furthermore efficient conversion of CO2 to CH4 could be obtained over nanostructured Pt–SrTi0.98Co0.02O3 with a CH4 yield of 63.6 ppm h−1 under visible light irradiation, which is about 3 times higher than that over Pt–TiO2/N. Rh and Au co-doped SrTiO3 was evaluated for syngas photosynthesis from low-cost CO2 and H2O feedstock under visible-light irradiation.121 The Au–Rh synergistic effect in Au–Rh/SrTiO3 resulted in a high syngas yield, which is 22- and 153-fold that of Au@SrTiO3 and Rh@SrTiO3 samples, respectively.
2.3 C3N4-based catalysts
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) (Fig. 11) is a two-dimensional conjugated polymer, which is a promising metal-free and visible-light-responsive photocatalyst. g-C3N4 has recently been intensively explored for water splitting, organic synthesis, environmental purification, and CO2 conversion.122–127 Pristine g-C3N4 could be employed in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, because its high CB bottom favours the reduction half-reaction.128 The high porosity of g-C3N4 nanomaterials,129 bulk g-C3N4, and g-C3N4 nanosheets130 was exploited for the CO2 photoreduction in the presence of water vapor. The narrower band gap of bulk g-C3N4 mainly produces CH3CHO, whereas the wider band gap of nanosheet g-C3N4 yields the main product of CH4.

The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 for CO2 reduction can be enhanced by using noble metals (such as Pt and Pd) as co-catalysts, which could facilitate the bulk-to-surface transfer and surface accumulation of the photogenerated electrons.
It was revealed that the CH4 yield increased with the increasing amount of Pt on the g-C3N4 from 0 to 1 wt% and then decreased at 2 wt% Pt loading. The maximum production of CH3OH and HCHO was observed with 0.75 wt% Pt.131 As for Pd as the co-catalyst, the selectivity to CO2 reduction was significantly higher with Pd nano-tetrahedrons than that with Pd nanotubes (ca. 80% versus 20%). The reduction of CO2 preferred to occur on Pd{111} facets with production of H2 (9.7 μmol g−1 h−1), CO (20.3 μmol g−1 h−1), C2H5OH (21.8 μmol g−1 h−1), and CH4 (2.8 μmol g−1 h−1).132
The g-C3N4 could form heterojunctions with other semiconductors to facilitate the charge transfer through the matched band structures and thus to accelerate the CO2 photoreduction process. The α-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 hybrid with a Z-scheme system provides an enhanced photocatalytic activity for reduction of CO2 to CO, leading to a CO yield of 27.2 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 2.2 times larger than that (10.3 μmol g−1 h−1) over g-C3N4 alone.133 The interactions between ZnO and g-C3N4 promoted the formation of the ZnO/g-C3N4 hetero-junction structure, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and enhancing the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.134
When g-C3N4 was combined with SnO2−x and CdMoO4, respectively, 3 and 6 μmol g−1 h−1 CH3OH were produced by CO2 reduction.135 This can be attributed to the formation of a hetero-junction structure between SnO2−x (or CdMoO4) and g-C3N4, which efficiently promoted the separation of electron–hole pairs by a direct Z-scheme mechanism to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, SnO2-coupled boron and phosphorus co-doped g-C3N4 (SO/B-P-CN) nanocomposites exhibited enhanced visible-light activities for CO2 conversion to CH4 with a CH4 yield of 37.5 μmol g−1 h−1 from CO2-containing water.136 The introduction of TiO2 into g-C3N4 can also improve the activity and selectivity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with water vapor.137 For example, the coupling of g-C3N4 with N-TiO2 enhanced the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with water vapor at room temperature.137 Both CH4 and CO were generated over the N-TiO2 sample, whereas the g-C3N4/N-TiO2 composite selectively produced only CO. The highest amount of CO (12.2 μmol g−1 h−1) obtained on the optimized photocatalyst was four times that of commercial P25 TiO2. This change in product selectivity could originate from the formed g-C3N4.
Doping non-metals such as S and P into g-C3N4 could influence the surface reaction of CO2 and water under visible light irradiation.138 The combination of g-C3N4 with red phosphor (r-P) exhibited improved photocatalytic CO2 conversion with water vapor, leading to 295 μmol g−1 h−1 of a valuable hydrocarbon fuel (CH4), which is two times higher than that (145 μmol g−1 h−1) over pure r-P and nearly three times that (107 μmol g−1 h−1) over pure g-C3N4. This can be attributed to the synergetic effect of r-P and g-C3N4, which could promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes across the r-P/g-C3N4 heterojunction.
2.4 Bismuth-based photocatalysts
Bismuth oxyhalide (BiOX, X = Br, I) photocatalysts exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity due to their unique layered crystalline structure.139 This happened because the increased defect concentration, small size effect, and enhanced internal electric field intensity of few-layered BiOX resulted in the improvement of photon absorption and carrier separation. Under visible/near-infrared-light, few-layered BiOI can photocatalytically convert CO2 into CO and CH4 with yields of 4.1 and 0.42 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively.140 The yield of CO was increased to 22.85 μmol g−1 h−1 with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.372 at 400 nm using the Bi4O5BrI photocatalyst.141
Bismuth sulphide (Bi2S3) is a p-type semiconductor with a lamellar structure, which possesses a narrow bandgap (∼1.3 eV) and high absorption coefficient. Bi2S3 nanoribbons with the largest length-to-width ratio, which were synthesized with a facile solvothermal synthesis, exhibited the best performance for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, leading to a methanol yield up to 32.02 μmol g−1 h−1.142 The high activity was mainly due to the most negative CB potential, the largest BET specific surface area, and lowest recombination of photogenerated charge carriers of this catalyst.
2.5 Other semiconductors
The CdS@CeO2 core/shell composite shows a higher yield for both methane and methanol than CdS for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under visible-light irradiation. This can be attributed to the lower recombination rate of photogenerated electron/hole pairs and the larger BET specific surface area of the core/shell composite.143 Moreover, the CdS@CeO2 core/shell composite also shows improved stability for the photocatalytic process.
Silver halides AgX (X = Cl, Br), which are light sensitive compounds, were explored for CO2 reduction. The plasmonic shaped cube-tetrapod-like AgCl:Ag nanoparticles and AgBr:Ag nanoplates display stronger absorption in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles.144 Under visible light irradiation, reduction of CO2 over the anisotropic AgCl:Ag nanoparticles produced methanol with a yield up to 37.7 μmol g−1 h−1.
3. Photocatalytic reaction of CO2 with H2
CO2 conversion requires a large energy input or co-feeding of a high-energy reactant. Hydrogen is one of the most typical high energy reactants that are suitable for CO2 transformation. CO2 hydrogenation is an important catalytic process of both industrial and academic interest.165 The most general process for hydrogenation of CO2 is the thermal catalytic process,166 which needs high temperature and high pressure, and consumes a large quantity of fossil fuels.
Photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation is a promising way for CO2 transformation. As high-energy intermediates impose large kinetic barriers, UV light or UV–visible light irradiation can help achieve good rates and yields in the eight-electron reduction of CO2 by hydrogen.165,167 The active valence band holes in a photocatalyst can oxidize H2 to produce H+. Then H+ and active electrons can reduce CO2 to CO, CH3OH, and hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8). It is favourable to form methane or CO products by photocatalytic conversion of CO2 with hydrogen. CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O, ΔH298K = −252.9 kJ mol−1(3) CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O, ΔH298K = 41.2 kJ mol−1(4)
Reports related to photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation under visible light irradiation are rare. As CO2 molecules are difficult to activate under visible light irradiation, some strategies such as introducing plasmonic nanoparticles (Au, Ag, etc.) could be introduced (Table 2).

Jain et al. reported that plasmonic Au-NP photocatalysts can harvest visible light for multielectron and multiproton reduction of CO2 to yield C1 (methane) and C2 (ethane) hydrocarbons.154 Loading Au-NPs onto TiO2 NWs significantly improved CO2 photoreduction with H2 and the yield of CO, which increased with the content of Au-NPs with an optimal Au loading of about 0.5 at%.168 The maximum CO and CH3OH yield rate over 0.5 wt% Au-NPs/TiO2 NWs reached 1237 and 12.65 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. The quantum efficiencies of CO, CH4 and CH3OH production were 0.283, 0.012, and 0.010%, respectively. The CO2 reduction efficiency on the Au-NPs/TiO2 NWs was 28.3 and 83 times higher than that on TiO2 NWs and TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. The noticeably enhanced photoactivity was due to the increased visible light absorption due to the LSPR effect of Au-NPs and hindered charge recombination by the Au-metal.
Plasmonic resonance also helps to increase the local temperature on catalysts. Under the excitation of a low power 532 nm laser, Au nanoparticles attached to the surface of ZnO catalysts led to significant heating of the catalyst and the conversion of CO2 with H2 to CH4 and CO was greatly enhanced.169 Temperature-calibrated Raman spectra of ZnO phonons showed that intensity-dependent plasmonic excitation could controllably heat Au–ZnO from 30 to ∼600 °C with simultaneous tuning of the CH4:CO product ratio. The laser-induced temperature and resulting distribution of CH4 and CO agreed well with predictions from thermodynamic models and temperature-programmed reaction experiments, indicating that the reaction is a thermally driven process.
The apparent quantum yield for CO2 conversion under continuous wave 532 nm laser illumination was 0.030%. The reaction rate of 4.22 μmol g−1 h−1 on the Au–ZnO catalyst under ∼8 × 105 W m−2 532 nm laser illumination was nearly 4 times that on TiO2 catalysts under visible light excitation in a similar reaction cell. Besides, the Au–ZnO catalysts were robust and remained active after repeated laser exposure and cycling.
Au/Ag alloy NP-decorated TiO2 NWs lead to enhanced photoactivity for CO2 reduction with H2,170 producing 1813 μmol g−1 h−1 CO with a selectivity of 98%. This production was approximately 1.72, 1.84, 72.52 and 201 times those of Au-NPs/TiO2 NWs, Ag-NPs/TiO2 NWs, TiO2 NWs, and bare TiO2-NPs, respectively. This enhancement is due to synergistic effects of Au/Ag-NPs with enhanced visible light absorption and improved charge separation.
The photocatalytic activity of the composite B4C/g-C3N4 loaded with a Pt co-catalyst has been evaluated for CO2 reduction with H2 to CH4 under visible light irradiation as well.171 The coupling of p-type B4C with n-type g-C3N4 significantly improved the performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Owing to efficient photo-excited electron/hole separation caused by the internal electric field formed at the p-B4C/n-C3N4 interface, the composite photocatalyst with an optimum B4C mass fraction of 1/6 showed a production of CH4 approximately 6 and 8 times higher than that of g-C3N4 and B4C, respectively.
4. Photocatalytic CO2 reforming of methane
Methane (CH4) is the main component of natural gas and is also the second most prevalent greenhouse gas. CO2 conversion through methane reforming (CRM) into syngas H2 and CO is an efficient approach to reduce the environmental concentration of the two-greenhouse gases, but the reaction temperature is usually high (around 800 °C). The addition of photon energy could sufficiently lower the temperature required for traditional CMR. However, there has been very limited exploration for photocatalytic CO2 reforming of methane (PCRM), and all reported PCRM processes exploited only UV light (which is ∼4% of the total solar energy), leading to very low H2 and CO yields (at the level of μmol g−1 h−1).172 Recently, Hu and his co-workers reported an efficient visible-light photocatalytic process for CO2 reforming of methane with a Pt/black TiO2 catalyst on the light-diffuse-reflection surface of a SiO2 substrate.172 As Fig. 12 shows, under visible light, the H2 and CO yields reached 71 and 158 mmol−1 gcat−1 h−1, with a quantum efficiency of 32.3% at 550 °C, and 129 and 370 mmol−1 gcat−1 h−1, with a quantum efficiency of 57.8% at 650 °C. The obtained photo CO and H2 yields are 1000 times larger than the reported values.172 This provides a novel approach for efficient conversion of the two greenhouse gasses using solar energy.

Li et al. reported that Pt-supported Si-modified CeO2 for photo-thermochemical CO2 reforming of methane to produce syngas by concentrated sunlight.173 In the process, Pt served as the thermocatalytic CRM catalyst and the co-catalyst for photocatalysis, CeO2 as the DRM support and the semiconductor photocatalyst, and Si as the promoter and the stabilizer. Under irradiation of the equivalent of 30 suns at 600 °C for 30 h, the production rates of H2 and CO reached stable levels of 90 and 154 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively, which are five and two times higher than those obtained in the dark at the same temperature.
CO2 could also be photocatalytically activated with the assistance of plasma electrons. Ye et al. exploited Au as the plasmonic promoter to enhance the catalytic performance of Ru/SBA-15 in DRM under visible-light irradiation.174 The catalytic activity was enhanced with the yields of H2 and CO of 222 and 243 mmol g−1 h−1 compared with those (105 mmol g−1 h−1 for H2 and 132 mmol g−1 h−1 for CO) without light irradiation. The UV/vis spectra and electromagnetic field simulation results revealed that the highly energetic electrons excited by local surface plasmon resonances of Au facilitated the polarization and activation of CO2 and CH4, a new route for CO2 with thermal assistance. Furthermore, they explored Ni-based catalysts for photocatalytic CRM.175 It was found that SiO2 encapsulated Ni nanocatalysts boosted the activity and stability due to localized surface plasmon resonance. This demonstrates the feasibility of non-precious photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic DRM.
5. Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 with other electron donors
5.1 Triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor
Triethanolamine, often abbreviated as TEOA, is now commonly and very effectively used as a complexing agent in electroless plating. In the presence of TEOA as an electron donor, a higher yield of CO2 photoreduction could be achieved. TiO2 was proposed to stabilize reduced catalyst intermediates but not participate directly in the electron transfer reactions.

5.1.1 TiO2-based photocatalysts. 
Attaching the phosphonate molecular catalyst [ReIBr(bpy)(CO)3] to the wide-bandgap semiconductor TiO2 strongly enhances the rate of the visible-light-driven reduction of CO2 to CO in dimethylformamide with TEOA as the sacrificial electron donor.176 The mechanism of catalyst photoreduction is initiated by ultrafast electron injection into TiO2, followed by rapid (ps–ns) and sequential two-electron oxidation of TEOA that is coordinated to the Re center. The injected electrons can be stored in the conduction band of TiO2 on a ms-s time scale for reduction of the Re catalyst. Thus, the excited Re catalyst would offer one electron and would eventually get three electrons back. The function of an electron reservoir would represent a role for TiO2 in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The increase in photocatalytic activity upon heterogenization of the catalyst to TiO2 is due to the slow charge recombination and the high oxidative power of the ReII species after electron injection as compared to the excited MLCT state of the unbound Re catalyst or when immobilized on ZrO2, which results in a more efficient reaction with TEOA (Fig. 13).

5.1.2 C3N4-based photocatalysts. 
Hybrid systems that consist of a metal complex and a particulate semiconductor are expected to be promising because of the excellent electrochemical (and/or photocatalytic) properties of metal complexes for CO2 reduction and the high efficiency of semiconductors for water oxidation.177 Metal-complex/semiconductor hybrid materials such as graphitic carbon nitride have been focused on as the semiconductor component for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction using hybrids of C3N4 and a Ru(II) complex under visible light was reported (Fig. 14).178 Three different Ru(II) complexes were employed as promoters: trans(Cl)-[Ru(X2bpy)(CO)2Cl2] (X2bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine with substituents X in the 4-positions, X = COOH, PO3H2, or CH2PO3H2), which are abbreviated as RuC (X = COOH), RuP (X = PO3H2), and RuCP (X = CH2PO3H2). When C3N4 modified with a larger amount of RuCP (>7.8 μmol g−1) was employed as a photocatalyst in a solvent having a relatively high donor number (e.g., N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) with the aid of TEOA as an electron donor, the hybrid photocatalyst exhibited high performance for CO2 reduction, producing CO and HCOOH with a relatively high CO selectivity (40–70%). On the other hand, HCOOH was the major product when RuC/C3N4 or RuP/C3N4 was employed regardless of the loading amount of the Ru(II) complex and the reaction solvent. The results of photocatalytic reactions and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy demonstrated that polymeric Ru species, which were formed in situ from RuCP on C3N4 under irradiation in a solvent having a high donor number, were active catalysts for CO formation. No sacrificial CO2 reduction using RuP/C3N4 was accomplished in a DMA solution containing methanol as an electron donor, which means that visible light energy was stored as chemical energy in the form of CO and formaldehyde.
 Fig. 14  Ru(II)-complex/carbon nitride hybrid photocatalyst for CO2 reduction under visible light. Ru(II) complexes with X = COOH, PO3H2, or CH2PO3H2 were employed, with abbreviations of RuC, RuP, and RuCP, respectively. Of course, part of HCOOH generated would exist in the form of HCOO− because of the presence of basic TEOA. However, we use “HCOOH” in this article for simplicity (reproduced with permission from ref. 178. Copyright © 2016, American Chemical Society).178 
Wang et al. reported that conjugated C3N4 nanosheets modified with barbituric acid (BA) were synthesized by a facile one-pot chemical condensation of urea.179 The performance of the developed C3N4-based semiconductors was investigated by applying them as polymeric photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 under visible light illumination. It was found that the copolymerization of urea with the BA co-monomer strongly altered the physical and chemical properties of the C3N4 polymer by improving optical absorption and creating a surface molecular heterojunction that promoted charge separation.
Consequently, an enhanced photocatalytic performance was achieved. Under the optimal reaction conditions, the best sample could effectively photocatalyze the CO2-to-CO conversion reaction with a 15-fold-enhanced catalytic activity, compared to the non-modified sample derived from urea.
A covalently linked reaction centre/antenna hybrid composed of Co–porphyrin and low-molecular-weight carbon nitride was developed for the reduction of CO2 into CO under visible light.180 The hybrid possessed a thirteen-fold higher photocatalytic activity (17 μmol g−1 h−1) compared with bulk carbon nitride, and it is more than twice of what it was in the Co-porphyrin loaded C3N4 heterojunction system. The efficient electron transfer and trapping by the Co active sites as well as the affinity of Co–porphyrin for CO2 was demonstrated to account for the enhanced activity.181 Furthermore, the selectivity of g-C3N4 for the photoreduction of CO2 could be tuned with metal-cocatalysts. For example, the introduction of Pt (or Pd) into g-C3N4 could form nanocomposites, leading to the main products of CH4 (0.3 μmol g−1 h−1), HCHO (0.1 μmol g−1 h−1) and CH3OH (0.2 μmol g−1 h−1).131
An In2O3–g-C3N4 hybrid structured catalyst, which was prepared via in situ growth of In2O3 nanocrystals onto the g-C3N4 surface, exhibited a CH4 rate of 975.7 ppmg−1 h−1 for the CO2 reduction.182 The enhanced activity was attributed to the heterojunction which can remarkably promote the charge transfer efficiency, increasing the charge carrier lifetime for the photocatalytic reactions. A similar enhanced photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was also observed for the In2O3–C composite catalyst, which was synthesized by coating a 5 nm-thick carbon layer on In2O3. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 produced CO and CH4 with yields of 126.6 and 27.9 μmol h−1, respectively, with water as the reductant and Pt as the co-catalyst.183


5.1.3 MOFs and CPs as photocatalysts. 
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)184 or coordination polymers (CPs)185 have provided a newly emerging platform to organize light-harvesting antennae and catalytic centres to achieve solar energy conversion owing to their structural diversity and controllable synthetic procedures.186 Besides, controllable integration of CPs with functional materials leads to the creation of new multifunctional composites/hybrids,187 which exhibit superior photocatalytic performances to those of the individual components due to the collective behaviour of the functional units,188 especially Zr and Ti-based MOFs.189
An amine-functionalized Ti-based porous MOF, NH2-MIL-125(Ti) (Ti8O8(OH)4(NH2-BDC)6, BDC = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate), was explored as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation.190 A significant change in NH2-MIL-125 (Ti) induced by the amino functionality was its optical absorption, which showed an obvious red shift from the adsorption band edge of 350 nm to around 550 nm, falling in the visible region. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over the NH2-MIL-125 (Ti) photocatalyst was carried out in acetonitrile (MeCN) with TEOA as the sacrificial agent under visible light irradiation, leading to about 8.14 μmol HCOO− after 10 h. The inactivity of the parent MIL-125(Ti) under otherwise similar conditions confirms that the visible light photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction over NH2-MIL-125(Ti) was actually induced by the amino functionality. TiIII was generated through an electron transfer from the photo-excited organic ligand (ATA) to the metal oxo-clusters ([TiO5(OH)]) in NH2-MIL-125(Ti) over the visible-light-responsive CO2 reduction. This is direct evidence that the redox-active metal ions in MOFs can be active species in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Furthermore, metal Pt or Au was exploited to dope the NH2-MIL-125(Ti) catalyst for the photoreduction of CO2 under visible-light irradiation.191 However, unlike over pure NH2-MIL-125(Ti), in which only formate was produced, both hydrogen and formate were formed over the Pt- and Au-loaded NH2-MIL-125(Ti). In addition, about 235 and 40.2 μmol hydrogen yields (in 8 h) were produced over Pt/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and Au/NH2-MIL-125(Ti), respectively, whereas no hydrogen was detected over NH2-MIL-125(Ti). Compared with pure NH2-MIL-125(Ti), Pt/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) showed an enhanced activity for formate production, whereas Au had a negative effect on this reaction. The hydrogen that spilled over from the noble metal Pt was supposed to participate in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are another type of MOF which are promising for CO2 capture and storage. A hybrid catalyst system was prepared by employing a CdS semiconductor as a catalyst and Co-ZIF-9 as a cocatalyst.192 This hybrid system cooperating with bipyridine and TEOA exhibits high catalytic activity in the conversion of CO2 to CO under visible light irradiation and mild reaction conditions. 13CO2 isotope experiments validated that the produced CO was from the photoreduction of CO2, instead of organics in the system. The cocatalyst concentration, reaction temperature, solvent properties, and water amount are all influencing factors for the photocatalytic activity. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a high apparent quantum yield of 1.93% was achieved under monochromatic irradiation of 420 nm.
Amino-functionalized NH2-UiO-66(Zr) showed photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation in the presence of TEOA as a sacrificial agent.193 The involvement of ZrIII in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction was confirmed by ESR spectroscopy. The amount of HCOO− formed by NH2-UiO-66(Zr) reached about 20.7 μmol in 10 h. The photoinduced electron transfer from the excited ATA to Zr oxo clusters in NH2-UiO-66(Zr) to generate ZrIII was revealed for the first time by PL studies. Facile partial substitution of the organic linker ATA by DTA in NH2-UiO-66(Zr) can further improve its photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction due to enhanced light absorption in the visible region and increased CO2 adsorption. Furthermore, NH2-UiO-66 was combined with Cd0.2Zn0.8S to form Cd0.2Zn0.8S@UiO-66-NH2 nanocomposites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation.194 The hybrid catalyst exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction as compared with pristine components. 6.8 μmol h−1 g−1 of CH3OH was also produced. The enhancement in the photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the efficient charge separation and transfer on the interface between Cd0.2Zn0.8S and UiO-66-NH2. In addition, the Cd0.2Zn0.8S@UiO-66-NH2 photocatalysts show excellent stability during photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
An MOF-253 supported active Ru carbonyl complex (MOF-253–Ru(CO)2Cl2) was constructed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation.195 The amounts of HCOO−, CO and H2 produced in 8 h over sensitized MOF-253–Ru(CO)2Cl2 (with a molar ratio of the Ru(bpy)2Cl2/Ru-complex of 1:2) were 4.84, 1.85, and 0.72 μmol, which are much larger than those produced over non-sensitized MOF-253–Ru(CO)2Cl2. Its performance can be further improved by immobilization as a photosensitizer. This study highlights the great potential of MOFs as a solid ligand and platform for the assembly of a complicated catalytic system.
Cu2+ in a porphyrin-based MOF promoted the photocatalytic CO2 conversion to methanol under visible light irradiation.196 The methanol evolution rate is 262.6 ppmg−1 h−1, about as large as 7 times that of the sample without Cu. This result confirmed that CO2 chemical adsorption on Cu2+ was beneficial for a high photoreduction efficiency.
With the MnCo2O4 microspheres as a heterogeneous cocatalyst, the photocatalytic performance of the CO2-to-CO conversion was remarkably enhanced to 13.8 μmol h−1 g−1.19713CO2 isotope tracer experiments verified that the CO product originated from the CO2 reactant.
The visible light responsive organic ligand derived from an anthracene group was used to prepare Zr6O4(OH)4(CO2)12 as Zr-MOF (Zr6 for short) compounds.198 The as-prepared Zr-MOF showed high CO2 uptake, broad-band visible light absorption, and efficient photoinduced charge generation. For visible-light-driven CO2 reduction on Zr6, formation of 183.3 μmol h−1 mmolMOF−1 formic acid was achieved. Both photocatalytic experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies revealed that both the inorganic building unit Zr6 oxo-cluster and the anthracene-based ligand contributed to the highly efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The dual photocatalytic routes are demonstrated to be more efficient for visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction than those typically relying on a ligand-to-metal charge transfer process. This illustrates a new strategy to design and synthesize novel visible-light photocatalysts for CO2 reduction with a high efficiency.
MOF-coated nanoparticle photocatalysts were demonstrated to enhance the CO2 reduction performance both in terms of activity and stability (Fig. 15).199 For example, a CO2-to-CO conversion photocatalyst, ReI(CO)3(BPYDC)Cl (BPYDC = 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylate), was covalently attached to a zirconium MOF, UiO-67 (Ren-MOF). By systematically controlling its density in the framework (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 16, and 24 complexes per unit cell), the highest photocatalytic activity was found for the Re3-MOF. Furthermore, when the Re3-MOF was coated onto Ag nanocubes (Ag ⊂ Ren-MOF), which spatially confined photoactive Re-centres to the intensified near-surface electric fields at the surface of Ag nanocubes, a 7-fold enhancement of CO2-to-CO conversion was obtained under visible light with long-term stability (maintained up to 48 h).

5.1.4 COPs as photocatalysts. 
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are a kind of newly emerging material, which can integrate CO2-philic groups (such as azo, triazine, tetrazole, imidazole, and amine groups) into their frameworks, showing high performances in CO2 capture and its further conversion. Liu et al. reported that N, O, and P-containing covalent organic polymers (NOP–COP) could capture CO2 and further photocatalyze its reduction to CH4 under visible-light irradiation in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent in water. NOP–COP showed a high CO2 absorption capacity of 7.21 wt% under ambient conditions and exhibited an appropriate energy band structure (Eg = 2.14 eV, CB = −0.81 eV) for visible light absorption and CO2 photoreduction to CH4.200


5.1.5 Co3O4 photocatalysts. 
Co3O4 hexagonal platelets with controllable facets enable highly efficient visible-light photocatalytic reduction of CO2 (Fig. 16a).201 As shown in Fig. 16c, which summarizes the photoactivity by using Co3O4 hexagonal platelets and other contrast samples, one can see that the Co3O4 hexagonal platelet catalyst exhibited an average yield of CO of 2003 μmol h−1 g−1 in the first 3 h of reaction with a high selectivity of 77.1%.

5.2 Hydrous hydrazine as the electron donor
Ye et al. reported photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by hydrous hydrazine (N2H4·H2O) over Au–Cu alloy nanoparticles supported on SrTiO3/TiO2 coaxial nanotube arrays.202 Efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into CO and hydrocarbons by hydrous hydrazine (N2H4·H2O) was achieved due to (1) the synergetic catalytic effect of the Au–Cu alloy nanoparticles and the fast electron-transfer in the SrTiO3/TiO2 coaxial nanoarchitecture and (2) N2H4·H2O acting as the H source and electron donor that provides a reducing atmosphere to protect the surface Cu atoms from oxidation. This approach opens a feasible route to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency, which also benefits the development of photocatalysts and co-catalysts.
5.3 Dye-sensitized Ru as the electron donor
A dye-sensitized photocatalyst with three electron transfer channels was constructed, in which FeOOH and the photosensitizer RuL2Cl2·2H2O were employed as the electron donor and carbon nanotubes served as the electron acceptor (Fig. 17).203 The catalytic activities of the photocatalyst were evaluated using a model photocatalytic carboxylation reaction of phenol with CO2. The photocatalytic efficiency and transient photocurrent density increased obviously when the catalytic reaction was carried out in cyclohexane compared to two electron activations in water. This suggests the formation of three electron transfer channels in the catalytic system, which was further supported by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation results.

A group of nanocrystalline ZnS materials surface-modified with ruthenium (0) was designed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C1 compounds. Formic acid and carbon monoxide were found as the major reduction products, proving solar to chemical energy conversion. The amount and ratio of products were influenced by the deposited ruthenium (0) co-catalyst and solvent polarity. The mechanism of HCOOH and CO formation involves a transient CO2·– radical generation.204
5.4 POMs as a photoreductant
Photochemical reduction of CO2 with visible light using polyoxometalates as a photoreductant. The photochemical reduction of CO2 to CO requires two electrons and two protons that are usually derived from sacrificial amine donors (which are also non-innocent in the catalytic cycle).205 Towards the realization of a water-splitting reaction as the source of electrons and protons for CO2 reduction, Haviv et al. found that a reduced acidic polyoxometalate, H5PWV2W10O40, was a photoactive electron and proton donor under visible light. Upon linking the polyoxometalate to a dirhenium molecular catalyst, a cascade of transformations occurred where the polyoxometalate was electrochemically reduced at a relatively low negative potential of 1.3 V versus Ag/AgNO3, and visible light (a 60 W tungsten lamp or a red LED) was used to transfer electrons from the polyoxometalate to the dirhenium catalyst active sites for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO.
5.5 Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger
As sulphides are prone to be self-oxidized by the photo-excited holes, usually Na2SO3 and/or Na2S will be added in the solution as a hole scavenger to maintain the stability of the catalyst. Copper(I)-based Cu2S catalysts were considered to be very promising for photocatalytic CO2 reduction in a system with Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger.206 31.04 nmol g−1 h−1 CO was produced in 90 h from the system decorated with Pt on the tips of the sample under illumination of a 30 mW cm−2 447 nm blue laser. While under broad-spectrum illumination with a Xe lamp with a cut-off water filter for the IR wavelengths, the CO formation rates were significantly higher with 39.48 nmol g−1 h−1 for the NRs randomly decorated with Pt and 3.02 μmol g−1 h−1 for the tip-decorated NRs, respectively. Besides, the competing water reduction was suppressed on this catalyst. Similarly, with Na2SO3 as the hole scavenger, the CdS/CdV2O6 composite achieved visible-light photoconversion of CO2 into CH4 with a rate of 2.816 μmol g−1 h−1.207
To summarize the above discussion, the main results are listed in Table 3.

6. Conclusions and outlook
Recent progress in visible-light photocatalytic reduction of CO2 has been discussed with emphasis on photocatalysts and processes. As shown, a series of reductants were utilized for visible light photocatalytic CO2 reduction, including H2O, H2, CH4, and TEOA, leading to the main products CO, CH4, and CH3OH with a small amount of other hydrocarbons. The exploration of efficient photocatalysts has attracted the most attention in this area.
For the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with water, various strategies were employed to develop catalysts. One of them is to extend light absorption of TiO2 from the UV to the visible light (even IR) range by doping metals and non-metals, creating oxygen vacancies, coupling co-catalysts, constructing heterostructures, and forming amine-functional groups. Furthermore, other semiconductors with smaller band gaps were also explored, such as Bi-based compounds, WO3, functionalized ZnO, SrTiO3, and others.
The development of catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 under visible light irradiation focused on the introduction of plasmonic nanoparticles (Au, Ag, etc.) into semiconductors, such as plasmonic Au-NPs on TiO2.
Various electron donors were exploited to reduce CO2 under visible light irradiation, including triethanolamine (TEOA), hydrous hydrazine, and dye-sensitized Ru. Various materials (such as MOFs, Co3O4, and Cu2S) were examined as photocatalysts for this process.
H2O is an ideal reducing agent due to its abundance, and the reaction process would just mimic the natural photosynthesis process. However, for sluggish water oxidation, even with several decades of efforts, it is still very difficult for the CO2 reduction efficiency with H2O to reach an applicable value. Therefore, new approaches and efficient photocatalysts are necessary, which would be a direction for future research.
Photocatalytic CO2 reforming of methane was mainly explored with UV light, leading to very low H2 and CO yields. Important progress has been made: Pt/black TiO2 on the light-diffuse-reflection surface of a SiO2 substrate provided a highly efficient catalyst system for visible light thermo-photocatalytic CRM, which increased H2 and CO yields by 1000 times.
More efforts are necessary for highly efficient visible light photocatalytic CO2 conversion, which would promote future research as follows:
(1) the development of efficient and cost-effective photocatalysts remains the key challenge. Various strategies can be employed to reach the target: (a) doping semiconductors with metals and non-metals, and creating oxygen vacancies with hydrogen-treatment to extend the light absorption range from UV to visible light and even IR, (b) constructing heterostructures to enhance charge–hole separation, and (c) introducing co-catalysts and forming functional groups to improve photocatalytic activity and selectivity.
(2) Hybrid strategies could be considered to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. H2 and CH4 are commonly used to react with CO2via thermal catalytic processes at a very high temperature. The introduction of photocatalysis can reduce operating temperatures for the reaction of CO2 with CH4 or H2. Therefore, the development of thermo-photo hybrid catalytic processes would be the future research direction for photo-conversion of CO2. Furthermore, photoelectrical catalytic processes, which can efficiently combine electrical and photo energies, are also promising.
(3) Little attention has been paid to the evaluation of reaction mechanisms for photocatalytic conversion of CO2. It is important to develop in situ characterization techniques, which can allow one to gain a deeper understanding of photocatalytic CO2 processes and catalyst structures under working conditions.
