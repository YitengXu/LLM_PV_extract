    , Accepted 15th October 2019First published on 17th October 2019AbstractCo-modification of an electron transport layer (ETL) with metal oxides and organic molecules can optimize the structure of the ETL and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a sandwich-structured ETL consisting of MgO/SnO2/EA was designed by co-modifying a SnO2 ETL with magnesium oxide (MgO) and ethanolamine (EA). The device with an ETL modified with MgO and EA has excellent performance in enhancing electron transport and blocking holes. It also inhibits the formation of deep defect states and improves the stability of the device. The introduction of MgO effectively improves the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the device, while EA increases the short-circuit current density (JSC). The optimal efficiency of the PSC using the ETL co-modified with MgO and EA is 20.23%, which is much higher than that of the device with the unmodified SnO2 ETL (17.94%). The method described here provides an effective way to develop high performance ETLs co-modified with metal oxides and organic compounds for perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Solar energy is the most abundant source of clean, renewable energy in the world. Solar cells convert solar energy into electricity through photovoltaic effects, which helps people use this clean renewable energy to solve energy problems. Organolead trihalide perovskite materials exhibit outstanding advantages and unique optoelectronic properties, including very broad absorption spectra (300–800 nm), extremely high molar absorptivities, simultaneous conduction of electrons and holes, and long carrier diffusion lengths.1–3 In addition, these materials can be synthesized through a very simple solution method. Therefore, as a new type of solar cell, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lead the development of advanced photovoltaic technology. In 2009, Professor Akihiro Kojima of Japan discovered the high optical absorption coefficient of CH3NH3PbI3 when he studied a sensitized solar cell, which achieved 3.81% power conversion efficiency (PCE).4 Subsequently, perovskite solar cells based on this material have been rapidly developed, reaching a PCE exceeding 24%.5
Electron transport layers (ETL) play an important role in PSCs. Their main function is to collect electrons and block holes. The most commonly used ETL materials are titanium dioxide (TiO2),4,6–12 zinc oxide (ZnO),13–17 and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).18–22 However, TiO2 ETLs have high rates of electron recombination because of low electron mobility. ZnO ETLs also have problems relating to their chemical instability. In recent years, tin oxide (SnO2) has been considered as a potential ETL in PSCs due to its high transparency and electron mobility, deep conduction and valence band, wide band gap and excellent stability.23–27 Due to the high electron mobility, SnO2 can extract photogenerated electrons from the perovskite film faster, reducing the amount of hysteresis in the SnO2-based devices.28,29 In addition, SnO2 exhibits better stability than TiO2 under ultraviolet (UV) illumination due to its wider band gap.30,31 However, similar to other ETLs, there are oxygen-vacancy-related defects on the surface of SnO2 ETLs.32,33 These vacancy defect trap states can capture electrons, blocking electron transport, and leading to severe electron–hole recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface.34 Meanwhile, thin SnO2 ETLs may not effectively passivate defects. The presence of pinholes in ETLs results in shunt pathways and direct contact between the perovskite layer and the transparent conducting oxide substrate (such as FTO or ITO), which can cause current leakage and electron–hole recombination at the interface.35 It has been shown that a single-layer SnO2 ETL cannot effectively suppress carrier recombination.
Modification of the SnO2 ETL in the PSCs can reduce the recombination of electrons and holes and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the solar cells. Zhan et al. modified the surface of a SnO2 ETL with a fullerene derivative C9 with two hydroxyl anchoring groups to effectively passivate oxygen-vacancy defects.36 Yang et al. used the complex of EDTA and SnO2 as the ETL in a PSC, which accelerated the extraction of electrons, effectively suppressed the accumulation of electrons at the interface, and thus avoided device hysteresis.37 In addition, Park et al. prepared a double-layer SnO2@a-TiO2 ETL, which has no defects in the physical contact with FTO.35 Although co-modification has been widely used in other fields,38,39 it has not been applied to SnO2 ETLs.
In this paper, a simple and effective method for preparing SnO2 ETLs co-modified with magnesium oxide (MgO) and ethanolamine (EA) was proposed. Using this approach, a MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich-layer structured ETL was prepared. The MgO increases the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the device, and the EA improves the short-circuit current density (JSC). After the co-modification of MgO and EA, both the VOC and JSC of the device are significantly improved, and the PCE of the devices improved from 17.94% to 20.23%. The improved performance is mainly attributed to the passivation of MgO, which reduces the surface roughness, minimizes the leakage current, and reduces the possibility of electron–hole recombination. At the same time, EA passivates the oxygen vacancy-related defects on the SnO2 ETL surface, enhances the electron affinity of the ETL, facilitates the growth of smooth and highly crystalline perovskite films, and improves device performance. This work provides an effective method for preparing high-performance ETLs for PSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 schematically indicates the synthesis steps to create the sandwich-like MgO/SnO2/EA ETL. A thin layer of MgO is first applied on the surface of FTO by polymer-assisted deposition (PAD), then a layer of SnO2 is spin-coated on top of the MgO layer. As a good tunneling and spintronic material, MgO has a large band gap (approximately 8 eV), which changes the interface between the FTO electrode and the SnO2 ETL, enhancing electron transport, and blocking holes.40 Meanwhile, the MgO layer inhibits perovskite penetration into the FTO surface, which minimizes current leakage and inhibits electron–hole recombination.41 Finally, a single molecular layer of EA is grown on the SnO2 surface by self-assembly in solution. The introduction of EA forms an in situ passivated SnO2 ETL, which is further enhanced by chelation to the interface with the perovskite active layer. The hydroxyl group in EA can be used as a Lewis adduct to anchor with the under-coordinated Sn atoms in SnO2, which effectively reduces the amount of oxygen vacancy defects and inhibits the formation of deep level defect states on the surface of SnO2. In addition, the terminal amino group of EA can also passivate uncoordinated Pb ions on the perovskite/SnO2 interface, reducing the number of Pb–I/Br defects. Subsequently, a perovskite (Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45) layer is deposited on the ETL using a one-step process, then spiro-OMeTAD is attached to the perovskite film by spin-coating, and lastly a gold electrode is deposited by thermal evaporation. The device structure of the planar heterojunction PSC is illustrated in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the complete device. The device consists of an FTO glass substrate, a 30 nm thick MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL layer, a 500 nm thick perovskite layer, a 200 nm thick spiro-MeOTAD layer and a 70 nm thick Au counter electrode.

Fig. 3a and b show the SEM images of single SnO2 and MgO/SnO2/EA films deposited on FTO substrates. It is generally accepted that dense, flat and pinhole-free ETLs are essential for high PSC efficiency. Defects on the surface of the ETL layer will result in electron–hole recombination, which affects the efficiency of electron transport. As can be seen from Fig. S1,† the surface of the FTO substrate is very rough, full of bumps and ravines, and no significant improvement is seen after spin-coating SnO2 (Fig. 3a). After three layers of MgO/SnO2/EA are deposited, the surface becomes much smoother (Fig. 3b). The effect of the MgO/SnO2/EA layer on the substrate surface morphology was further elucidated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S2†). AFM was tested under normal atmospheric conditions without any treatment of the sample surface. The AFM images show that the FTO substrate modified by MgO/SnO2/EA is smoother than the pure FTO substrate. Lower roughness indicates that the MgO/SnO2/EA layers fill the gaps between the FTO crystals. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of FTO with MgO/SnO2/EA is 8.8 nm, which is significantly lower than FTO/SnO2 (corresponding roughness is 11.4 nm), consistent with the SEM images. Fig. 3c and d show the SEM images of perovskite films deposited on the single SnO2 and the MgO/SnO2/EA films. It can be clearly seen that the crystal grains of the perovskite film deposited on the single SnO2 ETL are generally less than 300 nm, and the average crystal size is 152.73 nm. However, the perovskite film deposited on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL exhibited larger grains with an average grain size of 229.02 nm and a maximum particle size exceeding 500 nm. This indicates that the average crystal size of the perovskite film deposited on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL surface is larger and flatter than that deposited on the SnO2 ETL surface; the number of small sized crystals has decreased significantly, and the size distribution is wider. Fig. S3† shows the statistical analysis of the grain-size distribution of the above perovskite films, suggesting that the MgO/SnO2/EA layer can effectively promote the growth of crystal grains in the perovskite film. This is consistent with the AFM images (Fig. S2d and S2e†). After the MgO and EA modification, the coverage and smoothness of the ETL are improved, and this also promotes the growth of perovskite grains.

The interaction between SnO2 and EA was confirmed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, as illustrated in Fig. 4a. A broad absorption band (2600–3700 cm−1) can be seen in Fig. 4a, which is the characteristic frequency for the hydrogen-bonded OH− stretching vibration.42 The disappearance of the –OH absorption peak at 1380 cm−1 in the sample modified by EA compared to the unmodified sample indicates that protons from the hydroxyl group have been removed. A new peak appears at 1419 cm−1 in the EA-modified SnO2, which was attributed to the symmetric N–H umbrella band, indicating the existence of the protonated –NH3+ terminal group of the EA molecule.12 The enlarged IR spectra are shown in Fig. 4b. These changes in the IR spectra indicate that EA bonds with SnO2 through a deprotonated hydroxyl ligand.

Fig. S4† shows the relative positions of the energy bands of the MgO/SnO2/EA and single SnO2 films characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) absorption spectra. UPS and UV–Vis spectroscopy directly measures the Fermi level (EF), valence band (EVB), and the conduction band (ECB). The energy levels of perovskites and FTO have been well characterized and determined in the literature.12 According to Table S1† and the related literature, we plotted the energy level diagram of the device (Fig. 4c). All energies are referenced to the vacuum energy (0 eV). We calculated the EF of the MgO/SnO2/EA and single SnO2 films as −4.66 eV and −4.87 eV, respectively. The ECB of the MgO/SnO2/EA and single SnO2 films were calculated using Eg and EVB, resulting in values of −4.12 eV and −4.23 eV, respectively. The ECB of the MgO/SnO2/EA film is extraordinarily close in energy to that of the perovskite layer, which facilitates the extraction of photogenerated electrons from the perovskite film and transfer to the MgO/SnO2/EA film.43 In contrast, the energetic difference between the single SnO2 and perovskite films is significant. This results in a potential barrier formed during the injection of electrons into SnO2 from perovskite, leading to the accumulation of charges at the interface. We note that for the MgO/SnO2/EA and single SnO2 films, the difference between the EF and ECB are 0.54 eV and 0.64 eV, respectively. In the MgO/SnO2/EA layer, the smaller difference between EF and ECB means that the space charge limited region is reduced, which is conducive to effective electron collection.44 Meanwhile, the decrease in energy difference indicates an increased donor content in response to an increase in conductivity.12 These results show that the MgO/SnO2/EA film has a more suitable energy level matching than the single SnO2 film for PSCs.
The survey XPS spectra show the presence of Mg, N, Sn and O elements (Fig. S5a†). The largest peak from the MgO film at 49.87 eV, illustrated in Fig. 4d, is attributed to Mg 2p, which indicates that the FTO surface was successfully modified with MgO.40 The O 1s XPS spectra of MgO and MgO/SnO2/EA films are illustrated in Fig. S5b and S5c,† respectively, and can be deconvoluted into two peaks corresponding to MgO and SnO2. The MgO/SnO2/EA film showed a major N 1s peak at 400.15 eV, which is related to the protonated –NH3+ terminal group of EA molecules,12 while the MgO/SnO2 film did not have a peak in this region (Fig. 4e). This information further indicates that the SnO2 surface was successfully modified by EA. The Sn 3d XPS spectra of the MgO/SnO2 and MgO/SnO2/EA films are given in Fig. 4f, and the data show two main peaks. For the EA-modified SnO2, the photoelectron binding energy of the Sn 3d level is slightly higher than that in the unmodified SnO2, indicating the presence of an additional negative charge around the Sn atom. The hydroxyl groups at the end of the EA (considered as Lewis bases) provide additional electrons for the under-coordinated Sn caused by the broad oxygen vacancies in SnO2 and form a Lewis adduct.36 Therefore, the oxygen-vacancy-related defects on the surface of SnO2 can be effectively ameliorated by EA modification, which is consistent with the results of IR analysis.
In order to investigate the effect of MgO and EA modification on the electron transfer at the SnO2/perovskite interface, we prepared a series of planar PSCs using MgO/SnO2/EA, SnO2/EA, MgO/SnO2, and single SnO2 as the ETL layers, respectively. Fig. 5a–d show the best current density–voltage (J–V) performance characteristics for each group of PSCs. Compared with the unmodified SnO2-based device, the PSC device prepared with the MgO/SnO2 ETL has a significant improvement in VOC, increasing from 1.103 V to 1.144 V, while the JSC of the PSC device prepared with the SnO2/EA ETL increased significantly from 22.45 mA cm−2 to 23.13 mA cm−2. At the same time, the MgO and EA modified SnO2 ETL was significantly improved in both VOC and JSC, indicating that MgO promoted the increase of VOC, while EA promoted the improvement of JSC. The synergistic effect of both of these modifiers improves the efficiency of PSCs. The optimal PCE of a solar cell with the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL is 20.23%, which is much higher than the 17.94% PCE observed for the device with a single SnO2 ETL. We measured the stabilized photocurrent output of the solar cell based on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL at 0.947 V forward bias (maximum power point voltage), and obtained 19.62% steady-state PCE, which confirms the feasibility of co-modification of MgO and EA (Fig. S6†).

Fig. 6a–d show the statistical distribution of VOC, JSC, fill factor (FF), and PCE for devices based on the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL and the single SnO2 ETL. Fig. 6a shows that the devices based on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL had an average VOC of 1.139 V, which was higher than that of devices based on SnO2 ETL (1.095 V). Moreover, the devices based on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL exhibited a higher average JSC (22.78 mA cm−2), compared with the single SnO2 ETL based devices (21.86 mA cm−2). The average FF of the devices based on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL and single SnO2 ETL was also measured for comparison. The FF for the devices based on MgO/SnO2/EA ETL was 0.732, which is larger than that of the devices based on the single SnO2 ETL (0.697). The average PCE is presented in Fig. 6d and this shows that devices based on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL have a higher PCE (18.89%) than the devices based on the single SnO2 ETL (16.73%). The improvement of the solar cell performance and other photovoltaic parameters can be attributed to structural changes, such as MgO passivation which reduces surface roughness, reduces FTO surface defects, and minimizes the possibility of leakage current and electron–hole recombination. At the same time, EA passivates the oxygen vacancy-related defects on the surface of the SnO2 ETL, enhances the electron affinity of the SnO2 ETL, facilitates the growth of smooth and highly crystalline perovskite films, and improves the overall performance of the device. We also examined the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices based on the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL and single SnO2 ETL (Fig. 6f). Both devices exhibit extensive absorption in the range from 300 to 800 nm. However, the solar cells based on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL have higher photon-to-electron conversion capability in most regions than devices based the single SnO2 ETL. This indicates that the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL can promote charge collection more efficiently than the single SnO2 ETL. The mean EQE value of the devices based on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL in the visible light region is greater than 85%. The JSC value of the device based on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL calculated according to the EQE spectrum is 22.29 mA cm−2, while the corresponding value for the single SnO2 ETL device is 21.42 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the J–V measurement results (Fig. 6e). This shows that the devices based on the sandwich-like MgO/SnO2/EA ETL have better performance than the devices based on the single SnO2 ETL.

In order to further understand the charge dynamics between the perovskite and the ETL, we also characterized the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the device based on the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL and the single SnO2 ETL. Fig. 7a shows the steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films deposited on the MgO/SnO2/EA ETL and the single SnO2 ETL, respectively. Compared with the unmodified SnO2 ETL, the PL intensity of the modified MgO/SnO2/EA ETL/perovskite film was significantly reduced, which indicates that the electronic extraction and transmission from perovskite to the modified MgO/SnO2/EA ETL were effective.45 The TRPL spectra of the perovskite based on the unmodified SnO2 ETL device and the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL are illustrated in Fig. 7b. At the same time, we fitted the detailed parameters listed in Table S2.† For the unmodified SnO2 based perovskite film, the fitted fast (τ1) and slow (τ2) decay lifetimes are 9.63 ns and 28.01 ns, respectively. Herein, τ1 is related to trap-assisted recombination, and τ2 is related to free carrier recombination. With the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL based perovskite film, τ1 and τ2 were reduced to 4.26 ns and 14.32 ns, respectively.46 This indicates that the electron extraction/transport between the perovskite and the ETL interfaces is more efficient. The improvement in performance can be attributed to the reduction of the defect density between the EA modified SnO2 interface and the perovskite.

The equivalent simulated circuit used to identify the impedance data is shown in the inset image. 
It is well known that the instability of PSCs, including perovskite decomposition due to heat or moisture, is a bottleneck for practical applications. Degradation occurring at the interface and the negative effects on device parameters and long-term durability require increased attention.47 Due to the high light intensity during operation, some unnecessary photochemical processes may be occurring, and the interface degradation of the external layer of the ETL, which interacts with the external incident light, is more likely to occur.48 XRD results (Fig. 7c) show that after 12 h of light soaking in a nitrogen atmosphere, the perovskite layer on the single SnO2 has a distinct diffraction peak at 12.6°, which is characteristic of PbI2. This indicates that the perovskite layer decomposes, and is believed to be caused by photoinduced degradation catalyzed by oxidized semiconductors. For comparison, the PbI2 XRD peak of the perovskite covered on the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL is very weak, indicating that the decomposition of perovskite based on the single SnO2 ETL device is more serious than that based on the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL. The results show that SnO2 has some photocatalytic activity and can induce the decomposition of the perovskite layer. At the same time, ultraviolet irradiation accelerates the release of oxygen atoms on the surface of SnO2, resulting in the formation of oxygen vacancies and deep level defects. The EA-modified SnO2 ETL strengthens the interface bonding with the perovskite active layer by chelation. At the same time, the introduction of EA can significantly reduce the number of oxygen vacancies inside the SnO2, inhibit the formation of deep level defect states, and effectively increase the continuous illumination stability of the device. In order to further verify the stability of the devices, continuous illumination tests were performed on unpackaged devices in ambient air (20 ± 5% relative humidity, 20 ± 5 °C) and tested for 50 min at 0.9 V bias. This shows that the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL device has a stable photocurrent, the output is reduced by 14%, and the single SnO2 ETL device is reduced by 57% (Fig. S7†). Therefore, the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL architecture has significant advantages in avoiding interface degradation and improving device stability.
We also characterized the EIS of the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL device and the single SnO2 ETL device at room temperature to understand the charge transport process, recombination dynamics and contact resistance information for the PSCs. The Nyquist plots of the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL device and the single SnO2 ETL device were obtained under dark conditions with the AC amplitude set to 5 mV (Fig. 7d). The inset in Fig. 7d shows the equivalent circuit, which simulates the charge transfer and recombination processes in the PSCs. The equivalent circuit contains series resistance (Rs) and two RC elements. One of the RC elements (RH, C1) represents charge transport, and the other one is related to the chemical capacitance (CPE2) and recombination resistance (Rrec) between the interfaces.46 Meanwhile, we present the fitting parameters of the EIS measurements in Table S3,† and the resulting data are consistent with device performance. The values of Rrec for PSCs based on the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL and the single SnO2 ETL are 3.33 × 104 and 1.16 × 104 Ω cm2, respectively. Under the same bias, the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL device shows a much larger Rrec than the single SnO2 ETL device, since EA passivates the oxygen vacancies on the surface of SnO2, and the charge recombination at the electron-selective interface is largely prevented. In contrast, the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL device exhibited a lower Rs than the single SnO2 ETL device due to increased electron conductivity during MgO/EA co-modification. As a result, FF of the device based on the MgO/SnO2/EA sandwich ETL increased.
Conclusions
In summary, a sandwich-like MgO/SnO2/EA ETL with high electron transport and hole blocking performances for PSCs was fabricated by polymer-assisted MgO deposition, and self-assembly of EA in solution. The introduction of a MgO layer between FTO and SnO2 can enhance electron transport and block holes, which can effectively improve the VOC of the devices. The introduction of EA can significantly reduce the number of oxygen vacancies in SnO2 and inhibit the formation of deep defect states, effectively increasing the continuous illumination stability of the device. In addition, the terminal amino group of EA can also passivate uncoordinated Pb ions on the perovskite/SnO2 interface, reducing Pb–I/Br defects. The introduction of EA effectively increases the JSC of the device. The PCE of the PSC after modification by MgO and EA is as high as 20.23%, which is much higher than 17.94% for the unmodified devices. This work may provide an approach to develop metal oxide and organic compound co-modified ETLs as advanced electron transport layers for use in perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.

Device fabrication
FTO glasses were cleaned using ultrasonication in deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, and then were dried in an oven at 65 °C and treated with oxygen plasma for 3 min before spin-coating. In order to prepare the ETL, a mixture of ethanol and propionic acid (9:1, v/v) was used to prepare a solution of Mg(NO3)2 at a concentration of 0.045 M. Butvar® B-76 Polyvinyl butyral of the same quality as Mg(NO3)2 was added to the above solution.

For the perovskite film (Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45) preparation, a mixture of PbBr2 (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M), and FAI (1 M) was dissolved in DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v) and stirred for 12 h. Then, CsI was dissolved in DMSO and added to the above solution, followed by stirring at 60 °C for 1 h to obtain the desired triple cation composition. The perovskite film was formed in situ on the ETL layer by spin-coating the precursor solution by using a consecutive two-step process at 1500 rpm and 6000 rpm for 15 s and 30 s, respectively. CB was dripped in the last 10 seconds. Then, the perovskite film was obtained after annealing at 110 °C for 1 h. In order to prepare the hole transport layer (HTL), 70.1 mg of spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 1 mL of CB and stirred for 2 h to prepare the HTM precursor solution. Subsequently, 27.6 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 27.6 μL of cobalt(III) FK209 in acetonitrile (300 mg mL−1) and 16.8 μL of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1) were added to the HTM precursor solution and stirred for 30 min. The HTL precursor solution was then deposited on the perovskite film by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 70 nm gold electrode was deposited on top of the cell by thermal evaporation.
Characterization
The microstructure of the FTO, SnO2, MgO/SnO2/EA and perovskite films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi, SU8010). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using the PANalytical, Empyrean XRD (Cu Kα 1.5406 Å radiation), and the surface chemical composition of the MgO, MgO/SnO2 and MgO/SnO2/EA films was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (VG ESCALab 220i-XL photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi. A gas discharge lamp was used for UPS, with helium gas admitted and He I (21.22 eV) emission lines were employed. The helium pressure in the analysis chamber during analysis was about 10−4 Pa, and the data were acquired with −10 V bias. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi UH4150. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were obtained with a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. Solar cells were recorded with the 10 mV s−1 scan rate under ambient conditions without encapsulation. Light intensity was certified by using a standard Si solar cell. In all measurements, the solar cells were covered with a metal aperture mask to define the active area of 0.1 cm2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an Enlitech QE-R with a wavelength ranging from 300 to 800 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) was performed with a Hitachi F-4600 (excitation at 470 nm). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a ZAHENR PP211 electrochemical workstation, the AC amplitude was set to 5 mV, and the scanning frequency was set between 1 and 106 Hz.
