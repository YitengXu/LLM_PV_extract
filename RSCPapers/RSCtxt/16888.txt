    , Accepted 2nd September 2015First published on 2nd September 2015AbstractUniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films with high phase purity and micron-sized pinhole-free grains have been successfully synthesised on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates using a novel two-step sequential aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) process.
Introduction
Since the pioneering work by Miyasaka et al. in 2009, perovskite-structured organometal halides (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3) have attracted great attention as solid-state light absorbers for thin-film photovoltaic (PV) application due to their appropriate bandgap, high absorption coefficient, good carrier mobility and low defect density.1–6 Within a span of five years, the certified device power-conversion efficiency has increased significantly from 3.8% to 20.1%,7 and further efforts are being made to push this value toward and beyond that of crystalline silicon (25%).8 In addition to these exciting efficiency values, the preparation of large-scale organometal halide materials using a cost-effective technique is still a significant challenge for the PV industry. For example, the solution-based sol–gel spin coating process, although widely used among the research community due to its simplicity,9,10 is impossible to scale up because it is extremely difficult to obtain uniform spin-coated perovskite films over a large glass substrate. Other vapour-based techniques, such as dual-source vapour deposition,11 sequential vapour deposition,12 the vapour-assisted solution process,13 and hybrid chemical vapour deposition,14 could overcome the sample size limit but the requirement of high vacuum systems makes them much less attractive.
In this communication, we report for the first time that uniform and compact CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films can be synthesised by a facile aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition process on glass substrates. AACVD, a solution-based variant of the conventional CVD technique, involves the generation, delivery and reaction of liquid–gas aerosol containing small droplets of a precursor mixture under ambient pressure.15–17 Combining the benefits of solution and vapour based methods, AACVD is being increasingly used to fabricate high-specification semiconductor materials because it is a low-cost tunable technique, which can be either integrated into online float glass production lines or developed as an individual offline coating system.18–21 The involvement of the AACVD community in the perovskite solar cell area started in early 2014, where D. J. Lewis et al. first reported that phase-pure perovskite CH3NH3PbBr3 materials can be deposited onto glass substrates by a single-step AACVD process at a temperature of 250 °C.22 After that, CH3NH3PbI3 films were synthesised on float glass by R. Palgrave et al. under similar AACVD conditions at 200 °C.23 However, the nano-to-microscale morphology of previously reported AACVD perovskites was not studied in detail, with films appearing to have a low density on the substrates. We infer that these less densely packed perovskite coatings originate from the relatively high deposition temperature employed in the single-step process, which is required to accomplish the reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I but also often results in unfavourable gas phase nucleation and powdery deposits. Therefore, the one-step AACVD perovskite film morphology needs further modification for efficient photovoltaic performance. It is now widely accepted that the perovskite film properties including thickness, uniformity and morphology are hard to manipulate in one-step solution-based processes, since they can be significantly affected by the environment.24,25 In contrast, the two-step methodology allows for independent control of the deposition conditions of each precursor and reaction, which eventually enables better control over perovskite film formation.3
Based on the above observations, we have investigated a two-step sequential AACVD method to fabricate organometal halide perovskites on glass substrates. The schematic of this process is illustrated in Fig. 1, where a moderate deposition temperature was first employed to obtain a flat PbI2 coating followed by a higher heat input to accomplish the reaction with CH3NH3I. The resulting CH3NH3PbI3 thin films exhibit high uniformity, good phase purity and micron-sized pinhole-free grains, which have great potential to be used as light absorber layers in perovskite solar cells.

Experimental
PbI2 (99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, ≫99%) and methanol (anhydrous, 99.8%) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were used as-received. CH3NH3I was purchased from Solaronix. Deposition was carried out on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (Pilkington-NSG TEC 15, 90 mm × 45 mm × 3 mm). A solution of 0.7 g of PbI2 dissolved in 7 mL of DMF was used for PbI2 deposition, and for the subsequent CH3NH3PbI3 formation, 0.2898 g of CH3NH3I was dissolved in 7 mL of methanol. The precursor mist was created using an ultrasonic humidifier and delivered to the reaction chamber with nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 0.6 and 0.3 L min−1. Methanol was selected as the carrier solvent for methylammonium iodide instead of the widely used isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as it is extremely difficult to generate a mist from IPA. By comparison, methanol is much easier to aerosolize and CH3NH3I is very soluble in it. The deposition temperature was set at 70 °C for the first reaction and then increased to 220 °C for perovskite film formation. All the coated samples were stored in an argon-filled glove box prior to further analysis. The film crystal structure was investigated by glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with a CuKα radiation source (λ = 1.542 Å). Diffraction patterns were collected over 5–70°. The film morphology was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and elemental analysis was performed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). UV/vis absorbance measurements were conducted on a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer in the wavelength range of 300–1000 nm using FTO glass as a reference to exclude the substrate contribution in the spectrum.
Results and discussion
Fig. S1† presents the optical image of the film deposited by two-step AACVD on the FTO glass substrate, where a uniform dark coating can be clearly observed across the glass surface, indicating that a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin film may have been successfully fabricated using our sequential AACVD process. The dense area in the middle of the glass substrate (3 cm × 3 cm) was then selected for further materials characterization.
GIXRD measurement was first conducted to confirm the film crystal structure and the diffraction pattern is shown in Fig. 2. Besides a tiny signature peak at 12.60° corresponding to a low-level impurity of PbI2,13 the intense peaks at 14.04°, 28.29°, 31.80°, 40.56° and 43.07° can be assigned to the 110, 220, 310, 224 and 314 planes of a tetragonal perovskite structure, respectively. This indicates that the majority of PbI2 has been converted into CH3NH3PbI3 after exposure to CH3NH3I mist, confirming that our sequential AACVD process has successfully produced perovskite crystal materials. Although the PbI2 peak indicates that a very small quantity of the initial material was not fully converted, it has previously been demonstrated that organometal halide perovskites with a small amount of PbI2 impurities are still able to achieve high device performance.11,26,27

Film surface elemental analysis was carried out by using XPS and the spectra are presented in Fig. 3. The survey spectra of the studied sample indicate the presence of carbon, nitrogen, lead and iodide photoelectron and Auger signals. No other elements were detected in appreciable amounts. The insets in Fig. 3 display the high-resolution I 3d and Pb 4f XPS photoelectron signals. The I 3d5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 core levels appear at the binding energies of 619.5 eV and 138.8 eV, respectively, in good agreement with reported values in the literature.28,29 The I:Pb atomic ratio was found to be 2.96, which is very close to the expected value of 3.0 and also supports the above XRD observations well.

The surface morphology of the AACVD-derived CH3NH3PbI3 coating was investigated through SEM analysis. The lower-magnification SEM image in Fig. 4 shows that the perovskite film is fully covered across the studied area without any evidence of pinholes. This clearly demonstrates that our two-step AACVD process has successfully avoided the solid–gas phase reaction in those single-step depositions, leading to a significant microstructure improvement from poorly connected particles into dense continuous films. From the inset high-magnification image, the film grain size is estimated to be 1–2 μm. These large compact grains are extremely favourable for PV application because the reduced grain boundaries should help alleviate surface recombination when carriers are transported into the perovskite layer.13 Certain spherical particles are also observed on the film surface, which can be identified as unreacted PbI2 because their average I:Pb atomic ratio (2.5) estimated by EDS is lower than that of the grain interiors (2.8), as illustrated in Fig. S2.† It is worth mentioning that an appropriate amount of PbI2 species in the CH3NH3PbI3 film has been reported to improve the carrier behaviour by reducing the recombination in the grain boundaries, as well as in the interfaces between the absorber and the carrier transport layer.30 Thus, further phase purification for our perovskite sample may not be essential. The AACVD CH3NH3PbI3 film thickness was found to be ~1.5 μm from its cross-section SEM image in Fig. S3.† According to previous reports of a high-performance planar heterojunction CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell, the optimum light absorber thickness may locate at ~350 nm and the device efficiency would decrease sharply once the CH3NH3PbI3 film thickness significantly exceeds its carrier diffusion length (~100 nm).2,13,31 Further efforts to optimize the AACVD perovskite film thickness to obtain an efficient PV device are in progress.

Finally, evidence of perovskite-type CH3NH3PbI3 can also be supported by its optical characteristics. Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis absorption spectrum of our CH3NH3PbI3 sample on the FTO substrate, in which a strong absorption ranging from 400 nm to 780 nm is clearly observed. The optical bandgap of the CH3NH3PbI3 film is then determined from a Tauc plot using the (ahν)2 relation,32 as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5. The obtained direct bandgap value of 1.54 eV, estimated from the intercept by extrapolating the linear fit of the Tauc plot to the energy axis, is in good agreement with previously reported data for perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (1.48–1.54 eV).23,33,34

Conclusions
In summary, uniform compact CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films have been successfully synthesised on FTO glass substrates by a two-step sequential aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition method. This provides an important alternative to previous single-step methods, offering the potential of scalable fabrication of organometal halide perovskites with a cost-effective approach.
