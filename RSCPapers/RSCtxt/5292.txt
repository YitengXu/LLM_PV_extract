1. Introduction
‘Graphene’, a unique two-dimensional (2D) material composed of densely packed single atom thick sp2-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice, has attracted significant attention due to its exceptional properties and versatile applications.1 Although previous studies conducted on few-layer graphite had demonstrated its potential applications in various fields, the first successful isolation and discovery of single-layer graphene by reverse exfoliation of graphite was accomplished in 2004 by Geim and coworkers.2 Since then, significant endeavors in exploring the captivating properties, applications and synthesis methods of graphene have led to new research directions. Especially, the optical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties along with other attributes of graphene have resulted in increased research interest for realizing its applicability on a practical scale. It is well known that graphene exhibits high electrical conductivity, a frictionless surface, a high ambipolar electric field and quantum hall effects at room temperature. In addition, graphene is believed to be the strongest material ever known to mankind and exhibits high carrier mobility (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is quite close to the actual velocity of light.3–5 All these outstanding properties expose graphene's superiority over other materials and make it an ideal material for various applications. Hence, it is of utmost importance to further extend studies for understanding the nature and properties of graphene with the aim of perceiving its full potential for the possible development of novel state-of-the-art applications.
With the possible exception of ‘cheese’, it is well known that materials lose their value due to the perforated structure.6 However, in recent years, nanoscale perforation of 2D materials has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance and widen the applications of a material beyond its pristine form. ‘Porous Graphene’ or in other terms known as ‘Holey Graphene’ is a form of graphene with nanopores in its plane.7 This unique porous structure enables easy interaction with inorganic/organic species which has broad applications in water desalination, water treatment, environmental protection, and energy storage systems.8 Based on the sizes, porous materials are classified into three types such as microporous (2–5 nm), mesoporous (5–50 nm) and macroporous (>50 nm).9 The pore size, density, shape, and volume are the important factors that affect the performance of the material opted for any specific application. Usually, uniform pore shape/size distribution is highly demanded as it leads to enhanced properties for the target application. Based on the employed techniques for pore generation, the pore sizes can be precisely tuned in the range of micrometers to the nanometer scale. Graphene-based porous materials are classified into three categories (Fig. 1) based on the assembled architecture namely [1] holey graphene (has abundant in-plane pores generated at the basal plane of graphene using various perforation techniques. The liquid medium water/ions can easily pass through the in-plane holes), [2] 2D laminar porous graphene (interlayer pores are formed due to nano-channels. The nanochannels are formed due to the regular and periodic stacking of graphene nanosheets over each other) and [3] 3D conjugated interconnected porous structures10 (the porous structure is attained due to the formation of the random 3D interconnected network of graphene nanosheets or with composites).

Porous graphene exhibits distinct properties from its pristine form. Compared to other graphene based porous materials, porous graphene exhibits unique properties such as an increased surface area, reduced nanosheet stacking, enhanced chemical reactivity and hydrophilic nature due to the existence of functional groups at the pore edges. This will not only enhance the performance of porous graphene but also enable its applications in various fields (energy storage/conversion, catalytic and water desalination systems: high-density electrocatalytic sites, rapid ion transport, enhanced mobility, reduced charge transfer resistance, selective ionic separation, and enhanced adsorption capacities). Additionally, graphene-based porous materials exhibit various advantages over other porous materials such as [1] high mechanical strength which provides superior structural stability to the porous framework, [2] high chemical inertness which avoids contamination problems, [3] high thermal stability for unrestricted use in rigorous environments, [4] high electrical conductivity for rapid electron transport, [5] high ion diffusion and enhanced mass transport due to in-plane pores and interlayer channels between nanosheets, [6] a high surface area for ion storage and accessibility and [7] graphene derivatives such as graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide contain various oxygen functional groups which interact effectively with various organic/inorganic species, highly suitable for ion detection and filtration systems.11 Thus, it is imperative to exploit these advantages of porous graphene for various applications by fine-tuning of pore parameters through detailed optimization.
So far, as per literature reports, the majority reported that the applications of porous graphene-based materials are in electrochemical energy storage (supercapacitors)12–53 and Li-ion,4–69 Li–S,70,71 Li–air,72–77 and Na-ion batteries,78,79 energy conversion (electro-water splitting)80–90 and membrane systems (water desalination and filtration systems).91–102 2D perforated graphene (nanosheets) exhibits a high surface area with larger pore density which provides stupendous active sites for ionic charge migration and storage. This results in higher charge storage by complete insertion/deinsertion of the electrolyte ions and counteracts structural volume expansion/contraction issues when used as an electrode in energy storage systems.12,54 Moreover, perforated graphene based 2D materials act as a membrane for molecular ion separation allowing specific molecules/ions to pass through them while restricting others, thus playing a vital role in water desalination systems.101 Hence, the demand for 2D perforated electrode materials is ever rising due to a paradigm shift in energy storage and water filtration systems as they are quite efficient in resolving the existing energy and water shortage problems. In addition to energy storage and membrane separation systems, porous graphene has been widely used in other applications including dye degradation,32,103 oil/organic pollutant separation,104,105 dye-sensitized solar cells,90,106 gas sensors,107–109 hydrogen storage,110–112 methanol fuel cells,113,114 planar field emission and microwave absorption,115,116 and biological117–119 and high-temperature applications.120 Thus, porous graphene has demonstrated its potential applications in various fields and is worthy of further research.
Importantly, the well-defined pores (uniform size, shape, and density) in graphene form the basis for realizing its above successful applications. Generally, the expected pore size should be smaller than the conventional pore size of the naturally available materials. However, fabricating porous graphene with well-defined pores is still a challenge as it is quite complex and restricted due to the current technological limit.121 Hence, it is important to explore and develop novel perforation techniques of graphene because of its potential implications on an industrial scale. The existing vast amount of literature on ‘porous graphene and its applications’ reflects its importance for research and has now reached a level where the timely review is necessary to understand the current progress along with recent trends and future opportunities. Hence, in this review, an effort to serve this purpose is made. In the review, the recent advances in the state-of-the-art hole generation methods for graphene-based materials along with their working mechanisms, associated issues/solutions, and possible future are discussed. In addition, detailed insight into the properties and various applications of porous graphene-based materials including principles, design, fabrication, and engineering aspects is obtained. We aim to provide critical views on the current status, prospects and generate novel ideas for the development of porous graphene-based materials for versatile applications.
2. Overview of graphene and its derivatives
A brief overview of graphene and its derivatives is presented to gain insight into the structure and properties. In addition, the characterization techniques involved in evaluating the properties of graphene and its derivatives are discussed.
2.1 Structure and properties of graphene and its derivatives
Graphene has emerged as an important carbon-based material in various fields since its successful isolation from graphite in 2004. As mentioned before, graphene is a 2D sheet orderly packed in a honeycomb structure and is considered as the world thinnest 2D material (Fig. 2(a)). Two neighboring carbon atoms are bonded together via a carbon–carbon sigma (σ) bond with a length of 0.142 nm.122 The monolayer graphene sheets are linked together by van der waals forces and are impermeable to almost all the gases including the smallest gas helium due to the formation of a dense, delocalized cloud of π-orbitals in its aromatic rings.123 Graphene exhibits exceptional physical, structural, electrical, chemical, optical and mechanical properties. It has a high theoretical specific surface area (2630 m2 g−1), high intrinsic electron mobility (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1), high Young's modulus (around 1 TPa), high optical transmittance (97.7%), and high thermal conductivity (∼5000 W m−1 K−1) and can withstand pressure differences up to 6 atm.124,125 Additionally, graphene is also known to be the strongest material ever tested as it is 200 times stronger than steel and exhibits high chemical inertness.126 Thus, these alluring properties make graphene an excellent material for multifunctional applications. The synthesis of graphene is complicated and can be classified into two types namely ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ methods.127 Top-down methods include the arc discharge method,128 mechanical exfoliation,129 liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE),130,131 oxidation and reduction of graphene oxide132,133 and unzipping of carbon nanotubes.134,135 The top-down methods are usually associated with the breaking of graphite into nanosized graphene. These methods are highly scalable but suffer from the drawbacks of producing materials with inconsistent properties, low purity, and low yield. The bottom-up methods include chemical vapor deposition (CVD),136,137 template routes,138 substrate-free gas phase synthesis,139 total organic synthesis, and epitaxial growth.140,141 The bottom-up methods produce high-quality defect-free graphene but suffer from a major disadvantage of high cost as they involve the use of highly sophisticated operational setups and accessories. Hence, it is important to develop methods that are easy, cost-effective, efficient and scalable for graphene synthesis.

Graphene oxide (GO) is one of the most important derivatives of graphene. It is the oxidized form of graphene. GO is commonly synthesized using the well-known Brodie method, Staudenmaier method, Hofmann method, and Hummers' method (Fig. 2(b)).127 The synthesis is usually associated with the oxidation of graphite at relatively low temperatures (<100 °C) using strong acids. However, toxic chemicals pose a serious threat to human safety and the environment. Hence, the development of greener and safer routes is an urgent necessity. As a possible substitute, the modification of Hummers' method (Modified Hummers' method) is introduced as it is aimed to phase out the use of toxic chemicals, thereby protecting the environment and reducing the processing cost.142 GO is monolayer graphene coupled with various oxygen functional groups namely epoxy, hydroxyl, carbonyl, hydrolysis and carboxyl groups (Fig. 2(c)).11 These functional groups are usually attached to the basal plane and edges of GO and impart intriguing properties to GO. Generally, GO is negatively charged when dispersed in water which is attributed to the local ionization of carboxyl groups at the edges.143 Furthermore, the various oxygen functional groups interact with disorder proportions of sp3 C–O bonds resulting in the formation of nanoscale wrinkles and distortions in GO sheets, highly beneficial for molecular transport when assembled as a membrane.144,145 The functional groups on GO provide abundant active sites for ionic/molecular interaction and form strong bonds with hydrogen groups resulting in an excellent dispersibility (hydrophilic nature) in various solutions such as water, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), ethylene glycol, ethanol, etc.146,147 Besides these properties, GO offers important advantages such as [1] the functional groups act as spacers and thus prevent GO sheets from stacking and [2] the functional groups form bonds with water, gases, and ionic components thereby providing excellent permeation properties.11 However, as compared to graphene, GO suffers from a serious drawback of lower electronic conductivity and higher volume expansion when immersed in liquids. GO has a typical interlayer spacing (d-spacing) of 0.9 ± 0.1 nm which is found to increase up to 6–7 nm when soaked in water.148,149 The increased interlayer spacing of GO results in poor perforation performance (low salt rejection rate) when used as a membrane in water desalination systems. However, these drawbacks can be addressed by transforming GO into another graphene derivative known as ‘reduced graphene oxide’ (rGO).
Various physical and chemical reduction methods can be adopted to achieve this transformation. A physical reduction method such as high-temperature annealing of GO in an inert atmosphere (N2 or Ar) results in the formation of rGO. However, high-temperature annealing is costly and time-consuming and results in the generation of toxic CO2 gas.150 On the other hand, chemical-based techniques usually employ hydrazine (N2H4) for reduction at low temperatures. Hydrazine is a strong reducing agent. However, it is highly toxic and expensive and thus precludes its use for mass-scale production.151,152 As an effective alternative, a broad range of relatively less toxic reagents based on sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, borohydrides, plant extracts, amino acid, microorganisms, proteins, hormones, alkali metals, and metal acids have been used for reduction.153 With the significant advancement in graphene based technology, various cost-effective and greener techniques for reduction synthesis are expected to be developed in the near future. Reduction results in elimination/minimization of oxygen functional groups in GO with a carbon to oxygen ratio of 8:1–246:1.154 A high C/O ratio suggests the enhanced quality of rGO. rGO can be considered as an identical form of graphene as it exhibits properties similar to those of graphene.
Various factors such as vacancies, defects, functional groups, and edges are known to enhance the properties of graphene based materials.117 Recently, heteroatom doping has emerged as an effective strategy as it imparts interesting properties to graphene. Various heteroatoms such as N, P, B, As, and Cl have been doped into graphene. These heteroatoms affect the electrical, structural, mechanical, chemical and optical properties. Especially, N doping has more profound effects on improving the graphene properties. As per a density functional theory (DFT) study report,155 there are three types of N dopants namely (1) pyridinic type: a single N atom connected to 2 carbon atoms by donating one P electron to the aromatic π system, (2) pyrrolic type: a single N atom connected to 2 carbon atoms by donating two P electron to the aromatic π system and (3) quaternary type (graphitic like): a carbon atom substituted by a single N atom. An ideal N doped holey graphene (C2N) structure is shown in Fig. 3.156 Hence, N doping is found to induce profound effects in enhancing the optical properties of graphene based materials.

Graphene is a zero bandgap material. However, with N doping, its bandgap increases. The bandgap of C2N is strongly influenced by the number of stacking layers, lattice strain and the number of N atoms in graphene. The bandgap decreases with the increase in the number of stacked layers. The bandgap was found to decrease from 2.47 to 1.87 eV from a monolayer to a few layers.157 Furthermore, in the computational studies conducted by Omidvar et al.,158 it was demonstrated that as the number of N atoms in graphene (at hole defects) increases (Fig. 4), the bandgap along with the cohesive energy also increases.

First principles calculations suggest that the valence band of C2N is composed of hybridized pairs of C2S, 2P, and N2S, 2P. As N has higher electronegativity (3.04) than carbon (2.55), it triggers polarization and thus imparts ‘n-type’ conductivity to graphene.68 Additionally, the N doping enhances the Fermi level leading to higher electronic conductivity of graphene.2 The N doping greatly increases the adsorption ability of graphene owing to the hybridization of the lone pair electrons with graphene's aromatic system.60 In addition, it is concluded that the formation of monolayer C2N is more favorable than monolayer graphene as the binding energy between C2N planes is lower (−26.38 MeV per atom) than that between graphene planes (−57.53 MeV per atom).156 Furthermore, N doping in HG is easy as N atoms easily replace C atoms at hole edges. At the same time, two P electrons form lone pairs and cancel the dangling bond thereby partially stabilizing the system.155 The formation energy of C2N is lower than that of pristine graphene and thus C2N exhibits enhanced thermodynamic and mechanical stability.155 In the classical dynamics simulation study conducted by Mortazavi et al.,159 it was concluded that the mechanical properties such as the tensile strength and elastic modulus of C2N are influenced by the temperature effect. The tensile strength and elastic modulus reduce with the rise in temperature.
Other than N doping, other heteroatoms also influence the properties of graphene. Cl doping enhances conductivity, electron mobility and chemical reactivity and increases the interplanar distance between graphene nanosheets. Dopants such as P, Bi, Sb, and Au affect the electronic conductivity of graphene. P has lower electronegativity than carbon and hence it imparts ‘p-type’ conductivity and structural distortions to graphene. Bi and Sb doping reduce the n-type conductivity by shifting the Dirac point in the direction of the Fermi level of graphene while Au doping induces p-type conductivity by shifting the Dirac point into the unoccupied states in graphene.160 Thus, due to the difference in the properties of carbon and heteroatoms, doping heteroatoms can clearly endow graphene with new properties highly beneficial for multifunctional applications.
2.2 Characterization of graphene and its derivatives
Characterization is highly important as it provides useful information about the material properties. Especially for graphene and its derivatives, characterization techniques such as high-resolution transmission emission microscopy (HR-TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) have been widely used. The 2D layered structure of graphene can be visualized using the HR-TEM technique. The HR-TEM image (Fig. 5(a)) clearly indicates the highly transparent nature of few-layer graphene nanosheets. In addition, the wrinkled structure of graphene nanosheets is clearly seen. Various other features such as the nanosheet thickness, texture, defects, and crystal structure of graphene and its derivatives can be studied in detail using the HR-TEM technique.13,30,55 As a complementary technique to HR-TEM for evaluating the crystal structure, XRD is widely used. It gives detailed insight into the structure and crystallinity of the material under observation. A typical XRD pattern of graphene is shown in Fig. 5(b). The peaks at 2θ values of 26.2° and 42.3° are attributed to the (002) and (100) planes of the graphitic structure, respectively.30 Upon oxidation of graphene to GO, the characteristic peak shifts to a lower 2θ value of 9.18° indicating an increased interlayer distance from 3.34 Å (graphene) to 9.62 Å (GO). Furthermore, the reduction of GO to rGO is also confirmed by the presence of a characteristic peak at a 2θ value of 26.5°.161 Additionally, the graphitic characteristics are confirmed using the Raman technique. A typical Raman spectrum in Fig. 5(c) shows the characteristic peaks of the D-band, G-band, and 2D-band at 1362 cm−1, 1569 cm−1, and 2743 cm−1, respectively.13 The D-band corresponds to the structural defects associated with the vibrations of carbon atoms with the dangling bonds of disordered graphite (sp3 carbon atoms) while the G-band corresponds to the first-order scattering of the E2g mode of sp2 carbon atoms. The 2D-band is associated with the second-order Raman scattering. The degree of graphitization i.e. the crystallinity is determined from the ratio of relative peak intensity between the G-band and D-band. The high IG/ID ratio (3.98) indicates a high degree of graphitization.13 Usually, it is well reported that processing (oxidation/reduction) of graphene based materials results in a reduced graphitization degree due to induced defects.

The nature of chemical species and the surface chemistry of graphene based materials are determined using the XPS technique. Fig. 5(d) shows the high-resolution C 1s XPS and the survey spectrum of graphene. The peaks at 284.5, 285.4, 286.5 and 287.8 eV overtly acknowledge the existence of CC, C–C (aromatic rings of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms), C–O (alkoxy and epoxy) and CO (carbonyl) groups, respectively.14 In the case of GO, the O 1s peak is observed at 532 eV. The FTIR technique is also used to determine chemical functional groups on graphene and its derivatives. The standard CC aromatic bond of sp2 hybridized carbon domain vibrations in graphene is observed around 1610 cm−1. The hydroxide functional group due to adsorbed water species is evidenced by the existence of (O–H) vibrations around 3430 cm−1. In the case of GO, additional peaks at 1785, 1707 and 1105 cm−1 corresponding to the vibrations of CO (carbonyl and carboxylic) and C–O are observed, indicating the existence of oxygen functional groups. As for rGO, the reduction of oxygen species is associated with the complete elimination of peaks at 1785, 1707 and 1105 cm−1 and the reduced peak intensity of the hydroxide functional group (3430 cm−1).162 The specific surface area, pore size, and pore volume are determined using the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm BET technique. Recently, the methylene blue dye adsorption isotherm technique has also been used for estimating the specific surface area. The reported surface area of graphene based materials lies in the range of 300–2900 m2 g−1.27,110 The surface area and other factors (pore size and volume) totally depend on the processing parameters (physical or chemical synthesis techniques) and can be tuned precisely.
3. Strategies for hole generation in graphene based materials
The 2D structure along with holes in the basal plane imparts unique properties to graphene based materials, highly suitable for multifunctional applications. Hole generation is tricky and its parameters (pore size, density, and volume) totally depend on the methods adopted for the intended purpose. Porous graphene can be prepared using ‘chemical and physical methods’. Chemical methods such as catalyst activation,163 chemical etching,25,53 high-temperature heating,63,72 closed vessel reaction,14,106 photocatalytic oxidation,164 microbial activation,42 and hydroxyl radical attack165 and physical methods such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD),96 ion bombardment,166 reactive ion etching (RIE),115 and buffer layer lithography167 have been used for pore generation. The starting material (precursor) i.e. graphene, GO or rGO is known to affect the pore quality. Several studies have also reported the use of various carbon source materials such as biomass and various chemical compounds as starting materials for graphene synthesis and pore generation.30,37,112 In this section, methods for the rational synthesis of 2D porous graphene based materials are discussed in detail.
3.1 Green approach for the synthesis of holey graphene (HG)
Holey graphene based materials have attracted significant attention due to their outstanding properties and versatile applications. However, the synthesis of HG is associated with the high cost of starting materials (graphene, GO or rGO) and the use of toxic chemicals for further processing. Hence, it is important to explore and develop novel strategies for HG synthesis which employ cost-effective starting materials and involve minimal use of chemicals. The green synthesis approach using biomass can be looked upon as an effective strategy for HG synthesis. Biomass can be effectively used as a starting material for HG synthesis as it is cost-effective and environmentally friendly, has large natural abundance and consists of a high quantity of organic compounds with rich carbon sources.12 Such a green approach will not only produce cost-effective HG but also help in phasing out the use of toxic chemicals. Table 1 shows the green synthesis of HG with its preparation conditions.

Holey graphene (HG) has been synthesized using a green approach. In the study conducted by Panmand et al.,12 HG was synthesized using dead ‘Bougainvillea flowers’. The Bougainvillea flowers were used as a starting material as they consist of high quantities of flavonoids, glucosides, sugar, esters, terpenoids and sterides which are rich in carbon. The flowers were washed, dried and crushed into fine powder followed by annealing in an inert atmosphere (Ar) at 800 °C for 5 h (Fig. 6(a)). After annealing treatment, the flowers decomposed and converted into a mesoporous graphene structure with a high surface area (850 m2 g−1) which was further used in supercapacitor applications. The pore formation was attributed to the existence of trace amounts of ‘Ca’ and ‘Mg’ metals in the flowers which acted as ‘porogens’ or ‘catalysts’ to create holes in graphene (Fig. 6(b)). Thus, HG was successfully synthesized using a green approach in a single step.

A similar approach, except for a slight modification (external metal activation strategy), was employed by Qian et al.,48 wherein a dry rape stem was used as a starting material and subjected to an annealing treatment in an inert atmosphere (N2) at 900 °C for 2 h to form graphene. The formed graphene was further transformed into HG by hydrothermal treatment using NaOH as an activating agent. Recently, Wang et al.168 used the KOH activation strategy to synthesize HG using Plumeria rubra leaves as a starting material. The leaves were dried, crushed into powder and subjected to thermal treatment in an inert atmosphere (N2) in the temperature range from at 500–850 °C to form graphene. The formed graphene was then mixed with a KOH solution, sonicated and dried at 80 °C to form a graphene/KOH composite. The composite was heated at 500 °C for 1 h in a N2 atmosphere and then further heated at 1000 °C for 1 h to achieve synchronous carbonization and graphitization. During annealing treatment (400–600 °C), KOH initially reacted with carbon to form K2CO3. As the reaction proceeded with increasing temperature (around 700 °C), the K2CO3 decomposed into K2O and CO2. With further increasing temperature (above 700 °C), K intercalated into the carbon lattice and a large amount of CO2/CO gas along with K vapors were released resulting in rapid exfoliation and pore generation in graphene sheets. The pore density and surface area of graphene sheets can be precisely tuned by controlling the concentration ratio of KOH/graphene. Thus, alkaline metal-based activation has proved quite successful in perforating graphene nanosheets. Besides dried leaves, researchers have also used microorganisms as the starting material for HG synthesis. Long et al.14 used ‘Auricularia fungus’, a type of eukaryotic organism widely used in the food and medical industry as a carbon source. The worldwide abundance, high growth rate and rich carbon content make it an ideal microorganism for graphene synthesis. A two-step process comprising hydrothermal treatment (120 °C for 6 h) of fungus in 0.1 M KOH followed by carbonization treatment (800 °C for 1 h in N2) was adopted to produce HG (Fig. 7(a)).

The hydrothermal treatment resulted in the efficient mixing of KOH in the cellular structure of the bacteria which acted as a template to prevent adjacent cells from aggregating during carbonization treatment. Furthermore, during carbonization treatment, the KOH acted as an activating agent for the pore generation and construction of the 3D hierarchical interconnected porous network. As mentioned before, the KOH concentration is vital as it decides the morphology of HG. In the study, the KOH concentration was varied from 0–0.5 M. As seen in Fig. 7(b), the morphology changed significantly as the specific surface area increased linearly (51–1788 m2 g−1) with the increased KOH concentration (0–0.5 M). A porous microstructure with a high surface area (1788 m2 g−1) was obtained at 0.5 M. However, at this high KOH concentration, the layered structure collapsed due to high KOH activation resulting in an excess pore generation. The high surface area leads to high pore size and high pore volume generation. If such high pore size/pore volume HG nanosheets are used in electrochemical energy storage applications, the performance degrades due to lower power density.169 Hence, a trade-off between the surface area and pore size/volume is necessary. However, based on the desired application of synthesized HG, the surface area can be tuned by varying the KOH concentration.
Porous graphene nanosheets with a high surface area have been successfully synthesized by simple and cost-effective simultaneous activation-graphitization (SAG) methods from coconut shells. The SAG method is associated with the use of an activating and graphitic catalyst agent. Sun et al.13 used ZnCl2, FeCl3 and coconut shells as an activating agent, graphitic catalyst agent and carbon source, respectively, for HG synthesis. Initially, all the precursors were mixed together, heated at 80 °C for 2 h and then dried in an oven to form a composite. Then, the obtained composite was subjected to an annealing treatment at 900 °C for 1 h in an N2 atmosphere following by etching treatment in 2 M HCl for the removal of iron species. During annealing treatment, ZnCl2 decomposed into ZnO and then transformed into metallic Zn which intercalated into the carbon matrix. As the reaction continued, CO2/CO gases along with Zn vapors were released resulting in rapid exfoliation and pore generation in graphene sheets. At the same time, FeCl3 underwent decomposition to form Fe components and catalyzed the graphitization of the carbon lattice. Hence, simultaneous pore generation and graphitization were achieved. The high degree of graphitization was confirmed from the Raman spectrum (Fig. 5(c)) in which a high IG/ID ratio of 3.8 was obtained. Generally, after pore generation and annealing treatment at high temperatures, a significant number of defects are induced in the carbon framework (graphene) resulting in a lower graphitization degree. However, involving a graphitic catalyst agent can restore the structural stability and enhance the graphitization degree of the carbon framework. It is well documented that as the graphitic degree increases, the specific surface area reduces. In contrast, a high surface area of 1874 m2 g−1 was achieved due to the simultaneous introduction of activating and graphitic catalyst agents. Additionally, it was found that as the activating agent (ZnCl2)/coconut shell ratio increased (1 to 3), the specific surface area also increased (896–1874 m2 g−1). However, at a higher ratio (5), the surface area reduced (1668 m2 g−1) suggesting a detrimental effect of the activating agent. Hence, the optimum concentration of the activating agent is important to realize its positive effects.
Parshetti et al.112 used lignocellulosic fibers of oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFBs) as a starting material for HG synthesis. A two-step method comprising hydrothermal treatment followed by graphitization at high temperature (800–1000 °C) was adopted. The initial hydrothermal treatment was performed to break down the complex organic compounds into a simpler form (hydrochar) which is associated with the reduced crystallinity of cellulose and hydrolysis of lignin and hemicellulose. This resulted in the formation of a porous structure along with the attachment of functional groups which imparted highly reactive nature to the hydrochar. In the later step of thermal activation, the hydrochar underwent a condensation reaction to form graphene nanosheets which were then subjected to intense washing treatment to eliminate the volatile matter for the hole generation. Thus, the complex organic compounds in biomass through their conversion into simpler forms can be used to synthesize HG. Hence, the green synthesis approach using biomass has proved quite effective for HG synthesis. The approach is simple, reliable, and cost-effective and can be adopted on a wider scale in graphene based technology systems. As very limited literature is available on the use of biomass for HG synthesis, additional studies based on understanding the mechanism and exploring other biomass sources are necessary.
3.2 The annealing treatment approach for the synthesis of HG
HG has been synthesized using the annealing treatment approach. In this approach, the starting material (graphene, Go or rGO) is heated at an elevated temperature to achieve oxidation, exfoliation and reduction reactions for HG synthesis. Generally, annealing treatment can be classified into two types namely the rapid thermal annealing process (RTA) and normal thermal annealing process (NTA).77,120 RTA is associated with the rapid heating of the material (>100 °C min−1) at a specified temperature while NTA is associated with the heating of the material at a slower rate (5–10 °C min−1). HG can be synthesized using both approaches as the involved mechanism of hole formation is the same. The mechanism is based on gas exfoliation and subsequent hole generation. There are various functional groups attached to the defective sp3 hybridized carbon sites in graphene based materials. As the annealing treatment proceeds, these functional groups decompose and CO2 gas is liberated, which is trapped between the neighboring carbon layers. As the reaction further proceeds, a considerable amount of pressure is built up and the trapped CO2 gas escapes between the neighboring carbon layers. The rate of gas escape is significantly higher than the rate of gas generation and thus rapid exfoliation of carbon layers is attained. Also, at the same time, the high gas pressure punches holes in the weak spots of carbon layers resulting in simultaneous exfoliation and hole generation (Fig. 8(a)). It should be noted that the holes exhibit outward opening due to gas escape at high pressure (Fig. 8(b)). These protruding edges of holes are highly beneficial in avoiding the face to face restacking of carbon layers for realizing an enhanced performance in electrochemical applications. In addition to the functional groups, the intrinsic defects in graphene based materials play an important role in the hole generation. The defect sites are the structurally weakest part and hence more prone to hole generation during heat treatments. The higher the defects, the higher is the probability of hole formation. Hence, graphene based materials with high defect density should be considered as the preferred choice of starting material for hole generation.

3.2.1 The rapid thermal treatment approach for the synthesis of HG. 
The RTA process is fast and is quite effective as a high heating rate can be achieved. The high heating rate can be achieved by either heating the material at a high ramp rate using a special furnace or by inserting the material in a furnace preheated at a high temperature (Fig. 9). The defects can be naturally present in the material or can be induced externally. The starting precursors, especially GO or rGO, contain plenty of functional groups that act as potential defect sites and can be considered as an ideal starting material for HG synthesis. Various studies31,56,79,84,88 have reported the use of GO as a starting material for HG synthesis. Other materials such as graphite oxide, anthracite powder and some carbon source materials such as alanine have been reported to be used as starting materials.18,55,77 In the study conducted by Xing et al.,55 anthracite powder was used as the starting material which was first converted into GO using the graphitization-liquid oxidation method (Modified Hummers' Method) and then transformed into HG by rapid heating. Cui et al.77 used alanine (carbon and nitrogen source) along with sodium carbonate as the starting material to synthesize N-HG. During annealing treatment, the alanine decomposed into carbon fragments at high temperatures and exfoliated due to rapid gas liberation. At the same time, sodium carbonate melted and acted as a flux to enhance reaction kinetics. In addition, it also provided Na ions which acted as a catalyst etchant for pore generation. N-HG was obtained with a surface area as high as 1173 m2 g−1. The formed N-HG can be further annealed in an inert atmosphere to enhance the graphitization degree. N, S and P doped HG have been obtained by Maiti et al.,84 wherein first HG was synthesized from GO by the RTA process followed by normal annealing (750–850 °C) in NH3, H2S and triphenylphosphine to form N-HG, S-HG, and P-HG, respectively. Table 2 shows the synthesis of HG along with its preparation conditions using the RTA approach.

The ramp rate and the annealing temperature affect the pore size, microstructure and defect density of HG. The pore size, defect density, and roughness of HG nanosheets increase with an increase in the ramp rate and annealing temperature. As seen from the FESEM images in Fig. 10(a and b), clear evidence of increased pore size with increased annealing temperature (300 °C to 1100 °C) is observed. In addition, the Raman spectra (Fig. 10(c)) with an increased D/G peak intensity ratio indicate the increased defect density in the sample annealed at 1100 °C compared to the sample annealed at 300 °C. A similar effect of the increased pore size and surface roughness with an increased ramp rate (1, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 18000 °C min−1) was observed by Wu et al.56

3.2.2 The normal thermal treatment approach for the synthesis of HG. 
The synthesis of HG has also been achieved using a normal thermal treatment approach. In this approach, the starting material is heated at a slower heating rate (3–10 °C min−1) at a specific temperature for a specific time to achieve the hole generation in graphene. As mentioned before, the exfoliation and hole generation are associated with the oxidization of the non-crystalline area/defects (sp3 carbon) on the basal plane of graphene (Fig. 11(a)). The formation mechanism of HG is divided into two stages (Fig. 11(b)). In the first stage, commonly referred to as the ‘first transition threshold stage’, the holes are formed due to the gasification of ‘defective carbons’. Furthermore, if the oxidation temperature and time are increased, the second transition threshold stage occurs in which the hole sizes are significantly enhanced due to the oxidation and gasification of ‘graphitic carbons’.24 Hence, to obtain a uniform hole size distribution and restore the structural stability of HG for any specific application, the heating temperature should be higher than the oxidation temperature of defective carbons but lower than the oxidation temperature of graphitic carbons.

As per literature reports,22–24,59,63,72,74,75,120 the optimized heating conditions for the synthesis of HG using graphene as the starting material by the NTA approach have been found (heating temperature 430–500 °C and heating time around 10 h) and indicated in Table 3. Furthermore, heteroatom N doping can be performed by annealing the synthesized HG in NH3 gas in the temperature range between 500 and 900 °C.60,95 This high-temperature annealing guarantees successful heteroatom doping with increased graphitic crystallinity due to reduced functional groups. There may be an instance when the hole formation using the NTA approach is quite difficult due to the highly crystalline nature of the starting material (graphene or GO). In such a case, the crystallinity can be first reduced by introducing functional groups (defects) into the basal planes of the starting material by acid reflux treatment (HCL, H2SO4 or HNO3) and then holes can be generated using the NTA approach.63

3.3 The metal catalyst activation approach for the synthesis of HG
A metal catalyst strategy has proved quite useful in HG synthesis. This strategy is associated with the use of various metals that act as a catalyst for hole generation by means of the ‘carbothermal reduction reaction’. A carbothermal reduction reaction is associated with the oxidation of carbon atoms using a catalyst and subsequent high-pressure gas liberation resulting in rapid exfoliation and hole generation.28,50 This strategy can be used when the starting material is highly crystalline (low defect density) and no heat treatment process is competent enough to punch holes in the basal planes of graphene based materials. In this strategy, a metal catalyst is deposited on graphene based materials to create physical contact between the catalyst and graphene based materials. Once the physical contact is well established, the composite of catalyst/graphene based material is subjected to an annealing treatment at high temperatures (700–900 °C). Annealing at such temperatures results in the decomposition of the metal catalyst which further reacts with carbon atoms and oxidizes them. The oxidation process generates high-pressure gases (CO and CO2) which exfoliate and generate holes in the basal planes of graphene based materials. Finally, the metal catalyst is detached from the graphene based material using strong acid (HCl or HNO3) etching treatment. Thus, the catalytic properties of a metal are utilized to synthesize HG. Based on the required type of final product (HG or HGO/HrGO), the annealing process can be conducted in an inert atmosphere (Ar and N2) or in an open-air atmosphere. Table 4 shows the synthesis strategy of HG using a metal catalyst approach. Lin et al.163 prepared HG via controlled catalytic oxidation of Ag nanoparticles. In the study, a three-step process was adopted for the synthesis of HG nanosheets (Fig. 12).

 Fig. 12  The schematics of the three-step synthesis strategy of holey graphene using the metal catalyst approach. Reprinted with copyright permission from ref. 163. 
In the first step, silver acetate was mixed with graphene via the ball milling method and heated in an inert atmosphere (N2) at 350 °C for 1 h for the reduction of silver acetate and formation of an Ag/graphene composite. Then, in the second step, the Ag/graphene composite was heated (300 °C) in an open-air atmosphere for 1 h to accomplish the catalytic oxidation reaction. During this reaction, the Ag nanoparticles etched the graphene surface and generated pores in its basal plane. Finally, in the third step, the Ag nanoparticles were leached out from the graphene's surface by refluxing in dilute nitric acid and HG nanosheets were formed. The acid refluxing treatment resulted in the efficient removal of Ag nanoparticles as the Ag leached out in the form of AgNO3 due to the reaction with nitric acid. The Ag/C ratio is important as it strongly influences the pore size of HG. In the study, the Ag/C ratio was varied as 1 and 10 mol%. As seen in Fig. 13(a and b), uniform deposition of Ag nanoparticles over graphene sheets is clearly visible in both the cases. However, at higher Ag concentration (Ag/C: 10 mol%) (Fig. 13(b)), the Ag nanoparticle size greatly increased due to higher particle aggregation during heat treatment. After acid reflux treatment, similar large-sized holes were imprinted on the graphene sheets (Fig. 13(c and d)) Hence, it is obvious that the hole size increases with an increase in Ag concentration and can be precisely regulated through the control of an optimal Ag concentration. The Ag catalytic activity is usually recognized by hole formation accompanied by ‘track-marks’ in graphene nanosheets (Fig. 12(e and f)).

Reprinted with copyright permission from ref. 163. 
The formation of track marks can be explained on the basis of etching induced motions of Ag nanoparticles. The Ag, during annealing treatment, oxidizes the carbon atoms in contact with it and liberates high-pressure CO/CO2 gases. These gases escape through the interface of Ag nanoparticles/carbon atoms on graphene sheets thereby inducing directional motion towards Ag nanoparticles, eventually resulting in stretch mark formations. However, it is not yet clear whether the etching induced motion is solely responsible for the ‘track-marks’ formation as there may be other mechanisms at play. Hence, further detailed studies are required to shed more light on understanding the catalytic mechanism. In addition to the normal heat treatment approach for Ag catalyst activation, the rapid heat treatment approach using microwave irradiation was used by Alsharaeh et al.64 A similar three-step process was adopted in which Ag nanoparticles were first reduced on GO using hydrazine and microwave irradiation (2 min), and then refluxed (300 °C, 2 h) to induce a catalytic oxidization effect and finally etched in dilute HNO3 solution to form holes in the structure.64
KOH activation has attracted great interest as it is reported to produce HG with a relatively high surface area. Xu et al.69 synthesized HG by annealing mixed graphene and KOH powders in an inert atmosphere (Ar) at 800 °C for 1 h. As mentioned before in Section 3.1, the hole formation mechanism using the K metal catalyst is associated with the formation of K2CO3 and its decomposition into K, CO, and CO2 which results in exfoliation and hole generation. The surface area of HG depends on the concentration of KOH. In the study, as the graphene/KOH concentration increased from 1:2 to 1:8, the surface area increased from 468 to 2300 m2 g−1. The obtained high surface area was attributed to the high-density pore generation due to the increased catalytic activity at higher KOH concentration. A similar effect of an increased surface area with increased KOH concentration was demonstrated by Xia et al.28 where a high surface area of 2518 m2 g−1 was attained at a precursor (exfoliated graphite oxide/KOH) ratio of 1:5. In the study conducted by Baburin et al.110 for the synthesis of HG in hydrogen adsorption applications, HG nanosheets with a surface area as high as 2900 m2 g−1 were obtained. Furthermore, based on a simulation study, they suggested that HG nanosheets produced using the KOH activation strategy with a uniform hole size can attain a surface area as high as 5000 m2 g−1. Thus, the obtained surface area of KOH activated HG (2900 m2 g−1) is higher than the theoretical surface area of pristine graphene (2630 m2 g−1), implying its superior performance in electrochemical applications. The KOH activation method is reliable, simple, cost-effective and environmentally friendly as it does not require any post-acid refluxing treatment for leaching out K metal from graphene nanosheets. The K metal, if left any, can be easily separated by just washing with water as it readily gets dissolved in it. Using a similar KOH activation strategy, an HG/carbon sphere composite was obtained by Wu et al.50
Wang et al.27 employed ZnO nanoparticles as a catalyst agent for HG synthesis. A composite film of ZnO and GO was obtained by uniformly mixing ZnO nanoparticles and GO in water by sonication for 12 h followed by filtration using a polytetrafluorethylene membrane. The obtained composite film was then calcined at 900 °C for 4 h in a N2 atmosphere and HG was obtained which was further compressed under a 15 MPa press and used as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications (Fig. 14). Holey graphene exhibits higher compressibility than pristine graphene as the air is easily squeezed out from the in-plane holes and interlayer nanosheet stacking is easily obtained. The hole generation was attributed to the carbothermal reduction reaction by which ZnO nanoparticles etched holes in the adjacent graphene sheets and the Zn (side product) was eventually evaporated at high temperature (900 °C). Hence, the holes were directly generated and no further acid etching/cleaning treatment was required. Based on a similar carbothermal reduction mechanism, HG was obtained from a mixture of GO and Co(OH)2 by annealing treatment at 700 °C for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere.80 The Co(OH)2 decomposed into CoO which reacted with carbon through a carbothermal reaction and etched holes in graphene nanosheets. As the melting point of cobalt (1495 °C) is higher than the carbothermal reduction reaction temperature (700 °C), the Co was leached out from the graphene nanosheets using acid etching treatment in 1 M HCl. Zhang et al.57 synthesized N-HG using (NH4)6Mo7O24 MoO2 which acted as a catalyst agent and a source of nitrogen doping (Fig. 15) GO and (NH4)6Mo7O24 MoO2 were mixed together followed by drying at 100 °C to form a composite powder. Then the composite powder was pyrolyzed at 800 °C in a N2 atmosphere to form N-HG. During pyrolysis, the (NH4)6Mo7O24 MoO2 decomposed into [Mo7O24]6− ions which further decomposed into MoO2. Further by a carbothermal reduction reaction, the MoO2 transformed into Mo2C by etching carbon atoms and HG was formed.

Du et al.58 synthesized N-HG using Fe2O3 nanoparticles as a catalyst and urea as a nitrogen source using a two-step approach. In the first step, GO, FeCl3 and urea were mixed together and subjected to hydrothermal treatment (180 °C, 12 h) to form an Fe2O3–NG composite. Then in the second step, the composite was heated at 850 °C for 2 h in Ar (the Fe2O3 etched carbon atoms) and acid-etched in 8 M HCl to get rid of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. A porous morphology with a moderate surface area (487 m2 g−1) was formed. Similarly, N-HGO was obtained using Fe2O3 nanoparticles as a catalyst and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a nitrogen source using a two-step approach,52 while the Fe2O3/RHGO composite using a Prussian blue precursor66 and Fe–NHG composite using FeN and Fe3C nanoparticles obtained from the reduction of Fe(OH)3 in an ammonia atmosphere101 was obtained in a single-step approach. Thus, it is clear that HG can be synthesized using the most abundant material (Fe) and can be used in various applications. It is reported that pristine Fe nanoparticles are highly reactive and tend to etch graphene sheets into small pieces.58 In the above studies, Fe based mild etching reagents such as Fe2O3, FeN, and Fe3C nanoparticles were used for HG synthesis. Hence, it is necessary to develop and explore novel Fe based mild etching reagents for the effective synthesis of HG. Apart from the role of hole generation in graphene based materials, the metal catalyst also induces numerous functional groups (carboxyl, hydroxyl, and epoxide) into the basal plane of graphene based materials. These functional groups, with further oxidative treatment, are further transformed into defects and eventually holes are generated. Xing et al.103 synthesized HGO using a NaClO3 catalyst for inducing functional groups in graphite powder and reacted with HNO3 under normal heating conditions (300 °C, 30 min) to achieve oxidation, exfoliation and hole generation. Thus, metal catalysts by the virtue of their multiple roles play a dominant role in the synthesis of holey graphene based materials.
3.4 Chemical activation approach for the synthesis of HG
The chemical activation approach involves the use of strong oxidizing and reducing agents for the synthesis of HG and its derivatives (HGO and HRGO). Usually, the chemical activation approach is preferred when the starting materials (graphene, GO or rGO) have a significant number of defects. Defective graphene and its oxidized derivatives such as GO/rGO exhibit high defect densities of sp3 carbon and thus are more susceptible to hole formation. Hence, these materials can be considered as an ideal starting material for hole generation. Normally, chemical activation is performed by reacting a defective graphene based material with an oxidizing agent under reflux or normal heating conditions (Fig. 16).

As per literature reports,29,40,51,104 the commonly used starting material and the activating agent are GO and H2O2. GO and H2O2 are mixed together and reacted in a moderate temperature range between 80 and 100 °C. During the reaction, the oxygenated (defective) carbon atoms are oxidized and etched, leaving behind carbon vacancies which form pores. Thus, HGO is formed and is further cleaned with distilled water to discard any leftover chemical. Table 5 shows the synthesis strategy of HG using a chemical activation approach.

The H2O2 concentration is important as it can regulate the pore density in HGO. Various studies have suggested the concentration ratio of GO/H2O2 as 10:1 for an optimal pore density formation.33,46,47,52 The chemical activation reaction can be conducted using the normal heating method, microwave-based rapid heating method, and hydrothermal method. The normal heating is conducted at a lower temperature (80–100 °C) for a time period ranging between 1 and 4 h51,76,104,114 The hydrothermal method is relatively time-consuming as the reactions are conducted for a longer time span (10–12 h).29,47,52,60 Comparatively, the microwave-based heating method is rapid as the reaction can be completed in a very short period of time.82 A reaction time as short as 40 s was applied by Patel et al.82 to synthesize HGO by the microwave heating method. Furthermore, heteroatom N doping in HGO was performed by simply mixing and reacting the obtained HGO and ammonium hydroxide for a short time (10 min). Various other sources such as urea and NH3 gas have been used for N doping in HGO.47,60,87 N doping was performed by a hydrothermal reaction of HGO and urea (around 180 °C for 2–18 h) and thermal treatment of HGO in NH3 gas (around 120–1000 °C).27 Along with N, urea also provides an S source, and thus binary heteroatom doped NS-HGO was obtained.33 Doping of ternary heteroatoms such as BNP and a combined metal–heteroatom (Co–N) doping have been successfully achieved in HGO.38,81 However, the heteroatom doped HGO in the above studies was synthesized in two steps. First, pristine HGO was synthesized and then heteroatom doping in pristine HGO was achieved. The single-step synthesis of S doped HGO was reported by Chang et al.70 wherein the starting material (GO), oxidizing agent (H2O2) and S were mixed together and subjected to hydrothermal treatment. Thus, simultaneous hole generation with heteroatom doping can be achieved.
Besides H2O2, HNO3 has been used in generating holes in GO.15,49,62,87,113 The HGO synthesis procedure is quite similar except for a small difference in the reaction conditions. The mixture of GO/HNO3 is sonicated instead of heat treatment. Internment sonication (on–off–on) is suggested to be more effective than continuous sonication due to the observed higher cavitation effects.170 The sonication results in the generation of high strain and friction forces that attack the defect sites on the basal plane and breaks the carbon framework. Then, HNO3 reacts with the unsaturated carbon atoms at the damaged sites which results in detachment of carbon atoms and eventually leads to hole generation. Just like H2O2, the HNO3 concentration also influences the hole density formation in HGO. As per literature reports, the optimal concentration ratio of GO/HNO3 is between 1:5 to 1:12. Thus, HGO can be easily synthesized at room temperature with controlled hole density using the HNO3 reactant. The formed HGO can be further reduced to R-HGO or graphene by a reduction reaction. The reduction reaction is achieved by thermal treatment of HGO in an inert atmosphere (Ar or N2) or by chemical reaction using reducing agents. Table 6 shows the experimental details for the reduction of HGO. The high-temperature thermal treatment (700–900 °C) in an inert atmosphere results in the removal of functional groups in HGO by an evaporation mechanism. In the case of a chemical reaction using reducing agents, various reducing agents such as hydrazine, NaOH and ascorbic acid have been used for the reduction of HGO.41,53,105 The reaction is conducted by mixing and heating the HGO/reducing agent together at a certain temperature (80–160 °C) for some time (1–4 h). The heating is important as it increases the reaction kinetics and hence rapid reduction of functional groups is obtained. The reaction can also be conducted at room temperature but suffers from the drawback of lower reaction kinetics. The reduction degree of functional groups is based on the concentration of the reducing agent. If functional groups are partially or completely reduced, then RHGO or graphene is formed, respectively. Hence, the optimal concentration control of the reducing agent is necessary to achieve the desired degree of reduction. In addition, the toxicity of reducing agents is also an important aspect. The employed hydrazine chemical, despite being a strong reducing agent, is highly toxic and costly. Hence, as a possible replacement, various other cost-effective and environmentally friendly reducing agents should be explored.

3.5 Closed vessel reaction method for the synthesis of HG
Holey graphene has been synthesized using a closed vessel reaction approach. Closed vessel reactions are classified on the basis of the solvent used for accelerating the decomposition or reaction between precursors. When water is used as a solvent, it is known as a hydrothermal reaction and when organic/inorganic solvents are used, it is termed a solvothermal reaction. In the hydrothermal method, the water acts as both reducing and co-coordinating agents and its wider availability and non-toxic nature make it an ideal solvent.171Table 7 shows the experimental details for the synthesis of HG using a closed vessel reaction method. Yu et al.90 synthesized RHGO using a hydrothermal approach. In the study, hydrogen fluoride (HF) was used as an etching agent to develop holes in GO. Initially, GO powder and HF with water as a base solvent were mixed together and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 6 h. This resulted in the etching of defective carbon atoms on the GO basal planes, creating carbon vacancies eventually leading to pore formation. At the same time, the removal and reduction of functional groups in GO due to HF resulted in the formation of a RHGO hydrogel with a highly porous structure. Furthermore, as an extension of the work, N doping in the RHGO hydrogel by an additional hydrothermal treatment with urea (180 °C, 12 h) (Fig. 17(a)) was performed in their later study.106 Hence, it is quite clear that simultaneous reduction and hole generation in graphene based materials using a strong etchant (HF) is possible. However, the use of HF on an industrial scale is not feasible as it is toxic and regarded as a ‘highly dangerous material’. In addition, HF, due to its strong etching ability, can break graphene into smaller pieces thereby weakening its structural integrity. Hence, it important to explore safer etching routes for hole generation in graphene based materials while maintaining their structural integrity.

‘Carbon gasification’ is well known to convert solid carbon-based materials into gaseous fuels (CO and H2) through water–gas reactions with hot steam.107 The reaction of water vapor with carbon atoms can significantly weaken the interaction between the GO sheets and possibly knock out carbon atoms from the basal planes, thereby inducing defective sp3 rich carbon domains. Inspired by this, Han et al.108 generated holes in GO using the steam etching approach. In the study, GO was first deposited on a Si/SiO2 substrate by the Langmuir Blodgett (LB) technique followed by hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 20 h. During the reaction, the steam etched the defective carbon atoms on the basal plane and holes were generated. The typical water gas shift reactions using a catalyst usually occur at high temperature (>300 °C). However, in the study, the holes were generated at a relatively lower temperature (200 °C) without using any catalyst. It has been hypothesized that GO undergoes a deoxygenation reaction at 150 °C leading to reduction and hole generation in its basal planes. This hypothesis was proved by Wang et al.107 by successfully synthesizing RHGO from GO using the hydrothermal steam etching method at 150 °C for 6 h (Fig. 17(b)). Hence, the hydrothermal steam etching method can be considered as a viable option for hole generation in GO as it does not involve the use of any catalyst, etchant or high operating temperature.
Besides hydrothermal, the solvothermal method was used for producing holey graphene based materials. Zang et al.17 employed a mild solvothermal reaction method to synthesize HG using mixed solvents (water:ethylene glycol = 4:1). HG was synthesized by mixing GO in mixed solvents followed by an annealing treatment at 80 °C for 36 h. The hole generation was attributed to the presence of oxygen (O2) in solvents which acted as an oxidizing agent to etch defective sp3 carbon atoms leaving behind many holes. Furthermore, to confirm the role of oxygen in the hole generation, an additional study was conducted in a controlled system in which mixed solvents containing oxygen and Ar were separately dissolved in ethylene glycol. As seen in Fig. 18(a and b), it is clear that holes are only formed in the oxygen-containing solvent and no holes were formed in the Ar containing solvent indicating that oxygen indeed acts as an oxidizing agent in the hole generation in graphene based materials. At the same time, the ethylene glycol acted as a reducing agent to reduce the surface functional groups on the basal plane of GO. Hence, the synergistic effect of the mixed solvent (oxygen and ethylene glycol) resulted in simultaneous reduction and hole generation in GO. Apart from hole generation, the closed vessel reaction methods (hydrothermal/solvothermal), due to their simplicity and ability to produce unique 3D architectures, can be used to synthesize graphene-based composite materials for electrochemical applications. Various graphene based 3D structures (Fig. 18(c and b))17,44 and composites such as holey graphene hydrogel (HGH)16 HGO/polypyrrole hydrogel,44 HRGO/Mo2C–Mo2N16 and HGO/Ni(OH)2 (ref. 39) have been synthesized and applied in supercapacitor and electro-water splitting applications.

3.6 Other methods for the synthesis of HG
Apart from the above-discussed methods, various other methods have been adopted for the synthesis of HG. These methods include ball milling, combustion synthesis, the UV ozone oxidation method, and metal nanoparticle-mediated hydroxyl radical oxidation. We shall discuss these methods in detail to get a clear insight into the mechanism of hole generation in graphene based materials.

3.6.1 Ball milling. 
Jiang et al.54 synthesized HG from GO using a two-step approach. Initially, GO was converted into a graphene hydrogel by hydrothermal treatment (180 °C, 12 h) and mixed with KOH powder for 12 h to form a uniform mixture (KOH/graphene hydrogel). Then the mixture was subjected to ball milling using zirconia balls at 300 rpm for 30 h followed by acid etching which resulted in hole formation on the basal plane of graphene. The hole formation is attributed to the development of a significant amount of strain on the basal planes of graphene nanosheets which creates defective carbon sites for hole formation. The KOH powder acted as a medium source to transfer the impact energy of zirconia balls to the graphene's basal planes. A highly porous interconnected morphology with a high surface area of 800 m2 g−1 was formed. Various synthesis parameters such as the KOH concentration, ball milling speed and milling time affect the hole formation in graphene. The hole density and size increase with increased KOH concentration and increased ball milling speed/time. The increased hole size reduces the active surface area while the increased hole density cracks the graphene nanosheets into smaller parts due to reduced structural integrity. Hence, optimum hole density and hole size should be maintained by close control of synthesis parameters. Though ball milling is a simple and cost-effective method, it still suffers from severe drawbacks of a long processing time and inconsistent hole size formation. In addition, ball milling also breaks down graphene nanosheets into smaller fragments by impact and attrition mechanisms which is highly unsuitable for electrochemical and water desalination applications. Thus, further detailed studies are necessary to address these problems of the ball milling method for hole generation in graphene based materials.


3.6.2 Combustion method. 
The combustion method, as the name suggests, involves the combustion of precursor materials for hole generation. The combustion method is similar to the metal catalyst activation strategy except for a slight difference in the heating conditions. In this strategy, the obtained composite (metal catalyst/GO) is burnt in an open atmosphere using a normal gas burner instead of heating in a controlled closed furnace system. The burning causes the decomposition of the metal catalyst and gases (CO and CO2) are liberated due to ‘carbothermal reaction’ eventually resulting in hole formation. Li et al.97 synthesized holey GO by the combustion method using the Zn(NO3)2 catalyst (Fig. 19).
 Fig. 19  The schematic illustration of the synthesis process of holey GO by the combustion method using the ZnO catalyst. Reprinted with copyright permission from ref. 97. 
A two-step method was adopted in which a GO/Zn(NO3)2 composite was first obtained via mixing and vacuum filtration and then burned for a short time (5 min) to accomplish the carbothermal reaction. Zn(NO3)2 is decomposed into ZnO and CO/CO2 gases are generated during the carbothermal reaction. Finally, the burnt composite was acid etched to leach out the formed ZnO nanoparticles to open the blocked holes in GO. Thus, holes were successfully punched into the basal plane of the graphene based material. A similar two-step method was adopted by Dong et al.172 for synthesizing holey N doped graphene using the ZnO catalyst. As mentioned before, it is highly important to control the catalyst concentration as it affects the hole size. In the study, the hole size increased (5–45 nm) with the increased Zn(NO3)2 concentration (100–1000 g L−1). Compared to the metal catalyst method in a controlled closed furnace system, the metal catalyst combustion method is quite advantageous as it is rapid and cost-effective (does not need sophisticated furnaces). However, the use of an open flame system raises serious safety concerns.


3.6.3 Ultraviolet (UV)/ozone (O3) oxidation method. 
The UV/O3 oxidation method is applied to produce holes in graphene based materials. This method is associated with the generation of hydroxyl radicles (OH˙) due to the interaction between UV and O3. The formed (OH˙) species etch the carbon atoms and form holes in the defect edges of graphene based materials. Hu et al.21 obtained HGO using the UV/O3 oxidation method (Fig. 20). In the study, GO was dispersed in water and irradiated with a 90 W mercury lamp for 2 h under continuous ozone bubbling at an input rate of 3 g h−1 and HGO was formed.
 Fig. 20  The schematic illustration of the synthesis process of holey GO by the UV/O3 oxidation method. Redrawn from ref. 21. 
The hole formation mechanism in GO is based on the oxidative etching of carbon domains by hydroxyl radicles. During the reaction, the ozone absorbs UV light and generates (OH˙) species. These (OH˙) species attack defective sites on graphene's basal planes and generate holes. The hole generation is associated with two possible ways. [1] The (OH˙) species attack non-oxidized sp2 domains and as a result, the hybridized sp2 domains are transformed into sp3 domains along with the introduction of functional groups into the basal planes and [2] the introduced functional groups are converted into carboxyl groups which are further eliminated from the basal planes through a decarboxylation process (CO/CO2 liberation) resulting in hole formation. The oxidation reaction time affects the hole size in GO. In the study, as the irradiation time increased from 2–4 h, the hole size also increased from 3.15–8.7 nm, respectively. A similar effect of increased pore size (around 50 nm) with increased irradiation time (24 h) was observed by Guan et al.42 Other important factors such as the UV light power and O3 bubbling rate are also expected to significantly affect the hole parameters (size and density). Hence, precise control of hole parameters is possible by optimizing the preparation parameters.


3.6.4 The metal-nanoparticle mediated hydroxyl radical method. 
Similar to the UV/ozone oxidation method, the metal nanoparticle-mediated hydroxyl radical method is also used to punch holes in graphene based materials. In this method, metal nanoparticles are used to generate hydroxyl radicles (OH˙) by reacting with an oxidizing agent under visible light illumination. Radich et al.165 employed the gold nanoparticle (Au NP) mediated hydroxyl radicle approach to synthesize RHGO. In the study, RGO was mixed with Au NPs and H2O2 and irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp for 2 h to form holes in RGO. The Au NPs act as a catalyst to generate (OH˙) species and mediates the reaction between RGO and (OH˙) species. The Au N/Ps are responsible for hole formation while the (OH˙) species attack and induce functional groups on the RGO sheet. The mechanism of hole formation is illustrated in Fig. 21.
 Fig. 21  The schematic representation of the synthesis of holey graphene RGO nanosheets using the Au nanoparticle-mediated hydroxyl radical method. Reprinted with copyright permission from ref. 165. 
At the start (t = 0), before irradiation, the suspension of Au NPs, RGO and H2O2 is in equilibrium. When the light is irradiated (t1 > 0), the equilibrium is disturbed as various chemical processes come into action. These chemical processes include the photolysis of H2O2 by Au NPs, (OH˙) species generation and its attack on RGO, and decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and water. As the reaction further proceeds (t2 > t1), the Au NPs diffuse across RGO sheets and generate holes through the adsorb–desorb mechanism. Besides expensive Au NPs, other cost-effective metal nanoparticles for hole generation in graphene based materials using the metal-nanoparticle mediated hydroxyl radical approach should be explored.
Peng et al.164 employed cost-effective TiO2 nanoparticles to accomplish the hydroxyl radical approach for hole generation in RGO. Initially, a composite of TiO2/rGO was obtained using thermal reducing treatment. Then the composite was dispersed in water with continuous O2 bubbling and irradiated with UV light for 8 h to form holes in rGO. During the reaction, the TiO2 nanoparticles absorb UV light and generate electron–hole pairs. The generated holes in the valence band are accepted by the hydroxyl group (OH) and reduced by the O2 to form hydroxyl radicle species (OH˙). Thus, the produced (OH˙) species attack the defective sites (usually at the TiO2/rGO interface) and the TiO2 nanoparticles are detached resulting in hole formation in rGO. It should be noted that the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles favorably occur at the defectives sites on the graphene's basal planes. Hence, the probability of nanoparticle detachment due to the attack of hydroxyl radical species at defects sites is more. TiO2, being a wide bandgap material (3.2 eV), is only active in the UV spectrum (which comprises only 5% of the solar spectrum) and hence its activity in the visible light region (which comprises only 46% of the solar spectrum) is almost negligible. Therefore, various other materials having low bandgaps (1–2 eV) such as Cu2SnS3, SnS, SnS2, AgSnS, Cu2ZnSnS4, CdS, and PbS are used to generate (OH˙) species using the visible light spectrum thereby replacing the need for expensive UV light sources.179 It is also suggested that the use of graphene based electrode materials, especially in energy storage systems (H2/O2 fuel cells) and photocatalysis, is not encouraged.165 The generated (OH˙) species from the side reactions in these applications attack the graphene electrode thereby causing serious stability issues. Hence, graphene based materials must be used in the applications where the probability of such (OH˙) species generation is minimal or zero. Thus, chemical-based methods for hole generation in graphene based materials are rapid, simple, reproducible and cost-effective, highly suitable for commercial applications. However, the associated major drawbacks of inconsistent hole dimension generation (size, shape, and density) in chemical methods are the existing hurdles, needed to be addressed for further development.

3.7 Physical methods for the synthesis of HG
Generating holes in single layer materials using physical methods is a straightforward choice as the pore size and pore density can be precisely controlled. The physical methods are associated with the bottom-up synthesis approach where the material is fabricated from an atomic level to a bulk form. Along with the material synthesis, the hole generation in such materials using physical methods is easy, reliable and effective. The usual strategy to generate holes is ablation with a high energy electron/ion beam on the single-layer material. The high energy electron beam etches the atoms of the material under irradiation, breaks the atomic bonds and forms holes.173 In addition, a mixed strategy of combining physical and chemical methods for single-layer material synthesis and hole generation can be employed, respectively. A physical method named ‘chemical vapor deposition’ (CVD) is often used to synthesize a single-layer graphene nanosheet. In CVD, a monolayer graphene nanosheet is grown on a Cu foil substrate in a furnace by high temperature (900–1040 °C) thermal decomposition of methane (CH4) in an inert atmosphere (N2 or Ar).174 Then the formed graphene monolayer is transferred onto the target substrate by either dry or wet transfer approaches. In the dry transfer approach, the graphene nanosheet is directly transferred from the Cu foil to the intended substrate.175 However, the formation of cracks, wrinkles and folds in the graphene nanosheet during transfer is more prominent and thus considered unsuitable for scalable applications. The wet transfer approach involves the floating of a graphene nanosheet at the air–water interface and its subsequent transfer to the intended substrate. This also results in wrapping, rolling and rippling of the graphene nanosheet implying its unsuitability for industrial applications. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a defect-free transfer route of graphene nanosheets onto the targeted substrates.
A mixed strategy employing a chemical and physical method for generating holes in monolayer graphene was demonstrated by Gethers et al.176 A monolayer graphene nanosheet was synthesized by a CVD method on a Cu foil substrate and then wet transferred onto a SiO2 substrate. Then a 2 nm gold coating was deposited on graphene and heated in air at 350 °C for 15 min to form gold nanoparticles. The formed gold nanoparticles oxidized the carbon atoms in the graphene nanosheet during heat treatment through the metal catalyst activation mechanism and were leached out using KI/I2 etching solution (Fig. 22(a)). This resulted in hole formation in the graphene nanosheet. The holes were randomly distributed on the graphene nanosheets and exhibited an average size of 37 ± 8 Å (Fig. 22(b and c)). Thus, a combination of a physical method to synthesize monolayer graphene nanosheets by CVD and a chemical method to generate holes by the metal catalyst activation mechanism was successfully used.

A simple approach of generating holes in graphene nanosheets was demonstrated by Fischbein et al.177 in which suspended few-layer graphene nanosheets obtained by mechanical exfoliation were subjected to high energy electron beam etching under a TEM. The energy of the electron beam (80 keV) was quite sufficient to punch holes in the graphene nanosheets in a few seconds (Fig. 23(a)). The precise control of the beam movement and position enabled it to creates holes with various architectures such as line-type, slit-type and gaps. Holes with uniform size (3.5 nm)/distribution were formed and real-time imaging of hole generation was performed. In a similar study conducted by Lee et al.,166 focused ion beam irradiation was used to create holes in a graphene monolayer (Fig. 23(b)). The monolayer graphene was CVD deposited and transferred onto an 8 nm thin SiO2 TEM substrate. Focused Ga+ ions with an energy of 30 keV were bombarded onto the monolayer graphene which resulted in defect generation and knocking out of carbon atoms, finally resulting in hole generation. It should be noted that only a single hole is generated at the point where the beam is irradiated on the graphene nanosheet. In order to generate multiple holes, the beam needs to be irradiated at multiple places on the graphene nanosheet. 5 keV Xe+ ions were used to bombard and create multiple holes in monolayer graphene.8 The ions were bombarded at an inclined angle (75°) which resulted in the generation of multiples holes due to the reflection of ions between graphene and the underlying substrate. Hence, by maintaining the incident inclination angle and graphene substrate distance, multiple holes were generated in the graphene monolayer. Thus, electron/ion beam irradiation processes have been used to create highly localized uniform holes in graphene nanosheets. However, the process is time-consuming, tedious and costly if used for generating a large array of holes. Despite these shortcomings, the holey graphene nanosheets fabricated by these methods have been used in ionic liquid separation and thermal conductivity measurement studies.91,120

Compared to the above electron/ion beam bombardment methods, the nanolithography based etching method exhibits the unique advantage of the generation of large periodic arrays of holes with uniform size distribution. A typical nanolithography etching method consists of four common steps namely [1] deposition of graphene sheets on a substrate, [2] a template or a mask preparation to cover the surface of graphene, [3] an etching process and [4] a mask removal process to recover holey graphene nanosheets. The hole density in the graphene nanosheets depends on the porous nature of the template. The highly porous template creates high-density hole graphene nanosheets. White et al.109 fabricated holey graphene nanosheets using the nanolithography etching approach (Fig. 24(a)). In the study, graphene nanosheets deposited on Cu foil by the CVD method were first wet-transferred onto a Si chip. Then, a covalent polymer mask was deposited on the graphene nanosheet using a modified solvothermal method and was subjected to reactive ion etching (RIE). The polymer is also considered to protect the graphene from over the oxidation reaction and restore structural stability. RIE etches through the polymer and graphene using oxygen plasma which results in hole generation. Finally, the polymer was etched in ethanol solution and a holey graphene nanosheet was obtained. Thus, the exact porous structure of the polymer was imprinted on the graphene nanosheet and holes with high-density narrow size distribution were obtained. In a similar study conducted by Ghosh et al.,98 the CVD deposited graphene nanosheet was wet transferred onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and masked with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) layer. Then, the composite (PET/graphene/PMMA) was etched using swift heavy ion irradiation (SEI) to generate holes followed by etching in NaOH and acetone solution to get rid of the PMMA mask. Thus, holes with the size ranging between 1 and 10 nm were formed in the graphene/PET composite. It should be noted that it is not always necessary to use monolayer graphene nanosheets produced from CVD to generate holes. Multilayer graphene nanosheets produced from any physical or chemical method can be used. Recently, Lee et al.115 produced uniformly sized holes (500 nm) in a large periodic order by RIE in multilayer graphene nanosheets produced from the ‘vapor confined hydrothermal method’ (Fig. 24(b)).

A highly ordered ‘mesh-like’ structure in graphene nanosheets was obtained by ‘dual buffer layer lithography’ in which multiple polymer masks along with multiple etching treatments were used to imprint its porous structure on graphene nanosheets.167 A SiO2 layer was deposited on the top of the graphene nanosheet to protect it from etching treatment. On the top of the SiO2 layer, a matrix of polystyrene (PS) holding hexagonal packed PMMA was deposited. Once the composite structure (graphene/SiO2/PS/PMMA) was obtained, it was subjected to a series of etching treatments (UV, O2 RIE, and CHF3 + O2 RIE) to sequentially etch and remove each layer until the final patterned graphene layer was obtained (Fig. 25). A patterned graphene nanosheet exhibiting an area as large as 1 cm2 with uniform hole density and hole size (36.5 nm) was obtained. Thus, it is obvious that nanolithography enables the production of graphene nanosheets with highly periodic holes suitable for various applications. Physical methods for hole generation in graphene based materials are reliable as precise control of hole dimensions is achieved. However, the associated high processing costs and low yield rates are the major existing obstacles that restrict the use of physical techniques in large-scale applications. Hence, significant efforts are needed to develop hole generation techniques that are more economical and simple for wider use.

3.8 Various carbon and heteroatom sources for the synthesis of holey graphene
Besides graphene, GO, rGO and graphite oxide, various studies have reported other carbon-based starting materials for HG synthesis. These carbon based materials have been found to play multiple roles in acting as carbon and heteroatom sources. Urea has been used as a carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) source for synthesizing one-step N doped HG.117 Like urea, dicyandiamide (DCDA) has also been used as a C and N source.37 However, the toxic nature of DCDA urges to phase out its use and explore other non-toxic materials. Other materials such as pyrrole and melamine can be used as an N source.36,68 For the C source, glucose has been widely used as it is cost-effective and non-toxic.30,37,89,172 Another cost-effective carbon source such as petroleum asphalt is used. Petroleum asphalt is a byproduct of crude oil distillation and is widely available. It mostly contains plenty of aromatic hydrocarbons with a high carbon content and hence can be used as an ideal material for the C source.34 As it is well known that various organic materials (microorganisms and plants) are composed of carbon compounds, they can be considered as potential materials for the C source. Plants have gained significant importance as an effective C source due to their high abundance, negligible cost, and non-toxic nature. The vast diversity in flora life forms has encouraged to explore various plants for a potential C source. Thus, there is great scope to explore various materials that can potentially act as a C source and move a step closer to realizing greener and cost-effective strategies for the synthesis of HG.
4. Applications of HG based materials
Carbon-based nanomaterials, such as graphene, have attracted significant attention for application in electrochemical energy storage systems due to their enhanced electrical conductivity and high surface area. However, the face to face restacking of graphene nanosheets results in a reduced surface area thereby limiting access of the electrolyte ions to the active sites. This results in reduced performance of the device and restricts its integration in industrial applications. A common strategy to address the restacking problems in graphene nanosheets is introducing holes into their basal planes. The holes prevent the restacking of graphene nanosheets and provide stupendous active sites for an efficient ionic interaction. Thus, the HG nanosheets can deliver superior performance as compared to their pristine form (graphene).11 In addition, the HG nanosheets exhibit several other advantages such as easy cross-plane diffusion of ions, higher charge accumulation and the generation of additional faradaic charges due to the existence of various functional groups. All these unique characteristics enable HG nanosheets to be used as an efficient electrode material in energy storage and conversion systems.
4.1 Supercapacitor application of HG based materials
HG has been used as an active electrode material in energy storage systems such as supercapacitors and batteries. Supercapacitors have attracted great research interest due to their advantages such as safe operation, low-cost, fast charge–discharge cycles, high power density, and portability.178 Based on the mechanism of charge storage, supercapacitors are classified into two types namely pseudocapacitors and electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs).179 In pseudocapacitors, the capacitance is associated with the rapid and reversible chemical reactions on the electrode material while in EDLCs the capacitance is associated with the charge accumulation at the electrolyte–electrode interface. Graphene based electrode materials exhibit an EDLC nature for charge storage.12–14 However, the presence of various functional groups at the hole edges in HG also contributes to charge storage by faradaic reactions (pseudocapacitive).15 Thus, the existence of multiple charge storage mechanisms establishes EDLC and pseudocapacitive nature in HG based electrodes. It should be noted that the capacitance contribution from the faradaic reactions (pseudocapacitance) in HG based electrodes is low and depends on the concentration of various functional groups at the hole edges. However, the synergistic effect of the dual nature (EDLC + pseudocapacitance) of HG based electrodes results in higher capacitance and can be exploited to the fullest extent to realize their commercial applications. The typical cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge curves (GCD) of the HG electrode at varied scan rates are shown in Fig. 26(a and b). As seen, the CV and GCD curves exhibit rectangular and triangular shapes, respectively, indicating the EDLC nature of the HG electrode. The weaker redox peaks in the CV curves (around −0.9 and −0.3 V vs. SCE) are attributed to the existence of various functional groups at hole edges.

Reports have successfully demonstrated the supercapacitor application of green-route synthesized HG nanosheets using dead flower leaves and fungus as starting materials.12–14 A specific capacitance as high as 458 F g−1 with an energy density of 63.7 W h kg−1 and a long term stability of 93% for 10000 cycles was obtained by Panmand et al.12 in a three-electrode configuration. The achieved higher capacitance was attributed to the highly perforated nature of the graphene nanosheets which provided large surface area active sites and an interconnected network for rapid ion diffusion as shown in Fig. 26(c). Furthermore, Sun et al.13 and Long et al.,14 as a further extension of work, demonstrated the practical application of green-route synthesized HG electrodes by successfully fabricating symmetric supercapacitor devices. The fabricated devices exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 69 F g−1 and an energy density of 22 W h kg−1. The achieved performance can be considered satisfactory and can be further improved with detailed optimization. Thus, the demonstrated results clearly dictate that HG based supercapacitors can be fabricated using eco-friendly green-routes and used in industrial applications. Besides green-routes, chemical-route synthesized HG electrodes have been used in supercapacitor applications and their performance is tabulated in Table 8. The important aspect to be considered in the development of supercapacitive performance is the electrode fabrication process. Conventionally, the electrodes are fabricated by mixing the active material (HG) with conductive carbon and a polymer binder in a solvent to form a slurry.12–14,18,28–32 The slurry is then coated on a conductive substrate and dried to form the electrode. The formed electrode, when used in supercapacitor applications, exhibits poor performance due to the existence of the polymeric binder which forms an insulating layer over the active material leading to lower electrical conductivity. Hence, binder-free fabrication of electrode materials is necessary as it will not only enhance the electrical conductivity but also eliminate the dead weight and volume of the binder, resulting in improved performance.

The direct use of the active material or depositing the active material on a conducting substrate to form the electrode is an effective approach to realize an enhanced performance. Especially, the wet filtration method has proved quite effective in fabricating active electrode materials in the form of thin paper or membrane-like structures. Generally, a homogeneous dispersion of the active material in various solvents is filtered using the vacuum filtration technique to achieve the goal. Han et al.23 fabricated HG paper that can be directly used as an electrode for supercapacitor applications (Fig. 27). In the study, the previously formed HG nanosheets via the air oxidation method were dispersed in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) by sonication to form a homogeneous dispersion. The dispersion was then filtered to form an active material membrane that was directly used as an electrode in the supercapacitor study. A uniform and dense stacking-like morphology with high packing density (1.2 g cm−3) was obtained in HG as the solvent readily escaped between nanosheet channels and in-plane holes. In contrast, a random stacking morphology with low packing density (0.2 g cm−3) was obtained in pristine graphene as the solvent only escaped through the lateral planes between nanosheets. Although the supercapacitor devices fabricated using HG and pristine graphene electrodes exhibited similar gravimetric performance (∼50 F g−1), the HG electrode exhibited much higher volumetric capacitance (∼55 F cm−3) than the pristine graphene electrode (∼5 F cm−3) due to high packing density originating from in-plane holes. Similarly, Xu et al.20 prepared a flexible HG based paper electrode by filtering a homogeneous dispersion of HG nanosheets and obtained an excellent gravimetric (209 F g−1) and volumetric performance (234 F cm−3) with superior rate capability (157 F g−1 at 20 A g−1). The enhanced performance was attributed to the well-stacked structure of HG nanosheets which provided improved electrolyte diffusion and rapid ion transport (Fig. 28). Hence, it is quite obvious that the wet filtration method is highly effective in fabricating highly stacked structure HG nanosheets for their direct use as an electrode in supercapacitor applications.

It is a well-known fact that materials fabricated with a 3D architecture exhibit a relatively higher surface area than their 2D architecture counterpart.180 The increased surface area leads to a larger number of active sites for ionic interaction and thus results in higher capacitance. In addition, the interconnected 3D framework provides unimpeded paths for ionic transport, avoids face to face restacking of nanosheets and provides higher structural stability.11 If such 3D structured materials are directly used as an electrode in supercapacitor applications, significantly enhanced performance can be achieved. A 3D HG based electrode material can be fabricated using a simple freeze-drying method. Similar to the above-discussed method, the freeze-drying method involves rapid freezing of a homogeneous dispersion of HG based materials instead of vacuum filtration. The rapid freezing results in the formation of randomly stacked HG nanosheets with strongly interconnected networks eventually resulting in the formation of a highly porous microstructure.15,17 The obtained 3D HG electrode (3D hydrogel) due to its unique interconnected porous structure can withstand large strain deformations under compression and fully recover its volume without any structural defect.17 Such unique properties of 3D HG hydrogels enable its use in energy storage systems in a rigid mechanical environment. A maximum specific capacitance of 442 F g−1 was obtained for the HG based 3D hydrogel exhibiting a specific surface area of 569 m2 g−1.15 The capacitance of the HG based 3D hydrogel was further improved to 473 F g−1 by increasing the surface area up to 1573.2 m2 g−1 using a metal catalyst based hydrothermal method. The obtained capacitance value (473 F g−1) is the highest reported value of pristine HG based 3D electrodes and is still lower than the theoretical capacitance value of graphene (550 F g−1).
It is found that even though HG based electrodes are fabricated with a 3D structure, there still exists a tendency of nanosheet interstacking. This can be one of the reasons for reduced supercapacitive performance. However, this problem was addressed by fabricating a 3D HG based electrode with two distinct morphologies that support 3D structures and avoid the restacking of nanosheets. A combination of HG nanosheets and nanoscrolls with a 3D structure was obtained by Ferrero et al.19 using a two-step ‘rapid freezing’ and ‘lyophilization’ approach (Fig. 29). The rapid freezing of a graphene dispersion in liquid nitrogen caused the individual nanosheets to separate which avoided restacking while the lyophilization caused HG nanosheets to curl and form nanoscrolls. The formed nanostructures were self-adjusted in such a way that a stacking structure with alternate layers of HG nanosheets and nanoscrolls was formed. The nanoscrolls acted as spacers between nanosheets thereby preventing restacking between nanosheets and exposing their maximum surface area for larger ionic interaction. The symmetric supercapacitor device fabricated with this approach using a polymer gel electrolyte (PVA-H2SO4) exhibited a maximum areal capacitance of 114 mF cm−2. Thus, it is clear that fabricating HG based 3D electrodes with two distinct structures can be an effective approach to addressing the restacking problem.

The approach of depositing the active material on a conducting substrate to form an electrode is also found to be useful. In this approach, HG powder is pressed on nickel foam (NF) under high pressure (10–15 MPa).21,25,27 This causes the HG powder to be compressed in a single matrix structure and form an intimate contact with the NF substrate to be further used as an electrode. Though this approach is simple and binder-free, the electrodes fabricated using this approach exhibited mediocre performance with a specific capacitance ranging between 224 and 375 F g−1. The lower performance can be attributed to the stacking of nanosheets under high compression pressure which eventually resulted in a significantly reduced surface area and porous structure. Generally, it is well known that highly porous materials exhibit high gravimetric capacitance. However, in order to realize the practical application of any supercapacitor, it should be able to store a sizeable amount of energy in a smaller volume and thus its volumetric capacitance is considered rather than its gravimetric capacitance. Mechanical compression reduces the material volume and compacts it in a tight structure with an improved interconnected network among nanosheets. This results in maximum charge storage in a smaller volume with an enhanced rate capacity. Thus, even though a mediocre capacitance of 375 F g−1 was obtained for the compressed electrode,25 it exhibited an enhanced volumetric capacitance (439 F cm−3) with high rate capacity (229 F cm−3 at 100 A g−1), highly suitable for industrial applications. Along with volumetric capacitance, the areal capacitance is also considered as an important aspect in realizing the commercial applications of supercapacitors based on the energy stored per unit area. Usually, the areal capacitance of carbon-based electrode materials reduces when scaled to increased mass loading due to large tortuosity generated from the low surface area. Commercial carbon electrode materials have an aerial mass loading of 10 mg cm−2.181 Hence, it is necessary to study novel materials that have mass loading equivalent to or more than this benchmark to generate competitive results.22 Walsh et al.22 fabricated a HG paper disc electrode by dry pressing of HG powder in a hydraulic press (200 MPa) for 15 min (Fig. 30(a)). Supercapacitor devices with varying electrode material mass loading from 1–30 mg cm−2 were prepared and tested in an organic electrolyte (TEABF4) (Fig. 30(b and c)). All the electrodes exhibited superior results with good stability and high coulombic efficiency. A relatively high areal capacitance of 1.25 F cm−2 was achieved indicating the ability of the electrode material to restore electrochemical properties at high mass loading (30 mg cm−2) and emerge as a potential candidate for practical supercapacitor applications. As this is the only study reporting on the performance of HG based electrodes at such high mass loading (30 mg cm−2), it is quite difficult to infer the parameters that shall deliver efficient performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art electrodes. Hence, further extensive studies are needed to gain a clear insight into the parameters for enhancing the performance.

As mentioned before in Section 2.1, it is well confirmed that heteroatom doping results in improved properties which leads to enhanced electrochemical performance in graphene based materials. Especially, the properties such as improved electrical conductivity, increased hydrophilicity and structure stabilization due to heteroatom doping form the basis for improved performance in HG based materials. Thus, research studies have further extended to exploiting the improved properties of heteroatom doped HG based materials for supercapacitor applications. N doping is found to enhance the capacitance and cycling stability of HG based electrodes. An excellent 100% cycling stability was obtained for 10000 cycles for N doped HG based electrodes.35,36 In addition, the fabricated supercapacitor device for the AC line filter application exhibited an exceptionally higher capacitance of 1.25 cm−3 with a higher phase angle of −81.2° at 120 Hz. The obtained performance is almost two times higher than that of other reported carbon-based material capacitors with a phase angle exceeding −80° at 120 Hz. Dual heteroatom doping (NS) in HG based electrodes has been found to enhance capacitance by modulating space-charge layer capacitance, reducing charge-transfer resistance and enhancing wettability. The NS doped HG oxide electrode exhibited highly hydrophilic nature (contact angle zero) which not only improved the capacitance (increased ionic interaction) but also enhanced the rate capability of the electrode.34,37 A high rate capability was obtained in which the electrode restored its rectangular CV shape even at a higher scan rate (1000 mV s−1).34 In addition, the NS doped HG electrode fabricated with a 3D hydrogel structure exhibited a higher capacitance of 536 F g−1 which is quite close to the theoretical capacitance of graphene (550 F g−1).33 The N gives EDLC and S gives the pseudocapacitive contribution. Thus, the synergistic effect of heteroatoms resulted in superior performance. A similar synergistic effect of ternary heteroatom (BNP) doped HG oxide resulted in superior device performance with a specific capacitance of 350 F g−1, an energy density of 148 W h kg−1 and 90.5% stability for 50000 cycles.38 Thus, heteroatom doping in graphene based electrodes has proved very effective in improving the supercapacitor performance. The supercapacitive performance of various heteroatom doped HG based electrodes is included in Table 9.

Besides heteroatom doping, the supercapacitive performance was increased by fabricating HG based electrodes with composite materials. The composite materials along with the HG electrode take an active part in electrochemical activity by providing rich redox chemistry and a large surface area for superior ionic interaction. Thus, the collective electrochemical contribution originating from the composite electrode results in an increased supercapacitive performance.182 Various materials including Ni(OH)2, MnO2, polyaniline (PANI), Tib2O2, V2O5, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), MXenes, etc., have been used along with HG based materials as a composite electrode in supercapacitor applications.11–14,39–44 The supercapacitive performance of composite electrodes is tabulated in Table 10. A high gravimetric capacitance of 1250.3 F g−1 (ref. 39) and a high volumetric capacitance of 1445 F cm−3 (ref. 40) were obtained for the HGO/Ni(OH)2 hydrogel and HRGO/MXene (Ti3C2Tx) composite, respectively. MXenes are 2D materials with high packing density and hence they provide high volumetric capacitance. In addition, they exhibit a pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism as redox peaks are clearly visible as seen in Fig. 31(a). Hence, the combined effect of the properties of HRGO (high surface area, high electrical conductivity, rapid ionic transport, resistance-free ionic diffusion through the in-plane holes and EDLC nature) and MXenes (high surface area, high packing density, and pseudocapacitive nature) resulted in an improved performance (Fig. 31(b)). The composite materials also play an important role in avoiding the restacking of graphene nanosheets by forming a conjugated 3D porous network44,47 or acting as a ‘spacer’ between nanosheets.50 Especially, polymer composites such as polypyrrole (PPY) and polyaniline (PANI) have been used to produce 3D structures44,47 (Fig. 31(c)). However, despite the success achieved in avoiding the restacking of nanosheets, they suffered from poor cycling stability due to the ‘swelling effect’ (Fig. 31(d)).47 Wu et al.50 fabricated an HG/carbon sphere composite in which carbon spheres acted as spacers between graphene nanosheets to avoid restacking (Fig. 31(e and f)). In addition, the carbon spheres contributed to enhancing the supercapacitive performance by providing a high surface area and efficient charge-transfer paths between graphene nanosheets. Hence, the composite material strategy is useful in enhancing the supercapacitive performance of HG based electrodes and is worthy of further research. Even though the capacitive performance of HG based electrodes using composite materials (1250.6 F g−1) is well above the theoretical capacity of graphene (550 F g−1), they still suffer from a serious drawback of stability issues. Compared to HG (pristine) or heteroatom doped HG based electrodes, composite material based HG electrodes exhibit poor stability. As none of these reports have addressed this issue yet, it is imperative to conduct further studies for stability improvement.

Another important aspect to be considered in the development of supercapacitor studies is the electrical conductivity of HG based electrodes. There are plenty of oxygen-based functional groups at the hole edges which reduces the electrical conductivity. The reduced electrical conductivity translates to lower supercapacitive performance. Hence, it is necessary to eliminate these functional groups to enhance the performance. In addition, proper electrolyte selection is important. Generally, neutral electrolytes such as Na2SO4, LiClO4, and K2SO4 and basic electrolytes such as KOH and NaOH have been used in the supercapacitive studies of HG based electrodes.39,41,42,48,52 These electrolytes provide a small operating window (1 V) and hence lower energy density is attained in electrodes. In order to enhance the energy density of electrodes, ionic electrolytes such as TEABF4, EMI: TFSI and BMP-DC-A could be used as they provide a large operating window (3 V).18,22,23,50 However, the high cost of ionic electrolytes restricts their use on a commercial basis. Also, as the molecules of ionic electrolytes are much bulkier, the ionic diffusion process is sluggish and hence lower capacitance and poor rate capability are observed [8].8 Hence, cost-effective electrolytes providing a wide operational window without compromising the supercapacitive performance should be explored.
4.2 Li-ion battery application of HG based materials
Li-ion batteries have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their widespread applications in various fields including portable electronic systems, the automobile industry, etc. Especially a graphene electrode in Li-ion batteries provides high energy density, high electrical conductivity, good cycling stability, and an excellent rate capability.56 Such unique properties offered by graphene make it an ideal electrode material for Li-ion battery applications. In Li-ion batteries, the charge storage is associated with the repeated back and forth movement of Li ions between the electrodes. Graphene based materials are normally used as an anode to accommodate the Li ions during the charging process (intercalation) and release the Li ions during the discharging process (deintercalation) to be absorbed by the cathode.11 However, the nanosheet restacking problem in graphene based materials restricts the Li-ion intercalation and thus results in a significant capacity loss. In addition, the narrow interlayer spacing (0.34 nm) between graphene nanosheets lowers the Li-ion diffusion rate thereby resulting in a poor rate capacity. This is where HG based electrode materials come into play in restoring electrochemical performance by overcoming the nanosheet restacking problems.

4.2.1 Li-ion battery application of HG based materials. 
HG has been used as an electrode material in Li-ion batteries.54–56 The typical CV curves of HG with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the potential window range of 0.01–3 V are depicted in Fig. 32(a). As seen from the curves, a prominent redox peak is observed at 0.68 V in the first cathodic cycle indicating the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) during the Li intercalation process. The formation of the SEI can be considered as a boon and bane because it protects the electrode from further electrolyte decomposition on the electrode surface. However, the insulating nature of the SEI results in higher rate-capacity loss. This SEI peak vanishes in the next CV cycles which indicates the formation of a stable SEI layer after the initial cycle. A sharp drop in current density around 0 V is observed suggesting the intercalation of Li ions into the HG electrode matrix. In the anodic cycle, a broad oxidation peak around 1.2 V is associated with the de-intercalation of Li ions from the matrix of the HG electrode.55 Thus, in such a way, the charge storage/discharge processes are accomplished by the intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism in HG based electrodes. In the subsequent cycles, the CV curves nearly overlap each other indicating superior electrode stability with reversible reactions. There are various factors that affect the performance of the HG electrode. The most important factor is the surface area.55–60 As the surface area increases, the battery performance also increases due to the increased active sites of the electrode. The improved performance of the HG electrode (initial discharge capacity) from 770 mA h g−1 to 2207 mA h g−1 was observed (Fig. 32(b)) as the electrode surface area increased from 640 m2 g−1 to 800 m2 g−1. The high surface area was ascribed to the highly porous morphology which resulted in the generation of high-density active sites with rapid ionic diffusion (Fig. 32(c)). The charge transport in HG electrodes is associated with two processes namely in-plane diffusion and cross-plane diffusion.57 The interlayer spacing between graphene nanosheets promotes in-plane Li-ion diffusion while the holes in the graphene electrode promote cross-plane diffusion (Fig. 33). Thus, the synergistic effect of multiple diffusion processes not only enhances the charge storage capability but also enhances the rate capability. The Li-ion battery performance of various reported HG based electrodes is included in Table 11.

Another way to enhance the performance of HG based electrodes is heteroatom N doping. Previous studies have reported that N doping enhances the conductivity and provides structural stability to graphene electrodes. The origin of enhanced conductivity of N doped HG was explained on the basis of its increased Fermi level. In addition, it has been reported that N doping results in improved adsorption energy in graphene based electrodes57,62 (Fig. 34). This results in an improved ionic interaction with the active sites on the hole edges of the electrode and thus improved electrochemical performance can be obtained. The HG electrodes fabricated with N doping exhibited a maximum initial discharge capacity of 1444 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 with a high rate capability (713 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1). Additionally, in the study conducted by Xu et al.66 an excellent outstanding cycling stability was obtained wherein a high discharge capacity of 553.5 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 was restored after 6000 cycles.

(c) The comparison of the adsorption energy of pristine graphene and N-doped graphene, and (d) the corresponding density of the states around the Fermi level, and the Fermi energy level is set to zero (dotted line). Reprinted with copyright permission from ref. 57. 
In addition to heteroatom doping, the electrode fabrication method also affects the electrochemical performance. It has been found that the HG based electrodes fabricated using the freeze-drying method exhibit superior performance to the electrodes fabricated with the oven drying method.58 The freeze-drying produces a highly interconnected porous morphology while the oven drying leads to a reduced porous morphology due to significant stacking and aggregation of graphene nanosheets (Fig. 35(a and b)). Hence, a high surface area electrode (381 m2 g−1) was obtained in the freeze-drying method which eventually contributed to higher performance (898 mA h g−1) than the low surface area electrode (138 m2 g−1) obtained using the oven heating method (686 mA h g−1). Furthermore, the N doped HG electrode fabricated with the freeze-drying method exhibited a further improved performance with an higher initial discharge capacity of 1444 mA h g−1. Stolyarova et al.63 also demonstrated the impact of the electrode fabrication method on the electrochemical performance. In the study, the effect of ‘hot-pressing’ the HG electrode was evaluated in which a HG film was pressed at 100 bar pressure at room temperature and at 600 °C. No significant changes were observed as the obtained morphologies were identical. However, a significant improvement in the electrochemical performance was observed. The hot-pressed graphene electrode (600 °C) exhibited an enhanced performance (875 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) compared to the pressed graphene electrode at room temperature (700 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) (Fig. 35(c and d)). This enhanced performance was attributed to the hot pressing which improved the structural ordering, and bonding between the components of the HG electrode. The pressing of the electrode results in an improved stacking layer structure which contributes to rapid ion diffusivity. Hence, a higher rate capacity was obtained where the electrode restored a high discharge capacity of 92 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. In addition, the heat treatment resulted in the removal of functional groups from the hole edges eventually leading to improved electrical conductivity. Thus, collective contributions from the improved structural and electrical properties resulted in enhanced performance.

Various other graphene-derivate based electrode materials such as HGO60,61 and HRGO62,64 have also been used in Li-ion battery applications. The 3D interconnected structures of HGO (Fig. 36(a)) have demonstrated superior performance by providing high discharge capacities (1194 mA h g−1) but suffered from poor rate capabilities due to high matrix volume. On the other hand, the HRGO electrodes exhibited mediocre discharge capacities (400–423 mA h g−1) but demonstrated an excellent rate capability of 400 mA h g−1 at 100 A g−1 (Fig. 36(b)).

Various composites such as Fe3O4/HGO, MoS2/HGO and carbon/HG have also been used as electrode materials in Li-ion batteries.65,67,69 Chen et al.66 obtained a double holey heterostructure composite of Fe2O3/HRGO and used it as an electrode for Li-ion batteries (Fig. 37(a–f)). The obtained holey composite (3.1 mg cm−2) was pressed under a mechanical press (10 MPa) to form a dense structure (packing density: 1.72 g cm−3). An initial discharge capacity as high as 2318 mA h g−1 was attained at 0.2 A g−1. This also translates to a high volumetric capacity of 2621 mA h cm−3 which is the highest amongst all the reports based on HG based electrodes. A high rate capacity (500 mA h g−1 at 30 A g−1) along with high stability (96.3%) for 1600 cycles was obtained indicating the superior nature of the electrode for commercial applications (Fig. 37(g–i)). It is well known that high mass loading results in lower discharge capacity and poor rate capability. Hence, the maximum mass loading of commercial Li-ion battery electrodes is fixed around 1 mg cm−2 to obtain an effective performance. However, in the present work, the mass loading was almost three times higher and still it managed to deliver such a high performance. This outstanding performance was attributed to several factors such as [1] the double heterostructure framework provided rapid ion/electron transport, [2] the holes in the dual heterostructure framework promoted an efficient cross-plane ionic diffusion, [3] the high-density active sites at the hole edges improved the ionic interaction and [4] the synergistic effect originated from the combined properties of Fe2O3 and HRGO. Thus, employing dual holey structured materials has proved to be an effective strategy in realizing an efficient performance. The work can be further extended by utilizing various other transition metal oxides with HG based materials and possibly a further improvement in electrochemical performance can be expected. The interplanar distance between the graphene nanosheets also plays a vital role in the charge storage ability. The higher the interplanar distance, the higher will be the Li-ion intercalation and hence the higher will be the charge storage capability. The improved performance through an increased interplanar distance between graphene nanosheets was achieved by Liu et al.68 by the dual heteroatom doping approach. In the study, N–Cl doped HG was synthesized and was used as a cathode electrode in Li-ion batteries. A high discharge capacity (1200 mA h g−1) with high cycling stability (95%) for 1800 cycles was obtained. The Cl, due to its higher atomic size, increased the interplanar distance between graphene nanosheets thereby facilitating higher Li-ion accommodation while the N improved the wettability and conductivity of the electrode. Thus the collective role of doped heteroatoms resulted in improved performance. Additional studies employing various other dopants that alter the interplanar distances and enhance the intrinsic properties of graphene based electrodes should be explored.

4.2.2 Li–sulfur battery application of HG based materials. 
In recent years, lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have attracted significant research attention due to their superior performance to conventional Li-ion batteries in terms of high theoretical capacity (1600 mA h g−1) and high theoretical energy density (2500 W h kg−1).183 The higher abundance of sulfur and its low processing costs clearly justify its use on a wider scale in industrial applications. However, there are several problems that need to be addressed for realizing its industrial applicability. First, the lower electrical conductivity of sulfur and its byproducts results in poor rate capability, polarization and lower utilization of the sulfur electrode. Second, the formed lithium polysulfide ions (Li2S4) induce the ‘shuttle effect’ between the sulfur cathode and lithium anode resulting in poor electrode stability. Finally, the higher volume expansion of sulfur (almost 80%) during the intercalation process results in poor electrode structural integrity and stability issues.70 Hence, there is an urgent necessity to resolve these issues through extensive research studies. One possible strategy to overcome these problems is by making a sulfur/carbon-based material composite. Especially, 3D graphene based materials can be the preferred choice of carbon materials as they have a high surface area, high electrical conductivity, high structural stability, and high flexibility to accommodate volume changes and promote high mass (sulfur) loading. Inspired by the unique properties of 3D graphene based materials, Chang et al.70 fabricated an HG oxide/sulfur composite electrode and used it as a cathode in Li–S batteries. A highly porous interconnected morphology with a high surface area of 754 m2 g−1 was obtained. The fabricated electrode exhibited a high discharge capacity of 1134 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. In addition, the electrode exhibited a high rate capacity (472 mA h g−1 at 3C) with almost 50% cycling stability for 300 cycles at 0.2C. Such high performance of the electrode was attributed to the various properties of HG oxide such as [1] the 3D structure: it provided a high surface area which resulted in higher active site generation and compensated for volume expansion issues. [2] The holes: the holes provided unimpeded ionic transport paths for higher rate capability and [3] the functional groups: the functional groups at the hole edges trapped the polysulfide ions and restricted their flow towards the Li anode resulting in improved stability. The Li–sulfur battery performance of various reported HG based electrodes is included in Table 12.

It should be noted that even though the preliminary results on improving the cycling stability of the electrode by restricting the polysulfide ions using functional groups were effective, it still suffered from the ‘shuttle effect’. It is well known that the functional moieties exhibit finite binding sites and energy to adsorb polysulfide ions and thus result in an unimpeded transport of unabsorbed polysulfide ions to the anode. Hence, it is necessary to develop functional moieties that exhibit higher binding sites and energy to minimize the ‘shuttle effect’ by maximum adsorption of polysulfide ions. Wang et al.71 fabricated a holey Fe, N codoped HG/sulfur electrode and achieved a superior performance with a high discharge capacity of 1298 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, high rate capability (810 mA h g−1 at 5C) and high cycling stability with only 0.083% capacity decay for 300 cycles. This obtained performance was comparatively higher than that of the previously discussed above report and was attributed to the reduced ‘shuttle effect’ in the electrode due to F and N dopants. Using a DFT simulation study, it was stated that Fe and N dopants form Fe–N4 and Fe–N2 functional moieties at the hole edges. These functional moieties adsorb polysulfide species at the hole edges and restrict their flow to the anode. It is assumed that both functional moieties take an equal part in the adsorption process. However, based on first-principles calculations, it is suggested that the Fe–N2 functional moiety exhibits higher binding energy for the polysulfide species (3.01 eV) than the Fe–N4 functional moiety (2.12 eV) and hence plays a dominant in the adsorption process (Fig. 38(a and b)). Furthermore, to verify whether the polysulfide species (Li2S4) are completely reduced (adsorbed) by the electrode, an optical absorption study was conducted in which the electrode powder was dispersed in polysulfide solution for 30 min. As seen from the image in Fig. 38(c), the optical absorption peak significantly reduced with time and eventually vanished thereby confirming the complete reduction of the polysulfide species. This was also visually confirmed by observing the color change from yellow to colorless. Hence, the Fe and N dopants in HG have been found highly effective in overcoming the ‘shuttle effect’ problems in Li–S batteries. The research on the use of HG based materials as an electrode in Li–S batteries is in the primordial stage. It is necessary to establish a strong research background to understand various important aspects (mechanisms and influencing factors) by conducting further extensive studies.

4.2.3 Li–air battery application of HG based materials. 
Li–air batteries are the improvised version of conventional Li-ion batteries. Li–air batteries are recognized by their higher electrochemical performance in terms of superior discharge capacities.72,73 In Li–air batteries, the Li electrode is the anode and the air electrode is the cathode (Fig. 39(a)). The air electrode can be O2 or CO2 gas.72,74 Compared to other metals, Li metal has higher energy density (3860 mA h g−1), while the O2/CO2 gases, due to their unlimited abundance, are highly cost-effective.184 Hence, the combination of these elements as electrodes can help in realizing high electrochemical performance at lower costs. The Li–O2 battery system exhibits a high theoretical energy density of 11700 W h kg−1 which surpasses that of the conventional Li-ion batteries (<500 W h kg−1).184 Hence, Li–O2 batteries are expected to revolutionize energy storage systems in the near future. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed for advancing their successful applications on an industrial scale. The charge/discharge processes in Li–O2 batteries are associated with the reduction and decomposition of the metal–air components. The typical charge/discharge reaction proceeds as 2Li + O2 + 2e ↔Li2O2.72 During the discharge process, oxygen is reduced to lithium peroxide (Li2O2) through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and during the charging process, Li2O2 is decomposed into Li metal and O2 to be picked up by their respective electrodes.58 The OER and ORR are kinetically sluggish processes with high overpotentials which leads to electrolyte decomposition and thus results in poor cycling stability.185,186 Generally, noble materials such as Pt, Pd and RuO2 are usually used as a catalyst to increase the reaction kinetics.187 However, the higher costs of these materials restrict their practical applications. Secondly, the discharged insoluble product (Li2O2) at the cathode needs to be accommodated in high volume and should be in physical contact with the conducting surface to facilitate its further decomposition (Li and O2).188,189 Hence, to alleviate these problems, there is a need for an efficient catalyst that can accelerate the reaction kinetics and provide sufficient surface area/volume and electrical conductivity for accommodation and decomposition of the discharged product. Graphene based materials exhibit all these unique properties and thus can be effectively used as a support cathode electrode in Li–O2 batteries. The Li–air battery performance of various reported HG based electrodes is included in Table 12.

Connell et al.73 fabricated a Li–O2 battery using HG electrodes with varied mass loadings by mechanical dry pressing and successfully achieved superior performance in terms of high discharge capacity (6450 mA h g−1). Also, at a higher mass loading of 10 mg cm−2, an ultrahigh areal capacitance 40 mA h g−1 cm2 with excellent cycling stability was obtained (Fig. 39(b)). In their later work,72 a high discharge capacity of 17000 mA h g−1 with long-term cycling stability (>100 cycles) was attained for a 3D N doped HG electrode where the 3D structure provided larger volume for discharged product accommodation and N heteroatoms provided high-density catalytic sites for rapid reaction kinetics. The combined effect of the 3D architecture and N dopant resulted in improved performance. Such a combined effect of improved electrochemical performance has also been observed in graphene based composite electrodes. However, when using such graphene based composite electrodes, their stacking structure should be taken into account. Lacey et al.75 demonstrated the impact of the composite electrode stacking structure on the electrochemical performance wherein NiO/HG composite electrodes with varied stacking structures were fabricated. A randomly stacked structure by mixing equal amounts of NiO nanoparticles and HG nanosheets and a uniformly stacked structure by the sequential deposition of HG nanosheets and NiO nanoparticles (HG/HG-NiO/HG) was formed. In the electrochemical study, the uniformly stacked structure exhibited higher performance (5570 mA h g−1) than the randomly stacked structure (2840 mA h g−1) and was attributed to the systematic arrangement of the individual layers that promoted unobstructed penetration and diffusion of Li ions and O2 gas. The randomly stacked structure restricted the ion/mass transport on a sizable scale and thus resulted in lower performance. Hence, the stacking structure of composite electrodes should also be considered as the evaluating criteria for determining the performance of batteries.
In addition to Li–O2 batteries, Li–CO2 batteries have also gained increasing attention due to their higher discharge capacities. The device structure and charge storage/discharge mechanism of Li–CO2 batteries are similar to those of Li–O2 battery. The typical reaction mechanism proceeds as 4Li + 3CO2 ↔ 2Li2CO3 + C. The discharge process is associated with the formation of Li2CO3 through the ORR process and the charging process is associated with the decomposition of Li2CO3 into Li and CO2 through the OER process.74 Li2CO3 exhibits insulating nature and is deposited on the cathode at every discharge cycle. As the electrode cycling proceeds, the insulating thickness increases thereby reducing the electroactive sites on the cathode. Beyond a certain thickness, due to the complete elimination of electroactive sites, the battery suddenly dies. Hence, it is necessary to avoid insulating layer formation and restore electrochemical performance. Jin et al.74 fabricated a carbon quantum dot/HG composite electrode and succeeded in achieving outstanding performance. A high reversible discharge capacity of 12300 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with excellent stability for 235 cycles at 1 A g−1 was attained (Fig. 40(a and b)). This enhanced performance was assigned to the elimination of the insulating layer during the charging cycle by its complete decomposition due to the higher electrocatalytic activity of the carbon–graphene based composite. The obtained cycling stability outperformed that of all the reported Li–CO2 batteries signifying its use in practical systems. Thus, Li–CO2 batteries can be looked upon as the future of energy storage systems and can be potentially used in interstellar space missions, especially in Mars exploration where the atmosphere is composed of 96% CO2 gas. In addition to Li–air batteries, reports based on the use of HG based electrodes in Zn–air batteries have also emerged.76,77 The obtained initial results in terms of high energy density (495 W h kg−1) and high rate capacity (756 mA h g−1 at 20 mA cm−2) clearly indicate the reliable performance of HG based electrodes in Zn–air batteries and it is thus logical to continue research to further improve their performance. The same work can be extended in the fabrication and development of Mg–air batteries for achieving reliable performance.

4.2.4 Na-ion battery application of HG based materials. 
As an effective substitute for costly Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries have attracted higher interest due to their low cost and easy processibility.78,79 However, Na-ion batteries face a fundamental drawback, which is the higher size of Na ions. The radius of Na ions is almost 55% larger than that of Li ions (0.076 nm).68 Hence, for efficient charge storage, the electrode interlayer spacing should be large enough to promote intercalation and accommodation of Na ions. As per the literature, the expected interlayer spacing of the electrode should be above 0.370 nm for Na ion accommodation.190 If the interlayer spacing is below 0.370 nm, the Na ions face serious obstruction for intercalation/de-intercalation resulting in a significantly lower charge storage capacity. In the case of graphene based electrodes, the interlayer spacing is quite small (0.334 nm) and thus poor electrochemical performance is usually attained. The electrochemical performance can be improved by modulating the interlayer spacing using multiple approaches such as using composite nanomaterials that act as a ‘spacer’ between nanosheets, generating holes in the nanosheets and inducing functional groups at the hole edges. The Na-ion battery fabricated with the HG electrode with an interlayer spacing of 0.350 nm exhibited a moderate performance with an initial discharge capacity of 147 mA h g−1.79 However, enhanced performance with an initial discharge capacity of 365 mA h g−1 was achieved in the case of functionalized HG based electrodes (HRGO) due to an increased interlayer spacing up to 0.427 nm.78 Thus, it is quite clear that the Na-ion battery performance of the HG based electrodes is majorly dictated by their interlayer spacing. The obtained performance of the HG based electrodes for Na-ion batteries is significantly lower than the performance achieved for Li-ion batteries. Hence, the scope for further improvement exists. The Na-ion battery performance of various reported HG based electrodes is included in Table 12.

4.3 The electro-water splitting application of HG based materials
In recent years, clean energy generation has gained prime importance to address the ever-increasing problems of pollution and global warming. The electro-water splitting can be considered as a viable approach as it enables the simultaneous generation of hydrogen and oxygen gas from water.179 Hydrogen, due to its high calorific value and clean nature, can be used as a fuel while oxygen is the essential requisite for life and has applications in almost every field.191 The electro-water splitting nearly accounts for 4% of global hydrogen generation and is expected to increase further in the near future.191 In addition, the vast source of water supply can promote abundant hydrogen and oxygen generation from electro-water splitting for various applications. Hence, electro-water splitting has emerged as an important subject of research interest in the scientific community. Generally, electro-water splitting consists of three important processes namely the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The HER is a rapid process as it involves two-electron transfer reactions while the ORR and OER are kinetically sluggish processes as they involve four electron–proton reactions.192 To accelerate the process, higher energy is required to overcome the kinetic barrier and activate the electrocatalyst. However, the higher energy translates to lower catalytic efficiency and hence the materials that can lower the energy barrier are needed to realize an efficient catalytic activity. Various studies have reported the use of noble materials such as Pt, Pd RuO2 and IrO2 to achieve an efficient electrocatalytic activity in terms of enhanced reaction kinetics and lower overpotentials.193 However, the associated higher processing cost and elemental scarcity restrict their commercial applications. Hence, it is necessary to develop earth-abundant and cost-effective materials for efficient electrocatalytic activities. As these catalytic processes occur under the very influence of applied bias, the catalyst electrode properties play a vital role. The electrocatalyst should have high electrical conductivity for efficient charge transport. In addition, the electrocatalyst should have a high surface area that will expose its maximum active sites for ionic interaction. The HG material exhibits all these properties and thus led to its widespread use as an electrode material for efficient catalytic activities. The electrocatalytic performance of various reported HG based electrodes is included in Table 13.

Generally, the electrocatalytic performance of the processes such as the OER and HER is measured as the overpotential needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 which corresponds to 10% solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency for water-splitting. Any voltage exceeding the ideal water-splitting voltage (1.23 V) is determined as ‘overpotential’.194 For an efficient electrocatalytic activity, the overpotential should be as low as possible. In addition, the reaction kinetics of the electrode, which is evaluated from the ‘Tafel slope’, should be as low as possible. A 3D N doped HG electrode graphitized at 900 °C in an Ar atmosphere exhibited an OER overpotential of 460 mV (1.69 V vs. RHE) in 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 41(a)). This obtained overpotential is significantly high and can be considered inefficient as compared to the overpotentials obtained from other well-established electrode materials. The lower performance was attributed to the sluggish reaction kinetics of the electrode which was verified from the attained high Tafel slope value of 154 mV dec−1 (Fig. 41(b)).

A similar result of inefficient HER activity with a higher overpotential of 344 mV was obtained for a dual heteroatom NP doped HG electrode in a 0.5H2SO4 electrolyte. However, in the study conducted by Yan et al.86 a significant improvement in the HER activity with a lower overpotential of 157 mV and a Tafel slope of 55 mV dec−1 in a 0.5H2SO4 electrolyte was obtained by fabricating a Mo2N–Mo2C/holey reduced graphene oxide composite electrode (Fig. 42(a and b)). The enhanced performance was explained on the basis of DFT study in which Mo2N–Mo2C played a key role. Mo2N–Mo2C provided more H+ adsorption/reduction sites than the carbon in the HG nanosheet. In addition, based on the calculation of Gibbs free energy, the Mo2N–Mo2C system exhibited low free surface energy and imparted metallic character to the Mo2N–Mo2C/holey reduced graphene oxide composite (Fig. 42(c and d)). Thus, the improved electrical conductivity and higher electroactive sites provided by Mo2N–Mo2C resulted in the improved catalytic activity of the composite electrode. A similar approach can be extended to explore various other material composites for realizing an improved catalytic performance. It should be noted that even though HG based materials exhibit the essential requisites (high surface area and high electrical conductivity) of an efficient electrocatalyst, they still exhibit lower catalytic performance. It is still hard to clearly identify the factors that exactly affect the catalytic performance as the reports based on the use of HG based electrodes for the OER and HER are very scarce and none of them have addressed these issues. Hence, additional studies concerning the practical and theoretical aspects of graphene based electrodes for catalytic applications are necessary. Once the OER and HER catalytic performances are improved, the bifunctional activity (overall water splitting) of HG based electrodes can be further developed and used for industrial applications.

In addition to the OER and HER, the ORR is also an important catalytic process. The ORR process plays a key role in metal–air battery and fuel cell applications.72,113 The ORR can be a two-electron or four-electron transfer process. In the four-electron transfer process, the oxygen is reduced to water while in the two-electron transfer process, the oxygen is reduced to peroxide. In fuel cells, the four-electron transfer process is preferred as it significantly enhances cell life by preventing peroxide-induced corrosion issues.195 The HG electrode fabricated using the metal catalyst approach exhibited an ORR low onset potential of 0.78 V vs. SCE with excellent stability for 3000 cycles.80 The ORR performance further improved with N heteroatom doping and functional groups in HG based electrodes.76,82,83 The functional groups increased the ionic interaction (hydrophilicity) and provided high-density active sites for the catalytic activity. The N heteroatoms acted as electron-withdrawing groups (high electronegativity) and generated electron-deficient carbon groups (Lewis base groups). These electron-deficient carbon groups are more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by dioxygen groups leading to the O2 activation step. Thus, the synergistic effect of the N dopant and functional groups resulted in improved ORR activity.76 An enhanced catalytic activity with a lower ORR onset potential of −0.11 V vs. Ag/AgCl82 and high cycling stability of 92% for 20000 s76 were obtained. A further increment in the ORR performance (−0.08 V vs. SCE) was attained as the surface area increased due to the 3D architecture.87 The N dopant concentration and configuration play an important role in the catalytic activity. As the concentration increases, the catalytic activity increases. Also, compared to the various configurations of the N dopant at the hole edges, the pyridinic configuration is highly preferred as it endows a four-electron transfer mechanism for efficient ORR activity.84 Thus, N doping has proved quite effective in enhancing the ORR catalytic activity of HG based electrodes. It has been suggested that rather than electronegativity, the dopant spin density plays a prominent role in the activation of catalytic sites. Maiti et al.84 demonstrated that a dopant with high spin density exhibits high catalytic activity. In the study, three different heteroatom doped HG electrodes (N, S and P) were fabricated. The spin density and electronegativity were found as S > P > N and S < P < N, respectively. A high peak current density in the low potential region was obtained for the S doped HG electrode indicating its higher catalytic activity than N doped and P doped HG electrodes (Fig. 43(a–c)). In addition, the LSV curves clearly confirmed the higher catalytic activity in the sequence of S > P > N as the onset potentials were obtained as 0.07 V, 0.11 V and 0.9 V for S, P and N doped HG electrodes, respectively (Fig. 43(d)). Thus, it is clear that the spin density of the dopants plays a vital role in influencing the ORR catalytic activity.

Various electrocatalytic activities including hydrazine oxidation, methanol oxidation and amine oxidation of HG based electrodes have been accomplished.32,87–89 The 3D N doped HG electrode exhibited a low onset potential of −0.08 V vs. SCE with an excellent 90% stability for 10000 s for hydrazine oxidation.87 Such high performance was attributed to the existence of abundant edge sites at the holes, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved ionic interaction due to the N dopant and high surface area due to the 3D structure. The Pt nanoparticle loaded HG electrode used in methanol oxidation also exhibited superior performance.90 The typical CV curves of methanol oxidation shown in Fig. 44(a) clearly reveal a high forward peak (If: 8.20 mA cm−2) and reverse peak current density (Ir: 1.94 mA cm−2) for the Pt nanoparticle loaded HG electrode compared to the reference Pt nanoparticle loaded graphene electrode (If: 5.12 mA cm−2 and Ir: 1.35 mA cm−2) indicating its superior performance. In addition, the Pt loaded HG electrode exhibited excellent stability (97%) for 100 cycles (Fig. 44(b)). This enhanced performance was accounted for the synergistic effect of Pt nanoparticles and HG nanosheets wherein Pt nanoparticles actively took part in the catalytic activity of methanol oxidation and HG nanosheets provided high-density catalytic sites due to its high surface area. However, considering the high cost of Pt, alternative cost-effective materials should be explored to make the application more economical.

The electrocatalytic activity is a surface phenomenon where the material electrical and chemical properties come into play. The electrode should have high electrical conductivity and high chemical reactivity. However, in the case of HG based materials, they exhibit high electrical conductivity and low chemical reactivity due to their inert nature. Hence, to compensate for their lower chemical reactivity, various composite materials are used and efficient performance is realized. However, from the viewpoint of commercialization, the use of such composite materials results in increased added cost and complexity. Hence, more attempts are needed to develop the performance of pristine HG based materials and phase out the use of composite materials. In short, it can be stated that holey graphene and heteroatom doped holey graphene with rich defects and extensive active sites play an important role in enhancing the catalytic activities in various applications such as the oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and nitrogen reduction reaction. Hence, inducing high-density defect sites in the electrode material should be of prime importance.
4.4 The water desalination application of HG based materials
Recently membrane separation technology has gathered significant importance due to its widespread applications in various fields including water treatment, food processing, pharmaceutical and chemical industries, etc. Based on the literature reports, the majority of membrane separation technology is based on the use of polymeric membranes such as polysulfone, polyamide and cellulose.196–198 Despite the excellent performance, these polymeric membranes often suffer from poor thermal, chemical and mechanical stabilities which induces an urgent need to replace them. As an effective replacement, graphene has been acknowledged as a promising material for membrane separation technology due to its unique properties such as high thermal and chemical and mechanical stabilities accompanied by monoatomic thickness.199 However, as mentioned before, graphene in its pristine form is impermeable to almost all the gases including the smallest gas molecule of helium due to the formation of a dense, delocalized cloud of π-orbitals in its aromatic rings. This impermeability enables graphene to be used as a ‘barrier layer’ for liquids and gases or to protect various metals from oxidation.176 In order to realize its applications in molecular separation, graphene needs to be permeable which is achieved by generating nanopores/nanoholes in its basal planes. The nanoholes enable molecular separation by allowing specific sized molecules to pass through it while restricting molecules with other sizes.101 Hence, HG based materials are effectively used in membrane separation technology for water desalination applications.
Previous simulation studies have predicted that graphene membranes with well-defined subnanometer holes can act as highly selective separation membranes with efficiencies much higher than that of the currently employed state-of-the-art polymeric membranes.101 However, generating holes with well-defined sizes and density in large-area graphene sheets is a challenging task due to the current technological limit. Various perforation techniques such as focused ion beam irradiation, oxygen plasma etching, ion bombardment, and focused electron beam ablation have been proved useful in reaching this aim. The advantages and shortcomings of the techniques are summarized in Table 14. Nevertheless, the associated limitations with these techniques restrict their commercial applications and hence there is a great need to develop techniques that address these current issues. A monolayer HG nanosheet can be used as a molecule separation membrane. However, the associated high cost and complexity in the fabrication of single-layer HG nanosheets and further their defect-free transfer are major challenges.100 As a viable option, HG nanosheets are uniformly stacked over each other to form a laminar membrane. The membrane fabrication is performed using vacuum filtration, spin coating, drop-casting, and layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition techniques.200 Generally, vacuum filtration is preferably used to fabricate membranes as it produces uniformly stacked graphene nanosheets and the membrane thickness can be easily controlled by controlling the concentration of graphene in the suspension. Spin coating provides a distinctive advantage of the formation of ordered graphene nanosheets with rapid assembly. Drop casting is used to fabricate free-standing membranes but suffers from a serious drawback of poor adhesion between graphene and the substrate. LBL is used to fabricate membranes with precisely controlled thickness at the molecular level. A detailed discussion of the fabrication methods of graphene based membranes can be found elsewhere.201

The molecular separation in HG based membranes occurs at the holes and between the interlayer channels of nanosheets. A nanosheet interlayer space of 9 Å is found to be optimal for desalination applications.94 If the interlayer space is above 9 Å, it results in lower salt rejection efficiency. Hence, precise control of interlayer space is necessary. As graphene nanosheets are prone to restacking, the interlayer distance can be controlled by generating holes in their basal planes, using composite materials as spacers or by inducing functional groups. Graphene oxide contains plenty of functional groups that avoid nanosheet restacking and can be considered ideal for desalination applications. In the case of HG oxide membranes, the collective advantage of in-plane holes and interlayer spacing results in improved performance. A typical water desalination process using a HG based membrane is achieved by passing saline water under high pressure through it (Fig. 45(a)). The small-sized water molecules easily pass through the holes while the large-sized ions (Na+ and Cl−) are restricted at the hole edges and thus selective molecular separation is achieved. The molecular selectivity in HG based membranes is achieved using two phenomena namely the ‘sieving effect’ and the ‘electrostatic effect’. In the sieving effect, the solute is retained due to size exclusion, while in the electrostatic effect, the solute is retained due to electrostatic interaction with the functional groups at the hole edges (Fig. 45(b)).

The membrane size plays an important role in influencing water desalination performance. The Hagen–Poiseuille equation predicts that as the membrane thickness reduces, the flux density increases.199 Hence, the membrane thickness should be as low as possible. In addition, the membrane hole size also plays a dominant role. For efficient molecular separation, the membrane should have high-density pores with uniform size distribution. Surwade et al.202 obtained 100% salt rejection with high flux density (106) for a monolayer graphene nanosheet with high-density uniform hole size distribution fabricated using the oxygen plasma etching method. As the hydrated size of Na+ and Cl− is 3.72 Å and 4.54 Å, respectively, the suggested membrane hole size should be less than 4.5 Å.92,96 Any size exceeding beyond the suggested limit results in lower salt rejection capacity. In addition, the hole shape and structure also play a vital role.203 The simulated study results by Soleimani et al.94 suggest that hourglass-shaped holes exhibit superior performance than cylindrically shaped holes. Hourglass holes exhibit a high surface area and a large number of hydrophilic sites compared to cylindrically shaped holes. The existence of a large number of hydrophilic groups at the hourglass hole edges leads to the accumulation of high water concentration and results in high flux density. Similarly, Ang et al.96 demonstrated the superior performance of slit hole structure graphene compared to circular hole structure graphene using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Fig. 46(a and b)). The slit structure graphene exhibited almost 3.5 times higher flux density than holey structure graphene while maintaining the same slat rejection capacity (Fig. 46(c)). The enhanced performance of the slit hole structure was attributed to the terminating atoms that move further away from the slit as there are no neighboring atoms in the direction of the slit to hold in the desired position which resulted in an unobstructed flow of the liquid. In the case of the circular hole structure, the terminating atoms are held in position by the neighboring atoms which result in obstruction to the flow of the liquid passing through it. The suggested optimal slit size was 2.28 Å and any size exceeding that limit results in lower salt rejection capacity. Hence, from the above study reports it obvious that hole shape and hole structures indeed affect the molecular separation performance. As the desalination process is conducted at high pressures (50–150 MPa), there is a possibility of breaking of weak carbon bonds at the hole edges. As the bonds break, the hole size increases and hence the salts easily pass through it resulting in lower rejection capacity. In order to keep edge carbon atoms intact and restore the hole size, Ebrahimi et al.95 suggested the passivation of holes by Si atoms. The simulation study predicted that hole size can be maintained by Si atoms as they form tetrahedral co-ordination with carbon atoms and stabilize the carbon bonding system. Though the simulation studies have provided much evidence for enhancing the membrane performance, it still needs to be validated by experimental analysis.

Hole functionalization could be another approach to improve the desalination capabilities of HG based membranes. The hole functionalization provides several advantages such as increased hydrophilicity, increased molecular interaction and accommodation, and selective molecular sieving through electrostatic interactions.92,93,95 The first attempt to evaluate the water desalination using functionalized HG membranes by Cohen-Tanugi and Grossman224 provided very promising results. A high salt rejection (99%) with a high water permeance of 66 L cm−2 MPa−1 was attained. Following this report, several simulation studies were conducted to get a detailed insight into the impact of hole functionalization on membrane performance.92,93,95 Graphene oxide can be considered an ideal material for membrane fabrication as the existence of various functional groups can deliver high desalination performance. Especially, the hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups in graphene oxide play a vital role in attracting more water molecules and delivering high salt rejection and water fluxes. The MD simulated results by Hosseini et al.92 demonstrated the excellent performance of graphene oxide with 89% salt rejection capacity while an enhanced salt rejection capacity of 94.3% with a high water permeability of 3345 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 was obtained for Fl functionalized HG oxide.93 In the case of graphene oxide, the functional groups (hydroxyl and epoxy) attract Na ions and reject Cl ions. However, in the case of Fl functionalized HG oxide, the Fl attracts Cl ions and the functional groups attract Na ions and hence a high salt rejection capacity is attained as only water molecules pass through the holes. Thus, selective molecular sieving using hole functionalization is effective in enhancing the performance of HG based membranes for water desalination application. It is indicated that positively charged functional groups decrease the energy barrier of negative ions and vice versa.204 Hence, various other functional groups can be explored and used in HG based membranes. It is expected that precise control of hole sizes and proper hole functionalization will result in higher performance of HG based membranes. Additionally, various other factors that enhance the desalination performance of HG based membranes are depicted in Fig. 47.
 Fig. 47  The schematics depicting the important factors of HG based membranes for improving desalination performance ref. 205. 
The majority of literature on HG based membranes is based on MD simulation studies and there are very few experimental studies. Thus, to realize their practical application, extensive experimental studies are needed to successfully fabricate membranes that will reject 100% monovalent ions to compete with the existing polymer membranes and/or reverse osmosis systems. In addition, the cytotoxicity of graphene based membranes should be studied as it depends on their concentration, size, and degree of oxidation.205 Finally, cost-effective techniques for hole generation with narrow size distribution on large area graphene based membranes should be explored. Thus, continuous efforts and innovative approaches shall surely lead to the extensive usage of graphene based membranes in water desalination applications on a commercial basis.
4.5 Other applications of HG based materials
Besides the major reported applications in supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, electro-water splitting, and water desalination systems, HG based materials are also applied in various other applications including dye-sensitized solar cells, gas sensors, hydrogen adsorption systems, dye degradation systems, bacterial detection, planar field emission, and microwave absorption systems. We will discuss in brief to get a clear insight into the progress, associated issues and solutions for the possible advancement in generating state-of-the-art applications.

4.5.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). 
Since the work reported by O'regan and Grätzel206 in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells have attracted much attention in recent years due to their low-cost, high performance, stable energy output, and easy fabrication methods. DSSCs consist of three important components namely a semiconductor photoanode (TiO2 or ZnO), a photocathode (Au, Ag, Pt or Pd) and a redox electrolyte (Fig. 48(a)).179 The photocathode, usually referred to as the ‘counter electrode’, forms the heart of DSSCs as it catalyzes the reduction of the redox electrolyte and accelerates the heterogeneous charge transfer.207 As suggested, an ideal counter electrode should exhibit high electrical conductivity, high optical absorption and a large number of catalytic sites for realizing an efficient performance. Generally, noble material nanoparticles such as Au, Ag, Pt or Pd are used as counter electrodes due to their higher catalytic activities.179 However, these nanoparticles suffer from serious problems of high cost and stability issues. Especially, the most commonly used Pt electrode is costly (50$ per gram) and readily decomposes into toxic PtI4/PtI6 components in iodide redox electrolytes leading to stability issues.208 Hence, the search for Pt-free based counter electrodes is necessary. Recent attempts have demonstrated the use of HG based counter electrodes in DSSCs. Yu et al.90 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.55% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) 12.27 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 66.4% for a holey reduced graphene oxide/Pt composite counter electrode, while a slightly enhanced performance with a PCE of 5.56% with a Jsc of 11.33 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 65.5% was obtained for 3D N doped holey reduced graphene oxide (Fig. 48(b)).106 The obtained high PCE (5.56%) of the HG based electrode is quite lower than the highest world record efficiency (14.7%) obtained by the Au/graphene nanoplate electrode.209 The high performance of HG based electrodes is mainly restricted by lower Jsc values. As an oxidized derivative of graphene was (reduced graphene oxide) used as the electrode, the existence of functional groups resulted in lower electrical conductivity, eventually leading to lower catalytic activity. Hence, to enhance the catalytic activity, the electrical conductivity should be improved by eliminating the functional groups. The use of ‘pristine HG’ as a counter electrode could be considered. In addition, the optical properties of HG based materials should be accounted for. Generally, graphene based materials exhibit low optical absorption and hence lower electron–hole pairs are generated which results in lower catalytic activity. Hence, the optical absorption of HG should be improved. A composite of semiconductor material/HG with a 3D architecture could serve the purpose. Thus, further studies considering these possible solutions may result in the enhanced performance of HG based counter electrodes in DSSCs.

4.5.2 Gas sensors. 
Gas sensors are electronic devices that sense toxic and flammable gases that have wide application in domestic and industrial systems. An efficient gas sensor should exhibit high sensitivity, high stability, high reversibility, faster response and room temperature operation at low gas concentrations.210,211 Hence, a proper selection of the gas sensing element is necessary. Various reports have demonstrated the use of HG based materials as the sensing element in gas sensors.107–109 HG based materials have been used as room temperature gas sensors for sensing toxic NO2, NH3 and H2S gases. Han et al.108 obtained steam etched HG oxide and deposited it on a SiSiO2 substrate interdigitated with Pt contacts to form a gas sensing device. Two separate devices with different steam etching times (5 and 10 h) were fabricated and tested for NO2 sensing. Comparatively, the device fabricated with a higher etching time (10 h) exhibited superior performance due to increased edge fractions and holes which provided higher active sites for NO2 interaction. The device exhibited a gas sensitivity of 8.5% at 250 ppm NO2 concentration (Fig. 49(a)). A further enhancement in the NO2 gas sensing performance for holey reduced graphene oxide was obtained by Wang et al.,107 wherein a gas sensitivity of 55% at a lower gas concentration of 12.5 ppm was obtained due to increased pore density and electrical conductivity. The increased pore density resulted in an easy diffusion and interaction of gas molecules with the abundant oxygen functional groups, while the increased electrical conductivity provided rapid charge transport. The gas molecules interact with the oxygen functional groups through the ‘charge transfer mechanism’ in which the electrons are either donated or accepted by the gas molecules. The oxygen functional groups are electron-deficient and when they interact with a reducing gas (NO2), the electrons are donated and the device resistance increases. Similarly, when oxygen functional groups interact with an oxidizing gas (NH3 or H2S), the electrons are accepted and the device resistance reduces. Thus, on the basis of electrical resistivity, the gas sensing performance is evaluated and this enables to detect various other gases. The fabricated sensor detected various reducing gases including NH3, H2S, CO and H2 (Fig. 49(b)).

NH3 and H2S, being similar natural gases, exhibited similar gas sensing performance (8.2%) at 100 ppm concentration. In the case of weak reducing gases such as CO and H2, the sensing performance was quite low (<5%) even at high gas concentrations of 750 and 1000 ppm, respectively, due to their weaker interaction with the functional groups of HG based materials. However, the performance can be improved by exploiting the intrinsic catalytic properties of noble metals composed of HG based materials. White et al.109 succeeded in sensing very low concentration H2S (3 ppb) and H2 (10 ppm) gases using Au/HG and Pd/HG composites, respectively. Such low concentration sensing translates to a high gas sensing performance. However, the high cost of noble metals restricts their use for commercial applications. Hence, various other cost-effective catalysts should be explored and used. The limited available literature clearly reflects the necessity for further detailed studies in improving the gas sensing performance of HG based materials. In addition, research studies should be further extended to sensing flammable gases such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and methane which are commonly used in domestic and industrial applications. Thus, HG based materials have great potential in gas sensing technology.


4.5.3 Hydrogen storage. 
Hydrogen storage by physisorption has gained significant interest due to its rapid kinetics and reversible adsorption/desorption cycles. The hydrogen adsorption strictly correlates with the surface area and pore volume of the host material. The higher the surface area, the higher will be the hydrogen adsorption and thus materials exhibiting a high surface area with chemical inertness are considered as promising candidates for hydrogen storage. In such a case, HG can be considered as an ideal material as it exhibits a high surface area with high pore density. Baburin et al.110 conducted both simulation and experimental studies of HG to gain insight into its hydrogen adsorption capabilities. Based on the simulation study, they predicted that generating tiny regular holes in graphene can result in an enhanced surface area up to 5100 m2 g−1 and result in a hydrogen uptake up to 6.5 wt% at 77 K, which is quite higher than that of other carbon-based materials (4–6 wt%). However, experimentally, they succeeded in fabricating HG with a surface area of 2900 m2 g−1 using the KOH activation strategy and obtained a hydrogen uptake of 5.5 wt% at 77 K and 0.89 wt% at 296 K (Fig. 50).

The reduced performance (0.89 wt%) at high temperature (296 K) was due to the increased barrier adsorption energy between the hydrogen molecules and HG. A similar effect of reduced performance with the increased operating temperature was observed by Parshetti et al.112 for HG nanosheets used for CO2 storage (Fig. 50(b)). The slight discrepancy in the simulated and experimental results was due to the obtained lower surface area as it is very difficult to obtain uniform pore density, pore size and pore volume using the employed hole generation chemical technique (KOH strategy). As a plausible solution, physical techniques can be adopted to obtain holes with uniform dimensions/architectures and achieve a high surface area for realizing improved hydrogen storage performance. Besides the surface area, the adsorption energy between the hydrogen molecules and the host materials is also important. The adsorption energy should be high so that maximum hydrogen molecules can be adsorbed on the host material. Generally, the adsorption energy of HG for hydrogen adsorption is low and hence needed to be improved. The DFT study results obtained by R. Guerrero-Avilés et al.111 suggest that N doping in HG enhances the adsorption energy and a high hydrogen uptake of up to 8.8 wt% can be attained. Hence, the heteroatom doping approach can also be considered effective in enhancing the hydrogen storage capabilities of HG based materials.


4.5.4 Dye degradation and organic pollutant separation. 
HG has demonstrated applications in dye degradation and organic pollutant separation. Various organic dyes such as Rhodamine B (RhB), Congo Red (CR) and Methylene Blue (MB) have been degraded using HG.32,103 The maximum adsorption capacity of 907, 296 and 58.8 mg g−1 have been obtained by HG for CR, MB and RhB dyes, respectively. Fig. 51(a and b) depicts the optical absorbance spectra of CR and MB dyes in the presence of HG. As seen, the optical absorbance peak intensity decreases with increasing time and completely vanishes after 120 min indicating total degradation of the dyes. The degradation is also reflected in the total color decolorization of the dyes (Fig. 51(c and d)). In addition, the properties of HG have also been exploited for organic dye separation from water. The HG demonstrated excellent organic pollutant (toluene, pump oil, used oil and ethylene glycol) adsorption with a maximum uptake capacity of 11700 wt% for ethylene glycol which is almost 117 times its own weight (Fig. 51(e)). Furthermore, the HG was reused by burning and demonstrated an outstanding regeneration capacity of 80% for 5 cycles (Fig. 51(f and g)). The dye degradation and dye adsorption properties of HG are due to important factors such as [1] the high surface area provides more catalytic sites for dye adsorption and interaction through physisorption or π–π conjunction through sp2 carbon, [2] the existence of unsaturated atoms (functional groups) at the hole edges provides highly reactive chemical sites and trigger the catalysis process, [3] the prominent capillary effect promotes high concentration dye filling in the holes and the spaces between the nanosheets. Hence, the surface area and functional groups are concluded to be the major driving factors of HG based materials for dye degradation/adsorption applications. Hole functionalization and/or heteroatom doping can be expected to further enhance the performance.

4.5.5 Organophosphate pesticide and toxic metal ion detection. 
Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) play a vital role in the agricultural industry. However, their excessive use can pose a serious threat to human life and the environment. Hence, it is imperative to detect and control their concentrations in the desired limits. Li et al.104 fabricated an amperometric acetylcholinesterase (AchE) based HG oxide/glassy carbon electrode for the detection of OPs such as ‘Paraoxon’. The fabricated electrode exhibited an efficient performance with a lower detection limit of 1.58 ng mL−1. The obtained efficient performance was attributed to the high surface area of HG oxide which provided stupendous sites for mass interaction, diffusion and rapid electron transport. In addition, a HG based material has been used to detect Cd+ ions. Cd is highly toxic as it a carcinogenic compound. Hence, its detection, even at lower concentrations, is highly essential. The sensor fabricated by Mo et al.105 based on holey reduced graphene oxide functionalized with Au/glutathione nanoclusters can detect Cd+ ions in the range of 100 to 0.1 μM (Fig. 52). As a further extension of work, efforts should be focused on the detection of various other toxic ions such as Pb+, Hg+, Cr+ and As+ using HG based materials. Hence, HG based materials have demonstrated their application in toxic pesticide/metal ion sensing technology and could emerge as the material of potential research interest.

4.5.6 Thermocells and methanol fuel cells. 
Thermocells are capable of generating electricity from the temperature-dependent electrochemical redox potentials of the electrodes. Li et al.114 fabricated HG oxide and assembled into a bulk anisotropic aerogel via an in situ reaction. The assembled thermocell based on the HG oxide aerogel can operate at −40 °C and exhibited a high power density of 3.6 W m−2 with a Seebeck coefficient (Se) of 1.3 mV K−1 arising due to its high surface area and high electrical conductivity. Additionally, the thermocells assembled in series exhibited an enhanced open-circuit voltage from 140 mV (1-cylinder thermocell) to 2.1 V (15-cylinder thermocells) (Fig. 53). Thus, the use of HG based materials in thermocells opens new avenues in wearable devices and energy storage systems for their extensive use in extremely cold environments. Additionally, HG based materials have also demonstrated application in methanol fuel cells. Methanol fuel cells are energy conversion devices that convert stored chemical energy in the methanol fuel into electricity. The proton exchange membrane forms the essential component in methanol fuel cells as it allows the flow of protons and restricts the flow of methanol molecules. The leakage of methanol molecules results in a significant drop in the energy density and generates undesirable products in the cathodic catalyst thereby leading to stability issues. Jiang et al.113 fabricated a proton exchange membrane based on HG oxide functionalized with sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and demonstrated superior performance in terms of enhanced power density and stability. The HG oxide served as the transport path for protons while the SDBS enhanced the proton conductivity and prevented methanol leakage in the cathodic part. The obtained performance was superior to that of commercially used costly Nafion membranes and thus opened new opportunities in realizing efficient and cost-effective proton exchange membranes on a commercial basis for methanol fuel cells.

4.5.7 Planar field emission and microwave absorption. 
Planar field emitters play an important role in special applications including field emissions, terahertz generators, and electron beam propulsion systems of spacecrafts. The performance of planar field emitters is influenced by two important factors such as the height of the emitters and the screening effect. For ideal performance, the height of the emitters should be equal in order to produce uniform field emissions over the desired surface. In addition, the proximity of the neighboring emitters should be optimal to avoid the detrimental influence of the screening effect. HG based materials can effectively work as planar field emitters provided that their hole sizes, hole density and hole neighboring distances are precisely controlled. Lee et al.115 fabricated a planar field emitter based on the HG material. The uniform-sized holes generated using the RIE technique independently acted as emitters under the influence of an applied electric field. Each hole emitted electrons along its circumference due to charge concentration and the collective effect of electron emission from multiple holes resulted in an amplified field emission (Fig. 54(a)). The field emission (current density) increased with the increased hole size and hole density. Based on the Fowler–Nordheim equation, the hole size was optimized to 1600 μm and the distance between the neighboring holes and hole density was kept at 10 μm and 16 cm−2, respectively (Fig. 54(b)). The fabricated planar field emitter exhibited an outstanding performance with a low turn-on field of 1.8 V μm−1, a threshold value of 2.4 μm−1, a high current density of 40 mA cm−2 and high stability by maintaining higher current densities (20 and 10 mA cm−2) for 120 h (Fig. 54(c)). HG based materials have also demonstrated superior performance in microwave absorption systems.116 The HG/silicon rubber composite with only 1 wt% HG loading exhibited an excellent microwave absorbance performance with a return loss (RL) value of −32.1 dB at 13.2 GHz (Fig. 54(d)). The microwave absorbance mechanism in HG nanosheets originates from two important properties. [1] High defect density: the existence of abundant dangling bonds and unsaturated coordination at the hole edges lead to ‘orientational polarization’ in which the localized edge state near the graphene's Fermi level allows efficient microwave absorption by the transition from the top of the valence band to the localized edge state. [2] High surface area: the high surface area promotes multiple reflection and scattering of microwaves and enhances the absorption path length. In addition, the electron accumulation at the graphene/silicon rubber interface due to microwave interfacial polarization enhances microwave absorption capabilities (Fig. 54(e)). Hence, HG based materials could be a judicious choice for planar field emission and microwave absorption applications.

4.5.8 Biological applications. 
HG based materials have also demonstrated effective performance in biological applications. The amperometric sensor based on a PtPd/N doped HG composite exhibited an efficient performance in terms of high sensitivity (52.52 μA mm−1 cm−2), rapid response (3 s), high selectivity and high stability for non-enzymatic glucose detection in human blood samples (Fig. 55(a and b)).117 Additionally, an electronic sensor based on functionalized holey reduced graphene oxide demonstrated selective bacterial detection at a very low concentration. Chen et al.118 fabricated holey reduced graphene oxide functionalized with a covalent bonded Magainin I conjugate and deposited it between Au/Ti interdigitated electrodes to form a sensor (Fig. 55(c)). The fabricated sensor worked like a field-effect transistor (FET) and was used to detect Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria by detecting the change in the electrical conductance of the FET device through its interactions with the bacteria. The sensor could detect E. coli bacteria up to concentrations as low as 803 cfu mL−1. The obtained higher sensitivity was attributed to the higher electrical conductivity and the existence of abundant functional groups in holey reduced graphene oxide which bonded effectively with the Magainin I conjugate and interacted with bacteria at very low concentrations. Such a simple and reliable method can be further extended to selective detection of other types of bacteria by exploring various other bacterial sensitive conjugates in combination with HG based materials.

As the DNA passes through the nanopore, the ionic current is modulated by the nucleotides in the nanopore, revealing the DNA sequence. Reprinted with copyright permission from ref. 117, 118 and 213. 
HG based materials have also been used in bioseparation applications such as DNA, RNA and protein structure sequencing. DNA sequencing is important as it helps in the early detection/diagnosis of diseases, individuality, and inheritance.212 An ideal DNA sequencing technique should be reliable, cost-effective and rapid. Membrane nanopore DNA sequencing under applied bias (voltage) has emerged as an important technique to meet the desired requirement. Nanopore DNA sequencing is achieved by monitoring the nucleobase-dependent ionic current when the DNA passes through the membrane nanopores (Fig. 55(d–g)).213 Hence, the membranes used for this purpose should be robust and should be as thin as possible to deliver efficient performance in terms of the highest resolution and sensitivity.214 Additionally, the pore size and DNA molecule diameters should be equal to achieve an inherently high resolution up to 0.6 nm. A monolayer HG membrane exhibits the required properties and has been used for DNA sequencing.119 However, until now, not many reports have demonstrated the reliable performance of HG based membranes in DNA sequencing due to several technical challenges such as [1] the precise control of hole sizes in graphene membranes is difficult so as to allow the translocation of DNA molecules across them, [2] the translocation speed of DNA molecules across the holes is very high (30 base per μs) which cannot be detected by our existing instrumental technology and [3] the differentiation of various DNA molecules is difficult due to their similar structures. Nevertheless, high-resolution DNA sequencing using HG membranes can be attained with the advancement in scientific technology in the coming future. Additionally, graphene based materials can be used in early detection and diagnosis of various diseases and prevent potential health risks. Thus, it is quite obvious that graphene based materials have great scope in biological applications and could revolutionize the medical field in the near future.

5. Nanohole closing
In the case of HG based materials, the existence of holes disrupts the conjugated network structure leading to poor performance in high thermal and electrical conductivity applications. Hence, a plausible way to enhance the performance by restoring the conjugated network structure through hole closing is by using the ‘Joule heating’ approach. Joule heating provides an ultrahigh temperature at the junction points in the hole where high electrical resistance exists and promotes fusion to form a conjugated structure. Chen et al.120 demonstrated the closing of nanoholes in graphene by the Joule heating approach at 2700 K and achieved superior performance in terms of high electrical conductivity (2209 S cm−1) and high thermal conductivity (863 W m−1 K−1). Based on their simulation results they concluded that carbon radicles at the hole edges are responsible for hole filling as they recombine and form a perfect carbon lattice during Joule heating (Fig. 56). Hence, the hole closing strategy through Joule heating is envisioned to restore the structural properties of graphene based materials for versatile application.

6. Conclusions and future outlook
As discussed above, HG based materials have demonstrated superior performance in various fields. The in-plane holes accompanied by graphene's unique structural and electrical properties endow graphene with unique capabilities. In this review, the state-of-the-art hole generation techniques along with the underlying mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages in graphene based materials are discussed. Both chemical and physical techniques are competent enough to generate holes and can be applied for mass-scale production. Especially, chemical techniques are rapid, simple and cost-effective and can be the preferred choice for hole generation. HG fabricated with chemical techniques can be used in the fabrication of highly efficient electrodes for electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems. Despite these claimed advantages, chemical techniques suffer from serious drawbacks of inconsistent hole size and hole density generation. In contrast, physical techniques generate holes with uniform size and density and can be used for selective applications such as water desalination and molecular purification systems. However, the associated high cost and the need for highly sophisticated instrumental setups restrict their use for commercial applications. Hence, there is an urgent necessity to conduct extensive research studies and promote significant advances in developing cost-effective and accurate hole generation techniques with controllable structures in graphene based materials. Besides in-plane holes and graphene's intrinsic properties, hole functionalization is also an important aspect. Hole functionalization through the heteroatom doping approach imparts additional unique properties to HG based materials and extends their applications in numerous fields. Despite the demonstrated advantages of hole functionalization, it is still hard to clearly unfold the mechanisms that contribute to improved performance. Hence, there is a great need to obtain extensive scientific knowledge based on practical and theoretical fundamental aspects.
HG based materials have emerged as versatile materials. In electrochemical energy storage systems, HG based electrodes have demonstrated superior performance in every aspect. In supercapacitor applications, HG based electrodes exhibit excellent performance in terms of high specific capacitance (528 F g−1), high rate capacity and outstanding cycling stability (90%-50000 cycles).17,38 The obtained capacitance is quite close to the actual theoretical capacity of graphene (550 F g−1) and could be extended even further for adopting in industrial systems. The same goes for their applications in Li-ion battery systems. The high conductivity, high surface area, and accommodation of high volume changes have enabled graphene based materials to be used as an ideal electrode for commercial battery systems. Their nanosheet restacking is the major problem that reduces the electrochemical performance of graphene based electrodes due to their reduced specific surface area. As a possible solution to overcome this problem, nano-spacers or nano-pillars can be used between neighboring graphene nanosheets to avoid their restacking. Various nanoparticles (ZnO, C, Fe2O3, etc) and nano-pillars (carbon nanotubes and/or iodophenyl based templates) have been proved to effectively resolve the existing problems.215–218 Additionally, the role of heteroatom doping and the 3D conjugated structure in enhancing the performance of graphene based electrodes is prominent.219 Hence, the three factors namely [1] nanospacers/nanopillars, [2] heteroatom doping and [3] the 3D conjugated structure are important and should be studied for in-depth analysis. In the case of energy conversion systems such as electro-water splitting and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the performance of HG based electrodes is moderate. The sluggish electrode kinetics of the OER, HER and ORR due to their chemically inert nature results in an inefficient performance in electrochemical water splitting systems. As per previous literature reports, heteroatom doping (Fe, N, S, B, etc) and induced defect density are highly suitable for overcoming the sluggish electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst by reducing the activation energy barrier.220–223 Hence, various heteroatom dopants and ways to induce high defect density sites in graphene based electrocatalysts should be explored to realize an efficient performance. In the case of DSSC applications, the obtained high efficiency of HG based counter electrodes (5.56%) is quite lower than the highest world record efficiency (14.7%) obtained by Au/graphene nanoplate electrodes.209 Hence, significant research efforts are needed to realize the efficient performance of HG based materials in energy conversion systems. One of the possible solutions to enhance the chemical reactivity is hole functionalization with various heteroatoms or oxygen-based functional groups and increasing the electrode surface area by creating 3D porous structures. Hole functionalization provides stupendous active sites for catalytic reactions while the 3D porous structure provides a larger surface area for a higher light absorption process, highly beneficial for improving the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Based on simulation studies, it is claimed that HG based membranes have great potential in water desalination systems. However, the lack of actual experimental evidence to support this claim suggests the need for extensive experimental studies. Additionally, the most significant challenge in using HG based membranes is the requirement of holes with uniform size and density. Hence, cost-effective techniques for hole generation should be explored to actually realize their desalination application. With continuous efforts and developments, the commercial application of graphene based membranes will surely revolutionize the desalination application. As discussed, the various other applications demonstrated by HG based materials are efficient and reliable and can be further improved through extensive optimization and studies.
Finally, it is concluded that further developments in hole generation technologies and detailed understanding of the influencing parameters of HG based materials can help realize their real-life applications. Suffice it to say that, on a similar basis, the research can be extended to studying and exploring the properties of various other 2D materials (MXenes, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), metal sulfides, etc.) for versatile applications.
