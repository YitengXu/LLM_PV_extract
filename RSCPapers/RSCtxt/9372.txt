    , Accepted 13th June 2012First published on 14th June 2012AbstractUrea has been considered as a potential hydrogen source, while the conventional methods to extract hydrogen from urea are typically energy intensive processes. Here we report the first demonstration of solar driven hydrogen releasing from urea and human urine in a photoelectrochemical cell, with the assistance of Ni(OH)2 modified metal oxide photoelectrodes (e.g., TiO2 and α-Fe2O3). Ni(OH)2 serves as a urea oxidation catalyst. Under light illumination, photoexcited holes generated at the metal oxide electrode oxidize urea, while photoexcited electrons reduce water to produce hydrogen gas at the Pt counter electrode. Urea oxidation was achieved under a small external bias or even at zero bias. Significantly, we observed continuous and stable hydrogen evolution at the Pt electrode in both urea and human urine electrolyte solutions under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) light illumination. This work presents a safe, low energy cost, environmentally friendly and sustainable method to produce hydrogen, and simultaneously treat urine.

Broader context
Urea [CO(NH2)2] with a gravimetric hydrogen content of 6.71% has been proposed as a hydrogen source. Urea is widely available, low cost, non-flammable, non-toxic, and chemically stable for storage and transportation. More importantly, urea is a major component (with a concentration between 0.155 and 0.39 M) of human/animal urine. Millions of tons of human urine are produced per day, and the urea available in these urines is 500 times more than the market demand of 0.5 Mt per day. However, current methods for hydrogen releasing from urea are typically high energy consuming and not cost effective. Therefore, it is scientifically and economically important to recover hydrogen directly from urea in urine in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, solar-driven hydrogen releasing from urea as well as directly from human urine at zero bias in a photoelectrochemical cell using TiO2 nanowire arrays as a photoelectrode and Ni(OH)2 as a urea oxidation catalyst. We observed continuous hydrogen gas evolution at the Pt electrode under light illumination. This work presents a safe, low cost and sustainable method to produce hydrogen, while simultaneously treating urine wastewater.

Central to the success of realizing a hydrogen economy and the widespread use of hydrogen powered fuel cells is the sustainable supply of hydrogen.1–8 Numerous chemicals such as hydrazine and metal hydrides have been considered as promising hydrogen sources.6 However, most of them are costly, highly toxic, flammable,3,4,9 and more importantly, their supply is not sustainable. These factors limit their potential use as materials for hydrogen supply. Recently, urea [CO(NH2)2] has been proposed as an alternative hydrogen source. It has a gravimetric hydrogen content of 6.71%. Additionally, it is widely available, low cost, non-flammable, non-toxic, and chemically stable for storage and transportation.6,10 More importantly, urea is a major component (with a concentration between 0.155 and 0.39 M) of human/animal urine.11 Millions of tons of human urine are produced per day. Urea available in these urines is 500 times more than the market demand of 0.5 Mt per day.6 However, human urine has been considered as wastewater that could raise environmental issues such as nitrate contamination of ground water.12,13 It is scientifically and economically important to recover hydrogen directly from urea in urine. Current methods for hydrogen releasing from urea are typically high energy consuming and not cost effective. For example, hydrogen can be obtained from high temperature cracking of ammonia, which is a product of urea decomposition.14 This is an energy-intensive process that substantially increases the cost of hydrogen production, and involves potential safety issues. Alternatively, urea aqueous solution can be electrolyzed to produce hydrogen with the assistance of a urea oxidation catalyst under an external bias.11,12 However, urea electrolysis consumes a substantial amount of electrical energy, which makes it less practical. Ideally, the decomposition of urea for hydrogen releasing should be driven by a renewable energy source, and hydrogen can be produced directly from human urine. A possible method is using solar cells to power an electrolyzer for urea electrolysis. However, the high cost of solar cells and electrolyzers is the major drawback of this approach. Alternatively, a photoelectrochemical cell consisting of semiconductor electrodes that can harvest light and use the photoexcited electrons and holes directly for hydrogen generation and urea oxidation could be a more cost-effective way. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, solar-driven hydrogen releasing from urea as well as directly from human urine at zero bias in a photoelectrochemical cell with metal oxide nanowire arrays as a photoelectrode and Ni(OH)2 as a urea oxidation catalyst. In comparison to urea electrolysis and ammonia cracking processes, this method is cheaper, safer, and more importantly, it is a sustainable method to produce hydrogen.

Fig. 1 illustrates the mechanism of solar-driven hydrogen production from urea in a photoelectrochemical cell that is composed of a metal oxide, such as TiO2, photoelectrode modified with an electrochemical catalyst Ni(OH)2 and a Pt counter electrode. The chemical reactions at electrodes are described by the following equations:Anode: TiO2 + hv → TiO*2 + e + hNi(OH)2 + OH− + h → NiOOH + H2O6NiOOH + CO(NH2)2 + H2O → 6Ni(OH)2 + CO2 + N2, E0 = 0.37 V vs. RHECathode: 2H2O + 2e → H2 + 2OH−, E0 = 0 V vs. RHE  
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of a photoelectrochemical device consisting of a TiO2 nanowire-arrayed photoanode decorated with a Ni(OH)2 catalyst and a Pt counter electrode. The square box shows the energy diagram of the TiO2 photoanode and illustrates the basic operation mechanism for solar driven urea oxidation. 
Under light illumination, photoexcited holes (h) produced in TiO2 will oxidize Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH, which is known to be an electrochemical catalyst for urea oxidization to produce N2 and CO2.11,12 At the counter electrode, photoexcited electrons (e) will reduce water to produce hydrogen. To achieve efficient production of hydrogen from urea under a reduced external bias or even at zero-bias, metal oxide electrode materials should have band-edge positions that straddle the water reduction potential and the urea oxidation potential, as well as a relatively small band-gap for visible light absorption. In this work, we have exemplified this concept with two metal oxide semiconductors TiO2 and α-Fe2O3, which have been commonly used as electrode materials for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.15–25 α-Fe2O3 has a favorable band-gap energy of 2.1 eV, which allows absorption of a significant portion of visible light, and thus could lead to good solar conversion efficiency.16,24,26,27 However, an external bias may need to be applied for hydrogen production due to the low lying conduction band of α-Fe2O3. In contrast, TiO2 has band-edge positions that are well aligned with the potentials of urea oxidation and water reduction, and thereby hydrogen release could be achieved at zero bias. The major drawback of TiO2 electrodes would be the limited absorption of visible light due to their large band-gap (rutile TiO2, 3.0 eV).19,22,28–30
TiO2 nanowire arrays were synthesized on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate using a hydrothermal method reported elsewhere.19 The as-prepared TiO2 nanowires were annealed in air at 550 °C for 3 h, followed by annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere at 350 °C for an additional 30 min. Hydrogen-treatment has been reported to be an effective method for enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2.19 The SEM image shows that the FTO substrate is covered with dense and aligned TiO2 nanowires, which have diameters in the range between 100 and 200 nm (Fig. 2a). X-ray diffraction studies (Fig. 2b) confirm that TiO2 nanowires have a tetragonal rutile structure (PDF no. 88-1175). To promote urea oxidation at the photoanode, we deposited Ni(OH)2 as an electrochemical catalyst on TiO2 nanowires by successively dipping into Ni(NO3)2 and NaOH aqueous solutions (Experimental section, ESI†). The Ni ion will react with hydroxide ions to form Ni(OH)2, Ni2+ + 2OH− → Ni(OH)2. While the deposition of Ni(OH)2 did not change the morphology of TiO2 nanowires, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis confirms the presence of Ni on TiO2 nanowire arrays (Fig. S-1, ESI†). The atomic ratio of Ni to Ti [Ni/(Ni + Ti)] was determined to be 1.5%. These data support the successful preparation of Ni(OH)2 modified TiO2 nanowire arrays.

We studied the performance of TiO2 and Ni(OH)2 modified TiO2 (denoted as Ni-TiO2) nanowire arrays for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical urea oxidation. Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammograms collected for TiO2 and Ni-TiO2 in the potential window between −0.5 and +1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In the absence or presence of urea, the cyclic voltammograms collected for TiO2 (without the Ni(OH)2 catalyst) show only small background current without obvious redox peaks, indicating that neither water oxidation nor urea oxidation occurs in this potential window. In a NaOH electrolyte solution (in the absence of urea), Ni-TiO2 shows well-defined redox peaks in the potential range between 0.3 and 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 3a, inset), corresponding to the Ni2+/Ni3+ transition. The drastically increased anodic current at a potential of 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl can be attributed to water oxidation. Significantly, the cyclic voltammogram of Ni-TiO2 shows a substantially enhanced current at a potential of 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl or above, in a urea electrolyte solution (0.33 M urea in a 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution). The result suggests that urea was oxidized at the Ni-TiO2 electrode. Urea oxidation commences at the Ni2+/Ni3+ transition potential which indicates that Ni3+ is an electrochemical catalyst for urea oxidation. Ni3+ species have been reported to be good catalysts for catalytic oxidation of small organic molecules such as glucose.31 The anodic peak in the forward sweep is ascribed to the consumption of active Ni3+ sites, and the peak in the reverse sweep could be due to the desorption of urea molecules from the electrode surface.12 Note that urea oxidation and water oxidation occur at the potentials of 0.35 and 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. This indicates that urea oxidation is more favorable than water oxidation, in the presence of Ni(OH)2 catalyst. This is consistent with the recent report on Ni(OH)2 that showed excellent electrochemical catalytic specificity for urea oxidation compared to water oxidation.11

Inset: magnified view of the cyclic voltammogram of Ni-TiO2 (green curves) in the potential window highlighted by the dashed box.

(c) Photocurrent–time response curve of Ni-TiO2 and TiO2 collected at zero bias in a two-electrode electrochemical cell, under chopped AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). (d) Photocurrent–time response curve of Ni-TiO2 collected at −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). 
We further studied the performance of TiO2 and Ni-TiO2 for urea oxidation under light illumination. It is expected that photovoltage generated in TiO2 and Ni-TiO2 can facilitate urea oxidation by reducing the need for an external bias. As shown in Fig. 3b, the onset potential of urea oxidation shifts to −0.92 V vs. Ag/AgCl under light illumination, which is indeed substantially lower than the potential required for urea electrolysis (0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl). In comparison to TiO2, Ni-TiO2 exhibits an even more negative onset potential for urea oxidation (Fig. 3b). It is believed that the photoexcited holes in Ni-TiO2 oxidize Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH, which further catalyzes the oxidation of urea by reducing the electrode overpotential. Meanwhile, photoexcited electrons transfer to the Pt counter electrode to reduce water to hydrogen gas. The Ni-TiO2 sample shows enhanced incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) values compared to the blank TiO2 at the same potential (Fig. S-2, ESI†), which is consistent with their linear sweep voltammogram results. Additionally, IPCE studies show that Ni catalyst modification does not change the optical absorption edge of TiO2. Fig. 3c shows the photocurrent density–time response curves measured for Ni-TiO2 and TiO2 at zero-bias using a two-electrode electrochemical cell, under chopped AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Significantly, a stable photocurrent density of 0.35 mA cm−2 was achieved at zero-bias. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of solar driven urea oxidation and hydrogen production without the need for an external bias. The photocurrent transient could be due to inefficient charge separation at the interface of the electrolyte and TiO2 under zero-bias. We also tested the long term stability for solar driven urea oxidation at −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. There is no decay in photocurrent density at least for 50 hours, suggesting that the solar driven urea oxidation is sustainable for long term operation. Continuous gas evolution was also observed on Pt wires under light illumination, as shown in Video S1 (ESI†). Gas chromatography analysis demonstrates that the collected gas at the Pt cathode is hydrogen (Fig. S-3, ESI†).
Based on the successful demonstration of solar-driven urea oxidation, we extended the efforts to study solar-driven oxidation of urea present in real human urine. The cyclic voltammogram measured for Ni-TiO2 in a urine electrolyte solution shows an anodic peak at a potential of around 0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. S-4, ESI†), which is the same as that obtained in the urea electrolyte solution, indicative of catalytic oxidation of urea present in human urine. Likewise, this onset potential for urea oxidation also shifts to a lower potential of −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl under light illumination, as expected (Fig. 4a). The urine sample shows a smaller current than the urea sample at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is due to the relatively lower urea concentration in urine solution. The photocurrent density–time response curve, collected for the Ni-TiO2 electrode in urine solution at zero bias under chopped light illumination, shows a photocurrent density of 0.25 mA cm−2 (Fig. S-5, ESI†). This result proves that solar driven urea oxidation can also be achieved in real human urine at zero bias, which is critical for practical application. Significantly, the Ni-TiO2 electrode also shows a stable photocurrent density in urine solution at least for 4000 s (Fig. 4b) and we observed continuous hydrogen gas evolution at the Pt wire counter electrode at −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Video S2, ESI†). The successful demonstration of solar driven hydrogen release from human urine provides a sustainable solution for hydrogen generation and new insights into wastewater treatment.

Although Ni-TiO2 shows great promise as a photoanode for urea oxidation, the solar conversion efficiency of TiO2 electrodes is still limited due to their large band-gap energy. In this regard, we also explore the potentials of α-Fe2O3 nanowire arrays for urea oxidation. α-Fe2O3 with a favorable band-gap of 2.1 eV for visible light absorption has recently attracted a lot of attention due to its potential use as electrode materials for water oxidation.16,24,26,27,32 Recently, we have demonstrated a facile method to improve the electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3, which is one of its major limitations.15 α-Fe2O3 nanowire arrays were synthesized according to a hydrothermal method reported elsewhere,15 and coated with Ni(OH)2 by the same dip-coating method used for TiO2 samples. α-Fe2O3 nanowires are densely packed on the FTO substrate with average diameter in the range between 100 and 150 nm (Fig. 5a). XRD spectra collected from the nanowire film show characteristic diffraction peaks of α-Fe2O3 (Fig. S-6a, ESI†). EDS analysis confirms the existence of Ni in Ni(OH)2 modified α-Fe2O3 nanowires (denoted as Ni-Fe2O3) (Fig. S-6b, ESI†). Fig. S-6c (ESI†) shows the cyclic voltammograms collected for α-Fe2O3 and Ni-Fe2O3 in NaOH solution and urea electrolyte solution. The significantly enhanced anodic current with an onset potential of 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the presence of urea indicates the oxidation of urea on the electrode, and urea oxidation is more favorable than water oxidation. Fig. 5b shows the linear sweep voltammograms of α-Fe2O3 and Ni-Fe2O3 in urea solution under light illumination. As expected, the onset potential for urea oxidation substantially shifts to a more negative potential of −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, due to the photovoltage generated in α-Fe2O3. In comparison to TiO2 electrodes, α-Fe2O3 electrodes need a larger external bias for urea oxidation due to the relatively low lying conduction band of α-Fe2O3. Significantly, the onset potential of Ni-Fe2O3 is negatively shifted for more than 400 mV, compared to α-Fe2O3. Therefore, the Ni-Fe2O3 sample shows substantially enhanced current than α-Fe2O3 measured at the same potential. IPCE analysis also supports that the Ni catalyst modification increases the photoactivities of the α-Fe2O3 electrode (Fig. S-7, ESI†). This result again supports that Ni(OH)2 serves as an efficient electrochemical catalyst for urea oxidation. The linear sweep voltammogram obtained for the Ni-Fe2O3 electrode in a urine electrolyte solution is similar to the one obtained in a urea electrolyte solution (Fig. S-6d, ESI†). These results confirm that solar driven urea oxidation can also be achieved on α-Fe2O3 electrodes.

We have developed a simple, low-cost and safe method for hydrogen production from urea and directly from human urine, with the assistance of solar light and metal oxide photoelectrodes such as TiO2 or α-Fe2O3. By using Ni(OH)2 modified TiO2 nanowire arrays as a photoelectrode, we have demonstrated solar driven urea oxidation at zero bias in both urea and urine electrolyte solutions. Urea oxidation has also been achieved on Ni(OH)2 modified α-Fe2O3 nanowire arrays under a small external bias. Ni(OH)2 served as a good electrochemical catalyst by reducing the electrode overpotential for urea oxidation. Importantly, hydrogen gas evolved at the Pt counter electrode under light illumination, and both Ni-TiO2 and Ni-Fe2O3 electrodes showed excellent stability for urea oxidation. The successful demonstration of solar driven hydrogen releasing from human urine could provide a sustainable solution for hydrogen production and new insights into wastewater treatment.

Urea is widely available, low cost, non-flammable, non-toxic, and chemically stable for storage and transportation. More importantly, urea is a major component (with a concentration between 0.155 and 0.39 M) of human/animal urine.

In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, solar-driven hydrogen releasing from urea as well as directly from human urine at zero bias in a photoelectrochemical cell using TiO2 nanowire arrays as a photoelectrode and Ni(OH)2 as a urea oxidation catalyst. We observed continuous hydrogen gas evolution at the Pt electrode under light illumination. This work presents a safe, low cost and sustainable method to produce hydrogen, while simultaneously treating urine wastewater.
