    , Accepted 27th November 2020First published on 27th November 2020AbstractThe combination of large energy density and high power density is the optimized model for supercapacitors. However, due to the sluggish charge transfer and ion diffusion, cobalt-aluminium hydrotalcite (CoAl LDHs) electrode materials currently deliver barely satisfactory performance. Oxygen vacancies have been reported to have positive facilitation to the electrochemical property of the hydrotalcite-like materials. In this work, the proportion of oxygen vacancies in CoAl LDHs was increased by NaBH4 treatment, which improved the electrochemical energy storage performance of pristine CoAl LDHs, while prolonged treatment will damage the internal structure of the material and is not conducive to the improvement of electrochemical performance. Consequently, the acquired CoAl LDHs-0.5 delivers a high specific capacity of 799.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and maintains 81.1% capacity as the current density up to 20 A g−1, which exhibited higher performance than pristine CoAl LDHs and the most reported CoAl LDH-based materials. Besides, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated using CoAl LDHs-0.5 and commercial activated carbon (AC) as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, which exhibits a maximum energy density of 28.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 523.5 W kg−1 and retains 73.3% of the initial capacity after 5000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. This work provides an ingenious strategy and builds confidence in the further application of CoAl LDHs in electrode materials of supercapacitors.
1. Introduction
In the past few years, the increased utilization of traditional energy and rapidly growing energy-related and environmental issues have prompted an urgent need for clean and sustainable energy. In this regard, energy conversion technologies, in particular electrochemical energy applications (e.g., rechargeable batteries, fuel cells and supercapacitors), have developed rapidly and made satisfactory progress.1–3 As one of the typical devices of electrochemical energy conversion, supercapacitors has been applied in a wide range of industries including power sectors, industries, electronics and electrified transportation.4 These practical applications are inseparable from the outstanding characteristics of supercapacitors, in particular the peculiarities of large power density, durable service life and low price, which are mainly determined by the physical energy storage mechanism.5,6 Unfortunately, the low energy density of supercapacitors, in particular the traditional carbon-based electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), cannot meet the requirements of the rapidly developing industries. As one of the new functional materials emerging in recent years, pseudocapacitive materials offer both high energy density and power density simultaneously, exhibiting battery-like charge storage mechanism but with a charge storage velocity comparable to that of EDLC materials, which filled the gap between EDLCs and the batteries.7–10
As a kind of material that is usually expressed as [M2+1−xM3+x(OH)2]An−x/n·mH2O (M2+ represents bivalent metal cations, M3+ represents trivalent metal cations and An− represents an interlayer anion, respectively), layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been adopted as active materials for supercapacitor electrodes thanks to their special structure and composition.11–13 Eminently, LDHs containing trivalent aluminium (Al3+) such as NiAl LDHs,14 CoAl LDHs15 and MgAl LDHs16 have been reported to possess stable structures and electrochemical properties. Although LDHs have great potential characteristics of energy storage according to the theoretical calculation, the actual performance is not up to expectations due to the considerably poor electrical conductivity of LDHs in themselves.17,18 Thus far, familiar strategies such as complexation with materials such as graphene,19 carbon materials,20 and conductive polymers21 that well conduct electricity, conversion into oxides,22 sulfides23 and phosphates,24 and changing the electronic structure of the bulk materials25 have been used to solve this conundrum.
Extensive research shows that any vacancy or defect has an effect on the output characteristics of electrode materials, such as boosting the quantity of redox or adsorption effective sites, accelerating the transmission of electrons and improving the intrinsic conductivity of the materials.26–28 For instance, Zou's group modulated the oxygen vacancies of NiMn LDHs with mild H2O2, which presented a supreme specific capacitance of 1183 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.29 Liang et al. synthesized an oxygen-vacancy-rich NiCo LDH nanowire array by reducing the pristine LDHs using NaBH4, and the obtained Vo-NiCo LDH showed 1.57 times of specific capacitance compared to pristine LDHs.30 Furthermore, compared with reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere, anoxic calcining and acid etching, the wet chemical reduction is a simple vacancy generation method, which can increase the content of oxygen vacancies without destroying the structure of materials subversively.30,31
Based on the aforementioned discussion, in this work, the oxygen vacancies in CoAl LDHs were further increased upon reduction of NaBH4. Thanks to the abundant oxygen vacancies and slight structural changes, the obtained CoAl LDHs-0.5 presents a maximum specific capacity of 799.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 (approximately 1.4 times to original CoAl LDHs) with a capacity retention of 81.1% with the promotion of current densities to 20 A g−1. The outstanding electrochemical expression is benefited by the promotion of electron and ion transfer by vacancies. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor packaged with CoAl LDHs-0.5 and commercial activated carbon delivers an energy density of 28.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 523.5 W kg−1 and retains 73.3% of the initial capacity after 5000 consecutive cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of CoAl LDHs-0.5 material

Materials and chemicals. 
Aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), N-methyl-pyrrolidone and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Activated carbon (average particle size is 10 μm, specific surface area is 2000 m2 g−1) and acetylene black were purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All the used reagents were of analytical reagent (AR) grade and used directly without further purification.


Synthesis of CoAl LDHs. 
CoAl LDHs was synthesized according to our previous work.32 Typically, 0.437 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.187 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dispersed in 50 mL distilled water and marked as solution A. Similarly, 0.160 g NaOH and 0.159 g Na2CO3 were dispersed in 15 mL distilled water and marked as solution B. After stirring for 5 min, solution B was added dropwise into solution A. Then, the multicomponent solution was put in a sealed autoclave and heated at 120 °C in a constant temperature oven for 16 h. After the reaction procedure, the cooled precipitate was washed 3 times with distilled water and ethanol, and the product was separated using a high-speed centrifugal separator. The sediments were dried at 80 °C overnight and collected for further use.


Synthesis of CoAl LDHs-0.5 material. 
In order to increase the oxygen vacancy, 0.3 g prepared CoAl LDHs were soaked in 50 mL NaBH4 solution (0.8 M) under magnetic stirring for 0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h and 2 h, respectively. The products were also separated using a high-speed centrifuge and dried at 80 °C overnight. The final products were denoted CoAl LDHs-0.5, CoAl LDHs-1.0, CoAl LDHs-1.5 and CoAl LDHs-2.0, respectively.

2.2. Characterizations
The crystal phase and crystalline nanostructures of the as-prepared electrode materials were characterized using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (Smartlab SE, Japan) equipped with a monochromatic Cu Kα radiation source at a scan rate of 5° min−1 (40 kV/40 mA, λ = 0.15418 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using an infrared spectrometer (Nicolet Avatar 380, Thermo Electron). The micromorphology and composition of the materials were explored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mappings, and the respective image results were obtained using a TECNAI G2 TF20 field emission transmission electron microscope (FETEM). The chemical compositions of the materials were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and the spectra were recorded using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB Xi+) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source. Electron spin resonance spectra of the samples were recorded using an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance apparatus (E500-Brochure).
2.3. Electrochemical testing
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out in a typical three-electrode configuration using an electrochemical workstation (CHI-760E, Shanghai, China). The electrode used for testing was prepared following the procedure reported in a previous work of our group.33 In the testing system, the working electrode is the prepared electrode coated with the prepared active material (1 × 1 cm2), the counter electrode is a piece of thin platinum sheet (1 cm × 1.5 cm × 0.5 mm), the reference electrode is a commercial Hg/HgO standard electrode (Aida-R0501, 0.098 V, Tianjin, China) and the electrolyte is 6 M KOH aqueous solution. The specific capacity of the prepared materials was computed using the GCD information according to eqn (1):34 (1)where Ce (F g−1) is the specific capacity of a single electrode in the three-electrode system. I (A g−1) represents the current density.  is the area enclosed by the discharge curve and discharge time and U is the potential voltage between the initial and maximum charging voltages.
An asymmetric supercapacitor cell (ASC) comprises the prepared material serving as the cathode and commercial active carbon (AC) as the anode, which was denoted CoAl LDHs//AC or CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC, respectively. The AC electrode was prepared similarly to the cathodic electrode. It is widely believed that the ASC has the highest storage charge, when the charges are of equal quantity in the cathode and anode. In order to maximize the storage charge, the mass ratio of activated carbon and prepared materials was calculated by following eqn (2): (2)where m+ denotes the mass, Ce+ the specific capacity, and ΔU+ the potential voltage of the cathode electrode. Similarly, m−, Ce− and ΔU− are the mass, specific capacity and potential voltage of the AC electrode, respectively. The mass specific capacitance, the energy density and power density of ASC were computed using eqn (3)–(5): (3) (4) (5)where CA (F g−1) signifies the mass specific capacitance, I (A g−1) the current density, Δt (s) the discharge time, E (W h kg−1) the energy density and P (W kg−1) the power density of ASC.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structures, morphologies and composition

Scheme 1 summarizes the diagrammatical steps used for synthesising CoAl LDHs-0.5, mainly involving a hydrothermal method and subsequent reduction treatment. First, the lamelliform CoAl LDHs were prepared by a one-step hydrothermal process, in which NaOH and Na2CO3 are the precipitants. Second, 0.3 g of the obtained CoAl LDHs was stirred in 0.8 M NaBH4 aqueous solution for a pre-set time to convert part of Co3+ into Co2+. Moreover, along with the change in the valence state of some elements, the reduction treatment also changed the microstructure, which can be proved by TEM and XPS characterization.
 Scheme 1  Schematic of the preparation procedure of CoAl LDHs and CoAl LDHs-Ov. 
The crystal phases of the as-obtained CoAl LDHs and processed CoAl LDHs were identified by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. As presented in Fig. 1a, all the samples exhibit the representative cobalt aluminium carbonate hydroxide hydrate crystalline structure (JCPDS NO. 51-0045, space group Rm (166); a = 3.08 Å, b = 22.8 Å). The peaks located at 11.3°, 23.0°, 34.3°, 38.8°, 59.7° and 61.2° could be contributed to the (003), (006), (012), (015), (110) and (0115) crystallographic planes of the hydrotalcite-like phase, respectively. Notably, in contrast to the XRD pattern of the original CoAl LDHs, the peaks of CoAl LDHs with oxygen vacancy shifted to smaller 2θ angles, demonstrating the increase in the interplanar spacing according to the Bragg equation, which could be due to the intervention of oxygen vacancies in CoAl LDHs.35,36 Besides, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was adopted to confirm the structure of the prepared electrode materials. Fig. 1b presents the FT-IR spectra of different as-prepared samples. The obvious absorption peak located at about 3450 cm−1 is attributed to the O–H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups from the interlaminar anion.37 The peak at 1355 cm−1 is assigned to the absorption features of CO32− and the characteristic peaks between 500 cm−1 and 800 cm−1 are assigned to the metal-oxygen bending and stretching vibrations, respectively.38 Thus, the LDH construction is corroborated by the FT-IR and XRD results, and the reduction treatment made the lattice spacing slightly enlarged, which can be confirmed by the migration from the characteristic peak to the low 2θ angles.

The morphology and microstructure of the CoAl LDHs and CoAl LDHs-0.5 were investigated by TEM and HRTEM measurements. As can be observed in the TEM images in Fig. 2a, the CoAl LDHs exhibits a circular-like sheet structure with a diameter of about 100–150 nm. In addition, the HRTEM images in Fig. 2b clearly show the straight lattice fringes with an interval of 0.38 nm, which are indexed to the (006) plane of CoAl LDHs. Besides, the EDX mappings shown in Fig. 2c indicate that the Co, Al and O elements evenly distributed over the CoAl LDH nanosheet. While for CoAl LDHs-0.5, there is a degree of fragmentation of the sheet-like microstructure (Fig. 2d), which may be caused by the reduction treatment. It is worth noting that the straight lattice fringes with an interval of 0.26 nm could be clearly observed in the inset of Fig. 2e, which is attributed to the (012) plane of CoAl LDHs. The EDX mappings presented in Fig. 2f show that the Co, Al and O elements are evenly distributed over the CoAl LDHs-0.5 nanosheet. Furthermore, it can be clearly seen from the lattice morphology at magnification in Fig. 2e that other lattice stripes have a certain amount of distortions and defects, which is mainly caused by the action of reduction treatment of NaBH4. Such changes in the microstructure caused by vacancies have also been reported in other works.36,39–41 According to the literature, the lattice distortion could be benefited to the electron conductivity of the intrinsic material and could add the active sites of the electrochemical reaction.42,43 Thus, we expect the CoAl LDHs-0.5 electrode to exhibit better electrochemical energy storage characteristics than the CoAl LDH electrode.

In order to further explore the internal composition changes of the CoAl LDHs before and after reduction, XPS analysis was applied to investigate the surface element valence state of the prepared samples. Fig. 3a shows the XPS survey spectra of pristine CoAl LDHs and CoAl LDHs resulting from different reductive treatment times. The obvious characteristic peaks of Co, O and Al have a good consistency with the results of EDX, and no significant differences are observed in these six spectra. However, in high-resolution XPS spectra, the binding energies of elements, in particular Co and O elements, have a variation to some extent. Concretely, Fig. 3b presents the fitting results of Co 2p XPS spectra, in which two pairs of major peaks and a pair of satellite peaks are observed. The peaks located at 780.8 and 796.9 eV are the signals of Co3+, the peaks located at 783.3 and 798.5 eV are the signals of Co2+ and the peaks appearing at 787.0 and 803.0 eV are assigned to satellite peaks. Interestingly, the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ shown in Table 1 increases with the prolonged processing time, which more powerfully indicates that part of Co3+ is transformed into the Co2+ valence state by the reduction treatment. Thus, the coordination of the electrons around the oxygen atom is out of balance. For the O 1s XPS spectra in Fig. 3c, there are four deconvoluted peaks that can be fitted, which are respectively from lattice oxygen (OL) located at 529.8 eV, hydroxyl oxygen (OOH) located at 530.7 eV, oxygen atoms adjoined to oxygen vacancy (OV) located at 531.4 eV and oxygen in absorbed water (OW) located at 530.7 eV.29,44 The percentage of the OV peak area in the CoAl LDHs after NaBH4 treatment is larger than that of the peak in fresh CoAl LDHs, and the mathematical values are enlarged with the prolonged processing times (Table 1). This change further indicates that the reduction treatment of NaBH4 induced the unsaturated coordination of oxygen. These results of Co and O XPS spectra evidently suggest that reduction treatment prompted more oxygen vacancies in CoAl LDHs. Furthermore, the XPS spectra of Al 2p are revealed in Fig. 3d, in which the characteristic peak located at 73.9 eV is attributed to typical 3-valent aluminum.45Fig. 3e provides the C 1s spectra of all samples. The three peaks located at 284.8, 286.0 and 288.7 eV could be assigned to C–C, C–OH and CC, respectively, proving the existence of the intercalated anion of CO32−. The EPR was recognized as an effective tool to prove the existence of the vacancy, and g = 2.0 was taken for the electrons trapped on oxygen vacancies.46,47 As shown in Fig. 3f, the EPR signal intensity of CoAl LDHs-0.5 is much stronger than the signal of CoAl LDHs, demonstrating the presence of more oxygen vacancies in CoAl LDHs.

The synthetic analysis of the results of XRD, FT-IR, TEM, XPS and EPR are presented above. We believe that the CoAl LDHs were successfully synthesised by a one-step hydrothermal process. Moreover, the oxygen vacancy was produced by the reduction of NaBH4, while the vacancy content was controlled by the treatment times. We expect that the treated CoAl LDHs-0.5 will produce more impressive electrochemical properties due to changes in structures and compositions.
3.2. Electrochemical properties of the as-prepared CoAl LDH-based samples
The electrochemical performances of the synthesized materials were evaluated in a typical three-electrode system. Fig. 4a shows the CV curves of the pristine CoAl LDHs and the treated CoAl LDHs in the voltage window from 0 to 0.6 V at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Remarkably, all the five electrodes show a pair of redox peaks, and the CoAl LDHs-0.5 electrode expressly presents the highest peak current. Consequently, these five electrodes are all materials with pseudocapacitance properties and the CoAl LDHs-0.5 displays the highest specific capacitance. GCD measurement is another important method to quantitatively measure the specific capacitance. Fig. 4b presents the GCD results of the prepared five sample electrodes, from which it could be inferred that the specific capacity reduces with the prolonged processing time. However, the specific capacities of the samples treated with NaBH4 for half an hour and one hour were both higher than those of the untreated CoAl LDHs. In other words, appropriate oxygen vacancies can prolong the discharge time of CoAl LDHs, whereas excess oxygen vacancies reduce the discharge time. We speculate that appropriate vacancy is helpful to regulate the electronic structure of LDHs and facilitate the rapid transfer of charges, while excessive vacancy disturbs the arrangement structure of LDHs and hinders the redox reaction during the charging–discharging test. Thus, we can preliminarily consider that the treatment time of reduction has a dominant impact on the electrochemical expression of samples. In order to further verify this tendency, the EIS measurement that acted as a powerful tool to understand the intrinsic mechanism of storage charge was adopted.48Fig. 4c shows the EIS plots of five electrodes simulated with the equivalent circuit inserted in the figure. The value of the intersection point of the curve and the real axis represents the equivalent series resistance (Rs), and the diameter of the semicircle can be used to measure the internal resistance (Rct) of charge transfer of the electrode. For Rs in the high-frequency region, there is no obvious gap between five electrodes, while Rct in medium-frequency region has significant differences. Through comparison, we found that Rct of CoAl LDHs-0.5 is the minimum one, manifesting the best performance of charge transfer. Instead, there was a slight increase in Rct of other samples, which further confirms our conjecture in the results of GCD. It can be seen from the TEM images that the LDH nanosheets have a certain amount of fragmentation after reduction treatment. However, the promotion effect of the vacancy on charge transfer is dominant under short-time treatment. While the nano-sheet is broken seriously after long-time processing, which leads to the complexity of the charge transfer path and an increase in the transfer resistance. Based on the CV, GCD and EIS results, we can draw a conclusion that the appropriate time of reduction treatment improves the charge storage performance of CoAl LDHs, while the excessive treatment is not conducive to the energy storage performance of CoAl LDHs. Moreover, the detailed electrochemical properties of CoAl LDHs-0.5 were tested under different test parameters. Fig. 4d reveals the CV curves of CoAl LDHs-0.5 electrode at crescent scan velocities from 5 to 100 mV s−1. A pair of distinct anodic and cathodic CV peaks account for its pseudocapacitance, and the outstanding symmetry of the curves indicates its good reversibility. Besides, the comparison of the charging–discharging performance of CoAl LDs before and after treatment is shown in Fig. 4e. The discharge platform at about 0.35 V further demonstrates the pseudocapacitive characteristics, and the longer discharge time indicates the positive role of oxygen vacancy. At current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 A g−1, the specific capacities of CoAl LDHs-0.5 were calculated to be 799.2, 784.6, 747.6, 706.2 and 648.5 F g−1, while for pristine CoAl LDHs, the values were 576.4, 557.6, 528.4, 506.2 and 473.1 F g−1, respectively. In comparison with original CoAl LDHs, the specific capacity of CoAl LDHs-0.5 is improved, while the rate performance is not decreased (both about 82%). Besides, after 5000 cycles of charge–discharge process, the CoAl LDHs-0.5 still retained a higher capacitance than CoAl LDHs (Fig. 4f). The minor difference in the final specific capacitance may be due to the recovery of unsaturated coordination oxygen by the long charging–discharging process, leading to the material returning to its pre-treated state. Finally, we made a comparison with the reported work listed in Table 2, which found that although the specific capacity of CoAl LDHs-0.5 is not as high as that of NiAl LDHs and NiCo LDHs, the rate capability is far more than NiAl LDHs and NiCo LDHs. In addition, the specific capacity is higher than that of other cobalt-based materials such as Co3O4/CoO, CoP, and CoS-20. Therefore, we believe that our CoAl LDHs-0.5 material has great advantages and competitiveness.38,45,49–61

3.3. Charge storage capacity of the as-prepared CoAl LDH-based ASCs
What is more, the asymmetric supercapacitor cell (ASC) was assembled using CoAl LDHs-0.5 (or CoAl LDHs) as the cathode and activated carbon (AC) as the anode, separately. Fig. 5 shows the primary electrochemical properties such as CV, GCD and EIS of the AC electrode, which were carried out in a three-electrode configuration with 6 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. Concretely, the CV curves shown in Fig. 5a display an approximate rectangle shape, which is a typical embodiment of an EDLC-type material. Fig. 5b presents the GCD plots of the AC electrode at different current densities; the triangular charging–discharging curves further prove the EDLC-based characteristics. The computed specific capacitances are shown in Fig. 5c, which are 257.7, 240.2, 223.5, 214.0 and 202.0 F g−1 at 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively. Besides, the EIS measure was adopted to explore the transfer dynamics characteristics of charge and electrolyte ions in the AC electrode. Fig. 5d shows the EIS plot of AC in the frequency range of 105 to 10−2 Hz. The Rs of 0.66 Ω and Rct of 0.1 Ω declare that the AC electrode has very small transfer resistance, manifesting the excellent characteristics of charge and ion transfer.

Fig. 6a shows the physical picture and schematic diagram illustrating the configuration of the ASC device. According to formula 2, the mass ratio of AC to CoAl LDHs is about 1.3:1 and that of AC to CoAl LDHs-0.5 is about 1.8:1, respectively. Thus, in the actual testing process, the mass loading (in milligrams) ratio of electrode materials in positive and negative electrodes is about 1.6:1.2 in CoAl LDHs//AC ASC and 1.6:0.9 in CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC. Then, the charge storage performances of the prepared ASC devices were also measured by CV and GCD methods. Fig. 6b presents the CV curves of CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under different voltage windows (0–1.6 V to 0–2.0 V), which hopes to get the maximum operating voltage window. It can be seen that the polarization of the curve becomes increasingly serious with the broadening of the operation voltage window. For the purpose of more accurately determination the operating voltage window, we conducted charge–discharge tests for different windows at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 6c).62 Combining CV and GCD tests of ASC, we believe that under 1.8 V, there is not only a CV curve with small polarization, but also an acceptable coulomb efficiency (discharge time divided by charging time). Therefore, 1.8 V is regarded as the testing voltage of our ASC devices. Fig. 6d reveals the CV curves of CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC at increasing scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1. The good symmetrical shapes at low scan rates indicate good reversibility of the prepared ASC device, and a slight alteration in the curve shape manifests good rate performance. Furthermore, the GCD plots of CoAl LDHs//AC and CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASCs were carried out under the current densities interval of 0.5 to 5 A g−1, and the consequences are contrastively shown in Fig. 6e. The out-of-straight charge–discharge plots again demonstrate the contribution of the pseudocapacitive process. In addition, the longer discharge time proves that CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC has better energy storage than CoAl LDHs//AC ASC. Fig. 6f exhibits the calculated specific capacitances under different current densities of CoAl LDHs//AC and CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASCs, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC presents much larger specific capacity and much higher rate capability than CoAl LDHs//AC. In addition, the relationship between the energy density and power density universally illustrated with the Ragone plot is shown in Fig. 6g, which equivalently transformed from the GCD results. The CoAl LDHs//AC ASC can deliver the greatest energy density of 13.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 527.0 W kg−1. Even the power density increased to 5006.3 W kg−1, and it still maintains an energy density of 10.0 W h kg−1. While for the CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC, it has the most prominent energy density of 28.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 523.5 W kg−1 and still possesses a commendable energy density of 25.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 5067.6 W kg−1. It can be distinctly compared from these mathematical values that our CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC is highly competitive in the CoAl LDHs-related ACSs such as CoAl LDHs//active graphene,63 CoAl LDHs//AG,64 rGO/CoAl-LDH//rGO,65 CoAl-LDH/GF//AEG66 and Co-Al LDHs/CNTs//AC,67 as shown in the inset in Fig. 6g.

Cyclic persistence is another important metric that must be considered in practical applications. Fig. 7a is the cyclic expression of CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC under 5000 galvanostatic charging–discharging processes at a current density of 5 A g−1. It is worth noting that the cycling retention can reach 73.3% of the initial value after 5000 cycles, which exhibits a superior cyclic stability. In addition, the coulombic efficiency is approximately 100% throughout the whole cyclic processes except for the first few cycles. Besides, the EIS testing of CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC before and after 5000 cycles was conducted to reveal the intrinsic transmission dynamics of charges and ions. It could be observed from Fig. 7b that the series resistance (Rs) is almost unchanged, while the transfer internal resistance (Rct) increases after 5000 cycles, which induces a reduction in specific capacity. Nevertheless, the smaller differences also account for better cycling characteristics.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the CoAl LDH electrode material has been referentially and successfully prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. The subsequent reductive processing increased the oxygen vacancy contents of the original CoAl LDH material. Based on the comprehensive analysis of XRD, TEM, XPS and EPR characterization results, we believe that the increase in vacancies disrupts the crystal and microcosmic structure of the CoAl LDHs, enhances the quantities of REDOX active sites and changes the transport route of electrons. Consequently, the electrochemical properties of the as-designed CoAl LDHs-0.5 electrode were improved distinctly. The maximum specific capacity of CoAl LDHs-0.5 is 799.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is approximately 1.4 times to original CoAl LDHs. Moreover, there is 81.1% capacity retention as the current density increases to a high value of 20 A g−1. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor packaged with CoAl LDHs-0.5 and commercial activated carbon delivers an energy density of 28.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 523.5 W kg−1, superior to most of the reported CoAl LDH-based ASC devices. In addition, the CoAl LDHs-0.5//AC ASC shows a good cycling stability with 73.3% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. These electrochemical correlation results indicated that CoAl LDHs-0.5 is an impressive choice for supercapacitor cathodic materials.
