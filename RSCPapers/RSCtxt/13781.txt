The fuel cell technology is attractive for its high-energy efficiency and expanded fuel flexibility and it became very relevant in the last decade. Moreover, the utilization of fuel cells for portable electronic devices has seen remarkable increase in the last few years. Performances of fuel cells, among others, strongly depend on the types of electrocatalysts and membrane, anion exchange or cation exchange, used in the system. Therefore, a status report about the latest advances in electrocatalysts and electrodes for portable fuel cells is the objective of this review paper.

1. Introduction
Currently, mankind is facing enormous energy and environmental problems that require urgent adoption of new energy supply technologies that utilize renewable energy sources. In this aspect, fuel cells are considered as one of the most promising efficient power generation technologies for a sustainable future.1 Such fuel cells, depending on the nature of the working fuel, can use either gaseous hydrogen or different liquids like alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol among others) or non-alcohols (formic acid, dimethyl ether, hydrazine, ammonia-borane and sodium borohydride), each type possessing its own advantages and disadvantages.2
Nevertheless, the technical targets for portable power sources set by the US Department of Energy, like specific power of 45–50 W kg−1, peak power density (PPD) of 55–70 W L−1 and a cost of 7–5 $ per W,3 are hard to achieve using current hydrogen and direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) and thus have not made sufficient progress in market presence yet. However, in terms of market implementation, among all the DAFCs, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are the most developed type, while the other types are placed in an advanced stage of research phase. For instance, in order to replace the state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries, Toshiba has invented the first prototype of a small DMFC system for a laptop computer, which can provide an average power output of 12 W with a cartridge weighing ca. 1 kg and operate continuously for at least 5 h.4
Therefore, fuel cell technologies may provide new solutions to portable power applications, to overcome current limitations in their autonomy and safety. Using hydrogen or alcohol as fuels, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have the appropriate characteristics for these objectives, like high power density, low working temperature, short start-up and shut-down times, and high efficiency.
As a difference from batteries, fuel cells exchange matter and heat with the surroundings, which determines their operation characteristics (see Fig. 1). The power response is largely limited by mass transport rates and depends on ambient conditions (temperature, humidity, orientation, natural convection) especially for air-breathing cathodes of PEMFCs. The design of the electrodes may palliate somewhat a slow start-up or large influence of the ambient environment, but, in general, fuel cells are less appropriate than batteries for some portable applications, like small and very low power devices, or for operation inside compact and closed environments. On the other hand, the same characteristic provides advantages to fuel cells with respect to batteries. There is a spatial separation between the energy storage and the power production which favours more flexible designs with no leakage currents, and makes them more suitable when requiring large autonomy, safety, or long-term energy storage. As a result, fuel cell systems will be increasingly advantageous when power and energy requirements of the portable applications increase above a few tens of W and W h. In some cases, hybrid systems comprising batteries (or capacitors) and fuel cells will be optimal, combining properties of both portable power types.

During the last 10 years, numerous companies developed hydrogen PEMFC and DAFC portable devices suitable to power military equipment in remote areas,6 power supplies for telecommunication base stations,7 backup power systems for an uninterruptible emergency power supply for security purposes, such as a police radio station and fire alarm system,8 power supplies to charge the equipment in an ambulance9 or even the entire vehicle,10 on-board battery charging of material handling vehicles,11 among others. Thus, the global fuel cell market size increases over time and reached an estimated value of ca. 10.48 billion $ in 2019, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ca. 15.5% until 2027.12 In this perspective, the prospect of fuel cells for portable applications is bright and more research is needed to advance the knowledge in this field.
This work provides a thorough revision of the most promising electrocatalytic materials for portable PEMFCs so far, including hydrogen (Section 2) and direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) using methanol (Section 3), ethanol (Section 4), and glycerol (Section 5). It will also provide a vision of new electrode and cell structures that should be used to improve the portability of these fuel cells (Section 6).
It should be noted that other fuels were also considered as alternatives for direct fuel cells, such as direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs), direct borohydride fuel cells (DBFCs) and direct formate fuel cells (DFFCs) as power supplies in portable applications, mainly due to their easy storage and transportation and to their high theoretical open circuit voltage.13–15 However, despite the huge potential of DFFC cells, they suffer from poor power output and very low durability, mainly due to the low kinetics of formic acid oxidation at low temperatures and formation of CO as a reaction product.16–18 For example, a peak power density of 550 mW cm−2 at 30 °C was obtained using a bifunctional Pd–Ni electrocatalyst, but with 16% loss of performance in only 4 h.19
DBFCs manage to avoid problems related to CO poisoning or poor oxidation kinetics, and exhibit performances about 1.3 times higher than PEMFCs or DMFCs. However, boron resources are limited and located mainly in Turkey, which makes it difficult to exploit them on a global scale.20 The use of formate as an alternative in DLFCs for practical applications is also in progress, and research is underway to overcome the issue of the efficiency of DFFCs that occurs after KOH removal.21
Thus, although constant efforts are made in order to increase the performance and the stability of these alternative fuel cells,22–24 the scope of the current review is to cover only the direct alcohol fuel cells in the category of direct liquid fuel cells.
2. Portable hydrogen–air fuel cells
2.1 Short overview
Portable applications of polymer electrolyte fuel cells are mainly centered on two large markets: the first one dedicated to portable power generators designed for light outdoor personal purposes (e.g. camping and climbing), while the second huge market is addressed to the consumer electronic devices, basically any electronic device that traditionally uses a battery such as laptops, cell phones, etc.
Powerful advantages such as the modularity and the high energy density of PEMFCs make them the most attractive candidates for future portable personal electronics. One can foresee applications as a support for any electronic device that can benefit from the DC power supply: battery charges, toys, kits in modern educational systems, gadgets, etc. Nevertheless, we have to emphasize that much progress should be achieved to strongly improve the performances in many fields such as electrocatalysis, costs, material synthesis routes, mass, heat transfer phenomena, etc.
Lithium batteries offer a power density of ∼200 W h kg−1. H2 fuel cells, in order to be competitive in the portable application sector, are expected to generate a higher power density due to the high reaction rate at the electrodes and proton transfer rate across the PEM. In PEM, with Nafion®-type membranes, the protons generated in the anode part pass into the cathode part through the membrane and the reactants and reaction products are very well separated in the cathode chamber and anode chamber respectively. This feature imposes restrictions on the operating temperature of these fuel cells. Thus, they cannot operate at temperatures above 80 °C (preferably 60–80 °C) at atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, it should be stressed that proper operation involves the use of hydrated fuels to avoid poisoning anodes with CO. Hydrogen fuels are generally obtained from the reformation of hydrocarbons (petrol and natural gas) and most often contain ∼1% CO which at low temperatures favours carbon deposition. Using a working temperature of ∼100 °C could be a solution and thus there is no need to hydrate the fuel at the anode. The development of an alternative PEM with high performance and good CO tolerance using low hydration conditions is still a challenge for the scientific community.
In many aspects the PEMFCs offer huge advantages for portable device applications, such as efficiency with high energy capacity, lightweight and straightforward construction, low cost, long life, etc.25,26 Indeed, power generation sources typically get the fuel directly through a small or light tank showing versatility and high potential towards miniaturization, an important criterion for home appliance applications.27,28 Obviously, applying fuel cells to replace conventional generators based on fossil fuels will reduce harmful atmospheric emissions and create cleaner environments with less noise pollution.
In the market of electronic devices, PEMFCs are appropriate for supplying the energy resources for individual gadgets such as netbooks, game consoles, cameras, television stations, educational packs, handheld chargers, and so on.29,30
A recent review on the portability of electricity summarized that hydrogen fuel cells (FCs) offer two advantages: (i) they provide new power generation properties, which are beneficial for those applications requiring high power and autonomy (stored energy), (ii) they can make renewable energies more accessible to portable applications of any type, with the highest efficiency and safety.5 One of the key issues of the research in this field is what new types of electrocatalysts can replace the commercial carbon black (CB) supported Pt ones in these systems on both anode and cathode side and what kind of properties the new materials can provide. Because the price of Pt accounts for a significant part of the cost of hydrogen-fed devices, it is very important to reduce the Pt content and to decrease the corrosion of the active metal. In order to achieve these goals, the development of the carbonaceous support seems to be a useful tool in parallel with the development of Pt-free electrocatalysts. The recent advances in these two aspects are presented further.
2.2 Mono- and bimetallic systems supported on new types of carbonaceous materials
New types of carbonaceous materials such as graphene (G) and its derivatives,31 especially reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) frequently obtained from graphite oxide (GO),32 furthermore carbon nanotubes (CNTs),31,33 ordered mesoporous carbon,33 and relatively cheap graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) have been regarded as promising new electrocatalyst supports for noble metals because of their favourable electronic properties, mechanical- and chemical stability and excellent corrosion resistance. Another promising approach is the utilization of Pt-containing bimetallic supported catalysts. Several examples of new types of electrocatalysts consisting of various carbonaceous materials and active metals for hydrogen FCs are collected in Table 1.

The following brief overview of the latest works presented in Table 1 focuses mainly on the preparation of supported metal nanoparticles and the peculiarities of the use of new types of carbonaceous materials used in PEMFCs.
In an early study on graphene materials, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited onto graphene sheets by means of borohydride reduction of H2PtCl6 in a graphene oxide (GO) suspension. Furthermore, GO–Pt film prepared for MEA was partially reduced with hydrazine. The latter was heat treated at 300 °C. Although about 80% enhancement in the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was achieved in the case of the reduced GO–Pt film after heat treatment, the fuel cell experiments showed a significant drop in power output which was explained by the loss of proton conductivity property of the Nafion® ionomer (used during the deposition of the electrocatalyst) due to its changes at higher temperature.34
Other preparation methods, for instance ethylene glycol (EG) reflux, sodium borohydride reduction and ascorbic acid reduction of H2PtCl6 for the preparation of supported Pt NPs were compared and the most promising results in terms of Pt dispersion, particle size, and electrocatalytic activity were obtained by use of the EG reflux.35 The authors found that the pH of the synthesis medium and the reflux environment greatly influenced the particle size, distribution, and related parameters of the supported Pt nanoparticles during EG reduction, which significantly influenced the cell performances.36 It is worth mentioning that the alkaline pH of the H2PtCl6 precursor solution was favourable.36,37
EG reduction method was found appropriate for the synthesis of Pt NPs both onto graphene derivatives35,38–40etc., pristine36 and different types of functionalized carbon nanotubes.41 Functional groups on the surface of the carbonaceous material play an important role in the anchoring of the metal NPs, that's why GO is successfully used in the preparation of metal NPs supported by graphene derivatives; furthermore, functionalization of carbon nanotubes and other carbonaceous materials is a key step.42
The microwave-assisted version of EG reduction was an effective synthesis method for the fabrication of supported Pt NPs.37,49,52 Comparison of the samples obtained by conventional heating (Pt/CNTs-CH), microwave heating (Pt/CNTs-MWH) and using commercial Pt/C (Pt/C) revealed that the microwave assisted Pt deposition resulted in the best fuel cell performance (see Table 1). According to the TEM measurements, smaller Pt nanoparticles appeared with a uniform distribution by the microwave assisted method which contributed to better performance (see Fig. 2).52

Successful one-pot synthesis of Pt electrocatalysts supported on novel hybrid structures with varying contents of GO and CB was also reported recently.35 Firstly, GO and CB were mixed homogeneously and then the Pt was loaded onto the hybrid support according to the polyol method by use of H2PtCl6 and EG. The one-pot synthesis represents a step forward for scaling up (see Fig. 3).35

In addition to the H2PtCl6 precursor, Pt NPs have been obtained from 1,5-dimethyl platinum cyclooctadiene (CODPtMe2) by use of the supercritical carbon dioxide deposition (scCO2) technique,44,46 and from tris(dibenzylideneacetone)platinum (Pt(dba)3) by use of an efficient and mild organometallic synthesis.47 Ultra-small Pt NPs (1.2 nm) were prepared from platinum(II) acetylacetonate in the presence of oleylamine and 1-octadecene by use of morpholine borane complex.45 Physical vapour deposition was used to form Pt NPs on a new type of graphene nanosheet–carbon nanotube (GNS–CNT) hybrid material which was synthesized by direct growth.50
Regarding the bimetallic catalysts, various methods for their preparation are described in the hydrogen-FC literature. Graphene-supported Pt3M (M = Co and Cr) alloy nanoparticles were prepared by the EG reduction method.54 Pt3M alloy cathodes exhibited better performance than Pt under fuel cell conditions, as depicted in Table 1. The high catalytic performance of Pt3M alloys was ascribed to the inhibition of the formation of (hydr)oxy species on the Pt surface by the alloying elements.
GNPs supported PtNi, PtFe, and PtCu bimetallic catalysts were prepared by the supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) technique by use of the Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic precursor for the primary metal and nickel(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate hydrate [Ni(hfac)2·H2O], copper(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate hydrate [Cu(hfa)2·H2O] and iron(III) tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate) [Fe(thd)3] precursors for the secondary metals (see Fig. 4). The best catalytic activity towards both hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was shown by the PtNi/GNP catalyst. The same catalyst exhibited the highest performance in the fuel cell experiments when it was used as the anode electrode.58

For the preparation of PtCu/CNT electrocatalysts,56 the Cu/CNT template was prepared first in the presence of NaBH4 reducing agent and CuSO4·5H2O by three different methods: (i) reverse microemulsion, (ii) chemical reduction and (iii) sonochemistry. Pt was deposited according to the following equation (eqn (1)): 3Cu/CNTsup + PtCl62− → Pt–Cu/CNTsup + 2Cu2+ + 6Cl−(1)
The highest mass catalytic activity was obtained in the case of the PtCu/CNTson, sample prepared by sonication.56 Multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) supported Pt–Au electrocatalyst was synthesized by use of the reverse microemulsion method which was scaled up to the preparation of MEA of 9 cm2.55 A microemulsion method was used in order to synthesize reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) supported Pt and Pt–Au nanoparticles, too.57
In addition to a variety of supported active metal particles, a similarly large variety of carbonaceous supports can be found in the recent literature on hydrogen FCs. The so-called “graphene” support was very often prepared from natural flake graphite by use of a strong oxidizing agent, most frequently by the modified Hummers' method,35,39,44,49,57etc. Although r-GO prepared by the reduction of functionalized graphene sheets significantly differs from the graphene from other sources in the disorder and number defective sites, this approach is beneficial for the stabilization of highly dispersed metal NPs.
A recent study compared the effectiveness of the different new types of carbonaceous materials as supports of electrocatalysts of hydrogen FCs.37 The different carbon supports did not significantly affect the Pt particle size during the synthesis, but led to different amounts of defective sites in the carbon framework so the availability of active metal sites and metal–support interactions were influenced. MWCNTs were found to be the most suitable carbon support for Pt catalysts because the Pt/MWCNT sample exhibited high activity and stability as a cathode in PEM fuel cells due to its Pt utilization efficiency and lower overpotential loss.37 In another study, the value of kinetic density current at 0.7 V was higher in Pt–Au/MWCNTs than in the Pt/C commercial material. It was concluded that MWCNTs as the support provided improved electronic charge transference compared to the traditional carbonaceous materials.55
The effectiveness of MWCNTs as an electrocatalyst support was enhanced by the wrapping of graphene around it. Carbon nanotubes in the above composite were well-separated and the highly dispersed MWCNTs through anchoring sites contributed to the homogeneous deposition of ultra-nano Pt particles over the composites.53
Pt catalysts supported by the GNS–CNT hybrid type of carbonaceous material exhibited superior performance in hydrogen FC tests. High catalytic utilization of Pt was explained by the uniform dispersion of nanoscopic Pt nanoparticles on the GNS which was reflected in the high ECSA values. GNS provided high surface area while CNTs decreased the mass transport limitations of the composite. Besides, CNS-CNTs were grown directly on carbon cloth providing a direct electron-transfer pathway and reducing energy losses between interfaces.50
The performance of graphene itself as a catalyst support has often been found to be less favourable than that of other carbon materials, including conventional CB,37,45 but there are some exceptions.43 The comparison may be complicated by the fact that many other parameters have to be the same for correct conclusions about the effect of the carbonaceous support, e.g. metal load, particle size distribution, metal–support-interaction, etc. It is generally accepted that due to the 2D dense structure of the G or r-GO support, strong mass transport limitations and relatively low Pt utilization are found in this type of catalysts. However, the examples shown in Table 1 illustrate that hybrid supports created by combining different types of carbonaceous materials are able to provide better results than the parent carbonaceous material alone. Use of hybrids of G, r-GO, and GNPs47 with MWCNTs, with differently functionalized MWCNTs,41,51 and even with CB led to enhanced maximum power density in the hydrogen FC experiments. When porous Pt–graphene/MWCNT composite cathodes were fabricated from the G supported Pt catalyst and from acid treated MWCNTs the maximum power density of the composite supported Pt was four fold, although the ECSA of the Pt in the Pt–graphene/MWCNT composite cathode was only slightly larger than that for the Pt in the Pt–graphene cathode.49
Several studies have also shown that the proportion of components in hybrid carbon supports strongly influences the performance of the electrocatalysts.35,38,41,51 As an example, the combination of 2D acid functionalized graphene (f-G) and 1D acid functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-MWNTs) in equal proportion as a catalyst support for 3D Pt NPs gave the best performance due to the good accessibility and uniform dispersion of the nanostructured Pt.51 Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of hybridized Pt/rGO-MWCNT samples with different mass ratios of rGO and MWCNTs41 indicated significant morphological differences (see Fig. 5) which led to a variety of electrocatalytic performances (see Table 1).

Other ways of producing the 3D structure have also proven to be effective. For instance, when graphene was intercalated by nano-B4C ceramic, the electrochemical activity and stability of the Pt catalyst greatly improved as the Pt–r-GO/B4C electrode had superior mass transfer capability for reaction species than the Pt–r-GO electrode.59
The improvement effect of the spacer components was shown even when new types of carbonaceous materials were layered during the preparation of the MEA. As some examples, the hybrid cathode layer built from commercial Pt/C catalyst and r-GO supported Au NPs62 or I-doped graphene60,61 was able to increase the maximum power density.
The beneficial effect of I-doped graphene was attributed to that the chemical iodination increased the charge carrier concentration in the π-band of graphene layers, favouring the obtaining of a metallic nature. It reduced the resistance in PEMFCs as well as facilitated oxygen transport toward catalytic sites without severe water flooding.61 CNTs and Pt–Au/CNTs were used as spacers during the preparation of MEA for FC experiments.57 Pt/rGO and Pt–Au/rGO catalysts without a spacer showed moderate performance as the graphene-based support did not facilitate the elimination of the water flooding and the dense structure of the GDL was not adequate for the diffusion of the gases. The introduction of the spacer improved the structure, the ohmic resistance and the metal dispersion of the GDL. As a result the maximum power density value of the Pt–Au/rGO increased 1.8 and 5.2 times, when CNTs and Pt–Au/CNT spacer were used.57
A strong argument in favour of the use of graphene and carbon nanotube-based catalyst supports is that they have been shown to be more resistant to corrosion and thus can provide durability. The addition of a small amount of the Pt/GO catalyst significantly enhanced the durability of the commercial Pt/C catalyst without sacrificing the initial ECSA.40 Pt/graphene catalyst was considered more advantageous than traditional carbon supported Pt, because GO derived graphene maintained strong adhesion with Pt particles and provided strong corrosion resistance.39 CNTs exhibited a remarkable catalytic stability up to 30000 cycles; its FC performance significantly exceeded that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst.56 However, a number of other solutions are being sought to achieve durability by modifying the carbon support. In a recent work Pt/C electrocatalyst was treated with vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) and phosphoric acid to produce Pt/C-VO(H2PO4)2 catalyst.63 This combination improved the durability of proton exchange membrane fuel cells because it reduced the oxidation of the cathode catalyst in the weak acid environment.63
2.3 Platinum-free electrocatalysts
The limited reserves of platinum in the Earth's crust motivated researchers to develop PEMFCs with platinum free electrocatalysts with better performances and stability.
An original approach related to the catalyst's design for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) was recently published by Reuillard et al.64 They developed a novel catalyst for HOR by using graphene acid (GA) nanosheets for the noncovalent immobilization of a bioinspired nickel bis-diphosphine [NiII(P2CyN2Arg)2]7+ (NiArg). The GA-modified electrodes were prepared through vacuum filtration and coated with a hydrophobic microporous layer. The current densities were above 30 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under acidic aqueous conditions and at room temperature. This unique class of bidirectional molecular catalysts exhibits electrocatalytic activity for H2/H+ interconversion. The optimization of the catalytic layers is underway, taking into account the prevention of leaching, maximization of the number of active sites by increasing the film thickness with retention of high porosity, prevention of electrode flooding by the rationalized formulation as well as improvement of the anode stability over long time operation. The schematic representation of the functionalization process of GA is shown in Fig. 6.

Allerston et al.65 prepared a PdIrAu/C ternary alloy catalyst supported on carbon by a sol-immobilisation method, involving polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the dispersant, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the reducing agent and Vulcan XC-72R as the support. The MEAs were developed by standard EU protocol tests, which include leak tests, cell break-in, conditioning, polarisation curves and load cycles (AST). They highlighted the effect of composition on the electrochemical performance in the HOR. Thus, at 0.6 V after 1000 AST cycles the PdIrAu/C catalyst exhibits performance enhancement by 36%, proved by the current density of 1100 mA cm−2 compared with 700 mA cm−2 obtained for PdIr/C. Also, the Au addition led to a more stable anode for the HOR, as confirmed by the results from the ICP-MS measurements.
Pu et al.66 proposed a facile and scalable synthesis strategy for precious-metal phosphides (PMPs) supported on graphene (rGO) catalysts (IrP2–rGO, Rh2PrGO, RuP–rGO, and Pd3P–rGO) electrochemically active in the HOR in H2-saturated 0.1 M perchloric acid media using a half-cell. They obtained a remarkable HOR activity. The results indicated that the IrP2–rGO performance was very close to that of the 20 wt% Pt/C commercial powder and they recommend this catalyst as an excellent candidate for the applications of water electrolysers and PEMFCs.
Recently, Park et al.67 developed a system which facilitated rapid testing and characterization of platinum group metal-free (PGM free) catalysts. As a non-platinum catalyst for the ORR they used iron–cyanamide–polyaniline–zinc catalyst ((CM + PANI)–Fe–C(Zn)) from Los Alamos National Laboratory. This system was able to assess the performance of the 25 PEMFC electrodes (Fig. 7).

An automated deposition system assured deposition of the crack-free PGM-free catalyst electrode layer with uniform thickness, without large agglomerates, and with good adhesion to the membrane. By using this procedure the system can make robust PGM-free electrodes over the entire electrode area and the membrane does not deteriorate (see Fig. 8).

The main aim of their work was to boost the scientific progress and practical implementation of PGM-free catalysts as valuable replacements for the currently used high cost platinum-based catalysts. Indeed, this is one of the main obstacles to the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs in automotive and stationary applications, accounting for ∼40% of the total cost of the PEMFC stack.
They studied the effect of the ink composition on the power density obtained. They used different ionomer to catalyst ratios and different isopropanol (IPA)/water ratios. The combinatorial analysis revealed that an I/C of 0.5 (33 wt%) gives the highest H2–air cell performance at <0.65 V while an I/C of 1 (50 wt%) gives the highest performance at >0.65 V. On the other hand, the highest overall performance was achieved by using an IPA to water ratio of 3:7.
Nabae et al.68 prepared non-precious metal (NPM) catalysts for the ORR by the pyrolysis of spherical polyimide nanoparticles that contain small amounts of Fe additive with diameters around 60 nm. They optimized the synthesis conditions (precursor and polymerization conditions) in order to decrease the size of the polyimide particles. Thus, the synthesis protocol involved the use of a triamine monomer, 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB), instead of ODA in the presence of a dispersant as well as a carbonization process by multistep pyrolysis where the Fe species catalyses carbonization up to 600 °C. They removed the excess of Fe species to minimize the loss of nitrogen species at higher temperature. They detected by XPS the nitrogen chemical species (N-pyridinic, N-pyrrolic, N-graphitic and N-oxidized) which are catalytically active sites for the ORR. The authors tested the cathode performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at 80 °C using humidified hydrogen into the anode side and fully humidified oxygen or air into the cathode side. The best performance 0.62 V (O2) and 0.46 V (air) at a current density of 1 A cm−2 was achieved in open circuit voltages of 0.94 V (O2) and 0.90 V (air), for the cathode with smaller particle size. Also, a new facile template method for the preparation of Ni, Co doped ZrO2 self-assembled electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction was published.69 The results indicate that the synergetic effects arising from the intimate electronic interaction of the mixed oxides present in the lattice of the zirconia phase, i.e. Ni1−xCoxO (or NiO and CoO), enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the electrocatalyst.
Preda et al.70 established a versatile synthesis protocol based on a self-assembly co-templated by diethanolamine (DEA) and tripropylamine (TPA) to obtain graphene-modified NiCo2O4–NiO catalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The formation of the different Ni species with 3+/2+ oxidation states, proved by XPS, into a cubic spinel NiCo2O4 structure as well as the presence of the tiny amount of NiO as the secondary phase contributes to the creation of efficient active sites and enhances the conductivity. On the other hand, the electrochemical results revealed the beneficial role of the graphene addition, with an optimum amount of 10 wt%, which was able to facilitate improved mass transport, supplied more accessible active sites, and provided higher stability and better resistance to deactivation during the ORR. The synthesis route might be successfully used for large-scale applications due to its outstanding features, such as low cost, easy availability and straightforward control of the phase composition.
Banham et al.71 reported, for the first time, a pre-commercial nonprecious metal catalyst (NPMC) based MEA capable of meeting commercial performance requirements for PEMFC portable power applications. The catalyst synthesis involved the use of the polyacrylonitrile-polymethacrylic acid copolymer, 2-methylimidazole, zinc chloride (ZnCl2) as the inorganic precursor and dimethylformamide as the solvent. The raw material obtained after drying under vacuum and thermal treatment at 220 °C for 3 hours was carbonized to 1100 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 hour. They obtained high current densities (up to 1.5 A cm−2) using a microporous catalyst >90% (nearly all pores <3 nm) and optimized the ionomer amount of the higher catalyst loading design. Thus, they achieved the highest power ever reported in air/H2 in a large-scale (50 cm2) NPMC-based MEA (570 mW cm−2). Their study involved a rational catalyst layer design and thus the catalyst-level transport problems were overcome.
Chung et al.72 assessed the H2–air performance of the iron–nitrogen–carbon catalyst with hierarchical porosity prepared using two nitrogen precursors. They achieved a maximum power density of 400 mW cm−2 at 100 kPa H2–air, 353 K operation temperature as well as 90 mA cm−2 current density at 0.8 V.
Chandran et al.73 prepared a hybrid carbon hetero-structure based on partially oxidized carbon nanotubes (POCNTs) and PCNTs by the modified Hummers' method using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) synthesized by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). PCNTs possessed an accessible surface area of 125 m2 g−1 measured by BET and assures good electrical conductivity. The catalyst was obtained by decoration of the support with Pd3Co alloy nanoparticles by the polyol reduction method. The performance of the MEA fuelled by H2 and O2 was assessed by using Pd3Co/PCNTs at the anode and separately at the cathode, as well as simultaneously at both the anode and cathode. The best PEMFC performance of 327 mW cm−2 was achieved when the Pd3Co/PCNT catalyst was employed as the anode in a H2 atmosphere. By using Pd3Co/PCNT as cathode fed by O2, they obtained a power density of 240 mW cm−2. A very important aspect of this study is related to the performance of the single cell, which is completely free from Pt, tested using a fuel cell test station. The power density of 96 mW cm−2 obtained for the cell developed with both electrodes simultaneously put in light the advantage of the low cost as well as the potential applications for small portable devices.
Supported Pt-based nanoparticles are currently the state-of-the-art catalysts used for PEFC manufacturing but according to a recent analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy, about 42% of the production cost is due to platinum (Pt). Thus, platinum group metal (PGM)-free catalysts that enable the ORR in PEFCs offer a large room for cost savings and clearly represent alternative catalyst materials. Recently, Osmieri et al.74 proposed a powerful method aiming to boost both material discovery and electrode development in the field of PGM-free catalysts. The authors targeted the screening and optimization of the parameters by using a high-resolution, high throughput segmented cell (SC) accommodating more than 120 segments. Thus, the method is able to discern the high performing candidates as well as the trends in the electrode optimization process. In addition, for more accurate results the authors checked the data reproducibility for the electrodes with identical catalyst materials and fabrication methods.
Serov et al.75 recently developed a mesoporous PGM-free Fe–N–C catalyst by using a synthesis method based on nitrogen-rich organic precursors and two types of silica sacrificial substrate. The presence of the N species such as pyridinic, hydrogenated pyrrolic and hydrogenated pyridine as well as the nitrogen coordinated to metal (Fe) was proved by XPS. The electrochemical performance of the MEA in H2/air at the temperature of the cell of 80 °C with 100% RH was comparable to those of the state-of-the-art catalysts developed by the group.
2.4 Single atom electrocatalysts
Development of single atom catalysts/single atom electrocatalysts (SACs/SAECs) which is a relatively new, dynamic research area in the field of energy conversion, i.e. batteries and fuel cells, has already aroused great interest.76–81 SACs combine the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. SACs are based on heteroatom (N, S, etc.)-doped carbon materials anchoring single metal atoms through coordination with defects, N-containing groups or unsaturated coordination sites. Since in the case of “traditional” catalysts obtained from platinum group metals (PGMs) the ORR occurs on the surface of the nanoparticles (NPs), any metal atoms that cannot be approached by the reactant molecules are largely a waste. SACs, due to the high density of well-defined active sites dispersed in their skeleton, exhibit not only the maximum utilization efficiency but also high catalytic activity and selectivity towards the ORR process. Depending on the type of isolated active metal atom the different categories of SACs for the ORR have been distinguished:77 (i) precious metal single atom catalysts (Pt-based-, Ir-based single atom catalysts); (ii) non-precious metal single atom catalysts (Co-based-, Fe-based-, Mn-based single atom catalysts, Fe–Co-, Fe–Ni dual-metal single atom catalysts, Pt–Co alloy and single atom synergistic catalysts).
Several examples of SACs applied for hydrogen fuelled PEMFCs are shown in Table 2.

Different methods can be used for the synthesis of SACs; Han et al. proposed the following possibilities: (i) wet chemical methods (impregnation, modular coordination method, colloidal strategy, electrochemical deposition, low-temperature reduction method, ion exchange method); (ii) high-temperature pyrolysis methods (MOF (most frequently ZIF-8, a Zn-rich zeolitic imidazolate framework) based encapsulation pyrolysis, molten salt-assisted pyrolysis, polymer pyrolysis, metal–organic complex pyrolysis); (iii) vapour deposition method (atomic layer deposition-ALD, chemical vapour deposition-CVD); (iv) atom trapping method.78
The M–N–C (M: metal atom) catalysts are very often synthesized through pyrolysis, where a nitrogen containing organic precursor and metal precursor are mixed and are subsequently heated in an inert atmosphere. A general scheme for the synthesis of M–N–C type of SACs is given in Fig. 9.

The success or failure of the formation of SACs is often influenced by “nuances”, such as order of the component addition and heat treatment which led to simultaneous coordination (sample PM/ZIF-simu) or sequential coordination (sample PM/ZIF-seq) as can be seen in Fig. 10.

The optimal morphology resulting in high specific surface area and rich porosity of the catalysts increases the exposure of the active sites, which is important to guarantee their sufficient utilization. As an example, ZIF-8 derived nitrogen and atomic Fe dual-doped porous carbon nanocubes (Fig. 11) showed outstanding performance.

The porous carbon nanocubic architecture with high specific surface area and with abundant Fe–Nx active species in the nitrogen doped carbon matrix resulted in a very effective cathode catalyst (PCN-A@Fe SA).96
Although catalysts derived from Fe-doped ZIF-8 could in theory be as active as Pt/C thanks to the high intrinsic activity of FeN4, the micropores fail to achieve rapid mass transfer.92 Therefore, Qiao et al. built an ordered hierarchical porous structure into Fe-doped ZIF-8 single crystals, which were subsequently carbonized to obtain an FeN4-doped hierarchical ordered porous carbon (FeN4/HOPC) skeleton.92 In real PEMFC tests the optimal catalyst (FeN4/HOPC-c-1000) exhibited significantly enhanced current density and power density relative to FeN4/C, which did not have an optimized pore structure.92
Non precious metal SACs are very promising candidates to replace the traditional precious-metal catalysts that are applied in the cathode of PEMFCs although many problems and challenges still remain, such as the poor stability/durability in acidic PEM surroundings, caused by the dissolution of doped Fe/Co, carbon corrosion, and protonation of the active sites.79
However, Pt SACs exhibited better stability than their traditional nanoparticulated counterparts if divided into single atoms, as demonstrated by the results of complementary techniques, including online ICP-MS, IL-TEM, and XPS.97 Nevertheless, more stable supports and dopants must be found in order to develop more robust Pt SACs.97
Recent contributions in the field using powerful tools for synthesis and analysis as well as Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach exhibit very promising results as can be demonstrated with the following examples. A cross-correlation of the experimental and theoretical results is of paramount importance and will shed more light on the SOFC field, in general and PGM-free materials, in particular. Thus recently, Holby et al.98 used DFT based approaches as a powerful theoretical tool for a comprehensive understanding of the structures at their atomic scale and their role in ORR activity as well as the active site structure stability in the PGM-free materials. The authors deeply examined the application of the aforementioned approach to an Fe–N4 bilayer graphene-hosted active site structure suggesting solutions to improve the active site resistance to metal dissolution in correlation with the trends in stability with respect to alkaline and acidic conditions.
A recent theoretical study published by Cao et al.,99 in line with the aforementioned publication, performs DFT calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to explore the influence of the solvation effect (as the ORR is operated in the liquid phase) on the mechanisms of the ORR on MnN4–graphene. As these kinds of studies offer detailed information for understanding the reaction mechanisms, one can foresee an acceleration of the experimental results in the field of PGM-free catalysts due to their excellent catalytic capabilities.
Xie et al.100 provided a recent and comprehensive study on “Performance enhancement and degradation mechanism identification of a single-atom Co–N–C catalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cells”. The accuracy and reliability of the obtained results are achieved by coupling the electrochemical measurements with the well-established complementary bulk and surface characterization methods (XRD, XPS, ICP-OES, N2 adsorption, STEM, XANES and EXAFS with synchrotron radiation) and first principles DFT calculations. Thus, the authors offer a model and a guide for the use of these powerful tools in the catalysis field, in general and PEM fuel cells, in particular.
In a recently published paper, Cheng et al.101 presented a template-free method to synthesise high density iron single atoms anchored on carbon nanotubes for high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells following the same goal: to find promising materials aiming to replace precious and expensive Pt catalysts for the ORR in PEMFCs. Their results were demonstrated in an HT-PEMFC, delivering a peak power density of 266 mW cm−2 and excellent stability at 240 °C using anhydrous H2 as the fuel. The authors claim that their method provides a facile and practical route for developing highly efficient PGM-free catalysts for HT-PEMFCs. A comparison with a Pt/C standard was performed with the result that their proposed sample (atomic iron homogeneously supported on CNTs with loading up to 3.5 wt%) shows increased stability and a better tolerance to PA poisoning.
3. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs)
3.1 Short overview
For portable power applications, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have gained much interest since they are more viable candidates compared to PEMFCs due to the higher energy density of alcohol, compact configuration and convenient operation. There have been several studies giving an overview of the various aspects of DMFCs including membranes, diffusion layers, plates and catalysts, although many factors must be resolved before they can be commercialized.102,103 Regarding DMFCs, crossover of methanol through the membrane from the anode side to the cathode side, water loss, and water recycling are issues that affect the volume, weight, and complexity of these devices.104,105 Such factors become of greater concern as the size of the DMFC decreases. In this respect, crossover of methanol is just one of the barriers to the commercialization of DMFCs.
As already mentioned, electrocatalysts are key components of a fuel cell, on which anodic (alcohol or hydrogen oxidation) and cathodic (oxygen reduction) reactions take place. For a DMFC, optimal electrocatalysts are required to achieve high activity in methanol oxidation and the oxygen reduction reaction, for the anode and cathode, respectively; in addition, they should have good long-term stability, adequate electrical conductivity, and an affordable price. Although significant efforts are made worldwide in developing novel electrocatalysts for fuel cells, state-of-the-art systems still use expensive Pt/C catalysts even though they are prone to electrocorrosion under the operating conditions of the cell.106,107 Corrosion results in either Pt dissolution or oxidation of the carbon support leading to detachment, Ostwald ripening and agglomeration of platinum nanoparticles.108,109 The consequence of both processes is the loss of the active surface of the catalysts. In practice, this activity loss is compensated by very high Pt loadings, which keeps the price of the PEM fuel cells high.
Another issue of the traditional Pt/C catalysts is their sensitivity for CO poisoning, as it causes a significant performance loss.110 It should be noted that according to generally accepted pathways CO is supposed to be one of the intermediates of electrooxidation of different alcohols. Therefore, high tolerance to CO and other methanol oxidation byproducts is one of the criteria for the preparation of efficient catalysts for DMFCs.111 Thus, although carbon black supported Pt catalysts are commercially available in large quantities with reliable quality, it is important to explore alternative materials that can provide improved stability and increased CO tolerance. The state-of-the-art commercial CO-tolerant electrocatalyst contains Pt–Ru alloy nanoparticles on an active carbon support.112–114
In general, the introduction of a second oxophilic metal facilitates easy oxidation of the CO via the so-called bifunctional mechanism, provided the atomic closeness between the oxophilic sites and Pt is ensured.115–117 However, it is well known that oxophilic metal-containing catalysts become unstable at high potentials, which leads to serious deterioration of the catalytic activity.117
Thus, the major drawback of DMFC commercialization is the lack of an inexpensive catalyst and membrane with sufficiently high and stable performance. It is necessary to mention that with regard to the catalysts, most of the reviews mainly summarize the results of testing electrocatalysts under the given operating conditions, and have paid less attention to the design and the methods of preparation of catalysts and their supports. In the literature there is a huge amount of research devoted to the development of new electrocatalytic systems that can be promising candidates for use in DMFCs. However, most of these studies are carried out in a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell. This section will summarize the performance of various Pt-based electrocatalysts evaluated using DMFC tests.
There are two basic types of DMFCs: passive and active DMFCs.102,118 An active system of DMFC is suitable for portable applications due to its high power output. Compared to the active DMFC, the self-breathing DMFC with an open cathode structure has many unique advantages such as simple structure, small size, light weight, high energy density, low operating temperature, and high security, since the use of the complex auxiliary equipment system can be avoided.119 It is highly competitive in the small-scale energy market.
3.2 Noble metal-based catalysts used in passive system DMFCs
Passive DMFCs operate without the help of external devices for pumping methanol and blowing air into the cell. Oxygen thus diffuses into the cathode from the ambient air by a kind of air-breathing action of the cell, and methanol diffuses into the anode from a built-in feed reservoir driven by a concentration gradient between the anode and the reservoir.118,120
However, it also has several disadvantages, such as poor discharge performance and poor stability, which prevent it from being widely used in commercial DMFC applications. Ensuring long-term stable operation of the DMFC is absolutely essential for commercial applications, and the reason for performance degradation is a key research point influenced by Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) preparation and operating conditions. Unsupported catalysts or metal blacks are mainly utilized in systems operating in passive mode, that is, without any air blowers or fuel circulating pumps, such as in portable electronic applications.121–123
Several examples of new types of electrocatalysts used in passive system DMFCs are presented in Table 3.

As was mentioned above, nanostructured PtRu material is considered as the best catalyst for DMFCs, but the performance decay resulting from Ru loss seriously hinders the commercial application. The results presented in ref. 119 showed that Ru dispersion, membrane swelling and water flooding were the main reasons for the performance decline of the PtRu black-JM anode. It has been demonstrated that the degradation of Pt black-JM, used as the cathode, was less serious than that of the anode and it could be recovered. In this study, the traditional equivalent circuit model of self-breathing DMFCs was modified according to the fact that the dielectric relaxation phenomenon of porous electrodes occurred at the cathode rather than at the anode.
In the preparation of the MEA, simply adding nanoparticles of magnesium oxide as a sacrificial template to the catalytic layer (CL) and the microporous layer (MPL) in the anode led, after dissolution of MgO in acidic solution, to the formation of a porous structure of the anode.124 The improved performance of the novel MEA can be ascribed to the increased electrochemical surface area, decreased charge-transfer resistance as well as efficient mass transfer of methanol after the formation of the porous structure in the anode. The present work provides a very simple but very effective way to reduce the dosage of the noble metal catalysts for fuel cells.
The membranes constructed from sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate adsorbed holey graphene oxides (SDBS-HGO)s and used as PEMs for air-breathing DMFC applications showed much higher electrochemical performance and better stability than that with Nafion® 112.125
The better performance of the SDBS-HGO paper was attributed to the specific holey structure of graphene oxide (see Scheme 1), which provides comparable proton conductivity and lower methanol permeability in comparison to the commercial Nafion® 112.

Chen et al. demonstrated the preparation by the electrospinning technique of novel MEAs with a nanofiber network catalytic layer (NNCL) structure in the anode of a passive DMFC, which resulted in significant reduction in noble metal catalyst loading.126
It should be noted that electrospinning is a very useful technique that allows the formation of continuous nanofibers with high surface area, remarkable porosity, permeability, superior chemical stability, high strength, mechanical flexibility, etc.127 The experimental design for the electrospinning technique used to fabricate the nanofiber mat electrode is presented in Scheme 2.128

The nanofibers are collected as a mat on carbon paper or directly on a collector drum. Reproduced with permission from ref. 128, Copyright 2011 Wiley Publications. 
When the PtRu (1:1) loading within the NNCL was 1.0 mg cm−2, the maximum power density of a DMFC was even slightly higher than that with a conventional MEA with a PtRu loading of 2.0 mg cm−2. Electrochemical tests show that such an NNCL exhibited a great increase in catalyst utilization and a decrease in the charge-transfer resistance of the anode in comparison with the conventional MEA.
The results of the optimization process involving a screening process followed by response surface methodology (RSM) were used for the single DMFC performance testing of the PtRu/TiO2-CNF anode electrocatalyst.129 TiO2 and carbon-containing composite support with a TiO2-CNF nanofibre structure was prepared via an electrospinning technique.134 The optimum parameters suggested by RSM are a PtRu composition of 30.25 wt% and a catalyst loading of 0.59 mg cm−2, resulting in almost perfect agreement between the measured current density (603.06 mA mgPtRu−1) and the predicted value (600.63 mA mgPtRu−1). The current density obtained in this study is the highest among other research studies in the same field.
From an economic viewpoint, the actual cost of Sn, which can also be used as a second oxophilic metal, is much lower than that of Pt or Ru. PtSn/C-PANI electrocatalysts with different Pt/Sn atomic ratios supported on polyaniline fiber (PANI)-containing Vulcan-polyaniline (C-PANI) composite were synthesized in ref. 130. Use of the PtSn (70:30)/C-PANI as an alloy type anode catalyst, instead of commercial PtRu/C, in a passive DMFC resulted in decrease of methanol crossover by about 30% and displayed significant CO tolerance as well as high electrocatalytic activity and stability toward methanol oxidation.
In ref. 131 nano-sized MnO2, used as a co-catalyst, was deposited on reduced graphene sheets along with Pt nanoparticles. In situ carbonization using L-ascorbic acid as the carbon source was employed to boost the performance of the catalyst, where the carbon riveted Pt–MnO2/rGO-L catalyst showed not only larger electrochemical surface area and better catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation, but also revealed stronger ability to resist CO poisoning and better stability than Pt–MnO2/rGO and Pt/rGO catalysts. The improvement of the catalyst performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect that developed between MnO2 and Pt and the anchoring effect of L-ascorbic acid.
It should be noted that in the case of a passive micro DMFC (μDMFC), most of the research work has focused only on the evaluation of structural aspects and performance-related operating conditions. Such studies are usually carried out on commercially available PtRu (anode) and Pt (cathode) catalysts. Thus, Wang et al.132 recently systematically investigated the influence of many variables, including the hot-press conditions, current collector channel patterns, current collector open ratios, and their effect on passive μDMFC performance through experimentation and simulation.
In ref. 133, a tailored and low-cost MEA, using the materials available in the market, was proposed to achieve higher performances working under higher methanol concentrations. Despite the reduced loadings of both anode and cathode catalysts (PtRu: 3 mg cm−2 and Pt: 1.3 mg cm−2, respectively), the maximum power density of 3.00 mW cm−2 was achieved using a methanol concentration of 5 M and carbon cloth with a dual-layer structure, as the anode diffusion layer.
The optimized fabrication, assembly and operation parameters shed light on the design considerations necessary for the wide adaptation of high-performance and durable DMFCs for portable applications.
3.3 Noble metal-based catalysts used in active system DMFCs

3.3.1 Challenges in using PtRu-based electrocatalysts. Effect of the type of carbonaceous materials. 
In this subsection the most important challenges arising from the use of Pt-based electrocatalysts in the active type of DMFCs are summarized. These results were obtained using commercially available and in-house developed Pt–Ru catalysts on the anode side and Pt on the cathode side. Features of the application of unsupported and carbon supported PtRu anode catalysts as well as the influence of the type of carbonaceous support materials on the DMFC performance are presented in Table 4.

The micro direct methanol fuel cell (MicroDMFC) is an emerging technology due to its special potential for portable applications.120 The maximum power output obtained at room temperature using an active metallic MicroDMFC with an active area of 2.25 cm2 was 18.1 mW cm−2 for a hot-pressed MEA using materials purchased from Quintech with very low catalyst loading (3 mg cm−2 Pt–Ru black at the anode side and 0.5 mg cm−2 Pt black at the cathode side) costing around 15 euros.135
The effect of the organic solvent polarity on the performance of the catalyst layers prepared with them for methanol electrooxidation has been studied.136 The current densities for PtRu black anode catalyst layers in single DMFCs are higher when the solvent is n-butyl acetate (NBA), the mass transport limitations being much more apparent with 2-propanol (IPA). It has been demonstrated that the proton resistance for NBA is significantly lower than for IPA, thus suggesting that the larger number of accessible active sites for methanol oxidation in the former are well connected to the Nafion® ionomers and more easily transported to the membrane.
The results presented in ref. 137 indicated that the agglomeration of the metal particles of the commercial Pt–Ru/C-JM anode electrocatalysts was more serious than that of the Pt/C-JM cathode. About 30% of the maximum power density was lost after the 75 h life cycle test, compared with the initial peak value of 66 mW cm−2. The results indicated that the agglomeration of electrocatalysts and the delamination of the MEA concurrently contribute to the performance degradation of the DMFC.
The results presented in Table 4 also demonstrate the importance of choosing the most efficient loading method for Pt and Ru, leading to a high degree of alloying and homogeneous distribution over a carbon support.
PtRu black and PtRu/C with a nominal Pt:Ru atomic ratio of 1:1 have been prepared by a modified polyol process (co-reduction of metal precursor salts with ethylene glycol) for DMFCs, and the effects of the carbon support, alloying degree and unalloyed Ru on the catalysts' activities have been investigated.138 It has been demonstrated that without the carbon support, PtRu nanoparticles tend to agglomerate, while the PtRu nanoparticles in PtRu/C have a good dispersion.
PtRu/C nanocatalyst prepared by maintaining the molar ratio of citric acid (CA) to platinum and metallic ruthenium salts CA/PtRu = 1:1, gave a smaller particle size (2.6 nm) with a homogeneous distribution over a carbon support compared to experiments performed with an increased CA content (CA/PtRu = 2:1, 3:1, 4:1).139 Testing of the PtRu/C catalysts at the anode of a DMFC indicated that the in-house developed PtRu/C nanocatalyst gave a slightly higher performance than did the commercial E-TEK catalyst.
It has been demonstrated by Xu et al.140 that the activity of the nanostructured PtRu/C catalyst prepared from a water-in-oil pseudomicroemulsion with the aqueous phase of a mixed concentrated solution of H2PtCl6, RuCl3 and carbon powder, oil phase of cyclohexane, ionic surfactant of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (C18H29NaO3S) and co-surfactant n-butanol is much higher than that of PtRu nanoparticles prepared with nonionic surfactants.
The importance of using novel carbonaceous support materials with appropriate porosity, high specific surface area and good conductivity to provide superior stability and corrosion resistance to electrocatalysts has already been mentioned in Section 2.2.
In ref. 141, different commercially available carbons have been tested with respect to both thermal and electrochemical activity/stability as support materials for dispersed Pt nanoparticles. Despite the fact that the best results for the ORR activity and stability tests were obtained on Pt catalysts supported on mesoporous graphitized nanoparticles (GNP500) and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), from a practical and financial point of view, the relatively cheap spherical mesoporous GNP500 was preferred to the very expensive two-dimensional structure of the OMC.
Better performance of the mesoporous carbon supported PtRu catalyst compared to PtRu/Vulcan, exhibiting a wider range of operating current, was demonstrated by Bruno et al.142 Moreover, an improvement in the mass transport was observed for the catalyst supported on mesoporous carbon, yielding a lower voltage drop at high current density.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) can also be used efficiently as metal supports in fuel cell electrodes in order to replace the classically used carbon blacks.143 Because of their special structure, CNFs combine two properties that rarely coexist in a material: high mesoporosity and high electrical conductivity.144
Vapour-grown carbon fibers (VGCFs) were added to the anode catalyst layer of a DMFC to improve the cell performance through structural modification of the catalyst layer.145 A catalyst layer with 2 wt% VGCF loading showed the best cell performance. The nanosized scale carbon fibers provided a high surface area with low micropore content. This can enhance mass transport through the electrocatalyst layers, which in turn enhances the electrochemical performance.
It has been proposed that VGCF can be effective in increasing the amount of catalyst reaction sites, possibly by reducing the agglomeration of catalyst particles.
CNF with a herringbone-type structure, which is characterized by the alignment of graphene symmetrically angled to the fiber axis, was selected as the catalyst support because it has an edge-rich surface and a high surface area.146
In the metal dissolution test, the PtRu (70 wt%)/CNF catalysts showed 1.5–2 times lower Ru leaching than a tested commercial PtRu/C (74.0 wt%, Johnson Matthey) catalyst. The results of long-term performance tests also prove the higher durability of the anode catalyst compared with the commercial catalyst, when the anode polarization is compared before and after operation for 2000 h.
Three types of CNFs with very different surface structures, such as platelet, herringbone and tubular ones, were prepared by a microwave-polyol method.147 It was found that the methanol fuel cell activities of CNF supported PtRu (24 ± 1 wt%) alloy-type catalysts were in the order of platelet > tubular > herringbone. The best electrocatalytic activity was obtained for the platelet CNF, which is characterized by its edge surface and high graphitization degree.
Ordered uniform porous carbon frameworks with pore sizes in the range of 10 to ∼1000 nm used as supports for a Pt50–Ru50 alloy catalyst were synthesized against removable colloidal silica crystalline templates by the carbonization of phenol and formaldehyde as a carbon precursor as shown in Scheme 3.148 The porous carbons with about 25 nm in pore diameter showed the highest performance with power densities of ∼58 and ∼167 mW cm−2 at 30 and 70 °C, respectively; these values roughly correspond to ∼70 and ∼40% increase as compared to those of a commercially available Pt–Ru alloy catalyst (E-TEK), respectively.

In order to better understand the influence of the atomic structure of various carbon supports on the catalytic activity of PtRu in relation to the methanol oxidation reaction, PtRu nanoparticles on the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and on the Vulcan XC-72 carbon were synthesized using a simple sodium borohydride reduction method with the surfactant tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB).149 The DMFC performance test data showed that PtRu/MWCNT catalysts yielded about 35–39% higher power densities than the PtRu/Vulcan. It has been demonstrated by Prabhuram et al.150 that the PtRu/MWCNT nanocatalyst used at the anode of the fuel cell yielded higher performance than that obtained on the commercial E-TEK PtRu/C catalyst.
Fuel cell testing of Pt–Ru catalysts supported on differently prepared and pretreated carbon nanotubes was done by Tokarz et al.151 The performance of the Pt–Ru catalysts supported on multiwall carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) treated by either high-temperature KOH etching or annealing at 2500 °C (graphitization) was compared to a commercial Pt–Ru catalyst supported on a high-surface-area carbon black. Among the different MCNT supports, the graphitized, entangled support offered the best performance in all tests, which was equal to the performance of the commercial catalyst, although the MCNT catalyst layer was ca. 2.2 times thicker than the carbon black catalyst layer. Even for an MCNT catalyst layer, which was almost 7 times thicker than the carbon black catalyst layer, the transport limitations were not prohibitive. This confirmed the expected potential of nanotube supports for providing superior reactant transport properties of the catalyst layers in the acid type PEM fuel cells.
Fabrication of carbon capsules with hollow core/mesoporous shell (HCMS) was reported by replication through nanocasting of solid core/mesoporous shell silica particles.152 HCMS carbon capsules have an interconnected bimodal pore system composed of a hollow macroporous core and mesoporous shell and have higher surface area and pore volume compared to the aforementioned porous carbon systems, which are potentially important for support materials.
The HCMS carbon supported Pt50–Ru50 catalysts exhibited much higher specific activity for methanol oxidation than the commonly used E-TEK catalyst by about 80%, proving that the HCMS carbon capsules are an excellent support for electrode catalysts in DMFCs.
The electrochemical characterization showed that the PtRu catalysts supported on carbons functionalized with sulfuric acid (SA: H2SO4) and chlorosulfuric acid (C-SA: HSO3Cl) exhibited better performance for methanol/ethanol oxidation if compared to those using unfunctionalized supports.153 The observed better performance can be mainly attributed to the easier access to protons (higher ionic transport), better wettability (higher water uptake), and better distribution of the nanoparticles over the support (higher platinum utilization); indicating that sulfonation is an efficient approach to functionalize, improve the performance, and reduce the cost of fuel cell catalysts.
Thus, the best commercially available anode catalysts still belong to the PtRu/C family, which are known to suffer from carbon electrocorrosion, dissolution of Ru and Pt under the operating conditions and weak bonding between the metals and the support. This is the reason that a huge amount of research is still directed towards improving the properties of these catalytic systems using a variety of carbonaceous materials such as carbon black, mesoporous carbon, CNFs, CNTs, MWCNTs and graphene.
In this subsection the most important factors that influence the catalytic performances of anode electrocatalysts in DMFCs are presented using the simplest PtRu/C catalytic systems. When developing novel anode electrocatalysts for DMFC applications all these aspects must be taken into account.


3.3.2 Nitrogen- and boron-doped carbon-based electrocatalysts. 
Nitrogen-doped carbon materials can undergo a specific strong interaction with Pt and help to reduce the absorbance of CO on Pt particles, which is a major factor leading to the poisoning of the Pt catalyst. Recent and earlier results demonstrating the effect of doping carbonaceous materials with nitrogen or boron on the DMFC performance are summarized in Table 5.

It is well known that nanostructured polyaniline has a large accessible surface area and a low electrical resistance, making it a particularly suitable catalyst support for promoting the catalytic ability of Pt particles. A series of micro/nanostructured polyanilines were synthesized and their morphology dependent electrochemical properties for acting as a catalyst support for DMFC applications were investigated.154 These micro/nanostructures included submicron spheres, hollow microspheres, nanotubes, and nanofibers. Among the four micro/nanostructures, polyaniline nanofibers (PANFs) demonstrated their superiority with a high electrochemically active surface area. Compared with Pt/Vulcan, the Pt/PANF electrode possessed higher electrocatalytic activity and exhibited double power density. Moreover, Pt/PANF was superior to Pt/Vulcan in the aspect of operation stability based on a continuous discharge for 5 h.
The DMFC test results indicated that the MEA prepared by employing the polyaniline (PANI) modified anode made by electro-polymerization of aniline and trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (TFMSA) under galvanostatic conditions exhibited higher performance compared to the conventional MEA in terms of maximum power density (105 and 75 mW cm−2, respectively) and lower methanol crossover caused by PANI as a barrier in the modified anode.155
A facile methodology for improvement in the stability of the PtRu/CB electrocatalyst is described in the literature,156 in which PtRu alloyed nanoparticles are decorated with nitrogen-doped carbon (NxC) originating from the carburization of in situ polymerized polyaniline (PANI) as shown in Scheme 4. Fuel cell tests demonstrated that the NxC-protected PtRu/CB@NxC electrocatalyst showed performance comparable to that of the commercial PtRu/CB catalyst and increased stability (the loss of active sites after stability estimation was 10% and 50% for the PtRu/CB@NxC and PtRu/CB, respectively).

Poly(2,5-benzimidazole) (ABPBI) is one of the most promising conductive polymers in high-temperature FCs because it can be prepared from inexpensive and commercially available single monomers and also possesses high thermal and mechanical stabilities.157 New PtRu electrocatalysts supported on carbon black (CB), in which the PtRu nanoparticles were structurally sandwiched by poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and ABPBI, were prepared.158 Due to the first PVP coating on CB, the micropores on CB are capped resulting in high Pt utilization efficiency (94%) and catalytic activity toward methanol oxidation; the second coating (ABPBI) on PtRu nanoparticles fabricated via in situ polymerization improves the PtRu stability. The fuel cell performance of the double polymer coated electrocatalyst reaches 103 mW cm−2, which is among the highest values reported in the literature.
Increased stability and enhanced CO tolerance was demonstrated for an electrocatalyst composed of Pt deposited on carbon nanotubes wrapped in poly[2,2′-(2,6-pyridine)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole] (PyPBI) further covered by poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) by “a double-polymer coating method” (see Scheme 5).159 The PVP-coated electrocatalyst showed an enhancement in the Pt stability because of the stabilization of the Pt-NPs by the PyPBI and PVP. After the durability test, the PVP-coated electrocatalyst still showed ∼8 times higher CO tolerance because of the presence of the PVP bound stably to PyPBI.

It should be noted that the number of studies on conducting polymers as support materials for Pt-based catalysts is not as large as the number of studies carried out using various carbonaceous support materials, and in the future, more in-depth and extensive research is needed on these catalytic systems to achieve better DMFC performance.160
Three-dimensional (3D) carbon-based materials including porous carbon, carbon nanotube networks and graphene aggregates have been suggested as suitable catalyst supports, based on the consideration that their large porous structures and high conductivity could benefit the mass transport and electrochemical oxidation of methanol fuels. A 3D N-doped graphene aerogel (N-GA) with porous structures and uniformly distributed PtRu NPs (N-GA/PtRu) exhibited unprecedented activity, excellent tolerance and good stability towards the methanol electrochemical oxidation reaction.161
Notably, N-GA/PtRu can be directly used as the anode of DMFCs by simple physical pressing without the need for any binders or additives. The DMFCs constructed with N-GA/PtRu display remarkably large power density and current density under the working conditions. These 3D graphene-based nanocomposites, with easy synthesis, simple manufacturing process and high performance, hold great promise for the replacement of conventional carbon-based hybrids in practical fuel cell applications.
In a hierarchical N-doped carbon nanotube-graphene hybrid nanostructure (NCNT-GHN) used as an efficient support for PtRu nanoparticles, the simultaneous utilization of both the external and internal space of the NCNTs would be possible as the catalyst particles would also access the graphene layers via the open-ended tips, as shown in Scheme 6.162

The graphene layers inside the inner cavity of the CNTs can afford additional anchoring points for metal catalyst nanoparticles in virtue of the open-ended tips of CNTs. Moreover, the graphene layers can serve as additional electron transport pathways inside the CNTs, which is beneficial to the formation of an effective three-dimensional conductive network between different NCNT-GHNs. Improved single-cell performances with long-term stability compared to conventional CNTs and commercial catalysts were achieved due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical structure (graphene–CNT hybrid) and electronic modulation (N-doping).
Due to its extreme chemical and electrochemical stability, diamond is considered one of the most promising alternative support materials, although it has insufficient electrical conductivity in its undoped form.164 However, coating insulating diamond powder with a thin boron-doped layer resulted in an increase of the conductivity from near zero (<10−5 S cm−1) to 1.5 S cm−1.
It has been demonstrated that Pt and Ru nanoparticles deposited on undoped and boron doped diamond nanoparticles (BDDNP), which were prepared using NaBH4 as a reducing agent and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) as a surfactant, can be successfully applied as electrocatalysts in DMFCs and hydrogen-fuelled PEM fuel cells.163
In ref. 165, the development of boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanotubes (BNC NTs) as a support for Pt was demonstrated. Half-cell results demonstrated that boron doping is the key step to improve the catalytic activities and CO-resistance ability due to the combination effects involving firm B–C and N–C bonds, the stronger electron transfer in the nanotube structure among Pt, B and N, and the stronger adsorption intensity of oxygen species from doped B.


3.3.3 Effect of the oxophilic metal-containing support. 
Numerous investigations suggest that some of the CO-poisoning-related issues of the Pt/C electrocatalysts can be overcome by applying a second oxophilic surface metal, which facilitates easy oxidation of the CO contaminant via the so-called bifunctional mechanism, provided an intimate contact between the oxophilic sites and Pt is ensured.115–117 Classical examples include Pt-based alloys or Pt on an oxophilic metal-containing support. Some examples of the effect of the presence of oxophilic metal-containing supports on the DMFC performance of the related Pt electrocatalysts are presented in Table 6. It should be noted that Table 6 includes the most basic examples demonstrating the various possible forms of adding an oxophilic metal to support materials: (i) mixing the appropriate oxide and carbon powder, (ii) preparing oxide/mixed oxide–carbon composites, or (iii) using highly conductive nanostructured oxophilic metal-containing nitride compounds.

Metal oxides based on non-noble metals have promising characteristics for their application in fuel cells. For example, the most successful alternative support material, TiO2, which is non-toxic, has high mechanical, chemical and redox stability, satisfies the stability requirements and its interaction with Pt is also beneficial.166–168
Salgado et al.169 investigated the performance of PtRu electrocatalysts supported by different carbon materials containing HNO3-functionalized carbon black, a mesoporous carbon (CMK-3), a physical mixture of (TiO2 + C) and a reference carbon thermally treated in a helium atmosphere. It has been demonstrated that the highest power density was obtained on the PtRu/C–HNO3 electrode, revealing that the presence of oxygenated groups on carbon materials had an obvious positive effect on the methanol oxidation reaction.
The effect of introducing 5, 15, and 25 wt% of commercial and in-house prepared titania (TiO2) into the Pt–Ru/C anode electrocatalyst on the performance of DMFCs was investigated in ref. 170. The highest power densities were found to be 70.5 mW cm−2 and 70.9 mW cm−2 at 80 °C and 1 M methanol for the DMFCs based on Pt–Ru/C–TiO2 anode electrocatalysts containing 5 wt% of commercial and in-house developed TiO2, respectively.
This performance is about 27.9% higher than that of the DMFC based on the commercial Pt–Ru/C anode electrocatalyst. The results of the 4 h short-term stability tests showed that introduction of 5 wt% commercial TiO2 into the commercial Pt–Ru/C anode electrocatalyst improved its stability characteristics significantly.
It has been demonstrated that the methanol oxidation reaction on Pt particles can be promoted by a TiO2 support, which can lower the adsorption energy of CO.171 Moreover, TiO2 nanoparticles provide additional OH species and these OH species facilitate the conversion of CO derivative intermediates into CO2.
A novel class of electrocatalysts comprises Pt catalysts supported on titanium dioxide doped with certain transition metals (e.g., W, Mo, Ta and Sn).180–184 These mixed oxide-containing catalytic systems demonstrated increased activity and enhanced CO tolerance, but the electronic conductivities of these materials are still substantially lower than those of carbon catalyst supports. Moreover, even if the synthesis of the alternative electrocatalysts is feasible in laboratory quantities, the upscaling of the preparation is often difficult.
Compared to Pt/TiO2–C and commercial Pt/C catalysts, the best performing Pt/Ti0.9Sn0.1O2–C catalyst exhibited the highest activity, evidenced by methanol oxidation and CO stripping experiments.172
The enhanced activity for Pt supported on Ti0.9Sn0.1O2–C is due to the high content of the OH group on Ti0.9Sn0.1O2 along with the strengthened metal—support interactions. Both promote the oxidation of the poisoning CO adsorbed on Pt active sites.
Single fuel cell tests show that the maximum power density of the direct methanol fuel cell using Pt/graphene–TiO2 as the anode catalyst is increased by 55% compared with that using Pt/graphene catalyst under the same operating conditions (see Fig. 12).173 The significantly enhanced electrochemical performance was ascribed to (i) the synergetic effect between Pt, graphene and TiO2 as well as (ii) strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) between Pt nanoparticles and TiO2.

Undoubtedly, the design of a new catalyst support with properties such as high density, high electrical conductivity, and high stability/durability in acidic media, which provide an accessible and sufficient surface area for good dispersion and nucleation of fine metal nanoparticles, is very important for achieving the goals of creating a high performance anodic electrocatalyst with reduced precious metal content for DMFCs.
Titanium nitride (TiN) has higher electrical conductivity (4000 S cm−1) than carbon (1190 S cm−1) and higher density (5.1 g cm−3) than carbon (1.9 g cm−3), which results in a thin layer of the catalyst supported on TiN in contrast with carbon thus offering low mass transfer limitations.185 Taking this into account, the study of highly conductive TiN with a high specific surface area as a support for Pt (Ru) is one of the promising directions for creating a new generation support.
High surface area (∼125 m2 g−1) of the CSG-Pt(Ru)/TiN materials prepared using the complexed sol–gel (CSG) was achieved by the controlled removal of carbon from Pt(Ru)/TiN/C materials using an oxidizing atmosphere (1% O2–Ar) and low temperature (200 °C).174 Single cell DMFC performance showed 56% improved maximum power density and superior electrochemical stability for the Pt50(Ru50)/TiN catalyst, compared to that of the commercial JM-Pt(Ru) (Johnson Matthey) catalyst. This behaviour was attributed to the uniform dispersion of Pt(Ru) achieved on a highly conductive nanostructured TiN support yielding higher electrochemical active surface area and lower charge transfer resistance than commercial JM-Pt(Ru).
Creating more intimate contact between the TiO2 nanoparticles and highly conductive carbon is a key issue to compensate for the low electrical conductivity of TiO2. TiO2-embedded carbon nanofibers, TECNFs, meet these requirements and can be a promising candidate for use as a catalyst support. The power generation performance of the 20 wt% Pt–Ru (with a Pt:Ru atomic ratio of 1:1) supported on TECNF (PtRu/TECNF) was compared to that of commercial PtRu (53 wt%)/Ccom.175 The nanofiber support was prepared by the electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) with TiO2 nanoparticles followed by carbonization and steam activation of the nanofiber. The ultrahigh catalytic activity was demonstrated by the two-times higher DMFC power output using PtRu/TECNF, in spite of quarter the PtRu loading on the electrode, compared to that using the commercial PtRu/C. In ref. 176 the power density was maximized using 30 wt% PtRu/TECNF, which showed 173 mW cm−2 at 80 °C that was 26% higher than that of commercial PtRu/C. The ultrahigh catalytic activity of PtRu/TECNF is attributed to the metal–support interaction, which efficiently occurs at the PtRu/TECNF structure.
Among metal oxide supports, CeO2 is one of the most attractive materials that have been thoroughly studied as catalysts and as structural and electronic promoters of heterogeneous catalytic reactions.186 The improved activity was sometimes interpreted via the bifunctional mechanism and the high oxygen storage capacity of CeO2.187 A series of CeO2 embedded carbon nanofibers, CECNFs, with different CeO2 contents was used as a support for PtRu nanoparticles.177 A DMFC with the PtRu/CECNF exhibited more than 2.5 times high power density with one half the PtRu loading compared to that of the commercial PtRu/Ccom catalyst. The increased activity was attributed to the strong interaction between the metal and oxide in the embedded nanofiber structure.
IrO2 exhibits excellent corrosion resistance in acidic medium, good electrical conductivity and high electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution.188 The results presented in ref. 178 evidenced that a multifunctional catalyst composed of a mixture of in-house prepared high metal surface area 50 wt% PtRu/C and IrO2 nanopowders operated better than bare PtRu/C for methanol oxidation since this multi-step process requires different functionalities to speed up the reaction rate. To address the need for reduction of noble metal amount for cost-effective DMFCs, a Pt loading as low as 0.5 mg cm−2 in the anode was used in all experiments.
In ref. 179, a new family of materials for electrodes was presented: mesoporous carbon ceramics (MCCs) were obtained by the addition of commercial graphite to the SBA-15 mesoporous silica synthesis gel with SiO2/C weight ratios of 1/1 and 1/3. When used as the anode, the MCC-SBA-15 (SiO2/C = 1/3) composite supported PtRu catalyst showed performance comparable to PtRu/Vulcan XC-72R.
In conclusion, materials composed of Pt NPs, oxides/mixed oxides (TiO2, CeO2, IrO2, etc.) and carbon materials with large surface area are identified as efficient electrocatalysts since they combine the good conductivity of carbon and corrosion resistance of the oxide with the synergistic effect between metal oxides and Pt.

In a novel class of electrocatalysts the additive often presents as an alloying component in the carbon supported Pt nanoparticles; examples include Pt–Sn,189–191 Pt–Co,192 Pt–Fe,193 Pt–Pd,194 or Pt–Ru,195,196 among which Pt–Ru is commercially available as the state-of-the-art CO-tolerant electrocatalyst recommended for DMFCs. It has been demonstrated by Antolini et al.197 that among various bimetallic catalysts, PtCo can be considered better for methanol oxidation under acidic or alkaline conditions as Co presents a higher degree of alloying with Pt compared to other transition metals. Recently, the utilization of catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) and spraying methods has been investigated in the fabrication of MEAs for DMFCs using Pt–Co/C catalysts with different Pt/Co ratios.198 With the spray method, the best MEA performance was achieved with a Pt/Co ratio of 60/40 and with the CCM method with a Pt/Co ratio of 40/60, but the spray method gave better performance.
PtCo alloy based highly efficient nanoelectrocatalysts on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) matrix have been synthesized for the electrooxidation of methanol, by the chemical reduction method.199 The peak power density of 118.4 mW cm−2 was obtained for the PtCo (1:9)/rGO catalyst in a DMFC at 100 °C, 1 bar, and 2 M methanol as the anode feed, which is ∼3 times higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst.
As shown in Scheme 7 the construction of the reduced graphene oxide rGO/PANI/Pt–Pd composite involves two steps comprising the synthesis of polyaniline (PANI) on GO and in situ reduction of GO and metal precursors.200 The cumulative features of rGO/PANI/Pt–Pd include an active carbon support and an extended architecture of electron conducting channels, and the abundant methanol oxidation centers offer an excellent DMFC power density of 117.45 mW cm−2 and cell durability over 70 h.

Enhancement of the durability of the composite is provided by the strong interaction between PANI and Pt–Pd through a nitride bond (see Scheme 7).
Lee et al. reported the synthesis of 1.7 nm highly stable and dispersed carbon supported and unsupported bimetallic PtRu, PtMo, PtW and PtNi alloys, which were obtained using LiBH4 in THF as a hydrogen source without the addition of a stabilizing agent.201 The importance of this early study to this day is that it summarizes the basic requirements of catalysts for the enhancement of the DMFC performance. Nanoparticles for fuel cell applications require several characteristics: (i) alloy formation and proper surface chemical composition (metallic Pt and oxidation states of the second metal) to satisfy the bifunctional effect and electronic effect; (ii) controlled surface structure, preferably a highly active and thermodynamically stable surface (111) for a structural effect; (iii) smaller size for preferred single-crystal faces and lower Pt metal loading; (iv) lower onset potential for methanol oxidation to be used for higher electrocatalytic activity. Thus, the high activity of these electrocatalysts was rationalized by alloy formation, surface structure and chemical composition of the nanoparticles.
The preparation of PtRuRhNi multimetallic nanoparticles by the borohydride reduction method for enhanced methanol electrooxidation in a DMFC was described in ref. 202. The catalytic activity of the PtRuRhNi alloy electrocatalyst was superior to that of PtRu, from the standpoint of its high oxidation current, power density, and better stability in the electrochemical half- and single-cell measurements.
The influence of thermal treatment in different environments of the PtRuMo/C catalyst has been investigated for CO and methanol electrooxidation in a half cell and in a DMFC single cell.203 The electrochemical characterization revealed that although all ternary catalysts were more active towards CO and methanol oxidation than the binary catalyst, the catalyst treated with H2 shows improved performance by ca. 15% with respect to the ternary catalysts treated either in helium or without helium treatment. The synergistic effect of the three metals seems to be improved and the Mo–Pt and Mo–Ru interaction strengthened.
Chen et al.204 demonstrated that the performance of the DMFC using PtRuMo/CNTs as the anode catalyst is better than that of PtRu/CNTs and PtRu/C catalysts due to the electronic effect, bifunctional mechanism and hydrogen transfer.
Since the adsorption of hydrogen on the phosphide materials might be beneficial for dehydrogenation during the electro-oxidation of methanol, the performance of a nanostructured PtRu catalyst for methanol oxidation could be significantly improved using the CoP material.205 A maximum power density of 85.7 mW cm−2 achieved at 30 °C on the PtRu–CoP/C catalyst is much higher than that of state-of-the-art commercial PtRu/C catalyst at 70 °C (63.1 mW cm−2). The outstanding catalytic activity and stability observed on the PtRu–CoP/C catalyst should be attributed to the synergistic effect between the nanostructured PtRu and CoP, in which the presence of CoP could largely slow down the loss of Ru and Pt in the PtRu catalyst system and anti-CO poisoning ability.
Recently, a molybdenum phosphide/multiwalled CNT (MoP/MWCNT) catalyst support has been synthesized206 in which fine and well-crystallized MoP nanocrystals were deposited on the sidewalls of the MWCNTs. Electrochemical tests showed that the novel Pt–MoP/MWCNT catalyst demonstrated a good catalytic activity of 1063 mA mg−1 Pt during the methanol electrooxidation reaction, which is 1.6 times higher than that reported for PtRu–CoP/C (670 mA mg−1 Pt).
N-doped graphene (NG) supported ternary PtRuFe nanocatalysts with size between 2 and 3 nm were synthesized using the microwave-assisted polyol method as shown in Scheme 8.207
 Scheme 8  Schematic diagram for the synthesis of PtRuFe/NG. Reproduced with permission from ref. 207, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Publications. 
The maximum power densities delivered by PEMFCs and DMFCs using N-doped graphene (NG) supported ternary PtRuFe nanocatalysts were 870 and 112 mW cm−2, respectively, which are 25% higher than that of the undoped PtRuFe/rGO counterpart. Also, PtRuFe/NG showed 2- to 3-fold improvement in PEMFC and DMFC performances as compared with previously reported values for mono-, bi-, and tri-metallic catalysts supported on NG and other carbon substrates. The enhanced electrochemical activity may be attributed to the synergetic effect of nitrogen-doping along with the bifunctional and ligand effects of alloying low-cost Fe with Pt and Ru.
It should be noted that the bifunctional ternary PtRuFe nanocatalysts supported on N-doped graphene have excellent potential to catalyse both MOR and ORR with remarkable reduction in the processing cost of fuel cells which is the primary problem encountered in the commercialization of fuel cells.
In ref. 208, the performances of the DMFCs assembled with Pt–NiTiO3/C and Pt–Ru–NiTiO3/C anode electrocatalyst materials were investigated. The overall results suggest that the presence of the NiTiO3/C support material increases DMFC performances when Ru is combined with Pt even in the presence of lower Pt loading (0.5 mgPt cm−2). The increased catalytic activity of the anode electrocatalyst shows the mixed synergistic effect of Ru and NiTiO3 and it helps to remove the COads from the catalytic sites. Thus, the nickel titanate–carbon composite can be considered as a promising support material for achieving improved performance for low cost and low power density DMFC applications.
A quaternary catalyst with the composition Pt34Ru30Ir13Ni23, developed using a robotic dispenser and combinatorial optical screening method, was the most active in comparison with the commercial Pt50–Ru50 binary catalyst.209 The effect of the carbon support on methanol oxidation was also investigated using hollow mesoporous carbon (HMC), mesoporous CMK-3, and commercial Vulcan XC-72 (VC) as supporting materials. The Pt34Ru30Ir13Ni23/HMC catalyst had the highest activity, which was attributed to (i) the active quaternary catalyst composition, the activity of which can be explained by a bifunctional mechanism, an electronic effect, and a stability effect arising from the addition of Ni and Ir; and (ii) a unique hierarchical nanostructured carbon support with a large surface area and pore volume, which contributes not only to the homogeneous dispersion of small catalyst nanoparticles, but also fast mass transport in the catalyst layer.
It should be noted that there are numerous reports on the development of Pt-based alloy-type electrocatalysts, which can be successfully used in DMFCs. Moreover, interest in this topic has increased significantly in recent years. Several examples of new catalyst systems that can be used as promising electrocatalysts in DMFCs are presented below.
The synthesis of wicker-like networked PtFe nanowires (NWs) presented in ref. 216 could be a new guideline to tune the structure and composition of nanocatalysts for their use in DMFCs and beyond. It was shown that composition-optimized Pt3Fe NWs had the highest catalytic activity and stability in the MOR and EOR, much better than Pt/C.
Bimetallic aerogels of networked Pt–Sn NWs have been successfully synthesized by Song et al.217 The optimized networked Pt6Sn3 NWs also exhibited enhanced stability toward both the EOR and MOR compared to Pt/C. The present investigations suggested that the networked NWs with high surface areas and rich defects are indeed a unique class of efficient electrocatalysts for alcohol electrooxidation.
The electrodeposition of Pt-based catalysts (PtPd, PtRu, and PtSn) using the pulse current deposition technique was carried out on a titanium substrate to prepare electrodes of different compositions to identify a possible catalyst offering high catalytic activity towards the MOR.218 Among the various compositions and binary metals studied, Pt50Ru50/Ti showed the highest activity and stability.
A general strategy for the synthesis of PtM (M = Fe, Co, Ni) decorated three-dimensional (3D) hollow graphene nanospheres for efficient methanol electrooxidation was demonstrated by Qiu et al.219 This study provides a versatile approach of realizing controlled synthesis of 3D graphene–metal hybrid nanostructures irrespective of the components of the metal domains, and will pave the way for the design of hetero-nanostructures with optimized morphologies and functions.
Recently, structurally ordered Pt-based intermetallic NPs have been used to further improve the electrochemical performance of alloy-type catalysts. Thus, the structurally ordered PtSn NPs supported on Sb-doped SnO2 (ATO) demonstrated remarkably enhanced MOR activity and durability in comparison with the disordered PtSn alloy and commercial Pt/C.220 It has been demonstrated that ATO not only acts as a conductive support for Pt NP deposition and formation ofa strong metal–support interaction, but also provides the Sn source for the transformation of Pt NPs into the structurally ordered PtSn intermetallic NPs.
Pt-based alloy catalysts, Pt–Ni/pCNFs and Pt–Ag–Ni/pCNFs (pCNFs: porous-structured nanofibers nanocomposites), were successfully prepared by electrospinning, impregnation, carbonization and replacement reaction.221 Taking advantages of the three-component alloy system and porous structure of nanofibers, the Pt–Ag–Ni/pCNFs catalyst demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation, tolerance to CO and stability.

Various types of carbonaceous materials such as carbon black, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been used as supports for cathode Pt catalysts.210 Pt/C and Pt/MWNTs showed high and quite comparable power densities (74.0 and 74.2 mW cm−2, respectively), but long-term testing of DMFCs indicated that superior stability was observed only on the Pt/MWNT catalyst.
A mesoporous carbon-supported Pt catalyst with high specific surface area (600 m2 g−1) was used as a cathode catalyst in DMFCs, where a 30% increase in power density compared to Pt/Vulcan was obtained under the same conditions.211 In this study mesoporous carbon was obtained by the carbonization of a structured resorcinol formaldehyde polymer, using a cationic polyelectrolyte as a structuring agent.
The influence of active screen plasma (ASP) treatment temperature and duration on the growth of the Pt nanowire catalyst layer was systemically studied.212 Results revealed that the ASP treatment done at 120 °C for 10 min can effectively promote the growth of Pt nanowires on carbon paper gas diffusion layer, which exhibited the best catalysis performance as compared with the untreated gas diffusion layer (GDL).
Pd-based electrodes (Pd/KB, Pd4Co1/KB and Pd10Co1/KB; KB: Ketjenblack) have shown to be highly appropriate for their use as cathode catalysts in DMFCs in terms of reduction of costs and increase of energy density of the device, since they are much more tolerant to permeated methanol than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst.213 In fact, the cell based on the Pd/KB catalyst provided a higher performance than that based on Pt/C at high methanol concentration (>5 M). The durability tests highlighted the advantage of including a small amount of cobalt in the crystalline structure of Pd, in terms of stability, pointing to a powerful candidate cathode material for DMFCs.
In ref. 214, Pt–C core–shell catalysts supported on CNFs were synthesized and used as cathodes for DMFCs. The synthesized catalysts exhibited higher methanol tolerance than conventional Pt catalysts because the carbon shell effectively protected the Pt core from methanol by selectively permeating oxygen. The selective permeability of the carbon shell increased with the degree of graphitization. The Pt@CS/CNF catalyst heat treated in nitrogen at 900 °C showed the highest methanol tolerance and performance.
A facile one pot aqueous method for support-free Pd85Pt15 nano-porous structures (NPoS) synthesised from PdMn nano-alloys under ambient conditions was recently reported.215 It has been demonstrated that a complete carbon support-free MEA prepared using a support-free Pd85Pt15 NPoS cathode material and Pt NP anode with consistently reduced catalyst layer thickness showed a very high DMFC activity attributable to the zero carbon environment, enhanced catalyst utilization and mass transport on both sides.
3.5 Direct methanol fuel cell with platinum-free electrodes
As a result of the environmental problems caused by the use of fossil fuels, many scientists worldwide are focused on finding some other efficient alternatives. Thus, although high hopes have been placed on hydrogen fuel cells, we face huge challenges related to the transport, storage and use of pure hydrogen. Indeed, the huge cost involved makes this process difficult with the current technologies. Alternatively, methanol (CH3OH) exhibits very attractive advantages: it does not require costly and critical conditions for storage, shows a higher energy density and, obviously, is easier and safer to transport. Therefore, a transition to a methanol-based energy and related economy seems a more realistic goal in short and medium terms.
Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that producing electricity from methanol at room temperature using the so-called DMFCs faces some obstacles. Thus, one of the main problems with DMFCs is the undesired methanol oxidation reaction, which occurs during methanol crossover, that is, when it passes from the anode to the cathode. This reaction leads to the degradation of the platinum (Pt) or other types of catalysts that are essential for the cell's operation. Obviously, many strategies were proposed in order to mitigate this problem in an attempt to overcome the cost and stability issues.

3.5.1 Methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) on Pt-free catalysts. 
As a very good non-platinic metal, Ni shows good electrocatalytic activity towards methanol.222 Moreover, Ni as a catalyst exhibits very important qualities: high stability, low cost and its oxides can easily oxidize the product formed during the MOR. Some other advantages should be added: nickel can be used as an anode catalyst in various forms such as alloys with other transition metals, complexes, nanoparticles, etc.223,224 In line, as a good electrode material it shows high surface area for enhancing the electrode kinetics by reducing the activation over potential.
The improvement of the methanol oxidation reaction on the anodic side of the DMFCs was related to the use of different metal oxides208,225–229 as support materials (e.g. SnO2, TiO2, CeO2, WO3, Co3V2O8/Co2V2O7, NiTiO3). Li et al.227 decorated NiO hollow spheres composed of stacked nanosheets with CeO2 nanoparticles (Ce molar amount of 1.5%, 2.5%, 10% and 15%) by a solvothermal synthesis route for the methanol reaction in alkaline medium. They found a proper loading content in the range of 2.5–5 mol%, which exhibits a high CeO2 dispersion on the NiO nanosheet surface. The morphology of the anode is presented in Fig. 13. The decoration process boosted the formation of the active NiOOH species. On the other hand, the mixture of the cerium valence states Ce3+/Ce4+ proven by XPS with more Ce3+ percentage, able to create a large number of surface oxygen vacancies, plays a good promoting role as a co-catalyst and greatly improves the electrocatalytic activity and stability. These inexpensive anode catalysts are good candidates for DMFC applications.

Sunitha et al.230 performed a comparative study of non-noble metal catalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction by developing a Ni coated nickel mesh electrode working in acidic and alkaline medium.
The authors obtained a maximum current density of 0.025 and 0.030 A cm−2 in both environments but in the acidic medium the performance was achieved with a lower oxidation potential around 0.14 compared with 0.4 V in the alkaline medium. An improvement of the methanol oxidation was observed in the acidic medium due to the continuous purging of nitrogen. However, in the alkaline medium the methanol was oxidized with a higher rate of reaction due to the availability of oxygenated species which led to the easy adsorption of methanol.
Javan et al.231 assessed the electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation by using reduced carbon quantum dots (RCQD) decorated with Ni nanoparticles with high surface area synthesized by a low cost and green electrochemical method. They found that the strong interaction between Ni and CQDs, the confinement effect of carbon quantum dots able to assure a very good dispersion of Ni, as well as the high specific surface area favour superior electron transfer on the surface of the catalyst and, consequently the methanol is more quickly oxidized. A high dispersion of Ni is highly desired in order to improve the electrochemical performance of the non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction.
Anode based Ni/NiO anchored on MWCNTs232 with uniform dispersion of Ni exhibited electrochemical activity (peak current density of 15.94 mA cm−2 at a peak potential of 0.43 mV) comparable with that of commercial Pt–Ru/C by testing in a DMFC single-cell. It was highlighted that by MWCNT incorporation the reaction kinetics was improved. Thus, the charge transfer resistance is diminished by the MWCNT addition and the electrons are more rapidly transferred from the catalyst to methanol.
Pattanayak et al.233 prepared an anode composite based on Cu2O NPs supported on graphene oxide (GO), polypyrrole (PPy) and polypyrrole prepared by a borohydride reduction method. They assessed the anode performance in the DMFC using Pt/C as the cathode. The maximum current density of 155 mA cm−2 obtained at +0.2 V and power density of 31 mW cm−2 as well as the stability were higher than the commercial Pt–Ru/C catalyst. The excellent methanol oxidation activity was related to the Cu2O trapped into the PPy grafted GO as a support matrix which enhanced the number of electrocatalytic active paths for the efficient electron transfer.
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) and transition metal oxides (TMOs) represent a promising material group for methanol oxidation taking into account the low cost and electrochemical activity. Fe3O4@MoS2/rGO,234 (Co–FeNi)9S8 (ref. 235) and MoFeNiS TMC-based composite catalysts were designed for the MOR as well as for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The synergism between Co, Fe, and Ni, dispersion of (CoFeNi)9S8 nanoparticles on rGO, high specific surface area and porous structure of rGO are key factors in the methanol electrooxidation toward DMFCs.235 The replacement of Pt with Pd is desirable to overcome the major problems related to both high costs and the poisoning effects of Pt leading to the deactivation of the active sites and, consequently, to a dramatic drop of the electrochemical performance. The reasons for research directed toward designing catalysts based on Pd are: it is around fifty times more abundant than Pt, can achieve equivalent electrocatalytic activity and it is less susceptible to the formation of the reaction intermediates.
Sunil Kumar et al.236 investigated the methanol oxidation over composites based on Pd20Aux (x = 0, 5, 10 and 15) bimetallic nanoparticles embedded nitrogen doped graphene. They adopted a versatile hydrothermal polyol method, without any template involving the simultaneous reduction of Pd and Au in the presence of a solid support. Thus, they demonstrated that a high dispersion of metal nanoparticles, the strong electronic interactions with the support, the presence mainly of Pd0/Au0 as well as the pyrrolic nitrogen which contributes to the π system with one p electron are the key factors to design an efficient catalyst with enhanced reactivity and stability, CO tolerance and long-time durability for the MOR in DMFC applications.
Kang et al.237 developed an electrocatalyst based on hollow Rh nanostructures (Rh NSs) prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis route starting from Au-core@Rh-shell nanostructures (Au@Rh NSs). RhCl3·nH2O/gold(III) chloride hydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) were used as inorganic precursors and diethylene glycol (DEG) as a surfactant in order to stabilize the colloid crystals in an attempt to grow specific surface facets. Aqua regia was used to remove the surfactant and Au. The electrooxidation tests of methanol, performed in 1 M KOH + 1 M CH3OH revealed that the Rh H-NSs possess a high inherent activity. One can notice that the catalyst exhibited a higher current density (12.4 A g−1) which is 3.5 times that of commercial Pt (3.5 A g−1) within 6000 s.
Pedireddy et al.238 reported the development of nanoporous gold with networks of interconnected ligaments and highly porous structure with activity for methanol electrooxidation and good carbon tolerance, evaluated over 4400 catalytic cycles. They underline their potential suitability for future industrial applications.
Liu et al.239 proved an enhancement of the methanol activity for Au NPs deposited on the graphene surface (Au-6T/SG/Cu) catalytic electrode. The electrochemical tests were performed under simulated solar light and monochromatic LED sources. They highlighted the beneficial role of the irradiation with the simulated solar light that led to the improvement in the electrooxidation performance. The obtained value of 288 μA μg−1 was approximately 1.7 times higher than that without irradiation.
In another study, Liu et al.240 designed Au caviar-like assemblies on an unheated glassy carbon substrate by using a home-built desktop DC ion-sputtering system. By this approach, it was found that the catalyst activity for the methanol electrooxidation reaction and the CO tolerance were significantly improved under simulated solar light irradiation. This favours the SPR-induced charge carrier separation as well as enhanced oxidation species on the Au surface.


3.5.2 Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt-free catalysts. 
Martinaiou et al.,241 leading a comprehensive study, assessed the activity, stability and durability of Fe–N–C non-precious metal catalysts for the ORR in DMFCs. The electrocatalysts were prepared from polyaniline, dicyandiamide and iron acetate as precursors. They studied the effect of the presence of methanol and they observed that after load cycle durability tests the presence of methanol did not produce additional deactivation. For a deeper insight of the degradation phenomena, they studied the methanol tolerance, by applying a durability protocol in the presence and absence of methanol associated with a post-mortem Mössbauer spectroscopy.
Zhao et al.242 developed a 3D porous N-doped graphene aerogel (NGA) with high specific surface area (around 400 m2 g−1) by a hydrothermal synthesis route starting from graphene oxide (GO). The GO obtained via the modified Hummers' method243 was used as a building block and melamine-cyanurate supramolecule as both N source and self-sacrificial pore former. The presence of the different nitrogen species incorporated into the GO lattice such as pyridinic, graphitic, pyrrolic and oxidized nitrogen as well as the hierarchical pore rich structure gave rise to a good catalyst toward the ORR. The NGO electrochemical performance was comparable with the ORR catalytic activity of commercial Pt/C.
Lo Vecchio et al.244 obtained Co–N–C and Fe–N–C electrocatalysts following a chelating synthesis route assisted by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the nitrogen precursor and assessed their electrochemical performance by testing as cathodes in DMFCs. Taking into account the requirements related to the high electrical conductivity of the catalysts, the authors deposited the metal complexes on a high surface area oxidized carbon support and performed a final thermal treatment at 800–1000 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. They assessed the nitrogen chemistry by XPS surface investigation and revealed that higher amounts of pyridinic-N species, with a strong interaction between N and metal atoms, resulted in better electrochemical performance. On the other hand, they reported a decline in the electrochemical activity due to the significant production of H2O2 in the ORR, when the pyrrolic-N species are formed on the surface. One can notice that only a small number of reliable tests on the durability/stability of DMFCs were performed. Indeed, in most DMFC related studies only the initial performance and/or methanol tolerance of non-precious metal cathode catalysts were tested.
The literature offers a few reports on the durability/stability of non-precious metal catalysts at the cathode of DMFCs.245–248 Starting from the standard durability test conditions, as defined by the US Department of Energy, the following degradation mechanisms were proposed for Fe–N–C catalysts. In the potential range assigned to load-cycle condition (0.6–1.0 V) (a) iron demetallation,249 (b) carbon corrosion,250 (c) protonation with subsequent anion binding,241 and (d) formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by hydrogen peroxide release are considered the most likely.
In a recent study published in ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,214 a team of scientists led by Professor Oh Joong Kwon from Incheon National University, Korea reported a creative and effective solution. They fabricated—through a relatively simple procedure—a catalyst made of Pt nanoparticles encapsulated within a carbon shell. “The carbon shell acts as a molecular sieve and provides selectivity toward the desired reactants, which can actually reach the catalyst sites. This prevents the undesirable reaction of the Pt cores,” explains Professor Oh Joong Kwon. This method could be applied to other types of catalysts including non-Pt ones.
The way being open, the researchers found ways to keep under control the number of defects in the shell by simply changing the temperature during the heat treatment.
Following further experimental attempts and comparisons, this novel shelled catalyst outperformed commercial Pt catalysts and also offered much higher stability. Moreover, “DMFCs have a higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries and could therefore become alternative power sources for portable devices, such as laptops and smartphones,” Professor Oh Joong Kwon claims.
Goor et al.251 investigated MEAs, with anodes based on the Pt–Ru black catalyst and E-TEK cathode with 5 mgPt cm−2–20% PTFE carbon cloth substrate for mobility and portable applications. They found that the excellent DMFC performance – 181 mW cm−2 at 80 °C was related to the modification of the hydrophobicity of the BPP (Bi-Polar Plate) flow field channels. The main advantage of the DMFCs consists in quick charging with a low-cost liquid fuel that could be competitive with the hydrogen fuel cells.
Wang et al.252 incorporated an oxophilic Sn metal into the inexpensive Ag metal by a green electrodeposition method in order to obtain an Ag3Sn intermetallic catalyst with improved performance for the ORR. The presence of the metallic species on the surface was revealed by the XPS technique. They found that the electron transfer number (n) for the Ag3Sn catalyst was approximately 3.70, while for the commercial Pt/C it was approximately 4.0. These findings prove the formation of OOH– as an ORR intermediate. AgSn and Ag3Sn intermetallics253 obtained by combining electrochemical deposition and dealloying methods showed enhanced catalytic activity, stability after 5000 potential cycles and excellent alcohol tolerance. The ORR performance in alkaline media (half-wave potential of 0.810 mV and 0.790 mV) was comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (0.837 mV).
Wu et al.254 prepared Ag75M25 (M = Cu, Co, Fe, and In) and AgxCu100−x (x = 0, 25, 45, 50, 55, 75, 90, and 100) nanocatalysts and studied their electronic structures by valence band spectra investigation. They highlighted the effect of composition on the electrochemical properties in the ORR. The best results were obtained for Ag75Cu25 and Ag50Cu50 catalysts.
Zhang et al.255 investigated the reaction activation energy, reaction free energy and half-wave potential of AgCu alloys for the ORR using both theoretical and experimental methods, taking into account the crucial role of the highly active electrocatalysts in the commercialization of fuel cells. They found that a core–shell atom order should be designed for AgCu bimetallic nanoparticles accompanied by synergism in bimetallic catalysts to enhance their ORR activity.
Recently, Zeledón et al.256 studied the compositional effect of the bimetallic Ag1−xPdx (x = 0.1–0.9) thin film catalysts obtained by electron-beam physical vapour co-deposition on the intrinsic activity for the ORR. It was found that the Pd amount can be decreased by 50% without activity loss. By coupling the experimental and computational methods they concluded that the activity enhancements are due to the electronic improvement of the Pd–Pd active sites. Thus, the results revealed that materials with low precious-metal content which possess specific and tuneable properties can be designed.
The DMFCs are also beneficial in the application of portable devices as power generation resources. Moreover, the use of methanol instead of hydrogen as a fuel in fuel cells leads to several important benefits in the application of portable devices. Thus, methanol's liquid state volumetric energy density is superior to that of hydrogen's gas state.257,258 The energy range is very large running from low-watt to kilowatt power output.259 It is worth mentioning that there is much room in R&D for improvement in all branches: theory, fundamental physics and chemistry, experimental and technological aspects.260
Passive DMFCs are envisaged as appropriate sources of a wide range of portable devices with power consumption ranging from a few μW (watches) to tens of μW (pacemakers) to ∼100 W (computers like laptops) through a few W (smartphones).

4. Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs)
4.1 Short overview
In order to overcome the problems with methanol (e.g., unsustainable fuel source, high toxicity, flammable and volatile substance), ethanol is a trustworthy fuel choice in non-H2 fuel cells including direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs), where it acts as an electron donor in the anode.261,262
DEFCs can be used in many applications such as electronic devices, home gadgets, and educational kits. This type of fuel cells also have potential to be used as power for vehicles, but financial support in this area is limited because hydrogen fuel cells have been the focus in this field.13,263
In the direct ethanol fuel cells, the principal goal is to convert ethanol to carbon dioxide in the oxidation reaction process and thereby, in a single reaction double the electrons can be produced compared with the DMFCs.264 The oxidation process varies in DEFCs depending on the catalyst type, fuel structure, membrane used and also parameters such as temperature and concentration.265 Therefore, more studies need to be completed towards an increase of the efficiency reported for DEFCs,.266
Ethanol possesses some important characteristics (e.g., it is a feasibly renewable fuel source that can be produced from a number of sources, especially biomass such as sugar cane, wheat, and corn,267,268 is a nontoxic alcohol,268 and has higher mass energy density than methanol (8.0 vs. 6.1 kW h kg−1)),269 which make it a suitable fuel for direct fuel cells. A very important viewpoint is that the carbon dioxide emitted from DEFCs can be consumed afterwards by plants, allowing in this way a zero greenhouse contribution to the atmosphere.268
To date, there are two major types of DEFC designs reported for the direct ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR): (a) proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM-DEFCs) and (b) anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEM-DEFCs).270 A schematic representation of these types of DEFCs is shown in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  Schematic design illustration of the DEFCs: (a) the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM-DEFC) and (b) the anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEM-DEFC). At the anode side, there are two possible ways to perform the EOR. Note that the highest number of electrons is generated through the C1 pathway as compared to the C2 pathway. 
Aside from the PEM- and AEM-DEFCs, a new class has been developed consisting of an alkaline anode, a membrane (a cation-exchange membrane – CEM), and an acid cathode employing hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant, termed the alkaline–acid DEFC (AA-DEFC).270 With these new AA-DEFCs, the theoretical voltage increases270 up to 2.52 V (see Fig. 15) and it was experimentally proved that a peak power density of 360 mW cm−2 could be obtained at 60 °C,271 which represent the highest performances of DEFCs reported so far in the open literature. However, there are two critical issues related to the AA-DEFCs,272 such as species crossover (which creates a mixed potential and decreases the cell performance) and hydrogen peroxide decomposition (which causes a significant decrease in the cathode potential and thus dramatically decreases the cell performance), issues that might be mitigated by adopting a bifunctional electrode architecture.273,274

4.2 Acid type direct ethanol fuel cells (PEM-DEFCs)
Typically, a PEM-DEFC involves the use of a MEA, which is formed by sandwiching the PEM between an anode and a cathode. MEA, which is regarded as the “heart” of PEMFCs, contains 5 layers: (i) an anode diffusion layer (ADL) which, like most of the DLs, consists of two layers, a backing layer (BL) made of carbon paper, and a micro-porous layer (MPL), usually composed of a mixture of a hydrophobic polymer (usually PTFE) and carbon powder;275 these DLs allow efficient transfer of the reactants to the catalytic layer and proper evacuation of the produced compounds;276 (ii) an anode catalyst layer (ACL), which contains either a single catalyst or a mixture of catalysts and ionomers that provide triple phase boundaries (TPB) for the EOR; (iii) a PEM typically composed of either Nafion® 115 (ref. 277) or Nafion® 117 (ref. 278)-type produced by DuPont, which facilitates the transfer of the produced protons from the anode to the cathode, and physically acts as a separator between the anode and the cathode; (iv) a cathode catalyst layer (CCL) which contains ionomers and the catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and (v) a cathode diffusion layer (CDL). A schematic representation of a PEM-DEFC can be found in Fig. 14a.
The working principle is similar to that of a DMFC. Thus, the EOR takes place at the ACL with the generation of electrons, protons and different products of the electro-oxidation reaction. As stated, the EOR is believed to be a complex multi-step reaction that takes place through a dual-pathway mechanism, denoted as C1 and C2 in Fig. 12a, based on which the C1-pathway (higher electro-efficiency) corresponds to the total ethanol oxidation up to CO2 and the generation of 12 electrons and 12 protons (see eqn (2)), while the C2-pathway (lower electro-efficiency) represents the partial ethanol oxidation to acetic acid and/or acetaldehyde and the generation of 4 and/or 2 electrons/protons, respectively (see eqn (3) and (4)): C2H5OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 12H+ + 12e−(2) C2H5OH + H2O → CH3COOH + 4H+ + 4e−(3) C2H5OH → CH3CHO + 2H+ + 2e−(4)
It should be noted that, with the state-of-the-art catalysts, the products of the EOR are a mixture of acetic acid, acetaldehyde and CO2.279–281 Thus, the EOR taking place on the anode will theoretically follow eqn (5): C2H5OH + 4/3H2O → 1/3CH3COOH + 1/3CH3CHO + 2/3CO2 + 6H+ + 6e−(5)
However, in practice, the amount of acetic acid and acetaldehyde formed is always higher than that of CO2.282 Moreover, it is commonly accepted that the total oxidation of ethanol might not be possible at temperatures below 90 °C.283 Therefore, in a more realistic way and taking into account that the ORR takes place at the cathode, the overall reaction in PEM-DEFCs will follow eqn (6) rather than the well-known eqn (7): C2H5OH + 3/4O2 → 1/2CH3COOH + 1/2CH3CHO + H2O(6) C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O(7)
As already specified, the EOR is a complex process which, in order to provide better electro-efficiency and performance, requires the cleavage of one C–C bond (through the C1-pathway). To realize this process in acid media, however, an extremely active catalyst should be used and, although tremendous efforts have been expended in developing such materials (mainly Pt-based catalysts at both the anode and cathode), the performance of PEM-DEFCs remains low.284 The low performance of PEM-DEFCs (i.e., the state-of-the-art PPDs obtained at 90 °C are 79.5 mW cm−2, 82 mW cm−2 and 96 mW cm−2 on PtRu/C, PtSn/C–B and Pt3Sn/C–PtRu/C double-layered anode catalysts, respectively),285–287 as listed in Table 9, is a consequence of the sluggish kinetics of the EOR which leads to huge activation loss. On the other hand, another process that influences the performance of the PEM-DEFCs is the crossover effect, which is related to the movement of ethanol from the anode to the cathode through the PEM. Due to this process, there will be two parallel and competitive reactions taking place on the cathode (ORR and the EOR) and a mixed potential will be generated.288

When talking about the performances, it was proved that, at low-temperature, PtSn/C yielded superior performance in comparison to the more common Pt/C or even hybrid PtRu/C catalysts.289 Even so, the electro-oxidation of ethanol on PtSn/C leads to the formation of partially oxidized products (acetaldehyde and acetic acid), while the total oxidation to CO2 was not improved. Still, the improvement of the current density achieved might be attributed to the presence of the PtSn alloy that changes the geometric and electronic structure of Pt (an extension of the lattice parameter) which accelerates the adsorption of ethanol (rate-determining step of the EOR) on the surface of the catalyst together with the easier removal of the CO-like species from the surface.285
In the view of these aspects, many other studies comprising the use of PtSn/C,287,288,290–294 Pt2Sn/C295,296 or Pt3Sn/C283,297 catalysts were conducted in the last two decades. Much more than that, a simple model, which can predict the performance of a single DEFC by varying the Sn content and the degree of alloying platinum and tin, was developed.298,299 Other binary Pt-based electrocatalysts, such as PtRu,75,300–305 PtPd306,307 and PtRh308–310 among others, were used as anodes in the electro-oxidation of ethanol in acidic media.
Ternary Pt-based electrocatalysts, such as Pt3Sn1P2 (ref. 311) and PtRhSn/C,312,313 gave interesting results. The deposition of Pt and Rh on carbon-supported SnO2 nanoparticles was used for the preparation of ternary PtRhSnO2/C electrocatalysts with varied Pt:Rh:Sn ratios capable of catalyzing the total oxidation of ethanol in acidic media.312,313 Thus, as the authors stated, the Pt–Rh–SnO2/C electrocatalyst with the atomic ratio of Pt:Rh:Sn = 3:1:4 showed the highest activity; this material was capable of breaking the C–C bond within the ethanol molecule even at room temperature (as was verified by the in situ infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy experiments employed in this study). In the case of the Rh-free catalyst (Pt–SnO2/C catalyst, with Pt:Sn = 3:4 atomic ratio), acetic acid was obtain as the major product. The authors concluded that, for the cleavage of the C–C bond in ethanol, the use of all three constituents is necessary, since the synergistic effect between them facilitates the total oxidation of ethanol.312
To summarize till now, when discussing about the anodic catalysts used in the PEM-DEFCs, it should be noted that Pt itself is rapidly poisoned by strongly adsorbed species coming from the dissociative adsorption of organic molecules, with the removal of these species requiring potentials higher than 0.5–0.6 V.314 Modification of the electrode surface in such a way as to increase its coverage in oxygenated species, like adsorbed OH, is beneficial for the removal of the CO-like species from the surface. However, this process should take place at low potentials and thus, accomplishing it requires the alloying of Pt with other metals that are sufficiently stable in acidic media. In this aspect, the large number of multifunctional electrocatalysts presented above is a step forward in the development of the PEM-DEFC field toward practical use.
4.3 Alkaline type DEFCs (AEM-DEFCs)
In an alkaline DEFC, anions are formed at the cathode reaction and flow towards the anode through an AEM (typically A201 by Tokuyama) (see Fig. 14a). The primary duty of the AEM is to functionally conduct hydroxyl ions and, furthermore, act as a separator between them. Considering the absence of specifically absorbed ions in alkaline solutions and the higher coverage of adsorbed OH at low potentials,315 the activity in alkaline media is enhanced. This is a major advantage that allows the use of low catalyst loadings and also permits selection from a wide range of catalysts including nonprecious metals.
One more significant advantage is the reduced alcohol crossover, because the conducting pathway of OH anions from the cathode to the anode through the membrane is opposite to the direction of the electroosmotic drag. Fuel cell performance can be considerably improved as a result of faster kinetics of both ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, even when inexpensive metal catalysts are used.275 In addition, the charge carriers from alkaline media (i.e. OH−) pull up both molecules back to the anode, alleviating the ethanol and water crossovers.317 The most interesting characteristics of the AEM-based concept are the less corrosive environment, longer durability than the PEM-DEFC model and, last but not least, the faster kinetics of the ORR, permitting the use of noble metal-free catalysts.318Fig. 16 shows the illustration of such a fuel cell.
 Fig. 16  Graphic representation of an AEM-DFC with the: (A) theoretical and (B) real electrode reactions taking place at the electrodes. Reproduced with permission from ref. 316, Copyright 2019 Elsevier Publications. 
Thus, the fuel solution is carried through the anode diffusion layer to the anode catalyst layer, where ethanol is oxidized (EOR) with a theoretical cell voltage of −0.74 V to hypothetically produce electrons, water and carbon dioxide319 and the associated electrochemical reactions occurring at the respective electrode interfaces considering complete oxidation of the ethanol as presented in Fig. 16A. The anode oxidation reaction is counterbalanced at the cathode by the ORR, generating a theoretical cell voltage of 1.14 V. However, in practice, ethanol is known to be partially oxidized and the process may proceed exclusively to acetaldehyde or acetic acid (acetate in alkaline media), giving only 2 or 4 electrons.275,320 Thus, the electron transfer number is reduced to 4 per ethanol molecule, making the electron transfer rate lower316 (see Fig. 16B).
The EOR mechanism in alkaline media is presented in Fig. 17. Thus, the partial ethanol oxidation route follows the C2 pathway321 (see Fig. 17A), while the more challenging C–C bond breaking process is achieved by following the C1 reaction pathway (see Fig. 17B).

In ethanol electro-oxidation, breaking the C–C bond requires the development of efficient catalysts in order to obtain the optimum composition, morphology, size and shape specifically for the desired reaction.323 The catalytic performances of the electrocatalysts can be influenced by many factors,324 as represented in Fig. 18.

4.3.1 Pt based EOR electrocatalysts for AEM-DEFCs. 
Even though many different types of anode catalysts are used, current research is focused on overcoming the difficulty of cleaving the C–C bond from ethanol molecule.325 The presence of such a strong bond leads to difficulties in complete achievement of the reaction of ethanol and thus, lowers the reaction efficiency. Many anode electrocatalysts have been studied for AEM DEFCs, but the most frequently used ones are those based on platinum,326 and some representative examples are listed in Table 10.

As shown, the anode catalysts mainly contain Pt327–329 or Pt alloyed with other metals like Ru, Pd or Cu. The alloying process decreases the costs, while the activity and stability of the catalysts are improved. These benefits have been attributed to the synergistic effects between the metal constituents and to the bifunctional mechanism that ease the desorption of carbonaceous species that poison the catalyst. Thus, it was proved that the lattice parameters and the electronic properties of Pt at the surface can be modified by the second metal, and the resulting catalyst possesses higher activity and longer stability.330
Based on the fact that alkaline DAFCs suffer from a rapid decrease in cell potential at low discharge currents, Ünlü et al.331 performed an interesting study in which the performance of the anionic electrodes in polymer-based alkaline fuel cells is analysed. Thus, the performance of an alkaline DEFC with a PtRu/C anode (loading 4 mgPtRu cm−2), a Tokuyama A201 AEM and a 30 wt% Pt/C cathode (loading 1 mgPt cm−2) was characterized with and without the presence of excess KOH in the anode fuel. The authors showed that in the absence of KOH (only 1 M ethanol) the maximum power density was 1.7 mW cm−2, while, when KOH (0.25 M KOH) was added to the ethanol solution at the anode, the PPD increased to 22.4 mW cm−2. At the same time, with increase of the pH at the anode, the OCP improved from 0.68 V to 0.85 V.
The authors noticed that at very low current densities the cell potential sharply drops, while when the current reached the mass transfer limited regime a modest drop in cell potential occurs.331 Such an abrupt drop in potential was also observed in other studies. For instance, Fujiwara et al.332 reported a PPD of 58 mW cm−2 at 25 °C by using 1 M EtOH and 0.5 M KOH as the fuel in a DEFC with a PtRu/C anode (loading 3 mgPtRu cm−2), a Tokuyama AEM and Pt/C cathode (loading 3 mgPt cm−2), while in the absence of KOH the same cell yielded only 8 mW cm−2.
With the aim of evaluating the alkaline stability, different alternatives to the conventional AEMs were studied and reported in several papers. Thus, recently, Zakaria et al.333 have produced thin films of modified quaternized polyvinyl alcohol (QPVA) with graphene oxide and used them in alkaline DEFCs comprising Pt–Ru/C anode catalysts (loading 2 mg cm−2), and Pt/C cathode catalysts (loading 2 mg cm−2). The QPVA/GO membrane soaked in 4 M KOH for 24 h at 80 °C achieved high proton conductivity (0.021 S cm−1) and low ethanol permeability 1.245 × 10−7 cm2 s−1.
The authors have thus demonstrated the stability (ca. 1000 h) of these AEMs under extreme alkaline conditions and through hydrolysis, the achieved PPD at ambient temperature being 16.88 mW cm−2. These results were a significant improvement of the performances obtained by Shaari et al.340 wherein they achieved a PPD of 11.28 at 70 °C by using a similar alkaline DEFC system.
In the same context, Osmieri et al.343 performed a study in which four carbonaceous materials (acetylene black, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and two carbon materials synthesized by the hard-template method) were used as supports to synthesize four Fe–N/C cathode catalysts. Although the performances of these Fe–N/C catalysts were very promising (72.8 mW cm−2), the stability of the alkaline DEFC was low. The instability issues were tentatively attributed by the authors to several identified factors: (i) the instability of the MEAs used in the cell; (ii) the incompatibility between the ionomer used in the preparation ink and the membrane, (iii) the rapid formation of water as the reaction product at the anode, and (iv) the detachment/separation of the electrodes from the membrane which can be caused by the absence of hot pressing during the MEA preparation.
Interesting results were obtained under alkaline conditions when a commercial polybenzimidazole membrane doped with OH− (PBI/OH−) was used as the electrolyte,335,338,341,342,344 all of these studies demonstrating the use of PtRu/C anode catalysts.
To summarize, the production of highly electroactive and durable catalysts for the EOR and the ORR are still challenging and future studies should focus on finding solutions to the alkaline DEFC issues.


4.3.2 Pt-free based EOR electrocatalysts for AEM-DEFCs. 
Although Pt is the most common electrocatalyst used as the anode, due to its ability to oxidize a wide range of fuels, its limitation is related to the high cost and availability. Moreover, Pt is prone to poisoning with the intermediate formed during ethanol oxidation. Therefore, other alternatives are being searched and a viable solution is the use of Pd that has high ethanol oxidation activity under alkaline conditions, high poisoning tolerance and high stability at low temperatures.319 Moreover, Tran et al.348 demonstrated that the conventional Pd/C as the anode, Pt/C as the cathode and A201 as the AEM are very good candidates to assemble a cell with very good performance at 60 °C (128 mW cm−2 for ethanol) capable of supporting different liquid fuels (1-propanol, 2-propanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerol) and achieving good activity. The fuel stream contains ethanol and KOH, otherwise in the absence of the base, the power density decreases to 9 mW cm−2. However, the use of monometallic Pd for DEFCs as the anode is an issue, despite its great aforementioned abilities, because Pd particle size grows over time and degrades the DEFC. Therefore, intense research was made to highlight the good features of Pd in alkaline DEFCs and the use of Pd-based composites (alloyed or in other metallic combinations) has gained ground, mainly due to the bifunctional mechanism observed when metals or metal oxides were added on a carbon black support, among others.349,350
Pt-free anodes have been reviewed previously,275 therefore in this section we will point out only the most performant DEFCs and the advantages brought by the development of new materials for electrodes, new membranes or new ways to assemble MEAs. In comparison with the results presented for Pt-based DEFC anodes (see Table 10), when Pt-free anodes are used, an improvement of the fuel cell performance is observed (see Table 11).

As shown in Table 10, alloying Pt with Ru brings several advantages, for instance, high activity due to the low particle size, which influences the DEFC performance.351,352 Ma et al.352 confirmed that alloying Pd and Ru is also a great choice. They have designed a fuel cell using a MnO2 nanotube catalyst prepared in-house as the cathode and A201 as the AEM. In comparison with a Pd/C catalyst with the same particle size, Pd3Ru/C was 1.8 times superior in the practical fuel cell with a PPD of 176 mW cm−2 at 80 °C.
A Pt anode alloyed with Au for DEFCs shows increased stability, but did not present any improvement in ethanol electroactivity. However, Xu et al.353 demonstrated that Pd behaves differently than Pt when alloyed with Au and improves the electro-oxidation of ethanol, thus resulting in more stable DEFCs. This behaviour can be due to the special ability of Au to withdraw electrons from the neighbouring Pd atoms. In the DEFC, the stability increased with the increase of Au content, but was in detriment of the activity, therefore a compromise between the two features should be done. The authors concluded that the composition Pd3Au/C maintains a good cell performance (53.8 mW cm−2 at 40 °C) equivalent to that of the Pd/C anode, and at the same time improves the stability of the DEFC (a loss of 25% in current density after 3000 cycles compared with 53% loss when Pd/C was used, under the same conditions).
Considering that the MEA assembly of AEM DEFCs was derived from acid DAFCs, Li et al.354 tried to increase the performance of DEFCs by improving the anode electrode structure. Thus, the DEFC fabricated using a non-platinum Fe–Co HYPERMEC™ K14 (Acta) cathode, a A-201 membrane provided by Tokuyama, and an in-house prepared anode (PdNi/C) achieved a power density of 130 mW cm−2 at 80 °C at a current density of 1060 mA cm−2. The difference between the conventional anode and the integrated anode structure proposed consists in adopting a modified way of putting the catalysts in contact with the Ni foam.
The Ni foam skeleton was dip-coated in a solution containing the catalyst and the ink, while the conventional method involves brushing of the Ni foam with the prepared catalyst ink. Changing the method leads to a good dispersion of the catalyst onto the Ni foam, an enhanced transport of reactants/products and ion charges and a reduced cell resistance. The same group tried a layered reduction method when Pd was deposited on the Ni foam, and succeeded in increasing the DEFC performance to 164 mW cm−2.375
In 2011, An et al.379 demonstrated that very good performances can also be obtained if, instead of the anion exchange membrane, a cation exchange membrane to conduct Na+ (found in the fuel stream) from the anode to the cathode is used. The DEFC assembly consists of a PdNi/C anode, Fe–Co K-14 HYPERMEC™ (ACTA) cathode and AEM or CEM as the exchange membrane. The performance of the CEM is slightly higher (135 mW cm−2) than that of AEM (115 mW cm−2) at 90 °C, and seems to be more stable with temperature (AEM starts to degrade at temperatures >60 °C). However, using a cation exchange membrane also brings other disadvantages that need to be addressed, like NaOH formation at the cathode.
Not only alloying Pd, but also addition of a metal oxide could boost the DEFC performance. It has been assumed that the oxophilicity of the metal oxides has the ability to reduce the Pd loading and to provide the hydroxyl groups required for the oxidation of ethanol molecules adsorbed onto the surface.360 Supporting the Pd nanoparticles on CeO2, yields twice as much higher performance of the DEFC (140 mW cm−2), compared with the conventional Pd/C and confirms that Pd–OHads species formed on the ceria support are responsible for the enhanced DEFC performance.365 Trimetallic anodes (PdNiZn) were also investigated in passive DEFCs having a polymer electrolyte membrane and Fe–Co K-14 Hypermec™ as the cathode. The PEM-DEFC performance was high (170 mW cm−2) and was associated with the synergy between Ni and Zn, which promoted the increase of OHads species on the catalyst surface.374
Very good performance of the DEFC was obtained by replacing the conventional Hypermec™ or Pt/C cathode with a modified Pd–Au alloy supported on carbon nanotubes as the cathode (185 mW cm−2).376 Also, on modifying the carbon support with nitrogen, when Pd was used as the anode, excellent performance of bthe DEFC at 60 °C was obtained (a PPD of 202 mW cm−2).370 This increase in power density is explained by a higher dispersion of Pd nanoparticles when the support is decorated with nitrogen. Similar results (202.3 mW cm−2) were obtained by using a bimetallic PdAu anode supported on carbon nanotubes with the note that higher temperature (i.e., 80 °C) was used.359


4.3.3 Graphene based support for electrocatalysts used for DEFCs. 
To further increase the applicability of the materials used as anodes or cathodes described in the previous sections, the nanoparticles of noble metals are dispersed on high surface area supports, like carbon black or carbon nanotubes. Recently, graphenes and their derivatives belonging to this class of materials were found as promising alternatives to the classical carbon-based supports. Therefore, as a strategy to minimize the metal-loading and to improve the electro-oxidation of ethanol toward commercialization of DEFCs, graphene-like materials have been increasingly considered as supports. We will further discuss the design improvements in graphene-based electrodes for ethanol electro-oxidation.
Graphenes. 
Graphenes are 2D materials with single or few atomic layers, high surface area, good electrical conductivity and chemical activity.380–382 With the progress in the field of graphene materials and the developed properties, they have been applied in fuel cell as supports for anodes and the major improvement is better metal dispersion in contact with the support, which induces much higher electroactivity compared with the analogues supported on carbon black.34,383,384 Several studies underlined the advantages of metals supported on graphene, such as Pt380,381,385 or Pd,382,386 however many others emphasized that alloying the metal will bring more important gains when used for the ethanol electro-oxidation reaction. Thus, PtPd,387 PdAg,388,389 PdNi,360 NiCo,390 and even trimetallic combinations like PtRhFe391 pointed out to an improvement of the electrocatalysts for the ethanol electro-oxidation. Involvement of two metals has proven to result in several favourable outcomes such as good catalytic activity, better stability and also different selectivity. All these features are related to different phenomena when the two metals are associated, such as modified geometry of the active site, changed electronic state, improved stability and the presence of a synergetic or bi-functional effect.392
Nevertheless, the use of only graphene as the support for the metal nanoparticles has proven to not completely address the issues concerning the high dispersibility of the metallic nanoparticles during the deposition process. Thus, the next step was to modify graphene in order to improve the anodes in alkaline DEFCs.
Modified graphenes. 
Graphene can be modified in various ways in order to improve the performance of the direct ethanol fuel cell. For this purpose different molecules can be used to modify the graphene surface and can be classified into non-covalent and covalent functions of the bond type formed with the surface.393
The presence of functional groups on graphene nanosheets was found to increase the wettability and the accessibility of the metal nanoparticles to the electroactive surface, by acting as nucleation centers and anchoring sites and thus limiting the particle growth.394–396
Moreover, using graphene oxides as supports, due to the presence of OH groups on the surface, a composite with the functionalized group and metallic nanoparticles is formed. Such a composite, owing to its triple junction structure, has an increased surface area, and better metal dispersion and electrical conductivity.382,397
Doped graphenes. 
Doping graphene with other hetero-atoms was among the first attempts to improve its properties. It was found that insertion of nitrogen in graphene produces structural changes and electronic rearrangement of the graphene sheets, which induces the appearance of new active sites in the graphene structure.398–400 Additionally, several other benefits were confirmed during different studies: N-doping can reduce the particle size, improve the anchoring of the catalysts onto the electrode, and assure a greater dispersion of the nanoparticles, all these resulting in an electrocatalyst with higher performance. For example, Wu et al.399 demonstrated that N-doped graphene generates a synergetic effect with the supported metal, which results in four times increased electro-oxidation activity for PdPb/NG (152.3 mA cm−2) compared with Pd/G (38.0 mA cm−2). The main reason for this behaviour is the very good dispersibility of the metals when the support contains a large amount of nitrogen as can be seen in Fig. 19. In another attempt, insertion of two heterogeneous atoms, B and N, into graphene was tried and it succeeded in improving the electrochemical activity and stability of the electrodes in the ethanol electro-oxidation. Also, Chowdhury et al.401 reported a Pd/BN-GNR modified electrocatalyst prepared in one-step with improved performance compared to Pd/GNRs and Pd/C in ethanol electro-oxidation (see Fig. 19). All these reports claim that the synergy between the co-doped/doped-graphene and the metallic nanoparticles is responsible for the enhancement of the electroactivity due to the good dispersibility of the metal onto the surface, increase of catalytic active sites and increase of conductivity.

Nanocomposites: metal oxides–graphenes. 
Previous studies have shown that the combination of noble metals with metal oxides yields more active and stable electrocatalysts for the ethanol electro-oxidation reaction.403–407 The main disadvantage of these electrocatalysts is related to the poor conductivity of metal oxides, which hinders their use in the application as supports. One way to surpass this issue is to design electrocatalysts that take the advantage of the good electronic conductivity of graphenes. Some examples of such triple composition noble metals/metallic oxides/graphene are reviewed below.
The first attempt to improve the properties of graphene by adding metal oxides to form a nanocomposite was made by Wen et al.382 They succeeded in preparing a new composite by combining the properties of SnO2, graphene oxide and a Pd precursor (Pd/SnO2-GNS). The Pd/SnO2-GNS presents higher catalytic activity compared with the Pd/GNS catalyst in ethanol oxidation, and this enhanced activity was due to the high ECSA. The good dispersibility of Pd particles when the SnO2-GNS support vs. GNS was used has been emphasized by TEM analysis (see Fig. 20).

Few years later, Qu et al.408 found a way to improve the electro-oxidation activity of noble metals deposited on SnO2/graphene by designing a layer-by-layer SnO2/Pt/graphene anode using a mild microwave assisted polyol process (MAPP). They have also shown that the electro-oxidation process of ethanol depends on the amount of graphene deposited. 30 wt% of graphene was found to be the optimum amount for the developed compositions.
Cerium oxide was also considered to improve the activity of Me/graphene electrocatalysts.409 Thus, the strategy chosen to improve the electroactivity was to alloy Pt with cerium oxide in order to reduce the amount of Pt, together with the modification of the reduced graphene surface by anchoring –SO3H groups. The role of sulfonic groups on the graphene surface was to improve the Pt dispersion by increasing the hydrophilicity of the support. The results showed that the employed approach was successful with an increase of 17% of current density comparing Pt/CeO2/SRGO with Pt/SRGO, which is in agreement with the proposed Tempkin mechanism.
The use of manganese oxide and a bimetallic alloy (Pd–Ni–MnO2/rGO)410 or of a magnetic spinel in a composition of the type Pd/CoFe2O4/rGO presents a corroborative effect in the presence of the metal and graphene support and yields electrocatalysts with higher stability and CO tolerance and also with enhanced electroactivity.
Shamraiz et al.411 decided to modify the Pd d-band centers with earth-abundant alkaline metals. According to the d-band theory, the Pd adsorption capacity is enhanced with the uplift of d-band centers and therefore using earth-alkaline metals, like Ca, which possesses a higher lattice constant (5.58 Å) than Pd (3.89 Å) and has the potential to uplift the Pd d-band centers. Such changes in d-band will produce improvement in the oxidation of alcohols at more negative potentials. Undoubtedly, the presence of oxygen from CaO during the doping process helped in overcoming the adsorbed intermediate poisoning issues occurring on carbonaceous materials. The enhanced PdCa/rGO mass activity (4674.70 mA mg−1 Pd) compared with Pd/rGO (1490.08 mA mg−1 Pd) was also related to the homogeneous distribution of Ca and Pd on graphene sheets which resulted in high activity, stability and increased tolerance to CO poisoning of the electrocatalyst.
Functionalized graphenes. 
Noncovalent anchors, for noble metal modified graphenes, can boost the ethanol electro-oxidation reaction. In the following section examples such as poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA), perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), dimethyldiallylammonium chloride (DMDAAC), polyaniline (PANI), and polypyrrole (PPy) are reviewed. In Fig. 21 some examples of the synthesis method of polymer/graphene based electrocatalysts are schematically represented.

PDDA was used to design and prepare a monometallic composite like Pd–PDDA/rGO412 or a bimetallic composite electrode such as PDDA–rGO–PdPt via the sonoelectrochemical method.413 The use of PDDA in both cases increased the ethanol electro-oxidation and the stability of the electrocatalyst mainly due to the good dispersion of PDDA and the metal onto the graphene surface. The current density of Pd–PDDA/rGO developed for ethanol oxidation is 1.38 times higher than that of the Pd/rGO homologue,412 while for PDDA–rGO–PdPt the current density (6.7 mA cm−2) is nearly 1.5 times higher than that of the PdPt alloy without rGO.413 The high homogeneity of PDDA has also been found to increase the graphene conductivity and to improve the CO tolerance. Moreover, the sonoelectrochemical method used by Shi et al.413 plays an important role in graphene sheet separation, thus combining the special feature of 2D graphene with the metallic alloy properties.
Li et al.414 studied the influence of PTCA when coating the graphene sheets. The authors demonstrated the successful functionalization of graphene with PTCA taking advantage of π–π stacking and hydrophobic forces. The Pd/PTCA–GS (NaBH4) electrocatalyst prepared presented enhanced electroactivity for ethanol electro-oxidation, which can be mainly correlated with the narrower size distribution, better homogeneity and uniform crystal structure. Several studies415–418 reported an increased electroactivity when PEDOT was used as the polymer to obtain graphene nanocomposites. Its success is mainly due to its high conductivity and very good stability in the oxidized state in comparison with other conductive polymers. Pt/PEDOT/ER-GO composites present a maximum mass peak current density of 78.7% which was better than that of the Pt/C electrode.418 The advantage of this composite is the long-term stability in acidic medium and very good tolerance to CO poisoning but also the fact that it is prepared by a greener route416 in order to increase its applicability.415 Studies on PEDOT/rGO were extended to the use of Pd as the noble metal417 and the big plus was the one-pot facile synthesis of the nanocomposites, since their synthesis can be complex and laborious. Such materials are found to be very stable and have enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared with Pd–PEDOT and Pd/C catalysts.
Zhang et al.397 demonstrated that the use of DMDAAC, a cationic polymer, has several advantages: it stabilizes the metallic nanoparticles, avoids graphene nanosheet agglomeration and increases the conductivity. It has been found that Pd/DMDAAC-rGO has ∼7 times higher electrocatalytic activity and stability (3.25 × 10−2 mA cm−2 exchanged current density) than Pd/rGO for ethanol oxidation (4.87 × 10−3 mA cm−2).397 One of the main reasons for this behaviour is that DMDAAC assists the formation of small Pd nanoparticles and better dispersion at high metal concentrations, when it is supported on rGO.
Recently, polyaniline and polypyrrole were employed to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts for ethanol electro-oxidation. Besides the good conductivity and stability, polyaniline is also known have good intrinsic flexibility.419 The insertion of PANI into the Au/PANI/rGO electrode, by a facile and rapid strategy, will increase the peak current density by 3.5 times when compared with the Au/rGO electrode, probably due to a better charge transport phenomenon. A similar effect was found when PPy was used as an anchor for the deposition of the catalysts onto the electrode.
Ni nanoparticles421 or bimetallic Pt–Pd noble metals420 were used as noble metals in combination with PPy and graphene oxide to produce electrocatalysts for ethanol electro-oxidation. Both material combinations, besides the favourable effect over ethanol electro-oxidation (21.1 mA cm−2 current density for NiNPs-R/PPy/CPE),421 present good tolerance to CO and other intermediates resulting from the ethanol oxidation.

4.4 Alkaline–acid direct ethanol fuel cells (AA-DEFCs)
As described above, the conventional DEFCs operating in both acid and alkaline media, show several limitations, such as: (i) the sluggish kinetics of the EOR in the case of PEM-DEFCs; (ii) about one order of magnitude lower ionic conductivity of the AEM compared to that of Nafion® membranes; (iii) poor thermal stability of the AEM, and (iv) the low theoretical voltage (1.14 V). The increase of theoretical voltage can be achieved by changing the conventional oxidant (O2/air) to a better one (H2O2). Thus, as shown in Fig. 15, while the anode potentials of both the PEM- and AEM-DEFC operating with H2O2 (as the oxidant) remain the same (i.e., 0.09 V for PEM-DEFC and −0.74 V for AEM-DEFC), the cathode potentials of both the PEM- and AEM-DEFC increase from 1.23 V to 1.78 V and from 0.40 V to 0.87 V, respectively.270 Based on these aspects, combining the lower anode potential of the AEM-DEFC and the higher cathode potential of PEM-DEFC, at the same time with the use of hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant, will result in the formation of a new cell characterized by a higher theoretical voltage (2.52 V) and faster kinetics of the ethanol oxidation reaction. The working principle of this fuel cell will be detailed in the next section.
The use of hydrogen peroxide, however, implies the appearance of three major issues that reduce the performance. The first one refers to the drastic drop in the cathode potential due to the H2O2 decomposition. This decomposition process led to the formation of H2O and O2, which further creates the premise for simultaneous appearance of both hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) and oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode. As the potential associated with each reaction is different (lower in the case of the ORR than that of the HPRR), a mixed potential is created. The second issue is caused by the release of gaseous O2 (through H2O2 decomposition) which led to a two-phase mass transport in the cathode (the mass transport resistance of liquid-phase H2O2 in the cathode electrode is much larger than that of gaseous O2) and an increase in the gas void fraction, which lower the effective active area.422 In the same time, the H2O2 decomposition will cause a large concentration loss in the cathode catalyst layer. The third issue refers to the use of metal catalysts, such as platinum, palladium or gold which are required in order to minimize/lower the rate of the homogeneous decomposition of H2O2.423 It must be noted that decomposition of H2O2 can proceed homogeneously and heterogeneously. Homogeneous decomposition is caused by the intrinsic instability of H2O2 and the rate depends on several parameters, such as temperature, concentration and the solution pH value, among other minor factors. The rate of heterogeneous decomposition, however, depends on the specific catalyst that is used at the cathode. Thus, it was experimentally shown that the best metal catalysts, which reduce the rate of homogeneous decomposition, are mainly the noble metal-based ones.20 The use of such type of metals will maintain the total cost of the AA-DEFCs high and, thus, is yet seen as an issue and future studies are required to overcome it.
In 2011, An et al.270 reported for the first time the development of a new type of DEFC, named alkaline–acid DEFC (AA-DEFC), which was composed of an alkaline anode (PdNi/C with a loading of 1.0 mg cm−2), a membrane (a sodium conducting membrane based on pre-treated Nafion® 117) and an acid cathode (60 wt% Pt/C from Johnson-Matthey with a loading of 3.9 mg cm−2). The anolyte was an aqueous solution of ethanol (3 M) and sodium hydroxide (5 M), while the catholyte was an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (4 M) and sulfuric acid (1 M), both flowing at 2 mL min−1 through the flow channels present at the anode and cathode, respectively. The fuel cell was able to achieve a PPD of 240 mW cm−2 at 60 °C with an OCV of 1.6 V. The large difference between this OCV and theoretical voltage (2.52 V) was mainly caused by the mixed potential phenomenon occurring on the cathode.
In the same year, An et al.271 have investigated the effects of MEA thickness and the concentrations of various species on the performance of the AA-DEFC working with the same anode and cathode like in the previous study. The authors found that the hydrogen peroxide concentration, ethanol concentration, NaOH concentration, and membrane thickness, have significant influences on the cell performance, reaching, with the MEA (a sodium conducting membrane based on pre-treated Nafion® 211) possessing a thickness of 25 μm, a PPD of 360 mW cm−2.
Once again, in 2011, An et al.,273 only by exchanging the cathode (a bifunctional cathode: Au/Ni–Cr foam with a loading of 1.2 mg cm−2) of the cell improved the direct electro-reduction of H2O2 and lowered the H2O2 decomposition rate and the mass transport resistance; in this way the AA-DEFC yielded a PPD of 200 mW cm−2 at 60 °C.
In 2014, An et al.424 proposed an approach to avoid the mixed-potential phenomenon by introducing a redox couple of V(IV)/V(V) to the cathode while using hydrogen peroxide to chemically charge the redox ions, as illustrated in Fig. 22. Faster cathodic electrochemical kinetics was achieved even with no noble metal catalysts. This new alkaline–acid DEFC yields a peak power density of 450 mW cm−2 at 60 °C.

5. Direct glycerol fuel cells (DGFCs)
5.1 Short overview
Glycerol is a surplus by-product obtained during the biodiesel manufacturing process by the transesterification of plant oils and animal fats and it accounts for 10% of the total product.425 Considered an ideal bio-renewable feedstock, the global glycerol market size was valued at 2.6 billion $ in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.0% from 2020 to 2027.426 Moreover, the Oleoline Glycerine Market Report estimated that the price of crude glycerine will fall from $0.12 in June 2020 to $0.10 per pound by the end of 2021.427
Therefore, intensive research has been invested to develop processes based on glycerol, such as different catalytic methods to produce added value chemicals,428,429 but also processes to produce energy, for instance in fuel cell applications.321 In fact, glycerol was proposed for the first time in 1964 as a fuel for fuel cells430 due to its higher energy density (5965 W h L−1) comparable with that of methanol (5897 W h L−1) and close to that of ethanol (6307 W h L−1), and demonstrated certain advantages such as low-fuel cross-over and high-power density.431,432 Since then, fuel cells directly fed with glycerol, named direct glycerol fuel cells (DGFCs) have recently gained significant interest and are a current focus in the fuel cell research community.433,434
DGFCs are classified into the following major types, schematically represented in Fig. 23: (i) alkaline type, using an anion exchange membrane (AEM-DGFCs) in which the OH− anion is transported from the cathode to the anode; (ii) acid type, using a proton exchange membrane (PEM-DGFCs), in which the H+ is transported from the anode to the cathode, and (iii) alkaline–acid type, which uses a cation exchange membrane (AA-DGFCs) and brings together the advantages of both alkaline and acid types.
 Fig. 23  Schematic representation of the DGFC types: (a) alkaline direct glycerol fuel cell (AEM-DGFC), (b) acid direct glycerol fuel cell (PEM-DGFC) and (c) alkaline–acid direct glycerol fuel cell (AA-DGFC). 
Due to the fact that the electro-oxidation rate of glycerol in alkaline media is considerably higher than in acidic media, alkaline-direct glycerol fuel cells have gained more attention from the scientific community.435–437
In this section the progress achieved over the last few years in the design of the electrocatalyst composition for all types of DGFCs will be reviewed, since they are vital components of fuel cell systems and represent a critical feature for the development of high-performance fuel cells.
For instance, there are studies438 that suggest gold and platinum based electrocatalysts as the best materials for glycerol oxidation in alkaline than in acid media, and Pt is less active than Au in alkaline medium (at high overpotentials).
Other studies demonstrated that Pt has the highest activity in the low potential region, with a turnover frequency (TOF) 4–5 times higher than that on Pd and 20–30 times higher than that on Au at −0.3 V vs. Hg/HgO/1.0 M KOH.439
5.2 Alkaline direct glycerol fuel cells (AEM-DGFCs)
Glycerol electro-oxidation reaction is not a simple reaction because it involves the breakage of two C–C bonds and therefore several pathways are possible, thus a deeper understanding of the whole process is highly desirable. For instance, in alkaline medium, during electro-oxidation of glycerol many soluble products are formed (see Scheme 9), such as glyceraldehyde, glyceric acid, glycolate, glycerate, glyoxylic acid, dihydroxyacetone, hydroxypyruvic acid, mesoxalic acid, oxalic acid, tartonate, oxalate and CO32− and several pathways are possible until it is completely oxidized to CO2 through the transfer of 14 electrons. The complete oxidation of glycerol to carbonate, in alkaline medium, is described by eqn (8): C3H8O3 + 20OH− → 3CO32− + 14H2O + 14e−(8)

Re-adsorption and diffusion of the intermediary species have a negative impact on the total efficiency of the system. One way to improve the performance of the cell is to design an electrocatalyst440,441 and a support442,443 more resistant to the poisoning effect induced by the adsorbed intermediates and more selective towards the CO2 formation.440,444 There are only a few studies giving an overview of the advances in AEM-DGFC, in which different parameters affecting the cell performance are discussed,321,434,445 most of them presenting a summary on the electrocatalysts used in direct alcohol fuel cells.321,431,445

5.2.1 Noble metal based electrocatalysts for AEM-DGFCs. 
Pt based electrocatalysts have been identified as the most efficient electrocatalysts for AEM-DGFCs because they demonstrated high activity towards the electro-oxidation of alcohols in general,446–448 and of glycerol in particular.437,449,450 Moreover, the higher the Pt percentage, the better the cell performance in the overall current density range, as a result of the enhanced kinetics of the glycerol oxidation and the enhanced mass transportation of the thinner catalytic layer, according to the data presented by Linares et al.450 Also, the fuel cell investigation demonstrated that the Pt/C (40 wt%) anode in AEM can yield a peak power density (PPD) of 124.5 mW cm−2 with 2.0 M KOH + 1.0 M high purity glycerol at 80 °C.437,439 This power current density is similar to the ones obtained in direct methanol (168 mW cm−2) and ethanol (160 mW cm−2) AEMFCs for multi-metallic catalyst systems (3 mgPtRu cm−2 for methanol and 1 mgPd–(Ni–Zn–P) cm−2 for ethanol) under optimized experimental conditions (i.e. fuel composition flow rate, and temperature).374,451 It is important to note that Pt/C did not show a drop in performance when the fuel was switched to the biodiesel derived crude glycerol (88 wt%), and a PPD of 120 mW cm−2 was obtained under similar conditions (2.0 M KOH + 1.0 M crude glycerol) indicating high stability of the Pt/C anode against the contamination/poisoning of the impurities in crude glycerol.439 However, the PPD presented a volcano-type behaviour as a function of crude glycerol concentration, and this can be explained by the fact that the lower glycerol concentration led to lower coverage rate of glycerol on the surface of the catalysts, while the higher crude glycerol will lead to a lower OH− coverage on the catalyst surface, both situations result in a lower performance. The highest performance was obtained when the cell was fed with 6.0 M KOH + 1.0 M crude glycerol, the Pt/C anode exhibits a very high PPD of 184.2 mW cm−2.439
However, Pt has several drawbacks and besides the poisoning problem, the price and its rare reserves are very important from the economic point of view and thus, developing efficient electrocatalysts free or containing low amounts of Pt is critical for the design of performant AEM-DGFCs. In this line, an unprecedented performance of about 269 mW cm−2 was achieved by using the surface dealloyed PtCo supported on carbon nanotube (CNT) anode catalyst with only 0.5 mgPt cm−2 in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA, with a commercial Fe-based cathode) for a direct crude glycerol (88 wt%)/O2 AEMFC operated at 80 °C and ambient pressure.452 This performance is higher than the one obtained using Pt/CNTs (229 mW cm−2), because of the d-band center of the Pt shift as a result of lattice strain and optimized electronic properties tuned by the sub-layer Co atoms, leading to weakened chemisorption of oxygenated species (see Fig. 24).

Recently, another transition metal used in combination in different proportions with Pt is copper. The tests made in fuel cells, directly fed with 2 M glycerol solution at 90 °C, indicated PtCu/C (90:10) as the most effective electrocatalyst in the oxidation reaction of the fuels when compared with Pt/C and Cu/C, due to the synergy between the constituents of the electrocatalyst.453 The recorded PPD for PtCu/C (90:10) is about 18 mW cm−2 while Pt/C and Cu/C showed 6 and 4 mW cm−2, respectively.
Extensive research has been carried out to replace Pt, and compared to Pt-based electrocatalysts, less expensive and widely available Pd and/or Au based electrocatalysts have been exploited as substitutes in AEM-DGFCs due to their outstanding stability in alkaline media. Carbon supported Pd and Au nanoparticle (NP) catalysts with small diameters (∼3.5 nm), prepared through a solution-phase reduction method, showed at 80 °C and 6.0 M KOH + 1.0 M crude glycerol a PPD of 93.9, and 50.1 mW cm−2 on Pd/C (40 wt%), and Au/C (40 wt%) anodes, respectively.439 As in the case of Pt/C, the concentration of crude glycerol plays an important role, its effect on fuel performances is depicted in Fig. 25b and c. The PPD presented a volcano-type behaviour against the crude glycerol concentration. The highest PPDs were obtained with 3.0 M crude glycerol with Au/C anode catalysts, and 1.0 M crude glycerol with Pd/C catalyst.

From Fig. 25b and c we can observe that the crude glycerol fuel yielded lower open circuit voltages (OCVs) and PPDs on Pd/C and Au/C anode AEMFCs, as compared with Pt/C performances. Also, compared to the results obtained with high purity glycerol (in Fig. 25a), fed with 2.0 M KOH + 1.0 M crude glycerol, the OCVs on Pd/C and Au/C anode AEMFCs dropped by 0.08 and 0.16 V, respectively, while the PPD was reduced by 10.7 and 27.2 mW cm−2, respectively. In the same study, the authors demonstrated that the anode electrode potential on Pd/C catalyst is governed by the catalyst surface coverage rate of both crude glycerol and OH−.
If the crude glycerol concentration increases, it will drastically reduce the adsorption of OH− and therefore a small increase in OCV is observed on the Pd/C anode. In the case of Au/C electrocatalyst, there are studies which indicated that the glycerol electro-oxidation will facilitate the formation of highly reactive glycerolate on the gold surface,454 which has, as a consequence, a higher OCV, and therefore, glycerol is expected to be a promising fuel for Au anode catalyst-based AEM-DGFCs.
Indeed, in a parallel study Li et al.454 obtained high performance using as the anode Au/C (30 wt% Au) electrocatalyst in an AEM-DGFC: at 80 °C, the OCV and PPD reached 0.67 V and 57.9 mW cm−2, respectively. However, in addition to the OH− concentration and GLY concentration, the OH− to GLY ratio seems to be as much as important for the high performance of DGFCs.455
Another study highlighted the excellent electrocatalytic activity of Pd supported on MWCNTs in terms of PPD, as high as 80 mW cm−2 in a fuel cell working with glycerol at 80 °C. The authors claim that such a remarkable electrocatalytic activity of Pd/MWCNTs can be associated both with the high dispersion of the metal particles and to the intrinsic properties of the MWCNTs.367
In the last few years, Li's group reported that the combination of two metals, Pd and Ag, with two different functions is more efficient than Pd for alcohol oxidation in general, and glycerol oxidation in particular.359 Thus, direct glycerol fuel cells achieved a PPD of 276.2 mW cm−2, using PdAg/CNTs (0.5 mgPd per MEA−1) with an average particle size of 2.7 nm, as an anode catalyst at 80 °C and ambient pressure.359 This underlines the positive role of Ag being involved in the cleavage of the C–C bond in the conversion of glycerol to oxalate, improving in this way the fuel efficiency of glycerol oxidation, while Pd can facilitate deprotonation of alcohol in a base electrolyte. In continuing this work, Pd, Ag mono, and bimetallic nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes (Ag/CNTs, Pd/CNTs, Pd1Ag1/CNTs, and Pd1Ag3/CNTs (20 wt%)) prepared using an aqueous-phase reduction method were used as working catalysts in an AEM-DGFCs.455 In this study, the PPDs are inferior to the one presented above, but also the cell parameters are different, such as different KOH concentrations (4 M vs. 6 M) or different reaction temperatures (60 °C vs. 80 °C). However, here also better results were obtained on the PdAg bimetallic catalyst due to the synergistic effect of promotion of intermediate aldehyde oxidation by Ag and C–C breakage of C3 oxygenates along with a larger amount of Pd0 presented on the PdAg nanoparticle surface.
In the same line, last year, Pd and Ag were deposited on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and it was shown that the interactions of PdAg NPs with rGO can control the performances through mediating the electronic characteristics of metal NPs and the reactant absorptions.456 With a peak current density of about 10328 A mgPd−1 on Pd0.05Ag0.95/rGO it was possible to overcome the performance achieved by PdAg (1:1) deposited on CNTs (20% metal loading) of 8530 A mgPd−1,359 the outstanding performance resulting from the intrinsic electron characteristics and lattice structure of PdxAgy(m)/rGO.456 Moreover, adding Ag to Pd, besides promoting the cell performance, also lowers the cost of the anode catalyst.
Since the Pd and Ag combination proved to be the most promising constituent for anodes in AEM-DGFCs, in order to further decrease the price of the fuel cell, parallel studies were conducted on PgAg/CNTs using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin films with different pore sizes as potential separators of fuel and oxidant streams.432
The performances of DGFCs with PTFE thin film were compared with an anion-exchange 116 membrane (A901) and the PPD of the DGFC with A901 AEM is 277.7 mW cm−2 which is 22.6% higher than the PPD of the porous PTFE thin film. However, the authors claimed that using a PTFE thin film separator without further synthesis or modification breaks the paradigm and demonstrates that a PTFE thin film separator is capable of operating with lower ionic resistance than benchmark state-of-the-art anion exchange membranes.432
Literature survey indicates other binary or ternary palladium based electrocatalysts, since the addition of a second or a third element may modify the electronic or surface strain effects of catalyst surfaces. Thus, electrocatalysts such as PdAu/C (50:50), PdSn/C (50:50), PdAuSn/C (50:40:10) and PdAuSn/C (50:10:40)431 or Pd87Cu13/C,457 Pt3Sn/C,458 PdAg and PdAu nanoparticles loaded on carbon black,459 Pd–(Ni–Zn)/C460 or using different supports, such as Pd/Ti nanotube arrays were used as anodes in AEM-DGFCs,461 but with lower performances than the one presented and discussed previously in this review.
The effect of electrocatalyst nanostructure and morphology on the cell performances has also been the subject of several studies. For instance, in this year, strain engineering was studied, a new strategy that may open new avenues to highly efficient catalysts for direct alcohol fuel cells and many other applications.462 In this direction, the highly strained Au–Ag–Pd alloy nanowires outperformed the less strained counterparts, showing mass activities of up to 11.1 A mgPd−1 for glycerol oxidation. The authors claimed that these activity values are an order of magnitude higher than those of the commercial Pd/C and higher than those of most Pd-based catalysts reported to date;463,464 suggesting promising applicability of these catalysts in DGFC applications.
Studies employing another interesting nanostructure were reported, for instance multimetallic Pd nanosponges with enhanced electrocatalytic activity for glycerol oxidation.465 The performances of PdAuNi nanosponge were due to the modified electronic states of Pd but also to the typical sponge nanostructures. The electrocatalytic activity was found to follow the order: Pd62Au21Ni17 > Pd64Au4Ni32 > Pd61Au31Ni8 >Pt/C. The peak current values of Pd62Au21Ni17 nanosponges reached 0.047 A cm−2, which was twice as high as that of Pt/C (0.023 A cm−2).


5.2.2 Noble metal-free electrocatalysts for AEM-DGFCs. 
Noble metal-free electrocatalysts for AEM-DGFCs as well as their oxides have attracted a lot of attention recently due to their low cost and abundance, yet their performances are below those of their counter-candidates based on noble metals. Thus, many electrocatalysts have been currently studied, especially based on Ni and Cu with good activity and high tolerance to CO poisoning.
For instance, a highly efficient electrocatalyst was developed using nickel nanoparticles supported on nitrogen doped graphene (Ni-NGr)466 that yielded a PPD of 10.4 mA cm−2. This performance is higher than the one obtained on nickel ion implanted modified indium tin oxide (Ni-NP/ITO),467 and nickel nanoparticles stabilized by PVP.468 The authors indicated that the improved performance originated from the very high distribution of Ni nanoparticles on N-graphene which possessed a high surface area, but also to the presence of a synergistic combination of Ni nanoparticles and NGr sheets that induced a fast electron transfer effect due to nitrogen doped graphene.
In a recent study, the influence of the electrodeposited Ni nanoparticle morphology, distribution, structure and performance for energy production from glycerol was investigated.469 The support, commercial 3D-carbon fibers (CFs), was first functionalized with O- and S-like functionalities via electrochemical pretreatment in NaOH and H2SO4 and it was found that the crystallite size of the electrodeposited Ni is reduced from 154 nm for the untreated CF to 45 and 54 nm for the activated CF in H2SO4 and NaOH, respectively. The peak current of the glycerol oxidation exponentially increases with the electrodeposited Ni loading, while Ni modified pretreated CFs exhibited ∼2 fold higher electrocatalytic activity for glycerol electrooxidation at all the studied Ni loadings, suggesting the essential enhancing role of the preactivation step. In order to further enhance the performance of the glycerol electro-oxidation in alkaline medium, macroporous Ni electrodes decorated with Cu particles were reported.470 Indeed, the decoration with Cu was valuable and the electrocatalytic activity was enhanced as confirmed by the negative shift in the onset oxidation potential (ca. 100 mV) together with an increase in oxidation current that is up to 1.5-fold during the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, compared to the undecorated Ni foam.
Recently, Co3O4 has attracted great attention, being extensively investigated in electrochemical oxidation reactions due to its rich redox chemistry that results in high electrochemical activity.471,472 In glycerol oxidation, Co3O4 exhibited a current of 115 mV at 1.524 V using a 5 M KOH solution.
Copper oxides were employed as electrocatalysts based on the same arguments as for cobalt oxides, but their performance is seriously affected by the poor inherent conductivity of Cu2O.473 To overcome this issue, Cu nanoparticles were incorporated into Cu2O to enhance the conductivity and as a consequence the electrocatalytic activity of the Cu2O catalysts due to synergistic effects between Cu and Cu2O.474 Further doping with other metals (Ni, Fe, Co) of Cu/Cu2O dendrite foam structures induced high electrocatalytic activity and stability for glycerol electrooxidation.475
Although enormous effort has been devoted to the development of anodes containing non-noble metals for AEM-DGFCs in the last few years, the goal of achieving high performance is still unreachable at this moment.

5.3 Acid direct glycerol fuel cells (PEM-DGFCs)
Due to the smaller ohmic losses as compared to the alkaline electrolysers, the PEM electrolysers represent the best choice for the electrolytic production of hydrogen.476 The advantage of low ohmic losses makes the PEM electrolysers to operate at current densities greater than 1 A cm−2, but require the use of mainly expensive and rare catalysts, such as platinum, ruthenium and iridium.
These appear to be the most stable and active electrode materials in acidic medium and represent the best option for performing the glycerol electro-oxidation process.477 Among them, platinum was considered unavoidable for a long time when talking about the activation and dissociative adsorption of glycerol at the electrode surface478 and the formation of adsorbed species that are further oxidized and leave behind protons. Thus, based on the use of platinum electrode materials, there are several papers dealing with the exploration of the processes arising from glycerol oxidation.444,479 Other mono-metallic480 or multi-metallic catalytic materials481–484 can perform the electro-oxidation of glycerol.
Nevertheless, it should be stated that in the field of PEM-DGFCs most of the studies mainly report phenomena that are more related to the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation and slightly or even not related to the real operation of the entire fuel cell ensemble.485,486 In the field of electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation, during the last decade, there were several excellent reviews477,487 focusing on describing the progress achieved in this research area.
5.4 Alkaline–acid direct glycerol fuel cells (AA-DGFCs)
Improvement of DGFCs is required as the electrochemistry of these cells is challenging in several ways. As mentioned in the previous section, in AEM-DGFCs, unlike other simple alcohols, the electro-oxidation of glycerol is a very complex process.488 Finally, at the anode, the glycerol is only partially oxidized to CO2 and the process ended up to oxygenated products due to the difficulty to perform two C–C bond cleavages and several parallel reactions. Another challenge is related to the reduction process taking place at the cathode. The Pt-specific PD of the most common Pt electrodes present values higher than 1.1 gPt kW−1, while the targeted value is less than 0.2 gPt kW−1. Such values can be achieved in theory at low Pt loadings (<0.05 mpPt cm−2).489 However, lowering the Pt loadings was not sufficient to reduce the Pt-specific PD, due to the voltage loss. One of the most important contributions to voltage loss is the sluggish O2 reduction kinetics taking place at the cathode, which is a four-electron process with low probability of occurrence (eqn (9)).490 O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O(9)
Besides all these aspects, the use of O2 as an oxidant implies the formation of water, which tends to flood the pores of gas diffusion layers and thus slowing down the reactant transport.270 To avoid these issues, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was found to be a good alternative as an oxidant to the cathode, with the following advantages: (i) the theoretical voltage of the fuel cell is considerably increased, from 1.23 V to 1.78 V at the cathode in DEFCs (see Fig. 15);270 (ii) H2O2 reduction process implies only the use of 2 electrons, thus offering a low activation barrier and therefore higher efficiency of the fuel cell (eqn (10)); (iii) can operate in an anaerobic environment, which might expand the use of DGFCs under underwater or outer space conditions491 and (iv) no water flooding problem as water is no longer a product derived from the reduction of H2O2.492 Moreover, H2O2 reduction in alkaline media has a theoretical voltage of 0.87 V, while under acidic conditions its reduction potential increased up to 1.78 V (see Fig. 15), making H2O2 a suitable oxidizer in acidic solutions. H2O2 + 2e− → 2OH−(10)
As presented in Fig. 15, combining the benefits of alkaline direct ethanol fuel cells with those of acid direct ethanol fuel cells (low activation of reduction reaction of H2O2 under acidic conditions), a new class with higher theoretical voltage values results (2.52 V). Therefore, extrapolating the data already existing for DEFCs, a new class of hybrid fuel cells using glycerol was born with the same goal of avoiding the drawbacks experienced with alkaline direct glycerol fuel cells and acid direct glycerol fuel cells. The expected theoretical voltage is 2.6 V.493
The structure of the hybrid fuel cell demands the use of: (i) an anode in an alkaline environment (usually sodium hydroxide) with a lower potential, (ii) a cationic exchange membrane (CEM) which allows the transfer of Na+ ions through the cathode, and (iii) a higher cathode potential in an acid environment (usually sulphuric acid). The schematic of such an alkaline–acid fuel cell using H2O2 as the oxidant is presented in Fig. 23b.
Thus, the alkaline environment at the anode appears when sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is added to the glycerol solution (anolyte), so that hydroxyl ions are formed (see eqn (11)) which further migrate through the CEM to the cathode. At the same time, the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) will take place (see eqn (12)). 14NaOH → 14Na+ + 14OH−(11) C3H8O3 + 14OH− → 3CO2 + 11H2O + 14e−(12)
The acid environment at the cathode side, however, appears when sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is added and forms protons and ionized SO42− (see eqn (13)). The ionized SO42− species will further interact with the Na+ ions coming from the anode with the formation of sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) at the cathode side. In the meantime, the formed protons at the cathode and the electrons coming from the anode will interact with the oxidizer (H2O2) and water is formed in the catholyte (see eqn (14)). 7H2SO4 → 14H+ + 7SO42−(13) 7H2O2 + 14H+ + 14e− → 14H2O(14)
Finally, the overall reaction of this alkaline–acid direct glycerol fuel cell, with the theoretical voltage of 2.6 V, can be given by the following eqn (15): C3H8O3 + 14NaOH + 7H2SO4 + 7H2O2 → 3CO2 + 25H2O + 7Na2SO4(15)
Taking into account that alkaline–acid direct glycerol fuel cells possess all the advantages of a good anode and cathode working in alkaline and acid media, respectively, the challenge in using these hybrid fuel cells is provided by the working parameter conditions. Therefore, in the following we will discuss in detail the issues experienced in AA-DGFCs and the best operational parameters found for the alkaline–acid direct glycerol fuel cells.

5.4.1 Operation conditions at the anode. 
Flow rate, glycerol concentration and variation of glycerol to sodium hydroxide ratio (G:NaOH) are usually evaluated to understand the influence of fuel flow and concentration. The flow rate of the fuel stream has very little impact on PD when the initial flow rate of 1 mL min−1 was increased to 2 mL min−1.494 This result was also confirmed by Sangkheaw et al.495 who found no significant difference in average current density for anolyte flow rates ranging from 1 mL min−1 to 2 mL min−1. However, decreasing the anolyte flow rate below 1 mL min−1 will result in a significant drop of current density.
Regarding the concentration, at a high G:NaOH ratio of 2, a low power density (PD) of 50 mW cm−2 was obtained, while a decrease of the ratio to 1 and further to 0.5 resulted in an increase of PD to 80 mW cm−2 and 105 mW cm−2, respectively.494 It can be concluded that the electrolyte concentration highly influences the overall fuel cell performance; for a constant NaOH concentration there is no reason to increase the glycerol concentration since this will determine a decrease of the PD. In this particular case, the pH ranges from 14.3 to 13.7 when the concentration of H2O2 increases. Such behaviour can be justified by the pH difference, which is directly related to the G:NaOH ratio. It was shown that a high pH value at the anode, when alcohols are used as the fuel, is very important for achieving a good cell performance.348

Table 13 presents the rate of oxidation of alcohols used in direct fuel cells and their dependency on the pH used. When the pH increases from 12 to 14 the oxidation rate increases by 1–2 orders of magnitude for each alcohol.

Therefore, the oxidation rate of alcohols increases with the pH and is the main reason why direct alcohol fuel cells work well when a high concentration of NaOH is found in the fuel stream. However, Sangkheaw et al.,495 who also studied the influence of the G:NaOH ratio on the cell performance, noticed that a high concentration of NaOH results in an increase in viscosity, which consequently leads to mass transport issues at the cathode interface.
Thus, a compromise between a low G:NaOH ratio and increased viscosity must be found in order to obtain the optimum cell performance. Another alternative is to improve the microporous layer (MPL) at the anode so the mass transfer loss can be improved. Banjong et al.493 investigated the effect of MPL at the anode, using a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic MPL. This study suggests that the use of a hydrophobic MPL induces less fluctuation in the current density of the cell compared with the hydrophilic MPL or no MPL cells. The cell polarization indicates that the no-MPL cells outperform, however the presence of the hydrophobic MPL induces a satisfactorily high and stable current density of 432.57 mA cm−2 with the standard deviation as low as 22.97 mA cm−2.


5.4.2 Operation conditions at the cathode. 
One of the most important chemical reaction aspects that deserve great attention is H2O2 transformation, at high potentials, that can occur at the cathode. Hydrogen peroxide is unstable at high potentials and besides the reduction reaction, undesired reactions such as decomposition can occur with release of oxygen, protons and electrons (see eqn (16)):496 H2O2 → O2 +2H+ + 2e−(16)
Major issues can appear if the produced oxygen performs a competing reduction reaction with water formation (eqn (9)), which develops a much lower potential (1.23 V) than the H2O2 reduction reaction (1.78 V), leading to, as a consequence, a low voltage fuel cell.497
Besides the disadvantage of oxygen reduction at low potentials, the presence of O2 as a gas at the cathode interface can be an impediment in the H2O2 accessibility to the surface, resulting in a reduced performance of the AA-DGFC.493 Therefore, the variation of operating conditions at the cathode can be an alternative to avoid the oxygen formation/reduction at the interface.
Oxidant flowrate. 
Variation of hydrogen peroxide flowrate has been seen as a solution to avoid the formation of a higher amount of oxygen during the undesired decomposition of the oxidant. Banjong et al.493 observed a constant current density of ∼260 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V, when applying 1, 3 and 6 mL min−1 flow rates of H2O2 at the cathode (20 wt% Pt/C). However, intermittent drops along the discharge period were observed when a slow flowrate was used (1 mL min−1) with a standard deviation of discharged current density of 40.33 mA cm−2. Increasing the flow rates to 3 and 6 mL min−1 diminished the standard deviation to 21.48 and 19.32 mA cm−2 (see Fig. 26). Thus, a low flowrate was associated with a deficient transport of the oxidant to the cathode surface. Cell polarization also confirmed that higher flow rates increase the cell performance. The optimized flow rate was found to be 3 mL min−1, since a lower flow rate resulted in unwanted drop of the current (as observed by chronoamperometry, Fig. 26), while at a higher flow rate, despite the high performance, the H2O2 utilization was too low.

Chino et al.494 observed an increase in power density when flow rates increased, when Pt/C and C black nanoparticles were used as cathodes. The working temperature of the cell was 60 °C with 1 M glycerol as the fuel and 2 M NaOH. The increase of oxidant stream from 1 mL min−1 to 2 mL min−1 yielded a significant increase of power density from 68 mW cm−2 to 105 mW cm−2, when Pt-free C black nanoparticles were used. Using a Pt/C cathode, a much higher power density was observed for a 1 mL min−1 flow rate (214 mW cm−2), which increased to 253 mW cm−2 for a 2 mL min−1 flow rate. Even a lower power density was obtained when a Pt-free cathode was used, the results obtained are not negligible taking into account the cost consideration.
Oxidant concentration. 
Based on eqn (13) and (14), the H2O2:H2SO4 molar ratio should be 1.0, which was why Banjong et al.493 decided to keep the molar ratio constant at this value and varied the concentration of H2O2 (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 mol L−1).
As can be observed in Fig. 27, the chronoamperograms show that the average current densities increase with the increase of H2O2 concentration as follows: for 0.1 mol L−1 H2O2 67.15 mA cm−2 current density was obtained, while an average current density of 239.67 mA cm−2 was observed for 10 times higher H2O2 concentration. The cell polarization tests confirmed the results obtained by chronoamperometry. However, an abrupt drop in cell voltage was observed near 60 mA cm−2 due to mass transfer limitation.

5.4.3 Other parameters. 
AA-DGFCs were investigated to determine the best working temperature for this class of fuel cells. Chronoamperometry and cell polarization confirmed the same conclusion that increasing the temperature from 30 to 80 °C will result in higher current density. Such behaviour can be rationalised by accepting that the high cell performance at high temperature is related to the high OCV, which is directly dependent on the temperature according to Nernst's equation.
The highest jump was observed when the temperature was increased from 70 to 80 °C. Such a rise of current density can be explained by the glycerol electro-oxidation kinetics in alkaline medium, which is enhanced at higher temperature. Despite the remarkable current density observed, higher fluctuations in magnitude were registered at 80 °C, therefore 70 °C was chosen as the best working temperature for the AA-DGFC.
The Nafion® ionomer content was found to increase the hydrophilicity of the anode when a hydrophilic MPL is used. Increasing the hydrophilicity will decrease the mass transport loss due to the high viscosity of the glycerol–NaOH anolyte. An optimum content of 20% Nafion® in MPL yielded a very good power density of the cell, 329 mW cm−2. A higher content of Nafion® will adsorb onto the MPL surface reducing its porosity, inhibiting the mass transport of the anolyte and deteriorating the cell performance.

6. New electrode configurations for portable hydrogen micro fuel cells
6.1 Short overview
Portable hydrogen fuel cells have received renewed attention in recent years driven by the progress made in fuel cells and hydrogen storage options.498 Compared with other portable fuel cells, their principal advantages are the easy anode reaction that allows for higher power densities per unit active area, and the cleaner combustion with sole production of water. On the other hand, they require stored hydrogen for operation which compromises the volume and weight energy densities. State-of-the-art hydrogen storage options for portable systems, like those based on metal-hydrides, complex compounds, and adsorbed hydrogen, practically attain around 10 gH2 kg−1 and 100 gH2 dm−3 storage densities that translate to effective power densities of 150 W h kg−1 and 1500 W h dm−3, depending on the storage media and assuming 50% conversion efficiency in the fuel cell. These values are similar to those of modern Li ion batteries.
According to the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV 485-09-23 (ref. 499)), a portable fuel cell is “a fuel cell not intended to be permanently fastened or otherwise secured in a specific location”. Conventional fuel cell designs of small size may fall in this category, without requiring any change in their configuration. A particular type of portable fuel cell is the micro fuel cell, “wearable or easily carried by hand together with the fuel cell cartridge” (IEV 485-09-21), which can produce electricity while ported in the hand of the user, like a battery. This type requires important changes in the cell design with respect to conventional fuel cells.
This section describes changes in the electrode configurations of a conventional PEMFC to make a portable micro fuel cell. PEMFC is most convenient for hydrogen portable applications due to the fast power on–off, low working temperature, and high-power density. The first part describes essential differences in the configuration and operation of a portable PEMFC with respect to a conventional PEMFC. In the second part, some main features of anodes and cathodes for portable PEMFCs are described.
6.2 Convective and passive PEMFC configurations
Conventional PEMFCs require a convective flow of the reactant gases through the electrodes, consisting of hydrogen and air streams flowing at the back of the anode and cathode, respectively, parallel to the cell plane. The main purpose is to accelerate the transport of reactants towards the catalyst layers and the rejection of the water produced, with other positive effects such as the homogenization of reaction rates and temperature over the active area region and helping the rejection of excess heat from the cell. Gas convection is essential to attain power densities above 1 W cm−2 with respect to the active area in conventional cells.
However, convective operation requires elements that increase the weight, volume, and cost of the stack and fuel cell system, which make it unsuitable for small portable power. The flow of gases is set by grooved plates at the back of the porous electrodes, called flow-field or bipolar plates, which also serve as current collectors and cell separators in a stack. Such plates, preferentially metal or graphite plates, contribute significantly to the weight (>70%) and volume (>80%) of the stack, and about 15% of the cost.500 In addition, auxiliary elements are necessary to maintain the gas flow, like fans, valves, purging and recirculation systems, gas conditioning, and stack thermal control, which further increase the weight, volume, and cost of the fuel cell system, while decreasing the power efficiency due to auxiliary consumption. The auxiliary charges and efficiency losses of the convective PEMFC configuration make it unsuitable when scaling to small portable applications, where the dimensions, weight, autonomy, safety, and operability requirements are different than in larger power systems.498
In the passive PEMFC configuration the fuel cell can generate a constant power without applying convective forces to gases. The anode and cathode operate in contact with static hydrogen and air atmospheres, which avoid the use of convective components and favour fuel cell system portability. The transport of gases and water occurs by passive processes, like capillary diffusion and natural convection caused by gradients in chemical potentials, density, and temperature within the electrodes and around the cell.501–503 Passive conditions require optimising liquid water interaction and transport within the porous electrodes, to sustain continuous current generation. Fig. 28 compares the schemes of a convective and a passive fuel cell.
 Fig. 28  Working principles of (a) the conventional-convective, and (b) the full-passive PEMFC configurations. 
The following parts of Section 6 describe changes implemented in the architecture of the anode and cathode to attain maximal power output in passive operation.
6.3 The passive dead-end anode
Operating in a static atmosphere of hydrogen, without forcing hydrogen flow or purging,504,505 allows for more simple auxiliary systems and the possibility to attain 100% faradaic efficiency, which benefit the portability of the fuel cell system. On the other hand, passive transport of hydrogen and heat requires changes in the anode electrode design to maintain high power production rates. The principal transport limitation in a passive anode is caused by the accumulation of water in the pores, coming from the cathode, which blocks catalyst centres and leads to cell failure.501,505 To avoid anode flooding, some changes in the conventional anode design must be introduced, like those described below. Of course, dry hydrogen feeding will be most convenient for a passive dead-end anode, like that obtained from a metal-hydride canister or from compressed hydrogen storage.

6.3.1 Water permeable window. 
Adding a water permeable window to the anodic chamber for water elimination from the cell was first reported by Karst et al.,506 and incorporated by some of us in functional portable fuel cells.504 The anodic window must be made of a hydrophilic membrane able to absorb and transport water driven by a chemical potential gradient in liquid water and/or vapour (humidity gradient). At the same time, the membrane must be impermeable to hydrogen gas, and have appropriate mechanical strength and chemical stability.
Materials for water permeation membranes are preferentially based on modified polymer matrices with hydrophilic components. Nafion® polymer has been used as an anodic PEMFC window,504 whose structure, combining a hydrophobic fluorocarbon backbone and hydrophilic side polar chains, favours channel formation upon swelling for liquid water conduction with a high self-diffusivity of 10−6 to 10−5 cm2 s−1.507 One drawback of this material is the high interfacial transport resistance across the vapour–Nafion® interface that hinders water vapour permeation, whereas it is negligible for the liquid–membrane interface.507,508 Consequently, anode flooding could occur in the cell before the window starts to conduct water. The use of other materials for anodic water permeation in a PEMFC is a matter of future research, such as those based on hydrophilic polymers like poly(ethylene oxide), PEO-copolymers, or hydrophobic polymers blended with hydrophilic materials.
The water permeable window must be suitably placed in the anodic chamber of the cell, for easy access of water, and probably assisted with hydrophilic paths to accelerate water movement. A cross-sectional scheme of a cell with a permeable water window in the anode chamber is shown in Fig. 29.
 Fig. 29  Cross-sectional scheme of a passive PEMFC cell with a passive dead-end anode with a water permeable window, and air-breathing cathode. Reproduced with permission from ref. 505, Copyright 2020 Elsevier Publications. 
The permeable water window has some drawbacks. It requires the anode back plane in contact with the ambient environment so it may be appropriate only for planar stacking configurations. In addition, it increases the volume and cost of the cell, so it may not be suitable for large serial stacking.


6.3.2 Hydrophobic anode. 
Another means to prevent dead-end anode flooding in a passive dead-end anode is by setting a hydrophobic catalyst layer that impedes cathodic water passing to the anode gas diffusion layer. A previous study has shown that using hydrophobic catalyst layers changes liquid water transport inside a PEMFC.509 For instance, a superhydrophobic cathode forces liquid water towards the anode in a conventional PEMFC and facilitates a high hydration level in the membrane which is convenient for the convective operation. In the passive PEMFC, a superhydrophobic anode may be more advantageous to prevent water back-diffusion from the cathode, since lower current densities are attained and membrane drying out is less probable due to the high-water content attained in the cathode (see below).
Hydrophobicity in the catalyst layer is achieved by adding a hydrophobic agent like PTFE.510 This procedure is used for the hydrophobization of gas diffusion layers to improve their liquid water transport. Its use in catalyst layers is also reported, though it poses problems due to the blocking of pores and Pt particles that may lead to a decrease in porosity, catalyst active area, and electronic conductivity of the layer. Such deleterious effects may be prevented by adding carbon nanotubes,511 but it increases the complexity of the catalyst layer preparation and operation.
The second way to confer hydrophobic character to the catalyst layer without the need for additives, is by depositing the layer using the electrospray technique, which confers a dendritic morphology with hydrophobic properties (Fig. 30).512,513 Electrospray deposition of catalytic suspensions of the Pt/C particles and the ionomer (Nafion®) has proven to be useful for the hydrophobization of the cathodic catalyst layer of conventional cells.509

6.4 The air-breathing cathode
In the passive air-breathing cathode, oxygen, water, and heat are exchanged with the ambient environment by natural forces. Among other properties, the passive cathode works under high saturation conditions in the catalyst and gas diffusion layers,505 with consequent increase in the tortuosity of the oxygen diffusion path which decreases the maximum current generation. At exceedingly high saturation levels, the access of oxygen to the catalyst particles may be available from the dissolved phase, even further limiting the current. To palliate the severe limitations posed by passive operation, conditions for liquid water interaction and passive transport within the pores must be optimised, involving the porous layers of the cathode and the cathodic plate design. Passive water transport also makes the cell response highly dependent on the ambient environment parameters, like humidity, temperature, natural convection, and cell orientation.

6.4.1 Limiting transport. 
The operation of a passive air-breathing cathode is mostly limited by the high liquid water content (saturation), which depends on the porosity of the catalyst and gas diffusion layers and on the hydrophobicity of pore walls. Saturation conditions give rise to two transport regimes for liquid water.514 Under high saturation values, above the irreducible value (s > sw0), funicular saturation connects both faces of the electrode with liquid water domains which activates the capillary transport driven by a difference in water pressure between the cathode–membrane interface and the ambient environment. Below the irreducible saturation, the absence of liquid paths allows water transport by slow evaporation–condensation events between the insular liquid domains. Since passive cathodes normally operate under high saturation, the evacuation of water by capillary transport is active in the steady-state, and the limiting current density (iL,H2O) can be related to a liquid water pressure difference by means of Darcy's law: (17)where F (= 96485 C mol−1) is the Faraday constant, ρw (= 1 kg m−3) the water density, Mw (= 18 g mol−1) the water molar weight, kw (m2) the intrinsic water permeability, μw (Pa s) the viscosity of water, pw (Pa) the water phase pressure, and L the electrode gas diffusion layer thickness (for simplification liquid water transport limitation will be entirely attributed to water content of this layer which is reasonable because it is normally much thicker than the catalyst layer). kw depends on water saturation (kw = k(sw − sw0)/(1 − sw0)m, where k is the permeability of the porous phase, sw0 the irreducible water saturation, and m = 4.5 for the gas diffusion layer of fuel cell electrodes). The water pressure gradient is related to the water saturation gradient in the porous electrode by the capillary pressure (pc): (18)where pg (Pa) is the gas phase pressure, σ (N m−1) the surface tension, θi the internal contact angle, ε the layer porosity, and J (s) the Leverett function.509 The gas pressure (pg) is considered constant in the porous media and equal to the ambient air pressure. Saturation of the porous layers also limits oxygen access to the catalyst layer, leading to a limiting current given by the equation: (19)where c* is the oxygen concentration in the ambient environment and Deff is the effective diffusivity of the porous layer, which for a gas diffusion layer is given by:515 Deff = Dbε3.5(1 − s)2.15(20)where Db is the open space, outside the porous layer, diffusivity.

Eqn (17) and (19) describe the two possible current limitations by the gas diffusion layer, by oxygen and by water, as a function of water saturation. Both expressions are compared in Fig. 31 for values of standard PEMFC electrodes, showing that limiting conditions change from water transport to oxygen transport at about s = 0.5, where a maximum limiting current can be attained under passive conditions of 1.5 A cm−2. Experimental values of limiting currents normally fall below 0.5 A cm−2, reflecting the passive air-breathing cathode operating under oxygen transport limitation due to high pore saturation, s > 0.7. The optimal saturation condition is around s = 0.4–0.6, which improves oxygen diffusivity while maintaining sufficient water content for electrochemical reactions and capillary transport. Such values require the preparation of porous layers with an optimised porous structure and hydrophobicity, applying to the cathode the same methods described in 6.3.2 for anode hydrophobization.
 Fig. 31  Limiting currents at a passive air-breathing cathode as a function of water saturation, according to the expressions in eqn (17) and (19). Parameter values: k = 3 × 10−8 cm2, μw = 10−3 Pa s, L = 400 μm, σ = 72 × 10−5 N cm−1, θi = 150°, ε = 0.8, c* = 8.5 × 10−5 mol cm−3, Db = 0.20 cm2 s−1, T = 295 K, p = 101325 Pa, RH = 0.3, J (s) as in ref. 516. 


6.4.2 The cathodic plate. 
The cathodic plate of a passive air breathing cell provides compression by clamping pressure to decrease contact resistance between the electrode and the current collector. At the same time, it allows the exchange of air, water, and heat with the ambient environment. Many designs are proposed based on planar rigid plates perforated with holes, as shown in Fig. 32a, where parameters like hole shape and size, open area ratio, plate material, and thickness, must be optimized to improve mass transport and heat transport, and decrease the contact resistance.517 Cell water removal and emission from the plate to the ambient environment must be optimised via natural forces (evaporation, natural convection, or gravity).

A columnar plate has recently been used to maximize water removal rate and air-breathing performance (see Fig. 32b).505 It allows for a higher mobility of water droplets over the cathode surface which facilitates their removal. The columnar plate makes the cell response dependent on orientation, as shown in Fig. 33.
 Fig. 33  Comparing fuel cell performances with a columnar passive air-breathing cathode in three orientations. Reproduced with permission from ref. 505, Copyright 2020 Elsevier Publications. 
The cathodic plate also has a significant effect on heat dissipation from the air-breathing cell. Heat generated by entropic and Joule heating may make the temperature of the cell too high for PEMFC operation. Dissipation by natural forces depends on the cell material, plate design, ambient conditions, and orientation. A reduced heat transfer occurs with the cathode facing downwards,519 and may limit cell response by membrane drying.520 Passive air breathing must operate in a delicate equilibrium between membrane drying and electrode flooding which rely on the optimal design of the cell and packaging.521

6.5 Summary
Characteristics of electrodes and cell designs are described for the adaptation of a hydrogen PEMFC to a portable micro fuel cell. The portability is favoured by changing from a convective flow of reactants to passive feeding. Passive feeding poses significant limitations that require making necessary changes in electrode and cell configurations to allow for a continuous operation with maximal power delivery. The passive anode should work under full dead-end conditions, without purging, to attain 100% faradaic efficiency. Avoiding the flooding of the anode is essential for a continuous operation. The passive air-breathing cathode requires optimising the action of natural forces for the exchange of water and oxygen with the ambient environment. Gross power attainable with a passive PEMFC is typically lower than that with a conventional-convective PEMFC, but the overall net system power and power densities are adequate for portable applications with similar performance to modern batteries.
7. Concluding remarks
In the group of the emerging, clean energy technologies comprising the solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, and fusion power technology, fuel cells are in a pole position with regard to the effective and practical way of conversion of hydrogen into electricity.
This review article describes and discusses the state-of-the-art of the electrocatalysts used in the last few years in different fuel cells. It is important to note that the relationship between physico-chemical properties and cell performances is decisive for the design of efficient electrocatalysts.
Various catalysts with unique structures and morphologies, such as nanowires, nanosheets, and assembly structures, have been manufactured in recent years, and some of them show excellent catalytic performance characteristics. It is evident that the electrocatalysts must meet several stringent criteria to achieve reliable, high and constant performances, such as (1) high porosity adequate for alcohol and oxygen transport, (2) sufficient electronic conductivity; (3) chemical stability and high C and CO tolerance (assured by well-defined chemical states, which do not suffer major changes) in a reducing fuel atmosphere; (4) compatibility with other DAFC components; (5) ease of fabrication; (6) relatively low cost induced by avoiding the use of Pt or using an ultra-low Pt amount.
Improving the portability of hydrogen PEMFC and DAFC may require new electrode configurations as described in Section 6. In particular, the structures facilitating the passive operation of the anode and cathode are most convenient to alleviate weight and volume, and to increase the net power production of the systems by avoiding auxiliary components required in the conventional-convective fuel cells.
The results discussed in this paper show that fuel cells are promising power sources for portable applications for the near future. Most appropriate are low temperature fuel cell types fed with hydrogen (Section 2), methanol (Section 3), ethanol (Section 4), or glycerol (Section 5). Hydrogen fuel cells provide high power density (>1000 mW cm−2) in conventional cell configurations, but a decrease is expected in real portable operation, under passive feeding conditions. These cells rely on portable hydrogen storage options which limit the energy density. Liquid fuels allow for higher energy density, and promising power densities have been attained in laboratory cells, above 200 mW cm−2 for methanol, and 100 mW cm−2 for ethanol and glycerol. Future improvements should concentrate on optimized electrode and fuel cell designs for reliable and high performance operation under portable power conditions.
