    , Accepted 2nd July 2021First published on 8th July 2021AbstractSaline organic wastewater (SOW) is more dangerous to the environment and difficult to clean as compared to ordinary wastewater. Traditional photothermal materials can extract distilled water from wastewater through interfacial solar evaporation. However, the condensed wastewater after evaporation accumulates high concentrations of organic pollutants, salts, and bacteria. Herein, for the first time we design a flexible multifunctional porous foam through in situ growth of rough CoNi2S4 nanoneedle array on a PVDF framework (SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam), which can achieve a high evaporation rate of 2.63 kg m−2 h−1 under one-sun illumination. Meanwhile, SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam exhibits significant enhancement in PMS activation for SOW degradation due to the coexistence of Co0 and Ni0. The super-hydrophilic CoNi2S4 nanoneedle array and intrinsic nature of metallic sulfides endow the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam with strong salt resistance and excellent antimicrobial properties. As a result, the catalytic and evaporation cascade system model proves the convenience of practical application of the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam, which can efficiently collect concentrated brine and freshwater (1.06 kg m−2 h−1) during long-term outdoor evaporation of SOW. This work provides an inspiration for the future development of high-performance and multifunctional wastewater treatment materials and devices.
1. Introduction
The growing concerns about water scarcity and the awareness of environmental sustainability have renewed the global interest in effective reuse and treatment of highly polluting wastewater. Saline organic wastewater (SOW), such as dyeing wastewater, is generally more difficult to treat and will cause greater pollution to the environment than ordinary wastewater. Traditional biological treatment methods fail to efficiently treat SOW due to the large amount of inorganic salts (∼6.0 wt% of NaCl or Na2SO4) in SOW,1,2 which can cause microbial viability reduction, plasmolysis, and even the death of most microorganisms.3 In contrast, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), particularly sulfate radical (SO4˙−)-based AOPs, have become an attractive approach for treating wastewater with a high concentration of refractory organic pollutants. Moreover, previous work shows that the presence of Cl− is beneficial for PMS activation by generating HClO.4 Inspired by these, PMS activation is an effective method for treating organic pollutants in SOW. However, the high salinity cannot be removed by AOPs, in a sense, it can be considered a resource. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop alternative methods to obtain concentrated brine and recover distilled water.
Solar water evaporation as an ancient but useful technology is often used for the desalination of sea water.5 Especially, the recent emergence of the interfacial solar evaporation (ISE) technology has stimulated a tremendous upsurge of interest due to its high efficiency of local heating at the air–water interface for distilled water collection.6,7 However, there are few research studies that focus on SOW treatment through the ISE strategy. At the same time, the study of obtaining concentrated brine from SOW was also ignored. This may be attributed to the complex composition of SOW, making the ISE process unsatisfactory because (i) the concentration of organic pollutants in wastewater increases during the SE process, making post-treatment more difficult; (ii) the accumulation of salt ions and bacteria easily causes salt crystallization and biological corrosion, threatening the long-term stability of evaporation devices. Given these concerns, combining ISE with AOPs may be an alternative strategy to address their own drawbacks and efficiently promote the recycling of distilled water from SOW. Nevertheless, the challenge is to explore the desired functional materials with high photothermal conversion efficiency and high PMS oxidation activity.
Transition metal sulfides are usually low cost and possess strong absorption capacity of wide wavelength range solar light due to the band gap absorption, attracting increasing attention in solar evaporation. Besides the above merits, cobalt based bimetallic sulfides (e.g., CoFeSx, CoNiSx, CoCuSx, etc.) have been used as active components for PMS activation and display good antibacterial property.8,9 Based on these, cobalt based bimetallic sulfides can be the ideal material with dual-functions of ISE and PMS activation for treating SOW.10 Until now, their potential for photothermal transformation and synergistic degradation ability is far from being systematically explored. Furthermore, the brittle and powdery inorganic nanomaterials are difficult to assemble into photothermal components independently.11 Recently, organic–inorganic composite materials have gained intensive attention for water pollution control due to their easy multi-functionalization ability.12–14 As one of the polymer materials, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has the potential to be used as the substrate for cascade systems of advanced oxidation and solar evaporation processes due to its resistance of oxidation, UV radiation and weather. For example, Li. et al. reported a heterostructure PVDF membrane loaded with Au nanoparticles or carbon black for enhancing solar steam generation.15 Generally, a 3D structure usually tends to exhibit more remarkable performance than 2D materials.16 However, PVDF-based materials usually involve the use of toxic organic solvents and have small pores, which are not conducive to the capture of solar light. Therefore, it is of great importance to exploit a 3D PVDF substrate coupled with dual-functional cobalt based bimetallic sulfide nanoparticles for solar evaporation and wastewater treatment.
Herein, we prepared centimeter-sized porous PVDF foam with tunable porosity by the molten molding method without using organic solvents. Through layer-by-layer growth of polydopamine (pDA) and CoNi2S4 nanoneedles, the super-hydrophilic SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam was obtained for wastewater purification and fresh water/concentrated brine recovery in a self-designed cascade treatment system. By virtue of its high porosity and dense nanotube array structure, the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam can effectively and rapidly degrade SOW, giving 98% degradation efficiency within 6 min. Moreover, taking advantage of the hierarchical branch architecture and excellent light absorption, the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam can produce concentrated brine and recover freshwater from saline dyeing wastewater (SDW) with a mean distilled water yield rate of 1.06 kg m−2 h−1 in the outdoor test through a self-designed cascade system. Meanwhile, the superhydrophilicity and macro-porous water pathways endow SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam with excellent salt-resistant and antibacterial properties. We believe this stable and highly efficient 3D multifunctional foam can be a promising material for SOW treatment by combining the advanced oxidation process and solar evaporation technology in one unit.

2.2 Fabrication of LDH based PVDF foam
Fabrication of porous PVDF foam and pDA/PVDF: a certain mass of PVDF–HFP powder and NaCl salt template (mass ratio 1:7) was taken in a mortar, and ground for 20 minutes. Then 8.0 g of the above mixture was transferred into molds and heated at 200 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the mold with PVDF–HFP/NaCl composites was soaked in hot water and the water was renewed frequently to remove the salt template. Make sure that the salt template is completely removed by weighing. Finally, porous PVDF foam was obtained. The PVDF foam with different shapes can be obtained by using molds with different sizes. The pDA/PVDF foam was prepared by in situ polymerization of dopamine on the PVDF surface. In detail, 100 mL of tris–HCl buffer solution was used to adjust the pH to 8.5 and 0.2 g of dopamine was dissolved in the solution. Then 3 pieces of PVDF foam were soaked into dopamine solution and shaken for 12 h at room temperature at 150 rpm. Finally, the pDA/PVDF foams were obtained through washing with DI water and drying.
Fabrication of CoNiLDHs–pDA/PVDF foams and SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams: typically, 5.0 mmol of CoCl2·6H2O, 2.5 mmol of NiCl2·6H2O and 8.0 mmol of urea were dissolved in 60 mL of DI water. After wetting with ethanol, two pieces of pDA/PVDF foam were put into the above solution and immersed for 120 minutes. The mixture solution and pDA/PVDF foam were transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated to 90 °C for 12 h. Thereafter, the obtained CoNiLDHs–pDA/PVDF foams were washed with DI water and dried at 80 °C. In the sulfur modified process, the CoNiLDHs–pDA/PVDF was soaked in TAA solution (0.02 M, 0.03 M and 0.04 M) and maintained at 120 °C in an autoclave for 8 h. The obtained foams were labeled 0.02SCoNi–pDA/PVDF, 0.03SCoNi–pDA/PVDF and 0.04SCoNi–pDA/PVDF, respectively. The unlabelled SCoNi–pDA/PVDF refers to the foam prepared with 0.02 M TAA solution.
2.3 Degradation experiments
Batch experiments were conducted in a lab-made flow degradation system containing one piece of as-prepared foams, PMS and 250 mL of the targeted pollutant. The initial pH was adjusted with 0.1 M H2SO4 or NaOH. At each time interval, the reaction solution (1.5 mL) was withdrawn and quenched with pure methanol (0.5 mL). The influence of different parameters (including PMS concentration, anion influence and flow rate etc.) on the degradation performance was studied by the controlled variable method. MB (methylene blue) was used as the representative of dye pollutants to screen the optimal composite foams. In addition, methyl orange (MO, 20 mg L−1), rhodamine B (RhB, 20 mg L−1), tetracycline (TC, 20 mg L−1) and bisphenol A (BPA, 20 mg L−1) were selected to evaluate the universality of the optimal composite foams.
2.4 Solar evaporation tests
A solar light simulator (300 W xenon lamp) was used for solar evaporation. The mass change of the solution was measured using an electronic balance. The outdoor solar evaporation tests were performed during August to September at Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China. The evaporation rate (m, kg m−2 h−1) and enhancement factor (EF) were calculated using the following equation. m = Δm/(S × t)(1) EF = m (evaporator)/m (blank)(2)where Δm (kg) is the mass change in 1.0 h, S (m2) is the area of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams, t (1.0 h) is the time of solar irradiation. m (blank) refers to the water mass change in solar evaporation without absorbers.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of as-prepared foams
The 3D multifunctional interfacial solar evaporators were synthesized through three steps, including dopamine self-polymerization and two-step continuous hydrothermal method, as depicted in Fig. 1a. Firstly, pure PVDF foams with a sheet-like polymer skeleton (Fig. S1a and b†) and smooth surface were prepared via the molten molding method by using salt as the template. The PVDF skeleton had some large void structure (about 300–500 μm), which was favorable for light penetration and absorption. After modification of the pDA layer, the sheet-like polymer skeleton turned rough clearly, and there were many irregular pDA particles adhered (Fig. S1c and d†). Owing to the chelation of the catechol group in pDA, the CoNi-LDHs can uniformly grow on the pDA/PVDF surface and form a vertically aligned nanoneedle array structure (Fig. S1f†). In the last step, the black SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam was successfully prepared after sulfofication. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, the surface and interior were uniformly black, suggesting that the needle-like CoNi-LDHs nanoarrays were totally sulfured. Moreover, SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams with different shapes were easily available for solar evaporation through changing the molds (Fig. 1d). The sulfofication transformed the smooth CoNi-LDH nanoneedles into a rough structure (Fig. S1f†, 1f–h), which is mainly because the anion-exchange reactions of S2− ions results in the growth of irregular nanoparticles on the nanoneedles.17 This rough nanoneedle array structure will benefit the utilization of light energy and the evaporation of water. And mapping analysis (Fig. 1i) showed that the elements S, Co, and Ni were uniformly distributed in the PVDF polymer region, confirming the sulfured CoNi-LDH uniform array structure.

Porosity is an important factor for loading of LDHs and further influences the catalytic and light absorption performance. The porosity (ε) of the foams was measured by a simple liquid displacement method, as shown in the equation , where ρc is the density of PVDF (1.785 g cm−3) and ρH is the density of water (0.998 g cm−3). Ww and Wd are the weight of wet and dry foams (g), respectively. As shown in Table S1,† the porosity of the PVDF skeleton could be adjusted by changing the mass ratio of the salt template. The porosity increased with increase of the salt template content. However, when the mass ratio of PVDF and NaCl reached 1:9, the porosity of PVDF (1:9) barely increased and the mechanical strength also slightly decreased. Therefore, the optimal mass ratio was 1:7 and used for further research. The ε of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams was as high as 88.13%. This high porosity and large void structure will favor contact with pollutants and absorption of light.
XRD and FTIR patterns are used to confirm the organic–inorganic composite foam structure and its chemical composition. As shown in Fig. 2a, PVDF showed two characteristic peaks at about 20.12° and 35.2°, which were attributed to (200) and (001) of β-phase PVDF, respectively. After pDA modification, the XRD pattern almost did not change, indicating that the PVDF foam skeleton retains its original structure. SCoNi–pDA/PVDF (the absence of a special label refers to the preparation in 0.02 M of TAA solution) constructed by the two-step hydrothermal method had two characteristic peaks at around 31.24° and 55.01°, corresponding to (311) and (440) planes of CoNi2S4, which indicates that CoNi-LDH was transformed into CoNi2S4 during sulphuration and adhered on the PVDF foams. As shown in Fig. 2b, the typical vibration peaks of H–C–H and F–C–F in the PVDF polymer were located at about 1397 and 1160 cm−1, respectively. After modification of pDA, the peak intensity had hardly changed and a broad peak at around 3000–3500 cm−1 was found, which can be attributed to hydroxyl groups. For SCoNi–pDA/PVDF, all the characteristic peaks of the PVDF polymer decreased significantly and the peak of hydroxyl groups increased, which was probably due to the dense attachment of CoNi2S4.

The XPS spectrum was tested for further proving the change of chemical composition after sulfofication (Fig. 2c and d). New peaks of Co, Ni, and N were observed in CoNiLDH–pDA/PVDF in comparison with pure PVDF foams, and the peak intensity of C and F clearly decreased. After the sulfofication, S was also detected (Fig. S2a†), indicating that S existed as pyrite lattice persulfide (S2−) and formed metal sulfide in the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF.18 High-resolution Co 2p spectra of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF were also analyzed and are displayed in Fig. 2d. It clearly shows that a new peak at about 778.3 eV appeared, which represented the presence of zero valence cobalt (Co0).19 Meanwhile, the Co3+ peaks (780.98 and 796.80 eV) and Co2+ peaks (782.99 and 798.50 eV) clearly decreased, indicating that Co3+/Co2+ was partly reduced to Co0 during the sulfofication process. This may be due to the production of H2S in the presence of thioacetamide during the fabrication process. H2S with its reducing ability can reduce a part of Co2+ to Co0.20 As we know, the existence of Co0 can accelerate the circulation of Co3+/Co2+ and further promote the PMS activation. The Ni 2p spectra were also observed in a similar situation, in which Ni0 appeared at around 852.7 eV (Fig. S2b†). Co0 and Ni0 can serve as metal centers for enhancement of PMS activation, thus enabling 3D SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams to efficiently degrade organic pollutants.
3.2 Catalytic activity and optimization of conditions of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams
As shown in Fig. 3a, the catalytic degradation of wastewater over SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams was tested through a simple self-designed “packed column” circulating degradation system (which can be used in subsequent cascade systems, see Fig. 7). In the absence of PMS, about 10% of MB can be removed using SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams within 6 min (Fig. S4a†) probably due to the porous structure and the pDA coating of the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams, which can not only enhance the absorption of organics but also facilitate the catalysis. The CoNiLDH–pDA/PVDF can degrade almost 100% MB solution within 7 min by the addition of PMS (Fig. 3b). After sulfuration, the SCoNiLDH–pDA/PVDF foam showed a clear increase in degradation efficiency with the degree of sulfuration. The best degradation effect was obtained by using 0.02 M TAA as the sulfur source, which is probably because an appropriate amount of Co0 can efficiently improve PMS activation in the degradation system. Secondly, the effects of several parameters for oxidation reactions were studied. The circulation flow rate of MB solution is also important for the degradation efficiency of this system. Appropriate flow rate ensures adequate contact between the 3D porous foams and contaminants. Fig. 3c shows that increase of the flow rate from 1.2 to 3.6 L h−1 can shorten the time taken for complete decolorization of 250 mL MB solution, which owing to the high porosity (88.13%, see Table S1†) ensures adequate contact between the sulfuretted CoNi-LDH nanoneedle array and contaminants. The MB degradation efficiencies further increased from 48.43% to 93.86% in one minute with increase in the PMS concentration from 0.1 mM to 1.0 mM (Fig. 3d). However, many previous research studies proved that further increase of PMS concentration cannot improve the reaction rate due to the self-quenching effect of the very high concentration of PMS,21 which was quite different from our system. It is probably because the high loading of sulfuretted LDHs on PVDF foams (the average loading was around 0.0465 g CoNi2S4/1.0 g PVDF foam, Table S1†) provided efficient catalytic sites for PMS activation. The SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams were also good at degrading other organic pollutants (Fig. S5a–c†), such as TC, RhB and BPA, whose degradation efficiencies within 10 min were 86.68%, 95.50% and 45.84%, respectively, indicating the outstanding catalytic capacity of the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam system. Finally, different background solvents such as tap water and river water were used to study the catalytic degradation process (see Fig. S6 in the ESI† for details).

(c) Degradation efficiency of MB over optimal 0.02SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam under different (c) flow velocities and (d) PMS concentrations. Catalysis conditions: 250 mL of 20 mg L−1 pollutants, pH = 7, PMS concentration: 0.5 M, room temperature and flow velocity = 1.2 L h−1. 
As we know, dyeing wastewater contains a large amount of inorganic salts, such as NaCl (∼6.0 wt%) or Na2SO4 (∼5.6 wt%), which comes from the synthesis of dyes and the dyeing process.3 Thus, we prepared simulated dyeing wastewater containing Na2SO4 and/or NaCl and studied their effect on the degradation process. As shown in Fig. 4a, sulfate ion (SO42−) had an obvious inhibition effect on the MB degradation, and its MB degradation efficiency was 60.19% within 5 min. In contrast, a high Cl− dose will significantly accelerate the degradation rate (decolorization rate of 99.56% in 1.0 min). Similar results were also obtained in the presence of ∼6.0 wt% of NaCl and Na2SO4 (the red and blue lines almost coincide). These may be explained as the formation of HClO through a series of electron transfer reactions (eqn (3)–(7)) would promote the degradation, which is consistent with previous reports:22 SO4˙− + Cl− ↔ SO42−+ Cl˙(3) Cl˙ + Cl− → Cl2˙−(4) Cl˙ + Cl˙ → Cl2(5) Cl2˙− + Cl2˙− → Cl2 + 2Cl−(6) Cl2 + H2O → HClO + H+ + Cl−(7)

Based on the above results, we further simulated the saline dyeing wastewater (SDW) using a mixture of three dyes (RhB + MO + MB) with saline water (6 wt% Na2SO4 and 6 wt% NaCl) for evaluating the degradation performance of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF. As shown in Fig. 4b, the characteristic peaks of dyes disappeared after complete degradation, indicating that the chromogenic groups of dye molecules were destroyed. Moreover, the degradation products and possible degradation pathway were also studied by LC-MS. The mass spectra of the initial mixed dye solution before the reaction are shown in Fig. S7a.† The m/z peaks at about 453, 326 and 283 correspond to the parent RhB molecule,23 ionized state of MO13 and MB molecule,24 respectively. After the degradation, some of the main m/z peaks at about 353, 316, 277 and 230 were observed, which were derived from the degradation of the mixed dyeing wastewater (Fig. S7b and c†). Firstly, MB degradation was initiated by the attack of hydroxyl radicals and the formation of the hydroxylated compound followed by the substitution of subsequent hydroxyl groups (m/z = 316, Fig. S8a†). After such a hydroxylation the MB ring broken and some complex organic compounds were formed (m/z = 230, Fig. S8a†). The degradation process of RhB involves deethylation, cleavage of chromophores and opening of the ring.25 The peak at m/z = 278 was attributed to one of the products of RhB ring opening and the relevant chemical formula is shown in Fig. S8b.† Moreover, MO degradation pathway usually involves hydroxylation and demethylation. The loss of two methyl groups to form new intermediates (m/z = 277, Fig. S8c†) was attributed to the breakage of the N–C bond of the dimethylamino group in the MO molecule. Finally, these intermediates were further fragmented into some small products.
3.3 Solar evaporation and salt rejection performance of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam
The performance of the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams for solar water evaporation was assessed using a floating self-suction equipment with the evaporation surface separated from bulk water (Fig. 5a). A xenon lamp (300 W) was used as the simulative light source and is placed at a distance from the evaporator to ensure the test processing under 1.0 sun irradiation. To avoid the additional energy input, the aperture was placed between the evaporator and light source to ensure the incident light spot size was the same as the foam size. The digital photographs of the evaporator setup are shown in Fig. S9a–c.† The evaporator consists of photothermal SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam, PE foam and cotton gauze. PE foam was used to isolate photothermal foam from bulk water, thus inhibiting the loss of heat conduction during water evaporation. Owing to the superhydrophilicity of the cotton gauze and SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam (Fig. 5b), one of the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams can became completely wetted within 30 s (Fig. 5c), confirming that the water can be transported from bulk water to photothermal foams rapidly for water evaporation.

(b) Water contact angle and (c) the time-dependent water transportation from bulk to the photothermal SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams, where the blue line shows the border between wet and dry areas on the foam surface. (d) Absorption spectra of different SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams. (e) IR images of the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams under 1 sun illumination during water evaporation. (f) Mass change of water over SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams under 1 sun illumination for water. 
The ideal evaporator should show a broadband and strong solar light absorption. As shown in Fig. 5d, the optical absorption of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF in the visible and infrared regions (from 200 nm to 2500 nm) was measured using a UV vis-NIR spectrometer. 0.02SCoNi–pDA/PVDF had an excellent solar energy absorption of about 94.2–96.2% across the whole measurement range, which was higher than that of 0.03SCoNi–pDA/PVDF and 0.04SCoNi–pDA/PVDF. Moreover, the temperature distribution of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams was recorded using an infrared (IR) camera to reveal the temperature change during evaporation (Fig. 5e). Under the 1 kW m−2 simulated solar light irradiation, the surface temperature of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam rose from 18.8 °C to 26.1 °C within 5 min and further increased to 31.8 °C in 10 min. These results demonstrated the good performance of the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam in the conversion of solar energy to thermal energy.
The interfacial evaporation efficiency of various foams was recorded by measuring the weight loss (due to water evaporation). All samples showed a linear increase of weight loss with irradiation time (Fig. 5f). Under one-sun irradiation, the evaporation rate of water was only 0.66 kg m−2 h−1. And the evaporation rate was 2.10 kg m−2 h−1 for pDA/PVDF, due to the inherent photothermal performance of pDA.26 On the other hand, 0.02SCoNi–pDA/PVDF showed the highest evaporation rate of 2.63 kg m−2 h−1, which was 3.98 times higher than that of water (EF = 3.98). However, further sulphuration led to the reduction of the evaporation rate, which may be because the rough nanoneedle-like array structure was replaced by irregular bulks (see SEM images in Fig. S10a and b†), resulting in a reduction in water evaporation sites. After 7 h of solar evaporation, the used foam can easily hold a weight of about 200 g (Fig. S10c†), proving that it had good stability and mechanical strength. In addition, the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams also exhibited excellent flexibility. When a piece of 1.6 kg of metal (Fig. S10d†) was placed onto the foam, it was compressed and could quickly return to original size after removal of the metal (Fig. S10e†). Therefore, the 3D SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam exhibits good mechanical strength and excellent flexibility.
To systematically assess the performance of the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam thermal evaporator, the solar-to-steam-conversion efficiency η was calculated as:27 (8)where m is the evaporation rate (m, kg m−2 h−1, with the dark evaporation (0.15 kg m−2 h−1) over the sample subtracted), Δvap × H is the phase change enthalpy of water from liquid to vapor which is ∼40.637 kJ mol−1, M is the molar mass of water, and P is the solar power density (1 kW m−2). According to the above formula, the apparent conversion efficiency of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams can be calculated to be 155.52% under one-sun irradiation, which was higher than that of pDA/PVDF (120.76%) and pure water (31.98%). It is noted that the apparent conversion efficiency is as high as 155.52%, which appears to be against the energy conservation rules. It is probably due to the following reasons. As we know, for a 3D absorber, it is recommended to use the top projected plane for the calculation of conversion efficiency.28 So, the efficient irradiation area is selected to be the upper surface of the foam because of the vertical incidence of simulated solar light. Even though the side surfaces of the absorbers do not absorb much solar energy, it can harvest energy from the environment by convective coupling with radiative heat transfer processes and further accelerates the water evaporation.29 Therefore, owing to this energy recovery mechanism, we believe that the high conversion efficiency of 155.52% was just based on the calculation formula and can still be used to compare with other photothermal materials.
On the other hand, to demonstrate the evaporation performance of the 3D SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams more accurately, the accumulated water yield during evaporation from water or treated SDW was recorded for 5 h under simulated one-sun irradiation. As shown in Fig. S11† and Table 1, the average hourly yield of evaporated water was 1.96 kg m−2 h−1 (from water) and 1.51 kg m−2 h−1 (from treated SDW), respectively. These values were both lower than the corresponding evaporation rate (calculated by mass decrease during evaporation), which was 2.63 kg m−2 h−1 and 2.14 kg m−2 h−1 for water and treated SDW, respectively. This was due to the gradually saturated internal humidity of the closed water collection system, which hinders the evaporation of water.30 Finally, as shown in Table 2, almost all of other photothermal evaporators fails to exhibit multiple properties such as degradation, salt resistance and antibacterial properties. The obtained optimal SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams shows good evaporation rate and photothermal conversion, antibacterial and salt resistance at the same time, showing strong application prospects.

The salt rejection performance is also critical because salt crystallization during the evaporation will occur on the evaporation surfaces, which can seriously affect evaporation efficiency. As shown in Fig. 6a–f, 1.0 g of additional solid NaCl was placed on the top surface to confirm the salt rejection of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams. After 30 min, the solid salt gradually dissolved in bulk water, which indicates the fast salt exchange between the foam pores and the bulk solution because the super-hydrophilic nanoneedle array structure and excellent water uptake capacity facilitate transfer of the salt solution back to bulk water. During the interfacial evaporation experiment of saline water, no salt crystallized on the upper surface of the foam within 24 hours (Fig. S12†), indicating that the salt ions on the surface can quickly diffuse to the bulk water to offset the salinity increase on the evaporation surfaces. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6g and h, S. aureus was selected as the model bacteria to investigate the anti-bacterial property of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams. Bacteria inhibition zones were clearly observed in comparison with the blank Petri dish. The bacteria inhibition zones for S. aureus were around the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams with a ring width of 0.9 cm, which indicated that the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams also exhibited an excellent antibacterial effect.

3.4 Distilled water and concentrated brine generation from the cascade system and possible mechanism
To prove the convenience and flexibility of practical application, a cascade system including two parts was designed for effective treatment of SDW based on the versatility of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams, as shown in Fig. 7. In system I (catalytic packed column), the appropriate foams can be filled for wastewater treatment and replaced easily. The foams in system I are focussed on the degradation of SDW, while the treated wastewater flows through the evaporator (system II) and returns to system I again for continuous degradation. These two systems can be easily cascaded or separated by adjusting the valves. When the foams need to be replaced or there is something wrong with the systems, these two systems can be easily repaired without affecting each other. In this work, 3 pieces of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams were used to fill in system I for the degradation of 250 mL of simulated SDW. After PMS activation and degradation, the decolorized solution was transformed into system II (which includes 4 pieces of foams) for solar evaporation. Finally, we could obtain two kinds of water, one was the concentrated brine from system I, and the other was evaporated freshwater from system II.
 Fig. 7  Cascade system for SDW treatment, including system I for degradation and system II for solar evaporation. 
Under the one-sun solar irradiation, the evaporation rate of decolorized SDW in system II was 2.14 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 8a), which was slightly decreased compared to that of water (2.63 kg m−2 h−1), probably because the small molecule degradation products can hinder the evaporation. After treatment for 40 h, we obtained 90 mL of freshwater and 160 mL of concentrated brine. As shown in Fig. 8b, the concentrated brine was basically decolorized, and evaporated freshwater was colorless when observed with the naked eye. Moreover, the water-quality indexes of freshwater and concentrated brine (after distillation and catalytic process), including color, suspended solids, CODCr, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, total chromium, and Co/Ni ion concentration were detected to evaluate the water quality. As shown in Fig. 8c and Table S2,† all these water-quality indexes of the distilled water satisfy the maximum residue limit of integrated wastewater discharge standard-Class I (GB8978-1996) of the People's Republic of China, indicating that high quality distilled water can be obtained after treatment with 3D SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams. Moreover, after the evaporation and catalytic process, the feedwater can be concentrated, the Na+ concentration of which was as high as 70500 mg L−1. Therefore, this cascade system can efficiently treat SDW, meanwhile the freshwater (can be discharged directly) and the concentrated brine can be collected. The Co and Ni ion concentrations of feedwater and distilled water after the distillation and catalytic process were also tested. As shown in Table S2,† the concentrations of Co and Ni ions were 9.2356 and 2.6817 mg L−1 in feedwater after the distillation and catalytic process, respectively, which may be because the water evaporation increases the ion concentration. In freshwater, the concentrations of Co and Ni ions were extremely low, 0.0067 and 0.0069 mg L−1, respectively, indicating the excellent removal of heavy metal ions. Meanwhile, Fig. S13a† shows the TOC removal of mixed dyes (after the catalytic process) and the SDW (after the distillation and catalytic process). In the foam/dye/PMS system, the TOC removal reached about 33.2% after catalysis for 60 min, indicating the good mineralization capacity. However, in the foam/SDW/PMS system, the TOC removal rate was extremely low, only about 6.6% after the distillation and catalytic process for 60 min. This was probably because the high concentrations of Cl− can inhibit the mineralization, which was consistent with other reports.39 On the other hand, the water evaporation also increased the concentration of organic products. Finally, we placed the cascade system II outdoors for 16 consecutive days to facilitate water evaporation driven by natural sunlight. As shown in Fig. 8d, the mean evaporation rates basically maintained at about 2.07 kg m−2 h−1. Meanwhile, the data for collected distilled water during outdoor solar evaporation were also recorded (Fig. S13† and Table 1). The average hourly yield of freshwater was 1.06 L m−2 h−1, which showed a lower value than the evaporation rate. This was probably owing to the lower solar intensity in the natural environment and the gradually saturated internal humidity of the closed system, which hindered the evaporation of water.30

(b) UV-vis absorption spectra of wastewater after degradation and evaporation. (c) The water-quality indexes of distilled water and feedwater (after distillation and catalytic process). (d) The 16-day evaporation rate of SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams in the outdoor (12:00 am–15:00 pm, Aug. 18–Sep. 2, 2020, in Jiangsu University). 
According to the above results, the possible mechanism of SDW treatment using multi-functional SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams was proposed. The abundant SO4˙− and ˙OH, which can be detected by the ESR test (Fig. S14†), were produced by reactions of metal valence changes, as listed in eqn (9)–(12). Owing to the existence of Co0 and Ni0, the regeneration of Co(II) and Ni(II) was accelerated through eqn (13)–(15). The SO4˙− and ˙OH can not only degrade dyes, but also show an antibacterial activity. Meanwhile, the black SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams have a rough needle-like array structure on the porous skeleton, which can efficiently utilize solar light. Therefore, these multi-functional photothermal-catalytic foams can achieve high light-to-steam generation efficiency and collect distilled water during the evaporation of SOW without residual concentrated wastewater. In addition, the good salt resistance and antibacterial properties provide these foams long-term activity. Co(II) + HSO5− → Co(III) + SO4˙− + OH−(9) Ni(II) + HSO5− → Ni(III) + SO4˙− + OH−(10) Co(III) + HSO5− → Co(II) + SO42− + ˙OH(11) Ni(III) + HSO5− → Ni(II) + SO42− + ˙OH(12) Co0 + Co(III) → Co(II)(13) Ni0 + Ni(III) → Ni(II)(14) SO4˙−/˙OH + dyes → intermediate products → small products(15)
4. Conclusion
In this work, a multi-functional photothermal catalytic foam is designed through in situ growth of a rough CoNi2S4 nanoneedle array on a porous PVDF foam framework (SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foam), which is used for treatment of saline dyeing wastewater. The SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams exhibit a high evaporation rate of 2.63 kg m−2 h−1 and an apparent energy conversion efficiency of 155.52% under one-sun illumination. Meanwhile, the CoNi2S4 nanoneedle array on the foam surface can efficiently activate PMS and degrade dyeing wastewater. The super-hydrophilic CoNi2S4 nanoneedle array and intrinsic nature of metallic sulfides also endow the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams with salt resistance and antimicrobial properties. Moreover, the lab-scale catalytic and evaporation cascade system proves the convenience of the practical application of the SCoNi–pDA/PVDF foams, which can collect distilled water and concentrated brine during long-time solar evaporation. Therefore, this work provides an inspiration for the future development of high-performance and multifunctional wastewater treatment materials and devices.
