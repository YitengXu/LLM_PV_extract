    First published on 18th January 2017AbstractPolyaniline is a conducting polymer with incredible promise, but it has had limited use due to poor reaction control and processability associated with conventional morphologies. Polyaniline nanofibers, on the other hand, have demonstrated, through manufacturing techniques discovered during the past decade, increased processability, higher surface area, and improved consistency and stability in aqueous dispersions, which are finally allowing for expanded commercial development of this promising polymer. This review explores some intriguing applications of polyaniline nanofibers, as well as the advantages and remaining challenges in developing better products using polyaniline in this new morphology.

1. Introduction
Inherently conducting polymers (ICPs), including polyanilines, polythiophenes and polypyrroles, are organic materials that have electrical properties similar to inorganic materials such as semiconductors and metals. ICPs have the potential to replace many of these materials due to lower manufacturing costs, lower density, better processability, higher mechanical flexibility and broader chemical functionalization capabilities. The light weight of the conducting polymers makes them attractive alternatives to dense metals and oxides for anti-static coatings and electromagnetic shielding. This is especially important in weight sensitive fields including aerospace and auto manufacturing. ICPs are malleable like most polymers and can be used as flexible, transparent electrodes for electrochromic devices and solar cells. Conducting polymers also have similar thermal expansion coefficients and mechanical properties to structural polymers, making the development of stable conductive plastic composite components a real possibility. Despite the many potential advantages of using an organic material over a metal, oxide or other inorganic compound, limitations in processing, stability and conductivity have prevented broad utilization of most conducting polymers. New methods for manufacturing nanoscale conducting polymers offer promise for broader commercial interest in conducting polymers, suggesting that academically driven developments could eventually have an impact in the marketplace.
Aniline is an inexpensive starting material that is readily manufactured from benzene, or extracted as a by-product from oil and coal tar refining. The primary oxidation product of aniline, polyaniline (originally called aniline black), has been around in various forms for over a century.1 Its high environmental stability, interesting redox chemistry and unique doping/dedoping properties have resulted in extensive academic studies of this material in recent decades.2 The starting materials to make polyaniline are the least expensive of all the inherently conducting polymers and polyaniline is the most thermally stable of the ICPs. Polyaniline also has relatively good conductivity leading to the supposition that it may be the best of the inherently conducting polymers.3 Unfortunately, due to its poor solution and melting processability, polyaniline has not yet been widely adopted for commercialization. Additional improvements are needed before polyaniline can find wide use in commercial products.
Much of the initial and continued academic interest in polyaniline lies in its unique redox states and doping mechanisms when compared to other conducting materials, especially other conjugated polymers. This concept is often stated, but seldom explained in any detail. Consider polythiophene, which possesses only 2 distinct oxidation states. “Doping” of polythiophene typically refers to the removal of some electrons from polythiophene (p-doping). “Dopants” or counter-anions are required to stabilize the positive charges generated by partial oxidation. Polypyrrole is analogous, having just two major oxidation states which correspond to doped (partially oxidized) or undoped (reduced) forms. In comparison, polyaniline has three major oxidation states known as leucoemeraldine (fully reduced), emeraldine (half-oxidized) and pernigraniline (fully oxidized) as shown in Fig. 1. In reality, the oxidation states are not really distinct, as essentially any degree of oxidation along the polyaniline chain can occur. Under controlled conditions this can give rise to the intermediate half oxidation states, protoemeraldine, which lies between leucoemeraldine and emeraldine, and nigraniline, which lies between emeraldine and pernigraniline. Structurally, the differences between the oxidation states is determined by the number of quinoid and benzenoid units in the polyaniline as labeled in Fig. 1. If polyaniline has only benzenoid rings in the undoped form, then the oxidation state is leucoemeraldine; if the polyaniline has one quinoid ring for every 8 total monomer units, the rest being benzenoid, then the structure is known as protoemeraldine; if there are two quinoids for every 8 monomer units, then the polyaniline is in its most stable oxidation state known as emeraldine; if there are three quinoid rings for every 8 monomer units, then the polymer is in the nigraniline oxidation state; and if the polyaniline is fully oxidized with every alternating ring being a quinoid (4 in total), then the oxidation state is called pernigraniline. The names of the different oxidation states are related to their different colors. Leucoemeraldine is nearly transparent in solution and white in solid form; emeraldine is green when doped, but changes to blue when it is undoped; and pernigraniline appears deep violet in solution but approaches black as a solid. These color changes help to explain interest in using polyaniline in electrochromic devices and displays.4–6
 Fig. 1  (a) Each of the five polyaniline oxidation states shown on top can be interconverted by either oxidation (removal of electrons) or reduction (addition of electrons) as indicated. (b) The undoped emeraldine base can be doped with an acid to yield the conductive emeraldine salt structure as shown at the bottom. 
The two most general methods used for synthesizing polyaniline are electrochemical and chemical oxidative polymerizations.8 Both conventional methods for producing conducting polymers result in materials that are difficult to process and generate large amounts of organic waste. New methods to manufacture conducting polymer nanostructures, particularly polyaniline nanofibers, provide a means to exploit the many advantageous properties of conducting polymers at a lower cost than conventional polymerization methods. These new polymerization techniques have led to higher surface area, solvent processability and morphological control.
Early synthetic methods to produce nanostructured polyaniline required templating agents or special processing techniques.9 The first report of a template-free method was made in 2003 with the introduction of the interfacial synthesis of polyaniline nanofibers.10 This method allows for the spontaneous reaction between an aniline monomer and an oxidant such as ammonium peroxydisulfate at the interface between two immiscible liquids. This procedure requires much less energy input than the conventional polyaniline oxidative polymerization, which has increasingly focused on low temperatures, slow addition of reactants and thorough mixing to improve yields and molecular weights. These methods have actually moved the reaction away from the intrinsic nanofibrillar morphology of polyaniline and resulted in inconsistent products from researcher to researcher.2,11 In order to use the conventional polyaniline product, it is filtered and dried, ground into a powder and then dispersed in one of the few solvents that can dissolve polyaniline: N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethylformamide (DMF), meta-cresol or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). In comparison, many of the oxidative polymerization methods for producing polyaniline nanofibers allow room temperature synthesis of nearly uniform nanofibrillar morphologies (Fig. 2, left). There have been several reviews on the synthesis of polyaniline nanofibers that describe this topic in some detail.2,9,12 There has also been continued improvement in the morphological control of conducting polymers, leading to the synthesis of nanofibers of polypyrroles, polythiophenes and polyaniline derivatives with similar opportunities to pure polyaniline, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.7,8

Polyaniline nanofibers readily disperse in water directly from aqueous synthesis (Fig. 2, right) and can be redispersed in alcohols, ketones and many other organic solvents with appropriate processing. The large surface area (>50 m2 g−1)13 improves reactivity in applications such as sensors and supercapacitors and has led to the uniform deposition of metal nanoparticles (e.g. gold silver and platinum) with <2 nm diameters, leading to applications in non-volatile memory devices and aqueous catalysis.14,15 Some of the additional commercially relevant properties of polyaniline and polyaniline nanofibers, as well as their applications, are described in subsequent sections.
2. Sensors
Gas vapor sensors
One of the most noticeable advantages of using nanostructured materials in sensors is a very fast response time, due to the high surface area and short diffusion lengths inherent in this morphology. These qualities can also lead to ultra-low detection limits. Polyaniline nanofiber gas sensors are easy to develop and test, and they can be used to detect a vast range of chemical vapor analytes. The native oxidation state of polyaniline, emeraldine, can be doped to the conductive emeraldine salt with protonic acids, or dedoped by a base to the insulating emeraldine form. This reversible behavior has been the driving force behind many of the acidic (e.g. HCl22) and basic (e.g. NH322) vapor sensors that have been developed because there are >10 orders of magnitude changes in conductivity (σ) between polyaniline in the emeraldine salt form (σ ≥ 1 S cm−1) to the emeraldine base form (σ ≤ 10−10 S cm−1). These conductivity changes are monitored through a gap electrode (Fig. 3, upper left) or an interdigitated electrode (Fig. 3, upper right) for more precise readings. These are simple devices to set-up and have been used in high school, undergraduate and graduate courses.16 Recent versions have also been used in high accuracy polyaniline nanofiber CMOS sensors.16,17 Additives can also be used to detect a specific reactant that causes the formation of an acid or a base that in turn dopes or dedopes the polyaniline, respectively.18 For example, the addition of CuCl2 has been used to detect the weak acid H2S since this reaction produces CuS and the by-product HCl. Analogous strategies have led to the detection of the lethal gases hydrazine,19 phosgene,20 and arsine.21 The change in conductivity resulting from chloroform swelling and methanol-induced polymer chain conformational changes has also led to the successful detection of those chemical vapors.22
 Fig. 3  A gap electrode configuration (top left) and an interdigitated electrode configuration (top right) are used to measure resistance changes. The lower image shows the configuration of a surface acoustic wave device. 
Hydrogen sensing has been a hot topic for polyaniline sensors during the past decade as it has been found that polyaniline nanofibers can detect hydrogen well below the dangerous explosion threshold of ∼3% hydrogen at room temperature. This detection occurs in the presence of oxygen, where many metal based hydrogen sensors cannot function. Polyaniline nanofiber hydrogen sensors have been demonstrated both with resistive23,24 and surface acoustic wave (SAW)25,26 transduction mechanisms. A surface acoustic wave device such as that depicted in the lower image in Fig. 3 uses two interdigitated transducers above a piezoelectric material. The input transducer on the left has an input electronic signal which creates a piezoelectric wave that propagates across the surface and is converted back to an electronic signal at the output interdigitated transducer. A SAW device detects changes in the electrical conductivity and/or mass changes in the active material which has been deposited on top of the interdigitated transducers. The change in the velocity of the acoustic waves is measured as a frequency change from the output transducer. In SAW sensor papers on the detection of hydrogen, the signal change has generally been attributed to an increase in conductivity of the polyaniline. This is interesting because it is not obvious that hydrogen actually dopes polyaniline. However, a mechanism in which protons are produced to account for the conductivity change has been suggested.23,25,27,28
Additional work has also shown that polyaniline nanofibers can be used to detect humidity,29 NO2,30,31 CO,32 aromatic organics33 and trinitrotoluene (TNT),34 and for many biological applications that will be discussed further in the next section.
Biological sensors
A wide range of polyaniline nanostructures and nanocomposites have been used in biological sensors for the detection of small molecules, proteins and DNA utilizing the well understood redox chemistry of polyaniline for signal amplification.35–37 The higher surface area and easier incorporation of biological materials are major advantages for the nanofiber form of polyaniline over conventional dense films.37–42 In the cases of dense films, reactions are limited to the top surface of the film and interactions between the conducting polymer or reactant and the analyte happen furthest from the underlying electrode. Additionally, the low surface area-to-volume ratio of dense films, relative to nanofibers, greatly limits the active surface area and thus limits sensitivity. Polyaniline nanofibers and nanocomposites are prime candidates for this application because they can be electroactive at neutral pH and covalently attached to various organic and inorganic materials in order to achieve synergistic effects.
Polyaniline has been used in sensitive DNA sensors because the redox activity of the polymer coincides with oligonucleotide binding events and thus provides signal amplification.43 While polyaniline is known for being more chemically and mechanically stable than most other conducting polymers, its implementation has been limited in pH sensitive biological sensing applications which typically require pH ≈ 7 because the acidic (pH < 4) environments often required for polymerization and electroactivity can be unsuitable for biomolecules. However, doping can be maintained at neutral pH levels by modifying the polyaniline molecule (e.g. by using self-doped polyaniline)44–46 or incorporating a dopant into the polymer matrix (e.g., polymerization or blending with a polyacid such as poly(styrenesulfonate)).47–50 As an example of the former technique, Lee et al. reported a self-doped poly(aniline-co-metanilic acid) copolymer to successfully detect urinary progesterone by combining a self-assembly process and molecular imprinting.51 Chang et al. used templated electropolymerization to fabricate a regular polyaniline nanotube array onto a graphite electrode that had a very low detection limit of 1.0 fM and demonstrated the ability to differentiate single base-pair mismatches at 37.59 fM.52 The authors assert that ultra-sensitivity was achieved by using oriented nanotubes (instead of a thin film or a layer of randomly oriented nanotubes), which exhibited high conductivity and fast hybridization kinetics. Hao et al. reported the synthesis of uniform polyaniline nanowires using peptide assembled fibers as templates. The resulting polyaniline nanowires were then utilized to construct a highly sensitive and selective sensor for hepatitis B virus genes with a low detection limit of 1 fM.37 Spain et al. bound single stranded DNA to gold nanoparticles attached to polyaniline nanofibers to detect Staphylococcus aureus, the main cause of mastitis a problematic disease in which cows produce sour milk.38
Other than the applications mentioned above, polyaniline nanofiber has been recently demonstrated to also be effective in stretchable electronic skin temperature sensing53 and pressure sensing.54
3. Printable electronics
The high dispersability of nanostructured polyaniline has made possible inks that can be painted or deposited by using a paintbrush, a fountain pen or an airbrush in either the doped (conducting) or dedoped (insulating) state. This can be used to create conducting, semiconducting or insulating regions. The ink can simply be replaced with a polyaniline nanofiber dispersion and applied normally. An airbrush does, however, have the added requirement that the nozzle must be large enough so that the nanofibers do not clog the spigot.
Polyaniline nanofiber ink can also be printed using an ink-jet printer to create sensors, circuits, conducting films and other structures. Inkjet printing is an ideal method for controlled deposition of a material in a pattern with small features. This technique for deposition has been considerably more difficult to utilize than the previously mentioned methods due to the small openings and problems in replacing the ink in modern inkjet printers. Often the print head will clog in the middle of printing, or if successful, become clogged after the print head dries. This problem has been overcome with the use of a Dimatix material printer (Fig. 4, top). Such a printer was used by Small et al. to deposit a polyaniline/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite (Fig. 4, bottom).5 Other research groups have also demonstrated the printing of polyaniline nanofibers and nanoparticles for applications such as sensors17,55–58 and electromagnetic interference shielding.59 The printing capability of polyaniline nanofibers and nanoparticles can also be combined with flash-welding to create printed sensors60 and mechanical actuators.92

One-dimensional nanostructures also possess a favorable percolation threshold relative to other shapes. This means that less material is needed for polyaniline nanofibers to form conducting pathways from one end of the material to the other. For example, much higher concentrations (at least 17% by volume) of amorphous or spherical particles (including carbon black, copper spheres or conventional polyaniline particles) are required as a minimum addition to create conductive pathways (i.e. to reach the percolation threshold) than with one-dimensional fibers (only 2.9% or less).61 This property of polyaniline nanofibers is beneficial for printed electronics applications because lower concentrations of polyaniline nanofibers contribute to better dispersability and less clogging of the print head.
4. Electro-optical applications
Electrochromics
Conducting polymers are excellent materials for electrochromic applications.4,62–64 Conducting polymers typically go through dramatic color changes when their oxidation state is varied. Applying a potential to a conducting polymer film causes these color changes to occur due to a change in the oxidation state of the conducting polymer. Color changing films have several potential applications including windows that let in light and heat in winter, but reflect radiant energy in summer, flexible displays, mirrors, and other devices. Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly using oppositely charged materials is a straight forward way to generate such devices.65,66 Because polyaniline nanofibers form stable dispersions in water, aqueous dispersions can be used to deposit the polyaniline layers. Doped, dedoped and self-doped (sulfonated) polyaniline nanofibers can be used to create layer-by-layer films. Because of their high solution stability at various pHs, self-doped nanofibers are often preferred.67–69 These sulfonated aniline nanofibers have been synthesized using a combination of aniline monomer and aniline-2-sulfonic acid in a known synthesis for the formation of aniline nanofiber derivatives.69 When the LBL films are made, each layer consists of a layer of polyaniline nanofibers and an appropriate polymeric counter-ion, such as poly(sodium styrene sulfonate), poly(allyl amine) or poly(acrylic acid). Doped and self-doped polyanilines are cationic with a positive surface charge, while dedoped polyaniline is anionic with a negative surface charge.
Polyaniline nanowires can also be deposited in situ onto supporting substrates such as PET via a dilute polymerization process as reported by Wang, et al.70 In order to observe the electrochromic response of the polyaniline film, different voltages were applied to the film. When the film was discharged to 0 V, it appeared green (the emeraldine oxidation state) (Fig. 5 top). When the film was charged to 1 V, it appeared blue (the pernigraniline oxidation state). These authors also developed a flexible energy storage smart window that utilizes both polyaniline's electrochromism function and its supercapacitive properties (which will be discussed further in Section 6). This energy storage smart window can be integrated with a solar cell to form a smart device system (Fig. 5, bottom) that can simultaneously harvest, store and use renewable energy. During the day-time when sunlight is abundant, solar energy is converted to electricity that can be stored electrochemically by charging the polyaniline smart window. Meanwhile, the color of the window darkens, blocking sunshine and heat. The generated power can then be used to provide power to the room. Zhao et al. fabricated a W18O49/polyaniline smart supercapacitor electrode with an energy level indication provided by the color change that occurs at different charging states.71 Yang and Chih also showed that molecularly assembled self-doped polyaniline interlayers can be employed in polymer light-emitting diodes.72

Photovoltaics
Nanostructured polyaniline has been explored for use in organic solar cells.73–83 The polyaniline is typically used as a hole-conducting material that is either blended with or coated onto an electron donor material. Nanofibrous polyaniline can form an interpenetrating network in a solar cell device which enhances the diffusion of the electrolyte and available donor/acceptor interfacial area for photogenerated excitons. The small domain size reduces the distance that the excitons need to travel before reaching an interface which increases the probability of exciton dissociation across the heterojunction. Additionally, such porous morphology allows for the efficient transport of charge carriers to their respective electrodes before recombination, increasing the device's current and voltage.73 Tang et al. fabricated a counter-electrode using double-layered polypyrrole nanoparticles and polyaniline nanofibers which gave significantly increased solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency due to abundant active sites and a high specific area for improved electrocatalytic activity and electrolyte loading.74 In other work, Tang et al. prepared a polyaniline nanofiber/platinum nanoparticle film as a counter-electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) device with a high conductivity, a high surface area, enhanced catalytic activity and a conversion efficiency of 7.69% which was higher than those made with either material by itself.75 Bahramian and Vashaee used polyaniline nanofibers as a counter-electrode and TiO2 as the photoanode to make a transparent DSSC device which exhibited 8.22% conversion efficiency under irradiation from both sides.76
In addition to photon absorption, other properties that affect the utility of polyaniline in solar cells are its conductivity, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, the bandgap, and stability. One study found that a common conductivity for polyaniline, 3.5 S cm−1, is ideal when compared to several different conductivity levels in applications as the hole-conducting layer in a dye sensitized solar cell.77 Yet as this study also pointed out, the particle aggregate size and film smoothness also play an important role in performance and repeatability.
The need for material control and uniformity is an indicator of the current lack of synthetic control over conducting polymers. The influence of different synthetic aspects such as temperature, mixing, the concentration of reagents and ratio of reagents has become increasingly well understood over the past decade, particularly for nanofiber synthesis. The fundamental properties of the material continue to make it attractive, and even more so with the increased material property control and dispersability. Polyaniline has been touted as one of the most stable conducting polymers in terms of the environment, temperature, UV and visible light.3 For polyaniline, the stability of the conductivity can be affected by dopant mobility or loss, but efforts to use bulky and low volatility dopants, polymeric dopants and covalently linked dopants, e.g. self-doping, can mitigate the risk of conductivity variability.78–81
A summary of several of the important polyaniline properties is presented in Table 1 shown for both nanostructured and conventional forms of polyaniline. Dopants, additives (particularly meta-cresol), chain length and polymer alignment have known effects on polyaniline's conductivity. Many of the high conductivity levels for polyaniline that have been reported are based on improved chain length and crystallinity. To date, there is limited analysis on the effects that various morphologies and synthetic methods have on these parameters.82 Morphology and the method of synthesis are also likely to have major impacts on conductivity, molecular orbitals and other properties. Further exploration in these areas may lead to more strategic developments in polyaniline and conducting polymer structures with specific and tunable properties. Side chains have also been explored with many other conducting polymers, particularly polythiophene,83 to improve functionality, solubility, conductivity, and other properties. While side chains typically reduce the conductivity of polyanilines, they may still be useful for tuning energy levels for materials needed in photovoltaic applications.

5. Actuators
Polyaniline and other conjugated polymers have been explored extensively for use in actuators. These polymers can change their structural conformation by the insertion of charged dopants and their solvating molecules (such as water) or with changes in the oxidation state to induce conformational changes as reported by Baker et al.91 Polyaniline nanofibers can even be used in a single material bimorph actuator by using flash welding to create an asymmetric membrane.92 These bimorph actuators move rapidly and to a greater extent than other known heterogeneous or single material bending actuators. This is attributed to the extensive freedom of expansion of the nanofiber mat. The stimulus in this actuator is chemical doping and dedoping of the films in acid and base, respectively. This device may have applications in a sensor or valve that opens with exposure to acid or in nano- or micro-actuators. Gao et al. incorporated polyvinyl alcohol into a polyaniline nanofiber actuator that displayed a tunable degree of actuation and a response rate with better recoverability compared to a pure polyaniline nanofiber actuator.93
Electrophoretic deposition has been used to form microstructures of polyaniline nanofibers as described by Shedd et al.94 An electrode array charged a substrate to attract the polyaniline nanofibers to precise locations. Adjacent electrodes were given an opposite charge to prevent deposition at undesired sites. These microstructures can then be flash-welded to create a monolithic material. The article proposes its use in sensors, but if the flash-welded micro-films can be dislodged from the substrate they could also be used as micro-actuators.
There are several other actuator structures that have been explored with polyaniline and polyaniline nanostructures. To determine their feasibility in a high-strain all-polymer electro-acoustic actuator, Zhang et al. explored the current density limitations of polyaniline. They found that polyaniline (in the conventional form) doped with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) can withstand a current density as high as 1200 A cm−2.95 The polyaniline activated electrostrictive copolymer was as effective as gold from −50 °C to 120 °C and from 1 Hz to 1 MHz frequencies. More recent experiments have led to the development of high breakdown field dielectric elastomer actuators using encapsulated conductive polyaniline nanoparticles as the high dielectric constant filler.96 A dielectric elastomer is a smart material that shows considerable strain and/or stress in response to an applied electric field. In order to enhance the actuation strain, the dielectric constant of the elastomer should be increased by adding conducting fillers without compromising the elasticity of the polymer matrix.97 Because polyaniline is a polymer it has more flexibility and better mechanical properties compared to metal particle fillers when used in conjunction with highly expansive polymer actuator materials. Wang et al. introduced polyaniline nanorods into a silicon rubber nanodielectric elastomer actuator to improve its dielectric constant and electromechanical properties and enhance electro-induced strain. Kim et al. fabricated an actuator using a polyaniline nanorod/Nafion blend with electrical pathways showing improved actuating ability compared to that made with Nafion alone.98 Uh et al. developed an electrolyte-free polyaniline microfiber actuator that undergoes a flapping wing motion in the presence of a magnetic field. Such an actuator has great potential in biomimetic artificial muscles, robotics and sensors.99 Liu et al. constructed an air working ionic actuator by sandwiching a H2SO4–PVA gel electrolyte between two pieces of a reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline nanocomposite electrode. Actuating takes place when an electric field causes ion migration that induces volume differences between the cathode and anode. Such nanocomposite electrodes display excellent electrochemical stability over thousands of cycles due to the synergistic effects of polyaniline nanowires and graphene oxide sheets.100 Future work should lead to more structural bimorph and high-strain actuators, as well as concepts to be developed for future use such as nanoactuators with controllable motions and functions for building nanomachines.101
6. Supercapacitors
Supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices that have long cycle life (>100000 cycles), high power density (>10000 W kg−1) and can be safely charged and discharged within seconds. Supercapacitors typically consist of positive and negative electrodes separated by an insulating separator with an ionic electrolyte. Two types of capacitance, double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance, are typically utilized. Double-layer capacitance results from the electrostatic charge stored at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. Pseudocapacitance is associated with a reversible redox or Faradaic charge transfer.102 Polyaniline has demonstrated high capacitance values due to its multiple redox states, which create a large total surface charge potential when sweeping from one oxidation state to another. Polyaniline nanofibers have demonstrated higher capacitance values than their bulk counterparts103 due to the high surface area available for charging. Because of their high charge storage, low weight and good environmental stability, nanostructured polyaniline has the potential for a very high capacitance per unit of mass that is competitive with some considerably more expensive materials such as ruthenium oxide.118
The theoretical specific capacitance for nanofibrous polyaniline is estimated to be around 1200 F g−1 with the contribution of both pseudocapacitance and electrical double-layer capacitance.104,105 Currently, the reported values for the specific capacitance of pure polyaniline nanofiber electrodes in a H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte are within 400–900 F g−1 using a three-electrode configuration.106–108 This gap shows that the part of polyaniline effective in contributing to capacitance is limited. According to Fig. 6, the diffusion of dopants (counter-anions) determines the amount of insertion/expulsion of counter-anions that can take place from the polyaniline surface. Since the light gray core part is essentially inaccessible at the timescale used in the charge/discharge process, it provides no contribution to the capacitance.104 Therefore, it is critical to use nanostructured polyaniline because this provides greater electroactive material with shorter migration pathways for ions and mitigates mechanical deformation.109

Carbon materials are often incorporated into the polyaniline nanofibers in order to further improve their conductivity and mechanical stability. Polyaniline suffers from a large volumetric shrinking and expansion during the doping/dedoping process due to the repeated insertion/expulsion of electrolyte ions.110 Carbon materials such as activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene show high conductivity, good cycle stability, but relatively low capacitance limited by their microstructures. Therefore, hybrid electrode materials based on nanostructured polyaniline and carbon materials can provide a synergetic combination of outstanding conductivity/stability from the carbon materials and high pseudo-capacitance from the polyaniline. Extensive research has been done on such hybrid supercapacitors. For example, Zhang et al. prepared a chemically modified graphene/polyaniline nanofiber composite by in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of graphene oxide followed by hydrazine reduction and the reprotonation of polyaniline. Polyaniline fibers adsorbed onto the graphene sheets formed a uniform nanocomposite with a specific capacitance of 480 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1.111 Cong et al. fabricated a freestanding flexible polyaniline nanorod/graphene paper via electropolymerization of polyaniline nanorods on the graphene paper. Such a nanocomposite possesses excellent conductivity with an equivalent series resistance of only 4.1 Ω. It also exhibits great performance as a supercapacitor with a specific capacitance of 763 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 discharge current and 82% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.112 Kulkarni et al. used a 3D porous graphene framework on which polyaniline nanofibers were grown chemically. The 3D graphene framework was prepared via CVD growth of graphene on Ni foam followed by Ni etching. This electrode achieved a specific capacitance as high as 1024 F g−1 in 1.0 M H2SO4 at 10 mV s−1 scan rate. The conductive porous graphene framework offered a high surface area for the effective utilization of polyaniline and improved the charge transport and storage. Such an electrode had only 10 Ω resistance and demonstrated good cycle stability with 86.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.113 A similar concept has been applied by Wang et al. to produce a 3D graphene/polyaniline nanofiber composite electrode using a hydrothermal method, achieving 356 F g−1 even at a current density of 20 A g−1.114 Pedrós et al. reported a 3D hierarchical porous composite supercapacitor electrode made of a polyaniline nanofiber sponge filled graphene foam (Fig. 7). The graphene foam ensures efficient electronic transport within the scaffold with the electrolyte rapidly diffusing into the high-surface-area polyaniline nanofibers. Such synergy led to rather high gravimetric capacitance (1474 F g−1) and volumetric capacitance (86 F cm−3) at a current density of 0.47 A g−1. The capacitance retention was 83% after 15000 cycles.115 Hyder et al. used a LBL assembly of positively charged polyaniline nanofibers and carboxylic acid functionalized CNTs to obtain a thin film electrode with an interpenetrating network structure, creating well-developed nanopores that led to a very high volumetric capacitance (238 F cm−3).116

Other materials, such as metal oxides, have also been combined with polyaniline nanofibers in order to obtain high-performance supercapacitors. Jiang et al. coated the surface of polyaniline nanofibers with ultrafine loosened MnO2 floccules. The high surface area of the MnO2 floccules provided enhanced electroactive sites and the polyaniline nanofiber backbone served as the conductive pathways. The combination of the two pseudocapacitive materials gave a specific capacitance of 383 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with an enhanced rate capability and cycling stability.117 Xia et al. grew a thin layer of RuO2 on polyaniline nanofibers using atomic layer deposition (ALD) in order to stabilize the polyaniline and improve its energy density. A good specific capacitance of 710 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 was achieved with an impressive power density of 42.2 kW kg−1 and an energy density of 10 Wh kg−1. This electrode was able to maintain 88% of its capacitance after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 20 A g−1. This again demonstrated the excellent buffering effects of metal oxides on polyaniline nanofibers.118
An ionic liquid electrolyte was employed to further increase the energy storage capability of polyaniline pseudocapacitors by Chen et al.119 Full-cell pseudocapacitors using polyaniline nanotubes as the electrode material and EMIMBF4 (1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate) ionic liquid as the electrolyte demonstrated a remarkable energy density of 84 Wh kg(cell)−1 and a power density of 182 kW kg(cell)−1, about a 5 times improvement compared to cells using acidic aqueous electrolytes. This ionic liquid has a very high voltage window (up to 6 V) with a low vapor pressure and non-flammability. It is promising in producing supercapacitors with high energy density as the energy stored in a supercapacitor is proportional to the voltage squared (E = 0.5 CV2). The hollow nanotube morphology of polyaniline was also advantageous as the electrolytes can access some inner portions of the nanotubes as well, further increasing the capacitance.
7. Protective applications
Electrostatic dissipation
Antistatic and electrostatic dissipative (ESD) materials are used to prevent electrostatic discharge, which can be dangerous and/or costly in data storage devices and internal components of computers, as well as moving machine arms and airplanes. Electrostatic build-up is typically caused by triboelectric charging. This occurs when an insulating material is brought into contact with another material and then separated. The resulting charge can dissipate when electrons are brought into contact with a conducting material. An antistatic material allows slow discharge of electrons that can build up on an insulating surface, preventing their rapid discharge to a more conducting surface that can damage electronic components and even lead to sparking or an explosion. A specific range of conductivity is required so that the electrical charge does not move so quickly as to create a discharge event. The electronic industries association (EIA) standard 541 points out that the optimal surface conductivity for ESD should be in the range of 10−6–10−10 S cm−1.120
Polyaniline has been demonstrated to be useful in several antistatic applications due to its suitable conductivity, low cost, good transparency and minimal mechanical change in a matrix. The conductivity for polyaniline is typically between 1 S cm−1 and 10−10 S cm−1 and can be easily tuned by dedoping, addition of metals/metal oxide nanoparticles/insulating polymeric fillers, or applying thinner films to reach values that are ideal for antistatic applications. Dhawan et al.121 and Lv et al.122 coated polyester fabric and polyimide fiber, respectively, with polyaniline as a lightweight conductive material for antistatic textiles. Anand et al.120 developed a polyaniline/ZnO nanoparticle impregnated cotton fabric with a conductivity range of 10−3–10−9 S cm−1 depending on the loading concentration. Static decay meter measurements showed that the static decay time of the fabric film was in the range of 0.5–3.4 s from 5000 V to 500 V, exhibiting great potential as an effective antistatic material.
Flexibility is another key benefit of a polyaniline nanofiber network for this type of application as polyaniline maintains its conductivity after bending and/or creasing. Pramanik et al.123 reported a hyperbranched poly(ester amide)/polyaniline nanofiber nanocomposite as an antistatic material with good rheological behavior, mechanical strength and thermal stability. Nanofibrous polyaniline is promising in such applications because its high aspect ratio requires less material to generate a conductive pathway throughout the entire coating to reach the percolation threshold. A low percolation threshold of 2.2% was reported by Wang et al. for polyaniline nanofibers in a polymethylmethacrylate composite.124
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding
The advantageous conducting properties of polyaniline nanofibers that make them useful in antistatics are also beneficial in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding applications. Electrical devices, radio and television signals, magnetic devices (e.g. NMRs and MRIs) and even nuclear blasts can generate electromagnetic interference that can disrupt telecommunication signals, and electronic device performance. Shielding from EMI interference is generally accomplished by wrapping a device, wire, etc. with a conductive material, such as the braided shielding used in electrical cables. Typical EMI shields have conductivities in the range of 1 to 1000 S cm−1.125 The demand for lighter weight and lower cost materials that are effective for EMI shielding is rapidly increasing as electronics in handheld devices, vehicles, homes and workplaces are becoming more advanced and more compact. There are also important security concerns as communication via cellphones is more heavily relied upon, which can be impacted by electromagnetic and radiofrequency pollution. Inherently conducting polymers offer distinct advantages over the more commonly used metal/carbon imbedded polymers due to their corrosion resistance, light-weight, low-cost and variable frequency absorption ranges.126 With metallic fillers, the loading levels necessary to achieve conductivities sufficient for effective shielding can compromise the mechanical stability, add weight, and make the materials susceptible to corrosion. Additionally, it is difficult to achieve a uniform dispersion of metal particles.126 Carbon fillers such as carbon black are chemically stable, but loadings must be very high, leading to mechanical issues and sloughing, which can cause contamination and shorting of electrical components. High-aspect-ratio carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can provide high conductivity at relatively low loading levels.127 However, they are far more expensive to produce than polyaniline nanofibers, which can be solution synthesized from an inexpensive aniline monomer with a low environmental impact.
Shielding effectiveness (SE) is measured as the ratio of the electrical field strength before and after attenuation by a given material. The shielding mechanism is highly dependent on filler properties, loading level, and frequency.128 In general, 40 dB and 80 dB SEs are required for commercial and military applications, respectively. Polyaniline has been tested for EMI shielding in numerous research studies and its EMI shielding performance was found to be comparable to that of CNT composites.131 Polyaniline absorbs electromagnetic radiation through the effective interaction of polarons with incident electromagnetic radiation. Niu et al. reported polyaniline nanofiber–polyacrylate composite coatings with an SE of 38 to 63 dB over a frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 GHz.129 Liu et al. dispersed polyaniline nanoparticles in an epoxy matrix to form a coating with an SE of 30 to 60 dB in the range of 100 to 1000 MHz.130 Joseph et al. formulated a 1 mm polyaniline nanofiber/graphite composite absorbing ink with an SE of 87 dB in the frequency range of 8.2–18 GHz. It is worth noting that ink made with polyaniline nanofibers alone with the same thickness had an SE of 74 dB in the same range. The 2.3% graphite composite resulted in improvement in conductivity and acts as a stable underlying conductive network. The optimized nanofibrillar morphology of polyaniline contributes to its good conductivity and shielding capability. The nanosized fibers can cause multiple reflections of electromagnetic waves within the matrix that eventually lead to more dissipation of electromagnetic energy due to longer propagation pathways.132 Polyaniline nanofibers have also been combined with gold nanoparticles133 and NiZn-ferrite nanoparticles134 for such applications. For medical and military applications, it is desirable to protect the human body from EMI by incorporating conductive fillers into clothing. Fabric made with a polyaniline coating showed a lower shielding efficiency, 35 dB, but these materials were not made with a variable loading rate of polyaniline.121,126,129 Also of note is the finding that EMI shielding using ICP fillers blocks a significant portion of the incident field by an absorptive mechanism, making them especially attractive for stealth applications.126
8. Inorganic nanocomposite applications
Various combinations of metal compounds and polyaniline nanofibers have been used for many applications including supercapacitors,135 sensors,18 catalysts15 and non-volatile memory devices.136 Many of these composites take advantage of the inherent redox properties of polyaniline to spontaneously reduce some metal cations, especially noble metals, to form uniform metal nanoparticles. The morphology of the polyaniline nanofibers was demonstrated to be capable of template growth of uniform (<2 nm) nanoparticles of gold that adhere to the nanofibers following exposure to chloroauric acid (HAuCl4).14 This was accomplished through the use of low reaction temperatures and reagent concentrations. These nanostructures were surprising because previous studies136 showed that conventional forms of polyaniline and chloroauric acid, when dissolved and cast as a dense sheet, resulted in irregular micron scale gold particles.
These metal nanoparticles demonstrated the ability to store charge with relatively low turn on voltages in a cross-bar memory device.14 In these devices after a minimum voltage is applied between the two electrodes, charge is stored in the metal nanoparticles. This charge is stabilized by a counter-ion in the conducting polymer backbone. Prior and subsequent work has used other organic molecules for charge stabilization. The advantage of the polyaniline nanofiber metal nanoparticle system is that the metal nanoparticles do not have to be produced in a separate step. The polyaniline nanofibers also appear to facilitate uniform growth and prevent Ostwald ripening of the particles. The small and uniform deposition of gold nanoparticles and the charge stabilization provided by the nitrogens on the conducting polymer backbone allowed for stable turn on (i.e. “1”, high conductivity) and turn off (i.e. “0”, low conductivity) with only a small applied voltage. The simple process for making these composite materials combined with the stability and the large number of fast read–write–erase cycles made the system interesting for non-volatile applications. Once the composite in a memory device is dried and thermoset in a cross-linked poly (vinyl alcohol) matrix, the device is quite stable and can be turned on/off months later. However, if the gold polyaniline nanofiber composite is left in solution for a period of months, agglomeration of the metal nanoparticles is observed. This may occur to some degree with the metal nanoparticles in the device, particularly under a continuous applied voltage. Alkane thiol coating of the metal nanoparticles after formation on the polyaniline nanofibers may increase the material’s stability, and the long-term device stability and cyclability.
The reaction between polyaniline nanofibers and metal cations can be controlled by altering the temperature, reaction time and stabilizers used in the reaction, in order to yield gold nanoparticles of different sizes and morphologies on the polyaniline nanofibers.137,138Fig. 8 shows various sizes of gold particles grown on polyaniline nanofibers through in situ autoreduction of chloroauric acid. Gold nanoparticles with sizes of <1, 2 and 6 nm were achieved by cooling reactants to different temperatures prior to reaction, during reaction and during dialysis purification. Larger particle sizes were generated using higher chloroauric acid concentrations. Gold sheets were obtained by carrying out the reaction under reflux and purifying at room temperature. Memory devices fabricated using a 2 nm gold nanoparticle/polyaniline nanofiber composite demonstrated the best performance with a low turn-on voltage which required less power consumption and large on/off ratios which provided good stability with hundreds of write–read–erase cycles.

In addition to gold, as discussed above, platinum,139 silver140 and palladium nanoparticles141 have also been deposited on polyaniline nanofibers with exposure to the appropriate metal salt. Palladium nanoparticles grown on polyaniline nanofibers have been shown to be effective in catalysis, for example, high yield aqueous Suzuki coupling reactions between aryl halides and boronic acids have been demonstrated.15 Evidence has been found for a semi-heterogeneous catalytic mechanism.142
9. Other applications
Corrosion protection
Aniline, polyaniline and their derivatives including aniline black have all been considered for use in corrosion protection.143–146 Several polyaniline suppliers have sold the material as an undercoating for corrosion protection to be applied directly to the surface of the metal under a top-coat. Polyaniline, along with other conducting polymers, is redox active allowing it to reduce metal cations as mentioned in the previous section. Unlike alternative anti-corrosion materials such as chromates, phosphates and molybdates, polyaniline is more environmentally friendly and exhibits reversible electrochemical properties by controlled charge transfer in air.
Previous research using the conventional organic cast film form of polyaniline has suggested anodic protection of metal surfaces.143 Testing is usually conducted by placing a scratch in the surface of the coating film in a heated, humid and/or salty environment and observing the extent of corrosion over time. These tests have shown that conventional polyaniline (coated electrochemically or via an organic solvent) and nanofibrillar polyaniline144 are effective additives to protect metals from corrosion. The high surface area of polyaniline nanofibers is especially beneficial in large-scale coating applications for corrosion protection due to the outstanding processability of polyaniline nanofibers which allows direct incorporation with other coating materials for a single step corrosion protection layer.145,146
Biocomposites
Starting in the early 2000s conductive and particularly nanostructured conductive materials were identified as excellent materials for tissue engineering.147–150 Tissue engineering is a rapidly growing field, and one of the most critical portions of this work is the development of conducting materials to interface with biological tissue for the stimulation of neurons and muscles. Conducting polymers are especially attractive as they allow variable conductivity via simple chemical and structural modification. Polyaniline is essentially inert in in vivo studies using mice without causing inflammation, indicating its potential for use in bioengineering applications like muscle scaffolding or neuron stimulation. Nanostructured polyaniline is also an excellent candidate for tissue growth as reported by Bidez et al.147 Another study showed that polyaniline nanofibers can be blended with collagen and used for culturing porcine skeletal muscle cells.148 Wang et al. designed core–shell scaffolds using aligned polyaniline and silk fibroin nanofibers for mimicking the structure of native skeletal muscle.149 Zhang et al. reported on the synergistic effects of electrical stimulation and nerve growth factor on neuron growth using a polyaniline nanofiber composite mesh incorporated with nerve growth factor.150
Filtration membranes
Polyaniline and its derivatives have been used to fabricate water filtration membranes with enhanced hydrophilicity, permeability, chlorine resistance and anti-fouling properties.151,152 Polyaniline nanofibers have also been blended into existing membrane materials as pore forming agents and hydrophilic modifiers.153 Polyaniline nanofibers and CNTs were incorporated into a polysulfone membrane matrix by Liao et al.154 By adjusting the nanofiber content and applying flash welding, the structure, morphology, hydrophilicity, conductivity and permeability of the membrane can be controlled. Membranes fabricated using an N-substituted derivative of polyaniline were found by Huang et al.152 to be chlorine tolerant and anti-fouling. These materials are now being developed by the membrane company Water Planet, Inc.
Summary and future prospects
As the best studied and potentially most useful conducting polymer, polyaniline has had a wide portfolio of applications owing to its facile synthesis, intrinsic conductivity and unique doping/dedoping chemistry. The development of one-dimensional nanostructured polyaniline with enhanced processability and exceptional functionality offers great promise in fields such as sensors, electrochromics, supercapacitors and antistatic materials which have all been described in this review along with many other applications. The nanofiber morphology can be easily achieved through electrochemical polymerization, interfacial polymerization or a rapid mixing method. The latter method is readily scalable for practical use. Devices fabricated using nanostructured polyanilines generally have better performance compared to the ones made using their conventional counterparts. For example, polyaniline nanofiber sensors show much faster response and higher sensitivity, while supercapacitors made with polyaniline nanofibers exhibit higher specific capacitance and better cycle stability. Polyaniline nanofibers readily disperse in water at an appropriate pH, making them easy to be incorporated into matrices for electrostatic dissipative and electromagnetic interference shielding. No matter how many applications are discussed in a review article such as this, there are always more ideas that can be achieved with the development of new materials, especially when the material can be manufactured cost-effectively at a large scale. The rapid development in the synthesis, morphology control and novel properties of one-dimensional polyaniline will continue to spur further commercial interest in this promising material.
