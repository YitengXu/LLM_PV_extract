    , Accepted 29th March 2001First published on 8th May 2001AbstractThe ruthenium mono(dcbpy) (dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine) complexes, trans(Br)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] and trans(I)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2], have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Both compounds show strong photochemical activity. Under illumination in acetonitrile the colour of the dye solutions changes and infrared spectra indicate an irreversible change, with two CO stretching bands disappearing from the spectra with concomitant appearance of a new CO stretching band, an indication of a loss of a CO ligand. Changes in the proton NMR spectra suggest that the release of the CO ligand is followed by reorganization of the halogen ligands and attachment of one solvent molecule leading to formation of the cis(X)-Ru(dcbpy)(CO)(CH3CN)X2] (X = Br, I) isomer. In the visible
spectra, a new absorption band appears under illumination at 510 nm allowing observation of the kinetics of the reaction. The quantum yields of the reactions are 0.68 and 0.34 for the bromine and iodine complexes, respectively. The trans(I)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] compound shows a temperature dependent luminescence spectrum in the temperature range 77 to 116 K, with an activation energy of 850 cm−1. We assign this dependence to a thermal population of a secondary triplet size, slightly above the emitting state, that is capable of initiating the photochemical reaction and/or a non-radiative relaxation to the ground state. The redox properties of the starting materials and the photoreaction products were studied with cyclic voltammetry and the results are discussed with reference to the reaction mechanisms.
Introduction
Organometallic ruthenium compounds are of great interest because of their redox potentials and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) reactions.1–3 Several papers on the conversion of solar energy have reported ruthenium polypyridine complexes acting as potential charge transfer dyes in a sensitized photovoltaic cell.4 A typical cell is based on [Ru(dcbpy)2(SCN)2] (dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine) sensitizer doped on a TiO2 surface.4
In addition to electron and energy transfer, MLCT excitation of ruthenium polypyridine complexes can lead to other photophysical processes such as splitting or formation of a metal–ligand or a metal–metal bond. MLCT-induced photochemical substitution, isomerization, radical formation, oxidative addition and reactions of coordinated ligands are also known.5–7
Mechanisms of photodissociation reactions of several transition metal complexes have been studied.5–10 In a simplified picture the properties of the MLCT excited state can be described either as properties of the oxidized metal or reduced ligand compared to the ground state. Photosubstitution reactions of the first-row transition metal complexes may occur directly from the vertically excited Franck–Condon (FC) state.6,11 Irradiation into the MLCT absorption band of carbonyl-diimine complexes of these metals induces dissociation of a CO ligand, which is not directly involved in the MLCT transition. Farrell and coworkers11 have reported that in Cr(CO)4(bpy) the photoproduct Cr(CO)3S(bpy) (S = solvent) was formed directly from the FC excited state. However, the reaction directly from the Franck–Condon
MLCT excited state does not represent the most typical MLCT photochemistry.6 Especially in complexes containing heavier transition metals, initial excitation may be followed by intersystem crossing to triplet states. Bernhard et al.12 proposed that the reactive state in the photosubstitution of a carbonyl ligand with a solvent in [Re(LL)(CO)4]+ is the result of coupling a weakly photoactive 3MLCT state and a low-lying ligand field (LF) state.
It is also possible that the 3MLCT state, instead of decaying to the ground state, thermally populates a higher-lying state from where a M–CO bond dissociates rapidly.6 This kind of delayed dissociation mechanism is typical for transition metal complexes of the second or third row. It has also been proposed that in [Ru(bpy)]32+ the ligand photosubstitution reaction proceeds ia a thermally activated radiationless transition from a luminescent 3MLCT level to a distorted metal-centred 3MC level.8,13–15 From the 3MC level, cleavage of a ruthenium ligand bond can proceed with simultaneous competition between radiationless decay to the ground state.
Photochemical properties of ruthenium mono(bipyridine) compounds have been applied to the photochemical reduction of CO216 and in light-induced ligand exchange reac tions.17–19 Photoirradiation of [Ru(bpy)(CO)2Cl2],17
[Ru(dmbpy)(CO)2Cl2]18 and [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Cl2]19 in acetonitrile has been found to result in replacement of carbonyl and chlorine ligands by CH3CN. It has been proposed that in these molecules the ligand substitution reaction occurs in three successive steps, where the first and the second steps are dissociation of a carbonyl ligand, and the final step is substitution of a chlorine atom by an acetonitrile molecule.17–19
In the present paper, light-induced ligand substitution reactions and the kinetics of the reactions of two new halogen-containing ruthenium mono(dcbpy) compounds, trans(Br)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] and trans(I)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2], in acetonitrile were followed by spectroscopic methods and cyclic voltammetry. The temperature dependence of the luminescence of trans(I)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] was followed in alcohol solution to study the states involved and possible activated processes. The aim of the study was to clarify the mechanisms that control the excited photosubstitution reaction where a CO ligand is replaced by a solvent molecule.

X-Ray crystallography
X-Ray diffraction data was collected with a Nonius KappaCCD diffractometer using Mo-Kα radiation (λ
= 0.71073 Å). Denzo and Scalepack22a programs were used for cell refinements and data reduction. Structures were solved by the Patterson method using DIRDIF-99 22b or SHELXS97 22c programs with the WinGX 22d graphical user interface. The structure refinements were carried out with SHELXL97.22d A multi-scan absorption correction, based on equivalent reflections (XPERP in SHELXTL v5.1),22e was applied to the data of structure 1. In both structure 1 and structure 2, the aromatic hydrogens were constrained to ride on their parent atom. In 1
all other hydrogens and in 2 water hydrogens were located from the difference Fourier map but not refined. Carboxylic acid hydrogens in 2 were refined isotropically. Crystallographic data is summarized in Table 2 and selected bond lengths and angles in Table 3. The crystal structure of 2 and the numbering scheme of the molecules are shown in Fig. 1. Two internet files of rotating molecules are available as ESI.† Crystallographic data in CIF or other electronic formats are available as ESI (CCDC reference numbers 156911 and 156912).†

Photochemical studies
Samples were illuminated by using the 458 nm line from a Coherent Innova 400 argon ion laser or white light from a tungsten lamp. The progress of the reaction was monitored by time-resolved IR and visible absorption spectroscopy. 1H NMR and steady-state UV–Vis spectra were recorded before and after exposure. Low temperature fluorescence spectra were measured before illumination for both dyes. A photon flux of 5.0 × 1016 photons cm−2 s−1 and dye concentration of 1.2 × 10−4 mol L−1 were used in measuring the visible spectra and 4.0 × 1016 photons cm−2 s−1 and concentration of 8.0 × 10−4 mol L−1 in recording the IR spectra. For kinetic measurements both dyes were dissolved in acetonitrile (HPLC grade, Ratherburn Chemicals Limited). The concentrations of the dyes were 1.0 ×
10−3 mol L−1 in deuterated acetonitrile for the 1H NMR measurements and 1.0 × 10−4 mol L−1 in ethanol (99.5 m%, Primalco) for fluorescence measurements.
Time-resolved changes in the visible absorption spectra were measured with a spectrometer consisting of an Oriel Instruments tungsten lamp (Oriel Model 66182) equipped with heat-absorbing filters (water cell and Schott Glass Type KG 3 filter), sample cell (10 mm plastic cell), imaging spectrograph (Acton Research Corporation, SpectraPro 150) and CCD detector (Princeton Instruments Inc., Model TEA/CCD-1024-E/1) with recording software WinspecTM. The spectra were recorded in the region 400 to 800 nm. Samples were continuously illuminated with blue light from the argon ion laser at 458 nm to drive the photochemical reactions. A Perkin Elmer Lambda 5 UV–Vis spectrophotometer was used to measure steady-state absorption spectra of the samples.

1H NMR experiments were run with a Bruker Avance DRX500 FT NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm diameter broad band probe working at 500.133 MHz for proton at temperature 300 K, the spectral width being 6000 Hz. FIDs were apodisized by an exponential window function with digital resolution of 0.1 Hz. The proton spectra were measured before and after 300 min illumination with white light from a tungsten lamp. The proton signal for the partly deuterated solvent, (CD2HCN) = 3.31 ppm, was used as an internal reference.
Fluorescence experiments were carried out with excitation from a tungsten lamp, and spectra were recorded by using an imaging spectrograph and a CCD detector. Samples were cooled in a liquid nitrogen cryostat (Oxford Instruments). Suitable excitation wavelengths were selected from the white light source (Oriel Model 66182) by interference filters (band width 10 nm) of the Ar-ion laser line 458 nm was used.
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies were performed under argon at room temperature in a three-electrode cell using an Autolab PGSTAT20 potentiostat–galvanostat. The cell was kept in the dark before measurements. In all measurements a platinum disk (Metrohm, area 1.28 cm2) was the working electrode and a glassy carbon (GC) disk (Metrohm, area 0.28 cm2) served as the counter electrode. The electrodes were polished with alumina and rinsed with distilled water and acetone before use. Potentials were referred to an Ag/Ag+ (0.01 mol L−1) electrode in CH3CN. Under the experimental conditions, the Fc+/Fc (ferricinium ion/ferrocene) couple potential was 0.01 V. In all experiments the potential scan rate was 100 mV s−1 and the sample concentrations were typically 2 mmol L−1. Acetonitrile (p.a., Merck) and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) (electrochemical
grade, Fluka) for electrochemical measurements were used as received.
Results
Photoreactions
The photoinduced ligand exchange reactions of trans(Br)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] and trans(I)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] were studied by IR spectroscopy. Prior to photolysis, the IR spectrum showed two CO stretching bands for each complex: the symmetrical stretch at 2006 cm−1 and the antisymmetrical stretch at 2063 cm−1 for [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] and the symmetrical stretch at 2002 cm−1 and antisymmetrical stretch at 2058 cm−1 for [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2]. Immediately after illumination (either with 458 nm radiation from an argon ion laser or from a tungsten lamp), the solution turned from light yellow to red and the two CO stretching peaks disappeared simultaneously, while a new CO stretching band appeared at about 1970 cm−1 (Fig. 2).
An isosbestic point was observed between the 2002 cm−1 band and the new band at 1970 cm−1, a strong indication that only two species give rise to these changes, one species transforming to another. This is taken as evidence that in both compounds one of the CO ligands is dissociated in the photoreaction, leaving the reaction product with only one CO ligand.
 Fig. 2  
Changes in the IR transmission of ν(CO) bands of [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] during photolysis. Arrows indicate the directions of transmission changes as a function of time. Spectra were measured every 10 s for the first 2 min of illumination. The last spectrum was measured after 24 min of illumination.
 
Infrared spectroscopy was also used to study the kinetics of the ligand exchange reaction. The sample was illuminated with an Ar-ion laser line at 458 nm for a fixed time and the spectrum recorded immediately after illumination. An advantage of this method is that, disappearance of the reactant ia detachment of a single carbonyl ligand and appearance of the photoproduct can be selectively monitored (Fig. 2). The decay kinetics of the absorption of the reactant molecules nicely matches the rise kinetics of the product formation. The fast and major part of the reaction is over in about 1 min under the experimental conditions used. However, if the illumination was interrupted during the fast initial step of the reaction a recovery of the reactant signals was observed. This particular phenomenon is under more detailed study.

1H NMR measurements were carried out to identify the photoproducts. The 1H NMR spectra of the unexposed [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] and [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] solutions showed three clear resonances, consistent with the symmetrical arrangement of bipyridine ligand protons. The 1H NMR spectral assignments of the spin system were based on characteristic couplings between the aromatic protons. Protons at 3 and 3′ positions showed an unresolved singlet, while the 5 and 5′ protons and the 6 and 6′ protons showed a doublet in the spectrum (Table 1). In both cases, after irradiation six aromatic proton resonances were observed. Changes were most dramatic for the signals arising from the 6 and 6′ protons. The large splitting (∽1 ppm) of the 6 and 6′ proton signals suggests the presence of different ligands in the trans position
relative to the bpy nitrogens.

Visible absorption measurements. 
Absorption spectra of trans(X)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2X2] (X = Br, I) were recorded in acetonitrile before and after illumination (1 h). Absorption wavelengths and molar absorption coefficients of the compounds are given in Table 4. The time evolutions of the absorption spectra under continuous illumination were also studied. Absorbances at excitation wavelength 458 nm for the iodide and bromide samples were 0.076 and 0.026 respectively. The major change in the visible absorption spectrum for both compounds was the appearance of a new absorption band around 510 nm (Fig. 3). The formation of the new absorption band was completed in about 1 min showing non-exponential growth. This probably occurs because strong absorption of the photoproduct at the excitation wavelength will distort the true kinetics of the reaction.
For the bromine compound additional but small absorption changes were at 590 and 500 nm in the absorption spectrum at a longer timescale. For the iodide compound no such changes were detected.

 Fig. 3  
(a) Growth of absorption of the photoproduct under continuous illumination of a [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] in acetonitrile solution. The time interval between measurements was 6 s. Discontinuity in the spectra around 458 nm is due to the excitation laser light. (b) Rise of absorption as a function of time for the bromide complex at 520 nm under illumination.
 
By comparing the number of photo-excited molecules with the number of product molecules observed we estimated quantum efficiencies of the ligand substitution per one excitation at room temperature to be 0.34 for the iodide and 0.68 for the bromide compound.
 Luminescence spectra of [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2X2] (X = Br, I) were recorded at 77 K and the spectra are shown in Fig. 4. Only weak luminescence was observed for the bromine compound, while the iodine analogue gave strong luminescence at 77 K. No luminescence was observed for either compound at room temperature. The luminescence from the iodine sample appeared as Gaussian-shaped contours devoid of structure and considerably red-shifted. The apparent Stokes shifts ΔE(Abs-Em) were of the order of 7000 cm−1. The temperature dependence of the emission of [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] was also studied. It was observed that the intensity of the luminescence decreases rapidly with increasing temperature from 77 to 116 K. For [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] an exponential fit of the luminescence intensity s.

Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the redox properties of the [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2X2] (X = Br, I) complexes. The relevant electrochemical data are summarized in Table 5. During the scan to positive potentials, both complexes revealed metal- based Ru(II)/Ru(III) oxidations. According to the electronegativity series it was expected that Ru(II)/Ru(III) redox potentials would increase in the order I<Br<Cl. It can be seen from Table 5 that this assumption is valid and as expected, complex [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Cl2] has the highest oxidation potential.19 In addition to ruthenium-based oxidation, there are several redox reactions at positive potentials. It can be seen in Fig. 5 (A and B) that a reversible peak system is not
formed until after the first cycle in the potential range 0–
+ 2.0 V. These peaks are related to the oxidative and reductive behavior of liberated halogens. It has been reported17 that [Ru(bpy)(CO)2Cl2] loses Cl and CO ligands during oxidative scan and the liberated chloride ion gives an anodic peak (Epa
= 0.74 V) and on the reverse scan a cathodic peak (Epc
= 0.45 V).23 Both complexes [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] and [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] exhibited clear wave systems with potentials following the electrochemical redox order for the halogens: E1/2
= 0.33 V for [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] and E1/2
= 0.62 V for [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2].
These observations were additionally confirmed with CV studies of free I2/CH3CN solution (2 mmol L−1). At positive potentials (Fig. 5C), only the reversible peak system corresponding to the redox behavior of free iodine was observed.

The electrochemical reactions at negative potentials are mainly assigned as ligand-based reductions. As can be seen in Table 5, there are three different sets of electrochemical reduction. It has been shown19,24 that the carboxyl groups in Ru(dcbpy) complexes can be reduced and the reactions of lib erated hydrogen are then seen as irreversible cathodic and anodic peaks at potentials Epc
− 1.4 to − 1.6 V and Epa
− 0.9 V, respectively. The first set of reductions (Epc
=
− 1.38 V–
− 1.43 V) is thus due to the deprotonation of –COOH groups in dcbpy ligands. The second (Epc
=
− 1.62 V–
− 1.68 V) and third (Epc
=
− 2.11 V–
− 2.15 V) set arises from
the reduction of bipyridine rings. These potentials are typical of ruthenium coordinated bipyridine. Coordination lowers the reduction potentials considerably relative to the two reductions observed for the free 2,2′-bpy ligand.25
Discussion
Both [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] and [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] turned out to be photoactive compounds. Under continuous illumination a new visible absorption band of the photoproduct in the region from 500 to 520 nm is formed. Infrared spectra of the compounds in the carbonyl stretching region show disappearance of the two CO stretching bands of the reactant with simultaneous formation of the single red-shifted CO stretching band of the product. The 1H NMR spectra in the aromatic region of the reactants show chemical shifts and couplings typical of symmetrical (Cs) arrangement of the ligands indicated by the X-ray crystal structure (Table 2). The proton spectra of the photoproducts show exceptional 6, 6′ signal splitting suggesting non-symmetrical arrangement of the ligands. Irradiation of [Ru(L)(CO)2Cl2]
(L = bpy, dmbpy or dcbpy) with visible light in acetonitrile has been reported to produce [Ru(L)(CO)(CH3CN)Cl2] as the primary product.17–19 In these structures the CO and Cl ligands occupy the equatorial positions opposite to the bipyridyl ligand, while CH3CN and Cl occupy the axial positions. The chlorine photoproduct shows very similar 6, 6′ proton splitting to the bromine and iodine complexes in the present work. By analogy, it is then proposed that in the complexes of the present study the photoinduced solvent substitution also takes place at an axial position.
After photoirradiation of [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] the voltammogram showed a new reversible wave system (E1/2
= 0.89 V, ΔEp
= 92 mV), while the initial Ru(II)/Ru(III) peak system disappeared. This change in Ru(II)/Ru(III) oxidation potential took place within a few minutes. It is known that the formation of [Ru(L)(CO)(CH3CN)Cl2] during the photoirradiation of [Ru(II)(L)(CO)2Cl2] shifts the reversible Ru(II)/Ru(III) wave system to more negative potentials (E1/2
= 0.74 V, 0.78 and 0.88 V for L = bpy, dmbpy and dcbpy, respectively).18,19 The observed E1/2 value corresponds well with the earlier results of photolysis of [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Cl2]
 in CH3CN.19 Furthermore, the UV–Vis data for [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] (Table 4) correlate with the earlier measured values (λmax
= 372 and 584 nm before and after photolysis) for the chloro complex.19 The redox potential for the Ru(II)/Ru(III) couple in [Ru(L)(CO)(CH3CN)Br2] was calculated by using Lever's ligand electrochemical parameters26 and the calculated value (Ecalc.
= 0.93 V) correlated well with the observed one (Eobs.
= 0.89 V). When it comes to [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2], photoirradiation resulted in a disappearance of the irreversible Ru(II)/Ru(III) oxidation peak and only the reversible peak
system of liberated iodine could be found. At the same time, the colour of the solution turned from yellow to red, indicating a light-induced ligand substitution reaction. Thus, the IR, NMR and absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry data strongly suggest the formation of [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)(CH3CN)Br2] as primary photolysis product. In the case of [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] the detailed structure of the initial photolysis product is less clear. However, after longer irradiation, similarities with the [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)(CH3CN)Br2] complex can be found from spectroscopic data.
It has been suggested that in d6 metal–carbonyl complexes with other substituents (Cl, α-diimine) the CT states are so low in energy that excitation does not provide enough energy for photodissociation of CO ligands if the atomic configuration remains fixed.27 Dissociation of the equatorial CO ligand may take place if relaxation of the axial Cl ligand to the equatorial position occurs. Experimentally this kind of substitution mechanism has been reported for [Ru(I)(Me)(CO)2(α-diimine)] where excitation leads to release of CO, a shift of the methyl ligand to the equatorial position and attachment of a solvent molecule to the open axial site.28 Probably the same kind of relaxation mechanism is involved also in the present ligand exchange reaction. Hence, we suggest that under illumination first a CO ligand at one of the equatorial sites is detached,
followed by occupation of the open site by a halogen ligand from the axial position leaving room for axial attachment of the solvent molecule.
The reaction kinetics, monitored at the red side of the lowest energy absorption band of the photoproduct, was sensitive to excitation power and initial concentration of the reactant molecule. The fast formation of the new absorption band in the visible region is assigned to photoinduced addition of one acetonitrile solvent molecule to the complex. Estimated quantum yields suggest that the fast initial step of the ligand exchange reaction is faster for the bromine than for the iodine compound. There was evidence as well of smaller, long timescale changes in the absorption spectra, probably related to substitution of the second or further ligands or formation of by-products. Indications of such reactions were also observed in the 1H NMR spectra.
Presently we are not able to identify exactly the lowest emitting excited state of the compounds. According to the literature, structureless Gaussian-shaped luminescence that is considerably red shifted is from the 3MC state.29,30 Typically, such luminescence from the 3MC state can only be seen in rigid matrices at low temperatures and is not detected in fluid solution at room temperature. On the contrary, emission from a 3MLCT state like in [Ru(bpy)3]+ is typically highly structured at low temperature and visible also at room temperature.29 However, Niuwenhuis et al. have observed broad structureless emission at 77 K from CT states for series of [Ru(X)(R)(CO)2(α-diimine)].31 The authors also reported that changing the halide from Cl to Br and to I changes the
nature of the emitting state from 3MLCT to 3XLCT, correspondingly. Both emission lifetime and quantum yield depend on the nature of the emissive state and decrease in the order XLCT>MLCT. Therefore it could be possible that also in our case the lowest excited state of the iodine complex has more 3XLCT character than the bromine complex and hence nonradiative deactivation is slower and ΔE(Abs-Em) smaller for the iodine complex.
In [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] emission is strongly red shifted and shows a structureless contour the intensity of which decreases rapidly with increasing temperature in the range 77 to 120 K. This kind of temperature dependence indicates the existence of a non-radiative state, probably a reactive state above the luminescent state. For [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] the activation energy obtained was 850 cm−1. Possibly this barrier is even lower for the bromine analogue and one should go below 77 K to see the temperature dependent emission from this compound. On the other hand it may also be possible that the fluorescence intensities are dependent on the nature of the emitting states of the complexes. Luminescence of the photoproduct of the iodine complex drops dramatically in the ligand exchange reaction and the emission wavelength is shifted further towards the red, from 652 to 778 nm.
The temperature dependent luminescence measurements suggest that in our case the lowest excited state is probably not the reactive state. Preliminary temperature dependent measurements on the substitution reaction indicate that the ligand exchange reaction is only slightly temperature dependent, the reaction slows down measurably only close to the freezing point of the solvent. Because of the low activation energy calculated from the luminescence measurements, it is possible that even at very low temperatures the emissive excited state is thermally converted to the reacting state. Under these conditions, however, the system may not be capable of undergoing the ligand exchange reaction because of the rigidity of the solvent surroundings.
Conclusions
Light-induced ligand exchange reactions in acetonitrile solution were observed for halogen containing complexes trans(Br)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2] and trans(I)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2]. According to the infrared spectra, during illumination one of the carbonyl groups is detached and the ligand-binding symmetry is distorted. Splitting of the aromatic proton signals at 6 and 6′ locations in the 1H NMR spectra as a consequence of irradiation reveals the rearrangement of the ligands from trans(X)-[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2X2] to cis(X)-
[Ru(dcbpy)(CO)(CH3CN)X2] (X = Br, I) isomer. The fast formation of the new absorption band in the visible spectrum under illumination is further evidence for the photoinduced reaction. The increased quantum yield for the photoreaction of [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2]
compared to [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] indicates a faster reaction for the bromine complex. Furthermore, the cyclic voltammetry data showed more straightforward and faster photoinduced redox reactions for [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2Br2], whereas for the corresponding iodo complex similar redox behavior was observed after longer irradiation times. The observed decay and formation kinetics showed non-exponential behavior. The temperature dependence of the luminescence of [Ru(dcbpy)(CO)2I2] suggests that the reactive state lies slightly above the emitting state.
