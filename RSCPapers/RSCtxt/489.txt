    , Accepted 11th March 2014First published on 12th March 2014AbstractArtificial photosynthesis aims at efficient water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen, by exploiting solar light. As a priority requirement, this process entails the integration of suitable multi-electron catalysts with light absorbing units, where charge separation is generated in order to drive the catalytic routines. The final goal could be the transposition of such an asset into a photoelectrocatalytic cell, where the two half-reactions, proton reduction to hydrogen and water oxidation to oxygen, take place at two appropriately engineered photoelectrodes. We herein report a covalent approach to anchor a Co(II) water oxidation catalyst to a Ru(II) polypyridine photosensitizer unit; photophysical characterisation and the catalytic activity of such a dyad in a light activated cycle are reported, and implications for the development of regenerative systems are discussed.
Introduction
The main goal of artificial photosynthesis is the use of solar light for water splitting, to yield hydrogen as a clean and renewable fuel (eqn (1)).1 A general operating scheme foresees a light-induced charge separation centre that drives the redox events involved in the overall process: reduction of protons to hydrogen and oxidation of water to oxygen (eqn (1)–(3)).2 2H2O + hν → 2H2 + O2(1) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2(2) 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−(3)
In particular, water oxidation to oxygen is a 4e−/4H+ process where a new O–O bond is formed, and is therefore recognized as a transformation with complex mechanistic aspects that suffer from high kinetic barriers.3 In recent years, formidable efforts have been dedicated to the development of new catalysts for water oxidation (water oxidation catalysts, WOC), with particular emphasis on light activated conditions.4 These are usually performed in a homogeneous model system, combining the catalyst with a suitable photosensitizer (i.e. Ru(bpy)32+, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) and a sacrificial electron acceptor (i.e. sodium persulfate, Na2S2O8);5 the ultimate goal is however the development of regenerative systems, where the catalyst and the photosensitizer are anchored onto a semiconductor surface, in the photoanode compartment of a regenerative photoelectrocatalytic cell.6 In such an operating scheme, the electron transfer rate from the WOC to the photosensitizer has a marked impact on the performance and stability of the overall system,6c,7 in particular to prevent side reactions leading to photosensitizer self-oxidation and degradation, or to prevent unproductive charge recombination.6c,7 Therefore, in order to boost such an electron transfer rate, several approaches have been proposed to enhance WOC–photosensitizer interactions, including covalent linkages or supramolecular assemblies.8
In this paper, we present the synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical characterisation of a novel WOC–photosensitizer dyad 1, based on a compartmental Co(II)–Ru(II) covalent assembly (Fig. 1). The catalytic moiety is based on a single site Co(II)–salophen unit, which we have recently reported as capable of catalysing water oxidation in a light activated cycle.9 Its covalent linkage to a RuII(bpy)2 photosensitizer moiety is obtained by a suitable functionalization of a phenanthroline type ligand. Combined electrochemical and photophysical studies reveal that photoinduced, intramolecular redox events involving the two metal centres occur within a very short timescale, confirming efficient electronic interactions between the two units. Moreover, a preliminary study dealing with the activity of 1 in light driven water oxidation is presented, and perspectives towards the application of dyads of such type to regenerative photoanodes are discussed.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and electrochemical characterisation
Synthesis of the compartmental dyad 1 (Fig. 2) was accomplished adapting a literature procedure for a ruthenium–copper analog reported by Pellegrin et al.10
 Fig. 2  Synthesis of 1. (i) H2SO4/HNO3, NaBr, 100 °C, yield 35%; (ii) NH2OH·HCl, BaCO3 in refluxing ethanol, yield 57%; (iii) 10% Pd/C, N2H4 in refluxing ethanol, yield 42%; (iv) triethylorthoformate in refluxing ethanol, yield 42%; (v) triethylorthoformate, AgNO3 in refluxing ethanol, yield 66%; (vi) methanol, room temperature, yield 91%. 
The key intermediate is the heteroditopic ligand N,N′-bis(salicylidene)-5,6-(1,10-phenanthroline)diamine, 2, prepared by a four-step synthesis starting from 1,10-phenanthroline. These steps include: (i) oxidation of 1,10-phenanthroline to 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione under reflux of H2SO4/HNO3,11a (ii) reaction with hydroxylamine to yield the 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dioxime,11b (iii) its reduction to 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-diamine with hydrazine,11b and (iv) condensation of 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-diamine with two equivalents of salicylaldehyde.10 The identity of all intermediates was confirmed by comparison of ESI-MS, infrared and 1H-NMR characterisation with literature (see Fig. S1 in ESI† for 1H-NMR of 2). Metallation of the phenanthroline unit with Ru(II) was then achieved by reaction of 2 with cis-Ru(bpy)2Cl2, under refluxing methanol in the presence of triethylorthoformate;10 in the resulting complex, 3, isolated in 66% yield, the Ru(II) centre is coordinated to the heteroditopic ligand 2, while maintaining the two bpy ligands in its coordination sphere, as confirmed by elemental analysis and by 1H-NMR characterisation (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The final step is metallation of the salophen cavity with Co(II), readily achieved under room temperature conditions by addition of cobalt acetate to a methanol solution of 3, precipitating product 1 in 91% yield by addition of diethyl ether.
Electrochemical characterisation of dyad 1 and of the cobalt free analog 3 was initially performed in acetonitrile solution (Fig. 3 and Table 1).

During cathodic scan, 3 shows three reversible reduction waves at E1/2 = −1.34, −1.54 and −1.89 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 3 and Table 1). These are consistent with subsequent one-electron reduction of the phenanthroline based and bpy ligands.10,12 The first two reduction events are observed also for 1, at almost unaffected potentials; moreover, an irreversible process is observed at −0.94 V, and ascribed to the reduction of Co(II) to Co(I) coordinated by a salophen ligand.13
During anodic scan, two irreversible processes are observed for 3 at 0.70 and 1.23 V, compatible with oxidation of the salophen moiety, likely involving the phenol groups.10 A third, reversible event at E1/2 = 1.33 V is observed, and attributed to the RuIII/II couple. In the case of 1, only the reversible wave due to the RuIII/II couple is observed at E1/2 = 1.32 V, since the hydroxo groups of the salophen moiety are involved in the coordination of the cobalt centre and therefore protected from oxidation.§
Photophysical characterisation in acetonitrile
Absorption spectra of 1 and 3 in acetonitrile are reported in Fig. 4, compared to Ru(bpy)32+. In both cases, a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band centered at 460 nm is observed, typical of ruthenium polypyridine sensitizers. In the case of 1, a second broad absorption between 350 and 450 nm superimposes which may be attributed to cobalt based transitions.9,14 Finally, ligand-centered (LC) transitions in the 250–350 nm region can also be discerned ascribable to the 2,2′-bipyridine (maximum at 288 nm) and to the phenanthroline-based (maxima at 334 and 348 nm) units.10,15
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of molecular dyads 1, 3, and model Ru(bpy)32+ in acetonitrile. 
Upon excitation at 466 nm, the emission of both 1 and 3 in acetonitrile solution is almost completely quenched (>95% with respect to a solution of Ru(bpy)32+ with the same optical density). Analysis of the transient absorption spectra obtained by ultrafast spectroscopy (UFS) allows us to identify the electron transfer events responsible for the abatement of the emission (Fig. 5 and 6). In the case of 3 (Fig. 5), the initial transient spectrum (1 ps time delay), featuring the MLCT bleach and a broad absorption at a longer wavelength with a relative maximum at 530 nm, can be reasonably assigned to the triplet excited state, promptly formed after 400 nm excitation by ultrafast intersystem crossing from the singlet excited state. The subsequent spectral changes are clearly biphasic. In the time window between 1 and 244 ps (Fig. 5a) the MLCT bleach practically disappears, while the positive absorption increases in intensity with a shift of the maximum from 530 nm to 510 nm; the time constant for this first process is ca. 45 ps (Fig. S3 in ESI†). Then, this new transient starts decaying to the baseline in the time interval between 244 and 1890 ps (Fig. 5b). The time resolution of the experiment (2000 ps) does not allow any reliable detection of the kinetic parameter for this second process. However, the same transient spectrum can be revealed also by laser flash photolysis with a time profile following that of the excitation source (6–8 ns, Fig. S4 of ESI†). This means that the transient produced in the first hundred ps, as observed by UFS, decays to the ground state with a time constant of about 6–8 ns.
 Fig. 5  Difference absorption spectra at (a) 1–244 ps and (b) 244–1890 ps time delays obtained by UFS (400 nm excitation) on 3 in acetonitrile. 
 Fig. 6  Difference absorption spectra at (a) 1–78 ps and (b) 78–1425 ps time delays obtained by UFS (400 nm excitation) of 1 in acetonitrile. 
According to the electrochemical data, only reductive quenching of the MLCT excited state is thermodynamically allowed (with a driving force of ca. −0.2 eV, without electrostatic correction applied), with reduction of the bipyridyl ligand of the complex and oxidation of the aromatic hydroxo groups of the salophen moiety. As a matter of fact, formation of a positive absorption with a maximum at 510 nm is a fingerprint16 of the reduction of ruthenium polypyridine complexes.¶ This proton-coupled process is likely assisted by intramolecular hydrogen bonding within the Schiff base moiety of the ligand.17
When the cobalt centre is inserted within the salophen cavity, the photophysical processes change sensitively. Similarly to 3, the prompt transient spectrum obtained by UFS corresponds to the triplet MLCT excited state. In this case (Fig. 6a), however, the positive absorption at 530 nm decays rapidly with a time constant of 15 ps (Fig. S5, ESI†). In this process (isosbestic point at 485 nm and ΔOD = −0.005), a long-lived transient is formed, characterized by little positive absorption and substantial bleach left at 470 nm. This transient decays (Fig. 6b) with the recovery of the 470 nm bleach in a much longer time scale (estimated lifetime ca. 6 ns, Fig. S5, ESI†). Overall, these spectral changes are compatible|| with fast oxidative quenching of the MLCT excited state by the cobalt centre, followed by slow charge recombination.
Photophysical characterisation in aqueous buffer and light driven water oxidation
The behaviour of 1 and 3 has been examined also in aqueous solutions, as the target solvent for artificial photosynthesis. The photophysical properties of 1 and 3 change dramatically in aqueous phosphate buffer at pH 7, where partial recovery of the typical emission of Ru(II) polypyridine species is observed for both compounds (Fig. 7a). Moreover, the static nature of the quenching, as observed from the time-resolved decay of the MLCT emission (Fig. 7b), strongly suggests that the aqueous environment introduces new chemical equilibria affecting the photoinduced dynamics. In the case of 3, partial protonation of the salophenic ligand may take place in phosphate buffer at pH 7, thus preventing the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism of the reductive quenching.**
 Fig. 7  (a) Photoluminescence spectra (excitation at 400 nm, optically matched solutions) and (b) emission intensity at 610 nm observed by laser flash photolysis (excitation at 355 nm, optically matched solutions) in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) of 1, 3, and Ru(bpy)32+. 
Concerning compound 1, the lack of quenching by the Co centre seems to be hardly attributable to a simple solvent effect. A possible explanation could be the presence of more complex equilibria in the aqueous environment, possibly involving (i) coordination of axial ligands18 making oxidative quenching thermodynamically unfavourable or, more likely, (ii) partial leaching of cobalt. This could be relevant to the evaluation of light activated water oxidation.
Light activated water oxidation catalytic tests with 1 were conducted in solution, in the presence of 5 mM sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8) as the sacrificial electron acceptor, and of 1 mM Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer.8m
In Fig. 8, kinetics of O2 evolution with 20 and 40 μM of 1 are reported (blue and red traces, respectively). In these two runs, 3.50 and 4.55 μmol of O2 are produced after 3 hours; these correspond to a total turnover number per cobalt centre of 11.7 and 7.6, respectively. The maximum O2 production rates (measured in the linear range of the kinetic profile, between 5 and 10 minutes after irradiation) are 0.80 and 0.96 × 10−4 μmol(O2) s−1, corresponding to turnover frequencies of 2.67 and 1.61 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. The quantum yield (Φ) of the process for the reaction where [1] = 40 μM, defined as the ratio between the rate of O2 produced and the photon flux absorbed by the system,3c is 0.037. Since the maximum value of the quantum yield in sacrificial cycles using sodium persulfate is 0.5, this value corresponds to overall 7.4% quantum efficiency of the system.3c As expected, the cobalt free system 3 is inactive under the same reaction conditions (black trace in Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Kinetics of O2 evolution from 15 mL of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 with 5 mM Na2S2O8, 1 mM Ru(bpy)32+ illumination by 1 LED emitting at 450 nm (photon flux 2.63 × 10−8 einstein per s). Blue trace: 20 μM 1; red trace: 40 μM 1; light blue trace: 20 μM Co(NO3)2; pink trace: 40 μM Co(NO3)2; black trace: 50 μM 3. 
In order to check if the catalytic activity could be partially ascribed to Co(II) ions leaching from 1 (hypothesis (ii) presented above),19 oxygen evolution tests were run also with Co(NO3)2 as the catalyst, at the same metal concentrations (light blue and pink traces in Fig. 8).
Oxygen evolution occurs in the presence of either 1 or Co(II) ions as a catalyst, with similar kinetic profiles in the concentration range 20–40 μM (Fig. 8). Therefore, the presence of dissociation equilibria generating Co(II) aquo-ions from 1 (eqn (4)) cannot be ruled out by kinetic evidence.†† This equilibria hypothesis can justify the partial emission recovery observed when 1 is dissolved in aqueous solution as compared to the quenched system in acetonitrile. The emission properties can thus be ascribed to ligand 3, generated from 1 upon partial leaching of the Co(II) centre (Fig. 7, see the above discussion). Therefore, under the conditions explored, oxygen evolving catalysis is likely due to both 1 and aquo Co(II) ions in the 20:80 ratio as possibly estimated by the emission intensity shown in Fig. 7:‡‡ (4)
In photocatalytic cycles of this kind,6b,7e–h,9 the primary process is the oxidative quenching of the sensitizer MLCT excited state by S2O82−, with generation of a Ru(III) species, followed by hole transfer to the catalyst. Flash photolysis experiments have been performed to probe the photoinduced generation of Ru(III) by excitation of 1 or 3 (50 μM, λexc = 355 nm), with 5 mM Na2S2O8 in phosphate buffer (pH 7). With ligand 3, after a few nanoseconds (time resolution given by the laser pulse) very little amounts of Ru(III) are detected, ca. 5% of what is expected from comparative experiments carried out with Ru(bpy)32+ (Fig. S7a and c, ESI†). This result is very likely ascribable to fast (sub-ns)§§ intramolecular hole scavenging from Ru(III) by the phenolic moieties. The fact that a similar, very small amount of Ru(III) is obtained with dyad 1 (Fig. S7b, ESI†) is fully consistent with the hypothesis of extensive (ca. 80%) dissociation of 1 to 3.
Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented a novel covalent dyad 1, based on a compartmental Co(II)–Ru(II) assembly, where a cobalt(II)–salophen unit (water oxidation catalytic moiety) is anchored to a Ru(II) unit with bipyridine and phenanthroline type ligands (photosensitizer moiety). The photophysical characterisation of 1 in acetonitrile solution reveals that light absorption by the photosensitizer moiety produces a triplet MLCT excited state, with a lifetime of 15 ps; this very short value is attributed to oxidative quenching of the photosensitizer moiety by the Co(II) ion. In principle, this type of fast quenching of the sensitizer might be detrimental to the use of 1 in photocatalytic water oxidation systems, in particular in homogeneous systems taking advantage of persulfate as a sacrificial electron acceptor, where oxidative quenching of the photosensitizer excited state occurs via a bimolecular route, in a typical timescale of tens of ns.3a,4c,6b,7e–h,9 It should be remarked, however, that in regenerative systems where the sensitizer–catalyst dyad is supported onto a surface of a semiconductor,6d,e electron injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor is usually very fast, as it can occur in hundreds of fs.20 Therefore, a sensitizer–catalyst dyad displaying intramolecular quenching could still be considered for such applications.
A second aspect that has to be considered is the stability of the dyad in the aqueous environment. The photophysical characterisation of 1 in phosphate buffer, and its catalytic activity within a Ru(bpy)32+/S2O82− photocatalytic system, suggest the instability of 1, likely due to partial leaching of the cobalt centre. It is worth mentioning that, in this respect, the behaviour of 1 is markedly different from that observed for the cobalt(II) complex with the salophen ligand (N,N′-bis(salicylaldehyde)-1,2-phenylenediamine), which was found to be stable in aqueous buffer.9 The reasons for this difference are not obvious. They might be related to the cationic character of 1, and to the enhanced electron-withdrawing character of the salophen moiety in 1, with destabilisation of the coordination of the cobalt ion, especially in its low oxidation state. More importantly, the steric hindrance between the protons in 4 and 4′ positions of the phenanthroline moiety and the protons of the imine groups is expected to cause a slight distortion of the salophenic ligand,10a thereby determining instability towards cobalt coordination. In any case, strategies to reinforce the stability towards the aqueous environment should be considered, in order to propose salophen-based dyads for the design of efficient and durable photoanodes.
Experimental part

1,10-Phenanthroline-5,6-dione was synthesized following the procedure described by Yamada et al.11a A 250 mL round bottom flask containing 4 g (22.2 mmol) of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate and 24 g (201.6 mmol) of potassium bromide was cooled to 0 °C using an ice bath. Concentrated sulphuric acid (80 mL) was added in small portions followed by concentrated nitric acid (40 mL). The resulting solution was heated for 2 h at 100 °C, cooled to room temperature and poured into 500 mL of water. The solution was neutralized using a 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phases were collected and the solvent was evaporated to yield 1.5 g of a yellow solid (35% yield). Characterisation was in agreement with literature data.11a

To this mixture, a solution of 7.5 mL of hydrazine monohydrate and 30 mL of ethanol was added over a period of one hour and the resulting mixture refluxed for 12 hours. The mixture was filtered hot through a bed of Celite and the pad was washed several times with 20 mL each of boiling ethanol. The filtrate was dried and the residue was triturated with 45 mL of water and left at 4 °C overnight.

UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV/Vis/NIR Jasco V-570. Emission spectra were recorded on a Horiba-Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorimeter, equipped with a Hamamatsu R3896 tube.

Ultrafast spectroscopy (UFS). 
Femtosecond time-resolved experiments were performed using a pump–probe setup based on the Spectra-Physics Hurricane Ti:sapphire laser source and the Ultrafast Systems Helios spectrometer.21 The 400 nm pump pulses were generated using a Spectra Physics SHG. Probe pulses were obtained by continuum generation on a sapphire plate (useful spectral range: 450–800 nm). Effective time resolution was ca. 300 fs, temporal chirp over the white-light 450–750 nm range was ca. 200 fs, the temporal window of the optical delay stage was 0–2000 ps. The time-resolved spectral data were analyzed using the Ultrafast Systems Surface Explorer Pro software.


Nanosecond laser flash photolysis. 
Nanosecond transient measurements were performed using a custom laser spectrometer comprised of a Continuum Surelite II Nd:YAG laser (FWHM 6–8 ns) with frequency doubled, (532 nm, 330 mJ) or tripled, (355 nm, 160 mJ) option, an Applied Photophysics xenon light source including a mod. 720 150 W lamp housing, a mod. 620 power controlled lamp supply and a mod. 03-102 arc lamp pulser. Laser excitation was provided at 90° with respect to the white light probe beam. Light transmitted by the sample was focused onto the entrance slit of a 300 mm focal length Acton SpectraPro 2300i triple grating, flat field, double exit monochromator equipped with a photomultiplier detector (Hamamatsu R3896) and a Princeton Instruments PIMAX II gated intensified CCD camera, using a RB Gen II intensifier, a ST133 controller and a PTG pulser. Signals from the photomultiplier (kinetic traces) were processed by means of a LeCroy 9360 (600 MHz, 5 Gs s−1) digital oscilloscope.

Photocatalytic water oxidation
Photocatalyitic water oxidation tests were conducted in a home-made glass reactor equipped with a steel cap, where a FOXY-R-AF probe was mounted and interfaced with a Neofox Real-Time software for data collection. Irradiation was performed using a monochromatic LED (7 mW power) emitting at 450 nm; the photon flux was 2.63 × 10−8 einstein per s.
