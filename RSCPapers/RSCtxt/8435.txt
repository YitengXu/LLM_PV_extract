1. Introduction
Since the pioneering research led by Fujishima and Honda,1 TiO2 has been an appealing photoelectrode paradigm for conducting photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. With an intrinsically favorable charge transfer pathway2,3 and splendid chemical stability,4,5 TiO2 nanorod arrays have been widely utilized as photoanodes to catalyze a variety of PEC reactions. However, there are several disadvantages with the use of TiO2 which degrade the performance of PEC systems. The main problem is that TiO2 merely absorbs photons in the UV region, which occupies only 4% of the solar spectrum. Effective photon harvesting from solar energy is thus a concern. In addition, pristine TiO2 is subject to a mediocre carrier utilization efficiency because of its inherently pronounced charge recombination. To enhance the PEC efficiency of TiO2, many concepts and strategies have been proposed and realized. Coupling TiO2 with other small-bandgap semiconductors is one of the most widely used methods.6–9 As a typical II–VI compound semiconductor, CdSe has attracted considerable interest as a visible sensitizer for extending the photoactivity of TiO2 photoelectrodes.10–14 Importantly, a type-II staggered band structure can be considered at the interface between TiO2 and CdSe, which greatly enhances charge separation and promotes the overall PEC efficiency. However, CdSe is susceptible to typical photocorrosion issues, which deteriorate the stability of the photoelectrode during long-term PEC operation.15–17 How to maintain the photostability of CdSe-sensitized TiO2 is thus an important task to secure its practical use in PEC reactions.
Due to its exceptional optical, electronic and mechanical properties and its derived technologically important applications, graphene has garnered much attention in the past ten years.18–20 As the lateral size of graphene reduces to a few nanometers, many intriguing features emerge. For example, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with lateral sizes less than 20 nm resemble semiconductor nanostructures in an electronic band structure; notably, they show the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) semiconductor-like band structure.21 The results of density functional theory calculations suggest that there is a strong size dependence for the energy gap of GQDs;22 this dependence can be exploited for manipulating the band structure and tailoring GQDs for applications in diverse fields. The entry of GQDs in the field of solar water splitting is particularly appealing,23–27 considering their high chemical inertness that is inherited from graphene. With a well-defined band structure, GQDs can also function as charge separation enhancers and light absorption sensitizers, which can be used to enhance the PEC efficiency of semiconductor photoelectrodes such as ZnO23,24 and TiO2.25–27
In this work, we demonstrated that the incorporation of GQDs can greatly improve the PEC efficiency of CdSe-sensitized TiO2 nanorods (denoted as TiO2/CdSe), a TiO2-based visible light-responsive photoelectrode paradigm, toward solar hydrogen production. The samples were synthesized by growing GQDs on the surface of TiO2–CdSe nanorod arrays (denoted as TiO2/CdSe/GQDs). For binary TiO2–CdSe, the band alignment at the interface results in photoexcited electron transport from CdSe to TiO2 and photogenerated hole transport from TiO2 to CdSe. Despite an enhanced charge separation, the accumulated holes at CdSe may induce photocorrosive oxidation to decompose CdSe; thus, the long-term stability of the photoelectrode deteriorates, which decreases the PEC performance. With the introduction of GQDs, the delocalized holes can further transfer from CdSe to GQDs, which eases hole accumulation at the CdSe sites and retards photocorrosion. Compared to binary TiO2/CdSe, the ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs photoanode displays higher photocurrent and better photostability toward PEC hydrogen production. This superiority can be attributed to vectorial charge transfer and enhanced reaction kinetics that are provided by the introduced GQDs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Growth of TiO2 nanorod arrays
A hydrothermal approach was used to grow TiO2 nanorod arrays.5,28 In a typical procedure, deionized water (35 mL), concentrated hydrochloric acid (35 mL) and titanium n-butoxide were (1.167 mL) first mixed together in a 100 mL beaker. Afterward, the mixture was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, in which fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were placed in a vertical position. After the hydrothermal reaction at 150 °C for 5 h, the as-grown TiO2 nanorod arrays were taken out, washed using deionized water and annealed at 550 °C for 3 h.
2.2 Deposition of CdSe on TiO2
CdSe was deposited on the TiO2 nanorod surface by chemical bath deposition (CBD).29 TiO2 was first immersed in mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) solution (10 mM) at 40 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h; this was followed by incubation in cadmium nitrate solution (25 mM) for another hour. This treatment led to the adsorption of Cd2+ ions onto the TiO2 nanorod surface. Furthermore, a growth solution for CBD was prepared by mixing 20 mL of 80 mM cadmium nitrate solution, 20 mL of sodium selenosulfate solution and 20 mL of 120 mM trisodium nitrilotriacetate solution. The Cd2+-adsorbed TiO2 was then incubated in the growth solution at 10 °C for 12 h to achieve CdSe deposition. For comparison purposes, a corresponding amount of pure CdSe was also prepared and deposited on clean FTO substrates with the same CBD method.
2.3 Deposition of GQDs on TiO2–CdSe
Pure GQDs were first prepared with a hydrothermal cutting method reported previously.21 In a typical process, graphene oxide (GO) was obtained with the typical Hummers' method by using graphite powder as the source.30 The GO sheets were then transformed into the reduced form (RGO) in a hydrothermal process operated at 200 °C for 24 h. The collected RGO (50 mg) was dispersed in a mixed solution comprising concentrated sulfuric acid (10 mL) and nitric acid (30 mL). After refluxing at 100 °C for 20 h, the reaction solution was purified using a 0.22 μm microporous membrane. Afterwards, the purified RGO (20 mg) was re-dispersed in deionized water (40 mL). The reaction solution was then placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to carry out the hydrothermal reaction at 200 °C for 10 h. Finally, a black precipitate was obtained and purified using a dialysis bag with a filter rating of 3500 Da for one day. The obtained GQD suspension (100 μL, 0.55 mg mL−1) was dropped onto TiO2/CdSe and allowed to dry at 70 °C to achieve the deposition of GQDs. For comparison purposes, a corresponding amount of pure GQDs was also deposited on pristine TiO2 nanorod arrays by drop coating deposition (TiO2/GQDs).
2.4 PEC measurements
PEC analysis was performed in a three-electrode system which used Pt as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was composed of a mixture of sodium sulfide (Na2S, 0.25 M) and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, 0.35 M). A 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter (Newport, LCS-100, 94011A) was employed as the irradiation source. A potentiostat (Autolab, PGSTAT204) was employed to collect all the PEC data. Nyquist measurements were obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and were performed under AM 1.5G illumination at open-circuit voltage (Voc). The AC voltage was set at 10 mV with a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The Mott–Schottky data were recorded under dark conditions at 1000 Hz to determine the flat-band potential (VFB) and carrier concentration (Nd). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data were recorded under monochromatic irradiation produced by a xenon lamp equipped with a monochromator.
2.5 Characterization
The microstructure was characterized with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-3000) conducted at 300 kV and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8010). The crystallographic structure was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D2 phaser) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a Hitachi U-3900H spectrophotometer. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometers. The time-resolved PL spectra were recorded in a single photon counting system with an instrument response function of 25 ps FWHM. A sub-nanosecond pulsed diode laser (λ = 320 nm, PicoQuant, PLS 320) was used as the excitation source. The collected PL decay spectra were fitted with a bi-exponential kinetics model to obtain information regarding carrier lifetime. In this model, two carrier lifetimes, τ1 and τ2, and the corresponding amplitudes, A1 and A2, can be obtained. The intensity-average carrier lifetime, 〈τ〉, was also computed for comparison. All the fitting results are summarized in Table 1, in which the values of the reduced chi-square (χ2) were all close to unity, indicating an ideal fit to the entire set of the data. The hydrogen production in the PEC system was quantified by analyzing the gas product with gas chromatography (GC, Bruker SCION, 463-MS).

3. Results and discussion
The SEM images of pristine TiO2, binary TiO2/CdSe and ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs are presented in Fig. 1(a)–(c). Pristine TiO2 demonstrated partially aligned nanorod bundles on the FTO substrate. After CBD of CdSe, the surface of the nanorods became wrinkled, accompanied by an increase in the nanorod diameter. However, further deposition of GQDs did not give rise to any appreciable morphological changes. This was understandable since the size of the GQDs was too small to be recognized with SEM. Fig. 1(d) shows the corresponding XRD patterns, all of which were dominated by the diffraction of FTO and TiO2. Peaks marked by deep red circles were the signals from the FTO substrate, while peaks marked by blue diamonds resulted from rutile TiO2. Because of their relatively low contents, it was impossible to identify CdSe or GQDs from the XRD patterns. Nevertheless, the successful deposition of CdSe and GQDs could be validated by TEM and SAED analyses.

Fig. 2 displays the HRTEM and SAED analytical results for the three samples. The insets show low-magnification TEM images that first highlight the microstructural features on the nanorod surface. A smooth nanorod surface was found for pristine TiO2. Pronounced surface protrusions were, however, noticed for TiO2/CdSe and TiO2/CdSe/GQDs, presumably due to being decorated by CdSe and GQDs. For pristine TiO2, the observed interlayer distance of 0.32 nm could be assigned to lattice spacings of (110) of rutile TiO2. For binary TiO2/CdSe, the nanorod surface was decorated by an appreciable amount of CdSe particles with a size ranging from 5 to 10 nm. The chemical composition of wurtzite CdSe can be identified from the resolved lattice fringe of (110) in the HRTEM image and the additional stretched dots of the SAED pattern. For the ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs, a thin layer composed of GQD aggregates was found deposited on the CdSe surface. The recorded interlayer spacing of (002) and an unambiguous ring pattern confirmed the chemical composition of graphitic carbon31 for the deposited GQDs. It is important to point out that the introduced GQDs were in direct contact with the surface-decorated CdSe. Note that the GQDs were derived from Hummers' method, and their surface possessed a large number of oxygenated groups to enable chemical grafting. The surface-decorated CdSe, on the other hand, was enriched with a nitrilotriacetic ligand, a well-known chelating agent that can form stable chelates with introduced GQDs.32 This attribute is crucial for the direct contact of GQDs with CdSe, which we considered significant for promoting vectorial charge transfer at the interface.

As shown in Fig. 3(a), pristine TiO2 absorbed light with an absorption onset at about 400 nm, complying well with the reported bandgap of rutile TiO2.33 Upon the CBD of CdSe, the absorption edge was extended to the visible region. This extension could be assigned to the sensitizing effect of the deposited CdSe. A further deposition of GQDs did not show a significant effect on the absorption edge. This was expected since the electronic transition of GQDs mostly lies in the UV region.21 The optical bandgap energy was further calculated using the corresponding Tauc plots in Fig. 3(b). By assuming a direct electronic transition, the bandgaps of pristine TiO2, TiO2/CdSe and TiO2/CdSe/GQDs could be determined to be 3.1, 2.1 and 2.1 eV, respectively. To understand the charge transfer scenario among TiO2, CdSe and GQDs, steady-state PL and time-resolved PL spectra were collected and interpreted. If charge separation occurred, recombination of electron–hole pairs would be significantly suppressed, leading to a depression in PL intensity.34–47Fig. 3(c) shows the steady-state PL spectra. Pristine TiO2 exhibited fairly broad PL emission with two overlapping bands composed of band edge and trap-state emissions.48 After the deposition of CdSe and GQDs, the PL emission of TiO2 was greatly reduced as a consequence of interfacial charge transfer. Here, a typical type-II band structure was considered for TiO2/CdSe, in which the conduction band and valence band levels of CdSe were both more negative than those of TiO2.49,50 Under light illumination, charge separation took place at the interface between TiO2 and CdSe. This resulted in electrons concentrating at TiO2 and holes accumulating at CdSe. This led to a reduced charge recombination for TiO2 and therefore a significant reduction of PL as observed. With the deposition of GQDs on CdSe, the accumulated holes at the CdSe sites would further transfer to the GQDs due to the less positive HOMO level of the GQDs when compared to the valence band potential of CdSe.21 This vectorial charge transfer pathway evinced an increasingly significant charge separation at the interface,51 thereby leading to the much pronounced PL reduction of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs. Time-resolved PL data were collected to quantitatively analyze the efficiency of charge separation. As evident from Fig. 3(d), the three TiO2-based samples exhibited substantially distinct kinetics decay profiles, manifesting the significant role of CdSe and GQDs in affecting the charge transfer scenario of TiO2. The deposition of CdSe and GQDs fastened the PL decay kinetics of TiO2, in consistence with the quenching effect observed in steady-state PL spectra. These kinetics profiles were further analyzed with a bi-exponential function to generate a slow (τ1) and a fast (τ2) carrier lifetime respectively associated with radiative and non-radiative charge recombination pathways. As summarized in Table 1, pristine TiO2 had an average carrier lifetime of 0.77 ns. Upon CdSe deposition, the carrier lifetime of TiO2 was reduced to 0.43 ns, signifying the emergence of an additional charge depletion pathway as a result of the CdSe deposition. By presuming that charge transfer between TiO2 and CdSe was accountable for the observed reduced carrier lifetime, the rate constant of charge transfer (kct) was calculated using the equation:52–65  
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, (b) Tauc plots, (c) steady-state PL spectra, (d) time-resolved PL spectra of pristine TiO2, TiO2/CdSe and TiO2/CdSe/GQDs. 
For TiO2/CdSe, the kct value was estimated to be 1.03 × 109 s−1. When GQDs were further introduced, the carrier lifetime further declined to 0.22 ns, reflecting a largely enhanced kct of 3.25 × 109 s−1. This outcome suggested that incorporating GQDs can significantly enhance the charge separation efficiency of TiO2/CdSe.
The PEC properties toward solar hydrogen production were studied by employing the samples as photoanodes. For comparison purposes, pure CdSe, pure GQDs and binary TiO2/GQD photoanodes were also tested in the PEC cell. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the linear-sweep voltammograms (I–V curves) and chronoamperometric scans (I–t curves) for the relevant photoanodes collected under darkness and AM 1.5G illumination. Notably, the pristine TiO2 photoanode exhibited a mediocre photocurrent density of 0.3 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.96 V vs. RHE). With the deposition of CdSe, the photocurrent increased to 1.5 mA cm−2. This dramatic increase could be ascribed to the extensive photon absorption and improved charge separation provided by the deposited CdSe. Furthermore, an appreciable cathodic shift of photocurrent onset potential can be noticed for TiO2/CdSe. This result suggested that CdSe deposition could also improve the kinetics of PEC reactions, which will later be examined with EIS analysis. On the other hand, GQD deposition also enhanced the PEC performance of TiO2 in terms of an increase in photocurrent generation and a cathodic shift of photocurrent onset potential. For the TiO2/GQD photoanode, the recorded photocurrent (0.6 mA cm−2 at 0.96 V vs. RHE) was two times the performance of pristine TiO2. The PEC photoactivity of TiO2 could be greatly enhanced with the deposition of both CdSe and GQDs. For the TiO2/CdSe/GQD photoanode, the photocurrent density could reach as high as 2.3 mA cm−2, which was 7.7 times the value of pristine TiO2 and 1.5 times the value of TiO2/CdSe. It should be noted that both pure CdSe and pure GQDs exhibited photocurrent values at a μA cm−2 scale, almost three orders of magnitude smaller than the value of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs. The significantly higher photocurrent of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs compared to the photocurrent sum from the three pure constituents further revealed the synergistic effect between the TiO2, CdSe and GQD constituents in promoting the overall PEC efficiency. Another important feature worth noting from Fig. 4(a) and (b) was the consistent photocurrent values recorded from the I–V and I–t measurements. This outcome suggested that there was no photoinduced charging effect, which may deteriorate the PEC performance in practice.

For TiO2/CdSe/GQDs, the photogenerated holes would preferentially transfer from TiO2 through CdSe and then to the GQDs. The efficient removal of the delocalized holes at the CdSe sites could secure long-term stability for extended PEC operations. Fig. 4(c) further examines the photocurrent stability of solar hydrogen production for the three photoanodes. The pristine TiO2 photoanode was fairly stable in photocurrent generation, reflecting the high chemical stability of TiO2. In contrast, the binary TiO2/CdSe photoanode showed obvious photocurrent decay, losing 15.7% of the initial photocurrent under continuous irradiation for only 30 min. This instability originated from the severe photocorrosion of CdSe associated with hole accumulation.21 The ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs photoanode, however, exhibited highly stable photocurrent generation at the same irradiation time. Because GQDs can mediate vectorial charge transfer by accepting photogenerated holes from CdSe, photocorrosive oxidation at CdSe can be effectively inhibited. As a result of photocorrosion inhibition, the ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs can retain high stability during PEC reactions. Another notable feature from Fig. 4(c) was the slight photocurrent variation with illumination time. Photocurrent fluctuation over extended periods has been widely observed in the literature.66,67 Two possible factors may have contributed to this outcome. First, oscillation of irradiation intensity posed background noise to bring forth inevitable photocurrent variation. Second, vigorous gas evolution at the electrode surface disturbed charge carrier transfer, also causing much fluctuation in the photocurrent signals. To elucidate the mechanism of the enhanced photoactivity of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs, IPCE measurements were carried out to investigate the photoactive wavelength region. The IPCE value at a specific wavelength was calculated from the equation:34  where I is the measured photocurrent and Plight is the power density of incident light at a specific wavelength λ. As Fig. 4(d) shows, the three photoanodes displayed a photoactive region spectrally consistent with their characteristic absorption spectra. This feature suggested that the photons absorbed by a bandgap transition can be utilized for driving effective hydrogen production. In comparison with pristine TiO2 and binary TiO2/CdSe, ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs had considerably larger IPCE values from the UV to visible regions. This outcome illustrated that the deposition of GQDs could improve the carrier utilization efficiency of both TiO2 and CdSe components as a consequence of vectorial charge transfer.
In the interest of quantifying carrier utilization improvement by the addition of GQDs, we further compared the charge separation efficiency of the three photoanodes during PEC operations. Note that the recorded photocurrent for the PEC reaction (I) is a product of the theoretical maximal photocurrent (Jabs), the charge separation efficiency (Φsep) and the charge injection efficiency (Φinj),68,69i.e. I = Jabs × Φsep × Φinj. Here, we assumed Φinj = 100% because Na2S/Na2SO3 was used as a hole scavenger for the current PEC measurements. The Φsep value could then be computed by dividing the recorded photocurrent by Jabs:  
On the other hand, Jabs represented the theoretical photocurrent assuming that all the absorbed photons were 100% converted to electrons. By measuring the light harvesting efficiency (LHE = 1 − 10absorbance)70 and integrating it with respect to the AM 1.5G solar spectrum, Jabs could be calculated at a specific incident wavelength. To examine the beneficial effect of the GQDs on the carrier utilization of the TiO2 and CdSe components, two incident wavelengths corresponding to their bandgap absorption (350 and 500 nm) were considered. Using the calculated Jabs and I–V curves collected at the two incident wavelengths, Fig. 5 presents the Φsep data as a function of applied bias for the three photoanodes. Under 350 nm illumination, the TiO2/CdSe/GQD photoanode achieved a Φsep value of 11.5% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, an approximately 9.0% increase over that of pristine TiO2 (Φsep = 2.5%) and a 1.6% increase over that of TiO2/CdSe (Φsep = 9.9%). Under 500 nm illumination, the Φsep of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs reached 17.7% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, an approximately 16.4% increase over that of pristine TiO2 (Φsep = 1.3%) and a 3.4% increase over that of TiO2/CdSe (Φsep = 14.3%). The significant Φsep enhancement of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs under both UV and visible illumination verified that the TiO2 and CdSe components could both benefit from the deposition of GQDs and that this synergy contributed to the superior PEC efficiency.

To interrogate the charge transfer and recombination dynamics for TiO2/CdSe/GQDs, we further collected Voc decay data and EIS spectra. Fig. 6(a) shows the time-dependent decay of Voc for the three photoanodes after the cessation of irradiation. Note that the Voc decay at the end of irradiation was derived from the depletion of photoexcited electrons by either recombining with the delocalized holes or being trapped at the trap states.34,71 The decay rate of Voc was therefore correlated with the fate of photoexcited electrons, which can serve as a quantitative index to estimate the charge carrier lifetime. As Fig. 6(a) presents, ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs displayed the slowest Voc decay rate among the three photoanodes. The much pronounced charge separation may account for this superiority. The nominal photoexcited electron lifetime (τn) can be determined by the equation:14  where kBT is the thermal energy at temperature T (kBT = 4.11 × 10−21 J at 298 K), e0 is the electron charge (e0 = 1.60 × 10−19 C) and dVoc/dt is the time derivative of Voc. As evident from Fig. 6(b), the calculated τn of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs was substantially larger than those of pristine TiO2 and TiO2/CdSe under the same Voc conditions. This observation corroborated that the synergy between the GQDs and CdSe greatly prohibited charge recombination within TiO2 and prolonged the carrier lifetime. On the other hand, the τn fluctuation in the large Voc region in Fig. 6(b) was believed to originate from the considerably slow decay of Voc at extended time. For Voc decay measurements, the photoexcited electrons were first accumulated at the conduction band under open-circuit condition to cause an increase in Voc. Once illumination ceased, the accumulated electrons were subject to charge recombination, instantly decreasing Voc to a certain level. As the photoexcited electrons depleted with time, the decay of Voc became less and less pronounced. Since τn is inversely proportional to the rate of Voc decay, significant τn variation could be observed at extended time, the region where Voc was decreased to a fairly anodic level.

Fig. 6(c) displays the Nyquist plots for the three photoanodes. The radii of the arcs for binary TiO2/CdSe and ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs were substantially lower than that of pristine TiO2. This result implied that the charge transfer resistance could be largely reduced by addition of CdSe or GQDs. To better understand the charge transfer kinetics at the photoanode surface, Nyquist plots were fitted with a suitable RC equivalent circuit. As the inset of Fig. 6(c) depicts, Rs stands for overall series resistance, Rct means charge transport resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, and Cct denotes capacitance at the interface.72 Here, Rct was the most important index because it represented the resistance of charge transport from the photoanode surface to electrolyte. The fitted results of the Nyquist plots are listed in Table 2. Compared with pristine TiO2 (Rct = 1051.8 kΩ), binary TiO2/CdSe had a much reduced Rct (Rct = 1.8 kΩ), signifying that CdSe deposition could improve the kinetics of PEC reactions for TiO2. The observed significant cathodic shift of photocurrent onset potential supported the above argument. The much reduced Rct for ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs (Rct = 0.5 kΩ) further revealed a key role of GQDs in facilitating the surface reaction kinetics for TiO2/CdSe. To unravel the fundamental role of GQDs, Mott–Schottky analysis was performed. Fig. 6(d) displays the Mott–Schottky plots for the three electrodes. These plots were analyzed with the following equation:73–75  where C is the space charge capacitance, Nd is the carrier density, e0 is the electron charge (e0 = 1.60 × 10−19 C), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), ε is the relative permittivity of the material (ε = 86 for TiO276), V is the applied bias, VFB is the flat-band potential, T is the temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant (kB = 1.38 × 10−23 m2 kg s−2 K−1). By determining the slope of linear fit and extrapolating the linear fit to 1/C2 = 0, the values of Nd and VFB could be obtained to provide more insights. As noted in Table 2, ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs had the highest Nd and the most cathodic VFB. On the one hand, the much enlarged Nd ensured an abundance of charge carriers that could participate in redox reactions, which would be beneficial for PEC applications from a kinetics point of view. On the other hand, the most cathodic VFB led to increasingly pronounced band bending inside the depletion layer of the electrodes under anodic bias conditions. This meant that photoexcited charge carriers could be effectively separated and then drift within the depletion layer during PEC operations. With the cooperation of these two effects, the surface reaction kinetics could be largely facilitated by the deposited GQDs for enhancing the overall PEC performance of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs.

In Fig. 7(a), a plausible charge transfer mechanism to illustrate the superior PEC efficiency of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs is proposed. Based on the reported band structure of the TiO2, CdSe and GQD components,3,21 we considered a typical type-II staggered band structure for TiO2/CdSe/GQDs. Under light illumination, the photogenerated holes of TiO2 mostly transported to CdSe and finally to GQDs due to the GQDs having a less positive HOMO level (+1.15 V vs. NHE) than the valence band (VB) levels of CdSe (+1.70 V vs. NEH) and TiO2 (+2.90 V vs. NHE). Meanwhile, the photoexcited electrons passed in an opposite direction, from the GQDs to CdSe and finally to TiO2 because the GQDs have a more negative LUMO level (−2.60 V vs. NHE) than the conduction band (CB) levels of CdSe (−0.40 V vs. NEH) and TiO2 (−0.20 V vs. NHE). Note that such a vectorial charge transfer pathway gave rise to a more significant charge separation at the interface that enhanced the PEC photoactivity. Furthermore, the efficient removal of the delocalized holes at the CdSe sites provided long-term stability for extended PEC operations, which also contributed to the superior PEC efficiency of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs. It is important to note that the lateral size of the GQDs can be readily controlled by adjusting the acid treatment time prior to the hydrothermal reaction. According to the previous report,21 GQDs with a reduced size exhibited enhanced optical properties and improved charge dynamics, both of which were believed to benefit the PEC performance of the present TiO2/CdSe/GQDs. The solar hydrogen production in PEC cells was also evaluated by analyzing the gas product at the counter electrode under bias conditions. As Fig. 7(b) shows, all the three photoanodes exhibited vital activity toward solar hydrogen production with an overall faradaic efficiency exceeding 87%. In particular, the ternary TiO2/CdSe/GQDs photoanode attained a 2.4-fold higher activity of hydrogen production than pristine TiO2. This demonstration illustrated the future of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs as competent photoelectrodes for miscellaneous kinds of solar PEC applications.77–79

4. Conclusions
Modifying with chalcogenide semiconductors has been regarded as a remedy to the large bandgap challenge associated with the utilization of TiO2 for solar hydrogen production. However, photocorrosion caused by hole accumulation at the chalcogenides has hindered the advancement of this approach. It is therefore highly desirable to seek a rational tactic to resolve the above issue. By introducing GQDs to promote vectorial charge transfer, the photocorrosion issue of TiO2/CdSe photoanodes toward solar hydrogen production could be resolved. The introduced GQDs also enhanced charge carrier separation and facilitated surface reaction kinetics, both of which contributed to the superior PEC efficiency of TiO2/CdSe/GQDs. Our unprecedented discovery provides a potentially global strategy of creating GQD-modified chalcogenide-sensitized semiconductor photoelectrodes for durable solar-to-fuel conversion applications.
