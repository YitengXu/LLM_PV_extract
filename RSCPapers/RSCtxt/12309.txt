    , Accepted 15th June 2017First published on 16th June 2017AbstractA two-step method is widely used to fabricate highly efficient perovskite solar cells. In a typical two-step method, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites are fabricated from PbI2 films through an intercalation reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I, which usually have a rough surface and residual PbI2 due to a compact PbI2 structure. Here, we introduce some strong Lewis bases into PbI2/DMF solutions in the first step, which is helpful in controlling the morphology of PbI2 films with a mesoporous structure. The mesopores in the PbI2 films provide not only space for accommodating the volume expansion during the reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I, but also channels for CH3NH3I solution to diffuse into the PbI2 films, which helps eliminate the residual PbI2 and the dissolution and recrystallization process. As a result, smooth perovskite films without residual PbI2 are easily obtained. The power conversion efficiency, stability and reproducibility of the perovskite solar cells fabricated from the optimized mesoporous PbI2 films improved simultaneously due to the improvement in perovskite films. This work reveals the key roles of solvents (boiling point, Lewis basicity) in controlling the microstructure of the PbI2 films.
1. Introduction
Organometallic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their high power conversion efficiency, low cost, and ease of fabrication.1–3 To achieve highly efficient PSCs, a series of methods, such as a one-step method,4 a two-step method,5,6 dual-source evaporation,7 and vapor-assisted deposition,8,9 have been developed to fabricate high quality perovskite films. Among these methods, the two-step method is the most used due to high coverage and uniform grains of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) films. In typical two-step methods, PbI2 films are first deposited on substrates by spin-coating from dimethylformamide (DMF) solution followed by annealing, and then exposed to MAI/2-propanol (IPA) solution. The formation of MAPbI3 through the two-step method can be regarded as an intercalation reaction between the parent PbI2 crystallites and MAI.10 After the intercalation, the volume of the PbI2 lattice is expanded about 2.1 times.11 Meanwhile, some small grains might extrude from the surface, leading to rough perovskite films. Obviously, the structure of the parent PbI2 films, including the morphology, crystallinity, and density, influences the quality of the MAPbI3 films significantly.
Actually, the intercalation reaction between PbI2 and MAI is completed through a solid–liquid interfacial reaction.12 In the solid–liquid interfacial reaction, MAI diffuses and intercalates into the PbI2 lattices from the surface of the PbI2 films. However, the conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3 might be restrained gradually as the MAPbI3 forms from the surface. The MAPbI3 obstructs the diffusion of MAI. As a result, there are usually some residual PbI2 at the interface between the perovskite and mesoporous TiO2, which reduce the efficiency, reproducibility13 and long-term stability14 of the perovskite solar cells.
Some approaches have been proposed to prepare smooth perovskite films without residual PbI2. Wang et al. developed a hybrid deposition method for precisely controlling the flow of MAI and the deposition rate of metal halides. This hybrid deposition method allows growth of perovskite films with a smooth surface.15 Zhang et al. fabricated smooth perovskite films through applying stronger air flow on wet films.16 Kerner et al. obtained ultrasmooth perovskite thin films via sol–gel processing.17 Zhao et al. prepared PbI2-free perovskite films through a three-step sequential solution process.18 Zhang et al. obtained a smooth perovskite film through suppressing the final volume expansion ratio using a novel volume-expansion adjustable PbI2·xMAI precursor to replace pure PbI2 in the two-step method.19 Recently, we reported a modified two-step method to obtain smooth perovskite films by reducing volume expansion during the molecular exchange via pre-expanding the lattice of PbI2.20
Here, we develop a new route to obtain smooth perovskite films without residual PbI2via a typical two-step method by fabricating porous PbI2 films before the intercalation reaction. The morphology of the PbI2 films is controlled by introducing some additives with strong Lewis basicity into PbI2/DMF solutions. The conversion rate of PbI2 to MAPbI3 is boosted significantly in the porous PbI2 films. As a result, smooth perovskite films without residual PbI2 are easily obtained from the mesoporous PbI2 films. Compared with the PbI2 film fabricated from pure DMF, the performance and stability of the PSCs fabricated from mesoporous PbI2 film are improved significantly.
2. Experimental
Fabrication of the devices
FTO glass (TEC7, Pilkington) was successively cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, 2-propanol, ethanol, and deionized water, and dried using nitrogen gas. The glass was exposed to a UV ozone cleaner at 150 °C for 15 min before use. A compact layer of TiO2 was spin coated from titanium isopropoxy solution in ethanol at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was then made from depositing a diluted TiO2 paste (Dyesol-18NRT, Dyesol) in ethanol (2:7, weight ratio) on the compact TiO2 layer by spin-coating at 4500 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The mesoporous PbI2 films were made from PbI2/DMF solution (1.0 M) with different amounts of Lewis base additives by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s; the film was left to dry at room temperature and then annealed at 70 °C for 30 min to remove the solvent. After being cooled, the PbI2 films were dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I (MAI) in 2-propanol with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 for 10 min to prepare perovskite films, and then annealed at 100 °C for 60 min. A hole transport layer was prepared by dissolving 100 mg Spiro-MeOTAD, 40 μL TBP, 36.3 μL TFSI (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 60 μL FK102 (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene, and deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After drying, a thin layer of gold (60 nm) was deposited on the top of HTM to form a back electrode. The active area of the electrodes was fixed at 0.06 cm2.
Characterization
The PbI2 and perovskite films were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, MERLIN VP Compact), atomic force microscopy (AFM5500, Agilent), X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8-Advance), and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy (Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR, Agilent Technologies) in a range from 400 nm to 900 nm. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was characterized by using a QEX10 solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV measurements, USA). Current–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs were obtained using a Keithley 4200-SCS parameter analyzer sweeping from −0.1 to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, illuminated under a solar simulator (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, 91195, Newport).
3. Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the fabrication process of PbI2 films with controllable morphology by adding some additives with different Lewis basicities in the PbI2/DMF solution. Donor number (DN) is usually used to evaluate the Lewis basicity of a solvent. The larger the DN, the stronger the Lewis basicity. The DN of a binary solution can be modulated by changing the component.21 DMF, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) are typical O-donor strong Lewis base solvents with DN values of 26.6, 27.3, 29.8, and 38.8, respectively.22,23 The molecular structure of the solvents is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In our previous work, we revealed that Lewis adducts of PbI2·xSol are formed when the PbI2 solution is spin-coated on a mesoporous TiO2 substrate,20 where PbI2 acts as the Lewis acid, and solvent molecules act as the Lewis base. Those solvent molecules can coordinate to Pb2+ through Pb–O bonds, and Pb2+ prefers to coordinate to the solvent with stronger coordinating ability in binary solvents.24 The strength of the Pb–O bond increases as the DN of the additive increases.25,26 The Lewis adducts of PbI2·xSol convert to PbI2 by removing solvent molecules via an annealing treatment. Thus, the morphology of the PbI2 films depends on the Lewis basicity of the solutions.
 Scheme 1  Schematic of the fabrication process of the mesoporous PbI2 film from solutions with different strong Lewis bases. 
We first optimize the concentration of these strong Lewis base additives in the PbI2/DMF solution to obtain continuous and mesoporous PbI2 films. The optimized concentration of the strong Lewis base is 30%, 20%, 5% for NMP, DMSO, HMPA, respectively. Fig. 1 shows top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the PbI2 films fabricated from the solutions with optimized concentrations of Lewis base additives. The PbI2 film fabricated from the pure DMF solution exhibits a densely packed structure (Fig. 1a). The cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 1b further confirms the compact structure of the PbI2 film fabricated from the pure DMF solution. The compact structure restrains MAI from diffusing into the PbI2 film, leading to some residual PbI2 (Fig. 2a). By adding some strong Lewis base additives in the PbI2/DMF solutions, the compact PbI2 films transform to loose ones with a mesoporous structure. The size and density of the pores in the PbI2 film depend on the Lewis basicity of the additives. With increasing Lewis basicity of additives, both the pore size and density increase evidently (Fig. 1c–h). The SEM images of the PbI2 films fabricated from other concentrations (unoptimized) are provided in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Too much or too little additives (NMP, DMSO, or HMPA) in the PbI2/DMF solution will significantly reduce the pore structure, or lead to too many pores and even to the formation of discontinuous films.

The boiling points of DMF, NMP, DMSO, and HMPA are 152, 202, 189, 235 °C, respectively.27,28 The strong Lewis base additives have higher boiling points than DMF to reduce the evaporation of the solvent during the spinning process. Furthermore, the strength of Pb–O bonds in the Lewis adduct increases with increasing Lewis basicity of the solvent. Therefore, the higher boiling point and stronger Pb–O bonds in the Lewis adducts slow down the escape of solvent from the PbI2-based Lewis adduct (PbI2·xSol) films.25 The residual solvent molecule will be released when PbI2·xSol is annealed at high temperature. The release of solvent molecules is the mechanism behind the appearance of pores in the PbI2 film.
In order to observe the reaction process of perovskites, we deposit PbI2 films on the compact TiO2 film from different solutions. XRD patterns and optical images of the perovskite films versus reaction time are shown in Fig. 2. The compact PbI2 films fabricated from PbI2/DMF solutions without any additives convert to perovskite films in the MAI/IPA solution slowly. There are still some residual PbI2 in the perovskite film after 60 min of reaction (Fig. 2a). As expected, the conversion speed increases greatly when there are some pores in the PbI2 films (Fig. 2b–d). For the films with abundant pores, the PbI2 films convert to perovskite completely within 8 min (Fig. 2d), which is almost 8 times faster than that of the compact films (Fig. 2a). The colour of the films change in Fig. 2e further demonstrates the conversion rate of PbI2 to perovskite modulated by the Lewis basicity of the solvents.

Fig. 3a shows the XRD patterns of the MAPbI3 films on the mesoporous TiO2 substrate fabricated from different solutions by dipping the PbI2 films in 10 mg mL−1 MAI/IPA solution for 10 min. It is clear that the conversion speed from PbI2 to MAPbI3 increases due to the pores in the PbI2 films. The PbI2 films can convert to MAPbI3 completely with stronger Lewis base additives of DMSO and HMPA within 10 min. But, there are still some residual PbI2 in the perovskite films prepared from the PbI2/DMF solutions with and without NMP additives. Fig. 3b shows the UV absorption spectra of the corresponding MAPbI3 films. All the spectra exhibit onsets of absorption at 775 nm, corresponding to the optical band gap of MAPbI3 (∼1.6 eV).29 The light absorption ability increases with the Lewis basicity of the additives, which might have derived from increasing the thickness of the MAPbI3 films. It is noted that there is an obvious sharp absorption at 530 nm for the MAPbI3 film fabricated from pure DMF solutions, corresponding to the band gap of PbI2 (∼2.30 eV).14 It implies that there are some residual PbI2 in the perovskite films, which is consistent with the XRD patterns (Fig. 3a).

Fig. 4 shows the SEM and AFM images of the MAPbI3 films fabricated from different Lewis basicity solutions. The perovskite films fully cover the TiO2 substrate for the samples prepared from pure DMF, 30% NMP, and 20% DMSO (see Fig. 4a, c and e). However, there are many holes in the perovskite film fabricated from the HMPA solution (see Fig. 4g). The high coverage of the MAPbI3 film is ascribed to two times volume expansion of PbI2 during the intercalation reaction.11 However, if the PbI2 film possess large pore size or has high pore density (see Fig. 1g), it might lead to an inhomogeneous and even discontinuous perovskite film (see Fig. 4g). The roughness of the perovskite films is characterized by AFM. The average roughness (Ra) values are 40.1, 27.4, 24.5, and 47.2 nm for the perovskite films fabricated from pure DMF, 30% NMP, 20% DMSO, and 5% HMPA, respectively. Perovskite films with smooth surfaces are desired for highly efficient PSCs. As mentioned above, the reaction between PbI2 and MAI is an intercalation reaction. During the intercalation of MAI into PbI2, the volume expansion is about 2.1 times.11 Meanwhile, some small grains extrude to the surface due to the expansion, which increases the roughness. Furthermore, the reaction between PbI2 and MAI is also a solid–liquid interfacial reaction.12 MAPbI3 forms at the surface of the densely packed PbI2 films, which suppresses the interfacial reaction. As a result, I− ions accumulate at the surface of the perovskite film. The excess amount of I− ions can provide a driving force that dissolves the initially formed MAPbI3 and unreacted PbI2 to form a PbI42− complex in an iodine rich environment through a dissolution and recrystallization growth mechanism12 as per the following formula:CH3NH3PbI3(s) + I−(sol) → CH3NH3+(sol) + PbI42−(sol) PbI2(s) + I−(sol) → PbI42−(sol)The PbI42− ions can react with MA+ ions to grow cube-like MAPbI3 on the surface by the following reactionPbI42−(sol) + CH3NH3+(sol) → CH3NH3PbI3(s) + I−(sol)

The cube-like MAPbI3 grains (see light dots in Fig. 4a and b) also increase the roughness of the perovskite film fabricated from the compact PbI2 film. This phenomenon becomes more obvious by prolonging the reaction time or increasing the concentration of MAI (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Therefore, the smooth perovskite film fabricated from the 20% DMSO additive film can be ascribed to the dual function of the pores in the PbI2 film. On the one hand, the pores provide space for accommodating the lattice expansion during conversion from PbI2 to MAPbI3. On the other hand, the pores provide channels for I− ions, which is responsible for the increased conversion rate, and the elimination of the dissolution and recrystallization process.

Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the best perovskite solar cells fabricated from different Lewis basicity solutions. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The PSC fabricated from the solution with the DMSO additive exhibits the highest photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.17%, short current density (Jsc) of 22.55 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.710, and open voltage of (Voc) 1.01 V. The photovoltaic parameters are higher than those of PSCs fabricated from pure DMF (PCE = 12.25%, Jsc = 20.91 mA cm−2, FF = 0.592, Voc = 0.99 V). Other PSCs fabricated from solutions with stronger Lewis base additives (such as NMP) also exhibit higher performance than those of the PSCs fabricated from pure DMF solutions due to their almost full conversion (Fig. 3a). The improved performances are mainly ascribed to the elimination of residual PbI2 in perovskite films, enhancement of harvest ability (Fig. 3b), as well as decrease in series resistance (Table 1). The statistical results of a series of devices further exhibit a similar tendency of photovoltaic properties as shown in Fig. 6. This strategy also increases the reproducibility of making PSCs from mesoporous PbI2 films due to the elimination of residual PbI2 (see Table S1, ESI†).

 Fig. 6  Statistical results of the photovoltaic properties extracted from a series of PSCs. 
We also measured the stabilized output by applying a voltage near the maximum power point (see Fig. 5b). The PSCs fabricated from DMSO solution exhibit higher stabilized output than those fabricated from pure DMF. It is noted that both steady outputs are lower than the values obtained from the reverse scan, which is widely observed in PSCs with obvious hysteresis behaviors (see Fig. S4, ESI†).30–32 The typical incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the PSC is shown in Fig. 5c. It demonstrates that the PSCs fabricated from DMSO solution exhibit better quantum yield ability than the PSCs fabricated from pure DMF, which is in accordance with the photovoltaic performance. It is worth noting that the integrated Jsc extracted from the IPCE spectrum is lower than the value obtained from the reverse scan. This phenomenon may be attributed to the mismatch of light spectrum33 and irradiated areas34 between the IPCE measurement and reverse scan, or the presence of surface defects on TiO2,35 which is widely observed in PSCs with obvious hysteresis behaviors (see Fig. S4, ESI†).33–35 The discrepancy of Jsc between the IPCE spectrum and the value obtained from the reverse scan is also probably due to the slow response of Jsc as can be seen in the time-dependent current density36 as shown in Fig. 5b. The PSCs fabricated from pure DMF exhibit a sharp drop of the IPCE spectrum in the long wavelength region (dark line in Fig. 5c), which might be related to the residual PbI2 due to its large band gap (∼2.3 eV).37

Fig. 5d shows the stability of PSCs fabricated from densely packed PbI2 films and mesoporous PbI2 films, respectively. The PSCs fabricated from mesoporous PbI2 exhibit higher stability. The PSCs still maintain about 66% of the initial efficiency after 14 days in air, and show slow colour change rate to PbI2 after being exposed to air for 14 days (see photographs in Fig. 5d). However, the PSCs fabricated from compact PbI2 decay quickly. The PSCs show obvious colour degradation after storing in air for 14 days (see photographs in Fig. 5d). The fast degradation may be related to the residual PbI2 in the perovskite films (dark line in Fig. 4a), which reduces the stability of the devices.14,38
4. Conclusion
In summary, mesoporous PbI2 films with controllable pore size and density are prepared by introducing some strong Lewis bases into PbI2/DMF solutions. The mesoporous PbI2 films convert to perovskite films more easily and faster than the compact ones. The pores in the PbI2 films provide not only channels for the penetration of MAI, but also space to accommodate the volume expansion during the intercalation reaction. Therefore, smooth perovskite films without residual PbI2 are easily obtained by adding suitable strong Lewis bases in the PbI2/DMF solution. Perovskite solar cells fabricated from the mesoporous PbI2 films exhibit improvement in power conversion efficiency, reproducibility and stability.
