    , Accepted 11th September 2019First published on 12th September 2019AbstractDue to the strong exciton binding energy (Eb) of organic materials, the energy offset between donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials is essential to promote charge generation in organic solar cells (OSCs). Yet an efficient exciton dissociation from non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) began to be observed in D/A blends even at very low driving force for hole transfer (ΔHh). The mechanism behind this efficient photoinduced hole transfer (PHT) remains unclear since current estimates from calculations of isolated molecules indicate that Eb > ΔHh. Here we rationalize these discrepancies using density functional theory (DFT), the total Gibbs free energy method and the extended Hückel theory (EHT). First, we employed DFT to calculate Eb for NFAs of three representative groups (perylene diimide derivatives, indacenodithiophene and subphthalocyanines) as well as for fullerene acceptors (FAs). Considering isolated molecules in the calculations, we verified that Eb for NFAs is lower than for FAs but still higher than the experimental ΔHh in which efficient PHT has been observed. Finding the molecular geometry of the excited state, we also obtain that the structural relaxation after photoexcitation tends to further decrease (increase) Eb for NFAs (FAs). This effect helps explain the delayed charge generation measured in some NFA systems. However, this effect is still not large enough for a significant decrease in Eb. We then applied EHT to quantify the decrease of Eb induced by energy levels coupling between stacked molecules in a model aggregate. We then estimated the number of stacked molecules so that Eb approaches ΔHh's. We found that small NFA aggregates, involving around 5 molecules, are already large enough to explain the experiments. Our results are justified by the low energy barrier to the generation of delocalized states in these systems (especially for the hole delocalization). Therefore, they indicate that molecular systems with certain characteristics can achieve efficient molecular orbital delocalization, which is a key factor to allow an efficient exciton dissociation in low-driving-force systems. These theoretical findings provide a sound explanation to very recent observations in OSCs.
1. Introduction
A typical bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) applied as an active layer in organic solar cells (OSCs) is usually formed by a p-type electron donor and a n-type electron acceptor material.1,2 In the last few decades most of the improved performance of OSCs was essentially focused on the development of new electron donor materials.3,4 There was much less discussion on the synthesis of new electron-accepting materials. In this period fullerene acceptors (FAs) were dominant, mainly due to their good charge transport properties and ultrafast electron transfer that ends up in an efficient exciton dissociation.5–8
However, some features of fullerenes impose intrinsic limitations to the further development of FA-based OSCs. FAs have a poor light absorption for wavelengths above 600 nm, which decreases their contribution to the photocurrent. As a consequence, those acceptors basically collect and transport electrons produced by the dissociation of excitons primarily generated along the donor phase.9 FA derivatives also have other disadvantages that limit the performance of the devices. For instance, it is known that FAs suffer from a photo-degradation mechanism associated with the formation of charge carrier traps under illumination.10–12 From the synthesis perspective, FAs are also difficult to functionalize resulting in high production costs.13
Only recently non-fullerene acceptor materials (NFAs) have become popular in photovoltaic devices14 and NFA-based OSCs are now constantly breaking efficiency records.15–17 The flexible molecular structure of these acceptors opened new design possibilities leading to improved photophysical features such as high absorption coefficient in the visible range, ultra-fast hole transfer,18,19 low charge recombination,20 high open circuit voltage (Voc)21,22 and good morphological stability23 resulting in more efficient devices.24 Moreover, those molecules have higher resistance to water vapor and thermal stress when compared to FAs.25
The performance of fullerene OSCs is based on the photoinduced electron transfer (PET), labeled as Channel I for photocurrent generation.26 On the other hand, the popularization of NFAs evidenced the concept of photoinduced hole transfer (PHT), Channel II for photocurrent generation,26,27 as a key phenomenon to influence the performance of OSCs. The considerable increase in device efficiency of NFA-based photovoltaics has been associated with an enhanced PHT mechanism.23 This encourages new concepts in the design of photoactive materials for OSCs, where the acceptor can be used as the primary low-bandgap light absorber, transferring holes to the donor with similar efficiency as the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor.
The growing use of NFAs has also added new insights into the fundamental physical-chemistry processes involved in the OSC performance. A remarkable feature of those materials is that light absorption in organic semiconductors does not produce free charges directly, but it creates a bound electron–hole pair known as an exciton.28 The pair can be formed with the electron and hole residing on the same molecular unit (a Frenkel exciton) or on different molecules (charge transfer exciton).29 The Coulomb interaction that stabilizes the exciton relative to the free charge carriers is known as the exciton binding energy (Eb), an additional energy necessary to generate free charge carriers. Due to the high dielectric constant of organic materials (approximately 3–5), Eb is much higher than the average thermal energy at room temperature, so the exciton dissociation requires the assistance of a driving force.30
The driving force for electron (hole) transfer is defined by the energy difference between the donor (acceptor) excited state and the charge transfer state.22 Because these energies are difficult to directly measure, the driving force for electron transfer (ΔHe) can be approximated as the difference between the electron affinity (EA) of the materials that form the D/A interface, ΔHe = EAD − EAA.26 By the same token, the driving force for hole transfer (ΔHh) can be approximated by the difference between the ionization potential (IP) of the materials that form the D/A interface, ΔHh = IPA − IPD. It has been observed that the driving force is important to push carriers away from the D/A interface increasing the probability of exciton dissociation.3 At the same time, the driving force can limit the OSC efficiency due to relatively large voltage losses31 (either through radiative or nonradiative recombination) in the charge transfer process and in the charge separation and extraction process.21,22,32,33
The quest for D/A systems with low driving forces and reasonable charge generation efficiencies is thus fundamental to further enhance the OSC performance.22 The possibility of a tailored design derived from the structural flexibility of NFAs makes them very promising candidates to those systems. In this context, low Eb materials34,35 are the primary choices since small exciton binding energies are related to an efficient charge generation without the voltage losses of high ΔH's. Therefore, a reliable quantification of Eb for organic materials used in OSCs is a key factor to qualitatively anticipate the device's performance.36,37 Many works have focused on studying the relationship between the low Eb of donor materials and efficient electron transfer to the acceptor.38,39 However there has been scarce discussion on ways to increase the photocurrent generation through efficient hole transfer to the donor produced by excitons generated in new acceptor materials with low Eb.26
At the moment, this discussion is vital since there is increasing experimental evidence that smaller Eb at the acceptor is linked to efficient PHT even in the presence of low ΔHh.40 For FA-based OSCs, the photocurrent produced by Channel II is suppressed with small ΔHh.41 Yet recent studies have begun to report OSCs with very low ΔHh and high efficiency when using NFA molecules in the active layer.27,42 The cause of this effect remains elusive,24 especially because the calculated values of Eb for the NFAs (although lower than the values calculated for the FAs) are still considerably larger than the experimental ΔHh.40
In order to shed some light on those issues and get further insights into the underlying mechanisms behind the efficient hole transfer from acceptor materials,20,43 we calculate the exciton binding energy for some prominent NFAs belonging to three major classes, indacenodithiophene, perylene diimide, and subphthalocyanines. For comparison, we also calculate Eb for two traditional fullerene derivatives. Firstly, we focus our study on the Frenkel excitons. In this point we have applied density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD-DFT) methods.44
As an initial procedure to study the Frenkel excitons, we have calculated Eb at the ground state (GS) geometry. However, if the exciton lifetime is long enough, the nuclear configuration might relax after the photon absorption so that the molecule can reach a new total energy minimum. The exciton dissociation would then happen at a relaxed nuclear configuration. Indeed recently polymer/NFA blends with low driving forces were found to have a very efficient but slow exciton dissociation45 (with a characteristic time around 15–30 ps compared to an equivalent time of sub-300 fs for polymer/FA blends).22 Hence, we have extended our analysis to calculate Eb for the optimized excited state geometry as well. We found that the nuclear relaxation tends to reduce the exciton binding energy of Frenkel excitons in the NFAs. Despite this decrease, the calculated Eb is still larger than the experimental ΔHh for those molecules. Curiously, in a remarkable contrast to the NFAs, the nuclear relaxation tends to increase Eb for the fullerene acceptors. This result may explain why the delayed charge generation mechanism is not observed in polymer/FA blends.
After characterizing Eb of the Frenkel excitons we then study the effects of the molecular orbital delocalization to further assist the exciton dissociation. The shift of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels induced by the electronic coupling between interacting molecules decreases the energy necessary to promote the exciton dissociation. As a simple way to estimate this process, we use the extended Hückel theory (EHT)46,47 to calculate the energy splittings of the Frontier orbitals associated with the molecular aggregates with a one-dimensional packing. The transfer and overlap integrals of the ETH formalism are found from a fragment orbital analysis of optimized molecular dimers. Following this approach, we are then able to estimate the number of stacked molecules necessary to decrease the exciton binding energy to values close to the measured ΔHh's. We can also anticipate the necessary conditions to promote an efficient hole transfer induced by electronic delocalization.
2. Materials
The non-fullerene materials considered in this work can be classified into three groups.43 For the indacenodithiophene (IDT) group we performed calculations for the ITIC,48ITIC-4F,16IT-M,49IT-DM,49IDIC50 and IDTBR.23 As a major characteristic, those acceptors have a fused acceptor–donor–acceptor structure (A–D–A) with four side groups near the center of the molecule,24 see Fig. 1. This molecular structure leads to a high internal charge transfer and strong absorption in the solar spectrum due to the low energy gap.51 Another important property of these NFAs is the high molecular rigidity that can increase the crystallinity of the film and lead to higher values of electron mobility.13,52 The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) for this group was obtained for ITIC-4F (13.5%) using the fluorinated-thienyl benzodithiophene (BDT-2F)-based donor polymer PM6 as a donor.53 The second group of NFAs considered in this work was the perylene diimide (PDI), for which we considered the molecules SF-PDI221 and hPDI3.18 The SF-PDI2 has a complex 3D structure due to the connection of two PDI units by carbon–carbon single bonds with a central aromatic group. This complex 3D structure hinders the formation of molecular aggregates with high crystallinity24 but provides a very low gap between LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals (an interesting feature for acceptor molecules).43 In the case of the hPDI3 molecule, three PDI units are fused in sequence, providing a high absorption coefficient and also better molecular packaging compared to SF-PDI2. Among the acceptor of this group the SF-PDI2 showed the highest PCE (9.5%) in a device using P3TEA as a donor layer.21 The third group of NFAs considered in this work was of the subphthalocyanines.54,55 For this group we calculate the properties of the SubPc and SubNc molecules that present a cone-like structure and have a high electric dipole moment.56 Between those two molecules, the best performance (PCE = 6.0%) was obtained with SubNc using α-6TP as a donor.56 The chemical structure of the NFAs simulated in this work can be seen in Fig. 1.

3. Computational methods
The first step was to optimize the ground state geometries of all molecules. For these we use the long-range corrected hybrid functional ωB97XD57 which includes empirical dispersion and minimizes the delocalization error.58 For the basis set we use 6-31G(d,p).58,59
To mimic the solid state these molecules were solvated by a medium of its own kind, by using the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM).60 The solvent in PCM calculation is defined by the dielectric constant, the number of solvent molecules per unit volume and the molecular radius. The dielectric constant (ε) was obtained by the Clausius–Mossotti equation:61 (1)where ρ, M, NA and α are the density of the material, molecular mass, Avogadro number and isotropic component of the molecular polarizability, respectively.62ρNA/M is the reciprocal of the molecular volume obtained from the neutral molecular geometry (tight option was taken in the calculation for better accuracy of molecular volume). The molecular radius is defined as the radius of a sphere which has equivalent volume of the considered molecule.36 We use the ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p) theory level for all these procedure.
The exciton binding energy in the gas phase or in a solid (with PCM) for a molecule can be estimated via DFT and TD-DFT by subtracting the fundamental energy gap (or band gap) from the optical gap (Eb = Efund − Eopt) calculated in the same molecular geometry.44,63Fig. 2 illustrates the energy levels for the molecular case. The optical gap can be obtained from TD-DFT and corresponds to the energy of the first optically allowed excited state. The fundamental gap is defined as the energy difference between the ionization potential (IP = Etotal(cation) − Etotal(neutral)) and electron affinity (EA = Etotal(neutral) − Etotal(anion)).44,64 To obtain Eopt, IP and EA we use the ground state (GS) geometry and dielectric constant obtained with ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p) and apply single point calculations with the M0665 functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set.66 We choose the M06 functional mainly for a better description of the optical gap energy compared with ωB97XD (see Fig. S1 in ESI†).67 Due to recent studies reporting slower (10 ps–1 ns)45 but efficient hole transfer in polymer/indacenodithiophene blends with low driving force,22 we also obtain the Eb values with the molecules in the geometry of the first excited state (ES, obtained with TD-DFT optimization with ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p)). The relative slowness of the dissociation process allows the molecule to pass into the ES geometry.68 These procedures for calculating Eb are the same as those implemented by us in a previous work.69 Besides this approach, we applied the total Gibbs free energy method, described in detail in ref. 67, to complement our estimates of molecular characteristic energies involved in the determination of Eb. The comparison between these two approaches will be presented in the next section.
 Fig. 2  Illustration of energy levels in the molecular case: Eopt represents the S1–S0 energy difference, where S0 denotes the (singlet) electronic ground state and S1 the lowest (singlet) excited state. The fundamental gap, Efund, corresponds to the IP − EA energy difference. The electron–hole pair binding energy, Eb, is given by Efund − Eopt. The driving force for hole transfer is the energy difference between the IP of the materials that form the D/A interface, ΔHh = IPA − IPD. 
We also calculate the intramolecular reorganization energy for electron transfer (λe) and hole transfer (λh).69 The intramolecular reorganization energy was estimated using the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the neutral and charged molecules.70 These calculations were done with the B3LYP71 functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set.72 The outer component of reorganization energy that accounts for the surrounding medium effect, λs, is neglected in some works as a first approximation for condensed-state systems.73–75 For a series of polyacenes λs was calculated to be very small compared to the internal component.76,77 Therefore, we will neglect the outer component of the reorganization energy.
The influence of the electronic delocalization to decrease the exciton binding energy was estimated by calculating the shift of the Frontier orbitals due to the electronic coupling. In order to calculate this variation, we have optimized the structure of two adjacent molecular dimers by considering one representative molecular pair of each group of acceptors defined in Section 2. Those calculations were performed using the wB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. Taking these optimized dimers, the values of the transfer (β) and overlap (S) integrals were obtained from a fragment orbital analysis69,78,79 as implemented in the molecular orbital analysis software AOMix.80,81 The values of β and S were then applied to the expression from the extended Hückel theory46,47 to obtain the energy splitting as a function of the number of molecules (see discussion in Section 4.2). All DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 1682 package.
It is worth mentioning that we chose the theory level which provides the best agreement between our outcomes with experimental data (when available) and/or other theoretical results reported in the literature.

With the PCM method and dielectric constant of Table 1 we calculate Eopt and vertical IP and EA for each acceptor molecule in the GS geometry, see Table 2. There is a reasonable agreement between theory and experiment with an average deviation of 0.09 and 0.17 eV for IP and Eopt energies, respectively. The agreement is lower for EA, with an average deviation of 0.76 eV. It was found that EA is very sensitive to the delocalization errors associated with the exchange–correlation functional.87,88 However a better agreement between the theoretical IP and EA with experimental values (mainly for the cases estimated from electrochemical measurements with cyclic voltammetry (CV) on a selected electrochemical workstation) can be obtained considering the full Gibbs free energy (see more details in a previous published work67). Those results are presented as ESI† (Fig. S2 and Table S1) where IP and EA are calculated considering the molecules in a solid-like state and also in dichloromethane solvent. The results in the ESI† show a better correlation with the experimental values relative to the vertical energies reported in Table 2. The squared correlation coefficient (Rsq) obtained from linear fittings of the vertical IP and EA with experimental results are 0.76 and 0.37, respectively. These Rsq's are around 0.06 smaller compared to the values calculated considering the full Gibbs energy (the quality of the linear regression to reproduce the data improves as Rsq approaches 1, see Table S1, ESI†). These results evidence the contribution of entropic effects to determine the molecular redox potentials. They also raise the key question of how those contributions can influence the exciton binding energy, a topic that is beyond the scope of the present work. Since the answer to this question is unclear, here we opted to use the conventional procedure that applies only the vertical energies to determine Eb.

Therefore, by using the results of Table 2, we calculate the exciton binding energy for NFA and FA molecules, shown in Fig. 3. A key aspect of this figure is the considerably lower Eb for NFAs when compared to FAs. One parameter that may contribute to reduce the exciton binding energy in the NFAs is the higher dielectric constant of those materials relative to the fullerenes (as can be verified in Table 1). In order to clarify the influence of ε and other physical-chemistry parameters in Eb, Fig. S3 (ESI†) compares the exciton binding energy calculated in the gas phase (Evacb in Table S2, ESI†) with the values obtained using the PCM method. In this figure we also plot Evacb/ε, where the magnitude of the dielectric constant for each material was taken from Table 1. The predominant role of the dielectric constant to decrease Eb is evidenced by the convergence between the exciton binding energies calculated with the PCM method with the simple curve Evacb/ε.
 Fig. 3  The binding energy of Frenkel excitons for FAs and NFAs in the ground state (GS) and excited state (ES) geometry calculated with the PCM method. 
Therefore, even in the gas phase most of the NFAs have Evacb lower than the FAs. This indicates that the other effects, besides the dielectric constant, can influence Eb, for instance, structural differences between molecules24,43,96 (see discussion below). One example of how intrinsic properties can influence Eb is the SubNc. This molecule has Evacb comparable to the FAs due to their small size relative to the other NFAs (the confinement of the electron–hole pair tends to increase the potential energy between them). Yet the SubNc have the highest dielectric constants among the NFAs so the polarization effects in the solid state decrease the exciton binding energy to lower values relative to other NFAs.

Fig. 3 also shows Eb calculated using the optimized geometry of the excited state (ES) (details in Table S3, ESI†). Comparing the values of Eb for the ES geometry, the nuclear relaxation after excitation tends to decrease Eb of the NFAs whereas it has the opposite trend for the fullerenes. Considering the indacenodithiophene, perylene diimide and subphthalocyanines groups, the average decrease in Eb is 0.05, 0.03 and 0.04 eV, respectively. In contrast, Eb increases by an average amount of 0.05 eV after relaxation in the FAs.
The decrease in Eb of the ES geometry is explained by the simultaneous reduction of Efund and Eopt (see Fig. S4a and b, ESI†). The relative variations of these two energies determines the change in the exciton binding energy since Eb = Efund − Eopt. The decrease in Efund (ΔEfund) is higher compared to the decrease in Eopt (ΔEopt) for the FAs but the opposite happens to the NFAs (see Fig. S4c, ESI†). The reduction in the characteristic energies is due to the higher planarity induced by the quinoid character of the molecule's chain in the excited state.68 Calculations developed for different polythiophene derivatives also indicated that the fundamental gap strongly decreases with an increasing quinoid character of the polymeric structure.97
Our results suggest then that the hole transfer delay observed in polymer/indacenodithiophene blends with low driving force45 might be related to the reduction of Eb in the acceptor induced by nuclear relaxation. The excitons which do not fast dissociate just after the electronic excitation may find a second dissociation channel by a relaxation process. The phonon emission associated with this structural reorganization would then produce a delayed hole transfer that can extend from the picosecond to the nanosecond time scale. This kind of delayed charge generation mechanism would be inhibited in fullerene acceptors since Eb increases with the relaxation. As a consequence the hole transfer in polymers/FAs blends would be restricted to an ultrafast time scale (sub-300 fs)22 as it was verified experimentally.

Fig. 4 shows one characteristic of the fullerenes that may explain their higher exciton energies. One can see from this figure that the Frontier molecular orbitals HOMO and LUMO are almost evenly distributed along the whole molecular structure. After light excitation, there is then a high overlap between electron and hole wavefunctions which tends to increase the exciton binding energy.
 Fig. 4  Frontier molecular orbitals for FAs and NFAs (isovalues 0.02). 
In contrast to the fullerenes, the NFAs belonging to the indacenodithiophene group have the Frontier molecular orbitals concentrated in different regions of the molecules, as can be verified in Fig. 4. The HOMO is more localized in the center of the molecules whereas the LUMO is more localized in the extremities (repair in the LUMO of IDTBR). This effect is related to fact that the molecules of this group have a high internal charge transfer (ICT) character, which induces a smaller overlap between the electron–hole pair. Although the indacenodithiophene molecules have an almost vanishing dipole moment due to their high symmetry, they have a high internal charge transfer along the molecular structure. The manipulation of the ICT by employing different combinations of electron-rich and electron-deficient units98 along the backbone has been widely used to tailor the absorption coefficient99 of new materials for photovoltaic applications. The occurrence of ICT can be further verified with the help of the half molecular models96 (see Fig. S5, ESI†) into the calculation. The results show a stronger dipole moment from the electron-rich core unit to the electron-deficient unit, which could be associated with a high ICT character.96,100

Fig. 4 also shows the spatial distribution of the Frontier molecular orbitals for the perylene diimide as well as the subphthalocyanine derivatives. Again, in the case of SF-PDI2 and hPDI3 the electric dipole moment is very small due to the symmetry of those molecules. Also, there is a small ICT character for the molecules of the perylene diimide group resulting in a similar delocalization of the HOMO and LUMO. This delocalization is favored by the rigid and planar conjugated backbone.101 Despite the spatial overlap of the HOMO and LUMO for SubPc and SubNc, the high electronic dipole moment24,102 (see Fig. S6, ESI†) and the high dielectric constant (see discussion above) reduce Eb to values considerably lower compared to the fullerenes.
4.2 Effects of electronic state delocalization
The binding energies of Frenkel excitons for NFAs in GS and ES geometries are still larger than the experimental ΔHh in systems where a high efficiency of exciton dissociation was obtained. Hence an additional effect must play a role to further reduce Eb. As mentioned in the Introduction, intermolecular interactions in the solid state may delocalize the electronic states among adjacent molecules. The energy splitting of the Frontier orbitals associated with these interactions can then further reduce Eb.103,104 In this section we will explore this hypothesis for aggregates of NFA and FA molecules.
Let us first focus on the fullerenes. The spherical symmetry of the FAs induces a 3-fold degenerate LUMO,105 and favors the electronic coupling106 and the local crystallinity.107 All those features tend to induce a high delocalization of the LUMO108 state, which is an important factor for charge generation.109 This effect, together with the generally high ΔHe of the donor/FA interface derived from the high EA of the FAs, is usually invoked to explain the efficient electron transfer in those systems.110 However, with respect to hole transfer in FA-based OSCs, a suppression is verified with diminished ΔHh.41
In contrast, the NFAs have a lower molecular organization than FAs but efficient hole transfer has been reported in systems with hPDI3,18IDIC,19IT-M,19IDTBR23 and others.17,26 In addition, donor/NFA blends with low driving forces for hole transfer but high efficiency for exciton dissociation are beginning to be reported.27,42,111,112 For instance, the heterojunction formed by the PM6 polymer and the ITIC-4F molecule has exhibited a very efficient hole transfer despite the low driving force of 0.19 eV. Consequently, the solar cell based on this system reached a power conversion efficiency of 13.5%.53 However, the physical mechanisms behind the efficient charge separation in this heterojunction remain unclear.24
Exciton delocalization is one possible mechanism to explain these results since the calculations of Eb in Section 4.1 take into account only one molecule, i.e., the binding energy of the Frenkel exciton.113 The concept of electron–hole pair delocalization from the Onsager description is frequently used to justify the efficient exciton dissociation.114 The decrease of the exciton binding energy with increasing electron–hole distance for the NFAs and the FAs (as calculated following the Onsager picture)115 can be seen in Fig. S7 and Table S4 (ESI†). The initial electron–hole radius, ri, is larger and the Coulomb capture radius, rc, is smaller for the NFAs than for the FAs. This result would indicate that the exciton dissociation is facilitated in non-fullerene acceptors. However, we believe that the difference rc − ri for the ITIC-4F (for instance) is not significantly lower than the difference for the fullerenes to justify the experimental results mentioned above. In addition, many features of the electron transfer event and charge generation observed in organic donor/acceptor heterojunctions are inconsistent with the Onsager mechanism.108 Hence another physical process must influence the charge dissociation in those systems.
One of those mechanisms might be related to electronic state delocalization. For instance, ref. 109 suggests that the molecular organization can induce a large density of delocalized charge separated states. When the exciton has enough energy to access those states, the resonant coupling between them can drive ultrafast charge separation.116,117 In this picture, molecular organization (anisotropic dependence) and intermolecular electronic coupling are essential for an efficient dissociation.118
Here we will explore those ideas using the fact that intermolecular electronic coupling promotes the energy splitting of the Frontier orbitals (and eventually the formation of energy bands).113 As a simple way to estimate the reduction of Eb calculated for one molecule, we quantify the decrease in the fundamental gap with molecular packing associated with this splitting. For this purpose, we use the extended Hückel theory (EHT)46,47 for a one-dimensional packing to estimate the variation in the energy of the Frontier orbitals with increasing number of molecules in aggregates of NFAs and FAs. In this model, the same value of electronic coupling is considered for all the adjacent molecules. Following this approach, the energy of the kth intermolecular level for a linear aggregate of n molecules is:119,120 (2)where α is the site energy integral, β is the transfer integral and S is the overlap integral. The site energy is approximately the one molecule energy if there is not much overlap of levels (orbitals) in neighboring molecules (under this approximation the dimer Hamiltonian is approximated to be the one molecule Hamiltonian).119 In this way, the energy splitting does not depend on the site energy integrals so that the values of α can be obtained using the Koopmans’ relation.44 Hence the variation of the HOMO is calculated taking α = EHOMO = −IP and using the respective electronic coupling between HOMOs, βh, and overlap integral, Sh. By the same token, the variations of the LUMO are calculated taking α = ELUMO = −EA, and the respective electronic coupling between LUMOs, βe, and overlap integral, Se (from this point on the subscripts h and e are associated to the quantities related to the holes and electrons, respectively). The values of IP and EA for the isolated molecules have already been obtained and are shown in Table 2. The values of βh/e and Sh/e will be obtained from a fragment orbital analysis69,78,79 from DFT calculation of molecular dimers. Therefore, in this model, the electronic coupling and the respective overlap integral define the level splitting, and consequently the gap (EHOMO − ELUMO). When n is infinitely large, the difference between the energy levels k and k + 1 is infinitely small so that there will be a band of electronic states with width (4β − 4Sα)/(1 − 4S2)119 (Fig. S8, ESI† shows a diagram representing the energy band formation according to the EHT for S = 0 (symmetric energy bands)).
Thus, the splitting in EHOMO or ELUMO for a number of n coupled molecules can be expressed as: δkh/e = EHOMO/LUMO − Ek,HOMO/LUMO,(3)where the highest values of δh/e are obtained when the signals of Sh/e and βh/e in eqn (2) are equal (we exemplify in Fig. S9 the splitting in EHOMO and ELUMO considering Sh/e = ±10 meV and βh/e = ±50 meV, ESI†). Fig. 5 illustrates the decrease of the energy necessary to generate a free hole in the HOMO and a free electron in the LUMO induced by a one-dimensional stack of many coupled molecules.
 Fig. 5  A schematic diagram of exciton binding energy decrease with the coupling of the molecules. 
Following this picture, the exciton binding energy then becomes: Eb(n) = Efund − Eopt − (|δe(n)| + |δh(n)|).(4)
As discussed above, βh/e and Sh/e are found from DFT calculations of optimized molecular dimers. Since the DFT optimization of dimers is computationally costly, especially for large molecules, we will consider only one molecule as representative of each group of acceptors studied here. Hence, we opted to simulate dimers of PC61BM, ITIC-4F, hPDI3 and SubNc. The spherical structure of PC61BM increases the number of possible orientations between two fullerenes with considerable electronic coupling.121 This motivated us to perform the geometry optimization of three PC61BM dimers with different interaction positions. For the NFAs (that have a lower molecular symmetry) we considered only the face-on orientation.

Fig. 6 shows optimized structures of the dimers as obtained at the ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p) theory level and the respective spatial distribution of the Frontier orbitals. For most of the dimers, the HOMO and LUMO are delocalized along the two molecules. The values of βh/e and Sh/e for each dimer are shown in Table 3. For the fullerenes, the β's are in the same range and also have a strong influence on the interacting position as obtained in other works.75,106 We highlight here that our results for the electronic coupling of ITIC-4F and SubNc are in accordance with recent results obtained for indacenodithiophene molecules122 and phthalocyanines.123

Given the values of βh/e and Sh/e from Table 3 and eqn (3), δh(e) can be found as a function of n. These results are shown in Fig. 7. In the case of NFAs, considering one-dimensional packing, a single molecule interacts only with two neighboring molecules. Yet molecular packing can occur in 3 dimensions for the FAs,121i.e., a single molecule of PC61BM can interact with at least six other neighboring molecules due to its spherical symmetry. As a consequence, the shift in the levels of the PC61BM are calculated assuming a simple cubic lattice so that the electronic couplings β derived from the DFT calculations are multiplied by a factor 3 in eqn (2).124 In addition, since we considered three different configurations of PC61BM dimers, the splittings for this molecule in Fig. 7 are average values of δh/e taken over the three configurations considered here (in Fig. S10 we show the δh/e for each dimer of PC61BM, ESI†).
 Fig. 7  (a) δh and (b) δe as a function of the number of coupled molecules, obtained with the extended Hückel theory. The results of PC61BM are the average among the three different configurations of dimers shown in Fig. 6. 
Using the results of Fig. 7 as Eb(1), i.e., the binding energy of Frenkel excitons calculated with the PCM method for molecules in GS geometry, we can obtain Eb(n) as a function of the number of coupled molecules. The results are presented in Fig. 8 (again the PC61BM results are an average between the three dimers of Fig. 6, details for each dimer in Fig. S11, ESI†). In Fig. S12 (ESI†) it can be seen that the results of Eb(n) using Evacb/ε as Eb(1). First, as a general analysis of Eb(n), it is interesting to note that the difference of the exciton binding energy for one molecule and assuming an infinite number of molecules (Eb(1) − Eb(∞)) is 0.25, 0.21, 0.12 and 0.16 eV for PC61BM, ITIC-4F, hPDI3 and SubNc, respectively. The decrease of Eb(n) is more pronounced for PC61BM due to special morphological features of this molecule that tends to form aggregates with a 3D structure. The largest rate of Eb(n) decrease is found in aggregates with a small number of molecules: approximately 50% of the Eb variation in the interval 1 < n < ∞ occurs until n = 2 whereas approximately 90% of this variation occurs until n = 5 (for this analysis we consider the average among the all results). This shows that even small regions with high molecular organization and high electronic coupling can induce a considerable decrease of Eb. Therefore, the results of Eb(n) highlight the importance of molecular organization and electronic coupling for the decrease of the exciton binding energy.

It is known that the molecular organization in thin films strongly depends on specific characteristics of the molecule and also on the experimental procedures followed to produce the blend (like donor/acceptor ratios, amount of solvent additive and annealing temperature).1,125 As mentioned earlier, the spherical symmetry of FAs favors a local crystallinity and also facilitates the formation of a well-ordered morphology near the donor/FA interface.126 However, the work of Chen et al.19 clearly demonstrated that it is possible to obtain a well-intermixed microstructure with nanoscale phase separation between the polymer donor and NFAs, both with high crystallinity. This careful optimization of the blend morphology is fundamental to improve the efficiency of exciton dissociation. Therefore, we perform a careful analysis of the results in Fig. 8 by considering the specific features of each acceptor separately and then relate those outcomes with recent works in the literature.
(i) SubNc. Reports in the literature indicated that the cone-like structure of this molecule facilitates the one-dimensional packing.91,127 Photoemission spectroscopy studies55 of SubNc films obtained an exciton binding energy of ∼0.20 eV while we estimated Eb(5) = 0.26 eV and Eb(∞) = 0.24 eV for this material. The fair agreement between our theoretical results from the EHT model and the experimental results indicates that the electronic delocalization produced by a one-dimensional packing can indeed play a major role to reduce the exciton binding energy of the Frenkel excitons in the solid state.
(ii) ITIC-4F. It was observed that this acceptor tends to form thin films with high molecular organization,16 a characteristic that was also observed in other acceptors of the indacenodithiophene group.45 From Fig. 8 we obtain Eb(5) = 0.29 eV and Eb(∞) = 0.26 eV for ITIC-4F. As far as we know there is not a direct measurement of the exciton binding energy in ITIC-4F films. Yet our results are higher than the driving force of 0.19 eV (estimated from cyclic voltammetry, CV) necessary for an efficient hole transfer between this acceptor and the PM6 polymer, which led to a solar cell power conversion efficiency of 13.5%.53 However, some studies called attention to the fact that the CV technique tends to underestimate the magnitude of the driving force when compared to more sophisticated techniques.45,55 These results suggest that molecular organization and electronic coupling can be one additional effect to help the efficient hole transfer in polymer/ITIC-4F systems with low driving force.128
(iii) hPDI3. Thin films of this acceptor were found to have low molecular organization.18 Therefore, one would not expect a considerable decrease of Eb for hPDI3 induced by electronic delocalization in the solid state. This explains why no efficient hole transfer was measured in polymer/hPDI3 systems with very low driving force (which is in clear contrast to the results obtained for the indacenodithiophene molecules111). Thus, the results of Fig. 8 for hPDI3 should be interpreted with caution since they are derived under the hypothesis that the hPDI3 molecules are able to form linear aggregates, which was not observed experimentally yet.
(iv) PC61BM. Even considering the 3D structure in the energy calculations for fullerene aggregates, in the average of the three simulated dimers we found Eb(5) = 0.88 and Eb(∞) = 0.84 eV. Those values are very high compared to exciton binding energy for aggregates of NFAs with the same number of molecules. The strong electron–hole bound in those materials may explain why there is not an efficient hole transfer to the donor in polymer/FA systems with low driving forces.40,41 On the other hand, there are reports of efficient exciton dissociation by hole transfer when the polymer/FA system has a high driving force.129,130 For example, Zhang et al. reported a polymer/PC61BM system where approximately 30% of the total photocurrent is generated from excitons in the acceptor.131 Using spectroscopy techniques, the authors verified that ΔHh in this system was approximately 0.75 eV. Since it is well known that fullerene aggregates are common in polymer/FA blends and considering that Eb(1) ∼ 1.1 eV for PC61BM, those experimental results suggest that electronic delocalization in fullerene aggregates may indeed play an important role to induce the hole transfer132 (in a similar way to the result obtained in Fig. 8 for the NFAs). However, the transfer for FAs requires blends with a high driving force. Finally, we would like to point out that the spherical symmetry of PC61BM induces several forms of molecular organization (which can even include an hexagonal arrangement).106 Those packing structures may promote a considerable narrowing of the band gap calculated by the EHT method due to the higher coordination number of fullerene molecules in the lattice. The Eb(n) in those kinds of fullerene aggregates can then have a lower value compared to the ones in Fig. 8. In polymer/FA systems, it is well known that the process of fast electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor strongly requires the presence of pure fullerene aggregates.108,133,134
4.3 Impacts of intramolecular vibrations
Here we briefly discuss the effects on the energy level delocalization produced by molecular vibrations coupled to electronic excitations. This analysis is necessary since it is known that the formation of the energy bands can be impaired when the intramolecular reorganization energy (λh/e) is higher compared to βh/e.116 If this condition is not fulfilled for each molecule studied above, the further decrease of the exciton binding energy in the solid state could not be attributed to electronic delocalization (as assumed in the previous section).
Hence, we calculated λh/e, for the PC61BM, ITIC-4F, hPDI3 and SubNc acceptors (Table 4). For a vanishing driving force (self-exchange reaction) between molecules of the same type, the influence of λh/e on the electronic delocalization can be estimated using the energy barrier for charge transfer (hole or electron), given by:135 (5)

Eqn (5) comes from Landau–Zener's semiclassical theory, which considers the harmonic approximation to describe the process of charge transfer from an initial state a to a final state b, see ref. 79 and 136. In the harmonic approximation, the initial and final states are represented by two parabolas describing the variation of the free energy as a function of the nuclear degrees of freedom. The first and second terms of eqn (5) represent the adiabatic correction to the energy barrier. If λh/e ≫ βh/e, the energy barrier tends to λh/e/4, i.e., the non-adiabatic limit. Note that eqn (5) is valid for both the non-adiabatic and adiabatic limits and any intermediate regime as well.75,106 When βh/e = λh/e/2 in eqn (5), the energy barrier goes to zero (ΔG†h/e = 0) which can be interpreted as a total electronic delocalization between the adjacent molecules a and b.
For all the cases presented in Table 4, ΔG†e is lower than the average thermal energy at room temperature (∼0.025 eV). This result indicates that the electronic coupling between the LUMOs of adjacent molecules (LUMO delocalization) is not influenced by the respective intramolecular reorganization energy (λe). Recently it was also found that ΔG†e is lower than the average thermal energy at room temperature for pentacene, rubrene and C60.75 Considering now ΔG†h, all NFAs have an energy barrier for hole transfer considerably lower than kBT. Due to the low value of βh and high value of λh, only PC61BM has ΔG†h > kBT. In this case the HOMO's coupling between adjacent PC61BM molecules (HOMO delocalization) is strongly affected by the respective intramolecular reorganization energy (λh). Therefore, only for PC61BM one would expect a higher localization of the HOMO in a single molecule (induced by intramolecular vibrations) which affects the band formation. This additional disadvantage of PC61BM, together with the higher values of Eb, might be the reasons behind the inefficient hole transfer from the FAs for low ΔHh of the donor/acceptor heterojunctions.
A further analysis should be done at this point. In ref. 138 the authors compared the values of λ for olygoacenes and found that the estimates using tuned range-separated functionals is around 30% larger than the estimates with B3LYP that tends to overdelocalize wave functions.139,140 Hence we perform a stress test and increase all the values of λh/e in Table 4 by 30%. We found that all resulting ΔG†h/e (except the high ΔG†h previously obtained for PC61BM) are still lower than kBT which clearly demonstrates the soundness of our arguments.
5. Conclusion
We theoretically investigated the reasons behind the phenomena of hole transfer from FAs and NFAs. We focused our analysis on the differences of the exciton binding energy and intermolecular electronic coupling between those kinds of acceptors. First, we have seen that the binding energy of the Frenkel excitons (as determined using DFT and TD-DFT calculations) is much lower for NFAs than for FAs. We relate those results to the different molecular structures and variations in the dielectric constant. Despite the lower values of Eb for Frenkel excitons in NFAs, the results could not explain the efficient hole transfer observed in polymer/NFA systems with low driving forces. This motivated us to study the contribution of intermolecular effects to promote this process. Using a hybrid approach that involves DFT calculations and the extended Hückel formalism, we quantified the decrease of the band gap associated with the molecular packing in aggregates of acceptor molecules. We show that the energy shifts of the Frontier orbitals associated with intermolecular interaction in molecular aggregates can further reduce the exciton binding energy to values compatible with the experimental driving forces.
Our results suggest three conditions to promote an efficient hole transfer induced by electronic delocalization: (i) high intermolecular electronic coupling; (ii) tendency to form molecular aggregates and (iii) lower intramolecular reorganization energy. Those conditions are fundamental to increase electron delocalization through the formation of energy bands. These conclusions are in agreement with recent experimental studies in the literature.141 For example, Friend et al.103 demonstrated that materials with structural rigidity and suppressed torsion relaxation will result in more delocalized charge wave functions and this will allow efficient charge separation with minimal driving force. Also, Kahle et al.142 show that the exciton dissociation efficiency is directly coupled to an enhancement of molecular organization and is particularly prominent for crystalline domains.
Finally, our results provide a sound explanation to very recent observations, with new indacenodithiophene molecules, which indicates an efficient hole transfer and high solar cell power conversion efficiency in D/A blends with near zero driving force for charge separation.111

 	Fig. 2  Illustration of energy levels in the molecular case: Eopt represents the S1–S0 energy difference, where S0 denotes the (singlet) electronic ground state and S1 the lowest (singlet) excited state. The fundamental gap, Efund, corresponds to the IP − EA energy difference. The electron–hole pair binding energy, Eb, is given by Efund − Eopt. The driving force for hole transfer is the energy difference between the IP of the materials that form the D/A interface, ΔHh = IPA − IPD.
