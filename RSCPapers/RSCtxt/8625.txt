    , Accepted 28th May 2020First published on 28th May 2020AbstractSolar fuels could solve one of the most pressing energy-related issues of the present time: the switch to a renewable energy base in the transportation sector. Especially aviation and heavy-duty transport will mostly rely on liquid fuels, which makes solar fuels an enabling technology for future mobility. Here, an analysis of the solar thermochemical fuel pathway that converts CO2 and H2O into liquid “drop-in”-capable fuels is presented, taking into account its life-cycle, economic, environmental and social performance. For a baseline plant layout in Morocco, nominal production costs of 1.97 € per litre of jet fuel are estimated, with greenhouse gas emission savings of 80% with respect to conventional fuel. Social concerns such as child labour or forced labour arise mostly through the import of materials and components from other developing countries. Alternative production locations are analysed, finding that in Chile – the country with the highest solar irradiation – nominal production costs of 1.72 € per L could be attained at an improved environmental life-cycle performance but at a higher risk of permitting child labour. The potential use of fossil CO2 (instead of CO2 directly captured from the air) is discussed and it is found that it cannot be used for the production of solar fuels with significantly lower emissions than conventional fuels. Regarding the potential use of grid electricity (instead of on-site concentrated solar power), the specific carbon intensity should be lower than 0.15 kg CO2 eq. per kW h to meet the EU RED II targets. Overall, the solar thermochemical fuel pathway using both renewable energy and CO2 has the potential to supply sustainable fuels to aviation in principally unlimited amounts.
Introduction
Climate change is a global risk that needs to be contained by avoiding the emissions of greenhouse gases1 in industry, electrical power generation, residential heating, and the transportation sector. While for light-duty road transport, electrification or the use of hydrogen in fuel cells represents a viable solution, for the aviation sector neither option is seen to have the potential for complete penetration.2 This is primarily due to the demanding requirements of high energy and power density of the energy carrier in an aircraft, which still make liquid hydrocarbons the most suitable option today from a technical point of view. Electric flying suffers from substantial range limitations given the foreseeable development of specific energy density of battery technology.3,4 The use of hydrogen in either fuel cells or in combustion engines has been the subject of several research projects that have come to diverging conclusions regarding the relative energy demand with respect to conventional fuel.5–7 In any case, the storage of hydrogen on board requires the re-design of the aircraft because of its larger volume compared to jet fuel, just as the upstream processes for production and delivery to the airport likewise require an adjustment. Furthermore, the overhaul of the fleet with a non-drop-in solution is comparably slow and requires the decommissioning of existing aircraft, which may be operable for several decades.
Consequently, to have a swift and large-scale effect on the emissions from the aviation sector, alternative fuels are required. Among the different drop-in alternative fuel production pathways, there are photochemical, electrochemical and thermochemical routes. The conversion of biomass to liquid fuels has the potential to supply large amounts of aviation fuels.8 However, there may be challenges related to competing land use, water demand or scalability of the conversion infrastructure. The power-to-liquid (PtL) pathway, which produces liquid fuels by converting hydrogen (from electrolysis) and CO2, has received attention due to its potential widespread availability through cheap renewable electricity, and its scalability. The solar thermochemical route (StL; Fig. 1) uses concentrated solar energy to drive a redox cycle of e.g. cerium oxide to split water and CO2 into a gas mixture, which is then converted into liquid fuels via the Fischer–Tropsch process. Both PtL and StL pathways have in common their scalability to principally unlimited amounts, the use of non-fossil non-biomass resources, and their operability on barren non-arable land. The following analysis focuses on the StL pathway, which has the potential to achieve higher energy conversion efficiencies.9 The study quantifies in a unified framework the production costs, the environmental and the social impacts of this fuel production pathway and represents thus a novel approach in the assessment of fuel production pathways.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the solar thermochemical fuel production pathway. 
The solar thermochemical pathway
Water and carbon dioxide are captured on-site from the air e.g. via chemical adsorption to an amine-functionalised solid sorbent10 and stored. Both are then split in thermochemical reactors that operate redox cycles at temperatures of 1000–1900 K driven by concentrated solar energy. For the concentration of solar energy, either a field of heliostats focusing on a tower or an array of dishes can be used. The resulting synthesis gas, a mixture of mainly H2 and CO, is then converted into liquid fuels with the Fischer–Tropsch process. This jet fuel is a drop-in fuel that is permitted11 for use in blends with conventional jet fuel with shares of up to 50%. Most of the process steps are already operated on an industrial scale such as the concentration of sunlight, gas handling, or the gas-to-liquid conversion. The capture of CO2 from air is currently in the stage of demonstration and early commercialisation12 with the aim of achieving a cost of 100 $ per t of CO2 captured. The largest developments are expected for the thermochemical reactors, which have already enhanced their efficiency significantly from below 1% (ref. 13) to above 5% (ref. 9) recently, whereas theoretical efficiencies exceed 50%.25 Among the concepts presented in the literature are continuously operating reactors with heat recovery working with particles,14–17 with rotating or reciprocating materials,18–20 with static membranes,21,22 and isothermal operation,23,24 whereat ceria is frequently used as the reactive material. It is also sought to improve the material by doping25–28 or to find new enhanced materials such as perovskites.29–31
In the literature, the solar thermochemical pathway has been analysed with respect to its economic32–37 and environmental performance,37,38 whereas only one study analyses both.37 In contrast to the analysis in Falter et al.,37 the system analysed here uses vacuum pumping instead of inert gas operation of the solar reactors and the light hydrocarbon fraction from the FT synthesis is reformed into syngas and fed back into the system instead of being combusted in a combined heat and power facility. Furthermore, the solar reactor is modelled with a dedicated simulation to investigate the influences of operation conditions on the energy balance. To the best of the knowledge of the authors, the social implications of this pathway have not been thoroughly assessed so far.
It is the aim of this study to perform an integrated assessment of the solar thermochemical fuel pathway including techno-economic analysis (TEA), as well as environmental and social life cycle assessment. Levelised costs of energy (LCOE) are used to determine the production costs of one litre of jet fuel, and an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to quantify the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The social life cycle impacts are quantified following a methodological approach that takes into account the guidelines for social life cycle assessment (SLCA) defined by UNEP and SETAC.39
For the analysis, a baseline case of the pathway is defined for a plant with a capacity of 1054 barrels per day (bpd) of jet fuel and 888 bpd of naphtha. The heat and electricity demands are covered by concentrated solar energy from separate tower plants on-site. An arid and sunny location in Morocco is chosen for the plant with a level of annual direct normal irradiation of 2500 kW h per (m2 year) and a distance to the sea of 250 km. Water and carbon dioxide are captured onsite from the air, via chemical adsorption to an amine-functionalised solid sorbent in dedicated units with a size of 135 kg CO2 per day.10,12 The total required amount of CO2 is 0.81 kt per day and that of H2O is 1.9 million L per day. The CO2 is then compressed and stored in an above-ground storage vessel at elevated pressure, while the H2O is stored in a water tank. Both are then supplied to an array of thermochemical reactors, which are cyclically heated to an upper temperature of 1900 K at decreased oxygen partial pressure, at which ceria is reduced. The material is then cooled down to 1000 K and H2O and/or CO2 are injected at atmospheric pressure into the reactor, which are then split into H2 and/or CO and O2. For the decrease of the oxygen partial pressure during reduction, vacuum pumps remove the evolving oxygen from the chamber and keep the reactors at an optimised pressure, which is found as a trade-off between energy penalty for vacuum pumping and enhanced productivity of the thermochemical cycle towards lower pressures. At 1.1 kPa, the techno-economic optimum is reached. The thermochemical energy conversion efficiency of syngas production is then 19.0% excluding the energy required for vacuum pumping and gas separation, and 15.1% including vacuum pumping. The CO2, which is not converted in the reactors, is captured with a dedicated monoethanolamine (MEA) cycle and reused in the thermochemical reactor. The concentrated solar radiation is supplied by a field of heliostats, which focus on the top of the towers. The aperture size of the solar field is 8.6 million m2 at a concentration ratio of 51.6%.40 The produced syngas, consisting of H2 and CO, is then stored in separate above-ground gas tanks at elevated pressure. Storage of syngas allows for a buffer between thermochemical production and its conversion in a Fischer–Tropsch facility downstream, which enables the economic operation of the latter during day and night. According to the desired output of products, the FT synthesis is performed at a comparably low temperature of about 200 °C and a pressure of 25 bar with a cobalt-based catalyst. From the FT conversion, a gaseous, a liquid, and a waxy fraction are produced which are then further processed into the final products in a separate refinement step. By hydrocracking the long-chained hydrocarbons to a smaller length and subsequent distillation, products in the jet fuel and naphtha range are received. As a by-product, gaseous hydrocarbons are converted back into syngas through steam reforming, which is operated with solar heat. Due to the several heat sources and sinks in the process at different temperatures, a dedicated heat integration would be beneficial once the plant layout is known in detail.41 Here, we limit the study to the integration of heat between the exothermal FT unit and the CO2 capture with MEA. The finished products are then sent to a harbour at a distance of 250 km from the fuel production plant via pipeline. From the harbour, they are moved by ship over 1000 km to their final destination (in this case, Europe).
The energy and mass balances used in the assessment are shown in Fig. 2. For the solar stand-alone plant, a total of 1.36 GJ per output (1.00 L jet fuel + 0.84 L naphtha) enters the system boundary, which is then converted into heat by concentration and absorption (at an efficiency of 51.6% (ref. 40)) and into electricity by concentrated solar power (with an efficiency of 20%, CSP). Overall, most of the energy is required for the operation of the thermochemical reactors, with high-temperature heat representing the major input. A dedicated computational model based on the work in Falter et al.42 is used for the calculation of the reactor efficiency and thus the derivation of the energy balance, which is then used in the model of the whole plant (see Table S1 in ESI† for further details). The second largest energy demand occurs for the operation of the vacuum pumps, which require low-temperature heat of about 100 °C as an input. Jet vacuum pumps are chosen here because of the possibility to operate on waste heat, which may be readily available from other process steps. In a preceding publication,37 the vacuum pumps were considered as mechanical pumps requiring electrical energy. The use of jet vacuum pumps here significantly increases the demand of heat but reduces the demand for electricity. Due to their favourable economics compared to mechanical pumps,43 the production costs can be reduced, even though their efficiencies are significantly lower. The third largest input is the capture of CO2 and H2O from the air. The storage of CO2 and syngas requires electrical energy for the operation of the compressors. An Aspen model is used to simulate the energy and mass balances of the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, hydrocracking, steam reforming, and CO2 capture with monoethanolamine (see ESI† for further details). The gaseous fraction of hydrocarbons is steam reformed into syngas and reused in the FT synthesis. The waste heat from FT, hydrocracking and reforming provides the heat required for CO2 capture with MEA. Further integration of the plant components in terms of heat recuperation is not assumed.

Methodology
In the following, the chosen approach for the TEA, the LCA and the SLCA of the StL system is presented.
TEA
For the derivation of production costs of solar thermochemical fuel, the LCOE method is chosen,44 which sums all costs over the plant lifetime taking into account the time value of money. From this total life-cycle cost (TLCC), an equivalent cost per year is derived with the annuity method, and finally the costs per litre of fuel are found by referencing to the annual production volume. The TLCC is found with eqn (1).44 (1)

I stands for the investment costs, T the tax rate, PVDEP the present value of the series of occurring depreciation, and PVO&M the present value of operation and maintenance costs. The present value of a series of costs Cj is found with eqn (2), which, in case of constant annual payments can be simplified with the annuity factor  with the lifetime n and the interest rate i. (2)
The production costs PC per litre of fuel are then found by eqn (3),44 where Q is the amount of fuel produced per year [L per year]. The equation involves the costs accumulated over the lifetime of the plant, discounted to their value at the start of the project, and divided by the annual amount of fuel produced. It is assumed that the plant is supported by the state and that no taxes have to be paid. (3)
The derivation of production costs thus requires the definition of investment costs and operational costs of the plant besides its lifetime and a plausible interest rate. The latter is found from the assumption of financing the plant 60% through debt and 40% through equity.45 However, it is not trivial to determine a plausible interest rate for an industry that does not exist today. Thus, economy-wide proxy indicators (in our case, for Morocco) are used to determine suitable estimates for debt and equity interest rates. Debt interest rates are derived from official statistics of the IMF46 depicting bank prime lending rates. The debt interest rate is taken to be the bank lending rate. The equity interest rate is defined to be the sum of government bond yields and equity risk premiums (ERP). The bond yields are taken from publically accessible information47,48 and the risk premium is determined after Damodoran.49 Therein, ERP values are derived from mature market premiums, which are adapted by country risk premiums. This method yields an interest rate of 5.7% for debt and 11.8% for equity for Morocco. Finally, inflation is set at 1.2%, which is the average of the years 2013–2017 for Morocco.50 The values for other countries included in the analysis can be found in Table S2 in the ESI.†
The labour costs are determined in the following way: for the operation of the baseline case plant, a number of workers in different occupations is estimated, i.e. 5 managers, 30 engineers, 15 in clerks, 100 technicians and 246 workers. The labour associated with the construction of the plant is assumed to be included in the investment costs. In order to determine the country-specific cost of labour for different occupations, data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) is gathered. The harmonised series of mean nominal monthly earnings, expressed in international US$ is used.51 Based on the techno-economic analysis, a broad amount of required work hours is estimated and a distribution of respective occupations is performed. Accordingly, the occupation classes from the ILO dataset are selected and the working hours are multiplied with the estimated salaries to arrive at the labour costs.
The investment costs and operational costs are determined based on the energy and mass balances (Fig. 2) of the plant, whereas specific costs of components are taken from suppliers or from the literature (see Table S3 in the ESI† for details on the sources of cost estimates).
Environmental life cycle assessment
An LCA52,53 is performed of the baseline solar thermochemical fuel production facility located in Morocco with a direct normal irradiation of 2500 kW h per (m2 year). The impact of greenhouse gases is expressed in the common metric of CO2-equivalents and a boundary of well-to-tank (from provision of resources to tank including transport) and well-to-wake (further including combustion of the fuel) is chosen. Besides, other environmental life-cycle indicators such as human health are addressed in the ESI.† For the transport of the fuels, it is assumed that a dedicated pipeline is built over the distance of 250 km to the sea and a subsequent ship transport over 1000 km is included. The impact analysis is performed based on the energy and mass balances shown in Fig. 2. The functional unit of the system refers to the production of 1.00 litre of jet fuel and 0.84 litres of naphtha. To allocate the emissions between the two products, an energy basis (lower heating value) is used. This leads to 56% of the emissions from the plant being allocated to jet fuel and 44% to naphtha. For the calculation of the life-cycle impacts of solar thermochemical fuel production, the software GaBi Professional54 in combination with the ecoinvent database V3.5 (ref. 55) is used. The CO2 capture from air is modelled with an energy consumption of 1600 kW h t−1 of heat and of 300 kW h t−1 of electricity and assuming the emission of 0.02 t of CO2 per t of CO2 captured,56 whereas 4.8 kg of CO2 are required per functional unit. For the estimation of the material demand for the thermochemical reactors, the reactor size used in the experiments of the SUN-to-LIQUID project57 of 50 kW thermal input power is used, resulting in 720 kg of steel, 615 kg of aluminium oxide, 301 kg of ceria, 5 kg of glass, and 45 kg of aluminium per unit. In the reactors, it is assumed that 50% of the CO2 input is not converted and has to be removed from the gas stream. The unconverted CO2 is captured in a chemical absorption process using 1.97 mg monoethanolamine (MEA) per functional unit, which operates with an efficiency of 90%. This means that 10% of the unconverted CO2 (or about 5% of the CO2 captured from the air) is not captured and assumed to be lost to the environment, as it would otherwise accumulate in the plant.
Social life cycle assessment
The methodology followed to characterise the social life-cycle performance of the jet fuel is based on the PSILCA database.58 PSILCA covers up to 88 social indicators recommended in the UNEP-SETAC guidelines for SLCA39 and acts as both a data source and an impact assessment method. It relies on a multi-regional input/output database called Eora59,60 and quantifies the level of risk for each indicator in more than 15000 country-specific sectors within 189 countries.
The unit used to quantify the social life-cycle impacts is “medium risk hours” (mrh) specific to every single indicator. The quantification of mrh was attained by multiplying an activity term by an intensity term,61 which are defined by the number of working hours required to produce the functional unit and the risk level for a social aspect per working hour, respectively. The number of working hours can be either directly provided (as an inventory flow) or indirectly quantified from an economic input of a specific sector in a specific country, while the sector- and country-specific risk level for each social issue can be retrieved from the PSILCA database (based on global statistics for socio-economic issues provided by international agencies and organisations).58
Among the social indicators available in PSILCA, three indicators were selected to characterise the jet fuel: (i) child labour, which considers the risk of having children between 7 and 14 years old involved in economic activities; (ii) frequency of forced labour, which considers the share of people involved in issues such as human trafficking, forced labour, debt bondage, forced or servile marriage, and the sale or exploitation of children; and (iii) health expenditure, which refers to the overall health status of a society and takes into account both public and private expenditure, indicating the risk of involving economic activities that take place in geopolitical contexts with unfair or poor health systems. These indicators are strongly related to key subjects of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,62 and they are among the recommended social topics in SLCA.63–65
The methodology requires the identification of a “source country” for each economic flow in the product chain considered in the techno-economic analysis. As this study refers to a hypothetical installation, the procedure to select an appropriate source country for the main components and materials was based on the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade).66 In this regard, based on the UN Comtrade statistics for 2017, the country where the jet fuel plant is installed (Morocco) was set as the source country for those materials and components with a positive export-import balance. On the other hand, for the materials and components with a negative balance, the source country was set as that associated with the largest import share. Once identified the source country for the different economic flows within the system, each material and component was associated with an appropriate country-specific sector available in the PSILCA database. In order to enhance the reliability and life-cycle perspective of the study, the same procedure of country and sector selection was separately applied to the heliostats as components with a particular significance in the techno-economic analysis. This approach allows identifying potential social hotspots associated with specific inventory elements and/or source countries involved along the supply chain of the product system.

 Fig. 3  Distribution of investment costs for the baseline case. 
The direct air capture units are assumed to cost 350 € per (t year) at operational costs of 40 € per t plus electricity and heat consumption, resulting in total costs of slightly above 100 € per t, which is the long-term cost target of the technology. Along with CO2, also water is captured from the air at volumetric ratios (water to CO2) of approximately two to six.10 At a total demand of about 12 L water per functional unit (and 5.1 kg CO2), it is assumed here that the required water is supplied by air capture, where alternatively the provision of water by seawater desalination and pipeline transport was shown to add little additional cost (ref. 37). Current prices of heliostats were roughly in the range of 150–200 US$ per m2 in 2013 (ref. 67) and are currently estimated to be at 145–150 US$ per m2. The goal of the SunShot project in the United States is the production of a heliostat with a specific cost of 75 US$ per m2.45 It is assumed that a cost of 100 € per m2 will be reached by the time of the construction of the commercial solar fuel production plant. At the required area of heliostats for the provision of heat for the process of 8.6 million m2, the investment costs are 865 million €. The tower has a cost of 20 $ per kWth (ref. 68) and the solar reactors are estimated to have a cost of 12 € per kWth (see Table S4 in the ESI† for more detail). In the costs for the reactors, the cost for the reactive material is not yet included. Current market prices for ceria are at 5–6 $ per kg and are expected to decline slightly in the near future.69 A market price of 5 € per kg of ceria is assumed as well as availability at this price at the required amount of about 16.9 kt for the baseline case plant. The investment costs for the reactive material are then 84.3 M€ or about two thirds of the cost of the reactor assembly. The investment costs for jet vacuum pumps are taken from Brendelberger et al.43 and are a function of the reduction pressure, where the costs strongly increase towards lower pressures. At the baseline reduction pressure of 1100 Pa (see Fig. S1† for functional dependency of reactor efficiency on reduction pressure), the specific costs of the pumps are 42200 € per (mol s−1), whereas the required flow rate of oxygen is 930 mol s−1 at an operation during 8 hours per day. Additionally, the delivered pump costs are then increased by factors to estimate the total installed costs, which are chosen to be 0.2 for installation and 0.23 for additional costs.70 This leads to total investment costs of 58.6 M€ for the jet vacuum pumps.
For the separation of CO and CO2, chemical absorption with MEA is assumed, with the investment costs based on Kim et al.,32 where a similar device is used. From the size used therein of 140 kt CO2per year to the required size of 270 kt CO2 per year, scaling with an exponent of 0.7 is assumed, which leads to specific costs of 45 € per t captured at a capture efficiency of 90%. CO2 and H2O are captured from the air during the times when the solar-operated conversion plant is not operational and are stored in a gas storage tank, the size of which is chosen equivalent to a full day of production. The optimum storage size is a trade-off between costs for the storage vessel and the compressors. At a storage pressure of 10 bar total investment costs of the CO2 storage unit are 31.2 M€. The costs for the compressors are taken from Apt et al.71 Likewise, syngas is stored in tanks at a pressure of 16 bar, where H2 and CO can in principle be stored in separate tanks due to their availability in separate streams. At a specific cost of 70 $ per standard cubic meter of storage volume,71 the cost of the syngas storage vessels is 58.4 M€ for the hydrogen tanks, 31.0 M€ for the CO storage tanks and 21.1 M€ for the compressors.
Operation and maintenance of the heliostat field is accounted for with 2% of the investment costs annually, which corresponds to an estimate for central receiver systems.72 The operational costs for electricity production are derived from the electricity demand of 5 kW h per functional unit and the specific costs of 0.04 € per kW hel. The maintenance of all systems is assumed to be 3% of the investment costs annually, except for the thermochemical reactors, where a value of 2% is chosen plus the labour costs associated with the refurbishing of ceria. A list of the O&M cost contributions is presented in Table 1 and their relative weight in Fig. 4. The largest contributions to the O&M costs originate in the operation of the heliostat field (also the largest share of the investment costs), the provision of H2O and CO2, and the generation of electricity.
 Fig. 4  Distribution of operation and maintenance costs for the baseline case. 
The resulting production costs (PC) of one litre of jet fuel are 1.97 €nom. (1.75 €real), where the constituents are shown in Fig. 5. The investment costs contribute to the total costs with a share of 70% over the lifetime of the plant and the O&M costs with a share of 30%. The production of solar jet fuel is therefore a process driven by investment costs, as it is often the case for renewable energy conversion, which requires relatively high upfront costs and comparably low operational costs.
 Fig. 5  Nominal production costs of one litre of solar thermochemical jet fuel in the baseline case assuming production in Morocco, capture of H2O and CO2 from the atmosphere at 100 € per t CO2, a thermochemical energy conversion efficiency of 19%, and on-site solar electricity generation at 0.04 € per kW hel. Costs are 1.75 €real per L in real currency. 
LCA
In the baseline case, for the production and transportation of the reference flow, 4.8 kg of CO2 are captured from the air and stored in the products, while 1.7 kg of CO2-eq. are emitted from the process, resulting in net 3.1 kg of CO2-eq. being removed from the atmosphere. The WTT emissions are thus negative, which means that CO2 is removed from the air and stored in the fuels. Of course, when they are combusted, CO2 is re-emitted (4.1 kg of CO2-eq. per functional unit), making the overall emissions positive: 1.0 kg of CO2-eq. per functional unit.
According to the allocation approach and the specific use-phase emissions of each product, the WTW emissions of jet fuel are then 0.61 kg CO2-eq. per L and for naphtha 0.54 kg CO2-eq. per L. In the following, the emissions for the production of one litre of jet fuel are analysed in more detail. The capture of CO2 for the process leads to negative emissions of −2.71 kg CO2-eq. per L, whereas the production of the capture units, its operation including replacement of materials, and its decommissioning, lead to positive emissions of 0.06 kg CO2-eq. per L. The production of CSP electricity on site is connected to emissions of 0.13 kg CO2-eq. per L, which is mainly due to the construction of the infrastructure including heliostats and receivers. Likewise, the concentration infrastructure for the provision of solar heat creates emissions of 0.37 kg CO2-eq. per L, whereas the thermochemical reactors have a contribution of 0.08 kg CO2-eq. per L, which is due to the materials used such as steel, aluminium oxide, or ceria. During the capture of CO2 with MEA from the combined streams from the thermochemical reactors and from the recycle stream from the reformer, the capture efficiency is assumed to be 90%, resulting in an emission of 0.25 kg CO2-eq. per L. All other emissions of the infrastructure of e.g. compressors and the storage of gas and water combined have a sum of 0.06 kg CO2-eq. per L. The transport of the fuel over 250 km with a pipeline and 1000 km with a ship leads to emissions of 0.01 kg CO2-eq. per L. The combustion of jet fuel, finally, emits 2.35 kg CO2-eq. per L to the atmosphere and that of naphtha 2.16 kg CO2-eq. per L.73 The emissions of the conventional fuels are taken from the literature and the ecoinvent database.55,73,74 An overview of the results is also shown in Table 2 and Fig. 6.

 Fig. 6  Overview of emissions from the production and combustion of solar thermochemical jet fuel. 
The largest emissions are associated with the capture of CO2 from the atmosphere (negative emissions), with the concentration of solar energy, with losses during CO2 capture with MEA, and with the combustion of fuel itself. The WTW emissions of solar jet fuel and naphtha achieve a reduction of about 80% with respect to their conventional counterparts.73 Among the other impact categories (see ESI†), e.g. the human health impact related to climate change achieves a value of −3.04 × 10−6 DALY (disability-adjusted life years), which compares favourably to the value of 6.89 × 10−7 DALY of the conventional fuels in a well-to-tank analysis.
Note that the combustion of liquid fuels, regardless of their origin, produces additional local climate effects in contrast to non-emitting propulsion technologies such as battery-powered or fuel cell-powered aircraft. Considering the uncertainties involved in the quantification of these time- and altitude-dependent effects,75 the present study limits itself to the globally averaged climate impact.
SLCA
The flows defining the social life-cycle inventory of the jet fuel were quantified in accordance with the results of the techno-economic analysis. Fig. 7 shows the economic flows and the source countries (in brackets; see ESI† for country codes) identified through the procedure detailed in the Methodology section above. Each box of the figure could be understood as a separate production plant for the materials or components specified, thus defining the scope of the SLCA study.
 Fig. 7  Techno-economic flows and source countries for the SLCA of the baseline case (values per functional unit). 
In order to quantify the selected social life-cycle indicators of the jet fuel, the social inventory in Fig. 7 was implemented using the PSILCA database. Fig. 8 shows the results for the three social indicators broken down by the main contributors. An energy allocation approach between the jet fuel and naphtha co-products was applied consistently with the environmental assessment. It should be noted that, even though the same unit is used, they actually refer to the risk specific to each social indicator. In other words, these social life-cycle impacts should not be directly compared, but they should be interpreted separately.

Regarding child labour, the highest impact contribution was found to be related to the supply of materials and components from China, in particular ceria. Despite the relatively low economic input required for these components (Fig. 7), their high contribution to this social concern is due to the high risk level for child labour in the involved Chinese industrial sectors, unlike the risk level in the remaining country-specific sectors (Table S5 in the ESI†).
When focusing on health expenditure, the plants involved in operation and maintenance and the jet fuel production plant itself account for most of the impact. This finding is closely linked to the high activity (Fig. 7) and intensity (Table S5 in the ESI†) terms for the Moroccan economic activities and sectors involved.
The situation is different when focusing on forced labour. For this social issue, the economic activity in India arises as the main source of impact, while the aforementioned Moroccan economic activities, though significant, show a lower contribution than for health expenditure.
Overall, on the one hand, China and India arise as the main sources of impact for the labour market dysfunctions of child labour and forced labour, respectively. On the other hand, the country where the jet fuel plant is installed (Morocco) is responsible for the risk of involving economic activities in a context with an unfair health system.
Scenarios and sensitivity analysis
Different production locations
To investigate the dependency of the results on the production location, the following countries are included in the analysis for comparison due to their favourable solar resource enabling scalable fuel production and attractive conditions for investments into renewable energies: Australia, Chile, Spain, South Africa and the USA. Fig. 9 summarises the economic, environmental and social performance for the six alternative locations explored for the jet fuel production plant.
 Fig. 9  Sensitivity of the life-cycle indicators to the location of the jet fuel plant. Costs are indicated in current euros. 
The social life-cycle profiles of jet fuel for the alternative locations of fuel production plant are presented in the ESI (Table S6).† Further details on the inventory data and source countries behind these results are also included in the ESI (Fig. S2–S6).† As can be seen from the results, Chile achieves the lowest nominal production costs at 1.72 € per L (1.22 €real per L) together with the lowest GHG emissions of 0.50 kg CO2-eq. per L. With the highest solar irradiation of the selected countries, the solar concentrator consequently has the smallest area, resulting in reduced costs and emissions. The social indicators are lower than in Morocco in case of forced labour and health expenditure but higher in case of child labour. At slightly higher production costs and emissions, the USA have similar (child labour) to much lower social impacts (health expenditure and forced labour) for solar fuel production. Spain achieves a similar performance but at significantly higher emissions due to the lower solar irradiation of 2000 kW h per (m2 year). In South Africa, production costs are prohibitively high because of the high interest rates for capital. Overall, taking into account the five life-cycle indicators assessed in this study, the USA may be considered as a sensible (trade-off) choice among the locations explored.
Low-cost scenario
To investigate the potential for a low-cost boundary, more ambitious assumptions can be made concerning the process parameters and financial boundary conditions. The following parameters are used to make a lower-bound estimate on the production costs: the thermochemical reactor reaches an efficiency of 30%, the heliostats cost drops to 50 € per m2,76 and the tonne of CO2 is acquired at a cost of 40 €. For the baseline case in Morocco, the cost estimate under the enhanced conditions is 1.21 €nom. per L (1.08 €real per L) and 1.16 €nom. per L (0.82 €real per L) in Chile. Significant cost reductions are therefore possible if the process can be improved over the assumptions of the baseline case. However, it should be noted that the achievement of these conditions requires the mass production of heliostats at very low cost and a considerable increase in process efficiency over the current state of the art. Furthermore, a low-cost renewable source of CO2 has to be available, which may present an issue with respect to scalability.
Grid electricity
Instead of producing electricity in a dedicated solar thermal plant on site, it could also be taken from the local grid. At a consumption of about 5 kW hel per functional unit or 2.8 kW h per litre jet fuel, the use of Moroccan grid electricity at a specific carbon intensity of 0.73 kg CO2-eq. per kW hel would increase the WTW GHG emissions from 0.61 kg CO2-eq. L−1 to 2.6 kg CO2-eq. L−1 jet fuel in the baseline case. The reduction of GHG emissions with respect to conventional jet fuel would consequently be reduced from 80% to about 15%. It should be noted that the solar thermochemical fuel pathway as described in this work requires only a small amount of electricity when compared to the power-to-liquid pathway (PtL) that has a consumption of >10 kW hel per litre jet fuel.77 The findings of higher GHG emissions when using grid electricity therefore hold to an even larger degree for the PtL pathway (and other alternative fuel pathways requiring significant amounts of electricity). Moving into a different country with a more favourable carbon intensity than Morocco could reduce the emissions of the fuel. However, for a reduction of 70% of the emissions, as foreseen as the lower limit to be considered an alternative fuel by the EU78 from 2021 onwards, the grid should not have a carbon intensity higher than 0.15 kg CO2 eq. kW−1 hel−1. This level of carbon intensity may not be reached in many sunny locations today but could be in the future, when electricity grids become more and more decarbonised. In any case, the use of renewable electricity maximises the emission savings potential.
CO2 from point source
In the baseline case, it was assumed that CO2 is captured on site from the atmosphere via chemical adsorption. This process is currently in a demonstration and early commercial phase12 and the assumed cost of 100 € per t is a target for future implementations. If the solar thermochemical fuel were to be produced with CO2 from a point source, there is a broad supply such as fossil point sources (e.g. coal and gas power plants), industrial processes (e.g. from steel or cement production), or biological processes (e.g. from biomass conversion). It was shown previously37,79 that the life-cycle emissions of the CO2 used in the process are crucial for the GHG emissions of the fuel produced. This is due to the fact that the total emissions are mainly comprised of those of CO2 supply, of the construction and operation of the plant, and of the combustion of the fuel. The emissions of combustion are similar to those of a conventional fuel and account for about 70% of the total emissions without CO2 supply. To produce an environmentally friendly fuel with significantly lower CO2 emissions, a negative source term has to be introduced via capture of CO2 from a renewable origin, e.g. from air. If fossil CO2 from a natural gas combined cycle power plant is used for the process, the emissions rise from 0.61 kg CO2-eq. per L to 2.9 kg CO2-eq. per L and are thus almost as high as the emissions from conventional jet fuel. The use of biomass-based CO2 leads to low emissions as in the baseline case but the source may not be scalable or available at the locations of high solar irradiation and in dry climates. The authors would like to acknowledge that there is an ongoing debate about the adequacy of different sources of CO2. In this work, a straightforward mass balance approach of carbon atoms was chosen at the system boundary. In this sense, CO2 taken from the atmosphere creates “negative” emissions that partly compensate the emissions incurred by the other process steps, while the use of fossil carbon leads (after proper allocation between the products) to an increase of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.
Conclusions
The solar thermochemical fuel pathway is comprehensively analysed, covering for the first time its economic, environmental and social dimensions in a unified framework. Assuming an energy conversion efficiency of 19% of the thermochemical syngas production and CO2 capture from the air for production in Morocco, nominal production costs of 1.97 € per L jet fuel (1.75 €real per L) at a reduction of 80% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional fuel are achieved. Different social indicators were analysed and potential issues related to child labour and forced labour are found, which are likely to occur in the countries supplying the redox material ceria and providing some of the components used in the production plant. With this information, the incurred risks can be mitigated by enhancing the supply chain and choosing more appropriate suppliers. Different production locations were taken into account and Chile was found to provide the lowest production costs and GHG emissions at an increased risk of child labour. Considering all dimensions of the analysis, the United States could represent a reasonable compromise, joining low production costs and emissions, and a favourable social performance.
Finally, it is concluded that the use of either grid electricity or fossil CO2 will significantly deteriorate the environmental performance of the fuels, inhibiting their use in the transportation sector. Solar thermochemical fuels using renewable electricity and CO2, on the other hand, offer a viable solution to the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector with its strong dependency on liquid fuels. A deep reduction of specific emissions, principally unlimited scalability and favourable economics are core features of solar thermochemical fuels that could enable an environmentally friendly future of aviation.
For future research, it is recommended to further investigate the local financial conditions that also depend on policy measures to mitigate the risk of the investment such as fuel purchase agreements, guaranteed reduced interest rates, and/or special programmes for the introduction of renewable fuels in the transport sector. Furthermore, regionalised differentiation of life-cycle impacts and the enlargement of the supply chain in SLCA could arise as future research topics beyond the scope of this study.
