    , Accepted 13th July 2022First published on 13th July 2022AbstractKnowledge about the charge dynamics in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is a critical clue to optimize device architecture for enhancing the power efficiency and driving voltage characteristics in addition to the external quantum efficiency. In this work, we demonstrated that the charge behavior according to the operation voltage of OLEDs could be understood by introducing the convolutional neural network (CNN) of the machine learning framework without additional analysis of the unipolar charge devices. The CNN model trained using a two-dimensional (2D) modulus fingerprint simultaneously predicted the mobilities of the charge transport and emitting layers, realizing a deep understanding of the complicated data that humans cannot interpret. The machine learning model successfully describes the electrical properties of the organic layers in the actual devices configurated by different electron-transporting materials and the composition of cohosts in the emitting layer. For the first time, it was revealed that 2D fingerprints extracted using frequency- and voltage-dependent modulus spectra were effective data to represent comprehensive charge dynamics of OLEDs. The interpretation and perspective of the machine learning approach in this work were also discussed.

New concepts
In this study, we predicted the charge dynamics depending on the operation voltage in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using the machine learning framework without fabricating the unipolar charge devices. We demonstrated that the charge behavior according to the operation voltage of OLEDs could be understood by introducing the convolutional neural network (CNN) of the machine learning framework without additional analysis of the unipolar charge devices. We obtained that the artificial neural networks could learn the contextual meaning of charge behavior in the modulus spectra that humans could not interpret.

1. Introduction
After the first report of bilayer organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), tremendous improvement of device performance has been realized by comprehensive research toward fundamental organic photonics based on quantum chemistry and applied physics.1–6 Internal quantum efficiency was enhanced from 25% to 100% because of the triplet harvesting mechanisms through spin–orbit coupling (phosphorescence) and thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing (thermally activated delayed fluorescence).7,8 The radiative decay of triplets by heavy metal complex and thermal transition of triplets to singlets by minimizing the thermodynamic barrier between both states successfully realized utilization of the entire singlets and triplets formed by polaron recombination. To efficiently extract the photons generated by the radiative decay of excitons in the light-emitting layer (EML) toward the outside of devices, optical loss originating from an intrinsic optical microcavity structure of OLEDs should be minimized. Controlling the refractive index of organic layers and transient dipole orientation was introduced as an effective approach to overcome the challenges to increase the portion of outcoupled air mode.2,9–11
As the first process modulating the factors involving the efficiency, optimization of polaron transport is an essential requirement to ensure the high-performance of devices.12–19 First, driving voltage and power efficiency intrinsically depend on the charge carrier mobility of the charge transport layer since high mobility of the charge transport layer facilitates the transportation of a high number of polarons toward EML with a low electric field.20–23 Second, the balance between electrons and holes, which could be divided into the balance of carrier density and mobility, is directly related to the formation ratio of excitons and consecutive inter-particle reactions.12,18,19 Unbalance of the charges simultaneously degrades the quantum efficiency and roll-off characteristics due to the low exciton formation ratio and the interaction between excitons and polarons. Additionally, fast and balanced charge transport is an effective strategy to enhance device efficiency and operational stability. It has been reported that exciton–exciton and exciton–polaron interactions increase the probability of bond dissociation of organic molecules, resulting in luminance quenching and voltage rising.24–30 It is understood that the bimolecular interactions lead to additional excitation of the polaronic state of molecules beyond the bond dissociation energies. To reduce the bimolecular reaction in EML, the minimization of long-lived triplets through the reverse intersystem crossing and controlling the charge balance were introduced to enhance device stability. Especially, enhancement of the charge balance was reported to significantly suppress the exciton–exciton and exciton–polaron interactions since balanced mobilities and carrier densities lead to delocalized exciton distribution and minimization of surplus polarons.14
The charge dynamics of OLEDs is the harmony of complicated charge transport processes of electrons and holes in the multilayer structure. As the multilayer of organic semiconductors should be adopted to enhance device performance, nonuniform charge transport and charge accumulation are inevitably involved in device operation because of various charge mobilities and frontier orbital levels of each layer. To understand the charge behavior of OLEDs, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the unipolar charge devices in addition to that of OLEDs has been analyzed since only J–V of OLEDs could not provide separate information of charge transport of electrons and holes.31–34 To implement the charge ambiguity of J–V of OLEDs, impedance spectroscopy was introduced to determine the transit times of electrons and holes simultaneously.12,18,35–41 Although the electric modulus spectra showed a few peaks corresponding to the transit time, preliminary background information about relative magnitudes of electron and hole transport layers should be known to assign each peak to polarity type of charge carriers. Moreover, as the charges transporting with various mobilities in each organic layer result in multiple peaks in modulus spectra, the overlap of modulus peaks leads to the ambiguity of interpretation using the human analysis method.
Machine learning has been widely applied in the fields of materials and device engineering recently. Various machine learning approaches to predict the properties of materials and device performance of unknown structures in OLEDs,42–45 organic solar cells,46–52 and rechargeable batteries53 have been demonstrated. It has been reported that established specific rules via the training process in machine learning could provide new information from the data in materials engineering.
In this study, we proposed a novel strategy toward a fast understanding of the charge dynamics without fabricating the unipolar charge devices by introducing machine learning to interpret modulus spectra. To train the modulus spectra, the imaginary modulus (Im M)–direct current (DC) voltage (V)–alternating current (AC) frequency (f) dataset generated using drift–diffusion modeling was converted to two-dimensional (2D) images and used as a training set in the framework of the convolutional neural network (CNN). The utilization of Im M–V–f image as a fingerprint of the device in the machine learning framework successfully realized the prediction protocol of the charge behavior of OLEDs, including the charge mobility of each layer. The CNN model successfully predicted the electrical properties of the organic layers of OLEDs, indicating that contextual information on the voltage and frequency-dependent modulus behavior is essential to understand the charge dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this work is a pioneering approach to analyze the charge behavior of OLED without any unipolar charge devices using a machine learning framework.
Furthermore, we demonstrated a prototype optimization procedure of device architecture in red phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) with the knowledge of charge dynamics predicted using the proposed CNN-based model. The change in the spatial distribution of the charges due to the electron-transporting layer (ETL) and the composition ratio of the cohost in EML was described via the drift–diffusion simulation using predicted electrical properties.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. New development strategy of device architecture of OLEDs based on machine learning using modulus spectra as a fingerprint

Fig. 1 compares conventional device development processes and our proposed novel strategy based on the fast understanding of the charge dynamics facilitated by the machine learning framework. Generally, to improve device performance by controlling charge behavior, the crucial origin of charge imbalance or charge retardation could not be clarified by electro-optical characterization of OLEDs. Therefore, the unipolar charge devices containing every single organic layer should be fabricated and characterized in terms of current density and mobility analysis. Based on the characterization results, design rules for new device architecture could be established. The new proposed development strategy analyzes OLEDs only to diagnose a critical layer causing poor device performance. After measurement of modulus spectroscopy of devices and fundamental electro-optical characterization, the charge dynamics of devices as a background of building new architecture could be understood through the CNN-based machine learning framework. In this process, analysis time and resources would be significantly reduced as additional fabrication and analysis of the unipolar charge devices are not necessarily required.
 Fig. 1  Proposed protocol of the architectural development in OLEDs facilitated by understanding charge dynamics through machine learning. Two-dimensional fingerprint, comprising AC frequency and DC voltage-dependent modulus spectra, was used as input data to train the convolutional neural network. 
To effectively utilize machine learning to train the charge dynamics, featurization of input data is essential to represent the physical meaning of devices. In the field of molecular discovery based on machine learning, various methods of molecular fingerprint appropriately exhibiting structural and chemical properties of the given molecular structure have been recently proposed.47,54–57 As a fingerprint corresponding to the charge dynamics of OLEDs, we selected the modulus spectra of OLEDs depending on the DC voltage and AC frequency. In the case of conventional current density–voltage property, the information of the transit time of each organic layer, charge retardation, and charge accumulation were not separately extracted since these mechanisms commonly result in the change of resistance in devices. However, for the impedance measurement to obtain the modulus spectra, the effects of charge retardation and accumulation separately contribute to the amplitude and phase shift of AC current output. Additionally, in the modulus spectra, the transit time of charge carriers could be deduced from peak frequency.18,41
2.2. Investigation of the relationship between (Im M–V–f) fingerprint and the charge dynamics of OLEDs
For a correlation between the modulus spectra and charge behavior of OLEDs, we performed the equivalent circuit simulation of modulus spectra based on double parallel RC circuits for primary purposes. Fig. 2 shows Im M spectra of five circuits consisting of double parallel RC circuits. Table 1 presents the resistance and capacitance values of each circuit in the simulation. Since the R1 and C1 values were the same for all circuits, the modulus peak located at the frequency of 316 Hz was commonly shown. However, as the resistance R2 gradually decreased from 5000 to 1000 Ω in circuits 1–3, the second modulus peak corresponding to the parallel R2–C2 circuit moved from 10000 to 50119 Hz. For circuits 3–5, the intensity of modulus spectrum increases from 1.7 × 108 to 5.0 × 108 Ω with decreasing the capacitance C2. In the correlation between microscopic charge behavior and macroscopic equivalent circuit values, the resistance and capacitance corresponded to the mobility and charge accumulation, respectively. In this context, the simulation based on the equivalent circuit could be understood that the peak frequency and intensity were related to the charge transport and accumulation in the device. Considering these characteristics of the modulus spectra, the charge mobilities and behavior of OLEDs have been reported in few studies.18,41,58

Fig. 3 describes the processes of the dataset generation, neural network construction, and electrical properties’ prediction in actual OLEDs. To train the artificial neural network, a drift–diffusion simulation was conducted to generate a modulus dataset. Compared to the equivalent circuit modeling, the drift–diffusion simulation calculates the discrete charge behavior of OLEDs, which is intuitively understood with comprehensive microscopic processes.14,59–64 In the drift–diffusion simulation, the charge transport is described by the field-induced drift and concentration-induced diffusion mechanisms. To reproduce the intrinsic charge transport in the density of states resulting in the Poole–Frenkel behavior in organic semiconductors, the distribution of electrical trap states in the bandgap region was introduced.65,66 The detailed simulation scheme is presented in the ESI.† The layer thicknesses were set as fixed values during data generation. The device structure is arranged as indium tin oxide (ITO)/HTL1 (80 nm)/HTL2 (10 nm)/EML (30 nm)/ETL2 (5 nm)/ETL1 (30 nm)/Al. The thicknesses of the organic layers were assumed by considering the red PhOLEDs. The nine parameters that were randomly generated to calculate the modulus dataset were set to the HTL1 hole mobility, HTL1 trap density, HTL2 mobility, EML hole mobility, EML electron mobility, recombination coefficient, ETL2 mobility, ETL1 electron mobility, and ETL1 trap density. The recombination coefficient was assumed to be the Langevin recombination. The boundaries and distributions of the dataset are presented in Table S1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†).
 Fig. 3  Schematic illustration describing the data generation, machine learning, and prediction processes to utilize modulus spectra as input data. 
During the machine learning process, the CNN model having the 2D image as the input and the nine nodes in the dense layer as the output was trained using the dataset. To understand the charge behavior of OLEDs, nine electrical properties of actual devices predicted by the trained model were used to calculate the charge distributions via the drift–diffusion simulation. Fig. 4 shows the charge/exciton distributions at 3 V, Im M spectra for various DC voltages, and converted 2D images of the modulus spectra for two representative cases calculated by the drift–diffusion simulation. The inset of Fig. 4a and d shows the main parameters in the simulation. For case 1, overall hole density in HTL1 was lower than the electron density of ETL1 because of low hole mobility (1.4 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1) of HTL1 and high electron mobility (2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of ETL1. The charge accumulation occurred in HTL2 and ETL2 layers due to the charge retardation by low hole mobility (2.9 × 10−10 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron mobility (5.6 × 10−10 cm2 V−1 s−1) of EML. For the inside of EML, recombination zone, electrons, and holes were broadly delocalized due to the balanced electron and hole mobilities. The modulus spectra are described in Fig. 4b. For all DC voltages, two distinctive modulus peaks existed and shifted with DC voltage. The first peak moved from 428 Hz at 2.4 V to 20,700 Hz at 4.0 V, and the second peak showed a relatively small shift for all DC voltages. From the knowledge that the electron mobility of ETL1 was larger than the hole mobility of HTL1, it could be understood that the first and second peaks corresponded to hole and electron, respectively. The spectrum shift of the first peak could be attributed to the fact that the local electric field at HTL1 was largely changed with the increase of DC voltage. The intensity of the two spectra increased with DC voltage, indicating that the capacitances of HTL and ETL were reduced. The reduction of the capacitances could be understood that the phase shift of AC current due to the charges at the organic/electrode interface decreased because of the charge injection. The modulus spectra for various DC voltages were converted to a 2D gray-scaled contour plot and displayed in Fig. 4c. Since the X-, Y-, and Z-axis corresponded to the AC frequency, DC voltage, and Im M values, the fingerprint representing comprehensive charge dynamics was generated.
 Fig. 4  Correlation between charge and exciton distribution and the modulus spectra-based fingerprints in two representative cases. The main parameters used in the drift–diffusion simulations are presented in the inset of (a and d). The fingerprint in the form of gray-scaled 2-D images representing the charge dynamics with a pixel size of (20, 10) was adopted to the input data in the training of the convolutional neural network. 
The hole density in HTL1 and HTL2 region was higher than that of case 1, which originated from the higher mobility (8.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) of HTL1 in case 2. The charge accumulation at the interface between the EML and charge transport layers occurred for electrons and holes. Additionally, relatively unbalanced electron and hole mobilities (μh = 1.9 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 3.0 × 10−10 cm2 V−1 s−1) in EML resulted in localized recombination zone and electron density toward EML/ETL2 interface as the electrons could not effectively transfer toward EML. The maximum value of exciton formation rate in EML of case 2 was about 4000 times higher than that of case 1. In the modulus spectra of case 2 (Fig. 4e), there were three modulus peaks observed clearly in the DC voltage range of 2.6–4.0 V. The three modulus peaks indicating three transit times of the charge in the device could be deduced from holes in HTL1 (8.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), electrons in ETL1 (1.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), and holes in HTL2 (2.4 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, the detailed behavior of the charges could not be understood from the modulus spectra by the analysis of humans due to the ambiguity of the charge polarity, overlap of multiple peaks, and local field variation dependent on the distribution of charges. 2D fingerprint converted from the modulus spectra shows relatively low saturated gray color and characteristic three columns in 102–105 Hz frequency region.
2.3. Construction and training of artificial neural networks
To train the 2D modulus spectra images effectively, we designed the neural network comprising the convolutional, pooling, and dense layers. The size of the filter was set to (3, 3), and rectified linear units were used as an activation function. In the pooling layer, the max-pooling algorithm was used. The hyperparameter optimization was performed by tuning the neural network structure, dropout rate, and learning rate (Tables S2–S6, ESI†). Consequently, three convolutional and two pooling layers were connected, and the flattened data was fully connected to the dense layer with 100 nodes. The dropout rate was set to 0.5. The learning rate was 0.001, and the Adam optimizer was used to train the network.67 The total dataset was 4000 cases, and the dataset was divided into 80%, 10%, and 10% for training, validating, and testing procedures, respectively. The dataset can be found at https://github.com/jmkim52/2022_Mater.Horizon. We performed 10-fold cross-validation by variously dividing training and validating datasets. The learning step was determined by minimum epoch reaching saturated root mean square error value of validation dataset to suppress the overfitting. The learning curve is presented in Fig. S2 in ESI.†
2.4. Performance of CNN-based charge dynamics prediction model

Fig. 5a shows the prediction accuracy of the trained CNN model visualized as a form of label versus predicted data plot. The performances for the HTL1 trap density, HTL2 mobility, ETL2 mobility, and ETL1 trap density were relatively poorer than those of other parameters. To confirm the effect of simultaneous optimization in the multi-task model, we investigate the performances of individual single-task models as presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The R2 values of the single-task models were lower than those of the multi-task model except for the HTL1 mobility. It indicated that the simultaneous optimization of the multi-task structure was not the origin of the low predictivities of these factors. For the charge transport layers, hole mobility of HTL1 and electron mobility of ETL1 were successfully predicted using the CNN model. However, the trap densities of HTL1 and ETL1 showed inconsistent behavior. In the case of the trap density, the trap density region below about 1016 cm−3 could not be predicted well. These characteristics showed that the low density of trap states did not effectively contribute to the charge transport. To further investigate the effect of trap density, we performed a simulation of J–V characteristics of OLED and studied the current density change-dependent on the number of trap states in HTL1 and ETL1. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the current densities at 4 V according to the trap density in HTL1 and ETL1. The current density of the device showed little variation in the trap density range of 1014–1016 cm−3 and a decrease with increasing trap density, which explains the non-predictable region of trap density. Prediction performances for hole mobility of HTL2 and electron motility of ETL2 were also poor compared to other physical properties. These results would be attributed to the contribution of the layers to the charge dynamics due to relatively low thickness in the entire device structure.
 Fig. 5  Prediction performance of the trained CNN model. (a) Distribution of predicted values for train/validation/test dataset. (b) R2 values of the CNN model applied in the validation and test dataset. The predictability for the charge carrier mobilities of HTL1, ETL1, and EML using machine learning showed that the modulus spectra as a fingerprint were an effective featurization strategy to imply the charge behavior of OLEDs. For trap density, poor predictability in the low density region originated from the density-dependent effectiveness of traps to the charge transport. 
Interestingly, electron and hole mobilities in EML were predicted by CNN quite well. Generally, the mobilities in EML could not be analyzed in modulus spectra through human intelligence since the modulus spectra corresponding to the charges in EML were significantly overlapped or overwhelmed by those of the charges transporting in HTL and ETL. However, the artificial neural network could learn subtle differences of modulus intensity and curvature in the spectra for various cases and utilize the knowledge to predict the mobilities in EML. Additionally, the effect of local field distribution induced by the mobility balance in EML to the charge transport in HTL and ETL was considered in machine learning. In predicting mobilities, the predictivity gradually decreased at the upper and lower limit values of parameters. This behavior could be attributed to the simultaneous optimization of the multi-task model and the limit of the frequency window (102–106 Hz) in the modulus spectra.

Fig. 5b describes the predictivities of the model in terms of R2. If the predictivity is 100%, R2 = 1. The R2 values for mobilities of HTL1 and ETL1 were 0.868 and 0.760, respectively. As expected, the modulus spectrum mainly depends on the charge transport from the electrode to the EML. The R2 values of HTL1 and ETL1 exceeded those of other layers. R2 values of the EML were 0.674, 0.702, and 0.700 for the electron mobility, hole mobility, and recombination coefficient, respectively. Furthermore, the predictivities for the EML properties showed similar values. Relatively low R2 values of the trap densities in HTL1 and ETL1 were attributed to the noneffective trap density region. In the CNN algorithm, the contextual dependence of the modulus on the DC voltages and AC frequencies was embedded in a 2D fingerprint because the x- and y-axis corresponded to the voltage and frequency, respectively. In other words, the voltage-dependent behavior of the modulus spectra was closely related to the electrons and holes mobilities in EML, as expected. Table 2 summarizes the performances of the CNN model.

2.5. Understanding of the charge dynamics of OLEDs using machine learning
For the application of the machine learning framework to understand the charge dynamics of actual devices, we fabricated three kinds of red PhOLEDs designed with different device architectures. In device 1, N-([1,10-biphenyl]-4-yl)-9,9-dimethyl-N-(4-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)phenyl)-9H-fluoren-2-amine (BCFA), N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′′-diamine (NPB), 2,2,2-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) (TPBi), and (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris-(benzene-3,1-diyl))tris(diphenylphosphine oxide) (POT2T) were used as HTL1, HTL2, ETL1, and ETL2, respectively. We used 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HATCN) doped BCFA for the hole injection. For EML, NPB and POT2T were adopted as an exciplex-forming cohost for bis(4-methyl-2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)quinoline))Ir(III) (tetramethylheptadionate) (Ir(mphmq)2tmd) as a red phosphorescent dopant. In devices 2 and 3, we used 2-[4-(9,10-di-naphthalen-2-yl-anthracen-2-yl)-phenyl]-1-phenyl-1H-benzoimidazole (ZADN) in ETL1. As shown in Fig. 6a, the device structures of all devices are as follows (Table 3):

Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the molecular structure and energetic diagram of the devices. Compared to device 1, the device structures of devices 2 and 3 included ZADN and 50:50 wt% cohost, respectively. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the J–V of unipolar charge devices consisting of ETL and EML materials. From the J–V characteristics of electron-only devices, ZADN shows faster electron transport than TPBi. Additionally, hole transport in the EML was enhanced by increasing the portion of NPB in cohost. Fig. 6b–d show the device performances of the devices. EL spectra of the devices are depicted in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The current density and luminance for all voltage regions increased with the change in ETL1 materials and the composition ratio of cohost. The turn-on voltage corresponding to the luminance of 1 cd m−2 also decreased from 3.0 V in device 1 to 2.5 V in devices 2 and 3. Fig. 6c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and power efficiency. Maximum EQEs of the devices showed almost the same values, which were 17.0%, 16.9%, and 17.2% for devices 1, 2, and 3, respectively. However, the maximum power efficiencies of the devices were 24.1 lm W−1, 28.5 lm W−1, and 30.2 lm W−1, which exhibited gradual enhancement with the change of device architecture. Fig. 6d shows the critical enhancement of the driving voltages and power efficiencies of the devices. From devices 1 to 3, the driving voltage corresponding to the luminance of 1000 cd m−2 was reduced from 4.9 to 3.7 V, and the maximum power efficiency was enhanced from 24.1 to 30.2 lm W−1, respectively. The experimental results showed that the device performance in terms of EQE and power efficiency was enhanced by controlling the charge dynamics of the devices.

Fig. 7a shows the 2D modulus spectra of the devices processed by measuring the impedance response depending on the frequency and voltage. Conventional plots of the modulus spectra are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The common feature of the devices was that the spectrum corresponding to relatively fast transport was located at a frequency of more than 106 Hz in all DC voltage ranges, indicating that one polar type of the charges showed very fast transport during operation. Based on the background knowledge of the device architectures, the charges exhibiting fast transport would be holes at the BCFA layer. For devices 1 and 2, two modulus spectra in the frequency region of 102–103 Hz were gradually merged and shifted toward higher frequency with an increase in DC voltage. For device 3, a gradual decrease of full width at half maximum of the spectrum would be also attributed to the convergence of multiple spectra.

The corresponding electric fields were 5.0 × 105 V cm−1 for HTL1-2, 1.5 × 106 V cm−1 for EML, and 2.5 × 106 V cm−1 for ETL1-2, respectively. 
To evaluate the performance of the CNN model, we fabricated and analyzed the unipolar charge devices comprising each organic layer in the devices to characterize the electrical properties using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) theory.68,69 In the drift–diffusion simulation, as the charge transport was numerically described by combining the intrinsic mobility and the trap density, the data conversion from the numerical mobility model in the drift–diffusion simulation to the analytical SCLC mobility model for the analysis of unipolar charge devices should be performed. The predicted values were converted to the SCLC mobilities by simulating the J–V curves of the unipolar charge devices using the drift–diffusion simulation. Fig. 7b and Fig. S9 (ESI†) show the predicted and experimentally determined mobilities of the organic layers. For the hole mobility of HTL1, the predicted values for devices 1–3 are 8.0 × 10−3, 1.5 × 10−3, and 4.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are close to the experimentally determined values (3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The hole mobility of HTL1 was predicted as the highest value among the organic layers, indicating that the CNN model assigned the modulus peak located around 106 Hz as holes in the HTL1. In the conventional interpretation of the modulus spectra, the correlation among the peaks with specific charges in the organic layer could be possibly based on the background information of the mobilities. Therefore, the mobility of the organic layer could not be extracted from the modulus spectra of multilayer OLEDs using the conventional method. However, the CNN model employed internal established rules via the training process and could interpret the modulus behavior of the devices. For the EML, as the portion of NPB in the cohosts increases from 25 wt% in device 2 to 50 wt% in device 3, the experimental hole mobility increases from 2.7 × 10−5 to 1.5 × 10−4, but the electron mobility did not change significantly. The CNN model predicted the enhancement of the hole mobility in device 3, but the absolute values exceeded the experimental values in all devices. The predicted electron mobilities were closed to the actual values. For the electron mobility of the ETL1, the mobility improvement via changing the electron-transporting materials from device 1 to device 2 was predicted by the CNN model with ∼1 order smaller values compared to the actual values.
The charge distributions according to the driving voltage simulated by the drift–diffusion simulation using the predicted and experimental physical parameters are presented in Fig. S10 (ESI†). For all devices, the charge transport characteristics from the electrodes to the EML are well described by the predicted values. The relatively higher density of the holes in the HTL for device 1 was derived from the higher predicted mobility of HTL1. For devices 2 and 3, which adopted the other ETL1 material (ZADN), the number of injected electrons increased with the experimental and predicted values. Concerning EML, since the hole mobilities are predicted as relatively higher than the actual values, the exciton distribution is located at the ETL side in the EML in the drift–diffusion simulation. The exciton and polaron distributions were sensitive to the mobility balance between the electrons and holes. Although the CNN model predicted the hole-dominating mobilities and the enhancement of the hole mobility by controlling the mixing ratio in the cohosts in the devices, the distribution of excitons and polarons could not be reproduced because of the variance of the absolute values. To predict the exact recombination zone in the EML, the predictivity for electrical properties of the EML should be enhanced.
2.6. Discussion
The CNN model used herein could be applied after the number and thicknesses of the device layers were fixed. During the device optimization, the EQE of the OLED considerably depends on the thicknesses of the layers since the light outcoupling is governed by the optical microcavity structure. Additionally, the broadening of the recombination zone by designing a thick EML increases the driving voltage because of the highest resistance of the EML among the organic layers. Considering that these factors primarily affect the efficiency, the device optimization is performed via selecting materials after designing the layer thicknesses. Therefore, the layer thickness prediction via the machine learning model would not be useful in actual device optimization processes.
For the ETL1 in device 1, the lower predicted electron mobility than the experimental value is attributed to the giant surface potential due to the TPBi polarization.13,18,70,71 The CNN model interprets the voltage-dependent modulus spectra rather than the effective internal field. The charge injection retardation due to the specific potential landscape could not be understood by the CNN model, resulting in the lower value prediction to explain the slow charge injection in TPBi. To use the feature that the CNN model analyzes the effective mobilities in the device, an effective strategy to use the machine learning model would be the understanding of the charge dynamics from the predicted values, which could not be obtained by the indirect investigation of the unipolar charge devices.
As the pioneering work for the introduction of machine learning to predict the charge dynamics of OLEDs, further research should be conducted to improve the predictivity of our CNN model. First, the number of datasets for training the model should be increased. In this work, we used 4000 cases of the modulus spectra due to the limited computational time and computing resources. A large-scale dataset, including a variety of the charge behavior, would enhance the model's performance. Second, further development of the artificial neural network would reinforce the learning algorism of the model from given datasets. In image classification, the prediction error has been significantly reduced by the advancement of artificial neural networks, such as AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet.72–74 In the same context, optimizing the neural network structure could be a strategy to upgrade the CNN model. Third, the supplement of the type of input data and the modulus spectra could enhance the predictivity of the physical parameters in EML. R2 values for parameters in EML were relatively lower than those of the charge transport layers in our model. This is because the weight of information about EML was low in the modulus spectra due to the spectra overlap. Therefore, the addition of new input data representing the electrical parameters in EML would reinforce the weakness of our model.
3. Conclusion
The charge dynamics depending on the operation voltage in OLEDs were understood using the machine learning framework without fabricating the unipolar charge devices. We successfully demonstrated that the artificial neural networks could learn the contextual meaning of charge behavior in the modulus spectra that humans could not interpret. The mobilities, trap densities, and recombination coefficient of the organic layers were extracted from the 2D modulus fingerprint via the CNN model. A trained CNN model was applied to analyze actual red PhOLEDs comprising different ETL materials and cohost configuration. The predicted electrical properties of the layers using the CNN model agreed well with the experimentally obtained values. The charge distribution simulated by the drift–diffusion model using the predicted value could aid in understanding the change in the charge behavior according to different device architectures. We believe that the scientific insight involved in the utilization of machine learning to understand the charge dynamics would shed new light on unraveling comprehensive physical phenomena in OLEDs.
4. Experimental section
OLEDs were fabricated by stacking multilayer organic materials using vacuum deposition. The deposition rate of organic materials was 1 Å s−1, and evaporation was performed after the plasma treatment of ITO substrates. The device performance of the device was characterized using Keithley 2400 and CS 2000 (Konica Minolta Inc.) spectroradiometer. Impedance spectra of the device were obtained from Zurich Instruments MFIA 5 MHz Impedance analyzer.

New concepts
In this study, we predicted the charge dynamics depending on the operation voltage in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using the machine learning framework without fabricating the unipolar charge devices. We demonstrated that the charge behavior according to the operation voltage of OLEDs could be understood by introducing the convolutional neural network (CNN) of the machine learning framework without additional analysis of the unipolar charge devices. We obtained that the artificial neural networks could learn the contextual meaning of charge behavior in the modulus spectra that humans could not interpret.

For trap density, poor predictability in the low density region originated from the density-dependent effectiveness of traps to the charge transport.
