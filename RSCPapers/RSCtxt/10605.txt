    , Accepted 1st September 2014First published on 9th September 2014AbstractY2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ (EYYTO) phosphors co-doped with Li+ ions were synthesized by a conventional solid-state ceramic method. X-ray diffraction studies show that all the Li+ co-doped EYYTO samples are highly crystalline in nature with pyrochlore face centred cubic structure. X-ray photon spectroscopy studies reveal that the incorporation of Li+ ions creates the defects and/or vacancies associated with the sample surface. The effect of Li+ ions on the photoluminescence up-conversion intensity of EYYTO was studied in detail. The up-conversion study under ∼976 nm excitation for different concentrations of Li+ ions showed that the green and red band intensities were significantly enhanced. The 2 at% Li+ ion co-doped EYYTO samples showed nearly 15- and 8-fold enhancements in green and red band up-converted intensities compared to Li+ ion free EYYTO. The process involved in the up-conversion emission was evaluated in detail by pump power dependence, the energy level diagram, and decay analysis. The incorporation of Li+ ions modified the crystal field around the Er3+ ions, thus improving the up-conversion intensity. To investigate the sensing application of the synthesized phosphor materials, temperature-sensing performance was evaluated using the fluorescence intensity ratio technique. Appreciable temperature sensitivity was obtained using the synthesized phosphor material, indicating its applicability as a high-temperature-sensing probe. The maximum sensitivity was found to be 0.0067 K−1 at 363 K.
1. Introduction
Lanthanide (Ln3+)-doped nano-phosphors have attracted much attention because of their wide applicability in optical filters, laser materials, LEDs, and spectral convertors as the next-generation energy-harvesting materials in solar cells and up-conversion luminescent nano-materials.1–4 The interest in nano-phosphors is increasing because of their superior features such as long-lived luminescence, anti-Stokes shifts, narrow emission bands, high resistance to photo-bleaching, a remarkable light penetration depth in tissue, and low toxicity compared to conventional molecular probes such as organic dyes and quantum dots.5 Ln3+-doped nano-phosphors involve intra 4f–4f electronic transitions, providing fascinating features because of abundant energy levels, long lifetimes (∼ms to μs) because of the parity-forbidden nature of 4f–4f transitions and a sharp spectral width of ∼10 nm. However, the low absorption cross-section of Ln3+ ions decreases the efficiency of luminescence intensity by direct excitation into the 4f bands. To overcome this problem, Yb3+ has been used as a prominent sensitizer because of its larger absorption cross-section at NIR excitation than Er3+ and/or Tm3+ counterparts. Energy is transferred from Yb3+ to Er3+/Tm3+. The up-conversion process (two/three-photon process) is observed when subsequent energy transfer (ET) promotes the electrons of Er3+ and/or Tm3+ ions to higher energy levels, and radiative decay pathways lead to higher energy, emitting up-converted photons in the visible range.6 In particular, the advances in IR sources, blue-, green-, and red-emitting colour phosphors are important in designing smart temperature-sensing devices and bio-imaging applications.7–9 Y2Ti2O7, one of the members of the classical pyrochlore family, has attracted much attention because of its unique optical properties and potential applications in up-conversion lasers, bio-imaging, and DNA detection.1–4,10,11 However, the up-conversion efficiency (η) of these nano-crystals is still inadequate, thus limiting their wide range of applications. Moreover, various studies have been performed to enhance the up-conversion intensity η by changing the crystal phase, functionalising the surface of the sample, incorporating a co-dopant sensitizer, and/or by core–shell formation.12–15 Moreover, the intensity of Ln3+-doped up-conversion materials strongly depends on intra 4f–4f transition probabilities and is also influenced by the crystal field symmetry and crystallinity of the samples.16,17 Li+ ions can be doped in the host matrices efficiently because of their small ionic radius, either by substitution or interstitial incorporation. The substitution and/or interstitial incorporation of Li+ ions in the Ln3+-doped host matrices distorts the lattice symmetry of the crystal field around the Ln3+ ions (Er3+ in our case), thus improving the up-conversion intensity.17,18 Several studies have reported the improvements in up-conversion intensities for different host matrices by Li+ ion co-doping. Chen et al.19 reported 25-fold improvement in the visible up-conversion intensity in Y2O3:Er3+/Yb3+/Li+-doped nano-phosphors, while 30-fold improvement has been obtained after Li+ incorporation in NaGdF4:Er3+/Yb3+ host matrices.20 Bai et al.21 and Li et al.22 also reported the effect of Li+ ions on the significant enhancement in up-conversion intensity and proposed the change in crystal symmetry around the Ln3+ ions as one of the reasons for luminescence enhancement.
In recent years, the fluorescence-based temperature-sensing technique has attracted much attention and contributed a vital role because it can overcome the strong signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and hazardous sparks, which are not possible in conventional temperature sensors such as thermocouple detectors in oil refineries and coal mines.23–25 In conventional temperature sensors derived by the liquid and metal expansion principle, temperature is measured by the heat flow using an invasive probe. Optical temperature sensors are based on temperature-dependent fluorescence lifetimes and the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of the thermally coupled electronic transitions of Ln3+ ions. These methods have attracted much attention and proved superior to the pre-existing conventional methods. The FIR technique based on the measurement of luminescence intensities from two thermally coupled levels of Ln3+ ions is independent of spectrum losses and fluctuations in the excitation intensity; therefore, it can be used to provide more accurate temperature measurements.26 The operating temperature range and sensitivity should be high for a high-quality temperature sensor. The search for a new class of materials for this purpose is challenging and still underway.
Herein, we report a structural, up-conversion, and temperature-sensing approach by introducing Li+ ions into Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphor prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction method. The structures of the phosphors with different amounts of Li+ ion concentrations were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). A substantial change in the up-conversion intensity and decay time (τ) of the intermediate 4S3/2 (green band) state was monitored. The mechanism involved in the up-conversion process was elucidated by pump power dependence, a suitable energy level diagram, and decay studies. To study the temperature-sensing behaviour, an FIR-based technique was used. To the best of our knowledge, no temperature-sensing studies have been conducted for the Er3+/Yb3+ and Li+ tri-doped Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlore system. The thermally coupled 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels of Er3+ ions in the spectrum demonstrated temperature-dependent behaviour and probed for optical thermometry using the FIR technique.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation
ErxYbyLizY2−x−y−zTi2O7 (x = 1 and y = 2 at%, z = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) samples were prepared by a conventional solid-state ceramic method. Analytical reagent (AR) grade yttrium oxide (Y2O3, Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), titanium oxide (TiO2, 99.9%, Alfa Aesar), ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3, Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), erbium oxide (Er2O3, Alfa Aesar, 99.98%) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, Merck, 99.98%) were used as the starting materials. Stoichiometric amounts of starting materials were mixed in a planetary ball mill with zirconia jars and zirconia balls for 6 h at 50 rpm using acetone as the mixing medium (solvent). The dried mixed powders were calcined in an alumina crucible in an ambient atmosphere (air) at 1200 °C for 6 h, and then the samples were furnace cooled to room temperature. A few drops of a 2% solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were added to the powder as the binder. The calcined powders were ground, mixed, and pelletized at 75 kN. The pellets were sintered at 1300 °C for 12 h. During sintering, the pellets were initially heated at a rate of 2 °C per min to 500 °C and then kept at this temperature for 1 h to evaporate the binder. Then, the pellets were heated at a rate of 4 °C per min to the sintering temperature of 1300 °C. After sintering, the samples were furnace cooled to room temperature.
2.2 Characterization techniques
The structure of the phosphor was identified by XRD using a Rigakuminiflex-II diffractometer and CuKα radiation (1.5406 Å) at ∼30 kV and 15 mA. All the patterns were recorded from 2θ 10° to 90° with a step size of 0.02°. The FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer in the range 4000–400 cm−1. The sample was mixed with KBr (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) in a 1:5 ratio, and a transparent pellet was prepared. Micro-Raman spectra were recorded under 514.5 nm Ar+ excitation at room temperature. The chemical composition and valence state of the elements were analysed by XPS using a monochromatic AlKα (hν = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source and a hemispherical analyzer (SPECS, HSA3500). The recorded spectra were charge-corrected to the C1s ∼ 284.6 eV as the reference. The morphology of the synthesised samples was examined by FE-SEM, model JEOL JSM-6700 (Japan). Osmium was coated by spraying it on the sample surfaces using a Hitachi (Japan) fine coat ion sputter E-1010 unit. To avoid the expected charging of the specimens, the coating was performed each time before the FE-SEM observation. The up-conversion emission spectra were recorded using a Princeton triple-grating turret monochromator (Acton SP-2300) equipped with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a personal computer (PC). The samples were irradiated using a 976 nm (CW) laser at different laser powers (i.e., 0.3 to 2.4 W) with a spot size of ∼1.4 mm. For the up-conversion at different temperatures, the laser beam was focused at the edge of the pellet samples, and a thermocouple was placed close to the focal spot. Also for the study of FIR variation with laser power density, the upconversion (UC) spectra of the phosphors were recorded at different excitation power densities at room temperature. Lifetime decay (τ) measurements were carried out by chopping the ∼976 nm laser beam with a mechanical chopper and using a quick start digital oscilloscope.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural analysis

3.1.1 XRD analysis. 
The XRD patterns of Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ (EYYTO) co-doped with Li+ (0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) ions are shown in Fig. 1. All the observed intensity patterns of Li+ co-doped samples matched well with the typical face centred cubic pyrochlore (JCPDS card no. 42-0413).11 The co-doping of Li+ ions did not produce any other impurity phase in the Y2Ti2O7 (YTO) system. The expansion of the main diffraction peak (222) for all Li+ (0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) co-doped samples is shown in Fig. 1(b).
 Fig. 1  XRD pattern of (a) Er3+/Yb3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 and Li+ (2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) co-doped Y2Ti2O7, (b) shifting of (222) peak with Li+ ion concentration, and (c) change in peak position and FWHM of (222) peak in 2θ. 
The peak position corresponding to (222) shifted to a lower angle (2θ) side up to 10 at% Li+, and it shifted to a higher angle side for 15 at% Li+. The peak position of the diffraction peak (222) and full width at half maximum (FWHM) for different Li+ concentrations are shown in Fig. 1(c). The shifting of the main diffraction peak position indicates that Li+ ions can be occupied in both ways either via substitution or entering into interstitial sites of host matrices. Because the effective ionic radii of Li+, Er3+, Yb3+, and Y3+ are ∼0.76, 0.89, 0.985, and 0.9 Å, respectively,27 there is a debate on Li+ co-doped systems: upon Li+ doping, whether Li+ ions can be substituted and/or incorporated into interstitial sites. Parchur et al. reported that YPO4:Eu unit cell volume was significantly enhanced by Li+ co-doping. Moreover, the shifting of main diffraction peaks towards lower angle side (2θ) demonstrates that Li+ ions were incorporated into interstitial sites.18 We have not observed any other phases up to 15 at% doped Li+ into EYYTO samples. The intensity of diffraction patterns increased up to 2 at% Li+ co-doping and then decreased, indicating the association of surface defects on the surface of the samples. To understand the structural changes, Rietveld analysis was performed on the XRD data using the FullProf software.28 The peak profiles were modelled using Pseudo-Voigt function and the background was described in terms of a six-coefficient polynomial. The Rwp (weighted-pattern factor) and S (goodness-of-fit) parameters were used as the numerical criteria for the quality of the calculated fit to the experimental diffraction data. In Y2Ti2O7, there are four different crystallographic axes, namely, Y: (16d), Ti: (16c), O1 (48f), and O2 (8b) assuming that a Ti4+ ion is situated at the origin of the unit cell. The Y and Ti sites have eight and six ion co-ordination sites, respectively, while the crystallographically different axis of oxygen O1 (48f) was co-ordinated to 2Ti and 2Y. O2 (8b) was co-ordinated to 4Y ions, while the third anionic site, O3 (8a), was co-ordinated to the 4Ti ions and generally found to be empty in the ordered pyrochlore lattice.29,30
Because of the change in the peak at lower 2θ upon co-doping of 10 at%, Li+ ions occupy interstitial sites or even the grain boundary. However, we do not see Li2O peaks. This may be due to very low atomic scattering of X-rays from Li+ ions, which is undetectable in our XRD instrument. There will be charge balance after Li+ co-doping in the lattice and this can be compensated by introduction of oxygen vacancy and/or conversion of some Ti4+ ions to Ti3+ ions.31 In this view, we analyse the Rietveld plot of Y2T2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ (Li = 0 at%) (shown in Fig. 2). The detailed structures for Li-codoped samples can be solved by the neutron scattering technique, which will be done in a future study.

Fig. 2 shows the Rietveld refinement of the powder diffraction data of Li+ (0 at%) co-doped EYYTO. The Bragg reflections and the difference in observed and calculated intensities are shown in the figure. In the crystal structure, Y and Ti occupy the special positions with the Fd3m space group (no. 227). Y and Ti atoms occupy the same crystallographic sites (16d and 16c Wyckoff positions). Further, Y is associated with eight ion co-ordination making YO8 polyhedral, while Ti has six ion co-ordinations by forming TiO6 polyhedron. There are two types of oxygen atoms: O1(48f) and O2(8b). The refined parameters e.g., atoms/ions, Wyckoff positions, thermal parameters, and site occupancy and lattice parameters for the Li+ free Y2T2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ sample are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). There are two types of bond involvement in the YO8 group, (Y–O1) and (Y–O2), while the TiO6 group showed only one type of bond (Ti–O1). The bond length of Y–O1 was found to be 2.512 Å, whereas the bond length of Y–O2 was ∼2.185 Å for the Li+ free sample. Selected bond distances and co-ordination numbers of Li+ free Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ obtained from the Rietveld refinement are listed in Table S2 (ESI†).


3.1.2 XPS study. 
To investigate the chemical composition of the material surface, a well-known, extensively used X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) technique was used. All the obtained XPS data of elements were charge corrected with respect to C1s, which appeared at ∼284.6 eV; it arises mainly because of the presence of adventitious carbon during atmospheric exposure. The survey scan of core binding energy (BE) of Y, Ti, O, Er, Yb, and Li in the range 0–1100 eV is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Fig. 3(a)(i)–(vi) shows the XPS spectra of Y(3d) for 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at% Li+ co-doped EYYTO samples obtained in the range 153–162 eV. For Li+-free EYYTO samples, the peak corresponding to Y(3d) had a core BE of ∼156.85 eV (3d5/2) and 158.92 eV (3d3/2) and a FWHM of ∼2.2 and 2.3 eV. Upon increasing Li+ (2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) co-doping concentration, there was a slight change in BE (±0.63 eV) and FWHM (±0.3 eV) corresponding to Y3d5/2 peak towards higher eV within the limits of error bar. Moreover, a very nominal change in BE (±0.59 eV) and FWHM (±0.5 eV) corresponding to the Y3d3/2 peak was observed. These results confirm the +3 formal oxidation state of Y.32 Moreover, the integrated intensity ratio of (3d5/2) to (3d3/2) was found to be ∼1.64, 2.89, 1.54, 0.85, 1.79, and ∼1.74 for 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at% Li+ co-doping, respectively.

The XPS spectra of the core BE of Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 regions (between 455–467 eV) are shown in Fig. 3(b)(i)–(vi). It has been reported in the literature that Ti in its +4 oxidation state has BE values in the range ∼458–460 eV for the 2p3/2 level.33 Notably, diverse BE has been reported for Ti4+ ions. Hence, the energy separation between the O1s and BE of Ti(2p3/2) was investigated to determine the valence state of Ti ions. The energy separation, i.e., (O1s–2p3/2), was found to be in the range 71.3 ± 0.35, demonstrating the +4 oxidation state in the EYYTO sample. Christopher et al.34 reported the XPS study of titanates; the peak at ∼464.1 eV was attributed to the core BE of Ti(2p1/2). Moreover, they also mentioned some satellite peaks at 462.2 and 469.7 eV for 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 levels, respectively. The typical XPS spectra showing the core BE and intensity of Er(4d), Yb(4d), and Li(1s) with Li+ concentration are shown in Fig. S1(b)–(d) (ESI†); their profile peaks matched well with those reported in the literature.33,35,36 Because of the lower concentration of Er3+, Yb3+, and Li+ present in the sample, a comparatively low intensity was observed. The XPS spectra of O1s are used as a probe for investigating the presence of oxygen ion vacancies on the surface of a sample. The peaks were de-convoluted using Lorentzian function. In the case of the Li+-free EYYTO sample, the two peaks well fitted to BE ∼529.7 (P1) and 531.5 eV (P2) with FWHM ∼1.8 and 3.2 eV, respectively. Upon increasing Li+ co-doping, the peak position slightly changed from ±0.08 to 0.5 eV (Fig. 3(c)). Upon Li+ co-doping, all the peaks showed asymmetric behaviour towards higher BE. Moreover, the two peaks, further attributed to the presence of two non-equivalent crystallographic sites, were present in the typical pyrochlore system (A2B2O6O′). Further, the relative area of the P2/P1 ratio of Li+ (0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) EYYTO samples provided an interesting feature, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The ratio of P2/P1 decreased for 2 at% Li+ compared to the Li+-free sample, and it shows an increasing trend for higher at% of Li+ concentration. This is probably because of the creation of oxygen ion vacancies and/or surface defects through the sample surface with the introduction of Li+ ions into the host matrix.36


3.1.3 FTIR studies. 

Fig. 4(a–f) show the FT-IR spectra of Li+ (0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) co-doped Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+. The phonon cut-off energy bands at 417 cm−1 (Y–O1), 463 cm−1 (Y–O2), and at 573 cm−1 (Ti–O1) were almost identical for the samples, dictating the lattice vibrational mode; thus, the multi-phonon non-radiative decay channel was not altered by further doping of Li+ ions. Moreover, the formation of pure phase Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ and Li+ (2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) co-doped Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphors was supported by FTIR analysis.11
 Fig. 4  Measured FT-IR transmission spectra of Y2Ti2O7:Yb3+/Er3+/Li+ co-doped phosphors: (a) 0 at%, (b) 2 at%, (c) 5 at%, (d) 7 at%, (e) 10 at%, and (f) 15 at% Li+ ion. 


3.1.4 Raman analysis. 

Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of Li+ (0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) co-doped Y2Ti2O7. The Raman technique is more sensitive to metal–oxygen vibrational modes and hence probed for the local disorder present in the lattice. Because the pyrochlore can be seen as a superstructure of fluorite induced by the ordering of A and B cations into nonequivalent crystallographic sites and the ordering of anions into three sites 48f, 8a, and 8b the latter remaining empty in a perfectly ordered lattice, a brief description of pyrochlore and fluorite Raman activity is relevant. In a perfect AO2 fluorite (Fm3m space group, Z = 4), only one mode (T2g) is expected, which involves oxygen vibration in the tetrahedral cage formed by four A cations. In A2B2O7 pyrochlores (Fd3m, Z = 8) there are six Raman active modes (A1g, Eg, 4T2g), involving only vibrations of oxygens at both 48f and 8a sites.37 According to group theory irreducible representation Raman spectra reveal pyrochlore structures having six Raman active modes represented as Γ = A1g + Eg + E2g, where symbols represent irreducible group representation. The active Raman bands were A1g, Eg and 4T2g while IR active is 7F1u.38 Sanjuán et al.37 explained the characteristic modes of the YTO pyrochlore observed at 310 cm−1 which has the contributions from Eg and T2g modes. The bands at 515 and 711 cm−1 correspond to A1g mode of vibration and one of the T2g modes of vibration, respectively. The A1g frequency mode provides information about the force constant of the Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlore. The vibration of the TiO6 octahedron is responsible for the A1g mode of vibration of Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlore structure. The major contribution for this mode is mainly due to force constants associated with O–Ti–O bending.37 Recently, Camacho et al.39 studied the Raman spectra of Er3+/Yb3+ doped hybrid materials and reported that the band situated near 368 cm−1 is the metal oxygen (Yb–O) similar to the band at 377 (here 381 cm−1) of (Y–O) stretching vibration, while characteristic peaks of Er–O are found in the range of 500–580 cm−1 and also some small traces of Raman bands near 620–680 cm−1 and 780–900 cm−1 are observed. Vibrational modes observed are most pronounced for 2 at% of Li+ indicating the best crystallinity and hence the best atomic ordering. It is worthwhile to mention that after Li+ co-doping, a slight broadening at 310 cm−1 in the Raman spectra occurs (shown in Fig. 5). Notably, pyrochlore structure bands have been observed for Li+ doped EYYTO samples. It also rules out the phase segregation/change from YTO matrices.
 Fig. 5  Raman spectra of Li+ (0, 2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 at%) co-doped EYYTO. 
Also some additional Raman bands having weak intensity have been observed and these are related to the presence of the vacancies, defects, and foreign ions in the ordered lattice which disrupts the translational symmetry (i.e. k = 0 selection rule is relaxed). Phonons having all parts of the Brillouin zone contributed to the optical spectra, thereby resulting in broad bands. Tyagi and his co-workers have reported the Dy3+ substituted Sm2Zr2O7 and reported the broadening in the Raman spectra after the Dy3+ substitution.40 Even a very broad peak was observed upon heavy doping of Dy3+. However it is not observed in our study upon doping of 15 at% Li+. Still peaks corresponding Raman bands are sharp. It means that Li+ ions do affect pyrochlore structure. Most Li+ ions occupy either interstitial sites or grain boundary, which is predicted by the XRD study. Even, if Li2O is present in particles, it should be seen in Raman spectra. Pure Li2O crystallizes in the anti-fluoride structure and it gives only one allowed Raman band at 523 cm−1.41 This peak is merged with the allowed transition of the Raman band of the Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlore. Thus, we could not distinguish the presence of the Li2O compound even if it is present.
Moreover for the completely ordered pyrochlore (A2B2O7), phase stability of the super structure is predominantly determined by the cationic radius ratio of the site A and B. It has been well documented in the literature that the pyrochlore lattice is supported by a radius ratio, rA/rB. The value of cationic radius ratios varies and lies between 1.46 and 1.78 for ordered pyrochlore structure.40


3.1.5 SEM studies. 

Fig. 6(a) shows the FESEM image of Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+, and the other images (Fig. 6(b)–(f)) represent the morphology of Li+ (2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) co-doped EYYTO. Prominent modification of the microstructure was observed from the micrographs of the Li+ co-doped samples. The Li+-free EYYTO sample corroborates an inhomogeneous uneven morphology. As far as Li+ co-doped EYYTO samples is concerned, 2 at% of the Li+ sample showed the highest roughness compared to higher concentrations of Li+. This indicates that the absorption of input light photons increases with increasing roughness of the sample; thus, the highest emission intensity was observed. Fan et al.42 and Sun et al.43 also proposed that the increased roughness and crystallinity of materials, in the presence of Li+ doping, are among one of the significant reasons for the enhancement in the luminescence intensity of lanthanides. However, further incorporation of Li+ ions in the samples decreased the crystallinity, and the morphology became irregular (as shown in Fig. 6(c)–(f)) with defects induced on the sample surface. The micro-structural properties of the samples play a vital role in PL characteristics, because of the better crystallinity of the host–activator system transferring energy efficiently from the host to the activator, which was further confirmed by the respective PL spectra. Particles exhibit an irregular morphology because of the inherent characteristics of the used solid-state reaction method. Fig. 6(c)–(f) show that the particles almost have polyhedron morphology. From the SEM micrographs, it is evident that the particle size evolution is in the order of microns. For the 15 at% co-doped sample, more uniform spherical microspheres of average diameter in the range ∼0.5–1.5 μm than rough cube-like structures were observed. Moreover, the percentage of rough cube-like structures first increased with Li+ co-doping up to 10 at% and then decreased. This is also supported by the XRD peak broadening (Fig. 1(b)). The histograms of the average particle size distribution of the particles are shown in the figures.

4. Optical studies
4.1 Photoluminescence studies
The up-conversion properties of Li+ (0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) co-doped EYYTO were studied at room temperature under ∼976 nm excitation. The variation in up-conversion emission intensity versus Li+ concentration upon ∼976 nm laser excitation is shown in Fig. 7. The up-conversion intensities show brilliant green emission followed by red emission. Two prominent bands were observed because of the up-conversion at ∼524 and 548 nm, which are responsible for the green emission in the range 500–600 nm with the maximum intensity at ∼548 nm. These two bands can be attributed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 electronic transitions of the Er3+ ion, respectively. Moreover, the band observed in the range 600–700 nm with the maximum intensity at ∼661 nm was assigned to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+.
 Fig. 7  (a) Emission spectra of Li+ (0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 at%) co-doped Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphor under 976 nm excitation. Insets (i) and (ii) show the expansion in 380–500 nm and 750–900 nm. The digital photographs of EYYTO:2Li+ were recorded using a Nikon Coolpix P500 digital camera using a suitable colour filters and (b) shows the integral intensity of green and red bands emission as a function of the concentration of Li+ ions. 
Moreover, the peaks at ∼380, 410, and 487 nm in the near-UV and blue regions of the spectrum with a low intensity are shown in the inset of Fig. 7(a)(i) in the range 380–500 nm. These bands can be attributed to the electronic transitions, namely, the 4G11/2 → 4I15/2, 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F5/2 → 4I15/2 of the Er3+ ion upon 976 nm excitation. The inset (ii) of Fig. 7(a) in the range 750–900 nm, with a well-split Stark pattern of the 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of the Er3+ ion, demonstrates the highly crystalline nature of EYYTO phosphor.11 The variation in up-conversion intensity was observed with Li+ concentration and found to be the maximum for 2 at% Li+ (as shown in Fig. 7(a)). This is probably because the 2 at% Li+-doped EYYTO sample has the most asymmetric environment around the Er3+ ion. For higher concentrations of Li+ (5, 7, 10, and 15 at%), the intensity decreased. This is because of a lower proportion of Li+ incorporation in the host lattice, thus inducing a fast ET from the host to the Er3+ ion. This may create the vacancies that act as the sensitizer, mixing the charge-transfer states. Li+ addition increased the PL intensity by increasing the radiative transition probability. However, an increase in the Li+ concentration over a certain limit generates a significant amount of oxygen ion vacancies in the lattice. Consequently, the crystal lattice collapses, and the luminescence intensity decreases.35 The inset shows the digital photographs of the up-conversion luminescence of EYYTO:2Li under 976 nm excitation using a suitable filter. The fluorescence intensities of the green and red bands were measured, and enhancements of ∼15 and 8 fold were observed for EYYTO:2Li, more than that of the Li+ free EYYTO sample. The integral intensities of 524, 548, and 661 nm bands showed similar trends to Li+ concentrations, corroborating the same up-conversion pathways (Fig. 7(b)). Clearly, the green and red up-converted intensities enhanced drastically with Li+ concentration. The incorporation of Li+ ions in both substitution and/or interstitial sites changed the crystal field and the surrounding environment of Er3+ ions. It was also confirmed by the Rietveld refinement XRD studies of all the measured samples with Li+ concentrations. Moreover, Li+ incorporation may change the electron density.
This change in the environment around Er3+ may provide hypersensitive transitions with the selection rule as follows: |ΔJ| = 2, , and |ΔS| = 0, increasing the population density in the 4S3/2 state and opposing the cross-relaxation and energy back transfer; thus, different folds of enhancement were observed for the green and red up-converted bands.17 The enhanced up-conversion intensity indicates that the incorporation of different concentrations of Li+ ions can modify the local symmetry around Er3+ ions; a further enhancement in Li+ concentration decreased the up-conversion intensity. Li+ ions with smaller ionic radii can readily occupy and/or enter into the interstitial sites of the host by lowering the crystal field symmetry around Er3+ ions. Moreover, the incorporation of Li+ ions into host would create some defects, and oxygen ion vacancies associated with sample surfaces were also confirmed by the XPS study. The oxygen ion vacancies acted as the sensitizer for Ln3+ ions because of the overlapping of charge-transfer states; thus, enhanced PL was observed.44 Moreover, Li+ incorporation may also improve the system crystallinity, lower the surface defects and non-radiative transitions; thus, an enhancement in up-conversion emission intensity was observed. To determine the number of up-converted photons involved in the up-conversion process, the up-conversion luminescence intensity of 2Li+ co-doped EYYTO was measured as a function of pump power. The number of photons required for an unsaturated up-conversion process to populate the upper emitting levels can be well described as follows:45 Iup ∝ InNIR(i)where Iup is the up-conversion emission intensity, INIR is the pump laser intensity, and n is the number of pump photons required for up-conversion process.
The power dependence study of EYYTO:2Li sample is shown in Fig. 8. The slopes (n values) obtained from the linear fitting of the bi-log plots for ∼524, 548, and 661 nm were ∼1.67, 1.97, and 1.61, respectively, with slightly smaller values than the Li+-free EYYTO sample.11 The obtained slope value confirmed that two-photon processes were involved in the observed green and red emissions for both the Li+-doped and Li+-free samples. Moreover, the power dependence was studied for the weak UV and blue bands, i.e., for ∼380, 410, and 487 nm bands, and the slope values were found to be ∼2.65, 2.72, and 2.89, i.e., three-photon processes were involved in these bands, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Because Li+ ions cannot absorb ∼976 nm pump photon energy, ultimately, they are unable to transfer energy to the Er3+ ion, which further confirms that the mechanism of the up-conversion was not affected by the incorporation of Li+ ions. Moreover, the slope values were altered slightly with Li+ ions, with smaller values for green and red emission bands than Er3+/Yb3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 bands.11,17 Smaller n values demonstrated that the involved up-conversion process occurs comparatively easily to saturate Li+ co-doped EYYTO than the Li+-free EYYTO samples. Moreover, the EYYTO:2Li sample emitted green light at a low excitation power density of ∼135 mW mm−2 than EYYTO sample with an excitation power density of ∼152 mW mm−2 under 976 nm excitation, which may trigger photo-chemical reactions occurring in photodynamic therapy. Cheetham and co-workers reported the excitation power densities for (Yb3+, Er3+, and Tm3+) and (Er3+ and Yb3+) doped Y2BaZnO5 with the minimum excitation power of 25 mW mm−2 and 90 mW mm−2, respectively.46

4.2 Energy level diagram and energy transfer
Upon ∼976 nm laser excitation, Er3+ and Yb3+ ions are promoted to their resonant excited states though ground-state absorption (GSA). Because Er3+ ions have a low absorption cross section, the GSA process was found to be weak for Er3+. Yb3+ ions exhibit a nearly seven times higher absorption cross section (∼11.7 × 10−21 cm2) than that of their Er3+ counterpart (∼1.7 × 10−21 cm2).47 Thus, most of the impinging photon energy was absorbed by the Yb3+ ions and further transferred to Er3+ ions via different (ET) processes. The details of the different ET processes for the EYYTO:2Li system are shown in Fig. 9.

4.3 Effect of temperature on up-conversion emission and temperature-sensing behaviour
To investigate the temperature-sensing behaviour of these phosphor (EYYTO:2Li) luminescence materials, the FIR technique was employed. In this technique, the fluorescence emitted from the thermally coupled closely spaced levels to a common final ground state is monitored, and the ratio of the emission intensities of these two bands is calculated as a function of temperature. In the case of Er3+ ions, the two levels, 2H11/2 and 4S3/2, are closely spaced (∼500–600 cm−1) and thermally populated. The FIR of 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels to the ground state (i.e., 4I15/2) of the Er3+ level was applied to study the temperature-sensing behaviour in the temperature range 298–673 K at an excitation power of ∼250 mW. Fig. 10(a) shows the green up-conversion spectra of 2Li+ co-doped EYYTO in the wavelength range 510–580 nm at the measured temperatures of 298 and 673 K. The peak positions of the green up-conversion bands (2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels) did not change; however, the corresponding intensities of these two bands centred at 524 nm and 548 nm varied substantially with the increase in the sample temperature. The fluorescence intensity of the green band centred at 524 nm (2H11/2) is very low compared to the band centred at 548 nm at room temperature (298 K), while at the elevated temperature (673 K), a reverse trend was observed. Thus, the variation in the fluorescence intensity of the two peaks was estimated. According to Maxwell Boltzmann distribution, the photon population density of ions in the two thermally populated levels of Er3+, i.e., for 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 can be expressed as follows:25,48 (ii)where nH, nS, gH, and gS are the corresponding particle densities and degeneracy factors associated with the levels, 2H11/2 and 4S3/2, respectively. ΔE is the energy gap between the two levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. In general, the energy associated with 2H11/2 level is higher than that associated with the 4S3/2 level, i.e., particle density nH is lower than nS, thus, the transition intensity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 is weaker than that of 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 at 298 K, as shown in Fig. 10(a). For high temperature, the energy separation of these two levels requires the 2H11/2 level to be populated by thermal agitation, which in turn provides a higher transition intensity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 than 4S3/2 → 4I15/2. The overall intensity of green band decreases as the sample temperature increases. This is probably because of an enhanced lattice vibration followed by non-radiative decay channel rates. The temperature-dependent up-converted green emission can be attributed to the highly stable spectra in the measured temperature range, i.e., 673 K. Thus, it has great potential in display devices. The relative population density of two thermally populated 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 levels follows the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution, which led to the variation in these two thermally populated levels of fluorescence intensity.

The variation in the FIR of thermally coupled and closely spaced up-conversion bands can be expressed as follows:23,49,50 (iii)where IH, IS, ωH, ωS, σH, and σS are the corresponding intensities, transition frequencies of the associated levels, and the absorption probability rates of 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels to the 4I15/2 level, respectively, while nH, nS, gH, and gS are defined as in eqn (ii). (iv)where B is the pre-exponential factor and ΔE, k, and T have the same meaning as defined in eqn (ii). From the above eqn (iv), clearly FIR is independent of source intensity, which is the prerequisite for any temperature measuring sensing device. The variation in FIR to the relative bands centred at 524 and 548 nm as a function of inverse absolute temperature on a monolog scale is shown in Fig. 10(b). The linear dependency of the curve demonstrates the suitability of the material in temperature-sensing applications.
A fitted slope value obtained by fitting a straight line equation was found to be ∼812 ± 6.24 for the curve shown in the figure. The B value obtained using eqn (iv), for the best curve fitting of the experimental data, is 8.5 (as shown in Fig. 10(c)).
The up-converted intensity of the green band has been monitored at different power densities and it shows that two bands centred at 524 and 548 nm reflect different intensity variation (shown in Fig. S3(a), ESI†). Moreover, the FIR has been monitored as a function of laser input power density at room temperature and it has been observed that variation in these two bands depends on laser input power density (shown in Fig. S3(b), ESI†). As B values vary for different sets of samples eqn (iv) can be modified as: (v)where all the terms has usual meaning as defined above. A similar behaviour was reported for the Eu3+/Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Y2O3 system.51
Furthermore, the rate of the change in FIR with respect to temperature is a prominent parameter to demonstrate the utility of the present material as a temperature sensor, termed as sensor sensitivity52 (S), and defined as follows: (vi)where S is the sensor sensitivity and the other terms have usual meanings as defined earlier.
The sensor sensitivity was calculated using eqn (vi) as a function of the temperatures plotted in Fig. 10(d). The sensor sensitivity enhanced with increasing sample temperature, thus clearly indicating that this material can be used as a temperature-sensing probe. The maximum sensitivity at 363 K was found to be ∼67.32 × 10−4 K−1. Similar studies have been reported by Dong et al.6 for Er-Mo:Yb2Ti2O7 phosphors, with sensitivity of ∼0.0074 K−1 in the temperature range ∼295–610 K. It is worthwhile to compare the sensitivity results of the developed EYYTO:2Li phosphor with similar studies on other materials.53–58 Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+:2Li phosphor is a better material for optical sensors both in terms of temperature range and sensor sensitivity. Moreover, the emission intensities were very stable at the measured temperature, i.e. 673 K, which corroborates its utility at higher temperatures as well. We could not study the performance beyond this temperature range because of instrumental limitations. The results demonstrate that YTO is a good host matrix (melting point ∼1600 °C)59 for up-conversion based phosphors, which can be substantially used in display devices and over wide temperature ranges with high-sensitivity temperature sensors.
4.4 CIE study
The colour perception of the samples is demonstrated by a mathematically defined colour chromaticity diagram (as shown in Fig. 11). Clearly, the Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (CIE) diagram shows that the Li+-co-doping samples lie towards the pure green region. The typical CIE plots of EYYTO and EYYTO:2Li were calculated, indicating that the Li+ co-doped phosphors show better improvement in the purity of green colour emitted from the prepared samples.

4.5 Decay analysis
The decay profile of green band (∼548 nm) 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 for EYYTO:2Li under 976 nm excitation was measured. Fig. 12 shows the normalised decay curve of the ∼548 nm band for the green bands. The decay profile may be well fitted to a mono-exponential function as follows: (vii)where I0 and I are the initial intensity and intensity at time t, respectively A1 is a constant, t is the time, and τ is the decay time of the emitting level. The lifetime of 4S3/2 state was found to be ∼ 548 μs, which is higher than that of the Li+-free EYYTO sample.11 The mono exponential fitting and its residuals are shown in the Fig. 12, inset. The prolonged decay time of EYYTO:2Li can be attributed to the tailored local environment around Er3+ ions.

5. Conclusions
Li co-doped Y2Ti2O7:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphors were synthesized by a solid-state ceramic method. The structures of the phosphors were analysed in detail by Rietveld XRD, XPS, FTIR, FE-SEM, Raman and PL measurements. The XRD study confirmed the pyrochlore phase with a fcc structure. The XPS study revealed the characteristic valence states and associated oxygen vacancies on the sample surface. Raman spectroscopy reveals the surface defects associated with the sample and the structure corroborates with its pyrochlore type feature. Significantly enhanced green and red emissions were observed after introducing Li+ ions, which may tailor the environment of surrounding Er3+ ions. With Li+ ion inclusion, the decay profile of the green bands (548 nm) corroborates the prolonged decay time value as compared to the Li+-free sample. The temperature-dependent FIR study corroborates the applicability of this phosphor material in the development of an optical temperature sensor with high sensitivity over a wide temperature range. The maximum sensitivity was found to be ∼0.0067 K−1 at 363 K. EYYTO:2Li phosphor may be used in the development of an efficient green up-convertor and temperature sensor having a wide temperature range and with high efficacy.
