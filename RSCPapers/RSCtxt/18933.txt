    , Accepted 5th June 2018First published on 5th June 2018AbstractTwo push–pull D–π–A molecules, 3T and DTT as donor materials, were synthesized and characterized for solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The π-linker plays a vital role not only in electrochemical and thermal properties but also affects the thin film morphology of 3T and DTT. 3T showed the high electrochemical stability with a faster electrode reaction rate. The solution-processed OPV devices based on 3T showed higher power conversion efficiencies than DTT-based devices because of its superior electrochemical properties.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have drawn much attention because of their simplicity and low cost in large area fabrication process.1–3 Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPV devices is lower than that of inorganic solar cells, small molecule-based OPV materials have great potential in terms of their versatility of structural variations and tunable optical and electrical properties.1,4 A key feature of OPV materials mainly depends on the π-conjugated structure. Push–pull D–π–A molecules end-capped with an electron donor and an electron acceptor can have a low-energy band gap as well as a broad absorption range resulting from intramolecular charge transfer.5–8 In fact, the structure of the π-linker has considerable effect on the optical and electronic properties of donor–acceptor push–pull molecules with a π-linker.9,10 Recently, several groups have reported the relationship between the π-linker and OPV device performance.11–13
Herein, we report the effect of the π-linker on electrochemical, thermal and morphological properties of push–pull-type D–π–A molecules incorporating different π-linkers, where triphenylamine is employed as a donor moiety, and dicyanomethylene-appended indanone as an acceptor moiety, and terthiophene or dithienothiophene with two thiophene moieties at its both ends as a π-linker. Alkyl chains are introduced to the π-linker for solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPV devices. We also investigate the effect of the π-linker on the device performance of OPVs fabricated by blending the donor material with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor for the BHJ structure based active layer.

Instrument

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, acetone-d6 or DMSO-d6 using Avance 300 and 400 MHz Bruker spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained using a GC-MS spectrometer (JEOL, JMS-700). The optical properties were characterized by absorption (Beckman, DU650) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Jasco, FP-7500 spectrophotometer). The electrochemical properties were obtained using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) (CH instruments, 650B electrochemical analyzer). The electrochemical cell consists of three electrodes (a reference electrode, Ag/Ag+ 0.01 M, a counter electrode (Pt) and a working electrode (Pt)) in dichloromethane containing 0.1 mM 3T or DTT as a redox material and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M TBAPF6) as a supporting electrolyte. All potentials were calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple.15 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to obtain HOMO/LUMO energy levels of 3T and DTT using the Gaussian B3LYP/6-31G (Gaussian 09 Rev. B01). Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Veeco, NanoScope IV) images were acquired using a scan rate of 1 Hz under ambient atmosphere. All the samples were prepared by spin-casting onto ITO/glass substrate. The film thickness of organic layers was measured using alpha-step (KLA Tencor). Thermal properties of the synthesized materials were obtained using a thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA) (TA instruments, Q-5000 IR) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (TA instrument, DSC-Q1000). Elemental analysis was performed with the Thermo Fisher Scientific Elemental Analyser (Flash 2000).
Fabrication and characterization of organic photovoltaic devices
Device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor (3T or DTT):PC71BM/LiF/Al was used to investigate the OPV device performance. Pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO, 13 ohm sq−1) on glass was cleaned by carrying out sequential ultrasonication in deionized water (10 min), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (10 min), followed by UV ozone treatment for 5 min. PEDOT:PSS (P) was spin-coated onto ITO to prepare the hole transport layer (HTL). Post-annealing process was conducted at 120 °C for 20 min. Photoactive layers were spin-coated from a mixture of chlorobenzene and chloroform (1:0.2 v/v) containing various weight ratios (1:1, 1:1.5, 1:1.75, 1:2 and 1:3) of each donor and PC71BM in a glove box. Thermal annealing treatment was conducted for the photoactive layer thin films of DTT:PC71BM (120 °C to 200 °C) Finally, LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally evaporated under 10−6 torr as cathode electrode. The active area is 4 mm2. A reference device was fabricated using 2.0 wt% of P3HT:PC61BM (1:0.8 w/w) active layer in chlorobenzene solution in a glove box under the same conditions. PEDOT:PSS organogels with carbon dots (0.19 wt% @IPA) were prepared according to the literature procedure.16 The current–voltage characteristics of OPV devices were determined using a Keithley 2400 source meter and an AM1.5 simulated white light source. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a 1000 W Xe lamp (Oriel) combined with a calibrated monochromator (Acton research). The intensity of the monochromatic light was calibrated with a silicon photodiode (Newport).

Two donor molecules 3T and DTT were synthesized according to Scheme 1 and were fully characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry. Dicyanomethylene-appended indanone and triphenylamine were used as an acceptor and a donor, respectively. Terthiophene or dithienothiophene (DTT) with two thiophene moieties at its both ends acted as a π-linker to connect the donor and acceptor units, as shown in Scheme 1. To confirm electronic structures of DTT and 3T, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian B3LYP/6-31G (Fig. 1). The degree of overlap of 3T between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was more than that of DTT. This implies that 3T has stronger intramolecular interaction than DTT due to better electronic coupling.17,18

Photophysical properties
Optical properties of 3T and DTT were investigated by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy in dichloromethane solution and in spin-cast thin film as shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1. The UV/vis spectra of both molecules in solution state exhibited almost the same absorption range and shape. The absorption peak at 300 nm was from n–π* electronic transition bands of the triphenylamine moiety. The absorption peak at 380 nm was from π–π* transition bands of the π-linker.19 The long wavelength region of the absorption peak around 605 nm would originate from intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor moieties. Compared to the solution state, the broad band and red-shifted absorption spectra were observed in spin-cast thin films due to stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state. As expected, the thin film of DTT with a rigid dithienothiophene moiety showed stronger π–π interaction than the 3T thin film, resulting in red shift of the π–π* transition band from 393 nm to 462 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images revealed that the DTT thin film showed well-ordered nanostructure morphology, while the 3T thin film showed less-ordered surface morphology (Fig. S1, ESI†). This means that the π-linker can affect the packing of D–π–A molecules in the thin films and the electronic transitions. As shown in Fig. 2b, the maximum absorption peak in the long wavelength region of 3T was red-shifted (from 587 to 620 nm) with increasing solvent.20 The solvatochromic effect indicates that 3T has higher dipole moments in the excited state.

Thermal properties
Thermal properties of 3T and DTT were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). DTT exhibited higher thermal stability than 3T. The higher melting temperature (Tm) of DTT would suppress its degradation during thermal annealing processing of OPV devices. This result implies that the rigid dithienothiophene moiety in the π-linker of DTT can contribute to the thermal stability.21
Electrochemical properties
In order to investigate the electrode reaction rate and stability of redox couples of 3T and DTT, electrochemical experiments were performed. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed two quasi-reversible oxidative potentials in both molecules in tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M TBAPF6) as a supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane solution at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†). The electrochemical data were presented in Table 2. Their HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated from CV measurements and absorption spectra. The first oxidation potentials (E0ox) of 3T and DTT, estimated by the onset potential, were 0.34 and 0.28 eV, respectively versus the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+).15 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 3T and DTT were almost identical. Redox reactions showed that the peak current ratio (ipc/ipa) and peak-to-peak separation (ΔEpp) for 3T were 0.86 and 0.09 V, whereas those for DTT were 0.54 and 0.09 V, respectively. This means that 3T is more electrochemically stable than DTT during the oxidative process. Diffusion coefficient (D0) and electrode reaction rate (k0) of 3T and DTT were measured according to eqn (1) by chronocoulometry.22 (1)where Q is charge of an electrochemical reaction of the redox material, F is the Faraday constant, A is the electrode surface area, D0 and C0* are the diffusion coefficient and the concentration of the redox materials, respectively. The surface area (A) of the Pt disk electrode was determined using the known value of D0, 2.4 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 of ferrocence and eqn (1).22 The k0, related to electron transfer between the redox species and the electrode, was calculated from eqn (2).23 (2)

The parameters of mass transfer D0 and k0 were summarized in Table 2. The D0 values of 3T and DTT were similar, but the k0 value of 3T (1.0 × 10−1 cm−1) was higher than that of DTT (0.7 × 10−1 cm−1). This indicates that 3T has faster electron transfer rate than DTT. These results support that the designed π-linker do not affect the energy band gap (Eg, Table 1), but affect morphology properties in the solid state as well as electrochemical properties in the solution state. 3T with a more stable redox state and faster k0 is expected to improve the efficiency of OPV devices compared to DTT.24–28
Photovoltaic device performances of BHJ structures

3T and DTT were applied as donor materials in the active layer of BHJ OPV devices. The active layers comprising 3T or DTT and PC71BM with 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:1.75 and 1:2 weight ratios (donor:PC71BM w/w) were made by spin-cast method. Performance characteristics of the OPV devices are summarized in Table 3 and Table S2 (ESI†). The PCE increased with increasing the PC71BM weight ratio up to 1:1.75 weight ratio in the active layer. The optimal weight ratio for the best device performance was 1:1.75 as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). These results suggest that the concentration of PC71BM in the active layer is responsible for sufficient phase separation to generate percolation pathways of carriers.29 If phase separation is improperly formed, the OPV devices would result in bad performance owing to the geminate and nongeminate recombination,30–32 which generally increases the series resistance (Rs) and decreases the shunt resistance (Rsh), resulting in a decrease in the FF values of OPV devices.33,34 Push–pull D–π–A molecules tend to aggregate and be stabilized in thin films leading to the small donor–acceptor interfacial area.7,35 As a result, the FF values of 3T and DTT-based OPV devices were decreased by the geminate recombination.36 Although the photogenerated excitons from donor molecules decreased when using high weight ratio of PC71BM in the active layer as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the blended PC71BM prevented agglomeration of donor molecules (see Fig. S1(b) and Fig. 4(b), ESI†), leading to a notable increase in the Jsc values as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). As a result, the morphology of thin films based on 3T and DTT seemed to be influenced by the concentration of PC71BM, leading to varying Voc values with the PC71BM concentration. To further understand why the Voc values of DTT-based OPV devices were largely affected by the little change of donor/acceptor ratios, the performance of BHJ devices based on DTT was investigated according to the active layer thickness. The thickness of active layers was controlled by varying the spin casting speed from 700 to 3000 rpm and measured by profilometry. The resulting J–V curves for the different thicknesses of active layers were displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The observed Voc, Jsc, and PCE values decreased with decreasing active layer thickness (see Table S4, ESI†). This indicates that both thickness and morphology of the active layer should be considered for the optimized performance of OPV devices.37–39 We carried out thermal annealing treatment to understand about how the π-linker affects the morphology of the thin film. Interestingly, the performance of DTT-based OPV devices was improved with thermal annealing treatment of the active layer (Table S3, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4, the surface roughness of the DTT thin film decreased from 0.448 to 0.235 nm with thermal annealing treatment. The PCE of the DTT-derived OPV device increased from 1.81% to 2.38% after thermal annealing treatment at 150 °C for 10 min (Fig. 3a), while that of the OPV device using 3T decreased with thermal annealing treatment (Fig. S6 and Table S5, ESI†). These results indicate that the thin film morphology of DTT has significant influence on the device performance compared to 3T. External quantum efficiency (EQE) of OPV devices was measured and the results were consistent with the PCE values of OPV devices. Interestingly, when the PEDOT:PSS organogels incorporating carbon dots were introduced as the HTL of 3T:PC71BM (1:1.75 w/w) OPV devices, the device performance showed 34% (from 2.58% to 3.47%) increase in the PCE presumably because the organogel thin film induced the formation of interconnected structure into the PEDOT-rich domains, improving the electrical conductivity (Fig. 3a and Table 3).16

Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized two push–pull donor molecules incorporating different π-linker structures for efficient OPVs. Two donor molecules have similar HOMO, LUMO energy levels and band gaps. DTT having a rigid dithienothiophene moiety in the π-linker showed high thermal stability and well-ordered nanostructure morphology in the solid state, while 3T having a terthiophene π-linker showed the high electrochemical stability with a faster electrode reaction rate (k0). The solution-processed BHJ OPV devices based on 3T exhibited higher PCEs than DTT-based devices because of its superior electrochemical properties. It appears that the elaborate design of the π-linker should be considered for the development of high performance push–pull structure-based OPV devices.
