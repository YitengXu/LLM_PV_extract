    , Accepted 31st May 2022First published on 2nd June 2022AbstractThe shortage of freshwater resources caused by heavy metal pollution is an acute global issue. Herein, a novel nanoplatform was fabricated by hydrothermal deposition of 3D-MoS2 nanospheres onto biocompatible wood sponge (WS) for Hg(II) removal. Moreover, a secondary water purification strategy was investigated to produce drinkable water using the exhausted wood sponge. The exhausted MoS2-wood sponge (MWS) was used to construct a solar steam generator by wrapping with a hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer to prevent heavy metal ion leakage and to enhance the hydrophilicity. The energy conversion efficiency of the evaporator was calculated to be 95.48% under one sun illumination. Remarkably, the treatment of model desulphurization wastewater from power plants with this functional wood sponge could efficiently reduce the mercury concentration below the limit proposed by the World Health Organization for drinking water. These results provide a basis for the application of upcycled hazardous adsorbents for the purification of drinkable water.

Environmental significance
Heavy metal contamination of water is a significant environmental concern for public health. Hg(II) is one of the priority poisonous pollutants generated by many different industries, and its uncontrolled release into the environment can lead to the serious damage of human organs such as the kidney, liver, and lungs. Remediation and removal of Hg(II) has been achieved using adsorption-based materials. As such we developed a 3D-MoS2 based wood sponge for efficient Hg(II) removal from wastewater and then upcycled the exhausted absorbents to generate drinkable water by solar steam purification. Our multifunctional material provides a new approach for environmental remediation.

1 Introduction
With the rapid rates of urbanization and industrialization, the demand for fresh water globally is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050.1,2 However, the quality of our water is getting worse, especially due to heavy metal contamination. For example, mercury (Hg) is a widely distributed pollutant that can harm organisms at trace concentrations.3 Especially, the organic form of mercury, i.e., methylmercury, accumulates at the lower trophic levels of the food chain and then gradually magnifies up the food chain, eventually resulting in serious damage to human organs.4,5 Therefore, there is an urgent need for functional materials to efficiently remove Hg2+ from wastewater. Among the various purification technologies, adsorption has been widely employed due to low operation cost and simplicity of design. The mercury from water can be transferred to the solid phase after adsorption, which avoids the formation of highly toxic methyl mercury.6,7
Biomass materials as adsorbents have a promising future due to their natural abundance, low cost, biodegradability and are environmentally benign. Wood is a natural composite material that consists of a cellulose framework, hemicellulose, and lignin,8 which makes it easy to be converted into porous adsorbents by the selective removal of the hemicellulose and lignin from the cellulose framework.9 Chemical treatment leads to the emergence of a layered wood sponge structure, while the alignment of cellulose nanofibers is preserved.10 Layered structures facilitate the diffusion of metal ions. Moreover, a layered structure provides the wood sponge with high porosity and enhanced capillary effects, which enables the use of wood sponge in the field of solar steam generation.11,12 Considering the many benefits of wood sponge, the layered structure facilitates encapsulation of nanoparticles which represents a feasible method to construct 3D porous materials. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a two-dimensional (2D) material which has been widely used as adsorbents because of the powerful interaction between mercury and sulfur, resulting in the remarkable adsorption capacity of MoS2.13,14 Meanwhile, 3D-nanoflowers of MoS2 also exhibit large sulfur-rich surfaces which significantly improve the surface adsorption capacity and active surface area, thus promoting Hg2+ coordination in contaminated water.15,16 When MoS2 is loaded on to the wood sponge, the open structure enhances the number of sulfur sites and results in improved removal efficiency for Hg2+. Additionally, due to the water channels within the wood sponge, water can be transported from the bottom to top by capillary force.
Significantly, traditional wastewater purification processes do not meet the WHO standards and as such can not solve the crisis of drinking water shortages. Moreover, the exhausted absorbents present hazardous waste disposal problems in that these absorbents will be transferred to a solid waste landfill. However, the toxic metals contained in these adsorbents may leak into the soil and groundwater, causing secondary pollution to the environment. Therefore, these issues have driven the development of a secondary purification strategy to upcycle such harmful materials to be able to produce drinking water. In particular, solar steam generation can reutilize waste materials using plentiful, sustainable and environment-friendly solar energy. In recent years, many photothermal materials have been investigated as solar evaporators including carbonaceous materials,17,18 plasmonic structures,19 biomass-based20–22 and polymeric materials.23 Meanwhile, some multifunctionality evaporators with better solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency have been reported.24,25 Owing to the 3D layered structure of the wood sponge, the hazardous waste adsorbent can be modified with a hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer to avoid any heavy metals leaking and improve the hydrophilicity of the photothermal materials. These systems can be used for photothermal conversion and secondary desalination to generate drinking water.26,27 Such methods are particularly useful in that they facilitate the recycling of hazardous waste for solar-driven wastewater purification (i.e., desulfurization wastewater).
Economic growth, is intimately coupled with demands for electricity, resulting in the construction of more power plants. Among the numerous methods, the wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process has been reported to be the most popular method for the desulfurization in coal-burning power plants, especially in China.28 Therefore, a large amount of desulfurization wastewater including highly toxic Hg2+ is produced, which can exacerbate the drinking water crisis.29 New purification technologies are urgently needed. However, the major limitation for emerging technologies is the high cost, and the complexity of the process.30 As a result, secondary desalination is a potential low-cost technology for wastewater treatment.
Here, we immobilize 3D-MoS2 nanoparticles into a biocompatible wood sponge via a simple hydrothermal process for the elimination of mercury ions from wastewater. The MoS2 loaded wood sponge exhibits excellent adsorption efficiency for Hg2+. In addition, the consumed materials were successfully functionalized with a hydrophilic PVA layer and then reused for generation of solar steam to generate freshwater from wastewater, such as desulfurization wastewater, therefore, providing a high-performance candidate to turn hazardous adsorbents into useful resources (Scheme 1).

Ltd., AR, ≥98%), deionized water (DI-water) was produced using a RO-400G Standard ultrapure water system and used for all experiments. The balsa wood was purchased from Hefengchonglin Wooden Crafts Co., Ltd. The deionized water was used in all experiments.
2.2 Preparation of MoS2-wood sponges (MWS)

2.2.1 Synthesis of wood sponges. 
Balsa wood (2 × 2 × x cm, x = 0.5, 0.7 and 1) pieces were first processed using a solution of 2.0 wt% NaClO2 for 8 h at 80 °C, and then the pH was adjusted to 4.6 with acetic acid. Subsequently, to remove the hemicellulose fraction, the treated wood samples were further treated with an 8% NaOH solution at the same temperature as the first step for 8 h. The treated samples were then rinsed with deionized water and EtOH to remove the residual chemicals. Finally, the samples were treated at −37 °C using a freeze-dryer to generate wood sponges.


2.2.2 Preparation of MoS2-wood sponges. 
MoS2-Wood sponges were successfully prepared using the hydrothermal method. The particular preparation route is as follows: 1.07 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 0.88 g thioacetamide were added into deionized water and stirred for 30 min. The mixture and wood sponges were transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined hydrothermal kettle and reacted at 200 °C for 24 h. The samples were then washed and centrifugated with deionized water and absolute ethanol 5 times to generate the MWS.

2.3 Adsorption measurements
The effect of different parameters such as the initial pH (1.0–6.0) was evaluated, the optimum pH value was adopted for all the following experiments. The adsorption tests were carried on using varying initial Hg(II) concentrations (10 mL, 10 to 500 mg L−1), various temperatures (298.15, 318.15, 338.15 K) and specific contact times (1–180 min), at a fixed adsorbent dosage of 10 mg. The effect of different parameters such as the different concentrations (10–500 mg L−1), and pH (1.0–6.0) were evaluated. The adsorbed capacity (Qe) and the adsorption efficiency (E) towards heavy metals for the MWS were calculated using eqn (1) and (2): (1) (2)where C0 is the initial concentration (mg L−1) and Ce is the equilibrium concentration (mg L−1) of the metal ion solutions. V (L) is the volume of MWS solution for the adsorption and m (g) is the mass of the MWS.

2.3.1 Adsorption kinetics. 
The adsorption kinetics of the absorbent were evaluated using MWS of 10 mg and an initial Hg(II) concentration of 50 mg L−1 at a pH of 5.0 and temperature of 298.15 K.
The kinetic models were used to understand the mechanism of adsorption with the MWS. The models are expressed in eqn (3) and (4): ln(Qe − Qt) = lnQe − k1t(3) (4)where Qt (mg g−1) represent the adsorption capacity in a corresponding contact time t (min); k1 (min−1) and k2 (g mg−1 min−1) are the kinetic models rate constants.


2.3.2 Adsorption isotherm models. 
In order to investigate the effect of temperature on adsorption, the adsorption experiments were performed at 298.15, 318.15 and 338.15 K. The equations used for the Langmuir and Freundlich models, respectively, are as follows: (5) (6)where Qe indicate the equilibrium adsorbed amount of Hg(II) by MWS (mg g−1); Qm indicate the maximum adsorption capacity (mg g−1); Ce is the concentration of Hg(II) (mg L−1); KL and KF are isotherm model constants; n is the Freundlich empirical constant.


2.3.3 Thermodynamic analysis. 
For the purpose of investigating the temperature of the adsorption process of MWS, the adsorption process was examined at 298.15, 318.15 and 338.15 K. The van't Hoff equation was used to describe the thermodynamic values such as Gibbs free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS); the equations used are as follows: (7) ΔG = −RTlnKc(8) (9) ΔG = ΔH − TΔS(10)where Kc express the partition coefficient (mL g−1); Ca express the adsorbed amount of Hg(II) by MWS (mg g−1); T express temperature (K); R = 8.314 J mol−1 K−1 is the gas constant.


2.3.4 Adsorption test in bimetal systems. 
The adsorption experiments were conducted using two groups of Hg2+/Pb2+ and Hg2+/Cd2+. Where, the concentration of bimetallic mixed solutions was varied from 10 mg L−1 to 600 mg L−1. While, the ratio of the two metal ions in the solution was fixed at 1:1.


2.3.5 Competitive adsorption of Hg(II), Pb(II), Cd(II) ions by MWS. 
10 mg of MWS was mixed with of a mixed ternary solutions containing Hg(II), Pb(II), Cd(II) ions (pH = 1.7) over a range from 10–200 mg L−1 with the ratio of three metal ions fixed at 1:1:1. The sample shaken for 4 h at an ambient temperature of 298.15 K.

2.4 Preparation of PVA-MoS2-wood sponge-Hg2+
Briefly, 0.5 g of PVA and 35 mL of H2O were added into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask and dissolved for 60 min at 90 °C. Then the MWS-Hg2+ was immersed into above solution and heated at 80 °C for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ was obtained.
2.5 Solar steam generation
The PVA-MWS-Hg2+ was placed in a crystallizing dish (50 cm in diameter) with water (30 mL). In general, the water evaporation experiments were using an optical simulator at one solar flux (1 kW m−2), unless otherwise stated. The experiments were carried out at room temperature and humidity of 50%. In this experiment, the solar flux of the system was measured using an optical power meter. The mass change was measured using an electronic balance.

2.5.1 Solar steam generation efficiency. 
The energy efficiency (η) can be evaluated by eqn (11) (11)where η is the energy efficiency; m represents the evaporation rate; hLV represents the vaporization enthalpy of the water in the samples (1848 J g−1 for PVA-MWS-Hg2+);18Copt is the solar illumination intensity; qi is the regular solar irradiation (1 kW m−2).

2.6 Characterization of MWS and PVA-MWS-Hg2+
The morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopic images (SEM, Hitachi-s4800). The chemical composition of the sample was analyzed using the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). Heavy metal concentrations were determined using an AFS-933 atomic fluorescence photometer and ICP-OES. In addition, the XRD, water contact angle and UV-vis of different samples were analyzed.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization of MoS2-wood sponge
As a natural and renewable resource, balsa wood (BW) was selected to develop a functional wood sponge (WS) due to the following advantages which include low cost, low density and ability to regulate porosity.31 As shown in Fig. 1(b), natural balsa wood has many aligned channels in the x–z direction.32 The aligned channels turn into a laminar morphology after the thin cell walls of the balsa wood are disintegrated by the chemical treatment (Fig. 1(c) and S1†). The freeze-drying process results in cell rupture and crumpling.10 Using a hydrothermal method, MoS2 was successfully coated on to the wood sponge, which can be clearly visualized in the x–z direction (Fig. 1(d)). The wood sponge becomes black, confirming the successfully synthesis and coating with MoS2 nanoflowers. Fig. 1(e) shows the TEM image of the MoS2 nanoflowers with irregular edges. The appearance of irregular surfaces, improves surface adsorption capacity and active surface area.33,34Fig. 1(f) shows the XRD patterns of the WS and MWS. The peaks at 9.03° and 18.0° correspond to the characteristic (002) and second-order (004) diffraction peaks of metallic MoS2, respectively.35,36 Meanwhile, the weak diffraction of the (101) and (110) plane imply low crystallinity of metallic MoS2. These results confirmed that metallic MoS2 has been successfully loaded on the wood sponge.37,38 BET measurements (Fig. S2†) confirmed numerous nanoscale pores (distributed around 4 nm) appeared after the balsa wood was fabricated into MWS. In addition, the specific surface area of MWS were determined as 63.5410 m2 g−1, which was higher than that of balsa wood (1.0954 m2 g−1) and wood sponge (49.5570 m2 g−1). The porous structure of MWS facilitates an increase in the adsorption capacity.9

3.2 Adsorption properties for Hg(II) ions
Initially, the adsorption experiments for wood sponge and MWS samples with distinct Mo/S ratios (molar ratios of molybdenum source to sulfur source: 1:2; 1:3; 1:4; 1:5, respectively) were used to evaluate the influence on the adsorption capacity. From Fig. 2(a) with a Mo/S ratio of 1/4 the adsorption plateaus. Therefore, we chose a Mo/S ratio of 1/4 for subsequent experiments. The pH of the mercury solutions is important for adsorption. Fig. 2(b) illustrates the adsorption capacity of Hg2+ with MWS over a pH range from 1.0 to 6.0. When the pH value increased from 1.0 to 2.0, the adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity increased significantly and achieved a maximum at a pH of 5.0. With a low pH value, the relatively high H+ in solution could compete with Hg2+ for active sites, leading to a reduced adsorption capacity.39 Thus, a pH of 5.0 was selected for subsequent experiments. Fig. 2(c) illustrates as a function of time the adsorption of Hg2+ with MWS. MWS initially exhibited a rapid Hg2+ removal rate, and then plateaued within 60 min. Adsorption kinetics of Hg2+ ions to simulate the adsorption process, and the linear fitting curves are given in Fig. 2(c) and S3 and Table S1.† According to good R2, the pseudo-second-order model was suitable to describe the experimental data, indicating that the chemisorption process is primarily controlling the adsorption processes of Hg2+.1,40

Meanwhile, the adsorption isotherms of Hg2+ with MWS were evaluated at three different temperatures and the results are given in Fig. 2(d) and S4 and Table S2.† The results indicate that the adsorption capacity of MWS increased gradually within increasing temperature. The maximum adsorption capacity of MWS for Hg2+ was observed at 338.15 K. The results indicate that the adsorption of Hg2+ onto MWS fitted a Langmuir model, suggesting the adsorption of Hg2+ is monolayer adsorption. Calculation of thermodynamic parameters (Table S3†), provided a positive value of ΔH which indicates that the process of MWS adsorption of Hg(II) is endothermic. The observed trend in ΔG values with an increase in temperature, indicates that a high temperature is beneficial to the adsorption process.41
The competitive Langmuir model was applied to fit the adsorption of the binary solutions consisting of Hg2+/Cd2+ and Hg2+/Pb2+.42 The results are given in Table S4.† The Qmix/Q0 values calculated range from 0.45 to 2.03, which indicates that the synergistic and antagonistic effect exist at the same time for the binary adsorption process.43–45 The Marquardt's percent standard deviation (MPSD) value of the isotherm model ranges from 3.09 to 17.92. The model accuracy was established by comparisons of theoretical and experimental values as shown in Fig. 2(e). The competitive adsorption experiments of the ternary systems indicated affinity in the order of Hg2+ > Pb2+ > Cd2+ (Fig. 2(f)), which was consistent with the single systems. Meanwhile, compared with the single metal adsorption, the adsorption capacity for Hg2+ in ternary solution is lower than that in the single system, indicating that there is an antagonistic influence in the process of adsorption in ternary solutions.46,47
3.3 Investigation of the adsorption mechanism
The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 3(a)) indicated that the MoS2 was deposited on wood sponge. The EDS mapping provides evidence that most of the Hg2+ ions were adsorbed by the MWS. The adsorption of Hg2+ was evaluated using the FT-IR spectra of MWS and MWS-Hg2+ as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). For Hg2+ loaded MWS, new bands at 616 cm−1 emerged. These new peaks may be attributed to Hg–S, revealing the successful adsorption of Hg2+ and MoS2.48 XPS was performed to further reveal the adsorption mechanism of Hg2+ with MWS. The peak of Hg4f can be detected after adsorption (Fig. 3(c)). Fig. 3(d) represents the high resolution XPS spectrum of Mo3d,15 which can be deconvoluted into four peak components.49 The characteristic doublet peak at 228.7 and 232.80 eV were attributed to Mo(IV) and the two peaks at 231.7 and 235.9 eV were attributed to Mo(VI), which confirmed that most of the Mo is present as Mo(IV). In addition, the presence of Mo(VI) was attributed to the surface oxidation of 3D-MoS2 and the generation of MoO3 during hydrothermal synthesis.50–52Fig. 3(e) shows the Hg4f spectrum, which can be classified into two groups of doublet peaks.53–55 The two groups of doublet peaks can be attributed to HgS and HgO, corresponding to 100.9, 104.9 eV and 102.3 and 106.3 eV, respectively. The stronger peaks observed for HgS indicate that the S in the MWS are the main sites for the adsorption of Hg2+.56 Seen from Fig. 3(f) the S2p XPS spectra of MoS2 are divided into four peaks, S2p 3/2 of 161.8 eV and S2p 1/2 of 163.1 eV. The peak at 161.8 eV was attributed to the S2p 3/2 of HgS, which also suggests the S are involved in the adsorption of Hg2+ ions. The peak of SO32− appears at 168.3 eV, indicating that the sulfur is oxidized at the edges of the MWS.57 Peaks for the O1s spectrum in Fig. 3(g) can be deconvoluted into two peaks, the MoO3 peak at 530.9 eV and HgO peak at 532.7 eV. The peak at 530.9 eV indicated that Mo(VI) was present, and the peak at 532.7 eV in the O1s spectrum indicated an interaction between Hg and O.53 No obvious changes of Mo3d were found before and after adsorption of mercury (Fig. S5†). Or to put it more concisely, the MWS contains S sites that interact with the Hg(II), leading to the high adsorption capacity of MWS.

3.4 Exhausted PVA-MWS adsorbents upcycled for solar steam generation
Due to hazardous waste disposal issues, and the demand for landfill treatment has led to severe environmental concerns. Therefore, solar-to-thermal technology has become an approach that has been used to recycle exhausted adsorbents. First, PVA-MWS-Hg2+ is synthesized by wrapping MWS-Hg2+ with a hydrophilic PVA layer. The PVA layer prevents the heavy metals from leaking. Meanwhile, the PVA significantly improves the hydrophilicity of the MWS-Hg2+ and promotes water transport.58Fig. 4(a) illustrates the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ preparation process. The SEM image on the right of Fig. 4(a) shows that the surface is covered with PVA. Contact angle experiments confirmed that the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ was hydrophilic, since a water droplet permeated into the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ within 1.8 s. In contrast, when a drop of water falls on the surface of non-coated MWS-Hg2+, it remains on the surface for at least 10 seconds (Fig. 4(b)). This result confirms the high-water transportability of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ due to loading with hydrophilic PVA. Fig. 4(c) shows the water mass loss of pure water under dark conditions. This experiment illustrates the inherent evaporation ability of PVA-MWS-Hg2+. Water alone had higher equivalent enthalpy than water treated with various samples including BW, WS, MWS, MWS-Hg2+ and PVA-MWS-Hg2+, indicating the lamellar structure of wood sponge was conducive to decreasing equivalent enthalpy (Fig. 4(c)).59 Previous research has indicated that PVA could effectively reduce the hydrogen bonding between water molecules thereby reducing the enthalpy for vaporization of water. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the PVA mainly contributes to the strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules.60 The equivalent enthalpy suggests that the MWS treated with PVA does result in a reduction in the required evaporation energy. In order to further evaluate the light absorption and photothermal conversion capability of the sample, the UV-vis-NIR and surface temperature changes under irradiation were assessed. The UV-vis-NIR reveals that compared to balsa wood, PVA-MWS-Hg2+ exhibits better optical absorption properties (Fig. 4(d) and S6†).61,62 Seen from Fig. 4(e), the surface temperature of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ increases rapidly from 25 °C to 50 °C under the one sun solar irradiation and reaches 40 °C within 10 minutes. From Fig. S7 and S8,† the surface temperature of water without the samples is basically unchanged under 1 sun irradiation. In contrast, the surface temperatures of other samples increased slightly. The surface temperature of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ can reach up to 50 °C. The test demonstrates that the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ can efficiently convert solar energy to thermal energy. In addition, the thermal conductivity of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ was evaluated. Results indicate that the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ has a thermal conductivity of 0.25 W m−1 K−1, which can help decrease thermal loss during solar evaporation.63 Furthermore, influence of thickness on the water evaporation was also explored using various thicknesses of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ of 5.0, 7.0 and 10.0 mm (Fig. S9†). The net water evaporation rates of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ at thicknesses of 5.0, 7.0 and 10.0 mm are 1.10, 1.29 and 1.86 kg m−2 h−1, respectively. Indicating that the thickness is proportional to the amount of water evaporation.61 Given its hydrophilic and efficient light absorption, PVA-MWS-Hg2+ was then used for solar-powered desalination. Initially, the weight loss of water against irradiation time was determined to evaluate the steam generation efficiency of different samples. Fig. 4(f) indicates that the evaporation rate of MWS-Hg2+ was higher than other samples, which was calculated to be 1.10 kg m−2 h−1. In contrast, the highest evaporation rates were for PVA-MWS-Hg2+, implying an improved performance for PVA-MWS-Hg2+. The evaporation rate of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ under 1 sun irradiation was 1.86 kg m−2 h−1. Compared with other samples, PVA-MWS-Hg2+ exhibits enhanced performance for solar-to-steam conversion, which may be attributed to the improved hydrophilicity of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ when compared with MWS-Hg2+. The water evaporation capacity of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ was determined by changing the light intensity. Fig. 4(g) confirms that the evaporation rate increases with increasing solar intensity. The surface temperature of the sample also increased as a function of light intensity (Fig. S10†). During 10 reuse cycles, the evaporation rate remains stable dropping slightly to 1.6 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 4(h)), confirming excellent recyclability of the PVA-MWS-Hg2+.

In the power industry desulfurization wastewater emission from power plants has attracted global concern. Desulfurization wastewater discharged from power plants often contains heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium and copper at harmful concentration levels.64 The heavy metals in desulfurization wastewater are treated by various methods to meet the discharge standard. However, most of the currently available methods still fail to reach the requirements for drinking water. Thus, the purification of mercury ions was evaluated using simulated desulfurization wastewater discharged from power plants (the simulated desulfurization wastewater in Table S5†).65 In this process Fig. 5(a), MWS was employed for desulfurization wastewater treatment, and was subsequently used for evaporative purification after wrapping with PVA. Following two-step purification, the concentrations of mercury ions were below 1 μg L−1 (Fig. 5(b)). After treatment, the mercury ion contained in desulfurization wastewater decreased to levels far below the World Health Organization (WHO) standards for drinking water. These results confirm that the use of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ for mercury removal is feasible. To investigate the solar steam performance of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ under real conditions, we prepared a desalination device (Fig. S11†). Then, to estimate the desalination performance of the PVA-MWS-Hg2+, an artificial saltwater sample was prepared. The amount of four metallic ions (Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+) in the desalination experiments (the artificial saline water in Table S6†) were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). As revealed in Fig. 5(c), after the purification process, concentrations of the four ions in the artificial saline water decreased significantly. The ohmic values between the artificial seawater and the purified water are 0.082, 1.256 MΩ, confirming satisfactory purification efficiency of the system (Fig. S12†). These results confirm that desalination can be efficiently achieved by PVA-MWS-Hg2+. Solar evaporation using 3.5, 7.5 and 15 wt% NaCl solutions were measured for 2 h to investigate the performance of the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ during steam generation. From Fig. 5(d), steam generation using PVA-MWS-Hg2+ declined slightly with increasing salt concentrations, which indicates that the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ displays potential for applications in solar desalination. The PVA-MWS-Hg2+ maintains a stable evaporation rate with no visible salt crystallization on the surface after several hours of use (Fig. S13†). This indicates that the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ is tolerant to salt. The stability is one of the concerns for evaporation, which should be determined. It was found that the appearance of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ exhibits no obvious changes after acid and alkali treatments for 12 h (Fig. S14†). At the same time, the water evaporation rate is similar to PVA-MWS-Hg2+ without treatment (Fig. 5(f)), indicating the high resistance of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ to acid/alkali. To investigate the evaporation rate in real environments, the experimental device was placed outdoors. The evaporation rate for outdoor solar steam generation by PVA increases from 10:00, then reaches a maximum at 12:00, and finally slows down after 13:00. Throughout the experiment, an evaporation rate of 4.62 kg m−2 h−1 could be attained. The average solar heat flux was calculated as 76.20 mW cm−2 (Fig. 5(g) and S15†). The high 4.62 kg m−2 h−1 rate of evaporation was attributed to several factors, including incident angle of outdoor sunlight, where both surface and sides of the evaporator can act as suitable areas for evaporation to generate water vapor.66 We also expect that higher outdoor temperatures during a sunny summer day (Baoding; ca. 27 °C) and wind (air-flow) could result in increased efficiency.62 Since the air-flow in an outdoor environment can result in an unsaturated state at the evaporator surface resulting in a higher rate of evaporation from the surface of the evaporator.67 In addition, the outdoor light intensity was probably much higher than 1 sun during a sunny summer day. Based on the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement results for PVA-MWS-Hg2+ (Fig. S16†), the energy efficiency of PVA-MWS-Hg2+ was calculated to be 95.48% under one sunlight irradiation, which is higher than the solar steam efficiencies and water evaporation rates of other wood systems and MoS2 materials reported (Fig. S17†).68–75 The PVA-MWS-Hg2+ in this work not only exhibits high energy efficiency but is simple to manufacture and is low-cost ≈$0.2854 (Fig. 5(h), Table S7†).

4 Conclusions
In this study, a novel adsorbent was fabricated using MoS2 and wood sponge using a hydrothermal method. The MWS exhibits a high mercury ion absorption capacity of 98% and the maximum adsorption capacity for Hg2+ can reach 325.73 mg g−1. After wrapping with a hydrophilic layer, the PVA-MWS-Hg2+ exhibits an excellent solar steam generation rate of 1.86 kg m−2 h−1 with an energy efficiency of 95.48% under one sun irradiation. These observations confirm that PVA-MWS-Hg2+ could be exploited for photothermal conversion and water purification. The material is particularly effective in removing mercury ions from desulfurization wastewater. After secondary desalination, the mercury ion level of permeate water is far below the WHO standards required for drinking water. The environmentally friendly properties of these dual use materials make them of great potential for low-cost water purification.

Environmental significance
Heavy metal contamination of water is a significant environmental concern for public health. Hg(II) is one of the priority poisonous pollutants generated by many different industries, and its uncontrolled release into the environment can lead to the serious damage of human organs such as the kidney, liver, and lungs. Remediation and removal of Hg(II) has been achieved using adsorption-based materials. As such we developed a 3D-MoS2 based wood sponge for efficient Hg(II) removal from wastewater and then upcycled the exhausted absorbents to generate drinkable water by solar steam purification. Our multifunctional material provides a new approach for environmental remediation.
