    , Accepted 27th April 2023First published on 28th April 2023AbstractIt is a challenge to synthesize high-quality MAPbX3 single-crystal microwires (MWs) under gentle conditions owing to their sensitivity to humidity and brittleness. We herein propose a facile bilayer flexible polymer confinement method to obtain high-quality MAPbI3 single-crystal microwires in air. The MAPbI3 microwire-based photodetector exhibits a superior responsivity of 77.96 A W−1, an EQE of 1.86 × 104%, and an ultrahigh detectivity of 6.97 × 1013 Jones owing to the efficient carrier transport and excellent crystallinity with few defects. Furthermore, photodetectors based on the MAPbI3 microwire arrays present superior performance with a detectivity of 3.09 × 1013 Jones, which is more than 160% and 7700% higher than that of the photodetectors based on the MAPbI3 microwires and polycrystalline film at 254 μW cm−2.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (ABX3) nanocrystal materials have gained immense popularity in optoelectronic devices like photodetectors,1–3 solar cells,4,5 lasers,6,7 and light emitting diodes due to their excellent electronic and optical properties.8–10 However, the low carrier mobility resulting from charge recombination at the grain boundaries is still one of the conundrums for nanocrystal materials.11,12 The large numbers of grain boundaries caused by the size of nanocrystal materials act as charge trapping defects, and thus deteriorate the optoelectronic performance.13 To address this issue, the design and development of large-size high-quality perovskite single crystal-based devices provides another technology due to their advantages, such as the absence of grain boundaries, few defects, reduced trap state density, high carrier mobility, long carrier transmission distance, and enhanced stability.14–18 Perovskite single crystals have shown great promise in a wide range of applications in recent years, especially one-dimensional MAPbX3 (MA+ = CH3NH3+) single-crystal micro/nanowires. Their distinct geometric structures can not only facilitate efficient carrier transport due to the reduced dimensionality, but also tolerate bending along the perpendicular to form flexible and integrated devices.19–23 Therefore, single-crystal microwires (MWs) are highly desirable for practical applications in optoelectronic devices.
Single-crystal MAPbI3 wires have been successfully synthesized using several methods, including template-assisted,20,24 antisolvent-assisted,21,23,25 wet-chemical synthesis,22,26,27 solution-based blade coating,28 and self-assembly methods.29 But for MAPbI3 single-crystal wire arrays with an orderly arrangement, which are generally prepared by a template-assisted method, the common and difficult problem of removing the hard template without damaging the crystals has to be overcome in practical applications, because the hard template could not only have a negative impact on efficient carrier transport, but also be unsuitable for assembling devices, especially for facial and integrated optoelectronic systems. It is still a challenge to synthesize high-quality MAPbX3 single-crystal MWs using gentle methods. Therefore, advanced strategies are urgently needed to obtain MAPbI3 single-crystal arrays for photodetectors.
Herein, we develop a bilayer polyethylene (PE) flexible interface confinement method to synthesize MAPbI3 single-crystal MW arrays in air. The obtained MAPbI3 single-crystal MWs have uniform size, high quality, and few defects. The PE membranes not only confine the directional growth of the MAPbI3 MWs along the [110] orientation with surface confinement, but also improve the crystal interface stability by isolating moisture during the growth process. The photodetector based on the MAPbI3 MW exhibits a responsivity of 77.96 A W−1 and a detectivity of 6.97 × 1013 Jones. More importantly, the performance of the photodetector based on the MAPbI3 MW arrays are superior to that of devices based on MW and a thin film at 5–254 μW cm−2. Moreover, the single-crystal MAPbI3 MW-based photodetectors exhibit good stability with 80% photocurrent retention after half a year. Therefore, we think that the bilayer flexible interface confinement method is an ideal and universal route for the preparation of high-quality MAPbI3 single-crystal MW arrays for smart, flexible and integrated photodetectors.
Experimental section
Materials
Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Methylamine iodide (MAI) was synthesized by using CH3NH2 and HI solutions with a molar ratio of 1.2:1 in an ice bath in the ambient atmosphere. The mixed solution was stirred continuously for 4 hours and then put into a rotary evaporator at 60 °C for 4 hours. The white MAI powder was obtained after being washed with diethyl ether three times and dried in a vacuum oven for 12 hours. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%) was purchased from Aladdin.
Synthesis of MAPbI3 MWs
A MAPbI3 precursor solution (1 mol L−1) was prepared with equimolar amounts of MAI and PbI2 in DMF at room temperature. The precursor solution was then filtered with a PTFE syringe filter with a pore size of 0.22 μm. A 30 μL sample of the MAPbI3 solution was then dropped onto a PE membrane. The PEM/solution/PEM system was formed after being sealed with another PE film. After further heating at 45 °C for 5 days, MAPbI3 MWs were synthesized from the intermediate phase by using the bilayer interfacial confinement method.
Synthesis of the MAPbI3 film
The MAPbI3 film was obtained by the spin-coating method. First, 30 μL of the precursor solution was dropped onto a 1.5 cm × 2 cm glass substrate and then spin-coated at a rotation speed of 3000 r s−1 with pure CO2 blowing. Finally, the MAPbI3 film was obtained after annealing at 100 °C for 5 min.
Characterizations
XRD patterns were measured with an X'Pert PRO MPD X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. FESEM (HITACHI UHR SU8020) was used to obtain FESEM images of the single crystals and determine the actual channel width between the Ag conductive electrodes. The steady-state spectrum was measured by an FLS1000 fluorescence spectrometer. The UV-vis spectrum of MAPbI3 was measured on an Agilent UV-vis spectrophotometer (CARY 5000) with an integrating sphere over the spectral range of 300–900 nm. The SAED pattern was measured by TEM (JEM-2100F). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a TGA 8000 thermogravimetric analyzer in nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Device fabrication
The MAPbI3 devices were fabricated in a glove box with a pure N2 atmosphere to avoid the effects of water and dust. The Ag electrodes were formed after silver paste was coated on the MAPbI3 MW arrays by using a mask with a diameter of 150 μm. The distance between the two Ag electrodes of the Ag/MAPbI3/Ag detectors was about 160 μm. Then, 10 wt% PMMA anisole solution was coated on the exposed area between the two Ag electrodes to form the PMMA membrane for avoiding perovskite decomposition. When preparing comparative thin film devices, the device structure and electrode preparation method were the same.
Photoelectric performance
The optoelectronic characterizations of the photodetectors were carried out on a Keithley Source meter (2636B). The illumination source was a 523 nm light-emitting diode powered by a DH7000 (Donghua testing). The power intensity of the incident light was calibrated by a Thorlabs power meter (PM100D). Responsivity represents the ratio of photon-excited current to irradiation flux, the EQEs can be obtained from the responsivity by changing the ratio of current/incident light power to electron quantity/photon quantity to evaluate the photocurrent conversion ability of our devices, and D* is the parameter to characterize the sensitivity of the detector, which can be calculated using eqn (1)–(3):30 (1) (2) (3)where Ipc is the photocurrent under illumination and Idark is the dark current, P is the irradiance power density, and S is the effective illuminated area. c represents the speed of light and λ is the wavelength of the light source. According to the formula, the photocurrent conversion abilities of the photodetectors were analyzed.
Results and discussion
In Fig. S1,† the contact angles of H2O, DMF, and the precursor solution are 86.5°, 43.3°, and 38.7° on the surface of the PE membrane, respectively, which are influenced by their surface tensions (H2O, 72.8 mN m−1; DMF, 25.7 mN m−1, 298 K), indicating that the PE membrane (PEM) has good wettability and permeability for DMF and the precursor solution. The PEM not only allows DMF solvent evaporation, but also resists the invasion of water vapor from the air.31Fig. 1 shows the schematic synthetic route of the single-crystal MAPbI3 MWs by using the bilayer polymer flexible interface confinement method. The MAPbI3 precursor solution was first dropped onto a PE membrane and sealed with another PE film to form a PEM/solution/PEM system. Interestingly, a yellowish intermediate phase (MAPbI3–DMF) was obtained when the DMF solvent diffuses and evaporates through the PE membrane.

The growth mechanism of the intermediate phase was proposed based on the growth process. The nucleation was driven in the saturated MAPbI3 solution by the evaporation of DMF. Then, the growth of intermediate MWs were found in the sandwich-like PEM/solution/PEM system. It should be noted that the intermediate MWs with a yellowish colour were initially discovered by the naked eye during the early stages of growth, indicating the formation of the intermediate phase. Finally, the intermediate MWs were completely converted into black MAPbI3 MWs by further heating at 45 °C for 5 days.
We further analyzed the growth kinetics of the intermediate MWs by the in situ microscopy technique. Fortunately, the processes of nucleation and growth of the intermediate MWs were caught in Fig. 1b. We observed that the intermediates nucleated from the solution after DMF slow evaporation for ∼4 hours, and then grew quickly into scattered microwires at the nucleation site in 10 and 35 min. At the surface of the PEM, the lower contact angle of the precursor solution means higher adhesion work and good wettability. The intermediates first nucleated once the solution was saturated because the PE microstructure helps to achieve the nucleation energy barrier. Intermediate MWs then grew quickly. The in situ photo micrographs indicate that the intermediate MWs have obvious 1D directional growth.
After further heating at 45 °C for 5 days, MAPbI3 MWs with a uniform size and homogeneous morphology were synthesized from the intermediate phase. Fig. 1c is a top-view photograph of the MAPbI3 MWs with a length of up to 15 mm. Due to the hydrophobicity of the PE membrane, water molecules are prevented from diffusing into the PE membranes during the crystal growth process. Therefore, MAPbI3 MWs could be obtained in the air without further dehumidification.
In Fig. 2, TGA plots are provided to quantitatively analyze the thermal behavior of the intermediate MWs in a nitrogen atmosphere. There are three main stages of weight loss based on their corresponding first derivatives. The first weight loss of 9.73 wt% occurs between room temperature and 150 °C corresponding to the volatilization of DMF. The second weight loss of 21.81 wt% between 150 and 390 °C is attributed to the decomposition of MAI. The last stage is ascribed to the volatilization and decomposition of PbI2.32,33 The ratio of DMF/MAI is 0.97:1 based on the proportional loss of the DMF and MAI substances. Considering that DMF is prone to loss during the sample transfer process, we prefer to think that the actual molar ratio of DMF/MAPbI3 is close to 1 in the intermediate (MAPbI3–DMF).

We then employed powder XRD to identify the MAPbI3 MWs and intermediate phase. Fig. 3a and b present the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the MAPbI3 MWs, MAPbI3–DMF, MAI, and PbI2. In Fig. 3a, the typical diffraction peaks at 14.32°, 28.34°, and 28.56° are assigned to the (002)/(110), (004), and (220) peaks of the tetragonal phase with the space group of I4/mcm (a = 8.855 Å, c = 12.659 Å), respectively.34,35 There is a complete conversion of the MAPbI3–DMF intermediate phase into the perovskite phase and no higher phase transition temperature is required. The phenomenon of orientated growth along the [110] direction is similar to that of the previous results.28 To further confirm the intermediate phase, Fig. 3b shows that the transitional phase is MAPbI3–DMF rather than MAI, PbI2 or MAPbI3, which is consistent with the reported MAI–PbI2–DMF intermediate.36

Fig. 3c is the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum and the Tauc plot (inset) of the MAPbI3 MWs (wavelength from 500 to 900 nm). The MAPbI3 MWs have strong and wide absorption in the visible light range of 500–820 nm for the photoelectric device, indicating that the MAPbI3 MWs had a wide capability of absorbing light, which matches well with the reported MAPbI3 MWs.26 The lower bandgap of the MAPbI3 MWs shown in the inset of Fig. 3c is about 1.51 eV, which broadens the light-response range. In addition, Fig. 3d shows a narrow PL emission peak at 821 nm with an FWHM of 41 nm, indicating the high quality of the MAPbI3 single-crystal MWs with low trap state densities.
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was conducted to further confirm the morphology and structure of the MAPbI3 MWs. It is worthwhile to note that the MAPbI3 MW with smooth surfaces and few cracks can be observed in Fig. S2.† Interestingly, the larger MAPbI3 MWs were obtained by the growth of multiple secondary MWs along the same orientation (Fig. 4a). Therefore, it can be concluded that the bilayer polymer flexible interface confinement provides a protective atmosphere from humidity in the synthesis process of the MAPbI3 MWs, which leads to the good crystallinity and enhanced stability. As shown in Fig. S3,† sharp and discrete Bragg diffraction spots are observed in the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the MAPbI3 MWs, indicating that the single-crystal MWs matched well with the simulated electron diffraction pattern of the MAPbI3 crystal.37 The XRD patterns reveal that the intensity of the (110) diffraction peak is particularly strong, which means that a higher number of (110) planes are arranged in parallel, indicating that the borders of the (110) crystal planes formed the (110) crystal plane of the MWs, and the (001) crystal plane formed the growth end of the MWs. Thus, we conclude that the preferential growth of the [110] direction makes the MAPbI3 MWs elongate in the longitudinal direction to form a linear shape, and the lateral growth in the [100] direction is limited by the bilayer PE membranes.

A 3D laser microscopic system was used to investigate the size of the MAPbI3 MWs. Fig. S4† shows the 2D and 3D laser micrographs of the MAPbI3 MWs. The as-synthesized MAPbI3 MWs are straight with a uniform diameter. A side-view 3D laser micrograph of the MAPbI3 MWs is shown in Fig. 4b. The cross-section analysis was tested by line scanning for height measurement (Fig. 4c). The two MAPbI3 MWs have uniform heights of 7–8.5 μm. Fig. 4d is a cross-section curve and 2D micrograph (inset) of aMAPbI3 MW. The single-crystal MW has a width of 11 μm and an average height of ∼7 μm on the upper surface.
The high-quality MAPbI3 MWs obtained by this method could be easily transferred and reset due to their special merit of the flexibility of the polymer membrane. The distinct geometric structures, including the absence of grain boundaries, reduced surface defects, and bend-ability, make MAPbI3 MWs suitable for applications in optoelectronic devices. The MAPbI3 MW and MW arrays were further applied as single-crystal photodetectors based on their unique structures and carrier transport. A photodetector based on a polycrystalline film was also fabricated for comparison. The fabrication routes are described in the Experimental section.
Ag/MAPbI3/Ag is a typical photoconductive detector (also known as a high-gain photodetector), rather than a photovoltaic detector. In the Ag/MAPbI3/Ag device, photogenerated carriers are amplified by injected carriers through voltage modulation. Fig. 5a shows the photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the MW-based photodetector under different light intensities from 1.02 to 329 μW cm−2, which are measured under 523 nm LED illumination. The photocurrent (Iph) increases with increased incident light intensity because the amount of photogenerated carriers is proportional to the absorbed photon flux. As shown in Fig. 5b, the power law (Iph ∝ Pβ) was fitted based on the relationship between the photocurrent and the illuminated light intensity at 3 V bias. The value of the power law factor β is 0.77 for the MW-based photodetector, which is thought to be related to the complex process of electron–hole generation, recombination, and hole-trapping within the photoresponse process for the single-crystal MAPbI3 MW-based photodetector.

To further investigate the photoelectric performance of the MW-based photodetectors, we further investigated the responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE), and detectivity (D*), which are three key parameters to evaluate the performance of photodetectors. Fig. 5c shows the relationships between R/EQE and light intensity at 3 V. The responsivities of the photodetector based on a MW are 78.0, 45.7, 38.3, 37.7, 32.0, 31.4, and 26.5 A W−1, which are much better than the performance of the film-based device (2.90, 1.07, 0.72, 0.60, 0.41, 0.38 and 0.33 A W−1) under 523 nm light illumination of 1.0, 5.0, 9.7, 24.4, 63.9, 93.5 and 159 μW cm−2 at 3 V, respectively. The corresponding EQEs of the MW-based detector are 1.68 × 104%, 109 × 104%, 0.91 × 104%, 0.90 × 104%, 0.76 × 104%, 0.75 × 104%, and 0.63 × 104%, respectively. The high EQE is attributed to the photoconductive gain effect under a high applied bias for photodetectors.
Beyond a MW-based detector, the MW array-based detector may have enhanced photoelectric performance due to the light trapping for the MW arrays. In Fig. S5,† the photocurrent increases linearly with the light intensity, which is larger than that of a MW-based detector due to the increased radiation area. In Fig. 5d, the R is 75.5 A W−1 and the EQE is 1.80 × 104% under weak-light illumination of 1.02 μW cm−2 for the MW array-based detector, which is slightly lower than those of the MW-based devices. Interestingly, The R values and EQEs are higher than those of a MW-based device when the light intensity is ≥5 μW cm−2. The improved R of 32.4 A W−1 and EQE of 0.77 × 104% are observed at a high power of 254 μW cm−2, which is 25% higher than those of a MW-based detector, indicating that the responsivity of the MW array-based detector is superior to that of the MW-based detector at high light power density. We think that the MW arrays have better light absorption due to its light trapping formed by the MW arrays (inset of Fig. 5d).

Fig. 5e shows the D* values of the photodetectors based on the MAPbI3 MW arrays, MW, and thin film at 3 V bias. The D* of the MAPbI3 MW array-based device could reach 8.06 × 1013 Jones under 523 nm LED illumination with a power density of 1.02 μW cm−2, which is higher than the 6.97 × 1013 Jones for the MW-based device. In contrast, the D* of the device based on a polycrystalline MAPbI3 film is only 4.02 × 1012 Jones. The D* of the MW array-based detector is 1900% higher than the value of the MAPbI3 film-based detector. Even at a high light power density of 0.254 mW cm−2, the D* values are 3.09 × 1013, 1.94 × 1013, and 0.04 × 1013 Jones for the photodetectors based on the MAPbI3 MW arrays, MW, and thin film, respectively. The MW array-based detector has a more obvious advantage than detectors based on MW, the polycrystalline MAPbI3 film and other reported results in Table 1.

The on–off performance under periodic illumination with different light intensities is displayed in Fig. 6a and b, implying that both the MAPbI3 MW and MW array-based devices exhibit excellent on–off switching performance. The defect state density (ntrap) of the MAPbI3 MW, MW arrays, and thin film was also estimated by the space charge limited current method (SCLC).44,45 In Fig. S6,† the VTFL values are 5.9 V, 6.5 V, and 13.2 V for the MAPbI3 MW, MW arrays, and thin film, respectively. Their ratio of defect state density (nt1/nt2/nt3 = VTFL1/VTFL2/VTFL3) is 1:1.1:2.2. The lower ntrap of the MW arrays contributes to the lower noise and the higher detection rate than the polycrystalline MAPbI3 film.46 To study the stability of the MW-based device, we also test the I–t curves after being placed in air for half a year at room temperature. The dark current is stable without any change, and the photocurrent is still 80% of the initial value. Therefore, the photodetectors based on the high-quality MAPbI3 single-crystal MWs or arrays obtained by using the bilayer flexible polymer confinement method show good stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized high-quality single-crystal MAPbI3 MWs by a flexible polymer confinement method, which avoids the influence of moisture in the air. The MAPbI3 MW arrays have few interface defects and excellent light-trapping performance due to the confined structure on the MWs and between the MWs. The MAPbI3 MW array-based photodetectors have excellent performance, including photocurrent, responsivity, EQE, and detectivity. The detectivity of the MAPbI3 MW array-based device is still 3.09 × 1013 at 254 μW cm−2, which is more than 160% and 7700% higher than those of the MW and polycrystalline-film-based photodetectors. We think that the in situ bilayer flexible confinement method may be a facile route to obtain a flexible MW arrays with exciting light trapping for smart photodetectors.
