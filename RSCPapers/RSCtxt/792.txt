    , Accepted 21st July 2020First published on 21st July 2020AbstractThe most common structure of a quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSC) employs a metal sulfide counter electrode (CE) combined with a polysulfide electrolyte (S2−/Sn2−). Polyiodide electrolytes (I−/I3−) have an advantage over polysulfide because of their high photovoltage output. However, most semiconductor QDs will dissolve in polyiodide. This work presents a new double-layer CE material Pt/CuSe that is compatible with polyiodide. The electrocatalytic activity of three types of CEs: Pt, CuSe and Pt/CuSe, are compared using cyclic voltammetry, Tafel plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Among the three CEs, the Pt/CuSe CE exhibits the best catalytic activity with low charge transfer resistance and a high current density. Pt/CuSe CEs are then applied in ternary Pb5Sb8S17 QDSCs that are stable in polyiodide. The QDSC with the Pt/CuSe CE exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.71% (with ZnS passivation), which is significantly higher than those of cells with Pt (2.53%) and CuSe (2.68%) CEs. At the reduced intensity of 0.1 sun, the PCE further increases to 5.54%, a respectable efficiency for a QDSC. To the best of our knowledge, Pt/CuSe is the first CE for QDSCs using polyiodide and has the potential for improving performance in QDSCs.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) are a low-cost alternative to silicon-based photovoltaic devices. The architecture of a QDSC is analogous to that of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with three key components: a photoanode, an electrolyte and a counter electrode (CE), (see Fig. 1(a)). The photoanode consists of a mesoporous TiO2 film coated with a layer of light-absorbing semiconductor nanoparticles (or quantum dots – QDs). The use of inorganic semiconductor QDs as light sensitizers has several advantages such as multiple exciton generation, a tunable band gap, high absorption coefficients, solution processability, ease of fabrication and cost-effectiveness.1–3 The most common semiconductor QD materials have been binary metal chalcogenides such as CdS,4 CdSe,5 PbS,6 PbSe,7 Sb2Se3 (ref. 8) and Ag2S.9 The maximal power conversion efficiency of QDSCs based on single-layer binary QDs is typically ∼5 to 7%.10–13 Recently, ternary QD sensitizers such as AgSbS2,14 CuSbS2,15 AgInS2,16 CuBiS2,17 Pb5Sb8S17 (ref. 18) and CuInSe2 (ref. 19) have also been developed. The function of the second component – the redox electrolyte – is to transfer charges between the anode and the CE for regeneration of an oxidized QD. The commonly used electrolytes include polyiodide (I−/I3−) and polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couples.
 Fig. 1  (a) General structure of a QDSC, (b) structure of a fabricated Pb5Sb8S17 QDSC and (c) schematic of the preparation of a Pt/CuSe CE. 
Counter electrodes – the third component of a QDSC – have two main functions: (a) transfer electrons from the external circuit into the electrolyte and (b) catalyze the reduction reaction of the oxidized electrolyte at the CE/electrolyte interface. A good CE material should have the properties of high electrocatalytic activity, high electrical conductivity and long-term stability. Much effort has been made to develop appropriate CE materials for QDSCs. In general, CE materials for QDSCs can be categorized into five types: noble metals (e.g., Pt, Au), metal chalcogenides (e.g., CuxS, NiS, PbS, CoS, and FeS), conducting polymers, carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes, carbon black and carbon form) and various composites. Various types of CE materials and their photovoltaic performance have been reviewed in several papers.20,21
The most common structure of a DSSC employs a Pt CE combined with a polyiodide electrolyte. Pt is chosen because of its high electrical conductance and excellent catalytic activity in the polyiodide electrolyte, providing a favorable triiodide/iodide (I3− → I−) reduction reaction at the CE/electrolyte interface. However, the situation in QDSCs is different. A problem is that polyiodide electrolytes are not suitable for many QDSCs because semiconductor QDs will dissolve in the polyiodide solution. Instead, most QDSCs employ polysulfide electrolytes as redox electrolytes. Currently, the most common QDSC structure typically consists of a polysulfide electrolyte combined with a metal chalcogenide CE. Metal chalcogenide CEs have advantages such as good physical and chemical stability, and are much cheaper than noble metals (Pt). Among the various metal chalcogenides, Cu2S shows superior catalytic activity towards the reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte in QDSCs due to weak van der Waals forces.22 Various copper sulfide derivatives CuxS, including CuS23 and Cu-deficient sulfides Cu1.8S24 and Cu1.75S,25 have also been shown to be candidate CEs in QDSCs.
In addition to the single-component CE materials discussed above, alternative CE materials are composite (or double-layer) CEs. A composite CE is formed by combining a CE material with another CE material. A noble metal combined with a metal sulfide such as Pt/CuS was reported to achieve a PCE of 2.27%.26 Other CEs include a metal sulfide combined with another metal sulfide (e.g., NiS/PbS,27 CuS/CoS,28 CoS/NiS29), and a metal sulfide combined with a carbonaceous material (e.g., Cu2S/RGO (reduced graphene oxide)).30 A composite CE usually yields improved photovoltaic performance over the single constituent CE material because the composite CE could have the synergistic advantages of the two constituent materials. For example, the noble metal/metal chalcogenide composite Pt/CuS CE yielded a PCE of 4.2% in CdS/CdSe QDSCs.31 PbS QDSCs using an Au/CuS composite CE yielded a PCE of 5.7%.32 Among the various noble metal/metal chalcogenide composites, Pt/CuS is one of the most commonly used composite CEs. Meanwhile, CuSe, a material belonging to the same group of CuS, has been employed as a CE in QDSCs with excellent electrocatalytic activity.33,34 Composite Pt/CuSe is expected to be a good composite CE material like Pt/CuS as well. However, there has been no report on the employment of Pt/CuSe as a CE in QDSCs to date. Note that most of these noble metal/metal chalcogenide CEs can only be used with polysulfide electrolytes.
A QDSC using polysulfide has a drawback of low open circuit voltage Voc. The theoretical upper limit of Voc for a QDSC is Voc = (EF − Eredox)/e, where EF is the quasi Fermi level of TiO2, Eredox is the redox potential of the electrolyte and e is the elementary charge. The Eredox potential of polysulfide is ∼0.42 V higher than that of polyiodide.35 Accordingly, a polyiodide electrolyte would produce a higher Voc and a higher PCE. Thus, polyiodide is the preferred electrolyte for a QDSC. The problem is that one needs to find QD materials that do not dissolve in a polyiodide electrolyte.
The ternary metal chalcogenide semiconductor Pb5Sb8S17 has recently been demonstrated to be stable in polyiodide.18 Liquid-junction Pb5Sb8S17 QDSCs, employing a Pt CE and a polyiodide electrolyte, yielded a PCE of 3.95% under 0.1 sun.18 In this work a new composite noble metal/metal chalcogenide CE Pt/CuSe is demonstrated to be a suitable CE material for Pb5Sb8S17 QDSCs using a polyiodide electrolyte. Liquid-junction Pb5Sb8S17 QDSCs were fabricated by the sequential ionic layer adsorption reaction method (SILAR). The electrocatalytic ability of various types of CEs are investigated using cyclic voltammetry, Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We compare the photovoltaic performance of Pb5Sb8S17 QDSCs using three types of CEs: Pt, CuSe, and Pt/CuSe. The cell using the Pt/CuSe CE yielded the best PCE among the three CEs. The best cell achieved a PCE of 5.54%, which is 40% higher than that (3.95%) in the previous report.18 To the best of our knowledge, Pt/CuSe in the first noble metal/metal chalcogenide composite CE that can be used with polyiodide in QDSCs.
2. Experimental
The preparation of samples contains two major parts: the preparation of the Pt/CuSe composite CE and the fabrication of the Pb5Sb8S17 QDSCs. Fig. 1(b) shows a schematic diagram of a fabricated Pb5Sb8S17 QDSC, including FTO/blocking layer/mesoporous TiO2 Pb5Sb8S17 QD layer/electrolyte/Pt–CuSe CE. Details of the preparation process of each component are described below.
2.1. Fabrication of a Pt/CuSe composite counter electrode
The Pt/CuSe CE had a two-layer structure: a Pt layer and a CuSe layer. Fig. 1(c) shows the schematic of the preparation of a Pt/CuSe CE, including two steps (a) deposition of a Pt layer and (b) synthesis of CuSe nanocrystals that comprised (i) deposition of a CuS NC layer and (ii) conversion of the CuS layer to a CuSe layer.
(a) Deposition of the Pt layer: the Pt layer was prepared by spin coating 50 μL of a 0.005 M hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) ethanol solution onto a precleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, 7 Ω per square, Pilkington) substrate with a speed of 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating on a hot plate at 75 °C for 5 min. After repeating the same spin coating twice, the substrate was sintered in a muffle furnace at 400 °C for 15 min.
(b) Synthesis of CuSe nanocrystals: CuSe nanocrystals (NCs) do not adhere well to FTO. Here, an alternative two-step method was developed to grow CuSe NCs. CuS crystals were first grown on the Pt-coated FTO substrate. The CuS crystals acted as seeds for CuSe growth. CuSe crystals were then grown using the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method.
(i) Growth of CuS crystals: CuS crystals were synthesized using the SILAR method. First, the Pt-coated FTO substrate was immersed into a 25 °C, 0.1 M CuCl2·2H2O aqueous solution for 1 min to adsorb Cu2+ ions, followed by rinsing in DI water to clean the excess Cu2+ ions, and then drying in air on a hot plate at 65 °C. The sample was then dipped into a 25 °C, 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min to adsorb S2− ions, rinsed using DI water to clean the excess S2− ions, and then dried as described above. CuS NCs were deposited on the substrate after the process.
(ii) CBD growth of CuSe NCs: the Se source was a sodium selenosulfate (Na2SeSO3) aqueous solution, prepared by stirring an aqueous solution of 0.1 M sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) and a 0.2 M selenium aqueous solution at 90 °C for 3 h. The prepared Na2SeSO3 solution was mixed with a 0.1 M CuCl2·2H2O solution and a 0.2 M nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt solution with a volume ratio of 1:1:1. Next, the CuS-coated FTO substrate was immersed vertically into this mixed solution at 25 °C for different hours. CuSe NCs were deposited on FTO after the process. Bare Pt CEs and bare CuSe CEs were also prepared for comparison.
2.2. Preparation of a Pb5Sb8S17 photoanode

2.2.1. Preparation of a TiO2 electrode. 
The TiO2 electrode consisted of a three-layered structure: a TiO2 blocking layer (thickness ≈ 50–70 nm), a mesoporous TiO2 electrode (mp-TiO2) layer (thickness ≈ 10–12 μm), and a TiO2 scattering layer (thickness ≈ 5 μm). Firstly, a blocking layer was prepared by spin-coating 50 μL of 0.247 M titanium isopropoxide solution (consisting of 75 μL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide, 425 μL of ethanol, and 500 μL of 0.04 mM HCl) onto a precleaned FTO substrate, followed by heating at 190 °C for 5 min. Secondly, the mp-TiO2 was prepared by coating a commercial TiO2 paste (particle size ≈ 30 nm, GreatCell Solar 30 NR-D) onto the previous blocking layer using the doctor-blade method, followed by heating at 125 °C for 10 min. Thirdly, a scattering TiO2 layer (particle size ≈ 300–450 nm, GreatCell Solar WER4-0) was coated on top of the mp-TiO2 layer. Finally, the sample was annealed at 500 °C for 90 min under the atmospheric conditions.


2.2.2. Synthesis of Pb5Sb8S17 nanocrystals. 
Pb5Sb8S17 NCs were grown onto the mp-TiO2 electrode using the two-stage SILAR method as described in the previous literature.18 First, a layer of binary Pb–S NCs was grown on the mp-TiO2 electrode. Second, a layer of binary Sb–S NCs was grown on top of the Pb–S NCs. Post annealing transformed the double-layered Pb–S/Sb–S NCs into Pb5Sb8S17 NCs. The details are described as follows.
(a) SILAR growth of Pb–S NCs: a Pb–S SILAR cycle consisted of sequential immersion in the Pb2+ and S2− ion precursors. A TiO2 electrode was dipped into a 0.05 M, 25 °C Pb(NO3)2 aqueous solution for 30 s, rinsed in DI water, and then dried on a hot plate at 65 °C. This step resulted in adsorption of Pb ions on the TiO2 electrode. The electrode was subsequently dipped into a 0.1 M, 25 °C Na2S methanol solution for 30 s, and then dried as described above. This completed a Pb–S SILAR cycle, producing Pb–S NCs on the TiO2 electrode. The SILAR process was repeated consecutively for the desired number of cycles before starting the Sb–S deposition.
(b) SILAR growth of Sb–S NCs: the PbS-coated TiO2 electrode was immersed into a 0.1 M, 25 °C SbCl3 ethanol solution for 15 s, rinsed in ethanol and dried as mentioned in (a). The electrode was then immersed into a 0.1 M Na2S methanol solution for 1 min, rinsed in methanol, and dried as before. This two-step dipping process formed a Sb–S SILAR cycle. The number of Sb–S SILAR cycles was equal to that of the Pb–S cycles.
(c) Post annealing: the PbS/Sb–S double-layered structure was annealed at 350 °C for 60 min in flowing N2 gas. The post annealing treatment transformed the PbS/Sb–S structure into the Pb5Sb8S17 phase.
(d) ZnS passivation coating: to reduce carrier recombination, the synthesized Pb5Sb8S17 NCs were coated with a layer of ZnS film using the SILAR method. The Pb5Sb8S17 coated electrode was dipped into a 0.1 M, 25 °C Zn(NO3)2 ethanol solution for 60 s, and then into a 0.1 M Na2S in methanol solution for 60 s. A thin ZnS layer was coated over the surface of Pb5Sb8S17 NCs after one or two SILAR cycles.

2.3. Solar cell fabrication
The Pb5Sb8S17 photoanode was assembled with a Pt/CuSe CE to form a sandwich-configuration QDSC. A polyiodide electrolyte solution, consisting of 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazilium iodine, 0.03 M I2 and 0.3 M LiI, was injected into the internal spaces of the cell.
3. Materials characterization
The structures and morphology of the Pt/CuSe CEs and Pb5Sb8S17 NCs were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, BrukerD8), a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010). Optical spectra were recorded using a Hitachi UV-vis spectrophotometer (U-2800). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Tafel polarization plots were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (ZIVE-SPI). CV was carried out in a three-electrode system with different CEs as the working electrode, a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The electrode was dipped into a polyiodide electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also performed on the same electrochemical workstation (ZIVE-SPI) at the forward bias of −0.6 V in the frequency range of 0.1 to 0.5 MHz under dark conditions. Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) generated by an Oriel 150 W xenon lamp. The light intensity was adjusted using a calibrated Si photodetector. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded using an Acton monochromator with a 250 W tungsten halogen lamp source (without white light biasing). The active area of the cell, defined by a metal mask, was 3 mm × 3 mm. To ensure the data accuracy, a batch of three to six samples was prepared for each experimental condition and the experiment was repeated for five batches of samples.
4. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of a Pt/CuSe counter electrode. The CuSe NCs were prepared with a 3 h reaction time. The composite exhibits well-defined peaks, which are in good agreement with the standard pattern of hexagonal CuSe (JCPDS 03-065-3562). The large diffraction peaks at 28.04°, 30.37°, 31.01°, 45.26°, 45.93°, 49.88°, 54.68° and 56.46° correspond to the (102), (103), (006), (107), (110), (108), (202) and (116) planes of the hexagonal CuSe structure, respectively. Many large peaks due to the FTO substrate (marked as *) can also be observed. For comparison, the spectra of CuSe and Pt are also displayed at the bottom panel. Diffraction peaks of Pt were not observed in the Pt/CuSe composite. The absence of Pt signals is explained by that the amount of Pt material constitutes a small fraction of the Pt/CuSe composite, producing an XRD signal too weak to detect. The explanation is supported by the EDS data discussed below. The lattice parameters of the CuSe NCs were calculated to be a = 3.945 and c = 17.283 Å, which are in good accordance with the standard values of a = 3.948 Å and c = 17.285 Å.36

The morphology of the synthesized materials was investigated by SEM. Fig. 3(a) shows the SEM image of a bare FTO film. Fig. 3(b) shows the SEM image of Pt NCs coated on FTO. The Pt NCs are seen to be distributed randomly on top of the FTO film with some aggregation. Fig. 3(c) shows the CuS NC seeds coated on top of Pt NCs. Images of CuSe NCs prepared with different CBD reaction times of 1, 2, and 3 h are displayed in Fig. 3(d), (e) and (f), respectively. The CuSe NCs showed plate-like or sheet-like shapes and their sizes increased with increasing reaction time. The coverage on FTO increased with reaction time. After 3 h, the FTO substrate was completely covered with CuSe NCs. The NCs have sizes of approximately 150–200 nm. Fig. 3(g) shows the EDS spectrum of Pt/CuSe NCs prepared with 3 h reaction time. The inset to the EDS spectrum shows the Cu:Se elemental ratio of 50.8%:46.6%, which matches well with the stoichiometry (1:1) of the CuSe phase.

The material morphology was further characterized using TEM. Fig. 4(a) shows the TEM image of bare CuSe NCs. The plate-like crystals have lengths approximately 150–200 nm and thicknesses of approximately 10–15 nm. Fig. 4(b) shows the image of Pt NCs coated on CuSe NCs. Fig. 4(c) shows an enlarged figure of Fig. 4(b). As seen, many Pt NCs are deposited randomly on the surface of CuSe NCs. The Pt particle size, shown in the histogram of the inset, exhibits a distribution from 2 to 5 nm with the most probable size of 3 nm. Fig. 4(d) shows a high-resolution TEM image of a Pt/CuSe composite. The lattice fringe spacings of 0.225 and 0.317 nm, estimated using fast Fourier transform, are attributed to the (111) plane of Pt NC and the (102) plane of CuSe NC, respectively. Fig. 4(e) shows the selected-area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) of a bare CuSe NC. Fig. 4(f) shows the SAED of a Pt/CuSe composite. The diffraction patterns, with (hkl) indices labeled, can be assigned to the hexagonal CuSe and fcc Pt structures, respectively. The SAED results are in good agreement with the XRD results shown in Fig. 2. The elemental mapping of a Pt/CuSe crystal is shown in Fig. 4(g)–(i). From the mapping it was evident that the Pt, Cu and Se elements were homogeneously distributed in the Pt/CuSe crystal.

Fig. 5(a) shows the UV-vis transmission spectra T(λ) of Pt/CuSe CEs prepared with different deposition times. T(λ) decreases with increasing deposition time, indicating increasing light absorption as the amount of deposited Pt/CuSe material increased with the deposition time. The optical absorption is attributed primarily to CuSe NCs because Pt constitutes only a small fraction of the composite. Fig. 5(b) shows the absorbance spectra A(λ) = −log10(T(λ)) of these three samples. The absorbance clearly increases with increasing deposition time, which is, again, the result of increased material deposited on the sample. Weak absorption in the low-energy region of E < 1.7 eV is observed. This absorption is attributed to the Urbach tail states that arise from defects below the band gap. A similar phenomenon has been observed in CdS nanoparticles and explained by Rabinovich and Hodes.37Fig. 5(c) shows the Tauc plots (Ahυ)2vs. hυ for the three samples, where h is Planck's constant and υ is the photon frequency. The intercept to the x-axis yields the optical energy gap Eg of 1.81, 1.95 and 2.09 eV for the deposition time of 3, 2 and 1 h, respectively. The Eg of 1.81 eV (3 h) is in reasonable agreement with that (1.7 eV) of bulk CuSe.

The electrocatalytic activity of different counter electrodes was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry. Fig. 6(a) shows the CV curves of three types of CEs: bare Pt, bare CuSe, and composite Pt/CuSe. The oxidation peak (Ox) and reduction peak (Red) in a CV curve are used to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of a CE. Two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Ox1/Red1 and Ox2/Red2), as shown in the figure, are identified. The pair at low potential is assigned to eqn (1) and the pair at high potential is assigned to eqn (2) of the redox reaction in the polyiodide electrolyte.38,39 I3− + 2e− ⇌ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ⇌ 2I3−(2)
 Fig. 6  (a) CV curves, (b) Nyquist plots and (c) Tafel polarization curves of Pt, CuSe and Pt/CuSe CEs. 
Two important electrochemical parameters, ΔEp (peak to peak potential separation of Ox1 and Red1) and Jp (peak current density), can be deduced from a CV curve. ΔEp is inversely correlated with the charge transfer rate. The ΔEp values for the three electrodes are: 0.39 (Pt), 0.34 (CuSe) and 0.31 V (Pt/CuSe), respectively. Among the three CEs, the Pt/CuSe CE has the smallest ΔEp, indicating a higher charge transfer rate and better catalytic ability for the reduction of I3− to I− The peak current density Jp for the three CEs are: 4.22 (Pt), 4.41 (CuSe) and 5.41 mA cm−2 (Pt/CuSe). The Pt/CuSe CE has the largest Jp compared to that of Pt or CuSe. The large Jp of Pt/CuSe ensures a large amount of charge storage and higher specific capacitance, both being beneficial to a catalytic process.
The charge transfer kinetics and internal resistance of the QDSCs were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 0.1–500 kHz. Fig. 6(b) shows the Nyquist plots of QDSCs with Pt, CuSe and Pt/CuSe CEs measured under AM 1.5 light illumination. The EIS parameters were calculated by fitting the Nyquist plots using the equivalent circuit (shown in the inset) that consists of a series resistance Rs and two RC circuits with Warburg's impedance. The high-frequency semicircle on the left (∼100–100 kHz) corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) at the electrolyte/CE interface; the low-frequency semicircle (100–10 Hz) corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct2) at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Table 1 lists the fitted data. The cell with the Pt/CuSe CE exhibited superior performance in every EIS parameter compared to that of Pt and CuSe. Specifically, the Rct1 (the impedance that is most relevant to CE performance) of Pt/CuSe (38.1 Ω) is significantly lower than 109.3 Ω (Pt) or 43.5 Ω (CuSe), indicating an enhanced electron transfer process at the electrolyte/CE interface of the Pt/CuSe CE. Furthermore, the high chemical capacitance Cμ (88.809 μF) of the Pt/CuSe CE is mostly related to the improved collection of photoexcited electrons into the conduction band of the photoanode as a result of reduced carrier recombination. The overall superior EIS performance indicated that the Pt/CuSe CE has better electrocatalytic activity and electron conduction among the three CE materials.

The catalytic activity was further investigated by Tafel polarization measurements on symmetrical cells. Fig. 6(c) displays the Tafel curves of the three types of CEs. The curve at the middle potential (with a sharp slope) is assigned to the Tafel part. Extrapolating the linear region of a Tafel curve at zero overpotential yields the exchange current density J0 (in logarithm scale). In general, J0 is inversely proportional to the charge transfer resistance Rct. The calculated J0, as shown in the figure, is 0.82 (Pt), 1.67 (CuSe) and 4.55 mA cm−2 (Pt/CuSe), respectively. The Pt/CuSe CE has the largest J0 and hence the smallest Rct among the three CEs. The result is in agreement with the findings in the EIS results that the Pt/CuSe CE has the lowest Rct, revealing superior catalytic ability of the Pt/CuSe CE.

Fig. 7(a) shows the I–V curves of Pb5Sb8S17 QDSCs with four different CEs: Pt, CuS, CuSe and Pt/CuSe under 1 sun illumination. Table 2 lists the photovoltaic data. The Pt:CuSe ratio in the Pt/CuSe CE was tuned until the best photovoltaic performance was achieved (details are described in the paragraph below). The cell with the Pt CE yielded a PCE of 2.53% (Sample no. 1). The cell with CuSe yielded a slightly higher PCE of 2.68% (Sample no. 3). The cell using the Pt/CuSe CE yielded a significantly higher PCE of 3.11% (Sample no. 4), which is approximately ∼20% higher than that of Pt or CuSe. The cell using CuS yielded the lowest PCE of 1.84% (Sample no. 2), which is probably because the CuS NCs were adhered weakly and peeled off easily from the FTO substrate. Compared to the other CEs, the Pt/CuSe cell exhibited superior performance in every photovoltaic parameter including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE, which revealed the improved synergistic electrocatalytic effect. The best Pt/CuSe cell was further treated with a layer of ZnS coating in order to reduce the electron–hole recombination effect. The ZnS treatment increased the PCE to 3.71% (Sample no. 5), an increase of 19% over the untreated sample. The ZnS-treated cell had the photovoltaic parameters of Jsc = 14.09 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.46 V, and FF = 57.3%. The improvement after ZnS passivation arose mainly from FF, which increased from 47.0 to 57.3%. The large increase in FF after passivation indicated that carrier recombination is an important, active process in the Pb5Sb8S17 QDSC. QD NCs prepared by SILAR normally contain a large number of surface defects that act as recombination centers. A ZnS passivation layer forms a potential barrier between the conduction band of a QD and the electrolyte, preventing the photogenerated carriers from recombining with holes in the electrolyte, leading to an increased PCE.

The Pt/CuSe CEs used in the photovoltaic measurements in Table 2 were tuned to have the Pt:CuSe ratio for optimal photovoltaic performance. The procedure for tuning the amount of Pt:CuSe was performed using a two-step process. First, the amount of Pt was fixed, and then the amount of CuSe was varied. Second, the amount of CuSe was fixed, and then the amount of Pt was varied. In the first process, a fixed amount of Pt was spin-coated (1500 rpm) on FTO, as described in the Experimental section 2.1. Four samples with various amounts of CuSe were prepared by dipping the Pt-coated FTO substrate into the CuSe solution for various CBD reaction times of 1, 2, 3 and 4 h. Photovoltaic measurements were then performed on these four samples. Fig. 8(a) displays the I–V curves of the four samples. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. The cell with a CuSe reaction time of 3 h yielded the best PCE of 3.11% among the four samples. Next, three samples with a fixed amount of CuSe and various amounts of Pt were prepared. The amount of CuSe nanocrystals was fixed by a CBD reaction time of 3 h. Three Pt samples were prepared using various spinning speeds of 1000, 1500 and 2000 rpm. A higher speed produced a thinner Pt layer and a smaller amount of Pt material. The procedure produced three Pt/CuSe CEs with a fixed amount of CuSe and various amounts of Pt. The photovoltaic performance of the three samples is shown Fig. 8(b). Table 4 lists the photovoltaic data. The sample prepared with 1500 rpm yielded the best PCE of 2.55% among the three samples. Based on the results shown in Table 4, the optimum preparation conditions for the Pt/CuSe sample were: Pt (1500 rpm) and CuSe (3 h CBD). This optimal sample was subsequently subjected to EDX measurements, revealing the Pt:Cu:Se ratio of 2.56:50.81:46.63, as shown in Fig. 3.

The efficiency of a QDSC could be improved by measuring its photovoltaic response under reduced light intensities. Fig. 7(b) shows the I–V curves at various low light intensities. Table 4 lists the data. As the light intensity decreased from 1 to 0.1 sun, the PCE increased from 3.71 to 5.54% – a significant enhancement of 49%. The best PCE of 5.54% represents the maximal efficiency achievable in this work. This PCE is 40% higher than that (3.95%) in the previous report.18 This best PCE is also comparable with that (≈5%) of the best QDSCs based on single-layered binary metal chalcogenides. The enhanced PCE under low light intensities is attributed to the reduced carrier recombination at low light intensities. The improvement can be explained in terms of the multiple trapping model for carrier recombination in which carriers repeat the trapping/detrapping process at trap sites.40,41 According to the theory, carrier recombination is reduced as the light intensity decreases. The theory predicts a sublinear relation: Jsc ∝ I0α, where I0 is the light intensity and α < 1. A sublinear relation implies that photocurrent Jsc reduces at a lower rate than that of the light intensity. That is, the generation of photocurrent is more efficient under low light intensities. The reduced carrier recombination led to a higher PCE at low light intensities, as observed in Fig. 7(b).
Quantum efficiency is a crucial parameter for a solar cell. Fig. 7(c) shows the EQE spectra of the QDSCs with three different CEs. The EQE spectra of the three samples cover the spectral range of 300–750 nm. The Pt/CuSe cell exhibited the best, CuSe the medium, and Pt the lowest EQE performance. The maximal EQE value at λ = 500 nm is 75.3 (Pt/CuSe), 71.5 (CuSe) and 66.9% (Pt), respectively. The photocurrent JPh generated by a solar cell can be calculated by integrating the area under the EQE curve using: JPh = e∫ϕ(λ)EQE(λ)dλ(3)where ϕ(λ)is the photon flux and e is the elementary charge. Integrating the EQE curves yields JPh = 13.85 (Pt/CuSe), 12.96 (CuSe) and 12.05 (Pt) mA cm−2, respectively. This EQE-integrated current density agrees with Jsc = 14.09 mA cm−2 obtained from I–V measurements (Table 2). The cutoff wavelength λ represents the wavelength where the photon-induced transition from the valence band to the conduction band occurs. Thus, it can be considered to be an EQE-derived Eg. Fig. 7(c) yields an Eg of 1.72 eV (λ = 720 nm), which corresponds to the Eg of the Pb5Sb8S17 sensitizer. The large maximal EQE value and photocurrent JPh observed in Pt/CuSe provide further evidence of the superior electrocatalytic ability of Pt/CuSe among the three different CEs.
5. Conclusion
We developed a new CE material for QDSCs by the CBD method. Pt/CuSe CEs exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity with low charge transfer resistance. Pt/CuSe CEs are compatible with polyiodide redox couples and produce a higher Voc than polysulfide does. The employment of Pt/CuSe as the CE in Pb5Sb8S17 QDSCs achieved a PCE exceeding 5%, indicating that Pt/CuSe could be an efficient CE material for QDSCs using polyiodide.
