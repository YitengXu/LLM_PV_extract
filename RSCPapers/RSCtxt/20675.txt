    , Accepted 8th April 2022First published on 11th April 2022AbstractGraphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions are widely used in high-power and high-frequency devices, for which thermal management is vital to the device operation and life. Here we apply molecular dynamics simulation to calculate the interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) between graphene and β-Ga2O3. Based on the rigid ion model, a self-consistent interatomic potential with a set of parameters that can well reproduce the basic physical properties of crystal β-Ga2O3 is fitted. Using this potential, the effects of model size, interface type, temperature, vacancy defects and graphene hydrogenation on the ITR of graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions are evaluated. The results show that there is no obvious dependence of ITR on the size of graphene and β-Ga2O3. It is reported that the ITR values of the (100), (010) and (001) interfaces are 7.28 ± 0.35 × 10−8 K m2 W−1, 6.69 ± 0.44 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 and 5.22 ± 0.35 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 at 300 K, respectively. Both temperature increase and vacancy defect increase can prompt the energy propagation across graphene/β-Ga2O3 interfaces due to the enhancement of phonon coupling. In addition, graphene hydrogenation provides new channels for in-plane and out-of-plane phonon coupling, and thus reduces the ITR between graphene and β-Ga2O3. This study provides basic strategies for the thermal design and management of graphene/β-Ga2O3 based photoelectric devices.
1. Introduction
β-Ga2O3, an excellent semiconductor material with a highly anisotropic lattice, wide bandgap, large critical electric field, high electron mobility and low fabrication cost,1,2 has attracted increasing research interest recently, and has been widely used in high-power and high-frequency devices.3 In particular, it can be a promising material in solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs),4 metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (FETs)5,6 and gas sensors.7 For UV PDs, quantum efficiency and responsivity are two key figures of merit to characterize their performance.8 However, β-Ga2O3 based UV PDs face an urgent problem of low quantum efficiency and responsivity.9 An efficient solution to solve the problem is to construct Schottky junctions by combining with graphene.10 Considering the excellent properties of β-Ga2O3 and graphene, many studies on the graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction used for UV PDs have been conducted recently,11–13 which demonstrated that the graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction can improve the performance of UV PDs. Besides, it is observed that the graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction has the ability to upgrade the radio frequency of FETs.14 However, β-Ga2O3 based devices working under high-power or high-frequency conditions can lead to a thermal accumulation problem due to the self-heating effect.15 Hence, it is necessary to efficiently dissipate heat to maintain the stable performance of β-Ga2O3 based devices.
Nevertheless, the poor thermal conductivity of crystal β-Ga2O3, which is demonstrated to be an order of magnitude lower than those of GaN (220 W m−1 K−1)16 and SiC (280 W m−1 K−1),17 can be a serious issue for dissipating heat quickly and efficiently. Using the time domain thermoreflectance method, the thermal conductivities of β-Ga2O3 along [100], [010] and [001] orientations were measured to be (10.9 ± 1.0) W m−1 K−1, (27.0 ± 2.0) W m−1 K−1 and 15 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature, showing an anisotropic thermal transport.18 Santia et al.19 calculated the lattice thermal conductivity of β-Ga2O3 from the phonon Boltzmann transport equation using first-principles methods. The calculated thermal conductivities were 16.06 W m−1 K−1 for [100], 21.54 W m−1 K−1 for [010] and 21.15 W m−1 K−1 for [001] directions at 300 K, which showed some distinction compared with the experimental results.18,20 However, the predicted thermal conductivities of bulk β-Ga2O3 based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) by Yan et al.21 were close to the experimental values.18,20 Besides, the influences of Ga vacancies and O vacancies on thermal conductivities of β-Ga2O3 were also investigated in their work. They reported that Ga vacancies could lead to a larger suppression in the thermal conductivity than O vacancies.
At the nanoscale, the interfacial thermal transport between adjacent materials plays a vital role in the heat transfer process of devices, particularly when the device size is reduced to a scale comparable to the mean free path of the heat carrier.22 Many experimental studies on the interfacial thermal transport properties between β-Ga2O3 and other materials, such as Au/Ni, Ti or Cr,23 and SiC,24 have been conducted. The thermal boundary conductance values of β-Ga2O3 and SiC were reported to be high (67–100 MW m−2 K−1) and increased with the decrease of interlayer thickness.24 What's more, Ma et al. investigated the interfacial thermal conductance between β-Ga2O3 and different substrates (SiO2, 4H-SiC, α-Al2O3 and Si) by combining the Landauer formula with the acoustic mismatch model and diffusive mismatch model, and reported that the β-Ga2O3/Si interface had the largest interfacial thermal conductance while the β-Ga2O3/SiO2 interface had the smallest one due to the difference in mismatches of impedance and phonon density of states.25 The above research provides basic information about interfacial thermal transport between β-Ga2O3 and metals or semiconductors. In general, the in-plane thermal conductivity of graphene is extremely high (∼5000 W m−1 K−1).26 However, the interfacial thermal transport between graphene and other materials is not satisfactory. For instance, the interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) is 1.72 × 10−7 K m2 W−1 for graphene/MoS2, 2.13 × 10−7 K m2 W−1 for graphene/stanene and 1.91 × 10−7 K m2 W−1 for graphene/MoSe2 at 300 K.27–29 Considering the thermal transport properties of β-Ga2O3 and graphene, the interfacial thermal transport between graphene and β-Ga2O3 is vital in facilitating heat dissipation for devices based on graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of research on the interfacial thermal transport properties of graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions.
In this work, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the interfacial thermal transport properties of graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions. First, an interatomic potential based on a rigid ion model is fitted to describe the atomic interaction in β-Ga2O3. Afterwards, the ITR between graphene and β-Ga2O3 is systematically evaluated. The effects of graphene dimension and β-Ga2O3 thickness, interface type, temperature, vacancy defects and graphene hydrogenation on the ITR of graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions are evaluated. The phonon density of states (PDOS) of graphene and β-Ga2O3 is calculated to help understand the underlying thermal transport mechanism.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Interatomic potential model
The crystal structure of a β-Ga2O3 conventional unit cell is displayed in Fig. 1, and consists of twenty atoms (eight Ga and twelve O atoms). One of the most remarkable characteristics of β-Ga2O3 is the high anisotropic lattice parameters. Moreover, b–c, a–c and a–b comprise three typical planes ((100), (010) and (001)) of β-Ga2O3 respectively, as indicated using dotted lines in varied colors in Fig. 1.

In previous studies, several interatomic potentials for β-Ga2O3 have been developed.30–33 Bush et al.30 proposed a set of Ga and O parameters through fitting the lattice properties of a series of binary metal oxides. Blanco et al.31 developed a potential for studying the energy and migration of point defects in β-Ga2O3. And recently, a set of potential parameters for calculating the vibrational entropy of defective β-Ga2O3 have been released by Wang et al.32 The shell model34 is adopted in the above potentials,30–32 having the advantage to determine the polarization properties of atoms. However, the requirement of a much smaller integration timestep for shell dynamics will cost a lot of computational power. As an alternative, the rigid ion model is also widely used to describe ionic materials,35,36 and has a higher computational efficiency in comparison to the shell model.37 Sahariah et al. formulated and built algorithms for the simulation of low-symmetry perfect crystals using the modified polarizable point ion (MPPI) model, in which the rigid ion model with a Buckingham potential was adopted. But the rigid ion model was selected just for obtaining the initial parameter guess of MPPI calculation,33 and fundamental lattice characteristics of β-Ga2O3 could not be exhibited in their work.
In order to ensure the reproduction of basic physical properties of β-Ga2O3 and improve the computational efficiency at the same time, the rigid ion model is adopted to fit β-Ga2O3 potential in our work. The potential form for describing the interatomic interaction within β-Ga2O3 is expressed as: ϕtotal (rij) = ϕCoulomb (rij) + ϕBuckingham (rij) + ϕMorse (rij)(1) (2) (3) ϕMorse (rij) = De[exp(−2a(rij − r0)) − 2exp(−a(rij − r0))](4)where the total potential energy ϕtotal between atom species can be divided into a long-range coulombic interaction and a short-range interaction, and Buckingham potential and Morse potential are included in the short-range interaction. In eqn (2), qi and qj represent the charges of atom i and atom j, respectively. Following the successful implementation of the Beest–Kramer–Santen (BKS) potential,38 the partial charge is adopted, in which the charges of Ga and O atoms are +1.8e and −1.2e (i.e. qGa = +1.8e and qO = −1.2e). The Ewald method39 is used to evaluate the coulombic interactions. In fact, using partial charge with the Buckingham potential is a common and reasonable choice to exhibit electrostatic interactions of many ionic materials.40,41 In eqn (3), A, ρ and C are three adjustable parameters of Buckingham potential. Additionally, considering the partial covalent properties of β-Ga2O342 and the absence of covalent bonding in the BKS potential, the Morse potential43 is introduced to describe the covalence of Ga–O bonding within β-Ga2O3. De, a and r0 in the Morse potential (eqn (4)) can also be adjusted in the fitting process. The cut-off distances for short-range Buckingham and Morse potentials are set as 15 Å.
2.2 Interatomic potential fitting
The fitting of the potential parameters in this work is conducted using the General Utility Lattice Program (GULP) package.44 The fitting procedure is as follows: the Buckingham potential parameters for O–O interaction extracted from the BKS potential38 are fixed throughout the whole fitting procedure, and the rest are fitted to match the lattice structure of β-Ga2O3. It is worth illustrating that other properties such as elastic constants or bulk modulus (experimental values) are not included in the first fitting process. In the coming step, some of the parameters that are obtained from the first step are adjusted first and then fixed to fit the other parameters in order to match the elastic constants of β-Ga2O3 as far as possible. After several rounds until a reasonable set of potential parameters are obtained, the calculated lattice parameters and elastic constants should be adequately acceptable, and then the fitting procedure is deemed to be finished. Our potential model includes 14 parameters, of which 9 parameters need to be fitted after the charges and the Buckingham potential parameters for O–O interaction are decided. Table 1 summarizes the parameters we develop through the above procedure.

After obtaining the parameters, we further apply them to calculate the lattice constants, elastic constants (Cxx), and bulk modulus (B) using GULP44 for verifying the fitted interatomic potential. The calculated lattice constants and the experimental data45 are listed in Table 2. More information about the lattice structure like space group and atom coordinates that are relaxed using the fitted potential parameters is provided in the ESI.†Table 3 gives the results of the elastic constant and bulk modulus calculations. The results of these basic physical properties of β-Ga2O3 are in excellent agreement with the theoretical investigation46–48 and the experimental values.49,50 Furthermore, the full frequency range phonon dispersion values along high symmetry paths Γ (0, 0, 0)–X (0.5, 0, 0), Γ (0, 0, 0)–Y (0, 0.5, 0) and Γ (0, 0, 0)–Z (0, 0, 0.5), which are perpendicular to the three typical planes (100), (010) and (001) as shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI,† are also calculated using GULP44 and are depicted in Fig. 2(a–c). It can be seen that there is no imaginary frequency in the calculated phonon dispersions, which illustrates the fact that the β-Ga2O3 configuration is thermodynamically stable under the description of the fitted interatomic potential parameters. The three acoustic branches LA, TA1 and TA2 are extracted and the three acoustic phonon dispersions calculated by DFT21 are presented to validate the feasibility of the interatomic potential in Fig. 2(d–f). The result shows that the calculated three acoustic phonon dispersions using the fitted potential parameters match the DFT results well. To sum up, it is certified that the interatomic potential we fit can well describe the physical properties of β-Ga2O3. In the following sections, this new fitted interatomic potential will be applied in MD simulations.

2.3 Molecular dynamics simulation
The ITR calculation of graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions is conducted using the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) package.51 The second-generation reactive interatomic bond order (REBO)52 is selected to describe the C–C interaction in graphene. The interatomic interaction within β-Ga2O3 is described using the above fitted potential. In order to save computational cost and improve computational efficiency, the particle–particle particle-mesh (PPPM) solver53 for Ewald summation is used to calculate the coulombic interactions between ions. The 12-6 Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential is used to describe the van der Waals interaction between graphene and β-Ga2O3. (5)where ε is the energy parameter, σ is the atomic length parameter and r is the interatomic distance. According to the universal force field,54 the ε and σ are calculated, where εC–Ga = 9.065 meV, εC–O = 3.447 meV, σC–Ga = 3.660 Å and σC–O = 3.271 Å. The cut-off distance for the van der Waals interaction pairs is set to 3.5σ. The graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction (100) interface model is displayed in Fig. 3(a), and it should be noted that the graphene is placed above β-Ga2O3 with a height of 3.0 Å initially.55
 Fig. 3  (a) The illustration of the (100) interface of the graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction. An ultrafast thermal impulse is applied on graphene. The temperatures of graphene (red region) and β-Ga2O3 (blue region) are recorded during the MD process. (b) The temperature and energy evolutions during the relaxation process. The red and blue lines indicate the temperature evolutions of graphene and β-Ga2O3, respectively. The black dotted line shows the energy evolution of graphene. (c) The linear fitting of energy with temperature difference integration based on eqn (7). 
In this work, the transient heating method56,57 is employed to calculate the ITR between graphene and β-Ga2O3. In the molecular dynamics simulation, periodic boundary conditions are applied in x, y and z directions, and the time step is set to 0.5 fs. The initial graphene/β-Ga2O3 model is put into the canonical ensemble (NVT) for 500 ps to reach an equilibrium state at the designated temperature, after which a micro-canonical ensemble (NVE) is applied for another 500 ps to keep the system energy conserved. Then an ultrafast thermal impulse of 8 × 1012 W m−2 is imposed on the graphene for a short duration of 50 fs (Fig. 3(a)), which will bring about a temperature rise in the graphene while the temperature of β-Ga2O3 remains unchanged. Due to the enclosed space environment, the only way for heat dissipation in the system is from graphene to β-Ga2O3. Therefore, after withdrawing the thermal impulse, a relaxation process in which the energy propagates from graphene to β-Ga2O3 will take place. Then the ITR can be obtained by the equation: (6)where Egra is the energy of graphene, t is the relaxation time, A is the interfacial area, R is the ITR, Tgra is the temperature of graphene, and Tβ-Ga2O3 is the average temperature of top layers of β-Ga2O3 atoms. By integrating eqn (6), we can obtain the following equation: (7)in which E0 is the initial energy of graphene. The ITR can be evaluated then using eqn (7). Fig. 3(b) shows a representative temperature evolution of graphene and β-Ga2O3 during the relaxing process, and Fig. 3(c) exhibits the linear fitting of energy with temperature difference integration based on eqn (7). For each data point, three independent MD simulation runs with different initial conditions are executed, and the final results are calculated by averaging each run and are shown with standard deviation as error bars.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Effect of graphene dimension and β-Ga2O3 thickness
At the nanoscale, due to the phonon-boundary scattering, phonon transport is dependent on the system size. Thus, we first investigate the effect of system size (including graphene dimension and β-Ga2O3 thickness) on the ITR of the graphene/β-Ga2O3 (100) interface at 300 K. Three graphene monolayers are constructed with dimensions (x × y) of 4.87 × 4.72, 6.08 × 5.90 and 7.60 × 7.67 nm2 while the thickness of β-Ga2O3 is fixed at 3.52 nm to explore the effect of graphene dimension on the ITR. Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of thickness of β-Ga2O3 on the ITR, the thickness of β-Ga2O3 is enlarged to 4.69 and 5.86 nm and the dimension of graphene (4.87 × 4.72 nm2) is fixed. In total, five systems with different sizes are built. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that the ITR values remain relatively constant for various dimensions of graphene and thicknesses of β-Ga2O3. The same conclusion has been reported in previous studies on the interfacial thermal transport properties of other heterojunction structures.56,58

3.2 Effect of interface type and temperature
Considering that there are three typical planes ((100) plane, (010) plane and (001) plane) in the β-Ga2O3 crystal (Fig. 1), we further investigate the effect of interface type on the ITR of the graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction at different temperatures from 300 K to 700 K. Three different heterojunction interfaces are denoted as (100), (010) and (001) interfaces for simplification. The dimensions (x × y) of β-Ga2O3 of the three interfaces are (4.87 × 4.72) nm2 for the (100) interface, (4.84 × 4.57) nm2 for the (010) interface and (4.84 × 4.56) nm2 for the (001) interface, and the corresponding thicknesses are 3.52 nm, 3.65 nm and 3.43 nm, respectively. The zigzag and armchair directions of graphene are along the x axis and y axis respectively, for all three interfaces. In order to satisfy the periodic conditions, the graphene lattices are adjusted and the lattice constant mismatch ratios (x × y) of graphene are (1.09% × −0.66%), (1.58% × 2.51%) and (1.59% × 2.66%) for the three interfaces. Previous reports have demonstrated that such lattice constant modifications of graphene will not affect the ITR results.27,59 From Fig. 5, the ITR values of the three kinds of graphene/β-Ga2O3 (100), (010) and (001) interfaces at 300 K are 7.28 ± 0.35 × 10−8 K m2 W−1, 6.69 ± 0.44 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 and 5.22 ± 0.35 × 10−8 K m2 W−1, respectively. And they are in the same order of magnitude of the ITR values of the silicene/Si/SiO2, graphene/DNTT, graphene/Si and graphene/SiC heterojunctions.56,60–62 With the increase of temperature, the ITR values of the three interfaces decrease monotonously. The ITR values of the three interfaces are reduced to 4.23 ± 0.47 × 10−8 K m2 W−1, 4.01 ± 0.72 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 and 3.62 ± 0.42 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 when the temperature is increased to 700 K.
 Fig. 5  ITR of the three interfaces of graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions at different temperatures from 300 K to 700 K. 
The phonon density of states (PDOS) is an important indicator to reveal the phonon transport mechanism,58,60 which can be calculated by taking a Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF):63–65 (8)where v is the atomic velocity, ω represents the angular frequency, and the angle brackets denote the ensemble average. We calculate the PDOS of the three interfaces of the graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction (Fig. 6). From Fig. 6(a–c), phonons of β-Ga2O3 are mainly located in the low-frequency region below 30 THz. A blue-shift phenomenon of the G-band peak of PDOS is observed; phonons in the graphene of the (001) interface occupy a broader frequency region and are softer in comparison to those of (100) and (010) interfaces, which indicates a transition of phonons from the high-frequency to low-frequency region. Moreover, we can find from Fig. 6(d–f) that there is an obvious transformation from in-plane (high-frequency) to out-of-plane (low-frequency) phonons in graphene. The motivation of low-frequency phonons prompts the coupling of graphene and β-Ga2O3. Therefore, the (001) interface possesses the smallest ITR among the three interfaces.

In order to explain the temperature effect on the ITR, the PDOS of graphene and β-Ga2O3 under different temperatures is calculated (Fig. 7). It can be observed that the G-band peak of graphene at 700 K is lower than that at 300 K, and the low-frequency phonon population is enlarged at 700 K. These phenomena manifest that high-frequency phonons decrease while the low-frequency phonons pile up, which is caused by the shortening of the mean free path that comes from the enhanced Umklapp phonon scattering at high temperatures. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 7(d–f), the low-frequency region is mainly occupied by graphene out-of-plane phonons, and consequently the decomposition of the in-plane phonons gives rise to more possibility of transferring energy within the graphene. As reported in previous studies on the ITR of graphene and other materials,60,66 the out-of-plane phonons (ZA) mainly occupy the low-frequency region of 0–30 THz, while the in-plane phonons (LA, TA) occupy the high-frequency region of 40–50 THz, and the phonon coupling of LA to TA is faster several fold than that of LA/TA to ZA phonons. Thus, one of the resistances of interfacial thermal transport comes from the coupling of the lateral (LA/TA) and out-of-plane phonons (ZA). Therefore, the highly efficient coupling of graphene phonons between in-plane and out-of-plane boosts the interfacial thermal transport in graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions at high temperatures.

3.3 Effect of vacancy defects
During the fabrication of graphene and β-Ga2O3, vacancy defects can be a common phenomenon due to the processing technology. The existence of vacancy defects will deteriorate the performance of devices.67,68 Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of vacancy defects on the ITR. In this part, single-vacancy defects of graphene and β-Ga2O3 are established by deleting atoms randomly at the (100) interface, respectively. It should be noted that the vacancy defects of β-Ga2O3 are created within the “Tβ-Ga2O3” region rather than the whole β-Ga2O3 model. Fig. 8 shows that the ITR decreases from 7.28 ± 0.35 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 to 3.03 ± 0.38 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 monotonically with the increasing graphene vacancy concentration from 0% to 6%. This suggests that although the existence of vacancies in graphene can induce phonon-vacancy scattering and hinder the in-plane thermal transport of the graphene monolayer, the out-of-plane interfacial thermal propagation will be improved, which is consistent with the ITR of graphene/amorphous-SiO2 and graphene/phosphorene.69,70 To reveal the internal thermal transport mechanism, the PDOS of graphene and β-Ga2O3 of various vacancy concentrations are calculated. Similar to the PDOS of graphene at different temperatures, vacancy defects of graphene can make its PDOS broader and softer, which can be found in Fig. 9(a–c). Additionally, the increase of low-frequency phonons of graphene facilitates the phonon coupling between graphene and β-Ga2O3. And from Fig. 9(d–f), it can be found that the in-plane phonon modes of graphene are modified obviously after the vacancy defects are created, in-plane high-frequency phonons are suppressed, and more modes of low-frequency phonons are observed, which strengthens the conversion between in-plane and out-of-plane phonons in graphene. Hence, the existence of vacancy defects in the graphene monolayer will boost the energy propagation from graphene to β-Ga2O3.

From Fig. 8, it can be concluded that ITR can be reduced by 29.95% when the concentration of β-Ga2O3 vacancy defects increasing up to 6%, while the ITR will be reduced by 58.38% with the graphene vacancies at the same concentration level. As depicted in Fig. 10(a–c), although vacancy defects are added to β-Ga2O3, there is no distinct effect that is observed in the PDOS of β-Ga2O3. However, the existence of vacancy defects in β-Ga2O3 reduces the number of high-frequency phonons of graphene to some extent (Fig. 10(d–f)). Compared to the effect of graphene vacancy defects, this effect is relatively smaller.

3.4 Effect of graphene hydrogenation
Although there are many novel properties of graphene, the zero-bandgap nature impedes its direct application in the photoelectric field. An effective method to solve this problem is to conduct chemical functionalization on graphene, such as hydrogenation.71 It is reported that not only the zero-bandgap situation but also the elastic properties, carrier mobility and magnetic states can be significantly improved.72 Owing to the enhancement of photoelectric performance through hydrogenation, the thermal transport issues should be taken into account, which may affect the serviceability of devices. Thus, the interfacial thermal transport between hydrogenated graphene and β-Ga2O3 is evaluated in this part.
Hydrogen atoms are added to the surface of graphene randomly to minimize the effects of hydrogen distribution. The hydrogen coverage ratio is defined as η = NH/NC, where NH is the hydrogen atom number and NC is the carbon atom number in graphene. It should be noted that the same number of hydrogen atoms are added to both sides (top and bottom) of graphene (i.e. Ntop = Nbottom = (1/2)NH). Fig. 11 shows the ITR of hydrogenated graphene and β-Ga2O3 with the hydrogen coverage ratio varying from 0% to 100% at 300 K. The ITR value decreases from 7.28 ± 0.35 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 to 1.43 ± 0.08 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 when η increases from 0% to 20%, and then remains at a stable value between 20% and 90%. When the hydrogen coverage ratio reaches 100%, the hydrogenated graphene turns into graphane.73 The ITR value is enhanced to twice that at 90%. The total variation trend of ITR agrees with the previous reports.59,60 From Fig. 11, it can be observed that 5% hydrogen coverage ratio can cause a dramatic decrease (about 58.77%) of ITR, which means that a small degree of hydrogenation of graphene can contribute to the interfacial thermal transport enhancement between graphene and β-Ga2O3 to a large extent. In general, the addition of H atoms provides more scattering points and turns the pristine graphene from the sp2 to sp3 hybridized system, and thus the whole phonon scattering becomes more complex. In addition, as thermal energies are imposed to all directions equally during the ultrafast heating process, the lateral direction takes two-thirds of the added thermal energies, which further transfers to the out-of-plane direction. Compared with the pristine graphene/β-Ga2O3 system, new channels for in-plane and out-of-plane phonon couplings are opened due to the existence of hydrogen atoms, with the interfacial thermal transport enhanced as a result. However, the effect of hydrogenation becomes less influential with the increase of coverage ratio.
 Fig. 11  ITR of graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions at different hydrogen coverage ratios at 300 K. 
The PDOS of graphene and β-Ga2O3 at 10%, 60% and 100% hydrogen coverage ratios is displayed in Fig. 12. It can be observed that the G-band is softened obviously after adding H atoms by comparing Fig. 7(a) and 12(a and b). Meanwhile, a peak comes into existence at a frequency of 87 THz, which prompts the direct thermal transport from H atoms to β-Ga2O3. Acting as scattering points, H atoms deform the out-of-plane phonon modes remarkably compared with pristine graphene, which is depicted in Fig. 12(d–f). As the graphene is hydrogenated completely, graphene is transformed into graphane without vacancies, and a large proportion of the high-frequency region is taken possession by vibrational mode phonons. Consequently, thermal transport from graphene to β-Ga2O3 is hindered, with its ITR value further increased.

4. Conclusions
In this study, the interfacial thermal transport of graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunctions is systematically investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. Based on the rigid-ion model, the interatomic interaction in β-Ga2O3 is fitted by combining coulomb, Buckingham and Morse potentials. A set of reasonable parameters are obtained, which are proved to provide a good description of lattice parameters, elastic constants, bulk modulus and acoustic phonon dispersions of β-Ga2O3. Using the fitted interatomic interaction potential, the effects of model size, interface type, temperature, vacancy defects and graphene hydrogenation on the ITR between graphene and β-Ga2O3 are investigated. It is reported that the thermal resistance of three different graphene/β-Ga2O3 interfaces at 300 K is 7.28 ± 0.35 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 for the (100) interface, 6.69 ± 0.44 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 for the (010) interface and 5.22 ± 0.35 × 10−8 K m2 W−1 for the (001) interface. The increase of temperature can soften the PDOS of graphene and prompt phonon transport from in-plane to out-of-plane. It is found that both graphene and β-Ga2O3 vacancies can enhance the energy propagation from graphene to β-Ga2O3, which is induced by a combined effect that comes from the improvement of graphene/β-Ga2O3 energy coupling and in-plane/out-of-plane phonon coupling in graphene. In addition, graphene hydrogenation can reduce the ITR of the graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction dramatically, facilitating the heat transport across graphene and β-Ga2O3. In particular, due to the fact that new channels for in-plane and out-of-plane phonon couplings are opened, a 5% hydrogen coverage ratio of graphene can cause a 58.77% drop of the ITR value. This work provides a basic insight into the interfacial thermal transport of the graphene/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction and will be significant to the thermal management of graphene/β-Ga2O3 based photoelectric devices.
