    AbstractTwo ruthenium sensitizers, [Ru(dcbpy)(opip)(NCS)2] (JF-1, dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine, opip = 2-(4-octylphenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline) and [Ru(dcbpy)(otip)(NCS)2] (JF-2, otip = 2-(5-octylthiophen-2-yl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline), with unusually high power-conversion efficiency in comparison with other ruthenium complexes containing 1,10-phenanthroline-based ligands were designed. The power-conversion efficiency of JF-2 is 20% higher than that of JF-1, due to the modification of the ancillary ligand with a thiophene moiety. The origins of this device performance diversity are illustrated by photophysical properties, electrochemical data and density functional theory (DFT) studies. The greater device performance of JF-2 compared to JF-1 was caused from the broader MLCT distribution, the appropriate localization of the frontier orbitals and the stronger driving force of the charge injection and regeneration.
Introduction
There have been enormous recent endeavors in the study of ruthenium-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), because of their high photon-to-current conversion efficiency, ease of preparation and low cost compared with traditional silicon-based photovoltaic cells.1 The wide range and high molar absorption coefficient of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) characteristics, as well as the appropriate localization of the frontier orbitals of ruthenium-based sensitizers are important determinants of device performance.2 Thereupon, the molecular engineering of sensitizers to raise and broaden absorption ambits and harmonize the localization of frontier orbitals represent highly critical strategies.3 Several papers have recently reported the modification of ancillary ligands in ruthenium complexes by light-harvesting chromophores such as thiophene,2d furan3g and carbazole3h moieties, which have the potential to enhance the molar absorption coefficient of MLCT and to tune the molecular orbitals more efficiently. In addition, in most studies, the power-conversion efficiencies of ruthenium complexes containing 1,10-phenanthroline-based ligands have been reported to be relatively low.4 We envisage that modification of the 1,10-phenanthroline-based ancillary ligand with thiophene or other functional groups may represent an alternative route to improving device performance.
To test this concept, we synthesized two ruthenium photosensitizers (Fig. 1), [Ru(dcbpy)(opip)(NCS)2] (JF-1, dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine, opip = 2-(4-octylphenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline) and [Ru(dcbpy)(otip)(NCS)2] (JF-2, otip = 2-(5-octylthiophen-2-yl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline) using a one-pot synthetic procedure (Scheme S1 and S2, ESI†).5 It is noteworthy that, our results indicate that device performance, when JF-1 or JF-2 are used as sensitizers, is surprisingly high in comparison with other ruthenium complexes that contain 1,10-phenanthroline-based ligands.4 Moreover, the device performance of JF-2 is greater than that of JF-1. The origins of this difference can be explained by spectral, electrochemical data and density functional theory (DFT) studies.

Results and discussion
Solar cell properties
The current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the photovoltaic devices containing JF-1, JF-2 and N3, where N3 is [Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2] are shown in Fig. 2 and detailed cell performance data are listed in Table 1. The open-circuit potentials (Voc) of JF-1 and JF-2 were 0.78 V. The short-circuit photocurrents (Isc) and power-conversion efficiencies (η) for JF-1 and JF-2 were 12.9 mA cm−2, 6.9% and 16.3 mA cm−2, 8.3%, respectively. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves for JF-1 and JF-2 showed broad bands that covered nearly the entire visible range from 350 to 700 nm, with maxima of 71.2% and 81.6% at 530 nm (Fig. 2). The conversion photocurrent density can also be estimated by integrating the IPCE values at each wavelength and the photon flux density data listed in the AM 1.5 solar spectrum (100 mW cm−2).6 Accordingly, the values were calculated to be 11.6, 13.2 and 12.6 mA cm−2 for JF-1-, JF-2- and standard N3-sensitized solar cells, respectively. These values, calculated from the integration of the IPCE curves, are smaller than those of the I–V curve measured from our AM 1.5 simulated light source. The deviation for these performance parameters can be calculated from the spectra mismatch factor (M, see ESI†). Based on the photocurrents, determined from the I–V curves and calculated from the IPCE curves, the values of M were determined to be 1.11, 1.23 and 1.22 for JF-1-, JF-2- and N3-sensitized solar cells, respectively. The corrected values for η, calibrated by the spectra mismatch factor, are listed in Table 1.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The UV absorption spectra of opip and otip ligands showed intense absorption bands (278–340 nm) in the high energy region, which are assigned to a ligand-centered π–π* transitions and emissions in the range 440–460 nm are from the triplet intra-ligand state in the DMF solution at room temperature (ESI†). Both UV-vis and emission spectra showed that the profile of the otip ligand is red-shifted and covers a wider range compared with opip.
The UV-vis spectrum of N3 consists of three main features, assigned as bands I, II and III with increasing energy order.7 By comparing the experimental absorption spectra of JF-1 and JF-2 with those of the free ligands opip (278 and 322 nm) and otip (286 and 341 nm, see Fig. S2, ESI†), the intense absorption at 291–298 nm for JF-1 and JF-2 originates predominantly from the π–π* transition of the ligands (band III). The experimental optical extinction coefficients for the MLCT (0.99) of JF-2 was slightly less than that (1.09) of JF-1 in DMF solution (Fig. 3, Table 1). Nevertheless, the Isc and η for JF-2 were greater than those for JF-1. The computed ground-state vertical excitation energies with an oscillator strength (f) greater than 0.01 are shown in Fig. 4 and 5 and Table 2. Overall, the experimental and predicted electronic spectra are in good agreement. Analyses of transitions and orbital contributions indicate that band I of JF-2 included the 63% MLCT transition, which is comparable with that (63%) of JF-1. However, JF-1 has a pure π–π* parentage of band III with no metal contribution, but JF-2 has a sizable MLCT (46%, Table 2). For this reason, the thiophene moiety in the structure of JF-2 causes a wide distribution of MLCT transition and leads to an unusually high device performance for JF-2. The dye-loading measurements showed that the extinction coefficients of the MLCT bands of JF-1 and JF-2 in solution, that desorbed from the TiO2 surface, were very high (Fig. 6), because of the larger quantity of dye adsorbed to the TiO2 surface (list in Table 1).2a,8 The light-harvesting efficiencies (LHE) of JF-1 and JF-2 were measured and the LHE values indicate that the additional light absorbed from the TiO2 surface is beneficial for device performance. These factors also improved the device performance of JF-1 and JF-2. The metal centered oxidation potentials of JF-1 and JF-2 were determined to be 0.83 and 0.86 (V vs. SCE), respectively. The oxidation of both complexes is irreversible. This is because the oxidation potential of the thiocyanate ligand is close to that for Ru(II), as observed for other ruthenium dyes.3d The Ru(III/II) oxidation potential of complex JF-2 is more positive than that of JF-1, reflecting the greater electron-withdrawing potential of the otip ligand compared to opip.9

Computational studies
The electronic structure and localization of the frontier orbitals of JF-1, JF-2 and N3, obtained by DFT calculation, are illustrated in Fig. 7. The ground state geometries of the complexes were optimized in the gas phase (Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†) and compared to the N3 dye. For JF-2 and N3, the highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are both localized on the mixed Ru-t2g and NCS-π orbital,10 and the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are located on the anchoring ligands (dcbpy). These molecular orbital distributions are in good agreement with the reported data.2b,c Although, the LUMO of JF-1 is the same as those of JF-2 and N3, the HOMO of JF-1 which contributed to the 1,10-phenanthroline moiety of the ancillary ligand differed from that of JF-2 and N3. Similarities and differences among JF-1, JF-2 and N3 were identified using the electrochemical data (Table 1) and the energy band gaps referred to DFT calculated values (Fig. 8). The HOMO energy level of JF-2 is more positive than the iodide electron donor compared with JF-1. This provides a stronger driving force for efficient dye regeneration, and the avoidance to geminate charge recombination. Moreover, the LUMO energy level of JF-2 is more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 relative to JF-1, which also ensures the driving force for charge injection.3g Based on the above-mentioned results, the thiophene moiety in the structure of JF-2 could tune the localization of the frontier orbitals appropriately and enhance the driving force for charge injection and regeneration, thus making the device performance of JF-2 superior than that of JF-1. The next highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO-1 to HOMO-4) of JF-1 and JF-2 were mainly metal-centered orbitals and π-bonding interactions between the dπ orbitals of the Ru centers and the π orbital of the ligand (Fig. S4, ESI†). The orbital energy splitting between the HOMO and HOMO-4, that is, the overall splitting of d(t2g) in JF-2, is greater than that of JF-1 (0.32 and 0.17 eV, respectively) and is consistent with a greater degree of metal–ligand interaction in JF-2.9

Experimental section
Materials and instrumentation
All reagents were obtained from commercial sources and were used as received. Solvents were dried over sodium or calcium hydride and distilled before use. The 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione and 5-octylthiophene-2-carboxaldehyde were prepared according to the reported literature procedure.11,12

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-400 FT-NMR spectrometer in DMSO-d6. Elemental analyses were performed using a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer. FAB-MS data were obtained using a JMS-700 double focusing mass spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Hewlett Packard 8453 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded using a CHI 621B electrochemical analyzer with a Pt electrode as working electrode, Pt wire as auxiliary electrode and SCE electrode as a reference electrode. All electrochemical experiments were done under an anhydrous and argon-saturated solution at 298 K. CV was measured with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as a supporting electrolyte in dimethylformamide. In these conditions, the Eox½ of ferrocene was 0.41 V vs. SCE. The scan rate of CV was 100 mV s−1. The HOMO and LUMO energies of ruthenium complexes obtained from the theoretical calculations were coupled with the redox potential obtained from the cyclic voltammetry measurements as shown in main text.
Computational methods
All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 03 (G03) program package,13 employing the DFT method with Becke's three parameter hybrid function14 and Lee–Yang–Parr's gradient corrected correlation function (B3LYP).15 The LanL2DZ effective core potential16 was used for the Ru atom, and the split-valence 6-31G** basis set17 was applied for all other atoms. The ground-state geometries of the complexes were optimized in the gas phase. Octyl chains were replaced with ethyl groups in our calculations. The presence of these long alkyl chains enhanced the solubility of these molecular systems but, from a computational point of view, their replacement with shorter chains does not affect the optimized structures of the molecules. Geometry optimization was performed without any constraint, and frequency calculations were carried out to ensure that the geometries obtained were indeed minima and not saddle points. Molecular orbitals were visualized using ‘Gauss View 3.09’. For orbital contributions, additional single-point energy calculations were conducted on the gas phase optimized geometries using the same method, the same basis set, and the molecular orbital compositions were analyzed using the AOMIX program.18
TDDFT calculations for JF-1, JF-2 and N3 were performed using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model method (C–PCM)19–21 with dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent.22 DMF was chosen as the solvent to be consistent with the experimental data. Forty-five singlet excited states were determined starting from geometry-optimized structures of JF-1 and JF-2. Computational results are summarized in Tables 2 and S1 (ESI†). GaussSum 1.0523 was used for the simulation of the electronic spectrum.

Preparation of TiO2 electrode
The preparation of the TiO2 precursor and the electrode fabrication were carried out based on previous reports.2d,4b The TiO2 film, serving as the photoanode in this work, was prepared through the general sol–gel method. The precursor solution was made according to the following procedure: 430 mL of 0.1 M nitric acid solution under vigorous stirring was dropped with 72 mL Ti(C3H7O)4 slowly to form a mixture. After the hydrolysis, the mixture was heated at 85 °C in a water bath and stirred vigorously for 8 h in order to achieve peptization. When the mixture was cooled down to room temperature, the resultant colloid was filtered, and then heated in an autoclave at a temperature of 240 °C for 12 h to grow the TiO2 particles. When the colloid was cooled down to room temperature, it was ultrasonically vibrated for 10 min. The TiO2 colloid was concentrated to 13 wt%, and 30 wt% (with respect to the TiO2 weight) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, MW = 20000 and 200000) was added to prevent film from cracking during drying. To fabricate the TiO2 electrode, TTIP (titanium(IV) isopropoxide) was well-mixed with ME (2-methoxylethanol) (in the weight ratio 1 : 3) to form the metallo-organic solution. The metallo-organic solution was then spin-coated onto the clean conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses with a sheet resistivity of 13 Ω/square, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min to form a thin TiO2 compact layer. On top of this compact film, TiO2 paste was applied three times using the glass rod to obtain the appropriate thickness. For the first coating (paste 1), the TiO2 colloid mixed with PEG with a molecular weight of 200000. The second coating, using TiO2 paste (paste 2) contained TiO2 colloids and PEG with a molecular weight of 20000. Paste 2, mixed with the light scattering particles of TiO2 (300 nm, 30 wt% in total TiO2), was used for the third (final) coating to reduce the light loss by back scattering.
Dye-loading measurements
The dye loading measurements on TiO2 films were carried out by desorbing the dye into 0.1 M NaOH solution in CH3OH and then measuring the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the resultant solution with the same dilution. The adsorbed density of each dye was calculated from the difference concentration of each solution before and after TiO2 film immersion.
DSCs device fabrication
The TiO2 film electrode with a 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 geometric area was immersed into the acetonitrile/tert-butanol mixtures (volume ratio 1 : 1), containing 2 × 10−4 M dye sensitizers, overnight. A platinized FTO was used as a counter electrode and an active area of 0.16 cm2 was controlled by adhered polyester tape with a thickness of 60 µm. The dye-sensitized photoanode was rinsed with acetonitrile and dried in air. After filling the cell space with electrolyte, the photoanode was placed on top of the counter electrode and tightly clipped together to form a cell. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M butylmethylimidazolium (BMII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) dissolved in acetonitrile. The photovoltaic characterizations on the solar cells equipped with a mask were carried out using a modified light source, 450 W Xe lamp (Oriel, 6266), equipped with a water-based IR filter and AM 1.5 filter (Oriel, 81075). Light intensity was attenuated by a neutral density filter (Optosigma, 078-0360) at the measuring (cell) position, and was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2 according to the reading from a radiant power meter (Oriel, 70260) connected to a thermopile probe (Oriel, 70263). Photoelectrochemical characteristic photocurrent density–voltage curves of the DSCs were recorded using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands).
Conclusions
In conclusion, two ruthenium sensitizers, JF-1 and JF-2, containing 1,10-phenanthroline-based ancillary ligands with unusually high power-conversion efficiencies were designed and prepared. Modification of the ancillary ligand with a thiophene moiety in the ruthenium complex could enhance the driving force for charge injection and regeneration, tune the localization of the frontier orbitals appropriately and broaden the distribution of the MLCT bands, thus improving device performance. This finding opens an alternative strategy for the design of sophisticated 1,10-phenanthroline-based ligands for improving the device performance of ruthenium sensitizers.
