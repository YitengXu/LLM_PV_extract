    , Accepted 24th September 2018First published on 24th September 2018AbstractProcessing for obtaining compact and uniform perovskite photoactive layers has been intensively studied over the last few years to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in solar cells. Particularly, high quality crystal growth of perovskite layers is critical to enhance device performance. We demonstrate an easy and effective new process for high efficiency p–i–n planar heterojunction structures of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) by using a compact seed perovskite layer (CSPL). The CSPL assists vertical growth of perovskite crystals and obtains the highly crystalline perovskite photoactive layer, which leads to the reduction in the charge transfer resistance and a longer photoluminescence lifetime. The PeSC device with a CSPL shows a remarkably improved PCE, from 15.07% to 19.25%, with a record open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.16 V in the p–i–n structure with pure crystal perovskite and negligible current density–voltage hysteresis. Additionally, a PCE of 20.37% was achieved in CSPL assisted n–i–p structure PeSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites have emerged as potential materials for next generation solar cells due to their own outstanding optoelectronic properties and unique physical characteristics which originate from their long diffusion length and low carrier recombination.1–6 In the last 5 years, organic–inorganic halide perovskite based solar cells (PeSCs) have rapidly evolved to exhibit remarkable performance, with over 22.7% power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved in the conventional mesoporous architecture (n–i–p structure), which is composed of bottom electrode/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/hole transport layer/top electrode.7,8 However, the n–i–p structure of PeSCs needs high temperatures (>400 °C) to sinter a compact and mesoporous TiO2 layer, which increases the fabrication cost of the device and restricts the flexible plastic substrates.4,9,10 Furthermore, the n–i–p structure requires expensive, high work function metal electrodes such as Au and Pt in the top electrode position. This high cost fabrication of the n–i–p perovskite structure can be a concern to the commercialization market. As an alternative to these problems, inverted structure (p–i–n structured) PeSCs have been extensively studied due to their several advantages such as easy fabrication, lack of hysteresis, and long-term stability.11–15 In addition, the p–i–n structure provides not only a low temperature solution process that offers a wide choice of flexible substrates, but also low cost device processing for commercial applications.16,17 However, the PCE of p–i–n structured PeSCs is still lower than that of the n–i–p structured PeSCs because of low open circuit voltages (VOC) of 1.00 V compared to 1.15 V in n–i–p structured PeSCs as certified device standard.18,19
Several attempts have been made to fabricate perovskite active layers to make a homogeneous, crystalline, high density and full surface coverage perovskite film.20,21 Although the mechanism of perovskite layer formation is not clear, attempts have been made to achieve a homogeneous film and pinhole-free perovskite layer.22–25 As a result of these efforts, many methods like solvent engineering, intermolecular exchange, solvent vapor annealing and additive-assisted deposition have been developed to achieve high quality perovskite films by controlling the perovskite grain boundary and crystalline growth behavior.10,26–29 Although these methods are excellent guidelines for high quality films, there have been some shortcomings for each method. For example, the solvent engineering method requires the dropping of the anti-solvent on the perovskite film in a consistent location which makes partially non-uniform crystal grains on the whole perovskite film, which leads to poor device reproducibility and adverse effects for large-scale production.30
To achieve high quality perovskite films, we demonstrated, for the first time, how to employ an easy and effective process for high efficiency p–i–n planar structures of PeSCs by using a compact seed perovskite layer (CSPL). The compact seed layer induces the assisted vertical growth of the perovskite crystal domains as well as improving adhesion between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite active layer, which leads to an improvement in the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film. The solar cell architecture is composed of a PTAA/perovskite seed layer: perovskite/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/Al layers on top of indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. With our new device architecture, we achieved a record VOC of 1.16 V and a PCE of 19.24% using pure crystal perovskite with negligible hysteresis while retaining a high VOC and fill factor (FF) value.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials preparation
Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) and F4-TCNQ were purchased from Jilin OLED. Anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 2-propanol (IPA) and anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used without purification. Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was prepared as reported previously in the literature. Formamidinium acetate, hydriodic acid (57% in water with a stabilizer), hydrobromic acid (48% in water), and methylamine (40% in methanol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka, and TCI. Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was synthesized as reported elsewhere. Briefly, 15 g of formamidine acetate was reacted with 30 mL of hydriodic acid in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask at 0 °C for 1 h with stirring. Methylamine bromide (MABr) was also synthesized by combining 27.86 mL of methylamine and 44 mL of hydriodic acid in a 250 mL round-bottomed flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. From the solution, a light yellow colored precipitate was obtained by evaporating the solutions at 70 °C for 1 h. The resulting products were dissolved in ethanol and precipitated using diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated until white powers were obtained, and then recrystallized from ethanol and diethyl ether with slow gas diffusion over 3 days. After recrystallization, the resulting powders were collected and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The other organic cations were purchased from Dyesol and lead salts were bought from TCI. Spiro-OMeTAD and FK209 were purchased from EM-Index.
2.2 Solar cell fabrication and characterization

p–i–n structure. 
10 mg PTAA was dissolved in 1 mL di-methylchlorobenzene (DCB) with 1 wt% F4-TCNQ and stirred at 60 °C overnight. To prepare the perovskite precursor solutions, 1.3 mM PbI2 was dissolved in 1 mL DMF and MAI precursor was varied from 50 mg mL−1 to 65 mg mL−1 in IPA. The obtained solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultra-sonication in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each. The PTAA layer was deposited onto cleaned ITO substrates by spin-casting at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 140 °C for 10 min. For devices without a CSPL, MAI precursor solutions were spin-cast at 3000 rpm for 30 s and PbI2 was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The films were dried on a hot-plate at 100 °C for 2 min in an air atmosphere. For devices with a CSPL, the previous two step method was performed twice. On top of the perovskite layer, a 25 mg mL−1 solution of PC61BM in 1:1 mixture of chlorobenzene and chloroform was spin-cast at 1500 rpm. Subsequently, an Al electrode with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited on the PC61BM layer under vacuum (<10−6 torr) by thermal evaporation.


n–i–p structure. 
10 mm-patterned FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) was washed with 10% Deconex solution and cleaned with deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each in an ultrasonic bath, before being exposed to a UVO cleaner for 15 min. An electron transfer layer (ETL) of TiO2 was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrates using air spray pyrolysis. 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in an ethanol solution was coated on the FTO glass at 450 °C for 10 min and sintered at 450 °C for 1 h and slowly cooled to ambient temperature. This procedure gives a blocking layer of anatase TiO2 with a thickness of around 50–60 nm. Prior to perovskite deposition, the substrates were exposed to a UVO cleaner for 15 min. The perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by mixing FAI (1.2 M), PbI2 (1.32 M), MABr (0.18 M) and PbBr2 (0.18 M) in anhydrous DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (v/v). For devices without a CSPL, the perovskite precursor solution was spin coated using a two-step method at 2000 rpm for 5 s, followed by 6000 rpm for 20 s. During the second step, 1 M toluene was poured onto the spinning substrate slowly prior to the end of the procedure. The substrates were then annealed at 400 °C for 4 s. For devices with a CSPL, the previous two step method was performed twice. After perovskite film annealing, the substrates were cooled down for 10 minutes and a hole transfer layer was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 10 s. A Spiro-OMeTAD (EM index) in chlorobenzene (70 mM) was mixed with 7.5 μL of a 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) additive and 7.5 μL of a Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (170 mg/1 mL acetonitrile) before adding sufficient tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Dyesol). Finally, an Au counter electrode (70 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum.


Device characterization. 
Scanning electron microscope measurements (SEM) were performed using an S-4800 Hitachi High-Technology microscope. SEM samples were prepared by coating perovskite precursor solutions onto glass substrates by spin-coating. For X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, perovskite films were coated on PTAA-coated glass substrates and diffractograms were collected using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer at a scan rate of 2.4° min−1. UV-vis absorption was measured using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. AFM images were obtained using a Veeco Multimode AFM microscope in a tapping mode. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2635A Source Measure Unit. Solar cell performance was carried out under illumination by an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Apertures (13.0 mm2) made of thin metal were attached to each cell before measurement for J–V characteristics. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were obtained with a PV measurements QE system under ambient conditions, with monochromated light from a xenon arc lamp. The monochromatic light intensity was calibrated with a Si photodiode and chopped at 100 Hz.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Introduction of the compact seed perovskite layer
To examine the influence of a seed layer on crystallization of perovskite film growth, cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of whole perovskite layers were collected. Fig S1† and 1 show energy band diagrams of PeSCs and the photoactive perovskite film cross-sectional SEM images respectively without a seed layer (Fig. 1b), with a PbI2 seed layer (Fig. 1c) and with a CSPL (Fig. 1d) which were deposited on the PTAA substrate by spin-coating. After that, the photoactive perovskite layer was coated on each layer once more and annealed for 2 min at 100 °C. The difference between the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 1b–d directly indicates the perovskite film quality with a seed layer which demonstrated a vertically well-grown high quality perovskite crystal film with highly dense, highly uniform crystallinity and large grain size compared to that without a seed layer and that with a PbI2 seed layer. Cross-sectional SEM images directly display the perovskite seed layer that can be a nucleation point to make a high quality perovskite film. The constructed homogeneous perovskite crystal film increases the optical and electrical properties which also leads to reduced charge recombination and increases charge carrier diffusion length.6,31

3.2 XPS analysis
To clarify the presence of the seed layer after washing with DMF perovskite solvent, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were taken, since the photoactive perovskite layer was also coated on a CSPL with the same dissolved solvent. On the PTAA (control) substrate, a PbI2 seed layer, and a MAPbBrxI3−x perovskite seed layer were deposited. All substrates were washed with DMF solvent. We carefully used XPS to measure certain peak positions – Pb4f, I3d, and Br3d – to see the presence of each atom after washing the first deposited films. The survey spectra of the XPS measurements of the PTAA control substrate, PbI2 seed layer and CSPL films are shown in Fig. S2.†Fig. 2a–i clearly show the certain peak positions: the Br3d peak around 66–70 eV, the Pb4f peak around 137–145 eV, and the I3d peak around 615–635 eV. The control PTAA substrate does not show any peaks at each position, but the PbI2 seed layer has strong Pb4f peaks at 137.9 eV and 142.7 eV and the I3d peaks are at 630.1 eV and 618.6 eV only.31,32 The MAPbBrxI3−x perovskite seed layer has all three Pb4f, I3d and, Br3d peak positions. The XPS data directly show that after washing with DMF solvent, a thin layer of MAPbBrxI3−x perovskite is still on the substrate, which can be a nucleation point to make perfect perovskite crystals.

3.3 Crystal structure characteristic
To see the reflective intensity of the seed layer, the packing characteristics were collected by 2D-Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (2D-GIWAXS). The photoactive perovskite layer (Fig. 3a), PbI2 seed layer (Fig. 3b) and perovskite seed layer (Fig. 3c) 2D-GIWAXS images and corresponding in-plane (Fig. 3d) and out-of-plane (Fig. 3e) line-cut profiles are displayed. From XPS measurements, the presence of the seed layer was confirmed even after washing with DMF solvent. From 2D-GIWAXS, crystal orientations in the perovskite or seed layer with intense strong and distinct diffraction rings were obtained at qz ≈ 1.02, 1.97 and 2.03 Å−1, corresponding to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes which indicates a textured perovskite crystal with an orthorhombic crystal structure (Fig. 3).33,34 The bright and strong peaks in the images suggest that the films possess good crystallization and large grain size, which obviously contributes to the improved performance of the PeSCs. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns of the perovskite seed layers have similar peak positions and shapes compared to the control perovskite film at (110), (220) and (310). These results support the conclusion that the thin seed perovskite layer perfectly constructs the perovskite crystal. The XPS and 2D-GIWAXS results are direct evidence that after washing the first perovskite layer (seed layer), a very strong crystal structure of perovskite was constructed to influence the formation of a good quality second main perovskite layer.

3.4 Charge recombination characterization
In order to develop a deeper understanding of the charge recombination characteristics of the devices, the incident-light-intensity-dependent JSC in Fig. 4a and VOC in Fig. 4b were measured under short-circuit conditions. Fig. 4a shows a log–log plot of JSC as a function of the light intensity. The power-law dependence of JSC on light intensity was fitted using the following equation. JSC ∝ Iα(1)where I is the intensity of incident light and α is an exponent constant for PeSC devices (generally 0.85–1). The α value was calculated to be 0.963 for devices without a seed layer, suggesting significant charge recombination under short-circuit conditions. These results can be interpreted as suggesting that interfacial engineering of a seed layer eliminated the energy barrier which leads to charge recombination at the interfaces between the perovskite layer and the charge transport layer. Fig. 4b shows a semilogarithmic plot of VOC as a function of the light intensity. The VOC of conventional p–n junction based models is as follows:35,36 (2)where, Egap is the band gap of the semiconductor; in this case, the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital of PTAA and the PCBM conduction band edge, q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, P is the dissociation probability of the bound electron–hole pairs, γ is the Langevin recombination constant, NC is effective density of states, and G is generation rate of bound electron–hole pairs.
 Fig. 4  Charge recombination and transport characteristics: light intensity dependence of (a) JSC and (b) VOC of the perovskite device, (c) impedance spectroscopy and (d) time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) of the perovskite film without and with a CSPL. 
If the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is involved, a stronger dependence of VOC on the light intensity with a slope greater than kT/q will be obtained. The semilogarithmic plots of VOC against light intensity give slopes of 1.324kT/q and 1.542kT/q. The VOC for the device without a seed layer decreases faster than that of the device with a seed layer as the light intensity is reduced, indicating that significant SRH recombination is involved under open-circuit conditions. Impedance spectroscopy was also performed to support the results of light intensity on electrical characteristics in a seed layer perovskite film. As Fig. 4c shows, both devices with and without a seed layer obtained a semicircle in the range of 100 Hz to 2 MHz. The smaller semicircle of the device with a seed layer indicates the reduction in the charge transfer resistance due to highly crystalline film.37 Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) luminescence decay of devices with and without a CSPL is described in Fig. 4d. We prepared samples with configurations of glass/perovskite and glass/CSPL:perovskite, where a thick perovskite film (thickness: 460 ± 20 nm) was used for optimum device performance. The average PL decay time (τavg) was obtained as 12.46 ns for glass/perovskite, and 27.74 ns for glass/CSPL:perovskite. Comparing the PL decay for devices with and without a CSPL, the lifetime of the film with a CSPL is about 2 times higher than that of the film without a CSPL, which directly ensures the formation of high quality film. The achievement of high performance photovoltaic devices can be attributed to the optically intrinsic longer PL lifetime because the generated carrier can be easily diffused to each layer and then collected at each electrode, as reported previously.6
3.5 Photovoltaic characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for p–i–n and n–i–p structured perovskite devices with or without a seed perovskite layer are summarized in Table 1, while the relevant data are plotted in Fig. 5. The p–i–n structured perovskite solar cells were prepared with the architecture ITO/PTAA/CSPL:MAPbBrxI3−x/PC61BM/Al. The thickness of the PC61BM was varied to not only cover the whole perovskite photoactive layer, so that the photogenerated carriers can be effectively transported by the PC61BM interfacial layer, but also to prevent direct contact between the perovskite layer and Al electrode. The p–i–n perovskite devices without a seed layer exhibited a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.47 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.09 V, fill factor (FF) of 75% and an overall PCE of 15.07%, while the p–i–n perovskite devices with a seed layer achieved excellent results, including a JSC of 21.21 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.16 V, FF of 78% and a PCE of 19.25% due to high density and vertical growth of bulk-like perovskite crystalline film. Notably, the VOC is remarkably increased by about 0.07 V which is one of the highest VOC values reported in p–i–n structured perovskite solar cells with pure crystal perovskite film. The increased VOC is majorly related to the leakage current in the device. As clearly shown by the reduced charge recombination from the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination and PL decay, the seed layer has a crucial impact on the formation of the high quality perovskite film to achieve the device performance improvement. In the forward scanning direction, in addition, the perovskite device achieved a PCE of 19.05% with a JSC of 20.67 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.16 V and a FF of 79%. The device has a negligible photocurrent hysteresis and a fixed high VOC value attributed to reducing the trap states at the grain boundaries as shown in Fig. 5a. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the perovskite devices with a seed layer shows a broad spectral response in the range of 300–780 nm with a peak of 91.8% at a wavelength of 430 nm, which is the highest EQE value in the blue region, and the calculated current density is 20.05 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. S3.† The integrated photocurrent from the EQE shows only a 3% mismatch with the obtained value from the J–V curve that implies good agreement and substantiates the observed JSC. Additionally, PEDOT:PSS was employed as a HTL, which is a well known material for p–i–n architectures, to determine the effect of seed perovskite layers on other interfaces. As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1,† the perovskite devices with a seed layer show good performance, including a JSC of 20.09 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.00 V, a FF of 79 % and a PCE of 16.25% compared to perovskite devices without a seed layer, which yield poor results including a JSC of 18.39 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.93 V, a FF of 75% and a PCE of only 12.81%, which directly shows that a CSPL structure has an effect on the various HTLs. To confirm the effect of a CSPL in n–i–p structured PeSCs, n–i–p structured PeSCs were fabricated following the architecture FTO/bl-TiO2/mesoporous TiO2:perovskite((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The device performance reached a PCE of 20.37% with a CSPL compared to the device without a CSPL, which had a PCE of 18.50%, as shown in Fig. 5b. To directly compare the seed layer effect on the solar cells, histograms were made to compare the PCE for p–i–n structured devices (Fig. 5c), n–i–p structured devices (Fig. 5d) and JSC, VOC, and FF for p–i–n structured devices (Fig. S5,†) and n–i–p structured devices (Fig. S6†) for 30 individual devices that were fabricated with and without a seed layer. The average PCE with a perovskite seed layer was not only higher in value but also showed a narrower distribution of values than the devices without a seed layer in both p–i–n and n–i–p structured devices. Especially, p–i–n structured devices with a perovskite seed layer exhibited a higher VOC value, from 1.1 to 1.2, with high reproducibility and maintained JSC and FF. With a simple device structure (ITO/HTL/perovskite/PCBM/Al), we achieved high average PCEs with a CSPL which are comparable to or higher than those of complexed p–i–n perovskite structures using multiple ETLs and HTLs, such as C60 and BCP, reported in the previous studies.30,38 We expect that our new CSPL device structure has potential and can be widely applied to the perovskites field. We tested the solar cell stability with and without a CSPL under air at about 40% humidity, as shown in Fig. S8.† For the device with a CSPL, 50% of the initial PCE was retained after 250 min, whereas in the device without a CSPL it rapidly decreased, and less than 10% of the initial PCE was retained after 250 min. This result indicates that the CSPL improves the stability of the devices due to the high quality perovskite crystalline structure.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we developed simple and effective way to fabricate high performance p–i–n planar heterojunction perovskite/PC61BM hybrid solar cells by controlling the seed perovskite layer with low-temperature solution processing techniques. A seed perovskite layer has an enormous influence on the vertical growth of perovskite crystal grains and the adhesion between the HTL and perovskite photoactive layer, leading to improved opto-electric properties of materials and overcoming the problem of having a lower open circuit voltage in inverted structure PeSCs. A PCE of 19.25% was achieved in the p–i–n structured PeSCs with a record open circuit voltage of 1.16 V and a PCE of 20.37% was achieved in the n–i–p structured devices with pure crystal perovskite film. The approach reported in this study constitutes a significant advance in the application of perovskite film formation, providing an easy way to prepare high performance perovskite active layers in both p–i–n and n–i–p architectured systems. Also, this low temperature processing for high performance can be applied in roll-to-roll produced modules, as well as for deposition on flexible substrates.
