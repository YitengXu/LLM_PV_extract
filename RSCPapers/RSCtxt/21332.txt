    , Accepted 2nd June 2023First published on 2nd June 2023AbstractMotivated by the need to design efficient photocatalysts based on earth-abundant metals and to elucidate essential structure–property relationships, this study deals with heteroleptic copper(I) complexes. A systematic series of four novel diimine–diphosphine copper(I) complexes of the type [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ with different electron donating and withdrawing substituents in the 4 and 7-positions of the phenanthroline moiety has been prepared and compared to those with substituents in the 5 and 6-positions. In addition, two crystal structures were obtained, including that of the important synthesis intermediate [Cu(MeCN)2(P^P)]+. Accompanying DFT calculations revealed the orbital energies and HOMO–LUMO gaps, which are strongly dependent on the substituents. Most strikingly, substitution at the 4 and 7-positions leads to better absorption properties of the resulting complexes than that at the 5 and 6-positions. Within the series, the bistrifluoromethyl groups (CF3)2 play a special role, e.g. the Cu(CF3)2 complex is the only one that can be reduced twice. Moreover, Cu(CF3)2 represents the strongest excited state oxidant, whose potential is shifted by 90 mV compared to the reference complex CuH lacking substituents. The production of reactive singlet oxygen (1O2), including the catalytic oxygenation of 2,5-diphenylfuran (DPF), and the photocatalytic reductive dehalogenation of aryl halides were then chosen to evaluate the activity of these complexes. In fact, all complexes are good sensitizers generating 1O2 with singlet oxygen quantum yields  of up to 54% and a DPF oxygenation efficiency that depends on the electron donation ability of the respective substituents. A screening of different substrates, including the challenging 2-chloropyridine, and catalysis parameters demonstrated that these copper(I) complexes are very potent photocatalysts for reductive dehalogenations. They enable high yields >90% and fast reactions with maximum turnover frequencies of 1180 h−1 (Ar–Br) and 2939 h−1 (Ar–I), exceeding previous benchmark complexes.
Introduction
Over the last few decades, great progress has been achieved in developing more sustainable technologies. For example, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)1–4 and light-emitting electro-chemical cells (LECs)5–7 have emerged to rival conventional approaches in the generation of light for illumination or in display technology. Also, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for the transformation of sunlight into electricity strongly progressed.8–11 Instead of generating electric power, light is increasingly used in photoredox catalysis to drive various chemical transformations.12–18
Thus, visible light has been used to drive several organic reactions with high efficiency,13,16,19–21 such as the challenging activation of carbon–halogen bonds, in which a number of aryl and alkyl halides are converted into reactive radicals under mild conditions.22,23 In addition to its use in organic synthesis, photocatalysis also plays an emerging role in the production of the so-called solar fuels, e.g. in the splitting of water to H2 or the activation of CO2.24–28
In such photocatalytic systems, coordination compounds based on transition metals are often utilized. However, as transition metals from the 2nd and 3rd row (e.g. Ru, Ir, Pt or Re) do not represent ideal candidates due to their low abundance in the Earth's crust, first row transition metals have gained increasing attention and already demonstrated their applicability.27,29–33 Among the first row, copper(I) complexes show some unique properties due to its closed shell d10 electron configuration and the great diversity in possible ligand design.17,31,34–39 In particular, heteroleptic diimine–diphosphine copper(I) complexes of the type [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ (Fig. 1) came into focus due to their long excited state lifetimes, beneficial excited state potentials and broad tunability.6,17,31,37,38,40
 Fig. 1  Selected examples47,49,50 of diimine ligands and the resulting heteroleptic copper(I) photosensitizers, studying the impact of the various electronic functions. In our previous work,48 the effect of substitution in the 5 and 6-positions of the phenanthroline was investigated, while this study deals with the 4 and 7-positions. 
Besides rather strong variations of the ligand scaffold, by fusing additional polyaromatic rings at different positions of the phenanthroline moiety, or by attaching an additional chromophore to create bichromophoric systems,41–46 the impact of comparably small changes with respect to electron donating47,48 or withdrawing units47–50 has only scarcely been studied. This, however, provides detailed insights into the structure–property relationships with presumably predictable effects on the photophysical properties and photocatalytic activity of the envisioned photosensitizer.
In that manner, Takeda et al. studied the influence of 4-nitrophenyl (NO2) and 4-cyanophenyl (CN) introduced at the 4 and 7-positions of 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 1).49 Aside from these derivatives, they also looked at several variations using 5-membered heteroaromatics. Their work revealed a decrease in emission lifetime and quantum yield for the investigated heteroleptic copper(I) photosensitizers (PSs), when electron withdrawing groups (such as NO2 and CN) were introduced.49 Takeda et al. more recently also reported heteroleptic copper(I) complexes bearing trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups. Although the emission lifetime and quantum yield were decreased for the CF3-derivative, a higher activity for the evolution of H2 and the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was found.50 A stronger oxidative power has been suggested as a possible reason.50 In these studies, however, no dedicated electron donating group was attached to the 4,7-diphenyl-2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline unit (herein: LH, cf.Fig. 1 R1 = H).
Park et al. studied the effect of electron poor and electron rich substituents at the 4-position of LH's phenyl substituents on the photophysical and photocatalytic properties of the resulting [Cu(LH)(xant)]PF6 complexes (with xant = xantphos).47 For this purpose, electron rich diphenylamino- and dimethylamino-functionalized derivatives were prepared besides the electron poor cyano substituted LH ligand (Fig. 1). As a result, the electron donating tertiary amine led to a much higher absorptivity and emission quantum yields, accompanied by extremely long excited state lifetimes in an aqueous tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent mixture (THF/H2O = 8:2 v/v).47 In contrast, the electron withdrawing CN group caused a decrease in the same parameters, as found also by Takeda et al.49 The improved photophysical properties then impressively increased the photocatalytic activity of these copper(I) PSs in the light-driven reduction of water to molecular H2.47
Motivated by this work, we have previously been interested in studying the effect of electron withdrawal or donation in the 5 and 6-positions of the phenanthroline scaffold (Fig. 1).48 Therefore, we prepared and studied heteroleptic copper(I) complexes with, for example, 4-methoxyphenyl (electron donating) and 4-trifluoromethylphenyl substituents (electron withdrawing, Fig. 1). The degree of electron withdrawal or donation of a functional group can be quantified by the Hammett constant σ, with positive values for electron withdrawing groups, e.g. σ = +0.54 for 4-CF3, and negative values for electron donating groups, e.g. σ = −0.27 for 4-OMe (ref. 51) (cf.Fig. 2). In our earlier study,48 a surprisingly different behavior as would be expected from the literature was observed: the most electron rich complex bearing 4-methoxyphenyl groups in the 5 and 6-positions was found to be the least absorbing with the lowest excited state lifetime and weakest emission quantum yield among all the derivatives chosen.47,49,50

To now clarify whether the very different behaviour is rooted in the variation of the position (i.e. 4 and 7- vs. 5 and 6-positions) or if the chosen functional groups possess a further uncovered physical parameter, we decided to apply the same functionalization approach, but in the 4 and 7-positions of the phenanthroline (Fig. 1 and 2). This should allow for a more valid discussion about the impact of the electronic effects in the 5 and 6-positions compared to those in the 4 and 7-positions.
As a result of the above considerations, a systematic series of four different ligands LX, whose structure is derived from LH, and their respective [Cu(L)(xant)]PF6 complexes were prepared. To cover a broad range, functionalization towards the 3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl (L(CF3)2), 4-trifluoromethyl (LCF3), 4-fluoromethyl (LF) and 4-methoxy (LOMe) derivatives (in order of declining electron withdrawing character (Fig. 2)) was chosen. Further, two solid state structures were obtained and compared to theoretically predicted structures from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The copper(I) PSs were then analysed based on a combination of electrochemistry and UV/vis, steady-state emission and time-resolved emission spectroscopy.
To study their capabilities as PSs, the catalytic efficiencies of the compounds in the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) were tested and compared. 1O2 is used, for example, in the photodynamic therapy of cancer and in synthetic chemistry as a strong oxidant.39,52–54 To demonstrate the applicability of the PSs in this context, the catalytic photooxygenation of 2,5-diphenylfuran (DPF) to cis-dibenzoyl ethylene (DBE)52,55–57 was chosen as a model reaction.
To evaluate their potential as photocatalysts, the catalytic dehalogenation of different aryl halides was also investigated.22,23 To underline the high potential of these complexes, attention was given to the especially demanding dehalogenation of aryl chlorides (Scheme 1).58–60 The dehalogenation is characterized by mild reaction conditions (blue LED light at room temperature) and short reaction times (some <1 h), which makes these heteroleptic copper(I) complexes new benchmark systems.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization
Ligand synthesis (L(CF3)2–LOMe): the diimine ligands were prepared via Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions from 4,7-dichloro-2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline utilizing XPhos-Pd-G2 as a catalyst. The required 4,7-dichloro-2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline and the reactive XPhos-Pd-G2 catalyst were synthesised following literature known procedures.61,62 Suzuki cross-coupling reactions were conducted in a biphasic THF/water mixture at reflux temperatures for 16 h (similar for all ligands). The applied optimised coupling conditions are derived from our previous study, where further details are discussed in detail.48 The coupling reactions then proceeded quantitatively for LCF3, LF and LOMe (98, 98 and 96%) and with a good yield for L(CF3)2 (71%).
Importantly, the electron-donating derivative LOMe (Fig. 2) has never been reported before. The other substituted phenanthroline ligands have been presented in the literature, but for different purposes. LCF3 was prepared in a comparable reaction with the classical Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst in 74% yield and employed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction using its copper(I) complex.50LF was applied as a ligand in nickel catalysed photocarboxylation reactions.63L(CF3)2 has been incorporated into polymer solar cells, but only as the sole ligand and not as a metal-containing coordination compound.64
Synthesis of the complexes (Cu(CF3)2–CuOMe): the respective copper(I) complexes were synthesised following a well-known one-pot two-step synthetic procedure.48,65,66 Under inert conditions (Ar atmosphere), xantphos was introduced first, forming the [Cu(MeCN)2(xant)]PF6 (MeCN = acetonitrile) intermediate (Int), followed by fast substitution of the remaining MeCN ligands by the diimine ligand (Fig. 2). Isolated yields ranged from 75 to 85%. The four novel complexes were subsequently fully characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry as well as 1H-, 13C-, 19F- and 31P-NMR spectroscopy (see sections S3 and S4 in the ESI†).
Single crystals of the CuOMe complex could be obtained by diffusion of n-heptane into a 1,2-dichloroethane solution. Moreover, for the synthesis intermediate [Cu(MeCN)2(xant)]PF6 (Fig. 3), single crystals of sufficient quality for X-ray crystallography could also be isolated for the first time, even though it has been known for a long time.40,67,68

Displacement ellipsoids are set at a probability level of 50%. Hydrogen atoms and solvent molecules are omitted for clarity. 
Molecular structure of the synthesis intermediate Int
As mentioned above, the solid state structure of the intermediate [Cu(MeCN)2(xant)]PF6 was determined (Fig. 3 and Table 1, Int), demonstrating that this complex is indeed formed as a stable compound. In this structure, the Cu–N bond lengths are significantly shortened compared to the diimine coordinated complex (Table 1), which is probably due to the sp hybridized nitrogen (compared to the sp2 nitrogen atoms in phenanthroline). The N–Cu–N bond angle is 93.68(8)°, which is much smaller than expected for a rather undisturbed tetrahedral geometry (i.e. 109.5°). Most importantly, the obtained solid state structure of [Cu(MeCN)2(xant)]PF6 underlines the existence of the synthetic intermediate40,67,68 and shows that the compound can be isolated.

Comparison between predicted and experimental structures of the studied complexes
To evaluate potential structural differences between the four copper(I) complexes, the molecular structures were calculated by DFT (B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP, CPCM, see the ESI† for details) and analysed, concerning relevant changes in their bond lengths, and bond and torsion angles. To ensure the validity of the predicted structures, they were compared with the solid state structure of CuOMe obtained by X-ray analysis (Fig. 3, Tables 1 and S5.1†).
In general, the experimental structure of CuOMe is well described by our calculations. The experimental Cu–N and Cu–P bond lengths, however, are somewhat shorter (2–4 pm) for CuOMe. In contrast, the C–C bond lengths and various angles between the phenanthroline moiety and the introduced methoxyphenyl substituent show no mentionable discrepancy (Table 1). The interplane angles P–P–N–N are slightly smaller in the calculations (around 4°) compared to those in the experiment. The torsion angles between the phenyl ring and the phenanthroline plane are well predicted with slight differences of around 5°, e.g. 60.10° experimentally vs. 55.8° on average between the five computed structures. It should also be noted that the experimental values were determined from the solid state, while the computed structures are simulated inside an implicit solvent model (CPCM in acetonitrile, cf. ESI†). Although the computed bond lengths are slightly overestimated, the discrepancies found between theory and experiment fall within a typical error value.69,70 Hence, with careful analysis, the computed structures have acceptable validity.
Trends in the DFT calculated structures
Regarding the computed series of our functionalized copper(I) complexes, a trend can be rationalized concerning the Cu–N and Cu–P bond lengths as well as the N–Cu–N and P–Cu–P bond angles, however, with one exception. Going from the most electron withdrawing (CF3)2 functional group to the most electron donating OMe group, both the Cu–N and Cu–P bond lengths steadily decrease with a maximum deviation of around 2 pm (Table 1). In consequence, a steady increase in the N–Cu–N and P–Cu–P bond angles and the P–P–N–N inter plane angle can be observed. This is due to the decreased donating ability of the electron deficient ligands. However, the CF3 functionalized CuCF3 complex does not fit into this trend concerning any of the described parameters. The computed bond lengths and angles in CuCF3 must be classified as exceptions from the trend as no conclusive reason could be identified (the exception was yet found to not be relevant for further discussion, vide infra). The trend observed for the other four complexes Cu(CF3)2, CuF, CuH and CuOMe suggests that distal functionalization indeed affects the geometrical properties of the coordination site in a steady and reasonable manner.
Changes in orbital energies and HOMO–LUMO gaps
To evaluate possible differences induced by the functional groups, the calculated structures were further analysed concerning their orbital energies (Fig. 4).51 Notably, comparison of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the complexes revealed that their energies all lie in a quite similar regime (ΔEmax ≈ 0.08 eV, see Fig. 4: the highest energies in the occupied orbital region, e.g. −5.6 to −5.5 eV). This small difference is reasonable, as the HOMOs in each complex are mainly characterized by a mixture of Cu-d orbitals and orbitals localized at the phosphorus atoms and the Cu–P bond (ESI† chapter S6). This is consistent with reports in the literature.31 It is plausible that these orbitals are only slightly affected by the change of the distal substituents at the phenanthroline. Nevertheless, the still small but steady increase in the HOMO energies, when going from Cu(CF3)2 to CuOMe, is in good agreement with the increase in bond lengths discussed above and also fits the Hammett constants σ of the functional groups (e.g. σ = +0.54 or σ = −0.27, see Table 2).

A further interesting result from the energy analysis is obtained with regard to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the orbital energetically just above the LUMO (termed as LUMO+1). The LUMO and LUMO+1 are both characterized by antibonding π* orbitals localized on the phenanthroline, which are significantly affected by the modification directly at the diimine (ΔEmax ≈ 0.3 eV, E = −2.3 to −2.0 eV for the LUMOs and E = −2.1 to −1.8 eV or the LUMOs+1). The LUMO+1 of CuOMe is illustrated in Fig. 5(right plot) as a representative example (all other orbital plots of the HOMO−5 to LUMO+5 of all complexes are presented in the ESI:† chapter S6). As a main result of the different effects, the HOMO–LUMO gaps strongly vary and depend on the electronic character of the substituents. In Cu(CF3)2, the gap amounts to 3.31 eV, while in CuOMe, the gap is 3.49 eV (ΔE = 0.18 eV, Table 2).
 Fig. 5  Orbital representation of the LUMO+2 of Cu(CF3)2 (left, E = −1.60 eV) localized on the phenyl substituent and the LUMO+1 of CuOMe (right, E = −1.84 eV) localized on phenanthroline. 
The probably most unexpected result appears when examining the orbitals just above the mentioned LUMO and LUMO+1: both the LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 of Cu(CF3)2 lie significantly lower than those of the other complexes, where the respective orbitals are all fairly similar in energy and all lie significantly higher (Fig. 4, e.g. −1.6 and −1.5 eV for Cu(CF3)2vs. −1.3 and −1.2 eV in CuCF3). In Cu(CF3)2, these orbitals are localized on the bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl substituents (see Fig. 5, left). In the complexes CuCF3–CuOMe, the substituent localized orbitals can be found at much higher energies (e.g. −0.8 to −0.5 eV in ESI† Fig. S6.12).
In conclusion, from theory, it can be deduced that the introduction of the (CF3)2 groups most likely causes the smallest HOMO–LUMO gap among the whole series. Furthermore, in Cu(CF3)2, the energies of the substituent π* orbitals are surprisingly low. Here, the (CF3)2 functional groups decrease the energies of the substituent π* orbitals, causing them to become the LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 instead of, for example, the LUMO+12 in the unfunctionalized CuH. Both effects introduced by the (CF3)2 group should consequently lead to a less negative reduction potential (LUMO energy) and a more red-shifted absorption (HOMO–LUMO gap) in the experiment (Table 2, vide infra), as discussed below.
Electrochemical studies
The novel complexes Cu(CF3)2, CuCF3, CuF and CuOMe were further analysed via cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile solution to elucidate their electrochemical behavior (ESI† Fig. S7.1–S4). Typical for this class of compounds and as expected from the literature-known CuH, all complexes possess one reversible reduction event, which is attributed to the reduction of the phenanthroline moiety (see Table 3).40,46,48,49,71 In accordance with theory and the work by Takeda et al.,49 as well as our previous study,48Cu(CF3)2 is reduced at the most positive potential (Ered1/2 = −1.85 V), while CuOMe is reduced at the most negative potential (Ered1/2 = −2.08 V). The Ered1/2 of CuOMe is comparable to that of its related complex from our prior study (Δ = 30 mV, Ered1/2 = −2.11 V), which bears the same methoxyphenyl substituents in the 5 and 6-positions instead of the 4 and 7-positions.48 In contrast, Cu(CF3)2 shows a greater difference compared to its related 5,6-substituted compound (Δ = 90 mV, Ered1/2 = −1.94 V).48 These findings already suggest that the substitution in the 4 and 7-positions induces a more pronounced electronic change on the phenanthroline moiety. This has also been reported for electron deficient phenanthroline-based RuII complexes.72,73 An electronic interaction was shown to be possible in both positions, but more significant in the 4 and 7-positions.72

Interestingly, among the novel series exclusively, Cu(CF3)2 owns a second reversible reduction at Ered1/2 = −2.22 V in the electrochemically accessible potential range of acetonitrile (Fig. 6). This is well in line with the discussion concerning the low-lying LUMO+2/+3 introduced by the (CF3)2 modification (vide supra, e.g.Fig. 4). Cu(CF3)2 is therefore the only compound in this study that is twice reducible in acetonitrile (details cf. Fig. S7.5†).
 Fig. 6  Cyclic voltammogram of Cu(CF3)2 displaying the two reduction events measured in inert acetonitrile (Ered1/2 = −1.94 and −2.22 V vs. Fc/Fc+). Among all the copper(I) complexes in the series, a second reduction is exclusively present in Cu(CF3)2. 
Further, as expected for these types of heteroleptic copper(I) complexes, they all show one irreversible oxidation, which is attributed to the literature-known oxidation of the Cu–P bond at around +0.9 V (ESI† Fig. S7.1–S4).46,48,49,71,74
UV/vis spectroscopy
The study of the absorption properties by UV/vis spectroscopy revealed a clear trend (see Fig. 7, Table 3): when moving from the most electron deficient Cu(CF3)2 complex to the most electron donating CuOMe, the attenuation coefficients of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band εMLCT steadily increase from 3.7 × 103 to 6.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1 (by a factor of 1.7). This observation is in contrast to our preceding study about substitution in the 5 and 6-positions, where electron withdrawing substituents seemed to increase the absorptivity.48 In our current work, CuOMe represents the most strongly absorbing derivative (6.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1), while its 5,6-relative has been found to be the weakest absorbing species (3.0 × 103 M−1 cm−1).48
 Fig. 7  UV/vis absorption spectra of the complexes Cu(CF3)2, CuCF3, CuF, CuH and CuOMe (red, orange, green, grey and blue) in acetonitrile showing their respective attenuation coefficients relative to the absorbed wavelength. Cu(CF3)2 has the most red-shifted absorption (λabs = 395 nm). In the visible region (i.e. λ > 400 nm), CuOMe yet absorbs the strongest. 
The novel complexes exhibit a better absorptivity in most cases (e.g. 3.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for the weakest absorbing 4,7-derivative vs. 4.0 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for the strongest 5,6-derivative). In addition, the most electron deficient Cu(CF3)2 complex absorbs at a slightly red-shifted wavelength compared to its 5,6-counterpart (395 vs. 390 nm). Earlier studies on RuII phenanthroline complexes also discussed the tendency for the 4 and 7-positions to have a greater effect on the absorptivity. However, these studies did not include electron donating substituents, and therefore could not confirm a decreasing absorptivity of electron rich groups in the 5 and 6-positions.72,73,75
In general, the MLCT absorption maxima of the novel complexes gradually blue-shift as they adopt a more electron donating character (Table 3). This is also consistent with the analysis of the orbital energies discussed above (Table 2).
The UV/vis spectroscopic results regarding the modification in the 4 and 7-positions can be summarized as follows: i) substitution generally induces a larger increase in absorptivity compared to that in the 5 and 6-positions, ii) stronger electron donation increases the attenuation coefficients, and iii) a more pronounced red-shift of the absorption maxima compared to substitution in the 5 and 6-positions.48 Thus, when considering the absorption properties alone, the 4 and 7-positions seem superior to the 5 and 6-positions for future substitution.
Steady-state and time-resolved emission properties
Further studies included the investigation of the emission properties of the complexes in two different polar solvents. These were a coordinating (acetonitrile) and a non-coordinating solvent (dichloromethane), respectively,76 which usually have a significant impact on the emission.77,78 When the results from the steady-state emission are combined with the emission lifetime measurements, the general trend already observed in the discussions above remains.
Going from the most electron withdrawing Cu(CF3)2 to the most electron donating CuOMe reveals a strong increase of all probed parameters of the emission process. In both solvents, the maxima of the broad 3MLCT emission in this series blue-shift by about 30–40 nm (Fig. 8), the emission quantum yields ϕem strongly increase by a factor of about 10 and the emission lifetimes steadily rise by a factor of about 15 (Table 3). These findings are in strong contrast to our previous study, where substitution in the 5 and 6-positions revealed the methoxy-substituted derivative as the compound with the lowest emission quantum yield ϕem (0.16%) and shortest emission lifetime τem (11 ns) in acetonitrile.48 In fact, attaching any of the substituents in the 5 and 6-positions caused a strong decline of ϕem compared to the unsubstituted parent compound [Cu(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(xant)]+.48 In the 4 and 7-positions, a decrease of ϕem is also found for the two electron deficient CF3 containing derivatives. The OMe functional group, however, drastically improves this parameter (factor ≈ 2.5).
 Fig. 8  Corrected emission spectra of Cu(CF3)2, CuCF3, CuF, CuH and CuOMe (red, orange, green, grey and blue, respectively) measured in inert acetonitrile excited at the respective absorption maxima λabs. The optical densities were adjusted to around 0.1 at λabs to ensure comparability of the emission intensities. 
It is again emphasised that in the present work, the most electron donating CuOMe has the most beneficial properties, e.g. high ϕem (2.1% and 64%) and strongly increased τem (0.63 μs and 21 μs) in acetonitrile and dichloromethane, respectively. The unsubstituted and well-studied benchmark complex CuH shows significantly lower values of these parameters (ϕem = 1.35 and 53%, τem = 0.31 μs and 14.9 μs in acetonitrile and dichloromethane, respectively). The most electron deficient Cu(CF3)2 possesses the smallest values (Table 3) (ϕem = 0.2 and 6%, τem = 0.04 μs and 1.5 μs in acetonitrile and dichloromethane, respectively). An additional transient absorption measurement did not reveal any significant discrepancy in the emission lifetime of Cu(CF3)2, proving that the longest-lived state is the emissive state (data not shown). Attaching electron deficient substituents in the 4 and 7-positions also strongly affects the emission wavelength (ca. 50 nm for (CF3)2vs. the unsubstituted parent complex). The effect is, however, much smaller for the 5 and 6-positions (ca. 1 nm for (CF3)2).48 In related Ru complexes, an analogue behaviour has been found for electron deficient groups when comparing both positions.72,73,75
Subsequently, the radiative (kr) and non-radiative (knr) rate constants were estimated (for details, see ESI† chapter S9) from τem and ϕem.79 The kr values of the complexes presented here are quite similar when comparing acetonitrile and dichloromethane. Further, the kr values decrease only slightly within the series (e.g. from 4.0 × 104 to 3.0 × 104 s−1 with increasing electron donating character). In contrast, knr decreases strongly within the series in both solvents (6.3 × 105 to 1.7 × 104 s−1 in dichloromethane, 2.5 × 107 to 1.6 × 106 s−1 in acetonitrile, ESI† Table S9.1). It can be concluded that the solvent and the choice of the functional group have little effect on kr, while knr is strongly influenced by the functional group. This is likely due to the decreased excited state energy in the electron deficient derivatives, where according to the energy gap law, non-radiative transitions are more likely to occur as a result of increased overlap of vibrational states (leading to faster internal conversion).77,79 For these reasons, CuOMe has the most favorable characteristics.
In general, the knr constants are much greater in acetonitrile compared to those in dichloromethane. For example, the knr of the electron rich CuOMe is about 100 times larger (1.6 × 106vs. 0.017 × 106 s−1). This is due to the literature known quenching of the excited state by coordinating acetonitrile molecules (exciplex quenching).80,81
Looking at the corresponding literature-known48 derivatives with the same substituents, but in the 5 and 6-positions, the knr values are in the same range compared to the 4,7-series (ESI† Table S9.1). This is not the case for the 5,6-substituted OMe derivative, which has not the lowest, but by far the highest knr (90.8 × 106 s−1). Interestingly, also, kr decreases significantly with increasing donating character, which is in contrast to their 4,7-substituted counterparts. Again, an exception is the OMe derivative, as its kr value is also the highest among all derivatives (5 and 6- and 4 and 7-positions, cf. ESI† Table S9.1).
Excited state reduction potentials 
To enable a more well-founded discussion on the catalytic performance and perspective applications of the copper(I) complexes, the corresponding exited state reduction potentials  were estimated from the experimental reduction potentials Ered1/2 and the zero–zero excitation energy E0,0 using the Rehm–Weller equation (see ESI† chapter S10 for details).82 Although the exact determination of the excited state potentials is challenging, a comparison among the derivatives is nevertheless useful, especially since the maximum difference between the compounds can be up to 100 mV, which is of great importance for the discussion (methodological details are given in chapter S10 in the ESI†).
In general, the  values of the heteroleptic complexes (Table 3) are significantly higher in comparison to those of typical homoleptic copper(I) complexes, which are known to be rather poor photo-oxidants ( typically below 0 V vs. Fc/Fc+).23,34,83,84
Interestingly, Cu(CF3)2 reveals the highest  (0.58 V for Cu(CF3)2vs. 0.48 V for CuOMe) within this series. Therefore, besides lacking a comparably long-lived excited state and a high quantum yield, Cu(CF3)2 represents the strongest excited state oxidant among the copper(I) complexes presented herein. Compared to that of the well-known CuH ( = 0.49 V), the excited state reduction potential is increased by 90 mV. Cu(CF3)2 can therefore be highlighted as an interesting candidate for further catalytic studies – as long as efficient quenching processes are possible.
Catalytic oxygenation with singlet oxygen
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is the energetically rich form of molecular oxygen and can be applied in the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer but also is often used in organic chemistry as an effective and selective oxidizing agent.52–54 Typically, 1O2 is generated via energy transfer from the excited state of a photosensitizer to triplet oxygen (3O2). 1O2 has a characteristic emission peak (phosphorescence) in the near-infrared region at around 1270 nm, corresponding to an energy difference of 94.3 kJ mol−1 between 1O2 and 3O2.52,53 Hence, the catalytic generation of 1O2 can be accessed by measuring the NIR emission of 1O2 in reference to phenalenone as a universal standard.85–89 From previous studies on related copper compounds, it is known that the singlet oxygen quantum yield  in acetonitrile is usually comparatively low,45,46 which is also the case here. The  values were therefore determined in dichloromethane instead (see Table 3). As expected, the  increases with increasing electron donation (e.g. from 37% in Cu(CF3)2 to 54% in CuOMe). Although the emission quantum yield and the emission lifetime of Cu(CF3)2 are clearly decreased compared to those of CuOMe, the  of Cu(CF3)2 is still relatively high (i.e. 70% of that of CuOMe). Note that the absence of any sacrificial electron donor and the control absorption spectra of CuOMe and Cu(CF3)2 before and after singlet oxygen generation (ESI† Fig. S11.20) show that the formation of reduced forms of oxygen such as superoxide (O2˙−) is unlikely. The fact that the  of Cu(CF3)2 is comparably high may already indicate that its activity should not be underestimated based on its low ϕem and τem.
In order to evaluate their applicability, the catalytic oxygenation of 2,5-diphenylfuran (DPF) to cis-dibenzoylethylene (DBE) was chosen as a model reaction (see Fig. 9).52,55–57 Importantly, neither DPF nor DBE absorbs above 380 nm, precluding competitive light absorption with the PS when using visible light exclusively (for details on the catalytic setup, please see ESI† chapter S11 and Fig. S11.18). The reactions of the respective CuPS with DPF were continuously followed by in situ UV-vis spectroscopy. The consumption of DPF and formation of DBE were analysed via their characteristic bands at 324 nm (decreasing DPF) and 255 nm (increasing DBE) over a period of at least 90 min (e.g.Fig. 9 and ESI† chapter S11). The overall yields were calculated using the attenuation coefficient of DBE (ε = 18.1 × 103 M−1 cm−1).90,91 Additional experiments confirmed the stability of the photosensitizers and DPF under the chosen conditions (ESI† Fig. S11.14–S16), and the necessity for light and the PSs themselves to achieve conversion (ESI† Fig. S11.17).
 Fig. 9  Top: Spectra evolution of the reaction of 2,5-diphenylfuran (DPF, c = 2 × 10−5 M) to cis-dibenzoylethylene (DBE) sensitized by CuOMe (DPF:CuOMe = 10:1) in aerated dichloromethane at room temperature followed until completion (for all other spectra, see ESI† chapter S11). Center: Difference spectra of the recorded spectra shown above (arrows indicate the direction and the selected wavelengths: 255 nm, blue, and 324 nm, red). Bottom: Kinetic traces of the two selected wavelengths 324 nm (absorption maximum DPF, red arrow center and red dots bottom) and 255 nm (absorption maximum DBE, blue arrow center and blue dots bottom). 
As a result, the formation of DBE correlates well with the respective singlet oxygen quantum yields  and increases steadily within the series (ESI† Table S11.2). After 90 min, 83% DBE was produced by CuOMe, while Cu(CF3)2 achieved 52%. CuOMe completed the reaction after around 2 hours (>99% DBE, Fig. 9).
More detailed kinetic analysis showed that the consumption of DPF follows first order kinetics during the first 15 minutes and is similar for all complexes (within 10% error, ESI† Table S11.3). Therefore, the early kinetics do not significantly depend on the chosen CuPS, likely due to the high concentration of 3O2.103 The formation of DBE starts with a delay of about 5–10 minutes and then increases sharply, while an assumed first order kinetics does not seem to be valid. This is reasonable due to the literature known formation of an intermediate, from which DBE forms subsequently.55,92 Nevertheless, applying the rate law yields two rate constants which are within the error largest for CuOMe and smallest for Cu(CF3)2. This confirms that the most electron rich derivative induces the fastest formation of the desired product under the chosen conditions. In fact, the singlet oxygen quantum yields directly correlate with the product formation. This means that when comparing the rate constants of DBE formation, the same factor of 1.5 is found as when comparing the  of CuOMe and Cu(CF3)2.
Photoinduced reductive dehalogenation
To further explore the capability of this new series of complexes, their reactivity in the context of a basic organic transformation was examined. In this respect, the photocatalytic reductive dehalogenation of aryl halides represents a relevant benchmark reaction, which has been investigated in many past contributions.93–95 Briefly, the reaction involves the cleavage of the carbon–halogen bond by reducing aryl halides Ar–X into the radical Ar˙ and the halide X−, followed by protonation of Ar˙ leading to Ar–H (see Scheme 1). In the case of copper(I) complexes, such strong reductive power is achieved when the excited state of the latter is reductively quenched by a sacrificial donor, affording the reduced copper(I) complex in its ground state. As shown in Table 3, all complexes indeed feature a significantly negative reduction potential (between −1.85 and −2.08 V vs. Fc+/Fc couple).
Our first goal was to determine and to compare the photocatalytic activity of all complexes under the same conditions. For this purpose, 2-bromoacetanilide 1-Br was selected as the Ar–X substrate and BI1H as the sacrificial donor (BI1H = 5-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole, Scheme 1). BI1H was chosen because it has a substantially lower oxidation potential compared to the more traditional triethylamine (ca. 0.35 V and 0.7 V vs. SCE, respectively) and is therefore expected to increase the driving force of the reductive quenching step.96–98 All reactants, namely 1-Br, BI1H and the copper(I) complex (1 mol%) were dissolved in acetonitrile and degassed, before the mixture was irradiated with light (blue LED, 450 nm) for a maximum of 3 hours under vigorous stirring (Fig. S12.1†).
All results are summarized in Table 4, while the time evolution of the conversion can be found in Fig. S12.2.†

An initial catalyst loading of 5 mol% was used, resulting in a spectacularly efficient and fast conversion (89% yield within only 1 hour) of 1-Br to 1-H (Table 4, entry 4). This encouraged us to significantly decrease the loading to 1 mol%. Under these conditions, all complexes proved to be excellent photocatalysts, converting 1-Br into 1-H very efficiently (conversions of at least 97% and yields between 87 and 92%) and still very rapidly as the reactions are completed after 3 hours of irradiation (Table 4, entries 5–9). For comparison, 24 hours are required for similar previously published reactions.16,93 Blank experiments confirmed the necessity to gather all partners in order to observe any reaction and that the reaction is light-driven (Table 4, entries 1–3). Stern–Volmer experiments verified that the reaction proceeds through reductive quenching and not by oxidative quenching. This means that the emission lifetimes of the photo-excited complexes steadily decrease upon addition of BI1H, whereas they are unaffected by the presence of 1-Br (ESI† Fig. S12.3 and S12.4).
The photocatalytic results do not allow a clear comparison between the differently substituted copper(I) complexes, because they all work so well. Nevertheless, when focusing on the first minutes of catalysis, slight differences can be found (Fig. S12.5†). The fastest dehalogenation reaction is observed when Cu(CF3)2 is used as a photocatalyst, closely followed by CuH, and more sluggish reactions are obtained with CuF, CuCF3 and CuOMe.
The absorbances of the solutions in the irradiation zone (ca. 460 nm, Fig. S12.6†) are weak for all complexes and unlikely to account for the observed differences, especially given the spectral width of the LED beam.
From the thermodynamic point of view, [Cu(CF3)2]− and [CuOMe]− are respectively the least and the most reductive complexes of the series, and yet photocatalysis with Cu(CF3)2 and with CuOMe is respectively the fastest and the most sluggish. This demonstrates that the reduction of 1-Br (Ered = −2.65 V vs. Fc+/Fc, Fig. S12.7† and comments) is probably not the kinetically rate-determining step. The reductive quenching step would therefore be kinetically rate-determining, namely when the photo-excited complex reacts with the sacrificial donor BI1H.
This is consistent with the reductive quenching constant kRQ obtained for the quenching of excited  by BI1H (Stern–Volmer plots, kRQ = 7.6 × 109 M−1 s−1), which is the highest among the series. This is however counter-balanced by the short excited state lifetime of , leading to the smallest KSV value of the series (Table S12.1†). Besides, CuOMe* exhibits the highest KSV, and the second best kRQ, and yet the dehalogenation reaction photocatalysed by CuOMe is among the most sluggish ones.
This highlights the fact that the electron transfer from the excited copper(I) complexes to BI1H may occur with different efficiencies, but that does not affect the overall kinetics of the dehalogenation reaction. Incidentally, those considerations once more underline that the excited state reactivity of copper complexes is notoriously difficult to anticipate.99
This result can tentatively be rationalized by considering that the initial photo-induced electron transfer occurs within a cage [complex-BI1H].100–102 After photo-induced electron transfer, back charge recombination can occur very efficiently within the cage, if the reduced complex and BI1H+ do not diffuse away from each other fast enough. This is described as cage escape yield, and sensitizers with a mixed singlet and triplet excited state character are known to have lower cage escape yields.100 Thus, the discrepancies observed here could be due to a better cage escape yield for Cu(CF3)2 and CuH compared to CuOMe, CuF and CuCF3. Nevertheless, the four new complexes are all excellent photocatalysts in the framework of a dehalogenation reaction. Incidentally, our results demonstrate that even though Cu(CF3)2 is endowed with a short excited state lifetime (40 ns, the shortest lifetime of the series), this does not prevent it from outperforming the other photocatalysts, including the benchmark CuH.103
We next explored the scope of this reaction with other substrates (Scheme 1 and Table 5). For this purpose, we focused on the most reductive complex CuOMe, because only the strongest reductants can react with challenging substrates, such as aryl chlorides. As can be seen in Table 5, all iodinated and brominated molecules were reduced, regardless of the nature of the substrate. The efficiency of the reaction is particularly striking, with maximum turnover frequencies (TOFs) of about 2900 and 1200 for aryl iodides and aryl bromides, respectively (Table 5, entries 4 and 5). In contrast, aryl chlorides are more difficult to reduce and more challenging substrates because the C–Cl bond is harder to activate (Table 5, entries 2 and 6).13,23 However, 2-chloromethylbenzoate, the less electron rich aryl chloride, was successfully dechlorinated in only 30 min, with a respectable turnover number (TON) and TOF of 95 and 190 h−1, respectively. This is a very encouraging result for future prospects in the functionalization and late stage modification of aryl chlorides.

The fluorinated substrate 2-fluorobenzoate was also subjected to catalysis, but remained unchanged even after 24 h. This marks an important limitation of the studied complexes, which describes the demand for continued efforts to tune their excited state properties.
Finally, we also aimed to demonstrate the possibility to scale up this reaction. Therefore, the benchmark dehalogenation reaction of 1-Br was performed using 1 mol% CuOMe with 1 mmol of substrate instead of 0.1 mmol. A very satisfying yield of 84% was obtained, although a longer reaction time was required (24 hours) leading to a TOF of 3.5 h−1. A further decrease of the catalyst loading to 0.1 mol% led to a respectable yield of 54% after 48 hours of irradiation, affording a TON of 540 and TOF of 11 h−1. This demonstrates the relevance of using copper(I) complexes as photocatalysts in modern photochemistry.
Conclusions
Copper(I)-based complexes can be successfully used as photosensitizers and photocatalysts, although the underlying structure–property relationships are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study examined the effect of different electron withdrawing and donating groups at the 4 and 7-positions of 1,10-phenanthroline in a new series of heteroleptic diimine–diphosphine copper(I) complexes. Apart from the electronic impact, also major differences from the 5 and 6-positions were uncovered on the basis of a previous study.48
Indeed, opposite trends were found concerning the absorption properties of the resulting complexes. While electron donating substituents in the 4 and 7-positions increase the absorptivity, the same substituents in the 5 and 6-positions cause a reduced absorptivity compared to the unsubstituted complex. Similar observations were made for the emission properties. Emission lifetimes and quantum yields increase steadily with rising electron donating character, as also described in the literature.47,49 Therefore, the CuOMe complex containing two methoxy substituents exhibits the highest values (e.g. τem = 630 ns and ϕem = 2.1% in MeCN) among this series. This is in strong contrast to the related complex with methoxy groups in the 5 and 6-positions, where the same functional group gave the least favorable properties (e.g. τem = 11 ns and ϕem = 0.16% in MeCN).48 Besides the methoxy groups, especially, bistrifluoromethyl substituents and the resulting Cu(CF3)2 complex provide some unique properties. Cu(CF3)2 is not only the strongest excited state oxidant ( = 0.58 V), but also the only complex that can be reduced twice. The accompanying DFT calculations indicated that Cu(CF3)2 has especially low-lying, unoccupied orbitals localized on the substituents.
Most importantly, these photoactive Cu(I) complexes succeeded in two different photocatalytic applications, i.e. in the generation of reactive singlet oxygen and the subsequent photooxygenation of DPF, as well as in the dehalogenation of aryl halides. All complexes efficiently sensitize triplet oxygen to singlet oxygen with a maximum singlet oxygen quantum yield  of 54% for the CuOMe derivative, which also causes the fastest conversion of DPF to DBE. This is consistent with the photophysical properties of CuOMe, as  increases steadily with increasing ϕem and τem.
A breakthrough for such copper(I) complexes was achieved in the reductive dehalogenation of various aryl halides, including the challenging 2-chloropyridine. It was demonstrated that the suitable redox potentials of these complexes in the ground and excited states enable efficient dehalogenation of different substrates. For instance, methyl 2-bromobenzoate and methyl 2-iodobenzoate are both converted to methyl benzoate in high yields of 98% and extremely fast, with a maximum turnover frequency of 1180 and 2939 h−1, respectively. Some preliminary experiments evidenced that the reaction can be scaled up and the catalyst loading reduced to only 0.1 mol%. This makes these heteroleptic copper(I) complexes a new benchmark for noble metal-free systems.
The striking differences between substitution at the 5 and 6- and the 4 and 7 positions as well as other photocatalytic applications, such as the light-driven reduction of CO2, are the subject of ongoing investigations in our laboratories.

 	Fig. 7  UV/vis absorption spectra of the complexes Cu(CF3)2, CuCF3, CuF, CuH and CuOMe (red, orange, green, grey and blue) in acetonitrile showing their respective attenuation coefficients relative to the absorbed wavelength. Cu(CF3)2 has the most red-shifted absorption (λabs = 395 nm). In the visible region (i.e. λ > 400 nm), CuOMe yet absorbs the strongest.	 

 	Fig. 8  Corrected emission spectra of Cu(CF3)2, CuCF3, CuF, CuH and CuOMe (red, orange, green, grey and blue, respectively) measured in inert acetonitrile excited at the respective absorption maxima λabs. The optical densities were adjusted to around 0.1 at λabs to ensure comparability of the emission intensities.	 

 	Fig. 9  Top: Spectra evolution of the reaction of 2,5-diphenylfuran (DPF, c = 2 × 10−5 M) to cis-dibenzoylethylene (DBE) sensitized by CuOMe (DPF:CuOMe = 10:1) in aerated dichloromethane at room temperature followed until completion (for all other spectra, see ESI† chapter S11). Center: Difference spectra of the recorded spectra shown above (arrows indicate the direction and the selected wavelengths: 255 nm, blue, and 324 nm, red). Bottom: Kinetic traces of the two selected wavelengths 324 nm (absorption maximum DPF, red arrow center and red dots bottom) and 255 nm (absorption maximum DBE, blue arrow center and blue dots bottom).
