    , Accepted 14th November 2017First published on 14th November 2017AbstractExcellent performance and multifunctional electrocatalysts are of great importance for the development of renewable energy. Here, a multifunctional carbon cloth supported cobalt phosphide (CoP@CC) electrocatalyst was synthesized via a simple electrochemical deposition followed by subsequent phosphorization. This self-standing CoP@CC presents superior HER performance in both acid and alkaline media and excellent OER activity in an alkaline environment. When applied as both anode and cathode catalyst to overall water splitting, CoP@CC only required a low cell voltage of 1.68 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2, making this catalyst a potential candidate in industrial application. Moreover, inspired by its satisfying ORR activity, CoP@CC was first used as the air-electrode in zinc–air batteries, which outputted an open-circuit potential of 0.6 V and a power density of ∼30 mW cm−2.
Introduction
Faced with the global energy crisis, researchers have devoted great efforts to investigate excellent systems for energy conversion and storage.1,2 Electrocatalysis is a convenient and environmentally friendly approach to develop renewable and sustainable energy.3–5 For example, the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an important reaction for hydrogen generation, while electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are the two indispensable reactions to rechargeable metal–air batteries.6,7
The progress of electrocatalysis, however, generally suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics due to the lack of superior non-Pt electrocatalysts. To combat this problem, great efforts have been made to exploit high-performance noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.8,9 Transition metal dichalcogenides and their corresponding composites have been widely investigated for HER.10,11 MoS2/CoSe2 obtained by the hydrothermal method, for instance, exhibits an excellent HER performance with a low onset potential of −11 mV and a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec−1, which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst.12 As for OER and ORR, most attention is now focused on transition metal oxides or doped carbon materials. The gelled FeCoW oxy-hydroxide shows the lowest overpotential of 191 mV reported at 10 mA cm−2 and robust stability for OER.13 Dong et al. synthesized Fe and N co-doped carbon frameworks derived from self-assembled Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices. This Fe–N–C electrocatalyst transcends commercial Pt/C and many previous doped carbon materials for ORR.14
Although an abundance of electrocatalysts with excellent performance has been found and designed for applications in the area of electrocatalysis, most of them just possess a single functional property, which can hardly satisfy the needs for the development of sustainable energy systems.15,16 Searching for electrocatalysts with multifunctional characters that can be applied to various fields, such as HER, OER and ORR, seems to be the trend for the future.17,18 Recently, transition metal phosphides have attracted intense attention because of their superior electrocatalytic performance and multifunctional properties.19,20
In this paper, a multifunctional electrocatalyst, carbon cloth supported cobalt phosphide (CoP@CC), was synthesized via a simple electrochemical deposition followed by a subsequent in situ thermal phosphorization. With the support of a carbon cloth, the CoP@CC can be used directly as electrodes. Compared with the hydrothermal method that usually costs several hours for growing CoP precursors on carbon cloth, electrochemical deposition is easy to operate within tens of minutes.
The as-synthesized CoP@CC shows superior HER performance in both acid and alkaline media with low overpotentials, small Tafel slopes and high stabilities. Meanwhile, it also exhibits an excellent OER activity in alkaline media. Inspired by its good electrocatalytic performances for both HER and OER in an alkaline environment, the integrated CoP@CC was directly used as the electrodes for overall water splitting. As expected, the CoP@CC shows a satisfactory activity for water splitting. Moreover, here we first applied this self-standing CoP@CC electrode as the air-electrode to zinc–air batteries and investigated its corresponding performance.
Experimental
Materials
CoCl2·6H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Commercial carbon cloth (CC) was bought from PHYCHEMi Co. Ltd. NaH2PO2·H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The commercial Pt/C catalysts were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. (platinum, nominally 20 wt% on carbon black) and the commercial RuO2 was supplied by Aladdin Industrial Co. Other corresponding materials were of analytical reagent grade and used without any further purification. Redistilled water was used during the whole experiment.
Synthesis of Co(OH)2@CC
Co(OH)2@CC was prepared via an electrochemical-deposition method in a three electrode cell, in which saturated calomel electrode (SCE), carbon rod and CC were used as the reference electrode, the counter electrode and the working electrode, respectively. Prior to electrochemical-deposition, a piece of CC (1 × 3 cm2) was rinsed by acetone, ethanol and redistilled water under ultrasonic treatment each for 15 min, respectively. Afterwards, the piece of CC was hydrophilically treated by nitric acid and washed with redistilled water. Then the piece of CC was immersed in 25 mL CoCl2·6H2O (0.05 M) electrolyte acting as the working electrode with an immersed area of 1 × 2 cm2. Finally, Co(OH)2 grew on the CC through electrochemical deposition under a potential of −1.0 V vs. SCE for 20 min.
Synthesis of CoP@CC
CoP@CC was prepared by a thermal phosphorization. In brief, NaH2PO2·H2O (300 mg) was located at the upstream side of a tube furnace and a piece of CC grown with Co(OH)2 was placed at the downstream side. Then the whole samples were heated to 300 °C for 1 h at the rate of 5 °C min−1 with Ar gas flowing at a constant rate of 200 s.c.c.m. (cubic centimeters per minute at a standard temperature and pressure). The mass of CoP was determined to be ∼3 mg by comparing the weight of pure carbon cloth and the corresponding carbon cloth after phosphorization. For Pt/C@CC, 3 mg 20 wt% commercial Pt/C was dispersed in ethanol and loaded on the carbon cloth with the area of 1 × 2 cm2. RuO2@CC was prepared using the same method as for Pt/C@CC. Co3O4@CC was synthesized by directly annealing Co(OH)2 in air at 400 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of pure CoP powder
The CoP powder was synthesized via a simple method. In brief, firstly, Co(OH)2 was prepared by dropping 1 M NaOH into CoCl2·6H2O solution. Then the Co(OH)2 precipitate was washed with redistilled water several times and dried at 60 °C for further use. Finally, the CoP was obtained via subsequent phosphorization which is the same procedure as that of the synthesis of CoP@CC except that the molar ratio for Co:P is controlled to be at 1:10.
Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Philips X'pert PRO MPD diffractometer) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) was used to study the structure of the as-prepared samples. The morphology and element distribution of the samples were obtained by using a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Supra 55) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) with an acceleration voltage of 30 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements were carried out via the TEM (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN) under an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the chemical states of catalysts on a Kratos AXIS UltraDLD ultrahigh vacuum surface analysis system with Al Kα radiation (1486 eV) as a probe.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI 760 D electrochemical workstation with a conventional three-electrode glass cell. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE, in acidic media) or mercuric oxide electrode (in alkaline media) was used as the reference electrode and a carbon rod as the counter electrode. CoP@CC was directly used as the working electrode with a geometrical area of 1 × 2 cm2. For the control experiment, the electrocatalytic performance of pure CoP powder was also determined. In brief, 4 mg of pure CoP powder were dispersed in 1 mL of isopropanol–water (v:v = 1:5) mixed solution including 100 μL Nafion solution (0.5 wt%) and ultrasonically treated for at least 2 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Then, 5 μL of the homogeneous suspension was extracted and added onto a glassy carbon electrode (GC) with a diameter of 3 mm (∼0.258 mg cm−2).
All the electrochemical activities were studied at room temperature. The HER performance was tested in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes. The OER performance was tested in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Prior to measurements, the electrolytes were purged with Ar gas for 10 min to remove oxygen. The electrocatalytic performances of each catalyst were investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The stability of the catalysts was tested by chronopotentiometry. The ORR performance was evaluated on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH. Prior to the test, the electrolyte was bubbled with O2 for 30 min and O2 gas was maintained to flow over the electrolyte during the test. The zinc–air battery test was performed in 6 M KOH with CoP@CC and a piece of Zn foil (30 × 30 × 0.1 mm3) as two electrodes, respectively. To facilitate comparison, the onset potential in this study is measured at a current density of −1 mA cm−2 (for HER) or 1 mA cm−2 (for OER).21
Results and discussion
Structural characterization
Fig. S1† shows the fabrication of CoP@CC via electrochemical deposition with a subsequent in situ thermal phosphorization. The crystal structures of the products were studied by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1a, two broad peaks at around 26° and 43° belonging to the (002) and (101) planes of carbon are observed in both the curves. The black curve is the XRD pattern of the electrochemical deposition product, whose peaks at 2θ values of 10°, 20.1°, 38.3° and 58.9° can be assigned to the (001), (002), (102) and (110) crystal planes of Co(OH)2 (JCPDS card number 51-1731). After phosphorization the red curve was obtained with all the peaks of Co(OH)2 disappearing. The new peaks at around 31.6°, 36.3°, 46.2°, 48.1° and 56.4° are assigned to the (011), (111), (112), (211) and (212) crystal planes of CoP (JCPDS card number 29-0497), respectively. XRD analysis illustrates that Co(OH)2 is successfully converted to CoP after the phosphorization. The crystal structures of CoP powder and Co3O4@CC were also studied as shown in Fig. S2,† which are in good agreement with their corresponding standard cards, respectively.

Fig. 1b shows the SEM images of Co(OH)2. The Co(OH)2 nanosheets, a typical morphology for hydroxides, vertically grew on the carbon cloth via this simple electrochemical deposition. A close observation (inset in Fig. 1b) shows that these thin nanosheets are uniformly dispersed on the carbon cloth and interconnected with each other. After the phosphorization, the morphology of CoP is largely reserved with a large number of nanosheets growing perpendicular or slanting to the carbon cloth (Fig. 1c and inset in Fig. 1c). This structure can come into close contact with the electrolyte which may be beneficial for electrocatalytic performance. The morphology of CoP was further studied by TEM. Fig. 1d shows the TEM image of a single nanosheet of CoP desquamated from carbon cloth via ultrasound. A higher magnification view (Fig. 1e) elucidates that the CoP nanosheet is made up of numerous small nanocrystals. The more detailed crystal structure of CoP was further evaluated by HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 1f, the CoP nanosheet shows a good crystallinity with interplanar distances of 0.19 nm corresponding to the (210) plane. The SAED pattern (Fig. S3†) shows the polycrystalline structure of CoP. The element distribution of CoP@CC was illustrated by EDS mapping. Fig. 1g–j show the good distribution of C, Co, P and O elements, respectively.
The chemical component of CoP@CC was studied by the XPS measurements. Fig. S4† shows the survey spectra of Co(OH)2@CC and CoP@CC. For both XPS spectra, it is easy to distinguish the Co, O and C peaks and the peaks of P can only be seen in the XPS spectra of CoP@CC. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Co2p for Co(OH)2@CC and CoP@CC are shown in Fig. 1k. Two dominant peaks at 781.6 and 796.8 eV are observed for Co(OH)2@CC, which correspond to Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2, respectively. And the peaks of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 of CoP@CC are located at 782.3 and 797.5 eV, respectively. The Co2p binding energy of CoP shifts to a larger binding energy than that of the Co metal, implying that the Co in CoP carries a partially positive charge.22,23 Meanwhile, the shakeup satellite peaks (Sat.) of Co2p for both Co(OH)2@CC and CoP@CC are also observed, which is in accordance with the previous report.24 As for P2p of CoP@CC (Fig. 1l), the two peaks located at 129.2 and 130.0 eV correspond well to the P3−, while the dominant peak at 134.1 eV is attributed to PO43−.25
The HER activity
The electrocatalytic activities of CoP@CC were carefully investigated. Fig. 2a–c exhibit the HER performance of CoP@CC operated with a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell in acid media (0.5 M H2SO4), together with pure CC and Pt/C@CC for comparison. As expected, the carbon cloth displays a negligible HER activity, while Pt/C@CC undeniably exhibits state-of-the-art performance (Fig. 2a). Compared with Pt/C@CC, the as-synthesized CoP@CC represents a comparative HER performance with an onset potential of −44 mV at a current density of −1 mA cm−2 which is close to that of Pt/C@CC (−37 mV@−1 mA cm−2). Besides, it also requires a low overpotential of 131 mV to drive the current density of −10 mA cm−2, the significant value for driving solar fuel conversion. Such excellent HER performance of CoP@CC can rival most other non-Pt based HER catalysts.26–28

(a) LSV curves of pure CC, CoP@CC and Pt/C@CC in 0.5 M H2SO4; (b) Tafel plots derived from (a); (c) V–t curve of CoP@CC at −10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4; (d) LSV curves of pure CC, Co3O4@CC, Co(OH)2@CC, CoP@CC and Pt/C@CC in 1 M KOH; (e) Tafel plots derived from (d); (f) V–t curve of CoP@CC at −10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH. 
The Tafel slope is widely used to study the intrinsic properties of an electrocatalyst in HER. Fig. 2b displays the Tafel plots derived from Fig. 2a. Pt/C@CC shows a Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 which is similar to that of commercial Pt/C, illustrating a Volmer–Tafel mechanism. In this study, CoP@CC shows a low Tafel slope of 64 mV dec−1 suggesting a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. This low Tafel slope further verifies the high HER performance of CoP@CC. The electrochemical stability is also a key factor that appraises the HER performance of a catalyst. Fig. 2c shows the V–t curves of CoP@CC in acidic electrolytes. Even after long-term testing (100000 s) at the current density of −10 mA cm−2, the CoP@CC can retain a high efficiency with negligible changes.
A highly efficient HER performance in alkaline media is of importance because alkaline water electrolysis has been widely operated in industrial application recently. The HER performances of pure CC, Co3O4@CC, Co(OH)2@CC, CoP@CC and Pt/C@CC were also studied in 1 M KOH. As shown in Fig. 2d, Pt/C@CC still represents an excellent activity in alkaline media with an onset potential of −33 mV at the current density of −1 mA cm−2. Likewise, the as-prepared CoP@CC also demonstrates a superior HER activity in 1 M KOH which is almost the same as that in 0.5 M H2SO4. The onset potential of CoP@CC is as small as −86 mV@−1 mA cm−2, much lower than that of Co3O4@CC (−252 mV@−1 mA cm−2) and Co(OH)2@CC (−249 mV@−1 mA cm−2). The Tafel slope of CoP@CC is 70 mV dec−1 (Fig. 2e), just a little higher than that of 64 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Moreover, the CoP@CC also shows a robust stability in alkaline media. According to Fig. 2f, CoP@CC can work efficiently for 100000 s (>27 h) in alkaline media at the current density of −10 mA cm−2. To further identify the superior HER activity of CoP@CC, the HER activity of pure CoP powder was also studied (as shown in Fig. S5†). No matter whether in acidic or alkaline media, the HER performance of CoP@CC is better than that of the CoP powder. Based on the above investigations, it is concluded that the as-synthesized CoP@CC exhibits a superior HER activity in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Moreover, this self-standing electrode is easy to operate and thus may have great prospects in industrial hydrogen evolution.
The OER activity
The OER performance of CoP@CC was further investigated with a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell in 1 M KOH. Fig. 3a illustrates the LSV curves of pure CC, Co3O4@CC, Co(OH)2@CC, CoP@CC and RuO2@CC. Both the OER performances of Co3O4@CC and Co(OH)2@CC are barely satisfactory in alkaline media. CoP@CC exhibits an excellent OER activity, which is better than that of RuO2@CC. As shown in Fig. 3b, the onset potential of CoP@CC is as low as 1.35 V at 1 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that of RuO2@CC (1.56 V@1 mA cm−2). As the OER polarization curve of CoP/CC might possess high capacitive current density and lead to low onset potential, the curve was also recorded at a low scan rate of 1 mV s−1 for comparison, as shown in Fig. S6.† The onset potential of CoP@CC is then determined to be 1.41 V (@1 mA cm−2), also showing a small value.

(a) LSV curves of pure CC, Co3O4@CC, Co(OH)2@CC, CoP@CC and RuO2@CC in 1 M KOH; (b) the potentials of CoP@CC and RuO2@CC at the current density of 1 and 10 mA cm−2 for OER, respectively; (c) Tafel plots derived from (a); (d) V–t curve of CoP@CC at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH. 
Furthermore, a small overpotential (300 mV) is required for CoP@CC to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2. This superior OER activity of CoP@CC is comparable with the other reported transition metal selenide.29 The Tafel slope is also a parameter to evaluate catalysts. A low Tafel slope means that a small overpotential is needed to carry out a high current density. According to the Tafel plots (Fig. 3c), the Tafel slope of CoP@CC (124 mV dec−1) is much lower than that of RuO2@CC (150 mV dec−1) for OER, which further demonstrates the better OER performance of CoP@CC. Also, CoP@CC exhibits a superior stability for OER. As shown in Fig. 3d, it shows a negligible change after continuous operation at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 100000 s. It should be pointed out that there may be an oxide layer on the surface of CoP in the OER test.30 The excellent OER performance of CoP@CC may be due to the synergistic effect between CoP and the corresponding metal oxides on the surface of CoP.30–32 The OER performance of pure CoP was also tested as shown in Fig. S7.† The comparison of CoP@CC and CoP verifies the better OER activity of CoP@CC.
The activity of overall water splitting
Inspired by the good electrocatalytic performance of CoP@CC for both HER and OER in an alkaline environment (the inset in Fig. 4a), the CoP@CC self-standing electrodes were further used as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting in a single electrolyzer. Fig. 4a shows the LSV curves of CoP@CC for the overall water electrolysis in a two-electrode system. For comparison, the voltage difference (ΔV) between the two half reactions (HER and OER) was calculated according to the principle of charge conservation.33 Obviously, CoP@CC exhibits a good electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting with the current density of 10 mA cm−2 achieved at a cell voltage of as low as 1.68 V, and 20 mA cm−2 at 1.78 V, which are similar to those of the voltage difference (ΔV) (1.64 V@10 mA cm−2, 1.77 V@20 mA cm−2). Furthermore, the CoP@CC self-standing electrodes also exhibit a superior stability for overall water electrolysis. Even after the 100000 s test (Fig. 4b), it only shows a slight deactivation.

The activity of the zinc–air battery
It is worth noting that cobalt phosphide has also been reported to possess a remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance.20Fig. 5a shows the LSV curves of CoP and 20 wt% commercial Pt/C at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH. The CoP exhibits a good ORR activity with the onset potential of 0.80 V and half-wave potential of 0.67 V (as shown in Fig. 5b), which are close to that of 20 wt% commercial Pt/C. Encouraged by its ORR performance, a single zinc–air battery was constructed by using CoP@CC as the air electrode and a zinc foil as the anode in a electrochemical cell with the electrolyte of 6 M KOH. Fig. 5c depicts the LSV curve and the corresponding power density plot of this zinc–air battery. An open-circuit potential of 0.6 V is obtained by this simple equipment and the power density is as high as ∼30 mW cm−2. The galvanostatic discharge test was also performed to evaluate the stability of this zinc–air battery (Fig. 5d). It is obvious that no significant voltage drop was observed after a 10 h discharge process at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, illustrating its excellent long-term stability. Furthermore, more than ten LEDs were lit by these three tandem single zinc–air batteries (see the ESI Movie†).

The excellent electrocatalytic activity of CoP@CC is perhaps due to the following reasons: (1) the crisscrossing nanosheets make a closer contact with the electrolyte which enables the efficient utilization of activity sites; (2) the direct growth of CoP on carbon cloth without any binders guarantees its good electrical conductivity, ensuring the high charge transfer, namely the primary factor for electrocatalysis; and (3) the carbon cloth supporter avoids the aggregation of CoP nanosheets which provides sufficient activity sites.
Conclusions
In summary, a multifunctional carbon cloth supported CoP was prepared via a simple and fast electrochemical-deposition combined with subsequent phosphorization. This method could serve as a universal route to synthesize various transition metal phosphides supported on versatile conductive carriers. The prepared CoP@CC achieved an excellent electrocatalytic performance for both HER and OER, and thus could be used directly as the electrodes for overall water splitting in alkaline media. Besides, the CoP@CC self-standing electrode was first used as the air electrode in zinc–air batteries and exhibited good performance. Our investigation may provide a simple and universal strategy to fabricate multifunctional electrocatalysts, which may have potential applications in industry.
