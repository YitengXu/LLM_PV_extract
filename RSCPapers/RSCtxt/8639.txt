    , Accepted 20th June 2019First published on 20th June 2019AbstractA two-dimensional perovskite incorporating an amine moiety with a carboxyl group exhibited variations in orientation with changes in the ambient humidity. It was possible to increase the degree of vertical orientation by optimizing the film thickness and promoting crystallization at the interface between the film and the film-forming atmosphere.
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells were first reported by Miyasaka et al. in 2009, and have significant potential as next-generation devices.1 These compounds have many useful properties, but are ionic crystals and thus are unstable when exposed to moisture, oxygen and heat. As of 2019, these solar cells have demonstrated a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7%, and their performance has improved to a level that permits commercialization. Even so, the poor stability of the perovskites remains an issue. The three-dimensional perovskite compound having the formula CH3NH3PbI3 is especially susceptible to degradation by water and is decomposed into a precursor even at low levels of ambient atmospheric moisture.2–4 In contrast, the two-dimensional (2D) perovskite compound having the formula (C6H13NH3)2PbI4 is stable in the presence of moisture and resists decomposition for over a year.5 This improved moisture resistance is due to the introduction of the amine functionality. Significant research has been conducted to identify solar cell applications for quasi-2D perovskite compounds, which have dimensions intermediate between three and two, based on taking advantage of the high stability of 2D perovskite compounds.6–17 However, since the 2D perovskites possess an organic amine layer that acts as an insulator and the [PbX6]4− layers are connected two-dimensionally, the diffusion of photogenerated carriers is limited to two directions. In solar cells, the transport direction of carriers is perpendicular to the substrate. Therefore, because the [PbX6]4− layers of these 2D perovskites are readily oriented horizontal to the substrate, the migration of transport carriers in the vertical direction is difficult.18–24 As a result, the power generation performance of solar cell based on 2D perovskites is significantly reduced. Tsai et al. reported a PCE of 12.5% for a reverse structured quasi-2D perovskite cell fabricated via hot-cast spin-coating of a precursor solution on a heated substrate.19 This relatively high PCE was achieved by orienting the [PbX6]4− layers perpendicular to the substrate. It has been shown that such orientation control is important for improving the performance of solar cells using 2D perovskite compounds. Our own group has obtained [PbX6]4− layers that are vertically oriented using the quasi-2D perovskite (C6H13NH3)2FAPb2I7. As a result, we succeeded in producing a solar cell having a PCE of 1.73% that did not exhibit structural changes for one year.5 However, the reason why the orientation of the [PbX6]4− layers in such compounds can be changed by modifying the preparation conditions or materials has not yet been clarified.
Studies have shown that these 2D perovskite compounds tend to self-organize to form layered structures based on ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.6,25–35 If the balance of these interactions is changed, structural variations may occur, as has already been reported,17,36,37 and new properties will be produced. In the present study, an amine containing a carboxyl group was introduced into a 2D perovskite to assess the effects of hydrogen bonding of the amine on various properties, including orientation.
The hydroiodide HOOC(CH2)6NH3I was prepared by reacting equivalent amounts of the corresponding amine, HOOC(CH2)6NH2, and hydroiodic acid. A solution of the perovskite (7-AHAPbI) was subsequently prepared by reacting stoichiometric amounts of HOOC(CH2)6NH3I and PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Films were prepared on pre-heated glass substrates at 100 °C by spin-coating at 2000 rpm. For comparison purposes, [CH3(CH2)6NH3]2PbI4 (HeAPbI) spin-coated films were also fabricated by a similar procedure.

Fig. 1(a) shows out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns generated by spin-coated films of the 7-AHAPbI and HeAPbI. The d-spacing values calculated from the first diffractions of the (002) planes for 7-AHAPbI and HeAPbI were 18.4 and 18.7 Å, respectively, and the diffraction pattern and d-spacing value for the HeAPbI were in agreement with previously reported data.11,18,38,39 The results suggest the formation of an orthorhombic layered perovskite structure consisting of 2D sheets of [PbI6]4− octahedra and heptylammonium layers, as shown in Fig. S1(a).† As referring the data we and N. Mercier separately reported, the 2D structure of 7-AHAPbI was confirmed.36,40 The 7-AHAPbI was found to have an orthorhombic crystal structure in which hydrogen bonds were formed between the carboxyl groups of the amine and the carboxy group and the iodine of the [PbI6]4− moieties, based on a previous report (Fig. S1(b)†).41 AFM measurements showed that he crystal size of 7-AHAPbI is relatively large compared with HePbI, suggesting that crystallinity is affected by the carboxy functionalization (Fig. S2†).

The orientations of the 2D structures were investigated by grazing incident in-plane XRD, and Fig. 1(b) presents the in-plane XRD patterns generated by spin-coated films of 7-AHAPbI and HeAPbI. In these in-plane XRD patterns, the diffraction by the crystal planes in the direction perpendicular to the substrate can be observed by reducing the X-ray irradiation angle as much as possible, and the orientation can be evaluated by comparison with the out-of-plane XRD data. A diffraction peak associated with (200) planes was observed close to 14° in the patterns for both the 7-AHAPbI and HeAPbI thin films. The d-value calculated from these peaks was approximately 6.2 Å, suggesting that the [PbI6]4− layers were oriented parallel to the substrate. In the pattern produced by the 7-AHAPbI thin film, a clear (002) plane diffraction peak was also evident at 4.4°. The d-value calculated from this peak was 18.4 Å, indicating that there were crystals in which the [PbI6]4− layers were oriented perpendicular relative to the substrate, as has been previously observed and reported.39
Thin films were subsequently prepared under various conditions to elucidate the factors causing the vertical orientation and examine the effect of these factors on the orientation. One potential factor modifying the orientation of a 2D perovskite with carboxyl groups could be interactions between the perovskite and the film-forming atmosphere. There have been reports that crystal nucleation of a 2D perovskite can occur at the film surface in contact with the ambient air or at the film bottom in contact with the substrate.20 In the case that N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) is used as the solvent for the precursor solution, the [PbI6]4− layers of the 2D perovskite tend to orient perpendicular to the substrate. It was concluded that this vertical orientation is not substrate dependent, and that crystal nucleation occurs at the film surface in contact with the air. As described herein, if crystal nucleation occurs on the film surface and the orientation of the initially formed crystals controls the overall orientation, the change in orientation of the 7-AHAPbI can be attributed to interactions between the perovskite and the film-forming atmosphere. It was therefore considered that changing the ambient atmosphere could affect the orientation, and so this atmosphere was changed from air to nitrogen (working in a glove box) to investigate the effect. We also examined the effect of using DMAc as the solvent. The in-plane XRD patterns acquired from 7-AHAPbI films fabricated under either nitrogen or air using DMF are shown in Fig. S3,† while those obtained from films produced using DMAc are provided in Fig. S3.† In each pattern, a (002) peak indicating vertical orientation appears close to 4.7°. The ratios of the intensities of the (002) plane diffractions near 4.7° to the (200) plane diffractions near 14° are provided in Table S1.† When DMF was used as the solvent for the precursor solution, no significant difference in orientation was observed whether working in air or in a glove box filled with nitrogen. In contrast, when DMAc was used, the difference was remarkable. The nitrogen in the glove box was kept at a lower humidity than the humidity in the ambient air. In the case that DMAc was used, it is likely that more vertically oriented crystals were obtained based on the lower humidity of the film-forming atmosphere. Therefore, when DMAc is used, the ambient humidity is considered to affect the orientation. The contact angles of water on the 7-AHAPbI and HeAPbI films were determined to be 7.2° and 55.7°, respectively, showing that the hydrophilicity of the 2D perovskite was greatly increased by incorporating the carboxyl groups. This high degree of hydrophilicity is thought to have caused the orientation to change in accordance with the moisture content in the ambient atmosphere. That is, the amine is present on the outermost surface and tends to be horizontally oriented if the film forming atmosphere contains a large amount of water.
To evaluate other factors, the spin-coating conditions were changed and the orientations of the resulting films was examined by in-plane XRD (Fig. S5†). The film fabricated at a spin speed of 1000 rpm produced a (002) diffraction peak at 4.7° indicating vertical orientation of the crystals, while this peak was not observed in the pattern for a film fabricated at 5000 rpm. The ratios of the intensities of the (002) peak at 4.7° to those of the (200) peak near 14° are provided in Table S2.† In the case of the film fabricated at 1000 rpm, the ratio was large. Thus, more crystals with vertical orientations were obtained at a lower spin speed, in agreement with a previous report.42
To investigate the effect of the solution concentration, the concentration was changed from 40 wt% to 10 wt% and films were fabricated. The in-plane XRD results for a 7-AHAPbI film fabricated at a spin speed of 1000 rpm using a 10 wt% precursor solution are shown in Fig. S5.† In this case, a (002) plane diffraction derived from vertically oriented crystals was not observed. Comparing this pattern to that produced by the film fabricated from a 40 wt% solution (Fig. S6†), it is evident that more vertically oriented crystals can be obtained from a high-concentration precursor solution using the same film-forming atmosphere and spin-coating conditions. Thus, the ambient humidity is not the only factor determining the orientation. The film thickness is likely changed when varying the solution concentration, and this thickness should also affect the orientation. To assess this possibility, 7-AHAPbI thin films were fabricated using a casting method that allowed the film thickness to be varied, while assessing the orientation. The 7-AHAPbI films were fabricated by dropping 80, 60, 40, 30, 20 or 10 μL of a 40 wt% precursor solution on a substrate and leaving the sample at room temperature. The in-plane XRD results are shown in Fig. 2(a). Diffraction peaks were observed at 4.7° and 14° for all films. Table 1 shows the ratios of the intensities of the (002) peaks at 4.7° to the (200) peaks around 14°, while cross-sectional SEM images of some films are presented in Fig. 2(b). The thicknesses of the films made using 80, 30 and 10 μL were 30 to 28, 11 to 18 and 4 to 5 μm, respectively, demonstrating that the thickness could be controlled by varying the dropping amount. The highest intensity (002) peak was produced by the film with a dropping amount of 30 μL, and it was found that the [PbI6]4− layers were oriented most perpendicularly to the substrate at thicknesses in the range of 11 to 18 μm.

The relationship between the thickness of the film fabricated under various conditions and the degree of vertical orientation is plotted in Fig. 3. The film thickness data in this figure were obtained from cross-sectional SEM images, using average values if the thickness varied. The degree of vertical orientation was calculated by dividing the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak by the sum of the intensities of the (002) and (200) peaks. It is evident that the degree of vertical orientation increases as the film thickness increases, reaching a maximum value when the film thickness is about 15 μm. When the film thickness exceeds 15 μm, the degree of vertical orientation plateaus at approximately 30%. From the above, it appears that a film thickness on the order of 15 μm is required to orient the [PbI6]4− layers perpendicular to the substrate. Careful analysis of the cross-sectional SEM images shows that the crystals were stacked without being able to connect in the relatively thick film made using an 80 μL dropping amount. The greatest extent of crystal coupling was found in films with a thickness of approximately 16 μm and so, when the film thickness exceeded 15 μm, the degree of vertical orientation decreased because crystals could not connect. Therefore, the data suggest that there is an optimum film thickness that allows a high degree of vertical orientation, meaning that film thickness is one of the factors determining the orientation.
 Fig. 3  Relationship between film thickness and vertical orientation ratio for 7-AHAPbI films. 
The films described in the preceding paragraph were fabricated by a casting method that naturally promotes crystallization by standing at room temperature or by a spin-coating method in which crystallization occurs during spinning. As such, it is considered that crystal nuclei were formed at the interface between the solution and the film-forming atmosphere. Therefore, the ambient atmosphere greatly affected the orientation. However, if crystallization does not proceed from the interface between the solution and the atmosphere but rather from the substrate surface, the atmosphere may not affect the orientation. Therefore, in order to promote crystallization from the substrate surface, 30 μL of a 40 wt% 7-AHAPbI precursor solution was dropped onto a glass substrate and allowed to stand at 50 °C. Because 7-AHAPbI has no phase transition in these temperature range,40 the phase was not changed from r.t to 50 °C. The results of in-plane XRD analysis are shown in Fig. 4(a). The ratio of the intensities of the (002) and (200) diffraction peaks was 27:73. The film thickness was assessed based on cross-sectional SEM images and, although the thickness was in the range of 10 to 16 μm (equivalent to that of the film fabricated at room temperature), there was a significant difference in the degree of vertical orientation. In addition, the crystals of the film fabricated at 50 °C were not connected vertically to the substrate. From this result, it is clear that the temperature of the substrate also greatly affects the orientation. When the substrate is not heated, crystallization occurs on the film surface, and so the crystal orientation is affected by the humidity of the film-forming atmosphere. However, when the substrate is heated, crystallization occurs at the substrate surface such that the amount of water that can interact with the perovskite surface in the crystal growth should be decreased at higher temperature, and the crystal orientation is less susceptible to humidity. As a result, crystals with a partially parallel orientation with respect to the substrate are formed, and the degree of vertical orientation is reduced.

In summary, a 2D perovskite was partially vertically oriented as a result of introducing an amine moiety containing a carboxyl group. These carboxyl groups increased the hydrophilicity of the perovskite, and the orientation of films tended to become more vertical at lower ambient humidities. Producing an optimal film thickness and promoting crystallization from the film surface both increase the degree of vertical orientation. The present study elucidates the factors that determine the orientation of 2D perovskites, and is expected to allow further increases in the vertical orientation of 2D perovskites, and thus improve the PCE values for solar cells based on these materials.
