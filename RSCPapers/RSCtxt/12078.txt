    , Accepted 30th November 2016First published on 30th November 2016AbstractA ternary solvent system consisting of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) has been developed to improve the uniformity of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite domains. Compared to MAPbI3 perovskite films prepared using a binary solvent consisting of DMSO and GBL, the surface roughness and uniformity of MAPbI3 films fabricated by using the ternary solvent system are greatly improved. The thermogravimetric analysis reveals that a NMP–PbI2–MAI intermediate, a DMSO–PbI2–MAI intermediate and MAPbI3 crystals co-existed in the as-cast MAPbI3 films. Furthermore, it is found that the thermal stability of intermediate phases and the solvent evaporation rate are critical for the nucleation of the perovskite crystals during the thermal annealing treatment. The thermally stable intermediates prepared with the ternary solvent are converted to MAPbI3 films with a highly uniform and smooth surface. The film forms an intimate contact with the charge transporting layer when the layer is applied as a photoactive layer in the solar cell. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of ternary solvent processed solar cells is enhanced by 38.2% compared to that of the binary solvent processed one. Furthermore, the stability of the ternary processed perovskite solar cells is greatly improved, as well. This investigation provides a better understanding about the role of different processing solvents or additives in effecting the perovskite film quality.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PrSCs) based on a CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) photoactive layer have been of extensive interest for use as promising next generation solar cells. The MAPbI3 layer has several advantages such as a tunable band gap, high absorption coefficient across the visible spectrum, large electron diffusion length exceeding 1 μm, and easy fabrication on a large flexible substrate.1–5 Recently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the PrSCs have become comparable to those of silicon solar cells.6,7 An inverted type planar PrSC (ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulphonate) PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/metal electrode) has recently been studied owing to its distinct advantage of low temperature processing, and the non-hysteretic behavior of its photocurrent density–voltage curve compared to the conventional type PrSC based on an electron extraction layer consisting of a mesoporous titania scaffold annealed at 500 °C.8–11 It has been shown that the morphology of the MAPbI3 photoactive film is critical for the PCE of the planar perovskite solar cells.12–15 In addition, controlling and understanding the morphology and crystallization of the perovskite film is still a challenge due to its rapid crystallization. Thus, a wide variety of additives have been developed for incorporation in the perovskite solution such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), 1,8-diodooctane (DIO), 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN), hydroiodic acid (HI), and hydrochloric acid (HCl), to produce smooth and homogenous films with ideal perovskite nanocrystals, which improved the device performance significantly.16–20 However, most of the studies focused on the perovskite crystal growth rather than the surface effect on the performance of perovskite solar cells. The morphology of the MAPbI3 film is found to be influenced by solvent, annealing temperature, humidity, precursor composition and processing conditions (e.g. air or glove box).13,14,19,21,22 It has been reported that large crystals of perovskite enhance the charge transportation by minimizing the trap density in a film with few grain boundaries.23 Generally, increasing the grain size of MAPbI3 films is usually accompanied by roughening of the surface due to the voids between the crystal domains.24 While there are numerous studies on performance optimization by using large sizes of perovskite grains, there are very few studies on controlling the uniformity of the grain size and understanding the interfaces between the photoactive layer and the electrode.
In this study, we introduce a ternary solvent system for processing the perovskite solar cells by adding the NMP solvent to the binary solution to control the morphology of the resulting MAPbI3 films. The PCE significantly increased from 8.9% to 12.3% owing to the significant enhancement of photocurrent density. In particular, we found that the thermally stable intermediates were formed due to the strong interaction of NMP and PbI2–MAI, which enabled the uniform growth of the perovskite crystal during film formation. In addition, it was revealed that the device utilizing smaller MAPbI3 crystals with narrow size distribution exhibited a better performance compared with the device utilizing larger MAPbI3 crystals with a wide size distribution.
Experimental
Materials
Methylammonium iodide (MAI, CH3NH3I) was synthesized by reacting 27.86 mL of methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI) and 30 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 mL round bottom flask at 0 °C for 4 h with stirring. The precipitate was obtained by evaporation at 50 °C for 40 min. The product CH3NH3I was washed three times with diethyl ether. Finally, the resultant white powder was dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 60 °C. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. PEDDOT:PSS Clevios PVP AI 4083 was purchased from Heraeus, Germany.
Device fabrication and characterization

Perovskite film fabrication. 
The perovskite precursor solution for the ternary system was prepared by mixing 1.5 M PbI2 and 1.5 M MAI with 1 mL of solution consisting of GBL:DMSO:NMP with a solvent molar ratio of 2:2:1. For the binary system film, the precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI2 and MAI with the same molar ratio with 1 mL of solution consisting of GBL and DMSO, with a solvent molar ratio of 1:1. To prepare perovskite films, 200 μL of perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates at 1000 rpm and 7000 rpm for 10 s and 35 s respectively. During the spin-coating, 1 mL of anhydrous chlorobenzene was quickly dropped on the center of the substrates after 20 s. Afterwards, the spin-coated films were annealed on a hot plate for 1 h at 85 °C.


Solar cell fabrication. 
The planar perovskite photovoltaics were fabricated with the structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/lithium fluoride (LiF)/Al. Indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. After drying in the oven, the ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. The PEDDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated onto ITO at 5000 rpm (as a hole transport layer), followed by drying on a hotplate at 150 °C for 20 min in air. The substrates were then transferred to an Ar-filled glove box. The precursor solutions were filtered using 0.45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filters and spin-coated onto a PEDOT:PSS layer in two consecutive steps (1000 rpm, 10 s; 7000 rpm 60 s). After the formation of MAPbI3 films, 15 mg mL−1 PCBM dissolved in CB was spin-coated onto the MAPbI3 films at 1000 rpm for 1 min. The device fabrication was completed by the thermal evaporation of 0.5 nm LiF and a 100 nm aluminum electrode. Fifty devices under each conditions were fabricated and tested.

Measurements
The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the devices were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. An AM 1.5 G simulator was used (McScience K201 LAB50, Oriel) to simulate the solar spectrum. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured using a UV-2450 (SHIMADZU, Japan). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a JSM-6700F (JEOL, Japan). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the films were obtained using a LS 55 (Perkin Elmer, USA). AFM images were obtained by using a XE-70 (Park Systems Corp., Korea). The MAPbI3 film properties were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku D/Max 2200), using Ni-filtered Cu/Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) were measured with monochromatic light generated from a 300 W xenon lamp in the range 300–900 nm using a K3100 EQX (McScience, Korea). The thermogravimetric analysis was conducted using the TA Instruments Q500. The measurements were conducted from 25 °C and continually enhancing the temperature to 800 °C at a speed of 10 °C min−1 under the N2 atmosphere. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed using a Scimitar Series FTS800 (Varian, US).
Results and discussion
The device configuration of the planar perovskite solar cell adopted in this study and the energy level diagram of materials are shown in Fig. 1. The energy level of MAPbI3 was adapted from the literature.25 The effect of NMP solvent on the energy level of MAPbI3 will be discussed later. To clarify the effect of NMP on morphology control, we investigated the surface morphology of a MAPbI3 film, which was prepared on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates, by using SEM and AFM. The grain size distributions of the MAPbI3 film were calculated by using surface images obtained from SEM, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the SEM and AFM results (Fig. 2(a)–(d)), films prepared with the ternary solvent NMP:GBL:DMSO (pero-NMP) and those with the binary solvent GBL:DMSO (pero-control) showed full coverage on the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO/glass substrate. However, the crystal size of the pero-NMP film was more uniform than that of the pero-control film. As revealed by AFM, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the MAPbI3 film was decreased from ∼11 nm to ∼7 nm by incorporating NMP in the precursor solvent. The distribution curves of crystal sizes in the MAPbI3 films are shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f). A wide size range of crystals (from ∼100 nm to ∼400 nm) was observed in the pero-control samples. This indicates that the crystals were not homogenously grown in the pero-control films leading to a rough MAPbI3 film surface. However, about 70% of crystals in the pero-NMP film were grown homogenously with a similar crystal size of ∼200–250 nm. The average grain size of pero-control determined from the SEM image was 272 ± 111 nm and that of pero-NMP was determined to be 225 ± 65 nm. Based on these results, a facile charge collection at the interface between the perovskite layer and the PEDOT:PSS layer is expected from pero-NMP because of its compact and homogenous grains. Jeon et al. reported that DMSO chelates with MAI and PbI2 to form an intermediate DMSO–PbI2–MAI phase, which leads to a compact and uniform morphology after the thermal annealing treatment.13

TGA analyses were conducted to investigate the role of NMP in the kinetic processes of MAPbI3 formation. The measured weight loss as a function of temperature gives information on the changes in the composition, thermal stability and kinetic parameters for the chemical reaction in the sample. The TGA data for various solvents with and without MAPbI3 are shown in Fig. 3. And the weight ratio of each component is summarized in Table S1 of the ESI.† The evaporation (weight loss) rate of DMSO was faster than those of NMP and GBL due to the higher vapor pressure, and GBL and NMP showed similar evaporation rates due to similar vapor pressures (Fig. 3(a)). All the single, binary and ternary solvents without the precursor materials were continuously and completely evaporated at temperatures lower than 150 °C (Fig. 3(b)). The precursor solution prepared using a single solvent, DMSO or NMP, and all the precursor solutions prepared using the binary and the ternary solvents exhibited a discontinuous weight loss pattern (Fig. 3(c) and (d)). The discontinuous weight loss occurred in four steps except for the precursor solution prepared using the GBL solvent. Since the pure solvents evaporated completely below 150 °C, the first weight losses observed in Fig. 3(c) and (d) belong to the weight loss of the solvents. For the precursor solution PbI2–MAI dissolved in GBL, the first weight loss was 55% corresponding to the weight ratio of GBL (54.9%) in the solution (refer Table S1 of the ESI† for the weight ratios of each component in the solutions). This indicates that GBL completely evaporated at the first weight loss step without interaction with PbI2 or MAI. Therefore, it is thought that the role of GBL is dissolving the perovskite precursors and controlling the evaporation rate of MAPbI3. The precursor solution prepared with DMSO or NMP showed the first weight losses of 49% and 35%, respectively (Fig. 3(c)). This implies that 9% of DMSO and 13% of NMP remained after the first weight loss, respectively. After the second weight loss at temperatures from 150 °C to 225 °C, the values of weight losses for the corresponding solvents (56% for DMSO and 50.5% for NMP) became similar to the weight percent of solvents (54.2% for DMSO and 52.5% for NMP) in the precursor solutions. Based on the TGA results, it can be considered that DMSO and NMP interacted with MAI and PbI2 strongly and formed DMSO–PbI2–MAI or NMP–PbI2–MAI intermediates, and the solvent used for the intermediate formation escaped at temperatures from 150 °C to 225 °C. Comparing the temperature range of the second weight loss of the precursor solutions in Fig. 3(c), the NMP–PbI2–MAI intermediate has a stronger interaction between components compared to the DMSO–PbI2–MAI intermediate. Comparing the weight loss of the precursor solutions prepared by the ternary and binary solutions (Fig. 3(d)), the precursor solution with the ternary solvent exhibited 44.6% weight loss after the first weight loss which implies that 9.5% of solvents remained in the intermediate. The amount of solvent that remained in the intermediate prepared by the binary solvent was 7% which is smaller than that prepared by the ternary solvent. This reflects that the intermediate phase prepared by the ternary solvent shows better thermal stability and a slower evaporation rate compared to that prepared by the binary solvent system. 10% and 35% weight losses were observed during the third and fourth steps, respectively. These values agree with the weight ratio of MAI (10%) and PbI2 (35%) in the precursor solutions.26 After performing the TGA analysis on precursor solutions, we have found that the interaction between the precursor materials and the solvent is important in forming stable intermediates as well as the low vapor pressure of the solvent.

The FTIR measurements on the intermediate powders of DMSO–PbI2–MAI and NMP–PbI2–MAI support the TGA results (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The SO stretching vibration from DMSO shifted from 1056 cm−1 to 1018 cm−1 after forming the DMSO–PbI2–MAI powder, and the CO stretching vibration from NMP shifted from 1689 cm−1 to 1645 cm−1 as the NMP–PbI2–MAI powder formed. IR absorption peaks from both the DMSO–PbI2–MAI and NMP–PbI2–MAI intermediates were observed from the intermediate powder prepared by the ternary solvent. This indicates that the NMP–PbI2–MAI and DMSO–PbI2–MAI intermediates co-exist in the pristine MAPbI3 films.
The XRD results of as-cast and annealed pero-control and pero-NMP films are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b); both the as-cast pero-control and pero-NMP films showed peaks at 2θ = 6.3°, 6.9° and 8.9° that correspond to (002), (021), and (022), and the unidentified peaks marked as hashtags indicate that the DMSO–PbI2–MAI and NMP–PbI2–MAI intermediate phases existed in the as-cast films.27,28 In addition, strong (110) and (220) peaks from MAPbI3 also appeared for the as-cast films. These results imply that the perovskite and intermediate phases coexist in the as-cast MAPbI3 films. The XRD patterns of pero-control and pero-NMP after annealing showed 2θ peaks at 13.9°, 19.8°, 23.3°, 24.3°, 28.2°, 31.6°, 34.7°, 40.4° and 42.9° that correspond to (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (312) (310), (224) and (314) of the tetragonal perovskite crystal pattern.29,30 The extra diffraction peaks at 30.1° correspond to the XRD pattern of the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate.31

To study the effect of the thermally stable intermediate of NMP–PbI2–MAI on the morphology of the as-cast MAPbI3 films, the surface of the as-cast pero-control and pero-NMP films has been studied by using AFM (Fig. 5). The as-cast pero-control film showed a rough surface with a RMS value of 15.5 nm and inhomogeneous morphology with many pinholes. However, the as-cast pero-NMP film showed a smoother surface with a RMS value of 11.9 nm and a more homogenous and compact morphology. During thermal annealing, the intermediate phase adjoined to the perovskite phase in the films and gives rise to larger sized perovskite crystals as seen in Fig. 2(a) and (b).32 Compared to the pero-control film, there is no step textures in the MAPbI3 crystals prepared from pero-NMP. Therefore the slow conversion of the intermediate phases (the second step region of the TGA) plays an important role in the formation of uniform perovskite morphology. It is also revealed that the intermediate phase and the MAPbI3 phase coexist in the as-prepared film and that the reduced vapor pressure of the ternary solvent and the strong interaction between the ternary solvent and precursor materials reduced the growth rate of MAPbI3 in the pero-NMP film, which resulted in uniform MAPbI3 crystals. Fig. 6 is drawn based on the above understanding.

The perovskite film with less morphological defect at the surface will form an intimate contact with PCBM or PEDOT:PSS, which resulted in the reduction of the surface charge trap site at perovskite/PCBM or PEDOT:PSS and the enhancement of the charge collection efficiency of solar cells. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of pero-control and pero-NMP and the planar perovskite photovoltaic parameters are given in Fig. 7 and Table 1. The device without NMP displayed poor performance, with a short circuit current (Jsc) value of 13.3 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) value of 0.88 V, a fill factor (FF) of 76.1% and a PCE of 8.9%. The pero-NMP device showed a significant enhancement of 36% in the Jsc values and a slight improvement in the FF. The fact that the FF of pero-NMP is larger than the pero-control suggests that charge transportation in pero-NMP is more facile than that in pero-control, because it suffers less from imbalanced extraction or bimolecular recombination. We believe that the higher Jsc and FF are likely due to a more favorable pero-NMP surface morphology that has more compact perovskite grains and homogeneous crystals, leading to a smooth perovskite surface. Ito et al. reported that the Voc is strongly related to the grain size. They compared 100 nm, 300 nm, and 500 nm perovskite crystals, and found that the Voc gradually increases by reducing the trap density in the MAPbI3 films.33 However, in our study, when the MAPbI3 films had a similar grain size, there were no changes in the Voc. Based on these results, it is proposed that the traps not only exist among the MAPbI3 grains in the film, but also exist at the interface between the perovskite layer and electron/hole transport layers, as we have proved later. Hence, the 38.2% improvement in the PCE can be mainly assigned to the incorporation of NMP into the solvent and the controlled crystal growth rate.

The improved Jsc was mainly ascribed to the improved charge collection efficiency throughout the device. As shown in Fig. 8(a) and (c), the similar light absorption and reflective absorption spectra indicated that the light harvesting ability of pero-control films is comparable to the pero-NMP film across all wavelengths. This can be explained by the similarity in the thicknesses (400 nm and 406 nm) of MAPbI3 films used in the devices. The EQE and IQE of the two types of devices are shown in Fig. 8(b) and (d); it is well known that the EQE is defined as the externally measured ratio of the number of collected charges to the number of incident photons. ηEQE = ηAηIQE(1)where ηA represents the amount of incident light absorbed by the active layer and ηIQE is the ratio of the number of collected charges to the number of photons absorbed by the junctions, which usually represents how efficient charges are collected. The significantly improved EQE of pero-NMP is assigned to the dramatically increased IQE. Fig. 8(b) indicates that EQE integration over an AM 1.5G spectrum delivers the Jsc values consistent with the corresponding Jsc values calculated from J–V measurements. The significantly enhanced IQE of pero-NMP throughout the whole absorption spectra should be mainly due to the surface morphology of the perovskite crystal films resulting in a favorable perovskite crystal size and charge collection at the interface for the higher exciton harvesting efficiency in pero-NMP. Considering that the absorption edges of pero-control and pero-NMP were the same, the optical band gaps of those films would be the same. In addition, both pero-control and pero-NMP based solar cells exhibited the same Voc. Since the Voc is determined by the difference between the HOMO energy level of the perovskite film and the LUMO energy level of PCBM, the HOMO energy levels of both films would be the same. Consequently, the pero-control and the pero-NMP films would have the same HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Furthermore, the TGA results indicate that all the solvents were removed during the thermal annealing. Therefore, it is clear that the addition of NMP to the solvent did not influence the energy levels of the perovskite film.

Steady state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out as shown in Fig. 9. The PL quenching efficiency was principally attributed to the charge transfer properties from the photoactive layer to the interfaces; therefore, it could provide important information about the interface defects. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b), the high crystallinity of the pero-control film (as confirmed by SEM and XRD) benefited exciton generation in the MAPbI3 film. Therefore, the PL intensity of the pristine pero-control film without any transport layers is higher than that of the pero-NMP film.

(a and b) Pristine pero-control (solid black circle) and pero-NMP (solid red square) films prepared on glasses. (a) The pero-control (open black circle) and pero-NMP (open red square) films prepared on glass/PEDOT:PSS and (b) the PCBM deposited pero-control (open black circle) and pero-NMP (open red square) films prepared on glasses. 
To understand the charge transfer at the contact interface between the MAPbI3 film and the PEDOT:PSS or PCBM layer, PL measurements of pristine perovskite neat films, PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3, and MAPbI3/PCBM for the pero-control film and pero-NMP were carried out as shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b). The quenching efficiency is defined as18 (2)where PL0 and PLquench are the PL intensity of the pristine pero-film with and without any quencher, respectively. The PEDOT:PSS and PCBM layers act as the quenchers, respectively. η1 and η2, are the quenching efficiency of pero-control and pero-NMP with PEDOT:PSS, respectively. η3 and η4 stand for the quenching efficiency of pero-control and pero-NMP with PCBM. When PEDOT:PSS acted as the quencher, η1 and η2 for pero-control and pero-NMP were 68.9% and 86.7%, respectively. Furthermore, when PCBM was deposited onto the pero-films, η3 and η4 for pero-control and pero-NMP are 91.3% and 97.6%, respectively. The charge carriers within the film can be extracted more effectively by the transporting layers. Thus, we concluded that the pero-NMP film shows fewer surface defects not only at PEDOT:PSS layer but also at the interface of PCBM layer compared to the pero-control. The higher Jsc resulting from the pero-NMP devices is attributed to the dramatically reduced defects at the interface, leading to a significant enhancement of the charge collection efficiency at the interface. This is also indicated by the IQE results associated with the addition of NMP. Interestingly, the quenching behavior is more severe in the perovskite/PCBM interface than in the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite. More work is required to understand this behavior.
The rapid increase in device performance is encouraging but long term stability is a major barrier to commercialization. Thus, we monitored the long term stability of the devices to understand the effect of the interfacial defects on the perovskite solar cells. The stability under light soaking and thermal stress conditions was tested using encapsulated pero-control and pero-NMP devices. The light stability test was conducted under solar simulated light (AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2) by maintaining the temperature of the chamber at 25 °C. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the pero-NMP maintained 78.5% of its initial PCE after 50 h. However, the pero-control device maintained 28.7% of the initial PCE after 50 h. For thermal stability (Fig. 10(b)), the encapsulated devices were stored in the glove box for 50 h at 50 °C. The pero-NMP maintained 84.5% of the initial efficiency, whereas pero-control maintained 72.3% of the initial efficiency. Furthermore, the stability test under light soaking at 50 °C was conducted and the results are included in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† Although the performance of all the devices decayed faster under light soaking at elevated temperatures, the pero-NMP device was relatively more stable than the pero-control device.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully developed efficient perovskite solar cells with a ternary solvent system. We have investigated the role of the ternary solvent system in the nucleation of MAPbI3 crystals. The thermally stable intermediates of NMP–PbI2–MAI prepared by the ternary solvent were found to play a critical role in the nucleation of MAPbI3 crystals, suppressing the surface defects and effective charge extraction at the interface between MAPbI3 and transporting layers. Consequently, the device performance was significantly improved by 38.2%. This ternary solvent system provides the insight that the thermal behavior of the solvents and intermediates are crucial to the perovskite device performance.
