    , Accepted 25th November 2015First published on 25th November 2015AbstractConsecutive explorations on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as the central blocks of organic photosensitizers have very recently brought forth a new opportunity towards efficiency enhancement of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). In this paper, to scrutinize the effects of ancillary electron-donors on light absorption and charge recombination in phenanthrocarbazole (PC) dye-sensitized solar cells, we synthesized three dyes with the respective pristine PC, fluorenyl functionalized PC, and carbazyl functionalized PC electron-donors in conjunction with the 4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid electron-acceptor. With respect to the reference dye only using PC as the electron-donor, attaching an ancillary electron-donor, 2-hexyldecyl tethering fluorenyl or carbazyl, to the free end of PC can result in a destabilized highest occupied molecular orbital energy level and a red-shifted absorption peak as well as an enhanced maximum molar absorption coefficient. The end-capping of PC with fluorenyl or carbazyl can also slow down the kinetics of charge recombination of titania electrons with both cobalt(III) ions and photooxidized dye molecules, giving rise to an increased photovoltage and an improved power conversion efficiency. Moreover, time-resolved photophysical measurements disclose that these styles of reducing energy-gaps do not exert influence on the yields of electron and hole injections.
Introduction
Over the past 24 years, considerable research activities have been implemented on basic mechanisms, new materials, and device engineering of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs),1 which could accomplish the light-to-electricity conversion at an affordable cost. The economic efficiency of a DSC could be realized either by applying resource-abundant, less energy-intensive materials as well as simple manufacture technologies, or by upgrading device performance. Screening the literature of this field, one could easily find that DSCs with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were always made with organometallic compounds (e.g. ruthenium polypyridine2 and zinc porphyrin complexes3) as the light-absorbers, reaching the highest PCE of 13% (ref. 3e) under an irradiance of AM1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) in 2014. Meanwhile, the design and preparation of competent metal-free organic dyes could be a feasible tactic towards the challenge of economic efficiency of a DSC, on primary account of copious raw materials and enjoyable aesthetic effects.4 On this subject, improving the molar absorption coefficient and narrowing the energy gap of organic dye molecules to harvest solar photons in the infrared region are impetus of many related literature studies.5
However, the reduction of the HOMO/LUMO energy gap of a dye molecule is inevitably associated with either the negative shift of ground-state oxidation potential or the positive shift of excited-state oxidation potential, or even both of them. These energetic changes are very possible to be the key factors behind the lowered external quantum efficiencies by impacting the yield of generating long-lived charge carriers.6 Additionally, the free energy of output electrons is considerably controlled by the thickness and pinhole defect of self-organized dye layers, spatially standing at the boundary of electron-transporting titania and the hole-transporting redox electrolyte.7 Recently, Kakiage and his coworkers8–10 intelligently derived the seminal MK-2 dye to an alkoxysilane functionalized counterpart, allowing them to wonderfully fill defect-pinholes of dye layers with multiple coadsorbates to reduce interfacial charge recombination, and thereby achieved consecutive PCE records of 12.5%,8 12.8%,9 and 14.5% (ref. 10) for organic dye-sensitized solar cells.
In the field of organic optoelectronics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with natively high levels of π-conjugation and delocalization have been considered as a unique class of functional materials for field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics.11 In this context, N-annulated perylene (1H-phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole, PC) has been used as the electron-rich unit of dyes in DSCs.3f,12 At the beginning of 2015, we reported a structurally simple donor–acceptor (D–A) dye (C272 in Fig. 1), which achieved an impressive PCE of 10.4%.13 Succeeding explorations on this line by synthesizing more complicate PAH segments as the central blocks of anti-aggregation organic photosensitizers have upgraded the PCEs of coadsorbate-free organic dye-sensitized solar cells, being 13% at the moment.14
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of D–A dyes HW-2 and HW-3 characteristic of binary electron-donating segments F-PC (green) and C-PC (red), respectively. The reference dye HW-1 with a single electron-donating unit PC (blue) is used as reference for comparison. Structure of the first metal-free, PC-based organic dye (C272) attaining an over 10% PCE is also included. 
To have a better fundamental understanding on the design rule of PC based organic dyes, in this paper we prepare a very simple model dye HW-1 only using PC as the electron-donor in collaboration with electron-acceptor 4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (EBTBA). This dye will be used as the reference to scrutinize the necessity of attaching 2-hexyldecyl tethering fluorenyl or carbazyl at the free end of PC in HW-1 by joint electrochemical, photophysical, and photovoltaic characterizations in combination with theoretical calculations. Molecular structures of related dyes HW-2 and HW-3 are shown in Fig. 1.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 outlines the synthetic routes to the three metal-free organic dyes discussed in this work. We first implemented an alkylation reaction to the commercially available materials, 3-bromo-9H-fluorene (2) and 3-bromo-9H-carbazole (6), with 2-hexyldecyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonate15 as the alkylating reagent to afford 3-bromo-9,9-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-9H-fluorene (3) and 3-bromo-9-(2-hexyldecyl)-9H-carbazole (7), respectively. Next, compounds 3 and 7 underwent a bromine–lithium exchange with n-butyllithium at a cryogenic temperature and then transformed to their correspondent boronic acid pinacol esters 4 and 8. The Suzuki–Miyaura cross-couplings of 4 and 8 with 3-bromo-1-(2-hexyldecyl)-1H-phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole (1),16 by use of the highly active phosphine ligand 2-(2′,6′-dimethoxybiphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine (Sphos),17 produced the respective fluorenyl functionalized PC (5, F-PC) and a carbazyl functionalized PC (9, C-PC) in good yields. 5 and 9 were consecutively subjected to region-selective mono-bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) at a relatively low temperature, and cross-coupling with butyl 4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoate18via the Sonogashira reaction,19 to generate esterified dye precursors. At the end, the esters were hydrolyzed with KOH as the catalyst, and the hydrolyzates were completely acidified with a diluted phosphoric acid aqueous solution to afford HW-2 and HW-3. Also, the model dye HW-1 was prepared with compound 1 as the starting material according to a procedure similar to HW-2 and HW-3.

To scrutinize the probable influences of electron-donors F-PC and C-PC vs. PC upon energy levels and energy gaps of dye molecules, we first carried out electrochemical measurements of tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions of dye molecules in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. From the vertically aligned cyclic voltammograms (CVs) presented in Fig. 2a, we could estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (Table 1) using the equation of E = −4.88 − eEonset, herein Eonset represents the onset oxidation and reduction potentials of a dye molecule at the ground-state. It is found that compared to HW-1 using PC, the F-PC derived dye HW-2 and the C-PC dye HW-3 have 0.06 eV and 0.11 eV destabilized HOMO energy levels, due to the introduction of ancillary electron-donors.20 In addition, these three dyes own the same LUMO energy level of −3.29 eV vs. vacuum. On the whole, the fluorenyl and carbazyl attachments lead to diminished LUMO/HOMO energy gaps. It is thus apparently reasonable for us to detect red-shifts of maximum absorption wavelength (λMEASABS,MAX), 14 nm for HW-2 and 19 nm for HW-3 from Fig. 2b with HW-1 as the reference. Likewise, the end-capping of PC with fluorenyl and carbazyl also produces augmented maximum molar absorption coefficients (εMEASMAX) of 52.2 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for HW-2 and 47.8 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for HW-3, in contrast to that of 30.6 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for HW-1.

As illustrated in Fig. 2c and Table 1, our density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level can nicely reproduce the relative alignments of electronic energy levels of these three dyes. Further time-dependent DFT calculations have unlocked that the S0 → S1 vertical electronic transitions to LUMO for these three dyes stem mainly from HOMO, bearing a vivid intramolecular charge-transfer character which can be easily felt from contour plots of molecular orbitals displayed in Fig. 2d. Moreover, we included DFT results on electron-donors PC, F-PC, and C-PC as well as electron-acceptor EBTBA for a better understanding of the energetically genetic correlations of D–A dye molecules with their electron-releasing and electron-withdrawing segments. It is worthwhile to observe, as our previous work,13,18 from Fig. 2c that all three dyes are endowed with almost duplicate HOMO energy levels to their correlative electron-donors, and equivalent LUMO energy levels to electron-acceptor EBTBA. By comparing the HOMO and HOMO−1 contour plots of PC, F-PC, C-PC, HW-1, HW-2, and HW-3, one can explicitly perceive the ancillary electron-donating function of fluorenyl and carbazyl.
To check out the potential impact of attaching an auxiliary electron-releasing segment at one end of the kernel electron-donor PC on electron injection yield (ϕEI), we implemented time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements to inspect the diverseness in photoluminescence (PL) of dyed alumina and titania films. Recalling that these three organic dyes in the electronically excited-states (D*) cannot inject electrons to alumina, we attributed the time-resolved PL decays (blue curves) in Fig. 3 to radiative and radiationless deactivation of D* via intramolecular and intermolecular photophysical processes. Changing the oxide from alumina to titania yet leads to sizable PL quenching (PLQ), which can be easily discerned by looking at the correlative red and blue curves presented in three panels of Fig. 3. PLQ indicates that charge photogeneration should happen at the interface of dye and titania, which possesses a favorite energy-level offset. The areas under transient PL traces calculated via time integration of intensity signals were also merged into Fig. 3 as green curves for alumina samples and magenta for titania to roughly assess ϕEI, being 0.96–0.97 for HW-1, HW-2, and HW-3.
 Fig. 3  Time-correlated PL signals detected at 780 nm upon excitation with picosecond laser pulses at 485 nm. Mesoporous alumina (blue line) and titania (red line) films deposited on FTO were first grafted with (a) HW-1, (b) HW-2, or (c) HW-3, and the dyed films were also soaked with the Co-phen electrolyte for DSC fabrication during PL measurements. The PL intensity (I) was adjusted in line with the absorbance at 485 nm and further normalized with reference to the transient PL maximum of a corresponding dye-grafted alumina film (Imax,a). The PL integral areas (S) of the alumina (green line) and titania (magenta line) films were normalized against the global PL integral area (Sglobal,a) of a correlative dye-grafted alumina film. 
Next, we employed a nanosecond laser flash photolysis system to probe the kinetics of dual-path charge-transfer reactions of photooxidized dye molecules (D+), with electrons in the conduction-band (CB) and traps below the CB of titania as well as cobalt(II) cations in the electrolyte. By performing spectroelectrochemical measurements (Fig. S1†) on dye-coated titania films immersed in EMITFSI, we identified a strong electronic absorption of oxidized dyes in the near-infrared spectral region. The transient absorption traces (Fig. 4) at 785 nm could be well fitted with multi-exponential functions for convenient determination of half-reaction times (t1/2). When an inert electrolyte composed of 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile was used to wet dye-grafted mesoporous titania films, we recorded decay signals (Fig. 4a) on a millisecond time domain, which are associated with the electron transfer reaction between oxidized dye molecules and charged titania. It is interesting to note that conjugation of fluorenyl or carbazyl to PC induces a desirable larger t1/2 as listed in panel a, which could be rationalized in terms of a larger distance of positive charges on D+ to titania. With respect to HW-3, a larger t1/2 of HW-2 could be associated with its one more 2-hexyldecyl side chain and thus a smaller tilt angle on the surface of titania.
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption traces upon excitation with nanosecond laser pulses. The 4.5 μm-thick mesoporous titania films were grafted with HW-1, HW-2, or HW-3 and further soaked in the inert (panel a) or Co-phen (panel b) electrolyte. Pulse fluence: 19 μJ cm−2. We selected the excitation wavelengths in terms of a 0.5 optical density of dye-grafted titania films to obtain an alike distribution profile of vertically excited states in our testing samples. Excitation wavelength: 586 nm for HW-1, 595 nm for HW-2, and 627 nm for HW-3, probe wavelength: 785 nm. The fittings (solid gray lines) of normalized absorption (ΔA) were obtained via a multi-exponential function: . 
Furthermore in the presence of a Co-phen electrolyte for DSC fabrication (for its recipe see the Experimental section), we recorded much faster absorption decays (Fig. 4b) in the microsecond time domain, implying the occurrence of hole injection from D+ to cobalt(II) ions. An unfavorable larger t1/2 for HW-2 or HW-3 with respect to HW-1 listed in panel b should be jointly caused by a reduced driving force owing to an uplifted HOMO energy level and increased distance from the location of HOMO and the Co(II) electrolyte due to the additional peripheral moieties. However, it is somehow strange to observe a larger t1/2 of HW-2 compared to HW-3, if one only considers their relative HOMO energy levels. We suspect that this could be related to the distribution profile of positive charges at the end of dye molecules, as indicated in Fig. 2d. Overall, the kinetic branch ratios of these two charge transfer reactions for these three dyes all exceed 17, resulting in almost quantitative hole injection yields (ϕHI).
The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of DSCs made from bilayer [(4.6 + 5.0) μm-thick] titania films dyed with HW-1, HW-2, and HW-3 were examined at an interval of 10 nm for incident monochromatic lights. For details on cell fabrication, see the Experimental section. The photocurrent action spectrum (Fig. 5a) of a typical DSC with HW-2 or HW-3 exhibits a maximal EQE of 89%, which is higher than that for HW-1. The relative EQE profiles in the whole visible light region could be in general understood by looking at the wavelength-dependent light-harvesting yields (ϕLH) presented in Fig. 5b, of 8.0 μm-thick, dye-grafted mesoporous titania films. The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSCs measured under an irradiance of simulated AM1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) are presented in Fig. 5c and the averaged cell parameters are compiled in Table 2. Dye HW-1 has a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 12.06 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 824 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 76.0%, generating a PCE of 7.6%. In good agreement with the integrals of EQEs over the standard AM1.5G emission spectrum (ASTM G173-03), dye HW-2 delivers an intensified JSC of 14.78 mA cm−2 and an enlarged VOC of 887 mV, generating a ∼29% augmented PCE of 9.8%, albeit a slightly reduced FF of 74.9%. Moreover, dye HW-3 exhibits an impressive PCE of 10.7%, mainly contributed by the highest JSC of 16.71 mA cm−2 amongst these dyes and a large VOC of 883 mV. As shown in Table 2, under the same device conditions, C272 has a PCE of 10.5%.

J–V curves at a series of light intensities were also measured. As presented in Fig. 5d, the recorded VOC was plotted as a logarithmic function of JSC. It is found from the three almost parallel fitting lines that for each cell VOC escalates ∼82 mV along with one order magnitude increase of JSC. In addition at a given JSC, VOC augments in the order HW-1 < HW-3 < HW-2. To scrutinize the interfacial energetic and dynamic origins of VOC variation,7 we further carried out charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) tests. As Fig. 5e illustrates, a very similar profile of charges extracted from titania (QCE) against VOC suggests that the conduction-band edge and distribution of trap states of titania should be not changed upon dye molecule alteration. A larger number of charges stored in titania is closely associated with a higher VOC. However at a certain QCE, the half lifetime (tTPD1/2) of electrons in the CB as well as traps below the CB of titania elongates in the order HW-1 < HW-3 < HW-2 (Fig. 3f), echoing the same trend of VOC. The dye loading amounts (cm) on the mesoporous titania film were also estimated using visible spectrometry, being 0.9 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for HW-1, 1.7 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for HW-2, and 2.0 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for HW-3. Obviously, the larger molecular size and higher cm of HW-2 and HW-3 jointly contribute to the enhanced VOC. It seems that the additional 2-hexyldecyl possessed by fluorenyl than carbazyl over compensates the adverse effect of a reduced cm on VOC.
Conclusions
To summarize, in combination with electron-acceptor ethynylbenzothiadiazolylbenzoic acid we have designed and synthesized three new metal-free organic photosensitizers with electron-rich PC as the electron-releasing unit. It is found that conjugating 2-hexyldecyl tethering fluorenyl or carbazyl to the free end of PC can red-shift the maximum absorption wavelength and improve the maximum molar absorption coefficient, leading to an improved solar photon harnessing yield along with a high dye loading amount. Time-resolved photophysical studies have suggested that the reduction of energy gap may not diminish the yields of electron and hole injections in dye-sensitized solar cells. Transient photovoltage decay measurements have revealed that end-capping of PC with fluorenyl or carbazyl can significantly attenuate interfacial charge recombination, producing an increased photovoltage and an improved power conversion efficiency. Our studies should shed light on the future molecular engineering of other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon based dyes for solar energy utilization.

Computational details
The ground state geometries were optimized by employing the hybrid B3LYP21 function. Frequency analysis was also performed during the structure optimization to ensure that there is no imaginary frequency. The vertical excitation energies were calculated by the MPW1K functional including 42% of Hartree–Fock exchange,22 which has significant improvements on the description of charge-transfer transition.23 The 6-311G(d,p) basis set was selected for all calculations. The solvent effect of THF on geometry has been simulated by the C-PCM method.24 All calculations were carried out with Gaussian 09 program packages.
Cell fabrication
A double layer titania film made via screen-printing on a pre-cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (NSG, Solar, 4 mm) was used as the negative electrode of DSCs presented in this paper. A 4.5 μm-thick translucent layer of 25 nm sized titania particles was first deposited on a FTO glass and further covered with a 5 μm-thick light-scattering layer of 350–450 nm sized titania particles (WER4-O, Dyesol). Preparation procedures of titania nanocrystals, screen-printing pastes, and nanostructured titania films were very similar to those described in a previous paper.25 A circular titania electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was dye-loaded by immersing it into a 150 μM dye solution in the binary solvent of toluene and ethanol (v/v, 4/6 for HW-1, 1/9 for HW-2, and 2/8 for HW-3). We used toluene as less as possible in the mixed solvent to make the dye molecule to be just soluble for a higher cm for every dye. A 25 μm-thick Surlyn ring was heated at 130 °C to adhere a dyed titania electrode and an Au/Cr coated FTO (NSG, TEC7, 2.2 mm) electrode, under a suitable mechanical pressure. The infiltrated electrolyte is composed of 0.25 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II) di[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.05 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III) tris[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.7 M TBP, and 0.05 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile.
Instrumentation
Nonaqueous electrochemical measurements of THF solutions of dye molecules were performed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox with EMITFSI as the supporting electrolyte. A CHI660C electrochemical workstation was employed in conjunction with a three-electrode electrolytic cell equipped with a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum gauze counter electrode, and a silver wire quasi-reference electrode. To obtain a well-defined cyclic voltammogram, the potential scan rate was kept low, i.e. 5 mV s−1. In addition an iR drop was compensated in consideration of a low conductivity of our electrolyte. DMFc characteristic of an electrochemically reversible behavior was utilized as the internal reference, because it has a larger redox potential difference with respect to a high HOMO DSC dye, in contrast to the routinely used Fc reference. We measured the difference in formal redox potentials of DMFc and Fc to be 0.489 V. After voltammetric measurements, all potentials were calibrated with respect to Fc. Electronic absorption measurements were performed on an Agilent G1103A spectrometer. The details of TCSPC, nanosecond laser flash photolysis, EQE, J–V, CE, and TPD measurements have been reported in our previous papers.26 A black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.160 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during EQE and J–V measurements.

Decamethylferrocene (DMFc) was added as the internal reference and the potential was further calibrated with respect to the standard redox couple, ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). Scan rate: 5 mV s−1. (b) Electronic absorption spectra of 10 μM dyes in THF. (c) LUMO energy levels (values above color bars), HOMO energy levels (value under color bars), and LUMO/HOMO energy gaps (ΔEL/H) of dye molecules as well as their electron-donating (PC, F-PC, and C-PC) and electron-withdrawing (EBTBA) blocks. (d) Optimized geometries and contour plots of frontier molecular orbitals at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of dye molecules and their corresponding electron donors. The values of isodensity surface are fixed at 0.03. The large aliphatic substituents were cut to ethyl for improved computational efficiencies.

 	Fig. 3  Time-correlated PL signals detected at 780 nm upon excitation with picosecond laser pulses at 485 nm. Mesoporous alumina (blue line) and titania (red line) films deposited on FTO were first grafted with (a) HW-1, (b) HW-2, or (c) HW-3, and the dyed films were also soaked with the Co-phen electrolyte for DSC fabrication during PL measurements. The PL intensity (I) was adjusted in line with the absorbance at 485 nm and further normalized with reference to the transient PL maximum of a corresponding dye-grafted alumina film (Imax,a). The PL integral areas (S) of the alumina (green line) and titania (magenta line) films were normalized against the global PL integral area (Sglobal,a) of a correlative dye-grafted alumina film.	 

 	Fig. 4  Transient absorption traces upon excitation with nanosecond laser pulses. The 4.5 μm-thick mesoporous titania films were grafted with HW-1, HW-2, or HW-3 and further soaked in the inert (panel a) or Co-phen (panel b) electrolyte. Pulse fluence: 19 μJ cm−2. We selected the excitation wavelengths in terms of a 0.5 optical density of dye-grafted titania films to obtain an alike distribution profile of vertically excited states in our testing samples. Excitation wavelength: 586 nm for HW-1, 595 nm for HW-2, and 627 nm for HW-3, probe wavelength: 785 nm. The fittings (solid gray lines) of normalized absorption (ΔA) were obtained via a multi-exponential function: .

(b) Wavelength-dependent light-harvesting yields (ϕLH) of 8.0 μm-thick mesoporous titania films grafted with dye molecules and also immersed in a Co-phen electrolyte. (c) Current–voltage (J–V) curves measured under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight. The top of a DSC was laminated with an antireflection film. The aperture area of our metal mask was 0.160 cm2. (d) Open-circuit photovoltages (VOC) plotted against short-circuit photocurrent densities (JSC). The solid linear fittings were also included.
