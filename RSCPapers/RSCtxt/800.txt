    , Accepted 12th September 2018First published on 14th September 2018AbstractSb2Se3 is a highly interesting narrow band gap semiconductor with promising applications in new-generation electronic and photoelectronic devices. However, it has intrinsically low electrical conductivity, which limits its broader scope of applications. To overcome this challenge, Sn-doped Sb2Se3 ((SnxSb1−x)2Se3) nanorods with enhanced electrical conductivity are firstly synthesized via a facile hot-injection method. With increasing the doping concentration of Sn4+, the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods exhibit several orders of magnitude improvement in electrical conductivity, which originates from the increase of carrier concentration. The photodetector based on the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film shows a higher responsivity (6.21 A W−1) and external quantum efficiency (906%), a lower noise equivalent power (3.14 × 10−13 W Hz−1/2), and a fast response time (0.04 s), surpassing the performance of the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector. In addition, the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector also displays a broadband spectral response ranging from UV to IR. Those excellent performances unambiguously demonstrate that the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods are promising for utilization as highly efficient broadband photodetectors.
Introduction
Metal selenide semiconductors have attracted tremendous research attention due to their highly interesting electrical and optical properties as well as their potential applications as high performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.1–9 Among these semiconductors, antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is an indispensable narrow band gap (∼1.0–1.2 eV) semiconductor with excellent photovoltaic, photoconducting, photocatalytic and thermoelectrical properties, which can be applied in multiple fields such as photodetectors, solar cells, thermoelectric power generation, and optoelectronics in a wide spectrum.10–14
One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures are expected to play an important role as fundamental building blocks in electronic, electromechanical and some integrated optoelectronic devices.15–17 The Sb2Se3 crystal possesses an inherent orthorhombic symmetry and is composed of 1D covalently linked (Sb4Se6)n ribbons stacking together via van der Waals forces.10 With unique structural characteristics and versatile physical properties, 1D Sb2Se3 nanostructures have attracted great scientific and technical interest.11–14 Among many available device applications, photodetectors show great value thanks to the merits of large surface-to-volume ratios and Debye length of the 1D Sb2Se3 nanostructures.11 Moreover, Sb2Se3 with a high absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1 is further suitable for visible light photodetectors. However, due to its low electrical conductivity (10−6 Ω−1 m−1 in the bulk state), photodetectors based on Sb2Se3 exhibited a lower spectral response (Rλ) and external quantum efficiency (EQE), which limited their application in high-sensitivity photodetection.18 Several strategies, such as decoration with nanoparticles,18 nano-hybrids,19 and heterojunctions,20 have been employed to improve the electrical conductivity of Sb2Se3 for better photo detection performance. However, the synthesis of Sb2Se3 nanomaterials with tunable electrical conductivity is still facing challenges and needs further exploration.
Doping is well known for efficiently tuning the electrical and photoelectrical properties of semiconductors and has been widely adopted throughout the semiconductor industry.21–23 For example, an In-doped Ga2O3 nanobelt photodetector showed a higher sensitivity, responsivity and quantum efficiency compared with the undoped Ga2O3 nanobelt photodetector.21 Sulfur doping in In2Se3 NWs led to significant improvements in electrical and photoelectrical performances.22 Based on this concept, our recently published work involving Sn-doped Sb2Se3 bulk crystals also presented an enhancement of electrical conductivity and photoelectric properties, which paved the way for further solar cell applications.24 Herein, for the first time, we report the synthesis of high-quality Sn-doped Sb2Se3 ((SnxSb1−x)2Se3) nanorods using a facile and effective hot-injection method. The electrical conductivity of the Sb2Se3 nanorods was significantly increased by incorporating Sn4+ ions into the Sb2Se3 host. Moreover, the as-prepared (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods were used for fabricating prototype photodetectors. The photodetector based on the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film demonstrated a remarkable responsivity and detectivity over a wide range of wavelengths, and attractive figures of merit for highly efficient broadband photodetectors.
Experimental
Materials
Antimony acetate (99.99%), tin chloride (99.99%), selenium dioxide (99%), 1-octadecene (90%) and oleic acid (AR) were purchased from Aladdin. Chloroform and isopropyl alcohol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the reagents were used without further purification.
Synthesis of (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods
An effective hot-injection method was used to synthesize the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.10) nanorods. At first, a uniform mixture of (1 − x) mmol antimony acetate and x mmol tin chloride was added into a 25 mL round-bottom flask with 8 mL of oleic acid as the solvent. The mixture was heated to 220 °C for 1 h under stirring with argon protection, and then cooled to form a cold transparent yellow solution (antimony and tin precursors). To prepare the selenium precursors, 6 mmol selenium dioxide and 15 mL of 1-octadecene were added into another flask and heated at 200 °C for several hours until the solid was completely dissolved and then heated up to the reaction temperature (240 °C) to prepare the expected selenium precursor solution. Subsequently, the antimony and tin precursors were rapidly injected into the selenium precursor solution through a syringe. This mixture was continuously stirred for 10 min before cooling down to room temperature. Finally, the obtained (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods were isolated and purified using chloroform and isopropyl alcohol by centrifugation, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.
Fabrication of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector
To explore the photoconductive characteristics, a prototype photodetector was constructed. The as-synthesized (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods were repeatedly purified and then ultrasonically dispersed in chloroform. The nanorod film was formed by drop-casting the dispersion solution on the pre-patterned inner interdigital Au electrodes. These Au electrodes with fingers (dimensions: width 14.5 μm, length 300 μm, and interfinger spacing 15.5 μm) were fabricated on a SiO2/Si substrate by lithography. The optical image and the corresponding SEM images clearly reveal the photodetector device configuration: the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods were interconnected and formed a compact film that fully covered the interdigital Au electrodes with an effective device area of about 9 × 10−4 cm2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). Finally, before the photocurrent measurements, the nanorod film was dried by vacuum-annealing for 30 min at 40 °C.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a PANalytical B.V. Empyrean 200895 X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation source. The morphologies of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods were observed using a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). An FEI Tecnai G2F20 field emission transmission electron microscope equipped with an EDAX detector was used for the microstructural and chemical componential investigation. The doping nature and the valence state of Sn were also analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). Diffuse reflectance spectra of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods were recorded using a SHIMADZU UV-3150 spectrophotometer. The electrical properties were characterized using a Hall-effect measurement system with the Van der Pauw configuration (BID-RAD HL5500PC) at room temperature under a magnetic field of 0.5 T. The as-synthesized and dried samples were uniaxially pressed into dense wafers with a diameter of 2 cm and a thickness of about 0.2 mm, and then silver paint was applied at four symmetric corners on one face of the wafer for ohmic contacts before the Hall-effect measurements. The photoresponse characteristics of the photodetectors were measured in a clean and shielded box using a SUSS PM8 probe station equipped with a Keithley 2450 SCS. A 650 nm laser with controllable light intensities was used as the light apparatus. A xenon lamp combined with a monochromator was used to investigate the selective spectral response of the device.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.10) nanorods, which all exhibit prominent peaks well accordant with the JCPDS standard card (No. 15-0861) of the orthorhombic phase of Sb2Se3. No diffraction peak corresponding to the detrimental Se or Sb2O3 could be detected. From Fig. 1b, it can be found that the (221) and (301) diffraction peaks shifted gradually toward larger angles with increasing dopant concentration of Sn4+, implying the decreasing lattice constants of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods are due to the gradual substitution of larger Sb3+ ions by the smaller Sn4+ ions in the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 lattice. The experimentally determined lattice parameters a, b and c as a function of Sn4+ doping concentration (x value) further confirmed that the dopant ions (Sn4+) were successfully doped into the host lattice (Fig. S2, ESI†). Successful doping can be attributed to the smaller difference (about 9.2%) in the ion radius between Sb3+ (0.076 nm) and Sn4+ (0.069 nm). This mismatch fulfills the Hume-Rothery criteria (≤15%) for the substitution solubility of metals.25Fig. 1c shows the Sn-3d XPS spectra of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods (x = 0.00, 0.05 and 0.10). Two observable peaks located at 494.6 and 486.2 eV indicated the existence of only Sn4+ (without Sn2+) ions, which was in accordance with the XRD results. The SEM images of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods (Fig. 1d–f, and Fig. S3, ESI†) revealed the formation of high quality nanorods with a diameter of ∼100–200 nm and a length of several micrometers. Importantly, the actual elemental composition for all the samples was also obtained from SEM-coupled EDS analysis, as summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), where a gradual decrease of Sb content and an increase of Sn content can be observed. Though the actual doping concentration of Sn was lower than the nominal value (x value), a synchronous positive correlation further confirmed the successful doping.

Fig. 2a presents the TEM, STEM and the corresponding EDS mapping images of an individual (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod with a well-defined rod geometry and a uniform diameter. The HRTEM image combined with a typical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 2b) further confirmed its highly crystalline nature. Then, the obvious orthorhombic phase lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.392 nm corresponding to the (001) planes also demonstrated the [001] growth direction of the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod. This preferential growth direction (c-axis) of Sb2Se3 is determined intrinsically by its anisotropic Sb–Se atom chain and layer structure.10,26 It is obvious that the intrinsic crystal quality of the Sb2Se3 nanorods was not considerably affected when the Sb3+ ions were substituted by Sn4+ ions. The EDS spectrum (Fig. 2c) of an individual (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod exhibits strong Sb and Se peaks with lower X-ray energy. An observable Sn-Kα peak located at 25.2 eV indicated the successful doping of Sn4+ in the nanorod. The EDS mapping results (inset in Fig. 2a) showed that all the elements (Se, Sb, and Sn) have a uniform distribution throughout the nanorod.

The optical absorption spectrum is usually used to determine the band gap of a semiconductor material, and it is really important for analysing and engineering high performance photodetectors. In our work, the optical properties of the as-synthesized (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods were investigated according to their optical absorption. The absorption spectra could be obtained from the corresponding diffuse reflectance spectra by performing Kubelka–Munk transformations: F(R) = α/Λ = (1 − R)2/(2R), where R is the reflectance, and α and Λ are the absorption and scattering coefficients, respectively.27 As shown in Fig. 3a, the onset of absorption for the Sb2Se3 nanorods starts near 1100 nm, and then shows a gradual shift toward longer wavelengths with increasing dopant concentrations of Sn4+. Fig. 3b shows a plot of [F(R)hν]2versus energy (hν). The obtained direct band gap of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods decreases from 1.24 eV (x = 0.00) to 1.20 eV (x = 0.10), which could be attributed to the cooperation of the Burstein–Moss shift and the renormalization effect. This mechanism exists in narrow band gap semiconductors with specific doping levels.28,29 Importantly, the tunable band gap of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods overlaps well with the solar spectrum, making them attractive candidates for efficient photoelectric devices, including high performance broadband photodetection.

Due to a small band gap (approximately 1.2 eV) and a high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1), Sb2Se3 has been used to fabricate visible and near-infrared photodetectors. However, the low spectral response (Rλ) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the Sb2Se3-based photodetector limited its application for high-sensitivity photodetection. In this work, the photodetection performances of the Sb2Se3-based photodetectors were significantly improved by increasing the electrical conductivity of the Sb2Se3 nanorod via Sn4+ doping in the Sb2Se3 nanorod. To investigate the influence of the Sn4+ ions on the electrical conductivity of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods, an essential method based on Hall-effect measurements was used. Fig. 4a shows the resistivity and the carrier concentration of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods as a function of doping concentration of the Sn4+ ions (x value). The Sb2Se3 nanorods exhibited a weak conductivity with the lower carrier concentration. When the Sn4+ ions were introduced into the Sb2Se3 nanorods, a significant decrease of the resistivity could be observed. The resistivity of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods demonstrated a nearly logarithmic relationship with the x value, which rapidly decreased from 1.229 × 107 Ω cm (x = 0.00) to 8.746 × 104 Ω cm (x = 0.10). Fig. 4a also shows a significant increase of the carrier concentration from 7.16 × 1011 cm−3 (x = 0.00) to 3.40 × 1014 cm−3 (x = 0.10). The relationship between the conductivity and the carrier concentration can be described by the following expression: σ = neμ(1)where σ is the electrical conductivity, n is the charge carrier concentration, e is the electron charge and μ is the mobility.30 The measured μ values of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods were 0.709 (x = 0.00), 0.760 (x = 0.01), 0.221 (x = 0.03), 0.204 (x = 0.05), and 0.210 (x = 0.10), respectively. Considering that the μ values were of the same order of magnitude for the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods, the main factor accounting for the improvement of electrical conductivity was the increase of carrier concentration when the Sn4+ ions were introduced into the Sb2Se3 nanorods. A similar mechanism with increasing carrier density has also been described in thermally evaporated Sb2Se3:Sn amorphous films.31 In addition, the conduction type of the as-synthesized (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods was determined by the Hall-effect measurements, and all the samples presented a p-type nature. According to previous studies, Sb2Se3 shows intrinsic p-type conductivity with the major carrier of holes.32 Herein, it is noted that the valance shell configurations of Sb3+ and Sn4+ are [Kr] 4d105s25p0 and [Kr] 4d105s05p0, respectively. Obviously, the Sn4+ ion has two less valance electrons compared to the Sb3+ ion. Therefore, the Sn4+ ion acts like a hole donor at the doped site and thus enhances the electrical conductivity of the initial p-type Sb2Se3 system.

(b) Dependence of dark current and photocurrent (under 650 nm light illumination at a bias voltage of 10 V) of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film photodetectors on doping concentration of Sn4+ ions (x value). 
To demonstrate the potential application of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods with enhanced electrical conductivity, we fabricated a typical photodetector based on a (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film with two outer electrodes (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5b shows the I–V curves of the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector in the dark and under illumination at different light intensities using a 650 nm laser as the illumination source. The dark current was very low (about −11 nA at −10 V), implying that the electrical conductivity of the Sb2Se3 nanorods under dark conditions was very low and similar to the bulk Sb2Se3 (σ ∼ 10−6–10−2 Ω−1 m−1). Upon illumination, the photocurrent was significantly increased with the increase of the light intensity. Fig. 5c presents the I–V curves of the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector under the same measuring conditions. Compared with the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector, the dark current increased by approximately 12.7 times (from −11 nA to −140 nA at −10 V) and the photocurrent increased by approximately 4.8 times (from −137 nA to −655 nA at −10 V, 6.35 mW cm−2). An important figure of merit for photodetectors is the responsivity (Rres), which could be calculated by: Rres = Iph/IirrA(2)where Iph is the background substituted photocurrent (Iillumination − Idark), Iirr is the intensity of the incident light, and A is the effective device area (9 × 10−4 cm2 for this device).33 The Rres of the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector was found to be about 4.1 times higher than that of the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector. The photodetectors based on the other (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 (x = 0.01, 0.03 and 0.10) nanorod films also demonstrated similar results (Fig. S4, ESI†). This significant improvement could greatly promote the application of the Sb2Se3-based nanorod film in high performance photodetectors. Fig. 5d shows the photocurrent of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05) nanorod film photodetector as a function of incident light intensity. The photocurrent was nearly linear to the incident light power densities and the dependence could be described by the power law: Iph = CPθ(3)where Iph represents the photocurrent, P is the incident light power density, C is a constant at a specific wavelength, and θ is an exponent.34,35 The fitting curves showed that θ = 0.52 (x = 0.00), 0.50 (x = 0.01), 0.49 (x = 0.03), and 0.51 (x = 0.05), respectively. All these θ values are non-unity, indicating the existence of surface defects and carrier trapping at the localized states, which could induce a complex electron–hole non-radiative recombination process.36

Dark currents and photocurrents at different power densities of (b) the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector and (c) the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector. (d) Photocurrents measured as a function of incident light density at a bias voltage of 10 V. 

Fig. 4b shows the dark currents and photocurrents (under 650 nm light illumination at a bias voltage of 10 V) of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film photodetectors as a function of doping concentration of the Sn4+ ions (x value). Both dark currents and photocurrents of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film photodetectors demonstrated a nearly logarithmic relationship with the x value, which implied the significant influence of the doped Sn4+ ions on the electrical conductivity and photoresponsivity. When the Sn4+ ions were introduced into the Sb2Se3 nanorod, the Sb3+ ions were substituted by the Sn4+ ions, which might result in elevated dark current and photocurrent due to the intrinsic lattice defects.
The time response is also a key factor for photodetector performance, which demonstrates the capability of a device to follow a fast-varying optical signal. Fig. 6a and b show the time-resolved photoresponse of the photodetectors based on the Sb2Se3 nanorod film and the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film, respectively. These two photodetectors were illuminated under a 650 nm laser with controllable incident light densities of 0.92, 2.89 and 6.35 mW cm−2. When the light was turned ON with an applied voltage of 10 V, as shown in Fig. 6a, the current of the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector dramatically increased from 10 nA (dark condition) to 136 nA (with 6.35 mW cm−2 light illumination), and then sharply returned to its initial value as the light was turned OFF. This light response remained the same after multiple cycles, demonstrating the excellent stability and reproducibility of the photodetector. For the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector, the same phenomena could be observed except for a larger photocurrent (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6c and d show the magnified plot of one response cycle. In the time domain, the response time (τres) and the recovery time (τrec) were respectively defined as the time required for reaching 90% of the ΔI (ΔI is the difference between the maximum and minimum current) when the light was ON and the time for returning from the maximum current to 10% of the ΔI when the light was OFF. The τres and τrec of the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector were 0.34 s and 0.36 s, respectively. For the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector, the τres decreased to 0.04 s and the τrec increased to 0.85 s, respectively. This could be explained by doping due to the introduction of interfacial states, deep states and dangling bonds in the nanostructures.37 These states can trap one particular type of charge carrier, thus decreasing the overall number of electron–hole recombinations. As a result, large photocarrier lifetimes and external quantum efficiencies (EQE) can be expected in the doped nanostructures. Specifically, the major trapping mechanism for the Sb2Se3 nanorods is based on the existence of chemisorbed oxygen molecules. Then, for the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorods, since Sn4+ existed in the lattice, it might act as additional trapping sites for the photo-generated electrons through the charge transfer reaction Sn4+ → Sn2+,31 leaving behind the unpaired holes to increase the conductivity. This could be the reason for the observed larger photocurrent and lower response time (τres) in (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 in comparison with Sb2Se3. However, the defect sites introduced in the doping process can also increase the recovery time (τrec) as trapped charge carriers are not immediately available for recombination when the light is switched OFF. Such a response has been observed previously in similar systems.38 Furthermore, it is worth noting that the fast response time was comparable to some outstanding previously reported results.39

Broad spectral detection is beneficial for extending the application of photodetectors. According to the optical absorption spectra and the band gap of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods, photodetection at a monochromatic wavelength crossing over the UV-visible-NIR range was studied. Fig. 7a shows the wavelength-dependent responsivity (Rres) of the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector and the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector. Both photodetectors presented a similar selective spectral response from 300 nm to 1100 nm, and it reached the highest responsivity (6.21 A W−1) at 850 nm. The sharp peak at 850 nm can be attributed to the absorption maxima of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods, which are about 800–850 nm according to their optical absorption spectra (Fig. 3a), and the higher incident light absorption efficiency can lead to a higher responsivity of the photodetector. It is worth noting that the broad spectral response makes the photodetectors useful for multispectral applications. More importantly, the Rres of the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector was found to be about 3–4 times that of the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector, which was comparable to some reported excellent inorganic photodetectors.40 Furthermore, the detection limit for a photodetector is specified by the noise equivalent power (NEP), i.e., NEP = SI/Rres, where SI is the root mean square (RMS) dark noise density, which is measured within a specified bandwidth (commonly 1 Hz).41 To obtain SI, a large sequence of current fluctuations (Inoise) was measured with 0.5 s of integration time, while keeping the photodetector in the dark. The RMS noise density was then calculated as SI = (〈Inoise2〉/1 Hz)1/2. Fig. 7b shows the NEP across the working spectrum in this study. It could be found that the NEP is 4.18 × 10−12 W Hz−1/2 for the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector and reached to 3.14 × 10−13 W Hz−1/2 for the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector at 850 nm, which indicated that a very weak incident light (∼picowatt incidence) above the noise level could be detected. The NEP values of those (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film photodetectors were comparable to state-of-the-art devices.42–44Fig. 7c and d present the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the spectral detectivity (D*) of the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector and the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector, which could be calculated using the following equations: EQE = hcRres/eλ and D* = Rres/(2eJd)1/2, where h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, Rres is the responsivity, e is the electron charge, λ is the wavelength, and Jd is the dark current.21,45 The corresponding highest values of EQE (906%) and D* (5.03 × 1011 Jones) of the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector are extremely encouraging. Table 1 summarizes the key parameters of our (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector, compared to various broadband photodetectors reported in the literature. The performance of our devices is comparable to those state-of-the-art devices, especially with a higher detectivity.46–49 These results can be attributed to the high quality (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods with enhanced electrical conductivity and light absorption efficiency. Importantly, they further confirm the excellent broadband detection performance of the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector.

Conclusions
In summary, the hot-injection method has been used to synthesize high-quality (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods with excellent electrical conductivity. With increasing doping concentration of the Sn4+ ions, the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods exhibited a significant improvement in electrical conductivity of several orders of magnitude, which could be attributed to the much higher carrier concentration. The photoconductive characteristics of the as-synthesized nanorods were investigated by fabricating prototype photodetectors based on the (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorod film. The representative (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector demonstrated a broadband spectral response ranging from UV to IR with the highest responsivity of 6.21 A W−1 and an external quantum efficiency of 906%, which was much higher than that of the Sb2Se3 nanorod film photodetector. Moreover, the (Sn0.05Sb0.95)2Se3 nanorod film photodetector also showed a very low noise equivalent power (3.14 × 10−13 W Hz−1/2), short response/recovery times (0.04/0.85 s), and long-term durability. These properties are beneficial for the fabrication of high performance photodetectors based on (SnxSb1−x)2Se3 nanorods with application potential in the fields of environmental sensing, optical switching, and optoelectronic integrated circuits.
