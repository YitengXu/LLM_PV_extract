    , Accepted 17th March 2021First published on 17th March 2021AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved tremendous success in advancing high power conversion efficiencies. However, defect-induced recombination at grain boundaries (GBs) and the surface of polycrystalline perovskites seriously hinder the further performance enhancement and environmental stability of PSCs. Here, a simple passivating molecule, 4-nitrophthalonitrile (4NPN) with σ–π accepting nitro (–NO2) and cyano groups (–CN), was employed to passivate the charged defects in perovskites. The addition of electron-deficient 4NPN into the perovskite layer of PSCs could not only enhance VOC and the FF, leading to high PCE over 22% but also improved environmental stability. These improvements were attributed to the effective passivation of the defects in the perovskite film by the strongly polarized nitro/cyano groups. In addition, the electron-deficient 4NPN could slightly adjust the energy level of the perovskite facilitating more efficient hole transfer. This work demonstrates the role of strong electron-withdrawing nitro/cyano groups in passivating the vacancy-defects of perovskites and 4NPN as a simple passivator conducive to obtaining high-performance PSCs.
Introduction
Photovoltaic technology such as commercialized silicon and GaAs solar cells directly convert solar energy into electricity through the photovoltaic effect to meet the demand for renewable energy.1 In the past few years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn tremendous attention due to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with a record efficiency of 25.5% and have been deemed the champion of third-generation solar cells.2,3 The superior PCEs of PSCs are attributed to the strong light-absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, and tunable direct bandgap (Eg).4–11 Besides, lead halide perovskites show good solubility and facile solution-processability, enabling polycrystalline films with high quality, low-cost, and mechanical flexibility for large-scale commercialization.12,13 Despite the advantages in PCEs and facile fabrication of PSCs, there are still challenges facing the whole community to reproducibly fabricate high-performance devices.
According to theoretical and experimental studies regarding the defects in halide hybrid perovskites, many ionic defects exist at the grain boundaries (GBs) and the surface of perovskite films.14–17 These ionic defects are usually composed of negatively or positively charged species that can capture photogenerated carriers, limit the diffusion of carriers, reduce the carrier lifetime, and cause ion migration and diffusion.18,19 The defects also introduce mid-gap states and act as non-radiative charge recombination centers.20 Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore strategies to passivate the defects in the perovskite films.21
Minimizing charged defects at the GBs and surface to suppress charge recombination and optimizing the interfacial band alignment between the perovskite layer and charge transport layers are critical factors for achieving high-performance PSCs.22–24 To mitigate the influence of the defects, small molecular additives with different functional groups have presented excellent passivation effects.25–30 Zhang et al. employed p-phenylenediamine (PPE), terephthalonitrile (TPN), and 4-aminobenzonitrile (ABN), containing both amino (–NH2) and cyano (–CN) groups as passivation molecules. They revealed the role of electron density distributions (EDD) on the effect of passivation, and the addition of ABN led to the best efficiency of 21.02%.31 Li et al. used the 2-aminoterephthalic acid molecule containing both amino (–NH2) and carboxyl group (–COOH) as cross-linking agents to inhibit the migration of ions and passivate the trap states at GBs.32 Moreover, sulfonate (–OSO3−),33 fluorine,34–36 hydroxyl,37 and phosphine oxide (–PO3−)38,39 groups have also been confirmed to act as passivating agents. However, most of these passivating agents are based on complicated molecules, and the effect of the nitro group (–NO2) is rarely mentioned. Only a few reports on the interaction of nitro groups with the PbI6 cage of the perovskite40 and the addition of nitrobenzene to improve the PCE and the reliability of PSCs via passivation effects exist.41
Here, 4-nitrophthalonitrile (4NPN) was employed to passivate the defects of the perovskite for high-performance PSCs. 4NPN composed of a highly electron-deficient benzene ring substituted by a strong electron-withdrawing nitro group (–NO2), and cyano groups (–CN) is an important chemical intermediate (Fig. 1a). The cyano and the nitro groups (σ–π acceptor) can induce polarization of the π electron cloud over 4NPN. The HOMO–LUMO plots at the B3LYP 6-311 G(d,p) level in Fig. 1b indicate that the HOMO is located on the CH (in the ring) and nitro group, especially over the nitro group, while the LUMO is more focused on the nitro group, benzene ring and the nitrile group para- to the nitro group. Due to the localized molecular orbital, 4NPN has high cohesive energy and can easily assemble at the GBs. The easily polarized nitro and cyano groups can interact with positively charged defects and suppress ion migration. In particular, 4NPN can coordinate with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions, thereby minimizing the trap states in the perovskite film.

Furthermore, 4NPN also modulates the energy levels of the perovskite absorber to achieve better energy level alignment, facilitating hole injection into the hole transport layer and boosting the device efficiency.42–44 These results lead to an enhanced PCE from 21.1% of the pristine device to 22.1% of the 4NPN-passivated device. Additionally, the long-term stability of the 4NPN-passivated device was significantly improved, retaining around 91% of its initial PCE under an ambient atmosphere for 50 days.
Experimental methods

FTO substrates were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co,. Ltd, China. The SnO2 colloid precursor (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. PbI2 (99.99%) and PbBr2 (99.99%, perovskite grade) were purchased from TCI. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, anhydrous), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, anhydrous), chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%, anhydrous), 4-tert-butylpyridine (98%), and bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Shenzhen Feiming Science and Technology Co., Ltd. All of the purchased materials were used as received without further treatment. Formamidine iodide (FAI), methylammonium chloride (MACl), and methylammonium bromine (MABr) were synthesized according to previous literature.45 Formamidine acetate (99%, AR), methylamine solution (30 wt% in H2O), hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid (55.0–58.0% in H2O, contains ≤1.5% hypophosphorous acid as a stabilizer) and 4-nitrophthalonitrile (4NPN) were purchased from Aladdin.
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
The FTO substrates were hand-washed with detergent and then cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol each for15 min, respectively. After drying under a nitrogen flow, the washed FTO substrates were treated with a plasma cleaner for 10 min. The SnO2 colloidal solution was used as an ETL; it was deposited onto FTO substrates by spin-coating at 3000 rpm and 2000 s−1 acceleration for 30 s, and then the substrates were annealed in the ambient atmosphere at 150 °C for 30 min.
The perovskite precursor solution contains 1.53 M PbI2, 0.11 M PbBr2, 1.40 M FAI, 0.11 M MABr, and 0.50 M MACl in anhydrous DMF and DMSO (the volume ratio of DMF to DMSO was 8:1). 4NPN was directly added. After preparation of the perovskite solution, it was stirred over 6 hours without heating. Before the deposition of the perovskite layer, the SnO2 substrates were treated for 10 min with a plasma cleaner. The perovskite layers were spin-coated on FTO/SnO2 through a two-step program (1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 25 s). 150 μL chlorobenzene was dropped on the perovskite film 5 s before the end of the program. Then the substrates were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min.
Spiro-OMeTAD solution contains 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 35 μL of Li-TFSI solution (260 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), and 30 μL of t-BP in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The mixed solution was spin-coated on the cooled perovskite substrates at 3000 rpm and 2000 s−1 acceleration for 30 s. Afterward, the samples were left resting overnight in a dry environment. Finally, 120 nm of a silver electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation.
Results and discussion
The electrostatic surface potential (ESP) map of 4NPN from density functional theory (DFT) calculations is shown in Fig. 1c. The nitro and cyano groups in 4NPN present high electron densities, which can act as Lewis base sites to interact with defects like under-coordinated Pb2+ cations in the perovskite, agreeing with the conclusion from Fig. 1a.22,41 To better study the interaction behavior of 4NPN with the perovskite, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to investigate the interactions of 4NPN with PbI2 (Fig. 1b) or PbBr2 (Fig. S1†). The pure 4NPN sample showed a typical asymmetric vibration of the NO bond at 1530 cm−1, the peak of cyano groups at 2241 cm−1, and the stretching vibration of the C–H bond at 2880 cm−1. When PbI2 or PbBr2 was added, the IR bands of the NO bond changed, and the IR bands of the cyano groups still remained at 2241 cm−1. Besides, extra peaks at about 2849 cm−1 and 2920 cm−1 appeared. This should be attributed to the interactions between the nitro group and Pb2+ ions in PbI2 or PbBr2, which could cause a change in the electron density on the benzene ring, results in extra peaks and shifts in the IR band, indicating the possibility of 4NPN to passivate the defects in the perovskite film.
To show the influence of 4NPN in perovskite films, we prepared high-quality (FAPbI3)0.92(MAPbBr3)0.08 perovskite films by the one-step spin-coating deposition method. 4NPN was applied as an additive into the perovskite precursors to function as a Lewis base passivator, ensuring a homogeneous distribution of 4NPN in the perovskite layer during the annealing process (the detailed fabrication of perovskite films was clearly described in the “Experimental section”).
The passivation mechanism of 4NPN with under-coordinated Pb2+ cations was described and is shown in Fig. 2a, and we verified this mechanism by different characterization methods. The effect of 4NPN on the crystallinity of the perovskite could be characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the corresponding perovskite layers. As shown in Fig. S2,† the peaks at 2θ values of 14.16°, 28.38°, and 43.07° correspond to the (110), (220), and (330) planes of the perovskite crystalline structure. Compared with those of the pristine film, the diffraction patterns of the 4NPN-passivated film showed no shifts, but the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 4NPN-passivated film at 110 planes slightly decreased from 0.118 of the pristine film to 0.112, which implied that the addition of 4NPN did not change the perovskite crystal structure while the size of the perovskite crystal could be increased due to the cross-linking effect of 4NPN. The morphology of the perovskite film has a substantial impact on the PCE of PSCs. To unveil the surface morphology and grain sizes of the perovskite layer, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements on related perovskite films. Fig. 2b and c exhibit the top-view SEM images of the pristine and 4NPN-passivated perovskite films, respectively. In comparison with the control film, we found that the introduction of 4NPN had a negligible impact on the general morphology of the films but slightly increased the grain size varying from 700 nm to 2 μm. Moreover, the addition of the 4NPN molecule could minimize the pinholes/voids on the surface, thereby forming a more compact and high-quality perovskite film. Combining the XRD and SEM results, the addition of 4NPN could not induce dramatic phase transformation after permeating into the perovskite. Fig. 2d and e show the corresponding AFM images, where the surface roughness decreases from 22.4 nm for the pristine sample to 15.7 nm for the 4NPN-passivated sample. A smaller roughness means a smoother film, which indicates that the addition of 4NPN can lower the number of defects in the perovskite film and form a more compact and uniform film, which is consistent with SEM results.24,32

To evaluate the influence of 4NPN on the photovoltaic performance of devices, we fabricated PSCs with n–i–p architecture (FTO/SnO2/Perovskite-4NPN/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag) as shown in Fig. 2a. The mechanism of reducing under-coordinated Pb2+ cations in perovskite films by additional 4NPN is also illustrated. The cross-sectional SEM images of the perovskite films with or without 4NPN are shown in Fig. S3a and b,† respectively. In the pristine device, the thicknesses of the perovskite layer, Spiro-OMeTAD, the Ag electrode are 620 nm, 150 nm, and 120 nm, respectively. In the passivated device, the thickness of the perovskite layer with the addition of 4NPN increased to 660 nm. From Fig. S3,† no grain boundary parallel to the substrate was observed for perovskite layers either with or without 4NPN, implying uninterrupted charge transport through the vertical direction of the perovskite layer. The concentration of 4NPN added into the precursor solutions was optimized according to the performance of the resultant devices. As shown in Fig. S4,† the optimal concentration of 4NPN was identified to be 1 mg mL−1, based on which all the following characterization studies of the 4NPN-passivated perovskite films and devices were performed. Fig. 3a and b display, respectively, the current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best-performing PSCs with and without 4NPN in reverse (from VOC to JSC) and forward scans (from JSC to VOC) under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation. Specifically, the pristine PSCs showed the best PCE of 21.1% (a VOC of 1.10 V, JSC of 23.66 mA cm−2, and FF of 81.05%) in reverse scan and a PCE of 20.2% (a VOC of 1.08 V, JSC of 23.32 mA cm−2, and FF of 80.33%) in the forward scan. Compared with the pristine PSCs, the 4NPN-passivated PSCs showed an improved PCE of 22.1% (a VOC of 1.12 V, JSC of 23.78 mA cm−2, and FF of 82.87%) in reverse scan and a PCE of 21.5% (a VOC of 1.10 V, JSC of 23.68 mA cm−2, and FF of 82.44%) in the forward scan (Table 1). The significantly improved VOC from 1.10 V to 1.12 V after the addition of 4NPN demonstrates the passivation effect of 4NPN. The improved FF values from 81.05% to 82.87% indicate a more efficient charge extraction from the perovskite to the HTM layer. Moreover, a shrunk hysteresis index (H-index) from 4.08% to 2.67% was observed when introducing 4NPN into the perovskite layer. The reproducibility of 4NPN-passivated PSCs was analyzed by recording the photovoltaic parameters of around 20 devices under the reverse scan, which statistically agreed with the improved VOC and FF due to the addition of 4NPN (Fig. S5†). Moreover, after calculating the PCEs we recorded in Fig. S5d,† the average efficiency of the devices with and without 4NPN is 21.8% and 20.6%, respectively. This result further illustrates that 4NPN-passivation helps to improve the performance of PSCs.

The steady-state outputs around the maximum power point (MPP) of the devices with and without 4NPN were measured to ensure the reliability of the performance of the device and are shown in Fig. 3c. The best-performance pristine device showed a stabilized efficiency of 20.8% for 600 s at a Vmax of 0.94 V. And for the 4NPN-passivated device, a stabilized efficiency of 21.5% could be achieved at a Vmax of 0.96 V. These results are close to the PCE obtained from the J–V measurements. Also, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and calculated the integrated current density for pristine and 4NPN-passivated devices (Fig. 3d). The EQE spectrum of the PSCs with 4NPN exhibited a higher photon-to-current conversion efficiency than the control PSC over the wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm, and the integrated current densities from EQE values are well-matched with JSC from J–V measurements (22.64 and 22.84 mA cm−2 for control and 4NPN-passivated devices, respectively) (Table 1).
Moreover, to explore the reasons behind the impact of 4NPN on the performance of PSCs, we further investigated the optical and electronic properties of different perovskite films. Fig. S6† shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of perovskite films without and with the 4NPN additive, and both exhibit cut-off absorption at about 785 nm, corresponding to the same optical band gap of 1.58 eV. A slightly higher absorption over the whole absorption range can be observed in the film with 4NPN, which could be related to the gently enlarged perovskite grains in SEM measurements.
We measured the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the perovskite films to characterize the surface elemental coordination state before and after adding 4NPN (Fig. 4a). For the pristine perovskite film, the two weak peaks at 142.02 and 137.15 eV can be attributed to metallic Pb (Pb0), which means the existence of iodine vacancies and recombination centers.46,47 After the addition of 4NPN, the two Pb0 peaks disappeared, and the two prominent peaks from Pb2+ were shifted 0.3 eV to the direction of a lower binding energy, indicating defect passivation. Based on the electrostatic surface potential shown in Fig. 1c, the nitro and cyano groups in 4NPN with high electron density and polarity can coordinate with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions and lead to the shift of the binding energy. Besides, the energy level of the two I 3d cores also shifted 0.27 eV to a lower level after 4NPN addition, which indicates the interaction between the nitro group and the iodide ions48,49 (Fig. S7† and Table 1).

Moreover, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted to estimate the changes in the energy levels of pristine and 4PNP-passivated perovskite films (Fig. 4b and c). From the secondary electron cutoff (SECO) shown in Fig. 4c, the work functions (WF) and valence band region (Fermi edge) of the pristine and 4NPN-passivated perovskite films were estimated to be 4.56 eV/1.26 eV and 4.61 eV/1.13 eV, respectively. According to the energy of WF and valence bands, the valence band maximum (VBM) was moved from −5.82 eV of the pristine film to −5.74 eV of the 4NPN-passivated film (Table 1). Because the HOMO of Spiro-OMeTAD is −5.09 eV,22 the relatively shallow valence band maximum of the 4NPN-passivated perovskite film is excepted to provide more efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 4d).
We measured steady-state photoluminescence (ss-PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (tr-PL), to further study the charge transport and recombination dynamics in perovskite films. Fig. 4e shows the ss-PL spectra of pristine and 4NPN-passivated perovskite films, both of which exhibit band emission at 785 nm. The PL intensity of the perovskite film was remarkably enhanced when 4NPN is added due to the lower non-radiative recombination loss in the presence of the passivating 4NPN. The defect passivation effect on the recombination dynamics can be seen from the tr-PL measurements of the perovskite films (Fig. 4f). The PL amplitudes and decay time were fitted with the biexponential expression:31,50–52 (1)where γ0 is the decay constant, Ai is the decay amplitude, and τi is the decay time. The related fitting parameters of tr-PL are summarized in Table 1 and Table S1.† The average PL decay time (τave) was calculated from the following equation: τavg = α1τ1 + α2τ2(2) (3)
From the tr-PL results, we can observe a significant difference between pristine and 4NPN-passivated perovskite films. The calculated τave of the pristine sample was 54.5 ns, which is much shorter than that of the sample with 4NPN (τave = 226.5 ns). The longer lifetime in the 4NPN-passivated sample indicates that the addition of 4NPN could effectively suppress the non-radiative recombination, leading to increased VOC and FF values, consistent with the ss-PL results.
Moreover, we measured the dark J–V curves based on hole-only devices further to investigate the trap state density of the perovskite films. The devices were fabricated with a structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag.53 The trap density in the perovskite layer can be deduced from the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which corresponds to the onset voltage of the trap-filled region. The defect density Ntrap can be calculated from the equation:54,55 (4)where ε is the relative dielectric constan,56ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), and L is the thickness of the perovskite films about 620 nm for the pristine perovskite film and about 660 nm for 4NPN-passivated perovskite film based on the cross-sectional SEM image, as shown in Fig. S3.† Based on the J–V curves in Fig. 5a and b, the VTFL values of the pristine and the 4NPN-passivated devices are calculated to be 1.25 V and 1.12 V, respectively (Table 1). The trap-state densities are also calculated to be 1.17 × 1016 and 9.24 × 1015 cm−3 for the pristine and 4NPN-passivated devices, respectively. These results clearly proved that the addition of 4NPN could significantly reduce the trap-state density, contributing to the suppressed charge recombination and higher device performance.

Furthermore, to study the charge-transport process and recombination kinetics in PSCs, we measured electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As shown in Fig. 5c, the Nyquist plots for PSCs were measured, and the equivalent circuit model of PSCs for EIS is shown in Fig. S8.† According to previous studies, the internal resistance of recombination is related to the radii of the impedance semicircle.53,57 After 4NPN as additive was added into the provskite in the devices, the semicircle at a low frequency showed a larger arc than that of the pristine device, indicating a more significant recombination resistance (Rrec) to suppress charge recombination and responsive to the enhanced VOC.
Finally, the long-term stability of PSCs with or without 4NPN was compared. All the devices were tracked under the ambient atmosphere (RH ∼ 30% and in the dark) for 50 days. As shown in Fig. 5d, the 4NPN-passivated devices can maintain 91% of their initial PCE, while the pristine devices only retain 83.4% of their initial PCE after the same period of aging time. The much-enhanced stability of the 4NPN-passivated devices can be attributed to the decreased defect density and tighter crystal structure in perovskite films. Besides, the addition of 4NPN can prevent the diffusion of oxygen and H2O into the grain boundaries.
Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the performance of PSCs with the 4NPN additive and proved that the highly electron-deficient 4NPN could passivate defects on the GBs of the perovskite. The addition of 4NPN into the perovskite can significantly increase the photovoltaic performance of the resulting devices with a high PCE of over 22%. Compared to the pristine devices, adding 4NPN can effectively improve the hole extraction and prolong the carrier lifetime, indicating suppressed non-radiative recombination for improved VOC. Besides, the perovskite with 4NPN shows relatively shallower valence bands and provides more efficient hole transfer for a higher FF. Also, PSCs with 4NPN achieved superior stability due to the significantly reduced defects in the perovskite film and the suppressed diffusion of oxygen and H2O diffusion into GBs. Our work emphasizes the role of σ–π accepting nitro (–NO2) and cyano groups (–CN) as the active sites for passivation of perovskites and provides a simple method to fabricate PSCs with higher efficiency and improved stability.
