    , Accepted 6th November 2012First published on 8th November 2012AbstractLow-cost and high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted intense research attention recently, especially the key component of sensitized titanium dioxide (TiO2) photoanode. Owing to the short electron diffusion length of sintered TiO2 nanoparticles and the charge recombination near the FTO substrate, crucial structures of overlayers on the FTO substrate and the whole TiO2 film have been applied. However, the generally accepted TiCl4 overlayer cannot work effectively due to its loose structure and the presence of chloride ions. Therefore, researchers are still faced with the challenge of developing new efficient overlayers on TiO2 photoanodes. In this study, by employing super-pure peroxotitanium solution (PTS), we have succeeded in significantly improving DSSC performance with simple dip coating. The uniform and compact structure of PTS overlayers can be ascribed to a polymerization mechanism. Overlayers derived from TiCl4, PTS and other materials such as Nb2O5, Al2O3, SiO2 or ZrO2 are probed. Among these coatings, an energy conversion efficiency as high as 7.33% has been achieved by applying PTS overlayers on the FTO substrate and the whole TiO2 film.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells have been investigated extensively due to their low-cost and high-performance in contrast with traditional photovoltaic cells.1,2 The theoretical efficiencies for N719-sensitized cells and N3-sensitized cells are as high as 14.3% and 19.6%.3 However, a practical cell assembled with even the best sensitizer and electrolyte could only exhibit a modest 12% in efficiency.4 One well recognized mechanism for this shortfall in efficiency is the intense charge recombination occurring particularly near the FTO conductive substrate,5 and another important reason is the short electron diffusion length (10–35 μm, as determined by the product of the electron diffusion coefficient and electron lifetime) of sintered TiO2 nanoparticles.6,7 Despite these disadvantages, the TiO2-based nanocrystalline photoanode is irreplaceable especially for its appropriate electronic band structure and remarkable chemical stability.8–10 After performance optimization by numerous researchers, two critical structures have been introduced into the TiO2 photoanode: a 100 nm TiO2 blocking layer coating on the FTO substrate/anode interface and an ultrathin coating of TiO2, Nb2O5,11,12 Al2O3, SiO213 or ZrO214 on the outer layer of the whole photoanode. Among these materials, DSSCs with TiO2 coating by the TiCl4 method show the highest efficiency (>10% by Grätzel15). Therefore, the TiCl4-generated overlayer has been considered as a standard process for optimizing cell performance. Nevertheless, owing to the uncontrollable nature of te hydrolysis process and the existence of chloride ion impurities, the overlayer formed by TiCl4 hydrolysis is generally not homogeneous.16 Moreover, defects in the TiO2 layer by TiCl4 hydrolysis may exist at grain boundaries between nanosize TiO2 particles.17 Thus, a new functional coating on TiO2 photoanodes is expected to achieve a significant improvement in photon–electricity conversion efficiency.
The peroxo route was initially developed by Kudo and modified by other researchers to obtain WO3 and MO3 films with various exotic properties.18,19 In the peroxo solution, anions are well dispersed and have a cage-like structure known as a Keggin structure. The concentrated peroxotitanium solution would polymerize through a sol–gel process which is widely applied in nano-structure synthesis because molecule level blending can be simply achieved.20 In this report, using a high-purity peroxotitanium solution, we present a uniform and condensed overlayer containing amorphous TiO2 through a controllable sol–gel process. Through the peroxo route,18,20 a super-pure peroxotitanium solution (PTS) merely containing Ti, O and H elements could be coated on the FTO substrate and the outer layer of the whole TiO2 photoanode by a simple dip-coating method. During heat treatment, the O22− works as a strong oxidant and the polymerization process produces a compact Ti–O–Ti network with much less impurities and defects, yielding higher energy conversion efficiency than a TiCl4 treated photoanode.
Experimental
Synthesis of peroxotitanium solution (PTS)
Commercial titanium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) was dissolved in ice water with stirring to prepare a 0.0072 wt% TiCl4 aqueous solution. The titanium hydrate was precipitated by adding 3.2 wt% NH4OH aqueous solution dropwise into TiCl4 solution below 4 °C. Subsequently the precipitate was washed with deionized water repeatedly to remove the Cl− and NH4+ ions. Then the peroxotitanium solution was obtained by mixing the precipitate with excess 15 wt% H2O2 solution.
Electrodes preparation
The blocking layer was first deposited on the fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass (NSG, 8 Ω per square) by dipping each FTO substrate in 40 mM peroxotitanium solution or soaking FTO in 40 mM TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C.21 A 12 μm thick layer of 25 nm sized TiO2 particles (Degussa P25) was loaded on the FTO conducting glass by a screen printing technique. After sintering at 125 °C, the obtained layer was coated with a 4 μm thick scattering layer of 200 nm sized TiO2 particles (HEPTACHROMA, DHS-NanoT200) followed by sintering at 500 °C. Then the TiO2 film was coated with metal oxide by dipping each film in 35 mM PTS and another solution of a suitable precursor according to the literature11,14 followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. The TiCl4 treatment was carried by soaking FTO in 40 mM TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the whole TiO2 films were immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (v/v = 1/1) for 24 h. The Pt-electrode was prepared by drop-casting 0.5 mM H2PtCl6/ethanol solution on the clean FTO conductive glass. Subsequently, the FTO glass coated with Pt was sintered in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min.
Dye-sensitized solar cell assembly
DSSCs were assembled together with the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the counter electrode by a 25 μm thick hot-melt film (Surlyn 1702, DuPont) and sealed by heating. The cell internal space was filled with electrolyte using a vacuum pump. The liquid electrolyte is composed of 0.60 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.50 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate with acetonitrile as the solvent. The sealed DSSCs were used for the photocurrent–voltage tests with an active area of 0.25 cm2.
Characterization
The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010F, F20, 200 kV) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S4800). Surface binding elements were analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD). All binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak (284.8 eV) arising from surface hydrocarbons (or possible adventitious hydrocarbon). The crystal structure was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advanced Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation). The current–voltage tests of DSSCs were performed under one sun conditions using a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91160, AM 1.5 globe). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). The EIS experiment was performed in the dark by using an electrochemical workstation (Parstat 2273, Princeton). The frequency range of EIS experiments was from 100 kHz to 100 mHz with an AC modulation signal of 10 mV and bias DC voltage of 0.60 V. The curves were fitted by the Zview software. The diffuse-reflectance spectra were measured by using a Cary 500 spectrophotometer. The amount of adsorbed dye was measured by desorbing the dye into 10 mM NaOH solution and measuring the absorption peak intensity of N719 at 515 nm with a Cary 500 spectrophotometer.
Results and discussion
As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the colour of the super-pure peroxotitanium solution depends on the concentration of titanium complex which can be adjusted easily. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to reveal the surface characteristics of TiCl4 and PTS treated films as shown in Fig. 1(B–D). XPS samples were coated on glass substrates to obtain 50–100 nm thick films followed by sintering at 500 °C for 20 min. The oxidation state of the Ti element in both samples (Ti 2p3/2, binding energy 458.3 eV; Ti 2p1/2, binding energy 464.3 eV) is identical to that of bulk TiO2.22 No chlorine was detected in the PTS treated sample while the TiCl4-treated film shows a relatively intense Cl 2p3/2 peak at 199.4 eV, confirming the existence of abundant Ti–Cl bonds (Fig. 1C).23 Doped halide ions usually exist as defects or impurities leading to oxygen vacancies or trapping sites, and it might cause negative shifting of the valence band which might further intensify recombination and impede electrical conductivity.24 In addition to the lattice O 1s peak at 529.7 eV (Fig. 1D), a second peak appeared at 531.6 eV, which in turn verified the existence of terminated hydroxyl groups. However, the PTS overlayer displays a sharper OH peak implying more terminal hydroxyl groups on the surface. From the XPS results, it can be concluded that the atomic incorporation of Cl or their substitution for terminal hydroxyl groups on the surface might reduce the dye absorption and further result in the formation of rutile during heat treatment (Fig. S6†).8,25 Compared with anatase, rutile shows insufficient photocatalytic performance for its narrow bandgap (3.0 eV vs. 3.2 eV for anatase) and a lower conduction band edge energy.8 Moreover, a powerful oxidant, O22− from hydrogen peroxide, could decrease oxygen vacancies and defects and thus the recombination of DSSCs would be minimized.26 For comparison, several types of TiO2 working electrodes were prepared and the abbreviation “N–TiCl4” indicates the sample that only employed the TiCl4 overlayer on the whole TiO2 film and no blocking layer was applied.

Fig. 2(A and B) shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the TiO2 layers deposited on the FTO substrate by the TiCl4 method and the PTS method, respectively. Generally, a TiO2 blocking layer could prevent back reaction of electrons from tri-iodide ions on the FTO and electrolyte interface.27 Recently, Frank et al. claimed that recombination occurs predominantly near the FTO substrate by the intensity-modulated infrared spectroscopy (IMIS) analysis.5 As depicted in Fig. 2A, for the TiO2 thin overlayer generated by the TiCl4 method, TiO2 particles about 10 nm can be observed on the FTO surface. Nevertheless, aggregated chunky grains even larger than 30 nm were also formed. By comparison, the PTS overlayer coated on the FTO substrate is compact and homogeneous in Fig. 2B.

In order to examine the uniformity and thickness of TiCl4 and PTS overlayers on the whole photoanode further, a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) was employed, as shown in Fig. 2(C–F). After the growth of overlayers, samples were removed from the glass substrates, ground and deposited on the TEM grid. The TiCl4 overlayer is very thin and TiO2 nanoparticles with a size around 7 nm can be occasionally found (Fig. 2E). The PTS overlayer is quite uniform with an average thickness of 2–3 nm (Fig. 2D and F). The HRTEM image in Fig. 2E shows that TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of photoanode have a lattice spacing of ca. 3.24 Å, corresponding to the (110) planes of rutile TiO2; this indicates that chloride ions would contribute to the formation of rutile nanoparticles on the bulk surface during the annealing step. The formation of rutile nanoparticles by the TiCl4 method can also be supported by the X-ray diffraction results (Fig. S6†). Besides, the Raman peaks around 142, 394, 512 and 634 cm−1 in Fig. S3† can be assigned to bulk anatase TiO2. Meanwhile, the HRTEM image in Fig. 2F displays the compact and uniform amorphous PTS coating on the surface and the inner lattice spacing of ca. 1.89 Å is attributed to (200) or (020) planes of anatase TiO2. Based on these structural analyses, it can be concluded that the PTS polymerization process can generate a condensed and uniform amorphous TiO2 overlayer which is totally different from that of the TiCl4 method.
Regarding the compact structure obtained, a detailed mechanistic analysis of the reaction process was carried out. It has been demonstrated that the PTS (3 < pH < 9) species has a dinuclear structure by deprotonation of water molecules coordinated to the central Ti2O52+ group through an alkalimetric titration method.20,28,29 Due to the stability of peroxotitanium chelates, the dinuclear structure of PTS contains two titanium atoms connected with a bridge oxygen bond and two peroxy bonds. Therefore, if pH > 3, the PTS complexes have a structure of Ti2O5(OH)x(2−x)+(H2O)y (x > 2) or Ti2O5(OH)2(H2O)y. If coordinated water is neglected and we assume x = 2, μ-hydroxy bridges between bulk TiO2 surface and metal atoms will be generated with the evaporation of H2O molecules, resulting in the gradual polymerization on the surface (Scheme 1A). At the same time, vertical and horizontal olation can occur simultaneously (Scheme 1B and C), which leads to gelation of the homogeneous (Ti2O5)x(OH)y(H2O)z 3-D network linked by bridging oxygen, peroxo group and μ-hydroxy bridges.20 The O22− in dried (at 60 °C) PTS was confirmed by the Raman active vibration band at 910.9 cm−1 (O–O stretching).28,30 Thermogravimetry (TG) analysis indicates a 29.61% weight loss when the dried PTS was heat-treated to 600 °C and thus the plausible monomer structure is Ti2O5(OH)3 or Ti2O5(OH)2·H2O. Water contents of both monomers approximately match with the TG results. Compared with PTS polymerization mechanism, for TiCl4 hydrolysis, discrete Ti4+ can react with water easily to liberate protons and produce hydroxyl or oxy species. Further oxalation or olation followed by annealing without gelation will lead to formation of the incompact layer and rutile nanoparticles on the surface.31 However, the loss of dye loading on PTS surface is not observed in Fig. S4.†

To confirm the performance of PTS overlayers, the as-prepared PTS was applied to fabricate DSSCs with a standard process. The cell without the twice coating (N–N cell) displays an energy conversion efficiency (η) of 5.68%, while the cell twice coated with a TiCl4 layer (TiCl4–TiCl4 cell) shows an efficiency of 6.75%, 18.8% enhancement compared to the N–N cell as indicated in the I–V characteristic curve (Fig. 3B). Further, the cell twice treated with PTS (PTS–PTS cell) reached the highest conversion efficiency of 7.33%, achieving a surprising 29.0% enhancement compared to the N–N cell.

According to the literature,32 the major effect of the blocking layer is to hamper the back reaction rate near the FTO substrate and can be characterised by dark current–voltage characteristics curves. From I–V measurement of DSSCs without or with different blocking layers on the FTO substrate in the dark state (Fig. 3A), the onset of dark current DSSC without blocking layer occurred at a low forward bias. After introducing the TiO2 blocking layer on the substrate, the dark current has been suppressed and the onset has been shifted by several hundred millivolts, suggesting that the dark current derived from reduction of I3− at the FTO/electrolyte interface has been inhibited.32 It also can be seen that DSSCs with PTS blocking layer display lower dark current than the DSSC TiCl4 blocking layer, demonstrating the better blocking ability of the PTS blocking layer. Furthermore, the cell twice treated with PTS (PTS–PTS cell) has the lowest dark current, indicating the low recombination loss of the whole photoanode which is in agreement with the Jsc and η values.
To further explore the electron transporting behavior of DSSCs with different block layers and overlayers on the whole photoanode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed as shown in Fig. 4. The equivalent circuit used to fit the experimental EIS data is shown in the inset of Fig. 4.11,33–35 The influence of the blocking layer is investigated firstly in Fig. 4A. The series resistance (Rs) is mainly related to the resistance of the FTO glass substrate, the contact resistance of the cell and the resistance of external circuits. The cells showed similar Rs values related to the same FTO substrate and the same external circuits. The semicircle in the high frequency region (R1) corresponds to the interfacial resistance of the TiO2/FTO substrate and Pt/electrolyte.33,35,36 Due to the identical Pt electrode, the values of R1 which vary in the sequence N–N (8.8 Ω) > TiCl4–N (8.6 Ω) > PTS–N (8.1 Ω) are ascribed to the different blocking layers, in accordance with the inference from the morphology that the PTS blocking layer could induce excellent contact between the interface of FTO substrate/TiO2 photoanode. The semicircle in the intermediate frequency semicircle (R2) represents the dye-absorbed TiO2/electrolyte interface and charge transport resistance in the TiO2 film. R2 decreases in the order N–N (39.9 Ω) > TiCl4–N (27.5 Ω) > PTS–N (24.8 Ω) which can be attributed to the improved adhesion between FTO substrate and TiO2 film. Together with the polymerization mechanism discussion, these results are entirely consistent with the SEM analysis of the compact structure. Therefore, the highest Jsc value (Table 1) of the PTS–N cell is reasonable, giving rise to the good conversion efficiency of 6.31% which is greater than the values of 5.68% and 6.13% of the N–N cell and N–TiCl4 cell, respectively. On the whole, the electrochemical impedance spectra of N–N, TiCl4–TiCl4, PTS–PTS cells show the same trends in Fig. S8† which is in agreement with the Jsc and η values.

In this part, the effect of overlayers on the whole photoanode is considered and the results are shown in Fig. 4B. The semicircular curve obtained in the intermediate-frequency regimes mainly represents the resistance of the treated TiO2 photoanode (R2).34 The radius of the intermediate frequency semicircle increases in the order of N–N (39.9 Ω) < N–TiCl4 (13.9 Ω) < N–PTS (12.6 Ω), confirming the low electrical resistance and superior linking function between the nanoparticles of PTS ultrathin compact overlayer, which is in agreement with the trend of Jsc values (Table 1). Eventually, DSSCs with the second PTS treatment yield an overall energy conversion efficiency of 6.51%, compared with values of 5.68% and 6.42% for N–N and N–TiCl4, respectively. In addition, the commonly employed Nb2O5, Al2O3, SiO2 and ZrO2 overlayers were also investigated as shown in Table 1, displaying insufficiently enhanced or even reduced efficiency of these overlayers. Nb2O5 could reach an overall energy conversion efficiency of merely 5.74%, while the efficiencies of Al2O3, SiO2 and ZrO2 treated DSSCs dropped even lower than that of the N–N cell. The main reason is its insulating properties which match with the Jsc values, while the TiO2 coating could improve the electrical conductivity and slow charge recombination.
Conclusions
In summary, uniform and condense nanostructured TiO2 thin overlayers were successfully deposited onto a FTO substrate and a nanocrystalline TiO2 film applying a new PTS hydrolysis mechanism. Through the peroxo route, extra chloride ions which would substitute for terminal OH groups on the surface and act as defects or impurities in the lattice, could be mostly avoided. Furthermore, during the evaporation process of water molecules, molecule level blending could be entirely achieved and the dinuclear monomer would polymerize on the bulk TiO2 surface as well as in the vertical direction and horizontal direction simultaneously. Thus, by simple dip coating, the polymerization process of PTS can generate the homogeneous Ti–O network which enhances the energy conversion efficiency significantly.
