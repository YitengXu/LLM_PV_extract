    , Accepted 8th August 2020First published on 21st August 2020AbstractThe geometric structure, electronic, optical and photocatalytic properties of MSSe–g-GaN (M = Mo, W) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are investigated by performing first-principles calculations. We find that the MoSSe–g-GaN heterostructure exhibits type-II band alignment for all stacking patterns. While the WSSe–g-GaN heterostructure forms the type-II or type-I band alignment for the stacking model-I or model II, respectively. The average electrostatic potential shows that the potential of g-GaN is deeper than the MSSe monolayer, leading to the formation of an electrostatic field across the interface, causing the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. Efficient interfacial formation of interface and charge transfer reduce the work function of MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures as compared to the constituent monolayer. The difference in the carrier mobility for electrons and holes suggests that these heterostructures could be utilized for hole/electron separation. Absorption spectra demonstrate that strong absorption from infrared to visible light in these vdW heterostructures can be achieved. Appropriate valence and conduction band edge positions with standard redox potentials provide enough force to drive the photogenerated electrons and holes to dissociate water into H+/H2 and O2/H2O at pH = 0.
1 Introduction
Recently, a new class of intriguing two-dimensional (2D) materials with general formula MXY (M = Mo, W; X/Y = S, Se, Te), namely Janus monolayers, has been successfully synthesized by chemical vapor deposition of Se in MoS21 and S in MoSe2.2 Furthermore, using density functional theory (DFT), Zhang et al.2 proved that the electronic structures and Raman vibration modes of the Janus MoSSe monolayer are found to correlate well with experimental measurements. Using DFT calculations, Tao et al.3 demonstrated that the electronic properties, Zeeman-type spin splitting and valley polarization of Janus MXY monolayers are found to be well preserved like their parent (MX2) phases. Moreover, a Rashba spin splitting around the Γ-point was also observed in these Janus monolayers, making them promising candidates for future spintronics. Xia et al.4 showed that the induced dipole moment, vibrational frequency, Rashba parameters, and direct to indirect band gap transition in Janus MXY (M = Mo, W; X/Y = S, Se, Te) monolayers are associated with the atomic radius and electronegativity differences of the chalcogen X/Y atoms.
Similar to the parent (MX2) phases,5–7 the high recombination ratio and short life time of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in Janus MXY monolayers would also hinder their practical applications. To control this issue and further tune the properties of the 2D materials, layer stacking in the form of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is used intensively for designing viable electronic products.8–12 In vdW heterostructure with type-II band alignment,13 both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of one layer are lower than the corresponding VBM and CBM of the other one, hence, electrons and holes migrate from one layer to the other. Therefore, the unwanted combination of photogenerated carriers is avoided, which significantly increases their life time.14
Very recently, Idrees et al.15 theoretically predicted that Janus vdW heterostructures of MoSSe–WSSe, MoSeTe–WSeTe and MoSTe–WSTe are indirect band gap semiconductors with type-II band alignment. In addition, they found that the external electric field and tensile strain can transform some of the above mentioned vdW heterostructures from an indirect to a direct band gap. A strong device absorption efficiency of about 80–90% is observed for Janus WSeTe, MoSTe and WSTe monolayers in the visible, infrared and ultraviolet regions, whereas energetically favorable band edge positions make the MoSSe–WSSe heterostructure a promising candidate for water splitting. Recently, a direct type-II band alignment and considerable Rashba spin splitting in GeC–MSSe (M = Mo, W) vdW heterostructures have been shown to provide a platform for experimental and theoretical understanding of spintronic devices based on 2D materials.16 More interestingly, appropriate band alignments with the standard water redox potentials enable these heterostructures to dissociate water into H+/H2 and O2/H2O.
Currently, graphene-like gallium nitride (g-GaN) has been successfully fabricated through migration-enhanced encapsulated-growth.17 The g-GaN monolayer has a band gap of 2.158/4.0 eV calculated using the DFT/G0W0 method.18,19 The electronic properties of g-GaN can further be modified by adsorption, doping and elastic strain20 and van der Waals heterostructures.21–23 Among these, the formation of van der Waals heterostructures by combining different 2D materials has been proved to be one of the most effective approaches to modify and enhance the electronic and optical properties and photocatalytic performance of the GaN monolayer. For instance, Sun and his co-authors21 demonstrated that the type-II vdW heterostructure of g-GaN and Blue phosphorene (BlueP) suggests a promising application as a photocatalyst. Wang et al.22 demonstrated that integrating two-dimensional MoS2 on the GaN surface into vdW heterostructures can create the possibility to induce novel electronic and optical properties of the GaN monolayer. All these studies predicted that the formation of vdW heterostructures between GaN and other 2D materials exhibits excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties and great potential in optoelectronics and photovoltaics.
Therefore, in this paper, we present the unusual properties of MSSe–g-GaN (M = Mo, W) vdW heterostructures using DFT calculations in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.24–28 Furthermore, Ab initio molecular dynamics (AMD)29,30 simulations are used to check the thermal stability of these systems. Two different models with alternative chalcogen atoms having four possible stacking configurations of vdW heterostructures are constructed. Our study reveals that all the MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures for both models are energetically stable and are direct band gap semiconductors with type-II band alignment. Furthermore, the Bader charge analysis, planar and average electrostatic potentials, carrier transfer capacity, work function, and optical and photocatalytic response of all these materials are also investigated. Our findings suggest that MSSe–g-GaN (M = Mo, W) vdW heterostructures could be a potential candidate for optoelectronic, photovoltaic and photocatalysis devices.
2 Computational details
All the structural relaxation and electronic property calculations of the MSSe, GaN monolayers and their corresponding heterostructures are performed in the framework of the DFT method using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package24–28 within the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function is selected to describe the exchange and correlation energy. The traditional DFT-PBE method underestimates the band gap values of materials, especially semiconducting 2D materials, and thus, we opt to use the hybrid functional HSE06 to overcome this issue. Furthermore, the weak interactions that always occur in the layered materials are described by using the Grimme DFT-D2 method. For plane wave basis we set a cutoff energy to 410 eV with the convergence of energy and force of 10−6 eV Å−1 and 10−4 eV, respectively. To eliminate unphysical interactions of materials, we use a large vacuum thickness of 25 Å along the z direction. A 9 × 9 × 1 k-mesh is used to sample the first Brillouin zone integration.
The optical characteristics of the constituent monolayers and their heterostructures are calculated using the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) on top of single-shot G0W0 calculations as follows: (1)where, c and v are the CBM and VBM of the materials, respectively. uck presents the cell periodic part of the wavefunctions.
3 Results and discussion
We first check the lattice parameters of MoSSe, WSSe and g-GaN monolayers, which are calculated to be 3.25 Å, 3.26 Å, and 3.25 Å. These results agree well with previous reports,15,16,31 indicating the reliability of our computational approach. Schematic top (side) view and band structures of MoSSe, WSSe and g-GaN monolayers are presented in Fig. 1. One can observe from Fig. 1 that both MoSSe and WSSe monolayers exhibit direct band gap semiconduction with band gaps of 2.24 eV and 2.16 eV, respectively. Both the VBM and CBM of the semiconducting MoSSe and WSSe monolayer are located at the K point. In contrast, g-GaN is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 3.2 eV, formed between the VBM at the K point and the CBM at the Γ point. All these results are in good agreement with previous reports.15,19,31

Red, cyan, yellow and green balls stand for Mo, W, S and Se atoms, respectively. Dark blue and light blue balls represent the Ga and N atoms, respectively. 
Hexagonal MoSSe, WSSe and g-GaN monolayers as depicted in Fig. 1 display satisfying lattice mismatches, hence realizing the possible experimental fabrication of MSSe–g-GaN (M = Mo, W) vdW heterostructures for practical applications. In general, local configurations and specific contacted atoms significantly modulate the properties of the vdW heterostructure; therefore, we considered four possible staking layers in two different models with alternate positions of S/Se atoms at opposite surfaces of MSSe in MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In model-I, stacking (I), a Mo/W atom is placed on top of a N atom while a S/Se atom is on top of a Ga; stacking (II), a Mo/W atom is placed on top of a Ga atom while a S/Se atom is on top of a N atom; stacking (III), a Mo/W atom is placed on top of a Ga atom while a N atom is centered at the hexagonal ring; stacking (IV), a Mo/W atom is placed on top of a N atom while a Ga atom is centered at a hexagonal ring. All these stacking patterns of the MSSe–g-GaN heterostructures are illustrated in Fig. S1 of ESI.† We have also relaxed all the similar stacking sequences in model-II as discussed. Favorable stacking patterns are obtained by means of the binding energy and interlayer distance.

The binding energy is given by,32,33Eb = EMSSe–g-GaN − EMSSe − Eg-GaN, where EMSSe–g-GaN represents the total energy of the MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructure. EMSSe and Eg-GaN are the total energies of isolated MSSe (M = Mo, W) and g-GaN monolayers, respectively. Based on this definition, our calculated binding energy/interlayer distance of MoSSe–g-GaN (WSSe–g-GaN) for model-I and model-II is −0.48 eV/3.0 Å (−0.35 eV/2.95 Å) and −0.41 eV/3.02 Å (−0.32 eV/3.05 Å), respectively. In addition, both the interlayer distance and binding energy of the MSSe–g-GaN heterostructures for all stacking configurations are listed in Table S1 of ESI.† One can find from Fig. S1 of the ESI† that the stacking IV configuration of the MSSe–g-GaN heterostructure have the shortest interlayer distance and the lowest binding energy as compared to other stacking configurations. These results suggest that stacking (IV) is the most favorable stacking configuration. Furthermore, these values are comparable with those in other vdW heterostructures,15,16 demonstrating that all these heterostructures are characterized by weak vdW forces. In addition, the thermal stability of these heterostructures is also confirmed by performing AIMD simulations through the Nose-thermostat algorithm at room temperature of 300 K for 3 ps. We find that MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures retain their geometries without any structural distortion, as depicted in Fig. 2.
Using PBE27 and HSE0628 methods, the band structures of MSSe–g-GaN (M = Mo, W) vdW heterostructures in model-I and model-II are presented in Fig. 3. Interestingly, MSSe–g-GaN heterostructures in both model-I, and model-II have direct band gaps with the VBM and CBM located at the K-point of BZ, while corresponding monolayer g-GaN(MSSe) is an indirect(direct) band gap semiconductor. The PBE band gap value in model-I/model-II of MoSSe–g-GaN is 1.07/1.05 eV and of WSSe–g-GaN is 1.36/1.71 eV, while the HSE06 band gap value is 2.0/1.8 eV and 2.14/2.39 eV, respectively. It is obvious that a considerable difference is observed in the position of the CBM, while there is a minor difference in the position of the VBM. A similar trend was also observed in the Janus MoSTe monolayer.34 To gain deep insight into the band alignment, the weighted band structures of MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures are calculated using the HSE06 method and presented in Fig. 4. It is obvious that the N-pz orbital of the g-GaN monolayer contributes to the VBM, while the Mo-dz2 of MoSSe and W-dz2 of WSSe layers contribute to the CBM of MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures for both stacking models. The Mo(W)-dxy, Mo(W)-dyz and Mo(W)-dxz orbitals do not participate in the band edges of the heterostructures due to the strong coupling with Ga-p orbitals, hence generating a significant split at bonding and anti-bonding states. The contributions from different layers to the VBM and CBM of the MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructure for both models confirm the formation of the type-II band alignment, which is similar to the MoS2/SnO2,35 CP/SiN and CAs/GeN heterostructures.36 Effectively separated photogenerated carriers in type-II heterostructures indicate prominent applications of these vdW heterostructures in solar energy conversion, light emitting diodes and laser devices.37–39 Furthermore, one can observe from Fig. 4(b) that the WSSe–g-GaN heterostructure for model-I exhibits type-II band alignment. The CBM of WSSe–g-GaN for model-I comes from the WSSe layer, whereas its VBM comes from the g-GaN layer, confirming the formation of type-II band alignment. Whereas, model-II of the WSSe–g-GaN heterostructure shows the type-I band alignment, as illustrated in Fig. 4(d). Both the CBM and VBM of such stacking configuration come from the WSSe layer, thus demonstrating the type-I band alignment.

Charge density differences (CDDs) are investigated to get a qualitative understanding of the charge transfer in the MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures, as depicted in Fig. 5. The CDD is obtained by: Δρ = ρMSSe–g-GaN − ρMSSe − ρg-GaN, where ρMSSe–g-GaN, ρMSSe and ρg-GaN represent the charge densities of the heterostructures, isolated MSSe and g-GaN monolayers, respectively. One can observe from Fig. 5 that the g-GaN layer donates electrons to MSSe (M = Mo, W) layers for both models, resulting in the formation of p-doping type in the g-GaN monolayer and n-doping type in the Janus monolayers. Bader charge analysis40 shows that for model-I (model-II) about 0.017 (0.015) electrons are transferred from the g-GaN layer to the MoSSe layer in the MoSSe–g-GaN heterostructure, while 0.023 (0.019) electrons are transferred from the g-GaN layer to the WSSe layer in the WSSe–g-GaN heterostructure. These values are comparable with those of our previous vdW heterostructures.15,16

Consequently, the excitonic behavior of MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures can be quite different from that of the isolated MSSe and g-GaN layer, as the gradient of the potential across the interface may facilitate the separation of electrons and holes.41 The average electrostatic potential shows that the g-GaN layer has a deeper potential than the MSSe monolayers, as illustrated in Fig. 6, forming an electrostatic field across the interface and leading to the charge transfer from g-GaN to Janus monolayers. The potential drops between MoSSe (WSSe) and g-GaN layers are found to be 5.23 (4.80) eV for MoSSe–g-GaN and 4.89 (4.51) eV for WSSe–g-GaN, respectively, for model-I (model-II). These values show strong potential drops in MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures, leading to a strong electrostatic field across the heterojunction, which has an effect on the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. It will also make the difference in excitonic behavior between the MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructure and the constituent MSSe and g-GaN monolayers. These findings help to facilitates electron and hole separation across the interface.42

The transfers of electrons are also confirmed by the planar electrostatic potential, calculated by integrating the in-plane CDD from the formula , as illustrated in Fig. 7. In this equation, ρHetero(x,y,z) is the charge density at the point (x,y,z) in the MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures, ρMSSe(x,y,z) represents the charge density at the point (x,y,z) in the MSSe monolayer, and ρg-GaN(x,y,z) represents the charge density at the point (x,y,z) in the g-GaN monolayer. The amount of charge transfers along the z direction is calculated by . It is clear from Fig. 7 that the g-GaN layer donates electrons to the MSSe layers, making the g-GaN p-doping, while the MSSe monolayer n-doping.

Furthermore, it is interesting that the energy required to remove an electron from the Fermi level is the work function Φ, which can affect the properties of materials and improve the performance in solar cells. Φ can easily have an effect on the surface condition of a material, hence altering the surface electric field induced by the distribution of electrons at the interface.43 The calculated values of Φ along the z direction44 are 1.45 (1.29) eV for MoSSe–g-GaN and 1.56 (1.52) eV for WSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures for model-I (model-II). Moreover, the work function of MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures is smaller than that of the constituent MSSe and g-GaN monolayers. The nature of such a decrease is due to the efficient interfacial formation and charge transfer.15,45,46 In addition, we find that the work function of g-GaN is higher than that of MSSe monolayers, and hence MSSe will be negatively charged, while g-GaN will be positively charged due to the high electrostatic induction which enhances the power conversion efficiency.
Using deformation potential (DP) theory, the carrier mobility (μ) of MSSe, g-GaN monolayers and MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures is calculated:47μ2D = eħ3C2D/κBT|m*|E12, where e is the electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, κB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the room temperature of 300 K, m* is the effective mass, E1 is the deformation potential constant and C2D is the in-plane stiffness. Electron and hole effective masses of MSSe, g-GaN monolayers and MSSe–g-Gan vdW heterostructures are calculated by m* = ħ2(∂2E(k)/∂k2)−1. Interestingly, the effective mass of electrons is much smaller than that of holes, as listed in Table 1, indicating the easy drift of electrons towards holes. The in-plane stiffness (C2D) of MSSe, g-GaN monolayers and MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures is calculated by: C2D = [∂2E/∂δ2]/S0, where S0 is the surface area of MSSe and gGaN monolayers and MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures, respectively. The high carrier mobility of MSSe and g-GaN monolayers and MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures demonstrates that these monolayers and vdW heterostructures have promising prospects in optoelectronic devices.48–51 The difference in the carrier mobility of electrons and holes suggests that these heterostructures can be utilized for hole/electron separation.11

We further calculate the imaginary part of the dielectric function (ε2(ω)) of MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation, as depicted in Fig. 8. It is obvious that the optical transitions are dominated by excitons. In model-I, excitonic peaks are observed in the range of 1.70 eV (729 nm) for MoSSe–g-GaN, and at 1.50 eV (826 nm) for WSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures, while in model-II these peaks are observed at 1.78 eV (695 nm) for MoSSe–g-GaN, and at 1.56 eV (794 nm) for WSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures. The difference in the positions of these peaks with respect to ref. 15 and 16 is due to the stacking of g-GaN with MSSe. Moreover, Fig. 8 also shows a systematic blue shift in the position of the excitonic peaks by changing a Mo atom with a W atom in the corresponding models. The exciton binding energies in model-I (model-II) are 0.40 (0.32) eV for MoSSe–g-GaN and 0.70 (0.64) eV for WSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures. It is also clear that the excitonic peaks are followed by the optical transition in the visible range, revealing a use for designing efficient optoelectronic devices52–54 and photocatalysts.41

The reduction/oxidation ability could be evaluated by the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) edges with respect to the water redox potential levels. Using the Mulliken electronegativity,55,56 the valence band is calculated by: EVBM = χ − Eelec + 0.5Eg and the conduction band: ECBM = EVBM − Eg at pH = 0 and pH = 7. These results are depicted in Fig. 9. EVBM and ECBM are the valence and conduction band edge potentials, χ represents the geometric mean of the Mulliken electronegativity of MSSe and g-GaN atoms and Eelec is the standard electrode potential on hydrogen scale with a value of −4.5 eV, while Eg is the calculated band gap. χ can be calculated by the geometric mean of electron affinity and first ionization potential of the corresponding atoms in the MSSe and g-GaN monolayers. For pH = 7, we used the Nernst equation:57–59EpH = EpH=0 − 0.059 × pH, where EpH = 0 is the value of the redox potential at pH = 0 and pH is the value of the redox potential.

The higher positions of VB and CB compared to those in standard redox potentials provides enough force to drive the photogenerated electrons and holes to dissociate water into H+/H2 and O2/H2O, thus making MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures promising for water splitting at pH = 0. For pH = 7, all MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures show a good response for photocatalytic water splitting, except for MoSSe–g-GaN in model-II, which fails to reduced water to O2. We predict that MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures for both models at pH = 0 are good for photocatalytic water splitting, suggesting that they are promising for low-cost and large-scale production of solar hydrogen. Similar results are also demonstrated for SiC–TMDCs, TMDCs–TMDCs and GeC–MSSe vdW heterostructures.15,16
4 Conclusions
In summary, we have used DFT calculations to investigate the structural, electronic, optical, and photocatalytic properties of MSSe–g-GaN (M = Mo, W) vdW heterostructures. Stacking orders of minimal energy have been determined in model-I and model-II of MSSe–g-GaN heterostructures, which show direct band gaps with type-II band alignment. The charge density difference and Bader charge show that for model-I (model-II) about 0.017 (0.015) electrons are transferred from the g-GaN layer to the MoSSe layer, while 0.023 (0.019) electrons are transferred from the g-GaN layer to the WSSe layer. The average electrostatic potential shows that the g-GaN layer has a deeper potential than the MSSe monolayers, increasing a strong electrostatic field across the interface, leading to the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. Efficient interfacial formation of interface and charge transfer reduce the work function of MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures. Hole and electron carrier mobility differences suggest that these heterostructures can be utilized for hole/electron separation. High carrier mobility in MSSe and g-GaN monolayers and MSSe–g-GaN vdW heterostructures demonstrates that these monolayers and heterostructures are promising for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices. Absorption spectra show that optical absorption is dominated by excitons, while strong absorption from infrared to visible light in these vdW heterostructures can be achieved. Appropriate valence and conduction band edges with standard redox potentials provide enough force to drive the photogenerated electrons and holes to dissociate water into H+/H2 and O2/H2O, thus making MSSe–g-GaN (M = Mo, W) vdW heterostructures promising for photocatalytic water splitting at pH = 0, while MoSSe–g-GaN in model-II fails to reduce water at pH = 7.
