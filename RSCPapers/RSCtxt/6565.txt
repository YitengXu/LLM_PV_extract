    , Accepted 20th April 2021First published on 20th April 2021AbstractTo understand the consequence of an Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction simply, we fabricated an FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 composite photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. We discovered that forming a heterojunction between the Fe2O3 underlayer and BiVO4 upper layer dramatically increased the photocurrent in the low bias region. This photocurrent density increased six-fold from 0.15 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for BiVO4 to 0.95 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE for BiVO4 with the Fe2O3 underlayer. The faradaic efficiency of PEC water splitting was close to 100%, and the molar ratio of the generated hydrogen to oxygen was 2:1. However, the photocurrent did not improve in the high bias region; at higher than 1.23 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent density of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 electrode was lower than that of the bare BiVO4 electrode. The effects of the Fe2O3 underlayer greatly improved the charge separation efficiency, but such improvements were noted only in the low bias region. In addition, the PEC performance was observed to depend on the thickness of the Fe2O3 underlayer. The optimised FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 electrode was achieved when the Fe2O3 underlayer was approximately 350 nm thick and when the BiVO4 upper layer had approximately the same thickness as the underlayer.
Introduction
Recently, decarbonisation energy technologies utilising hydrogen energy have been in great demand. Solar-driven water splitting has been extensively investigated for generating hydrogen using semiconductor catalysts/electrodes. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is considered as one such strategy because it facilitates the generation and collection of pure gases. In PEC systems, hydrogen is produced at the p-type and oxygen is produced at the n-type semiconductor electrodes. The most propulsive candidate n-type material is a bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode because of its band potentials and band gap. BiVO4 has a band gap of 2.4 eV that absorbs visible light to provide high conversion efficiency. The edge of its conduction band is close to the thermodynamic hydrogen production potential that allows water oxidation to occur at a moderate external bias potential. Since the first report on using BiVO4 as a photocatalyst for water oxidation by Kudo et al.1,2 in 1998, remarkable progress has been achieved with the development of BiVO4 photoanodes with regard to PEC water oxidation performance and durability.3,4 It is well known that BiVO4 photocurrent is limited primarily by surface recombination.5 Loading a co-catalyst, such as cobalt phosphate complexes,6 cobalt oxide,7 iron oxyhydroxide,8 NiFe-(oxy)hydroxide,9 or a double layer of FeOOH–NiOOH4 on the surface of a photoanode can enhance the dynamics of water oxidation reactions. A characteristic of the co-catalytic effect is that the onset potential of the photocurrent-density–potential (J–V) curve shifts significantly toward cathodic potentials. Nanosizing and morphological control are effective at eliminating the shortcomings of BiVO4. The formation of heterojunctions of ZnO/BiVO4,10 WO3/BiVO4,11–14 WO3/SnO2/BiVO4,15 SnO2/WO3/BiVO4,16 and SnO2/BiVO417 have been shown to be highly effective for separating carriers and improving conductivity. Moreover, ZnO, WO3 and SnO2 can function as a hole-blocking layers.
Haematite (α-Fe2O3) is also considered a promising candidate for solar-driven water oxidation under visible light and has a band gap of around 1.9–2.2 eV. Its flat band potential (Efb) was estimated via Mott–Schottky plots to be 0.5–0.6 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).18–21 However, the Efb value of BiVO4 is ca. 0–0.1 V vs. RHE.22–26 Hence, a heterojunction can be constructed for water oxidation between an Fe2O3 underlayer and a BiVO4 upper layer on an FTO substrate. Since 2009, many FTO/WO3/BiVO4 anodes have been reported for solar-driven water splitting.11 The flat band potential of WO3 is ca. 0.3–0.5 V vs. RHE.27–29 This is similar to the flat band potential of Fe2O3, where the excited photoelectrons move from the conduction band of BiVO4 to Fe2O3, and the holes simultaneously move from the valence band of Fe2O3 to the surface of BiVO4 to oxidise water. The Fe2O3 anode absorbs visible light up to longer wavelengths than the WO3 anode. The theoretical maximum photocurrent densities of WO3 and Fe2O3 anodes are 3.9 mA cm−2 and 12.6 mA cm−2 respectively at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 1 sun light irradiation.30 Furthermore, WO3 is stable in acidic electrolyte solutions, whereas Fe2O3 and BiVO4 are stable in alkaline to neutral solutions. Inevitably, by replacing the underlayer WO3 with Fe2O3, the Fe2O3/BiVO4 electrode can be expected to have an even higher photocurrent. However, the hole diffusion (2–4 nm) and carrier mobility (0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) of Fe2O3 are more sluggish than those of WO3, which are 150–500 nm and 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively.31 Therefore, we predicted that the effects of Fe2O3 on BiVO4 would be different from those of WO3.
There are very few reported studies on heterojunction formation between Fe2O3 and BiVO4 for PEC water splitting. Feng et al. reported an FTO/graphene modified Fe2O3/Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanode that had excellent heterojunction effects for improving the separation of photogenerated carriers.32 FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4/NiFe-LDH photoanodes prepared at high temperatures (600 °C and above) were reported to be effective for PEC water oxidation owing to the Fe2O3/BiVO4 n–n heterojunction and NiFe-LDH co-catalyst.33 Recently, it was reported that an FTO/phosphorus-doped Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction treated at 700 °C contributed to expedited electron and hole transfers and reduced carrier recombinations.34 Furthermore, high temperature (over 700 °C)35 treatment is an important factor for the photoactivity of the Fe2O3 film since tin oxide from the FTO substrate can migrate and be incorporated as a dopant into haematite during sintering.
The studies reported thus far have not investigated the effects of the thickness of each layer of the photoelectrode or those of the heterojunction, dopant, and surface co-catalyst separately. Therefore, it is important to quantify the contribution of each process to comprehend the total reaction for further development. Although the dopant and surface co-catalyst effects can be investigated even with a single-layer photoelectrode, it is an important task to clarify the heterojunction effects of a composite material photoelectrode. To identify the roles of the band potentials, we demonstrated PEC property measurements using a photoanode combining a pure Fe2O3 underlayer and a pure BiVO4 upper layer without doping. This can be used to understand the impact of the photogenerated carrier behaviours on the Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction simply. The purpose of this study is to not just obtain high photocurrents but also understand the effects of the pure Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction. We observed that the photocurrent of the BiVO4 photoanode with the Fe2O3 underlayer increased extraordinarily in the low bias region. However, in the high bias region, the photocurrent was lower than that of the bare BiVO4 photoanode; it is believed that the film thickness affects the charge mobility and separation efficiency. Herein, we discuss the photoactivity enhancement by an unmodulated Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction in detail, while focusing on the film thickness of the Fe2O3 underlayer for PEC performance. Since the surface recombination reaction of the BiVO4 photoanode is valuable information, we also discuss the effects of surface modification with co-catalysts and hole scavengers.
Experimental
Film preparation
The FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 films were prepared by electrochemical deposition using a two-electrode configuration cell. A 2 cm2 platinum gauze was used as the counter electrode, and a potentiostat/galvanostat analyser (Admiral Instruments, Squidstat™ Plus) was used for electrodeposition. First, nanoparticle α-Fe2O3 films (area of approximately 1.0 cm × 1.3 cm) were fabricated on a conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate (FTO, <15 ohm per sq., FTO-P003, Kavio). The electrochemical position bath was a 50 mL aqueous solution containing 0.1988 g iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O, Sigma Aldrich). The anodic deposition was carried out in galvanostatic mode at 65 °C. Iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) films were deposited at a constant current density of +0.2 mA cm−2 with varying deposition durations (5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min). After the deposition of each FeOOH film, it was rinsed with deionised water and dried in air. To obtain crystalline α-Fe2O3, the as-deposited FeOOH films were annealed in air for 5 h at 500 °C (ramping rate = 5 °C min−1).21
The BiVO4 layer was deposited atop the Fe2O3 film using the same two-electrode configuration cell setup. This BiVO4 synthesis method is a two-step electrochemical procedure.36 The first step electrodeposition bath involved an aqueous solution of 30 mL containing 0.0075 M bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Alfa Aesar) and 0.4 M potassium iodide (KI, Tianjin Zhiyuan Reagent Co. Ltd.), with the pH adjusted to 1.2 using nitric acid (HNO3, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent). Then, about 20 mL of ethanol containing 0.15 M p-benzoquinone (C6H4O2, Aladdin) was added slowly into the solution containing the Bi3+ species. The mixed solution was stirred overnight until a stable pH of 3.6–4.0 was achieved. Two-dimensional crystal bismuth iodide oxide (BiOI) flakes were deposited at a constant bias of −0.3 V vs. Pt for 13 min at room temperature (24 °C ± 2 °C). The resulting BiOI film was rinsed with deionised water and dried in air. To obtain a relatively low hydrophobic crystalline penta-bismuth hepta-oxide iodide (Bi5O7I) film, the as-deposited BiOI films were annealed in air for 1 h at 450 °C (ramping rate = 5 °C min−1).
To obtain amorphous V2O5 with the above FTO/Fe2O3/Bi5O7I film, a 1:1 ethanol/water solution with 0.22 M vanadyl sulfate hydrate (VOSO4·xH2O, Sigma Aldrich) was used as the electrochemical deposition bath. Amorphous V2O5 was deposited via anodic mode at a constant current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 for 20 min at room temperature. The as-deposited FTO/Fe2O3/Bi5O7I–V2O5 films were then annealed in air for 1 h at 450 °C (ramping rate = 5 °C min−1). The Bi5O7I flakes and amorphous V2O5 were heated and reacted to obtain crystallised BiVO4 and V2O5. To remove the residual V2O5, the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4–V2O5 film was immersed in 1 M KOH solution for 20 min with gentle stirring, and then washed with deionised water and allowed to air dry naturally. The cobalt oxide co-catalyst was loaded onto the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 film by drop casting 6 μL cm−2 of 40 mM cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin; 99%) ethanol solution, followed by oxidative calcination for 1 h at 350 °C (ramping rate = 5 °C min−1) in air.
Film characterisation
UV-vis absorption spectra of the anodes were analysed using a spectrophotometer (JASCO V-780) with an integrating sphere and operated in the transmission mode. Phase identification was then achieved using a Rigaku (SmartLab) X-ray diffractometer (XRD) equipped with a Cu Kα (using 45 kV and 200 mA, λ = 1.540619 Å) radiation source and operated in the 2θ scan mode from 15° to 60° in steps of 0.01° at a rate of 5° per minute. The results were the averaged values after five measurements. To confirm α-Fe2O3/BiVO4, the reference JCPDS files for α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 01-076-8403) and BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 00-044-0081) were examined. The morphologies of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 films were characterised using a JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and a focused ion-beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM, Zeiss Crossbeam 540). The FIB-SEM was equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) unit (Oxford Instruments, Silicon Drift Detector-X-MaxN).
Photoelectrochemical property measurements
The photoresponses of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 films were measured using a 100 W Xe lamp (Newport) with an AM 1.5G filter. The light output was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using a power meter (TENMARS, TM-207). The PEC performances of the photoanodes were evaluated in a three-electrode configuration using a potentiostat/galvanostat analyser (Zahner, Zennium E Electrochemical Workstation). The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl, and a 2 cm2 platinum gauze was used as the counter electrode. As a standard, the films were illuminated from the sample side, and the scan rate was set to 20 mV s−1. In this study, all J–V measurements were anodic sweeps (i.e. scanned toward the positive direction). The electrolyte was composed of 0.5 M boric acid (H3BO3, Aladdin) and adjusted to pH 9.5 using potassium hydroxide. All the potentials reported in this work are against the RHE and obtained relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode using the Nernst equation, ERHE = EAg/AgCl + EAg/AgCl vs. NHE + 0.059 pH. Here, ERHE is the converted potential vs. RHE; EAg/AgCl vs. NHE is the correction coefficient for the Ag/AgCl reference electrode with respect to a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) and specified as 0.197 at 25 °C; EAg/AgCl is the experimentally measured potential against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) is the so-called haft-cell solar-to-hydrogen (HC-STH) conversion efficiency. ABPE is widely used as a conversion efficiency index for PEC water splitting. ABPE was calculated using eqn (1): (1)where ΔJ (Jlight − Jdark (mA cm−2)) is the measured photocurrent density, V (vs. RHE) is the applied bias, and P is the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2).
To quantify the contributions of the suppressing bulk or surface recombination, the charge separation efficiency (ηsep) and surface transfer efficiency (ηtrans) of the BiVO4 and Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanodes were calculated using the following equations:37,38 JH2O = Jabsorbed × ηtrans × ηsep(2) JNa2SO3 = Jabsorbed × ηsep(3) ηsep = JNa2SO3/Jabsorbed(4) ηtrans = JH2O/Jabsorbed × ηsep = JH2O/JNa2SO3(5)where JH2O is the measured photocurrent density and Jabsorbed is the photon absorption rate (expressed as photocurrent density). The calculated Jabsorbed of the BiVO4 photoanode was specified as 4.45 mA cm−2.4 The Jabsorbed of the Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode was also calculated using this value because the origin of the photoelectrons is speculated to be from the BiVO4. JH2O and JNa2SO3 are the photocurrent densities collected in the 0.5 mol L−1 potassium borate electrolyte without and with 0.3 M Na2SO3, respectively. When Na2SO3 is added to an electrolyte, it acts as a hole scavenger. In the presence of Na2SO3 in the electrolyte, the surface transfer efficiency is assumed to be 100%.
Furthermore, the incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out from 380 to 560 nm by measuring the photocurrents produced under chopped monochromatic light irradiation (Newport, Cornerstone 130). The monochromatic light intensities were measured with a calibrated photodiode power sensor (Newport, Optical Power Meter Kit, 843-R). The IPCE (%) was then calculated using eqn (6): (6)where λ is the wavelength of the incident monochromatic light (nm), j(λ) is the photocurrent density under the illumination of wavelength λ (mA cm−2), and Io(λ) is the incident light intensity at wavelength λ (mW cm−2).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were recorded using a Zennium E Electrochemical Workstation (Zahner) under solar simulated light (1 sun, AM 1.5G) within a 10 kHz to 10 mHz frequency range at 0.6 and 1.23 V vs. RHE in the electrolyte of 0.5 M KB solution (pH 9.5) and with an alternate current perturbation of 10 mV.
PEC water splitting on the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode
Photoelectrochemical water splitting on the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoelectrode was conducted at applied potentials of 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE under solar simulator (Asahi spectra, HAL320) light of 100 mW cm−2 (Asahi spectra, CS-20). The PEC properties were then evaluated using a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko, HZ-7000) in the chronoamperometry mode; a gas-tight three-electrode configuration with a compartmental H-type cell separated by a membrane (DuPont, Nafion 117) was used. Incidentally, the use of a membrane separation cell can prevent the occurrence of reverse reactions. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl, and a platinum wire (diameter 0.5 mm, length 6 cm) was used as the counter electrode; furthermore, 0.5 M potassium borate (buffered at pH 7.5) was used as an electrolyte. The evolved gas volumes from the photoelectrodes were recorded with an on-line gas chromatography system (Shimadzu GC-8A, MS-5A column, TCD detector, oven at 60 °C, and Ar carrier). Argon gas was used as the carrier gas from the PEC cell to the gas chromatograph, with a flow rate of 12.5 mL min−1.
Results and discussion
Film fabrication and characterisation
First, to prepare the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode, the underlayer Fe2O3 was formed on an FTO glass substrate. Iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) was deposited from iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate solution at 65 °C. To obtain crystalline α-Fe2O3, the as-deposited FeOOH film was annealed at 500 °C for 5 h.21 Then, the BiVO4 upper layer was deposited on the Fe2O3 underlayer by the proposed electrochemical deposition method, which produced a BiVO4 thin film via a two-step process.36 In the first step, bismuth iodide oxide (BiOI) was prepared by electrochemical deposition;4,9,36 since the surface of the BiOI thin film was relatively hydrophobic, BiOI was converted to a penta-bismuth heptoxide iodide (Bi5O7I) thin film by heat treatment to reduce its hydrophobicity. In the second step,36 amorphous V2O5 was evenly distributed throughout the Bi5O7I layer by electrochemical deposition. Then, the Bi5O7I–V2O5 precursor was converted to crystallised BiVO4 and excess V2O5 by heating at 450 °C for 1 h. Following this, the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4–V2O5 film was washed using KOH solution to remove the extra V2O5 to finally obtain the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 film.
The film thicknesses of the Fe2O3 underlayer by electrochemical deposition at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min were in the range of 100 to 800 nm (Fig. 1A). The UV-vis absorption spectra of the Fe2O3 films at electrochemical deposition times from 5 to 30 min increased proportionally with the deposition time (Fig. 1B). The absorbance suggests that the thickness of the Fe2O3 underlayer increased by the deposition duration. Furthermore, the absorbance of the Fe2O3(time)/BiVO4(13) films increased proportionally with the thickness of the Fe2O3 underlayer (Fig. 1C). The absorbance of the composite FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) film was higher than those of Fe2O3 and BiVO4 individually. The composite film achieved more adequate light absorption. The absorbance spectra indicated that the band gaps of Fe2O3 and BiVO4 were about 2.2 eV and 2.4 eV, respectively, which were consistent with those reported previously (Fig. 1D).

The crystal characteristics of Fe2O3, BiVO4, and Fe2O3/BiVO4 were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2 and S1–S3†). Due to the low crystallinity of Fe2O3, the peak intensity in the XRD pattern was much lower than the peak intensity of BiVO4. From the XRD pattern in Fig. S1,† there is no doubt that α-Fe2O3 is synthesized by our method. Fig. 2 shows the XRD depth profiles of the FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) film collected from different angles (θ) of the incidence X-ray to the sample surface. At lower measurement angles, the XRD data are obtained predominantly from species closer to the surface. In contrast, when the angle is larger, the XRD data are obtained not only from the surface but also from the bulk of the sample. Here, the shallow incidence X-ray (θ = 0.25°) pattern clearly shows crystallised BiVO4 on the surface of the sample, and a larger angle of incidence (θ = 5°) results in an Fe2O3/BiVO4 composite in the bulk of the sample. These 2θ peaks are in good agreement with the references for α-haematite (JCPDS no. 01-076-8403) and scheelite-structured monoclinic bismuth vanadate (JCPDS no. 00-044-0081). In particular, the enlarged view shows that the peaks of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 from the Fe2O3/BiVO4 overlap (Fig. S3†). The presence of other Fe species compounds (e.g. Fe, FeO, FeBiO3etc.) on the surface and at the interface between the Fe2O3 underlayer and BiVO4 upper layer was not detected in the XRD pattern. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the Fe2O3, BiVO4 and Fe2O3/BiVO4 anodes were also performed. The Fe 2p3/2 binding energies on the XPS chart are Fe metal: 706.7 eV, FeO: 709.6 eV, and Fe2O3: 710.8 eV, respectively. The Fe 2p3/2 of the Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode was 711 eV (Fig. S4A†). Due to the influence of the upper layer BiVO4, the Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 peak intensities of the underlayer Fe2O3 were lower than the peak intensities of a single layer Fe2O3 anode (Fig. S4B†). In addition, Fe2O3 LMM (Mg Kα) peaks were detected for the Fe2O3/BiVO4 film at binding energies of approximately 600 eV and 500 eV (Fig. S4C†). From the results above, no composites of Fe and Bi compounds were detected in the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 films, suggesting that Fe2O3 and BiVO4 did not react and convert during the BiVO4 synthesis process.
 Fig. 2  Depth-profile XRD patterns of the Fe2O3/BiVO4 film. The shallow incidence X-ray (θ = 0.25°) pattern shows BiVO4 on the surface of the sample, and deep incidence (θ = 5°) pattern shows Fe2O3 and BiVO4 composites in the bulk part of the sample. The stick patterns of α-haematite (JCPDS no. 01-076-8403) and scheelite-structured monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 00-044-0081) are the references. 
The FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) film whose structure is shown in Fig. 3 was prepared by electrodeposition: the underlayer Fe2O3 was obtained by the deposition of FeOOH for 15 min, and the upper layer BiVO4 was obtained via depositing BiOI for 13 min. From the morphological observations, the average size of the rice-like Fe2O3 particles was approximately 20 × 50 nm, which is extremely small. Furthermore, the BiVO4 particle dimensions in the upper layer were less than 100 nm. Both the underlayer and upper layer had porous structures, and the film thicknesses were approximately 350 nm. The EDS elemental analysis of the FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) film showed that the atomic ratio of Bi:V was 1:1.02 and that of Bi:Fe was 1:2.46 (Fig. S5†). It was observed that the density of Fe2O3 in the underlayer was almost the same as the density of BiVO4 in the upper layer. The EDS mapping and line analysis of a cross section of the FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) film were performed (Fig. S6 and S7†). In the EDS mapping analysis, the element signal of Fe Kα1 appeared below Bi Mα1 and V Kα1 signals. In the EDS line analysis, one peak intensity appeared in the Fe Kα1 signal; therefore the Fe species layer was only the Fe2O3 underlayer, and Fe species were not present on the surface. Bi Mα1 and V Kα1 signals were collected at the same intensity on the surface. It was confirmed that there was no contradiction with the SEM cross-sectional image.

PEC properties of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode
In general, the optimal electrolyte for the Fe2O3 photoanode is a strong alkaline solution of 1 M NaOH (pH 13.6). In this study, the electrolyte used for all PEC measurements was 0.5 M potassium borate (pH 9.5). Therefore, the photocurrent of Fe2O3 is considered to be lower than the general result. Many studies have reported the high-performance results of high temperature (>600 °C) treated Sn or Si doped Fe2O3. The actual photocurrent of native Fe2O3 is less than 0.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 1 M NaOH with back illumination,39,40 which produced IPCEs below 1%.41 The PEC performance of the primitive Fe2O3 anode used in this study is also extremely low. Interestingly, this low performance Fe2O3 can improve the PEC performance of the BiVO4 anode when Fe2O3 is placed as an underlayer.
As shown in Fig. 4A, the photocurrent density of the FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) anode exhibits significant enhancement in the low bias region. The J–V measurements were performed under an AM 1.5G filter with a light intensity of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) in 0.5 M boric acid adjusted to pH 9.5 with potassium hydroxide. The light exposure was from the front of the samples (BiVO4 surface side). The native haematite anode showed little response to light in the pH 9.5 electrolyte. In contrast, the native BiVO4 anode exhibited an active photoresponse. The photocurrents were 0.15 mA cm−2 and 1.6 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. Surprisingly, the BiVO4 with the Fe2O3 underlayer film showed 0.95 mA cm−2 and 1.5 mA cm−2 photocurrent densities at 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. The photocurrent density increased in the low bias region and decreased in the high bias region compared to the BiVO4 anode. There was a decrease of about 0.4 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE. The onset potential (here refers to the potential when the photocurrent is 0 mA cm−2) of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode appeared at 0.3 V vs. RHE, which is between the onset potentials of BiVO4 (at ca. 0.2 V vs. RHE) and Fe2O3 (at ca. 0.45 V vs. RHE).

(F) Native BiVO4 anode with a deposition duration of 13 min. These J–V curves are collected in 0.5 M H3BO3 adjusted to pH 9.5 with KOH under AM 1.5G with 1 sun front illumination. The scan rate was 20 mV s−1. Each dark–current curve is shown as a dashed line. 
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode showed that no reduction peak was detected on the cathodic sweep curve (Fig. S8†). Furthermore, Fe(III) + e = Fe(II) and E0 = 0.771 V vs. SHE. Fe(II) + 2e = Fe and E0 = −0.44 V vs. SHE. Therefore, in the present study, no Fe2O3 was reduced to FeO or metal Fe in the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode during J–V measurements.
The dark current of FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 appeared around 0.3–0.6 V, and this also appeared at the native Fe2O3 anode. Since it is unlikely that other Fe species compounds will be formed by the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode preparation method in this study, it is presumed that this dark current is due to the low conductivity Fe2O3 underlayer. The flat band of Fe2O3 is about 0.5–0.6 V vs. RHE according to previous literature.18–21 The conduction band is located at a slightly negative potential of the flat band and is associated with the onset potential. As the scan rate increased, the dark current near the onset potential increased (Fig. S9†). The dark current is possibly because of the way of measurement of the potentiostat.
To investigate the effects of the Fe2O3 underlayer, we fabricated FTO/Fe2O3(time)/BiVO4(13) films with different deposit durations of the Fe2O3 underlayer. The J–V curves of the Fe2O3(time)/BiVO4(13) anode were obtained for varying deposition durations of FeOOH, as shown in Fig. 4B. The photocurrent at low potentials increased as the thickness of the Fe2O3 underlayer increased from a deposition duration of 5 to 15 min. However, the maximum photocurrents of these three anodes at high potentials did not change significantly. The Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) anode with the underlayer thickness deposited over 15 min showed the highest photoactivity. For an Fe2O3 underlayer thickness with the deposition duration exceeding 15 min, the photocurrent of the Fe2O3(time)/BiVO4(13) anode decreased greatly. This impact on the photocurrent is considered to be due to the thickness of the Fe2O3 underlayer. The photocurrent reduced because the electron transfer characteristics further deteriorated in the thicker Fe2O3 underlayer.38,42 On the other hand, the photocurrent of FTO/WO3/BiVO4 photoanode increased in the low to high potentials as the WO3 underlayer thickness (200 to 1000 nm) increased due to the effect of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction.14 The photocurrent improvement effect of Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction and WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction is different.
However, the BiVO4 upper layer was prepared with a BiOI deposition duration of 13 min as the optimal time for the FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(time) anode (Fig. 4C). Although the deposition duration was extended to 20 and 30 min, the photocurrent density of the FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(time) anode did not increase. Similar results were obtained from the 10 min Fe2O3 underlayer deposit of the FTO/Fe2O3(10)/BiVO4 anode (Fig. S10†). The effect of the photocurrent due to change in the thickness of the BiVO4 upper layer was smaller than that due to the change in the thickness of the Fe2O3 underlayer. The highest photocurrents for the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode were obtained with deposition periods of 15 and 13 min for FeOOH and BiOI, respectively.
When light was irradiated from the back (FTO side) of the FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) anode, the photocurrent density dropped significantly (Fig. 4D). Since the band gap of Fe2O3 is narrower than that of BiVO4, less amount of light was incident on the BiVO4 upper layer when exposed from the back. Moreover, the poor electron transfer properties of the Fe2O3 underlayer severely restricted the photoactivity. The J–V curves of the native haematite anode were recorded by illuminating the front and back (Fig. 4E), and very low photoactivity was detected, with the photocurrent density from the back being higher than that from the front. This is consistent with the values in previously reported treatises.39–41 The front and back illumination J–V curves of the native BiVO4 anode were also recorded (Fig. 4F), and the results were in contrast to those of the photoresponses of the Fe2O3 anode; the photocurrent density of the BiVO4 anode was higher when exposed from the front than from the back. In many reports, the large crystal size and thick film thickness of the BiVO4 anode resulted in higher photocurrents in the back illumination than in the front.42,43 However, the BiVO4 anode of this study is composed of nano-sized crystals, and the BiVO4 anode is thin and has high light transmittance.36 In the case of the back illumination, it is probable that the light was lost due to the reflection and absorption of the FTO glass substrate. This is in line with previously reported trends of BiVO4.9,36 Obviously, the photoactivity of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode differs from those of the Fe2O3 and BiVO4 anodes.
Although no compounds of Fe and Bi or V were detected by XRD and XPS, the effects of Bi5O7I and V2O5 on the PEC performances of the Fe2O3 anode were measured. There were no notable improvements from FTO/Fe2O3/Bi5O7I and FTO/Fe2O3/V2O5. According to previous literature, although the doping effect is lower than those of Mo and W, Fe-doped BiVO4 photoanodes have been reported to show improvements in PEC performances.44,45 It has also been reported that the BiVO4 electrode surface modified with Fe2O3 shows enhanced photocurrent density.46,47 Nevertheless, the effects of Fe-doped and Fe2O3 surface modifications differ from those demonstrated by the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode in this study. An FTO/BiVO4/Fe2O3 anode was prepared by the synthesis method of Fe2O3 and BiVO4 in this study. The photocurrent of the FTO/BiVO4/Fe2O3 anode was much lower than the photocurrent of the FTO/BiVO4 and FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anodes (Fig. S11A†). Furthermore, due to the absorption of Fe2O3, the photocurrent of the front illumination was lower than that of the back illumination (Fig. S11B†). As claimed by the concept of this study, since the underlayer Fe2O3 can act as a hole blocking layer, BiVO4 must be placed on the surface, and the Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction exposes holes for water oxidation on the surface of the anode effectively. Consequently, the photocurrent of FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 is very likely to increase compared to BiVO4 and Fe2O3.
Thus far, there have been no reports of discussions on the impact of layer thickness sensitivity on the undoped Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction. To summarise the thickness-dependent PEC results of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anodes used in this study, Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent densities at 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE when the Fe2O3 underlayer thickness changes; the PEC measurements were obtained with irradiation from the front. At 1.23 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent density decreased as the film thickness increased; at 0.6 V vs. RHE, the highest photocurrent was obtained at an Fe2O3 underlayer thickness of 366 nm by electrodeposition for 15 min. The generation of photocarriers was likely because of the light absorbed in the BiVO4 upper layer. Then, the photogenerated holes moved to the surface to oxidise water. At the same time, the photogenerated electrons transferred to FTO through the Fe2O3 underlayer. Owing to the short hole diffusion length and slow carrier mobility of Fe2O3, the photocurrent was greatly affected by the Fe2O3 underlayer thickness.

Surface modification effect of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode
Charge recombination at the junction of the BiVO4 photoanode surface and electrolyte causes significant energy loss and greatly impairs PEC performance, and surface co-catalyst modification methods are often used to solve this problem. The surface modification of BiVO4 with co-catalysts has been shown primarily to utilise space charge layers to increase the surface charge separation and accelerate the rate of oxygen production.7,48,49 The mechanism of the effect of cobalt co-catalysts is that divalent cobalt can be oxidised into trivalent and tetravalent cobalt, which can be reduced to divalent cobalt to catalytically assist water oxidation.6Fig. 6A shows the effects of the Co3O4 co-catalyst on BiVO4 and Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) anodes. The Co3O4 cocatalyst causes a large cathode shift and increases the photocurrent even at high potentials. The BiVO4 anode increases from 0.15 to 1.35 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE and from 1.58 to 2.50 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Similarly, the Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode increases from 0.95 to 1.55 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE and from 1.55 to 2.82 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Thus, the BiVO4 with the Fe2O3 underlayer shows higher photoresponsiveness.

Furthermore, it is important to separate the contributions of the applied bias potential and photoanode to the overall photocurrent. In Fig. 6B, the ABPE was calculated from the corresponding J–V curves using eqn (1). The ABPE of the native Fe2O3 anode is close to zero. The composite Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode showed largely different efficiencies than Fe2O3 or BiVO4, when used individually. The maximum ABPE for the Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode increased from 0.25% at 0.9 V vs. RHE for bare BiVO4 to 0.61% at 0.6 V vs. RHE, and a higher efficiency was obtained with moderate bias. After loading Co3O4 on BiVO4 and Fe2O3/BiVO4 anodes, the maximum ABPEs increased to 0.86% and 1.01%, respectively.
The hole scavenger Na2SO3 was added to the electrolyte solution to quantify its contribution to the prevention of bulk or surface recombination. Using eqn (2)–(5), the charge separation efficiency and surface transfer efficiency were calculated. When the hole scavenger Na2SO3 is present in an electrolyte solution, the surface transfer efficiency can be estimated to be 100% owing to the oxidation of sodium sulfite on the surface of the photoanode. As a result, the recombination reaction is prevented, and the photocurrent density is greatly increased. In Fig. 7A, the BiVO4 and Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) anodes increased from 0.15 to 1.5 mA cm−2 and from 0.95 to 2.4 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE, respectively. The Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode shows a higher photocurrent density than the BiVO4 anode because the Fe2O3 underlayer significantly improved the charge separation efficiency (Fig. 7B). However, the improvement of surface transfer efficiency was effective only in the <0.9 V vs. RHE low bias region (Fig. 7C). It is considered that the inherent characteristics of Fe2O3 influence the effect of the heterojunction. In addition, the contribution of the surface reaction of BiVO4 is dominant. Our results (Fig. 7B and C) suggest that electron–hole recombination on the BiVO4 surface is the main issue of PEC water splitting, even though the Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction improves carrier separation.

Impedance of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode
In general, the interfacial properties between the photoelectrode and the electrolyte can be analysed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. In the Nyquist diagram, the semicircles corresponding to the bulk, interparticle interface, and electrode interface appear from the high frequency side (i.e. low real impedance side). From these diameters, the bulk resistance Rb, particle interfacial resistance Rgb, and electrode interfacial charge transfer resistance Rct can be calculated. The Nyquist plots (imaginary–real components of impedance plots, I vs. R) were collected at 0.6 and 1.23 V vs. RHE in the dark and under 1 sun light (Fig. 8 and S12†) from 10 kHz to 10 mHz. In the present study, no clear semicircle appeared on the Nyquist diagram. However, it seems that the resistance of the bulk can be roughly discussed using the Nyquist plots. Impedance represents the ratio of voltage to current in an AC circuit. The imaginary impedance (I) of the native Fe2O3 anode is very high in the dark, and the imaginary impedance under 1 sun light decreased due to the generation of photocurrent. In the case of the native BiVO4 anode, the dark imaginary impedance was high, but it decreased significantly under light irradiation. In addition, the imaginary impedance at 1.23 V vs. RHE dropped by more than 0.6 V vs. RHE. This is because the photocurrent that appeared in the high bias region was large. The same tendency was seen in the Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode (Fig. S12†). Fig. 8 shows the imaginary impedance of the anodes under 1 sun light illumination at 0.6 and 1.23 V vs. RHE. Comparing the Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode with the Fe2O3 anode, the Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode shows high conductivity at both 0.6 and 1.23 V biases. On the other hand, compared to the BiVO4 anode, the imaginary impedance is higher at 1.23 V and lower at 0.6 V. This result was consistent with the result of the J–V curve in Fig. 4A. This confirms that the bulk conductivity of the Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode is higher than that of the BiVO4 anode at 0.6 V vs. RHE.

Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE)
The bandgap of Fe2O3 allows it to absorb light with slightly longer wavelengths than BiVO4. If the photocurrent is derived from the absorption of Fe2O3, it can be inferred that the photoresponse should be shown for a wavelength range longer than the absorption of BiVO4. The IPCE is an important indicator for understanding the wavelength dependence of solar energy conversion efficiency. The IPCEs of the Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13), BiVO4, and Fe2O3 anodes were recorded at 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE by front illumination (Fig. 9). For the pristine Fe2O3 thin-film anode, only the 1.23 V vs. RHE values are shown. As noted from the above J–V curves, the photoactivity was extremely low, so the efficiencies in the ultraviolet and visible light regions were almost 0%. To compare Fe2O3/BiVO4 and BiVO4, Fe2O3/BiVO4 displayed a high yield at a low potential of 0.6 V, and BiVO4 showed a high yield at a high potential of 1.23 V. This is in good agreement with the PEC observations in Fig. 4A. The IPCEs of 0.6 V vs. RHE at 420 nm of BiVO4 and Fe2O3/BiVO4 are 5.0% and 6.8%, respectively; in contrast, at 1.23 V vs. RHE at 420 nm, the IPCEs are 22.8% and 17.6%. Furthermore, no efficiency was recorded for regions outside the BiVO4 absorbance spectrum. These effects are attributed to the photoactivity of BiVO4.

Origin of photoactivity enhancement in the Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction composite anode
The Mott–Schottky plots for Fe2O3 and BiVO4 were obtained in 0.5 M potassium borate (pH 9.5) solution in the dark. The resulting flat-band potentials (Efb) of Fe2O3 and BiVO4 were estimated to be ca. 0.6 V and 0.1 V vs. RHE, respectively (Fig. 10 and S13†). Both Efb values were in line with those reported in previous literature.18–26 Evidently, an Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction can be constructed in a composite photoanode; this suggests that the excited photoelectrons can move from the conduction band of BiVO4 to Fe2O3 smoothly. Identically, holes from the valence band can shift to the surface of the BiVO4 layer and oxidise water. The heterojunction is thus able to enhance the PEC water splitting performance by improving the separation of the photogenerated carriers. In the present study, the upper layer BiVO4 absorbed light to generate photoelectrons and holes; then, the carriers transferred to the Fe2O3 underlayer and photocurrent was detected via the FTO layer. However, the mobility of the photoelectrons and hole transport efficiency are affected by the carrier concentrations in the undoped semiconductors. Generally, carrier mobility is inversely proportional to carrier concentration owing to scattering.50,51 The short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm), slow carrier mobility (0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1), and inadequate carrier lifetime (3 ps) of Fe2O3 have significant impacts on the photoactivity,31 particularly in thicker layer films. The photocurrent densities at low potentials were not limited by the carrier mobility; however, the carrier mobility decreased at high potential when the carrier concentration increased. Consequently, the photocurrent density decreased at high potentials, especially for pristine Fe2O3, which has a poor hole diffusion pathway and carrier mobility. In the next step of this study, it is our aim to minimise the mobility reduction by adding dopants to the Fe2O3 underlayer.

The role of the film thickness of ultrathin haematite photoanodes has been reported previously.52 For Fe2O3 film thicknesses of 11.8 nm to 28.6 nm, the photocurrent densities decreased as the internal charge transport resistances increased with increasing film thicknesses. However, the 28.6 nm thick Fe2O3 anode with a low charge transfer resistance value at the interface between the Fe2O3 surface and electrolyte provided the best PEC performance.52 In other words, improving the interfacial carrier transfer at the Fe2O3/surface would also benefit the Fe2O3 internal carrier transfer. In the case of the FTO/Ga2O3/Fe2O3 (27 nm) ultrathin photoanode,53 the PEC properties were sensitive to the thickness of the Ga2O3 underlayer. This was attributed to the effect of electron transfer due to the crystallisation and insulation properties of the underlayer material, i.e., the interfacial carrier transfer and internal carrier transfer dominate the PEC results for the multilayer photoanode. In this study, the Fe2O3/BiVO4 interfacial charge migration was rectified by the heterojunction structure. Furthermore, the internal carrier transfer was enhanced for a suitable thickness (ca. 350 nm) of the Fe2O3 underlayer. For thinner films, the underlayer did not function effectively as a heterojunction, but the thicker films prevented electron transfer in the underlayer and electron injection from Fe2O3 into the conductive FTO substrate.
Water splitting of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode
To confirm that the photocurrent actually causes water splitting rather than side reactions, the photogenerated hydrogen and oxygen were measured by gas chromatography, whilst applying constant potentials of 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE. The evolutions of hydrogen and oxygen from the FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) anode were collected for 120 min. In Fig. 11A, the photocurrent density is observed to be relatively stable, and there is no serious decrease. After 120 min of the reaction, hydrogen and oxygen were detected at 0.6 V as well as 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 11B). These correspond to a stoichiometric ratio of approximately 2:1 for both biases. Evidently, the photocurrent from the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode can achieve solar-driven water splitting. Furthermore, the faradaic efficiencies at 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE were almost 100%. Notably, even at 0.6 V vs. RHE, the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anode produced oxygen without problems because of the improved carrier separation by the heterojunction.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this work demonstrated successful fabrication of an Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction as a composite photoanode for solar-driven water splitting. In this undoped semiconductor system, it is possible to understand the effects from the real band positions of the primitive materials simply. Owing to the band alignment and potential difference, the photoinduced charge carriers achieve efficient charge separation and transport. However, this heterojunction effect is greatly influenced by the thickness and inherent properties (e.g., hole diffusion: 2–4 nm and carrier mobility: 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the Fe2O3 underlayer. The photocurrent density decreases as the underlayer thickness increases, impeding interfacial electron injection and electron transfer in the bulk. For WO3/BiVO4 anodes, this phenomenon has not been reported, perhaps owing to the inherent properties of WO3. In addition, while the carrier concentration is high, the carrier mobility decreases because of scattering. Thus, the photocurrents of the FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 anodes decreased in the high bias region (e.g., >1.23 V vs. RHE). Moreover, although the charge separation efficiency was improved by the Fe2O3 underlayer, the surface transfer efficiency in the high bias region was low. This is thought to be because the surface recombination reaction of BiVO4 was the main issue. In contrast, with an appropriate Fe2O3 underlayer thickness in the low bias region, carrier separation and transport proceed beneficially. As a result of rectifying the carrier transfer across the heterojunction at low potentials (e.g., at 0.6 V vs. RHE), the photogenerated electron–hole separation and water oxidation on the BiVO4 surface were observed to be active. The photocurrent density of the composite anode reached 0.95 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE, which is six-fold greater than that of bare BiVO4. The PEC water splitting cell of FTO/Fe2O3/BiVO4 achieved a stable photocurrent at 0.6 V vs. RHE, producing hydrogen and oxygen at a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1. The faradaic efficiency of water splitting was close to 100%, and our results showed that the Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction required a lower applied bias for PEC water splitting even in the absence of dopants and without surface modifications.

 	Fig. 1  (A) Relationship between deposition durations and film thicknesses of the Fe2O3 underlayers. UV-vis absorption spectra of (B) Fe2O3(time) films with electrochemical deposition durations of Fe2O3 of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min. (C) Fe2O3(time)/BiVO4(13) films prepared over the Fe2O3 underlayer in (B). (D) BiVO4(13) with a deposition duration of 13 min, Fe2O3(15) with a deposition duration of 15 min, and the Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) film.	 

 	Fig. 2  Depth-profile XRD patterns of the Fe2O3/BiVO4 film. The shallow incidence X-ray (θ = 0.25°) pattern shows BiVO4 on the surface of the sample, and deep incidence (θ = 5°) pattern shows Fe2O3 and BiVO4 composites in the bulk part of the sample. The stick patterns of α-haematite (JCPDS no. 01-076-8403) and scheelite-structured monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 00-044-0081) are the references.	 

 	Fig. 3  Morphologies of the porous films: (A) FIB-SEM cross-sectional image of the FTO/Fe2O3(15)/BiVO4(13) film; (B) top-view SEM image of the Fe2O3 and (C) BiVO4 surfaces. The deposition durations of Fe2O3 and BiVO4 were 15 and 13 min, respectively.
