    , Accepted 27th April 2021First published on 27th April 2021AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) or coordination polymers (CPs) are regarded as new variety of materials that find potential applications in several areas such as gas/small molecule absorption/separation, gas storage, membranes, and drug delivery system. Also, MOF-incorporating nanoparticles display activity towards various catalytic/electrocatalytic/photocatalytic processes. However, the application of pure metal–organic frameworks as photocatalysts has been recently explored. Further, computational studies on MOFs/CPs add newer insight to better understand the mechanistic pathways through which this new class of materials displays photocatalytic properties. The presented perspective emphasizes the general introduction of syntheses, design strategies and structures of photoactive metal–organic frameworks, and the plausible mechanistic pathways through which these MOFs display photocatalytic degradation of organic molecules in particular organic dyes that are usually present in wastewater discharge from industries.
1. Introduction
Photocatalysis can be regarded as a sustainable and environment-friendly technology, which operates through the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy.1 According to IUPAC, photocatalysis is a “change in the rate of a chemical reaction or its initiation under the action of ultraviolet, visible, or infrared radiation in the presence of a substance—the photocatalyst—that absorbs light and is involved in the chemical transformation of the reaction partners”.2 It is a crucial process utilized in water splitting,3 solar cells,4 hydrogen generation,5 and CO2 reduction.6
The rapid development in industrial, agricultural, and pharmaceutical sectors has led to the concomitant rise in environmental pollution, amongst which water pollution has become significantly intractable. Since only 2.5% of freshwater is available on earth, it is essential to use fresh water effectively and smartly. Following this vision, the treatment of wastewater using appropriate methods can make it usable for mankind.7 Due to the low biodegradability of wastewater, the contaminants get easily concentrated in aquatic environments and enter living organisms through the food chain.8 Thus, the treatment of wastewater can be considered to be the most urgent issue in the 21st century. The common contaminants/pollutants that exist in wastewater can be broadly classified based on their chemical composition into inorganic and organic contaminants.
Inorganic pollutants include oxyanions/cations and heavy and/or radioactive metal ions, such as Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Cr2O72−, which are difficult to degrade and can cause serious health problems.9–11 Organic pollutants represent a relatively wider family than inorganic contaminants. The commonly found organic contaminants in water streams include organic aromatic dyes, detergents, oils/greases, polyaromatics, insecticides, pesticides, herbicides, varied classes of medicines, personal care products, surfactants, carbohydrates, and plasticizers.12 At present, there are over 1000000 commercial dyes produced,13–15 which possess chemically stable structures (usually aromatic and conjugated), and hence remain chemically inert towards light, heat, and oxidizing agents. These dyes are also non-biodegradable, toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic by nature. Thus, for environmental remediation, the removal of injurious organic aromatic dyes from the water stream is extremely desirable. Common dyes used as substrates for photocatalytic decomposition over metal–organic frameworks are shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Structure of dyes used as the substrate for photocatalytic decomposition over metal–organic frameworks. 
In view of this, varied technologies are being employed for the removal of heavy metals and organic compounds for water remediation purposes (Fig. 1). These include precipitation, ion exchange, membrane technology, coagulation and/or flocculation,14 biological processes,15 advanced oxidation processes (AOPs),16 and adsorption.17,18 Each of these techniques is associated with some advantages as well as shortcomings, for example, some of these methods are expensive while others are less efficient for the purification of effluents having a very low concentration of pollutants. Therefore, to deal with the issues of cost and efficiency, alternative approaches/techniques and new materials, which are simple to design and can offer efficient, economically feasible, and having a wider range of applications, are essential.

In this regard, semiconductor-based photocatalysis is a flourishing approach to degrade pollutants because it has simplified operation procedures, consumes low energy, does not generate secondary pollution, has high efficiency, and is environment-friendly. Such a semiconductor-based photocatalytic technique is a heterogeneous catalytic process that operates under light irradiation. It allows the one-pot elimination of contaminants from wastewater19 and can efficiently mineralize aromatic pollutants, especially dyes, to liberate H2O and CO2 as the final product.
The important criteria that any material must fulfil to behave as a photocatalyst are: (a) should have broad visible-light absorption; (b) should display the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers; (c) high stability in water and reusability; (d) appropriate bandgap; (e) economic feasibility; and (f) non-polluting nature. By far, a series of photocatalysts have been developed, viz., oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, WO3, α-Fe2O3, BiVO4, Cu2O, and CeO2),20–24 sulfides (e.g., CdS, In2S3, Sb2S3, and CoS2),25 elemental photocatalysts,26 (oxy)nitrides,27 and plasmonic photocatalysts.28 However, these semiconductors display limited practical applications due to some disadvantages associated with them, such as (a) photo corrosion-induced irreversible damage, (b) wide bandgaps that limit the absorption of the solar spectrum to UV light, thereby resulting in low efficiency, (c) rapid recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs, (d) insufficient specific surface area, (e) rapid deactivation, and (f) easy agglomeration. Consequently, from a sustainable environment point-of-view, it is still an intimidating task to design and develop newer eco-friendly photocatalysts that can degrade pollutants efficiently and steadily under visible light irradiation.
In the past two decades, an increasing interest in the investigation of a new class of hybrid, nano-porous, crystalline materials, which are well known as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and consist of metallic nodes interconnected by polytopic bridging organic linkers, had been observed.29 These new classes of emerging materials have revealed outstanding potential in diverse fields including gas or solvent sorption,30,31 sensors,32 drug delivery,33 gas separation,34 catalysis,35 adsorption of vapors,36 magnetism, luminescence, light-harvesting, ferroelectricity, ion exchange, biomedical imaging,37–39 and ionic conductivity.40 Also, MOFs possess unique intriguing properties such as a designable framework, high specific area, and porosity, allowing fast mass transport and/or interactions with the substrates, and exposed active sites that make them ideal materials to be used in catalysis,41,42 especially photocatalysis. They are also known to exhibit magnetic properties43 or second-order non-linear optical (NLO) properties.44 Most importantly, on irradiation with UV and/or visible light, several MOFs have displayed semiconducting properties that have revealed their potential use as photocatalysts. So far, many MOFs have catalyzed the photodecomposition of organic/aromatic pollutants, hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, water-splitting, organic transformations, and so on.45,46 The use of MOF-based photocatalysts for the efficient degradation of organic pollutants had been reported since 2006.47 These materials are very beneficial as heterogeneous catalysts in photodegradation reactions because they offer high efficiency, ambient operating temperature, good reproducibility, catalyst reusability, ease of handling, and simplicity in the degradation of persistent, non-biodegradable, and toxic contaminants without causing secondary pollution.48 In particular, aromatic subunits of the organic linkers in most MOFs readily interact with light to generate charge-separated states, making them promising candidates in light-harvesting and photo-induced catalysis. Further, photoactive MOFs possess the following advantages over traditional inorganic photocatalysts: (a) the inherent porosity, which facilitates the diffusion of organic contaminants and their decomposed products through their open channels, a prerequisite for efficient photocatalytic reaction; (b) the electronic structure of MOFs can be easily tuned due to the modular nature of MOF syntheses, which in turn allow apt designing with the fine-tuning of MOFs at the molecular level; (c) MOFs can be synthesized by adopting a myriad of synthetic protocols such as solvothermal synthesis, vapor diffusion, emulsion-assisted precipitation, and ultrasonication, which render MOF based photocatalysts a high degree of crystallinity as well as diversified morphology and topology.49a An additional benefit is tuning the stability of MOFs for use under harsh photocatalytic conditions.49b–f The chemical stability of MOFs strongly depends on factors including the charge density of metal ions, connection numbers of metal ions/clusters, basicity, configuration, as well as hydrophobicity of ligands. Based on the HSAB principle, with the same coordination environments, high-valent metals with high charge density (hard acids), including Zr4+, Cr3+, Al3+, and Fe3+, tend to coordinate with O donor ligands (hard bases) and low-valent metal ions, including Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, and Ag+, which can be considered as soft acids, to construct highly stable MOFs with suitable N-containing linkers (soft bases). The important aspects of the use of MOFs are the presence of an extremely stable porous framework and exposed SBU, which may lead to the sorption of dyes in/on the framework and can be photolytically decomposed.10,50,51 In addition, by post-synthetic modification, MOFs can be functionalized to attain high efficiency towards the photochemical decomposition of organic dyes.52,53 From the above discussion, it is clear that for a cleaner environment and to improve human health, the removal of contaminants is very necessary, where MOFs provide a promising alternative as photocatalysts. Although there are several reviews/perspectives reported emphasizing the application of MOFs and their composites for the eradication of dyes54,55 but, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first perspective that is completely devoted to assessing the application of pure MOF-based catalysts for the photo-degradation of dyes. Thus, the presented perspective provides an insight into the recent progress in the development of pure and monometallic MOFs as reusable/recyclable catalysts for the photodegradation of poisonous aromatic dyes. Also, the varied synthetic protocols, as well as the strategies used for designing the targeted photoactive MOFs, have been discussed. Also, the MOFs with interesting photocatalytic performances towards dye degradation have been discussed according to the categories of metals, viz., main group metals, transition metals, and f-block metals. Finally, a perspective to address the mechanism behind the photo-degradation of dyes by the MOFs has been presented.
2. Syntheses, design strategies, and structures of photoactive MOFs
2.1 Syntheses of MOFs
Conventionally MOFs are usually synthesized in the liquid phase and involve the mixing of organic ligands, metal ion nodes, or clusters, which are commonly referred to as “Secondary Building Units (SBU)”, and a solvent for a certain period. Fig. 2 summarizes the different approaches and synthetic conditions that are generally employed for the preparation of MOFs.56,57

2.1.1. Solvothermal/hydrothermal method. 
The most common strategy for synthesizing MOFs is the solvothermal/hydrothermal method, which involves the execution of the reaction in an autoclave (closed vessel) at a controlled temperature or under autogenous pressure. The solvents used in solvothermal reactions are high-solubility organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, diethylformamide, acetonitrile, acetone, ethanol, or methanol.58,59 Amongst these solvents, formamides are better solvents as they not only have better solubility towards the reactants but also help in the better deprotonation of carboxylic acid ligands. The mixture of solvents can also be used to deal with differences in the solubility of reactants. However, the solvothermal method is associated with some limitations such as long reaction time for optimal crystallization, high temperature, as well as the high cost of the solvents. Hence, to cope up with the cost issue of organic solvents, hydrothermal synthesis, where water substitutes the organic solvents, thereby provides a more environment-friendly and inexpensive approach. Also, to accelerate the crystallization and to improve the quality of crystals, other alternative synthetic approaches have been developed such as microwave-assisted, electrochemical, sonochemical, mechanochemical, and spray-drying syntheses. Furthermore, an unconventional method, namely, “the solid-phase synthesis” of MOFs, has also been reported. This method is quick and environment-friendly but using this method, it is difficult to obtain single crystals of the desired compounds; hence, the structural determination of the MOF product is nearly impossible.56


2.1.2. Microwave-assisted synthesis. 
It is a quick method to synthesize MOFs. Microwave (MW) heating involved in this procedure results in higher crystallinity, development of a porous texture, reduction in the particle size, and better morphology control of the resultant MOFs.58,59 The microwave synthesis of MOFs was firstly done using Cr-MIL-100.60 Klinowski et al. summarized the role of the power level, irradiation time, temperature, solvent concentration, and substrate composition for the microwave-assisted synthesis of MOFs.59 Various common MOFs such as IRMOF-1, IR-MOF-2, IR-MOF-3, Cr-MIL-101, MOF-5, HKUST-1, and MIL-77 have also been prepared using micro-wave assisted synthesis.61–65


2.1.3. Sonochemical synthesis. 
The sonochemical method facilitates the generation of homogeneous nucleation centers and significantly accelerates the crystallization time as compared to conventional solvothermal synthesis. This method has been used for the synthesis of several MOFs, for instance, crystals of size 5–25 mm of MOF-5 were synthesized by sonochemical irradiation in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) in merely 30 min.66,67 Argirusis et al. summarized the synthesis of various metal–organic frameworks using the sonochemical method and by variation in the size/shape/surface area and morphology by varying the preparation conditions/power, etc.


2.1.4. Electrochemical synthesis. 
This approach is better for the direct syntheses of thin films of MOFs over a surface at mild temperatures, thereby reducing the chances of film cracking, which are usually associated with other synthetic procedures. Direct electrosynthesis can be done using anodic dissolution of metal ions or reductive deprotonation of the linker. Ligand anchoring to the substrate, galvanic displacement, electrophoretic deposition, and use of metal oxide or hydroxide as the self-template are methods for indirect electrosynthesis.68,69 Also, unlike other synthetic methods, there is no requirement of metal salts as precursors in this method because the metal ions are supplied by the oxidation of electrodes. Another advantage of this process is that it offers the continuous and industrial-scale production of MOFs.68,69 However, the development of the electrochemical synthesis of metal–organic frameworks has lagged behind other synthetic methods. To date, this process has been reported for the syntheses of several microcrystalline powders and films.70


2.1.5. Mechanochemical synthesis. 
For the construction of MOFs, principally, three different mechanochemical methods, namely, neat grinding, liquid-assisted grinding, and ion-and-liquid assisted grinding, have been exploited.71–74 Neat grinding does not require any solvent while liquid-assisted grinding requires catalytic amounts of liquid phases and ion-and-liquid-assisted grinding requires a catalytic amount of liquid along with traces of salt to increase the rate of formation of MOF. The interest in the mechanochemical syntheses of MOFs is growing due to its solvent-free (or require very less amount of solvent) and environment-friendly nature because it requires less energy (as heating is not necessary) and therefore offers high efficiency and simplicity.71–74 The first report on mechanochemical synthesis includes the formation of a single-phase and highly crystalline product [Cu(isonicotinic acid)2] through the solvent-free grinding of isonicotinic acid and Cu(OAc)2·H2O.75 Various crystalline MOFs with metal ions such as Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) have been obtained by adopting this synthetic technique.


2.1.6. Slow evaporation method. 
Slow evaporation synthesis operates at room temperature without any external energy supply. However, the main drawback associated with this method is that it requires significantly longer crystallization times.
Besides these, some other less analyzed and uncommon methods employed for the synthesis of MOF include the diffusion method,76 ionothermal method,77 and spray-drying methods.78 The ionothermal method employs an ionic liquid (IL) as the reaction medium. It also provides a structural template and charge balance group in the reaction. The use of an ionic liquid offers benefits such as low melting point, reasonable thermal stability, and a wider liquefaction range. Also, by altering the composition of the IL, the final architecture of the MOF can be tuned and in turn its physicochemical properties. It is found that metal–organic frameworks such as Mg-MOF-74, CPO-27-Co, Zn-MOF-177, Zn-MOF-5, Cd-TMU-7, Zn-TMU-34, Fe-MIL-53, Fe-MIL-88A, and HKUST-1, which have been synthesized by different methods,79–94 exhibit significant change in yield, particle size, BET/Langmuir surface area, pore volume, and morphology. Based on the surface morphology and surface area, the photocatalytic performance of the MOFs can be tuned for desired applications.
The final steps that are usually required during the synthesis of MOFs are purification and/or activation. Purification involves the exclusion of impurities such as co-crystallized linkers or dense hybrid compounds and metal oxides that are not occluded in the pores of the MOFs. This can be executed by “sieving”, which operates based on densities of the synthesized products, or by solvent treatment, which is usually performed at elevated temperatures. The activation of the MOFs requires the exclusion of guest molecules from the pores, which is achieved using techniques such as vacuum drying, solvent exchange, or supercritical drying.58,59

2.2 Design strategies
High stability in various solvents at different pH (acid/alkaline solution) and under strong radiation are essential requirements for an ideal photocatalyst. In addition, it must possess high-porosity, low-cost, and must be easy to utilize and produce. The assembly of two components including SBU and organic linkers leads to the development of MOFs. The variation of both organic linkers and SBUs to a huge extent can result in the design and synthesis of a vast number of MOFs. Also, such a variation can alter the architecture of the resulting MOF, which further enhances the desirable properties of MOF, hence making them more efficient. However, to precisely control the functionality, porosity, and specified properties of the framework, appropriate designing to obtain the targeted MOFs is required, in which the properties can be depicted by basic constructional units before synthesizing the framework or in situ functionalization.94,95 While designing an MOF-based photocatalyst, incorporation of light-harvesting centers and reaction sites and transport of charge/electron from the light-harvesting site to the reaction site are some important pre-requisites. When the design of light-harvesting centers is focused on, in general, the absorption of visible or infrared light is desirable to uplift the utilization of sunlight because the solar spectrum comprises merely 5% UV (300–400 nm) but 43% visible (400–700 nm) and 52% IR (700–2500 nm) radiation.96 For light-harvesting, varied π-conjugate organic frameworks are introduced in the organic ligands, which increases the electron delocalization and consequently leads to a desirable red shift in the electronic absorption spectrum. Further, to design catalytically active centers, the introduction of metal-driven reaction centers such as sole metal or metal oxide centers inside the MOF is required, which can promote photocatalytic reactions. Thus, the introduction of extensive π-conjugation in the ligand as well as designing the electron-rich metal cluster accelerates the photochemical reaction by decreasing the bandgap. Also, the organic ligand should display a good charge transportability to prevent the massive fusion of electrons and holes. Besides in situ functionalization, another approach to improve the photochemical properties of the MOFs is post-synthetic modification, which usually indicates a modification in the MOF structure including metal or SBUs, ligand, functional groups, and the pores.52,53 Subudhi and co-workers have developed/reviewed53 the methods to enhance the photochemical activity of the parent MOFs using various forms of chemical modulation such as covalent PSM, ionic PSM, dative PSM, inorganic PSM, and tandem PSM. Such modifications in the functional group reduce the e−/h+ recombination possibility and hence accelerate the charge mobility phenomena.
In addition, photocatalysts with smaller particle sizes also reduce the electron–hole pair recombination, hence promoting the catalytic performance.97 For designing targeted MOF-based photocatalyst, the energy level of the light-harvesting center and the reaction site should be comparable to facilitate smooth electron transfer.
To construct photocatalytically active MOFs, designing the single organic linker is very important as it performs various roles such as light-harvesting, transfer of electrons and holes to the reaction centers, and ultimately the construction of a framework by coordinating to at least two reaction centers. The antenna, anchors, lengths, and conjugation extents of the organic ligand significantly affect the charge transfer kinetics.98

2.2.1. Antenna. 
In an organic ligand, the antenna can facilitate photon harvesting as such functional groups can donate electrons to the π-cloud of the organic linkers to lower the bandgap energy of a targeted MOF.99–109 For instance, the methyl group having the weakest electron-donating effect can decrease the bandgap from 3.57 eV to 3.50 eV, which is nearly similar to the –Cl (3p electron).99 However, functional groups such as –OH and –NH2, which act as the electron-donor, can decrease the bandgap to 2.8 eV and 2.6 eV, respectively, by extending the π-electron cloud conjugation of the aromatic ligands for the 10% MIL-125 (functional group) model (Fig. 3). Besides, deaminated benzenedicarboxylic acid ligand has been reported to decrease the bandgap down to 1.3 eV. On the contrary, the electron-withdrawing –CF3 group causes the destabilization of the Ti–O bond and results in an unstable MOF.

Isovalue = 0.001 e Å−3. (c) PBEsol band structures for synthetic MIL-125 (black), 10%-MIL-125-NH2 (blue), 10%-MIL-125-(NH2)2/90%-MIL-125-NH2 (orange), and the theoretical 10%-MIL-125-(NH2)2 (green). The orange bands, which have been truncated to improve the clarity of the band structures, maintain flat characteristics. The enlarged section emphasizes the VB-1…12 of the 11 nondegenerate monoamine bands. The energies are adjusted such that the highest occupied non-amine band is at 0 eV. The changes in the occupied VBs are depicted by the arrows. PBEsol is a qualitative approach; the band structures could not be computed at the HSE06 level of theory because of the system size. (d) HSE06-calculated VB and CB energies of MIL-125-NH2 models containing increasing numbers of 2-amino-benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate linkers [i.e., 0 (MIL-125) to 12 (100%-MIL-125-NH2)] per unit cell. The degree of amination does not affect the bandgap.

2.2.2. Anchors. 
The binding ability of an organic linker plays an essential role in electron transfer and also towards the stability of the framework. The charge transfer rate during photocatalytic reactions are also determined by these linkers.110 For example, electron transfer is much faster with –COOH anchors as compared to –PO3H2 anchors in complexes that are revealed by non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulation techniques for broader non-adiabatic coupling. Also, the theoretical calculation showed that carboxylic acid functional (–COOH) can sustain relatively higher electron density in comparison to the phosphonate group (–PO3H2). The reasons behind faster electron transfer are the lower atomic weight of carbon than phosphorus and stronger double bond over the single bond. Following the computational investigation, the electron transfer time for –COOH and –PO3H2 are 7.50 and 56.7 ps, respectively, while the experimental electron transfer time for COOH was found to be 12 ± 1 ps. However, the decomposition of the –COOH group in some photocatalytic reactions may result in a smaller turnover number (TON). As an explanation, it was proposed that the experimentally observed turnover numbers do not necessarily suggest the electron transfer rate for the semiconductors. This also suggests that in comparison to the –PO3H2 group, –COOH groups can be a relatively better option to be utilized as an anchor to synthesize the targeted MOF-based photocatalysts.


2.2.3. Charge transportation. 
Electron transportation in MOF operates either via the ligand or the space. Such transportation depends on the supramolecular framework as well as the conjugation extent of the ligand in MOF. When there are long-distance charge transports, charge recombination and relaxation processes increase the consumption of charge carriers. The likelihood of charge recombination can be reduced by decreasing the lengths of bridging ligands but, simultaneously, charge transfer kinetics is also suppressed as the absorption spectrum is shifted to the UV region due to the shortening of conjugation.111 Introducing an antenna or an electron-donating group increases the conjugation in the organic linker, which thereby increases the chances to capture light and subsequently accelerates the charge transfer kinetics. Conversely, the introduction of an electron-withdrawing functional group at the organic linker causes lethargic charge transfer kinetics.112 Thus, organic linkers offer a better electron transport pathway in comparison to non-bridging frameworks as it is anticipated that electrons may get localized on the organic linkers for a short period before arriving at the catalytic sites and make the catalytic reaction feasible.113

2.3 Structure and photocatalytic properties of the MOFs
The pure MOFs that have been successfully synthesized during the past decade and employed as photocatalysts for the eradication of various types of stable and toxic dyes under UV and/or visible light irradiation are summarized in Table 1. Based on the structure, it is clear that various metal centers have been utilized for the photocatalytic decomposition of dyes over MOFs. Common homo-/hetero- di-/tri-/tetra-/multi-topic carboxylic and N-heterocyclic organic ligands with extensive π-conjugation have been utilized as linkers in photochemically active MOFs exhibiting dye degradation.114 π-Conjugated organic frameworks are important for light-harvesting due to the increase in electron delocalization, leading to a reduction in the bandgap and consequently the absorption of low energy radiation. Besides, the organic linker plays an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic performance by the increase in the light-harvesting property, and the modification of the charge-transfer and electron–hole recombination processes. Based on the metal ions, MOFs can be classified into main group, transition, and f-block metal, which have been discussed in this section.

2.3.1. MOFs based on main group metals. 
Although, to date, the MOFs derived from main group metal centers are numerous, their use as possible photocatalysts for the removal of aromatic dyes from wastewater discharge has not been explored exhaustively. Some pertinent examples of such materials designed and developed in the last couple of years have been presented in Table 1.
Li and co-workers reported a highly stable, multifunctional indium-organic framework SNNU-110 {[In3OCl(H2O)2(L1)2]}n having a bandgap of 3.53 eV.115 Upon irradiation with a 300 W xenon lamp, this indium-based MOF displayed photocatalytic degradation percentage of ∼93.1% for methylene blue (MB) in 190 min and 94.6% for rhodamine B (RhB) after 70 min (Fig. 4c and d).

Another anionic indium-based MOF JUC-138, [(CH3)2(NH2)+][In(H4L2)]·(DMF)5, was reported by Zhao and co-workers, which possess Eg of ∼3.34 eV.116 The MOF had been synthesized using the emissive pyrene-based linker H8L2 = 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(3,5-isophthalic acid)pyrene. The MOF catalyzed ∼90% photodegradation of AB after 4 h under UV irradiation.
Another MOF In-1, {[(CH3)2NH2]3(In3(L3)4)}·(solvent)x, has been reported by Li and co-workers, which possesses doubly interpenetrated indium–organic framework using the tritopic linker 5′-(5-carboxy-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)[1,1′:3′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-dicarboxylic acid (H3L3).117 The asymmetric unit of this very interesting MOF having a bandgap of 2.89 eV consisted of three crystallographically independent In3+ ions coordinated to six-, seven-, and eight-carboxylate oxygens, which formed almost similar tetrahedral [In(O2C−)4] SBUs (Fig. 5a). These SBUs were further connected via conjugated tritopic linkers to form a 3-periodic framework with 2-fold interpenetration (Fig. 5(b and c)). In-1 photo-degraded aqueous solutions of MB and MO as well as aqueous solution containing both MB and MO. Upon UV irradiation, In-1 degraded 95.89% of an aqueous solution of MB in 60 min and 92.80% of the MO was photodegraded within 120 min (Fig. 5(d and e)). When MB was irradiated with visible light, 98.89% degradation was attained after 100 min, while 90.51% of MO was photodegraded after 120 min (Fig. 5(f and g)). Further, the mixture solution turned colorless after 100 min under visible light irradiation with the percentage degradation of 99.30% and 85.33% for MB and MO, respectively (Fig. 5(h)).

Indium oxide displays good semiconducting properties because it possesses energy bandgap in the range of 3.55–3.75 eV. The integration of this oxide into an MOF can narrow the bandgap because of the downsizing effect of the photocatalytic particles associated with the reduction of the fast electron–hole recombination rate.222,223 Also, the presence of the [In3O] inorganic cluster in the In-MOFs as in SNNU 110 can provide excellent photodegradation activity towards noxious dyes. Also, indium-based-MOFs can be crystallized readily and isolated as compared to the so-called highly photocatalytically active Ti-MOFs.124
In addition to indium, the reports of Pb-based MOFs are also available, which have been used as photocatalysts for the photodegradation of aromatic dyes. Zong's group reported an MOF Pb-1, [Pb(L4)(H2O)]n, synthesized using a Y-shaped N-heterocyclic carboxylic acid ligand 4,4′-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methylenebis(benzoic acid) (H2L4).118 The bandgap energy of Pb-1 was suitable to be used as a potential photocatalytic material, which photodegraded 74.2% of MB in 125 min.
Li and colleagues synthesized four highly stable Pb(II) MOFs, namely, [Pb(L5)(L6)]n (Pb-2), [Pb2(L5)2(L7)]n·2nH2O (Pb-3), [Pb2(L5)2(L7)]n (Pb-4) [Pb(L5)(L8)0.5]n (Pb-5), and [Pb2(L5)2(L9)]n (Pb-6), which were obtained by the self-assembly of 2-(2-carboxyphenyl)imidazo(4,5-f)-(1,10)phenanthroline (HL5) and four different aromatic carboxylic acid ligands, namely, pyridine-4-carboxylic acid (HL6), 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2L7), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2L8), and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2L9).119 All the four polymers were used as photocatalysts for the photodegradation of MB and displayed 53.1% (for Pb-2), 99.3% (for Pb-3), 84.6% (for Pb-5), and 72.1% (Pb-6) after an irradiation time of 280 min. Hence, amongst all the four MOFs, Pb-3 offered the best photocatalytic degradation of MB, which might be attributed to the presence of –NH2 in the carboxylate ligand of Pb-3, which was inadvertently absent in rest of the three Pb-based MOFs. Another interesting MOF, Pb-7, {[Pb11(L10)7(μ4-O)3(μ3-OH)2]·(H2O)}n, with a 3D framework was been constructed using 2-methyl-4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (H2L10).120 The MOF possessed dodecanuclear SBUs of {Pb12(COO)16(μ3-OH)2(μ4-O)4} and under visible light photodegraded 63.5% of the aqueous solution of methyl orange in 150 min in the presence of sodium persulfate.
Etaiw et al. synthesized a holodirected 3D-MOF of lead SCP 2, [Pb(L11)2]n (Fig. 6a), where the Pb center was octa-coordinated with hexagonal bi-pyramid (HBPY-8) geometric configuration.121 Moreover, the coordination bonds, hydrogen bonds, and π–π stacking significantly affected the backing network structure of SCP 2. SCP 2 was used as a heterogeneous photocatalyst under UV and sunlight irradiation for the degradation of MB in the presence of H2O2 as the oxidant. This 3D MOF degraded 94.27% of the dye in 60 min under UV-light irradiation and 91.11% after 120 min under sunlight irradiation (Fig. 6d and e).

Qiao's group reported another MOF Pb-8, [Pb2L12(H2O)]n·3nH2O·nDMF (where, H4L12 = 5-(bis(4-carboxybenzyl)amino)isophthalic acid). The bandgap for this MOF was 2.92 eV and on irradiation for 250 min, it degraded 64.2% of MB.122 The differences in the photocatalytic activities of the aforementioned Pb-based MOFs might be resulting from their different networks, ranging from one-dimensional chain to two-dimensional sheet and three-dimensional framework due to changes in the coordination modes of the ligands.
Apart from indium and lead-based MOFs, the photocatalytic performance of Bi-based metal–organic complexes (MOCs) has also been investigated but in comparison to In- and Pb-based MOFs, the reports of Bi-based MOCs are very few. Zhang and co-workers reported organobismuth(V) complex Bi-1 (where Bi-1 = Ph3Bi(L13)2 and HL13 = 4-fluorobenzoic carboxyl)123 having an energy bandgap of 2.25 eV. On irradiation with UV light for 60 min, this organobismuth complex photodegraded 79.8% of MB, 76.3% of MV, and 91.8% of RhB. Also, in visible-light, this complex photodegraded up to 90.7% RhB in 8 h. From the above discussion, it can be inferred that In, Pb, and to some extent Bi-based MOFs display satisfactory photocatalytic properties.
These results could be attributed to the unique coordination and electronic properties of these metal ions as well as the nature of organic linkers. This is because the apt choice of the metal center, ligand, and co-ligand can give rise to programmed frameworks, which in turn can tune the electronic communication properties of these MOFs, a vital parameter associated with such class of photocatalysts.
Further, the use of a highly conjugated organic linker such as tritopic H3L3 ensures that the synthesized MOFs will be light-absorbing and responsive. Notably, the heavy p-block element of IVA group, the lead(II) ion, possesses prospects to engender unusual networks with interesting properties as a consequence of its large ionic radius, flexible coordination environment, and stereochemically active lone pair. The aromatic carboxylic acids having carboxylate groups as well as pyridyl ring/s such as nicotinic acids are the fascinating multifunctional building blocks used for constructing SCP with fascinating frameworks having diverse topologies. Also, Bi can be exploited for the construction of photoactive MOFs as it exhibits intriguing properties such as a highly anisotropic Fermi surface, low carrier density, and a long carrier means free path due to a very small bandgap, which may improve the photocatalytic performance of the otherwise scarcely explored Bi-based composites significantly.


2.3.2. MOFs based on transition metals. 
Transition metal-based MOFs represent the most widely studied group of MOFs that have been explored as potential candidates for the photodegradation of dyes. The relevant examples of MOFs with transition metal nodes, exhibiting appreciable degradation efficiencies towards dye removal, have been presented in Table 1 and summarized in this section.
Although very few Mn-based MOFs have been reported in recent years, Etaiw's group had prepared a highly efficient, nano-sized supramolecular complex SC1, [Mn(L16)4(NCS)2], having ethyl isonicotinate ligand (L16), SCN as a co-ligand, and Mn2+ cation.125 The asymmetric unit of this MOF consisted of one crystallographically independent Mn(II) center, four L16 ligands, and two crystallography different thiocyanate groups in the transoid mode (Fig. 7a). The Mn(II) ion has octahedral geometry, where Mn(II) was coordinated to two thiocyanate nitrogens and four nitrogens of L16 ligands. The structure of SC1 consisted of discrete units of [Mn(L16)4(NCS)2], which were connected by intermolecular H-bonds extending the structure of SC1 to a 3D-network. The calculated bandgap for SC1 was 2.06 eV and the MOF degraded eosin-Y (EO) dye up to 72.62% under sunlight irradiation in 180 min and 93.91% under UV-light irradiation within 130 min. Also, the MOF degraded 97.26% of EO dye on ultrasonic irradiation after 90 min in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 7b–e).

Cobalt is the most commonly used transition metal ion for the synthesis of MOF-based photocatalysts. Xiao et al. reported a dinuclear Co-based pillar-layered-like-MOF with the structural formula [Co(L21)(L22)2]n (Co-1) (where, L21 = tris(4-pyridin-4 ylphenyl)amine and H2L22 = 4,4′-sulfonyldibenzoic acid).129 The bandgap for Co-1 was estimated to be 2.55 eV, indicating it to be a suitable candidate for the photocatalytic degradation experiment. Co-1 decomposed approximately 94% of RhB under UV light after 60 min in the presence of H2O2 as the initiator.
Essentially, photocatalysts require UV and/or visible irradiation for the degradation of dyes. This essential feature limits their practical application as photocatalysts under conditions lacking sunlight, such as regions with limited daytime, on cloudy or rainy days, or at night. Thus, the ability to degrade dyes in darkness is also desirable. Recently, Deng and co-workers constructed a hydrolytically anionic MOF, SCNU-Z2, based on a new heterotopic tripodal nitrogen-containing ligand H2L26 = 5,5′-(3-1H-imidazol-1yl-1,5 phenylene)bis-2H-tetrazole, which represented the first example of the catalytic degradation of the anionic dye MB in dark.132 The asymmetric unit of SCNU-Z2 comprises one Co(II) ion with 1/3 occupancy and half (L26)2− ligand along with some unspecified distorted solvent molecules or cations. The one tetrazolyl group was bound to two Co(II) ions, while the imidazolyl and the other tetrazolyl groups were bound to other Co(II) ions, one each (Fig. 8a). The combination of two Co(II) ions with three tetrazolyl groups from three different (L26)2−DIPT− ligands formed a binuclear SBU, which were further connected by the imidazolyl and the other tetrazolyl groups to generate one-dimensional SBU (Fig. 8b). Finally, the 1D SBUs were joined by (L26)2− ligands to generate a porous 3D network possessing 1D tubular channels (Fig. 8c). Using SCNU-Z2, 97% degradation of MB was achieved in merely 15 min in dark (Fig. 8d and e).

Hou's group synthesized an MOF Co-5, {[Co3(L27)2(L28)2(H2O)2]·14H2O}n, by employing H3L27 = 1-aminobenzene-3,4,5-tricarboxylic acid ligand as well as the ancillary ligand 4,4′-bipyridine (L28).133Co-5 dissociated 78.26% fluorescein, 96.28% MB, 95.79% RhB, 74.15% R6G, 89.63% GV, and 81.13% MO under 1 h visible light irradiation in the presence of H2O2. Further, the pH-dependence of the photocatalytic performance of the MOFs for the degradation of organic dyes has been recently demonstrated by Shang and co-workers.134 They synthesized an MOF Co-6, {[Co(L29)2]SO4}n, having bandgap of 1.81 eV by using a flexible tripodal ligand 1,3,5-tris(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (L29). The photocatalytic efficiency of Co-6 was observed to be improved with a rise in the pH and about 97.77% MB was degraded in 25 min when the initial pH of the reaction mixture was 12.2. This enhancement in photocatalytic degradation might be arising because in alkaline solution, the catalyst surface might acquire negative charge because of the adsorption of OH− ions, which facilitates interaction with the oppositely charged MB (C16H18N3S+) dye, further leading to the immediate degradation of MB molecules.
Another promising visible-light-driven photocatalyst Co-12, [Co3(L35)2(DMF)(L36)]·DMF (where, H3L35 = biphenyl-3,4′,5-tricarboxylic acid and L36 = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane) with the bandgap of 2.10 eV was developed by Zhao and co-workers.138 This MOF degraded nearly 90% of RhB within 120 min in the presence of H2O2. Another cobalt-based MOF Co-15, [Co(L39)(L8)1/2]n (where H2L8 = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, HL39 = 3,5-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethoxy)benzoic acid) with Co(II) paddle wheel SBU, was generated by bridging carboxylate as well as pyridine groups.141 Upon UV irradiation in the presence of H2O2, Co-15 was able to photodegrade 95% methyl blue and 84% MB, while ST was almost completely degraded. Recently, Mandal and co-workers reported the green synthesis of a visible light-responsive MOF Co-16, [{Co0.5(L40)0.5(L41)1.25}]∞, which was derived from 5-azidoisophthalic acid (H2L40) and the co-ligand 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (L41).142 The MOF had been transformed to nanoscale MOF (NMOF) simply by hand grinding to enhance the effective surface area and subsequently, its photocatalytic capability was studied. The bandgap for NMOF was 2.81 eV, which falls in the visible region. For MB, the percentage degradation was found to be 92%, while that of RhB was 90% for the visible light irradiation time of 120 min in the presence of H2O2. Li and coworkers constructed a porous MOF with square-shaped cavities formulated as {[Co(L17)]·0.5(CH3CN)·5(H2O)}n (HPU-5) (where H2L17 = (5-(3,5-di-pyridin-4-yl-[1,2,4]triazol-1-ylmethyl)-isophthalic acid)).126 The Eg value of HPU-5, based on the verticle absorption edge, was 1.109 eV, which indicated that the complex had potential photocatalytic activities. With HPU-5, 83% degradation of MO was observed in 120 min, while 99.3% degradation of RhB was observed in 150 min in the presence of H2O2. Qin's group recently reported an MOF Co-17 having the formula {[Co(L42)(L43)]}n (where H2L42 = 6-(4-carboxyphenyl) nicotinic acid and L43 = 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)benzene).143 The MOF possessed a three-dimensional 3-fold interpenetrated framework having pcu topology with a bandgap of 2.90 eV. The percentage degradation of this MOF against MO and the dye was found to be 100% under UV irradiation in the presence of H2O2. Besides, the MOF also degraded ST, neutral red, RhB, methyl blue, and MB with slightly lower degradation percentages of 78%, 74%, 71%, 67%, and 53%, respectively, under similar conditions.
Another MOF Co-18 was reported by Wang et al. with the structural formula {[Co(L44)(H2O)2](L8)·(H2L8)}n, which was synthesized using 1,1,2,2-tetrakis[4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl]ethylene (L44) and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2L8).144Co-18 displayed a (4,4)-connected binodal 2D topology with a point symbol of {44·62}{44·62}. The bandgap obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the absorption edge was found to be 1.66 eV. The degradation of MB reached 92.48% after 135 min irradiation, while with RhB, it was 90.56% after 180 min visible light irradiation in the presence of H2O2. Another MOF Co-19 synthesized for natural sunlight photocatalytic degradation of MB, having the composition [Co(L46)(L45)1.5]n (where, L45 = 4,4′-bis(imidazole-1-yl)-biphenyl and H2L46 = tetrabromoterephthalic acid) exhibited a percentage degradation of 85.83% towards MB after being radiated for 8 h under natural sunlight irradiation.146 Zong's group reported four Co(II) MOFs based on 4,4′-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methylenebis(benzoic acid) (H2L4) with the composition {[Co4(L4)4(H2O)]·2CH3CN·4H2O}n (Co-20), {[Co(L4)(L47)]·1.5CH3OH·2H2O}n (Co-21), {[Co2(L4)2(L48)]·6CH3CH2OH·4H2O}n (Co-22), and {[Co(L4)(L45)(H2O)]·DMA}n (Co-23) (where, L47 = 4,4′-bis(benzoimidazo-1-yl)biphenyl, L48 = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene, L45 = 4,4′-bis(imidazolyl)biphenyl).147 The photocatalytic activity of MOFs (Co-20)–(Co-23) was tested against MB, MO, OIV, and MV solutions under UV irradiation for 180 min each. For MB, the percentage degradation was 92.4%, 84.8%, 91.3%, and 90.0%, respectively. For MV, the percentage degradation was 91.4%, 84.6%, 90.6% and 89.8%, respectively. For MO, the percentage degradation by the MOFs (Co-20)–(Co-22) was 89.6%, 83.5%, and 87.9%, respectively. For OIV, 86.2%, 78.8%, and 85.5% degradation was observed using Co-20, Co-21, and Co-22, respectively. Wang and co-workers synthesized two MOFs having the composition {[Co(L49)0.5(L50)]·4H2O}n (Co-24) and {[Co5(L49)4(L51)4]·2NO3·2DMA·2H2O}n (Co-25) using the designed tripodal linker 1,3,5-tris(2-methylimidazol-1-yl)benzene (L49) and isophthalic acid linkers (H2L50 = 5-aminoisophthalic acid and H2L51 = 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid) using the mixed ligand strategy.147 The bandgaps of Co-24 and Co-25 calculated using the Kubelka–Munk method were 1.71 and 1.84 eV, respectively. After 70 min, the percentage degradation of MB was 94.36% for Co-24 and 89.57% for Co-25 under visible light irradiation in the presence of H2O2. Another MOF Co-26 with the structural formula [Co(HL52)(L53)]n (where, H2L52 = 4-(4-carboxylphenylmethylthio)benzoic acid and HL53 = 1,3-bis(1-imidazo-1-ly)benzoic acid) has been developed by Fan et al.148 This MOF exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance with the degradation of 95.0%/94.7%/94.1% for MB/MV/RhB, respectively, after 120 min under UV irradiation.
Nickel(II) is another commonly employed metal ion for constructing photoactive MOFs. Liang and co-workers designed two new Ni-based MOFs, [Ni(L54)1.5(L55)(H2O)]n (Ni-1) and [Ni(L48)(L56)]n (Ni-2) by reacting 5-substituted isophthalic acid (5-nitroisophthalic acid (H2L55) and 5-methoxyisophthalic acid (H2L56)) and N-donor ligands, L54 = 1,4-bis(1-imidazolyl)benzene and L48 = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene.149 The bandgaps were calculated to be 1.72 and 1.69 eV for Ni-1 and Ni-2, respectively. The photocatalytic activities of the two MOFs were assessed against the MO solution with the percentage degradation of 94% for Ni-1 and 95% for Ni-2 under visible light for 70 min in the presence of H2O2.
Qu et al. reported three new nickel(II) MOFs with the formulae {[Ni(L57)(L51)]·H2O}n (Ni-3), [Ni(L57)(L58)]n (Ni-4), and [Ni(L57)(L59)]n (Ni-5), employing 1,4-bis(benzimidazol-1-yl)-2-butylene (L57) and aromatic dicarboxylic acids ligands, namely, H2L51 = 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid, H2L58 = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, and H2L59 = 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid).150 (Ni-3)–(Ni-5) displayed excellent MB photodegradation rates, reaching up 91.5% for Ni-3, 93.4% for Ni-4, and 87.0% for Ni-5 in 120 min under UV irradiation. In Ni-4, each central Ni(II) ion was situated in a distorted octahedral coordination environment by four O atoms from two different (L58)2− anionic ligands and two N atoms from distinct L57 ligands (Fig. 9a). The N-donor L57 ligands acting as the μ2-bridging ligands connect the adjacent Ni(II) centers to form a 1D “W”-like chain ([Ni(L57)]n). The completely deprotonated (L58)2− ligands linked the neighboring Ni(II) ions to construct a 1D zigzag chain ([Ni(L58)]n). Finally, two kinds of 1D chains ([Ni(L57)]n) and ([Ni(L58)]n) are alternatively linked as an intricate 1D → 3D framework with large cavities (Fig. 9b). To enhance the stability of the framework of Ni-4, a single network decreases the porosity by the interpenetration of identical frameworks, generating a three-fold interpenetrated structure, which led to a 3D → 3D parallel framework (Fig. 9c). The periodic UV-vis spectra of the MB solutions during the degradation reaction under UV light irradiation in the presence of Ni-4 displayed a significant decline in the absorption intensity in 2 h (Fig. 9d). Wang and co-workers prepared a series of visible light-responsive Ni(II) MOFs with 3D architecture, namely, [Ni(L60)(L28)(H2O)2] (Ni-6), [Ni4(L60)4(H2O)8] (Ni-7), [Ni2(L60)2(L61)(H2O)] (Ni-8), and [Ni(L60)(L54)0.5(H2O)]·H2O (Ni-9) (where, H2L60 = 5-(4′-carboxylphenyl)nicotinic acid; L28 = 4,4′-bipyridine; L61 = 4,4′-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)biphenyl; L54 = 1,4-bis(1-imidazoly)-benzene).151 The photodegradation experiments indicated that the MO degradation rate reached 84.3%, 80.6%, 76.6%, and 68.5% in the presence of (Ni-6)–(Ni-9), respectively, after 75 min under visible light illumination. Li et al. reported another MOF Ni-10 having the composition [Ni(L62)(L63)]n (where, L62 = 1,6-bis(benzimidazol-1-yl)hexane, H2L63 = isophthalic acid).152 The photocatalytic activities of both bulk- and nano-structured MOFs were assessed using an aqueous solution of MB as the model pollutant under UV irradiation. Notably, MB degradation was ca. 85.6% for bulk complex and 90.6% for nano-sized MOF after UV illumination for 150 min. The higher activity of the nanostructured complex than that of the bulk-sized MOF can be ascribed to the relatively larger specific surface area of the nano-sized MOF than the bulk-sized MOF. Also, a new ternary MOF Ni-12 having a unique 3D 3,6T13 topology and composition {[Ni2(L64)2(L65)2(H2O)]·8.5H2O}n (where, L64 = 1,4-bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazol-1-yl)-2-butylene and H2L65 = 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid) was used for MB degradation under UV irradiation and exhibited a percentage degradation of about 92.7% after 120 min.154

Apart from cobalt and nickel-based MOFs, copper-based MOFs also represent the most widely studied photocatalysts for dye degradation. Recently, Qian et al. reported a highly efficient, stable, and promising MOF-based photocatalyst, Cu-1, {[Cu(L68)(L69)]·H2O}n (where, L68 = tris(4-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)amine and H2L69 = pimelic acid).155 The independent unit of Cu-1 comprised of one Cu(II) center, one L68, and one (L69)2−. Cu(II) exhibited distorted square pyramidal coordination geometry. One (L69)2− ligand acted as a tridentate linker and connected three Cu(II) centers to construct the [Cu2(COO)4] dimer. The [Cu2(COO)4] dimer was linked to two (L69)2− ligands and generated the one-dimensional chain structure with the formula [Cu2(L69)2]n (Fig. 10a). Further, each [Cu2(COO)4] dimer acted as a 6-connected building block, which was linked by L68 and (L69)2− ligands and constructed an interesting 3D pcu topology (Fig. 10b). The Eg value was estimated to be 2.37 eV and the percentage degradation was 90.3% after 75 min and 90.1% after 150 min for MB and RhB, respectively, under visible light irradiation and in the presence of H2O2 as the electron acceptor (Fig. 10c and d). In addition, the MOF was very stable after the photocatalytic experiment and could be reused at least five times. Recently, the photocatalytic performance of another Cu-based paddlewheel MOF Cu-3, [Cu4(L70)2(H2O)4·5DMF]n (H4L70 = 3,5-di(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)nitrobenzene) has been explored. The MOF having a bandgap of 3.04 eV exhibited a 3D mfj topological framework with 1D triangular channels.157 The bandgap suggested that Cu-3 could act as a proficient candidate to perform photocatalytic reactions under UV irradiation. Cu-3 degraded 81.3% of MV in 45 min under UV irradiation. Also, another MOF Cu-4, [Cu2(L70)·5DMF]n, was reported, which displayed a 3D framework with 1D hexangular channels.158 The photocatalytic property of the MOF against MV suggested that approximately 70% decomposition was observed after 45 min irradiation. Fan's group synthesized another efficient photocatalyst Cu-6, [Cu(H2L72)(L73)]n (where, H4L72 = terphenyl-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxylic acid and L73 = 1,4-bis(1-imidazol-yl)-2,5-dimethyl benzene) with the degradation rate of 97.3% for MB after 2 h in the presence of H2O2 under UV light.159 Wu and co-workers synthesized a unique semiconductive 3D framework (Cu-7), {[CuICuII2(L74)2]NO3·1.5DMF}n, based on the newly designed ligand 4′-(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-4,2′:6′,4′′-terpyridine (H2L74) with a narrow bandgap of 2.1 eV.160 Within 30 min on irradiation with visible light, up to 80% MB was degraded using Cu-7.

Another Cu-based metal–organic framework (MOF-199) was synthesized by adopting the green synthetic protocol using water and employed for the photocatalytic decolorization of colored wastewater containing BB41. It exhibited a percentage degradation of 99% after 3 h under UV irradiation.162 Zhang et al. constructed 3D MOF Cu-9, [Cu(L28)Cl]n, having a bandgap of 1.78 eV, which showed photocatalytic degradation activity for MB in visible light irradiation through the LMCT mechanism.162 Further, the photocatalytic performance was remarkably enhanced upon the addition of H2O2 and about 93.93% photodecomposition of MB took place in 150 min. Wei and co-workers designed an efficient UV as well as visible light active MOF photocatalyst Cu-10, [Cu1.5(μ2-O)(H2L76)] by the in situ self-assembly of copper and 4,4′-[6-(dimethylamino)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diyl]bis(azanediyl)dibenzoic acid (H2L76) ligand.163 Approximately 99% of MB was degraded after 70 min under UV-light irradiation and 86% of MB was degraded after 90 min under visible-light irradiation. Qian et al. synthesized a visible light-responsive MOF Cu-17 with a 4-coordinated 3D CdSO4 topology and formula, {[Cu(L82)(L68)]·2H2O}n, using tris[4-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl]amine (L68) and succinic acid (H2L82).171 The bandgap for Cu-17, obtained by the extrapolation of the linear portion of the absorption edges, was 2.30 eV, revealing its potential semiconducting nature. The percentage degradation of MB reached 92.6% after 75 min and that of RhB reached 90.3% after 120 min in the presence of H2O2. Another acid–base resistant paddle-wheel MOF Cu-18, {[Cu(L83)(H2O)]·0.25(CH3CN)}n (where, H2L83 = 4,4′-dicarboxy-4′′-nitrotriphenylamine), with rich Cu(II) open metal sites (OMSs), had been constructed by Yang and co-workers.173 Interestingly, Cu-18 showed visible-light harvesting capability, which arises because of the joint contribution of both the organic linkers and metal ions together with their synergism. Also, the optical bandgap obtained from the Tauc plot was estimated to be 2.26 eV, showing its semiconductor nature. Cu-18 displayed notable visible-light photocatalytic activity for degrading organic dyes and about 97.2% of CV, 92.1% of R6G, 87.8% of CR, and 70.2% of BR2 got decomposed in 40 min upon the addition of H2O2 to the reaction mixture. Qian et al. synthesized hexa-coordinated self-catenated MOF Cu-19, which possesses a 3D architecture based on the [Cu2(COO)4] paddlewheel unit and possesses the formula [Cu(L84)0.5(L85)]n (where L84 = 1,4-bis(2-methyl-imidazol-1-yl-methyl)benzene and H2L85 = glutaric acid).174 The MOF exhibited a bandgap of 1.70 eV, which suggested its semiconductor nature. With Cu-19, the percentage degradation of RhB reached 90.3% after 165 min in the presence of H2O2 under UV light illumination. Further, a series of Cu MOFs for the efficient photo-degradation of dyes, namely, MB, RhB, and MO, along with H2O2 under visible light irradiation, has been reported by Shi's group.174 The compositions of the MOFs were {[Cu4(OH)2(L84)2(L86)2(H2O)2]·3H2O}n (Cu-20), [Cu2(L84)(L63)2]n (Cu-21), [Cu2(L84)(L87)2]n (Cu-22), and {[Cu2(L84)(L88)2]·H2O}n (Cu-23) (where, H3L86 = 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid, H2L63 = isophthalic acid, H2L87 = 5-methyl-isophthalate, H2L88 = 1,4-benzenediacatate). All the four MOFs were semiconducting, with Eg of 2.21 eV (Cu-20), 2.35 eV (Cu-21), 2.41 eV (Cu-22), and 2.13 eV (Cu-23). The percentage degradation of MB reached 94.0% for Cu-20, 90.7% for Cu-21, 89.1% for Cu-22, and 91.6% for Cu-23 after irradiation for 90 min and that of RhB reached 93.0% for Cu-20, 84.7% for Cu-21, 81.3% for Cu-22, and 88.6% for Cu-23 after 180 min of irradiation. In addition, the percentage degradation of MO reached 92.7% for Cu-20, 85.1% for Cu-21, 77.2% for Cu-22, and 87.3% for Cu-23 after 300 min. A visible light responsive unusual (4,6)-coordinated Cu(II) MOF Cu-24 with the structural formula {[Cu(L89)(L63)][Cu4(OH)2(L89)(L63)3]·4H2O}n (where, L89 = 1-imidazol-1-yl-3-(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)propane) had been prepared by Zheng and co-workers.175 In presence of this MOF, the percentage degradation of MB, RhB, and MO reached 90.5%, 89.2%, and 87.8% after 90, 180, and 240 min, respectively, in the presence of H2O2. Another MOF Cu-25, ∞3[Cu6(CN)7(L90)2(OH3)] (where L90 = hexamethylenetetramine), was synthesized by Etaiw et al.176Cu-25 exhibited highly efficient photocatalytic performances for the degradation of CR, MV, and MB dyes under UV light and ultrasonic irradiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Under UV light irradiation, the percentage degradation of CR, MV, and MB dyes was 96.86, 98.92, and 99.31% within 8, 25, and 20 min, respectively. On the other hand, the application of ultrasonic irradiation on the dye–H2O2-Cu-25 system resulted in 97.09, 98.96, and 99.69% degradation of CR, MV, and MB dyes within 6, 18, and 15 min, respectively. Besides, the Cu-25 catalyst also degraded the CR dye in the presence of sunlight and H2O2 with a degradation rate of 91.08% within 45 min.
Zinc also represents a widely employed transition metal ion for the synthesis of MOFs, which can be employed as the photocatalysts. Recently, Dong's group developed a novel 2D Zn(II) MOF Zn-1, [Zn(L91)(H2O)]·H2O (H2L91 = 4 (pyridine-4-yl)phthalic acid), which degraded 98.5% of RhB and 83.8% of MO in 2 h under light irradiation without the addition of the auxiliary catalyst H2O2 (Fig. 11c and d).177 The asymmetric unit of this MOF contained one Zn(II) ion, one (L91)2− ligand, one aqua ligand, and a lattice water molecule. The geometry around each Zn(II) was quasi-triangular bipyramidal with a ZnO4N environment (Fig. 11a), in which carboxylate groups displayed bidentate μ2-η1:η1 and μ1-η1 coordination modes, the (L91)2− acid ligands were linked to adjacent Zn(II) ions to construct a two-dimensional layer. The 2D layers were interlinked into a three-dimensional framework through O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds (Fig. 11b). The bandgap was estimated to be 3.282 eV. Moreover, it exhibited almost unaltered photocatalytic efficiency after five consecutive reaction cycles, which make it a potent candidate for environment management.

Wang et al. reported a pillared-layer Zn-based MOF, NNU-36 having the formula [Zn2(L93)(L94)2]·2DMF (where L93 = 9,10-bis(4′-pyridylethynyl)-anthracene and L94 = 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylate). The MOF displayed broad-range visible light absorption and good chemical stability180 and possesses a bandgap of ∼2.28 eV and efficient photocatalytic performance for RhB degradation. Photocatalytic degradation by NNU-36 was significantly enhanced from 46.6% to 96% upon the addition of H2O2. This enhancement in the catalytic efficiency was credited to the suppression of recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs in the NNU-36 photocatalyst. Apart from these reports, varied classes of Zn-based MOFs have also been explored, namely, Zn-3, {[Zn(L95)]·2.7 DMF} (where H2L95 = 1,4 bis(triazol-1-yl)terephthalic acid), having 3D uninodal 4-connected CdSO4 topology.181 The MOF displayed 88.8% decomposition of RhB under UV irradiation. Also, another uncommon Zn-based MOF Zn-5, {[Zn5(L98)2(DMF)2(μ3-H2O)]·2DMF} was synthesized using a less utilized symmetrical pentacarboxylate ligand H5L98 = 3,5-di(3′,5′-dicarboxylphenyl)benzoic acid, which featured a trinodal (4,5,5)-connected topology having a Schläfli symbol of (42·63·8)(45·65)2(46·64).183 This Zn(II)-based MOF displayed 73.1% degradation of MV under UV irradiation. Another 3D MOF Zn-6, {[Zn4(L65)3.5(μ4-OH)(DMF)]·1.7DMF}n, was synthesized using 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (H2L65) ligand.184 The MOF possessed 7-connected [Zn4(μ4-OH)(COO)7] clusters, which were extended by (L65)2− ligands to yield an uncommon sev topology. It displayed promising photocatalytic degradation activity against MV with a percentage degradation of 78.3% after 40 min. Also, a representative example of biocompatible MOF Zn-7, {[Zn2(L99)2]·0.5H2O}n, which was constructed using phytochemical ligand, ferulic acid (H2L99), and this MOF, was utilized for the degradation of dyes.185 Interestingly, it exhibited extreme framework stability along with outstanding chemical stability. The photocatalytic results indicated that the MOF showed 88% photocatalytic efficiency against Rh-B in aqueous solution within 100 min under UV irradiation. Another MOF Zn-9, {[Zn2(L72)(DMF)3]·2DMF·2H2O}, was reported, which comprises of a symmetrical rigid ligand, terphenyl-3,3′′,5,5′′-tetracarboxylic acid (H4L72).186 The MOF displayed 3D uninodal 4-c lonsdaleite (lon) topology and exhibited conversion rates of 72.5% and 92.8% for MV and RhB under UV irradiation, respectively. Recently, a new Zn(II)-based MOF Zn-10 with composition [Zn(L18)(L28)4·2H2O]n had been constructed using 1,4-bis(3-carboxylbenzyl)piperazine acid (H2L18) ligand and ancillary ligand 4,4′-bipyridine (L28).187 The MOF possessed a three-fold interpenetrating 3D net with pcu topology and utilized as a potent UV light-irradiation driven photocatalyst for the decomposition of MV and degraded this dye up to 77.36% in 40 min.
Wang et al. developed an MOF Zn-11, [Zn(L100)(L101)2]n (where, H2L100 = 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid, and L101 = 2,4,5-tri(4-pyridyl)-imidazole).188 The photocatalytic activity of Zn-11 was evaluated by the degradation of RhB as the model pollutant under UV irradiation. Zn-11 exhibited a bandgap of 2.85 eV and the degradation ratio of RhB reached 98.1% after 240 min. Wei's group synthesized two Zn-MOFs having the formulae {[Zn(L103)(L104)]2}n (Zn-14) and {[Zn(L103)(L82)]2}n (Zn-15) (where, HL103 = 1,3-bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazol-1-yl)-2-propanol, H2L104 = trans,trans-muconic acid, and H2L82 = succinic acid).190 After 120 min, percentage degradation of 97.5% and 97.0% were attained for MB degradation under UV irradiation with Zn-14 and Zn-15 as the photocatalysts, respectively. Qiao's group synthesized MOF Zn-16, [Zn2L12]n, using semi-rigid 5-(bis(4-carboxybenzyl)amino)isophthalic acid (H4L12) ligand.122 The Eg value was estimated to be 2.32 eV; thus, Zn-16 showed good photocatalytic activity for MB degradation under visible light irradiation. After the irradiation time of 250 min, the MB degradation rate was 91.4%, employing Zn-16 as the photocatalyst.
Some Ag-based MOFs have been utilized as the dye degrading photocatalysts as presented in Table 1. Wang's group reported three sandwich-like Ag-based MOFs, Ag4(L28)4(L50)2·11H2O (Ag-1), Ag2(L41)2(L58)·2H2O (Ag-2), and [Ag2(L41)1.5(L105)0.5](L105)0.5·7H2O (Ag-3) (where, L28 = 4,4′-bipyridine, L50 = 5-aminoisophthalic acid, L41 = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene, H2L58 = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, and H2L105 = stilbenedicarboxylic acid).192 The Eg of complexes (Ag-1)–(Ag-3) was 3.2 eV, 3.2 eV, and 3.3 eV, respectively, which indicate their potential as photocatalysts under UV irradiation. All three MOFs had demonstrated the photocatalytic degradation of MB with the percentage of 98.2% for Ag-1, 99.8% for Ag-2, and 99.9% for Ag-3 after 180 min of UV light irradiation. Zhang et al. had reported that the ligand 5,5′-azotetrazolate of Ag(I)-tetrazole MOF Ag-5, [Ag2(en)2(L107)]n (en = ethylenediamine, L107 = 5,5′-azotetrazolate), was relevant in the design of active photocatalysts for R6G decomposition under UV irradiation.194 The R6G percentage degradation of Ag-5 was found to be 90.8%. The ligands with more delocalized p-electrons (such as ethylenediamine and 5,5′-tetrazolate) may reduce the bandgap of MOFs and favor the ligand → metal charge-transfer transitions, thereby resulting in higher degradation rates. In addition, the bandgap value obtained from the corresponding LMCT transition was estimated to be 2.12 eV. Li et al. reported MOF Ag-6, [Ag(HL63)(L108)]n containing H2L63 = isophthalic acid, L108 = 1,6-bis(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazol-1-yl)hexane ligands.195 The photocatalytic property for the degradation of MB under UV light illumination was assessed. The bandgap of Ag-6 was found to be 3.9 eV, indicating that it may be employed as a photocatalyst under UV irradiation. Ag-6 degraded about 95.9% of MB after 150 min.
Kulovi and colleagues synthesized a 3D MOF Ag-7, [Ag2(L41)2(L109)](H2O)5.4 (where, L41 = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene and H2L109 = 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid).196 The X-ray structural analysis revealed almost linear coordination chains with Ag atoms connected by the L41 linker. Further, two of these polymer chains were paired by the bridging 1,4-phenylendiacetato, which acted in an η3μ coordination mode and this type of pairing favored π–π interactions between py rings along the chain (Fig. 12a). Finally, these double chains were connected by numerous lattice water molecules to generate a 3D framework (Fig. 12b). A significantly high percentage degradation of MB (96%) in 75 min was achieved when the dye was irradiated with UV light in the presence of Ag-7 as the catalyst (Fig. 12c).

Some very pertinent examples of Cd-based MOFs that have been explored for the photodegradation of dyes are summarized in Table 1. For instance, Kaur's group synthesized a Cd-based MOF Cd-3, [Cd(L7)(L28)] (where, H2L7 = 2-aminoterephthalic acid and L28 = 4,4′-bipyridine).199 The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy indicated that Cd-3 possesses a bandgap of 2.8 eV, which imparted light absorption in the visible range. Notably, Cd-3 showed decent photocatalytic activity with 82% MB photodecomposed in 1.5 h under visible light irradiation and 72% MB degradation under UV light within the same period in the absence of photocatalytic enhancers such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO), KBrO3, and H2O2. Further, reaction under solvothermal conditions between W-shaped 1,3-di(2′,4′-dicarboxylphenyl)benzene (H4L115) and Cd(II) salt in the presence of ancillary bridging imidazole linkers (L116 = 1,3-bis(2-methylimidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene and L117 = 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene) afforded two MOFs, [(Cd2(L115)(L116)(H2O)0.5)·H2O]n (Cd-8) and [(Cd2(L115)(L117))·H2O]n (Cd-9).204 Both the MOFs displayed intense blue solid-state emission at room temperature, which indicated their good photoactive properties. The asymmetric unit of complex Cd-9 contained two Cd(II) ions, one (L115)4− ligand, two L117 ligands, and a lattice water molecule (Fig. 13a). Both Cd(1) and Cd(2) were hexa-coordinated, showing a similar distorted octahedral environment. The Cd(1) and two Cd(2) ions were bridged by eight carboxyl groups to generate uncommon tetranuclear {Cd4(COO)8} SBUs, which were further linked by the (L115)4− ligands to generate a two-dimensional bilayer (Fig. 13b). Lastly, the 2D [Cd2(L115)]n sheets were further expanded to generate a three-dimensional framework by linking the bridging L117 ligands (Fig. 13c). Both Cd-8 and Cd-9 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity with a percentage degradation of 99.5% for Cd-8 and 99.8% for Cd-9 towards methylene orange (MO) after 60 min in the presence of H2O2 under UV light. Thus, Cd-9 exhibited slightly better photocatalytic performance than Cd-8 (Fig. 13d).

Wu and co-workers constructed two 3D multinodal Cd(II)-organic frameworks with the formula [Cd3(L118)(L28)0.5(H2O)4]·5H2O (Cd-10) and [(CH3)2NH2]2[Cd11(L118)4(DMF)4(H2O)8]·4H2O (Cd-11) (where H6L118 = 3,4-di(3,5-dicarboxylphenyl)phthalic acid).204Cd-10 and Cd-11 possessed 3D 3-nodal (6,6,7)-connected framework with single trinuclear cluster and 4-nodal (5,6,6,10)-connected network with mixed trinuclear and pentanuclear clusters as the building units, respectively. The bandgap values of Cd-10 and Cd-11 were calculated to be 2.87 eV and 2.79 eV, respectively. Remarkably, the percentage photocatalytic decomposition of RhB was ca. 88.6% in the presence of Cd-10 and 91.5% with Cd-11. On the other hand, the percentage decomposition of MB was 86.5% when Cd-10 used as the catalyst and 92.3% in the presence of the catalytic amount of Cd-11 under visible light irradiation in the presence of H2O2. Kang and co-workers reported two Cd(II) MOFs, namely, {[Cd(L120)(L87)]·0.33H2O}n (Cd-15) and {[Cd(L121)(L122)]·1.35H2O}n (Cd-16) (where, H2L87 = 5-methylisophthalic acid; L120 = 1,5-bis(benzimidazol-1-yl)pentane; H2L122 = tetrachloroterephthalic acid; and L121 = 1,2-bis(2-methylbenzimidazol-1-yl)benzene).206 When the MB solution containing the photocatalyst Cd-15/Cd-16 was irradiated with UV light, the percent degradation ratio was found to be 89% for Cd-15 and 91.2% for Cd-16 after 120 min, respectively. El-bendary et al. prepared MOF Cd-17 with the formula [Cd(L14)2(NO3)2] using 1,10-phenanthroline (L14) ligand.207 The MOF was used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the photodecomposition of IC dye in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant under UV-light and direct natural sunlight irradiation. The percentage degradation was 77.83% and 98.06% under direct sunlight irradiation and UV-light irradiation, respectively, in the presence of Cd-17 within 50 min.
Thus, the presented discussion reveals that d-block or transition metal MOFs are widely used as photocatalysts. Their wide implementation as photocatalysts to photodegrade aromatic dyes may be attributed to their high chemical stability, environment-friendly features except for Cd(II)-based MOFs, low production costs, controllability of synthesis, and diversity of structures, which results in their good performance. Also, these classes of MOFs, in most of the cases, retain their structural framework integrity and hence can be recycled and used in fresh catalytic processes. In this section, we summarized some very interesting MOFs, which will pave a new path to the development of proficient MOF-based photocatalysts, namely, Co-based MOF and SCNU-Z2, which can degrade dyes in the dark. The development of such MOFs is highly indispensable to enhance the practical applicability of the MOFs. In addition, to maximize the use of solar energy, the construction of visible light active MOFs is urgently needed and this can be achieved by the rational selection of linkers and metal ions. For example, the highly conjugated organic linker such as H3L35 = biphenyl-3,4′,5-tricarboxylic acid, having two benzene rings, is likely to endow the complexes formed with potential optical properties. Furthermore, the presence of pendant azide (H2L40) and amine (H2L7 or H3L27) functionalities is expected to increase the availability of electrons in the framework because they essentially remain uncoordinated. Consequently, a lower amount of energy will be required for electronic transition from VB to the CB of the catalyst, thus making the catalyst responsive to visible light. Another ideal organic linker for the construction of visible-light-active MOFs via the pull–push effect is H2L83. The triphenylamine core of the H2L83 ligand is responsible for its hole carrying ability, which can easily lose one electron to generate the cationic free radical. Fortunately, the hydrophobic NO2-group of the ligand can also enhance the hydrolytic stability of the MOF materials. Further, the use of phytochemical ligands, namely, ferulic acid has developed a new platform for the construction of new biocompatible MOFs that can be used as catalysts for the photodegradation of dyes (Fig. 14). As far as the selection of metal ions is considered for the construction of MOF-based photocatalysts responding to visible light, the Cu(II) ion provides a perfect alternative. Generally, the Cu(II)-MOFs display significant visible-light absorption because of the d–d as well as LMCT transitions. Also, the redox-active Cu(II) ion facilitates electron–hole separation by trapping electrons transferred from the excited organic linker.

2.3.3. MOFs based on f-block metals. 
Lanthanide ions that generally exhibit high coordination numbers and flexible coordination modes have been extensively used for constructing MOFs. However, lanthanide MOFs (Ln-MOFs) have occasionally been studied for the photo-degradation of dyes.
Ren and colleagues synthesized an La(III)-based MOF, La-1 formulated as [La2(L123)3(H2O)2]n using visible light absorbing ligand, H2L123 = (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(anthracene-9,10-diyl)diacrylic acid.208 The asymmetric unit contained one crystallographically independent La(III) ion, three half of (L123)2− ligands, an aqua ligand, and one disordered DMF moiety. The La(III) ion is coordinated by nine oxygen atoms, eight derived from different (L123)2− ligands, and the last one derived from the aqua ligand (Fig. 15a), establishing a twisted tricapped triangular prismatic geometry. Two adjacent La(III) ions were connected through two carboxylate groups to create a binuclear cluster unit and the adjacent binuclear clusters were further connected through carboxylate groups to form an infinite 1D rod (Fig. 15b). Neighboring rods were further linked by bridging (L123)2− ligands, establishing the 3D infinite framework (Fig. 15c). The percentage degradation reached 91.2% within 120 min, indicating that it could be applied as a highly effective catalyst for degrading RhB in visible light (Fig. 15d). Pan et al. obtained 3D MOF La-2 with honeycomb cavities and the formula [La(HL124)3]n using rationally designed chalcone dicarboxylic acid ligand (H2L124).209 Notably, the conversion rates of MB and RhB solutions were 79% and 74%, respectively, after UV irradiation for 3 h. Two La(III)-based MOFs with 5-aminoisophthalic acid (H2L50), namely, [La(L50)1.5(H2O)]n (La-3) and {[La(L50)(L20)0.5(H2O)2](H2O)}n (La-4) with good photocatalytic performance were prepared by Wang et al.211 The percentage decomposition of RhB was approximately 81.6% with La-3 and 69.7% in the presence of La-4 after UV light exposure for 8 h. These results were following the Eg values for La-3 and La-4, which were estimated to be 2.72 and 3.06 eV, respectively. Etaiw's group reported La(III)-based MOF SCP 2, La-5, {[La(L6)3(H2O)2]}n.190 The percentage degradation of MB in the presence of nanosized SCP2 and H2O2 after 120 min was 80.55% under direct sunlight irradiation and 95.33% in UV-light irradiation. The Eg was calculated to be 4.039 eV for SCP2. Despite the high Eg value, SCP2 exhibited better MB degradation efficiency, which may be attributed to the structural differences arising due to the better complexing ability of isonicotinate ligand with both O- and N-donor sites. Besides, the nanoparticle size and the presence of electron acceptor H2O2 also play a vital part in enhancing the photocatalytic performance of SCP2.

Xia and co-workers demonstrated the rational synthesis of visible-light responsive Ln-MOF by employing an anthracene-derived dicarboxylate ligand, H2L125 = 4,4′-(diethynylanthracene-9,10-diyl)dibenzoic acid.211 The structural formula of Ce-based Ln-MOF is NNU-15(Ce) = [Ce(H2L125)1.5(H2O)(DMF)]·DMF. NNU-15(Ce) exhibited distorted square antiprism geometry with Ce(III) ion coordinated to eight oxygen atoms from six H2L125 ligands, one DMF, and one H2O (Fig. 16a). The adjacent Ce(III) ions linked through the bridging carboxylate groups generated 1D cerium-carboxylate chain along the a-axis. Further, the cerium-carboxylate chains constructed a 3D structure by interconnecting to each other through the organic ligands (Fig. 16c). NNU-15(Ce) showed broad-band visible-light absorption because it possesses highly conjugated H2L125 ligand and efficient photoinduced charge generation evidenced by SPV measurements. This Ln-MOF represented one of the first, highly efficient, and rare examples of visible light-driven photocatalysts for RhB degradation in the presence H2O2. Ce-MOF displayed the bandgap energy of ∼2.11 eV. NNU-15(Ce) degraded about 99% RhB within 12 min with a reaction rate constant of 0.2397 min−1 (Fig. 16f and g).

Du et al. synthesized a novel lanthanide–organic framework exhibiting a 3D porous architecture with (4,5)-c net, HU11 having the formula [Pr(L126)1.5(H2O)]·8H2O·3.5DMF (H2L126 = 2,3,5,6 tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid).212 As obtained by the measurement of the UV diffuse reflection spectrum, the Eg value of HU11 was about 3.3 eV, which is similar to that of the conventional photocatalyst TiO2 (Eg = 3.2 eV) and indicated its semiconductive behavior as a photocatalyst. Under irradiation by a xenon lamp, the photocatalytic degradation rate for Congo red was found to be approximately 100% in 24 h with the starting concentration of 220 mg L−1.
Liu and co-workers employed the molecular building blocks (MBBs) strategy to design and synthesize the anthracene-based MOF, Eu-1 having the formula [(CH3)2NH2]2[Eu6(OH)8(L127)6(H2O)6]·(DMF)15 (H2L127 = 4,4′-(9,10-anthracenediyl)dibenzoic acid) and fcu topology.214 Eu-ADBA exhibited extended visible light absorption because of the presence of an extensively conjugated anthracene group. The bandgap was estimated to be ∼2.35 eV, which is considerably lower than that of conventional photocatalytic materials such as TiO2 (∼3.2 eV) or ZnO (∼3.2 eV). Eu-1 presented H2O2-assisted outstanding photocatalytic performances with a percentage degradation of 99% in 30 min for MB and 98% in 36 min for RhB. Further, the conversion rates of MB solution for Eu-2, [Eu(HL124)3] (chalcone dicarboxylic acid ligand (H2L124)) was 72% after irradiation for 3 h.210 This difference in the photocatalytic activity of Eu-based MOFs Eu-1 and Eu-2 towards MB removal may be due to the existence of highly conjugated anthracene ligand in Eu-ADBA, which not only decreases the bandgap of the resultant MOF but also leads to broad-range visible light absorption and hence the excellent degradation performance.
Recently, a highly efficient Gd-based 3D microporous framework Gd-1, {[Gd(L128)1.5(H2O)2]·2H2O}n has been reported having the rigid dicarboxylate ligand N,N′-dioxide-3,3′-benzocinnoline dicarboxylic acid (H2L128).215 The crystal structure of the Gd-based MOF revealed that each asymmetric unit consisted of one Gd(III) ion, one and a half L128 ligands, two aqua ligands, and two H2O molecules in the lattice. The coordination geometry around the Gd center was distorted bicapped trigonal prism. Each Gd(III) was found to be octa-coordinated with two terminal oxygens from two H2O and six oxygens from six independent bidentate bridging carboxylates at the same time to form a chain-like SBU along the c direction (Fig. 17b). The MOF possessed a microporous framework with 1D parallelogram-like channels constructed by single rod-shaped {Gd(CO2)2}n chains (Fig. 17c–e). The energy bandgap (Eg) of 2.68 eV indicated its semiconducting nature and also its ability to exhibit the absorption of UV radiation. This MOF was demonstrated to decompose approximately 95% RhB within 45 min (Fig. 17f). Another Gd-based MOF for RhB removal was Gd-2, Gd(H(L124)3), which exhibited the conversion rates of 72% after irradiation for 3 h. Such a significant variation in the activities of the Gd MOFs may be due to different ligands involved in the synthesis. Also, N,N′-dioxide-3,3′-benzocinnoline dicarboxylic acid possesses the potential to produce the active ˙OH species, which initiates photocatalytic activities in the MOFs to degrade the aromatic dyes.

Xia and co-workers synthesized another visible-light responsive Ln-MOF having the structural formula NNU-15(Tb) = {[Tb(H2L125)1.5(H2O)2(DMF)]·2DMF} using an anthracene-derived dicarboxylate ligand, H2L125 = 4,4′-(diethynylanthracene-9,10-diyl)dibenzoic acid.211 Tb-MOF displayed the bandgap energy of ∼2.20 eV. NNU-15(Tb) degraded about 90% RhB under 60 min visible light illumination in the presence H2O2 with the estimated rate constant of 0.0404 min−1 (Fig. 16i). Ren and co-workers reported an MOF Tb-1 [Tb(L5)(L129)]n (where, L5 = 2-(2-carboxyphenyl)imidazo(4,5-f)-(1,10)phenanthroline and H2L129 = adipic acid).215 The Eg of Tb-1 was calculated to be 1.72 eV. Further, the photocatalytic experiment results manifest that after the irradiation time of 370 min, the MB degradation rate was 81.2% with Tb-1 as the photocatalyst. Wang and co-workers reported another Tb(III)-based MOFs formulated as [Tb2(L65)0.5(L65)0.5(L65)0.5(L65)0.5(L65)0.5(L65)0.5(DMA)]n (Tb-2) and [Tb(L130)0.5(L130)0.5(L130)0.5(DMF)]n (Tb-3) employing different bulky backbone ligands H2L65 = naphthalene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid, H2L130 = anthracene-9,10-dicarboxylic acid.217 When exposed to UV light for 6 h, the decomposition rates of RhB were approximately 92.8% for Tb-2 and 89.2% for Tb-3 (Fig. 18). The bandgap for Tb-2 and Tb-3 was calculated to be 3.14 and 3.04 eV, respectively. These results indicated that besides optical absorption, many structural factors such as the morphology of the sample, number of activated sites, and voids also affect the photocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the difference in the ligands resulted in different topologies as Tb-2 possessed a 3D (4,4,6)-connected {42·84}{44·62}2{48·66·8}2 topology while Tb-3 exhibited 3D NaCl-style 41263 topology framework. Of the three RhB mineralizing Tb-based MOFs discussed above, NNU-15(Tb) appeared to be the most active MOF for the photodegradation of RhB due to the presence of anthracene-derived ligand with highly extended conjugation, which imparted the resultant MOF with a low bandgap value, broad visible light absorption, and consequently, better dye-degrading ability.

Dy-Based MOF with the formula NNU-15(Dy) = [Dy(H2L125)1.5(H2O)2(DMF)]·2DMF has been demonstrated by Xia's group as visible-light radiation responsive photocatalyst for RhB degradation in the presence H2O2.211 Dy-MOF displayed a bandgap energy of 2.15 eV. About 95% RhB could be degraded by NNU-15(Dy) in 25 min with a reaction rate constant of 0.1020 min−1 (Fig. 16h).
Wang et al. synthesized three Yb(III)-based MOFs having formulae [Yb(L8)1.5(DMF)]n (Yb-1), [Yb(L131)0.5(NO3)(DMF)2]n (Yb-2), and [Yb(L130)0.5(L130)0.5(NO3)(DMF)(H2O)]n (Yb-3) with different ligands having bulky backbones, namely, H2L8 = terephthalic acid, H4L131 = 5,5′-(diazene-1,2-diyl)diisophthalic acid, and H2L130 = anthracene-9,10-dicarboxylic acid.217 The decomposition rates of RhB were observed to be approximately 85.8% for Yb-1, 96.5% for Yb-2, and 96.9% for Yb-3 on UV light exposure for 6 h. Particularly for Yb-2, the degradation ratio of RhB reached 93.9% in merely 3 h (Fig. 19c and d). Single-crystal X-ray revealed that the asymmetric unit of Yb-2 comprised of one Yb(III) ion, half a L131 ligand, one NO3− ion, and two DMF molecules, making each Yb(III) center octa-coordinated (Fig. 19a). The adjacent Yb(III) ions were linked through carboxylate bridges to form a dinuclear [Yb2(COO)2(NO3)2(DMF)4] unit. These dinuclear entities were further assembled to yield a three-dimensional network (Fig. 19b) by L131 ligands in a “chelating-bridging–chelating-bridging” coordination mode. The bandgap of 4.05, 3.13, and 4.28 eV were obtained for (Yb-1)–(Yb-3), respectively, revealing the better degrading ability of Yb-2. The different performances of the aforementioned Yb-based MOFs may have resulted from the difference in the ligand backbones, which in turn resulted in different topologies. The carboxylate functionals of H2L8 displayed bis-bridging coordination modes in Yb-1 and those of the H4L131 ligand showed “chelating-bridging–chelating-bridging” coordination modes in Yb-2 while those of the H2L130 ligand displayed bis-chelating coordination modes or bis-bridging coordination modes in Yb-3.223

Although actinide-based MOFs for the degradation of dyes have not witnessed much attention due to the presence of the unique UO double bonds, uranyl complexes are known to exhibit photocatalytic activity, which is a typical property of uranyl compounds. Liang et al. constructed an MOF U-1 with the structural formula [(UO2)5(H2O)3(H3O)(L132)( HL132)]·8H2O employing a flexible hexapodal ligand 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triaminohexaacetic acid (H6L132).218 Under the illumination of UV light, the RhB dye decreased rapidly in the presence of the uranium-based complex and about 92.9% dye was degraded after 120 min. Hou et al. synthesized two uranyl coordination complex, (UO2)2(L67)(DMA)2 (U-2) and [(UO2)2(L67)(μ3OH2)]·2[HN(CH3)2]·H2O (U-3) (where, H4L67 = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid), exhibiting a 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional framework for U-2 and U-3, respectively, with p-type semiconductor characteristics.219 The RhB solution of U-2 became nearly colorless after about 130 min of the reaction under UV irradiation, indicating the completion of the decomposition process but the decomposition process of complex U-3 had not finished even half until 160 min. This discrepancy could be caused by the structural differences between U-2 and U-3, with MOF U-2 having a mononuclear structure and U-3 having a multinuclear structure. The authors concluded that as compared to the multinuclear structure, uranyl complexes with mononuclear centers were favored the photocatalytic reaction more as they make the uranyl center relatively spread around so that the RhB molecules could completely contact with the oxo-group of the uranyl center. However, the RhB molecule could not contact the uranyl center because of the increased steric hindrance in the tetranuclear structure in complex U-3.
Si et al. reported a U-based MOF U-4, [UO2(L133)(H2O)]·H2O (where H2L133 = 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid).220 As shown in Fig. 20a, the U-center was coordinated by seven oxygen atoms derived from uranyl aqua and (L133)2− anion and one nitrogen atom from the (L133)2− anion, forming a pentagonal bipyramidal chromophore. The two adjacent U-centers were connected by (L133)2− to yield the dinuclear uranyl unit [(UO2)2(L133)2], which were further bridged by two aqua oxygens to generate a ribbon-like chain. The two neighboring 1D chains are linked to each other via O–H⋯O interactions to produce two-dimensional layers. Finally, each 2D layer was linked through aromatic stacking to complete the 3D supramolecular framework (Fig. 20b). The degradation rate of MB was found to be 84.4%, 92.4%, and 100% under the irradiation of 165 W, 330 W, and 500 W Hg-lamp in 90 min (Fig. 20c), respectively, therefore revealing that the degradation efficiency of the catalyst increased with the Hg lamp power. The periodic UV-vis spectra of MB during the decomposition reaction under Hg-lamp irradiation in the presence of 10 mg of the MOF showed a significant decline in the UV-vis absorption intensity of the dye in 1.5 h (Fig. 20d).

To establish MOFs as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for various reactions, judicious choice of the Lewis acidic or basic sites, Brønsted acid sites, and redox-active sites on the SBUs and/or the organic linkers are important. Photocatalytic dye degradation usually takes place in water or even in acidic/basic or redox conditions; hence, MOF-based catalysts should be capable of tolerating such conditions. In addition, the design of visible light active MOFs is required to maximize the use of solar energy, which could be achieved by the apt selection of linkers and the metal ions. From Table 1, it is clear that MOFs with various metals are active for the removal of dyes from water via photocatalytic decomposition. Among MOFs, 3-d metal, i.e., Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn-based MOFs are found to be most studied for the photolytic decomposition of dyes. This may be attributed to their low-cost, higher stability of the coordination framework due to the hard–hard interaction between the carboxylate linkers and these metal ions/clusters, and the catalytic behavior of Co, Ni, and Cu metal centers and their clusters or SBUs. From Table 1, it is also observed that there is no direct correlation between the catalytic performance and energy bandgap of the metal organic framework. This may be due to the possibility of a different mechanism for the photocatalytic process, which is discussed later in section 4. Organic linkers with π-conjugated backbones are highly desirable for high performance towards the degradation of the dye because of their visible light response, which constitutes a major part of the solar spectrum.

3. Characterization of MOFs
There are several analytical, spectroscopic, diffraction, and electrochemical methods for the characterization of metal–organic frameworks.
3.1 Single crystal X-ray diffraction
Single crystal X-ray diffraction study is the main characterization tool to elucidate the structure of metal–organic frameworks. Most important step in this characterization technique is to grow the single-crystal suitable for X-ray diffraction. Due to its polymeric nature, the solubility of MOFs is usually very poor in any solvent; hence, recrystallization is out of scope to get their crystals. Single crystals of MOFs are usually formed in situ by hydrothermal reaction between the metal salt/precursors and the ligand. A powdered sample of a known MOF can be characterized by matching the profile of the powder X-ray diffraction of the prepared sample with that of the standard sample.
3.2 SEM and TEM study
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) helps to elucidate the particle size and morphology of the MOFs. The SEM images can demonstrate the dispersity (poly-/mono-dispersity) and unusual particle morphology of the MOF crystals. From EDS analysis equipped with SEM analysis, it may be possible to get information about the composition of the sample in the bulk as well as the localized positions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also helpful to elucidate the particle size and composition of the MOFs. Also, the pore size and pore structure can be visualized using TEM analysis.
3.3 BET adsorption isotherm analysis
BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) adsorption isotherm provides information about the pore size, pore volume, and surface area available for the adsorption of gas molecules. This study is very useful for the application of metal–organic framework as a potential platform for gas storage and separation. Also, BET adsorption can elucidate whether the MOF is meso-/micro-/nanoporous.
3.4 Thermogravimetric analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is not only an important technique to elucidate the thermal stability of metal–organic frameworks but also to determine the number of solvent molecules trapped in the framework of MOFs. Using this technique, the temperature required to remove the solvent/unreacted organic linker can also be determined.
3.5 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy usually provides information about the functional groups in organic molecules. In MOFs, this spectroscopic method provided information about the functional group associated with the organic linker as well as about the mode of binding of the carboxylate group. For instance, Chen and co-workers reported that in the FTIR spectrum of MOFs, there is no strong carbonyl peak at ∼1710 cm−1. This is according to the fact that the carboxyl anions can form π35 after the formation of the carboxylate. The oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group are equivalent and lead to a delocalized electronic cloud, and the presence of characteristic carboxylate peaks in the ranges of 1610–1550 cm−1 and 1420–1300 cm−1.224
3.6 X-ray absorption spectroscopy
X-ray absorption spectroscopy including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy usually amplify the information about the local atomic and electronic structure of the metal–organic framework provided by other methods (electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and optical spectroscopy).225,226
3.7 UV-visible spectroscopy
UV-visible spectroscopy is an important tool to predict the nature of electronic transition or the charge transfer process in metal–organic frameworks, e.g., metal-centered d–d or f–f transition, intra-ligand charge transition (ILCT), metal-to-ligand charge transition (MLCT), ligand-to-metal charge transition (LMCT), or ligand-to-ligand charge transition (LLCT). In addition, the bandgap between the valence band and the conduction band of any material can be determined using this technique. Other applications of UV-visible spectroscopy include chemical sensors and the study of the kinetics of any reaction involving color change with time, for e.g., dye degradation.
Besides all these common methods, several other tools are also used in the characterization of metal–organic frameworks, for e.g., various electrochemical methods, electronic emission spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and atomic force microscopy.
4. Mechanism of photocatalysis
The photocatalytic phenomenon relies on the efficiency of the photocatalyst, which in turn depends on the appropriate balance amongst charge separation, charge recombination, and interfacial electron transfer. Charge separation depends on the bandgap and it is observed that the small Eg values favor electron transition, which in turn may be advantageous for photocatalysis. Another parameter is the density of state (DOS), which provides information about the stability of the electron–hole pair formed by the photoexcitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. There are two basic mechanisms for the photodegradation of dyes over photocatalysts, namely, direct photodegradation and sensitization-mediated degradation process.
4.1 Direct photodegradation process/advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)
Generally, the direct photodegradation process/advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) contribute to the MOF-catalyzed photodegradation of dyes via different mechanistic pathways (Fig. 21).
 Fig. 21  Schematic representation of reactive oxidant species generation and dye oxidation via different AOPs after the irradiation of an MOF-based photocatalyst in aqueous solution. 
For establishing a plausible mechanistic path for the MOF-assisted photodegradation of aromatic dyes, the band structure calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for various MOF-based photocatalysts. The outcome of the DFT calculations, i.e., DOS and partial DOS (pDOS) plots, provide an insight into the different moieties contributing to the valence band as well as the conduction band. These band structure calculations suggested that the electronic transitions in the MOF operate from ligand-to-ligand or ligand-to-metal (Fig. 22).181,183–185 However, mostly, the photocatalytic properties displayed by the MOFs are considered to be achieved by ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) within the MOFs involving electron transfer from the photoexcited organic ligand, which serves as an optical absorber, to the metal through the antenna effect. As the MOF is excited on irradiation (UV/visible/natural sunlight/ultrasonic), electron (e−)–hole (h+) pairs are formed on the catalyst surface, which is presumably the initial process of aromatic dye degradation. Irradiated by photons with energy equal to or greater than the bandgaps of MOFs, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs separate when the photoinduced electrons (e−) are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), leaving the same amount of positive-charged holes (h+) in the valence band (eqn (1)). The widely accepted view according to the energy band theory is that the HOMO contributed by the oxygen and/or nitrogen 2p bonding orbital of the organic linkers in the MOF is the main contributor in the valence band (VB) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) contributed by the empty metal orbital of the metallic cluster plays the role of the conduction band (CB) for MOF-based semiconductors.119,147 This viewpoint may be attributed to the fact that for most extensively studied MOF-based semiconductors, the metal ions are either in their higher valence (e.g., Fe(III) in MIL-53(Fe) and Zr(IV) in UiO-66)227,228 or in a very stable valence (e.g., Zn(II) in MOF-5)229 to restrict the loss of electrons from these metal ions. However, the situation is probably reversed in the case of CuTz-1, where Cu ions or Cu5Tz6 clusters probably behave as VB, while triazole ligands function as CB because CuTz-1 comprises solely Cu(I) clusters in the framework, which could be oxidized to Cu(II).230 Further, to return to the steady-state, the photoexcited and electron-deficient HOMO (holes) undergo (a) reaction with hydroxyl anions (OH−) to generate hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) for further oxidation reaction (eqn (2)); (b) oxidation of H2O molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) (eqn (3)); or (c) direct oxidation/decomposition of adsorbed organic dye molecules into CO2, H2O, or other small molecules owing to their strong oxidation ability (eqn (9)). MOF + hν → h+VB + e−CB(1) h+VB + OH− → ˙OH(2) h+VB + H2O → ˙OH + H+(3)

Meanwhile, photoexcited electrons in the conduction band can be trapped by dissolved molecular oxygen in aqueous solution and reduce to superoxide radicals (˙O2−) (eqn (4)), and eventually, they can transform to hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) by combining to H+ (eqn (5)–(8)). It is worth mentioning here that for the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the catalyst to the adsorbed molecular oxygen, the value of ECB of the MOF must be relatively more negative than the redox potential of O2/˙O2− (−0.33 eV vs. NHE). Then, ˙O2− could actively react with H2O to generate ˙OH. Both hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and superoxide radicals (˙O2−) possess strong oxidizing capacity to degrade surface adsorbed organic molecules to carbon dioxide and water and some small molecules (eqn (9)). e−CB + O2 → ˙O2−(4) ˙O2− + 2H+ → ˙OH + OH−(5) ˙O2− + H+ → ˙OOH(6) 2˙OOH → O2 + H2O2(7) H2O2 + hν → 2˙OH(8) h+VB/˙OH/˙O2− + Dye → oxidation products (CO2 + H2O + small molecules)(9)
To hinder the e−–h+ pair recombination effectively and thus to accelerate the degradation process, H2O2, which is a better electron acceptor as compared to O2 molecule, is incorporated into the photocatalytic medium to enhance the production of ·OH radicals (eqn (10)–(12)). Also, h+ reacts with H2O2 molecules to yield ˙OH radicals. H2O2 + hν → 2˙OH(10) e−CB + H2O2 → ˙OH + OH−(11) ˙O2− + H2O2 → ˙OH + OH− + O2(12)
However, several MOFs are not stable in the presence of H2O2/˙OH due to their high oxidizing tendency. In addition, the photocatalytic reactions are also carried out under ultrasonic irradiation [)))] in which the generation of ˙OH radicals occurs via water splitting according to eqn (13)–(15).125,177,231 H2O + ))) → ˙H + ˙OH(13) ˙OH + ˙OH → H2 + O2(14) ˙H + O2 → ˙HO2(15)
Further, some MOFs are reported to degrade dyes by employing H2O2-assisted ultrasound.125,177 The decomposition of H2O2 in the reaction medium on ultrasonic irradiation proceeds according to the following eqn231 H2O2 → 2˙OH(16) H2O2 + ˙OH → ˙HO2 + H2O(17)
Besides H2O2, Na2S2O8 has also been used as an electron acceptor to enhance the pollutant degradation efficiency significantly.120 The MOFs are supposed to catalyze persulfate (S2O82−) to produce more strongly oxidizing sulfate radicals (SO4˙) in the photo-Fenton-like process via the following equations. M2+ + S2O82− → M3+ + SO42− + SO4˙−(18) M3+ + S2O82− → M2+ + 2SO4˙−(19) SO4˙− + Dye → degradation products(20)
From the above discussion, it can be concluded that h+VB, ˙OH, and ˙O2− are the active species involved in the MOF-based photocatalysis process. To gain insights into the photocatalytic mechanism and to ascertain the main active species, several different scavengers/quenchers are introduced in the photocatalytic system, such as Na2EDTA/triethanolamine (TEOA)/ammonium oxalate (AO) as h+VB quenchers, tertiary butanol (t-BuOH)/mannitol as ˙OH quenchers, and benzoquinone (BQ)/nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT)/L-ascorbic acid as the ˙O2− quenchers. These scavengers consume the active species and thus affect the MOF photocatalytic efficiency so that the removal ratio of the dye descends significantly (Fig. 23a).

(c) ESR spectra of [Cu(H2L30)(L28)0.5(H2O)] for DMPO–˙O2− (reproduced with permission from ref. 8, copyright 2019 Royal Society of Chemistry). 
Also, it is well established that ˙OH radicals undergo reaction with terephthalic acid (H2L8) in alkaline medium to produce 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (H2L134), which produces a unique emission band at ca. 426 nm.156,163,177 The amount of generated ˙OH radicals can be qualitatively identified by observing the intensity of the TAOH fluorescence signal (Fig. 23b). Also, the existence of ˙O2− radicals can be confirmed by conducting an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy spin-trap technique using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as the trapping reagent.8,134,181 The DMPO–˙O2− adduct gives rise to ESR characteristic signals, confirming the presence of ˙O2− in the photocatalytic system (Fig. 23c).
4.2 Sensitization-mediated degradation process
It is found that in several MOFs/semiconductors, when the bandgap is not low enough to absorb in the visible range, the photodegradation might occur via the photosensitization process.232–235 In this process, the dye absorbs visible radiation by the excitation of electrons from the HOMO level to the LUMO level. If the energy level of the LUMO of the dye is higher than the CB of the semiconductor, these photoexcited electrons can get transferred from the LUMO of the dye molecules to the CB of the MOFs/semiconductors. Further, the process involved in the photodegradation of dyes over the MOFs involves steps similar to advanced oxidation processes,233 for e.g., photoexcited electrons in the CB of MOF can be transferred to molecular oxygen dissolved in aqueous solution and may reduce it to superoxide radicals (˙O2−) (Fig. 24). ˙O2− could react with H+/H2O/H2O2 and are eventually transformed to hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). The strong oxidizing capacity of both hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and superoxide radicals (˙O2−) may result in the degradation of the surface adsorbed dye molecules to carbon dioxide and water and some other small molecules.

From both the above-mentioned mechanisms for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes (direct photodegradation process/advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) or sensitization mediated degradation process), it is established that photocatalytic decomposition mainly occurs through the formation of radicals such as ˙O2− and ˙OH. Although, there are very few reports dealing with the detailed mechanistic study of the decomposition of dyes over MOFs.48,58 However, based on studies on the photocatalytic decomposition of dyes over other semiconducting materials, the proposed mechanism for decomposition involves the formation of various radicals, followed by conversion to some simple carboxylic acid and finally to carbon dioxide and water along with some low molecular weight compound (Scheme 2). The possibility of different degradation mechanisms for the same dyes over different MOFs or the same MOFs having different degradation mechanisms for different dyes is inevitable. The pathway for degradation is mainly dependent on the bandgap of the metal–organic framework, which led to different mechanisms for the formation of active radical species. Not only the bandgap but the pore size, volume, and structure of SBU are also important for deciding the pathway of decomposition of the dyes.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
In this perspective, we have focused on the application of MOFs as efficient catalysts for the photochemical decomposition of dyes for the decontamination of water. Highly-stable, low-cost, highly-porous, and photochemically-active MOFs are required for practical applications. Based on this, we focused the perspective on the synthetic strategies to prepare MOFs with desired properties and their characterization by various analytical tools. We also tried to establish the structure–property correlation between the MOF structures as well as the catalytic performance. A detailed section about the mechanistic pathways has also been included. We have attempted to present an up-to-date overview of this rapidly growing field of research. This subject area is very active and many papers are published every year (even during the preparation of this perspective) by chemists, physical, and materials scientists. Therefore, there is possibility that some significant contribution has been left out. MOFs have always been a hot topic of research among scientists due to their potential in a wide range of applications including the photocatalytic degradation of recalcitrant organic contaminants dumped into wastewater. Organic dyes represent one of the major classes of contaminants that are spewed in the water stream by industrial plants and their sustainable removal is still a formidable challenge. The MOF-assisted photocatalytic degradation of dyes has emerged as a clean and economic technique for the effective mineralization of dyes into water, CO2, etc., without causing secondary pollution. Amongst various synthetic processes employed for the synthesis of MOFs, the hydrothermal approach has proved to be a green and cost-effective synthetic process due to the application of water as the solvent. The MOF designed to be used as the photocatalyst must possess light-harvesting properties, especially visible light-absorbing abilities, to maximize the utilization of solar energy. The majority of the reported MOF-based photocatalysts are UV light-responsive because of the wide bandgap values. However, the visible light response is highly desirable as it constitutes a major part of the solar spectrum. This can be achieved by using organic linkers with π-conjugated backbones, which result in a redshift in the absorption spectrum due to the enhanced delocalization of electrons. The electron-donating groups in the linker behave as the antenna and improve the light-harvesting capacities by extended conjugation through their lone pair of electrons and can also accelerate the charge transfer kinetics subsequently. Also, electron-rich metal centers such as metal oxides can promote photocatalysis by reducing the bandgap. Further, the stability of the MOF in the presence of H2O2 as well as various radical species formed during the dye degradation process is also a very important factor to be dealt with to develop an efficient catalyst that can be reused several times without any significant loss in the activity. The stability largely depends on the binding ability of the linkers to the metal clusters, which in turn is governed by the anchors present in the organic ligand. The COOH group has proved to be the best anchor for constructing MOFs along with accelerated electron transfer rate. It is well known that the efficiency of the catalysts increases with an increase in the surface area and the photocatalyst with smaller particle size promotes the catalytic performance by suppressing the electron–hole pair recombination. Thus, it is required to prepare nanosized MOFs with enhanced performance and even NMOFs have been prepared by some research groups and explored for the photodegradation of dyes and have displayed better performance as compared to the bulk material. For the real-life application of MOFs in wastewater streams for dye degradation, it must be capable of sustaining in environments of varying pH. Thus, robust MOFs with an appreciable resistance towards acids, bases, and various organic solvents are of urgent need and can be developed by the rational selection of metal ions, organic ligands, and post-synthetic protocols. It is worth noting that mostly reported MOF-based photocatalysts have exhibited good photocatalytic activity against dye degradation in the presence of H2O2. However, excess use of H2O2 during the wastewater treatment process is not recommended from the economic as well as environmental point-of-view. Hence, it is very essential to develop MOF-based photocatalysts that exhibit enhanced photocatalytic efficiency without the aid of H2O2 or any other enhancer. Although some MOFs having p- and f-block metal ions have displayed very good photocatalytic activities for dye degradation, however, this class of MOFs is still at an immature stage and needs much more attention. In addition, it will be beneficial to construct photocatalysts with suitable bandgaps that enable them to respond towards different types of irradiations such as UV/visible/sunlight/ultrasonic simultaneously to widen the range of applications. However, a few MOFs have displayed responses towards different light sources but there is still a wide scope for research. Further, the presence of a light source is an essential prerequisite for photocatalysis but if this requirement is cut down by developing MOFs active in darkness, then it will be a milestone in the area of environmental remediation using MOFs. At the present time, only one MOF has been reported to degrade dye in darkness and researchers need to pay extensive attention to develop more such amazing MOF-based catalysts. To improve the practicability of the MOF-based photocatalysts, it is desirable to develop high-efficiency MOFs that can degrade various types of dyes, two or more dyes simultaneously, even in the presence of other pollutants in a smaller time limit without the assistance of any electron acceptor in the presence of natural sunlight or dark. Most important of all these criteria is the mechanistic pathway by which the photochemical decomposition of dyes can occur. Mechanistic insights are very important to establish the structural–activity correlation to synthesize highly active and for the practical applicability of MOFs in dye removal.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  Structure of dyes used as the substrate for photocatalytic decomposition over metal–organic frameworks.	 

 	Fig. 1  Different water decontamination technologies and processes related to metal–organic frameworks.	 

 	Fig. 2  Different approaches and synthetic conditions largely used for MOF preparation. Reproduced with permission from ref. 56 and 57. Copyright 2017, Wiley-VCH, copyright 2020 Elsevier.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a and b) Frontier electron density of unsubstituted MIL-125: (a) the valence band is composed of the benezene-1,4-dicarboxylate C 2p orbitals (shown on the right), making these favorable for linker-based bandgap modifications; (b) the conduction band is composed of O 2p orbitals and Ti 3d orbitals (shown on the right), suggesting that the modifications of the aromatic benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate units are unlikely to affect the CB. Isovalue = 0.001 e Å−3. (c) PBEsol band structures for synthetic MIL-125 (black), 10%-MIL-125-NH2 (blue), 10%-MIL-125-(NH2)2/90%-MIL-125-NH2 (orange), and the theoretical 10%-MIL-125-(NH2)2 (green). The orange bands, which have been truncated to improve the clarity of the band structures, maintain flat characteristics. The enlarged section emphasizes the VB-1…12 of the 11 nondegenerate monoamine bands. The energies are adjusted such that the highest occupied non-amine band is at 0 eV. The changes in the occupied VBs are depicted by the arrows. PBEsol is a qualitative approach; the band structures could not be computed at the HSE06 level of theory because of the system size. (d) HSE06-calculated VB and CB energies of MIL-125-NH2 models containing increasing numbers of 2-amino-benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate linkers [i.e., 0 (MIL-125) to 12 (100%-MIL-125-NH2)] per unit cell. The degree of amination does not affect the bandgap. (e) HSE06-predicted bandgaps of MIL-125 (black) and its analogous containing functionalized benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate linkers with 10% substitution (i.e., one functionalized linker per unit cell).
