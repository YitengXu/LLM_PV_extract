    , Accepted 21st June 2017First published on 11th July 2017AbstractIn this work, a novel catalyst based on the polydopamine (PDA)–Mn3O4 composite was synthesized and optimized by varying PDA and Mn3O4 loadings. PDA was used to immobilize Mn3O4 nanoparticles due to its abundant functional groups and self-polymerization properties. Bifunctional PDA acts as not only a bridge between Mn3O4 nanoparticles and graphite felt (GF) but also a catalyst for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. The composite electrocatalyst significantly improves the electrochemical performance of GF on which the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction tends to be sluggish. Interestingly, it was found that there was a synergistic effect in the PDA–Mn3O4 composite which resulted in better electrochemical catalytic activity than pure PDA or pure Mn3O4. The electrochemical kinetics of the optimum PDA–Mn3O4 GF with 4 h PDA polymerization time and 50 ppm Mn3O4 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and the results showed that the diffusion coefficient of PDA–Mn3O4 GF was approximately twice that of blank GF. As expected, the optimum composite GF exhibited substantially improved performance in the vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) single cell test. The electrolyte utilization of the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 GF was 94% while that of the VRFB with blank GF was 85%. The voltage efficiency (VE) and energy efficiency (EE) of the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 GF were increased by 5.9% and 5.2%, respectively at high current density (150 mA cm−2) compared to those of blank GF due to the synergistic effect of PDA–Mn3O4 GF. Moreover, PDA–Mn3O4 GF showed outstanding stability in both the stability test and VRFB single cell operation due to the strong interaction between PDA and Mn3O4. Compared with previously reported electrode materials based on modified GF, the novel catalyst described in this work exhibited higher energy efficiency at comparable or higher current density. Furthermore, the superior stability of Mn3O4 on the electrode with the use of bifunctional PDA could improve the lifetime of VRFBs by hindering catalyst loss and dissolution during cycles.
1. Introduction
Renewable energy technologies are of great interest nowadays due to resource scarcity and detrimental environmental concerns raised by the overuse of fossil fuels.1,2 Solar and wind energies are the mostly used renewable energy sources. However, one challenge of these natural energy sources is their uncontrollable intermittency.3 The energy storage system (ESS) storing electrical energy into chemical species and reversibly releasing it according to demand is a promising solution to this problem.4 Among various energy storage systems, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) first proposed by Skyllas-Kazacos in the 1980s are the most promising and extensively studied systems.5 VRFBs employ the same element with different valence states in the anolyte (V(II)/V(III)) and catholyte (V(IV)/V(V)) and have the advantages of power-energy separation, flexible design, long life span, low crossover, high stability and environmental friendliness.6 Despite the merits of VRFBs, high cell polarization at high charge–discharge current densities results in poor overall cell performance including low efficiency and low vanadium utilization limiting market applications of VRFBs.7 In VRFBs, polarization is caused by kinetic polarization at the electrode/electrolyte interface, ohmic loss of the electrode and electrolyte and concentration polarization from mass transport limitations.7,8 Electrodes where electrochemical reactions take place are key components affecting the overpotential arising from polarization heavily. The typical electrode of VRFBs is graphite felt (GF) with low cost, good chemical and mechanical stability, high conductivity and high surface area.9 However, GF has poor kinetic reversibility and electrochemical activity especially on the cathode side since the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction is complex, involving several elementary steps, limiting VRFB operation to low current densities (∼50 mA cm−2).10,11 Therefore, it's paramount to explore effective electrode materials and electrocatalysts. To date, lots of strategies have been exploited to overcome the cell polarization problem including surface treatments and introducing electrocatalysts onto the electrode to reduce the activation barrier for the redox conversion.7,12 Surface treatments contain thermal treatment in air, acid treatment, plasma treatment, electrochemical oxidation and nitrogen-doping, which can increase the active sites for redox reactions by introducing oxygen or nitrogen functional groups on carbon fiber.13–17 In regard to electrocatalysts, many researchers have explored carbon-based (carbon nanotubes, graphene and carbon nanoparticles) and metal-based (metal and metal oxide) materials.18–21 Metal catalysts include Pt, Au, Ir, Pd, Ru and Bi.7,22–26 However, most of these noble metals are expensive and susceptible to occurrences of the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction limiting market applications of VRFBs.27 Therefore, low cost metal oxides (Mn3O4, PbO2, WO3, Nb2O5, etc.) are more attractive to enhance the electrochemical activity of the electrode.28–32 In particular, Mn3O4 is promising due to the high abundance of Mn, low cost and environmental benignity and excellent electrocatalytic effect on VRFB redox reactions.33 Mn3O4 is usually synthesized simply by a hydrothermal method onto graphite felt in the literature.29,34 However, there are two challenges for the use of Mn3O4 as an electrocatalyst for VRFBs. One is low electrical conductivity hindering charge transfer on the electrode.34 The other is the weak adhesion of Mn3O4 on the electrode causing it to be washed out by the flowing electrolyte in VRFBs.29,35 Thus, a highly conductive electrocatalyst support is needed to solve these two problems. As described before, the use of heteroatom-doped carbon nanomaterials especially nitrogen doped carbon nanomaterials as electrocatalysts for VRFBs has been gaining popularity and they have shown enhanced battery performance.36–38 One of the nitrogen doped carbon nanomaterials is carbonized polydopamine (PDA). PDA shows extraordinary coating capability and high conductivity after carbonization.39,40 PDA is easy to polymerize from the monomer under mild conditions and can bind nanoparticles tightly.41,42 Inspired by the unique properties of polydopamine, we propose to use this polymer as a Mn3O4 electrocatalyst support on electrodes in this work. The presence of catechol/quinone groups on the PDA surface after self-polymerization can bind strongly to the Mn3O4 nanoparticles through coordination bonds.42 Interestingly, PDA also provides nitrogen-doping on the carbon matrix, which introduces defects and vacancies acting as new active sites of redox reactions and promote vanadium redox reactions.38,43 In this paper, we investigate electrocatalytic synergism in carbonized PDA–Mn3O4 for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction using cyclic voltammetry. As described below, the electrocatalytic activities of the composite electrocatalyst are much higher than those of individual PDA or Mn3O4. The composite electrocatalysts are subsequently applied in VRFBs after optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to use the PDA–Mn3O4 composite as an electrocatalyst in VRFBs. It is expected that PDA can immobilize Mn3O4 firmly, and furthermore, the PDA–Mn3O4 composite electrocatalyst exhibits a synergistic effect which achieves excellent performance in VRFBs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Vanadium(IV) oxide sulfate hydrate VOSO4·nH2O (97%, n = 3), manganese(II) acetate, Tris and dopamine hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Biopolis, Singapore). PAN based graphite felt (GFE-1) was purchased from CeraMaterials (Port Jervis, NY, USA). H2SO4 (98%) was used as received.
2.2. Synthesis of Mn3O4
Mn3O4 was synthesized by a hydrothermal method.29 In detail, 0.8 g manganese(II) acetate was dissolved in 80 mL DI water in an autoclave. The reaction mixture was heated to 150 °C for 12 hours. The resultant brown Mn3O4 formed was centrifuged to remove excess water and was washed with DI water until pH changed to approximately neutral. Finally, Mn3O4 was freeze dried for 24 hours.
2.3. Preparation of the composite electrode
Graphite felts were all thermally treated at 400 °C for 24 h in air and used as electrode substrates with enhanced hydrophilicity and electrochemical properties.13 The size of graphite felt for cyclic voltammetry (CV) was 4.5 mm thickness × 8 mm diameter while the size of GF for the VRFB single cell test was 3 cm × 3 cm × 11.6 mm. To modify graphite felt with polydopamine and Mn3O4, graphite felt was immersed in 2 mg mL−1 dopamine hydrochloride in Tris–HCl buffer (pH = 8.5) stirring first and subsequently put in a Mn3O4 suspension in Tris–HCl buffer (pH = 8.5). Optimization was done by changing the stirring time of the dopamine solution and the concentration of Mn3O4 using CV. In detail, GF was immersed in 2 mg mL−1 dopamine hydrochloride in Tris–HCl buffer (pH = 8.5) stirring for 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h or 24 h to control the quantity of Mn3O4 attached onto GF. The PDA modified GF (named PDA GF) was washed with DI water and then put in a 50 ppm Mn3O4 suspension in Tris–HCl buffer (pH = 8.5) stirring for another 1 h. The Mn3O4 suspension here in Tris–HCl buffer was sonicated and stirred repeatedly to make the suspension uniform in advance. The modified GFs were washed with DI water and dried in a 100 °C oven. Finally, the dried GFs were carbonized in a tube furnace (OTF-1200X-S, HF-Kejing, Anhui, China) by heating from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in an Ar environment with an Ar flow rate of 100 sccm, and then annealed at 900 °C for 1 h. The resulting GF was designated as PDA–Mn3O4 GF. PDA GF was also dried and carbonized under the same conditions. Carbonized GF at 900 °C for 1 h without modification was defined as blank GF. To optimize the quantity of Mn3O4 nanoparticles, GF was immersed in 2 mg mL−1 dopamine hydrochloride in Tris–HCl buffer (pH = 8.5) stirring for a certain time. After washing with DI water, PDA GF was put in a 10 ppm, 25 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm or 200 ppm Mn3O4 suspension in Tris–HCl buffer (pH = 8.5, 40 mL) stirring for another 1 h. Since almost all Mn3O4 nanoparticles were adhered to the electrode, the actual content of Mn3O4 in each composite was estimated to be 0.4 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg or 8 mg, respectively. The drying process and carbonization were the same as above. For CV measurements, different GFs were connected to carbon rods with conductive ink (Coates Screen, Rochdale, UK) and heated at 130 °C for 1 h. Carbon rods here were used as current collectors. The resultant GF electrode for CV is shown in Fig. 1a. The composite electrode for the VRFB single cell test was fabricated by the same method as that of GF for CV measurements except for a bigger GF size.

2.4. Characterization
The morphologies of Mn3O4 powder, GF, PDA GF and PDA–Mn3O4 GF were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 15 kV and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 3010, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The crystallographic structures of the electrodes and powder were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D8 advance, Bruker, Bremen, Germany). The XRD profiles were recorded between 10° and 80° at 40 kV and 40 mA with a scan rate of 3 deg min−1. The surface compositions of the samples were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Omicron). Elemental analysis (vario MICRO cube, Elementar) was used to measure the content of N.
2.5. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were performed using a computer connected potentiostat (IVIUMSTAT, IVIUM Technologies, Eindhoven, Netherlands). For three-electrode cell measurements, Pt wire was used as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (soaked in 3 M KCl) was used as a reference electrode. Modified GF was used as the working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in 0.726 M VO2+ in 2.5 M H2SO4 within the scan range of −0.2 V to 1.7 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. For the kinetic study, CV was conducted at different scan rates (10 mV s−1, 20 mV s−1, 30 mV s−1, 40 mV s−1, and 50 mV s−1). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with a three-electrode system which is the same as that used for CV. EIS was conducted at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at open circuit potential (OCP).
2.6. Stability test
To test the adhesion stability of Mn3O4 on a PDA support on GF, PDA–Mn3O4 GF was exposed in 50 mL DI water under vigorous stirring. A 0.5 mL sample solution was taken out every 30 min. The sample solution was digested with concentrated nitric acid. Subsequently, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, 7500 series, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) was used to detect Mn in the digested sample solution to determine the quantity of Mn flushed away from the electrode.
2.7. VRFB single cell test
The VRFB single cell configuration and redox reactions are shown in Fig. 1b. The VRFB single cell consists of two aluminium end plates, gaskets, two Teflon flow frames, two graphite plates and two copper plates as current collectors. The single cell was constructed with zero-gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The membrane used here is the sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone)/TiO2 composite membrane which is synthesized in previous work. The positive and negative electrodes are modified GF (3 cm × 3 cm × 11.6 mm) and thermally treated GF (400 °C for 24 h, 3 cm × 3 cm × 11.6 mm), respectively. A Masterflex L/S peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer, Vermon Hills, IL, USA) was used to keep the electrolyte flowing at a rate of 60 mL min−1 with Masterflex FDA-Compliant Viton Precision Pump Tubing (Cole-Parmer, Vermon Hills, IL, USA). Electrolytes were under N2 protection when the VRFB was running. The preparation of electrolytes was done according to a previous study.44 0.726 M V(V) in 2.5 M H2SO4 was employed as the catholyte while 0.726 M V(II) in 2.5 M H2SO4 was employed as the anolyte. Charge–discharge tests were performed using a computer controlled battery test system (CT3008W, Neware Inc., Shenzhen, China). The cell was charged and discharged at a constant current density of 50 mA cm−2, 100 mA cm−2 or 150 mA cm−2. The cut-off voltages were 1.65 V and 0.8 V. The coulombic efficiency (CE), voltage efficiency (VE) and energy efficiency (EE) were calculated by using the following equations:28 (1) (2) (3)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple using blank GF, PDA GF and PDA–Mn3O4 GF
The composite electrode was synthesized by using polydopamine (PDA) as the bridge between Mn3O4 and the graphite felt (GF) substrate. The bridging effect results from the catechol/quinone groups which can bind nanoparticles and the substrate via strong coordination bonds.42 Walsh's group reported a nitrogen-doped, reduced-graphene oxide–Mn3O4 composite electrocatalyst which was similar to our materials.45 However, the synthesis process of the PDA–Mn3O4 composite described in this work is simpler and more environmentally friendly with mild experimental conditions while Walsh and co-workers' method uses a strong oxidizer, concentrated acids and concentrated alkaline solutions with harsh experimental conditions.45,46 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the electrochemical properties of the fabricated composite electrodes. To explore the effect of different quantities of PDA on electrochemical properties, PDA–Mn3O4 GFs modified with various PDA polymerization times were investigated by CV at a scan rate (ν) of 10 mV s−1 with the same amount of Mn3O4 and the results are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2a, it is observable that the positions of the redox peaks correspond to the literature reported previously.29 As can be seen in Fig. 2a, there are a negative shift in the oxidation peak first and then a positive shift in the oxidation peak with increasing polymerization time (oxidation peak potentials from blank to 24 h PDA polymerization time successively are 1.28 V, 1.21 V, 1.18 V, 1.19 V, 1.24 V and 1.27 V). On the contrary, there are a positive shift first and a negative shift subsequently in the reduction peak with increasing polymerization time (reduction peak potentials from blank to 24 h PDA polymerization time successively are 0.49 V, 0.58 V, 0.61 V, 0.6 V, 0.55 V and 0.46 V). Fig. 2b shows the peak voltage separation between oxidation and reduction peaks, which decreases first and then increases with higher polymerization time compared to that of blank GF (0.73 V). The smallest peak voltage separation (0.57 V) comes from PDA modified GF with 4 h polymerization time. Additionally, the corresponding peak currents of these CV curves are shown in Fig. 2c. The peak currents for redox peaks increase first and then decrease with higher polymerization time especially for the oxidation peak. The highest peak currents (454 mA for the oxidation peak and 276 mA for the reduction peak) come from PDA–Mn3O4 GF with 4 h PDA polymerization time. Based on these results, PDA–Mn3O4 GF with 4 h PDA polymerization time possesses the smallest peak voltage separation and highest peak current indicating the most favorable electron-transfer kinetics for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction.47 The reason for the peak voltage separation decrease and peak current increase before 4 h PDA polymerization time for PDA–Mn3O4 GF is due to the catalytic effect of PDA and Mn3O4 on VO2+/VO2+ redox reactions which will be explained in detail later.29,38 With increasing polymerization time after 4 h, the peak voltage separation becomes larger and the peak current becomes lower for PDA–Mn3O4 GF. This can be ascribed to too much PDA which may reduce the porosity of the modified GF. A longer polymerization time (>4 h) is not beneficial to enhance the redox activity of the PDA modified GF.

(b) Anodic and cathodic peak voltages of CV curves of PDA–Mn3O4 GFs modified with various PDA polymerization times. (c) Anodic and cathodic peak currents of CV curves of PDA–Mn3O4 GFs modified with various PDA polymerization times. 
To further examine the effect of Mn3O4 loading on the electrochemical properties of the composite electrocatalyst, various concentrations of Mn3O4 were tried after GFs were modified with 4 h PDA. The CV curves of PDA–Mn3O4 GFs modified with various Mn3O4 loadings keeping the optimum PDA polymerization time (4 h) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 3a. It is observable that the onset anodic potential has a negative shift while the onset cathodic potential has a positive shift with increasing Mn3O4 loading before reaching 50 ppm. When the Mn3O4 loading is more than 50 ppm, the shift for oxidation and reduction peaks occurs in the opposite direction. As shown in Fig. 3b, the peak voltage separation between anodic and cathodic peaks decreases first and increases subsequently with higher Mn3O4 loading. Additionally, the peak currents for anodic and cathodic peaks increase first and decrease subsequently with higher Mn3O4 loading as shown in Fig. 3c. Obviously, 50 ppm Mn3O4 is the optimum concentration resulting in the smallest peak voltage separation and highest peak current which imply remarkable electrochemical properties. The increase in electrochemical performance seen from CV curves (before 50 ppm) can be explained by the electrocatalytic effect of Mn3O4 on the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction.29 When the Mn3O4 concentration is higher than 50 ppm, the electrochemical activity decreases with high Mn3O4 loading resulting in large peak voltage separation and low peak current. This is presumably due to the low electrical conductivity of Mn3O4 hindering the electron transfer of the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction to the electrode.34,45 After optimization of the polymerization time of PDA and Mn3O4 loading, GF modified with 4 h PDA polymerization time and 50 ppm Mn3O4 stands out in comparison with other modified GFs. Therefore, the PDA–Mn3O4 GF used in the following part for further study is fabricated with 4 h PDA polymerization time and 50 ppm Mn3O4.

(b) Anodic and cathodic peak voltages of CV curves of PDA–Mn3O4 GFs modified with various Mn3O4 concentrations. (c) Anodic and cathodic peak currents of CV curves of PDA–Mn3O4 GFs modified with various Mn3O4 concentrations. 
To elucidate how PDA and Mn3O4 affect the PDA–Mn3O4 composite electrode, the electrochemical properties of GFs with individual PDA and individual Mn3O4 were investigated using CV. Pure PDA GF was fabricated by putting thermally treated GF in a dopamine solution in Tris–HCl (pH = 8.5) stirring for 4 hours while pure Mn3O4 GF was fabricated by putting thermally treated GF in a 50 ppm Mn3O4 suspension stirring for 1 hour. Both PDA GF and Mn3O4 GF were then carbonized at 900 °C for 1 h under Ar protection. The CV curves of blank GF, pure PDA GF, pure Mn3O4 GF and PDA–Mn3O4 GF at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 4a. As seen in Fig. 4a, it is obvious that the electrochemical activity of the electrode was greatly enhanced after modification with pure PDA, pure Mn3O4 or PDA–Mn3O4. The onset potentials of redox reactions are key criteria for evaluating the electrochemical activity of an electrode. A low oxidation potential indicates high energy efficiency since a low oxidation potential results in low charge voltage in VRFBs.47 As can be seen in Fig. 4a, the onset anodic potentials of all modified GFs exhibited a negative shift while the onset cathodic potentials exhibited a positive shift compared to that of blank GF. Fig. 4b shows the peak voltage separation of these GFs. The peak voltage separation is in the order: blank GF (0.78 V) > PDA GF (0.69 V) > Mn3O4 GF (0.66 V) > PDA–Mn3O4 GF (0.57 V). PDA–Mn3O4 GF exhibits the best reversibility of the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple since small peak voltage separation indicates better reversibility. As shown in Fig. 4c, the peak currents of both oxidation and reduction peaks of modified GFs are much higher than those of blank GF. A high peak current indicates a large active surface area of the electrode.36 Compared to blank GF, there is an improvement of the electrochemical activity of individual PDA GF or Mn3O4 GF. Among all modified GFs, the PDA–Mn3O4 GF has the highest peak currents (454 mA for oxidation and 276 mA for reduction) while the peak currents of blank GF are 323 mA for oxidation and 204 mA for reduction. As a result, PDA–Mn3O4 GF possessing the smallest peak voltage separation and highest peak current displays much better electrochemical activity than pure PDA GF or pure Mn3O4 GF. The great enhancement of the electrochemical activity of PDA–Mn3O4 composite GF can be attributed to the electrocatalytic effect of the PDA–Mn3O4 composite towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. To understand the electrochemical catalytic activity of the PDA–Mn3O4 composite, the proposed mechanism towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction is shown in Fig. 4d. As described above, both carbonized PDA and Mn3O4 can catalyze the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction.29,38 CV results in Fig. 4a indicate that there is presumably a synergy between PDA and Mn3O4. As shown in Fig. 4d, PDA and Mn3O4 bind strongly forming the composite electrocatalyst. In charging processes, the negatively charged nitrogen (pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N or graphitic-N), due to its strong electronegativity from the PDA framework, can adsorb positively charged reactant ions, i.e. VO2+, easily on the active sites.48 The active sites are attributed to the defects and vacancies on the carbon framework, which are caused by the different radii between C atoms and N atoms.49 To prove the N-doping of carbonized PDA on the electrode, elemental analysis was used to measure the content of N in the PDA modified GF. The result of elemental analysis showed that the content of N in the electrode was 1.7%, indicating that N was successfully doped in the carbon matrix. XPS was used to further identify the N species on the surface. As shown in Fig. S1,† the N 1s spectrum of PDA GF was deconvoluted into three peaks, corresponding to pyridinic-N (398.3 eV), pyrrolic-N (400.3 eV), or graphitic-N (401.2 eV) forms. The three peaks were similar to those reported previously.38,43 The content of graphitic-N was relatively higher than the other two types of N, which was helpful in VRFBs because graphitic-N is more stable in an acidic environment and less subject to protonation than the other nitrogen forms.10,50 An N–V transitional state is formed after the reactant ion is adsorbed and the electron on the electrode transfers out of the anti-bonding orbital of VO2+ through N–V bonding. Subsequently, one H2O molecule coordinates with an empty orbital of VO2+ generating VO2+ and two protons. VO2+ diffuses to the electrolyte solution from the electrode by ion exchange finally. As shown in Fig. 4d, the catalytic mechanism of Mn3O4 in the composite electrocatalyst is similar to that of PDA except the active sites. The molecular structure of Mn3O4 is shown in Fig. 4d, containing one Mn (+2) and two Mn (+3) connected to O atoms. Oxygen atoms act as active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. The catalytic process of Mn3O4 for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction occurs on Mn–O–Mn active sites consisting of adsorbing reactant ions, electron transfer, coordinating with H2O and generation of product ions. These two catalytic mechanisms of PDA and Mn3O4 contribute to the enhancements of electrochemical activities of individual PDA GF and individual Mn3O4 GF compared to blank GF. Moreover, the electrochemical catalytic activity of the composite PDA–Mn3O4 GF is much better than that of individual PDA GF or individual Mn3O4 GF. The synergy between PDA and Mn3O4 is responsible for the enhanced electrochemical catalytic activity of the composite GF. This synergistic effect could be attributed to the strong interaction between PDA and Mn3O4, attributable mainly to intra- and interchain noncovalent interactions, including charge transfer, π-stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions.42 In addition, the highly conductive carbon framework of carbonized PDA can facilitate electron transfer between the electrocatalyst and electrode.

(c) Anodic and cathodic peak currents of the CV curves of blank GF, pure PDA GF, pure Mn3O4 GF and PDA–Mn3O4 GF. (d) Schematic illustration of the proposed catalytic mechanism of PDA–Mn3O4 GF towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. 
To investigate the redox reaction kinetics, the CVs of blank GF, PDA GF, Mn3O4 GF and PDA–Mn3O4 composite GF at different scan rates are shown in Fig. 5. It is observed that the anodic peak voltages of all electrodes shift positively while the cathodic peak voltages shift negatively with increasing scan rate suggesting that the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction is not completely electrochemically reversible (quasi-reversible) on these electrodes.45 As shown in Fig. 5, the ipc and ipa at different scan rates are proportional to the square root of the scan rate indicating that the VO2+/VO2+ redox reactions on the electrode are diffusion-controlled processes.45 By using the Randles–Sevcik equation shown in eqn (S1) and (S2),† the diffusion coefficient (D) values of the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction on blank GF, PDA GF, Mn3O4 GF and PDA–Mn3O4 composite GF are calculated and shown in Table 1.51 It is evident that the diffusion process is improved by modification of the electrode due to higher D values. As can be seen from Table 1, there is a significant increase in the anodic diffusion coefficient at the PDA modified GF (5.16 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 to 8.33 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) as compared to that of the blank GF (4.17 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 to 6.73 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) while there is minimal improvement in the cathodic side. This suggests that PDA is more effective in catalyzing the oxidation of VO2+ to VO2+. On the contrary, Mn3O4 is more effective in catalyzing the reduction of VO2+ to VO2+ as shown by the higher increase in the cathodic diffusion coefficient (4.10 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 to 6.61 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) when compared against that of the blank GF (3.57 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 to 5.76 × 10−6 cm2 s−1). Moreover, the PDA–Mn3O4 composite gives the highest diffusion coefficients (8.45 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 to 13.6 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for the oxidation process and 5.62 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 to 9.07 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for the reduction process), which are about twice those of blank GF. The diffusion coefficient of PDA–Mn3O4 GF in this work is 2.02 times that of blank GF which is higher than the diffusion coefficient of ZrO2 modified GF, which is in turn 1.67 times that of blank GF as reported in the literature.51 A higher diffusion coefficient indicates a higher mass transfer rate and hence faster electron transfer kinetics, increasing the reversibility of vanadium redox reactions.52 The high diffusion coefficients of the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction on PDA–Mn3O4 GF prove the synergistic electrocatalytic effect of the PDA–Mn3O4 composite towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox reactions corresponding to the proposed mechanism.

3.2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
The electrochemical catalytic activities of blank GF, pure PDA GF, pure Mn3O4 GF and PDA–Mn3O4 GF were further compared using EIS in 0.726 M VOSO4/2.5 M H2SO4 at open circuit potential. The Nyquist plots of these electrodes are shown in Fig. 6. It is well known that the electrochemical process is influenced by both the charge transfer and diffusion process.53 The inset in Fig. 6 is the equivalent circuit of the Nyquist plot, where Rs is the solution resistance, Rct is the charge transfer resistance, CPE is the double-layer capacitance, and W is the Warburg impedance.53Rct is determined by the diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot. It is observable from the Nyquist plots that Rct on the GF modified with PDA–Mn3O4 is smaller (∼1.07 ohm) than that of either the PDA (∼1.40 ohm) or Mn3O4 (∼1.39 ohm) modified GF alone. All modified GFs have smaller charge resistance than blank GF (∼2.09 ohm). The Rct of GF modified with PDA–Mn3O4 is lower than that of nitrogen-doped, reduced-graphene oxide–Mn3O4 modified GF reported by Walsh's group.45 A smaller Rct further suggests a smaller polarization value and thus the energy efficiency of the VRFB can be enhanced. In conclusion, PDA–Mn3O4 GF could reduce the Rct value significantly and enhance the electrochemical catalytic activity due to the synergistic effect, which is also consistent with the CV results.

3.3. SEM and TEM analysis
The morphologies of Mn3O4 powder, blank GF, PDA GF and PDA–Mn3O4 GF were characterized by FESEM. As shown in Fig. 7a, Mn3O4 synthesized by a hydrothermal method is a mixture of the octahedron and tetrahedron which could have resulted from a Jahn–Teller effect.54 In addition to the octahedron and tetrahedron, there are a small number of nanorods of Mn3O4 which could be caused by high hydrothermal temperature.55Fig. 7b shows the blank GF. It can be seen that the diameter of the carbon fiber of blank GF is ca. 15 μm and the surface of the carbon fiber is quite smooth. As shown in Fig. 7c, the PDA film is uniformly coated on the carbon fiber as the surface is rougher than that of the blank carbon fiber. PDA is coated on the carbon fiber firmly due to the strong adhesive properties and self-polymerization of dopamine.38Fig. 7d shows the SEM image of the optimized PDA–Mn3O4 GF. Some of the Mn3O4 particles are circled by red lines. It is clear that Mn3O4 is introduced onto the electrode through PDA as a bridge even though the quantity of Mn3O4 particles is relatively small. Nevertheless, Fig. 3 shows that increasing the amount of Mn3O4 particles did not benefit the catalytic effect of the composite electrode. The SEM images of these modified GFs are consistent with the CV and EIS results discussed above. To investigate the surface of PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF in depth, TEM was used. Since the diameter of the carbon fiber was very large compared with the nanoparticles, the edge of the fiber was characterized by TEM. As shown in Fig. S3a,† the surface of blank GF is very smooth. Fig. S3b† shows PDA modified GF with a thin film on the surface of the fiber. Fig. S3c and d† are the TEM images of PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF at different spots. It is clearly observable that there are a few Mn3O4 nanoparticles on the carbon fiber bridged by the PDA film. These TEM images are in agreement with the SEM images confirming that the PDA–Mn3O4 composite electrocatalysts are well adhered to the electrode after modification.

3.4. XRD analysis

Fig. 8 depicts the XRD patterns of Mn3O4 powder, blank GF and GF with PDA–Mn3O4. For blank GF, there are four typical peaks at 2θ values of 25.8°, 42.7°, 53.5° and 78.0°. As for Mn3O4, it is observed that the XRD pattern is consistent with the tetragonal type Mn3O4 structure (JCPDS no. 24-0734).55 The average size of the Mn3O4 crystal is calculated by the Scherrer equation shown in eqn (3). The crystallite size was estimated to be 55.7 nm, which corresponds to the data from SEM. As shown in Fig. 8b, the characteristic peaks of Mn3O4 (32.3°, 36.1°, 58.5°, 59.8°, and 64.6°) appear in PDA–Mn3O4 GF. This suggests that Mn3O4 is well attached on the composite electrode.

3.5. Adhesion stability of Mn3O4 nanoparticles on the composite electrode
The stability of the electrocatalyst on the electrode is an important factor affecting the lifetime of VRFBs. In this work, Mn3O4 was immobilized onto the PDA film by two processes including the monomer polymerization process and the Mn3O4 binding process with PDA self-polymerization properties and rich functional groups. To evaluate the stability of Mn3O4 nanoparticles in PDA–Mn3O4 GF, the stability test was performed and the loss of Mn from the electrode was analyzed by ICP-MS. The stability of Mn3O4 on PDA–Mn3O4 GF was compared with that of pure Mn3O4 GF. As shown in Fig. S2,† the Mn concentration from pure Mn3O4 GF is always higher than that of PDA–Mn3O4 GF (318.5 ppb for pure Mn3O4 GF and 135.2 ppb for PDA–Mn3O4 GF after 210 min). This result is significantly lower than the previously reported value (100 ppm level) by Kim's group indicating that the Mn3O4 is much more stable on the electrode with the use of PDA.29 The reason for the good stability is attributed to the strong interaction between PDA and Mn3O4 arising from catechol/quinone groups in PDA. Additionally, the self-polymerization properties of dopamine were beneficial for both attaching Mn3O4 onto GF, and establishing a strong binding affinity with the graphite felt. In this way, Mn3O4 nanoparticles are immobilized by the PDA and the PDA can also bind strongly with the GF. The excellent stability would improve the lifetime of VRFBs by hindering catalyst loss and dissolution during cycles.
3.6. VRFB single cell performance
The results for the electrochemical performances of VRFBs with blank GF, PDA GF and PDA–Mn3O4 GF at a constant current density of 50 mA cm−2 are shown in Fig. 9. Pure Mn3O4 GF was not tested in VRFBs due to the poor stability of Mn3O4 on the electrode. Fig. 9a shows the charge–discharge curves of VRFBs (1st cycle) with blank GF, PDA GF and PDA–Mn3O4 GF. It is observed that the charge–discharge time for one cycle is in the order: blank GF (2.18 h) < PDA GF (2.27 h) < PDA–Mn3O4 GF (2.41 h) and the charge–discharge plateau separation is in the order: GF > PDA GF > PDA–Mn3O4 GF. The longer charge–discharge time and smaller voltage plateau separation suggest better performance of VRFBs. The reason for the superior performance of PDA–Mn3O4 is attributed to the smaller polarization of the composite GF modified electrocatalyst. Fig. 9b shows the electrolyte utilization of VRFBs with blank GF, PDA GF and PDA–Mn3O4 GF. The electrolyte utilization is calculated by practical charge capacity (1st cycle) over the theoretical capacity. It is observable that PDA GF (88.3%) and PDA–Mn3O4 GF (94.0%) have higher electrolyte utilization than blank GF (85%). The high electrolyte utilization of PDA–Mn3O4 GF is due to the faster kinetics of the composite electrocatalyst. To further test the stability of PDA–Mn3O4 GF in VRFBs, a series of cycle life tests were performed under a current density of 50 mA cm−2. The efficiencies of VRFBs with PDA–Mn3O4 GF and blank GF are shown in Fig. 9c. As can be seen, the coulombic efficiency (CE), voltage efficiency (VE) and energy efficiency (EE) of the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 GF remain stable over many cycles, indicating good long-term stability of the VRFB. It is also observed from Fig. 9c that the overall efficiencies of VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 are higher than those of VRFBs with blank GF. The average CE of VRFBs with PDA–Mn3O4 GF is 98.1%. The average VE is 86.2% and the average EE is 84.6%. The EE is quite high compared to previously reported values.29,43,56 The outstanding performance of the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 GF is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the composite electrocatalyst enhancing the electrochemical activity of the electrode by reducing the reaction activation energy and facilitating electron transfer. Fig. 9d shows the comparison of the capacity decay between the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 GF and the VRFB with blank GF. It is clear that the capacity of the VRFB with modified GF almost remains at the same level with increasing cycles while that of the VRFB with blank GF decreases significantly. The discharge capacity decay rate of the VRFB with blank GF calculated from Fig. 9d is 0.25% per cycle while that of the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 GF is 0.07% per cycle which is small compared to previously reported decay rates.34,43 The slow capacity decay demonstrates the excellent cycling stability of the PDA–Mn3O4 electrocatalyst under VRFB operation conditions, consistent with the stability test results. To further prove the good stability of the PDA–Mn3O4 electrocatalyst on the electrode, the modified GF was characterized by SEM after charge–discharge cycle tests. The SEM images with different magnification are shown in Fig. S4.† As shown in Fig. S4,† the PDA–Mn3O4 composite still exists on the graphite felt after 50 cycles under harsh conditions of the VRFB (some of the Mn3O4 nanoparticles are circled by red lines for clear recognition). This indicates that the PDA–Mn3O4 composite can bear the strong acid conditions during VRFB single cell operation. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the PDA–Mn3O4 modified positive electrode was further demonstrated by charge–discharge tests under different current densities ranging from 50 mA cm−2 to 150 mA cm−2. It is notable from Fig. 10a that the CEs of VRFBs with different electrodes are almost similar to each other at different current densities. As shown in Fig. 10b and c, the VRFB with the PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF exhibits the best cycling performance in terms of VE and EE when compared to the cell with PDA modified and blank GFs. The VE and EE differences between VRFBs with the PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF and VRFB with PDA GF or blank GF are more obvious with higher current densities. As seen in Table 2, PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF exhibits a high EE of 84.6% and 73.7% and 61.1% at a current density of 50 mA cm−2, 100 mA cm−2 and 150 mA cm−2 respectively, while those of the VRFB with blank GF are 83.0%, 71.2% and 55.9%, respectively. Such high EE especially at high current density is rarely reported in previous studies.19 As for CE and VE of the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF, CE (98.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% at a current density of 50 mA cm−2, 100 mA cm−2 and 150 mA cm−2) increases while VE (86.2%, 74.5% and 61.5% at a current density of 50 mA cm−2, 100 mA cm−2 and 150 mA cm−2) decreases with higher current densities. The reasons for the CE increase and VE (or EE) decrease are shorter charge–discharge cycle time and higher IR drop at high current density. The higher EE and VE especially at higher current densities of VRFBs with PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF are attributed to reduced resistance and hence reduced polarization of the GF due to the use of the composite electrocatalyst possessing better electrochemical activity. Since the metal oxides supported on doped carbon materials reported by Walsh's group have no data for VRFB single performance,45 the energy efficiency of the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF was compared with those of other materials reported in the literature as listed in Table S1.†27,34,56–58 As can be seen from Table S1,† the energy efficiency (EE) of the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF is 8.1% and 5% higher than that of the VRFB with CNF-CNT GF and porous carbon GF respectively at a current density of 100 mA cm−2.27,57 The EE of Mn3O4-MWCNT GF fabricated by Liu's group is 84.6% at 20 mA cm−2 which is much lower than the EE in this work.34 Moreover, at a current density of 50 mA cm−2, the EE in this work is 2.6% and 1.5% higher than that of the VRFB with MWCNT GF and water activated GF respectively.56,58Fig. 10d shows the discharge capacity of the cell with different electrodes at different current densities. At the same current density, the discharge capacity is in the order: PDA–Mn3O4 GF > PDA GF > blank GF, indicating better electrolyte utilization of PDA–Mn3O4 GF. The difference between discharge capacity using PDA–Mn3O4 GF and that using blank GF is more obvious at high current density implying that the VRFB with PDA–Mn3O4 GF can be improved greatly especially under conditions of high current density. Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF improves the performance of VRFBs greatly due to the synergistic effect of the composite electrocatalyst.

It is noted that this work aimed to overcome the sluggish kinetics of V(IV)/V(V) redox reactions. Compared with the negative V(II)/V(III) redox couple, the V(IV)/V(V) redox couple sustains a relatively slow reaction due to the rearrangement of the coordination structures of the vanadium ions, influencing significantly the performance of VRFBs. This rearrangement includes the transfer of electrons, the exchange of protons, and the formation of a number of intermediate complexes, according to the pH of the electrolyte and the electrical potential.23 Thus, the V(IV)/V(V) half-cell reaction plays an important role in the overall performance of VRFBs. This is the reason that much attention has been paid to the investigation of effective catalysts and materials for the positive side of VRFBs. In addition, the PDA–Mn3O4 composite electrocatalyst employed in this work may not be suitable for the V(II)/V(III) redox couple. As reported previously, carbonized PDA showed less catalytic activity for the V(II)/V(III) redox reaction and a higher hydrogen evolution current than thermally treated graphite felt.38 Hydrogen evolution in the literature was observed in the negative electrode modified with carbonized PDA of VRFBs, suggesting that carbonized PDA may not be appropriate for use as a negative electrode in VRFBs.38 There is another study with a graphene–Mn3O4 modified electrode.45 The result showed that the graphene–Mn3O4 catalyst did not improve negative redox reactions.45 Therefore, this work did not investigate the effect of the composite catalyst on the V(II)/V(III) redox couple and more suitable catalysts should be developed for the negative reaction of VRFBs.
4. Conclusion
In summary, PDA–Mn3O4 modified GF was synthesized and optimized by varying the polymerization time of PDA and Mn3O4 loadings. The optimization was conducted with CV and the optimum PDA–Mn3O4 GF was with PDA with 4 h polymerization time and 50 ppm Mn3O4. The electrochemical activity of the optimum PDA–Mn3O4 GF can be greatly improved and the mechanism for the improvement is proposed in this work. The CV curve of the PDA–Mn3O4 GF shows smaller peak voltage separation and higher peak current compared to those of PDA GF or blank GF suggesting better electrochemical activity. The diffusion coefficient (D) for PDA–Mn3O4 GF is about twice that of blank GF. In addition, the charge resistance Rct is the smallest among different electrodes. These improvements including reduced polarization and enhanced electron transfer kinetics are attributed to the synergistic effect between PDA and Mn3O4 in the composite electrocatalyst on the electrode. Consequently, a VRFB employing PDA–Mn3O4 GF as the positive electrode exhibited excellent performance especially at high current density. The VE and EE of VRFBs with PDA–Mn3O4 GF are 61.5% and 61.1% at 150 mA cm−2, much higher than those of VRFBs with blank GF. Moreover, the stability of PDA–Mn3O4 GF is outstanding in both the stability test and VRFB operation.
