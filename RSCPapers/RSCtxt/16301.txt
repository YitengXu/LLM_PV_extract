    , Accepted 17th October 2015First published on 19th October 2015AbstractA novel ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH hierarchical nanostructure has been synthesized by a low temperature chemical bath deposition method. The integrated three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure consists of one-dimensional (1D) ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays and two-dimensional (2D) interconnected FeOOH nanosheets. By applying such a hierarchical nanostructure as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical water reaction, higher photostability and photocurrent density are gained compared with the reported ZnO based nanostructures. It is concluded that the giant enhancement of the properties is because, in the process of photoelectrochemical reaction, electron–hole separation and transfer are enhanced efficiently through the ZnO/TiO2 heterojunction, and in the meanwhile, terminal interconnected FeOOH nanosheets play both the roles of a surface catalyst and a protective layer effectively to accelerate water splitting reaction and enhance photostability. Based on such an environmentally friendly hierarchical nanostructure, photoelectrochemical water splitting and other similar reactions could be performed effectively and economically.
Introduction
Sunlight-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen presents a promising way to utilize renewable solar energy effectively and has been explored by lots of researchers since Honda and Fujishima reported the reaction firstly in 1972.1 Zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the promising photoanode materials for water oxidation due to its band gap, high electron mobility, low onset potential, abundance in nature and low cost.2–4 However, the application is restricted by its fast electron–hole pair recombination, slow carrier transfer kinetics and poor photostability.5 The photocatalytic capability of various semiconductors such as TiO26–8 and WO39–11 was also investigated. The results show that most single phase photocatalysts present poor energy conversion efficiency because, by using them, it is hard to simultaneously achieve good light absorption, highly efficient charge separation and transport and surface electrochemical electrolysis reaction.12–14 Thus, strategies such as tailoring the nanostructures,8,15,16 construction of hybrid semiconductors,17–20 and addition of cocatalyst materials14,21,22 have been performed for overcoming the aforementioned limitations. In cases of ZnO nanostructure based photoanodes, ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays demonstrate a higher photocurrent density and better photostability because of an enhanced charge separation at the interface of ZnO and TiO2,23,24 and high chemical stability of TiO2.25,26
Very recently, much attention has been paid to construct photoelectrodes by using three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructures for further enhancing the PEC performance.8,27,28 Various 3D configurations, such as binary hybrids ZnO nanodisks/nanowires,29 ZnO nanowires/LDH nanosheets,13 and SnO2 nanowires/TiO2 nanorods,30 and ternary hybrids such as ZnO/TiO2/CuO,31 TiO2/ZnO/CdS,20 and WO3/C3N4/CoOx32 have been explored in an attempt to take advantage of all components and to minimise their disadvantages. The results show that 3D nanostructures are very promising to provide long optical paths, short channels and a large interfacial area, which are beneficial for light absorption, rapid charge transport and water redox reactions, respectively.33,34 Moreover, integrating a surface modifying catalyst with photon-absorbing capability and appropriate morphology into photoanode structures is feasible to increase the PEC efficiency one more step via fabricating electrode/electrolyte interfaces to reduce the charge recombination rate.14,21,35,36 FeOOH has been proven to be an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, and thus, is a promising surface catalyst for accelerating water redox reaction because it not only possesses the required properties, but it is also earth-abundant, chemically stable and environmentally friendly.14,37
Therefore, in consideration of energy conversion efficiency, chemical stability and scalable fabrication all together, we designed and fabricated a unique ZnO based hierarchical 3D nanostructure by a simple low temperature method. The as-synthesized nanostructures serve as photoanodes of PEC water splitting and consist of aligned ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays and interconnected 2D FeOOH nanosheets. Their PEC properties and the corresponding mechanisms are studied and discussed in detail in the present work. To the best of our knowledge, such ZnO based 3D nanostructures are proposed and studied here for the first time, and a giant enhancement of PEC performance is achieved with their photocurrent density 6.9 (690%) times greater than ZnO at 1.8 V.
Experimental section
Fabrication of 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH nanostructures
There were three steps in preparation of 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH heterojunction arrays on FTO. First, ZnO seeds on the FTO substrates were obtained by spin coating of a 5 mM zinc acetate ethanol solution, and then it was annealed at 350 °C for 20 min. ZnO nanowire arrays were grown from the nanocrystal seeds in an aqueous solution of 25 mM Zn(NO)3·6H2O and 25 mM hexamethylenetetramine by heating at 90 °C in a water bath for 4 hours. Then the as-synthesized nanowire arrays were washed and dried by using deionized water and argon. Second, the ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays were prepared by immersing ZnO nanowires in a mixed solution of 0.075 M (NH4)2TiF6 and 0.2 M H3BO3 for 60 s at room temperature (25 °C). Finally, after transferring the as-prepared ZnO/TiO2 nanowire arrays to a 5 mM FeCl2·4H2O aqueous solution, chemical bath deposition at 40 °C was performed for 10 min for acquiring FeOOH nanosheets on ZnO/TiO2 surfaces with an appropriate thickness. Finally, the 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH nanostructures were washed and dried by using distilled water and argon.
Characterization
The morphologies of 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai 20), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-2010) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800F, 10 kV) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The crystal structures of the as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Dmax-2000 diffractometer with a Cu Kα source). The absorption behaviors of the samples were analyzed by using a Shimadzu UV-3101PC UV–vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
All PEC studies were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai) in a three-electrode cell using the as-prepared sample as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 7) purged with N2 was used as a general stable supporting electrolyte medium for the ZnO based system in PEC reaction for increasing the conductivity. A 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter (Newport) was used as the simulated sunlight source (100 mW cm−2). The sample was illuminated from the back side of the photoanode at room temperature. Conversion of the measured potential versus Ag/AgCl electrode to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential was according to the Nernst equation:32 (1)where ERHE is the converted potential versus RHE,  at 25 °C, and EAg/AgCl is the measured potential versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Transient photocurrent density versus time plots of 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH were recorded at an applied potential of 1.1 V versus RHE at 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route and the corresponding as-synthesized 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH hierarchical nanostructures of each step on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate are illustrated in Fig. 1. The diameter and length of ZnO nanowires are around 80 nm and 1.2 μm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1b and e. A condensed TiO2 shell with a thickness around 8 nm was deposited successfully on ZnO nanowires. The characterization by selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicates that the as-synthesized ZnO nanowires have a wurtzite structure and TiO2 shells are amorphous (Fig. 2a–c and S1†). Sequentially, as designed, interconnected FeOOH nanosheets are grown on the surface of ZnO/TiO2 (Fig. 1d, g, and S2†) core–shell nanowire arrays via a low temperature (40 °C) chemical bath deposition (CBD) process. The line scan profiles (Fig. S2c†) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy elemental mapping images (Fig. S3†) further proved that the as-prepared 3D nanostructures consisted of O, Zn, Ti, and Fe. The HRTEM images (Fig. 2e and f) show ultra-thin amorphous FeOOH nanosheets with a thickness of ∼5 nm, which were closely grafted on the surface of ZnO/TiO2 core–shell structures. FeOOH with an amorphous phase is desired because of its high activity resulting from its light transparency and ion-permeability.14,38,39

From b and c, it can be confirmed that single crystalline ZnO wurtzite structures along the [100] zone axis and the as-deposited TiO2 shell are amorphous. From the insets of e and f, amorphous FeOOH is confirmed. 
In order to elucidate the formation process and the effects of morphologies on the PEC properties of 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH nanostructures, time-dependent morphologies were studied. Sheet-like nanostructures were present on the surface of ZnO/TiO2 nanowires after 1 min reaction (Fig. 3a). 15 min later, interconnected FeOOH nanosheets are obtained. The whole sample surface is covered by FeOOH nanosheets after 30 min reaction. It should be noted that the FeOOH sheets are selectively grown on the surface of the ZnO/TiO2 nanowires without any precipitate in the reaction solution or on the inside surface of the glass container. It means that the surface of ZnO/TiO2 nanowires is active for FeOOH nucleation and thus leads to low temperature growth of FeOOH. Moreover, as the reaction proceeds, initially the nanosheets aggregated and then interconnected for minimizing the surface energy.40 On the other hand, comparative tests using bare FTO substrates show that no precipitation appears on FTO or in the reaction solution with the reaction proceeding at a temperature of 20–100 °C for 2 h. Temperature-dependent experiments showed (Fig. S5†) that nanosheets were deposited on the surface of ZnO/TiO2 nanowires at a temperature of 20–70 °C, while nanoparticles would be obtained when the reaction temperature is over 80 °C. It indicates that temperature is one of the key factors for controlling FeOOH anisotropic growth and morphologies.

To understand the optical properties of the ZnO, ZnO/TiO2, and 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH nanostructures, their UV–vis absorption capabilities are studied (Fig. S4†). The bare ZnO nanowires show strong adsorption at the band edge of 380 nm, corresponding to the bandgap of ZnO (3.3 eV).41 In contrast, the absorption edge of ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays exhibits an obvious red shift, which indicates enhanced light absorption after deposition of TiO2. Moreover, the modification of FeOOH hardly affects the light absorption of ZnO/TiO2 nanowires.
The PEC water splitting performances of the 3D hybrid ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH photoanode were investigated in a three electrode electrochemical cell and under illumination of AM 1.5 G simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2). As photoanodes, photocurrent densities of the ZnO nanowires, ZnO/TiO2 core shell nanowire arrays and 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH nanostructures are shown in Fig. 4a. Dark current is negligible for all samples. Compared with ZnO nanowires, the photoresponse of ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays presents a greater photocurrent density, which is 0.87 mA cm−2 at 1.8 V versus RHE (0.23 mA cm−2 for ZnO nanowires). The enhanced photocurrent density can be ascribed to the higher light absorption and the formation of a heterojunction, through which the photoexcited electron–hole pairs can be separated and transported more efficiently. As expected, after the growth of FeOOH nanosheets on ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays, the 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH photoanode exhibits a further enhanced photocurrent density of 1.59 mA cm−2 at 1.8 V, which is nearly 1.8 (180%) and 6.9 (690%) times greater than that of ZnO/TiO2 and ZnO, respectively. This result indicates that the FeOOH nanosheets do really improve PEC water oxidation properties. Moreover, the onset potential of 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH is 0.14 V versus RHE, which is 270 mV lower than pristine ZnO nanowires (0.41 V). Fig. S6† shows the photocurrent density of the 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH with different FeOOH growth times (from 1 min to 15 min). With the time increasing, the photocurrent density increases gradually and reaches the maximum value in the case of 10 min growth, indicating that the appropriate surface catalyst coating is effective for improving the photoconversion efficiency. However, the photocurrent falls significantly in case where the FeOOH growth time is over 10 min. The reason is that a dense FeOOH layer on the photoanode would decrease charge transfer and light absorption to a great extent. Fig. 4b shows the photoconversion efficiency of the samples, which was calculated by using the following equation:33 η = jp(1.23 − |V|)/I0(2)where jp is the photocurrent density (100 mA cm−2), V is the potential versus RHE, and I0 is the power density of incident light 100 mW cm−2. The maximum photoconversion efficiency for ZnO nanowires, ZnO/TiO2 and 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH is 0.01% at 0.96 V, 0.07% at 0.95 V, and 0.36% at 0.7 V respectively. Obviously, the giant enhancement of conversion efficiency is due to the formation of a heterojunction of ZnO/TiO2 and the addition of a FeOOH cocatalyst with appropriate morphologies.

For investigating the photoresponse of the hybrid nanostructures, transient photocurrent density versus time was measured over 1000 seconds by repeating on–off illumination cycles at 1.1 V. The rise and fall of the photocurrents of all the samples are synchronous with the illumination switching on/off (Fig. 4c). The initial photocurrent spikes are due to the transient effect in power stimulation. The greatly enhanced transient photocurrent density of the 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH nanostructures further demonstrates the highly efficient photogenerated electron–hole pairs transfer between ZnO, TiO2, and FeOOH.
The photostability of photoanodes is also very important for practical applications of the PEC cell. Thus, the photostability of the ZnO nanowires, ZnO/TiO2 and 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH electrodes for PEC water splitting is investigated via amperometric current versus time by using the same three electrode cell at 1.1 V versus RHE under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 4d, the extremely high stability for the 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH photoelectrode is shown over the entire duration with perfect photocurrent retention after 2 h light illumination. By contrast, the photocurrent density of ZnO/TiO2 and ZnO nanowires decreases gradually with time, and is, after 2 h light illumination, 72% and 42% of their maximum values, respectively. A clear comparison is obtained by rescaling the plots by photocurrent retention versus time, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4d. The weak photostability of bare ZnO nanowires is because of the severe corrosion of ZnO nanowires resulted by accumulation of photogenerated charges.3 Besides depositing TiO2 on the surface of ZnO, the introduction of catalysis of FeOOH for water oxidation is also efficient for resisting the photocorrosion due to the large improvement of the kinetic transport of photogenerated holes and further protection of FeOOH nanosheets.42 Thus, FeOOH nanosheets not only act as an electrocatalyst, but also act as a protective layer against photocorrosion.
For further understanding the mechanism of enhanced PEC water oxidation performance of the ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH photoelectrode, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured with an applied potential of 1.1 V versus RHE (Fig. 5a). All conversion peaks of ZnO nanowires, ZnO/TiO2 and 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH are at 380 nm, and conversion rates are 7.6%, 15.4%, and 30.5%, respectively. The largely enhanced IPCE of the 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH nanostructures is in accordance with their photoelectrochemical performances. The identical conversion peak demonstrates that the FeOOH nanosheets play the role of an electrocatalyst without any effect on light absorption. Based on the aforementioned discussions, a possible mechanism of 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH interconnected heterojunction arrays for PEC water splitting is proposed (Fig. 5b). Upon illumination, electrons and holes are generated in both ZnO and TiO2 conduction bands and valence bands. The photoexcited electron–hole pairs are efficiently separated at the interface of TiO2 and ZnO, where photoelectrons migrate from the TiO2 conduction band to the ZnO conduction band and then via 1D ZnO nanowires to the FTO substrate. At the same time, the holes in the valence band of ZnO are injected to the valence band of TiO2 and subsequently transfer to FeOOH nanosheets. The accumulated holes in FeOOH nanosheets catalyze water oxidation to form oxygen, as their valence band potential is more positive than the water oxidation potential as shown in Fig. S7.†31

Conclusions
We have successfully developed a promising strategy for fabricating novel 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH hybrid nanostructures, which are integrated by 1D ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays and 2D interconnected FeOOH nanosheets. Designing such nanostructures is for pursuing highly efficient and stable photoanodes depending on ZnO based nanostructures. In contrast to most reported ZnO based photoelectrodes for PEC water oxidation, the present 3D nanostructures exhibit more superior performance with a giant enhancement of photochemical conversion efficiency and photostability. This can be because the key factors of photoelectrochemical reaction, electron–hole pair separation, transfer, reaction rate and photostability, are enhanced efficiently at the same time by multiple functional components of 3D hierarchical nanostructures (ZnO, TiO2 and FeOOH). Therefore, our work demonstrates a low-temperature, cheap and green solution for constructing environmentally friendly 3D multicomponent nanostructures for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting, which is possibly scaled up and extended to other oxide-based electrodes and photoelectrochemical reactions.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of the synthetic route for 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH heterojunction arrays on FTO. SEM images of (b, e) vertically aligned ZnO nanowires on FTO, (c, f) deposition of TiO2 on ZnO nanowires, and (d, g) growth of FeOOH nanosheets on the surface of ZnO/TiO2. The corresponding EDX spectra are shown in the insets of (e), (f), and (g).	 

 	Fig. 2  TEM images of (a, b) TiO2 deposited on ZnO nanowires and (d, e) FeOOH nanosheets grown on ZnO/TiO2; insets in (b) and (e) are the corresponding SAED. HRTEM images of the (c) ZnO/TiO2 and (f) ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH (inset: the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern). From b and c, it can be confirmed that single crystalline ZnO wurtzite structures along the [100] zone axis and the as-deposited TiO2 shell are amorphous. From the insets of e and f, amorphous FeOOH is confirmed.	 

 	Fig. 3  The formation of 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH nanostructures was studied by tracking time-dependent morphologies. SEM images: (a) 1 min, (b) 5 min, (c) 15 min, (d) 20 min, (e) 30 min, (f) 120 min.

 	Fig. 4  Photoelectrochemical performances of ZnO nanowires, ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays and 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH. (a) Photocurrent density versus voltage curves, (b) photoconversion efficiency as a function of potential, (c) transient photocurrent density versus time plots at an applied potential of 1.1 V versus RHE, and (d) photocurrent stability measurement curves at an applied potential of 1.1 V versus RHE, the corresponding photocurrent retention shown as inset, all measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution under AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) IPCE spectra of ZnO nanowires, ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanowire arrays and 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH at an applied potential of 1.1 V versus RHE, and (b) schematic diagrams of 3D ZnO/TiO2/FeOOH heterojunction arrays for PEC water splitting.31,42
