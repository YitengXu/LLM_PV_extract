1. Introduction
With the rapid development of modern society, people's demand for energy has sharply increased in many fields. Fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas are the basic energy sources of the modern economy. Nevertheless, these forms of energy are being exhausted at an increasing rate and inevitably lead to serious deterioration of the environment.1 Therefore, in the context of these universally increasing energy demands, it is more urgent than ever to explore advanced energy conversion and storage technologies.2–4 Among all currently available technologies, rechargeable batteries, also known as secondary batteries, constitute the most promising technology that must be continuously improved.5–7 At present, the research on enhancing rechargeable batteries mainly focuses on two categories of electrochemical devices: lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).8,9
LIBs were proposed by a British chemist M Stanley Whittingham in the 1970s and were introduced to the market by Sony for the first time in 1991.10,11 They have gradually become one of the most universal power sources in place of traditional fossil fuels owing to several advantages.12,13 Due to their long cycle life, high energy density and light weight, LIBs have been utilized for a variety of devices in everyday life, such as electric vehicles and portable devices including mobile phones, laptop computers, and power tools.14–16 In addition, LIBs are much more eco-friendly in comparison with some other types of batteries, which may contain elements such as lead, mercury or cadmium.17 Hence, LIBs are commonly categorized as non-hazardous waste since they contain less toxic elements. However, LIBs still have their own drawbacks throughout the development process, such as safety problems, high costs and a complex recycling procedure. Because of this, SIBs have drawn intense attention from both industry and academia for selection as another ideal candidate for energy storage.18,19
SIBs were initially studied along with LIBs in the late 1970s and through the 1980s. Owing to their relatively low cost and the higher abundance in nature of sodium from the alkali metal family, SIBs are regarded as cost-effective choices particularly when large-scale applications are needed, for instance, grid energy storage.20–23 It is also specific to SIBs that they can be completely drained; that is, they can be totally discharged to zero charge without damaging the active materials. Therefore, they can be stored and shipped safely, while LIBs must retain a partial charge during storage to avoid short-circuiting or catching fire during shipment. Moreover, SIBs have excellent electrochemical features in terms of charge/discharge, reversibility and high specific discharge capacity.24
To support certain applications, it is of great significance to advance battery storage technologies in both LIBs and SIBs (L/SIBs).25–27 One practical way is to develop suitable electrode materials that can play a dual storage role in L/SIBs.28 A study of these materials will offer a better understanding of different reactions occurring at the electrodes for L/SIBs and provide many new solutions to related problems during optimization. Additionally, identifying dual role electrode materials capable of storing both lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) is thought to be quite relevant, as these materials can help find potential applications simultaneously in L/SIBs through effective comparisons.29,30 The energy densities of the currently existing L/SIBs are still limited and can hardly satisfy the increasing energy requirements of the entire world.31,32 Since the performances of rechargeable batteries depend essentially on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrochemical reactions involved in the components (the anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator),33 it is imperative to develop new dual electrode materials with better performance to further improve the energy density of L/SIBs.34,35 There have been many overviews on anode or cathode materials solely for LIBs or SIBs.36,37 However, as is known, there have been few comprehensive reviews on dual electrode materials for L/SIBs up until now. Hence, a review focusing on this topic is critical. In this review, we survey the research and development of dual anodes (metal oxides, carbon-based materials, alloys, metal sulfides, composite materials and other materials) for L/SIBs suitable for further study. Material synthesis schemes and connections between morphologies and the electrochemical performances of these materials are included. At the same time, the emerging challenges and future outlooks for more ideal dual materials applied in L/SIBs are concisely provided (Fig. 1).

2. Metal oxides (MO)
It is high time to develop advanced dual anode materials to meet the demands for L/SIBs with better performance. Metal oxides, including several dimetallic oxides, are such materials that can quite commonly supply satisfactory capacity, cycling stability and high rate capability. These anode materials often include the elements iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) or titanium (Ti).38
Iron oxides are one of these materials. Wu et al. prepared two types of Fe2O3 core–shell microspheres via a template-free solvothermal process. The distinctions between subunits were controlled by utilizing water (W–Fe2O3) or ethanol (E–Fe2O3) as the solvent (Fig. 2a). The study showed that the subunits largely affect the electrochemical properties of the end product. W–Fe2O3 with special subunits displayed better performance than E–Fe2O3, with 1264.0 mA h g−1 maintained after 200 cycles at 800 mA g−1 and 733.1 mA h g−1 at 6000 mA g−1 in LIBs, which is more than twice that of E–Fe2O3 (Fig. 2e). It was also impressive that W–Fe2O3 delivered satisfactory performance in SIBs. It was finally proved in the study that an Fe2O3 multi-shelled core–shell microsphere anode, which integrated many advantages, could be prepared simply by improving the subunits.15 In addition to the multi-shelled core–shell microsphere of Fe2O3, a porous structure was also applied. Rao and co-workers synthesized porous hematite α-Fe2O3 in a short time period by a rapid microwave-assisted hydrothermal process. It can be seen from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images that the α-Fe2O3 nanospheres are quite uniform. Acting as an anode for LIBs, α-Fe2O3 nanostructures display a second discharge performance of 1000 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. When tested in SIBs, the porous α-Fe2O3 nanostructures as the negative electrodes show a reversible capacity of 300 mA h g−1 at 0.1C up to 100 cycles. It is significant that the excellent capacity of α-Fe2O3 nanostructures can be attributed to their porous nature and uniform shape.39 Moreover, Hariharan et al. took Fe3O4 as a case study to display a rationally designed dual anode material, which is capable of storing both Li and Na by a conversion reaction. Fe3O4 electrodes demonstrate a charge capacity of 950 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1.2C and show no signs of capacity loss even up to 1100 cycles. It is important that the batteries can be charged–discharged rapidly to approximately 65% of their theoretical capacity in just 5 min or at 11.11 A g−1.29

In addition to iron oxides, cobalt oxides also play an important role as dual anode materials. A simple pyrolysis experiment on a layer-structured Co-MOC material was done by Li and co-workers (Fig. 2b), which produced hierarchically structured shale-like Co3O4 (S-Co3O4) for high-performance L/SIBs. The as-prepared S-Co3O4 shows an open porous structure and offers extremely short ion diffusion pathways, which greatly optimize the former Co3O4 electrode. In the role of an anode material in LIBs, the S-Co3O4 displays an excellent reversible capacity of 1045.3 mA h g−1 even after 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1 and rate capabilities up to 10 A g−1. It also displays decent cycle stability and a high rate performance of 153.8 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 for SIBs.8 In addition, Wen et al. fabricated special bowl-like hollow Co3O4 microspheres derived from the spherical shape of RF gel particles (Fig. 2d). The approach was very facile and low cost and involved thermal treatment of a Co-containing resorcinol–formaldehyde composite gel in air. SEM images show that these bowl-like hollow Co3O4 microspheres are made up of hollow inner cavities and outer shell walls, on which a large number of mesopores are distributed. When employed as an anode for LIBs, this Co3O4 electrode shows excellent cycling performance, maintaining 111% after 50 cycles, due to a rise in capacity, and a good rate capability of 650 mA h g−1 at 5C. In contrast, in SIBs, this material exhibits similar features in its discharge/charge profiles but relatively moderate capacity retention if compared with the performance in LIBs. Therefore, there is still room for its further improvement.40
In addition, some other transition metal oxides were prepared to enhance the performance of L/SIBs. Sun and co-workers manufactured ultrathin NiO nanosheets using a simple solvothermal method with a subsequent annealing process at 300 °C for 2 h in air. Notably, such nanosheets showed significantly superior performance to bulk or micro-scale structures. For Li storage, the as-obtained material delivers a reversible specific capacity of 1242 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 250 mA h g−1 at 15 A g−1. The capacity for Li storage remains at 851 mA h g−1 after 170 cycles at 2 A g−1. For Na storage, NiO nanosheets demonstrate an impressive reversible specific capacity of 299 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density, and the capacity remains as high as 154 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. Upon charge/discharge cycles, the specific capacity remains as high as 266 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g−1.20 Subsequently, a new facile aqueous sol–gel process was demonstrated by Yang and co-workers for the fabrication of anatase TiO2 nanoplates with uniform nanopores and particle sizes. In LIBs, the anatase nanoplates display a performance of 100 mA h g−1 at 10C, still maintaining a capacity of 150 mA h g−1 at 5C for 500 cycles. The anatase nanoplates also exhibit decent rate capability in SIBs with a capacity of 53 mA h g−1 at 30C.41 In the same year, Chang et al. explored a facile route to prepare hierarchical TiO2 microspheres via an arginine-assisted solvothermal reaction. Examined as promising anode materials, the as-prepared hierarchical TiO2 microspheres displayed a satisfactory specific capacity of 241 mA h g−1 for LIBs and 145 mA h g−1 for SIBs after 100 cycles at 0.1C.42
In addition to all the materials above, a few dimetallic oxides are also available for use as dual anodes. Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) has been a typical candidate since 2008 because of its notable advantages such as a flat, high potential plateau, so many researchers have made every effort to enhance it.43 Feng et al. synthesized ultrathin LTO nanosheets with ordered microstructures via a polyether-assisted hydrothermal process. Pluronic P123, a polyether, can affect the growth of Li2TiO3 in the precursor and plays the role of a structure-directing agent to help the (Li1.81H0.19)Ti2O5·2H2O precursor to form the LTO nanosheets with the desired ordered microstructure. Moreover, the addition of P123 can suppress the stacking of LTO nanosheets during calcination of the precursor, and the thickness of the nanosheets can be controlled to be approximately 4 nm. Because of the enhanced structure and suitable addition, the ultrathin P123-assisted LTO nanosheets display an excellent rate capability in an LIB with a capacity of over 130 mA h g−1 remaining at a rate of 64C. For the intercalation of Na+ shown in Fig. 2f, the P-LTO still shows a performance of 115 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10C and a capacity retention of 96% after 400 cycles.44 Furthermore, Zhou and co-workers fabricated LTO nanorods by a hydrothermal approach utilizing TiO2-B as the titanium source and template. It can be observed that such LTO nanorods are 100–200 nm in diameter and 1–2 mm in length. The LTO nanorods not only deliver a high discharge capacity of approximately 101.1 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 20C as LIB anodes but also exhibit extraordinary performance in Na storage, having a reversible capacity of 131.6 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1C.5 Other dimetallic oxides were also synthesized. High-purity Zn2GeO4 and Zn2SnO4 nanowires were synthesized by Lim and co-workers via a hydrothermal process and have great potential for application in high-performance L/SIBs. The nanowires had a uniform morphology and were made up of single-crystalline rhombohedral (Zn2GeO4) and cubic (Zn2SnO4) phases. For LIBs, Zn2GeO4 and Zn2SnO4 exhibited a performance of 1220 and 983 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively. The performance was 342 mA h g−1 and 306 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 2g) in SIBs, respectively.3 In addition, Ma et al. fabricated BaMoO4via a facile hydrothermal method. The SEM images showed beautiful flower-like BaMoO4 that consisted of many microrods (Fig. 2d). As an anode material for LIBs, BaMoO4 demonstrates a reversible capacity of 410 mA h g−1 after 900 cycles at 200 mA g−1. It also displays a discharge capacity of 50 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1 in SIBs.45 Moreover, Chen and co-workers designed and prepared hollow, porous NiCo2O4-nanoboxes (NCO-NBs) utilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) nanocrystals as the template followed by an annealing treatment. When tested in LIBs, the discharge capacity of the NCO-NBs remained at 1080 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1. The Na storage behavior of NCO-NBs helped to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 826 mA h g−1, and a moderate capacity retention of 328 mA h g−1 was maintained in the 30th cycle.46
3. Carbon-based materials
Since LIBs were first commercialized by Sony in 1991, graphite has become the dominant negative electrode material because of its low cost and high energy density. Graphite anodes can accommodate one Li atom for every six C atoms in LIBs. In regard to SIBs, carbon anodes can provide organic complexes for the storage of Na+. Hence, there is much discussion about various carbon-based materials for L/SIBs. Many researchers have made every effort to prepare new carbon-based dual materials or improve the structures.
Dual anodes with porous structures have been studied by many people. Yu et al. successfully prepared a phenol–formaldehyde resin-based hard-carbon aerogel (PFR-HCA) that used the chelation principle of phenol and Fe3+via a facile ion-catalyzed method. This material contains a three-dimensionally interconnected carbon network embedded with hydrogen-rich, ordered microstructures of expanded nanographites and carbon micropores. The chelation effect enables the free rearrangement of graphene sheets into expanded nanographite and carbon micropores; thus, the material shows a specific structural merit when compared with some other conventional carbon anode materials. For Li+ intercalation in mPFR-HCA, the CV shows five well-defined peaks: those at 1.82, 1.55, and 1.16 V versus Li+/Li are irreversible, while those at 0.20 and <0.05 V are reversible. In SIBs, the mPFR-HCA shows a broad peak starting at 1.0 V in the initial cathodic process.47 In addition, Zhang and co-workers fabricated porous graphene films (PGFs) through a specific filtration process together with thermal reduction and subsequent removal of the metal (Fig. 3f). When applied as an anode in LIBs, PGF-1 delivered fairly high rate performances of 971, 298, and 163 mA h g−1 at 10, 30, and 50 A g−1 after 10000 cycles, respectively (Fig. 3i). When applied in SIBs, PGF-1 showed a reversible capacity of 195 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles. It is important to note that the porous structure of the material enabled fast diffusion and transfer of Li+/Na+ and electrons throughout the electrodes.2 Furthermore, a new experiment involving the direct pyrolysis of zinc citrate followed by washing with dilute hydrochloric acid has been demonstrated by Liu et al. for the fabrication of the floral variant of mesoporous carbon. The floral variant of mesoporous carbon shows a tremendous reversible Li storage capacity up to 1370 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. When it is used in SIBs, the reversible capacity is up to 438.5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 30 mA g−1 and remains at 68.7 mA h g−1 at an enhanced current density of 10 A g−1.48 Moreover, novel nitrogen-doped porous carbon scaffolds (NPCSs) were successfully prepared by Lu et al. through a facile bottom-up solution-phase procedure. The as-prepared NPCS anode has satisfactory advantages for both Li and Na storage due to its large surface area, appropriate pore volume, nanosheet-like morphology, a certain degree of graphitization, etc. When tested in LIBs, the NPCSs display an outstanding reversible capacity of 1275 mA h g−1 in the 250th cycle at 0.5C and promising cycling stabilities with a performance of 518 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 5C and 310 mA h g−1 after 1500 cycles even up to 10C. When used in SIBs, the anode delivers a reversible capacity of 257 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and excellent long-term cycling performance with a capacity of 191 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 200 mA g−1.49

Nitrogen (N)-doped or N-rich carbon materials were also widely applied as promising dual anodes. A special alfalfa leaf-derived N-rich ordered mesoporous carbon (ALNOMC) material has great potential to offer extraordinary dual functionality as a negative electrode for L/SIBs. This material has been prepared by Zhang et al. via a ball-milling-assisted SBA-15 template approach. The obtained material has a superficial area of 727.8 m2 g−1, significant mesoporous structures and an N-content of 7.19 wt%. For LIBs, ALNOMC displays an excellent reversible capacity of 1635 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, a satisfactory rate capability of 492 mA h g−1 at a rate of 5 A g−1 and a cycling stability of 924 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1 A g−1. When tested in SIBs, ALNOMC provides a high initial reversible capacity of 433 mA h g−1 and a stable reversible capacity of 407 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. The rate and cycling performances are also satisfactory, being as high as 218 mA h g−1 even after 200 cycles at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 3j).50 In addition, in order that the storage performance of carbon-based materials can be ulteriorly optimized, Ma et al. prepared hierarchical porous N-rich carbon (HPNC) nanospheres derived from the acidic etching of metal carbide/carbon hybrid nanoarchitectures. From the FESEM images in Fig. 3c, numerous micropores and mesopores that serve as reservoirs for storing Li+/Na+ can be seen clearly. The extremely high content of N of 17.4 wt% can offer many electroactive sites and enlarge the interlayer distance, thus improving the capacity. Owing to all of these advantages, HPNC-based anodes show a remarkable reversible capacity of 1187 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1, an outstanding rate performance of 470 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1 and great cycling stability with a performance of 788 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 in LIBs. When applied in SIBs, such anodes deliver a reversible capacity of 357 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and long-term stability with a performance of 136 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 500 cycles.14 Moreover, novel prawn-shell derived carbon (PSC) was successfully synthesized by Elizabeth and co-workers via an environmentally benign method. The material possesses a high inherent N content of 5.3% and has a special porous structure with the existence of macropores, mesopores and micropores. A PSC anode for LIBs exhibits an excellent reversible specific capacity of 740 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 for 150 cycles. When applied in SIBs, PSC also displays a reversible specific capacity of 325 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles and a superior rate capability of 107 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1.12 In addition to the employment of natural waste material (prawn shells), there was another economically viable approach to prepare similar materials. Selvamani et al. successfully fabricated N-doped porous carbon originating from garlic peel with the procedure of pre-carbonization with subsequent alkali impregnation. The LIBs showed reversible capacities of approximately 320, 280, 215 and 145 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 A g−1, respectively. Similarly, discharge capacities of approximately 142, 89, 58, and 37 mA h g−1 have been achieved at the current densities of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 A g−1, respectively, in one specific type of SIB.51 Furthermore, Wang et al. manufactured porous N-doped carbon networks consisting of ultrathin carbon nanosheets through direct pyrolysis of Vitamin B5. The obtained material has an excellent Li storage capacity of 1534 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and a Na storage capacity of 335 mA h g−1 at the same current rate. The material can also be used in a zinc–air battery.52 Additionally, chemical treatment of Fe3O4@C precursors utilizing HNO3 at low temperature was performed by Zhang and co-workers. They successfully fabricated N-doped porous interconnected double-shelled hollow carbon spheres (N-DHCSs). In LIBs, the N-DHCSs deliver a performance of 512 mA h g−1 at 1.5C after 500 cycles, and their porous interconnected double-shelled hollow structure is still very well-maintained. The N-DHCSs also exhibit a high reversible capacity of 598 mA h g−1 at 1C when cycled at different current densities. While acting as an anode material for SIBs, the N-DHCSs reveal a satisfactory reversible capacity of 120 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 100 cycles.53
Carbon-based materials related to nanostructures are also regarded as a class of promising candidates among the limited choices of anode materials for L/SIBs. Gaddam et al. successfully synthesized carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) derived from coconut oil via a flame deposition approach. After that, the CNPs were further optimized with piranha solution to obtain surface-carboxylated carbon nanoparticles (c-CNPs). In SIBs, the CNPs and c-CNPs, respectively, displayed 2nd-cycle discharge capacities of 277 and 278 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1; in the 20th cycle, the capacities of the above two materials were 217 and 206 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 3g and h). The data reveal that the modification of the CNPs with the piranha solution enhanced neither the charge storage capacity nor the stability against cycling in SIBs. However, when the CNP and c-CNP were used as negative electrodes in LIBs, 2nd-cycle discharge capacities of 741 and 742 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 were obtained, respectively; after 20 cycles, the capacities reached 464 and 577 mA h g−1, respectively, showing that the cycling stability of the CNPs was enhanced to some extent after the modification process.18 In addition, N and oxygen (O) co-doped carbon nanobubbles were prepared by Song et al. via a facile process involving silica-templated ionic liquid impregnation and an annealing process, the scheme of which can be easily understood (Fig. 3a). The obtained carbon nanobubbles feature multiscale nanopores and abundant graphitic zones of a few layers in the thin shells of several nanometers thickness. When tested as anode materials for LIBs at a current density of 1 A g−1, the carbon nanobubbles display an initial discharge capacity of over 3000 mA h g−1 and a high irreversible capacity of more than 1500 mA h g−1. In SIBs, the electrodes show superior Na+ storage capability with a performance of more than 120 and 60 mA h g−1 for 30 cycles when galvanostatically discharged at 100 and 200 mA g−1, respectively.54 In addition, new eco-friendly techniques for carbon capture and conversion were applied by Licht et al. for the fabrication of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) in a high yield, utilizing a solar thermal electrochemical process. Owing to the obtained nanostructures, the anode shows an improved storage capacity of more than 370 mA h g−1 for Li and 130 mA h g−1 for Na with almost no capacity loss during durability tests even after 200 and 600 cycles, respectively. This study shows that ambient CO2, which is often regarded as an environmental pollutant, can also be of great economic significance in portable or grid-scale energy storage applications.55 Moreover, Jin and co-workers synthesized a series of hard carbon nanofiber-based electrodes originating from electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers (PAN-CNFs) by stabilization in air at approximately 280 °C and then carbonization in N2 at heat treatment temperatures (HTTs) between 800 and 1500 °C. Although the anodes in SIBs deliver relatively lower rate capability when compared with those in LIBs, they still achieve a reversible capacity of 275 mA h g−1 and similar cycling stability due to their special structure.56 After this, Li and co-workers concluded the latest studies on carbon nanofiber applications in L/SIBs, including the developments in the structures and composition of CNF-based electrode materials. As shown in their review, CNFs can display superior Li and Na storage performance when they are applied as negative electrode materials by template and activation strategies to produce a sufficient number of intercalation sites.57 Furthermore, Liu et al. manufactured cheese-like bulk carbon with nanoholes via a facile annealing approach by utilizing distilled water as a green, clean “corrosive agent”. The good performance in L/SIBs reveals that such cheese-like bulk carbon with nanoholes has great potential to combine with other nanosized materials, which act as a specific framework to enhance electrochemical capacity jointly in future work.58 Additionally, a new and simple approach has been demonstrated for the fabrication of carbon nanosheets derived from cheap and abundant petroleum asphalt. Wang et al. found this recyclable way of carbonization of petroleum asphalt in molten salts. The as-obtained carbon nanosheets show a high reversible specific capacity of 729 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, a superior cyclability of approximately 600 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles and a greatly enhanced rate performance of 280 mA h g−1 at a 5 A g−1 rate in LIBs. Meanwhile, they deliver a reversible capacity of 300 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and can maintain a performance of 95 mA h g−1 even after 10000 cycles at 2 A g−1 in SIBs.59
In recent years, some other carbon-based materials that can play a dual role have been reported. Lv et al. synthesized carbonaceous photonic crystals (CPCs) through carbonization of butterfly wings (Fig. 3b). The carbonization-induced micropores and mesopores in the ridges and ribs can further promote electrolyte penetration and shorten the ion diffusion distances as a result. Due to the carbonization temperature, rich contents of O and N heteroatoms on the carbon surfaces can provide extra sites for reversible Li+/Na+ adsorption and enhance the electrochemical reactivity and electronic conductivity. For L/SIB applications, the obtained CPC (CPC800) by carbonization at 800 °C displays the best performances. CPC800 offers satisfactory specific capacities of 590 and 235 mA h g−1 at the same 0.05 A g−1 for L/SIBs, respectively. More importantly, CPC800 delivers ultra-long cycling stability, maintaining 5 A g−1 and 1 A g−1 for more than 10000 cycles with no evident observation of the fading of capacity for either LIBs or SIBs, respectively.60 In addition, Lv et al. fabricated porous hard carbons (PSDHCs) originating from peanut shells via a pyrolysis method. After that, from the activated peanut shells in KOH solution, the PSDHC-600A produced by pyrolysis at 600 °C is found to offer greatly improved Li+/Na+ storage (Fig. 3e). For applications in LIBs, PSDHC-600A displays a sustained capacity of 474 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1 A g−1, greater than 314 mA h g−1 of PSDHC-600. Similarly, for SIBs, a performance of 193 mA h g−1 is maintained after 400 cycles at 0.25 A g−1, better than that of PSDHC-600.61 In addition, Jiang and co-workers prepared three-dimensional (3D) rod-like carbon micro-structures derived from ramie fibers and corncobs by heat treatment at 700 °C under an argon atmosphere. The biomass carbon derived from corncobs can be seen in Fig. 3d. In LIBs, the specific capacity still remained at 489 and 606 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles when cycled at room temperature at 100 mA g−1, while it showed a reversible Na intercalation capacity of 122 and 139 mA h g−1 with similar cycling stability.62 Moreover, the fabrication of a 3D cellular architecture of sulfur (S)-doped graphene was recently reported by Islam and co-workers. This material can be obtained by utilizing the facile self-assembly of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-poly(styrene sulfonate) polymer chains on graphene oxide with a subsequent thermal process, and its unique structures can be clearly seen in Fig. 3d. The as-prepared material shows excellent energy storage capabilities of 1697 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 472 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 for L/SIBs, respectively. Specifically, it can be applied in a flexible aqueous symmetric supercapacitor (367 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) at the same time.63 Furthermore, activated non-graphitizable orange peel-derived hard carbon (OPDHC-A) was successfully manufactured by Xiang et al. by pyrolysis at 800 °C and KOH activation. Initial capacities of 878 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 for LIBs and 497 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 for SIBs were obtained.64
4. Alloys
Metal alloy anodes, especially those made of antimony (Sb), tin (Sn) or cobalt (Co), have been studied widely for use in LIBs or SIBs in recent years. Since they commonly deliver better performance than pure metal anodes, exploring such materials that can play a dual role is also important.
Liu et al. successfully prepared porous Ni3Sn2 microcages consisting of tiny nanoparticles via a large-scale, simple template-free solvothermal approach, referring to the mechanism of Ostwald ripening and etching as shown in Fig. 4a. The obtained Ni3Sn2 porous microcages deliver decent discharge capacities of 700 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 0.2C and 530 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1C for LIBs (Fig. 4b). In regard to Na storage, a stable reversible capacity of approximately 270 mA h g−1 at 1C remains after 300 cycles (Fig. 4d). This material is ideal, owing to the shortened ion-diffusion distance, high contact surface area, and good electronic conductivity, together with the mechanical capacity to accommodate the volume variations of Sn.31 Moreover, Zhao and co-workers synthesized homogeneous alloys composed of Bi and Sb through a specific mechanical milling with carbon. Bi0.57Sb0.43–C and Bi0.36Sb0.64–C have been prepared at the same time, and they both show much better electrochemical performances than their Bi–C or Sb–C counterparts. For instance, in LIBs, the Bi0.57Sb0.43–C delivers high rate capabilities of 355 mA h g−1 at 5C rate and 326 mA h g−1 at a 7.8C rate. In the case of SIBs as shown in Fig. 4e, its initial desodiation capacity is 375 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of about 78% in the 50th cycle.65 Additionally, Yi and co-workers prepared a series of hollow, dendritic, or mixed-type Sn–Sb alloys with different microstructures/nanostructures via a simple one-pot method utilizing the principle of replacement reactions. It is proved that the Sn–Sb hollow spheres thus obtained show a particularly high discharge capacity of 820.7 mA h g−1 after the first cycle and a reversible capacity of 751 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 for LIBs. The hollow Sn–Sb material also displays a satisfactory specific capacity of 451.3 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 150 cycles when tested in SIBs.66 Furthermore, a new approach utilizing metal chlorides as precursors with sodium borohydride as a reductant has been demonstrated by Walter et al. for the fabrication of inexpensive colloidal SnSb nanocrystals (NCs). The obtained SnSb NCs are 10–30 nm in size. SnSb NC anodes for LIBs display capacities of 890 mA h g−1 for 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1 and show outstanding rate capability, reaching 90% and 80% of the theoretical capacity at current densities of 1000 and 5000 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 4c). Similarly, SnSb NCs also exhibit satisfactory Na storage properties with a fading of only 5% capacity up to 100 cycles at 5000 mA g−1.67 Additionally, Mo3Sb7 thin films were manufactured by Baggetto et al. via a special magnetron sputtering method. The obtained films are amorphous and consist of small agglomerated domains with an Sb/Mo ratio of 2.34 in all. When cycled in batteries, the films deliver high storage capacities of about 430 mA h g−1 for Li and 330 mA h g−1 for Na. Besides, micron-thick films maintain capabilities of around 310 and 280 mA h g−1 at quite high rates of 100 and 30C for Li and Na, respectively.68 Moreover, an amorphous Co–Sn alloy was co-electroplated on a 3D framework of nickel foam (Fig. 4f). The CoSn2 phase was then formed after annealing at 200 °C (Fig. 4g). This abovementioned experiment was done by González and co-workers. The observed real capacity values are in the range of 0.2 to 6 mA h cm−1, and the specific capacity value of this CoSn2 on a Ni foam substrate is approximately 800 mA h g−1.69

5. Metal sulfides (MS)
The reserves of metal sulfides are abundant and they generally exist in minerals. Their multidimensional morphologies can highly enrich charge-storage and electron-transport abilities in batteries. So far, Bi2S3, Cu2S, VS2, etc., have been successfully prepared as stable and durable anodes for L/SIBs.70
Since bismuth (Bi)-based compounds were proven to have larger capacity and more satisfactory operating potential compared with graphite,71 Liu et al. synthesized beautiful chrysanthemum-like specially nanostructured Bi2S3 (Fig. 4h). For Li storage, a performance of 480 mA h g−1 could still be maintained stably after 300 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. For Na storage, the obtained B2S3 material retained 437 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles.72 Wang and co-workers synthesized a H monolayer and T bulk vanadium disulfide (VS2) using density functional theory. The obtained VS2 was a typical family member of 2D layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (LTMDs) that have outstanding metallic properties. It is calculated that the performance of VS2 can reach 466 mA h g−1.73 Additionally, in order to study the different nanoscale reaction pathways in a sulfide material for L/SIBs, Boebinger and co-workers investigated the Cu2S dual anode material. They found that the Cu2S electrode showed similar phase transformations in L/SIBs; however, the nanoscale reaction pathways were quite different, which caused the observed distinctions in their electrochemical performance. In spite of such dissimilarities, SIBs delivered impressive cycling performance with negligible capacity fading even up to 400 cycles, which was similar to that for Li storage. Thus, by comparing Na (with a larger atomic radius) to Li, they finally reached an important conclusion that greater volume changes during a reaction do not necessarily lead to faster capacity decay but sometimes do cause the reaction to proceed through a different pathway.74 Apart from this, SnS2 nanoplates were successfully fabricated by Xie and co-workers via a facile hydrothermal approach using SnCl4·5H2O and thioacetamide. In LIBs, these SnS2 nanoplates demonstrated a good reversible capacity of 515 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 50 cycles. When used as SIB anodes, they displayed a reversible capacity of 241.5 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, retaining approximately 70% of the initial reversible capacity.75 Sb2S3 hollow microspheres have been newly synthesized by Xie et al. through a facile hydrothermal reaction, which display a discharge capacity of 674 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1 after 50 cycles in LIBs and a prominent reversible discharge capacity of 384 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 50 cycles in SIBs.76
6. Composite materials
Composite materials are often one of the most frequent choices in regard to choosing appropriate electrode materials for various kinds of batteries. Composites can not only keep the advantages of each component, but also achieve better properties by correlation of components. For L/SIBs, different composite materials have been widely prepared and optimized in order to enhance their performance. In particular, materials that contain carbon have attracted more attention.77,78
6.1 Metal oxides/carbon-based materials (MO/C)
Iron oxides/carbon-based composite materials are quite common and typical. Wang et al. successfully synthesized Fe3O4@CNT through a facile thermal decomposition way by filling carbon nanotube (CNT) channels with a dense and uniform distribution of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The voids in the nanostructure and the fact that most SEIs are formed on the surfaces of the CNT shells instead of on individual Fe3O4 nanoparticles contributed to the satisfactory rate capability and cycling performance of this material. The comparisons exhibited evident advantages as shown in Fig. 5e. Hence, when tested for LIBs, the Fe3O4@CNT nanocomposite showed a high reversible capacity of 720 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1 A g−1, and the specific capacity was 400 mA h g−1 at a current density as high as 8 A g−1. For SIBs, a performance of 377 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 was obtained after 300 cycles.28 In addition, Fe3O4, carbon-coated Fe3O4, and carbon-coated Fe3O4 embedded on carbon nanotubes were simultaneously prepared by Park and co-workers. SEM analysis clearly showed that the particle size of the as-prepared Fe3O4 ranges from 100 to 250 nm, while that of carbon-coated Fe3O4 ranges from 10 to 15 nm in diameter and is surrounded by a thin carbon layer originating from sucrose. At the same time, the C/Fe3O4 embedded on CNTs can maintain high capacities of 620 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles with 78% capacity retention in LIBs and 298 mA h g−1 in the 50th cycle with 93% capacity retention in SIBs during cycling. Particularly, the exhibited charge capacities are sufficiently high at different rates: 516 mA h g−1 and 196 mA h g−1 at a rate of 2400 mA g−1 for L/SIBs, respectively.79 Furthermore, a new, simple and effective co-precipitation approach has been found by Fu et al. for the manufacturing of diamond-like Fe3O4 nanoparticle/graphene composites (Fig. 5c). When tested in LIBs, the obtained composite reveals a specific capacity of 1430 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 100 cycles with an initial discharge capacity of 855 mA h g−1 in SIBs.80

TiO2/carbon-based materials have also been commonly studied. For example, an N-doped TiO2 nanorods/carbon dot composite has been fabricated by Yang et al. using a facile hydrothermal reaction process involving TiO2 powder (P25) and NaOH in the presence of carbon dots followed by ion exchange and calcination. The material exhibits excellent performance due to the unique merits of the decorating C-dots, N-doping, and nanostructure design. As a consequence, when applied as an anode in LIBs, the composite can display a specific capacity of 185 mA h g−1 with a 91.6% retention even at 10C after 1000 cycles. When cycled against Na, the specific capacity reaches 166 mA h g−1 with 93.6% retention at 5C after 300 cycles.81 Furthermore, in order to optimize the electrochemical kinetics of a TiO2 anode, a hybrid material of ultra-small TiO2 nanoparticles grown in situ on graphene nanosheets was prepared by Liu and co-workers via unique ultraphonic and reflux approaches. The size of the TiO2 particles was approximately 10 nm, and these particles were evenly distributed across the rGO nanosheets. This hybrid TiO2@rGO showed advantages in LIBs, but when used as the anode of an SIB, its performance and rate capacity were even better. A capacity of 186.6 mA h g−1 was achieved after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 current density, and a capacity of 112.2 mA h g−1 could be retained at 1.0 A g−1.82 In addition, Li et al. prepared N and sulfur (S) co-doped hollow carbon nanofibers decorated with S-doped anatase TiO2 (NS–HCNF@S–TiO2) via a hydrothermal reaction followed by calcination. When used as an anode for L/SIBs, NS–HCNF@S–TiO2 exhibited a reversible capacity of 253.8 and 193.8 mA h g−1 in the 50th cycle for Li and Na storage, respectively.83
Several different SnO2/carbon-based materials were synthesized in order to solve the large volume-expansion drawbacks of previously reported SnO2-based materials. A novel SiO2-supported-SnO2/C (HBS–SnO2/C) nanocomposite with sufficient internal voids was prepared by Yang et al. via a template-based approach. As can clearly be seen from the SEM image in Fig. 5f, the as-prepared composite was quite special with a hollow bean-pod-like shape. When using such a composite as an anode material, a discharge capacity of 649 mA h g−1 can be observed after 550 cycles for LIBs, while a discharge capacity of 104 mA h g−1 can still be retained even after 1000 charge/discharge cycles for SIBs.84 Additionally, Chen and co-workers proposed a facile, effective and inexpensive approach to the fabrication of a specific SnO2/graphene composite. In their synthesis process, SnO2 nanoparticles were anchored uniformly on graphene sheets by Sn–O–C bonding under constant pressure and at a temperature of 80 °C for 4 h. When used as an anode material for LIBs, this composite shows a reversible capacity of 1420 mA h g−1 after 90 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and a great cycle performance of up to 97% at 1 A g−1 after 230 cycles. In SIBs, it retains a performance of 1280 and 650 mA h g−1 at 0.05 and 0.2 A g−1 after 90 cycles, respectively.85
In addition, some other metal oxides containing Sb, Ni, Co, etc., were also composited with carbon-based materials to afford outstanding Li and Na storage performance. Wang et al. synthesized ultrathin NiO nanosheets grown on the surface of hollow carbon (HC) microspheres via a precipitation method followed by annealing. The anode material thus obtained is a novel hierarchical core–shell composite, which can clearly be observed from the SEM images (Fig. 5g). For LIBs, the HC@NiO composite exhibits a specific capacity of 992 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. For Na storage, a reversible capacity of 309 mA h g−1 remains after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 current density. It is important that the enhanced electrochemical properties of the HC@NiO composite for L/SIBs can be attributed to the superior electrical conductivity of the HC support and the high loading content of the ultrathin NiO nanosheets.86 Moreover, a new type of SbxOy/C composite was prepared by Bitner-Michalska and co-workers. The thin layers of graphitic carbon decorated in 3D with Sb nanoparticles were derived from organic precursors triphenylantimony(III) utilizing a one-step microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) approach. The Sb/C electrodes displayed a reversible capacity of 425 mA h g−1 at C/10 discharge rate in either Li+ or Na+ systems.87 Furthermore, layered TiNb2O7/graphene composites (TNO/G) were fabricated by Li et al. via simple direct dispersion and blending in an aqueous solvent with subsequent freeze-drying and annealing under Ar (Fig. 5a). Microscopy analysis clearly showed that the TNO nanoparticles were uniformly anchored on the graphene nanosheets. The TNO/G composite delivers an impressive rate capability reaching approximately 180 mA h g−1 at 38.7 A g−1, which is superior to pure TNO or graphene only. A reversible capacity of 340.2 mA h g−1 can be obtained in SIBs from this material at a current density of 25 mA g−1, as graphene plays the role of an active material during the de-sodiation process. Even up to 200 mA g−1, a stable performance of 200 mA h g−1 can still be achieved.4 Besides, cubic spinel MnCo2O4/graphene sheet (MCO/GS) nanocomposites showed great potential, which were synthesized by Chen et al. through a simple hydrothermal way followed by annealing. Nano-sized MnCo2O4 particles are uniformly embedded in paper-like graphene sheets, presenting a special nanoparticles-on-sheets hybrid nanostructure, with a particle size of approximately 20–50 nm. Acting as anodes for LIBs, the as-synthesized MCO/GS electrodes show a high initial reversible discharge capacity of 1350.4 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, a superior rate capability of 462.1 mA h g−1 at a rate of 4000 mA g−1 and a promising cycling performance of 584.3 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1 after 250 cycles. Similarly, these MCO/GS electrodes deliver satisfactory electrochemical characteristics in SIBs.88 In addition, Wu and co-workers proposed the fabrication of yolk–shell carbon-based Co3O4 dodecahedrons by a simple interface-modulated procedure. The material was derived from previously prepared ZIF-67 dodecahedrons (Fig. 5h). When tested in LIBs, the Co3O4/C composite delivers a high specific capacity and outstanding cycling stability of 1100 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 120 cycles. In SIBs, it shows a superior rate capability of 307 and 269 mA h g−1 at rates of 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively.89
Finally, another class of composites, which are commonly referred to as ternary composites, has also received extensive attention in broad applications, especially those obtained by hybridizing SnO2 with carbon-based materials. Zhao and co-workers successfully fabricated a novel nanostructure of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)-in-SnO2-in-carbon layer (MWNTs@SnO2@C) composites via a rational method. As seen from the schematic illustration, the MWNTs were first sequentially coated with thick SiO2, SnO2, thin SiO2, and carbon layers step by step. After removing the SiO2 layers, the final MWNTs@SnO2@C composite with a large internal void space could be obtained (Fig. 5b), which could effectively accommodate the volume changes of SnO2 during Li+ or Na+ insertion/extraction cycles. When tested in LIBs, the obtained MWNTs@SnO2@C composite showed a high discharge capacity of 944 mA h g−1 after 100 successive discharge/charge cycles, which was much more impressive when compared with most of the former reported SnO2-based composites (Fig. 5d). As an anode material for SIBs, when at a rate of 50 mA g−1, the composite still retained a charge capacity of 300 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 76% over 60 cycles. The electrode also revealed outstanding long-term cycling performance and rate capabilities in L/SIBs.90 Moreover, Yue et al. successfully prepared triple-walled SnO2@N-doped carbon@SnO2 nanotubes via the deposition of SnO2 nanoparticles on the external and internal surfaces of PPy nanotubes, with a subsequent low-temperature calcination process in Ar. This nanocomposite showed a unique structure, which can be seen from the SEM images in Fig. 5i. It was the structure that assured better charge-transfer kinetics to all of the SnO2 nanoparticles and offered suitable space to accommodate the volume deformation of SnO2 on/in the nanotubes. Thus, when the obtained nanocomposite was utilized as an anode for LIBs, it displayed a reversible capacity of 935 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1 and 658 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 5j). For SIBs, its capacity could be maintained at 492 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 25 mA g−1.91 In addition, a unique yolk–shell structured SnO2@void@C porous nanowire was designed and manufactured by Li and co-workers through etching the SiO2 layer and some SnO2 of previously obtained SnO2@SiO2@C nanowires. This composite delivers a promising capacity of 1150 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1 for LIBs and a performance of 401 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles for Na storage, which is more satisfactory when compared with formerly reported pure SnO2 porous nanowires as anode materials.35 Another ternary composite, which contained Fe2O3, was also designed. Zhao et al. fabricated a novel yolk–shell Fe2O3@C composite anchored on MWNTs. Owing to the good electrical conductivity of MWNTs and carbon layers and the void space to improve the volume expansion/extraction of Fe2O3 when cycling, the obtained MWNT@Fe2O3@C composite revealed great potential to be an ideal dual anode material for L/SIBs. For Li storage, this electrode still displayed a high charge capacity of 1024 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, even after 360 successive cycles. In the case of SIBs, this material could retain a discharge capacity of 272 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of approximately 98%.23 Furthermore, Zhou et al. fabricated a novel 3D graphene-encapsulated CNT@SnO2 (CNT@SnO2@G) negative electrode using a two-step hydrothermal method. The resultant material displays an initial discharge capacity of 1400 mA h g−1 and an enhanced reversible capacity of 947 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 for Li storage, while for Na storage testing, an outstanding discharge capacity of 323 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 25 mA g−1 can be achieved.92
6.2 Metal sulfides/carbon-based materials (MS/C)
Metal sulfides were also composited with carbon-based materials to prepare advanced negative electrode materials for L/SIBs. MoS2 composites with various carbon-based materials (graphene, N-doped carbon, carbon nanofibers, etc.) are often regarded as promising dual anode materials for L/SIBs. Zhang et al. successfully synthesized a MoS2@C nanotube composite using a facile hydrothermal sulfuration method, in which amorphous carbon and MoS2 nanotubes were produced simultaneously. From the SEM images (Fig. 6e), a special hollow nanotube core and homogeneous encapsulation of the amorphous carbon shell, which largely enhances the performance of the electrode, can clearly be seen. Thus, the MoS2@C nanotube composite demonstrates a high capacity of 1327 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and a capacity retention of 1058.4 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.5C, which is almost 90% of the initial capacity retention, in the case of LIBs. When it is evaluated as an anode for SIBs, the specific capacity is found to be 480 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 200 cycles (Fig. 6f).93 Liu and co-workers prepared 3D MoS2/graphene nanoribbon aerogel (GNRA) composite structures successfully for the first time by a facile hydrothermal-annealing approach (Fig. 6a). The novel MoS2/GNRA architectures exhibited an impressive rate performance, as a capacity of 303 mA h g−1 can be achieved even at a high rate of 30 A g−1. A long cycling performance for 1800 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1 further proves their excellent stability when tested as anodes for LIBs. The unique hybrid structures also deliver good performance in SIBs. Specific capacities of 372 to 203 mA h g−1 are achieved at current densities ranging from 0.5 to 15 A g−1. A performance of 158 mA h g−1 is maintained even after 1500 cycles at 5 A g−1.16 Unlike the above MoS2/GNRA composite, Kalluri et al. fabricated another unique MoS2/graphene composite. Since ultrathin nanosheets commonly have the advantages of a high specific surface area, good active contact areas and porous channels, novel hierarchical micro-spherical morphologies of well-stacked and completely miscible MoS2 nanosheets and graphene sheets were achieved via a facile and large-scale spray-drying technique. The Li and Na storage properties of such electrodes delivered decent cycling stability over 250 and 500 cycles, respectively, with high initial capacity values of 1300 mA h g−1 and 640 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1.94 Moreover, an N-doped carbon-embedded MoS2 microsphere composite was manufactured by Xie and co-workers using a one-step hydrothermal method with the help of polyurethane as a source of C and N. When tested as an anode for LIBs, the obtained N–C@MoS2 microspheres delivered an initial discharge capacity of approximately 1413 mA h g−1, and a high discharge capacity of approximately 1050 mA h g−1 was maintained after 300 cycles. At the same time, as seen in Fig. 6h, the N–C@MoS2 electrode displayed enhanced high-rate capability compared with C@MoS2, proving its ability to be a promising anode material for SIBs.95 Furthermore, Zhu et al. prepared, for the first time, single-layered MoS2-carbon nanofiber composites derived from electrospinning. When they are tested in LIBs, the capacity was approximately 661 mA h g−1 even after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1. For Na storage, a specific capacity of 854 mA h g−1 was achieved at 0.1 A g−1, and the capacity was 484 and 253 mA h g−1 at 1 and 10 A g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively.96

There are some other metal sulfides/carbon-based composite materials for Li and Na storage. Du and co-workers successfully synthesized Co3S4 porous nanosheets embedded in flexible graphene sheets via a facile freeze-drying method followed by treatment with hydrazine. The robust 3D sandwich-type architecture and porous nanostructure of the Co3S4-PNS/GS composite (Fig. 6c) offers optimized performance for both Li and Na storage. For LIBs, a specific capacity of 710 mA h g−1 is obtained even after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. When evaluated in SIBs, a charge capacity of 329 mA h g−1 and over 71% capacity retention are achieved at 0.5 A g−1 after 50 cycles.17 Moreover, Hameed et al. prepared a novel rGO/Sb2S3 nanocomposite. The stibnite phase of Sb2S3 and its rGO composite were obtained by simple decomposition of a molecular complex Sb(SCOPh)3 and its rGO mixture with a subsequent hydrothermal treatment. When it is tested in LIBs, the theoretical capacity is 473 mA h g−1, and a subsequent alloying reaction forming the Li3Sb alloy causes the total capacity to increase to 946 mA h g−1 (Fig. 6g). The rGO/Sb2S3 nanocomposite can undergo similarly satisfactory electrochemistry with Na storage.97 In addition, ZnS microspheres decorated with N-doped carbon (ZnS@NC) were fabricated via a two-step process by Li and co-workers. From the schematic illustration shown in Fig. 6b, it can be clearly seen that urchin-like ZnS microspheres (Fig. 6d) were coated with polydopamine and next calcined in an inert gas atmosphere. When utilized as a dual anode for L/SIBs, the obtained ZnS@NC reveals a reversible capacity of 690 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and 460 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles at 200 mA g−1 for Li and Na storage, respectively.98 Additionally, Wu et al. prepared FeS@C–N hierarchical porous microspheres consisting of nanosheets using a soft-template solvothermal approach. A performance of 983.5 mA h g−1 could be seen after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and 429.0 mA h g−1 can be retained throughout a long-term cycling test of 1800 cycles at 10 A g−1 in LIBs. The application of FeS@C–N as an anode for SIBs is also investigated and a capacity of 354.5 mA h g−1 is maintained after 500 cycles at 100 mA g−1.99 Furthermore, WS2 nanosheets–carbon composites (WS2/C) were fabricated by Li and co-workers via a two-step process including ball-milling and sulfidation. When used as anode materials for L/SIBs, the composites display a high reversible Li storage capacity of 322 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 100 cycles and a reversible Na storage capacity of 270 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1.100
6.3 Metals/carbon-based materials (M/C)
Materials containing alloying reactions (such as Sb and Sn) have attracted considerable attention due to their appropriate Li and Na inserting potential. To address the drawbacks of large volume changes in pure metal anodes, various metals were widely composited with carbon-based materials to yield better performances. A few Sn/carbon-based material composites greatly optimized the electrochemical performance of L/SIBs. Luo and co-workers prepared a novel hierarchical Sn@C nanocomposite (F-G/Sn@C) by a facile hydrogen-assisted thermal reduction method. As seen, the obtained material consisted of a graphene carbonaceous matrix and uniformly dispersed tin nanoparticles. It shows that a reasonable mass loading of SnO2 NPs on the surface of the graphene plays quite a significant part in the uniform distribution of Sn NPs avoiding agglomeration. When tested as an anode for LIBs, the F-G/Sn@C composite delivers a satisfactory reversible capacity of 506 mA h g−1 even after 500 cycles and a high rate capability of 270 mA h g−1 even at a rate of 3200 mA g−1. In the case of Na storage, a reversible capacity of 413 mA h g−1 with negligible loss is obtained as well (Fig. 7f).32 Moreover, another yolk–shell carbon encapsulated Sn (Sn@C) eggette-like compound (SCE) was successfully fabricated by Li et al. via a simple solvothermal method with subsequent annealing (Fig. 7a). The special Sn@void@carbon structure of the SCE (Fig. 7b) was composed of Sn cores covered by carbon membrane networks with extra voids between the carbon shell and tin cores, which benefited from both the Sn and carbon. In LIBs, the SCE electrode displayed a specific capacity of approximately 850 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, and a high rate capability of approximately 450 mA h g−1 was maintained at a high current density even up to 5000 mA g−1. When used in SIBs, it delivered a specific capacity of around 400 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, and a high rate capacity of approximately 150 mA h g−1 was retained at 5000 mA g−1.101 In addition, a Sn/C nanocomposite derived from cheap and abundant carbon was synthesized by Bresser et al. via an aqueous and highly cost-efficient method. Sn nanoparticles were embedded in micron-sized carbonaceous particles, thus successfully avoiding the aggregation of Sn nanoparticles and relieving the volume strain. The obtained material exhibited remarkable specific capacities of approximately 440 and 390 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1 and 0.2 A g−1, respectively, as Li+ anodes utilizing carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder. In SIBs, this nanocomposite shows specific capacities of over 180, 150 and 90 mA h g−1 for applied specific current densities of 12.2, 122 and 610 mA g−1, respectively.102 Furthermore, Ying and co-workers fabricated Sn/N-doped carbon microcage composites (Sn/NMCs) via a facile spray drying procedure, with a subsequent thermal process (Fig. 7d). As seen from the SEM image in Fig. 7c, the resultant Sn/NMCs show a clear specific open-framework structure with ultra-small Sn nanodots embedded uniformly inside the carbon matrix. Such an anode displays an initial reversible capacity of 780 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 and still retains 472 mA h g−1 in the 500th cycle in LIBs. When used in SIBs, the anode displays an initial reversible capacity of 439 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and retains 332 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles.103

In addition to the above composites, another kind of Sb/C composite was also synthesized by Zhang and co-workers. The Sb/graphene nanohybrid was obtained through a simple in situ solvothermal route utilizing SbCl3 and graphite oxide as the precursors, with NaBH4 as the reducing agent. As can be observed, the sheet-like nanostructure composed of Sb nanocrystals (50–100 nm) was attached on graphene nanosheets with a small number of layers. As seen from the comparisons in Fig. 7e, when the SIB was charged/discharged at 20 or 50 mA g−1 for Sb/G and at 20 mA g−1 for bare Sb, Sb/G showed a clearly superior cycling stability to nano- or milled Sb, and the tested Li storage capacity of Sb/G was higher than the Na storage capacity of either of these materials.104 Bismuth (Bi) has great potential as a stable energy storage material. Novel nanosized-Bi-embedded 1D carbon nanofibers (Bi/C nanofibers) were successfully synthesized by Yin et al. through a single-nozzle electrospinning approach. Four concentrations of BiCl3 (4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%) were prepared at the same time for comparison and were named Bi-4, Bi-6, Bi-8, and Bi-10, respectively. As tested, Bi-6 and Bi-8 exhibit higher capacities of 339.3 and 334.8 mA h g−1, respectively, for LIBs, while their capacities in SIBs are 309.3 and 302.1 mA h g−1, respectively.105
6.4 Other materials
Selenium (Se)-based compounds are usually composited with carbon-based materials when used as dual anodes for enhanced Li/Na storage. Yang et al. successfully prepared porous hollow carbon spheres decorated with MoSe2 nanosheets (MoSe2@PHCS) through an effective three-step method. The conformal and uniform MoSe2 nanosheets, which can help shorten the Li+ and Na+ electronic pathway, are firmly attached to the PHCS. Thus, the MoSe2@PHCS composite displays an excellent reversible Li storage capacity of 681 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. In terms of SIBs, this composite delivers a reversible Na capacity of 580 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. It is important that the optimized electrochemical performance of the MoSe2@PHCS electrode is mainly attributed to the synergic effects of combining the hollow porous carbon spheres and the MoSe2 nanosheets at the nanoscale.106 Another novel MoSe2/C composite with different designs and structures was also reported. The coaxial-cable MoSe2/hollow carbon nanofiber composite was synthesized by Yang and co-workers, applying C and Se as the precursors and a Se/C core–shell composite as the template. When tested as an anode for lithium storage, the coaxial-cable MoSe2/C composite not only demonstrates a decent specific capacity of 658 mA h g−1 and cycling performance of nearly 100% capacity retention even after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 but also delivers a high-rate capability of 524 mA h g−1 at a rate of 3 A g−1. When evaluated in SIBs, specific capacities of 423 and 395 mA h g−1 are achieved at 0.5 and 1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively.107 In addition, a homogeneous nanocomposite of SnSe and carbon black, denoted as the SnSe/C anode, was manufactured by Zhang et al. via a facile and inexpensive high energy ball-milling method. When it was tested in LIBs, a high capacity of approximately 1097.6 mA h g−1 was obtained initially, and then it reduced to 633.1 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Meanwhile, in SIBs, an initial performance of 748.5 mA h g−1 was obtained and well retained at 324.9 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 current density after 200 cycles.108 Furthermore, Zhang et al. fabricated a novel core–shell NiSe/C composite by a two-step approach, in which the NiSe nanospheres were first coated with a thin polydopamine layer by an in situ polymerization process and then calcined under an inert atmosphere. When evaluated as a negative electrode for L/SIBs, the core–shell NiSe/C composite shows a similarly excellent cycling performance within the first 50 cycles.109
Two types of P-based material/C-based material composites were also applied. In order to optimize the cyclability and rate capability of red phosphorus in L/SIBs, Li et al. innovatively confined nanosized amorphous red P into a mesoporous carbon matrix (P@CMK-3) via a facile vaporization–condensation–conversion approach (Fig. 8a). The obtained P@CMK-3 delivers a high reversible specific capacity of around 2250 mA h g−1 at 0.25C, an extraordinary rate capability of 1598 at a rate of 6.1C, and a greatly improved cycling performance of 1150 mA h g−1 at 5C after 1000 cycles when tested in LIBs. For Na storage, the P@CMK-3 composite demonstrates a reversible capacity of 1020 mA h g−1 after 210 cycles at 5C based on the mass of red P.26 Additionally, nanocomposites of black (orthorhombic) phosphorus with carbon were synthesized by Ramireddy and co-workers, further utilizing the advantages of P in that its expected theoretical capacity is up to 2596 mA h g−1 in Li/Na storage. The nanocomposites are able to show impressive initial capacities of approximately 1700 and 1300 mA h g−1 in Li and Na half-cells, respectively. Stable cycling performances at a level of 700 mA h g−1 in LIBs and 350–400 mA h g−1 in SIBs can also be achieved.110 Moreover, Kim et al. successfully fabricated a red P-based P–TiP2–C nanocomposite by an eco-friendly and facile one-step high energy mechanical milling approach. The as-prepared P–TiP2–C nanocomposite delivers a high reversible capacity of 1116 mA h g−1 and a superior initial coulombic efficiency of 86% in LIBs. In the case of SIBs, it exhibits a high initial desodiation capacity of 755 mA h g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 80% and retains 80% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles. It is worth mentioning that the novel presence of the conductive TiP2 inclusions can lead to structural reinforcement by forming a stable LixTiP4 active matrix during lithiation in LIBs and offer a stable conducting inactive matrix in combination with carbon in SIBs, thereby showing excellent performances in L/SIBs when compared with similar electrodes without TiP2.22

There are still some other carbon composite materials playing a dual role in L/SIBs. Wu and co-workers reported the fabrication of 3D yolk–shell-like Ni2P nanoparticles embedded into porous graphene networks (denoted as Ni2P⊂pGN) via a unique assembly and self-template strategy. The composite was derived from the NiNH4PO4·H2O nanocrystal precursor and graphene oxides and had special nanostructural and microstructural features. When applied as an anode for LIBs, the resultant Ni2P⊂pGN electrode displays a discharge capacity of 875 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 550 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. Impressively, the charge capacity is up to 457 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles with nearly no capacity fading when compared with the first cycle (Fig. 8f). In regard to SIBs, the initial discharge and charge capacities are 413 and 214 mA h g−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8g, the Ni2P⊂pGN electrode reveals a charge capacity of 181 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in the initial cycle, and the charge capacity is maintained at 161 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, which is very stable.111 Moreover, since germanium (Ge) is regarded to have comparable Li and Na storage capability, Ge@graphene@TiO2 core–shell nanofibers (Ge@G@TiO2NFs) were prepared by Wang and co-workers. In the synthesis process, Ge@graphene nanofibers derived from electrospinning were first obtained, with the subsequent calcination and atomic layer deposition procedure. The Ge@G@TiO2 electrode displays stable specific capacities of approximately 1050 and 194 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles for L/SIBs, respectively, which were superior to that of Ge or Ge@G. The Ge@G@TiO2 electrode can also afford a high current density, for it can still recover to 1000 and 190 mA h g−1 for L/SIBs, respectively; that is, there is almost no capacity loss after charge/discharge tests.112 Furthermore, Zou et al. successfully manufactured hierarchical hollow NiO/Ni/Graphene composites. Ni-based metal organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs) were first prepared via solvothermal reactions, and then after successive carbonization and oxidation processes, the NiO/Ni nanocrystals covered with a graphene shell were finally obtained. When tested in LIBs, the resultant composites not only delivered a high reversible specific capacity of 1144 mA h g−1 but also showed a great rate capability of 805 mA h g−1 at a rate of 15 A g−1. In SIBs, a good cycle stability of only approximately 0.2% specific capacity fading per cycle and ratability of 207 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 were also observed. Importantly, such an excellent Li and Na storage performance is derived from the well-designed hierarchical hollow ball-in-ball structure which not only mitigates the volume expansion of NiO during the cycles but also offers a continuous highly conductive graphene matrix to promote fast charge transfer and form a stable SEI layer.11 In addition, Gui and co-workers synthesized carbon nanotube@layered nickel silicate (CNT@NiSiOx) coaxial nanocables through a mild hydrothermal approach. The SEM image in Fig. 8d clearly demonstrates that the coaxial structure with NiSiOx nanosheets are well dispersed and attached on CNTs. For Li storage, even after 50 cycles, the charge capacity of the CNT@NiSiOx electrode still reaches up to 489 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1, which is approximately 87% and 360% higher than those of the NiSiOx/CNT mixture and nickel silicate nanotubes, respectively. As anode materials for SIBs, the coaxial nanocables deliver a high initial charge capacity of 576 mA h g−1 and can maintain 213 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 after 16 cycles.9 Moreover, hierarchical Co3ZnC/carbon nanotube-inserted N-doped carbon concave-polyhedrons (Co3ZnC/CNT-NCCPs) were fabricated by Chen et al. via direct pyrolysis of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework precursors under the atmosphere of Ar/H2 followed by calcination treatment. As seen in Fig. 8c, the obtained Co3ZnC/CNT-NCCPs after thermal treatments well inherited the overall polyhedral morphology and size of the bimetallic ZIF precursor. As an anode for LIBs, the electrode displays a decent reversible capacity of around 800 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, an excellent high-rate capability of 408 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1, and a long-term cycling stability of 585 mA h g−1 in the 1500th cycle at 2.0 A g−1. In the case of SIBs, this composite retains a capacity of 386 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 without obvious decay even up to 750 cycles.25
Other TiO2 composites were also synthesized. Liao et al. prepared TiO2-B nanowire arrays coated with MoS2 nanosheets (TiO2-B/MoS2) through a facile two-step hydrothermal process. Owing to the structural stability of TiO2-B nanowire arrays and the high capacity and conductivity of 2D MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. 8e), the composite delivers enhanced performance in many aspects. When tested as an anode for LIBs, the TiO2-B/MoS2 hybrid electrode demonstrates a charge capacity of 350 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, which is superior to the 231 mA h g−1 observed for the uncoated TiO2-B anode under the same conditions. For Na storage, this hybrid can retain a charge capacity of 191 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.19 In addition, novel porous hollow α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanospheres were successfully synthesized by Fu and co-workers via a simple template-assisted method. The SEM images reveal that the resultant α-Fe2O3@TiO2 consists of a hollow inner cavity and an outer shell with massive mesopores. In LIBs, the α-Fe2O3@TiO2 electrode delivers a discharge capacity of 864 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. It is the porous hollow structures that optimize both Li and Na storage in a similar manner.21 Moreover, Yan et al. fabricated bicrystalline titanium dioxide spheres (anatase@TiO2 (B) spheres) using a one-pot solvothermal method (Fig. 8b). The composite has a core–shell structure with TiO2 (B) nanosheets covering the anatase TiO2 sphere core, which was composed of nanoparticles. The anatase@TiO2 (B) spheres reveal an initial discharge capacity of 114.8 mA h g−1 with nearly no capacity decay after 100 cycles, and they retain 91.7 mA h g−1 after 375 cycles at a quite high current density of 5040 mA g−1 for LIBs. They also exhibit satisfactory rate capability in SIBs at various current densities ranging from 85 to 850 mA g−1.113 Self-organized amorphous TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) were successfully prepared on both Ti foil and porous Ti foam by Bi and co-workers via electrochemical anodization techniques. The TiO2 NTAs on Ti foam were applied as anodes for LIBs and showed high capacities of 103 and 83 mA h cm−2 at 10 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively. These values are two to three times higher than those observed with standard Ti foil. In the case of SIBs, the electrode delivered a self-enhanced specific capacity upon cycling at 10 mA cm−2.7
Finally, Liang and co-workers proposed the fabrication of a bio-inspired Bi2S3-polypyrrole (PPy) yolk–shell material as a unique negative electrode for L/SIBs. As seen from the schematic diagram and the synthesis procedure, it can be demonstrated that the flower-like Bi2S3-PPy composite contained Bi2S3 nanowire assemblies embedded intimately in the PPy network. When tested in LIBs, the as-prepared material showed a high cyclability of nearly 99% for 500 cycles and a rate capability of 337 mA h g−1 at a rate of 10C, which outperforms any formerly reported Bi-based materials. This material also exhibits a satisfactory reversible capacity of 591 mA h g−1 in SIBs.114
7. Other materials
Some other novel materials have also been prepared to enhance both Li and Na storage. They largely promote promising energy storage characteristics in terms of stability, energy and power density, lifetime, etc. Sun et al. successfully synthesized a biodegradable bifunctional polydopamine (PDA) electrode material, which was derived from naturally occurring products. The specific synthesis procedure is demonstrated in Fig. 9b. Experiments show that oxidant-induced polymerization and heat treatment can help optimize the electrochemical performance of PDA. Hence, the enhanced PDA derivative endows L/SIBs with excellent capacities of 1818 and 500 mA h g−1, respectively. Stable cyclabilities of 93% capacity retention are achieved after 580 cycles for LIBs, and 100% capacity retention after 1024 cycles is seen for SIBs (Fig. 9h). These values are superior to those of their counterparts using conventional binders. It is of great importance that such organic battery electrode materials originated from renewable and abundant resources. This is critical for “green” batteries, so more researchers in this field should be encouraged to explore high-performance and sustainable electrode materials found in nature.115 Another type of novel material consisting of carbodiimides was also studied by several researchers in recent years. Eguía-Barrio and co-workers reported, for the first time, transition-metal carbodiimides MNCN (M = Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) to be electrochemically active in L/SIBs. They carefully analyzed that Cu and Zn carbodiimides were synthesized in aqueous media from metal chlorides and cyanamide, while Mn carbodiimide was fabricated via a novel metathesis reaction of Li carbodiimide and manganese chloride in stoichiometric amounts utilizing THF as the solvent. Nevertheless, Fe, Co or Ni carbodiimide was prepared in a two-step reaction. First was the synthesis of metal hydrogen dicyanamide in aqueous medium utilizing metal chlorides and cyanamide, followed by the subsequent fabrication of the as-prepared metal carbodiimide in a sealed glass ampoule. These carbodiimides deliver high reversible capacities of approximately 200–800 mA h g−1 for L/SIBs stored by means of conversion reactions and are superior to metal oxides.34 After this, Sougrati and co-workers further studied transition-metal carbodiimides as dual molecular negative electrode materials for L/SIBs. They particularly explored the properties of iron carbodiimide (FeNCN), which was similar to its oxide analogue FeO. The electrochemical reaction mechanism can be understood by the reversible transformation of Fe–NCN into Li/Na–NCN bonds in the processes of discharge and charge. At a current density of 56 mA g−1, the initial reversible capacities of FeNCN toward Li and Na are 600 and 400 mA h g−1, respectively. The FeNCN can retain a stable performance for over 100 cycles at 56 mA g−1versus Li and even over 240 cycles versus Na, while the longest cycle life reported for sophisticated FeO composites is only 50–60 cycles at current densities ranging from 50 to 400 mA g−1.116 In addition, antimony (Sb) hollow nanospheres (HNSs) were synthesized successfully by Hou et al. In the synthesis, Sb HNSs were obtained through galvanic replacement with the participation of Ni NSs (Fig. 9d). Sb HNSs were evaluated for the first time as anode materials for SIBs and displayed a high reversible capacity of 622.2 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 in the 50th cycle. The reversible capacity can also reach 315 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 1600 mA g−1. The advantages of this special hollow structure can be extended to LIBs as well, generating a reversible capacity of 627.3 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.117 Furthermore, Luo et al. prepared an ultra-long Sb2Se3 nanowire-based free-standing membrane through a facile hydrothermal method followed by vacuum filtration (Fig. 9a). The front-view SEM image in Fig. 9c clearly reveals that the obtained membrane is composed of uniform nanowires. When tested in LIBs, the material shows a reversible capacity of 614 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, retaining 584 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. In the case of SIBs, it displays a reversible capacity of 360 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, retaining 289 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.1 Other novel materials were also synthesized or optimized in order to play a dual role. Senguttuvan and co-workers fabricated a new TiP2O7 form (Fig. 9e) via low-temperature synthesis, which does not deliver the superstructure reported formerly if TiP2O7 is obtained by a common ceramic process. Thus, this ensures the flexibility of the new structure. It can reversibly take up both Li+ and Na+, different from the high-temperature polymorph that can only take up Li. Specifically, when tested as an anode material for SIBs, the new TiP2O7 has an initial capacity of 120 mA h g−1 that stabilizes to 50 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles.118 In addition, an ideal candidate anode material for L/SIBs is a high-quality 2D Mo2C monolayer manufactured by Sun et al. through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in the experiments. The Li-adsorbed Mo2C monolayer demonstrated a high theoretical capacity of 526 mA h g−1 and a low average electrode potential of 0.14 eV. Even though in the case of Na storage, the relatively low capability of Mo2C (132 mA h g−1) was shown to be due to the proposed competition mechanism, the findings still highlighted the Mo2C monolayer as a promising negative electrode material for L/SIBs.119 Phosphorus has received increasing attention in terms of anodes for L/SIBs with a high capacity and rate; thus, Mayo et al. presented a theoretical lithiation/sodiation process via the structure prediction by means of ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) and atomic species swapping approaches. They calculated average voltages, which show that black phosphorus (BP) can be regarded as a safe anode especially in LIBs owing to the high Li insertion voltage (1.5 V); BP also delivers a relatively low theoretical volume expansion compared with other intercalation anodes.10 Moreover, Liu and co-workers successfully fabricated tin phosphide (Sn4P3) nanoparticles with various sizes by a simple solvothermal method at a temperature of 180 °C for 10 h. The as-synthesized Sn4P3 nanoparticles have an advantageous average size of approximately 15 nm. When tested in LIBs, they display a discharge capacity of 612 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles and still retain 442 mA h g−1 after 320 cycles at 100 mA g−1 current density. In SIBs, a Sn4P3 anode displays a reversible capacity of 305 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles at 50 mA g−1. The typical charge/discharge curves for Na storage at a current density of 50 mA g−1 can be seen in Fig. 9f.120 Furthermore, Sun et al. synthesized novel cubic structured titanium hexacyanoferrate (Ti0.75Fe0.25[Fe(CN)6]0.96·1.9H2O) through a facile solution precipitation reaction method. For LIBs, it delivers an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 350 mA h g−1 with an average charge potential of 1.09 V vs. Li+/Li. The obtained titanium hexacyanoferrate also displays satisfactory cycling stability and rate capability at a voltage ranging from 0 to 3 V. Though the material has been proven to have the capability to play a dual role, it has a relatively low performance of approximately 100 mA h g−1 as an anode for SIBs. Thus, further optimization is still indispensable.121 Additionally, cobalt(II) fluoride (CoF2) was synthesized by Tan and co-workers. A specific low-potential voltage reaction process is important in enhancing storage performances. As an anode material for LIBs, CoF2 exhibits better performance corresponding to 165.7 mA h g−1 discharge capacity after 100 cycles at 0.2C when cycled at 3.2–0.01 V. In this range, the lower-potential voltage of 0.01–1.2 V corresponds to a highly reversible storage capacity of 120 mA h g−1. It also delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 402.7 mA h g−1 in SIBs at 553 mA g−1 at 3.0–0.01 V.122 In addition, Fei et al. prepared zinc 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate that served as an inexpensive and eco-friendly dual anode material. When evaluated in LIBs, the anode delivers a discharge capacity of up to 468.9 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles
at a current density of 100 mA g−1, while a second discharge capacity of 320.7 mA h g−1 was obtained in SIBs.123 Ultrathin Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanosheets were synthesized by Zhang et al. for the first time via a facile hydrothermal method, which can be applied as a conducting agent and binder-free anode for L/SIBs. A long-term cycling performance of the as-prepared Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanosheets of 120 mA h g−1 at approximately 10C was maintained after 500 cycles for SIBs, and 150 mA h g−1 at approximately 1C was retained after 500 cycles for LIBs (Fig. 9g). Specifically, the performance of Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanosheets in SIBs is superior to that of LIBs due to the existence of Na in the Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 host.6 A similar material originating from the layered compound NaTi3O6OH·2H2O, also known as “sodium nonatitanate” or NNT, has been fabricated by Seshadri and co-workers. When tested, the practical discharge capacity of the NaTi3O6OH·2H2O anode in LIBs can be over 200 mA h g−1, making it ideal for high-energy applications.124 Moreover, a representative natural humic acid polymer was utilized as a dual anode for L/SIBs by Zhu and co-workers, which helped offer a possible way to develop organic energy storage devices from natural sources.125 The performances of MnV2O6 (MnV) and its hybrid derivative compounds [{Mn(Bpy)}(VO3)2]·(H2O)1.16(MnBpy) and [{Mn(Bpy)0.5}(VO3)2]·(H2O)0.62 (MnBpy0.5) were all investigated against Na and Li counter electrodes by Fernández de Luis et al. to study their electrochemical behavior and make comparisons.126

8. Conclusions and outlook
In summary, this review mainly introduces the application of dual anode materials to L/SIBs. Such dual materials are of different types, including metal oxides, carbon-based materials, alloys, metal sulfides, and composite materials. Therefore, a variety of synthetic methods such as the solvothermal method, precipitation, and the hydrothermal approach are also discussed for the preparation of dual anode materials with different morphologies and structures. Their electrochemical properties are also carefully introduced in this review. These dual anode materials have displayed great significance for the rapid improvement of L/SIBs, largely enhancing their electronic and ionic conductivity, specific capacity and cycling stabilities. Such advantages and development trends will help battery technology meet the strong consumer market demand for portable, ultrathin/lightweight and flexible devices. However, there still exist some drawbacks in the as-obtained dual materials. For instance, some of these materials deliver excellent performance when they are tested in only LIBs or only SIBs, but the performance is not that satisfactory in regard to the other kinds of batteries. Hence, there is still a long way to go before finding more ideal dual anode materials for high-performance L/SIBs at the same time. Therefore, the following prospects are proposed for the future development of dual anodes for L/SIBs.
(1) More active materials that can facilitate fast electron transfer should be synthesized or composited with currently available anodes to achieve better performance.
(2) Different ways should be found to relieve pulverization, agglomeration and large volume changes during the Li or Na cycling process.
(3) Anodes should be synthesized with optimized structures in order to provide sufficiently large interstitial space within the crystallographic structures to host the alkali metals (Li and Na).
(4) Facile and green strategies should be designed on a large scale without expensive and toxic agents.
In addition, more future research should be carried out by analogy. For instance, it is of great significance to find dual cathode materials for L/SIBs or other types of rechargeable batteries which will make this system even more comprehensive. Making comparisons and matches between the as-obtained dual anode and cathode materials still leaves many challenges.
All in all, it is important to further optimize the above-mentioned electrode materials in order to improve the performance of LIBs, SIBs and many other kinds of rechargeable batteries. This will enable their widespread application in the near future.
