In this study, we report that an intermolecular hydrogen transfer from isopropanol to LA can be realized efficiently under photocatalytic conditions over gold-loaded TiO2 catalysts. In this manner, isopropanol is dehydrogenated as acetone and pinacol with the total selectivity of >99%, whereas LA is hydrogenated and cyclized as GVL with the selectivity of up to 85%. In this reaction process, the production of GVL is mediated with hydrogenated dehydration of LA into an acetyl propionyl radical, which is further hydrogenated and cyclized as GVL. This hydrogenation–dehydrogenation coupling process provides an atom-economical green way for the conversion of LA into GVL.
Levulinic acid (LA) is one of the most important biomass platform molecules because it can be readily obtained from lignocellulosic biomass by simple hydrolysis processes.1–3 The variety of functional groups in LA endows this molecule with versatile chemical properties. Thus, the rational conversion of LA to downstream chemical chains has drawn significant attention for future sustainable energy and chemical industries.1,2,4 For example, the selective hydrogenation of LA can generate a variety of value-added chemicals, such as γ-valerolactone (GVL), diphenolic acid, 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran, and 1,4-pentanediol.1,5,6 As a stable and liquid chemical, GVL exhibits remarkable potential to act as a green solvent, food additive and an organic intermediate in the synthesis of fine chemicals.7–9 GVL can also be used as a promising fuel additive to replace ethanol in gasoline–ethanol blends or as a precursor for diesel production.10–12
The conversion of LA into GVL has been extensively studied in recent years.1–3,13,14 This process is normally realized by direct hydrogenative cyclization under noble-metal-based thermo-catalysis conditions with a H2 molecule as the hydrogen source.1,13–21 Although H2-fed catalytic conversion is highly efficient and able to obtain high GVL yield and selectivity, it requires significant H2 consumption. Given that H2 generation relies on fossil fuels, particularly coal, H2 consumption will make the thermo-catalytic process unsustainable.22 Therefore, alternative routes should be explored for the green conversion of LA into GVL.23,24
Photocatalysis has been extensively used in diverse applications, such as water splitting, organic synthesis and polluted effluent recovery25–27 and some important progress has been achieved in chemical synthesis.28–31 Numerous studies have proven that various organic reactions can selectively operate under light irradiation with help from semiconductor or molecular photocatalysts; this finding shows the great potential of using renewable solar energy to drive chemical synthesis.28–33 We have recently found that under NaTaO3-supported photocatalysis conditions, intermolecular hydrogen transfer from isopropanol to acetone can be achieved efficiently, thus leading to selective production of pinacol.34 In this process, both the hole-induced oxidation half-reaction and electron-induced reduction half-reaction are effectively utilized, thus increasing the efficiency and atomic-economy of the total reaction. Inspired by this strategy, we attempted to convert LA to GVL by a light-driven dehydrogenation–hydrogenation coupling process without external hydrogen consumption. In this process, the hydrogen required for LA hydrogenation is directly fed from isopropanol dehydrogenation, which simultaneously produces usable acetone and pinacol selectively (eqn (1) and Scheme 1). (1)
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the TiO2-photocatalytic hydrogenation–dehydrogenation coupling reaction for LA/isopropanol. 
The experiments for the coupling of LA hydrogenative cyclization and isopropanol dehydrogenation were performed in a tubular quartz reactor (20 ml) and under an argon atmosphere, irradiated by using a high-pressure Hg-lamp (300 W) at room temperature. First, we irradiated a mixture of LA and isopropanol (1.0 mol L−1 for LA), without any catalyst. After 9 h irradiation, only a small amount (3.6%) of LA was converted (Table 1, entry 1). Product analysis showed the production of GVL but in a trace quantity (approximately 0.5% selectivity). LA dominantly behaves in a photolysis process and generates propionic acid (PA) and acetic acid (HOAc).35 Furthermore, isopropyl levulinate (IL) was also detected in small amounts. In the presence of a platinum-loaded TiO2 photocatalyst (Pt/P25-TiO2) prepared from commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25) and an in situ platinum deposition,26 LA conversion sharply increases to 54% and GVL is readily produced at a selectivity of 55% (Table 1, entry 2) with low formation of photolysis products. Considering the failed reaction under dark conditions (Table 1, entry 3), this result suggests that Pt/P25-TiO2 has a significant photocatalytic function in the hydrogenative cyclization of LA. In this case, one new product is formed from LA. As analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and related ion fragments (Fig. 1a), this new product can be well assigned to 6-hydroxy-6-methylheptane-2,5-dione (HMHD) (for assignment details see the ESI†). HMHD can be viewed as the geometric isomer of IL and is formed from a unique LA-isopropanol intermolecular dehydration process, wherein the α-H in isopropanol participates in the dehydration and leads to C–C construction (unlike in esterization reaction). This dehydration process seems to be more favorable than the esterization reaction because HMHD forms at a considerably high selectivity (Table 1, entry 2, Fig. 1b), as estimated from the peak-area analysis of gas chromatography (GC).

During the hydrogenative cyclization of LA, isopropanol is majorly dehydrogenated as acetone with a selectivity of approximately 88% (Table 1, entry 2, Fig. 1b). Isopropanol also behaves as a dehydrogenation C–C coupling process34 and produces pinacol with a selectivity of approximately 10%, following a mechanism mediated with the formation of a hydroxyl isopropyl ((CH3)2COH) radical (see the ESI†). These data indicate that intermolecular hydrogen transfer is successfully realized in the photocatalytic function of Pt/P25-TiO2. In this process, a part of the hydrogen atoms derived from isopropanol dehydrogenation is converted into molecular H2 and it competes with the hydrogenative cyclization of LA.
To investigate the effect of the photocatalyst structure on the hydrogenation–dehydrogenation coupling process, we modulated the TiO2 structure and inspected the effect of the TiO2 structure on catalyst performance. A commercial TiO2 powder (Degussa P25) was calcined at 600 °C to obtain a mixed rutile and anatase structure TiO2 (RA-TiO2), and at 800 °C to obtain a rutile phase structure TiO2 (R-TiO2) (Fig. 2a). A TiO2 nanotube (NT-TiO2) with the anatase phase was prepared by a hydrothermal process by using P25-TiO2 as the starting material.36 The TEM observations (Fig. S4†) showed that the particle size is approximately 20–30 nm for RA-TiO2 and approximately 100 nm for R-TiO2. The diameter of NT-TiO2 is approximately 8 nm and the length is approximately 150 nm. Catalysis tests showed that different phase structure catalysts exhibited different activities (Fig. 2b and Table 1, entries 4–6). Pure phase NT-TiO2 and R-TiO2 catalysts show conversion and selectivity lower than P25-TiO2, whereas the mixed structure Pt/RA-TiO2 exhibits better LA conversion (69%) and GVL selectivity (66%) than P25-TiO2 because of the facilitation of the mixed phase-resulted heterojunctions for electron and hole separation.26

Conditions: solution, 20 ml 1 M LA in isopropanol; 0.05 g catalyst loaded 0.5 wt% platinum; atmosphere, argon; temperature, 20 °C; light source, 300 W high-pressure Hg-lamp. 
A co-catalyst is necessary to promote LA hydrogenative cyclization, as witnessed by the performance of bare RA-TiO2, which exhibits low activity (Table 1, entry 9). Although platinum displays a significant catalytic activity for LA hydrogenative cyclization, it has a high work function and can greatly facilitate H2 generation from H+,26,37 which is theoretically competitive to LA hydrogenation. To suppress H2 generation, we inspected the performance of palladium and gold co-catalysts that exhibit low work functions.26,37 The results showed that such catalysts can significantly reduce H2 generation while improving LA hydrogenative cyclization (Table 1, entries 6–8, Fig. 3a). Au exhibited the highest LA conversion of 79% and GVL selectivity of 85%. The calculated rate of GVL production is 29.8 mmol GVL per gram catalyst per hour, which is comparable to the rates obtained from the previous H2-fed thermocatalysis with Cu/ZrO215 and Ru/C catalysts18,19 (see details in Table S1†). If only active metal (Au) is considered, the specific rate of GVL production is 5968.9 mmol g−1 h−1, about 5 and 120 times higher than Ru and Cu, respectively. In addition, compared to the previous thermocatalytic process that was operated at high temperature (>100 °C) and high pressure, the present photocatalytic process runs at normal pressure and temperature, which is beneficial to a system operation.
 Fig. 3  (a) H2 (hollow) and GVL (solid) generation with different co-catalysts. (b) The changes of GVL, HMHD and LA generation with the reaction rate of LA during the photocatalytic process in LA/isopropanol. Conditions: solution, 20 ml 1 M LA/ethyl levulinate in isopropanol; 0.05 g RA-TiO2 loaded 0.5 wt% co-catalyst; atmosphere, argon; temperature, 20 °C; light source, 300 W high-pressure Hg-lamp. 
On the basis of the molar quantity of H2 and GVL obtained from RA-TiO2-based catalysts, we inspected the effect of the metal co-catalyst on the efficiency (η) of hydrogen transfer from isopropanol to LA by using the following equation: η = {MGVL/(MH2 + MGVL)} × 100%. η is 46%, 52%, and 74% for Pt, Pd, and Au, respectively. The results show that gold is a more suitable co-catalyst for LA hydrogenative cyclization, benefiting from its low work function and catalytic activity for the undesired H+-to-H2 reduction. This characteristic of gold allows for suppression of the H+-to-H2 reaction and consequently encourages the interaction between H+ and LA and thus the photoexcited electron-induced hydrogenative cyclization of LA.
As described above, LA also exhibits a photolysis behavior and produces PA and HOAc, likely following a water-facilitated mechanim (see the ESI†) because the hydrogenative cyclization of LA can by-produce water stoichiometrically. This reaction is theoretically competitive to the hydrogenative cyclization of LA. On the basis of all data obtained, we observed that with the increasing LA conversion rate, GVL production steadily increases and photolysis products nearly remain a constant quantity (Fig. 3b). This result suggests that although photolysis is difficult to avoid, it can be suppressed to a relatively low level by improving the hydrogen transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the intermolecular dehydration between LA and isopropanol to produce IL and HMHD also seems to be competitive with target hydrogenative cyclization. For HMHD, its formation linearly decreases with the increasing LA conversion rate (Fig. 3b). HMHD selectivity can be greatly reduced from 40.8% for Pt/NT-TiO2 and 21.9% for Pt/RA-TiO2 to 8% for Au/RA-TiO2 (Table 1), thus suggesting that an efficient hydrogen transfer can effectively suppress HMHD formation. For IL formation, it should theoretically be favorable in the present photocatalysis environment because H+ ions that are intrinsically formed from hole-induced dehydrogenation of isopropanol32 will act as an acid catalyst for an esterization reaction. However, IL was actually detected in small quantities (approximately 2% selectivity). This situation is likely due to the subsequent hydrogenation conversion of IL. This result was verified by employing ethyl levulinate as the starting reactant to perform the photocatalytic hydrogen transfer reaction (Fig. S5†). Ethyl levulinate can be readily hydrogenated and cyclized into GVL with a selectivity of approximately 75%.
To understand the photocatalytic reaction mechanism, we monitored the radicals formed during photocatalytic processes via a radical capture technique and in situ analysis by the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum (EPR). Fig. 4a shows the EPR spectrum obtained from the Pt/RA-TiO2-catalytic dehydrogenation of isopropanol in the absence of LA by employing 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, 0.05 M) as a radical capture molecule. A simulated analysis of the spectrum by using Easyspin software38 reveals that both isopropoxy (CH3)2CHO and hydroxyl isopropyl (CH3)2COH radicals are produced as intermediates with relative contents of approximately 70% and 30%; this analysis agrees with previous EPR observations for the photocatalytic alcohol reaction over TiO2-based catalysts.39–41 Acetone formation is believed to originate from the further dehydrogenation of radicals whereas pinacol formation is caused by the C–C coupling reaction of (CH3)2COH radicals.34

EPR are obtained upon irradiation of Pt/RA-TiO2 suspensions in the presence of a spin trapping agent DMPO (DMPO = 0.05 M). 

Fig. 4b shows the EPR spectrum obtained from the LA-isopropanol hydrogen transfer reaction. This EPR spectrum is different from the spectrum for the sole isopropanol system, with a significant shift in some resonance signals, thus suggesting a change in the electron spin coupling constant and the formation of new carbon-related radical intermediates. Although the identification of the new radicals is difficult, they are assumed to originate from the LA reaction. According to the formation of HMHD in a considerable quantity, HMHD is formed via a C–C coupling reaction between a (CH3)2COH radical and an acetyl propionyl radical (following eqn (2)): (2)
Acetyl propionyl radicals can be formed by the hydrogenation dehydration of LA. On the basis of these observations and deductions, we propose that the photocatalytic hydrogenative cyclization of LA is mediated with the formation of acetyl propionyl radicals, which is further hydrogenated and cyclized as GVL, as expressed in eqn (3): (3)
This proposal can well explain the other data observed, such as the profiles of GVL and HMHD production (Fig. 3b). The GVL and HMHD formations are intrinsically competitive because both of them are derived from the same intermediate; thus, HMHD formation must be suppressed when GVL formation is promoted by a facilitated hydrogen transfer.
Conclusions
This study is the first to report that an intermolecular hydrogen transfer from isopropanol to LA can be realized efficiently under photocatalytic conditions over gold-loaded TiO2 catalysts. In this manner, isopropanol is dehydrogenated as acetone and pinacol with the total selectivity of >99%, whereas LA is hydrogenated and cyclized as GVL with the selectivity of up to 85% and the hydrogen transfer efficiency (η) up to 74%. This hydrogenation–dehydrogenation coupling process provides an atom-economical green way for the conversion of LA into GVL. Further improvement of the reaction efficiency and GVL selectivity is possible via the modification of the photocatalyst composition and structure or the development of new catalysts.
Experimental section
All chemicals were analytical-grade reagents and used without further purification. RA-TiO2 and R-TiO2 were prepared using a calcination method with commercial TiO2 powder (P25, Degussa) as a starting material. A typical calcination was carried out in a muffle furnace in air at 600 °C for 60 h (RA-TiO2) and 800 °C for 8 h (R-TiO2). TiO2 nanotube (NT-TiO2) photocatalysts were prepared by a hydrothermal process.36 Titania powder (1 g) and an aqueous solution of NaOH (10 M, 100 ml) were mixed under magnetic stirring. After stirring for 30 min, the resulting milk-like suspension was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave, maintained at 150 °C for 48 h, and then allowed to cool down to room temperature. The resulting precipitate was washed with deionized water, and ion exchanged with 0.1 mol L−1 hydrochloric acid until a pH value near 8 was reached, and then treated at 300 °C for 5 h to obtain TiO2 nanotubes (NT-TiO2). Noble metal co-catalysts were loaded onto the catalyst by in situ photodeposition.26 H2PtCl6·6H2O, PdCl2 and HAuCl4·3H2O were used as precursors.
The phase structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction on a D8 Advance power X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation. The morphology and microstructure of samples were examined using a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2010).
The EPR studies were carried out in a flat quartz cell, and the spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMXPlus-10/12 EPR spectrometer. Two samples were prepared: isopropanol solution containing 0.05 M 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and 2.5 mg ml−1 TiO2 with 0.5 wt% platinum; isopropanol solution containing 1 M LA, 0.05 M DMPO and 2.5 mg ml−1 TiO2 with 0.5 wt% platinum. The samples were firstly sonicated for 5 min in an ultrasonic bath, and then were carefully deoxygenated by a stream of argon, subsequently filled in the quartz flat cell. During the EPR photochemical experiments the samples were irradiated at 298 K directly in the EPR resonator, and the EPR spectra were recorded in situ during a continuous photoexcitation. The operating conditions were as follows: microwave frequency ν = 9.86 GHz, power of microwave W = 10.02 mW, and scanning range 3416–3616 G. The irradiation of the sample in the EPR cavity was carried out using a 100 W UV lamp. The g-values (±0.0001) were determined using a built-in magnetometer. The EPR spectra so obtained were analyzed and simulated using the Easyspin software.38
In a general photocatalytic synthetic procedure, LA (20 mmol) was dissolved in 20 ml isopropanol and 0.05 g TiO2 catalyst was added (loading 0.5 wt% noble metal). All reactions were performed in a tubular quartz photoreactor with pure Ar continuously bubbling. A 300 W high-pressure Hg lamp was used as the light source and was cooled by 20 °C water circulation. Liquid products were analyzed by using a gas-chromatograph (GC-950 equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and Rtx-Wax column from Restek) and a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 with a mass spectrometer and DB-5 ms column from Alltech). The sample analysis was confirmed by comparing the mass spectrum and retention time of pure products. A GC-9790 (equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID)) was used to detect CH4, CO, CO2 and H2.
