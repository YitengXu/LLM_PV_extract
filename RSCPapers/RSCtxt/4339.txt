    , Accepted 15th July 2016First published on 20th July 2016AbstractAs one of the promising photovoltaic technologies, high performance metal-free dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been explored due to the fact that they can be potentially produced using low-cost materials, their color can be tuned and they exhibit reasonable stability. Here three new organic donor–acceptor–π–acceptor (D–A–π–A) sensitizers (B-87, Q-85 and Q-93), containing benzothiadiazole and two new modified pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazines as the auxiliary acceptor, have been synthesized and employed in DSSCs. Among the three dyes, B-87 and Q-85 showed good photovoltaic performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 10.2% and 10.0%, respectively, which contribute to the few examples of DSSCs synthesized using pure organic dyes with an iodine electrolyte to exceed the 10% efficiency barrier. It is noteworthy that an initial PCE of 7.16% has been achieved for B-87 based DSSCs with an ionic liquid electrolyte, which retained 95% of the initial efficiency after continuous light soaking for 1000 h at 60 °C, thus demonstrating outstanding stability. The molecular design strategy provides an effective approach to modulate the energy of the absorption bands as well as modify the optoelectronic and physical properties of the organic sensitizers to achieve highly efficient and stable sensitizers.
Introduction
As one of the promising photovoltaic technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention over the past 20 years.1 A number of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) devices based on metal complex dyes have been reported such as ruthenium2 or porphyrin3 complexes, reaching the highest PCE of 11–13%. However, ruthenium and porphyrin dyes suffer from either resource scarcity and heavy metal toxicity or formidable synthesis. Therefore, research activity has been increased in finding metal-free sensitizers with advantages across many aspects, such as facile synthesis approaches, high molar extinction coefficient within the visible region and tunable spectral properties.4 Generally, most traditional organic sensitizers are synthesized with the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration, making use of the efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process to harvest sunlight for photon-to-electron conversion.5 From the viewpoint of stability and efficiency, Zhu et al. proposed a new concept of a D–A–π–A motif by incorporating an additional group of electron-withdrawing conjugated components in 2011.6 Based on this strategy, a series of D–A–π–A organic dyes incorporating internal electron-withdrawing units such as diketo-pyrrolo-pyrrole,7 bithiazole,8 isoindigo,9 benzothiadiazole,6,10 benzotriazole,11 and quinoxaline12 into the traditional D–π–A structures were reported to modulate the energy levels, extend the spectral response and improve stability.
As noted above, the design of DSSC molecular dyes requires careful consideration of multiple opto-electronic properties, such as band alignment and optical absorption coefficient, as well as solid-state properties such as dye aggregation, morphology, and mode of assembly on the TiO2 photoanode. Zhu and co-workers performed extensive studies on 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD)-based sensitizers with this D–A–π–A motif, and the PCE of the DSSCs has been improved from 8.7% (WS-2)6 to 9.0% (WS-9),10 then to 10.08% (WS-51)13 by incorporating different π-bridges to decrease intermolecular interactions and retard charge recombination. Inspired by their previous work, we substituted cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) with 4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTS) which is found to work very effectively in reducing dye aggregation as well as preventing charge recombination due to the presence of two out of plane 2-ethylhexyl moieties.14
Pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (PP), an effective electron-withdrawing unit because of its two symmetric unsaturated nitrogen atoms and the pyridine N-atoms, has already been widely used and showed promising photovoltaic properties in photoelectric materials. However, its application as an auxiliary acceptor in DSSCs was seldom reported.15 Hence, we introduced two more new modified PP-based acceptors other than the BTD-based core as auxiliary acceptors to modulate the energy gap, expecting to broaden the spectral response. In addition, alkoxyl and alkyl chains were further introduced into the PP-based unit to suppress the dye aggregation and improve the solubility. As a result, three DTS-bridged D–A–π–A sensitizers with an alteration in the auxiliary acceptors were rationally designed and exhibited excellent photovoltaic performances, with PCEs as high as 10.20% (B-87), 10.01% (Q-85) and 8.43% (Q-93), respectively. In this work, it will be seen that the change of auxiliary acceptors provides a useful strategy to modify the optoelectronic, chemical and physical properties of these organic sensitizers, thus generating high performance DSSCs.
Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
A coplanar and conjugated π-bridge unit DTS was inserted between the auxiliary acceptor and cyanoacrylic acid to facilitate charge transfer upon excitation from the ground to excited state and increase light absorption. Moreover, attaching two branched out of plane 2-ethylhexyl chains onto DTS appears to attenuate the interfacial recombination, for achieving better performance in devices. To further shift the absorption band to lower energy and enhance the ICT process, two modified PP-based cores with stronger electron-withdrawing ability were introduced into Q-85 and Q-93, respectively (Fig. 1). With a more conjugated and electron withdrawing core, Q-93 is expected to broaden and shift the absorption spectra to a lower energy relative to Q-85.

The synthesis routes to B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 are depicted in Scheme 1. The intermediate compounds 3b–3c were obtained according to the literature.16 Two sequential Suzuki coupling reactions with acceptors 3a–3b, respectively, resulted in the corresponding aldehyde precursors 7b–7c taking advantage of an in situ aldehyde deprotection.14b After deprotection of the aldehyde precursors, Knoevenagel condensation of compounds 8b–8c with cyano acetic acid was conducted to give the target dyes B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 in 56%, 70% and 78% yields, respectively. Their structures were characterized by NMR, MS spectroscopies and EA (Fig. S5–S13, ESI†).

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 in CH2Cl2 solution and on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. All of the three compounds exhibit three major electronic absorption bands: (i) electron transitions in the UV region (around 300–350 nm), (ii) the ICT band in the visible region (around 560 nm for B-87 and Q-85, 590 nm for Q-93), (iii) an additional absorption band or shoulder from subordinate orbital transition (near 500 nm). Compared with the reported WS-51 (λmax = 551 nm),13 the absorption maximum of B-87 (λmax = 562 nm) is 11 nm red-shifted along with a slight enhancement of the molar extinction coefficient (ε) from 43000 to 47400 M−1 cm−1. Interestingly, the two PP-based dyes, Q-85 and B-87 have similar band shapes with B-87 showing an identical λmax and enhancement of ε to 50600 M−1 cm−1 for the latter compound. However, with a more coplanar and conjugated acceptor, λmax of Q-93 (593 nm, ε = 34600 M−1 cm−1) is noticeably bathochromic-shifted by 31 nm compared to B-87 and Q-85, which is related to the stronger electron withdrawing capability of the auxiliary acceptor. The tendency is consistent with the calculated optical gap and oscillator strength. As expected, the dye deprotonation and aggregation on TiO2 film result in a shift and broadening of the absorption spectra that the maximum absorption peaks for B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 are blue-shifted to 543 nm, 543 nm and 586 nm, respectively.13

Electrochemical data and DTF simulation
To investigate the feasibility of electron injection from excited dyes into the conduction band of TiO2 and dye regeneration by a redox electrolyte, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in CH2Cl2 solution with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal reference and 0.1 M tetra-n-butyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate as a supporting electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 3, the positions of ES+/S for B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 are located similarly at +0.94, +0.98 and +0.97 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively, which are estimated from the first oxidation potentials. These values suggest that all of the three sensitizers can provide ample driving force (almost 600 mV) for ground state regeneration of sensitizers, in consideration of the I−/I3− redox electrolyte (0.35 V vs. NHE).17 The energy difference between the dye's excited state oxidation potential (ES+/S*) and the conduction band edge (Ecb) of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE)18 drives the electron injection from the photoexcited sensitizer to TiO2. The driving force values estimated by subtracting E0–0 from ES+/S, ES+/S* of dyes B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 are −1.06, −0.96 and −0.82 V vs. NHE, respectively, indicating sufficient thermodynamic force for electron injection.

In order to compare these experimental values and to gain further insight into the structural properties, the frontier orbitals of the three compounds were calculated (see the ESI† for details). The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) with their corresponding energies (EHOMO and ELUMO) and the HOMO–LUMO gaps (ΔE) are depicted in Table 2. It can be seen from Table S1† that the HOMO electrons in the three dyes are delocalized throughout the framework while the LUMOs are primarily distributed on the acceptor–DTS–anchor unit. This indicates that the configurations of the three dyes are highly conjugated with excellent electron transfer channels for electron injection. Meanwhile, such a good overlap between the HOMO–LUMO orbital can facilitate electron migration from the donor to the anchor unit, then to the conduction band of the semiconductor TiO2. In addition, the HOMOs of the three dyes are almost the same, while the LUMOs follow the trend Q-93 (−2.85 eV) > Q-85 (−2.93 eV) > B-87 (−3.11 eV). The results are in good agreement with the experimental data, suggesting the corresponding electron withdrawing ability of the auxiliary acceptors, that is, Q-93 > Q-85 > B-87. Apart from that, the dihedral angle between the auxiliary acceptor and the π-bridge follows the order Q-93 (20.4°) > Q-85 (17.4°) > B-87 (−5.6°), as shown in Table S2.† The large dihedral angle may lead to the problem of electron transfer from the electron-rich donor to the auxiliary acceptor, illustrating that Q-85 gives a similar absorption spectra to B-87 even with a lower LUMO in CH2Cl2 solution. Furthermore, the larger twist in Q-93 on both sides of the auxiliary acceptor significantly decreases the oscillator strength of the lowest energy transition band, which corresponds to the relatively small extinction coefficient of the lowest energy band of Q-93 from the experimental results. In contrast, the second lowest energy band, which is dominated by the HOMO → LUMO+1 transition, has a much larger oscillator strength compared with the other two compounds, which can be attributed to the more planar geometry of the auxiliary acceptor in Q-93.

Photovoltaic performance
The DSSC performances of all the dyes were tested under AM 1.5 G irradiation (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2). Different layers of commercial colloidal paste were utilized to optimize the TiO2 photoelectrode as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S3.† With a 12 μm thick commercial colloidal paste layer and 4 μm scattering layer TiO2 film, devices with all the three dyes showed excellent PCE. The photocurrent density voltage curves (J–V) and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimized DSSCs based on dyes B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 are shown in Fig. 4. The detailed data of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are collected in Table 3. We now turn to the influence of altering the auxiliary acceptor core on the DSSC characteristics. As we can see, both the Jsc and Voc of the devices with B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 dyes decrease in the trend B-87 > Q-85 > Q-93, and the PCEs of devices decrease in the order B-87 > Q-85 > Q-93. The best PCE of 10.02% was obtained with B-87 based on the BTD core, possessing a typical Jsc of 20.28 mA cm−2, a Voc of 724 mV, and a fill factor of 68.26%. It is well known that the quantum conversion yield in the response region and the spectrum coverage range determine the generation of photocurrent density. In this respect, we checked the IPCE spectra to investigate the contribution of absorption at different wavelengths to the Jsc, as shown in Fig. 4B. It can be clearly seen that the IPCE responses are in the range of 300–805 nm for B-87, 300–750 nm for Q-85 and 300–825 nm for Q-93, respectively. The onset wavelengths of photocurrent response from 300 to 350 nm are almost identical for the three dyes due to the same indoline donor. Interestingly, even though B-87 and Q-85 have almost the same absorption spectra in solution, B-87 exhibited a more pronounced plateau in the IPCE response than Q-85, above 80% in the entire visible region of about 400–650 nm, presenting a higher current density of 20.28 mA cm−2. Unsatisfactorily, the IPCE response for Q-93 is the broadest but with the worst IPCE value that the plateau is no more than 75% from 400 to 700 nm, which is consistent with its having a lower molar extinction coefficient than Q-85, resulting in a relatively low Jsc (19.53 mA cm−2).

As for Voc, since the difference of the auxiliary acceptors in B-87 and Q-85 has little impact, its values are found to be 724 mV and 722 mV, respectively. Notably, there is a significant decline for Q-93 (Voc = 676 mV), with a more conjugated and coplanar electron-withdrawing core, compared with the other two dyes. Generally, a device's Voc is influenced by the conduction band (Ecb) position and the recombination of electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.20 To identify the position of the TiO2 conduction band, we fitted the cell chemical capacitance (Cμ) responses under a series of bias potentials, determined from the typical electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).21 In these DSSCs with the three dyes, the logarithm of Cμ has an almost identical slope at the given bias potential (Fig. 5A). We can see that the Ecb of B-87 and Q-85 are similar, which are slightly higher than that of the Q-93 device. This can be ascribed to the lower dipole moment of Q-93, shown in Table S2.† A dipole moment pointing away from the TiO2 surface will cause an increase in the energy splitting between the quasi-Fermi level for electrons in TiO2 and that for holes in the redox couple, which results in a larger Voc.22
 Fig. 5  Plots of cell capacitance Cμ (A), interface charge transfer resistance Rct (B), calculated electron lifetime τn (C) and dark current (D) under a series of bias potentials of DSSCs based on sensitizers B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 (dye bath solvent: CHCl3:C2H5OH, v/v = 6:4, dipping time: 12 h). 
In addition, we can see clearly that B-87-based DSSCs exhibited a slight increase of the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) under a series of bias potentials in comparison to Q-85, whereas, there was an obvious increase compared with Q-93, which can be attributed to the low charge recombination of Q-93-DSSCs. The data suggest that a relatively subtle structural difference on the central electron-deficient unit among the three dyes can result in a significant difference in the rate of charge recombination (B-87 > Q-85 > Q-93), which may be attributed to the aggregation and electron-withdrawing ability. The stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the PP-based core could increase the probability of electron recombination from TiO2 to oxidized dyes thus leading to a lower Voc value for the PP-based DSSCs.
The electron lifetime (τn = Cchem × Rct) versus chemical capacitance is also plotted for all the devices to further compare the differences in the electron recombination processes (shown in Fig. 5C).21a,23 A longer electron lifetime in titania films should lead to a higher electron density and thus higher pseudo-Fermi level, which might result in higher Voc. The electron lifetime of the B-87 device is the longest under a certain bias potential, followed in descending order by Q-85 and Q-93 devices. The results further illustrate that B-87 with a BTD core displays better performance in retarding the electron recombination process than the PP core of Q-85 and Q-93. Moreover, the dark currents under different bias potentials in DSSCs based on B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 are presented in Fig. 5D. The lower dark current in DSSCs based on B-87 suggests less charge recombination between the TiO2 surface and electrolyte, and less loss of current in the device,24 which can partly explain the higher Jsc and Voc of the DSSC based on B-87 than Q-85 and Q-93.
Inspired by previous work, utilization of a coadsorbent is an effective approach for suppressing dye aggregation, thus enhancing Voc. Given the relatively low Voc values of the three dyes, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a commonly used coadsorbent due to its nonplanar and bulky configuration, was used for the consequent optimization. Initially, DSSCs were fabricated by dipping the TiO2 films into the dye solutions containing specific concentrations of CDCA. The optimized process and data of CDCA concentration are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S4.† The result showed that a concentration of 6 mM CDCA is the best condition for the B-87-based DSSCs. The J–V curves of DSSCs coadsorbing with 6 mM CDCA are given in Fig. 6A and the corresponding photoelectric results are tabulated in Table 4. Unexpectedly, the PCE for the B-87-based DSSC improved from 10.02% to 10.20%, however, an undesirable decrease was observed in the PP-based dyes Q-85 and Q-93 from 9.41% and 8.17% to 7.31% and 7.35%, respectively. The 20.78 mA cm−2 achieved for B-87 coadsorbed with CDCA is slightly higher than the previous 20.28 mA cm−2, which can account for the improvement of PCE with Voc remaining the same. As shown in Fig. 6C, a narrower but higher IPCE response of B-87 devices with CDCA suggests that the aggregation was indeed repressed, thus resulting in more efficient charge transport and collection, which could explain the increase of Jsc.25 In contrast with B-87, it is odd to see the synchronous decline in both Jsc and Voc for Q-85 and Q-93-based DSSCs. During the optimization procedure, it was observed that the TiO2 films soaked in the PP-based dye bath (3 × 10−4 M), Q-85 and Q-93, with 6 mM CDCA for 12 h were less intensely colored than those prepared with pure dyes, as shown in Fig. 7. This phenomenon is not seen for B-87-based dyes, suggesting that competitive adsorption between PP-based dyes and CDCA is more predominate than BT-based dyes. To probe our hypothesis, the extent of dye adsorption for the corresponding DSSC devices was measured by the desorption method and the data are summarized in Table 4. The results confirm that the dye-loading amounts of PP-based dyes were reduced significantly, wherein that of Q-85 decreased from 1.21 × 10−7 to 5.83 × 10−8 mol cm−2 and that of Q-93 decreased from 1.20 × 10−7 to 8.50 × 10−8 mol cm−2, upon coadsorption with CDCA, whereas the dye-loading amount of B-87 did not change significantly, showing a slight decline from 1.32 × 10−7 to 1.13 × 10−7 mol cm−2. One plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the N atom of the pyridine ring in the PP unit could decrease the pKa value of CDCA, thus increasing the bonding ability of CDCA with TiO2, however further experimentation would need to be performed to confirm this.

 Fig. 7  The pictures of B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 adsorbed on TiO2 films under different conditions before fabrication into DSSCs. CDCAa means dipping in a solution (CHCl3:C2H5OH, v/v = 6:4) with dyes (3 × 10−4 M) and CDCA (6 × 10−3 M) for 12 h. CDCAb means dipping in CDCA ethanol solution for 30 min first, then dipping in dye baths with a concentration of 3 × 10−4 M (CHCl3:C2H5OH, v/v = 6:4) for 12 h. 
Considering the detrimental result of simultaneous coadsorption of Q-85 and Q-93 along with CDCA, an alternative coadsorption method was performed to lessen the competitive effect of CDCA. Herein, we dipped the TiO2 films into 6 mM CDCA solution in ethanol for 30 min, then in dye solution for 12 h after washing and drying. As a result, even though there was no enhancement of PCE for the B-87-based DSSC, the PCE for Q-85 and Q-93-based DSSCs strikingly improved from 9.41% and 8.14% to 10.01% and 8.43%, respectively (Fig. 6B and Table 4). As anticipated, the Voc of Q-85 and Q-93-based DSSCs was significantly enhanced, which might be attributed to suppression of aggregation of the dyes. The decreased Jsc of the devices may be related to the decreased coverage of dyes, leading to a loss in the light harvesting process. The downward IPCE curves shown in Fig. 6D and E could also account for the decrease of Jsc, compared with pure dyes.
To further study the impact of the coadsorbing CDCA on Voc, EIS analysis was also performed. Fig. 8 depicts the Cμ and Rct of B-87, Q-85 and Q-93 with and without CDCA under a series of bias potentials. We can see that no relative shifts of the conduction band in TiO2 were observed in the presence of CDCA on account of the similar Cμ values with pure dyes. In other words, the values of Voc are directly correlated with the electron density in TiO2. Compared with pure dye-based DSSCs, Rct values of the coadsorbing DSSCs are larger than those of pure dyes at a fixed potential, suggesting the inhibition of the interfacial electron recombination process.26 (Fig. 8), which suggests less charge recombination in the presence of CDCA. As a consequence, the combined effect gives larger τCDCA than pure dyes, illustrating the relatively higher Voc.

Stability measurements
In addition to high PCE, long-term stability is a vital requirement for the practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells. Compared with a liquid electrolyte, solvent-free ionic liquid electrolytes in DSSCs have shown excellent long-term device stability. Possessing the highest PCE of DSSCs based on the three dyes, B-87 was chosen to optimize the DSSC performance with an ionic liquid electrolyte which contains 1,3-dimethylimidazoliumiodide/1-ethyl-3 methylimidazoliumiodide/1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetracyanoborate/iodine/N-butylbenzoimidazole/guanidinium thiocyanate (molar ratio 12/12/16/1.67/3.33/0.67). Photoelectrodes with different thicknesses were fabricated by repeating the screen printing process with different layers of commercial colloidal paste. The J–V curves of the corresponding DSSCs under standard AM 1.5 G full sunlight conditions are given in Fig. S4† and their photoelectric results are summarized in Table 5. With an 8 μm thick commercial colloidal paste layer and 4 μm scattering layer TiO2 film, devices with B-87 showed the best PCE of 7.16% with Jsc of 16.59 mA cm−2, Voc of 699 mV and FF of 69%. The decreased Jsc of the device with a thicker TiO2 layer (12 + 4) could be ascribed to the poor contact between the dyes and ionic liquid electrolyte and lower diffusion rate, which can affect dye regeneration. The devices were subjected to long-term stability tests under the irradiance of AM 1.5 G full sun visible light soaking at 60 °C. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of devices during the aging process are presented in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the PCE of the DSSCs increases significantly in the beginning, which is related to the improved penetration of the ionic liquid electrolyte through the complete thickness of the electrode and the ‘‘activation’’ of the entire electrode.27 After that a stabilization of the performances was observed and the PCE of the devices remained at 95% of the initial value under both thermal and light-soaking stress for over 1000 h, showing outstanding stability.

Conclusions
In summary, three DTS-bridged D–A–π–A sensitizers with a variation in auxiliary acceptors were synthesized and each exhibited excellent photovoltaic performances, with PCE as high as 10.0% (B-87), 9.4% (Q-85) and 8.2% (Q-93), respectively, in the standard I3−/I− liquid electrolyte. The relationship between the molecular structure and the photovoltaic performance of the dye cells was examined using J–V scan, IPCE and EIS. The substitution of the CPDT bridge with DTS in B-87 results in a red-shift of the absorption spectra and enhanced molar extinction coefficient compared with the reported W-51. Compared with B-87 and Q-85, Q-93 with a broader absorption band showed unsatisfactory PCE owing to a lower IPCE and shorter electron lifetime. After coadsorption with CDCA by two different methods, the photovoltaic performances of the three dyes improved obviously, achieving PCE of 10.20% (B-87), 10.01% (Q-85) and 8.43% (Q-93), respectively. Furthermore, the stability of B-87 based DSSCs with an ionic liquid electrolyte was evaluated. After optimization of the photoelectrode, a PCE of up to 7.16% has been achieved for B-87 based DSSCs with ionic-liquid electrolytes, which retained 95% of the initial performances after continuous light soaking for 1000 h at 60 °C. This work demonstrates the potential application of B-87 dyes as a promising candidate for highly efficient and stable DSSC devices.

Fabrication of DSSCs
The photoelectrode was fabricated by repeating the screen printing process with a commercial colloidal paste (Dyesol 18NR-T) layer (12 μm) and scattering layer (4 μm), respectively. Afterwards, the TiO2 films were heated gradually under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. Prior to dye adsorption, the TiO2 films were post-treated using 0.04 M TiCl4 solution to increase the surface area and improve the connectivity of the nanoparticles. Subsequently, the photoanodes were sintered once again and cooled to room temperature. Then they were immersed in a binary solvent system (CHCl3:C2H5OH = 6:4) with sensitizers (3 × 10−4 M), respectively. For the counter electrode, H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol solution presented a uniform distribution on FTO glass by the spin coating method, and the cathode was heated at 400 °C for deposition of platinum. Eventually, the two electrodes were sealed with thermoplastic Surlyn, and an electrolyte solution was injected through one hole in the counter electrode to complete the sandwich-type solar cells. The electrolyte is composed of 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.05 M lithium iodide in acetonitrile:valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). The active area of all DSSCs is 0.12 cm2.
Photovoltaic property measurements
The current–voltage photovoltaic characterization was performed using the setup consisting of a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel), a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (PräzisionsGlas & Optik GmbH), and a Keithley 2400 source meter which applies potential bias and measures the photogenerated current. Monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained via the setup using a SR830 lock-in amplifier, a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology) and a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin-Yvon Ltd). A Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany) was employed to carry out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The frequency range was 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and the applied bias was from −0.5 V to −0.80 V or from −0.55 V to −0.80 V with about 50 mV progressive increase under dark conditions. The magnitude of the alternating signal was 5 mV, and the spectra were characterized with Z-View software. Dye-loading measurements were conducted by immersing dye-coated TiO2 films in 0.1 M NaOH THF/H2O (v/v = 1/1) solution for 2 h to perform the dye desorption. The absorption spectra of desorbed dye solutions were measured and total dye-loading was determined from a plot of standard samples.
