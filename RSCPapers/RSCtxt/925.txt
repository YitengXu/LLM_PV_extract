    , Accepted 31st January 2019First published on 14th February 2019AbstractSolar thermochemical CO2/H2O splitting cycles based on redox oxides have emerged as a potential strategy to store dilute and intermittent solar energy. It is desirable to explore other materials that can convert solar energy into chemical energy with high efficiency. Herein, a thermochemical water splitting (TCWS) cycle based on Sr- and Co-doped LaGaO3−δ (La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ) was successfully developed. Compared with inert LaGaO3−δ, the oxygen vacancy concentration (δ) is gradually increased as the contents of Sr- and/or Co-dopants increased. The δ value of LaGa0.4Co0.6O3−δ (LGC60) reaches 0.16 after reduction for 40 min at 1350 °C, which is 5 and 4 times that of Ce0.85Zr0.15O2−δ and LSMA6464, respectively. The H2 yield of LGC60 (478 μmol H2 g−1perovskite) is 15 times that of the current state-of-the-art material, CeO2−δ (32 μmol H2 g−1material), when reduced at 1350 °C and re-oxidized at optimized 800 or 1000 °C. 1.0 atom% IrOx as a catalyst doped into the structure of LGC50, named LGC50-Ir(1.0), can increase the H2 release rate by 1.3-fold. XPS results reveal that the H2O splitting reaction is driven by the Co2+/Co3+ redox pair. DFT calculations predict that the oxygen vacancy formation energies (EV) of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3 span from nearly 0.7 to about 5.3 eV under vacuum conditions at 1623 K, depending on the contents of Sr- and Co-dopants. Thus, doping Co at the B-site is responsible for the introduction of redox activity, and adjusting Sr- and Co-contents is effective in tuning the δ and EV values of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ. It should be pointed out that, at present, the steam to hydrogen conversion ratios for LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ under the used evaluation conditions are still very low (<1%) and far away from the practical demand, which is a common tradeoff in this field, and more attention should be paid in future material screening work. This discovery provides a useful strategy to design perovskite oxides with enhanced TCWS activity and it will promote the development of solar thermochemical fuel conversion science.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen is an attractive clean fuel, which is widely used in the chemical industry and fuel cells.1,2 Among several solar energy powered hydrogen production routes (e.g., photo-catalysis, photo-electro-catalysis, and thermochemical water splitting (TCWS)), TCWS based on redox oxides has emerged as a potential strategy to store dilute and intermittent solar energy in the form of chemical energy due to its simplicity and operational convenience.3–9 A two-step thermochemical CO2/H2O splitting system works via a redox cycle (Scheme 1). The first step is a solar-driven endothermic reduction of the metal oxide (MOox), yielding a lower-valence metal oxide (MOred) and molecular oxygen. In the second exothermal step, the lower-valence metal oxide (MOred) is re-oxidized by CO2/H2O (yielding CO/H2) and recovered to its initial state. The net reaction of the whole redox cycle is the overall CO2/H2O splitting.
 Scheme 1  Schematic of the two-step thermochemical CO2/H2O splitting cycle. 
Various types of redox materials have been extensively evaluated for their potential application in thermochemical CO2/H2O splitting. These redox materials can be divided into two main categories: stoichiometric oxides (such as ZnO/Zn, Fe3O4/FeO, SnO2/SnO and ferrites)10–13 and non-stoichiometric oxides (such as CeO2−δ and ABO3−δ perovskites)3,7,14–22 involving gas–solid reactions. Stoichiometric oxides have larger oxygen storage capacity (OSC) than most non-stoichiometric oxides, while it is usually accompanied by other disadvantages, for example, the problem of volatility in the ZnO/Zn cycle and intensive sintering for the Fe3O4/FeO cycle. In contrast, non-stoichiometric oxides can maintain their initial structure within a certain range of oxygen non-stoichiometry (e.g. CeO2−δ and ABO3−δ) and usually show much faster reaction kinetics and better cycling stability. CeO2−δ and foreign element substituted ceria (such as Ce1−xZrxO2−δ), with a reduction temperature below 1400 °C, are typical non-stoichiometric redox materials that have been intensively investigated by many scientists.3,5,14,15,23,24 Although ceria based materials are characterized by their rapid reaction kinetics and high temperature tolerance, their OSC and fuel productions are too small to be accepted.
Sr- and Mn-doped LaAlO3−δ was successfully used in two-step thermochemical CO2 and H2O splitting reactions; the CO yields were 6× greater and the H2 yields were 9× greater than those produced by ceria, when it was reduced at 1350 °C and re-oxidized at 1000 °C.7 These amazing results encourage researchers to uncover the detailed redox mechanism for Mn-perovskite oxide based CO2/H2O splitting and develop more other ABO3−δ perovskite based redox systems. Afterwards, a lot of Mn-based perovskite oxides, such as La1−xCaxMn1−yAlyO3−δ,17,25,26 La1−xCaxMn1−yAlyO3,25,27,28 and La1−xSrxMn1−yByO3−δ (B = Al, Mg, Ga, and Sc),16,18,29,30 were intensively studied for their application in thermochemical CO2/H2O splitting. As reported in the literature, the valence state variation of Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+ within the ABO3−δ structure provides the basic redox activity for the thermochemical CO2/H2O splitting cycle.7,30 As for La1−xSrxMnO3−δ, the addition of Sr content is beneficial to increase H2 production, which comes at the price of decreased H2 release rate and reduced steam-to-hydrogen conversion ratio.17 Doping with alkaline earth metals (such as Ca and Sr) brings the possibility to form carbonates when splitting CO2. This problem can be minimized by doping with Al element and/or conducting the re-oxidation reaction (CO2 splitting) at above 900 °C.31 Recently, M. Ezbiri et al. found that Al-doping leads to enrichment of Mn cations and depletion of Sr cations at the surface of La1−xSrxMn1−yAlyO3−δ, which is essential to enhance its reduction extent and decrease the formation of carbonates.30 Other non-stoichiometric perovskite oxides, such as La0.6Sr0.4Cr1−xCoxO3−δ,19 (La,Ba)xA1−xFeyB1−yO3−δ (ref. 20) and double perovskite-type Ba2Ca0.66Nb1.34−xFexO6−δ (ref. 32) have also been reported as promising thermochemical redox materials. DFT calculation results revealed that the oxygen vacancy formation energy (EV) in La1−xSrxMnyAl1−yO3−δ perovskite oxide was tunable via adjusting the A- or B-site doping level, and the range of EV particularly suited for solar thermochemical (STC) cycles was identified to be 1.8 < EV < 2.4 eV.33 A. A. Emery also performed a high-throughput density functional theory (HT-DFT) study to screen potential perovskite oxides for thermochemical CO2/H2O splitting applications.34 It was discovered that the EV of ABO3−δ perovskite oxides is tunable via the doping of A- or B-site compositions, which is promising to develop new materials. Unlike CeO2−δ-based oxides, ABO3−δ type perovskite oxides have larger OSC, which leads to higher fuel production in the subsequent CO2/H2O splitting reaction. Besides, ABO3−δ perovskites provide the possibility to substitute their A- and/or B-site compositions by almost all elements in the periodic table and further tailor their redox properties. There is no doubt that ABO3−δ perovskites are promising materials for solar thermochemical CO2/H2O splitting applications. It is desirable to discover other perovskite oxides with moderate to good TCWS performance. This will promote the development of solar thermochemical CO2/H2O conversion science and provide new insights into the design of redox materials.
Herein, A- and/or B-site substituted La1−xAxGa1−yByO3−δ (A = Sr and B = Co) perovskite oxides were applied to two-step thermochemical water splitting (TCWS). Iridium as a catalyst was used to enhance the H2O splitting kinetics of LGC50 based two-step TCWS. Un-doped LaGaO3−δ was found to be inactive for TCWS. Doping Co2+/Co3+ at the B-site of LaGa1−xCoxO3−δ makes it redox active. The O2/H2 release capacities are increased as the cobalt content increased. 1.0 atom% IrOx as a catalyst doped into the structure of LGC50, named LGC50-Ir(1.0), can increase the H2 release rate by 1.3-fold. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (EV) is tuned by doping Co at the B-site and Sr at the A-site, which influences the tolerance for oxygen non-stoichiometry and thermodynamic driving force for La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ based TCWS. When TCWS was performed between 1350 and 800 °C, LGC60 demonstrated a stable production of ∼313 μmol O2 g−1perovskite and ∼478 μmol H2 g−1perovskite during the repeated H2O splitting tests.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Sample preparation
The La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ (x = 0–0.5 and y = 0–1.0) perovskite oxides and noble iridium catalyst containing LaGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ samples, named y atom% IrOx:LaGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (y = 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5), were prepared by a modified glycine nitrate auto combustion method.35 In a typical preparation procedure, stoichiometric amounts of raw materials of La(NO3)3·6H2O (purity ≥ 99.0%), Sr(NO3)2 (purity ≥ 99.5%), Ga(NO3)3·9H2O (purity ≥ 99.0%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (purity ≥ 99.0%), and C2H5NO2 (purity ≥ 99.5%) were dissolved in a minimum volume of water (eqn (1)). The salt solution was evaporated to a sol–gel state before it was transferred to a furnace kept at 500 °C. Then, the sample was calcined at 800 °C for 4 h. The preparation of noble iridium catalyst containing samples followed a similar procedure. In order to simplify writing, the perovskite oxides are represented by abbreviations in some cases. For example, the LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ samples are abbreviated as LGC##, where ## represents the mole percentage of Co, e.g., LGC10 represents LaGa0.9Co0.1O3−δ. The summary of abbreviations of different perovskite oxides is given in Table S1.† (1)
2.2 Characterization of samples
The synthesized perovskite oxides and used samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/Max-2500/PC powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with an operating voltage of 40 kV and an operating current of 200 mA. The XRD patterns were recorded in the range of 5–80° with a step size of 0.02° and a scan rate of 5° min−1. The specific surface areas of the samples were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 adsorption analyzer. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Quanta 200FEG scanning electron microscope. The high resolution SEM (HR-SEM) images and EDX mappings were obtained using a Hitachi high-technology S-5500 with an operating voltage of 30 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Esclab 250Xi, a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source) was used to determine the Ga 2p and Co 2p electron binding energies and the valence states of gallium and cobalt elements, and all data were normalized to the C 1s peak (284.6 eV) for each sample. 325 nm and 532 nm Raman spectra were used to identify the short range structure changes and to obtain surface information.
2.3 H2O splitting test
The H2O splitting activity test was carried out in a temperature programmed vertical alumina (Φ = 20 mm) fixed bed reactor equipped with an internal alumina crucible. The vertical alumina tubular reactor was placed inside an electric furnace. In a general experimental process, 0.5 g of perovskite oxides was used for the H2O splitting test. High purity Ar (99.999%, 100 sccm) sweep gas was used to maintain an inert atmosphere and remove gaseous products. In the reduction step, the reactive material was heated from room temperature to 1100 °C with a ramp rate of 20 °C min−1, then further heated to 1350 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 and maintained at 1350 °C for 40 min. After the O2 was released completely, the reactor was cooled to a lower temperature (a certain value between 500 and 1100 °C) with a rate of 20 °C min−1. In the subsequent re-oxidation step, the reactor was maintained at a lower temperature (a certain value between 500 and 1100 °C); liquid H2O was introduced into the reactor with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 through a HPLC pump (Laballiance-Series III, Scientific Systems, Inc.) and it was evaporated simultaneously by a preheated (220 °C) pipeline. The above mentioned reduction and re-oxidation procedures were used for all H2O splitting tests; otherwise, it would be specially stated. Generally, small air leaks are inevitable in an atmospheric pressure (1 atm) reactor and the residual oxygen pressure in our experiment is ca. 5.0 × 10−6 atm (5 ppm).
The outlet gases were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Tianmei, D7900) equipped with a 5 Å molecular sieve column combined with a TCD detector, which was used to analyze the compositions of outlet gases online at an interval of ca. 1 min using the automatic sampling valve. All products were calibrated with standard known concentration gases. Numerical integration of the flow rate–time curves gave the productions of O2 and H2. In this study, the productions of O2 and H2 were normalized to μmol gas per gram of the perovskite oxide (μmol g−1perovskite for La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ) or μmol gas per gram of the material (μmol g−1material for Ce1−xZrxO2−δ).
2.4 DFT calculation details
The composition dependence of oxygen vacancy formation energies (EV) of the complex La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3 perovskite oxides was calculated by DFT+U.36 For a general case, the EV can be expressed as eqn (2): (2)where δ is the oxygen off-stoichiometry value, x and y are the ratios of the doping level, μO is the chemical potential of oxygen which is set at −4.73 eV here, E(La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3) is the energy of the vacancy-free supercell, and E(La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ) is the energy of the supercell containing an oxygen vacancy.
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations of E(La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3) and E(La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ) were performed by using the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP-5.2.12).37,38 The projected augmented wave (PAW)39,40 method was used with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)41 exchange–correlation functional. The cut-off energy for the plane wave basis set was set at 700 eV. The partial occupancies for each orbital were determined by Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.1 eV. The threshold of energy convergence of the electronic relaxation was set to 10−5 eV. Geometry optimizations were stopped when forces on each atom were less than 0.05 eV Å−1. The on-site Coulomb corrections for the 3d states of Co, 4d states of Ga and 4f states of La were included by the DFT+U36,42 approach with the effective on-site Coulomb interaction parameters of 5.0 eV, 3.9 eV and 8.1 eV, respectively, and the effective on-site exchange interaction parameter of La was set at 0.6 eV.
The crystal structures of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ were determined using the XRD data (see Fig. 1, 2, S1 and S2†). When x = 0 and y = 0 (the un-doped case), the initial structure was taken as an orthorhombic distorted perovskite, with 20 atoms in a unit cell for the vacancy free structure and 79 atoms plus 1 oxygen vacancy in a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell for the vacancy-containing structure. For other cases, the initial structures were taken as rhombohedral supercells, with random substitutions of Sr for La at the A-site and Co for Ga at the B-site. K-point grids of 10 × 10 × 10 and 4 × 4 × 4 were generated by the Monkhorst–Pack43 scheme for sampling the Brillouin zones of unit cells and supercells, respectively. For each case of doping, four samples of oxygen vacancy sites were randomly chosen. The resulting energies were Boltzmann averaged at experimental reduction temperature (1623 K).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Physicochemical characterization

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and used LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (x = 0–0.5) samples. The as-synthesized LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y ≤ 0.01) samples (calcined at 800 °C) adopt a typical ABO3−δ orthorhombic structure (Pbnm) (Fig. 1a). The peak at ∼32.5° 2θ tends to broaden and split into two peaks as the Co content is higher than 10 atom% (Fig. 1b), which is an indication of the rhombohedral structure (R3c). The orthorhombic structure (Pbnm) is maintained after TCWS for intrinsic LaGaO3−δ and micro cobalt doped LaGaO3−δ, e.g. LGC1 (Fig. 1b and d). However, the peak at around 32.5° 2θ for the used LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y ≥ 0.1) oxides split into two peaks (Fig. 1d), which is a typical pattern for the rhombohedral structure (R3c). This indicates that phase segregation between the rhombohedral structure (R3c) and the orthorhombic structure (Pbnm) occurred for the used LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y ≥ 0.1) samples. It should be pointed out that the missing (111) peak around 19° 2θ for both fresh and used perovskite oxides (Fig. 1a and c) suggests that the Co dopant randomly occupies the B-site.32,44 Compared with intrinsic LaGaO3−δ, the diffraction peaks of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (x = 0–0.5) slightly shift to a higher 2θ angle, which implies the occurrence of lattice shrinkage (Fig. 1b and d). This is ascribed to the smaller ionic radius of Co3+ (0.545 Å) compared to Ga3+ (0.620 Å). On the other hand, doping with Co element results in a decrease of crystallite size for the as-synthesized LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y = 0–0.5). But, these crystallite size differences disappear after TCWS reaction (see Table S2†). The XRD patterns for the as-synthesized and used LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y = 0.5–0.9) and La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (x = 0–0.5) are shown in Fig. S1–S2.† It was found that further doping Sr into the structure of LGC50 leads to the appearance of phase impurities and an unstable ABO3−δ structure (especially at high temperature). When the Sr content is over 30 atom%, the ABO3−δ perovskite structure of La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (x = 0–0.5) becomes unstable and starts to decompose into several other phases under an inert atmosphere (Ar) and at 1623 K, which can't be completely regenerated to the initial ABO3−δ structure after H2O splitting.
The ABO3−δ structure transformation process within an overall water splitting cycle is further studied (Fig. 2). Except for a small amount of the orthorhombic (Pbnm) phase, the re-oxidized LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0) mainly adopt a rhombohedral structure (R3c), which will transform into an orthorhombic structure (Pbnm) after reduction at 1350 °C in an Ar atmosphere (Fig. 2a). This structure transformation phenomenon is reproducible during the subsequent TCWS cycles. Since the phase change is thermodynamically favorable for a chemical reaction, we speculate that this reverse change of the crystal structure can thermodynamically boost the water splitting performance of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ. Namely, the crystal structure change phenomenon partly contributed to the enhanced H2O splitting results of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (see Fig. 5). The slight shift of XRD peaks to higher 2θ angles for the used LGC50-Ir(1.0) indicates that some iridium atoms still remained in the ABO3−δ structure even after high temperature treatment (1350 °C) (Fig. 2b). As observed in the followed water splitting performance (see Fig. 5 and S4†), when the Co dopant is in excess of 60 atom%, the re-oxidation rates of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y ≥ 0.7) become very slow and it is hard to completely re-oxidize to its initial state. As a result, a part of the MOred phase that adopts an orthorhombic structure (Pbnm) is identified in the used LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y ≥ 0.7) samples (see Fig. S1†).
We also investigated the short-range structure changes and surface information of reduced (Red) and re-oxidized (Ox) LGC50-Ir(1.0) by using 325 nm and 532 Raman spectra (see Fig. 3). The observed vibrational band at ∼664 cm−1 is probably due to Co–O vibrational modes associated with the CoO6 octahedral structure, which is paired with an oxygen vacancy in its vicinity.45,46 Actually, according to the calculated oxygen vacancy utilization percentage, ca. 10–20%, VO remained in the structure of LGC50 or LGC50-Ir(1.0) even after conducting the H2O splitting reaction for an adequate time (see Fig. 9). Similar to the Raman spectra of La1−xSrxGa1−yMnyO3, the broad bands at around 500 and 560 cm−1 are assigned to the bending and Jahn–Teller (JT)-active antisymmetric stretching (AS) vibrational modes of CoO6 octahedra, respectively; the band located at about 664 cm−1 is attributed to symmetric stretching (SS) vibrational modes of CoO6 octahedra.46 The weak broad band at ∼1310 cm−1 is due to the second harmonic generation of electrons. A large Raman shift (∼16 cm−1) occurred between LGC50-Ir(1.0)-Ox and LGC50-Ir(1.0)-Red. The Raman bands will shift to higher wavenumbers after substituting heavy ions with lighter ions.45 This indicates that the heavier iridium ion is partly extracted out of or re-doped into the LGC50 crystal structure when undergoing re-oxidation or reduction reactions, respectively. Compared to the surface sensitive 325 nm Raman spectra, the 532 nm Raman spectra reveal much more sub-surface or bulk information.47 As shown, the 532 nm Raman spectra of fresh LGC50 and the used LGC50 display several weak vibrational modes in the lower frequency region of 100–400 cm−1, which is a characteristic of the orthorhombic structure (Pbnm).48 The intensity of the vibrational peak at ∼664 cm−1 for the used LGC50 is stronger than that for fresh LGC50. This suggests that the bulk phase of LGC50 is not completely re-oxidized by H2O(g) after the splitting reaction, mainly caused by limited mass conduction. In contrast, the 325 nm Raman spectra of LGC50-Ir(1.0)-Ox show no obvious vibrational modes in the frequency region of 100–400 cm−1, and the vibrational band at ∼664 cm−1 decreases. This is normal in most cases, since the re-oxidation percentage of the surface part of sample is usually higher than that of the bulk phase. It is abnormal that the 325 nm Raman spectrum of LGC50-Ir(1.0)-Red is much similar to that of LGC50-Ir(1.0)-Ox. To our knowledge, the LGC50-Ir(1.0)-Red is partly re-oxidized when exposed to air, while the iridium ions are hardly extracted out of the ABO3−δ perovskite structure at room temperature; thus, it influences the Raman results.
 Fig. 3  325 nm and 532 nm Raman spectra of fresh LGC50, used LGC50, and reduced (Red) and re-oxidized (Ox) LGC50-Ir(1.0) with reduction and re-oxidation (H2O splitting reaction) at 1350 and 800 °C, respectively. The inserted enlarged image shows the Raman shift (∼16 cm−1) between LGC50-Ir(1.0)-Ox and LGC50-Ir(1.0)-Red. 
The SEM images of the as-synthesized and used LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0) are demonstrated in Fig. S3.† The as-synthesized LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0) (calcined at 800 °C) display a macro-porous morphology. Doping iridium element on a micro-scale can alleviate the sintering problem to some extent. But, after H2O splitting reaction (redox between 1350 and 800 °C), particle sizes of both used LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0) increase up to ∼5 μm. Interestingly, the used LGC50-Ir(1.0) exhibits a smoother surface than the used LGC50 (Fig. S3A2 and B2†). It seems that iridium is useful to modify the composition and properties of the surface of LGC50. But this should be further investigated in future work. Such a sintering effect is also confirmed by the changes of crystallite sizes and BET surface areas. As for LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y = 0–0.5), their crystallite sizes are increased from 18–40 nm to 58–75 nm, and their specific surface areas are decreased from 2.2–3.3 m2 g−1 to 0.5–0.9 m2 g−1 after H2O splitting tests (redox between 1350 and 650 °C) (see Table S2†).
To study the microstructure and element distribution, high resolution SEM (HR-SEM) images and corresponding EDX mappings of the used LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0) were recorded (Fig. 4). The La element is distributed evenly for both re-oxidized and reduced LGC50, while the Co and Ga elements show a non-uniform distribution (Fig. 4A and B). The used LGC50-Ir(1.0) also displays an even distribution of La element and a similar non-uniform distribution of Co and Ga elements (Fig. 4C and D). The non-uniform distribution of elements can be explained by the phase segregation for the used LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0). As shown by the XRD patterns, the LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0) perovskite oxides undergo a reversible phase transformation between the rhombohedral structure (R3c) and the orthorhombic structure (Pbnm) within a TCWS redox cycle (see Fig. 2). As a result, the inevitable phase segregation is observed in the XRD patterns (see Fig. 1 and 2), which is in good agreement with EDX mappings. Several IrOx particles are observed for both re-oxidized and reduced LGC50-Ir(1.0). However, a certain amount of iridium element still remained in the bulk of LGC50-Ir(1.0) after high temperature TCWS. This is proved by the slight XRD peak shift between re-oxidized LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0) (see Fig. 2b). This suggests that the iridium element is partly segregated from the bulk of LGC50-Ir(1.0) after H2O splitting.

3.2 Thermochemical water splitting performance

Fig. 5 shows the O2/H2 release rates and productions of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y = 0–1.0). As shown in Fig. 5a, the oxygen release rate is increased as the cobalt dopant content is increased from 10 to 50 atom%, and the average oxygen release rate of LGC50 at 1350 °C is about 4 μmol O2 min−1 g−1perovskite. As the y value increases to 0.1, the peak H2 generation rate reaches a maximal value of 89 μmol H2 min−1 g−1perovskite (Fig. 5b). However, the hydrogen release rate starts to decrease with a further increase of cobalt content. The maximal hydrogen release rate of LGC50 is only one eighth (1/8) that of LGC10 (Fig. 5b). Fig. 5c is the oxygen and hydrogen productions of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y = 0–1.0). It can be seen that intrinsic LaGaO3−δ displays negligible H2O splitting activity; the oxygen and hydrogen productions of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ are determined by the content of the Co dopant. As the Co content is increased from 0 to 50 atom%, the oxygen and hydrogen productions carried out between 1350 and 650 °C are increased to 268 μmol O2 g−1perovskite and 406 μmol H2 g−1perovskite, respectively. It was found that the H2 release rate at 650 °C becomes very slow as the Co content is in excess of 50 atom% (Fig. 5b). In order to enhance the H2O splitting kinetics, the re-oxidation temperature of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y ≥ 0.5) is increased to 800 °C (the right part of Fig. 5c), which can increase the maximal H2 release rate of LGC50 by 0.74 fold, from 10.2 to 17.5 μmol H2 min−1 g−1perovskite (Fig. S4b†). The oxygen release capacities can be further increased from 272 to 321 μmol O2 g−1perovskite by increasing the cobalt content from 50 to 70 atom%. But the H2 generation rate of LGC70 at 800 °C is too slow to quickly reach an equilibrium state and its H2 release reaction is not finished even after 530 min (Fig. S4b†). As a result, the detected H2 production within 530 min for LGC70 is largely deviated from 2 times the amount of O2 (Fig. 5c). Unlike intrinsic LaGaO3−δ, the un-doped LaCoO3−δ specifically demonstrates TCWS activity. The intrinsic LaCoO3−δ displays the largest O2 production of 500 μmol O2 g−1perovskite; however, its H2 release rate at 800 °C is very slow (see Fig. S4†) and its re-oxidation percentage is only ∼7% within the investigated interval (∼250 min) (see Fig. 9). As illustrated above, the O2 and H2 productions are increased monotonically with the Co content. These results indicate that cobalt is the redox active center for LaGa1-yCoyO3−δ based TCWS, which is further confirmed by the following XPS characterization (Fig. 8 and Table 1). The decreasing trend of H2 generation rate with increasing Co content is possibly due to a decrease of the thermodynamic driving force for re-oxidation of the reduced oxide (MOred).

The O2 and H2 productions of LGC70 and LaCoO3−δ samples are based on the first cycle data; the others are stable cycle data. More detailed O2 and H2 release rate–time data are shown in Fig. S4–S6.†

It is noteworthy that the stable H2 release capacity of LGC60 reaches 478 μmol H2 g−1perovskite, which is about 3 times that of La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.6Al0.4O3−δ (LSMA6464). The LSMA6464 was reported to have a H2 yield 9× greater (307 μmol H2 g−1LSMA6464) than that of ceria (32 μmol H2 g−1CeO2).7 According to our repeated experiments, the H2 production of LSMA6464 in the first cycle is about 254 μmol H2 g−1perovskite, which is gradually decreased to ∼179 μmol H2 g−1perovskite after 3 consecutive TCWS cycles (Fig. S5†). The small difference between the measured H2 production of LSMA6464 in the first H2O splitting cycle in the literature and in our paper might be caused by the different H2 detection methods in the literature (thermogravimetry (TG) technique)7 and in our experiment (gas chromatography (GC) technique). It was found by A. Steinfeld that the formation and segregation of a carbonate phase during oxidation by CO2 occurred for Ca, Sr and Al-doped LaMnO3−δ perovskites, which had an inevitable influence on the TG technique detected CO production.31 This implies that the TG technique just reflects the weight change which is easily influenced by other factors except for adsorption of oxygen atoms. The repeated cycle performance of LSMA6464 and LGC60 is displayed in Fig. S5 and S6.† As shown, the LGC60 shows much more stable and higher O2/H2 productions than LSMA6464. For comparison, Ce0.85Zr0.15O2−δ was also synthesized and evaluated by the H2O splitting test under the same conditions (Fig. 5c). The H2 production of LGC60 is 3.3 and 15-fold that of Ce0.85Zr0.15O2−δ (143 μmol H2 g−1material) and CeO2−δ (32 μmol H2 g−1material), respectively. According to these comparison results, the optimized LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ perovskite oxide, LG60, has a much higher O2/H2 production than LSMA6464 and the current state-of-the-art material, CeO2−δ. The explored LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ perovskite oxide is a promising material in the application of solar thermochemical H2O splitting.
We also investigated the influences of re-oxidation temperatures on TCWS activity for the LGC50 sample. As demonstrated in Fig. S7a and b,† increasing the H2O splitting reaction temperature from 550 to 1100 °C has a positive effect on the hydrogen release rate of LGC50. When the H2O splitting temperature is set at 1100 °C, the maximal hydrogen release rate reaches 26 μmol H2 min−1 g−1perovskite. From the viewpoint of kinetics, a proper increase of reaction temperature is beneficial for H2O splitting reaction, which is consistent with the typical Arrhenius equation . But from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, the H2O splitting reaction is an exothermic reaction (ΔrH°m(T) < 0);20,49 higher reaction temperature is detrimental to its thermodynamic driving force . If H2O splitting is conducted below 650 °C, the H2 release rate is too slow to be acceptable (along with insufficient re-oxidation percentage), while higher reaction temperature (e.g. >900 °C) is thermodynamically unfavorable for H2 production (Fig. S7c†). Furthermore, the H2 release reverse reaction (H2 oxidation or oxygen release process) is more favorable when the reaction temperature is above 1000 °C, which has been proved to have a large influence on H2 production.50 Consequently, a gradual decrease of O2/H2 productions was observed when the H2 release temperature was too low (<650 °C) or too high (>900 °C) (see Fig. S7c†). As a compromise, in order to obtain an optimal H2O splitting result, the redox temperatures must be selected properly, e.g., 1350/800 °C is optimal for the LGC50 sample.
In order to further enhance the H2O splitting kinetics, iridium as a catalyst was used to increase the H2 release rate of LGC50 based two-step TCWS. Fig. 6 illustrates the hydrogen release rate and O2/H2 productions of y atom% IrOx:LaGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (y = 0, 0. 5, 1.0, and 1.5). 1.0 atom% IrOx as a catalyst doped into the structure of LGC50, named LGC50-Ir(1.0), can increase the H2 release rate by 1.3-fold (Fig. 6a). The enhanced H2 release rate for iridium added samples may be ascribed to the catalytic function of IrOx, which increases the mixed ions and electronic conductivity (MIEC) of oxides.51 However, with a further increase of iridium content (e.g. > 1.0 atom%), the maximal H2 release rate starts to decrease. The introduction of iridium ions into the structure of LGC50 may weaken the metal oxygen bonds (M–O) to some extent.52 Therefore, the onset reduction temperature is decreased for iridium added LGC50 (Fig. S8†). Since the re-oxidation process (H2O splitting reaction) is the inverse reaction of MOox reduction, over doping of iridium into LGC50 will change the thermodynamic driving force of H2O splitting reaction. Actually, we have certainly confirmed from XRD patterns that some iridium atoms still remained in the ABO3−δ crystal structure for the used LGC50-Ir(1.0) (see Fig. 2b).
 Fig. 6  (a) The hydrogen release rate–time profiles; (b) the oxygen and hydrogen productions of y atom% IrOx:LaGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (y = 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5), abbreviated as LGC50-Ir(y), with reduction at 1350 °C and re-oxidation at 800 °C. 
The Sr dopant was found useful to tune the metal oxygen bond (M–O) strength and the oxygen vacancy formation energy (EV) of ABO3−δ based perovskite oxides.29,33 Herein, the effect of A-site doping for La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5; y = 0 and 0.5) samples was also investigated. Fig. S9† exhibits the O2 and H2 release curves and corresponding productions of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5; y = 0 and 0.5) samples with reduction at 1350 °C and re-oxidation at 800 °C. As shown in Fig. S9c,† the Co-free sample of LSG10 is inactive to split H2O; the oxygen release capacity of La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) is monotonically increased along with the Sr content. However, the H2 release rate becomes particularly slow for all Sr-doped samples (Fig. S9b†), so we just perform the first redox cycle for these samples. This is caused by the fact that the Sr dopant is effective in weakening the metal oxygen bonds (M–O), leading to decreased EV (Fig. 10) and lowered onset reduction temperature (Fig. S9a†). The Sr dopant is useful to promote the reaction of oxide reduction, but it is detrimental to the thermodynamic driving force of MOred re-oxidation. On the other hand, doping with Sr element brings some impurity phases (such as La2O3 and SrCO3) to the as-synthesized samples. The concentration of these impurity phases is decreased in the used samples (Fig. S2†). If the Sr content is higher than 10 atom%, La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (x ≥ 0.1) samples become unstable under high temperature conditions (>800 °C) in an Ar atmosphere (Fig. S9a†); they will decompose into tetragonal LaSrGaO4 (PDF# 83-1004) and LaSrCoO4 (PDF# 83-2412). For instance, the ABO3−δ perovskite structure of LSGC5555 is completely collapsed after reduction treatment at 1350 °C in an Ar atmosphere. It transforms into multi-phase tetragonal LaSrGaO4 (PDF# 83-1004) and LaSrCoO4 (PDF# 83-2412) and Sr2CoxGa1−xO5−δ (referenced to Sr2(Co1.58Fe0.42)O5: PDF# 82-2446) (Fig. S2†). This is the main reason why LSGC5555 is almost inactive in the TCWS test (Fig. S9†). In order to make a balance between O2/H2 productions and chemical reaction rate/material stability, an optimal doping level of different dopants (such as Co and Sr) is required.
To further study the influences of different dopants (e.g. Sr and Co) on the H2 release rate, the temperature programmed H2O splitting test (TPO-H2O) was implemented. Fig. 7 demonstrates the TPO-H2O results of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ (x = 0–0.3 and y = 0.5–1.0). As shown, the H2O splitting onset temperature is about 400 °C. The H2 release rate is monotonically increased along with the reaction temperature when it is below 800 °C. As for LGC50, either addition of the Sr dopant or further increase of Co content leads to a large decrease of H2 release rate. The addition of the A-site Sr dopant is much more harmful to the reaction kinetics of MOred re-oxidation (H2O splitting reaction), and the H2 release rate of LSGC9155 is much slower than that of LGC60. According to the following DFT calculation results, further increasing the Co content above 50 atom% results in less change in the EV of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y ≥ 0.5), while Sr dopant containing La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (x = 0, 0.125, and 0.25) perovskite oxides exhibit much smaller EV values than Sr free LGC50 (Fig. 10). It seems that addition of the Sr dopant is more effective in altering the thermodynamics of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ (x = 0–0.3 and y = 0.5–1.0) than increasing the Co dopant content. Except for the thermodynamic properties, other factors, such as interfacial reaction and bulk ionic conductivity, may also influence the H2 release kinetics. This issue should be investigated by more well designed experiments in the future work. Since the active MOred is continuously consumed (re-oxidized) throughout the whole TPO-H2O process, it is normal that the H2 release rate will start to decrease after a certain reaction time and a maximal H2 release rate is observed. The TPO-H2O results displayed in Fig. 7 imply that the H2O splitting reaction is mainly controlled by reaction kinetics when the reaction temperature is below 800 °C. The peak of the TPO-H2O curve shifts to higher temperature as the Co content increases from 50 to 70 atom%. This suggests that further doping with cobalt (>50 atom%) can continuously weaken metal oxygen bonds (M–O) to some extent and increase the chemical potential of oxygen on the solid interface, μO,solid-(interface). It is abnormal that a H2 release pulse is observed at ∼950 °C in all TPO-H2O curves, which is likely caused by the onset of catalytic H2O splitting at high temperature. We have reported such a catalytic H2O/CO2 splitting phenomenon in our previous studies.9,53 Herein, a metal oxide catalyzed H2O splitting phenomenon is apparently observed when the reaction temperature is in excess of 1100 °C (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Temperature programmed H2O splitting (TPO-H2O) results of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ (x = 0–0.3 and y = 0.5–1.0) perovskite oxides. A maximal reduction temperature of 1350 °C was used for all TPO-H2O splitting tests. The background H2 signal of the blank experiment with inert Al2O3 has been subtracted from the TPO-H2O results. 
Except for the absolute O2/H2 productivities, one should also pay attention to the steam to H2 conversion ratio, which has a significant influence on the energy penalty and practical viability of a thermochemical water splitting system. In this work, we used a large excess of steam (0.5 mL min−1 H2O (l) carried out by 100 sccm Ar, namely, H2O (g) vol% ∼86%) and a small amount of active material (0.5 g) to evaluate the absolute O2 and H2 productivities of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ perovskite oxides. The conversion ratio of steam to hydrogen is further analyzed and shown in Fig. S10.† As shown, under the above mentioned re-oxidation conditions, the LGC10 displays a relatively high maximal steam to H2 conversion ratio, 0.16%. With further increasing the Co content to 50 atom%, the maximal steam to H2 conversion ratio gradually decreased to ∼0.02%. The LGC50 and LSMA6464 demonstrate a similar maximal steam to H2 conversion ratio of ∼0.03% when reduced at 1350 °C and re-oxidized at 800 °C. When the y value is below 0.6, the average steam to H2 conversion ratio of LGa1−yCoyO3−δ for the initial 50 min (∼0.008%) is about double that for the initial 100 min. This indicates that the tails of re-oxidation reactions could largely decrease the steam to H2 conversion ratio and should be avoided in the optimized operation mode. As for LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (0.1 ≤ y ≤ 0.6) samples, it is appreciated that their average steam to H2 conversion ratios for the initial 50 and 100 min, respectively, both are equal to or greater than that of LSMA6464.
As illustrated above, the steam to hydrogen conversion ratios for LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ perovskite oxides under the used evaluation conditions are still very low (<1%) and far away from the practical demand (Fig. S10†). This is a common tradeoff in this field and more attention should be paid in future material screening work.7,54 In order to enhance the steam to hydrogen conversion ratio, we have tried to increase the re-oxidation temperature, e.g. from 650 to 800 °C, and add iridium catalyst into the LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ based TCWS system. It was found that both strategies displayed a positive effect. When increasing the re-oxidation temperature from 650 to 800 °C, the steam to H2 conversion ratio of LGC50 within the initial 50 min can be increased by ∼30%. 1.0 atom% IrOx as a catalyst doped into structure of LGC50, named LGC50-Ir(1.0), can increase the steam to H2 conversion ratio for the initial 50 min by ∼30%. It should be noticed that the steam to hydrogen conversion ratio is determined not only by the intrinsic properties of TCWS materials but also by the dosage of the redox material and steam concentration. Herein, we didn’t investigate other factors in detail. Nevertheless, the steam to H2 conversion ratio is an essential parameter that has only recently become apparent in this field but really should get more attention.
3.3 XPS analysis
The chemical states of Co and Ga elements were studied by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy technique. Fig. 8 shows the asymmetrical X-ray photoelectron spectra of the Co 2p level, which are similar to the previously reported results.55,56 As shown, the Co 2p level spectra display two main peaks at ∼780 and ∼796 eV, which are attributed to the ionization of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 electrons, respectively. To further de-convolute the overlapped XPS spectra, the Shirley method was used for background subtraction and a mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian, GL(30), peak type was applied for peak fitting. It can be seen that the surface cobalt element displays two different chemical states (Co2+ and Co3+) for both re-oxidized (Ox) and reduced (Red) oxides.57,58 The characteristic satellite peaks located at ∼786 and ∼803 eV corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, were reported as a feature of octahedral occupied Co2+.57,59 Herein, an increased intensity of satellite peaks is observed for reduced samples (Fig. 8avs.8b and cvs.8d), which indicates an increased concentration of Co2+. The binding energies of different peaks are consistent with previously reported literature.57,58 The peaks at higher binding energies of ∼782 eV (Co 2p3/2) and ∼797.5 eV (Co 2p1/2) are ascribed to Co2+; and the peaks at lower binding energies of ∼780 eV (Co 2p3/2) and ∼795.3 eV (Co 2p1/2) are assigned to Co3+. The detailed binding energies and corresponding Co2+/Co3+ ratios are given in Table 1, which demonstrates an evident change of the Co2+/Co3+ ratio between the re-oxidized and reduced samples. As for the reduced LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0), the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ is ca. 0.31 and 0.30, respectively. After H2O splitting reaction, the re-oxidized samples show smaller Co2+/Co3+ values. In particular, the Co2+/Co3+ ratio of re-oxidized LGC50-Ir(1.0) (Co2+/Co3+ = 0.22) is slightly smaller than that of re-oxidized LGC50 (Co2+/Co3+ = 0.25). This suggests that the re-oxidation extent of LGC50-Ir(1.0) is higher than that of LGC50 (Fig. 9a), which is consistent with its enhanced hydrogen production in the initial H2O splitting stage (Fig. 6b). As illustrated above, the cobalt element is the redox active center for LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ based TCWS and the redox reaction between Co2+ and Co3+ is promoted by the iridium catalyst. It should be noted that the XPS results just reveal the surface information.

The reduction (reduction under an Ar atmosphere and cooling to room temperature with Ar protection) and re-oxidation (H2O splitting reaction) reactions were conducted at 1350 and 800 °C, respectively. The detailed binding energies and corresponding Co2+/Co3+ ratios are shown in Table 1. 
 Fig. 9  The oxygen vacancy concentration (δ) and its utilization percentage (X) of (a) LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y = 0–1.0) and (b) La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (x = 0–0.3) perovskite oxides with reduction at 1350 °C (40 min) and re-oxidation at 650 or 800 °C. The oxygen vacancy concentration (δ) is calculated from the amount of released O2; the initial oxygen vacancy concentration (δinitial) for the as-synthesized perovskite oxides (calcined at 800 °C and under air conditions) is assumed to be zero. The oxygen vacancy utilization percentage (X) is calculated from the ratio of molar based H2 and O2 productions (X% = (100 × nH2)/(2 × nO2)). The data of Ce0.85Zr0.15O2−δ (ref. 62) (aredox between 1400 and 800 °C) and the synthesized Ce0.85Zr0.15O2−δ, LSMA6464, and LGC50-Ir(1.0) are also shown for comparison. The O2 and H2 productions of LGC70, LaCoO3−δ, LSGC9155, and LSGC7355 samples are based on the first cycle data; the others are based on stable cycle data (VO: oxygen vacancy). 
Fig. S11† shows the Ga 2p spectra of LGC50 and LGC50-Ir(1.0). The binding energies of Ga 2p3/2 and Ga 2p1/2 are located at 1116.9 and 1143.8 eV, respectively. The binding energies of Ga 2p for re-oxidized and reduced samples almost remained at the same values. It seems that the chemical state of Ga element is not changed for both re-oxidized and reduced LGC50 (Fig. S11a†) and LGC50-Ir(1.0) (Fig. S11b†). According to the literature, the Ga0 2p spectra are characterized by 1116.3 ± 0.2 eV (Ga 2p3/2) and 1143.3 ± 0.2 eV (Ga 2p1/2). The binding energies of higher valence Ga3+ (Ga2O3) are located at 1118.1 ± 0.2 eV (Ga 2p3/2) and 1145.1 ± 0.2 eV (Ga 2p1/2), respectively.60,61 As described above, the chemical environment of Ga element within the LGC50 perovskite structure is different from that of Ga0 and Ga3+ (Ga2O3), which maybe exists as Gaδ+. However, the reduction of Ga3+ to Gaδ+ or Ga0 is energetically unfavorable under the investigated experimental conditions, so the existence of surface Gaδ+ is not reasonable. Instead, we suggest that the chemical environment of Ga3+ in the crystal of LGC50 is much similar to that of Ga0.
3.4 Oxygen vacancy utilization
The oxygen vacancy concentration (δ) and its utilization percentage (X) are also evaluated for LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y = 0–1.0) and La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (x = 0–0.3) perovskite oxides. As shown in Fig. 9a, the δ value of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y = 0–1.0) is gradually increased as the content of the Co dopant is increased. The δ value of LGC60 is 0.16, which is 5 and 4 times that of Ce0.85Zr0.15O2−δ (δ = 0.03) and LSMA6464 (δ = 0.04), respectively. The δ value of the LaCoO3−δ reaches a maximum of 0.25. Ce0.85Zr0.15O2−δ was reported to show a δ value of ∼0.06 when it was reduced at 1400 °C and under an inert atmosphere (10 ppm O2).62 Although the oxygen vacancy utilization is slightly decreased as the Co dopant content varied from 10 to 60 atom%, it remained at a relatively stable level of ∼80%. However, the oxygen vacancy utilization is significantly decreased from 83 to 7% when the Co dopant content is further increased from 60 to 100 atom%. It is apparent that the doping of Ga into the crystal structure of LaCoO3−δ is effective in enhancing the oxygen vacancy utilization. As for LGC50, its oxygen vacancy utilization is slightly enhanced when rising the re-oxidation temperature from 650 to 800 °C. Interestingly, the presence of iridium catalyst, e.g. LGC50-Ir(1.0), can further enhance the oxygen vacancy utilization by ∼5% (see Fig. 9a). The effect of doping Sr at the A-site is displayed in Fig. 9b. When adding 30 atom% Sr dopant into the structure of La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3−δ (x = 0–0.3), the δ value continues to increase from 0.14 to 0.17, but it leads to a sharp decrease of oxygen vacancy utilization. Therefore, increasing the contents of both A-site Sr and B-site Co dopants is effective in increasing the δ values of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ. These doping studies are useful to increase the oxygen production, while over doping will influence the oxygen vacancy utilization, which determines the H2 production. In order to obtain an optimal H2O splitting reactivity, care should be taken during doping.
3.5 DFT calculation
The DFT+U calculated oxygen vacancy formation energies (EV) of the complex La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3 perovskite oxides are depicted in Fig. 10. The predicted EV spans from nearly 0.7 to about 5.3 eV under vacuum conditions at 1623 K, depending on the contents of Sr and Co dopants. The calculated EV values are consistent with the data from the literature.34 Compared with orthorhombic LaGaO3 (EV = 5.3 eV), the EV of rhombohedral LGC25 is about 2.3 eV lower (Fig. 10, line a). When further increasing the Co dopant content from 25 to 75 atom%, the EV value decreases from 3.0 to 2.2 eV. It is abnormal that the LaCoO3 demonstrates a larger EV (EV = 2.9 eV) than LGC75 (EV = 2.2 eV), which may be caused by the simplified calculation model. The selection of unit cells (such as 9-atom, 39-atom and 79-atom supercells) seems to have little influence on the EV.34 Actually, when forming oxygen vacancies, the phase segregation between the rhombohedral structure (R3c) and the orthorhombic structure (Pbnm) for LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ (y ≥ 0. 1) oxides (see Fig. 1 and 2) may influence their EV. This phase segregation is difficult to fully consider for a simplified calculation model, so we didn’t consider it in the present DFT calculation. As for LGC50, doping with Sr element, La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3, causes the EV to further decrease. When the x value is increased from 0 to 0.25, the EV is decreased from ∼2.9 to ∼0.7 eV (Fig. 10, line b).
 Fig. 10  DFT+U calculated oxygen vacancy formation energies (EV) of (a) LaGa1−yCoyO3 (y = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) and (b) La1−xSrxGa0.5Co0.5O3 (x = 0, 0.125, and 0.25) compositions. The resulting energies were Boltzmann averaged at experimental reduction temperature (1623 K). The EV data of orthorhombic LaGaO3 () and LaCoO3 () are taken from ref. 34. 
The DFT calculation results demonstrate that both A-site Sr and B-site Co dopants are useful to decrease the EV of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3; namely, the metal oxygen bonds (M–O) are weakened and the lattice oxygen becomes more labile after doping with Sr and Co elements. It should be pointed out that the weakening of metal oxygen bonds (M–O) is more apparent when the Co content is below 10 atom%, while further increase of Co dopant content (e.g. from 10 to 100 atom%) shows a smaller effect on EV. Generally, the weakening of metal oxygen bonds (M–O) of oxides will lead to the decrease of their onset reduction temperature. In experiments, we observed that doping Co into the structure of LaGaO3−δ made it (e.g. LGC10) reducible below 1350 °C. But, the onset reduction temperature of LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ oxides remains almost the same (ca. 900 °C) when the Co content is between 10 and 50 atom% (Fig. 5a) and is slightly decreased when the Co content is higher than 60 atom% (Fig. S4a†). Correspondingly, the calculated EV values of LaGa1−yCoyO3 also show a similar variation trend; that is, the decrease rate of EV becomes slow as the Co content is in excess of 10 atom% (Fig. 10, line a). This suggests that the weakening of metal oxygen bonds (M–O) of LaGa1−yCoyO3 is more obvious as the Co dopant content is at low levels (e.g. <10 atom). The continuous increase of δ values for LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ perovskite oxides with high levels of the Co dopant (e.g. >10 atom%) is mainly accounted for by the increased amount of the redox active center (Co2+/Co3+). In contrast, the onset reduction temperature of LSGC9155 decreases to ∼700 °C. A large amount of O2 is released at ∼980 °C for both LSGC7355 and LSGC5555 (Fig. S9a†). The calculated EV results are consistent with the oxygen evolution behaviors in our experiments. Also, the equilibrium oxygen non-stoichiometries (δ) determined from the oxygen productions under reducing conditions (1350 °C, PO2 ∼5.0 × 10−6 atm) support the calculated variable trend of EV (see Fig. 9).
4. Conclusions
The Sr- and Co-doped LaGaO3−δ were prepared to split H2O via the solar thermochemical reduction/re-oxidation cycle. Compared with inert LaGaO3−δ, doping of Co2+/Co3+ at the B-site of LaGa1−xCoxO3−δ makes it redox active. The O2/H2 release capacities are increased as the cobalt content increased. The oxygen vacancy concentration (δ) is gradually increased as the Sr- and Co-dopant contents increased, and the δ value of LGC60 reaches 0.16 after reduction for 40 min at 1350 °C, which is 5 and 4 times that of Ce0.85Zr0.15O2−δ and LSMA6464, respectively. The H2 yield of LGC60 (478 μmol H2 g−1perovskite) is 3.3 and 15 times that of Ce0.85Zr0.15O2−δ (143 μmol H2 g−1material) and CeO2−δ (32 μmol H2 g−1material), respectively, when reduced at 1350 °C and re-oxidized at optimized 800 or 1000 °C. 1.0 atom% IrOx as a catalyst doped into the structure of LGC50, named LGC50-Ir(1.0), can increase the H2 release rate by 1.3-fold. The XPS results reveal that the cobalt dopant is the only redox active element and the H2O splitting reaction is driven by the Co2+/Co3+ redox pair. The DFT calculation results predict that the oxygen vacancy formation energies (EV) of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3 span from nearly 0.7 to about 5.3 eV under vacuum conditions at 1623 K, depending on the contents of Sr- and Co-dopants. The more the Sr- and Co-dopants the smaller the value of EV. Thus, doping Co at the B-site is responsible for the introduction of redox activity; adjusting Sr and Co contents is effective in tuning the δ and EV values of La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ. It seems that co-doping transition metal elements (e.g. Mn and Co, this work) and the main group metal elements (e.g. Al and Ga, this work) at the B-site of the perovskite oxide (ABO3) structure is promising to develop oxides with good redox activity. In particular, the reverse change of the crystal structure between orthorhombic and rhombohedral for La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ within a redox cycle was first uncovered. It should be pointed out that, at present, the steam to hydrogen conversion ratios for LaGa1−yCoyO3−δ oxides under the used evaluation conditions are still very low (<1%) and far away from the practical demand, which is a common tradeoff in this field, and more attention should be paid in future material screening work. Thus, more detailed and intensive investigations for the La1−xSrxGa1−yCoyO3−δ based redox system are needed. Devoting more attention to other perovskite oxides with similar compositions is also desirable. This work provides a strategy for the design of perovskite oxides with enhanced TCWS reactivity and it will promote the development of solar thermochemical fuel conversion science.
