    , Accepted 10th September 2012First published on 11th September 2012AbstractA symmetrical donor–acceptor–donor D–A–D system built by connecting two dithienopyrrole donor blocks to a central electron acceptor obtained by dimerization of 3-alkoxy-4-cyano-thiophene has been synthesized and characterized. The compound combines a high photoluminescence efficiency with a broad absorption spectrum in the solid state and a band gap of 1.70 eV. A preliminary evaluation of the potentialities of this type of compound as donor material in bulk heterojunction solar cells using PC61BM as electron acceptor is presented.
Introduction
Organic solar cells offer the possibility to develop cost effective photovoltaic devices by means of low environmental impact technologies. Although soluble conjugated polymers remain a major class of donor materials for OPV,1–4 there has been an increasing interest for donor materials based on small molecules in the past few years.5–18 In fact, the unequivocal chemical structure of molecules represents an obvious advantage over polydisperse conjugated polymers in terms of reproducibility of synthesis, purification of the material and performances of the resulting devices. On the other hand, from a fundamental viewpoint, molecules allow a more straightforward and reliable analysis of the structure–properties relationships, an approach which remains the key tool for the design of new materials specifically designed for photovoltaic conversion.5
Among the numerous classes of active molecular materials synthesized during the past few years, conjugated systems derived from symmetrical molecules with a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure have received a great deal of attention as donor materials.6–18
We have already shown that 3-alkoxy-4-cyanothiophene (ACNT) represents an original building block possessing both donor and acceptor substituents on the same thiophene unit.19 We now report on the synthesis of a D–A–D conjugated system built by attaching two dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) donor blocks to a median electron acceptor unit formed by connecting two ACNT cycles by their 2–2′ positions. The optical and electrochemical properties of the resulting molecule have been analyzed and preliminary results on its potentialities as donor material in organic solar cells using PC61BM as acceptor are presented.
Experimental
General
Solvents were purified and dried using standard protocols. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE DRX 500 spectrometer operating at 300.1 and 75.4 MHz; δ are given in ppm (relative to TMS) and coupling constants (J) in Hz. High resolution mass spectra were recorded under FAB mode on a Jeol JMS 700 spectrometer. UV-Visible optical data were recorded with a Perkin Elmer lambda 19 spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded with a PhotonTechnology International Quantamaster 4/2003 spectrofluorometer. HPLC solvents were used for the measurements. Thermal analyses were performed using a TGA 2010 CE (TA Instruments). Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a Biologic SP 150 potentiostat in a standard three-electrode cell equipped with platinum electrodes and a saturated calomel reference electrode.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed using a PicoSpm from Molecular Imaging Inc. All images were recorded in the contact mode with a maximum scan size of 6.5 × 6.5 μm². The images were processed with the WSxM program provided by Nanotech (I. Horcas, R. Fernandez, J. M. Gomez-Rodriguez, J. Colchero, J. Gomez-Herrero, A. M. Baro, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2007, 78, 013705). For each investigated sample, several scans were performed on different sites of the sample and at different scales for better statistics.
Synthesis

5,5′-Dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarbonitrile (3b). 
To a solution of 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarbonitrile (3a) (1 mmol) in CHCl3 (20 mL) stirred at 0 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, 4 eq. of NBS in CHCl3 were added. Stirring was continued in the dark until completion of the reaction as monitored by TLC. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was dried on MgSO4 and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluent 1:1 dichloromethane/petroleum ether) to give a yellow pale solid (60% yield), mp = 77°–78 °C, which rapidly decomposes in air. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ: 0.89–0.99 (m, 12H), 1.25–1.58 (m, 18H), 4.18 (d, 4H, 3J = 5.4 Hz). 13C NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 11.1, 14.0, 22.9, 23.4, 29.0, 30.0, 40.1, 77.4, 99.9, 105.0, 112.2, 138.1, 155.5.


5,5′-Bis(N-(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole)-4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarbonitrile (1). 
2-(Trimethylstannyl)-N-(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (2)20 (0.62 g, 1.37 mmol) was added to a solution of 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarbonitrile (3b) (100 mg, 0.16 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (75 mg, 20 mol%) in 20 mL of toluene. The mixture was heated overnight at 110 °C under inert atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature and addition of water, the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane, the organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluent: 35% dichloromethane in petroleum ether) to give 80 mg (48%) of a shiny blue solid.

Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) methods have been performed with the Gaussian 09 program.21 Becke's three-parameter22 gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) with 6-31G (d,p) basis in vacuum was used to optimize the geometry and to compute the electronic structure at the minima found. The 3D images were obtained using Gaussview.
PCBM was purchased from MER and used as received. All devices were prepared in ambient conditions. ITO coated glasses substrates (10 Ohm, Kintec company) were cleaned in ultrasonic baths and modified by a 40 nm thick spun-cast layer of PEDOT-PSS “Clevios P VP AI 4083” (HC Stark) which was then dried at 130 °C for 15 min. The Baytron suspension was stirred and filtered through a 0.45 mm membrane (Minisart RC 15, Sartorius) just prior to casting. A 100 nm thick layer of Al was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask, at a pressure of about 10−6 mbar. The mask geometry defined a device area of 0.28 cm2. Each ITO coated glass substrate supported two individual devices and for each experiment a minimum of 4 devices (8 cells) was fabricated. After preparation, the devices were characterized in an argon glovebox (200B, MBraun). The J–V curves were recorded in the dark and under illumination using a Keithley 236 source-measure unit and a homemade acquisition program. The light source was an AM 1.5 Solar Constant 575 PV simulator (Steuernagel Lichttecknik, equipped with a metal halogenide lamp). The light intensity was measured by a broad-band power meter (13PEM001, Melles Griot). The devices were illuminated through the ITO electrode side. The reported efficiency values are not corrected for the possible solar simulator spectral mismatch, nor for the reflection/absorbance of the glass/ITO/Baytron coated electrodes.

Results and discussion
The symmetrical compound 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarbonitrile (3a) was synthesized by Stille coupling of the stannylated compound 5 and bromo compound 4 in the presence of a palladium catalyst, according to the already reported procedure (Scheme 1).19 Dibromo compound 3b was obtained in 60% yield by treatment of 3a with an excess of NBS in chloroform. The dibromo compound 3b was then reacted with the Stille reagent of N-2-ethylhexyloxy-dithienopyrrole (2)20 in the presence of a palladium catalyst Pd(PPh3)4 in toluene to give 48% of the target compound 1 as a shiny blue solid. This compound is highly soluble in common organic solvents due to the presence of multiple branched alkyl chains. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that the compound is thermally stable with a 5% weight loss at 315 °C.

Electronic properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of 1 in dichloromethane solution presents a first absorption band in the 265–400 region followed by main broad band extending from 400 to 650 nm with a maximum (λmax) at 525 nm and a molar extinction coefficient (εmax) of 33700 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. 1).

The spectrum of a thin film spun-cast on glass from a methylene chloride solution shows a large broadening of the absorption bands with a 91 nm red shift of λmax compared to the solution spectrum. Furthermore, the main absorption band shows a fine structure with maxima at 525, 562 and 618 nm, suggesting strong intermolecular interactions and possible partial crystallinity. An optical band gap Eg of ∼1.70 eV was evaluated from the onset of the long wavelength absorption edge of the film. Compound 1 exhibits a strong photoluminescence in methylene chloride solution with an emission maximum at 674 nm and fluorescence quantum yield (ϕem) of 0.61 vs. cresyl violet perchlorate as standard.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in methylene chloride in the presence of 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as supporting electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 2, compound 1 can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. The CV shows two reversible one-electron oxidation processes with anodic peak potentials Epa1 and Epa2 at 0.79 and 0.89 V assigned to the formation of the cation radical and dication. In the negative potential region the CV presents two reversible reduction waves with cathodic peak potentials Epc1 and Epc2 at −1.29 and −1.68 V respectively. Comparison of the two processes shows that the difference Epa2 – Epa1 (100 mV) is much smaller than Epc2 – Epc1 (390 mV). This difference is consistent with weakly interacting positive charges in the dicationic states while in contrast the two negatives charges of the dianion are likely to be localized in the middle of the molecule and hence subject to repulsive coulombic interactions. Using an offset of −4.99 eV for SCE vs. the vacuum level23 leads to estimated HOMO and LUMO levels of −5.78 eV and −3.70 eV. On the other hand, the difference between the onset for oxidation and reduction process leads to an estimated electrochemical band gap of ∼1.80 eV, consistent with the optical band gap.

The optimized geometry of compound 1 reveals a planar conformation of the conjugated backbone with a small dihedral twist angle (∼15°) around the central thiophene–thiophene single bond.

Fig. 3 shows the molecular orbital diagram of compound 1. The computed energy levels (HOMO = −4.77 eV, LUMO = −2.60 eV) are considerably lower than experimental data, but it should be underlined that solvent effects are neglected in calculations. The molecular orbitals reveal that the HOMO extends over the entire π-system, while the LUMO is rather localized at the median core with small coefficients at the donating DTP end groups.

The potentialities of compound 1 as donor material in photovoltaic devices have been evaluated on solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on spun-cast films of compound 1 with the [6,6]phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as electron acceptor. A cursory study of the effect of the donor/acceptor ratio showed that the most efficient devices were based on blends deposited from a chlorobenzene solution with 1:1 donor/PC61BM weight ratio and a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1. The active films of ca. 10 nm thickness were spun-cast on ITO electrodes pre-coated with 40 nm of PEDOT:PSS and the devices were then completed by vacuum deposition of a 100 nm aluminum electrode. Fig. 4 shows the current density vs. voltage (J–V) curves recorded in the dark and under simulated solar illumination under AM 1.5 conditions.

Under simulated solar illumination the cell delivers a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.80 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage Voc of 0.77 V which combined with a filling factor (FF) of 0.25 results in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.60%. After 20 min thermal annealing at 100 °C, Jsc increased to 3.16 mA cm−2, while Voc and FF reached 0.75 V and 33% respectively, leading to a PCE of 0.88%. The morphology of the films was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 5, the spun-cast films show interpenetrating domains of submicronic size. A 20 minute thermal annealing at 100 °C leads to the formation of larger domains with an increase of the surface rugosity from 1.0 to 2.9 nm.

Although the fabrication of the devices has not been optimized, the relatively low value of the filling factor suggests that insufficient hole mobility may play a role in the limited conversion efficiency of the cells. In order to gain more information on this point, the hole mobility of thin films of compound 1 has been evaluated using the space-charge-limited-current method. To this end, hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1/Au have been fabricated by spin-casting films of compound 1 from chloroform solutions. The obtained value of 1.12 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 confirms the limited charge transport properties of this donor material.
Conclusion
A symmetrical donor–acceptor–donor D–A–D system built around a new type of electron acceptor block obtained by dimerization of 3-alkoxy-4-cyano-thiophene has been synthesized and characterized. The compound combines a high photoluminescence emission quantum yield in solution with a low band gap and broad absorption spectrum in the solid state. Cyclic voltammetry shows that the compound can be reversibly oxidized and reduced into stable dicationic and dianionic states, with HOMO and LUMO levels compatible with photo-induced charge-transfer to PC61BM as electron acceptor.
A preliminary evaluation of the potentialities of the new D–A–D compound as donor in bulk heterojunction solar cells gave a conversion efficiency of ∼0.90%. The fact that this modest efficiency is essentially due to a low filling factor suggests that the limited hole mobility can represent an important limitation to the cells performances. This point should be taken into consideration for future design of active materials based on this new electron acceptor building block.
