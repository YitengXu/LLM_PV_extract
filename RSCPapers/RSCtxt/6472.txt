    , Accepted 21st May 2012First published on 25th May 2012AbstractThis paper reports the preparation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films through the gel formation of rGO with liquid polyethylene glycol (PEG) of low molecular weight and the application of the rGO films as the platinum (Pt)-free counter electrode of highly efficient iodide/triiodide dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). rGO prepared through the reduction of graphene oxide can form physical gels with PEG by mechanical grinding. The rGO sheets form 3-dimensional solid networks in the gels. The rGO–PEG gels are processed into rGO films on substrates with good adhesion by doctor blade and subsequent removal of PEG through heating. The rGO films can effectively catalyze the electrochemical reduction of triiodide and are used as the counter electrode of iodide/triiodide DSCs. The optimal photovoltaic efficiency of DSCs with the rGO counter electrode is 7.19% under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), which is only slightly lower than that (7.76%) of control DSCs with Pt prepared by pyrolysis as the counter electrode. This is the highest photovoltaic efficiency observed on the DSCs with iodide/triiodide as the redox couple and graphene as the counter electrode. The rGO films exhibit better stability in catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of triiodide and give rise to better aging stability of DSCs than Pt prepared by pyrolysis. The photovoltaic efficiency of DSCs is strongly dependent on the thickness of the rGO film, and the optimal rGO film thickness is 15 μm. The photovoltaic performance of DSCs is also affected by the method to prepare the rGO–PEG gels. The photovoltaic efficiency is only 6.15% or lower when the rGO–PEG gels are prepared by ultrasonication rather than mechanical grinding. This is attributed to the different morphologies of the rGO films achieved by different methods.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been attracting considerable attention owing to the low fabrication cost and decent light-to-electricity conversion efficiency.1–3 They are regarded as the next-generation solar cells. A DSC is usually consisted of a photoanode, a counter electrode and electrolyte between them. Iodide/triiodide are usually used as the redox couple in the electrolyte.4,5 One important step during the light-to-electricity conversion is the reduction of triiodide into iodide on the counter electrode, I3− + 2e → 3I−. It requires the counter electrode to be highly conductive for the electron transport and highly catalytic for the electrochemical reduction of triiodide. Conventionally, platinum (Pt) is used as the counter electrode of DSCs.6 However, Pt as a noble metal is quite expensive, and it degrades over time in the electrolyte consisting of iodide/triiodide.7,8 Thus, it is important to develop other materials to replace Pt as the counter electrode of DSCs. Several Pt-free materials have been reported as the counter electrode of DSCs, such as carbon black,9,10 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),11–13 conducting polymers,14 graphene,8,15–19 and composites.20–23 Graphene is promising as a substitute for Pt owing to its good conductivity and high specific surface area.24–26 In addition, it is cheap. Iodide/triiodide DSCs with graphene as the counter electrode have been reported, but the photon conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are not high. Kavan et al. dispersed commercial graphene nanoplatelets consisting of several sheets of graphene into 2-propanol by sonication and fabricated graphene nanoplatelet films on fluoride doped tin oxide (FTO) glass sheets by drop casting.17 They observed a PCE of 5% with the DSCs under one sun illumination. Roy-Mayhew et al. dispersed reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through the thermal reduction of graphene oxide (GO) in aqueous solution of poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide) triblock copolymer and polyethylene oxide and then prepared rGO as the counter electrode of DSCs by spin coating and subsequent decomposition of the polymers.18 The optimal PCE was 4.99%. Yen et al. prepared rGO by chemically reducing GO with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and made pastes by dispersing rGO, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and XC-72 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) by ultrasonication.19 The rGO films were prepared on FTO glass by solvent casting and drying in vacuum at 120 °C overnight. They observed a PCE of 2.89% for DSCs. Zhu et al. prepared rGO on FTO by the electrophoretic deposition and used it as the counter electrode of DSCs. The optimal PCE was 3.63%.8
It has been realized that the defects and the oxygen-containing groups of graphene actively take part in the electrocatalysis. However, the defects and oxygen-containing groups can reduce the electrical conductivity of graphene, because they damage the conjugated π structure. Thus, the electrocatalytic activity of graphene strongly depends on its quality and morphology. There is an optimal morphology at which the rGO films have good conductivity and high specific area for the catalysis. In addition, surfactants or binders may be used in processing graphene. But the presence of these inert materials in the final graphene films can lower the conductivity and the catalytic activity. Thus, it is important to develop effective methods to prepare binder-free graphene films. The solution processing method starting from the cheap graphite has been considered as the cost-effective way to fabricate graphene films on large scale.27,28 This method includes the oxidization of graphite into GO, reduction of GO to rGO and processing rGO into rGO films. GO can be reduced thermally at temperature over 1000 °C or with a reducing agent like hydrazine,29–31 hydroquinone,32 NaBH4,33 HI,34 KOH/NaOH,35,36 alcohols,37 Fe,38 or Al.39 Recently, we reported the rapid reduction of GO with Zn powder under ultrasonication.40,41 The rGO prepared by this method has high quality with a conductivity of 150 S cm−1 and carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 33.5.
In this paper, we report gel formation of rGO, which was prepared by the chemical reduction of GO with Zn powder, with liquid polyethylene glycol (PEG) of low molecular weight and fabrication of rGO films through gel coating and subsequent removal of PEG by heating. These rGO films have good adhesion to substrates, and they can effectively catalyze the electrochemical reduction of triiodide. They are used as the counter electrode of DSCs. The optimal PCE of DSCs is 7.19% under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), which is only slightly lower than that (7.76%) of the control DSCs with Pt prepared by pyrolysis as the counter electrode. To the best of our knowledge, this photovoltaic efficiency is the highest for DSCs with iodide/triiodide as the redox couple and graphene as the counter electrode.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Nature graphite flake (purity: 99.8%, ∼325 mesh) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. TiO2 pastes (DSL 18NR-T and WER2-O Reflector) were supplied by Dyesol. cis-Diisothiocyanate-bis (2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719), FTO glass and Surlyn films were obtained from Solaronix. Zn powder was purchased from Riedel-de Haen. All the other chemicals, including PEG (molecular weight ≈ 200 g mol−1), iodine, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, lithium iodide, tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate ((C4H9)4NPF6), guanidinium thiocyanate, 4-tertbutylpyridine, acetonitrile, valeronitrile, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), sodium nitrate, potassium permanganate, sulfuric acid (concentration > 98%), hydrogen peroxide, and chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Preparation of rGO gels and rGO films
rGO was prepared through the chemical reduction of GO with Zn powder under ultrasonication as presented in our previous report.40 rGO–PEG gels were prepared through a process similar to the preparation of CNT–surfactant gels.41 In a typical experiment, rGO (5 mg) was mixed with liquid PEG (2 ml) in an agate mortar. The mixture was mechanically ground for 20 min or ultrasonicated with a Sonics & Materials Vibra-cell VC 505 ultrasonic probe which had an output power of 50 W. It was then centrifuged at 10000 rpm with a Profuge 14D for 20 min to remove the excess PEG.
rGO films were fabricated by gel coating. rGO–PEG gels were coated on FTO glass substrates by doctor blade. They were heated at 200 °C for 5 min. Then, the heating temperature was gradually increase to 450 °C at a rate of 10 °C per min. rGO films were obtained after further heating at 450 °C for 5 min.
2.3. Fabrication of DSCs
The DSCs were fabricated according to literature.4 The anode made of a mesoporous TiO2 layer (12 μm thick Dyesol DSL 18NR-T and 3 μm thick WER2-0 Reflector) was fabricated by doctor blade. The mesoporous TiO2 films were successively sintered at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. They were then soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min, rinsed with water and ethanol and subsequently sintered at 500 °C for 35 min. After being cooled down to 80 °C, the mesoporous TiO2 films were immersed in 0.5 mM N719 dye solution in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (volume ratio: 1:1) for 20 h. The photoanode was assembled with an rGO film on FTO glass with two or three layers of hot-melt Surlyn film (25 μm in thickness for one layer of Surlyn film) between them. The cells were filled with 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodine, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (volume ratio = 85:15).
Control DSCs were fabricated using Pt as the counter electrode. The Pt counter electrode was deposited on FTO glass by pyrolysis of 0.2 M H2PtCl6 ethanol solution at 400 °C for 15 min.
2.4. Characterization of materials and DSCs
The dynamic mechanical properties of the rGO–PEG gels were measured using an Advanced Rheometric Expansion System (ARES) by Rheometric Scientific in the dynamic mode with the cone-to-plate configuration. The cone diameter and cone angle were 2.5 cm and 0.04 rad, respectively. The gap between cone and plate was 0.5 mm. The thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out in air with a 2950 TGA by Du Pont at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The FTIR spectra were acquired using a 3100 FTIR spectrometer by Varian. The SEM images were taken with a Zeiss Supra 40 FE SEM. BET surface area and porosity analyses were performed with an ASAP 2020 physisorption analyzer by Micromeritics. The thicknesses of the films were determined using a P-10 Alpha-Step profiler by Tencor. Resistances of the rGO films were measured by the four-point probe method with a Keithley 2400 source/meter.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and ac impedance spectroscopy were performed with a PGSTAT302N + FRA2 electrochemical system by Autolab. For CV, rGO films or Pt by pyrolysis were used as the working electrode. A Pt foil and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The scan rate was 10 mV s−1. Ac impedance spectroscopy was carried out on symmetric cells with rGO films or Pt as the two electrodes. The frequency range was from 0.1 to 300000 Hz, and the oscillation amplitude was 10 mV. The electrolyte for CV and ac impedance spectroscopy was acetonitrile solution consisted of 5 mM LiI, 0.25 mM I2 and 0.1 M (C4H9)4NPF6.
The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was measured with a computer-programmed Keithley 2400 source/meter under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) by a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which was certified to the JIS C 8912 standard. A circular mask with a diameter of 5.2 mm was placed on each DSC during the photovoltaic tests. DSCs were stored in dark in ambient conditions for the aging tests.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation and characterization of rGO–PEG gels and rGO films
We prepared gels of rGO with PEG. PEG of low molecular weight is used as the fluid, because PEG can be considered as a nonionic surfactant to disperse rGO and its decomposition temperature is low. This method is similar to the gel preparation of other carbon-based materials, including carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers.42–45 Apart from nonionic surfactants, Zhang et al. recently reported the gel formation of rGO with ionic liquids, but that method cannot be used to process rGO into the counter electrode due to the good stability of ionic liquids.46
rGO prepared through the reduction of GO with Zn powder was used for this study. It was mixed with PEG, and the mixture was mechanically ground for 20 min. After the removal of excess PEG from the rGO–PEG mixture by centrifugation, the mixture consisted of 5 mg rGO and 0.5 ml PEG. The weight percentage of rGO was about 1% in the mixture, which was much higher than the rGO concentration dispersed in solvents or solutions of surfactants that is usually less than 0.1%.47
The rGO–PEG mixtures did not flow. They are physical gels as evidenced by the dynamic mechanical measurements (Fig. 1). The storage modulus (G′) values are almost flat in the whole angular frequency range from 0.1 to 100 rad s−1 for both γ = 1% and γ = 10%, and the G′ values are always remarkably higher than the loss modulus (G′′) values. In addition, the G′′ values do not show any relaxation over the whole frequency range. These results indicate that the rGO–PEG mixtures are gels. The dynamic mechanical behavior of rGO–PEG is similar to the gels of CNT–ionic liquids,43 CNT–nonionic surfactants,44 and graphene–ionic liquids.46
 Fig. 1  Dynamic mechanical measurements of rGO–PEG gels at applied strain amplitudes (γ) of 1% and 10%. G′ and G′′ are the storage modulus and loss modulus, respectively. 
There are at least two phases, solid and liquid phases, in physical gels. Various materials have been used for the solid phase, such as polymers, organic molecules, nanotubes and nanorods.42–45,48–50 The solid phase forms three-dimensional networks which hold the liquid phase. Presumably, the rGO sheets form three dimensional solid networks in the rGO–PEG gels, because they are flexible and have a corrugated shape. The rGO sheets are hydrophobic and can interact with the hydrophobic –CH2– units of PEG due to van der Waals forces. The PEG molecules can hold together as the presence of the hydrogen bonds formed between the –OH groups. The solid networks are revealed by the SEM image (Fig. 2a). The SEM image of the rGO–PEG gel is quite different from that of rGO before dispersion in which the rGO sheets agglomerate. These SEM images indicate that mechanical grinding can exfoliate rGO sheets.

PEG in rGO–PEG gels can be removed by heating because the two components have different thermal stabilities in air. As shown in Fig. 3, the decomposition of PEG commences at about 150 °C and completes below 300 °C, while the decomposition of rGO starts at a temperature higher than 500 °C. The slight weight loss of rGO observed at temperatures below 500 °C is attributed to the adsorbed water and the decomposition of some residual oxygen-containing group.51 The weight loss of the rGO–PEG gel exhibits two stages. The first weight loss at temperature below 300 °C is the decomposition of PEG. The decomposition of rGO in the gel starts at a temperature at 470 °C. This decomposition temperature of rGO in the gel is lower than that of pure rGO. This can be attributed to the exfoliation of the rGO sheets in rGO–PEG gels.

rGO films were fabricated on FTO glass by doctor blading of the rGO–PEG gels and subsequent removal of PEG through heating. These rGO films have good adhesion to the FTO substrate. G-rGO is used for rGO fabricated from rGO–PEG gels which was prepared by mechanical grinding.
The chemical structure of the G-rGO films prepared by the gel coating method was studied by FTIR. As shown in Fig. 4, no appreciable change can be observed on the FTIR spectra of original rGO and a G-rGO film prepared by gel coating. The band at 1571 cm−1 is due to CC skeletal vibration of graphene sheet,52 and the broad band from 1000 to 1250 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibrations of the phenolic and carboxylic groups.53 The FTIR bands of PEG cannot be observed on the FTIR spectrum of the G-rGO film, which indicates that PEG was completely removed.

3.2. G-rGO films prepared by gel coating as the counter electrode of DSCs
The G-rGO films prepared by gel coating can effectively catalyze the reduction/oxidation of iodide and triiodide as studied by CV (Fig. 5). Two pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks appear in the potential range from −0.6 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The pair at low potential range is the redox of triiodide/iodide I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−, and the one at high potential range is the redox of iodine/triiodide 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−.5,45 The CV curve of iodide/triiodide on G-rGO is similar to that on Pt. Hence, G-rGO films can effectively catalyze the redox reactions of iodide/triiodide.
 Fig. 5  CVs of I−/I3− with a 15 μm thick G-rGO film and Pt prepared by pyrolysis as the working electrode. 
The electrochemical reduction of triiodide in the low potential range is the regeneration of the redox species on the counter electrode of DSCs. The G-rGO films prepared by gel coating were used as the counter electrode of DSCs. Fig. 6 presents the current density (J)–voltage (V) curve of a DSC with a 15 μm thick G-rGO film as the counter electrode. The J–V curve of a control DSC with Pt prepared by pyrolysis as the counter electrode is also presented for comparison, because Pt deposited by pyrolysis has been regarded as the most effective counter electrode of DSCs.54,55 The photovoltaic performances of these DSCs, including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE, are summarized in Table 1. The DSC with the G-rGO counter electrode exhibits a high PCE of 7.19%, which is quite close to that (7.76%) of the control DSC with the Pt counter electrode. The Voc values of the two DSCs are almost the same, while the former exhibits a FF and Jsc slightly lower than the latter. Two reasons account for the lower FF and Jsc values. One reason is the higher diffusion impedance of the redox species for the G-rGO film than Pt, which lowers the FF value. Another reason is related to the light absorption and scattering by the G-rGO film, which reduces the reflection of the unabsorbed incident light from the counter electrode back to the TiO2 photoanode. In contrast, more unabsorbed incident light can be reflected back by the Pt counter electrode and re-absorbed by the dye.8,11 Consequently, the G-rGO counter electrode gives rise to Jsc slightly lower than the Pt counter electrode.

To the best of our knowledge, the PCE value of 7.19% is the highest for DSCs with iodide/triiodide as the redox couple and graphene as the counter electrode under one sun illumination. The PCE values for iodide/triiodide DSCs with a graphene counter electrode reported in literature are about 5% or lower.8,17–19 Kavan et al. reported PCE of more than 9% for DSCs with graphene as the counter electrode, but Co2+/Co3+ complexes rather than iodide/triiodide were used as the redox couple in their DSCs.56,57 The electrocatalytic effect of graphene on the redox of Co2+/Co3+ complexes is different from that on the redox of iodide/triiodide.
Comparing the photovoltaic performance parameters of our iodide/triiodide DSCs using the graphene counter electrode with those reported in literature, shows that the FF value (0.72) of our DSCs is much higher, and our Voc of 0.78 V is also among the highest, although our Jsc value (12.82 mA cm−2) is similar. The high FF value suggests that our G-rGO films may have a good morphology for ionic diffusion and electron transport. This will be further discussed in this paper.
The electrocatalytic activity of the G-rGO film on the reduction of triiodide was further investigated by ac impedance spectroscopy. The measurements were performed on symmetrical cells with two FTO glass sheets coated with 15 μm thick G-rGO films as the two electrodes. The Nyquist plot is shown in Fig. 7a. Two semicircles were observed. The one in the high frequency range corresponds to the charge transfer between the counter electrode and the electrolyte. Analysis of the Nyquist plot using the equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 7b indicates that the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) is 1.5 Ω cm2, which is even lower than that (2.0 Ω cm2) found with Pt as the electrode. This has been also observed by other labs, and it can be attributed to the high specific surface area of the graphene films.58

The photovoltaic stability is also an important parameter for the practical application of DSCs. Aging tests were performed on the DSCs. The variations of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of a DSC with the G-rGO counter electrode are illustrated in Fig. 8 together with that of a control DSC with a Pt counter electrode. The Voc values of the two DSCs slightly increase and the FF values do not remarkably change over time. The Jsc values decrease with time, while the decrease is more significant for the control DSC with the Pt counter electrode. As a result, the PCE values of the two DSCs slightly increase after one day and then decrease with time. The PCE of the DSC with the G-rGO counter electrode decreases from 7.19% to 7.04% after 4 weeks, that is, a loss of about 2% of its PCE. In contrast, the PCE of the control DSC with the Pt counter electrode decreases from 7.76% to 7.07%, that is, a loss of about 8% of its PCE. Hence, the former DSC has better stability than the latter. Kavan et al. also observed better stability of DSCs with Co complexes as the redox species and a graphene nanoplatelet film as the counter electrode than control DSCs with a Pt counter electrode.56,57 The difference in the stability of the two DSCs is ascribed to the corrosion of Pt in an electrolyte consisting of I−/I3−.7

The stabilities of the G-rGO film prepared by gel coating and Pt prepared by pyrolysis during the electrochemical redox of iodide/triiodide were also investigated by CV. The redox was repeated for 100 cycles. As shown in Fig. 9a, the CV of the 100th cycle is almost the same as that of the 1st cycle for the G-rGO film as the working electrode. This stability is much better than that with Pt prepared by pyrolysis as the working electrode (Fig. 9b). The different stabilities of the two working electrodes on the redox of iodide/triiodide are consistent with the aging results of the corresponding DSCs.

3.3. Effect of G-rGO film thickness
The electrocatalytic activity is sensitive to the thickness of the electrode, when carbon-based materials are used.13,59 DSCs with G-rGO films of different thicknesses were fabricated and tested. The J–V curves of these DSCs are presented in Fig. 10, and the photovoltaic performances of these cells are summarized in Table 2. A DSC with a 20 μm thick G-rGO film as the counter electrode were also fabricated. Its J–V curve almost coincides with that of the DSC with a 10 μm thick G-rGO film. Thus, the J–V curve for the DSC with a 20 μm thick G-rGO film is not presented in Fig. 10, but its photovoltaic performance parameters are also listed in Table 2. Though Jsc and Voc are almost insensitive to the thickness of the G-rGO film, FF increases from 0.67 to 0.72 when the thickness of the G-rGO film is increased from 3 to 15 μm and decreases to 0.71 when the thickness is further increased to 20 μm. The optimal thickness is 15 μm in terms of PCE.

The effect of the G-rGO film thickness on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs is related to the diffusion of iodide and triiodide through the rGO films, the surface area of the rGO films which affects the charge transfer between the electrolyte and the counter electrode, and the resistance of the electron transport through the rGO films to the underlying FTO glass.60 When the thickness of the rGO film increases, the resistance for the charge transfer between the electrolyte and the counter electrode decreases as a result of the increase in the surface area, but both the ionic diffusion impedance to the rGO film and the resistance for the electron transport from the rGO film to the underlying FTO increase. High surface area can increase while high ionic diffusion impedance and high resistance can decrease the FF value of the DSCs. Hence, there is an optimal thickness for the G-rGO film as the counter electrode of DSC.
3.4. Effect of rGO–PEG gel formation methods
Apart from mechanical grinding, rGO–PEG gels were also prepared through the ultrasonication of the mixtures of rGO and PEG for 20 min. The rGO–PEG gels prepared by the two methods were processed into rGO films by gel coating and subsequent removal of PEG by heating, and the rGO films were used as the counter electrode of DSCs. U-rGO is used for rGO deposited from rGO–PEG gels prepared by ultrasonication. The J–V curves of the DSCs with the two types of rGO film are shown in Fig. 11, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The DSC with a U-rGO film as the counter electrode exhibits a PCE of (5.31%), significantly lower than that with a G-rGO film. Though the Voc values of the two DSCs are quite close, the FF (0.55) value of the former are much lower than that (FF = 0.72) of the latter.

In order to understand the different photovoltaic performances of the two DSCs with U-rGO and G-rGO as the counter electrodes, CV was carried out on the redox of iodide/triiodide with a U-rGO film and a G-rGO film as the working electrode (Fig. 12). Though the redox of iodide/triiodide in the high potential range is similar, the redox of triiodide/iodide in the low potential range is saliently different for the two rGO films. When U-rGO is used as the working electrode, the peak currents become lower, and the potential separation between the cathodic and anodic peaks becomes larger.

The conductivities of G-rGO and U-rGO films are 33 and 27 S cm−1, respectively. Thus, the effects of gel formation methods on the photovoltaic performance and the redox of iodide/triiodide can be attributed to the rGO morphology rather than the conductivity. SEM was carried out to investigate the morphology of the U-rGO and G-rGO films (Fig. 13). The surface SEM images suggest that the G-rGO film is much rougher than the U-rGO film. The cross-sectional images are also remarkably different for the two rGO films. The G-rGO film is more porous than the U-rGO film. The pores can facilitate the diffusion of the ions through the rGO films and benefit the photovoltaic performance of DSCs.

The porous structure of the U-rGO and G-rGO films was further studied by BET surface area and porosity analyses. As shown in Fig. 14, the G-rGO film has larger pores than the U-rGO film. This is consistent with the morphological study by SEM. In addition, the surface area of G-rGO and U-rGO film are 256.12 m2 g−1 and 210.3 m2 g−1, respectively. The larger pore size and higher specific surface area of G-rGO account for the higher FF value of the corresponding DSC, in comparison with U-rGO.

The conclusion that the pore size of the rGO films can affect the photovoltaic performance of DSCs is further evidenced by the investigation of U-rGO films with different pore sizes. The pore sizes of U-rGO films were varied by varying the ultrasonication time for the rGO–PEG gel formation. As shown in Fig. 15, the pore size decreases with an increase in the ultrasonication time. Ultrasonication can exfoliate the rGO sheets but also reduce the size of the rGO sheets. Smaller rGO sheets can aggregate more easily during the removal of PEG by heating, which leads to the decrease in the pore size when longer ultrasonication time is applied.

The J–V curves of DSCs with U-rGO films deposited from rGO–PEG gels prepared with different ultrasonication times are presented in Fig. 16. The photovoltaic performances of these DSCs are listed in Table 4. PCE increases with the decrease in the ultrasonication time. In other words, PCE increases when the U-rGO films have larger pores. The major effect of ultrasonication time is on the FF value. These are consistent with the observations on the DSCs with G-rGO and U-rGO as the counter electrode.

The PCEs of the DSCs with U-rGO are remarkably lower than that obtained with G-rGO. This is consistent with the pore size of the rGO films. The pore size of the U-rGO films with ultrasonication time of 1 min is still less than that of G-rGO. We also varied the grinding time for the rGO–PEG gels prepared by mechanical grinding. But the grinding time hardly affects the pore size of the G-rGO films and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding DSCs.
The different photovoltaic performances of the DSCs with G-rGO and U-rGO can also account for the different PCEs of our DSCs and those reported in the literature. The optimal PCE of our iodide/triiodide DSCs with G-rGO is much higher than that reported in the literature, while the PCE of our DSCs with U-rGO is comparable to those of iodide/triiodide DSCs with graphene as the counter electrode reported in the literature.17–19
4. Conclusions
Mechanical grinding can exfoliate rGO sheets in PEG and give rise to the formation of rGO–PET physical gels. The rGO sheets form three-dimensional solid networks in the gels. G-rGO films are fabricated through gel coating of the rGO–PET gels and subsequent removal of PEG by heating. The G-rGO films prepared by gel coating are rough and have good adhesion to FTO. They can effectively catalyze the redox reactions of iodide and triiodide and are used as the counter electrode of DSCs. Iodide/triiodide DSCs with G-rGO films as the counter electrode exhibit high photovoltaic performance. The optimal PCE is 7.19%, which is quite close to that (7.76%) of control DSCs with Pt prepared by pyrolysis as the counter electrode. This photovoltaic efficiency is the highest for iodide/triiodide DSCs with graphene as the counter electrode. The aging stability of DSCs with G-rGO as the counter electrode is even better than that of the control DSCs with Pt as the counter electrode. The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs depends on the thickness of the G-rGO film, and the optimal thickness of the G-rGO film is 15 μm. The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs is also affected by the method used to form the rGO–PET gels. The G-rGO films deposited from rGO–PEG gels prepared by mechanical grinding have higher electrocatalytic activity than U-rGO deposited from rGO–PET gels prepared by ultrasonication. It is attributed to the different morphologies of the G-rGO and U-rGO films.
