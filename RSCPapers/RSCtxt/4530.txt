    , Accepted 30th April 2016First published on 3rd May 2016AbstractThe utilization of two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) nanosheets as a cathode interfacial layer (CIL) in inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) is demonstrated. The device with C3N4 as a CIL exhibited a remarkable improvement in power conversion efficiency, indicating that C3N4 can effectively modify the BHJ/ITO interface to facilitate efficient electron collection. Our results indicate that the solution exfoliated C3N4 is a new and promising electron transport material for solution processed organic optoelectronic devices.
Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention due to their unique mechanical, thermal, optical and electronic properties and their potential application in electronics and optoelectronics,1–3 such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), and polymer solar cells (PSCs).4–9 For example, graphene and its derivatives have been successfully applied in PSCs as the transparent conducting electrodes and interfacial buffer layer materials.10–16 Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4), an analogue of graphene, exhibits a stacking 2D layered structure. Compared to bulk C3N4, the highly anisotropic 2D-nanosheets possessed a high specific surface area, a larger bandgap, improved electron transport ability along the in-plane direction, and an increased lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers owing to the quantum confinement effect.17 Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory have revealed that C3N4 nanosheets exhibited unique electronic and optical properties.18,19 In addition, C3N4 nanosheets can be easily obtained by a solution based ultrasonication method in H2O or iso-propanol (IPA) without the use of any additional organics20,21 and are inexpensive and can be available in large quantities from synthetic sources.
C3N4 was primarily applied in PSCs as an acceptor moiety in combination with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The devices exhibited an open circuit voltage of more than 1 V.22 Recently, C3N4 was applied in PSCs by doping solution-processable C3N4 quantum dots in the active layer, leading to a dramatic efficiency enhancement.23 These studies indicate that C3N4 is an excellent charge transporting material, inspiring us to embed it into PSCs to be a new electron transporting material. In this work, C3N4 nanosheets are introduced into PSCs as cathode interfacial layers (CILs) to modify the ITO electrode in inverted PSCs. An active layer composed of poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo-[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl) thieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-C) as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor was used to fabricate inverted PSCs. The PSCs employing C3N4 CILs exhibited a remarkable enhancement in device performance compared with the control devices without CILs. The devices based on PBDTTT-C:PC71BM have achieved a PCE of 6.40% when C3N4 is employed as the CIL, meaning a 74% increase compared to non-modified devices. Our results suggest that C3N4 is a promising candidate as an electron transport material for efficient PSCs.
Bulk C3N4 was synthesized by pyrolyzation of melamine. The bulk C3N4 shows the typical absorption pattern of an organic semiconductor with a strongly expressed bandgap adsorption at about 450 nm (Fig. S1a†). This is consistent with its light yellow colour, as already reported by other researchers.16 The structure of the C3N4 is further investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Fig. S1b†). The sharp peak at 808 cm−1 corresponds to the breathing mode of the triazine units. Several bands in the range of 1200–1650 cm−1 were found, which correspond to the typical stretching modes of C–N heterocycles. The broad band at 3100–3300 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching modes of secondary and primary amines and their intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions.18,24
The chemical structure of C3N4 was further confirmed by XPS. The C 1s spectra (Fig. S2a†) show two peaks located at 284.6 eV and 288.0 eV. The peak at 288.0 eV is further deconvoluted into two Gaussian–Lorentzian peaks. The peak at 287.7 eV is attributed to the sp2 C atom bonded to N inside the triazine rings, while the peak at 288.3 is assigned to the sp2 C in the triazine ring bonded to the –NH2 group. The peak at 284.6 eV is typically ascribed to graphitic CC bonds. The high resolution N 1s spectra (Fig. S2b†) can also be deconvoluted into two Gaussian–Lorentzian peaks. The dominant peak at 398.4 eV corresponds to the sp2 N atoms involved in the triazine rings (C–NC), while the peak at 400.0 eV is attributed to the bridging N atoms in N–(C)3 or N bonded with hydrogen. The very weak peak at 404.3 eV can be assigned to the charging effects or positive charge localization in heterocycles and the cyano-group.20
Ultra-thin C3N4 nanosheets were prepared via ultrasonication-assisted liquid exfoliation of bulk C3N4. The UV-vis spectroscopy of C3N4 nanosheets in H2O and IPA mixed solution (Fig. S1c†) shows a strong peak at 320 nm.25 The dispersion was highly stable even after being stored for 1 year under ambient conditions. Fig. 1a shows the schematic diagram and the morphology of the exfoliated C3N4 nanosheets on a mica substrate. The lateral size of these sheets ranges from tens to hundreds of nanometers. The thicknesses of these exfoliated nanosheets were approximately 1 nm, as estimated by the AFM cross-sectional profile.

(c) Schematic energy level diagram of the inverted polymer solar cells. 
In order to evaluate the energy level properties of C3N4 as a CIL, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) was used to characterize the surface potential of C3N4 nanosheets. The surface potential of UVO treated ITO and ITO/C3N4 is shown in Fig. 2. The UVO treated ITO showed a dark red color with a potential of −457.78 mV.26 After coating with a layer of C3N4 nanosheets, the sample exhibited a more positive surface potential of 92.85 mV with a light-brown color. In comparison to the reference highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), the work functions (WFs) of bare UVO-treated ITO and ITO/C3N4 were calculated to be 5.04 eV and 4.48 eV, respectively.27 Consequently, the corresponding energy levels of the device architecture can be summarized in Fig. 1c. The reduced WF resulting from the introduced C3N4 layer could effectively lower the contact energy barrier between the ITO cathode and the active layer. In particular, the WF of C3N4 modified ITO is quite close to the LUMO level of the PC71BM, which will facilitate efficient electron extraction from the active layer to the cathode.28 Moreover, the results of water contact angle measurements (Fig. S3†) also imply that the C3N4 interlayer could benefit active layer film formation. The surface of the ITO/C3N4 film turns out to be more hydrophobic than the ITO surface. The improved hydrophobicity can enhance the contact between the CIL and the active layer to facilitate the electron transport.29,30 All the features described above suggest that C3N4 is qualified to act as an electron transport interfacial layer.

The photovoltaic device architecture composed of ITO/C3N4/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag can be seen from Fig. 1a. The C3N4 CIL was spin-coated three times from a 1 mg mL−1 solution to obtain a compact layer. The morphology of ITO and ITO/C3N4 films was measured by AFM, as shown in Fig. S4.† And the thickness of the C3N4 thin film was estimated to be 3 nm. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of devices under illumination are shown in Fig. 3a. The average short circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values deduced from J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the control device without a CIL (W/O) exhibited a PCE of 3.67%. The insertion of a thin C3N4 layer between ITO and PBDTTT-C:PC71BM results in a simultaneous increase in JSC (16.04 mA cm−2vs. 15.01 mA cm−2), VOC (0.70 V vs. 0.58 V), and fill factor (FF) (57% vs. 42%), leading to a pronounced enhancement in PCE (by 74%) to 6.40%. For comparison, the typical device performance of ITO/ZnO (15 nm)/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag with an efficiency value of 6.38% is shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1.†

From Fig. 3a it is observed that the RS of the device employing the C3N4 interlayer is only 7.2 Ω cm2, much smaller than that of the reference device (17.6 Ω cm2), which apparently results in an increased JSC. To further understand the enhancement of JSC, the EQE spectra of the corresponding devices were investigated, as displayed in Fig. 3b. The maximum EQE values of the device with and without the C3N4 interlayer are 72% and 64%, respectively, and the integrated JSC values are 15.14 and 14.65 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in agreement with the values obtained from the J–V characteristics.
Furthermore, the UV-vis spectra of the ITO and ITO/C3N4 thin layers were investigated to illustrate the influence of the C3N4 interlayer on the optical properties of devices. The transmittance spectra of the ITO and ITO/C3N4 films shown in Fig. 3d explained that the deposition of a thin layer of C3N4 did not affect the optical transmittance of ITO. The optical absorption spectra of ITO/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and ITO/C3N4/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM presented in Fig. 3d revealed that applying C3N4 on the ITO had a negligible effect on optical absorption.
The J–V characteristics of inverted PSCs with and without the C3N4 interlayer in the dark are presented in Fig. 3c. It was found that the dark current density of the device with the C3N4 interfacial layer under the reverse bias was much smaller than that of the reference device. The low dark current density observed from the PSCs with the C3N4 interfacial layer indicates that the bimolecular recombination is suppressed by the C3N4 interfacial layer,31 thus providing a high photocurrent.
More importantly, the reduced dark current can also contribute to an increased VOC.32 Under illumination, the device with the C3N4 interlayer shows a VOC of 0.70 V, which is higher than that of the control devices (0.58 V). Furthermore, the device with the C3N4 interlayer in the dark exhibits an onset voltage of about 0.70–0.75 V, while it is only 0.55–0.60 V for the control device. These results imply that the built-in potential (Vbi) across the device is indeed enhanced upon utilization of the C3N4 CIL. It should be noted that Vbi can be taken as the upper limit of the attainable VOC in PSCs, and thus the increased Vbi, as well as VOC, could be attributed to the utilization of the C3N4 cathode interlayer.33,34
Furthermore, the increased electric field could also lead to increased JSC and FF via improving charge-transport properties, eliminating the build-up of space charge and reducing recombination loss.32,35 In addition, the enhanced JSC and FF in the inverted PSCs with the C3N4 interfacial layer reflected a smaller RS and a larger RSH than those without the C3N4 interfacial layer. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we have calculated RS and RSH based on the J–V curves shown in Fig. 3a. When a thin layer of C3N4 was employed as the CIL, the RS decreased from 17.6 Ω cm2 to 7.2 Ω cm2 when compared to the unmodified device, indicating that the C3N4 layer promotes more favorable contact at the interface. The RSH also increased significantly from 452.2 Ω cm2 to 854.7 Ω cm2, indicating that charge recombination at the BHJ/cathode interface was suppressed.
The dependence of the device performance on the thickness of C3N4 nanosheets was also investigated by varying spin-coating times, as shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding device characteristics are also summarized in Table 1. The PSCs with a thin layer of C3N4 prepared by double spin-coating deposition exhibit a relatively low PCE of 6.15%. This is possibly due to the incomplete coverage of C3N4 on the ITO surface, leaving a small portion of the uncovered active layer in direct contact with the ITO electrode to create current leakage pathways. With the increase of C3N4 coverage, a champion device with a PCE of 6.40% was obtained. With further increase of the thickness, however, the trend reverses, and the PCE decreases, which we attribute to the bad conductivity in lateral orientation in the C3N4 bulk. As expected, for an extremely thick C3N4 film as the interlayer by dip-coating, the PCE of the devices decreases dramatically suffering from losses of JSC and FF. Consequently, we concluded that an appropriate thickness of the C3N4-based CIL is about 3 nm obtained by three times spin-coating, which is similar to those of graphene oxide-based charge transport layers.10,36 Besides, PTB7 as the donor material instead of PBDTTT-C was also investigated by taking C3N4 nanosheets as the cathode interlayer (Fig. S6 and Table S2†). The same trends were observed which clearly indicate that C3N4 nanosheets are a very promising candidate for the electron transport material in PSCs.

Conclusion
In conclusion, solution exfoliated C3N4 nanosheets are utilized as an efficient CIL in inverted PSCs for the first time, leading to a pronounced enhancement of the device performance. The devices based on PBDTTT-C:PC71BM have achieved a PCE of 6.40% when C3N4 is employed as the CIL, meaning a 74% increase compared to non-modified devices. A thin film of C3N4 on ITO substrates can effectively lower the work function of ITO, which is favourable for electron transport and can prohibit charge recombination near the cathode. The results imply that the solution exfoliated C3N4 is competitive as a new class of electron transporting materials in PSCs as well as in other optoelectronic devices.
