    , Accepted 7th July 2017First published on 10th July 2017AbstractTwo new small molecule donors, namely ICT4 and ICT6 with D1–A–D2–A–D1 architecture having 2,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (EHDTP, D1) and 4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (OBDT, D2) as the terminal and central donor, and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT for ICT4) and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (F2BT for ICT6) as the acceptor (A) moieties, are synthesized and their optical, electronic and photovoltaic properties are investigated. Both ICT4 and ICT6 have considerable solubility in various solvents and possess efficient light absorption ability [ε (×105 mol−1 cm−1) is 0.99 and 1.06, respectively for ICT4 and ICT6] and appropriate frontier molecular orbital energy offsets with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJSCs) are fabricated using ICT4/ICT6 and PC71BM as donors and acceptors, respectively and BHJSCs with two-step annealed (thermal followed by solvent vapor annealing) active layers of ICT4 and ICT6 show overall power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.46% and 7.91%, respectively. The superior photovoltaic performance of the ICT6 based BHJSCs is due to the favourable morphology with a nanoscale interpenetrating network in the ICT6:PC71BM active layer induced by the fluorine atoms on the BT acceptor, which significantly enhances the dissociation of excitons, charge transport and the charge collection efficiency, and suppresses bimolecular recombination in the BHJ. The observed higher PCE of 7.91% indicates that ICT6 is one of the best BT based donor material for small molecular BHJSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, organic bulk heterojunction solar cells (OBHJSCs) have been attracting immense interest from both industry and academia. Even though the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reported for OBHJSCs are quite low compared to conventional silicon solar cells, the former are advantageous in terms of their low production cost and simple fabrication procedures.1–3 Generally, the BHJ layer is a blend of electron donating organic semiconductors (polymers or small molecules) and electron accepting fullerene derivatives. For OBHJSCs with polymer donor materials, PCEs have been enhanced from below 1% to over 10% for single4–7 and 12% for multi-junction structures8,9 by optimizing the donor material’s molecular structure, the BHJ morphology and the device structure. However, the intrinsic polydispersity associated with polymer donor materials due to batch-to-batch variation in their synthesis and difficulties in their purification and optimization of their electronic properties favor the development of small molecule donor materials. Superior characteristics like simple synthesis, characterization and purification procedures associated with small molecule donor materials make them advantageous over their polymer counterparts.10,11 A broader optical absorption for better exciton generation, suitable energy level offsets with a fullerene acceptor for efficient dissociation of excitons and extended π-electron delocalization and a planar backbone for high charge mobility are important for donor materials to obtain high PCEs.10–14 Recently, PCEs over 10% have been reported for OBHJSCs with small molecule donor materials.12–14 However, PCEs have to be improved further for commercial applications. Several new findings have emerged in the search for efficient donor/acceptor materials for OBHJSCs.15–22 The PCE of an OBHJSC can be enhanced by improving the magnitudes of the short circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of the devices. Generally, the JSC of an OBHJSC can be increased by exploiting donor materials with efficient light harvesting capacity and VOC can be improved by lowering their HOMO energy to reduce the exciton recombination.23,24
From our recent findings, we observed that incorporation of a dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) donor moiety can impart intense visible and NIR absorption to donor materials.25,26 Moreover, recent reports revealed that attachment of fluorine atoms to the molecular backbone of donor materials can lower their HOMO energy and thereby improve the VOC of OBHJSCs, and also fluorine atoms at an appropriate location in the donor materials can improve the JSC and FF of the devices.27–30 Extensive studies have been carried out to comprehend the influence of fluorination on the photovoltaic properties of benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) based polymer donor materials.21–42 However, efforts to demonstrate the importance of fluorination to obtain efficient BT based small molecule donor materials are relatively low.43–49
Considering all the factors mentioned above, we have synthesized two new small molecule donors, ICT4 and ICT6 with subtle variations in their structure. The synthesized donor materials have a D1–A–D2–A–D1 linear architecture containing a 2,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (EHDTP) terminal donor (D1), and BT with different extents of fluorine substitution (BT for ICT4 and F2BT for ICT6) and 4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (OBDT) as the acceptor (A) and central donor (D2) moieties, respectively. We chose OBDT as the central donor owing to its excellent properties. With a flat and three ring fused structure, BDT can trigger efficient intermolecular interactions among the donor molecules in their thin films and thereby enhance the charge carrier dynamics in the BHJ.13,14,50–53 BTs with different degrees of fluorine substitution are selected as acceptor moieties to explore the effects of fluorine atoms on the BT acceptor moieties of the synthesized EHDTP end-capped donor molecules on their thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. Excellent thermal stability, efficient light harvesting ability of ICT4 and ICT6 and their appropriate frontier molecular orbital energy levels compared to [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) portray them as suitable donors for BHJSCs employing a PC71BM acceptor. A detailed structural analysis of the donor materials in BHJ thin films has been carried out using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope analyses to understand how the morphology of the BHJ changes with fluorine atom substitution. Also, the influence of fluorine atom substitution on various photovoltaic parameters of the BHJSCs is explained in detail. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the influence of fluorine substitution on the optical, electronic and photovoltaic properties of BT-DTP conjugated small molecule donors.

BHJSC device studies
BHJSCs with indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/ICT4 or ICT6:PC71BM/poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl)-alt-(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl) (PFN)/aluminum (Al) architecture are fabricated as follows. First of all, the ITO coated glass substrates are pre-cleaned in an ultrasonicator containing de-ionized water, acetone and iso-propanol, sequentially for 20 minutes each followed by UV/ozone treatment for 1 h to remove organic residues. PEDOT:PSS is layered (thickness of ∼40 nm) on the pre-cleaned ITO coated glass substrate using a spin coater and dried at 120 °C for 20 minutes. On the top of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS, an active layer is spin coated from a blend solution (chloroform solvent) consisting of different weight ratios of donor (ICT4 or ICT6) and PC71BM, keeping its total concentration as 16 mg mL−1. The active layer coated plates are dried at 50 °C for 10 minutes to remove the organic residue. A two-step annealing (TSA) process has been carried out by annealing the active layer coated ITO glass substrates at 120 °C for 10 minutes, followed by cooling to RT and subsequently keeping them for 10 minutes in a Petri dish in a THF containing chamber. A layer of PFN (thickness of ∼5 nm) is spin coated onto the active layer from its methanol solution. Finally, an aluminum (Al) electrode is deposited using the thermal evaporation technique under a vacuum of 1 × 10−6 Torr. The shadow mask method is used to define the effective area of the fabricated devices, which is about 16 mm2. The devices are characterized at ambient conditions under AM1.5 G stimulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon lamp based solar simulator. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices are measured on a Keithley source meter unit controlled by a PC. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) characteristics of the fabricated devices is studied under short circuit conditions using a Keithley electrometer. The devices are illuminated with a light source and a monochromator and the resulting current is collected using the electrometer unit.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The structures of ICT4 and ICT6 are presented in Fig. S1, ESI† and the scheme for their synthesis is provided in Scheme 1. ICT4 and ICT6 are obtained from their corresponding mono-bromo derivatives (9 and 10, respectively for ICT4 and ICT6) by reacting with distannyl intermediate 4 using the Stille coupling protocol. Mono-bromo intermediates 9 and 10 are obtained from their corresponding dibromobenzothiadiazole precursors (BrBT for ICT4 and BrF2BT for ICT6) by reacting with stannyl DTP derivative 8, which is obtained by reacting 7 with trimethyltin chloride and n-BuLi. Intermediate 7 is synthesized by reacting 6 with n-BuLi and 2-ethylhexyl bromide. Intermediates 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are synthesized as per our previous procedures.25 Dibromobenzothiadiazole precursors (BrBT and BrF2BT) are synthesized as per the procedures available in the literature.39,49 Both ICT4 and ICT6 have fair solubility in various organic solvents (>25 mg mL−1). However, the solubility of ICT6 having four fluorine atoms is lower than that of ICT4.

To evaluate the thermal characteristics of ICT4 and ICT6, thermogravimetry (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses are performed and the obtained results are presented in Fig. 1 (Fig. 1a and b correspond to TGA and DSC analyses, respectively) and Table 1. Elevated decomposition temperatures (Td) of ICT4 and ICT6 obtained from TGA, confirm their superior thermal stability (Fig. 1a and Table 1). Similar Td values of ICT4 (342 °C) and ICT6 (344 °C) indicate that fluorination of the BT acceptor unit has minimal impact on their thermal degradation. Both ICT4 and ICT6 display glass transition temperatures (124 and 119 °C, respectively for ICT4 and ICT6) during the second heating cycle of their DSC analysis (Fig. 1b). Such a phase transition can induce significant changes in their morphology upon thermal or solvent vapor annealing processes during device fabrication.54 The melting (Tm) and crystallization (Tc) temperatures of ICT4 and ICT6 are also estimated from DSC analysis (Fig. 1b and Table 1). Contrary to the thermal degradation, the number of fluorine atoms has a significant impact on their Tm and Tc values. ICT4 shows clear melting (Tm) and crystallization (Tc) thermograms at 260 and 249 °C, respectively. However, ICT6 with four fluorine atoms does not show any melting or crystallization behavior in the operated temperature range, indicating its higher melting and crystallization temperatures.

Observed higher Tm and Tc values could be due to strong intermolecular interactions associated with the fluorine atom substituted donor material ICT6.55,56 The high Td and Tm values of ICT4 and ICT6 reveal their suitability for application even at elevated temperatures.
Photo-physical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of ICT4 and ICT6 in solution and thin films are presented in Fig. 2 and the relevant data is given in Table 2. In chloroform solution, ICT4 and ICT6 display absorption bands in two distinct regions, i.e. 300–450 nm and 450–700 nm, respectively. Compared to ICT4, a longer wavelength absorption band of ICT6 is faintly blue shifted and a concomitant increase in molar extinction coefficient (ε) is observed (Fig. 2). Enhancement in ε of ICT6 could be due to improvement in its molecular backbone planarity.57,58 The absorption bands of ICT4 and ICT6 are red shifted in their thin film state with a new vibronic shoulder peak at longer wavelength regions (Fig. 2), indicating the strong intermolecular interactions due to π-stacking and efficient intermolecular packing between the molecular backbones.46,47 The onset of thin film absorption spectra is used to estimate the optical band gap of ICT4 and ICT6. To estimate the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energies of ICT4 and ICT6, we have measured their electrochemical properties using cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. Cyclic voltammograms representing the reduction behavior of ICT4 and ICT6 are given in Fig. S8, ESI† and relevant data is provided in Table 2. Compared to ICT4, ICT6 shows decreased reduction potential and it could be due to the strong electron accepting tendency of fluorine (Fig. S8a, ESI† and Table 2). The LUMO energy of ICT4 and ICT6 is measured using their onset reduction potential obtained from CV analysis (Table 2) and their HOMO energy is calculated using EHOMO = ELUMO + Eoptg [Eoptg is the optical band gap, measured from the intersection wavelength of the donor material’s solution state absorption and emission spectra (Fig. S9, ESI†)]. Introduction of fluorine atoms significantly lowers the HOMO energy of ICT6 (Table 2). Since the VOC of BHJSC depends on the energy difference between the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO, the observed deep-lying HOMO energy of ICT6 can bestow high VOC for the corresponding BHJSCs. The frontier molecular orbital energy levels of ICT4 and ICT6 are well aligned with the HOMO (−6.1 eV) and LUMO (−4.3 eV) energies of PC71BM (Fig. S10, ESI†). This indicates the applicability of ICT4 and ICT6 as donors for BHJSCs with the PC71BM acceptor. The higher magnitude energy gap between the LUMO of ICT4/ICT6 and PC71BM over the threshold value (0.3 eV) reported for effective dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers indicates efficient exciton dissociation at ICT4/ICT6 and PC71BM junctions.59

To understand the photo-induced charge transfer characteristics between ICT4/ICT6 and PC71BM, the photoluminescence (PL) of pure donor materials and their blend films with PC71BM is measured by exciting at 580 nm (Fig. S8b, ESI†). As presented in Fig. S8b, ESI,† a blend film of ICT6/PC71BM demonstrates about 92% PL quenching in comparison with the PL spectrum of pristine ICT6, which is higher than that of ICT4:PC71BM blend film (83%). These results indicate that pronounced photo-induced charge transfer can occur between ICT6 and PC71BM compared to ICT4 and PC71BM, which indicates that ICT6 is a more suitable small molecule donor for the PC71BM acceptor for application in BHJSCs.
Theoretical studies
Theoretical studies were performed using the Gaussian 09 package (B3LYP functional along with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for DFT and M06-2X functional and 6-311G(d,p) basis set for TD-DFT) and the detailed procedures are described in our previous report.25 Various conformations of ICT4 and ICT6 were optimized and the conformer with lowest energy was used for the theoretical calculations (Fig. S11, ESI†). The optimized structures of ICT4 and ICT6 are presented in Fig. S12, ESI.† Both ICT4 and ICT6 are almost planar with zero dipole moment. The dihedral angle between OBDT and the outer BT-EHDTP or F2BT-EHDTP molecular planes is in the range of 0.06–4.54° and 0.09–2.51° for ICT4 and ICT6, respectively indicating high planarity of ICT6. High planarity generally improves intramolecular electron delocalization and enhances the molar extinction coefficient of the electronic transition and it is well supported by the observed high ε values of ICT6 over ICT4 (Fig. 2). The calculated HOMO (H) and LUMO (L) energies, allowed vertical electronic excitation and optical band gaps using the M06-2X functional are given in Table S1, ESI.† The first excitation clearly shows a strong single-configuration nature (H to L) with a moderate secondary one (H−1 to L+1). The isosurface plots (isovalue 0.02) of the H−1, H, L and L+1 orbitals of the ICT4 and ICT6 are illustrated in Fig. 3. For both ICT4 and ICT6, the HOMO is extended over all the fragments of the donor molecules and the LUMO is distributed over the BT-OBDT-BT (ICT4), and F2BT-OBDT-F2BDT (ICT6) moieties, indicating intramolecular charge transfer from the EHDTP moiety to the BT or F2BT moieties. However, H−1 and L+1 do not exhibit significant contributions from the OBDT moieties, but are rather localized mainly towards the EHDTP and BT or F2BT moieties.

The absorption spectra simulated by TD-DFT of ICT4 and ICT6 using M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) in chloroform solvent are given in Fig. S13, ESI.† GaussSum 3.0 software is used to convolute the Gaussian function to produce spectra with a FWHM value of 3000 cm−1. The calculated spectra are in line with those obtained experimentally. Though, the absorption maxima values are slightly underestimated by about 40 nm using the M06-2X functional. Excitation wavelengths corresponding to the strongest oscillator strengths observed for these band values are given in Table S1, ESI.†
Photovoltaic properties
BHJSCs with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ICT4 or ICT6:PC71BM/PFN/Al are fabricated and characterized under AM1.5 solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). PFN is employed as a cathode interface to improve the photovoltaic performance of the devices. First of all, we have optimized the donor to acceptor weight ratio (1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5) in chloroform solution and the best photovoltaic performance is achieved with a 1:2 D/A weight ratio. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized devices and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are provided in Fig. 4a and Table 3, respectively. Without any treatment, the BHJSC with the ICT4 donor shows only a PCE of 2.70% with a JSC of 7.82 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.96 V and FF of 0.36. Under the same conditions, the BHJSC with ICT6 shows a PCE of 3.84% with a JSC of 9.24 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.04 V and FF of 0.40. Higher VOC values associated with both the devices could be due to the low lying HOMO of the donor materials. Since the VOC values of these devices are significant, the low PCE of these devices is mainly related to their poor JSC and FF values and it could be due to the inappropriate nanoscale morphology of the BHJ. After the two-step annealing process (TSA), the photovoltaic performance of the BHJSCs with ICT4 and ICT6 donors is improved significantly, i.e. 5.46% and 7.91%, respectively. The IPCE spectra of the BHJSCs with active layers processed under different conditions are shown in Fig. 4b. The IPCE values for BHJSCs with the TSA treated active layer are significantly higher over their as cast counterparts contributing to the increase in their JSC values. J–V characteristics (Fig. 4a) reveal that BHJSCs with the active layer containing the ICT6 donor processed under TSA conditions have superior VOC, JSC and FF values (JSC = 12.23 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.98 V and FF = 0.66) over the devices with an ICT4 active layer (JSC = 10.52 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.91 V and FF = 0.57). As ICT6 has a deeper HOMO level than ICT4, a higher VOC for the devices with ICT6 is expected. To understand the rationale for the higher photovolatic efficiency of the ICT6 based devices, we have carried out further investigations including the IPCE response, charge transport and morphology of the BHJ thin films. The IPCE spectra of the BHJSCs with ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM BHJ are presented in Fig. 4b. Both the devices show a wide response ranging from 350 to 750 nm. However, the device with an ICT6 active layer shows a higher IPCE maximum value (67%) over the device with an ICT4 active layer (54%) and it could be responsible for the higher JSC value observed for the ICT6 based devices. The JSC values calculated from the integration of the IPCE spectra are 10.41 mA cm−2 and 12.13 mA cm−2, respectively for ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM based devices and closely resemble the values obtained from J–V characteristics (Table 3).

The hole and electron mobility of the blend films are evaluated by measuring the J–V characteristics of hole only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ICT4 or ICT6:PC71BM/Au) and electron only (ITO/Al/ICT4 or ICT6:PC71BM/Al) devices, in the dark, employing the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. 5). Devices with as cast ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM active layers show a hole mobility (μh) of 1.16 × 10−5 and 4.53 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively in the donor phase, while the corresponding electron mobility (μe) in the acceptor phase is 2.45 × 10−4 and 2.52 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The pronounced difference between μh and μe indicates that hole and electron transports are not balanced in the as cast devices. Upon TSA treatment, the hole mobility (μh) in the donor phase is increased (9.56 × 10−5 and 1.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively for ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM active layers). However, decrement in the electron mobility is observed (2.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM active layers) leading to more balanced charge transport. The blend film of the ICT6 based active layers (both as cast and TSA treated) has higher hole mobilities than the ICT4 counterpart. This property leads to better charge extraction and hence to higher JSC and FF of the BHJSCs.25 The higher IPCE and JSC values of the ICT6 based device compared to ICT4 are attributed to rapid exciton dissociation in the blended active layer as confirmed by the PL spectra (Fig. S8b, ESI†) and efficient charge transport as evidenced by the hole mobility. These results suggest that substitution of fluorine atoms onto the BT units of the donor molecule can enhance intermolecular charge transport in the BHJ active layer.
 Fig. 5  
J–V characteristics in the dark for hole-only devices with active layers processed under different conditions. 
Further, the improved performance of the BHJSCs with the ICT6 donor and its significant difference from the ICT4 counterparts is supported by the photocurrent density (Jph, Jph = JL − JD, where JD and JL are the current densities in dark and under illumination, respectively) and effective voltage (Veff, Veff = Vo − Vapp, where Vo is the voltage at zero Jph and Vapp is the voltage applied) characteristics. The plots of Jphvs. Veff for the BHJSCs are presented in Fig. 6. In the case of the ICT6 based devices, at low values of Veff, Jph has nearly linear dependence on voltage and Jph starts to reach saturation at Veff around 0.64 V and fully saturated at Veff = 2.4 V. This indicates that photogenerated excitons are effectively dissociated and the generated free charge carriers are efficiently collected at electrodes with minute germinate or bimolecular recombination. But, for the ICT4 based device, Jph has greater field dependence over a larger bias range and Jph is not saturated fully even at Veff = 2.4 V, indicating considerable germinate and/or bimolecular recombination and poor extraction/collection of charge carriers at the electrodes. Efficient charge dissociation and effective charge collection at the electrodes could improve the FF values of the BHJSCs with ICT6 over their ICT4 counterparts.60,61 The ratio of Jph/Jsat can represent the overall exciton dissociation efficiency.62 The Jph/Jsat ratios for the BHJSCs based on ICT4 and ICT6 measured under short circuit conditions, are 0.86 and 0.93, respectively. The higher Jph/Jsat ratio of the ICT6 based BHJSCs indicates efficient exciton dissociation for the ICT6 based device compared to the device with the ICT4 active layer. At maximal power output conditions, Jph/Jsat is 0.66 and 0.70 for the ICT4 and ICT6 based devices, respectively and it also indicates higher charge collection efficiency and suppressed bimolecular recombination for the ICT6 based BHJSC devices. The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the ICT4 and ICT6 based BHJSCs are calculated from the inverse slope near VOC and JSC of the J–V characteristics of the respective devices under illumination, respectively. Compared to the device with ICT4 (Rs = 12.56 Ω cm2), the device with ICT6 (Rs = 5.34 Ω cm2) shows smaller Rs, indicating a decrease in the hole collection barrier at the anode interfaces induced by the more favorable nanoscale morphology and vertical phase separation as observed in the TEM images. The observed decrease in Rs and increase in Rsh values for the ICT6 based device also reflect the better PCE of ICT6, supporting better charge transport and efficient charge extraction by the electrodes. As we have adopted the same device structure and processing treatment procedure, the observed superiority in the photovoltaic properties of the ICT6 based BHJSCs could be due to its structure driven favorable active layer morphology. For efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, the morphology of the BHJ should be bi-continuous, interpenetrating with large interfacial area and regular nanoscale D/A phase separation (domain size 10–20 nm).63,64 To get information about the morphology of the BHJ, we have performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses on TSA processed ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM active layers. The TEM images of the active layers processed with TSA treatment are presented in Fig. 7. The bright and dark regions in the TEM images correspond to the small molecule donor (ICT4 or ICT6) and PC71BM domains, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, the ICT6:PC71BM blend film exhibits more appropriate nanoscale morphology and phase separation than the ICT4:PC71BM counterpart, leading to more effective charge separation at the D/A interface. This result indicates that the fluorination would induce better compatibility between ICT6 and PC71BM due to the weak interaction from the fluorine atom in the BT unit.65 This favorable nanoscale morphology can facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport and affords higher JSC and FF values in the corresponding BHJSCs. The favorable vertical phase separation and nanoscale morphology observed for the ICT6:PC71BM active layer compared to ICT4:PC71BM may also be related to the decrease in Rs. However, the nanoscale morphology of the as cast active layer is effectively poor (as shown in Fig. S14, ESI†), leading to charge transport and low FF, resulting in a lower overall PCE for the OSC based on the as cast film. The XRD patterns of the TSA treated ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM films are presented in Fig. 8 and the XRD patterns of the as cast blend films based on ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM are also shown in Fig. S15, ESI.† The as cast active layer film showed a broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.96° and 5.14° corresponding to (100) d-spacing. The broad diffraction peak indicates that the as cast films exhibit poor crystallinity. However, after TSA treatment, the intensity of the diffraction peak of the active layer films is increased considerably, indicating that the crystallinity of the active layer increased. The TSA treated active layer thin films show a diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.96° and 5.14°, corresponding to the inter-chain separation (d-spacing) of 1.56 nm and 1.45 nm, respectively for ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM and it could be originated from the small crystalline domains of ICT4 and ICT6.66 Although both the small molecules possess the same side chains, the intensity of the (100) diffraction peak of ICT6 is higher with shorter d-spacing value compared to ICT4.67,68 This indicates that ICT6 has an improved lamellar stacking structure due to the self assembly induced by the fluorine atoms of the F2BT units during the film formation.58 In both the blend films, a broad scattering at 2θ = 18.62° and a reflection peak at 2θ = 23.26° are observed. The broad scattering band at 2θ = 18.62° could originate from the amorphous PC71BM agglomerate regions and the reflection peak at 2θ = 23.26° corresponds to the (010) reflection of the donor materials.67,68 The coherence lengths for these blend films are estimated from Scherrer's equation and are found to be 4.17 nm and 4.58 nm for ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the intensity of both the (100) and (010) reflection peaks for ICT6 is significantly higher
than that for ICT4 indicating that fluorinated BT in the backbone preferably adopted a face on orientation towards the substrate with high degree of lamellar ordering and π–π stacking. Therefore, we assume that fluorination of the small molecule donor (ICT6) can enhance the inter-chain π–π stacking attributed to the relatively high co-planarity of the molecular backbone induced by the intermolecular interactions. These results indicate that in fluorinated small molecules, the ‘H’ to ‘F’ exchange in the molecule backbone promotes intermolecular interaction and packing and it is presumably because of the lower steric effect of fluorine atoms present in ICT6. The stronger intensity of the (100) peak for ICT6 in the blend film than that for ICT4 indicates that the crystallinity of the former is higher than that of the later. As a result, charge transport is enhanced through the strong π–π stacking interaction, compact π–π stacking and high crystalline nature which are in line with the hole mobility values obtained from SCLC measurements. Hence these results collectively support that fluorine atom substitution on the donor material’s molecular backbone can induce favorable morphology to the BHJ due to the increased inter-chain interaction of the small molecules leading to different molecular packing behavior in the films, thereby enhancing exciton dissociation, charge transport, and the charge collection efficiency, and suppressing bimolecular recombination of the BHJSCs, leading to the higher PCE of the resultant devices.

Conclusion
Two novel, D1–A–D2–A–D1 structured, small molecule donor materials (ICT4 and ICT6) with variations in the number of fluorine atoms on the acceptor moieties (BT for ICT4 and F2BT for ICT6) are synthesized and their effect on the optical, electronic and photovoltaic properties of the donor materials is explored. BHJSCs are fabricated using an ICT4/ICT6 donor and PC71BM acceptor materials. BHJSCs with an ICT6:PC71BM active layer processed with TSA (PCE = 7.91%, JSC = 12.23 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.98 V and FF = 0.66) show a superior photovoltaic performance over the device with an ICT4:PC71BM active layer (PCE = 5.46%, JSC = 10.52 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.91 V and FF = 0.57). Increasing the number of fluorine atoms significantly lowers the HOMO level of the donor material and improves the VOC of BHJSCs. It also enhances the intermolecular interaction among the donor materials in their active layer thin films and results in a better hole mobility (9.56 × 10−5 and 1.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively for ICT4:PC71BM and ICT6:PC71BM active layers) and balanced charge transport. Furthermore, fluorine atoms on the acceptor moiety (F2BT) of ICT6 induce a favorable nanoscale morphology in the ICT6:PC71BM active layer resulting in improved exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge collection efficiency, and reduced bimolecular recombination of the BHJSCs. The reported PCE (7.91%) of the BHJSCs with the ICT6 donor is among the best reported for BT based donor materials.
