Introduction
In the past decade, fullerenes and their derivatives, such as PC61BM or PC71BM, have been the dominant electron-acceptor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs).1,2 However, they suffer from some intrinsic drawbacks, such as weak absorption in the visible spectral region, limited chemical and energy level tunability, high-cost purification and morphological instability.3,4 Therefore, it is highly desired to explore non-fullerene electron acceptors that not only possess the favorable electron-accepting and transporting properties of fullerenes but also overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of fullerenes. Recently, non-fullerene acceptors as potential alternatives to fullerene derivatives have undergone rapid development.5–9 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed BHJ OPVs based on non-fullerene acceptors have been improved from ∼2% in 2012 to above 14% in 2018.10–14
Perylene diimides (PDIs) are among the most investigated molecules in the field of non-fullerene acceptors due to their remarkable electron mobility, high electron affinity,15 high absorption coefficients, and outstanding oxidative/thermal stability.16,17 In chemosynthesis, PDI units are easily functionalized on many positions such as α,18–20 bay and/or imide positions.21 However, large coplanar molecular structures for PDIs have a strong tendency to form microscale aggregates, which strongly impedes the formation of appropriate film morphologies for efficient charge separation and transport, thereby limiting their photovoltaic performance.22–25 To alleviate this problem, various strategies have been developed to reduce the intermolecular interactions and excessive domain sizes.26–28 For example, the common strategy is connecting two or more PDIs at imide29 or bay positions directly30 or with spaces (benzene, thiophene31 and so on). Another strategy is linking PDIs to different central cores (benzene,32,33 pyrazine,34 porphyrin,35 phthalocyine36 and so on). In these strategies, the PDI units are restricted in a limited and crowded space; they could not align in the same plane but form a nonplanar structure, which helps in suppressing the excessive intermolecular interaction and in avoiding the formation of oversized aggregates.37–39 High efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) require that PDI based acceptor molecules could form appropriate nanoscale phase separation when blended with polymer donors. And the blend films should also have high and balanced charge mobilities.40,41 To meet these requirements, PDI based acceptors should have a nonplanar structure to suppress the excessive aggregation, but could form appropriate π–π stacking to facilitate the electron transportation. Precise molecular design is required to meet these requirements.
Bearing these considerations in mind, we designed and synthesized three PDI derivatives (PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV), and their structures are shown in Scheme 1. Their optical, electrochemical, electron transport and photovoltaic properties were investigated in detail. All these acceptor molecules have a central benzene core and the PDI units are linked to the central benzene core by an acetylene spacer. PDI-II is a linear molecule, which bears two flanked PDI units, PDI-III is a c3-symmetrical star-shaped molecule with three peripheral PDI units, and PDI-IV is a star-shaped molecule with four PDI units linked to the 1,2,4,5-positions of the central benzene core. These acceptor molecules can be easily synthesized by Sonogashira coupling reactions. The influences of molecular structures on their optical properties, the morphologies of blend films, the photovoltaic performances of devices were studied in detail. We found that PDI-II and PDI-III exhibited well-resolved absorption spectra and PDI-IV demonstrated a broad absorption band without vibronic structure. These absorption features indicated that the PDI units in PDI-II and PDI-III are planar, whereas the PDI units in PDI-IV are twisted due to the steric crowding. Compared with the linear PDI-II, the star-shape could effectively prevent PDI-III and PDI-IV from forming large aggregates when blended with the donor polymer PBDB-T. PBDB-T:PDI-II, PBDB-T:PDI-III and PBDB-T:PDI-IV based OSCs gave power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.05%, 6.00% and 1.04%, respectively. The big differences in electron mobility and PCE for PDI-III and PDI-IV are probably due to the fact that the PDI units in PDI-III are planar and those in PDI-IV are twisted. Our studies have demonstrated that the performance of OSCs can be markedly improved by fine structural design of the acceptor molecules.

Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV are shown in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was prepared according to a literature procedure.42 Sonogashira coupling of compound 1 and trimethylsilylacetylene (CCTMS) afforded compound 2 in 61% yield.43 The treatment of 2 with potassium carbonate in methanol furnished compound 3 in 65% yield. Sonogashira cross-coupling44 of compound 3 with 1,4-diiodobenzene, 1,3,5-triiodobenzene, and 1,2,4,5-tetraiodobenzene afforded PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV in 76%, 45% and 29% yields, respectively. The chemical structures of these compounds were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and matrix assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). These three compounds are readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature. In the range of 50 to 300 °C, no obvious melting peak or glass transition was observed for these three compounds in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves under a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†).
DFT calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were performed to evaluate the molecular geometries of PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV. The alkyl chains were simplified as methyl groups to facilitate the calculation. The optimized molecular geometries of PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV are shown in Fig. 1, and their HOMOs and LUMOs are presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). For PDI-II, the dihedral angle between the central benzene core and adjacent PDI unit is 2.3°, indicating that PDI-II is only slightly twisted. As for PDI-III and PDI-IV, upon incorporation of more PDI units at the central benzene unit, the dihedral angle is increased to 12.6° and 31.7°, respectively, resulting in twisted geometries. The DFT model indicates that the torsion angles of the PDI units are about 13°, 14°and 16° for PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV, respectively. The PDI structure in PDI-IV is more twisting than those in PDI-II and PDI-III (see the ESI†).

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV in dichloromethane (DCM) solutions and as films are depicted in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, PDI-II and PDI-III in DCM solutions displayed well-resolved absorption spectra ranging from 400 to 600 nm with three peaks located at around 470, 513 and 551 nm, whereas PDI-IV in DCM solutions exhibited a broad featureless absorption ranging from 350 to 650 nm with the absorption maximum at 501 nm. The absorption band with the characteristic vibronic fine structure located at 400 to 600 nm can be attributed to the π–π* transition of the perylene diimide core. The PDI units in PDI-II and PDI-III are not so crowded and could maintain planar conformations; therefore PDI-II and PDI-III in DCM solutions exhibited well-resolved absorption spectra. But for PDI-IV, the vibronic structures disappear in the absorption spectra, which might be attributed to the twisted structures of PDIs resulting from the steric hindrance between the four PDI units linked to the central benzene core in PDI-IV.45 In going from solutions to films, the absorption spectra of all compounds became broader and the absorption maximum slightly red-shifted to approximately 510 nm. From the film absorption onsets, the optical bandgaps (Eg,opt) were calculated to be 2.09, 2.01 and 1.98 eV for PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV, respectively. The related data are also summarized in Table 1.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical behaviors of PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the CV curves are shown in Fig. 3. The onsets of the oxidation and reduction potentials were determined against Fc/Fc+ as the internal standard. Assuming the absolute energy level of Fc/Fc+ to be 0.09 eV below vacuum, the HOMO levels were calculated to be −5.82 eV for PDI-III, −5.79 eV for PDI-II and −5.89 eV for PDI-IV according to the equation: EHOMO = −e[Eox + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)]. The ELUMO values of PDI-III, PDI-II and PDI-IV were calculated to be −3.86 eV, −3.70 eV and −3.80 eV based on the equation: ELUMO = −e[Ere + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)]. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these acceptors are roughly compatible with those of PBDB-T. The HOMO and LUMO energy offsets between these acceptors and PBDB-T are 0.56–0.66 eV and 0.28–0.44 eV, respectively, which are large enough for charge separation and transfer.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV as acceptors, PBDB-T was chosen as the donor and devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al were fabricated. Firstly, the processing solvent, the donor to acceptor weight ratio, and the active layer thickness were systematically optimized. As a result, the optimized conditions are as follows: the active layer is spin-coated from a DCB solution, the donor to acceptor weight ratio is 1:1, and the active layer thickness is 90 nm. Then the influence of additives on the device performance was also studied. We found that the use of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the solvent additive could further improve the device performance. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 4 and the photovoltaic parameters are also given in Table 2. For PBDB-T:PDI-II based devices, a PCE of 2.86% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 6.86 mA cm−2, and an FF of 49.61% was achieved. Using 0.7% CN as the additive, the PCE was further improved to 3.05% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 6.89 mA cm−2, and an FF of 52.30%. The photovoltaic performance of PDI-III was obviously enhanced and the as-cast devices with PBDB-T:PDI-III as the active layer exhibited a PCE of 5.11% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 10.47 mA cm−2 and an FF of 59.06%.

Similarly, the PCE of the devices can be further improved to 6.00% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 11.87 mA cm−2 and an FF of 59.42% after the addition of 0.5% CN as the additive. Compared to PDI-II, the improved Jsc and FF made main contributions to the overall efficiency enhancement of PDI-III based devices. As for PDI-IV, which bears four PDI units at the central benzene core, all the device parameters including Voc, Jsc and FF decreased sharply; the as-cast devices only gave a PCE of 0.82%, which could be improved to 1.04% after the use of 0.7% CN as the additive. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of all devices were measured to verify the accuracy of the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurement. The Jsc values obtained by the integration of EQE spectra are comparable to the Jsc measured in the J–V test.
Transport properties
To shed light on the charge transport properties, hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and electron-only devices with a configuration of FTO/active layer/Al were fabricated. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the devices were estimated from dark J–V curves by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 3, PBDB-T:PDI-II based plain devices exhibited μe and μh of 0.94 × 10−5 and 3.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 3.67. The μe and μh values for PBDB-T:PDI-III based devices were determined to be 4.43 × 10−5 and 9.18 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe of 2.07, indicating that the hole and electron mobilities became more balanced. For PBDB-T:PDI-IV based plain devices, μe and μh are 0.49 × 10−5 and 2.72 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe of 5.55. Apparently, PBDB-T:PDI-IV based devices gave the lowest hole and electron mobilities among these three acceptors. These results indicate that excessive twisting would hurt the charge mobility, which corresponds well with the properties of photovoltaic performance. Higher and more balanced charge mobilities are beneficial to achieving high Jsc and FF values for PBDB-T:PDI-III based devices.

The surface morphologies of the blend films were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using the tapping mode. As shown in Fig. 5a–c, all three blend films exhibited a relatively smooth surface. Compared with PBDB-T:PDI-II, the domain sizes for PBDB-T:PDI-III and PBDB-T:PDI-IV became smaller. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are 1.91, 1.50 and 1.40 nm for PBDB-T:PDI-II, PBDB-T:PDI-III and PBDB-T:PDI-IV, respectively. The morphologies of the blend films were also studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5d, the PBDB-T:PDI-II blend films exhibited a distinct phase separation with larger domain size. For the PBDB-T:PDI-III blend films, the extent of phase separation is decreased and the domain size became smaller (Fig. 5e). More uniform morphologies and much smaller domain size were observed for the PBDB-T:PDI-IV blend films (Fig. 5f). PDI-II, which has a linear conformation, is prone to form larger aggregates. As for PDI-III and PDI-IV, the star-like conformation could increase their solubility.37 Therefore, during the drying of the blend films PDBD-T would first precipitate from the blend solution to form fibril network structures, which could prevent the acceptor molecules from forming large domains, and more uniform morphologies could be obtained.46 Due to the limited diffusion length of excitons, the large domain size of the PBDB-T:PDI-II blend films is apparently harmful to their photovoltaic performance. As for PDI-IV, although the blend films have good morphologies, the twisting of the PDI units could decrease the electron mobility of the blend films, resulting in lower PCEs for the devices.

Conclusions
We designed and synthesized three PDI based acceptors (PDI-II, PDI-III and PDI-IV). All these three acceptors have a central benzene core; PDI-II bears two flanked PDI terminal units, PDI-III bears three PDI units, and PDI-IV bears four PDI units. The influence of molecular structures on their optical properties, the morphologies of blend films, and the photovoltaic performances of devices were investigated in detail. The less crowded PDI-II and PDI-III exhibited well-resolved absorption spectra in solutions and as films, whereas the more crowded PDI-IV could twist the plane of PDI, which resulted in a broad absorption band without the vibronic structure. PBDB-T:PDI-II blend films demonstrated a large scale phase separation, while PBDB-T:PDI-III and PBDB-T:PDI-IV blend films exhibited homogeneous morphologies without large scale phase separation because of their star-shaped structures. Blend films based on less crowded star-shaped PDI-III showed the highest electron mobility among these three acceptors. PDI-IV bearing twisted PDI units showed the lowest electron mobility among these three acceptors. OSCs based on PBDB-T:PDI-III gave the best performance with a PCE of 6.0%, whereas devices based on PDI-II and PDI-IV gave PCEs of 3.05% and 1.04%, respectively. Our studies have illustrated that the molecular conformations have a great influence on their optoelectronic properties and PDI-III could be a promising acceptor for OSCs.
