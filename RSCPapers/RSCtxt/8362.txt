    , Accepted 9th December 2019First published on 9th December 2019AbstractCarbon nanodots (CNDs) are one kind of fluorescent carbon nanomaterials, composed of polyaromatic carbon domains surrounded by amorphous carbon frames, and they have attracted a great deal of attention because of their interesting properties. They are a sort of fluorescent nanomaterial having unique optical properties as compared to other traditional organic fluorophores, which include high photostability and quantum yield. In our present study, CNDs and proflavin (PF) have been used as constituents of a drug delivery carrier, where PF is a very good DNA intercalator. Therefore, we hypothesize that DNA can be used as a sequestering agent for PF from a CND–PF nano-assembly. Amine capped carbon dots with a particle diameter of 80–100 nm are prepared by pyrolysis of citric acid. Probable excited-state interactions like fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), photo-induced electron transfer (PET) etc. between PF and CNDs have been studied using several spectroscopic techniques e.g., steady-state absorption as well as fluorescence spectroscopy and time-correlated-single-photon counting (TCSPC) to measure fluorescence decay kinetics in the nanosecond–picosecond (ns–ps) time regime. The fluorescence intensity of the CNDs has been quenched by PF. After addition of CT DNA the quenched fluorescence intensity of the CNDs has been seen to be recovered. This indicates controlled release of PF into the DNA micro environment by CNDs, which shows their utility as an efficient drug delivery agent. Additionally, we have monitored the partial release of PF from the aforementioned complex into our selected “hydrophobic sink” of different compositions of a water–PEG-400 mixture.
Introduction
Quantum dots (QDs) are particles having nanoscale dimensions resulting in the quantum-confinement effect.1,2 They show this effect as their dimensions are smaller than the exciton Bohr radius.2 The term “quantum dot” in the literature is mostly associated with nanoscale entities exhibiting size-dependent multicolor fluorescence emission. They include the popular graphene quantum dots (GQDs) also.3–8 Carbon QDs (CQDs) have mostly been prepared from various carbon sources such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),9 arc-discharge single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs),10 graphene3–8 and some organic molecular precursors. Zhang et al. reported the design of a novel electrochemical platform by combining the biocompatibility of single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) and the excellent conductivity of graphene (GP).11 In general, carbon dots comprise a core containing sp2 hybridised carbon atoms and surface domains rich in different organic functional groups. Recently emerging CND materials exhibit several advantages like chemical inertness, low toxicity and easy labeling, which have attracted attention among scientists. The many carboxyl moieties on the surface of the CNDs impart excellent solubility in water and biocompatibility.12 Hu et al. have provided a detailed description of the design and fabrication of carbon dots and their application in energy conversion and storage.13 CNDs are also suitable for chemical modification and surface passivation with various organic, polymeric, inorganic or biological materials.
Most of these carbon-based QDs show characteristic broad optical features related to structural and surface or edge defects.8,14,15 CQDs, comprising several carbon based organic moieties,16 generally show broad and unstructured UV-vis absorption spectra arising from π-plasma transitions in carbon nanoparticles. Two characteristic absorption peaks at ∼240 nm (sp2-carbon network) and ∼350 nm (n–π* transitions of surface carbonyl groups) are mostly seen.17 Recently, absorbance beyond 450 nm has also been reported, possibly resulting from different surface states associated with small bandgaps.18,19 Photoluminescence (PL) is one of the most fascinating features of CQDs, both from fundamental and application perspectives. The concept of photoluminescent CNDs was first introduced by Sun et al.20 The authors concluded that the quantum confinement effect, which makes the surface energy traps emissive upon surface passivation, is the primary reason behind the fluorescence enhancement of C-dots.20 The fluorescence mechanism of CNDs and its excitation wavelength dependency have recently been reviewed by Yan et al.21 Now it is believed that two types of mechanisms trigger the intense fluorescence of CNDs, one is based on the band gap transitions in conjugated π-domains, and the other is attributed to surface defects on the CDs.2,22–25 Recent single molecule (particle) investigations have shed new light on the mechanism of CND fluorescence. Khan et al. have reported the single molecule fluorescence blinking of CNDs and suggested Dexter type ET between the fluorescent centers and the surface trap sites to be responsible for the blinking phenomenon.26 In particular, CND fluorescence blinking follows a power law distribution27 similar to that of the blinking of semiconductor QDs,28 which suggests that charge redistribution on the surface of the particles triggers their transitions between emissive and dark states. This assumption has been supported by reports on photo-switching of CNDs via ET between different surface groups of the particles,29 and by fluorescence quenching of CNDs using photoinduced ET between CNDs and electron donor/acceptor molecules in solution.30 Often PL in CNDs has been ascribed to the radiative recombination of radical cations and anions generated via photo-induced charge separation following photoexcitation. These photo-generated charges are trapped at diverse surface defect sites. This surface trapping of charges has already been evidenced to take part in various ET reactions in CNDs.31 According to Krysmann et al. CND fluorescence originates from both the carbogenic core and the surface states.32 Recently Kumbhakar et al. have performed a detailed investigation to show that other than the “general core-state proposition” the presence of weak and strong H-type aggregates is responsible for spectral splitting in molecular chromophores.33 Ding et al. have discussed several factors which cause and control the emission features of red emitting CNDs, which are further controlled by the surface states.34 Zeng et al. reported the development of carbon dots and proposed the surface states associated with carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups as being responsible for radiative transitions in the green waveband originating from CDs according to comprehensive analyses of the spectra, the interior and surface structures, and the correlations between them.35 Yan et al. comprehensively reported an account of the properties of carbon dots (CDs) with amino, carboxy and hydroxy functional groups.36 Some reports ascribed the PL red shift of CNDs to quantum size effects.18 It has been reported that surface defects, created through surface oxidation, serve as capture centers for excitons and in turn give rise to surface-state-related fluorescence.37 It has been a long standing effort to control the optical properties of CNDs. Many researchers have suggested that surface defects from heteroatom doping and functional groups are closely related to the unique optical properties of CDs.
Quenching of CND fluorescence by analytes has often been employed in detecting analytes and bioimaging.38 The quenching mechanism may involve various processes like static quenching, photoinduced electron transfer (PET), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and the inner filter effect (IFE). There have been several reports on fluorescence quenching of CNDs by a number of electron donors and acceptors, as CNDs are capable of both donating and accepting electrons. Cadranel et al. have reported the dynamics of charge separation in pressure synthesized carbon nanodots (pCNDs) with porphyrins as the excited-state electron donor using fs-resolved pump probe spectroscopy.39 The property of ET in CNDs has enormously been used in designing optoelectronic devices like solar cells. Zhang et al. have reported the synthesis and fabrication of N-doped CQDs for TiO2 based catalysts working on the ET principle.40 FRET between CNDs derived from chitosan and nitroaromatic compounds has been reported by Liang et al.41 N, P and S doped CQDs have evidenced FRET with Au NPs.42 While ET in CNDs finds applications in optoelectronic devices, FRET involving CNDs has mostly been used in sensing and bioimaging.
PL in CNDs has been found to be mostly excitation wavelength dependent,21 which is somewhat disadvantageous for using them in FRET related studies to probe several biological phenomena through spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. To overcome this problem preparation of CNDs exhibiting excitation independent fluorescence with high quantum yield is often recommended. There have been continuous efforts to prepare excitation independent fluorescence using CND materials with wide-bandgap crystalline structures and single emitting transitions. Wang et al. have studied different types of synthesis procedure, tunable photophysical properties and several applications of carbon dots.54 Hola et al. have reported the synthesis of different CNDs with specific size and lipophilicity by using different gallate esters with varying alkyl chain length as molecular precursors.13 They have shown evidently different but specific emission maxima for different gallate esters at 402, 427 and 428 nm. Surface passivation is one of the most trusted ways to give CNDs excitation wavelength independent fluorescence. Bera et al. have previously shown that surface passivation with ethylene diamine (EDA) makes CND fluorescence excitation wavelength independent with the additional advantage of enhanced fluorescence quantum yield.31 Amine (–NH2) group functionalization has paved a new route in synthesizing excitation independent fluorescent CNDs.16,43 D'souza et al. have reported the synthesis, properties and drug delivery application of vancomycin derived fluorescent CNDs.44 Apart from CNDs polymeric nanoparticles exhibiting aggregation induced emission (AIE), e.g. tetraphenylethene derivatives, could often be used as drug delivery agents and bio-imaging materials owing to their high photostability and small size. Huang et al. have reported the synthesis of AIE-active CNDs via a one-pot conjugation and their application in biological imaging.45 Liu et al. also reported the synthesis of fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles (FPNs), namely poly (PEG-co-VA) copolymers, via post modification of synthetic polymers, which are AIE active and are also promising agents for cell uptake and cell imaging.46 Wei et al. have summarized the synthetic protocols and properties of AIE active luminescent materials.47 They have reported on the facile self-assembly of AIE-active (F127-TMAC-PhNH2) fluorescent organic nanoparticles and their bio-imaging properties.48 Long et al. reported the fabrication of amphiphilic luminescent polymers via a “one pot” mercaptoacetic acid locking imine (MALI) reaction, in which an aldehyde group containing AIE-active dye (named CHO-An-CHO) was covalently conjugated with NH2-terminated polymers (PEG-PABA).49 Cao et al. reported that a catalyst-free thiol–yne click reaction can be utilized for fabrication of AIE-active FPNs in short reaction time and even without the protection of an inert gas.50 Zhang et al. reported a novel strategy for the fabrication of AIE-based FONs through emulsion polymerization.51 Wei et al. reported the synthesis of β-cyclodextrin containing hyper-branched polymer functionalized nano-dot (ND-β-CD-HPG) composites with high drug-loading capacity and biomedical applications.52 Zhang et al. reported on aggregation-induced emission of fluorescent polymer nanoparticles.53 Apart from organic QDs, the synthesis and properties of inorganic quantum dots have also been extensively studied.54 For example, Li et al. reported the synthesis and enhanced fluorescence properties of aqueous CdSe/ZnS QDs modified with N-alkylated poly(ethyleneimine).55 Chen et al. reported a facile and ultrafast photo-initiated reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization for the fabrication of fluorescence nano-diamond-based polymer composites.56
Application of nanomaterials as drug delivery vehicles is a much visited area in bio-physical research, however the applications are limited by the associated toxicity.57,58 CNDs and differently capped CNDs, being organic in nature, have reduced toxicity relative to other nanomaterials and have been subjected to wide applications in the field of biomedicine e.g. targeted drug delivery etc.16,31,59,60 CNDs are often subjected to various types of studies of binding with different drugs and their subsequent release to different parts of the cell. Bera et al. have developed an important sensing platform for quantifying toxic and carcinogenic quinone derivatives in live HeLa cells that can be used for drug screening by using the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process in Ru doped CNDs.31 Yan et al. have synthesized yellow emissive CNDs which can be used successfully to detect Ag(I) and GSH in H1299 cells by an imaging technique.61
Our present work is an endeavour to study the interactions of proflavin (PF) with amine capped small size CNDs and their possible application as a model drug delivery vehicle. We also investigate the possible sequestration of PF from the PF–CND complex upon addition of DNA. In recent years, acridine and its derivatives have been drawing much attention owing to their immense pharmacological importance. The tricyclic core of acridine derivatives is an important factor affecting fibril depolymerization and nucleation as well as the self-assembly of lysozyme into amyloid aggregates. Moreover the planarity of this molecule might be an important factor enabling its ability to intercalate into DNA, which could result in inhibition of the cell cycle and/or induction of cell death. PF, an important member of the acridine family, can bind with CNDs and quench the emission of CNDs when it is in close proximity to the surface of the CNDs. Such an effect can be exploited in potential application as drug delivery vehicles. All these phenomena have been explored with the help of steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as time-correlated-single-photon counting (TCSPC) based fluorescence kinetic analysis.
Materials and methods
All the chemicals and solvents required for synthesis of the CDs and EDA–CND are of analytical grade. Citric acid (CA) (≥99.5%), ethylene diamine (EDA) (≥99%), proflavin (PF) and poly ethylene glycol-400 (PEG400) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Water has been triply distilled before use. Solutions were prepared by dissolving CT-DNA in Tris–HCl buffer (pH ∼ 7.2). All the solutions of dyes and CT-DNA were prepared in this buffer. CT DNA was taken in an arbitrary amount and dissolved in a fixed volume of buffer. The concentration of DNA in the solution was determined spectrophotometrically. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) for CT-DNA = 6600 cm−1 M−1 per base at 258 nm has been used here. The DNA concentration was varied as per the requirements during the experiment.
Preparation of amine capped carbon nanodots (CNDs)
CNDs were synthesized by pyrolyzing 1.0 g of citric acid with 10 mL of Milli-Q water at 140 °C for 5 hours. During the course of the reaction, when 50–60% water was evaporated from the beakers, 1 mL of water was poured into each beaker at certain intervals to prevent charring. After 5 hours the solution was converted to a yellow gel-like form, which indicates the formation of the CNDs. These samples were immediately lyophilized to obtain a solid powder. 100 mg of CNDs were dissolved in 2 mL of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and 1 mL of ethylenediamine (EDA) and refluxed at 120 °C for 3 hours. The resulting mixture was then cooled and dried to obtain EDA–CND, which was then lyophilized and stored at 4 °C.
Absorption and fluorescence measurements
Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2600 and Fluoromax 3.0 respectively using a 1.0 cm path length quartz cuvette. Time-resolved emission spectra of EDA–CND and PF were recorded using a picosecond pulsed diode laser based TCSPC fluorescence spectrometer using λex = 377 nm and a MCP-PMT as a detector. Emission from the samples was collected at a right angle to the direction of the excitation beam maintaining magic angle polarization (54.7°) with a bandpass of 2 nm. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the instrument response function is ∼150 ps with a resolution of 28 ps per channel. The data were fitted to exponential functions after deconvolution of the instrument response function by an iterative reconvolution technique using data analysis software in which reduced χ2 and weighted residuals serve as parameters for the goodness of fit. All the measurements were performed at 298 K. Fast software has also been used for fitting some of the fluorescence decay transients.
TEM imaging
For TEM images, 400 mL of each sample solution was prepared in water from a stock solution of CND, EDA–CND and PF. The liquid solution was allowed to attach on the grid, air dried and used for imaging. The samples were observed using a transmission electron microscope (FEI model Technie G2 20S).
Results
Characterization of the CNDs and EDA–CND

Fig. 1 presents high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the prepared CNDs (a), EDA–CND (b) and PF (0.01 mM) loaded EDA–CND (c). The diameter of the thus formed CNDs is found to be ∼8 nm (Fig. 1(a)), which is in good agreement with previous literature.31 The EDA capped CNDs form an aggregated structure as evident from Fig. 1(b) with the aggregate dimension being in the range of ∼80–120 nm. The TEM image (Fig. 1(c)) of PF conjugated EDA–CND shows its size on the order of ≥150 nm. We perform atomic force microscopy imaging on the CNDs, EDA–CND and PF conjugated EDA–CND to probe their surface and determine the height of the samples. The height of the samples is found to be 3.9, 5 and 4.7 nm respectively. From the AFM images the size of the particles has been determined as ∼18, ∼80 and ∼148 nm for the CNDs, EDA–CND and PF conjugated EDA–CND respectively, which are in close approximation with those obtained from the TEM measurements. Additionally, we measure the FTIR spectra of EDA–CND and PF loaded EDA–CND (Fig. S6, ESI†). We observe a slight enhancement in the transmittance in the PF loaded EDA–CND compared to EDA–CND at ∼1850–1950, ∼2390 and ∼2550–2650 cm−1.

UV-vis absorption study
We monitor the absorption spectrum of EDA–CND upon gradual addition of PF (Fig. 2a). It is observed that EDA–CND produced a distinct peak at ∼360 nm, which is due to the possible n → π* transitions of acridine like moieties. Apart from the distinct peak at ∼360 nm we observe two additional features at 250 nm and 450 nm; these absorption features emanate due to the probable presence of dopamine and fluorescein type moieties which could be formed during the Michael addition reaction of EDA capping of the CNDs.31,62 The CND peaks suffer only marginal changes as PF is added. This study thus indicates the formation of a relatively weak ground-state complex in buffer between the CNDs and PF.

Steady state fluorescence study

Fig. 2b presents the emission profile of EDA–CND in the presence of PF. EDA–CND, when excited at 320 nm, produces an intense peak at 425 nm. We check the excitation dependent emission characteristic of EDA–CND and found that the emission profile suffers only marginal changes as the excitation wavelength increases from 320 to 460 nm. This finding is quite unique to the EDA–CNDs as they usually exhibit strong excitation independent emission profiles.31 The fluorescence intensity at 425 nm decreases with increasing concentration of PF along with a concomitant enhancement of the PF emission intensity at 505 nm through an iso-emissive point at 465 nm. The emission maximum of EDA–CND shows a blue shift of 10 nm upon addition of PF. We also measure the fluorescence profile at two other pH values: ∼ 5.8 and 7.9; we observe similar trends to that observed in the neutral pH condition (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The observed quenching of EDA–CND emission in the presence of PF could be attributed either to FRET or to ET between PF and EDA–CND. As PF binds to the surface of the CNDs, it replaces otherwise surface-bound water molecules. This eventually decreases the local polarity at the CND surface to some extent and brings about the observed blue shift in the emission maximum.
In order to quantify the PF induced quenching of CND emission we plot the relative change in emission intensity (at the emission peak) against PF concentration and obtained a good linear fit (Fig. 3). From the slope of the straight line we measure the fluorescence quenching constant, which is found to be 5.03 × 1012 M−1 s−1. Previously Basu et al. have reported quenching of fluorescence of EDA–CND with menadione and calculated the value of the fluorescence quenching constant on the order of 1013 M−1 s−1,63 which is in fair agreement with our calculated data. The quenching constant decreases marginally with increasing the pH, the effect being attributed to the change in the charge type of the EDA amine group as the pH changes.
 Fig. 3  Stern–Volmer plot of quenching of fluorescence of CNDs with increasing concentration of PF; λexc. = 320 nm and λem. = 430 nm (for F0/F) and λexc. = 375 nm and λem. = 450 nm (for τ0/τ). 
Time-resolved fluorescence experiments

Fig. 4 shows the fluorescence decay traces of PF excited at 375 nm and monitored at 504 nm with increasing concentration of EDA–CND. The PF emission decay could be fitted by a single exponential with a time constant of 4.91 ns (Table S2, ESI†). The PF decay traces get slower as CNDs are gradually added into PF, for example in the presence of 30 μL of CNDs the decay trace is fitted with 4.7 ns (76%) and 13.88 ns (24%) time constants. The slower lifetime (τ2: tens of ns) emanates due to the transfer of energy from the CNDs. It can be noted here that EDA–CND does not produce any emission signal in the 505 nm region, and therefore any change in the emission profile is due solely to the emitting moieties of PF. It can further be argued here that the CNDs consist of multiple chromophoric units inside, and therefore the possibility of FRET among these units cannot be completely overruled. However, as the present CNDs are amine functionalized and show an excitation wavelength independent fluorescence maximum, we can infer that the likelihood of FRET within the chromophores themselves is less and we can assign the emergence of longer lifetimes to the FRET process exclusively between the CNDs and PF.
 Fig. 4  Time-resolved fluorescence decay transients of PF with different amounts of EDA–CND monitoring the fluorescence counts at 504 nm (λexc. = 375 nm). The average lifetime has been plotted as a function of CND content in the inset. 

Fig. 5a describes the effect of PF on the CND fluorescence decay transients measured at 450 nm. EDA–CND in buffer shows a predominant lifetime component of 15.22 ns (95%) with a minor contribution of 2.14 ns (4%) (Table S3, ESI†). It can be noted here that the EDA CNDs contain multiple chromophores in their core; the shorter lifetime manifests the presence of bicyclic moieties and the longer lifetime component could be assigned to the tricyclic acridine like moieties.18 With increasing concentration of PF the contribution as well as the magnitude of the slower component decreases moderately, while the contribution of the smaller component increases. The overall decrease in the CND lifetime could be attributed either to FRET or to ET with PF; the different chromophoric units present in the CNDs31 are capable of both donating and accepting electrons with PF. It is interesting to note that while the contribution of the shorter lifetime increases its magnitude also increases from 2.14 to 4 ns in the presence of PF. A possible reason behind this could be the introduction of any reduced or oxidized species in the solution generated from the ET between EDA–CND and PF.63 It could be noted here that due to the lack of resolution of the TCSPC set up we have missed any faster component resulting from such a possible ET process.
 Fig. 5  (a) Time-resolved emission decay traces of CNDs in the absence and in the presence of PF of varying concentration in PBS buffer solution at pH 7.4, λexc. = 375 nm and λem. = 450 nm. The average lifetime has been plotted as a function of CND content in the inset. (b) Spectral overlap between the absorption spectrum of the acceptor PF (red) and the emission spectrum of the donor EDA–CND (black). 
According to Klimov et al.64 in ‘close-packed assemblies of monodisperse and mixed-size samples’ FRET pairs are generated. We observe that the excited state lifetime of the blue emitting partner (herein CNDs) decreases and the lifetime of the red emitting partner (herein PF) increases if the excitation wavelength corresponds to the energy donor. We found a considerable overlap between the fluorescence spectrum of the CNDs and the absorption spectrum of PF (Fig. 5b), which indicates the possibility of FRET from the CNDs to PF. We measure the efficiency of energy transfer (E), the critical energy transfer distance (R0) and the distance between the donor and the acceptor (r) using the following relations:65 (1) R0 = 9.78 × 103(κn−4QDJ(λ)1/6) (in Å)(2)Using the quantum yield value (12%) for EDA–CND as reported by Bhunia et al.66 we obtain a FRET efficiency of 40% and the value of R0 is found to be 5.5 nm. The efficiency of energy transfer drops to 8% when calculated using the time resolved data. Ghosh et al.67 have previously studied FRET in a Cu/HSA nanocrystal–Coumarin153 system and obtained a similar discrepancy in the energy transfer efficiency. The authors attributed the high energy transfer efficiency calculated from steady state fluorescence data as partly due to the static quenching process. In order to understand the quenching mechanism we plot F0/F and τ0/τ as a function of PF concentration (Fig. 3). It is evident that the variation of τ0/τ is rather insignificant in the concentration range of 10 μM PF in comparison to that of F0/F. This strongly indicates the major role of ground state complex formation behind the observed fluorescence quenching. The donor–acceptor proximity in the ground state complex makes the FRET efficiency high even at a low (10 μM) PF concentration, which manifests the static nature of the FRET between the pair. This also confirms that a considerable fraction of donor–acceptor pairs remain at a distance less than the calculated value of R0. Time resolved experiments show that both the contribution and the magnitude of the faster time constant increase gradually as the PF concentration increases up to 100 μM (Table S3, ESI†). It can be noted here that the time constants measured in this investigation are of the order of a few ns, which strongly shows that the FRET results reported herein are essentially diffusion-controlled and collisional in nature. To summarise, the static FRET is fast (probably on the order of sub-ps) wherein the otherwise fluorescent EDA CNDs undergo fast energy transfer to become non-fluorescent, and we could not recover any detectable change in the fluorescence lifetime.
To investigate the binding mode of EDA–CND with PF and the release of PF from this complex we employ poly ethylene glycol (PEG) as a “hydrophobic sink” to monitor the discharge of PF. The steady state fluorescence spectra of the EDA–CND–PF complex show a steady increase in the intensity along with a gradual blue shift in the emission peak of the EDA–CND fluorescence signal upon the increase of the PEG concentration (Fig. S3, ESI†). However, addition of PEG imparts a little influence on the PF fluorescence feature. PF, comprising an acridine moiety, is known to show only a small solvatochromic shift. The observed insignificant shift in the emission maximum is in agreement with this feature of PF after the addition of PEG400. This result indicates the detachment of a very small fraction of the complex and subsequent release of PF in the “hydrophobic sink” of PEG400.
Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the time resolved fluorescence spectral changes of PF (monitored at 504 nm) as PEG400 is systematically added into the EDA–CND–PF complex (100 μM PF). We observe that both the shorter and the longer time constants decrease upon gradual increment of PEG400 in the solution. Observation of this marginal decrement further corroborates negligible dissociation of the PF–CND complex. However, the possibility of charge transfer between the dissociated parts of the EDA–CND–PF complex and the long aliphatic chains of PEG could not be inferred unambiguously due to the absence of any sub-ns component in the PF excited state lifetime, even after the addition of ∼70% PEG400. Apart from that, PEG400 is well known to form H-bonds between PEG and the organic moieties present in its near vicinity. This could be another reason for the partial reduction of the lifetime of PF molecules liberated from the EDA–CND–PF complex.
As our goal is to deliver the DNA binding drug PF to the target DNA, in the next section, we attempt to study the dissociation of the drug from the drug–CND complex by CT DNA.
DNA induced dissociation of the CND–PF complex

Fig. 6a shows the change in the fluorescence feature of the PF–CND complex in the presence of CT-DNA. We observe that with gradual addition of the DNA the peak at ∼420 nm (due to the CNDs) increases modestly while that due to PF (∼507 nm) is quenched substantially. Sequestration of PF by DNA results in the observed recovery of the CND fluorescence intensity. Simultaneously the fluorescence intensity of PF is quenched, which could be attributed to the intercalation of PF in CT-DNA62 and subsequent ET from the constituent DNA bases to PF. Fig. 6b shows the time resolved emission profile of the CND–PF complex measured at 504 nm in the presence of CT-DNA. It shows the emergence of an additional faster time component of ∼400 ps (τ3 in Table S5, ESI†) with a gradually increasing contribution (∼20–75%) as DNA is added into the complex (Fig. 6b, inset). The origin of this faster component can only be argued to be as a result of the release of PF from the CND environment and its subsequent relocation in the DNA interior, which results in ET and hence a reduction in the lifetime.

(b) Fluorescence decay traces of PF with a saturating amount of EDA–CND and with different concentrations of CT DNA monitored at 504 nm (λexc. = 375 nm). The inset shows the relative contribution of the faster component (τ3) as a function of DNA concentration. 
It can be noted here that PF in aqueous DNA does not produce any longer time component (of the order of tens of ns), therefore the ∼15 ns component observed in the present investigation emanates only from the PF bound to CNDs. It is observed that even at a high DNA concentration (170 μM), there remains a ∼17% contribution of this longer component, which unambiguously confirms the retention of a considerable fraction of PF bound to the CNDs also.
Discussion
CNDs usually exhibit otherwise intriguing excitation dependent fluorescence properties, however, this very property is often found to be disadvantageous in specific experiments, especially related to FRET. In order to establish the release of PF from CNDs to DNA, one needs to monitor the FRET phenomenon by means of steady state and time resolved fluorescence properties of EDA–CND as well as the EDA–CND–PF complex. Therefore excitation independent fluorescence of CNDs was required. We prepare EDA capped CNDs, which show such excitation independent behavior (Fig. S5, ESI†). The fluorescence intensity is also found to increase after capping.
We observe a reduction of the fluorescence lifetime of EDA–CND and an increment of that of PF in the PF–CND complex, which affirms FRET from EDA–CND to PF. Bera et al. have previously determined the structure of the prepared EDA–CND.31 The longer fluorescence lifetime (∼10.3 ns) of the complex (as compared to the uncapped CNDs, which show a lifetime of ∼5.3 ns) is due to the presence of molecular fluorophores. Uncapped CNDs contain various fluorophore moieties e.g. CC, αβ-unsaturated ketone (CC–CO) etc. EDA can add to the αβ-unsaturated ketone moiety by Michael addition,68,69 reducing the multiple types of conjugations to a single acridine type of fluorophore, which grossly is responsible for the observed emission behavior of the capped CNDs.
Gradual addition of PF shows a decrease in the lifetime of EDA–CND (Fig. 5(a)), which could be credited to FRET from EDA–CND to PF, and is further supported by an increase in the lifetime of the PF emission (Fig. 4). It can be argued here that the decrease in fluorescence lifetime could also be caused by a photo-induced ET (PET) process. There are previous reports of PET between EDA–CND and a quinone type moiety, menadione.63 We, therefore, can not a priori rule out the possibility of PET in the pair. Direct PET is a rather fast process (generally of sub-ps order) and could not be resolved in the present investigation due to the limited time resolution (∼150 ps) of TCSPC.
We investigate whether introduction of a hydrophobic sink can relocate the PF molecules from the CNDs. We use PEG400 and CT-DNA as ‘hydrophobic sinks’. It is observed that in the presence of PEG400, the fluorescence profile as well as the decay pattern of PF does not suffer noticeable alteration. This leads us to infer that addition of PEG has little to no effect on the PF–CND complex. On the other hand, addition of CT-DNA imparts the emergence of a relatively fast (∼400 ps) decay timescale of PF emission, which clearly indicates its relocation in the DNA interior. The appearance of such a faster component in the aqueous PF solution has also been observed as DNA is added into it (Table S5, ESI†). The contribution of this time-scale also increases with increasing the DNA content in the solution. This conclusion receives further support from the fact that the emission intensity of the CND–PF complex increases with DNA, which can be accounted for by the fact that the PF mediated quenching of CNDs gets relieved as PF relocates into the DNA interior.
Conclusions
We found that EDA capped CNDs offer excitation independent fluorescence. They form a ground state complex with PF, which eventually quenches its fluorescence as a result of FRET. Upon addition of DNA to the CND–PF complex, gradual recovery of the quenched fluorescence intensity of the CNDs along with a sequential decrease in the PF intensity indicates sequestration of PF molecules from the CND–PF complex by CT-DNA. Our study strongly concludes that CNDs can effectively act as carriers in drug delivery.
