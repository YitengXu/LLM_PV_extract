    , Accepted 9th June 2022First published on 9th June 2022AbstractOxidative polymerization of monosubstituted triarylamines mediated by FeCl3 was proven to be an efficient and economic approach for the synthesis of polytriarylamines (PTAAs) for photovoltaic applications. Particularly, perovskite solar cells with both n–i–p and p–i–n architectures fabricated using synthesized PTAAs as HTL materials demonstrated power conversion efficiencies similar to or higher than devices produced using high-cost commercial samples of PTAAs. The obtained results pave the way for affordable HTL materials, bringing perovskite photovoltaics closer towards commercialization.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved tremendous progress in terms of power conversion efficiencies (PCE) during the last decade which features a high commercialization potential of this technology.1 To achieve a high PCE, significant efforts have been made to design and investigate new hole transport layer (HTL) materials.2 Along with the spiro-OMeTAD, polytriarylamines (PTAAs) represent one of the most commonly used families of organic hole transport materials (HTMs).3 However, even the most promising HTMs delivering high PCEs will not bring PSCs towards commercialization if their high cost is not taken into consideration.4 Unfortunately, both spiro-OMeTAD and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) are prohibitively expensive materials with a current price of ∼500 and ∼2000 $ per g, respectively.5
Spiro-OMeTAD is expensive due to its multistep synthesis (Fig. 1a) that requires low temperature, sensitive and aggressive reagents, and costly sublimation purification. The high cost of PTAAs for photovoltaic applications is driven by both the complexity of the utilized synthesis methods (Fig. 1b), which often require several synthesis steps, and the high cost of metal-based catalysts, including noble metal complexes. For example, the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura reaction has been actively utilized for the synthesis of high-quality PTAAs.6,7 Unstable and pricey Ni(COD)2 has also been used for the polycondensation of brominated triarylamines via Yamamoto coupling.8 Other known methods for the synthesis of PTAAs include oxidative polymerization by using a CuCl(OH)TMEDA complex,9 electrochemical polymerization,10,11 Pd-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling,12–15 and the Ullman reaction.16,17 Compared to all methods mentioned above, FeCl3-mediated oxidative polymerization of triarylamines is more affordable in terms of the cost of both the starting materials and reagents (oxidants, catalysts, ligands, etc.).

Although the oxidative polymerization of arylamines has been actively utilized for the synthesis of materials for electroluminescent devices, the application of this approach to prepare HTL materials for perovskite solar cells still remains unexplored.18
Herein, we report a straightforward synthesis of a series of polytriarylamines using an efficient and cheap FeCl3-assisted oxidative polymerization. This simple yet efficient synthesis approach allowed us to obtain a series of polytriarylamines outperforming commercial PTAAs in MAPbI3-based n–i–p and MA0.1Cs0.15FA0.75PbI3-based p–i–n perovskite solar cells delivering reproducible PCEs of 16–20%.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of polymers P1–P3
Polymers P1–P3 were synthesized using FeCl3-mediated oxidative polymerization of monosubstituted polytriarylamines (Fig. 2). Typically, anhydrous FeCl3 is added to the solution of monosubstituted triphenylamine 1–3 in dichlorobenzene and the reaction mixture is stirred for two days at room temperature. The product is precipitated with methanol, washed with ammonia, hydrazine, methanol and dried in air. The obtained powder is dissolved in hot chlorobenzene and filtered through silica, and the filtrate is evaporated to yield PTAAs with 68–91% yields. Additional purification was achieved by precipitation from toluene upon addition of hexane thus delivering fractions with Mw values of 15.7–17.0 kDa and a PDI of 1.8–1.9 (Table S1, ESI†). Commercial PTAA (poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine], Osilla) had a higher Mw of 26.3 kDa (PDI = 1.7) as compared to P1–P3. This should be taken into consideration when comparing the performance of the PTAA and P1–P3 as HTMs, because the higher the Mw of PTAAs, the better the solar cell efficiencies are due to the differences in the carrier recombination kinetics.19
 Fig. 2  Synthesis of polymers P1–P3. 
Polymers P1–P3 were characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy and MALDI mass spectrometry. 1H NMR spectra of polymers P1–P3 expectedly revealed a set of broad signals. Chemical shifts and integral intensities of these signals were close to those of monomers 1–3 (Fig. S1–S5, ESI†). The signals from the molecular ions for oligomers with the number of repeating units from 1 to 8 terminated by hydrogen atoms were detected in the MALDI TOF mass spectra (Fig. S6–S10, ESI†). Apparently, ionization and desorption of the molecules with higher molecular weights (n > 9) are much less favourable leading to the absence of the corresponding signals in the mass spectra.
Oxidative polymerization has been considered inapplicable for the synthesis of PTAAs for photovoltaic applications due to the abundance of multiple side reactions, leading to the formation of polymers with poor regioregularity, low molecular weights and various types of defects. Possible defects include carbon–halogen bond formation, 2–3 coupling and cross-linking leading to the formation of carbazole-type fragments.6
However, the results obtained in this work demonstrated that PSCs fabricated using PTAAs synthesized via cheap and simple oxidative polymerization demonstrated similar or in some cases even higher PCEs as compared to the devices incorporating high-cost commercial PTAAs.
Charge transport characteristics of polymers P1–P3
The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements performed for the devices incorporating polymers P1–P3 within a structure of ITO/VOx/polymer/VOx/Al were fabricated to evaluate the charge transport properties of the designed materials. Despite the introduction of various substituents (Br, Me, and tBu) into the polymer backbone, P1–P3 demonstrated comparable hole mobilities (P1: 1.3 × 10−4, P2: 1.18 × 10−4, and P3: 4 × 10−4 cm2 V s−1). The highest value was obtained for polymer P3, which also demonstrated the most promising results as a HTM in both n–i–p and p–i–n PSCs. Thus, all polymers synthesized via oxidative polymerization demonstrated good intrinsic charge transport characteristics.
HTM performance in n–i–p solar cells
The photovoltaic performance of planar junction MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells incorporating various PTAAs as HTL materials was first investigated in a standard n–i–p ITO/SnO2/PCBA/MAPbI3/HTM/VOx/Ag configuration (Fig. 3a).
 Fig. 3  Device architecture of the n–i–p solar cells (a); the best values of JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE for the devices comprising different HTMs (b); forward and reverse J–V characteristics (c) and EQE spectra (d) of n–i–p devices with an ITO/SnO2/PCBA/MAPbI3/HTM/VOx/Ag configuration. 
Semitransparent ITO glass was coated with a SnO2 electron transport layer and PCBA interface passivation layer20 thus forming an electron-collecting electrode. Then the perovskite absorber layer was deposited by spin-coating. Freshly grown films of MAPbI3 were covered by the reference commercial PTAA or polymers P1–P3 deposited from chlorobenzene solutions. The devices were completed by depositing a VOx electron-blocking layer and silver top electrodes. According to the cross-sectional SEM images for n–i–p devices (Fig. S11, ESI†), the thickness of the perovskite films is ∼300 nm, while the HTL films have an average thickness of ∼50 nm.
The obtained photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Fig. 3b and Table S2 (ESI†). Fig. 3c presents the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for PSCs with different HTMs measured under simulated AM1.5G illumination. A reference device using PTAA showed a PCE of 17.6% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.1 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1049 mV, and fill factor (FF) of 72.7% as forward scan. Devices incorporating P3 as the HTM exhibited the highest performance with a PCE of 18.6% and a JSC of 23.2 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1053 mV, and an FF of 76.2%. Only the devices fabricated using polymer P1 as the HTM demonstrated inferior PCEs as compared to the reference cells due to significantly lower FF values of 67%.
To visualize the morphology of HTM films coated atop the MAPbI3 absorber layer we fabricated samples with glass/MAPbI3/HTM architecture and investigated them using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and infrared scattering scanning near-field microscopy (IR s-SNOM) techniques.
The IR s-SNOM images obtained at the characteristic HTM vibration frequencies (Fig. 4, middle column) revealed that the films of P2 and P3 formed a more uniform and smooth coating atop MAPbI3 compared to commercial PTAA and P1. However, the s-SNOM images obtained at the MAPbI3 absorption frequencies (Fig. 4, right column) revealed some defects in the PTAA and P1 coatings, which expose bare perovskite on the film surface.
 Fig. 4  AFM topography (left column), and s-SNOM amplitude images for the glass/MAPbI3/HTM samples recorded at the characteristic frequencies of the HTM (middle column) and perovskite (right column). 
Such defects lead to charge carrier recombination and decreased photovoltaic performance as observed experimentally. The uniformity of the P2 films was considerably improved as compared to P1 and PTAA, whereas some defects were still visible. On the contrary, P3 provided very uniform coverage of a MAPbI3 layer without any defects, which is consistent with the higher performance of this polymer in n–i–p perovskite solar cells.
HTM performance in p–i–n solar cells
All synthesized polymers were explored as hole transport materials in perovskite solar cells assembled in the ITO/HTL/MA0.1Cs0.15FA0.75PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag p–i–n configuration (Fig. 5 and Table S3, ESI†). A hole transport layer composed of either PTAA or polymers P1–P3 was spin-coated on an ITO substrate. The triple-cation perovskite formulation known for its high and reproducible efficiencies in PSCs was used to form an absorber layer atop the HTL. The devices were completed by depositing a PCBM electron transport layer, BCP hole-blocking layer and top Ag electrodes. The thickness of the HTL and perovskite films in the fabricated devices was about 10 nm and 400 nm, respectively, as revealed by the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S11, ESI†). The encouraging PCE of 20.04% was reached for solar cells based on P3 (R = Me) as the hole transport material, whereas the reference devices with commercial PTAAs delivered a lower PCE of 19.9%.
 Fig. 5  Device architecture of the p–i–n solar cells (a); the best values of JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE for the devices comprising different HTMs (b); forward current–voltage characteristics (c) and EQE spectra (d) of p–i–n perovskite solar cells with an ITO/HTM/Cs0.1MA0.15FA0.75PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag configuration. 
Using P1 and P2 with Br and tBu substituents, respectively, as HTMs we obtained the PCEs of 19.5–19.7% due to a bit lower FF values. Expectedly, the highest VOC of 1070 mV was reached for the devices incorporating P1 as the HTM due to the electron withdrawing nature of the Br substituent leading to the downshifting of the P1 HOMO energy level and a better match of the perovskite valence band.8
The morphology of HTM films deposited on ITO substrates was investigated using AFM and IR s-SNOM (Fig. S12, ESI†). It has been revealed that the uniformity of the P3 films was higher as compared to the films of PTAA, P1 and P2, which is consistent with the photovoltaic performance of these HTMs in p–i–n devices.
The obtained results prove that the oxidative polycondensation represents an efficient method for the synthesis of PTAAs for photovoltaic applications. It should be emphasized that the simplicity of the synthesis approach applied in this work provides many opportunities for optimization of the polymer chemical structure. The introduction of various electron withdrawing or electron donating functional groups could be used for tuning the energy level alignment of the perovskite material and HTM, which is essential for increasing the open-circuit voltage and enhancing the performance of PSCs. Additionally, the morphology and quality of the HTM films can also be influenced by the chemical nature of the substituents in the aromatic ring.21
Thus, using HTMs based on polytriarylamines obtained via oxidative polycondensation could substantially reduce the device fabrication cost without compromising the PSC performance.

Fabrication and characterization of perovskite solar cells
Devices with n–i–p and p–i–n configurations were fabricated and characterized using previously reported procedures.6,20,21 The details are given in the ESI.†
Microscopy measurements
The images were collected using IR s-SNOM in pseudoheterodyne (PsHet) mode using a NeaSpec neaSNOM instrument as described previously.21,22 The measurements were performed at the vibration frequencies of HTMs (PTAA: 1319, P1: 1266, P2 and P3: 1268 cm−1), which do not overlap with the IR frequencies of the MA+ cation in perovskite (962 and 1249 cm−1, Fig. S13, ESI†). The cross-sectional SEM images of the solar cells were obtained using a Zeiss SUPRA 25 instrument.
Conclusions
To summarize, we presented a series of polytriarylamines obtained by simple and cheap oxidative polymerization, which can be successfully utilized as hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells assembled in both p–i–n or n–i–p architectures. The devices fabricated using the obtained HTM polymers demonstrated high PCEs reaching 20%, which are comparable to or even higher than the efficiencies of the reference cells comprising high-cost commercial PTAAs synthesized using Suzuki polycondensation. The obtained results pave a way to dramatically reduce the cost of polymeric hole transport materials down to 50–60 USD per gram or even below, thus bringing perovskite photovoltaics closer to commercialization.
