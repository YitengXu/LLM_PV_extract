    , Accepted 1st August 2013First published on 1st August 2013AbstractAgricultural residue derived cellulose and cotton cellulose were used to synthesize quasi-spherical nanoparticles of 6-carboxycellulose having diameter 25–35 nm. This provides a new range of functionalized nanostructured celluloses with increased versatility and applications. The nanoparticles were efficient in stabilizing carbon nanotube dispersions and were effective anti-microbial agents against E. coli.
Controlling the shape, size and surface functionality of nanoparticles can be a potent tool to manipulate the properties, and thereby the applications, of nanoparticles. In the case of metal nanoparticles, intense research efforts have been directed towards controlling these parameters.1–10 Metal nanomaterials have dimensions similar to several biomolecules such as proteins, DNA, etc., and the integration of metallic nanoparticles with biopolymers (such as cellulose and its functionalized derivatives) can lead to hybrid nanomaterials having a combination of properties of the two constituent materials. Cellulose is well recognized as the most abundant, annually renewable, and extremely versatile polymer with a multitude of applications.11 Conversion of cellulose to nanocellulose, in forms generally referred to as nanofibres, nanofibrils, nanowhiskers, nanocrystals, etc.,12,13 has led to many new high-end applications of cellulose in fields as diverse as nanocomposites, nanobiomaterials, cosmetics and medical devices.14,15 Cellulose nanomaterial substrates have also been utilized in the fabrication of recyclable organic solar cells, and further development in this field can lead to their increasing use in energy production technologies.16 Cellular bioimaging applications by attaching fluorescent molecules onto cellulose nanocrystals have been reported,17 in addition to several other niche applications such as drug delivery.18 Important reviews have recently appeared on composites produced from cellulose nanoparticles, new applications of cellulose nanowhiskers and self-assembly of cellulose nanocrystals.19–21 There are also reports of obtaining spherical shaped cellulose nanoparticles,22 often under very special reaction conditions which include sonication for ten hours during the course of mild acid hydrolysis. However, in the latter case the polydispersity obtained was very high, with the size of the nanoparticles ranging from 10–180 nm.23 One of the major advantages of spherical cellulose nanoparticles is their stability in aqueous suspensions for several months.24 Investigations of cellular uptake by such nanoparticles have revealed the profound effect of geometry of biocompatible nanomaterials on endocytosis.24 In a detailed review paper, Katz and Willner had stated: “The importance of functionalized nanoparticles for biomedical applications cannot be overestimated. For instance, targeted entry into cells is an increasingly important area of research”.11 Spherical nanoparticles (80–200 nm) of aminofunctionalized celluloses have also been recently reported by them.25 Such materials have important implications in biomedical applications, such as gene delivery. Amine functional polymers such as polyethyleneimine used in such studies possess toxicity, whereas polysaccharides are non-toxic.25 Spherical hydrophobic cellulose acetate composite nanoparticles with several polysaccharides have been prepared for potential applications in the pharmaceutical and food technology industries.26,27
Carboxy functionalized celluloses, prepared by oxidation of cellulose, are amongst the most investigated derivatives of cellulose, due to their applications in wound dressing gauzes and several other related biomedical applications for over 70 years.28–31 The earliest report on oxidation of cellulose was way back in 1883.32 Since then there have been continuous streams of papers and patents on various methods of oxidation of cellulose, and the properties of such materials.33–38 In recent years, specifically around the period 1998–2000, nanofibres of oxidized celluloses have also been synthesized and their properties and applications vigorously investigated.36–39 However, we have seen no reports of spherical shaped carboxy functionalized celluloses. As observed for other cellulose nanoparticle derivatives, spherical shapes are more likely to show stability in solvent dispersions as compared to nanofibres. Similarly, the geometrical shape of the nanoparticle can play a role in drug delivery and biomedical applications. Herein we report, for the first time, devising a simple method to obtain spherical shaped polymer nanoparticles of 6-carboxycellulose (6CC) (Fig. 1) where so far only rod-shaped particles have been reported. Since 6CCs with varying carboxyl group content are an extremely important class of commercial biomaterials, we decided to investigate methods to prepare spherical nanoparticles of such materials as a function of carboxy content. We also demonstrate for the first time that these spherical functionalized nanoparticles are extremely efficient in stabilizing carbon nanotubes (Fig. 3) with minimal ultrasonication, thereby saving energy. Both these factors could be key development for paving the way to many new applications for this material. The efficiency of these carboxycellulose quasi-spherical nanoparticles in anti-microbial applications was studied for E. coli (Fig. 3). It was found that the nanoparticles were more efficient than their larger sized analogs in eliminating E. coli from aqueous solutions.

6CCs were synthesized by using an acid mixture (65% HNO3 and 85% H3PO4) with added NaNO2 as an oxidant. The literature reports that the reaction is generally carried out at room temperature (20–25 °C), as this reaction is very sensitive to temperature, leading to depolymerization and degradation to smaller fragments at higher temperatures.33,35 However the current synthesis was carried out at 25 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C so as to re-visit the oxidized products obtainable at higher temperatures in a strongly acidic environment, with the aim of generating nanoparticles of lower DP and possibly spherical shape. Further, we decided to use agricultural residues (sugarcane bagasse, in this case) as the source of cellulose (∼94% α-cellulose content), made by our proprietary process,40 since these celluloses are of lower molecular weight (DP ∼ 450) and lower crystallinity (∼50%) than wood and cotton cellulose. A parallel set of experiments was carried out using cotton linters (DP ∼ 1000, ∼70% crystallinity, and ∼100% α-cellulose content) to ascertain whether the methodology was applicable to all varieties of cellulose with different physical and morphological characteristics. The products were characterized by FTIR, C13-NMR, and wide-angle XRD; they all show that the overall spectral features of the carboxy functionalized cellulose nanoparticles correspond to those of the starting cellulose even after reaction, with the carboxy functional groups at C6 clearly identified and corresponding changes in the original unreacted C6 peaks (Fig. 2).

The work-up procedures after the oxidation reaction were carefully tuned so as to obtain two crops at temperatures up to 40 °C (where the second crop consisted of quasi-spherical nanoparticles; the first crop consisted of larger particles) for both bagasse cellulose and cotton cellulose. Above 40 °C reaction temperature only single crops were obtained, all entirely consisting of nanoparticles. The carboxy content of the 6CC was 13.2% (i.e., 13.2% of the C6 groups of cellulose were replaced by carboxy groups), with DP ∼ 70. Details of yields obtained for various reaction times and temperatures are shown in the ESI,† Table S1. At higher temperatures (50 and 70 °C), the entire product consists of nanoparticles. Only fifteen minutes of low power ultrasonication (50 Hz) produced stable aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles. This is in contrast to published reports where much longer sonication times were needed.23
Surprisingly, both bagasse cellulose and cotton linters gave quasi-spherical shaped nanoparticles of about the same DP (∼50 at 70 °C and ∼70 at 50 °C). In the solid state the carboxy groups of 6CC are likely to H-bond with neighbouring hydroxyl groups, disrupting the original H-bonding structure and forming new inter- and intra-chain bonds in such a way that a quasi-spherical shape results. The lower molecular weight of the nanoparticles could also be a factor. The DPs of 6CC nanofibres reported in the literature are estimated to be much higher, 291–384.37 A detailed X-ray analysis of the crystal structure has been initiated, which will throw more light on the factors leading to the new unexpected shapes of these nanoparticles.
The spherical morphology of 6CC nanoparticles is clearly seen in SEM, TEM, and AFM images (Fig. 3). TEM and AFM images of these nanoparticles show fairly uniform size of the particles in the range of 25–35 nm. The SEM image appears to show discrete nanoparticles; however, the particle sizes are 90–110 nm, indicating that 3–4 molecules are agglomerated. Furthermore, DLS shows the particle size to be ∼132 nm with a very low polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.045 (see DLS spectra in ESI,† Fig. S4). It is reported in the literature that DLS and TEM analysis generally do not match accurately. In a recent paper on quasi-spherical regenerated cellulose characterization, the TEM image showed particle sizes in the range of 90–110 nm, whereas the DLS measurements showed a range from 50–550 nm, with the peak maximum at 200 nm and a relatively high PDI of 0.215.41 This difference generally arises from the fact that TEM studies are carried out in dry form (a sample droplet evaporated on a TEM copper grid), while the DLS measurements are carried out in suspension and polymer molecules, which have a good chance to agglomerate. It is interesting to note that our spherical shaped cellulosic nanoparticles have a much narrower PDI than that of the elongated cellulosic nanofibers. The DP of these particles was approximately 50 at 70 °C, or 70 at 50 °C (see ESI† for details). These nanoparticles are highly efficient against E. coli (Fig. 3, iv) and they stabilized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in aqueous solution for several days (Fig. 3, v).

In conclusion, the current study demonstrates for the first time that both low molecular weight agricultural residue derived cellulose as well as higher molecular weight cotton cellulose can be utilized for producing quasi-spherical shaped nanoparticles of 6CC with low DP (∼50 at 70 °C, or ∼70 at 50 °C), which can extend the range of applications of fibril shaped nanoparticles of 6CC made by other oxidation systems. Preliminary studies have already shown the efficacy of these materials in stabilizing aqueous dispersions of single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes for several days, and the isolated product of such stable dispersions gives rise to new hybrid materials which can have applications in biocompatible semiconducting devices. The 6CC nanoparticles have also shown improved anti-microbial properties for E. coli. Many more biomedical applications of 6CC nanoparticles, fluorescent 6CC-NP and their role in bioimaging, 6CC–CNT hybrids, 6CC metal complexes, metal nanoparticles embedded in 6CC-NP, etc. are under exploration. These studies will add to the initial forays in this direction by innovative papers published on nanocellulose applications such as a nanoporous cellulose gel as a support for noble metal nanoparticles,42 preparation of stable high density silver nanoparticles templated on oxidized cellulose nanofibers,43 flexible magnetic aerogels and magnetic nanopaper using cellulose nanofibrils for potential applications in electronic actuators and microfluidic devices,44 assembly of gold nanoparticles on a polysaccharide surface,45 photoswitchable titanium dioxide nanocellulose aerogels which can open up new applications,46 and so on.
