    , Accepted 7th February 2013First published on 7th February 2013AbstractWe report a facile, scalable, and low cost chemical bath deposition of vertically aligned TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays on various substrates including fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass substrates and their applications for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and dye sensitized solar cells. The TiO2 arrays consisting of single crystal rutile nanoplatelets with heights (film thicknesses) of up to 1 μm, lengths of up to 130 nm, and widths of ∼5 nm were grown via controlling oxidation and hydrolysis of TiCl3 at low pH (0.71–0.85) and low TiCl3 concentration (8–40 mM). As a photoanode for water oxidation in a PEC water splitting cell, the TiO2 nanoplatelets show excellent charge separation characteristics with a saturated photocurrent in 1 M KOH electrolyte under AM 1.5 G illumination of ∼0.4 mA cm−2 reached at an exceptionally low bias of −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Dye sensitized solar cells assembled using N719 dye sensitized-TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays also show promising performance with photoconversion efficiencies of 1.28% for as-synthesized (no thermal post-treatment) and 3.7% for annealed TiO2 nanoplatelets.
Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an abundant, low-cost, non-toxic, and photo-chemically stable metal oxide that has been widely used as a white pigment and sunscreen.1–4 TiO2 is also a promising semiconductor material for various applications in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cells, organic pollutant photodegradation, lithium-ion batteries, and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1,5–7 TiO2 has a large band gap of 3.0 eV for rutile and 3.2 eV for anatase, therefore setting its theoretical maximum solar energy (AM 1.5 G conditions) conversion efficiency at 2.2%.8 Since Fujishima and Honda discovered the photoelectrolysis of water using an n-type rutile TiO2 phoanode in 1972,1 numerous efforts have focused on improving the solar energy conversion efficiency of TiO2 materials via (1) reducing the band gap of TiO2 or sensitizing TiO2 with dye molecules to absorb visible light and (2) fabricating nanostructures of TiO2 to improve charge transport properties and to increase surface area for dye adsorption.5,6,9–15 Incorporating TiO2 with nonmetal ions such as C,16 N,5,10etc., and coincorporating TiO2 with metal and nonmetal ions17–19 have shown some successes in extending the optical absorption edge to the visible light region. Sensitization of TiO2 photoelectrodes with dye molecules for application in DSSCs has proven very efficient for converting visible light into electricity and has been the subject of extensive research since the discovery of O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991.6
Besides enhancing optical absorption, it is equally important to improve the charge transport properties of TiO2.15,20–22 In a PEC water splitting cell, holes photogenerated in TiO2 must diffuse to the electrode/electrolyte interface to participate in water oxidation, while photogenerated electrons must diffuse to the electrical contact then transport to the cathode to participate in water reduction. The hole diffusion length of TiO2 is ∼10 nm,23 significantly smaller than the optical path length required for light absorption (on order of 1 μm), therefore most photogenerated holes recombine before reaching electrolyte in a dense film of a sufficient thickness for light absorption. Recent work has focused on rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays since these structures provide equivalent optical penetration depth to planar dense films but with less distance required for holes to diffuse to the interface (holes only need to diffuse across the radius of the nanowires).10,11,13,15,20 In addition to rapid charge transport properties, these nanostructures offer a high surface area for dye adsorption which is essential for improving solar conversion efficiency in DSSCs.24,25
While anatase TiO2 nanoplatelets have been reported by several research groups,26–29 there are fewer reports on rutile TiO2 naoplatelets probably due to the difficulty in preparation (rutile TiO2 tends to form a one dimensional structure rather than two dimensional structures).30 In the present study, we report a simple and scalable chemical bath deposition of nanoplatelet arrays of rutile TiO2 with lengths of ∼130 nm, widths of ∼5 nm, and heights (film thicknesses) of ∼1 μm on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates for photoanodes in PEC water oxidation and DSSC applications. We also demonstrate that this method can be applied for growing nanoplatelet arrays on various substrates including but not limited to Ti foil, glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, Si wafers, etc. The scalability, ease of synthesis, low cost (using low cost precursors TiCl3, HCl, and H2O), and low reaction temperature (∼80 °C) are ideal for various applications, especially solar energy conversion.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were purchased and used without further purification including TiCl3 (20% in 3% HCl acid, Alfa Aesar), HCl (ACS Reagent Grade 36.5–38%, MP), di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) aka N719 dye (Sigma Aldrich), Idolyte AN-50 (Solaronix).
Chemical bath deposition (CBD) of TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (with size of up to 3 cm × 3 cm) and other substrates were first cleaned by sonication in a mixture of ethanol and water for 30 min, subsequently rinsed with deionized water, dried in an air stream and placed on the bottom of the 50 mL Pyrex glass vial reactor. In a typical CBD procedure, the reaction solutions containing 10 mL of deionized water, 0.05–2.5 mL of TiCl3 solution (20% in 3% hydrochloric acid, Alfa Aesar), and 0–0.4 mL of HCl (ACS reagent grade 36.5–38%, MP) were magnetically stirred for 30 minutes before being transferred into the Pyrex glass reactor. The CBD was conducted at 80 °C for 2 to 10 hours in a box furnace. After the reaction was complete and the reactor was cooled down, the TiO2 nanoplatelet films were taken out and rinsed with copious amount of water. The TiO2 film deposited on the glass side of the FTO substrate was scraped off using a razor blade prior to further experimentation.
Post-treatments
The TiO2 nanoplatelets were then kept at 30 °C in a vacuum oven overnight, followed by ultraviolet/ozone treatment for 30 minutes to remove contaminants. Some of the samples were annealed in air at 450–550 °C in a box furnace for 30 minutes.
Material characterizations
SEM was performed on a Zeiss field-emission SEM using a 10 kV focus voltage. TEM and HRTEM were performed on a JEOL 2010F field-emission TEM using a 200 kV focus voltage. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns were collected with a Bruker D8 diffractometer. The transmittance spectra were collected using a Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were acquired at room temperature using a FluoroLog 3 (Horiba Scientific) spectrofluorimeter. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Kratos Axis X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a scanning step of 0.1 eV and a dwell time of 0.4 seconds per step. The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1s photoelectron peak at 284.5 eV as a reference.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterizations
The PEC measurements were performed using a three-electrode electrochemical cell with the FTO supported nanoplatelet array as the working electrode, a Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and 1 M KOH electrolyte (pH = 13.5). The working electrode with exposed area of 0.205 cm2 was illuminated from the back side (through the FTO substrate – TiO2 nanoplatelet interface) by a solar simulator (Newport, Model 9600, 150 W xenon lamp) equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter (Newport, Model 81094). The light intensity was measured as 100 mW cm−2 using a thermopile detector with a spectrum response from 0.19 to 10.6 μm (Newport, 818P-020-12). A CHI 660D electrochemical station was used for linear sweep voltammetry (I–V) and chronoamperometry (I–t) measurements.
Incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were calculated from chronoamperometry measurements using a motorized monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130 1/8 m). The monochromator slit size was adjusted to 0.75 mm × 2 mm providing monochromatic wavelengths with a bandwidth of ∼8 nm and a power density which could be adjusted from 197 to 705 μW cm−2 for wavelengths from 320 to 800 nm. A typical light power density spectrum used for IPCE can be found in Fig. S1.† Light power was measured using a handheld optical power meter with a UV enhanced silicon photo-detector (Newport). IPCE values were calculated using the following equation: (1)where jp(λ) is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and Eλ(λ) is the incident light power density (mW cm−2) for each wavelength, λ (nm).
The measured potentials vs. the Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + EoAg/AgCl(2)where ERHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, EAg/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and EoAg/AgCl = 0.1976 V at 25 °C.
Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) fabrication
The TiO2 nanoplatelet samples were immersed overnight in an ethanol solution containing 0.5 mM N719 dye (di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis (isothiocyanato) bis (2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II), Sigma Aldrich) for dye adsorption. Dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays with an active area of ∼0.25 to 0.64 cm2 were assembled in a sandwich-type configuration with a Pt-coated FTO glass counter electrode (Solaronix) and a 25 μm thick SX-1170 (Solaronix) spacer. The cells were filled with a commercial iodine/tri-iodine in acetonitrile based electrolyte (Iodolyte AN-50, Solaronix).
Dye sensitized solar cell characterizations

J–V measurements were obtained using a CHI 660D electrochemical station by independently applying external voltage to the cell and measuring the photocurrent. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the DSSCs was obtained under AM 1.5 G illumination at open circuit potentials.
Results and discussion
Characterization of TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays

Fig. 1a and b show the cross-sectional view and top view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of a typical as-synthesized TiO2 nanoplatelet array on a FTO substrate, which was deposited at 80 °C for 3 h in 8 mM TiCl3 solution with pH of 0.85. The TiO2 arrays consist of vertically aligned nanoplatelets with heights (film thicknesses) of ∼1 μm, lengths of ∼130 nm, and widths less than 5 nm. The TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays can be classified as rutile TiO2 (JCPDS #88-1875) with an enhancement in the exposure of the (101) facet, indicating that the nanoplatelets are well crystallized (Fig. 1d). The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in Fig. 1c indicates that the as-synthesized nanoplatelet is single crystalline, has a (110) interplanar d-spacing of 3.22 Å, and preferentially grows along the [001] direction.

Fig. 2a shows the XPS spectrum for core Ti 2p electrons from the TiO2 nanoplatelet sample. The Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 XPS features at 458.4 eV and 464.1 eV respectively are assigned to Ti4+. Although, the Ti precursor is Ti3+ (in TiCl3), we observed only Ti4+ in the nanoplatelets. Fig. 2b shows the XPS spectrum of core O 1s which can be fitted by 2 curves peaking at 529.6 eV and 531.3 eV which can be assigned to surface O in Ti–O and in –OH bonds respectively.31

The morphology of the TiO2 films significantly changes with the acidity (pH) of the reaction solution. Fig. 3 shows the top-view SEM image of the TiO2 films obtained at different pH ranging from 1.2 to 0.66 (pH of the solution was adjusted by adding 0.05–0.3 mL of HCl solution to 10 mL of the reaction solution). We did not obtain any TiO2 deposition on the FTO substrate when the pH was out of this pH range. The TiO2 nanoplatelet morphology can only be obtained for pH in the range of 0.71–0.85 (with addition of 0.2–0.25 mL of HCl solution). We observed an increase in the formation of a needle-like morphology when the pH was decreased to a value lower than 0.71. In order to exclude the effect of changing the concentration of Cl− ions due to addition of different amounts of HCl, we provided supplemental Cl− ion by adding various amounts of NaCl to the reaction solutions until the reaction solution is saturated with NaCl. There is no change in the morphology of the TiO2 films with the addition of different amounts of NaCl, thus confirming that the nanostructure of the TiO2 films strongly depends on pH of the reaction solution but not on Cl− from the HCl solution.

We note that there is no TiO2 film obtained when pH of the precursor solution is smaller than 0.6 or larger than 1.2. 
Hydrothermal/solvothermal grown one dimensional (1D) nanostructures of rutile TiO2 have received much attention since they demonstrate good performance for water photo-oxidation and DSSC applications.10,11,13 Typically the TiO2 nanowire arrays are hydrothermally/solvothermally grown using a Ti(IV) alkoxide such as titanium(IV) isopropoxide and titanium(IV) butoxide with or without TiCl4 as the titanium precursors. The growth of oriented TiO2 nanowires requires (1) slow hydrolysis of Ti precursors acquired by using a strong acidic medium and (2) capping agents/surfactants.13 Generally, the growth of 2D morphologies of rutile is not easy since it requires even slower reaction rates.30 Controlling the oxidation and hydrolysis of the Ti(III) precursor (such as TiCl3) is the key to obtaining the nanoplatelet morphology. Aoyama et al.30 investigated a 9 day chemical bath deposition of TiO2 nanosheets on glass substrates at room temperature using 0.1 M TiCl3 as the Ti precursor, reporting that the initial deposition started after 4 days, and then nanorod assembly started forming on the surface after 6 days. Finally, the formation of nanosheets from the nanorods started after 7 days.30 During TiO2 crystal growth, TiIII species were gradually oxidized by dissolved O2 to TiIV species which were then hydrolyzed to form TiO2. Aoyama et al. also reported that when the initial pH was changed from 0.7 to 2 or the reaction temperature was increased from 25 °C to 40 °C to increase the reaction rate, needle-like morphologies or random aggregates were formed.
In our study, the growing process was facilitated by increasing the reaction temperature to 80 °C but utilizing a much lower TiCl3 concentration (8–40 mM) and low pH (0.60–1.2). Fig. 4 shows the time-evolution growth of the TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays (pH = 0.71). The SEM image of the FTO substrate was included in Fig. 4a for reference. We observed a TiO2 nanoplatelet crystal growth process similar to that reported by Aoyama and coworkers30 but on a much faster time scale. Initially, a TiO2 nuclei layer is slowly deposited on the FTO substrate in the first 135 minutes (Fig. 4b). After 150 minutes, TiO2 nano-needles were formed (Fig. 4c) and quickly converted to nanoplatelets after 165 minutes as shown in Fig. 4d (thickness of the film is ∼290 nm). The TiO2 nanoplatelets are then quickly grown, reaching a thickness of ∼1 μm after 180 minutes (Fig. 1a). Prolonging the reaction duration from 3 hours to up to 10 hours does not increase the film thickness, but produces micron-size particles which consist of many nanoplatelets (ESI, Fig. S2†) aggregating on the bottom of the reactor or on top of the films. The hierarchical nanoplatelet TiO2 aggregates can be easily removed by rinsing with DI water or by an air stream. Employing SEM, we observed significantly fewer hierarchical aggregates on the TiO2 nanoplatelet films rinsed well with water compared with unrinsed films. We believe that the aggregates can act as a light scattering layer, thus improving the light harvesting efficiency of the photoelectrode. We, however, have not quantified the effects of the aggregates.

Although, we did not make a comprehensive investigation on the growth mechanism of the TiO2 on other substrates (glass, Si, PET plastic), we believe that the growth mechanism is similar to that on FTO substrates. Although there is no lattice matching between rutile TiO2 and glass, Si, and PET plastic, the adherence of the TiO2 films to these substrates is quite good. Since the TiO2 nanoplatelets grow on the TiO2 nuclei layer, the adherence of the TiO2 films depend mostly on the adherence of the nuclei layer to the substrates.
We did not observe a split of the nanosheets to nanofibers when prolonging the growing time of TiO2 nanosheet-arrays as reported by Zhu et al. when titanium(IV) isopropoxide was used as the Ti precursor.32 Zhu et al. explained that this split is due to the increase in elastic strain stemming from the lattice mismatch between rutile TiO2 and the FTO substrate when the size of the TiO2 nanosheets increases. We have succeeded growing TiO2 nanoplatelet films on various substrates with different roughness and crystal structure such as glass, Ti foil, PET plastic, Si wafers etc. using the same recipe (ESI, Fig. S3†). We, therefore, believe that employing TiCl3 as the Ti precursor is the key in obtaining the nanoplatelet structure.
In order to investigate the effects of TiCl3 concentration, we prepared various TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays by adding 0.05–0.25 mL of TiCl3 solution to a reaction solution containing 10 mL of DI water and 0.2 mL of HCl to obtain concentrations of TiCl3 of from 8 to 40 mM. The pH of the reaction solution changes slightly when adding different volumes of TiCl3, reaching a pH of 0.91 with addition of 0.05 mL of TiCl3 solution and a pH of 0.70 with the addition of 0.25 mL of TiCl3 solution. As shown in Fig. 5, the density of the nanoplatelets increases with the TiCl3 concentration. It is interesting to note that the thickness of the nanoplatelet arrays (the heights of the nanoplatelets) is almost the same although the shape of the nanoplatelets changes slightly with TiCl3 concentration which is probably due to the slight changes in pH of the precursor solution with the addition of different volumes of TiCl3 solution.

The scale bar is applied for all micrographs. Note that the pH of the reaction solution changes slightly with the addition of different amounts of TiCl3 solution. 

Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis absorbance spectra of a typical TiO2 nanoplatelet array with the absorption edge at ∼415 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 3.0 eV, in agreement with the reported band gap value for rutile.2Fig. 6b shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra obtained using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm (3.88 eV) at room temperature of a typical TiO2 nanoplatelet array. The PL from a semiconductor is a result of charge carrier recombination.33 Previous studies have shown that due to the indirect transition nature of TiO2, the PL response of bulk TiO2 is difficult to observe at room temperature (note that TiO2 has a direct band gap but is subjected to dipole-forbidden transitions31,34). We however observed a clear room temperature PL spectrum which can be fit by 3 Gaussian peaks at 402 nm (3.08 eV), 440 nm (2.82 eV), and 486 nm (2.55 eV). Interestingly, the PL peak at 402 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 50 nm coincides well with the band edge absorption shown in Fig. 6a and can thus be assigned as a band-to-band recombination. This band edge emission is very difficult to observe for indirect band gap semiconductors such as GaP and TiO2. There have been only few studies demonstrating the band-to-band emission for TiO2 ultrafine nanoparticles (∼2 nm).35 The PL band centered at 440 nm is attributed to surface trap states.36 Finally the small peak at 486 nm is associated with surface oxygen vacancies since it originates from the charge transfer transition from Ti3+ to the oxygen anion in TiO68−.37

The inset shows the Tauc plot created for the absorbance values and (b) photoluminescence emission spectrum (the black curve under the red curve which is the sum of the Gaussian fitted curves shown in green) from a typical TiO2 nanoplatelet film obtained at room temperature. The excitation wavelength is at 320 nm (3.88 eV). 
Photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance of TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays
The PEC performance of the TiO2 films on FTO was measured using a three-electrode electrochemical cell with the FTO supported TiO2 nanoplatelet array as the working electrode with exposed area of 0.205 cm2, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and 1 M KOH electrolyte (pH = 13.5). A solar simulator (Oriel 96000) coupled with an AM 1.5 G filter was used as the light source with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 measured by a thermopile detector (Newport 818P-020-12).
Before testing, the as-synthesized films were annealed in air at 550 °C for 30 minutes to improve crystallinity and adherence of the TiO2 nanoplatelet array to the SnO2 layer. After annealing, the TiO2 arrays preserved their nanoplatelet morphology, the thickness of the TiO2 nanoplatelets, however, increases to ∼10 to 12 nm, probably due to sintering effects (Fig. S4†). Fig. 7a shows linear sweep voltammetry under intermittent illumination for a typical TiO2 nanoplatelet array synthesized with a 16 mM TiCl3 precursor solution at pH of 0.71. The onset potential is at −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.2 VRHE), in good agreement with the flat band potential determined from the Mott–Schottky plot (ESI, Fig. S5†). It is interesting that the photocurrent increases sharply with applied bias, reaching the saturated photocurrent at an exceptionally low potential of −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs. RHE), compared to −0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl for the single crystalline TiO2 rutile nanowire array photoanode reported by Feng et al.11 and compared to 0.5–1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for nanoparticle-based TiO2 photoanodes.38 This indicates excellent charge separation characteristics resulting from a high degree of crystallinity and a unique morphology that enables vectorial charge transfer (photo-generated holes just need to diffuse one-half of the lateral dimension of the nanoplatelet and photo-generated electrons can transport to the back contact without scattering at grain boundaries21). Fig. 7b shows the IPCE spectrum for the TiO2 nanoplatelet photoanode in 1 M KOH at 1.2 VRHE. The IPCE onset is at ∼410 nm, in good agreement with a band gap of ∼3.0 eV as measured above. The IPCE values are high (≥40%) over a range of 330–380 nm, reaching a maximum of 57% at 350 nm indicative of high light absorption and good charge separation characteristics. The IPCE of the TiO2 nanoplatelets in our report is not as high as that reported for the TiO2 nanowire arrays11 because the TiO2 nanoplatelet film thickness is only ∼1 μm, significantly lower than the thickness of the TiO2 nanowire film thickness (∼2 μm).
 Fig. 7  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry under intermittent AM 1.5 G illumination and (b) IPCE spectrum at 1.2 VRHE for a typical TiO2 nanoplatelet film synthesized with a 16 mM TiCl3 precursor solution at pH of 0.71. (c) PEC performance at 1.2 VRHE of TiO2 films synthesized at various pH. All measurements were conducted using 3-electrode electrochemical cell with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and 1 M KOH electrolyte. 

Fig. 7c shows the PEC performance at 1.2 VRHE for the TiO2 nanoplatelet films grown at various values of pH. The TiO2 films obtained at pH of 0.6 and pH ≥ 1.06 are very thin, thus showing very poor PEC performance due to poor light absorption. The average thickness of TiO2 films obtained at pH of 0.66 is ∼600 nm, compared to ∼1 μm for the films obtained at pH of 0.71 and 0.85, thus absorbing fewer photons and exhibiting lower photocurrents. The TiO2 nanoplatelet films obtained at pH of 0.71 demonstrate better PEC performance than the films grown at pH of 0.85, although both films have quite similar morphology and thickness. We are unable to obtain exclusive evidence to explain this phenomenon. We hypothesize that changing pH might affect the initial nucleation rate and affect the aggregation at the base of the nanoplatelets which inhibits the diffusion of electrolyte deep into the TiO2 nanoplatelet array (which cannot be observed by conventional SEM).
Dye sensitized solar cell performance of TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays
Prior to testing the performance for dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC), the as-synthesized TiO2 nanoplatelet samples were kept at 30 °C in a vacuum oven overnight to evaporate residual water, followed by UV/ozone treatment for 30 minutes to remove contaminants. Some of the films denoted as annealed-TiO2 nanoplatelets were annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 minutes. The TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays were then immersed overnight in an ethanol solution of 0.5 mM N719 dye for dye adsorption. Dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays with an active area of ∼0.25 to 0.64 cm2 were assembled as described in the Experimental section. The cells were filled with a commercial iodine/tri-iodine in acetonitrile based electrolyte (Iodolyte AN-50, Solaronix).

Fig. 8a shows the J–V characteristics and photoconversion efficiency of a typical dye sensitized, “as-synthesized” TiO2 nanoplatelet sample (no thermal post-treatment) under AM 1.5 G illumination. The photoconversion efficiency is 1.28% with an open circuit potential (Voc) of 0.68 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.92 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 64%. This is quite promising performance for a TiO2 film that does not require thermal post-treatment. As we mentioned in the previous section, we were able to grow the nanoplatelet arrays on various types of substrates (including PET plastic). The as-synthesized TiO2 nanoplatelets are already crystallized and are thus ready to be used for DSSC applications. This ability is especially useful for DSSC applications requiring flexible substrates which are normally polymer based materials and cannot handle the high temperatures that might be required in post-treatment processes. We note that the TiO2 nanoplatelet film thickness is ∼1 μm, significantly lower than the thickness of the TiO2 nanoparticle layer in a typical dye sensitized solar cell (∼5 μm). We are currently investigating methods to grow thicker TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays to improve solar conversion efficiency.

Although, the thickness of the TiO2 nanoplatelets increases after annealing, thus lowering the surface area, the annealed-TiO2 nanoplatelets show significant improvement in DSSC performance (Fig. 8a) with an overall photoconversion efficiency of 3.7%, Voc of 0.76 V, Jsc of 7.66 mA cm−2, and FF of 64%. Fig. 8b shows the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the annealed TiO2 nanoplatelet sample measured under short-circuit conditions. The photocurrent obtained by integrating the calculated EQE multiplied by AM 1.5 G the solar energy flux is 7.55 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the measured Jsc value (7.66 mA cm−2).

Fig. 9 shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra obtained under AM 1.5 G illumination at Voc of the DSSCs made of as-synthesized (red) and annealed (blue) TiO2 nanoplatelet samples. Both spectra show 2 semi-circles, of which the smaller and larger semicircles are attributed to the charge transfer at the counter electrode (CE)/electrolyte interface and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively. The sheet resistance (Rs) of the substrates and the electrolyte, charge transfer resistance of the CE (R1), resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (R2), and constant phase elements (CPE1 and CPE2) were analyzed using Z-view software with an equivalent circuit shown in the top of Fig. 9. Both cells have similar Rs of ∼11.5 Ω and R1 of ∼1.8 Ω as expected due to the use of the same counter electrode and electrolyte. It is interesting that the cell made of as-synthesized TiO2 nanoplatelets exhibits a higher value for R2 of ∼43 Ω compared to R2 of ∼17 Ω for the annealed TiO2 nanoplatelets. Normally, the increase in R2 indicates a better barrier for the back-transferring of electrons from TiO2 to the electrolyte, thus improving the DSSC performance.39 However, we observed lower performance for the as-synthesized TiO2 nanoplatelets cell. We propose that since the as-synthesized TiO2 film did not undergo thermal treatment, there are still some hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the TiO2 nanoplatelet surfaces and probably moisture and oxygen trapped in the nanoplatelet arrays that could introduce adverse effects regarding N719 dye adsorption and/or degrade the N719 dye. The products of N719 dye degradation might be pyridine derivatives which are not effective for photon conversion but can adsorb on the TiO2 surface thus inhibiting electron back transfer from the TiO2 to the electrolyte. Jo et al. reported similar phenomena with the performance of their DSSCs decreasing with increasing the N719 dye coating temperature.39 The authors explained that the degradation of N719 dye at high temperature produces pyridine derivatives which act as a barrier for electron back scattering.

The inset demonstrates the equivalent circuit of the cell consisting of the counter electrode (CE)/redox electrolyte interface and the TiO2/dye/redox electrolyte interface, where R1 and R2 are the respective resistances, CPE1 and CPE2 are the respective constant phase elements, and Rs is the sheet resistance of FTO, Pt-coated FTO substrates and the resistance of electrolyte. 
Conclusions
In conclusion, we report facile, scalable, and low cost chemical bath deposition of single crystalline TiO2 rutile nanoplatelet arrays on FTO and various substrates including Ti foil, glass, PET plastic, and Si substrates. The nanoplatelet arrays consist of vertically aligned nanoplatelets with heights (film thicknesses) of up to 1 μm, lengths up to 130 nm, and widths less than 5 nm. The growth of the nanoplatelet arrays is sensitive to the acidity and TiCl3 concentration of the precursor solution. We believe that controlling the oxidation and hydrolysis of Ti3+ by using a low TiCl3 concentration (8–40 mM) and low pH (0.71–0.85) is the key to obtaining the nanoplatelet morphology. We also demonstrate the applications of TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays for water-photooxidation and DSSC. As a photoanode for PEC water photo-oxidation, the TiO2 nanoplatelet sample demonstrated excellent charge separation characteristics and a saturated photocurrent under AM 1.5 G illumination of ∼0.4 mA cm−2 reached at an exceptionally low bias of −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.4 VRHE), compared to −0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl for a single crystalline TiO2 rutile nanowire array photoanode.13 Dye sensitized solar cells assembled using N719 dye sensitized-TiO2 nanoplatelet arrays show promising performance with photoconversion efficiencies of 1.28% for as-synthesized and 3.7% for annealed TiO2 nanoplatelets.
