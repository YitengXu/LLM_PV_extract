    , Accepted 12th June 2019First published on 13th June 2019AbstractRecent studies have shown that the two-dimensional semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising thermoelectric (TE) material, whereas its TE performance needs to be further improved. By using first-principles methods combined with semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, we systemically investigate the effects of biaxial strain on the TE transport properties of Bi2O2Se monolayer. Under −2–2% strain, the maximum power factors of 3.63–3.79 and 1.43–1.79 mW m−1 K−2 are found for p-type and n-type doped Bi2O2Se monolayer, respectively. The figure of merit ZT of p-type doped Bi2O2Se monolayer is enhanced to 1.14 by 2% tensile strain at 300 K and it reaches as high as 4.22 at 800 K (as compared with the highest value of 1.42 for bulk Bi2O2Se at 800 K). This study demonstrates that the TE performance of Bi2O2Se can be significantly improved by application of tensile strain and the Bi2O2Se monolayer has great potential as a TE material.
1. Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) materials can convert solar thermal energy and waste heat into electricity, and they have been studied and developed over the past few decades to alleviate the current global energy crisis and greenhouse effect.1–4 The energy conversion efficiency of TE materials can be evaluated by the figure of merit ZT (ZT = S2σT/κ),5 where S, σ, T and κ are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, temperature and thermal conductivity, respectively. Two broad categories of TE materials have been developed: Bi-based,6 for low temperature and Pb-based,7 for moderate temperature. The maximum ZT values of Bi-based and Pb-based bulk materials are about 1.4 at 400 K6 and 1.6 at 700 K,7 respectively. Among them, the ZT values of layered Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 have been improved to more than 1 at room temperature by techniques such as doping, strain, nanostructures, etc.8–10 However, their energy conversion efficiency is still low and further improving the ZT value is necessary for TE applications.
Bismuth oxyselenide Bi2O2Se, a traditional Bi-based TE material, is derived by substituting Se atoms with O atoms in the Bi2Se3 crystal.11–13 Bi2O2Se has excellent optoelectronic, ferroelectric, and ferroelastic properties and is environmentally friendly.14 Besides, the crystal has great potential for application in topological superconductors, Josephson junction field-effect transistors, novel laser devices and so on.15 The experimental investigations performed by Ruleova et al. reported that the ZT value of a Bi2O2Se crystal can reach 0.2 at 800 K16 and has been enhanced to 0.35 at 803 K17 by doping with La atoms. The theoretical studies carried out by Van et al. suggested that the power factor (PF) of a hole-doped (p-type doped) Bi2O2Se crystal is about 10 times larger than that of an electron-doped (n-type doped) system,18 which indicates that p-type doping is more effective than n-type doping to improve the TE performance. Moreover, the ZT of a p-type doped Bi2O2Se crystal can be improved to 1.42 at 800 K by application of strain.19
Apart from doping and applying strain, reducing the dimension is also an important method to modify the ZT.20 Reducing the dimension can decrease the thermal conductivity by decreasing the mean free path of phonons and increasing phonon scatting, e.g., Bi2Te3 nanowires21 and phosphorene monolayers.2 In recent years, a Bi2O2Se atomically thin film (two dimensional Bi2O2Se) with high carrier mobility (∼20000 cm2 V−1 s−1) has been synthesized via facile chemical vapor deposition (CVD).22,23 The band gap and conducting properties of a Bi2O2Se nanosheet can be tuned by doping and strain.24 The surprise is that the Bi2O2Se nanosheet turned out to be an excellent high temperature TE material, since the ZT value of this monolayer can be improved to 3.35 at 800 K via doping carriers.25 However, the maximum ZT of the Bi2O2Se nanosheet at room temperature is only 0.79,25 which is smaller than layered Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. Hence, it is necessary to improve the ZT of the Bi2O2Se nanosheet so that it can work at low or moderate temperature.
Thus far, theoretical attempts to improve the TE performance of Bi2O2Se monolayer are very rare. In this work, the effects of biaxial strain on the TE performance of Bi2O2Se monolayer are studied by employing density functional theory (DFT). We first systematically investigate the electronic transport properties under compressive and tensile strain. Subsequently, the effects of spin–orbit coupling on the electronic structure and power factor of the Bi2O2Se monolayer are explored. The phonon transport coefficients are then calculated and finally the figure of merit of Bi2O2Se monolayer under various strain is obtained. The presented results demonstrate that application of biaxial tensile strain is an effective way to improve the thermoelectric performance of Bi2O2Se monolayer.
2. Computational details
All the first-principles calculations are performed by using density functional theory within a local density approximation (LDA) as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.26–28 It is well known that DFT tends to underestimate the band gap of materials. To obtain a relatively more accurate electronic structure, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional29 is used to describe the exchange–correlation interaction. The kinetic energy cutoff is set at 500 eV. A vacuum space of 15 Å is added along the c-axis direction to avoid the interactions between adjacent layers. The Brillouin zones are sampled with 15 × 15 × 1 (11 × 11 × 11) Monkhorst–Pack special k-point meshes for Bi2O2Se monolayer (bulk). During structural relaxation, all atoms are fully relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman forces are smaller than 0.001 eV Å−1. The electronic transport properties are calculated by employing the semi-classical Boltzmann theory within the relaxation time approximation (RTA) with the BoltzTraP2 code,30 which uses the energy eigenvalues calculated by the VASP code with a denser 21 × 21 × 1 k-point mesh. The calculation of relaxation time (τ) is realized by deformation potential (DP) theory.31 The transport properties of phonon and lattice thermal conductivity are obtained by the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and Slack model with the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA),32 which are realized in the Phonopy package.33
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and electronic properties of bulk and monolayer Bi2O2Se
The Bi2O2Se crystal has a tetragonal structure with space group I4/mmm (No. 139), and it has 10 atoms in the unit cell (as shown in Fig. 1(a)). The optimized lattice parameters of the Bi2O2Se crystal are a = 3.84 Å and c = 12.00 Å, which agree well with the experimental data of a = 3.88 Å and c = 12.16 Å34 and other calculation results of a = 3.92 Å and c = 12.40 Å.25 The structure of the Bi2O2Se monolayer is composed of one bent [Bi2O2]n2n+ layer and two planar [Se]n2n− layers. The outermost [Se]n2n− layers are saturated by hydrogen atoms (as shown in Fig. 1(b)). After full structural relaxation, the optimized lattice parameter of the Bi2O2Se monolayer is 3.95 Å, which is comparable to the calculated result of 4.01 Å25 obtained by the DFT/GGA (generalized gradient approximation) method. A comparison of the theoretical and experimental lattice parameters for bulk and monolayer Bi2O2Se is shown in Table 1.

To study the effects of strain on the thermoelectric properties of Bi2O2Se monolayer, in-plane biaxial strain is applied. The biaxial strain is applied by changing the lattice parameters a and b. The magnitude of the strain is defined by ε = (a − a0)/a0 × 100%, where a0 = 3.95 Å is the optimized lattice parameter of Bi2O2Se monolayer without strain. Corresponding to compressive and tensile biaxial strain, the lattice parameters a and b simultaneously decrease and increase, respectively. Considering the feasibility of the experiment and the stability of the structure, −2–2% biaxial strains are applied to the Bi2O2Se monolayer. The total energy and atomic layer thickness of the Bi2O2Se monolayer under various strains are calculated and the results are tabulated in Table 2. As the strain varies from −2% to 2%, the thickness decreases, accompanied by the increase of the lattice parameter. It is found that the total energy differences between strain states and non-strain states are very small, meaning that the strain states may exist in a stable form.

The effects of strain on the electronic structure of Bi2O2Se monolayer are further investigated. Fig. 2 shows the band structure and density of states (DOS) distribution of the Bi2O2Se monolayer under various strains. The enlarged DOS of the upper valence band and bottom conduction band is plotted in Fig. 3. For the Bi2O2Se monolayer without strain, the band gap is of indirect character with a value of 1.95 eV, which agrees well with experimental data (1.85–1.95 eV)22 and another calculation of 2.16 eV.25 As the strain changes from −2% to 2%, the band gap decreases from 2.18 to 1.73 eV, and the Fermi level decreases from −1.34 to −1.88 eV. In all cases, there are three valence band valleys (i.e., VB1, VB2 and VB3) around the Fermi level with an energy difference less than 0.38 eV (see Fig. 2(c)). Such an energy difference leads to a large slope of DOS distribution near the valence band maximum, as shown in Fig. 2(f). Moreover, the slope of DOS increases when the strain changes from 2% to −2% (see Fig. 3(a)), since the energy difference between VB1, VB2 and VB3 becomes smaller, i.e., from 0.38 to 0.18 eV. For TE materials like PbTe,35 SnSe36,37 and GeAs2,2 the energy differences between valence band valleys have been reported to be 0.15, 0.15 and 0.16 eV, respectively. In Fig. 2(c), three conduction band valleys are also observed, i.e. CBM, CB1 and CB2. The energy differences between CBM, CB1 and CB2 are larger than 1.3 eV for all cases, resulting in a small slope of DOS distribution around the conduction band minimum. Besides, the slope of DOS decreases as the strain varies from −2% to 2%, as shown in Fig. 3(b).

3.2 The Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and power factor of Bi2O2Se monolayer
Based on the calculated electronic structure, the Seebeck coefficient (S) of Bi2O2Se monolayer is studied. Fig. 4 shows the calculated S at 300 K as a function of carrier concentration. It is noted that for a specific carrier concentration, the Seebeck coefficients for p-type doped Bi2O2Se are always larger than the absolute Seebeck coefficients for n-type doped Bi2O2Se. For example, for a carrier concentration of ∼1 × 1012 cm−2, the Seebeck coefficients are ∼560 μV K−1 and ∼−240 μV K−1 for p- and n-type doped Bi2O2Se, respectively. Also, for both n- and p-type doping, the Seebeck coefficients decrease with the increase of carrier concentration, and decrease with the in-plane strain changing from −2% to 2%. In order to explain the differences in the Seebeck coefficients between p-type and n-type doping, the internal relationship between the S and electronic structure are explored. The Seebeck coefficient can be described as follows:19 (1) (2)where Sp and Sn are Seebeck coefficients for p- and n-type doping, respectively, r and e are the scattering mechanism parameter and electron charge, respectively, NV and NC are the effective DOS in the valence band and conduction band, respectively, n and p are the number of electron and hole carriers, respectively, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. According to eqn (1) and (2), one can find that the Seebeck coefficient is proportional to the effective DOS, i.e., the slope of DOS, and inversely related to the carrier concentration. Fig. 2(f) clearly shows that the slope of DOS in the valence band is larger than that in the conduction band around the Fermi level in all cases, which thus results in a larger Seebeck coefficient for p-type doping than n-type doping. Furthermore, because the slope of DOS deceases as the strain changes from −2% to 2%, the compressive strain thus causes a larger Seebeck coefficient of the n- and p-type Bi2O2Se monolayer than tensile strain (see Fig. 4).

The relaxation time τ is required to calculate the electrical conductivity σ.30 However, it is difficult to determine τ because τ depends on both carrier concentration and temperature. By utilizing deformation potential (DP) theory, in combination with the effective mass approximation, τ can be calculated as:31 (3)where ħ and T are the Planck constant and temperature, respectively. The effective mass of the carrier is defined as m* = ħ2/(∂2E/∂k2), and the elastic constant can be given by C = [∂2E/∂(Δa/a0)2]/S0, where E is the total energy of the system under a-axis uniaxial strain. The DP constant E1 is calculated by E1 = ∂Eedge/∂(Δa/a0), where Eedge is the shift of the band edge, and Δa is the change of the lattice parameter relative to the equilibrium lattice parameter. A comparison of our results and other calculations is tabulated in Table 3. Due to the differences in effective masses and DP constants of the electron and hole, the electron mobility of 366 cm2 V−1 s−1 is about 25 times larger than the hole mobility of 12 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. Moreover, the electron relaxation time of 45.7 fs is about 4 times larger than the hole relaxation time of 12 fs. The vacuum energy level correction38 is considered in this calculation, leading to a small difference from the previous DFT/GGA results23 (see Table 3). It should be pointed out that DP theory is based on the scattering process between the acoustic phonons and electrons, and optical phonon scattering and possible impurity scattering are not considered, which may result in the relaxation time, electrical conductivity and ZT value being overestimated at low and medium temperatures.2,39 However, the trend of the change in electrical conductivity and ZT value under strain as revealed in this study will not be affected.

Based on the calculated relaxation time, the electrical conductivity (σ) of Bi2O2Se monolayer is obtained.30Fig. 5 shows the calculated σ at 300 K as a function of carrier concentration under different strain. In each case, the electrical conductivity of n-type doped Bi2O2Se is higher than that of the p-type doped system. This is because the conduction band is more delocalized than the valence band near the Fermi level (see Fig. 2(a)–(e)), resulting in larger electrical conductivity for n-type doping. Similar phenomena have been observed for TE materials like SnSe240 and GeAs2.2 Comparing the effects of strain on the electrical conductivity, we find that the electrical conductivity of p-type doped Bi2O2Se increases as the strain changes from −2% to 2%, while the strain affects the electrical conductivity of n-type doped Bi2O2Se only slightly.

Based on the calculated S and σ, the power factor PF (S2σ) as a function of carrier concentration is further investigated and the results are plotted in Fig. 6. In all cases, the PF value of n-type and p-type doped Bi2O2Se increases first and then decreases with increasing carrier concentration. For p-type doping, the maximum PF values of 3.63–3.79 mW m−1 K−2 under different strains are comparable to each other. In the case of n-type doping, the impact of strain on the maximum PF value is more significant, i.e., varying from 1.79 to 1.43 mW m−1 K−2 as the strain varies from −2% to 2%. It is noted that for each considered strain, the optimal PF values for p-type doping are always higher than those for n-type doping due to the larger Seebeck coefficient, indicating that p-type doping is more effective than n-type doping to improve the TE performance in Bi2O2Se monolayer, similar to the case of the bulk phase.18,19 As compared with the highest PF value of 0.95 mW m−1 K−2 for bulk Bi2O2Se under 2.3% tensile strain at room temperature,19 the maximum PF value of 3.71 mW m−1 K−2 for Bi2O2Se monolayer under 2% tensile strain is about four times larger, suggesting that one can enhance the PF value of Bi2O2Se by reducing the dimension and application of strain.

Due to the existence of a heavy metal element, Bi, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects in Bi2O2Se may be non-negligible. A comparison of the PF values for Bi2O2Se monolayer with and without SOC effects is shown in Fig. 7. It is found that for the n-type doped system, the power factor with SOC effects at each temperature is about 2 times larger than that without SOC effects. In the case of p-type doping, the SOC effects become more significant with increasing temperature. Similar phenomena have been observed for TE materials like SnSe2, ZrS2 and ZrSe2 monolayers.40 To explore the origin of these phenomena, the band structure and DOS distribution of Bi2O2Se monolayer with and without SOC effects are analyzed, as shown in Fig. 8. It turns out that consideration of SOC effects influences the bottom conduction band more remarkably than the valence band maximum, which thus results in more considerable changes in the Seebeck coefficient and PF values for n-type doping. These results suggest that the SOC effects are not negligible. Consequently, all the calculations are carried out with SOC effects considered.

3.3 Thermal transport properties of Bi2O2Se monolayer
The effects of strain on the thermal conductivity are also discussed. The total thermal conductivity consists of two parts: electronic thermal conductivity (κe) and lattice thermal conductivity (κl). The electronic thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity are related by the Wiedemann–Franz law:41,42κe = LσT, where the Lorentz constant L takes the value of 2.4 × 108 WΩ K−2. The calculated electronic thermal conductivity at 300 K as a function of carrier concentration is shown in Fig. 9. Since κe and σ are linearly correlated, the influences of strain on the electronic thermal conductivity are similar to those on the electrical conductivity (see Fig. 5).
 Fig. 9  The electrical thermal conductivity (κe) for both p-type (a) and n-type (b) Bi2O2Se monolayer at 300 K as a function of carrier concentration under strain. 
To calculate the lattice thermal conductivity, the Slack equation43 is employed: (4)where , δ and N are the average mass of the atoms, lattice size and number of atoms in the cell, respectively. The Grüneisen parameter γ is calculated by employing the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA):44 (5)where α, B, and Vm are the linear thermal expansion coefficient, bulk modulus, and molar volume, respectively, and CV is the isometric heat capacity. The calculated Grüneisen parameter as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 10(e). It is shown that the temperature has little effect on γ, and the calculated result is used in the lattice thermal conductivity calculation. In eqn (4), the Debye temperature ΘD is calculated based on isotropic approximation,44i.e., (6)where ΘZA, ΘTA and ΘLA are the Debye temperatures of the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) branch, transverse acoustic (TA) branches and longitudinal acoustic (LA) branch, respectively. Θi (i = ZA, TA, LA) is defined as44 Θi = ħωmaxi/kB,(7)where ωmaxi is the maximum frequency of the ith mode. The calculated phonon spectra along high symmetry directions are plotted in Fig. 10(a)–(e). It is shown that the maximum frequency of acoustic phonon modes decreases from 2.1 THz to 1.8 THz as the strain changes from −2% to 2%. Such a low frequency indicates a low group velocity of acoustic branches and low Debye temperature. The Debye temperature of Bi2O2Se monolayer as a function of strain is shown in Fig. 11(a). ΘD is found to decrease from 18.25 K to 13.29 K with strain changing from −2% to 2%. For bulk Bi2O2Se, the Debye temperature has been calculated to be 18.23 K and 19.39 K by Liu et al. using DFT/LDA and DFT/GGA methods, respectively.45 The decrease in the Debye temperature with the strain varying from −2% to 2% indicates that under tensile strain, more phonon modes may be activated, and a higher phonon scattering rate and lower lattice thermal conductivity may result.

The calculated lattice thermal conductivity of Bi2O2Se monolayer at 300 K as a function of carrier concentration under various strains is shown in Fig. 11(b). For Bi2O2Se monolayer without strain, the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.83 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature is close to the calculated result of 0.66 W m−1 K−1,25 and smaller than the value of 1.14 W m−1 K−1 for bulk Bi2O2Se.3 The decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity of the Bi2O2Se monolayer as compared to its bulk phase is because the average free path of a phonon can be effectively reduced by nanostructures.3 It is also found that the lattice thermal conductivity decreases with the increase of temperature, which may result from an increase of phonon scattering at high temperature. The lowest lattice thermal conductivity is 0.18 W m−1 K−1 at 800 K under 2% tensile strain. Besides, the lattice thermal conductivity decreases rapidly as the strain ranges from −2% to 2%. For example, the lattice thermal conductivity of 0.48 W m−1 K−1 under 2% strain at room temperature is decreased by 42% as compared to that without strain. This is mainly due to the fact that the Debye temperature is reduced by varying the strain from −2% to 2%. These results imply that application of strain is an effective method to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of Bi2O2Se monolayer.
In computer simulation of thermo-electric properties of two-dimensional materials, hydrogen atoms are generally introduced to passivate surface dangling bonds.14,24,25 In order to test if the surface termination with hydrogen will affect the thermo-electric transport properties of Bi2O2Se monolayer, the atomic projected density of states distribution and phonon spectra with contributions from each element of the Bi2O2Se monolayer without strain are plotted in Fig. 12(a) and (b), respectively. The thermoelectric transport properties of materials are mainly determined by two factors. The first one is the behavior of electrons around the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum. As shown in Fig. 12(a), the H orbitals are mainly located in the energy range of −6.7–−2.3 eV and 3.7–8 eV in the valence and conduction bands, respectively, i.e., the hydrogen atoms have no contribution to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, suggesting that the introduced hydrogen atoms will affect the electrical conductivity and electron thermal conductivity slightly. The second factor is the acoustic branch of the phonon spectra, because the lattice thermal conductivity is obtained from the maximum frequencies of the acoustic branches.43,44 As shown in Fig. 12(b) and 10(c), the hydrogen atoms contribute a lot to the optical branch of the phonon spectra and nearly have no contribution to the acoustic branches, indicating that the appearance of hydrogen atoms will not affect the lattice thermal conductivity. Hence, surface termination of the Bi2O2Se monolayer with hydrogen has negligible effects on its thermoelectric properties.

3.4 The figure of merit of Bi2O2Se monolayer
On the basis of electronic and thermal transport coefficients, the ZT values of Bi2O2Se monolayer are estimated. The calculated ZT as a function of carrier concentration at 300 K is shown in Fig. 13. The maximum ZT values for p-type doping are found to be larger than the maximum ZT values for n-type doping under each considered strain, mainly resulting from the large Seebeck coefficient for p-type doping. Under 2% strain, the optimal ZT value of 1.14 for a p-type doped system is found to be close to the largest ZT value (1.4–1.6) of a low temperature TE material, Bi2Se3.8–10 It is noted that the p-type doped system needs a higher carrier concentration than the n-type doped system to achieve the maximum ZT value. An interesting finding is that the tensile strain can effectively reduce the optimal doping concentration for both p- and n-type doped systems. For example, the optimal doping concentration is reduced from ∼6.3 × 1013 to ∼2.1 × 1013 cm−2 for p-type doping and from ∼1.9 × 1012 to ∼1.3 × 1012 cm−2 for n-type doping as the strain varies from −2% to 2%. Fig. 14 shows the ZT value as a function of temperature. The results show that the ZT values over the whole considered temperature range for both p- and n-type doped Bi2O2Se are enhanced by tensile strain, which is due to the great decrease of lattice thermal conductivity with increasing temperature. As compared with the cases without strain, the optimal ZT values of p- and n-type Bi2O2Se monolayer under 2% tensile strain could be improved by 44–26% and 32–27% as the temperature varies from 300 to 800 K, respectively. For example, the ZT value of the p-type doped Bi2O2Se monolayer increases from 1.36 to 1.83 at 400 K when applying 2% tensile strain. At a temperature of 800 K, the optimal ZT value of the p-type doped Bi2O2Se monolayer under 2% tensile strain is as high as 4.22. Such a high ZT value is even larger than the ZT value of 2.6 (at 923 K) for the high temperature TE material SnSe.46 As compared with the maximum theoretical ZT value of 1.42 for bulk Bi2O2Se under strain,19 the largest ZT value of 4.22 for Bi2O2Se monolayer at 800 K is about three times higher. This study thus demonstrates that the TE performance of Bi2O2Se monolayer can be effectively improved by p-type doping, reducing the dimension and application of biaxial tensile strain.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the effects of strain on the thermoelectric transport properties of Bi2O2Se monolayer are investigated by utilizing density functional theory in combination with the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equation and the Slack model. The electronic and phonon transport properties of Bi2O2Se monolayer under strain are discussed in detail with a focus on the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, power factor and thermal conductivity. Our calculations show that the influences of spin–orbit coupling on the electronic transport properties of the Bi2O2Se monolayer are non-negligible. Consideration of −2–2% strain modifies the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) significantly and the effective density of states for the VBM under each strain is larger than that for the CBM, resulting in larger Seebeck coefficients for p-type doped Bi2O2Se monolayer compared to n-type doping. Besides, compressive strain causes larger a Seebeck coefficient than that of tensile strain. The electrical conductivity of p-type doped Bi2O2Se monolayer is found to be smaller than that of n-type doping. As the strain changes from −2% to 2%, the electrical conductivity of p- and n-type doped Bi2O2Se monolayer increases and changes slightly, respectively. A synergetic effect of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity results in the maximum PF value of 3.63–3.79 mW m−1 K−2 for p-type doping and 1.43–1.79 mW m−1 K−2 for n-type doping under −2–2% strain. These results suggest that p-type doping is more effective than n-type doping to enhance the power factor of Bi2O2Se monolayer. With the strain varying from −2% to 2%, the lattice thermal conductivity of Bi2O2Se monolayer decreases considerably, and it is much smaller than that of bulk Bi2O2Se, indicating that dimension reduction and application of strain are effective techniques to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of Bi2O2Se. At the temperature of 300–800 K, the maximum figure of merit values for p-type doping are larger than those for n-type doping. Especially, tensile strain increases the ZT values significantly. The maximum ZT values of 4.22 at 800 K and 1.14 at 300 K under 2% tensile strain could be improved by 26% and 44%, respectively. These results propose that dimension reduction, p-type doping and application of tensile strain are all beneficial to improve the thermoelectric properties of Bi2O2Se.
