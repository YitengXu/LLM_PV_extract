    , Accepted 11th June 2021First published on 11th June 2021AbstractDistinct from CsSnI3 perovskite systems, the most stable non-centrosymmetric trigonal structure (space group of R3m) of the CsGeI3 perovskite system was found in our calculations. We systematically studied the differences between two all-inorganic perovskites (CsSnI3 and CsGeI3) and proposed an unexpected distorted stable structure of the mixed Sn–Ge perovskite system (CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3). All calculations of structural configuration and electronic properties were performed in the projector augmented-wave density-functional theory framework via the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). We found that the energy band evolutions of all-inorganic perovskites CsSnxGe1−xI3 are completely different from those of the Sn–Pb perovskite compounds. After considering the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect, the bandgap evolution of the stable structure shows a linear change. The results unravel the previous controversial understanding of the atomic and electronic properties of Ge-based perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of remarkable organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells has risen to 25.5%.1 However, the instability and toxicity caused by the organic and lead components are the main challenges on the way to realizing its large-scale commercialization. Therefore, all-inorganic perovskite solar cells with comparable efficiencies (20.37%)2 have attracted increasing attention due to their advantages of high thermal and light stability.3,4 Considering a low-toxic or nontoxic inorganic perovskite, Sn(II)5 and Ge(II),6 Ca(II),7 Bi(III),8 Sr(II)9 cations were used to replace Pb cations. Among these candidates, Sn-based halide perovskite solar cells were observed to have high efficiency but poor stability due to the oxidation of the Sn element.10,11 Until 2019, Chen et al. reported a power conversion efficiency of 7.11% for the Ge–Sn mixed perovskite (CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3) with good stability.12 However, a theoretical study of the structural and electronic properties of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 has not been investigated.
In 1982, Guen et al. were the first to synthesize and study the CsGeI3 crystals and found that they had a phase transition of R3m at the temperature of 290 °C.13 Subsequently, Thiele et al. also synthesized trigonal R3m CsGeI3 crystals at room temperature.14 In the R3m CsGeI3 unit cell, Cs and I ions form a slightly distorted cube that is more closely packed. Ge ions move from the center to one side of the GeI6 octahedron, thus forming three short-distance and three long-distance Ge–I bonds, respectively.15 The distortion of the R3m structure resulted in non-centrosymmetry, and caused unique nonlinear optical properties.16,17 Although the R3m structures of CsGeI3 have been extensively studied, there are still controversial discussions on the most stable structure. However, another structural symmetry of CsGeI3 (space group of Pmmm) was reported in previous theoretical calculations as the stable one, but has not yet been synthesized experimentally.15 Different crystal structures would have significant effects on the optoelectronic properties.
This article intends to theoretically reveal the structural properties of CsGeI3 and CsSnI3. Based on the density functional theory, the atomic and electronic properties of the CsSnxGe1−xI3 perovskite are systematically studied. We found that two crystal structures (R3m, Pmmm) of CsGeI3 can exist stably in our calculations. The R3m phase is the most stable structure, while the Pmmm phase is the metastable structure according to their total energies. However, in a pure Sn-based system, the crystal symmetry of the most stable structure is completely different. Its most stable structure has the P4/mbm symmetry. In addition, it is found that Sn and Ge ions aggregate respectively in mixed Sn–Ge perovskite compounds, and the structural phase transition of CsSnxGe1−xI3 systems appears as the ratio of Sn composition increases. Interestingly, we found an abnormal band gap evolution of the CsSnxGe1−xI3 system, which is different from the mixed Sn–Pb perovskite system.18
Methods
All of the first-principle calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)19 based on density functional theory (DFT). We chose Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as the exchange correlation function. The pseudo-potential is considered in calculations through the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method.20 The cut-off energy of plane waves was set at 500 eV for high accuracy. A 2 × 2 × 2 supercell is used to calculate the mixed tin and germanium halide perovskites. Six high-symmetric k-points were included for band structure calculations: Γ (0, 0, 0), V/S (1/2, 1/2, 0), Y (0, 1/2, 0), Z (0, 0, 1/2), U/F (1/2, 0, 1/2), T (0, 1/2, 1/2). All the structures were relaxed with a conjugate-gradient algorithm until the energy on the ions was less than 1.0 × 10−6 eV and all forces were minimized to 0.001 eV Å−1. In addition, spin–orbital coupling (SOC)21,22 had a certain influence on the electronic structures of these perovskites; therefore, GGA + SOC functional was considered in the band structure calculations. All crystal structures were constructed using the VESTA program.23
Results and discussion
To clarify the most stable state of the Ge-based perovskite system, we systematically investigated three different crystal structures. Fig. 1 shows three structures of CsGeI3 and CsSnI3, and the corresponding space groups are R3m, Pmmm, and P4/mbm. By comparing the total energy of six structures (listed in Table 1), we found that the most stable structure of CsGeI3 has a non-centrosymmetric trigonal symmetry (space group R3m), while the stable one of CsSnI3 has an orthorhombic symmetry (space group P4/mbm). Furthermore, we noticed that the structures in the space groups Pmmm and P4/mbm have close energies whether it is Ge-based or Sn-based perovskite. However, there is a noticeable energy difference between centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric structures, which provide us with the understanding that the stable structure of mixed CsSnxGe1−xI3 has a non-centrosymmetric trigonal symmetry when the ratio of Ge is increased. The optimized lattice parameters of CsGeI3 (space group R3m) are a = 6.09 Å, b = 6.09 Å, and c = 6.09 Å, and those of CsSnI3 (space group P4/mbm) are a = 8.82 Å, b = 8.82 Å, and c = 6.30 Å. In the most stable CsGeI3 system, Ge ions deviate from the center of the octahedron. The difference in structures between R3m and P4/mbm phases is clearly seen in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively.

Furthermore, we systematically studied CsGeI3 and CsSnI3 systems in different space groups R3m and P4/mbm. Through calculations, we found that the phase change behavior is related to a scale factor x appearing in the CsSnxGe1−xI3 system, while Ge and Sn ions aggregate together respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 2(d) that the energy fitting lines of R3m and P4/mbm intersect at x = 0.625. This means that the energy of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 with the space group R3m and P4/mbm is approximately equal and the phase transition occurs at x = 0.5.

(d) Trend of the calculated energy of CsSnxGe1−xI3 as a function of composition x. (e) Trend of the volume of CsSnxGe1−xI3 as a function of composition x. 
In addition, the distorted stable structure of the mixed Sn–Ge perovskite system (CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3) is proposed in our calculations, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The structural distortion is related to the aggregation distribution of Sn and Ge ions in our calculations. Compared with the other two metastable structures shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), a different atomic distribution is observed in the most stable configuration. Noticeably, the stable structures show a distorted octahedral unit and the Sn (Ge) ions deviate from the center of the octahedron in Fig. 2(a). Both octahedral distortion and non-centrosymmetric deviation will help the stable structures possess the lowest total energies among three structures. According to Vegard's law, we found that the volume change in the stable structure is linear in Fig. 2(e), which is similar to that of the R3m and P4/mbm structures.
In order to systematically investigate the electronic configurations of the mixed Sn–Ge perovskite system (CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3), the total density of states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) were calculated using the GGA + SOC method (Fig. 3). At the ratio of x = 0.5, the band gap of the system is mainly determined by the s, p orbitals of Ge ions and Sn ions. We noticed that the projected density of states of the stable structure is slightly different from the other two systems. Alternatively, the s and p orbitals of Ge and Sn are deeper than those of the other systems (R3m, P4/mbm), resulting in a larger band gap (0.801 eV). Although the orbital composition of the conduction band and valance band are similar, the band gap value shows an obvious difference. The most stable structure has the biggest band gap due to the different crystal symmetry and ion distribution of Sn/Ge in the mixed compound, which is much larger than the those with metastable structures.

Subsequently, we calculated the projected band structure of CsSn0.25Ge0.75I3, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, and CsSn0.75Ge0.25I3 of the stable systems and space group P4/mbm shown in Fig. 4(a)–(f) using the GGA + SOC method. The I-p, Sn-s, Sn-p, Ge-s, and Ge-p orbitals are marked in green, orange, purple, red, and blue, respectively. It can be seen that the band gap of the CsSnxGe1−xI3 (R3m) system calculated by the GGA + SOC method decreases with the increase in the Sn composition, but is different from the gradual change in the CsSnxGe1−xI3 (P4/mbm) system. By projecting energy band structures, it can be observed that the I-p, Sn-s and Ge-s orbitals contribute to the valence band maximum (VBM), while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly determined by the Sn-p and Ge-p orbitals.

In order to study the evolution of the band gap specifically, we performed a series of energy band calculations on CsSnxGe1−xI3, and obtained the band gap evolutions with different compositional ratios. Taking into account the Sn–Ge alloyed system, we performed a quantitative fit to the band gap curve according to Vegard's law. Quantitative fitting is based on the following relationship:24–26 Eg(A1−xBx) = (1 − x)Eg(A) + xEg(B) − bx(1 − x)(1)where x and 1 − x represent the ratio of Sn and Ge components in the system, respectively, and b is the bending coefficient. We fitted the trend of the band gap of the three systems. Among them, the trends of the stable structure and the R3m structure were linearly fitted, while that of the P4/mbm structure was fitted with a curve according to the eqn (1). However, as shown in Table 2, it has a small bowing parameter (b = 0.20). Fig. 5 shows the evolution trend of the band gap under different Sn composition ratios. For the CsSnxGe1−xI3 system (stable structure), Sn and Ge ions are clustered. Also, with the increase in the Sn composition, the band gap decreases almost linearly, from 0.931 eV to 0.710 eV. However, in the CsSnxGe1−xI3 system (P4/mbm), the situation is completely different and the band gap trend is not obvious. It can be seen that the fitted band gap line of the distorted stable structure shows a linear trend, which is different from the Sn–Pb alloyed system.18 We previously investigated the all-inorganic mixed Sn–Pb system and found that its band gap evolution follows a nonlinear trend with bowing parameter b = 0.35.18 However, in the mixed Sn–Ge system, the band gap evolution of the stable distorted system and R3m space group shows a linear trend. It is worth noting that the linear trend of the stable system is affected by the non-centrosymmetric structure and atomic aggregation effect of Sn/Ge ions. Even considering the Sn–Ge system in P4/mbm without aggregated Sn/Ge ions, a smaller bowing parameter (b = 0.20) is observed. Therefore, the band gap evolution of the all-inorganic Sn–Ge mixed system is different from that of the mixed Sn–Pb system due to the spatial distribution of Sn–Ge ions and the off-center structural characteristics.

 Fig. 5  Calculated band gap evolutions of CsSnxGe1−xI3 as a function of composition x using the GGA + SOC method. 
In order to unravel the unusual band evolutions in the stable structures, the band edge variation as a function of composition (x-ratio) are further investigated, as shown in Fig. S4.† By comparing the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) curves, we found that the CBM/VBM of the R3m system varies greatly as the proportional coefficient changes, while the CBM/VBM of the P4/mbm system changes slightly. The moderate variation of the stable structure is related to the symmetry of the system and the deviation of central ions. The central atom deviation and octahedral distortion will take effect simultaneously in the stable systems, so the band gap change is distinct from the R3m system and P4/mbm system.
Conclusion
In summary, we systematically studied the structure and electronic properties of the all-inorganic perovskites CsSnxGe1−xI3. Our calculations show that the stable structure of CsGeI3 is the R3m space group, and there is a metastable structure with a space group of Pmmm. For all-inorganic perovskites CsSnxGe1−xI3, with the increase in the Sn composition, a clear phase transition from R3m to P4/mbm appears when the ratio of Sn is 0.625. Surprisingly, based on GGA + SOC calculations, the band gap evolution of the distorted stable structures of the mixed Sn–Ge perovskite system shows a linear trend. The results unravel the structural and electronic properties of Ge-based perovskites.
