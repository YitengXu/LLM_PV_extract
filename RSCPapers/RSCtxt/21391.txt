    , Accepted 2nd September 2022First published on 7th September 2022AbstractDirect Z-scheme heterojunctions are widely used for photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction due to facilitating well-separated photogenerated charge carriers and spatial isolation of redox reactions. Here, using a facile two-step hydrothermal and ion-exchange method, we uniformly decorate silver orthophosphate (i.e., Ag3PO4) quantum dots with an average characteristic size of ∼10 nm over tin(IV) sulphide (i.e., SnS2) nanosheets to form a 0D/2D heterojunction. The direct Z-scheme mechanism, i.e. charge transport for efficient electron (from SnS2) and hole (from Ag3PO4) recombination, is confirmed by the following experiments: (i) ultraviolet and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies; (ii) photodeposition of Pt and PbO2 nanoparticles on reduction and oxidation sites, respectively; (iii) in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; and (iv) electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Owing to the photoreduction properties of Ag3PO4 with orthophosphate vacancies, Z-scheme charge carrier transfer, and efficient exciton dissociation, an optimized heterojunction shows a high CO2-to-CO reduction yield of 18.3 μmol g−1 h−1 with an illustrious selectivity of ∼95% under light illumination, which is about 3.0 and 47.8 times larger than that of Ag3PO4 and SnS2, respectively. The carbon source for the CO product is verified using a 13CO2 isotopic experiment. Moreover, by tracing the peak at ∼1190 cm−1 in the dark and under light irradiation, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy demonstrates that the CO2 reduction pathway goes through the COOH* intermediate.
1. Introduction
Human activities continue to emit carbon dioxide (CO2) due to fossil fuel consumption, resulting in rising global temperature, climate changes, and endangering of lives.1 Artificial photosynthesis has been proposed as an effective and green method to address this issue, albeit by mimicking natural biochemical reactions.2,3 Accordingly, several strategies such as photochemical (PC),4–9 photoelectrochemical (PEC),10–13 and electrochemical (EC)14–16 zero-carbon methods have been proposed to directly transform solar energy into chemical energy. Among these strategies, the PC CO2 reduction as an autonomous (or wireless) method is attractive because the CO2 reduction reaction does neither need a sacrificial agent nor external electricity.17 As a milestone study, Inoue et al. have kindled the first sparks by the PC activation of CO2 molecules over various semiconductors. Years later and after “nano” came into the picture, low-dimensional nanomaterials and their heterojunctions have attracted attention as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.18–23 On this subject, the most substantial steps are light absorption, exciton dissociation, charge transport, adsorption of CO2 and H2O molecules on the surface, and charge transfer to the adsorbed molecules – i.e., CO2 and H2O should be reduced and oxidized by electron and hole carriers, respectively.24–27 Nevertheless, well-designed semiconducting nanostructures exhibiting step-scheme (S-scheme) and direct Z-scheme heterojunctions,28–32 if realized, can effectively address the abovementioned steps.
Among the numerous semiconducting materials, silver orthophosphate (Ag3PO4) behaves as an n-type and p-type semiconductor under the O-poor and O-rich conditions, respectively. Besides, the direct band transition with a gap of ∼2.4 eV leads Ag3PO4 as a potential candidate for PC application.33 In 2010, Yi et al. demonstrated the excellent photooxidation properties of the Ag3PO4 photocatalyst for PEC water splitting as well as PC dye degradation under visible light irradiation.34 Besides, they showed that the conduction band minimum of Ag3PO4 is lower than the water reduction level, implying that this material cannot reduce water. Single-crystalline Ag3PO4 rhombic dodecahedrons with {110} facets have exhibited much higher PC activities than cubes with {100} facets for degradation of methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RhB) dyes, emphasizing the impact of the morphology on the PC activity.35 So, heterostructuring of nanostructured Ag3PO4 with other semiconducting materials, with suitable reduction properties, has been demonstrated to be a promising approach for improving the PC performance. For example, the Ag3PO4/g-C3N4 Z-scheme heterojunction has displayed a CO2 conversion rate 6.1 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4.36 The Ag/Ag3PO4/CeO2 Z-scheme heterojunction has provided hydrocarbon products with yields about 2.7 and 5 times higher than that with CeO2 and Ag3PO4, respectively.37 This work has proposed that Ag works as a fast-quenching bridge between electrons (on Ag3PO4) and holes (on CeO2), which results in abundant electrons in CeO2 for CO2 reduction. Recently, the Ag3PO4/TiO2 heterojunction has shown an efficient CO2-to-CO reduction with a CO yield of 3.5 and 11.7 times higher than that with Ag3PO4 and TiO2, respectively.38 Notably, all these studies have been performed based on the photooxidation properties of the orthophosphate semiconductor. So, the potential of Ag3PO4 as a photoreduction active material is not well studied in the literature.
In this study, using an ion-exchange method, 0D Ag3PO4 quantum dots were deposited on the as-prepared 2D tin(IV) sulphide SnS2 nanosheets – notably, 2D SnS2 nanosheets were synthesized via a hydrothermal method in advance. Our results show that the photocatalytic performance of the 0D/2D heterojunction was significantly enhanced, compared with the pristine materials, due to the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism and short diffusion length of photogenerated charge carriers. Here, SnS2 nanosheets have three roles: (i) water oxidation sites as recently confirmed by Yin et al.;39 (ii) high-surface-area scaffolds for Ag3PO4 quantum dots as photoreduction sites; and (iii) preventing the charge recombination by forming a built-in electric field at the interface resulting in a Z-scheme heterojunction. In this regard, the direct Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism was confirmed by photochemical and (in situ) optical experiments. The results shed light on the charge transfer at the heterointerface and redox-active sites. Finally, the activation of CO2 molecules over Ag3PO4 was investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. The DRIFT spectroscopy determined that the COOH* intermediate plays a key role in the selective production of CO. Our results re-open the door for studying the photoreduction properties of the semiconducting Ag3PO4 material, which have not been observed before. Besides, this work provided a clear picture of engineering low-dimensional materials by heterostructuring for efficient PC CO2 reduction through the Z-scheme mechanism, which can be applied in other applications such as PEC water splitting and PC dye degradation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4, 5H2O), L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and sodium phosphate (Na3PO4) all were from Arcos chemicals with 99.9999% purity, and ethanol (purity 99.50%) was from CHONEYE2. All chemicals and solvents were used as received without any additional purification.
2.2. Synthesis of SnS2 nanosheets
SnS2 nanosheets were prepared by a hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, 1 mM of SnCl4ꞏ5H2O and 5 mM C3H7NO2S were added to 60 ml of distilled water and gradually dispersed to form a homogeneous solution by vigorous magnetic stirring for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, the resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 230 °C for 24 hours. After the hydrothermal reaction, the sample was naturally cooled to room temperature. The resulting product was collected by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min and washed several times with ethanol and distilled water. Finally, the collected yellow-green SnS2 powder was freeze-dried and degassed in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight.
2.3. Synthesis of Ag3PO4 nanoparticles
Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were prepared by an ion-exchange method. In the procedure, 90 mM AgNO3 is dissolved in 40 ml of distilled water. Then, 30 mM Na3PO4 was added into the prepared solution and stirred with a magnet for 2 hours at room temperature. The resulting product was collected by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min and washed several times with ethanol and distilled water. Finally, the collected yellow Ag3PO4 powder was freeze-dried overnight.
2.4. Synthesis of the SnS2/Ag3PO4 heterostructure
Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructures were prepared by a two-step method, i.e., (i) synthesis of SnS2 nanosheets via a hydrothermal method followed by (ii) decoration of Ag3PO4 quantum dots by a surface ion-exchange process. Briefly, 100 mg as-prepared SnS2 powder and 30 mM AgNO3 solution were mixed at room temperature in the dark. Next, the resulting product was collected by centrifugation and added to 90 mM Na3PO4. The resulting product was collected by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min and washed several times with ethanol and distilled water, and freeze-dried overnight.
2.5. Material characterization
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the powder samples were measured with a Jasco V-670 spectrophotometer using an integrated sphere. The crystal structures were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (Bruker, D2 PHASER with XFlash). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrometer with a PIKE IRIS ATR attachment and a diamond crystal holder. The Raman spectra were obtained using a Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800 system with a laser source of 532 nm. The surface morphology and elemental compositions of all samples were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL 6700F) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS; Inca Energy 400). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; JEOL JEM-2100F) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; OXFORD X-Max) were conducted to identify the microstructure and elemental compositions, respectively. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer Physical Electronics (PHI 5400 spectrometer) with monochromatic Al Kα as the exciting source and equipped with a helium discharge lamp. To eliminate the charging/substrate effect, the powder samples were uniformly pressed onto indium foil and a nitrogen flow gun was used to blow away excess powder; this procedure was repeated several times to make sure that the powders were fully covered on indium foil. The peak positions of XPS spectra were calibrated carefully with respect to the indium 3d peak. Meanwhile, peak fitting procedures were followed by the active Shirley method with a Gaussian–Lorentzian spectral line shape. The work function (Φ) and valence band maxima (VBM) values of the samples were determined by the secondary cutoff edge and near Fermi edge. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-4). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) was carried out using time-correlated single-photon counting. A pulsed laser with a wavelength of 405 nm, duration of 250 fs, and repetition frequency of 20 MHz was used as the excitation source for the steady-state PL and TRPL studies. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker EMX-10/12 spectrometer working at an x-band frequency at 77 K under vacuum. Samples with a controlled amount (150 mg) were loaded in the EPR tubes and then degassed under vacuum at 90 °C for 6 h. The measurements were set at the center field of 3400 G and a sweep width of 200 G. The microwave frequency was 9.49 GHz, and the power was 15.0 mW. In the DRIFT spectroscopy, CO2 gas passed through a deionized water (18 MΩ) container, i.e., CO2 + H2O vapor condition, under irradiation using a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer with a HgCdTe detector.6,19 The three-window DRIFT cell allowed gas purging through the sample and light irradiation (100 W halogen lamp). The spectral resolution of the DRIFTS study was 4 cm−1, and the time resolution was 30 s. The DRIFT sample contained 4 mg (2 wt%) of studied materials mixed with dry potassium bromide (KBr). Before collecting the background spectra, the measured sample in the DRIFT cell was purged with argon gas for 60 min to remove residual gas from the DRIFT cell. Afterward, CO2 + H2O vapor was purged into the DRIFT cell for 1 h followed by collecting the spectra, as the background level. Finally, the DRIFT spectra were monitored for 4 h under light irradiation.
2.6. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
The hydrocarbon products from the photoreduction of CO2 were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The GC was performed on a GC-HID-FID model SRI 8610C system using a micro packed column (ShinCarbon ST) and fused silica column (Stabilwax). The injection temperatures of the helium ionization detector (HID) and flame ionization detector (FID) were 160 and 220 °C, respectively. We have performed the blank tests as recently suggested by Qorbani et al.:40 (i) with photocatalyst/with CO2/without light, (ii) with photocatalyst/without CO2/with light, and (iii) without photocatalyst/with CO2/with light. Finally, these values have been subtracted from the product yield in the photocatalytic reaction. For the gas product verification, the isotope-labeling experiments were conducted by using 13CO2, and gas products were separated using a Molecular Sieve 5A packed GC column. Finally, the gas products were analyzed through GC/mass spectroscopy (Thermo, Model: Trace 1300GC + ISQ MS).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optical properties and lattice structures
The optical properties of the SnS2, Ag3PO4, and Ag3PO4/SnS2 were investigated using UV-visible spectra (Fig. 1a). These spectra show absorption edges at ∼502 and ∼484 nm for Ag3PO4 and SnS2 consistent with the previous reports, respectively.35,41 Furthermore, the Ag3PO4 spectrum shows a long (Urbach) tail, which can be assigned to the presence of defect states in the electronic structure due to the high concentration of the orthophosphate vacancies (Table S1†).42 Fig. S1† shows non-normalized UV-visible absorption spectra. For the region at ∼500 nm, the light absorption capacity of the heterojunction falls in between those of the two single components. Moreover, the Ag3PO4/SnS2 depicts a much more intense absorption tail that could be assigned to the mid-gap states formed at the heterointerface or the surface of the Ag3PO4 quantum dots – notably, the surface-to-volume ratio of semiconducting quantum dots is much larger than that of the bulk, resulting in the introduction of surface defect states.43–46 Besides, Tauc plots show that the band gaps of Ag3PO4 and SnS2 are 2.47 and 2.56 eV, respectively (inset of Fig. 1a). XRD patterns were recorded to determine the crystal structures. Fig. 1b shows that crystal structures of Ag3PO4 and SnS2 are cubic (JCPDS no. 06-0505) and hexagonal berndtite-2T (JCPDS no. 23-0677), respectively. It further reveals a high crystallinity level of the decorated 0D Ag3PO4 quantum dots on the 2D SnS2 nanosheets (see the high-resolution microstructure images in the following text).

The Tauc plots, with the direct transitions fittings, and standard XRD patterns of Ag3PO4 and SnS2 are shown in the inset of (a) and (b), respectively. F(r) and hν are the Kubelka–Munk function and photon energy in the Tauc plot, respectively. 

Fig. 1c shows the FTIR spectra of the prepared samples. (i) Case Ag3PO4: the intense peak ∼940 cm−1 is attributed to the P–O stretching vibration mode of PO43−.36 The extended region from 1300 to 3000 cm−1 exhibits several minor intermolecular bonded species, wherein the two peaks at 1644 and 1865 cm−1 correspond to the O–H bending and C–O stretching mode, respectively.47,48 (ii) Case SnS2: the peaks at 1371/1440, 1750, and 2920/2963 cm−1 can be attributed to the CH2 bending mode,49 CO esters stretching,50 and C–H stretching,51 respectively. Moreover, the broad peaks in the region from 3000 to 4000 cm−1 are assigned to the O–H or N–H stretching.6,52 (iii) Case Ag3PO4/SnS2: it shows the same characteristic peaks of the Ag3PO4 and SnS2. However, the intensities of the CH2 bending and CO ester peaks are significantly decreased, suggesting that adventitious carbon-based species were eliminated during the surface ion-exchange process. Raman scattering experiments were conducted to provide the lattice vibrational frequencies of the samples. As shown in Fig. 1d, the Raman spectrum of Ag3PO4 depicts several peaks at 909, 710, 419/552, and 236 cm−1, assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration of the phosphate group,53 bending vibration modes of P–O–P bonds,54 and rotation or translation of the phosphate group, respectively. Nevertheless, the Raman spectrum of SnS2 shows an intense and weak peak at 314 and 206 cm−1, which are assigned to the A1g and Eg vibration modes of SnS2, respectively. The Raman spectrum of Ag3PO4/SnS2 presents similar peaks of the Ag3PO4 and SnS2 materials. This spectrum also shows an additional peak at ∼960 cm−1 assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the O–P–O bond.55 Notably, this peak emerged as a bump in the Ag3PO4 spectrum. These results confirm the presence of a physical junction between 0D Ag3PO4 quantum dots and 2D SnS2 nanosheets.
3.2. Morphologies and microstructures
The morphologies of the synthesized powders were investigated using TEM images. Fig. S2a and b† show that the pristine Ag3PO4 has an irregular sphere-like nanostructure with an average diameter ranging from ∼0.2 to 1.0 μm. In addition, some polyhedron nanoparticles with sizes in the range of ∼2 to 30 nm are observed on the surface of large particles, which is similar to the previous reports.34 Fig. S2c† further shows two lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.269 and 0.246 nm, which are attributed to the (210) and (211) planes of the Ag3PO4 cubic crystal structure, respectively. Fig. S3a and b† exhibit that the morphology of SnS2 is sheet-like with the average diameter and thickness of ∼300 ± 100 and 30 ± 100 nm, respectively. Such a 2D structure is favorable due to facilitating the in-plane diffusion of photogenerated charge carriers and providing a scaffold host for the decorated quantum dots. Moreover, the HRTEM image shows the (011) plane of the hexagonal SnS2 phase with a d-spacing of 0.279 nm (Fig. S3c†). Moreover, this image reveals an additional ultra-thin carbon layer on the SnS2 surface due to the residue of the L-cysteine precursor.41,56 After heterostructuring, Ag3PO4 quantum dots, with an average characteristic size of ∼10.0 nm, are uniformly decorated on the SnS2 surface (Fig. 2a and b). The uniform dispersion and small size of the grown quantum dots can be assigned to the high surface tension of Ag3PO4 particles and low surface energy of the SnS2 sheet, reminiscent of poor adhesive wet out. This results in the high loading of orthophosphate quantum dots without agglomeration. In addition, Fig. 2c exhibits the heterointerface between Ag3PO4 and SnS2 with a large contact angle, i.e., the formation of a point-like interface similar to a water droplet on a hydrophobic surface. The observed lattice fringes are consistent with the interplanar spacings of Ag3PO4(210) and SnS2(100) planes. Fig. S4† shows the high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image and selected area EDS mapping of Sn, S, Ag, P, and O elements, indicating a uniform distribution of Ag3PO4 quantum dots.

3.3. Chemical composition
High-resolution XPS analysis was performed to investigate the chemical compositions and oxidation states. Fig. 3a–e present the XPS spectra and the fitted curves of Ag 3d, P 2p, O 1s, Sn 3d, and S 2p signals, respectively. (i) Case Ag3PO4: two peaks at 367.9 and 373.9 eV are assigned to Ag+ 3d5/2 and Ag+ 3d3/2, respectively. The spectrum of the P 2p signal is fitted with two peaks at 133.1 and 133.9 eV, corresponding to the P5+ 2p3/2 and P5+ 2p1/2, respectively.57,58 The O 1s spectrum is also fitted with three peaks at 530.3, 531.3, and 532.4 eV, which are assigned to the lattice oxygen O2−, chemisorbed hydroxyl group OH−, and surface adsorbed oxygen, i.e., in the form of organic O–C.59,60 (ii) Case SnS2: it exhibits two peaks located at 486.6 and 495.0 eV in the Sn 3d spectra, corresponding to Sn4+ 3d5/2 and Sn4+ 3d3/2, respectively. Meanwhile, the S 2p spectrum is fitted with two prominent peaks at 161.6, and 162.8 eV, standing for S2− 2p3/2 and S2− 2p1/2, as well as a trace of the polysulfide signal with two low-intensity peaks at 163.4 and 164.6 eV.41 (iii) Case Ag3PO4/SnS2: the heterostructure shows similar characteristic peaks and almost the same full width at half maximums (FWHMs), although with some shifts in the binding energies. The shifts in the binding energies can be related to the charge transfer in heterostructured photocatalysts. Briefly, the blue- and red-shifts in the binding energy are due to a decrease and increase in the electron density, respectively.61 In the Ag3PO4/SnS2 spectrum, the Ag 3d, P 2p, and O 1s signals show blue-shifts but Sn 3d and S 2p signals show red-shifts. These results confirm the charge transfer after the formation of the heterointerface between Ag3PO4 and SnS2 – Fig. 3f reveals that the observed shifts are not due to impurities.

3.4. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
As schematically shown in Fig. S5,† the PC CO2 reduction experiments were performed under the gas-phase reaction. Fig. 4a exhibits the blank test-corrected PC yields of the as-prepared Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructures with different Ag3PO4-to-SnS2 ratios. The results reveal that the optimized Ag3PO4-to-SnS2 ratio is 70-to-30. In addition, the SEM images (Fig. S6†) show that the size of uniformly dispersed Ag3PO4 quantum dots gradually increases with Ag3PO4-to-SnS2 ratios. Fig. 4b presents the blank test-corrected PC yields recorded for 6 h. SnS2 shows CO and CH3CHO (i.e., acetaldehyde) yields of 2.3 and 7.7 μmole g−1, respectively. However, Ag3PO4 produced CO selectively with a yield of 36.5 μmole g−1. So, these results unveil the photooxidation properties of Ag3PO4 which have not been observed before. Further, the optimal Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructure shows a much larger yield of CO and a trace of CH3CHO yields of 110.0 and 5.7 μmole g−1, respectively. The selectivity of CO over the optimized Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructure is about 95% with ∼3.0 and ∼47.8 times enhancement in the PC productivity compared to that with Ag3PO4 and SnS2, respectively. Fig. 4c reveals the long-term PC stability of Ag3PO4/SnS2, and the CO production yield showed negligible drop after 5 cycles (i.e., 30 h). Fig. S7 and S8† show the XRD patterns and XPS spectra before and after the photocatalytic stability test. These results confirm the chemical and structural stability of Ag3PO4/SnS2. The selectivity–yield plot compares the performance of the Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructure with those of other systems, depicting that our PC result surpasses many reported studies (Fig. 4d). As shown in Table S2,† the overall apparent quantum efficiency (AQEoverall) of the Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructure is calculated to be 0.021%. Isotope-tracer experiments were conducted to confirm the CO formation from CO2 reduction, i.e., replacing 12CO2 with the 13CO2 isotope and performing the PC experiments under the same conditions. The total ion chromatogram and corresponding mass spectrum in Fig. S9a† reveal a remarkable signal at m/z = 29, verifying that the 13CO comes from the reduction of 13CO2. Additionally, the peak at m/z = 32 is assigned to the formation of the O2 product as the oxidation product. Moreover, the peak located at m/z = 28 is assigned to N2. This was confirmed by carrying out a blank test that shows the same peak (at m/z = 28) in the absence of CO2 (Fig. S9b†). Boosting of the PC activity of the heterostructure can be assigned to the charge transfer mechanism (that will be discussed in the following text) and nanoscale size of the Ag3PO4, which results in a short diffusion length of the photogenerated charge carriers.

In the following section, we will discuss the charge transfer mechanism that goes through the Z-scheme that boosts the productivity of the heterostructure. The direct Z-scheme charge carrier transfer mechanism is confirmed by three experiments: (i) XPS/UPS; (ii) photodeposition of Pt and PbO2 nanoparticles on reduction and oxidation sites; and (iii) in situ irradiated XPS.
3.5. Charge transfer mechanism carrier dynamics
The electronic band structure provides valuable information to evaluate whether photogenerated charge carriers would overcome the required potential to trigger a CO2 reduction reaction. We performed UPS to get detailed information on the band structure (Fig. 5a). The work function (Φ) was calculated through the secondary electron energy region with a sharp photoemission onset. It results in the values of Φ = 4.70 and 4.08 eV for SnS2 and Ag3PO4, respectively. Based on the calculated valence band maxima (VBM), Fermi level, and conduction band minima (CBM), we depict the electronic band diagram with CO2-to-fuel reduction and H2O oxidation potential alignments. As shown in Fig. 5b, the results show that both Ag3PO4 and SnS2 can thermodynamically perform the PC CO2 reduction. Moreover, the Ag3PO4 sample exhibits more negative CBM and VBM positions than the SnS2 sample, indicating that orthophosphate vacancies contribute to the negative shift of both CBM and VBM positions. The band position analysis also suggests that the Ag3PO4/SnS2 system can form a Z-scheme heterostructure, which can further boost the charge separation yield, consistent with our PC CO2 reduction results. To probe the band offset of the heterojunction, XPS measurements were performed for Ag3PO4, SnS2, and Ag3PO4/SnS2. Using the values of the core level, valence band offset (VBO), and conduction band offset (CBO), as well as applying the Kraut method,67 the band diagram of the heterojunction was determined (Note S1, Fig. S10 and S11†). The VBO and CBO of the Ag3PO4/SnS2 were calculated to be 0.43 and 0.34 eV, respectively. Such a spike-type band offset indicates the existence of the band bending and direct Z-scheme heterointerface between Ag3PO4 and SnS2. The aforementioned Z-scheme charge transfer should result in PL quenching. So, PL and TRPL experiments were performed to verify the charge carrier dynamics. As shown in Fig. 5c, the PL signal of the Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterojunction was quenched due to the fast exciton dissociation. A bi-exponential function was used to fit the TRPL curves, resulting in the calculation of A1, τ1, A2, and τ2 constants (Fig. 5d). Table S3† presents the fitted values and the average lifetime of the carriers τave. τave = 0.8 ns for Ag3PO4/SnS2, which is much lower than those of the pristine samples. This result illustrates the efficient delocalization of electrons and holes (i.e., exciton dissociation) at the interface, which is in good agreement with the charge transfer mechanism.

Low binding energy extends to the higher binding energy region, and the intercept value corresponds to the VBM and secondary cut-off electron (work function), respectively. (b) Energy band diagram of Ag3PO4 and SnS2 (energy aligned with the vacuum level versus standard hydrogen electrode at pH = 7). (c) PL spectra and (d) TRPL spectra of Ag3PO4, SnS2 and Ag3PO4/SnS2. TRPL curves were recorded at an emission wavelength of 505 nm. The fitted TRPL curves (green color) are also added to (d). 
For photodeposition experiments, Ag3PO4/SnS2 powder was dispersed in different solutions containing Pt and Pb ions as discussed in our previous work.46 The actual locations of photo-deposited Pt and PbO2 nanoparticles provide direct evidence of the reduction and oxidation sites, respectively. As shown in Fig. S12a and b,† the TEM and HRTEM images reveal that Pt nanoparticles were deposited on the Ag3PO4, indicating photogenerated electron transfer from Ag3PO4 to Pt ions. Moreover, Fig. S12c and d† show that the PbO2 nanoparticles were deposited on the SnS2 nanosheets, implying that photogenerated holes transfer from SnS2 to Pb ions. In situ irradiated XPS analysis was performed to clarify the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers during light irradiation. As shown in Fig. S13,† the binding energy of Ag 3d and Sn 3d shows red- and blue-shifts of −0.2 and 0.2 eV after light irradiation, indicating that the photogenerated electrons transferred from the SnS2 to Ag3PO4. The EPR measurement was further carried out to ascertain the charge transfer in the heterojunction.68 According to the EPR spectra of the SnS2 and the Ag3PO4/SnS2 powders (Fig. S14†), both the samples showed an S-vacancy signal at g = 2.004.39,69 However, the intensity in the Ag3PO4/SnS2 was much lower than that of SnS2. According to the XPS results, the S/Sn atomic ratios (excluding the polysulfide signal) of the SnS2 and the Ag3PO4/SnS2 samples are 1.54 and 1.36, respectively. Despite a higher S deficiency in the Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructure, its lower S-vacancy intensity indicates that the vacancies were filled with heteroatoms that were able to conduct the electrons away from the trapping sites. In the Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructure, the filled atoms would be the O of the PO43− species. Since the S-vacancy states are near the conduction band of the SnS2 moiety and the O 2p state constructs the valence band of the Ag3PO4 moiety,70,71 such electron drifts across the heterojunction from the SnS2 to the Ag3PO4 moieties reveal the Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism.
These analyses revealed that the charge transfer route follows a direct Z-scheme mechanism, i.e., the photogenerated electrons and holes are accumulated at Ag3PO4 and SnS2 sites, respectively. So, Fig. 6 presents the schematic illustration of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction mechanism of Ag3PO4/SnS2. Before contact, Ag3PO4 and SnS2 form staggered band structures, where the work function of Ag3PO4 is lower than that of SnS2. After heterostructuring, the electrons transfer from Ag3PO4 to SnS2 as long as the Fermi levels reach an equilibrium condition. Then, the internal electric field is formed which results in band bending. Therefore, the charge transfer follows the direct Z-scheme mechanism, where electrons (on the Ag3PO4 quantum dots) and holes (on the SnS2 nanosheets) can provide relatively high potential energy required for CO2 reduction.

3.6. CO2 reduction pathway
In order to understand the activation of CO2 and H2O molecules over Ag3PO4/SnS2, in situ DRIFT spectroscopy of Ag3PO4/SnS2 photocatalysts was conducted. Fig. 7a shows the time-dependent FTIR signals obtained in the dark with CO2 gas and H2O vapor. The reference spectrum was collected after purging argon for 60 min in the dark. The observed FTIR peaks at 1370, and 1426/1675 cm−1 are assigned to the bidentate carbonate (b-CO32−) and HCO3− groups, respectively.69,72 The peaks at 1626 and 1650 cm−1 are attributed to the bending mode of the H2O molecule.39,73 Moreover, the peak at 1692 cm−1 is associated with the formation of CO2− species.74 Under light irradiation, Fig. 7b depicts that the intensity of the broad peaks (1300 to 1750 cm−1) chronologically decreases. Notably, the reference spectrum is obtained after purging CO2 gas and H2O vapor for 60 min in the dark. In contrast, the intense peak (1190 cm−1) is assigned to the COOH* intermediate75,76 and the intensity of the COOH*-associated peak gradually increases during the photocatalytic reaction. Based on our experimental results and previous DRIFT study of a separate system,6,46 the photocatalytic CO2-to-CO reduction process was proposed as the following steps: (1) H2O → H + OH−(2) (3) Ag3PO4/SnS2 + hν → e− + h+(4) (5) COOH* + H+ + e− → CO*(6) CO* → CO↑(7)

In situ DRIFT experiments. DRIFT spectra of Ag3PO4/SnS2 exposed to CO2 gas and H2O vapor (a) in the dark and (b) under light irradiation. 
Initially, the CO2 molecules were adsorbed and activated on the catalyst surface  and the H2O molecules dissociated into the hydroxyl group. Then, some  will obtain electrons from the surface to form the carbon species (i.e., CO2−, CO32−, HCO3−). Next, the photogenerated electrons and holes will accumulate on Ag3PO4 and SnS2 sites, respectively, with high potential energy to participate in the photocatalytic reaction. Meanwhile, the key intermediate COOH* for CO formation can be derived from  interacting with surface protons. The COOH* will be further reduced to CO* molecules by interplay with surface electrons and protons. Finally, the surface desorption of adsorbed CO* would yield the CO product.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we reported a 0D/2D Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructure synthesized by a facile two-step process, i.e., hydrothermal and ion-exchange methods. We shed light on the photogenerated charge carrier transfer by conducting XPS/UPS, photodeposition of Pt and PbO2 nanoparticles, in situ irradiated XPS, and EPR analyses. Results revealed the formation of the direct Z-scheme heterostructure, resulting in PL quenching due to the efficient exciton dissociation. Accordingly, the optimized Ag3PO4/SnS2 heterostructure achieved a gas-phase PC CO2-to-CO selectivity of ∼95%, with a yield of ∼3.0 and ∼47.8 times larger than that obtained with pristine Ag3PO4 and SnS2, respectively. Finally, in situ DRIFT revealed the activation of CO2 and H2O molecules over the surface of the heterostructure. It further confirmed that the major CO product was formed via the COOH* intermediate.
Broadly, this work provides solid insight into the characterization of the Z-scheme heterostructure for PC application, which can be further applied for heterostructures beyond Ag3PO4/SnS2 and other applications such as PEC water splitting and PC dye degradation. Moreover, our PC experiments uncover the photooxidation properties of the semiconducting Ag3PO4 material.

 	Fig. 1  Optical properties, crystal structures, and lattice vibrational modes. (a) Normalized UV-visible absorption spectra, (b) XRD patterns, (c) FT-IR, and (d) Raman spectra of Ag3PO4, SnS2, and Ag3PO4/SnS2 samples. The photographs of the prepared powders are added in (a). The Tauc plots, with the direct transitions fittings, and standard XRD patterns of Ag3PO4 and SnS2 are shown in the inset of (a) and (b), respectively. F(r) and hν are the Kubelka–Munk function and photon energy in the Tauc plot, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  Morphologies and microstructures. TEM images of Ag3PO4/SnS2 with different magnifications of (a) 50 kX, (b) 300 kX, and (c) 800 kX. Inset of (b) shows the size histogram of Ag3PO4 quantum dots with a normal distribution.	 

 	Fig. 3  Chemical composition and oxidation states. High-resolution XPS spectra of (a) Ag 3d, (b) P 2p, and (c) O 1s, (d) Sn 3d, and (e) S 2p signals, and (f) XPS survey spectra of Ag3PO4, SnS2, and Ag3PO4/SnS2.	 

 	Fig. 4  Photocatalytic CO2 reduction. (a) Blank test-corrected PC CO2 reduction yield of the as-prepared samples with different Ag3PO4-to-SnS2 ratios during 6 h. (b) Blank test-corrected product yields of the commercial SnS2, as-prepared SnS2, pristine Ag3PO4, and Ag3PO4/SnS2 powders. (c) Cyclic test of the Ag3PO4/SnS2 sample for five cycles (each reaction time is 6 h). (d) Selectivity–yield of different reported systems for the CO product. Photocatalyst systems in (d) are Ag3PO4/Ag/GdCrO3,62 Cu2O/TiO2,63 Ag3PO4/TiO2,38 AuSACdS1−x and AuSACd1−xS64 (SA means single atom), Zn3In2S6/TiO2,65 Ag3PO4/g-C3N4,36 P-g-C3N4,66 and Vs-SnS2.39	 

 	Fig. 5  Energy band diagram and carrier dynamics. (a) UPS spectra of Ag3PO4 and SnS2. Low binding energy extends to the higher binding energy region, and the intercept value corresponds to the VBM and secondary cut-off electron (work function), respectively. (b) Energy band diagram of Ag3PO4 and SnS2 (energy aligned with the vacuum level versus standard hydrogen electrode at pH = 7). (c) PL spectra and (d) TRPL spectra of Ag3PO4, SnS2 and Ag3PO4/SnS2. TRPL curves were recorded at an emission wavelength of 505 nm. The fitted TRPL curves (green color) are also added to (d).
