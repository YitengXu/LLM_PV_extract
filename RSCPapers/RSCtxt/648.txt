    , Accepted 13th March 2014First published on 13th March 2014AbstractWe report the first hybrid tandem solar cell with solution processable active layers using colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs) as the front subcell in combination with a polymer–fullerene rear subcell. Al/WO3 is introduced as an interlayer, yielding an open circuit voltage (VOC) equal to about 92% of the sum of the VOC of the subcells. The device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 1.8%. Optical simulations of various tandem configurations show that combining PbS QDs with small-bandgap polymers is a promising strategy to obtain tandem solar cells with a very broad absorption range and a high short circuit current.
Introduction
Solution processable thin-film photovoltaics have great potential in the search for cheap renewable energy sources. Rapid progress in recent years has resulted in single junction polymer–fullerene solar cells reaching the 9% efficiency mark.1 However, the limitations of single junction solar cells have been extensively documented,2–4 and interest is increasingly being shown in double or triple-junction solar cells.5,6 By using materials with different bandgaps in a tandem structure, a broader coverage of the solar spectrum and, consequently, higher efficiency can be achieved. Recently, progress in the synthesis of efficient small-bandgap polymers has led to an increase of the efficiency of polymer tandem cells towards 9% and the absorption coverage extending to ∼950 nm.7,8 However, this accounts for only 71% of the power available in the solar spectrum. Extension of the absorption spectrum further into the infrared is desirable, but highly efficient organic materials able to absorb further into the infrared are as yet lacking. Organically capped inorganic nanocrystals (also known as colloidal quantum dots) are a promising new class of solution processable semiconductors. For semiconducting nanocrystals with a size smaller than the Bohr-radius of the exciton, spatial quantum confinement of the charge carriers leads to discretization of the energy levels and widening of the bandgap with respect to the bulk-value. Varying the QD size thus allows tuning of the bandgap and, correspondingly, of the absorption onset up to and even beyond that of Si.9,10 At the same time, capping ligands provide solubility in organic solvents, thus opening the possibility of low-cost, low energy fabrication from solution. In this respect, colloidal quantum dots constitute a promising class of materials combining the beneficial properties of inorganic semiconductors, i.e. small-bandgaps and good transport properties, with the processability and versatility of organic semiconductors. In this work, we explore the use of PbS QDs in tandem solar cells to open the pathway to solution processable tandem solar cells with a broad spectral coverage potentially beyond 1.1 μm.
PbS QDs have been used successfully in various device structures such as dye-sensitized solar cells,11,12 Schottky type solar cells,13–15 and depleted heterojunction solar cells where efficiencies of 7.3% have been reported.16–18 These successes notwithstanding, QDs are yet to be extensively explored in a tandem configuration. Serial tandem solar cells employing PbS QDs of different sizes for both the front and the rear subcell have been reported by two research groups.19,20 However, due to the high absorption coefficients in the visible spectral range regardless of the size of the PbS QDs, true absorption complementarity cannot be reached using nanocrystals only. To achieve a more uniform absorption coverage, PbS QDs can be used in combination with a suitably chosen polymer featuring a narrower absorption band, ideally with an onset at around 900 nm. In this way, light would be harvested throughout the visible and into the infrared up to 1.1 μm. The combination of a QD and a polymer–fullerene subcell is therefore a promising, yet largely unexplored, strategy for achieving efficient tandem solar cells with a broad spectral coverage.
Here we present the fabrication of a serial tandem solar cell employing PbS QDs as the front subcell and a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the back subcell. The two cells are connected with an interlayer consisting of WO3 and a thin layer of Al. These devices feature an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.89 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 3.9 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 53%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.8%. Finally, we present optical simulations which enlighten the potential of PbS QDs in various other tandem configurations.
Results and discussion
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the tandem cell and the reference cells can be seen in Fig. 1. The reference for the front subcell is an ITO/PbS/Al Schottky device, yielding a VOC of 0.41 V, a JSC of 15.3 mA cm−2, a FF of 51%, and a PCE of 3.0%. The PbS film used for the reference was chosen to be slightly thicker than that used in the tandem device to reduce the variance of the VOC, as will be described later, giving rise to a slight overestimation of the VOC of the reference cell and, consequently, a conservative estimation of the effectiveness of the interlayer. As a reference for the rear subcell, a P3HT:PCBM active layer is spincasted on top of ITO and WO3, which exhibits a VOC of 0.56 V, a JSC of 7.5 mA cm−2, a FF of 66%, and a PCE of 2.7%. The tandem configuration yields a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 2.0 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 58%, and a PCE of 1.0%. The device characteristics are summarized in Table 1 and the EQE spectra of the subcells are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). These results show that the WO3 and Al together form an efficient interlayer for the recombination of the electrons from the bottom cell and the holes from the top cell, aligning the quasi-Fermi levels of the Al and WO3 and resulting in a VOC of the tandem cell equal to about 89% of the sum of the respective subcells.

From the JSC's of the reference cells shown in Fig. 1, the P3HT:PCBM single cell provides about half the current of the PbS single cell. In the tandem structure, this discrepancy is exacerbated by the fact that P3HT:PCBM is placed behind the PbS, which absorbs a large portion of the light in the visible, as can be seen in Fig. 2b. This results in a very low current generation in the rear cell and consequently a low JSC in the tandem device. In addition, the slight loss in VOC compared to the sum of the VOC's of the subcells may also be due to the large current mismatch. The excess of electrons supplied by the PbS subcell to the interlayer results in a negative space charge at the cathode of the front subcell. This space charge supplements the applied bias across the front cell and leads to a reduced contribution to the VOC from that subcell. Therefore, we expect that both the JSC and the VOC of the tandem cell can be improved by better current matching.

To elucidate the mismatch in this device, optical modelling was performed to simulate the electromagnetic field as it propagates through the layers composing the device structure using the transfer matrix formalism.21 This method requires as parameters only the wavelength-dependent complex refractive indices of all materials composing the device structure, and the thicknesses of each layer. In this model, we assume that each absorbed photon contributes one elementary charge to the current of the subcell, and that the current of the tandem cell is equal to the smallest of the currents produced by the two subcells. It should be noted that in PbS QDs, potentially more than one charge can be generated per photon through multiple exciton generation. However, without being able to quantify this effect, we choose to not make assumptions regarding the effect in our device. Where possible, values of the complex refractive indices were taken from the literature,22–25 and were otherwise obtained by variable angle spectral ellipsometry. The complex refractive indices of active layers used in this model can be found in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
Using this model, the current generated in both subcells as a function of the subcell thicknesses is simulated, yielding two current surfaces which can be seen in Fig. S3 (ESI†). If we take the minimum of the two surfaces, we can obtain a simulated current of the tandem device as a function of the thicknesses of the subcells, displayed in Fig. 3 as a contour plot. The black line indicates at which thicknesses current matching is achieved between the subcells. Below the black line the current of the tandem device is limited by the PbS subcell, while above the black line the current is limited by the P3HT:PCBM subcell. The current matching conditions cannot be achieved for PbS thicknesses exceeding ∼40 nm. In addition, the current of the tandem device is strongly dependent on the thickness of the PbS layer and is only moderately sensitive to the P3HT:PCBM layer thickness. Therefore, the thickness of the PbS subcell was systematically tuned, and the experimental results are displayed in Fig. 4a. As expected, the JSC was found to increase as the PbS thickness was decreased. Unexpectedly, however, decreasing the thickness also led to a decrease of the VOC of the tandem device. We suggest that this is caused by decreasing the shunt resistance in the PbS cell as the thickness is decreased, as can be seen in Fig. 4b and c. The low shunt resistance increases the charge carrier recombination in the PbS layer and leads to a reduction of the VOC. The decrease in the shunt resistance is likely due to microscopic pinholes in the PbS film caused by the reduction of the inter-nanocrystal spacing during the ligand exchange. While the QDs are capped with oleic acid, the inter-QD spacing is ∼2 nm, which is reduced to ∼0.5 nm when the ligand is replaced with the much shorter benzenedithiols.26 This volume reduction causes pinholes or cracks of the topmost layer during fabrication. In thick devices, these pinholes are filled by the deposition of subsequent layers as the film is fabricated layer-by-layer. For thin devices, however, some pinholes may remain, leading to a low shunt resistance.

The black line indicates the current matching conditions between the subcells. Below the black line the current is limited by the PbS subcell, while above the black line the current is limited by P3HT:PCBM. 
 Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves of the tandem structure for various PbS layer thicknesses. The JSC increases as the thickness of the PbS subcell is reduced. The VOC decreases due to the decreased shunt resistance of the PbS subcell. (b) The VOC of ITO/PbS/LiF/Al Schottky devices for different PbS thicknesses. It can be seen that there is a large spread in the VOC, particularly for thin devices and a general trend to lower the VOC as the thickness is decreased. The J–V curves of these devices in the dark are displayed in (c), showing an increasing leakage in reverse bias as the thickness is decreased. This is symptomatic of low shunt resistance. 
Therefore, in this case, decreasing the thickness of the front cell to the optically optimal value is not practically feasible. In a trade-off between JSC and VOC, an intermediate PbS thickness of ∼60 nm and P3HT:PCBM thickness of 105 nm were chosen and optimized, resulting in a champion device featuring a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 3.9 mA cm−2, a FF of 53% and a PCE of 1.8%; the J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 5. The open circuit voltage of this device is about 92% of the sum of the subcell VOC's, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the best demonstration of WO3 as a component of tandem device interlayers. WO3 was used previously in an interlayer in a serial tandem device by Janssen et al.,27 however, in this work only 72% of the sum of the subcell VOC's was obtained. To avoid the trade-off between better current matching and lower VOC, the order of the subcells could be reversed, such that the lower absorbing P3HT subcell is in front and the PbS in the back. The optical modelling, displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†), suggests that a JSC of 9.5 mA cm−2 is theoretically possible in such a device. In addition, with the polymer in the front cell, high current can be achieved in a much broader range of thicknesses than with the polymer in the back. However, an even more promising approach would be to replace P3HT with a small band gap polymer as the front cell such as poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT),28 and use PbS QDs as the rear cell. A maximum JSC of 12.2 mA cm−2 is obtained from the modelling with this configuration. Further investigation of hybrid tandem devices combining PbS QDs with small band gap polymers is therefore promising.

Experimental section
Nanocrystal synthesis
PbS QDs, capped with oleic acid ligands, were synthesized using the hot injection method and treated with 4 washing steps. The full procedure is described elsewhere.13 For this study, QDs featuring a first excitonic absorption peak at approximately 1025 nm in solution were used. The average diameter of the QDs was estimated to be around 3.4 nm using an empirical relationship between the first absorption peak and the particle size.29
Device fabrication
The device structure of the tandem cells is shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The layer of PbS was deposited onto a substrate of pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) by a sequential layer-by-layer method whereby PbS is spincoated from chloroform, and subsequently treated with 1,4-benzenedithiol, and the procedure is repeated until the desired thickness is achieved. This treatment results in the replacement of the oleic acid ligands and in the crosslinking of the QDs into a dense, insoluble network, see Fig. 2a. As previously reported by our group,13,14 the full removal of the oleic acid molecules in this manner is supported by FTIR spectra, as evidenced by the disappearance of the strong symmetrical and asymmetrical (COO–) vibrations at ∼1400 and ∼1550 cm−1 and the C–H vibrations at ∼2856 and ∼2925 cm−1, which are typical of oleic acid. The interlayer was deposited by thermal evaporation of Al (1 nm), and WO3 (15 nm). The rear active layer was spincoated from a solution of P3HT and PCBM (1:0.8 wt/wt) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The as-cast film was subsequently annealed at 120 °C for 5 minutes. The device was finished by thermal evaporation of LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm).
Measurements
Electrical characterization of the device was performed under simulated AM1.5G solar illumination using a Steuernagel SolarConstant 1200 lamp set to 100 mW cm−2 intensity using a silicon reference cell and corrected for the spectral mismatch factor according to Kroon et al.30 Ellipsometric data were obtained using a Woolham VASE ellipsometer, the data were fitted using the Wvase32 software to obtain the complex refractive indices of the materials investigated.
Conclusions
In conclusion, tandem solar cells featuring PbS QDs as the front subcell and P3HT:PCBM as the rear subcell were fabricated, demonstrating the first hybrid inorganic–organic tandem solar cell where both subcells are processed from solution. An interlayer consisting of Al (1 nm) and WO3 (15 nm) was implemented as an effective recombination layer, yielding a VOC equal to about 92% of the sum of the subcell VOC's. Optical modelling evidences that by replacing P3HT with a narrow bandgap polymer a substantial increase in the JSC of the device can be obtained. Our approach provides a promising route to efficient solution processable tandem solar cells with a spectral coverage up to 1.1 μm wavelength.
