    , Accepted 3rd February 2016First published on 4th February 2016AbstractEffective electron acceptor materials usually have a deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level that can split excitons and generate current. A non-fullerene electron acceptor (F8-DPPTCN) was developed, using fluorene as the core with arms of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) having thiophene-2-carbonitrile as the terminal units. The new molecule had a LUMO of −3.65 eV and a narrow bandgap (Eg) of 1.66 eV, owing to the electronegativity of the thiophene-2-carbonitrile group and its conjugation with DPP units. Organic solar cells (OSCs) with F8-DPPTCN as the acceptor and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor were fabricated. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.37% was obtained with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.97 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 6.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.39. Structural characterization showed that P3HT and F8-DPPTCN were kinetically trapped in a weakly separated state whereas thermal annealing led to the crystallization of P3HT and the formation of a network structure with a mesh-size of several hundred nanometers. When a solvent additive, diiodooctane, was used and the mixture was thermally annealed, both P3HT and F8-DPPTCN crystallized and a multi-length scale network was formed. Though the PCEs were low, the changes in the PCE could be correlated with the morphological changes, opening pathways to increase performance further.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% have been achieved,1,2 and thus they have potential as a renewable energy alternative.3–5 In OSCs, electron acceptors are essential components. Their development is far behind that of electron donors, but has received significant attention recently.6–8 The most commonly used electron acceptors are fullerenes and their derivatives, for example [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM). The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PCBMs are not likely to be changed significantly, but they do set a benchmark against which other materials can be measured. PCBMs have the drawbacks that their light absorption is weak and the cost of production is high,9–11 which limit the development of OSC technologies. Ideally, freeing the frontier energy level constraint will introduce a large number of new acceptor materials into OSCs to further optimize device characteristics.12
There is significant motivation to develop non-fullerene electron acceptors. For example, when using poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, as the donor, non-fullerene acceptor-based solar cells achieved PCEs up to 4–5%,12–16 comparable to, if not surpassing, the PCE characteristic of P3HT:PCBM blends. Other results from narrow bandgap polymer donors and fullerene-free acceptors reported PCEs of 6–7%.17–19 To design non-fullerene acceptors, the proper integration of electron-withdrawing groups, that decrease the LUMO level and promote the dissociation of excitons, is the key.20 Commonly used electron-withdrawing building blocks include cyano,21,22 benzothiadiazole,23,24 fluorine,25 amide,26,27 and imide groups.28,29 The use of the cyano group is of particular interest, since it is an easily synthesized substituent attached to a π-conjugated backbone, which extends light absorption and improves electron mobility. For example, Pei et al. introduced the cyano group to fluoranthene-fused imide derivatives and achieved a PCE of 1.86% when blended with P3HT.30 Meredith et al. reported a small molecule acceptor (YF25) containing two cyano groups, and the OSCs based on a P3HT:YF25 blend exhibited the best PCE of 1.43%.31 There are also several molecules containing cyano groups that have PCEs >2% when blended with P3HT.28
Here we report on the design and synthesis of a non-fullerene electron acceptor (F8-DPPTCN, Scheme 1) having fluorene as the core with arms of thiophene-2-carbonitrile-terminated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP).32 In previous studies we showed that appending DPP to fluorene led to excellent acceptors, with strong light absorption, good charge carrier mobility, and good thermodynamic stability.32 Introducing thiophene-2-carbonitrile will be of interest since, as an electronegative group, thiophene-2-carbonitrile will effectively lower the energy levels, especially the LUMO of the resultant material, and lead to better planarity of the molecules, and therefore, better absorption and charge transport. As expected, F8-DPPTCN exhibits a broad absorption spectrum up to 757 nm and a lower-lying LUMO level that matches well with that of P3HT. In addition, P3HT:F8-DPPTCN blends show electron mobilities up to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The OSCs made from P3HT:F8-DPPTCN blends deliver the best PCE of 2.37% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.97 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 6.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.39. The current study indicates that the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups, like thiophene-2-carbonitrile, can be a practical method to design new electron acceptors.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of F8-DPPTCN
The synthesis of F8-DPPTCN is shown in Scheme 1. Introducing an electron-withdrawing group, like thiophene-2-carbonitrile, was difficult by Stille or Suzuki coupling reactions. Consequently, we chose a C–H activation reaction to synthesize the intermediate compound 3.33 The yield was 24%, due to the competition of a DPP self-coupling reaction. Compound 4 was obtained in 78% yield from the bromination of compound 3. The final F8-DPPTCN was obtained in 70% yield by the Suzuki coupling of compound 4 with 5. MALDI-TOF MS, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR were used to characterize the chemical structure of F8-DPPTCN. F8-DPPPTCN shows good solubility in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane and chloroform. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to investigate the thermal properties of F8-DPPTCN. From TGA we find that the decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) is 387 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere, suggesting the good thermal stability of the material (ESI, Fig. S1†). From the DSC curve, we find that F8-DPPTCN is crystalline showing a weak crystallization peak at 138 °C during cooling. The thermal response of F8-DPPTCN during heating was somewhat complex. First, a glass transition is observed from 65–85 °C, followed by a sharp crystallization peak at 136 °C. These are followed by two melting peaks at 181 and 197 °C. The emergence of two melting peaks indicates a polymorphic nature of the F8-DPPTCN crystals (ESI, Fig. S2†).
F8-DPPTCN in CHCl3 solution shows strong absorption from 500–700 nm with a maximum absorption peak at 643 nm (Fig. 1a). In films, the absorption peak red-shifts by ∼50 nm, suggesting a strong inter-molecular stacking in the solid state. Absorption beyond 500 nm is attributed to an intramolecular charge transfer, and absorption in the 300–500 nm region originates from localized π–π* transitions.34 The absorption edge of the F8-DPPTCN thin films is found to be 757 nm, and the optical bandgap is calculated to be 1.64 eV. The absorption characteristics of F8-DPPTCN films match well with those of P3HT (400–600 nm), which is beneficial for enhancing photon absorption.
 Fig. 1  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra of F8-DPPTCN in CHCl3 solution and films; (b) cyclic voltammogram of F8-DPPTCN in CH2Cl2 solution. 
The energy levels of F8-DPPTCN were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 1b. Reversible oxidation is seen, with an onset oxidation potential of 0.91 V (versus Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE)). From the reduction curve, the onset reduction potential is estimated to be −0.75 V (versus SCE). Thus, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.31 and −3.65 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgap is 1.66 eV, which agrees with the optical bandgap. The energy offset between LUMOP3HT and LUMOF8-DPPTCN is more than 0.3 eV, which is large enough for the exciton dissociation.35
2.2. Photovoltaic properties of F8-DPPTCN
F8-DPPTCN was used as an electron acceptor to fabricate OSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:F8-DPPTCN/PFN/Al. Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of the devices at different donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratios are summarized in Table 1. A high Voc, close to 1 V, is obtained, which is attributed to the large energy offset of the LUMOF8-DPPTCN and HOMOP3HT (1.11 eV). When different processing conditions are used, the Voc remains constant, while the Jsc and FF show variations. At a weight ratio of 1:3, after thermal annealing at 95 °C for 10 min (Fig. 2a), the device showed a PCE of 2.01% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 5.00 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.42. When 0.4% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) is used as a processing additive,36 a better PCE of 2.37% with a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 6.25 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.39 is achieved. Other DIO concentrations from 0.2% to 2% were also tried, but lower performances were achieved (ESI, Fig. S5†). Compared to small molecule acceptor analogues without the thiophene-2-carbonitrile moiety, F8-DPPTCN shows improved performance as an electron acceptor.27,37 This suggests that introducing strong electron-withdrawing groups to the terminus of a molecule is an appropriate strategy to generate good electron acceptors. More data on the photovoltaic performances under different conditions can be found in the ESI (Fig. S3–S5†).

 Fig. 2  (a) J–V curves and (b) EQE spectra of P3HT:F8-DPPTCN based OSCs. 
External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra under three different conditions are shown in Fig. 2b. All the three EQE spectra have a broad plateau region from 350 to 700 nm. The photovoltaic responses below 600 nm are mainly due to the absorption of P3HT, and those above 600 nm result from the absorption of F8-DPPTCN, indicating that each component of the blended film contributes to the photovoltaic performance. The integrated photocurrent values of 1:2 annealed, 1:3 annealed and 1:3 annealed DIO devices calculated from the EQE spectra and the AM 1.5G solar spectrum are 4.57, 3.97, and 4.98 mA cm−2, respectively, which have a similar variation trend with the values obtained from the J–V curves.
2.3. Charge carrier mobilities of the active layers
The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the hole and electron mobilities of the active layers. The structure of the hole-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:F8-DPPTCN/MoO3/Al and the structure of the electron-only devices is ITO/PFN/P3HT:F8-DPPTCN/PFN/Al. Fig. 3a and b show the J0.5–V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices, and Table 2 summarizes the mobility values calculated from the J0.5–V curves using the Mott–Gurney law. The 1:2 blended film with thermal annealing shows a hole mobility of 3.27 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and an electron mobility of 2.03 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. When the blend ratio is changed to 1:3, the hole mobility is estimated to be 3.62 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, similar to that of the 1:2 blended thin film. However, the electron mobility is reduced to 1.12 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, slightly improving the FF. When 0.4% DIO is used, the hole mobility increases to 9.49 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the electron mobility increases to 2.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, further decreasing the mobility ratio (μe/μh). The addition of DIO is later shown to enhance crystallization and phase separation which, when combined with the recorded mobilities leads to improved performance.

2.4. Morphology characterization
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) was used to investigate the structural order of P3HT and F8-DPPTCN in BHJ thin films. Fig. 4a shows the 2D diffraction patterns of P3HT:F8-DPPTCN (1:3, by wt) blended films, and Fig. 4b shows the out-of-plane and in-plane line cut profiles. In the as-cast BHJ sample, a broad peak in the in-plane direction is seen at ∼0.4 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of 15.7 Å, indicative of an interchain packing of P3HT and F8-DPPTCN. A broad, diffuse isotropic peak is seen at ∼1.2 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of 5.2 Å. In the out-of-plane direction, a weak π–π stacking peak is seen at ∼1.65 Å−1, giving a distance of 3.80 Å. Thermal annealing leads to pronounced crystallization. Sharp diffraction peaks at 0.38 Å−1 can be seen in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, giving a distance of 16.53 Å. This distance corresponds to the (100) reflection of P3HT. This peak is enhanced in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions, as shown in diffraction images. A sharp π–π stacking peak is seen in the out-of-plane direction (∼1.67 Å−1), giving a distance of 3.76 Å, arising from π–π stacking of P3HT. A weak π–π stacking peak is seen in the in-plane diffraction profile, indicating that P3HT assumes a mixed “face-on” and “edge-on” orientation. The (100) crystal size from the in-plane diffraction is calculated to be 131 Å, and the π–π stacking peak size from the out-of-plane direction is calculated to be 30 Å. No indication of diffraction from the F8-DPPTCN was evident in either the in-plane or out-of-plane direction. It should be noted that although thermal annealing induces crystallization of P3HT, hole-mobility does not increase.
 Fig. 4  (a) The 2D GIXD images of P3HT:F8-DPPTCN (1:3, by wt) blend films; (b) 1D out-of-plane (solid lines) and in-plane (dot lines) X-ray profiles extracted from GIXD; (c) RSoXS profiles of P3HT:F8-DPPTCN (1:3, by wt) blend films. 
Thus, the interconnection between P3HT crystals needs to be improved. For the films prepared with DIO and then thermally annealed, new crystalline features are observed. In the in-plane profiles, the maximum from 0.3–0.4 Å−1 can be decomposed into two distinct reflections at 0.37 Å−1 and 0.42 Å−1. The 0.37 Å−1 peak, corresponding to a Bragg spacing of 17.0 Å, arises from the (100) reflection of P3HT (214 Å in size) and the 0.42 Å−1 peak, corresponding to a Bragg spacing of 15.0 Å distance, arises from the (100) reflection of F8-DPPTCN (57 Å in size). In the corresponding out-of-plane profiles, the peak position located at 0.39 Å−1, can be decomposed into contributions from the (100) peaks of both P3HT and F8-DPPTCN. The π–π stacking in out-of-plane profiles showed a strong peak at 1.70 Å−1. The crystal size was calculated to be 52 Å. The drastically increased π–π stacking length gives rise to an enhanced hole mobility. In both the in-plane and out-of-plane profiles, a small peak close to the dominant P3HT π–π stacking peak is seen, giving a Bragg spacing of 4.2 Å. We argue that this distance corresponds to the π–π stacking in F8-DPPTCN. Thus in DIO + annealing processed thin films, both species take “edge-on” and “face-on” orientations.
Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) was used to investigate the length scale of phase separation in the blended films.38 The similarities in the chemical composition and bonding in the P3HT and F8-DPPTCN make analysis by RSoXS more difficult. We optimized the contrast factors by scanning through different photon energies and found that 285.2 eV, close to the carbon K-edge, gave the best contrast. The scattering profiles are summarized in Fig. 4c. The as-cast thin film shows a very weak signal and a very broad shoulder at ∼0.01 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of ∼60 nm. Thermal annealing at 95 °C for 10 minutes markedly changed the RSoXs profiles of the blended thin film. As shown in the figure, an intense shoulder is seen at ∼0.0045 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of 140 nm. The new feature comes from the crystallization of P3HT, indicating the formation of a network structure of P3HT in BHJ blends. This length scale of phase separation is quite large and, thus, only a moderate Jsc and PCE are obtained. When a small amount of DIO was introduced during the processing, the morphology changed markedly again. Two shoulders, one at ∼0.0035 Å−1 (corresponding to ∼180 nm), and one at ∼0.015 Å−1 (corresponding to 42 nm) are seen, clearly reflecting a multi-length scale morphology. The 180 nm phase separation is ascribed to the P3HT crystalline network and the 42 nm phase separation is ascribed to the mesh network size of F8-DPPTCN. The existence of small-sized phase separation helps to improve Jsc, as shown in the corresponding solar cell devices.
3. Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized an electron acceptor (F8-DPPTCN) with a fluorene core having DPP arms that are end-capped with thiophene-2-carbonitrile. The resulting material exhibits extended absorption in the near infrared region (up to 757 nm). Frontier energy levels, particularly the LUMO, are deepened owing to the addition of two thiophene-2-carbonitrile electron-withdrawing groups. F8-DPPTCN molecules exhibit good electron mobility (up to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) in bulk heterojunction blends thus leaving hole mobility as an important parameter to be optimized. When blended thin films are cast from a single solvent, the system shows a weak phase separation, and this morphology can be manipulated by using thermal annealing and additive approaches. The best performing solar cells are obtained by using an additive processing method, and the active layer shows a multi-length scale morphology. In the device, a PCE of 2.37%, a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 6.25 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.39 are obtained.

After removing the solvent, the product was purified using column chromatography (silica gel) with petroleum ether/dichloromethane (1:4) as the first eluent and dichloromethane/ethyl acetate (50:1) as the second eluent, yielding a dark brown solid (0.23 g, 70%). δH (400 MHz, CDCl3): 9.07 (d, J = 4.1 Hz, 2H), 8.86 (d, J = 4.1 Hz, 2H), 7.76 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.70 (dd, J = 7.9, 1.4 Hz, 2H), 7.64 (s, 2H), 7.58 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 7.56 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 7.41 (d, J = 4.1 Hz, 2H), 7.26 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 3.99–4.18 (m, 8H), 2.03–2.12 (m, 4H), 1.84–2.02 (m, 4H), 1.23–1.48 (m, 32H), 1.02–1.20 (m, 24H), 0.85–0.98 (m, 24H), 0.78 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 6H). δC (400 MHz, CDCl3): 161.84, 161.42, 152.25, 151.14, 143.13, 141.37, 141.02, 138.78, 138.37, 138.03, 137.71, 135.77, 132.35, 130.69, 128.39, 126.87, 125.51, 124.59, 124.47, 120.75, 120.27, 113.84, 109.47, 108.88, 108.11, 55.53, 46.00, 40.27, 39.34, 39.30, 31.74, 30.43, 30.42, 30.34, 30.32, 29.94, 29.19, 28.56, 28.50, 23.85, 23.73, 23.70, 23.14, 23.09, 22.58, 14.12, 14.09, 14.04, 10.63, 10.60.

4.2. Device fabrication and characterization
Organic solar cells were fabricated on glass substrates commercially pre-coated with a layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). Prior to fabrication, the substrates were cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol consecutively for every 15 min, and then treated in an ultraviolet ozone generator for 15 min before being spin-coated with a layer of 35 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P AI4083). After baking the PEDOT:PSS layer in air at 140 °C for 15 min, the substrates were transferred to a glovebox. The active layer was spin-cast at 5000 rpm from a solution of P3HT and F8-DPPTCN in chloroform with different blend weight ratios at a total solid concentration of 20 mg mL−1. The samples were annealed at 95 °C for 10 min. Then a 5 nm thick PFN film was deposited as the cathode buffer layer by spin-coating a solution of 0.4 mg mL−1 PFN in methanol because PFN could reduce greatly the work function of the cathode, in favor of electron collection in the OSCs. Subsequently, the samples were loaded into a vacuum deposition chamber (background pressure ≈ 5 × 10−4 Pa) to deposit a 100 nm thick aluminum cathode with a shadow mask (the device area was 5.2 mm2).
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs were measured with Keithley 2400 measurement source units at room temperature in air. The photocurrent was measured under a calibrated solar simulator (Abet 300 W) at 100 mW cm−2 and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard photovoltaic (PV) reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured with a Stanford lock-in amplifier 8300 unit.
The charge carrier mobilities of the P3HT:F8-DPPTCN films were measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:F8-DPPTCN/MoO3/Al, electron-only devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PFN/P3HT:F8-DPPTCN/PFN/Al. The device characteristics were extracted by modeling the dark current under forward bias using the SCLC expression described by the Mott–Gurney law: (1)here, εr ≈ 3 is the average dielectric constant of the blend film, ε0 is the permittivity of the free space, μ is the carrier mobility, L ≈ 100 nm is the thickness of the film, and V is the applied voltage.
4.3. Morphology characterization
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) characterization of the active layer was performed at beamline 7.3.3, Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). The X-ray energy was 10 keV while operating in the top off mode. The scattering intensity was recorded on a 2D image plate (Pilatus 2M) with a pixel size of 172 μm (1475 × 1679 pixels). The sample-to-detector distance was about 300 mm. The incidence angle was chosen to be 0.16°, which was above the critical angle of BHJ thin films but below the critical angle of wafer substrates. OPV samples were prepared on PEDOT:PSS covered Si wafers in a similar manner to the OPV devices. Resonant soft X-ray scattering experiments were carried out in beamline 11.0.1.2, ALS, LBNL. Experiments were done in transmission geometry. BHJ thin films were allowed to flow in water and transferred onto silicon nitride windows from Norcada Inc. Samples were loaded into a high vacuum chamber (∼10−7 torr) to avoid carbon contamination in an ambient environment. A photon energy of 285.2 eV was used in running the experiments, which gave the best contrast at the carbon K-edge. 300 nm polystyrene spheres were used as a standard to calibrate the sample-to-detector distance.
