    , Accepted 14th December 2011First published on 6th January 2012AbstractWe report for the first time the synthesis and photovoltaic application of a naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT) containing donor–acceptor conjugated copolymer. The combination of a thiophene-bridge NDT building block with a quinoxaline acceptor unit results in a new copolymer that has an optical band gap of 1.77 eV, a HOMO level of −5.24 eV, and a hole mobility of 5.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Preliminary characterization of the bulk-heterojunction solar cell device exhibits a PCE of around 1.5%.
In recent years, phase-separated blends of π-conjugated polymers as donors with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as acceptors have attracted tremendous attention for their use in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). This has led to the development of low cost, large area, and solution-processed flexible solar cell devices.1 The concept of alternating electron-rich donor (D) units and electron-deficient acceptor (A) units on a conjugated molecular backbone was introduced as a particularly feasible way to yield more photons by lowering the optical band gaps while retaining suitable electronic energy levels.2 Ever since the realization of the need for alternative donor materials other than regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),3 numerous D–A conjugated copolymers have been developed. These include dithienosilole (DTS), carbazole, and fluorene units as donors and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), 5,5′-bithiazole, and thienopyrazine units as acceptors. These copolymers were developed to tune the absorption bands and energy levels to those which enable solution-processed BHJ PSCs to provide power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2–5%.4
Recent studies of conjugated D–A polymers for PSC applications have further demonstrated that the incorporation of π-conjugated, rigidly fused thiophene rings on conjugated polymer backbones is a promising approach in the development of highly efficient photoactive semiconductor materials. Fused thiophene rings are known to favor coplanar conformations through enhanced π⋯π overlap, which extends the π-conjugation length and facilitates intra- and interchain charge transfers, resulting in high charge carrier mobility.5 Charge transport mobility is one of the most important determining factors for the efficient device performance. Materials with high charge carrier mobility enable better charge transport within the active layers with negligible photocurrent loss.6 In recent literature, several π-conjugated, rigidly fused thiophene semiconductors have been reported to have efficient photovoltaic effects.7 Of these, the large, planar benzodithiophene (BDT) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers that have delivered PSCs with a PCE of up to 8%.8,1b It is believed that the development of new monomers may lead to the synthesis of interesting polymers with desirable optoelectronic properties that can potentially allow PSCs to offer a high PCE in excess of 10%.9
During our ongoing efforts in the development of a new π-conjugated, fused thiophene unit, we became interested in naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT), another symmetrical, planar, π-conjugated, and rigidly fused potential semiconductor with two thiophene rings fused at the end of a naphthalene unit. Takimiya and co-workers developed a scalable synthetic route for this new building block.10a Recently, they reported a new series of semiconducting polymers that use NDT and alkylated bithiophene for organic field effect transistor (OFET) applications.10b The OFETs based on these polymers exhibited excellent transistor behavior with a maximum mobility (μ) of 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1 and high current on/off ratios (Ion/Ioff) of up to 108. Although, some structural isomers, such as naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene7f,h and naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene,7i have recently been explored as potential units in D–A conjugated polymers/small molecules, this naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene building block with thiophene rings fused at different positions of the naphthalene moiety has not yet been explored in the D–A conjugated polymer for PSCs, despite having π-core planarity, highly ordered π–π stacking, and excellent hole mobility, all of which are determinants for high charge transport in photovoltaic devices, likely to lack solubilizing (alkyl chain) units. Taking into account the above issues, we envisioned that if thiophene (as a π-bridge) having longer alkyl groups could be attached at the 2- and 7-position of the NDT core, then this can also be explored for the synthesis of alternating D–A conjugated copolymers that can be processed in solution and may lead to a novel family of π-conjugated semiconductors with potential uses in optoelectronic applications including OPVs.
In this communication, we report the synthesis and application of a novel thiophene-bridge NDT-containing, conjugated, alternating D–A, low band gap polymer, poly[2,7-bis(3-hexadecylthiophene-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-5,5′-diyl-alt-2,3-bis-(4-octyloxyphenyl)-5,8-dithiophen-2-yl-quinoxaline-5,5′-diyl] (PTNDTT-QX). To design the first NDT-based D–A conjugated polymer, we polymerized this with a quinoxaline acceptor. Quinoxaline derivatives were shown to have potential as electron-deficient units for creating low band gap conjugated polymers.11 It is commonly known that alkoxy groups have stronger electron donating effects than alkyl ones and electron acceptors containing an alkoxy substituent show deeper HOMO values and thereby higher Voc in solar cell devices. Apart from inducing a high Voc value, the alkoxy groups also help to improve the solubility and processibility of the resulting polymer, which are critical material parameters for applications in large-scale device production. Hence, we preferred to introduce an alkyl substituent in the donor and an alkoxy substituent in the acceptor for tuning the lower HOMO of the resulting polymer. The synthetic routes to the monomers and the polymers are shown in Scheme 1 (see ESI† for synthetic details). The key unit, NDT, was synthesized in four steps starting from commercially available 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene.10a To make it suitable for solution processing, 3-hexadecanyl thiophene units were introduced at the 2- and 7-position of the NDT core by a Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction between 2,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (6) and 2-bromo-3-hexadecylthiophene. The co-monomer, 2,3-bis-(4-octyloxyphenyl)-5,8-bis(5-bromo thiophene-2-yl)-quinoxaline (11), was synthesized in two steps, starting from 9, according to a previously established procedure.12 As shown in Scheme 1, the copolymer, PTNDTT-QX, was synthesized from monomers 8 and 11 using a Stille coupling reaction in refluxing anhydrous chlorobenzene under argon atmosphere and in the presence of Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 as a catalyst. The resulting polymer exhibited excellent solubility in most of the tested organic solvents, including tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). The molecular weights of PTNDTT-QX were determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in THF, based on a calibration with monodisperse polystyrene standards. The copolymer had a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 12.3 kDa and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 6.32 (Fig. S4, ESI†). The relatively high PDI can likely be attributed to the ineffectiveness of Stille polymerization for growing PTNDTT-QX with high molecular weight.13 However, it is noteworthy that in spite of its low molecular weight, the copolymer has excellent thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperature (Td) around 411 °C (Fig. S5, ESI†). The DSC measurements did not reveal any phase transition behaviors up to about 350 °C (Fig. S6, ESI†).

The normalized absorption spectra of PTNDTT-QX, both in solution and as thin film from ODCB, are shown in Fig. 1, and the related optical properties are listed in Table S1 in the ESI†. The solution absorption spectra of PTNDTT-QX showed a broad absorption band in the range of 300–700 nm with maximum absorption peaks at 430 nm and 544 nm arising from the π–π* transition in the conjugated units and intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between the NDT and QX moieties. The absorption spectrum of the PTNDTT-QX film in ODCB was red-shifted from solution with more intense peaks at longer wavelengths. This presumably indicates the formation of π-stacked intermolecular packing through inter-chain delocalization or chain planarization.14 The optical band gap (Egopt) obtained from the absorption onset of the PTNDTT-QX film was 1.77 eV, which was similar to that of our recently reported dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene/dithienoquinoxaline copolymer (PTDTTT-QX) (Egopt = 1.74 eV).15 The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve recorded for PTNDTT-QX referenced to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode is displayed in Fig. S8 (ESI†). On the anodic sweep, PTNDTT-QX exhibited an irreversible oxidation peak with an onset potential (Eonsetox) of 0.84 V (versusAg/AgCl). The HOMO energy level of PTNDTT-QX was determined to be −5.24 eV from the corresponding Eonsetox according to the following equation: EHOMO = −e(Eonsetox + 4.4) (eV).16 Based on the correlation between the HOMO energy level and Egopt, estimated from the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the film sample (Eg = EHOMO − ELUMO), the LUMO energy level of PTNDTT-QX was calculated to be −3.47 eV (Table S1, ESI†). A comparison of the energy levels between PTNDTT-QX and PC71BM in Fig. 1b revealed that the LUMO of PTNDTT-QX is well-aligned with that of PC71BM with energy difference >0.3 eV, indicating that excitons can expeditiously dissociate at the interface of PTNDTT-QX and PC71BM.17 This relatively low HOMO level (compared to that of the well-investigated P3HT) may also improve the Voc on construction of the photovoltaic cells.18

The hole mobility of PTNDTT-QX was determined using an organic thin film transistor (OTFT) device with a bottom gate and top contact device configuration built on an n-doped octyltrichlorosilane (OTS-8)-treated silicon wafer as described in the ESI†.14,19PTNDTT-QX exhibited a hole mobility of 5.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 102 at room temperature (Fig. S9, ESI†). However, no significant improvement was obtained after thermal annealing.
To explore the photovoltaic performances of PTNDTT-QX, bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated using PTNDTT-QX as the donor and a fullerene derivative, PC71BM, as the acceptor with the device architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTNDTT-QX:PC71BM/LiF/Al. During the preliminary device optimization process, a number of cells were constructed in ODCB solvent with different PTNDTT-QX/PC71BM weight ratios (from 1:1 to 1:4) to investigate the effect of blending ratio (Fig. S10 and Table S2, ESI†). Under illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), the device with a PTNDTT-QX:PC71BM weight ratio of 1:2 and with an active layer thickness around 65 nm demonstrated the best PCE of 1.44%, a short-circuit density (Jsc) of 4.52 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 46.0%. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cell devices are shown in Fig. 2, along with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve with a 1:2 weight ratio of PTNDTT-QX to PC71BM. The EQE curve of the device (Fig. 2b) exhibits efficient photon-conversion in the visible region from 400 to 700 nm with maximum EQE values of 38% at 476 nm. The pattern of the EQE curve is similar to the corresponding absorption of the PTNDTT-QX:PC71BM blend film (also shown in Fig. 2b), indicating that the absorption of both components contributed to the conversion of photocurrent.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the active layer morphologies of the blended films containing PTNDTT-QX and PC71BM, with results presented in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The AFM image for PTNDTT-QX/PC71BM blend film at 1:2 w/w ratios showed smooth morphology with a root-mean-square (rms) roughness less than 1 nm, suggesting that PTNDTT-QX was highly compatible with PC71BM. Although the photovoltaic device based on PTNDTT-QX exhibited reasonably good Voc and FF values, the unsatisfying PCE is mainly attributed to the low Jsc, despite its low band gap (1.77 eV) and broad coverage of the absorption spectrum. The low Jsc is likely related to the low hole mobility (ca. 5.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).
In conclusion, the first naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene containing D–A conjugated polymer PTNDTT-QX was synthesized combined with a quinoxaline acceptor unit for application in PSCs. PTNDTT-QX provided a good thermal stability (Td ≈ 411 °C), a low band gap (1.77 eV) and a deep HOMO level (−5.24 eV). Preliminary studies of BHJ solar cells based on blends of PTNDTT-QX:PC71BM showed a PCE of 1.44% without any thermal or additive treatments. Although the PCE of PSCs using PTNDTT-QX as a donor does not yet reach the value desired for application, we believe that the performance of the solar cells can be improved by modifying the device morphology (using co-solvent, annealing, and processing additives). New molecular structures designed with NDT are expected to allow more precise tuning for desirable band gaps, energy levels, and charge carrier mobility, hopefully leading to better performance. The work in this direction is currently going on in our laboratory, and results will be presented in due course.
