    , Accepted 13th March 2015First published on 13th March 2015AbstractInspired by the successful utilization of silicon cores axially coordinated by trihexylsiloxy groups in naphthalo/phthalocyanine dyes, using ullazine-based dye JD21 as the prototype, we designed three novel silicon-core JD analogues in this work. Based on the theoretical analysis on the four dyes and the corresponding dye/(TiO2)38 complexes, the Y2 dye with the dithienosilole (DTS) conjugation unit is recognized as a star molecule for its impressive performance in various aspects, including remarkable light-harvesting capability, large driving force for dye regeneration (ΔGreg = 0.65 eV), excellent balance between the rates of electron injection (kinj = 1.48 × 1012 s−1) and electron–hole recombination (krec = 1.68 × 1010 s−1), and high stability for the adsorbed system Y2/(TiO2)38. It is thus proposed as a promising candidate for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted continuous attention1–3 since the pioneering work by Grätzel et al. in 1991.4 One of the most vital components in DSCs is dye molecules, which are responsible for light harvesting and electron injection at the dye/semiconductor interface. To improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSCs, current studies on dye molecules mainly focus on two aspects. One is the use of metal–organic dyes, such as the state-of-the-art zinc–porphyrin dyes5,6 and Ru(II) polypyridyl dyes.7,8 Quite recently, a solar cell devised with a benzothiadiazole (BTD)-based zinc-porphyrin dye (SM315) has been reported to achieve a record PCE of 13% without any co-sensitizer.9 The other involves the use of organic molecules featuring the donor–π-linker–acceptor (D–π–A) structure.10–12 Recently, an efficiency of 10.65% has been attained by the YA422-sensitized solar cell, indicating the significant influence of donor size on dye performance.13 It has also been shown that the properties of dyes are affected by the nature of π-conjugation units14 as well as the acceptor moiety.15,16 For example, by forming the firm Si–O–Ti (titanosiloxane) bonds between dyes and the TiO2 substrate, organosilicon compounds such as ADEKA-1 show their charming potential in DSC applications.17,18
The ullazine group, which is a nitrogen-containing heterocycle with 16-π electrons, is a promising unit in DSCs due to its strong intramolecular charge transfer. Ullazine-based dyes (denoted as JD-dyes) were first synthesized and used as optoelectronic materials in DSCs by Grätzel et al. in 2013.19 Among the tested devices, a solar cell sensitized by a low-molecular-weight (MW) JD21 dye shows remarkable photovoltaic performance (MW = 638 g mol−1, PCE = 8.4%). Since then, a few theoretical investigations on JD-dyes have been carried out by Meng et al.20,21 to explore potentially efficient sensitizers for DSCs. However, the relatively planar geometry of the ullazine group in JD-dyes may increase unfavorable dye aggregation on the semiconductor surface, and consequently hinder their further applications in DSCs. In this paper, inspired by the successful utilization of silicon cores axially coordinated by trihexylsiloxy groups in naphthalo/phthalocyanine dyes,22,23 we designed a series of silicon-core JD analogues based on the JD21 backbone, by introducing three classic π-conjugation units (cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT),24,25 dithienosilole (DTS),26 and dithienopyrrole (DTP)25,27) between ullazine and cyanoacrylic acid groups. The newly engineered dyes were named Y1, Y2 and Y3, respectively (see Scheme 1). Systematic investigations show that the DTS-containing Y2 dye displays remarkable light-harvesting capability, favorable thermodynamic properties, good kinetic parameters, and high stability for the adsorbed system Y2/(TiO2)38. It is thus proposed as a potential dye toward more efficient DSCs.

2. Computational details
The geometric optimizations of the ground-state dyes were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP functional28 coupled with a 6-31G(d,p) basis set in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) solution. Bulk solvent effects of CH2Cl2 were included by means of the conducting polarizable continuum model (C-PCM).29 Frequency analysis was then performed to confirm the nature of all structures at the same theory level as geometric optimizations. Based on the optimized geometries, optical properties were obtained by calculating vertical transitions of the lowest 50 singlet–singlet excited states in the CH2Cl2 solution using time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) using the coulomb-attenuating method (CAM-B3LYP)30 and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.
To obtain the excited-state (ESOP) and ground-state oxidation potentials (GSOP, also denoted as ΔGox), two values reflecting the driving forces for electron injection and dye regeneration respectively, geometric optimizations of dyes in their excited, oxidized, and ground states were carried out in CH2Cl2 solution by the CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) method (the related details have been discussed in our previous paper on squaraine dyes31). All calculations mentioned above were implemented in the Gaussian 09 program package.32
The electronic coupling between dyes and the semiconductor (anatase) surface through anchoring groups was also investigated. As already known, the (101), (001), and (100) facets are the three most frequently exposed facets in natural anatase samples.33 Among these three facets, the most stable (101) facet is observed to dominate the anatase crystal surface (more than 94% of the exposed surface is constituted by the TiO2 (101) facet).34,35 Therefore, the current study of dye adsorption on anatase will focus on the TiO2 (101) surface. In the present case, a (TiO2)38 cluster, which was obtained by cutting an anatase slab with the (101) surface exposed, was used to simulate the TiO2 nanoparticle. Here, dye/(TiO2)38 complexes were optimized using spin-unrestricted DFT with the PBE functional36,37 and double-numeric quality basis set with polarization functions (DNP) in CH2Cl2 solution, where the solvation effects were considered by the conductor-like screening model (COSMO).38 These calculations were carried out by the DMol3 package in Materials Studio.39,40 The convergence criteria for energy, force, and displacement were 2 × 10−5 Ha, 4 × 10−3 Ha Å−1 and 5 × 10−3 Å, respectively, with a Fermi smearing of 0.005 hartree (1 Ha = 27.2114 eV) and a global orbital cutoff of 4.5 Å. Based on the DMol3-optimized dye/(TiO2)38 complexes, single-point DFT and TD-DFT calculations in the CH2Cl2 solution were performed in Gaussian 09 to obtain electronic and optical properties of adsorbed dyes at the same theoretical level as that for isolated dyes.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structures and properties of JD-dyes
With the aid of DFT and TD-DFT approaches, it is possible to scrutinize dyes from their energy levels and light-harvesting capabilities. It is well known that a dye should be ruled out as a sensitizer in DSCs when its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is energetically higher than the redox potential of the electrolyte (I−/I3−), its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is below the conduction band (CB) edge of the semiconductor (commonly TiO2), or it has worse optical properties. With these criteria, the electronic and optical properties of the investigated dyes were calculated. As shown in Fig. 1, all dyes exhibit appropriate HOMO/LUMO energy levels, which ensure a fast and unidirectional electron transfer process. In addition, all newly designed dyes display additional absorption bands around 400 nm compared with the original JD21 dye (Fig. 2 and S1†), although slight blue shifts at the maximum absorption (λmax) were observed. The absorption around 400 nm for the newly designed dyes fills the absorption dip well in the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) curve as in the case of JD21 (Fig. S2, see the ESI† for details about the LHE curve). In particular, the designed silicon-core dye with DTS as the π-conjugation bridge (Y2) has an absorption almost spreading from 300 to 600 nm, showing good capability in light harvesting. Therefore, a DSC sensitized by the Y2 dye is expected to attain a comparable short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) potential to that by JD21. The properties upon photo-excitation are summarized in Table 1, and the main frontier molecular orbitals responsible for the λmax of dyes are given in Fig. S3.† It can be found from Table 1 that the transition from HOMO to LUMO is the most important contribution to the λmax of all dyes. The HOMOs of all dyes almost delocalize over the whole dye molecules with a larger proportion on the ullazine/ullazine-like group, while the LUMOs are localized mostly at the π-conjugation units and acceptor part (Fig. S3†). This implies the good capability of charge separation upon photo-excitation.

3.2 Dyes adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface

3.2.1 Electronic and optical properties of dye/(TiO2)38 complexes. 
It is well known that the efficiency of electron injection is strongly dependent on the electronic coupling between the dye and the semiconductor surface. It was reported by Meng et al. that the tridentate-bridging (TB) mode, where one interface O–Ti bond, one N–Ti bond, and an additional hydrogen bond between the anchor group and TiO2 are formed, is more stable in energy for the adsorbed dye than the bidentate-bridging (BB) configuration.20,21 In the present work, many attempts were made to find such a stable TB configuration but we failed. Therefore, dye/(TiO2)38 complexes with BB configurations were employed in the following investigations.
Using the same computational procedure as for free dyes, we obtained the UV-vis spectra of dye/(TiO2)38 complexes. It is demonstrated that all adsorbed dyes show red-shifted absorption spectra compared to the corresponding free dyes (Fig. 2 and S1†). For Y-dye/(TiO2)38 complexes, the amounts of red-shift at λmax are larger (ca. 60 nm) than that of the JD21/(TiO2)38 complex (30 nm). As shown in Fig. S2,† the adsorbed JD21 presents a similar dip in the LHE curve to that in the isolated state. Relative to the bound JD21, the Y1/(TiO2)38 and Y2/(TiO2)38 complexes harvest light at higher efficiency with broader spectral response (the LHEs almost reach 100% in the range of 300–750 nm). The analysis of the most important single-particle excitations reveals that the HOMOs of dye/(TiO2)38 complexes delocalize over whole dye molecules, while the LUMOs mainly localize on the TiO2 nanoparticle (Fig. 3 and S4†). Such an orbital distribution is beneficial to the charge transfer at the dye/semiconductor interface, and is essential for constructing a cell with high electron-injection efficiency.

3.2.2 Shift of the conduction band edge. 
Besides the broad spectral response, a potential cell should also possess a high open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) value. The Voc of a DSC is directly relevant to the conduction band (CB) edge (ECB) of a semiconductor. As stated by De Angelis and his coworkers, the adsorption of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface can induce a shift of the conduction band profile of TiO2 (ΔECB).41 In order to evaluate the ΔECB of TiO2 in our systems, the total densities of states (TDOS) for bare TiO2 and the projected densities of states (PDOS) for TiO2 in dye/(TiO2)38 complexes were calculated. The related curves were plotted using a Gaussian function. A linear fit of the low energy profile in the range from 20% to 80% of the maximum height was subsequently performed and the intercept of this line with the energy axis was taken as ECB (Fig. 4 and S5†). The detailed results are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the adsorption of a dye on the TiO2 surface results in an upshift of the CB edge. The amount of CB shift (ΔECB) of JD21 (0.061 eV) is larger than those of Y-dyes (∼0.04 eV). It was also demonstrated by De Angelis et al. that the effects of a dye on ΔECB can be divided into two, namely, charge transfer (CT) and electrostatic (EL) effects.41 The occurrence and extent of CT at the dye–titanium interface can be examined through isodensity contour plots of electron density difference and the charge displacement (CD) analysis.42 In the dye/(TiO2)38 adsorbed systems (Fig. 5 and S6†), an evident rearrangement of electron density can be observed in both the dye and semiconductor surface compared to the isolated fragments. In particular, significant depletion of electron density happens around the cyanoacrylic acid group, and electron density accumulates mainly at the dye–TiO2 interface, which can be quantitatively characterized by the CD curve (Fig. 5 and S6†). Among all investigated complexes, the minimum CT was observed in the Y1/(TiO2)38 system (0.37 e−), indicating a weaker interaction between Y1 and TiO2 (Table 2). The EL (primarily due to the dye dipole) contribution to ΔECB can be obtained by the analysis of the average dye electrostatic potential on the TiO2 surface (VEL). It was found that the calculated VEL values of all Y-dyes (−6.0 eV) are much larger than that of JD21 (−0.7 eV) (Table 2). With these results, it can be concluded that, upon dye adsorption onto the TiO2 surface, the charge transfer from a dye to the TiO2 surface shows a larger contribution to ΔECB compared to the electrostatic potential (see the ESI† for details about the CD curve and VEL analysis).

 Fig. 5  Isodensity contour plot and charge displacement curve for JD21 adsorbed onto TiO2 in the BB configuration. The red surface identifies the region in which the electron density decreases. The zone of density accumulation is marked in blue. 
To enhance the performance of a DSC device, a suitable amount of cations (one or several kinds of cations in a certain ratio) is often involved in the electrolyte, to regulate the CB position of the semiconductor43 and the electron-injection efficiency of the excited dye.44,45 In this work, the influence of such ions on CB shift has been examined by modeling dye/cation co-adsorbed systems, where a commonly used cationic species, namely the tetra-n-butylammonium ion (TBA+), is adsorbed on the surface of a (TiO2)38 cluster together with the investigated dyes.
To optimize the JD21–TBA+ and Y1–TBA+ adducts, four initial conformations were employed by keeping the TBA+ cation close to the electron-rich moieties of dye molecules. The geometries of these conformers optimized in the dichloromethane solution are provided in Fig. S7 and S8,† along with their relative energies. In the lowest-energy configuration of the JD21–TBA+ adduct (Conf. 3), the TBA+ cation is located near the in-plane nitrogen of the ullazine group, whereas the conformer with TBA+ close to the cyanoacrylic acid group is the most stable for the Y1–TBA+ adduct (Conf. 4). The corresponding binding energy of each most stable configuration was also computed, which is defined as the difference between the energy of the adduct and the energy sum of isolated fragments.46 Thus, positive/negative values indicate destabilization/stabilization of the dye–TBA+ adduct compared to the isolated species. Here, the negative binding energies between JD21/Y1 and TBA+ (−0.86 eV and −0.78 eV, respectively, see Table 2) clearly suggest the tendency to form stable dye–TBA+ adducts in solutions.
With the stable geometries of dye–TBA+ adducts, geometric optimizations of dye–TBA+ co-adsorbed systems were performed (Fig. S9†). Our calculations show that the co-adsorption results in a downshift of the CB edge by ca. 0.1 eV compared with the mono-adsorption of dye molecules (Fig. 4 and S5†), which may decrease the Voc of a cell and reduce the efficiency of electron injection from an excited dye to TiO2. Therefore, an overall consideration should be made in the fabrication of a cell.


3.2.3 Thermodynamic and kinetic properties of dye/(TiO2)38 complexes. 
Due to the direct relevance of ESOP to electron injection and of GSOP to the regeneration of an oxidized dye, the values of ESOP and GSOP become crucial. The energy difference between ESOP and the CB edge of TiO2 is the driving force for the electron injection (ΔGinj) from an excited-state dye to the semiconductor, while the energy difference between GSOP and the oxidation potential of a redox couple is the driving force for the regeneration of an oxidized dye (ΔGreg). It has been known that a typical driving force required for electron injection is usually on the order of tenths of an eV, while the one for the regeneration of an oxidized dye should be at least 0.4 eV with the I−/I3− redox shuttle.22 Keeping this in mind, the ESOP and GSOP of the studied dyes were computed using the previously reported procedure which has been successfully applied to both Ru(II) polypyridyl and several organic dyes.31,47 The obtained ESOP, GSOP, and driving forces for electron injection (ΔGinj) and dye regeneration (ΔGreg) are summarized in Table 3. One can find in Table 3 that the ESOP values for all investigated dyes are obviously higher in energy than the CB edge of titanium, thus suggesting thermodynamically favorable injection of the first excited electron from the adsorbate to the substrate (ΔGinj of the investigated dyes is in the range of 1.1–1.9 eV). It can further be found that Y1 and Y2 show a cathodic shift of ESOP relative to JD21, which leads to smaller ΔGinj for Y1 and Y2 (∼1.1 eV). Though the ΔGinj values of Y1 and Y2 are smaller, they are sufficient for Y1 and Y2 to effectively inject electrons to TiO2. On the other hand, for all investigated dyes, the amount of lowering of GSOP compared to the redox potential of I−/I3− is satisfactory for the regeneration of oxidized dyes (Table 3). In particular, for Y-dyes, the significant downshifts of GSOP by ∼0.2 eV compared to that of JD21 finally result in larger driving forces for the regeneration of oxidized Y-dyes (ΔGreg of Y-dyes are ca. 0.6 eV).

Another simplified, but informative, way to assess the efficiencies of electron injection and dye regeneration is to analyze spin density distributions in the corresponding one-electron-reduced and one-electron-oxidized species (see Fig. 6 and S10†). Such an approach has been successfully applied to several systems, including pyridinium-based and ruthenium polypyridyl dyes.44,48–50 It appears that the spin densities of all reduced dye/(TiO2)38 complexes almost entirely localize on the TiO2 substrate, as a result of the sufficient driving forces for electron injection. However, it seems quite different in oxidized complexes. The holes of all oxidized dye/(TiO2)38 complexes are delocalized over the whole dye molecules with larger proportions on ullazine/ullazine-like groups. It has been further found that the two benzenes at the periphery of the ullazine-like group in Y-dye/(TiO2)38 complexes show a larger spin distribution, compared to that in the JD21 complex. The greater distribution of holes in the donor moieties of Y-dyes can enhance interactions between the oxidized Y-dyes and the I−/I3− redox couple. These strong interactions, together with the larger ΔGreg values for oxidized Y-dyes, may eventually lead to faster regeneration of Y-dyes, compared to the oxidized JD21.
 Fig. 6  Spin densities of the reduced (a) and oxidized (a′) JD21/(TiO2)38 complexes. 
The above results show that in JD21 and Y-dyes HOMO is mainly localized at the ullazine/ullazine-like heterocycle, while the LUMO is primarily located at the cyanoacrylic acid group (Fig. S3†). Upon irradiation, one electron is excited from HOMO to LUMO, and is subsequently injected to the CB of TiO2. Thus, the distance between the dye anchor and the TiO2 surface (Fig. S11†) can be defined as the distance of electron injection (rinj). With this, the rinj values for all dyes are obtained (all of them are about 2.0 Å, as summarized in Table 3). On the other hand, the injected electron may be transferred back from the CB of TiO2 to the HOMO orbital of the dye, which is the electron–hole recombination process. The distance of recombination (rrec) can be roughly estimated from the distance between the donor center of the dye (the silicon atom in the present case) and the TiO2 surface (Fig. S11†). The obtained rrec values for JD21 and Y-dyes are ∼9 and ∼16 Å, respectively (Table 3). The longer rrec distances in Y-dyes probably imply weaker recombination compared to JD21.
In the present work, the rates of injection and recombination were estimated by using an empirical model based on the Marcus theory.20 According to this theory, the rate of nonadiabatic electron transfer between two centers is calculated by (1)where A is a constant (2.5 × 10−2), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, λ is the reorganization energy in eV, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the room temperature (289.15 K), β is the attenuation factor (0.7 Å−1), r is the distance of electron transfer in Å, and ΔG0 is the driving force of the reaction in units of eV.
The obtained values are reported in Table 3. It turns out that Y-dyes show evidently faster electron injection than the original JD21 dye. The rate of electron injection (kinj) is 1.83 × 1012, 1.48 × 1012, 5.84 × 10−2 and 1.44 × 10−5 s−1 for Y1, Y2, Y3 and JD21, respectively. The faster injection for Y-dyes may efficiently decrease the rapid decay of a dye from the excited state to the ground state. Different from the obvious change of kinj in the studied dyes, there exist smaller differences in the rates of electron–hole recombination (krec). The Y3 dye with the dithienopyrrole unit presents the slowest recombination among all dyes. The krec of dyes follows the order Y3 (9.38 × 109 s−1) < JD21 (1.44 × 1010 s−1) < Y2 (1.68 × 1010 s−1) < Y1 (2.95 × 1010 s−1). Compared with JD21, the faster electron injection and comparable electron–hole recombination make the Y2 dye the champion molecule in kinetic processes. It is also noted here that, although it is difficult to obtain accurate rates for injection and recombination from this kind of estimation, it is conceivable that the comparison of the rates obtained using the same model should give a useful indication on the performance of several similar dyes.


3.2.4 Long-term stability of the adsorbed systems. 
One of the main reasons for the lack of long-term stability in DSC devices is dye desorption from the surface of the semiconductor.51 In the current study, the stability of an adsorbed system can be roughly assessed from its adsorption energy, i.e. the difference between the energy of the optimized dye/(TiO2)38 complex and the energy sum of the isolated fragments. Compared with JD21, the more negative adsorption energies in Y-dyes (Table 2) may indicate stronger interactions between Y-dyes and the semiconductor surface. This can be further confirmed by the shorter bonds (within 2.0–2.1 Å) between the carboxylic oxygens and the coordinating titanium atoms in the oxidized Y-dye/(TiO2)38 complexes (Fig. 7 and S12†). These results may imply higher stabilities of Y-dye/(TiO2)38 complexes relative to JD21.

With the comprehensive examinations described above, the newly designed Y2 dye may be a promising candidate as a DSC sensitizer. The solar cell sensitized by Y2 is expected to exhibit improved DSC photovoltaic performance with high long-term stability.

4. Conclusions
In this work, inspired by the successful utilization of silicon cores axially coordinated by trihexylsiloxy groups in naphthalo/phthalocyanine dyes, three novel silicon-core JD analogues were designed based on the JD21 backbone. Detailed theoretical investigation of the light-harvesting capability, thermodynamic property, kinetic parameter, and long-term stability of the corresponding dye/semiconductor complex was performed to identify a potentially good dye for DSC application. Our results highlight the significant influence of the silicon atom on the performance of a JD21-based dye. In particular, the Y2 dye with the dithienosilole (DTS) conjugation unit is identified to be a promising dye molecule, for its impressive performance in various aspects, including remarkable light-harvesting capability (the light-harvesting efficiency almost reaches 100% in the range of 300–750 nm), large driving force for dye regeneration (ΔGreg = 0.65 eV), excellent balance between the rates of electron injection (kinj = 1.48 × 1012 s−1) and electron–hole recombination (krec = 1.68 × 1010 s−1), and high stability for the adsorbed system Y2/(TiO2)38. Therefore, the solar cell sensitized by Y2 is expected to exhibit improved DSC photovoltaic performance with high long-term stability. The present study may provide a rational guide for the experimental design of more efficient dyes for DSCs.
