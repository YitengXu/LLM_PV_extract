    , Accepted 6th December 2020First published on 9th December 2020AbstractPhotocatalytic conversion of CO2 into value-added chemical fuels with visible light provides a green method to relieve the challenges of the energy crisis and environmental problems. Developing highly efficient photocatalysts is essential to achieve this technology. Herein, we designed and successfully synthesized copper cobaltite/covalent triazine-based framework (CuCo2O4/CTF-1) Z-scheme heterojunction catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The obtained CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic CO production activity. The optimal properties were 12.7-fold and 11.6-fold higher than those of pure CTF-1 and CuCo2O4, respectively. According to the analysis of UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, CO2 uptake isotherms, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photocurrent responses, the enhanced photocatalytic CO production performance of CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites can be ascribed to its enhanced visible light absorption and CO2 adsorption capability, increased spatial separation of photoinduced charge carriers, and optimized redox ability resulting from the direct Z-scheme CuCo2O4/CTF-1 heterojunction. This work offers a novel strategy for designing and constructing CTF-based direct Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 conversion to chemical energy fuels.
1. Introduction
Converting CO2 into value-added chemical fuels such as CO, HCHO, CH3OH and CH4 through photocatalysis provides a sustainable solution to relieve the issues of both global warming and energy crisis.1–3 Since the initial research on the photoreduction of CO2 by Inoue et al. in 1979, a large number of semiconductor photocatalysts have been explored in an attempt to achieve desirable CO2 conversion performance.4–6 However, most developed photocatalysts suffered from certain limitations, such as unsatisfactory visible light utilization, low evolution efficiency, and poor product selectivity.7 Hence, exploiting efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts for CO2 conversion is highly challenging and desirable.
Recently, covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs), an emerging class of crystalline porous materials, have been designated to be potential candidates for solar-driven photocatalysts owing to their unique electronic structures, tunable crystallinity, and high thermochemical stability.8–10 It has been reported that the extended π-conjugated structure in CTFs can maintain their visible light responsive capability and simultaneously achieve effective electron transfer in photocatalytic reactions.11 Additionally, triazine rings in CTFs contain nitrogen-rich functionalities with strong Lewis basicity, which can be beneficial for activating CO2 and its further conversion.12 It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that CTFs could be a desirable photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. In our previous study, a covalent triazine-based framework (CTF-1) with a suitable band gap of 2.94 eV was explored.13,14 The more negative potential of the conduction band (CB) of CTF-1 (−1.03 V vs. NHE) than the standard reduction potential of CO2 to CO (−0.52 V vs. NHE) endowed it with the ability to reduce CO2 into valuable chemical fuels.15 However, the photocatalytic performance of the pristine CTF-1 remained to be improved owing to the unsatisfactory optical adsorption and rapid recombination of electron–hole pairs.16
The delicate design of Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts, which are comprised of two distinctive photocatalysts with staggered band structures, has been considered to be an effective strategy for accelerating the spatial separation and transfer of photoinduced electron–hole pairs.17–19 Meanwhile, a more positive valence band (VB) potential and a more negative CB potential compared to its single counterparts can be constructed in a typical Z-scheme photocatalytic system, thus optimizing the redox ability and associated photocatalytic performance.20 Recently, copper cobaltite (CuCo2O4), a p-type semiconductor, has been reported to possess a unique cobaltite spinel structure, excellent electrochemical performance, and chemical stability.21 The large amount of partially filled 3d-orbitals, such as Cu2+ (3d9) and Co3+ (3d6), in CuCo2O4 confers it with a strong ability to accept electrons and extend the lifetime of the electron–hole pairs, which is undoubtedly favorable for the photocatalytic reaction.22 Moreover, the existence of cobalt ions can enhance the electron affinity, which is beneficial for accelerating charge separation. As such, the rational coupling of CuCo2O4 with CTFs is expected to afford enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction properties.23,24
Herein, we coupled CuCo2O4 and CTF-1 to construct a direct Z-scheme CuCo2O4/CTF-1 heterojunction for photocatalytic CO2 conversion to CO, as depicted in Scheme 1. The photoelectrochemical properties of the as-synthesized composites were characterized, and their photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance was also evaluated. Moreover, the possible mechanism for boosting the photocatalytic activity of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites was discussed and proposed. Our work deepens the insight into the fabrication and mechanism of heterojunction-based photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 conversion based upon the CTFs system.

2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis
CTF-1 was synthesized by an aromatic nitrile trimerization reaction at low temperature with the catalyst of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.13,25 Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (50 mL) was slowly added to terephthalonitrile (6.40 g) at 0 °C. After vigorous stirring at 30 °C for 12 h, the viscous solution was solidified and then maintained at room temperature for three days. The obtained solid was smashed, filtered and washed with a mixed solution of dichloromethane diluted with ammonia until all solids were uniformly dispersed in the solution. Then, the solid was re-dispersed in ammonium hydroxide and stirred overnight. After repeatedly centrifuging and washing with distilled water and methanol, the solid was further extracted with methanol and dichloromethane, respectively. Finally, the resultant product was obtained via vacuum drying at 80 °C for 12 h and ground into powder. The color of the as-synthesized CTF-1 powder was light yellow.
The CuCo2O4 nanoparticles were prepared by a hydrothermal procedure followed by calcination.26 Typically, 0.135 g CuCl2, 0.52 g CoCl2 and 1.08 g urea were dissolved into 30 mL deionized water under continuous stirring. After complete dissolution, the obtained solution was then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 6 h. The resultant solid was repeatedly washed with distilled water and ethanol by centrifugation and then dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 6 h. The resulting solid was transferred into a tube furnace and calcined at 300 °C for 3 h in air, and finally the black CuCo2O4 nanoparticles were obtained.
The CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites were prepared by a thermal annealing method. In detail, 200.0 mg CTF-1 was added to 20.0 mL methanol. After being ultrasonically dispersed for 1 h, different amounts of CuCo2O4 (2.0 mg, 10.0 mg, 20.0 mg and 60.0 mg) were added, respectively, and then stirred for 4.5 h. Subsequently, the mixed suspension was heated at 80 °C to remove water, and the collected solid was further calcined at 250 °C for 2 h. Finally, the black-brown CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites with different CuCo2O4 loading contents were successfully fabricated and were denoted as CuCo2O4/CTF-1x (x = 1, 5, 10, 30), respectively. The subscript x represents the percentage mass ratio (x wt%) of CuCo2O4 over CTF-1. For reference, the mechanical mixture of CuCo2O4 and CTF-1 with the same ratio to CuCo2O4/CTF-15 were uniformly ground in a mortar and denoted as Mix.
2.2 Material characterization
The as-obtained catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) on a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 X-ray power diffractometer with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). A Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 spectrometer with KBr pellets was used to obtain the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra in transmission mode from 4000–400 cm−1. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was performed on a simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (STA 449C). The morphology of the obtained catalysts was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a Nova Nano SEM 230 microscopy (FEI Corp.) and a Tecnai G2 F20 microscope (FEI Corp.), respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was measured on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system, using monochromatized Al-Kα X-rays as the excitation source. All the binding energies were calibrated by setting the binding energies at 284.6 eV for charge corrections. The CO2 uptake capacity of the as-synthesized catalysts was determined on an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA). Solid-state UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of the different powder samples were examined on an Agilent Cary 5000 with BaSO4 as the reference sample at room temperature. Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed on an Edinburgh FL/FS900 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed on a Bruker EMX-10/12 ESR spectrometer.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Studies of the electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized photocatalysts were conducted using a CHI650E electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode photoelectrochemical quartz cell (counter electrode, platinum plate electrode; reference electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode; working electrode) in a solution of 0.20 M Na2SO4 (electrolyte solution) at room temperature. The preparation process of the working electrode was as follows. 5.0 mg catalyst powder was added to N,N-dimethylformamide (0.5 mL) by sonication to obtain a well-mixed colloid slurry. The fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were prepared in advance with a cover area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. Then, 10 μL of the obtained slurry was dipped onto the designated area; meanwhile, the uncovered parts were coated with epoxy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky measurements were investigated by a ZAHNHER IM6 instrument in 10 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] containing 0.1 M KCl mixed aqueous solution and 0.2 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte, respectively. The transient photocurrent response data were recorded with a CHI650E electrochemical workstation with 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as an electrolyte. The visible light source was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300C) with a 420 nm cut-off filter. Each experiment was tested repeatedly for three times under identical conditions.
2.4 Photocatalytic activity test
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction activities of pure CTF-1 and its hybrid CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites were evaluated in an airtight 40 mL quartz glass reactor. Typically, 10.0 mg photocatalyst powder and 7.0 mg [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O (denoted as Ru(bpy)32+) were dispersed in a CO2-saturated mixture solution [0.9 mL, triethanolamine/water/acetonitrile (TEOA/H2O/MeCN) = 1:2:3 (vol/vol)]. Then, the reactor was sealed and flushed 5 times with high purity CO2 gas (≥99.99%) to remove air. After CO2 bubbling for 30 min, the reactor was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter under magnetic stirring for 4 h. After the photocatalytic reaction, the produced products were analyzed by an Agilent 7820B gas chromatograph. 13C-labelled CO2 experiments were conducted following the same procedure except that 12CO2 was replaced by 13CO2. The isotope-labelled CO product was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, 5977B MSD, Agilent Technology Co.). The stability of CuCo2O4/CTF-1 was also tested via three successive photocatalytic CO2 reduction cycles. After a typical photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment, the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 sample was harvested by centrifugation, repeatedly washed with distilled water and ethanol, and vacuum-dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The recovered CuCo2O4/CTF-15 catalyst was used in the next photocatalytic reaction with the addition of a fresh hole sacrificial agent (TEOA) and photosensitizer (Ru(bpy)32+).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural and morphological analysis
The XRD patterns (Fig. 1a) of the as-synthesized pure CTF-1 and CuCo2O4 matched the patterns of previously reported CTF-1 and cubic spinel CuCo2O4 (JCPDS no. 01-1155), respectively.13,26 For the samples of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1x composites, the XRD patterns revealed the coexistence of CuCo2O4 and CTF-1, indicating the successful formation of CuCo2O4/CTF-1 heterojunctions, and the crystal structure of CTF-1 was not destroyed during the synthesis process. It can also be observed that the peak intensities of CTF-1 became weaker and those of CuCo2O4 became stronger with increasing content of CuCo2O4.
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns and (b) FTIR spectra of CTF-1, CuCo2O4 and the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites. 
The FTIR spectra of the CTF-1 and CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites both exhibited aromatic C–N heterocycles in the triazine unit with characteristic peaks located at 1508 cm−1 and 1357 cm−1,27 as depicted in Fig. 1b. This finding confirmed that CTF-1 maintained its chemical structure during the annealing process. As for the FTIR spectra of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites, an additional peak at 2228 cm−1 can be observed in comparation with pure CTF-1, which corresponds to the carbonitrile band. This observation can be explained by the partial decomposition of CTF-1 during the thermal treatment process.15 For the FTIR spectrum of pure CuCo2O4, two peaks appeared at 564.2 cm−1 and 667.5 cm−1, which correspond to the stretching vibrations of Cu–O and Co–O, respectively.28 Notably, the entire characteristic peaks of CTF-1 and CuCo2O4 can be clearly seen in the cases of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites. These observations collectively suggest the successful construction of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 heterojunction. In addition, TGA analysis was carried out; the masses of CTF-1 and CuCo2O4/CTF-15 decreased slightly at temperatures below 100 °C, which can be ascribed to the desorption of residual or physiosorbed water molecules and the decomposition of uncleaned organics.29,30 The CuCo2O4/CTF-15 sample was thermally stable below a relatively high temperature of up to approximately 250 °C (Fig. S1†), demonstrating its considerable thermal stability.
From the typical FESEM images, CuCo2O4 nanoparticles ranging in size from 80 to 150 nm were observed (Fig. 2a). The TEM images of pure CuCo2O4 (Fig. S2†) clearly showed that fine and irregular CuCo2O4 nanoparticles were evenly dispersed. The CTF-1 presented a graphene-like layered structure (Fig. S3†). After loading of CuCo2O4, the layered stacking structure of CTF-1 was maintained (Fig. 2b and c), and it is interesting to observe that much smaller CuCo2O4 nanoparticles (ca. 30–50 nm) were distributed on CTF-1; this may be due to the fact that CTF-1 can interact with Cu2+ and Co2+ to restrain the growth of CuCo2O4 nanoparticles during the synthesis process.31 The HRTEM images (Fig. 2d–f) of CuCo2O4/CTF-15 clearly showed lattice fringes with d-spacings of ca. 0.24 nm and 0.28 nm, which correspond to the (311) and (220) planes of CuCo2O4, respectively.32 It can also be observed that Cu and Co elements were uniformly dispersed on the surface of CTF-1 based on the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping (Fig. 2g). These results further demonstrate that CuCo2O4 was successfully loaded on the surface of CTF-1.

3.2 Surface chemical state analysis
The chemical valence states of the as-synthesized catalysts were analyzed by XPS measurements, as depicted in Fig. 3. The C 1s XPS spectra of CTF-1 (Fig. 3a) showed two peaks centered at 284.6 eV and 287.3 eV, which correspond to the C–C bond originating from sp2-hybridized aromatic carbon and the C–N bond in the triazine ring, respectively.33,34 Two new peaks located at 286.7 eV and 288.1 eV for CuCo2O4/CTF-15 were attributed to CN bonds and sp2-hybridized carbon (N–CN), respectively.25,33 These two peaks may be due to partial decomposition of CTF-1 during the thermal treatment process, which was in accordance with the FTIR results. As for the N 1s spectra of pure CTF-1 (Fig. 3b), the peak located at 399.2 eV was assigned to pyridinic N (CN–C).35 In comparison with pristine CTF-1, this peak of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composite slightly shifted toward lower binding energies (ca. 0.2 eV), which is indicative of the electronic interaction between CTF-1 and CuCo2O4. The O 1s spectrum (Fig. S4†) of CuCo2O4/CTF-15 showed two obvious peaks located at 529.4 eV and 531.2 eV, which was assigned to the lattice oxygen in the spinel structure and the oxygen of physically adsorbed H2O molecules. As for the Co 2p spectrum of CuCo2O4 (Fig. 3c), two typical peaks loaded at 780.2 eV and 795.3 eV, which were attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 spin–orbit peaks, respectively, associated with two satellite peaks (abbreviated as “sat.” in the figure).36,37 As for the Cu 2p spectrum of CuCo2O4 (Fig. 3d), there were two peaks loaded at 934.5 eV and 953.5 eV, which were ascribed to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 spin–orbit peaks, respectively, associated with two satellite peaks.21,36 Compared with pure CuCo2O4, the Co 2p signal of the CuCo2O4/CTF-15 composite was much weaker owing to the low loading content of CuCo2O4 on CTF-1 (5 wt%); it was found to be slightly shifted (ca. 1.2 eV) to the higher-energy region, and the peaks for the Cu 2p spectra shifted (ca. 0.7 eV) to the lower-energy region. Take together, the N 1s peak and Cu 2p peaks down-shifted and the Co 2p peaks up-shifted in the CuCo2O4/CTF-15 composite compared with pure CTF-1 and CuCo2O4, implying that the triazine rings of CTF-1 interacted with CuCo2O4 through Co–N or Cu–N coordination.38

3.3 CO2 adsorption capability, optical and electronic properties
It is generally considered that the adsorption of CO2 onto the surface of the catalyst is the initial step of photocatalytic CO2 conversion and is crucial for determining the photocatalytic CO2 conversion performance. To explore the CO2 adsorption capability of the obtained photocatalyst, the CO2 adsorption isotherms of CTF-1 and CuCo2O4/CTF-15 were obtained (Fig. 4a). Under the conditions of 1 atm and 273 K, the maximum CO2 uptake amounts of the CuCo2O4/CTF-15 composite reached 10.21 m3 g−1, which was substantially higher than those of pure CTF-1 (5.86 m3 g−1) and CuCo2O4 (2.75 m3 g−1). The superior CO2 adsorption ability of CuCo2O4/CTF-15 can be ascribed to a combined effect of the CTF-1 porous structure and a Lewis acid–base interaction between absorbed CO2 molecules and Cu or Co sites.39 The enhanced CO2 uptake capability of CuCo2O4/CTF-15 was favorable for increasing the CO2 concentration on its surface, which likely played a contributive role in the improvement of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.
 Fig. 4  (a) CO2 adsorption curves of CTF-1, CuCo2O4 and CuCo2O4/CTF-15. (b) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the pure CTF-1 and CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites. (c) Transient photocurrent responses and (d) electrochemical impedance spectra of the CTF-1 and CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites. 
The optical absorption properties and the separation and mobility efficiency of photoinduced charges are two additional principal factors in photocatalytic performance. The UV-vis DRS spectra of the as-prepared catalysts were investigated, as shown in Fig. 4b. The fundamental absorption edge of CTF-1 was around 420 nm, and that of CuCo2O4 varied in the range between 350 and 800 nm. It was interesting to find that the photoabsorption performance of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composite appeared to be stronger than that of CTF-1 in the visible light region, which is regarded to be beneficial for efficient utilization of solar energy. Moreover, the corresponding band gap energies of CTF-1 (2.94 eV) and CuCo2O4 (1.51 eV) were calculated based on Tauc's formula (Fig. S5†), and the results were consistent with previously reported values.13,21
To investigate the separation and mobility of photoinduced charge, the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were examined. The photocurrent response was conducted over the samples deposited on FTO electrode under periodic on/off switching of visible light irradiation. Rapid and stable photocurrent responses of the as-obtained catalysts were observed, as shown in Fig. 4c. Notably, the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites showed better photocurrent responses than pristine CTF-1. The enhanced photocurrent implied that more effective charge transfer and separation were achieved after constructing the direct Z-scheme heterojunction. Although the pure CuCo2O4 presented higher photocurrent response and conductivity, the pure CuCo2O4 had substantially low CO2 adsorption ability (as shown in Fig. 4a), thus limiting its photocatalytic CO2 conversion efficiency. In addition, it is important to note that equal amounts of the as-synthesized photocatalysts were used for the photocurrent and conductivity measurements, whereas only x wt% (x = 1, 5, 10, 30) were loaded on CTF-1. CuCo2O4 possesses good electronic conductivity;26 therefore, it is not surprising that the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites exhibited lower photocurrent and conductivity than the pure CuCo2O4. Additionally, the EIS arc radius of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites was much smaller than that of CTF-1 (Fig. 4d), implying that the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites have less electronic resistance than pure CTF-1. It is very likely that an intimate interface formed between CuCo2O4 and CTF-1 after the construction of the direct Z-scheme heterojunction in the composites and thereby resulted in lower resistance for the charge transfer. PL analysis of the CTF-1 and CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites was also carried out (Fig. S6†). The PL spectra of the CTF-1 and CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites exhibited emission peaks centered at about 395 nm. Generally, a weaker intensity of a PL emission peak implies a higher separation probability of the photogenerated charge carriers and, therefore, a lower recombination rate of the charge carriers. Compared to pristine CTF-1, an appreciable decrease in the PL emission intensities for the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites was observed with increased loading of CuCo2O4 from 1 wt% to 5 wt%, which is indicative of the stronger electron transfer from CuCo2O4 to CTF-1 and decreased the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers between CuCo2O4 and CTF-1. However, the PL intensities of the as-prepared samples exhibited a reverse trend as the loading of CuCo2O4 increased from 10 wt% to 30 wt%, suggesting that excess CuCo2O4 can act as recombination centers and hence reduce the efficiency of charge separation.
3.4 Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic CO2 conversion performance of the as-prepared photocatalysts was evaluated in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile (MeCN) and H2O under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm), taking triethanolamine (TEOA) as a hole sacrificial agent and Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer (Fig. 5a). The photocatalytic CO2 conversion performance of the as-synthesized photocatalysts followed the order: CuCo2O4/CTF-15 > CuCo2O4/CTF-110 > CuCo2O4/CTF-11 > CuCo2O4/CTF-130 > CuCo2O4 > CTF-1. The pure CTF-1 and CuCo2O4 exhibited poor production rates of CO, which may be due to the rapid recombination rate of photoinduced charge during the photocatalytic reaction. The CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites displayed enhanced photocatalytic CO2 conversion performance, which was consistent with the photoelectrochemical results. The introduction of CuCo2O4 greatly enhanced the visible light absorption, increased the CO2 uptake capacity and promoted the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers; thus, the performance of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites was improved. The CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composite with 5 wt% loaded CuCo2O4 obtained a maximum CO production rate of 14.9 μmol g−1 h−1, which was about 12.7-fold and 11.6-fold higher than those of pure CTF-1 and CuCo2O4, respectively. However, the photocatalytic activity of the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites decreased with further increase of the loading content of CuCo2O4; this may be due to overloading of the CuCo2O4, which induced a shielding effect that blocked the active sites on the surface of CTF-1 and decreased the light penetration through the depth of the reaction solution.40 In addition, the CO evolution rate of the CuCo2O4/CTF-15 composite prepared by a simple physical mixture (Mix) was only 6.2 μmol g−1 h−1, which was much lower than that of CuCo2O4/CTF-15. This result further indicated that the synergy between CuCo2O4 and CTF-1 was significant to enhance the photocatalytic CO production performance.

In addition, several control experiments were conducted to investigate the photocatalytic CO production process. As illustrated in Fig. 5b, a negligible amount of CO was produced if the CO2 conversion reaction was performed without photocatalysts or visible light (in the dark), demonstrating the photocatalytic nature of CO2 conversion by CuCo2O4/CTF-15. Control experiments without Ru(bpy)32+ or TEOA showed trace CO generation, suggesting that the electrons for photocatalytic CO2 conversion mainly arise from photoelectrons generated by the photosensitizer (Ru(bpy)32+) under photoexcitation and TEOA taking holes as sacrificial agents in the reactions. Additionally, the CO evolution of CuCo2O4/CTF-15 was affected by the amounts of Ru(bpy)32+ and was optimized to be 7 mg, as shown in Fig. S7.† The CuCo2O4/CTF-15 only exhibited moderate activity without MeCN because MeCN possesses a nitrogen atom, which can be favorable to solubilize CO2via Lewis acid–base interactions.41 Additionally, when using highly pure N2 to replace CO2, CO evolution products cannot be detected, indicating that the production of CO indeed originated from CO2 photoreduction. The isotropic experiments were carried out in the GC-MS to further probe the C origin of CO, and the inlet CO2 was replaced by 13CO2 (Fig. 5c). The main product detected at m/z = 29 was attributed to 13CO, and this result further indicated that the generated CO originated from CO2 gas.
In order to evaluate the photocatalytic stability of CuCo2O4/CTF-15, three successive photocatalytic CO2 reduction cycles were carried out. As resulted in Fig. 5d, CuCo2O4/CTF-15 maintained its notable activity, and no distinct deactivation for CO evolution was observed during three cycles under identical experimental conditions. This indicated a stable performance of CuCo2O4/CTF-15 during the photocatalytic conversion reaction. Additionally, UV-vis DRS and FTIR measurements of the used CuCo2O4/CTF-15 were conducted (Fig. S8†), no obvious change was observed, which further demonstrated that the CuCo2O4/CTF-15 structure was not destroyed during photoreduction cycling. The slight peak of Ru(bpy)32+ in the spectra may be due to adsorption of some Ru(bpy)32+ on the used CuCo2O4/CTF-15 during the reaction.42 In addition, the photocatalytic CO evolution of CuCo2O4/CTF-15 with prolonged reaction time was investigated (Fig. S9†). The results revealed that the CO evolution rate remained steady and high in the initial 8 h and slightly dropped to about 10.18 μmol g−1 h−1 from 8 h to 12 h. These results demonstrate that the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites were stable and recyclable.
3.5 Mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 reduction
To explore the photocatalytic CO2 reduction mechanism over CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites, the electronic structures of pure CuCo2O4 and CTF-1 were investigated by Mott–Schottky measurements (Fig. S10†). The negative slope of CuCo2O4 and the positive slope of CTF-1 in the Mott–Schottky curve indicated that CuCo2O4 is a p-type semiconductor and CTF-1 is an n-type semiconductor. The derived flat-band potentials of CTF-1 and CuCo2O4 were ca. −1.23 V and 0.52 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively, which are equivalent to −1.03 V and 0.72 V (vs. NHE). According to their band gap values, the VB positions of CTF-1 and CuCo2O4 can be determined as 1.91 V and 2.23 V, respectively.
Based on the above results and analysis, a probable mechanism for photoreduction of CO2 to CO over the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 heterojunction photocatalyst was proposed, as shown in Scheme 2. Under visible light irradiation, CuCo2O4 and CTF-1 were both excited to generate electrons and holes. If the charge transfer mechanism follows the typical type-II heterojunction mode (Scheme 2a), the accumulated electrons in the CB of CuCo2O4 cannot realize the reduction of CO2 to CO due to the fact that the CB potential of CuCo2O4 (0.72 V vs. NHE) is more positive than the standard reduction potential of CO2/CO (−0.52 V vs. NHE); thereby, no CO will be thermodynamically generated. Considering the enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, the direct Z-scheme charge transfer mode is more plausible to explain the obtained results (Scheme 2b). Upon visible light irradiation, the photosensitizer (Ru(bpy)32+) was photoexcited to the excited state. Then, the excited state was quenched by the sacrificial agent (TEOA) to form a reduced photosensitizer. The reduced photosensitizer transferred the electrons to the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composite.43,44 The photogenerated holes were inclined to stay in the VB of CuCo2O4, whereas the electrons in the CB of CuCo2O4 were transferred to the VB of CTF-1 and partially combined with the photoexcited holes, then further excited to the CB of CTF-1. In consequence, the photogenerated electrons accumulated in the CB of CTF-1 with stronger reducibility and the photoinduced holes remained in the VB of the reaction. To further verify the direct Z-scheme heterojunction mechanism, electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis was performed to detect ˙O2− radicals using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping reagent, as shown in Fig. S11.† Strong DMPO-˙O2− characteristic peaks can be clearly observed for CuCo2O4/CTF-15 under visible light irradiation, which are much higher than those of pure CTF-1, whereas no signal can be observed for pure CuCo2O4. This phenomenon was in accordance with the CB position of CuCO2O4 (0.72 V vs. NHE), which was not negative enough to produce ˙O2− (O2/˙O2−, −0.33 V vs. NHE). Therefore, we can rule out the possibility of a type-II heterojunction, and the Z-scheme photocatalytic CO2 reduction mechanism can be confirmed for the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites. For the CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composites, the direct Z-scheme charge transfer mode efficiently enhanced electron–hole spatial CuCo2O4 with stronger oxidizability, thus realizing the spatial separation and transfer of electron–hole pairs and maximization of the redox activity for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction separation and optimized redox potential; thus, the photocatalytic performance was improved.

4. Conclusions
We successfully synthesized direct Z-scheme CuCo2O4/CTF-1 heterojunction photocatalysts for conversion of CO2 to CO. By optimizing the reaction conditions, the as-synthesized CuCo2O4/CTF-1 composite with 5 wt% loaded CuCo2O4 displayed the optimal CO production rate (14.9 μmol g−1 h−1), which was 12.7-fold and 11.6-fold higher than that of pure CTF-1 and CuCo2O4, respectively. The improved photocatalytic CO production performance can be ascribed to the increased visible light absorption, enhanced CO2 adsorption capability, effective spatial separation and transfer of photoinduced electron–hole pairs as well as the optimized redox ability due to the construction of the direct Z-scheme CuCo2O4/CTF-1 heterostructure. This work provides an option for application in CTFs, shedding light on the great potential of the application of CTFs in the field of carbon fuel production by CO2 conversion using solar energy.
