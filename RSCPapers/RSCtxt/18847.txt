    , Accepted 2nd November 2015First published on 2nd November 2015AbstractPorous n-type Fe2V4O13 films on FTO substrates were prepared by a simplified successive ion layer adsorption and reaction method and characterized as photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. Synthesis parameters such as film thickness and annealing temperatures and durations were investigated to optimize the PEC performance. A band gap of ∼2.3 eV and a flat band potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE make Fe2V4O13 a promising photoanode material. Water oxidation was kinetically limited at the surface of Fe2V4O13 film as confirmed by tests in electrolyte with a hole scavenger (Na2SO3). Improved PEC performance was achieved by Mo and W doping because of enhanced carrier densities. The best performance was obtained by 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 films (actual 0.8% W-doped), which efficiently oxidize water to O2via photogenerated holes as confirmed by oxygen evolution measurements. Moreover, the Fe2V4O13 photoanode displayed very stable photocurrent under illumination. Due to the suitable band gap and valence band position, Fe2V4O13 is a promising photoanode for solar water splitting. Co-catalyst loading and doping optimization are identified as routes to improve this material's performance further.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for hydrogen production is a promising green and economically viable approach for solar energy conversion.1 Since the first report of PEC water splitting with TiO2 in 1972,2 considerable effort has been invested in the development of efficient light-absorbing photoelectrodes.3 However, solar PEC water splitting is extremely challenging because light absorbers need to meet some stringent requirements: sufficiently narrow band gap for harvesting visible light, properly aligned band edges and chemical and electrochemical stability.4 Many metal oxides that meet some of these requirements have been widely studied, e.g., Fe2O3,5 WO3,6 BiVO4 (ref. 7) and CuWO4.8 It is still highly desirable to develop new metal oxides with suitable band gaps and band edge energies.9–12 Recently, metal vanadates have been explored, for example, NiV2O6,9 Cu3V2O8,10 Cu3−xVO4 (ref. 11) and Mn2V2O7.12 Studies have illustrated that all of them have potential as highly efficient light absorbers for PEC water splitting.
Monoclinic Fe2V4O13 has been investigated for visible-light photoreduction of CO2 (ref. 13) and degradation of organic pollutants.14 Based on these studies, Fe2V4O13 has a band gap of around 1.8 eV, and the valence band edge is located at 1.69 eV vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) which is 0.46 eV below the potential for water oxidation (1.23 eV vs. RHE). In this case, Fe2V4O13 should be a very promising photoelectrode for PEC water splitting. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no report regarding the use of Fe2V4O13 as a photoelectrode in a PEC cell thus far. Moreover, the elemental abundance of Fe and V in the earth's crust would make Fe2V4O13 a very low-cost material. Thus, these motivate us to evaluate this Fe2V4O13 as potential photoanode.
Recent studies have indicated that incorporating Mo or/and W into metal vanadates (e.g., BiVO4, Cu3V2O8 and FeVO4) can significantly improve their PEC performance.10,15–18 The substitutions of Mo6+ and/or W6+ ions into V5+ sites act as a shallow level electron donor, improving the n-type conductivity.19 Moreover, the enhanced separation of electron–hole pairs is revealed by first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations.16 Additionally, Seabold and Neale found the electron diffusion length can be increased by 4-fold via Mo doping compared with undoped Cu3V2O8.10 Therefore, doping of W6+ or/and Mo6+ into the V5+ sites seems to be a promising general approach to improve the bulk charge transport in metal vanadates, and thus improve the PEC performance.
Herein, we report the photoelectrochemical performance of Fe2V4O13 for the first time. To achieve direct growth of Fe2V4O13 on conductive substrate, a simplified successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (s-SILAR) approach was developed. The doping of Mo and W into Fe2V4O13 films was also realized via this method. The photoactivity of Fe2V4O13 was found to be limited by charge transport in the bulk and can be improved by doping with Mo and W.
2. Experimental methods
2.1 Materials
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%), NH4VO3 (Acros Organics, 99.5%), (NH4)6Mo7O24·9H2O (Alfa Aesar, 81–83% as MoO3), (NH4)10W12O41·5H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%), Na2B4O7·10H2O, H3BO3, K2HPO4, KH2PO4, Na2SO3 (Fisher chemical, all 99+%) and KOH (Fisher Chemical, 87.8%) were purchased and used without further purification. Substrates were fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) coated glass (Pilkington) and were cleaned by sonication in diluted Contrex detergent and ethanol for 30 minutes, respectively.
2.2 Synthesis
In this study, a simplified successive ion layer adsorption and reaction method (s-SILAR) was developed to prepare Fe2V4O13 films, as shown in Fig. 1. Compared with the conventional SILAR, there are no rinse processes following each immersion. In a typical synthesis, 25 mM Fe(NO3)3 and 50 mM NH4VO3 solutions were first prepared in de-ionized water at room temperature (25 °C) and 75 °C, respectively. A clean FTO substrate was successively immersed into two different solutions for 20 seconds each: first in Fe(NO3)3 solution and then in NH4VO3 solution. This immersion cycle was repeated until a certain thickness (controlled by the number of cycles) was achieved. The film was rinsed with de-mineralized water and dried in air. Then the as-prepared film was annealed in air at 400 or 500 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1, and allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The duration of annealing varied between one and twelve hours. Finally, a yellow film was obtained on the FTO substrate.

Referring to our previous work on BiVO4,17 5% Mo-doped, 2.5% W-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films were also prepared. The corresponding amount of (NH4)6Mo7O24·9H2O, (NH4)10W12O41·5H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·9H2O and (NH4)10W12O41·5H2O were added into the NH4VO3 solutions respectively, and the remaining processes were the same as for the undoped Fe2V4O13 film. In this paper, the 5% Mo-doped, 2.5% W-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films are referred to by their nominal doping levels, regardless of the values of the actual doping concentrations (see XPS results below).
2.3 Material characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken with a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu-Kα radiation. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired using a Quanta 650 FEG scanning electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired with a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer using a monochromated Al Kα source. UV-vis transmission measurements were measured with a Cary 500 spectrophotometer attached to an integrating sphere (Labsphere DRA-CA-5500). For Tauc plots the absorption coefficient (α) was determined by: α = −ln(10−absorbance)/d(1)where d is the film thickness.
2.4 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted using a three-electrode electrochemical cell with the Fe2V4O13 film as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode. The working electrode was sealed against an O-ring with an exposed area of approximately 0.22 cm2 for both front and back illumination measurements. Unless explicitly noted, all the PEC characterizations were conducted using front illumination in this study. A CH Instruments 660D electrochemical workstation was employed for the electrochemical measurements. The measured potential vs. the Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) reference electrode was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.0591 × pH + E°Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl)(2)where E°Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) = 0.236 V at 25 °C.20
A Newport 150 W solar simulator (Newport, Model 9600) with an air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) filter was used as the illumination source. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a thermopile detector. A monochromator (Photon Technology International), silicon photodetector (model 818-UV, Newport) and optical power meter (model 1830-C, Newport) were used to determine the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE). IPCE values were calculated using the formula: IPCE = 1240 × j(λ)/λ × P(λ)(3)where j(λ) is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength (mA cm−2), λ is the wavelength of incident light (nm) and P(λ) is the measured light power density at that wavelength (mW cm−2).
Mott–Schottky measurements were conducted using a CH Instruments 660D and the built in software was used to measure capacitance vs. applied potential at a fixed frequency. Mott–Schottky plots were created and fit to ideal semiconductor behavior: 1/C2 = (2/eεε0Nd)[Va − Vfb − kT/e](4)where C is the space charge layer capacitance, ε is the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, e is the elemental charge, Nd is the concentration of charge carriers, Va is the applied potential, Vfb is the flat band potential, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.
2.5 Oxygen evolution detection
Detection of oxygen evolution was performed in a three-electrode cell with an airtight design coupled with an oxygen sensor (Fox, Ocean Optics, type R) in 40 mL of 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9.2). A detailed experimental setup can be found in a previous paper.9 The leak rate of oxygen into the cell (∼4 nmol per L per second) was first determined and was taken into account to calculate the actual generated oxygen. The charge passed (recorded by a CH Instruments 660D) was converted to a theoretical amount of O2 produced assuming 100% faradaic efficiency for O2 evolution reaction. An illumination intensity of ∼300 mW cm−2 with AM1.5G filter and a bias of 1.60 V vs. RHE were used to ensure a better signal-to-noise ratio.
3. Results and discussion
The preparation of Fe2V4O13 powders via a wet chemical precipitation process has been reported by Zhang et al.14 In their study, Fe2V4O13 particles were obtained by quickly mixing Fe(NO3)3 and NH4VO3 solutions followed by a post-annealing treatment. Their work demonstrated that iron ion could react with vanadate ion to form the precursor of Fe2V4O13. On the other hand, for photoelectrodes used in PEC cells, it is better to realize the direct growth of materials on conductive substrates, which is advantageous for charge transfer. As shown in Fig. S1 (see ESI†), a uniform yellow as-prepared Fe2V4O13 film on FTO substrate is obtained after 20 cycles deposition via s-SILAR. Elemental mapping of the as-prepared film reveals a uniform distribution of Fe and V in the film (see ESI, Fig. S2†). Moreover, the ratio of Fe and V was approximately 1:2 as measured by EDS, close to the expected stoichiometry of Fe2V4O13 (see ESI, Fig. S2†).
The as-prepared Fe2V4O13 films were amorphous by XRD. Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of a Fe2V4O13 film annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. Three intense diffraction peaks are distinctly observed at the 2θ angles of 12.5, 22.7 and 26.7°, respectively. The diffraction peaks are well matched with the monoclinic phase of Fe2V4O13 (JCPDS no. 00-039-0893).13

The morphologies of as-prepared and annealed Fe2V4O13 films are shown in Fig. 3. The as-prepared Fe2V4O13 film consists of small, well-distributed particles. During annealing, well defined particles with a diameter of about 100 nm form and are sintered together. Also, some large (∼500 nm) particles co-exist in the film. Interestingly, the Fe2V4O13 film becomes more porous after annealing, which may be due to the increase of particle size and/or the evaporation of H2O existing in the as-prepared film.21

The absorbance spectrum illustrates that the absorption edge of the Fe2V4O13 film extends to the visible-light region (around 550 nm), which suggests the possibility of photoactivity of this material under visible-light illumination (Fig. 4(a)). The onset absorption wavelength is reasonable judging from the visually observed yellow color of the annealed Fe2V4O13 film (see ESI, Fig. S1†). The absorption coefficient calculated by eqn (1) is shown in Fig. S3 (see ESI†). The values decrease with increasing wavelengths, starting from about 5 × 105 to 1 × 105 cm−1 in the spectral range from 300 to 550 nm. From an inversion of α, the light incident lengths are calculated to be ca. 200–1000 nm. Additionally, Tauc plot analyses for allowed direct and indirect band gaps are shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), respectively. The estimated optical band gaps of Fe2V4O13 films are ∼2.35 eV (direct) and ∼2.25 eV (indirect), which are larger than the previously reported value of 1.8 eV.13

Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out to estimate the flat band potential of Fe2V4O13. Linear regressions of the 1/C2vs. Va relationship at different frequencies (1, 3 and 5 kHz) give an estimated flat band potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5(a)). And the positive slopes of regression lines in Fig. 5(a) are indicative of the n-type character of the Fe2V4O13 film. Additionally, in order to check the accuracy of the above measured flat band potential, a chopped linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of Fe2V4O13 film in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution with 0.1 M Na2SO3 was conducted (as shown in Fig. 5(b)). Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger was added to minimize the overpotential for hole transfer.22 The onset potential obtained from Fig. 5(b) is also around 0.5 V vs. RHE, consistent with the value determined from the Mott–Schottky measurements. Therefore, based on the measured band gap and flat band potential, a schematic band diagram of the Fe2V4O13 photoanode for water oxidation is depicted in Fig. 5(c). With the valence band lying well below the O2/H2O potential (1.23 V vs. RHE), the photogenerated holes can thermodynamically perform water oxidation.

According to the above experiments, Fe2V4O13 exhibits suitable properties for use as a photoanode in a PEC cell. Next, we optimized the synthesis conditions and properties of our Fe2V4O13 films with respect to PEC performance. Chiefly, the effects of the annealing temperature and duration and the thickness of film on the PEC performance were investigated. Fig. 6(a) displays the chopped LSVs of Fe2V4O13 films annealed at different temperatures and durations in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9.2). The monoclinic Fe2V4O13 phase forms under all the annealing conditions (see ESI, Fig. S4†). However, it is noticeable that the XRD peaks for Fe2V4O13 film annealed at 400 °C for 12 h are not well resolved, indicative of low crystallinity. It can be seen from Fig. 6(a) that the Fe2V4O13 film annealed at 500 °C for 1 h shows the highest photocurrent at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The background current of the Fe2V4O13 film annealed at 400 °C for 12 h is larger which may result from the low crystallinity. In addition, different thicknesses of Fe2V4O13 films are prepared by varying the number of cycles. Fig. 6(b) and S5 (see ESI†) show the chopped LSVs of Fe2V4O13 films with different thicknesses annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9.2). At the potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE, the highest photocurrent is achieved for a Fe2V4O13 film obtained via 20 deposition cycles. Therefore, 20 cycles and 500 °C for 1 h were chosen as the optimal synthesis conditions for the experiments that follow. It should be pointed out that the actual thickness of the Fe2V4O13 film obtained by 20 cycles is difficult to quantify because of the porous nature of the film (see Fig. 3). This can be also verified by the cross-sectional SEM image (see ESI, Fig. S6†). However, the average thickness of the Fe2V4O13 film is around 500 nm as shown in Fig. S6.†
 Fig. 6  (a) Chopped LSVs of Fe2V4O13 films annealed at different temperatures and durations in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9.2); (b) chopped LSVs of Fe2V4O13 films with different thicknesses annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9.2). 
Furthermore, the influence of electrolyte and illumination direction has also been studied. Fig. S7(a) (see ESI†) illustrates the chopped LSVs of Fe2V4O13 films in three electrolytes: 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9.2), 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) and 1 M KOH solution (pH 13.6). The photocurrents obtained in pH 9.2 and pH 7 buffer solutions are almost the same while the photocurrent is very small in the pH 13.6 solution. The Fe2V4O13 film was dissolved after electrochemical testing in this highly basic electrolyte. The effect of illumination direction: through the solution (front illumination) or through the FTO-glass substrate (back illumination) is shown in the Fig. S7(b) (see ESI†). The photocurrent with front illumination is larger than that with back illumination, a similar observation as with mesoporous α-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes and may be due to a larger interfacial area at the top of the film.23,24
Even after optimizing the synthesis conditions, a relatively low photocurrent density of ∼16 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE was obtained, much lower than the theoretical maximum photocurrent for a material with a 2.3 eV band gap. This discrepancy is either due to sluggish water oxidation kinetics at the surface and/or poor charge transport through the bulk of the film.10,25 A hole scavenger (Na2SO3) was used in order to test the former hypothesis. The photocurrent increases to ∼28 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE with 0.1 M Na2SO3 in the buffer solution (Fig. 7(a)). This improvement suggests that water oxidation is indeed somewhat kinetically limited at the surface of the Fe2V4O13 film, which is commonly observed for other metal oxide photoanodes.10 The poor water oxidation kinetics can be further evidenced by small transient spikes (photocurrent decay) immediately after illumination (see ESI, Fig. S8†), indicative of charge trapping and recombination at the electrode surface.26 However, the photocurrent improvement is not pronounced upon adding a hole scavenger, suggesting charge transport to be the bottleneck to higher photocurrents.
 Fig. 7  (a) Chopped LSVs of Fe2V4O13 films in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution with/without 0.1 M Na2SO3; (b) chopped LSVs of undoped, 2.5% W-doped, 5% Mo-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9.2); (c) amperometric i–t curves of undoped, 2.5% W-doped, 5% Mo-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9.2) without a hole scavenger (Na2SO3) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. 
Further photocurrent improvement was achieved by incorporating Mo and W into the Fe2V4O13 films. The introduction of Mo6+ or/and W6+ ions into V5+ sites can increase the charge carrier concentration (see ESI, Fig. S9†), which is beneficial for improving the PEC performance of Fe2V4O13 photoanodes. In this study, we prepared three different doped Fe2V4O13 films: 5% Mo-doped, 2.5% W-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films, and the chopped LSV curves for such films are shown in Fig. 7(b). In comparison with undoped Fe2V4O13 films, all the doped films exhibit improved photocurrents. For a 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 film, the improvement is most remarkable at 1.23 V vs. RHE, from ∼16 μA cm−2 to ∼29 μA cm−2. In addition, the larger photocurrent improvements for all doped Fe2V4O13 films are observed at higher applied potentials because of the increased band bending driving minority carriers to the reaction site at the film–electrolyte interface.17 It also can be noted from Fig. 7(b) that the photocurrents of 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 film exceed those of 2.5% W-doped film for potentials greater than 1.4 V vs. RHE. This phenomenon can be explained by the higher carrier density of Mo, W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films compared with only W doping, which has also been observed in the case of Mo/W-doped BiVO4.16 The amperometric i–t curves at 1.23 V vs. RHE shown in Fig. 7(c) illustrate that all the doped Fe2V4O13 films display significantly larger transient spikes in the photocurrent traces immediately at the beginning and end of each chop than that of undoped Fe2V4O13 film. Due to the sluggish water oxidation kinetics a large fraction of carriers photogenerated in doped Fe2V4O13 films are consumed by recombination rather than water oxidation, indicating the importance of co-catalysts for this material.27 What is more, the chopped LSVs of 5% Mo-doped, 2.5% W-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution with 0.1 M Na2SO3 are shown in Fig. S10 (see ESI†). The photocurrents can be further increased by using a hole scavenger.
UV-visible absorption spectra of undoped, 5% Mo-doped, 2.5% W-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films are illustrated in Fig. S11 (see ESI†). The absorption spectra do not show significant differences, suggesting a negligible change in the band gap. Thus, it can be concluded that the enhanced photocurrent does not originate from any difference in optical properties, but rather from an enhanced carrier density.16 Additionally, the SEM images of the doped Fe2V4O13 films are shown in Fig. S12 (see ESI†). All films exhibit a porous morphology, just like undoped Fe2V4O13 films. However, it seems that the particle size of 2.5% W-doped films is smaller and more uniform than those of 5% Mo-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped films, but still around 100 nm. Some studies reported the similar results for W-doping reducing the particle size of TiO2 while Mo-doping increased the particle size of TiO2.28,29 Moreover, W. J. Luo et al. also observed that the morphologies of Mo and W doped BiVO4 films displayed little difference.30 Given the small hole diffusion length in Fe2V4O13, it is reasonable to expect that small particle size can contribute to slightly better photoelectrochemical performance for 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 films at low applied potentials.31
In addition, carrier recombination (transient spikes) are observed even at a potential of 1.40 V vs. RHE in 5% Mo-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films, while no transient spikes appear in the 2.5% W-doped film (see ESI, Fig. S13†). Studies of BiVO4 have proven that surface segregated impurity phases (MoOx and WOx) may exist in Mo and W doped films and can act as recombination centers for photo-generated carriers.30,32 In our studies, considering that the actual doping concentrations of W-doped Fe2V4O13 films compared to Mo-doped and Mo, W co-doped films (see below XPS discussion), this difference can probably be attributed to the existence of more surface segregated impurity phases in 5% Mo-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films, resulting in more significant carrier recombination. However, this speculation needs further investigation.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were taken to verify the concentration and oxidation states of elements in the films. The high-resolution XPS spectra of the O 1s, V 2p, Fe 2p, Mo 3d and W 4f binding energy regions for a representative 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 sample are shown in Fig. 8. The calibration of the binding energy scale is made with respect to the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV. The binding energies of the V 2p peaks at 516.8 and 524.4 eV and the binding energy of the O 1s peak at 530.0 eV (Fig. 8(a)) correspond to oxidation states of V5+ and O2−.13 In the Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 8(b)), the binding energies of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 are 711.3 eV and 725.5 eV, respectively. A satellite peak for Fe 2p3/2 is observed at 719.6 eV. The presence of this satellite peak and the binding energies of Fe 2p are consistent with results obtained by other researchers, and is clear evidence for the existence of Fe3+.13,33 The Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 peaks are located at 235.5 and 232.4 eV (Fig. 8(c)), and the W 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks are observed at 37.3 and 35.1 eV (Fig. 8(d)), confirming the presence of Mo6+ and W6+ species in doped Fe2V4O13.34 Using the XPS spectra, the actual doping concentrations of W and Mo in various doped Fe2V4O13 films were quantified and are summarized in Table 1. It can be noted that the actual doping concentrations for all the doped Fe2V4O13 films are about half of the intended doping concentrations.

The relationship between the photoelectrochemical activity and the wavelength of the incident light was investigated by incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). A typical IPCE power density spectrum is supplied in Fig. S14 (see ESI†). Fig. 9 shows the IPCE spectra of the films in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution at 1.40 V vs. RHE and in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution with 0.1 M Na2SO3 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. For all the Fe2V4O13 films, the onset wavelengths of IPCE curves are around 550 nm, which is in agreement with their UV-visible absorbance spectra. Again, it is confirmed that the enhanced photoactivity of doped Fe2V4O13 films compared with undoped Fe2V4O13 film is not due to a decrease in the band gap. IPCE measurements at 1.40 V vs. RHE show 2.5% W-doped and 6% Mo, 2% W co-doped Fe2V4O13 films have comparable photoactivity and both of them are better than the 5% Mo-doped Fe2V4O13 film. This is consistent with the LSV tests shown in Fig. 7(b). In summary, all the doped Fe2V4O13 films exhibit enhanced IPCE in comparison to the undoped Fe2V4O13 film, and 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 film presents the highest IPCE values over the entire absorption region.

Fig. 10 shows the O2 detected by the oxygen sensor and the theoretical amount of O2 inferred from the charge passed assuming 100% faradaic efficiency for O2 production. The amount of actual O2 detected correlates very well with the theoretically predicted amount of O2 within the first 400 seconds of testing, indicating the faradaic efficiency is near 100%. However, then it deviates from the theoretical value, which is caused by the formation of O2 bubbles on the surface of the photoelectrode and the release of dissolved O2 from the electrolyte into the space above the liquid such that the O2 detector cannot detect it.10 After testing, O2 bubbles can be observed on the photoelectrode as shown in the insert image of Fig. 10. Therefore, it can be concluded that Fe2V4O13 photoanodes have the applicability for water oxidation.

Inset is the digital image of the 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 photoelectrode after testing. 
The stability of the 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 film was investigated by chronoamperometry. As shown in Fig. 11, the photocurrents display almost no decrease during 3600 seconds of testing under illumination with and without 0.1 M Na2SO3 in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solutions. Moreover, the photocurrent is retained after the light is turned off and then back on. Therefore, Fe2V4O13 has promising stability under illumination when used as a photoanode.

Finally, the optimal W doping concentration for Fe2V4O13 photoelectrode has also been investigated. Fig. 12 illustrates the chopped LSVs of various W-doped Fe2V4O13 films in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution. Among the three different doping concentrations studied, the 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 film shows the best performance.

4. Conclusions
We present the first study of Fe2V4O13 used as a photoanode for PEC water oxidation. A facile simplified successive ion layer adsorption and reaction approach was developed to synthesize porous undoped and Mo/W-doped Fe2V4O13 films directly on FTO substrates. The effects of synthesis parameters including film thickness and annealing conditions on the PEC performance were investigated. Fe2V4O13 exhibited a band gap of about 2.3 eV and a suitable valence band edge for water oxidation. Sluggish water oxidation kinetics at the surface of Fe2V4O13 was observed, indicating the importance of co-catalysts for this material. The PEC performance were improved by Mo and W doping, resulting from higher carrier density and hence conductivity of the bulk film. In this study, 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 films (actual 0.8% W-doped) showed the best performance and the photogenerated holes in this film can be efficiently utilized to oxidize water to O2. Additionally, the Fe2V4O13 photoelectrode showed promising stability under long-term illumination. In conclusion, Fe2V4O13 is an intriguing photoanode candidate for PEC water splitting.
