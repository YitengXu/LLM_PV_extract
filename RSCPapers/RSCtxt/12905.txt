    , Accepted 13th January 2022First published on 13th January 2022AbstractThe electrochemical nitrite (NO2−) reduction reaction (NO2RR) is not only a promising strategy to degrade the harmful NO2− contaminant in the environment but an attractive alternative to the Haber–Bosch process for sustainable ammonia (NH3) production. It is however hindered by low NO2−-to-NH3 conversion efficiencies and needs superb catalysts to drive the direct six-electron NO2RR. Here, we report on developing cobalt nanoparticle decorated biomass Juncus derived carbon as a highly active NO2RR catalyst with high durability for NH3 electrosynthesis. This catalyst shows an NH3 yield of 2.8 ± 0.1 mol h−1 gCo−1 and a high faradaic efficiency of 96.9 ± 2.1% in alkaline media. The catalytic mechanism is further revealed by density functional theory calculations.
Nitrite (NO2−) as an important intermediate species in the global nitrogen cycle as well as one of the most dangerous and harmful contaminants exists widely in water and soil.1–3 Noticeably, NO2− causes significant adverse health effects in humans and animals, in that its nitrosation produces highly carcinogenic N-nitrosamines.4–6 Besides, NO2− and its derivatives cause other health problems such as spontaneous abortion, infant methemoglobinemia, and hypertension.7,8 In addition, elevated NO2− concentrations are a serious water quality concern.9 Therefore, the artificial denitrification of NO2− into harmless or, better yet, value-added products is of significant importance to public health and mitigation of the nitrogen cycle unbalance. The ambient electrocatalytic NO2− reduction reaction (NO2RR) is regarded as a simple and on-site route to convert NO2− pollutants into other reductive products,10–19 of which NH3 as an indispensable chemical commodity and an alternative carbon-free fuel is of key importance to many industrial processes and human life.20,21 Recently, N2-to-NH3 fixation in aqueous solution has attracted wide research attention, but such a conversion process achieves rather low NH3 yield and faradaic efficiency (FE) due to the chemical inertness and low solubility of N2.22–31 In contrast, NH3 electrosynthesis by the NO2RR offers much higher NH3 yields and FEs, in that NO2− can be reduced more easily thermodynamically and has higher solubility in aqueous solution compared to N2.32,33 The NO2RR thus holds great promise for achieving high-efficiency electrochemical NH3 production, but still requires advanced electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity.
Noble metals are active for selective NO2− reduction to NH3 (ref. 34 and 35) but suffer from the scarcity and high cost. Researchers have thus focused on earth-abundant NO2RR electrocatalysts.16–19 Co has emerged as an interesting transition metal due to its power to catalyse NO2−-to-NH3 conversion.11 Recent studies show that cobalt macrocyclic complexes can selectively drive the six-electron NO2RR process with high activity.11,12 However, homogeneous catalysts typically exhibit limited reduction current densities (<100 mA cm−2)36–38 and suffer from separation difficulties.39 In this regard, the design of efficient and robust Co-based heterogeneous catalysts is highly needed for kinetically fast NO2RR electrocatalysis.
Herein, we describe our recent effort in constructing cobalt nanoparticle decorated biomass Juncus derived carbon (Co@JDC) as a highly efficient catalyst for direct electrosynthesis of NH3 in alkaline media. Juncus derived carbon not only allows a high mass loading of more dispersed cobalt nanoparticles with a smaller size but also enhances the stability of these Co nanoparticles and overall conductivity. When tested in 0.1 M NaOH with 0.1 M NO2−, Co@JDC shows exceptional NO2RR performances with a fairly high FE of 96.9 ± 2.1% and an NH3 yield of up to 2.8 ± 0.1 mol h−1 gCo−1. Additionally, excellent electrocatalytic performance for selective reduction of nitrate (NO3−) to NH3 is also achieved on our Co@JDC. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal mechanisms for the reduction of NO2− to NH3 on three catalyst models of Co(111), Co(200), and Co(220) planes. The lower D-band center of Co atoms can lower adsorption energies of the intermediates, thus giving rise to high catalytic activity and selectivity of the NO2RR.
Co@JDC was prepared by a facile calcination strategy (see ESI† for preparative details). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Co@JDC (Fig. 1a) shows diffraction peaks at 44.1°, 51.4°, and 75.6° indexed to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal facets of Co (JCPDS no. 01-071-4651), respectively. Another broad diffraction hump at ∼26° is assigned to the graphitic carbon.40 The average grain size for Co crystallites is calculated to be 42.21 nm. The XRD pattern for pure JDC is given in Fig. S1.† Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of such JDC (Fig. S2a†) show that its networks consist of tubular fibers with a diameter of about 5 μm. SEM images of Co@JDC (Fig. 1b and c) reveal that the relatively smooth surface (some wrinkles are observed) of the JDC (Fig. S2b†) is decorated homogenously and densely with small nanoparticles, and the unique 3D structure of the JDC is well retained. The as-fabricated Co@JDC with a conductive 3D hollow tubular network not only favors electron transport but electrolyte penetration. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results of Co@JDC (Fig. 1d) show that the Co signal area is almost the same as that of C and exhibits uniform signals, suggesting the high mass loading of Co nanoparticles. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) results show that the content of Co is as high as 82.4 wt%, indicating the high concentration of metals (Table S1†). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image further confirms that abundant Co nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 7.2 nm to 65 nm (average: 35.40 nm) are uniformly decorated on the carbon backbone (Fig. 1e), showing highly dispersed small Co nanoparticles. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image displays clear lattice spacings of 0.205 nm, 0.177 nm, and 0.125 nm, which are in accordance with the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Co (Fig. 1f). As displayed in Fig. S3,† Co@JDC exhibits a type-IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of a mesoporous structure. The specific surface area of Co@JDC is determined to be 302.3 m2 g−1 by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore distribution (inset of Fig. S3†) shows that the porous diameter of Co@JDC is centered at 5.70 nm.

The NO2RR catalytic activity and selectivity of Co@JDC toward NH3 production were evaluated in an Ar-saturated 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte with 0.1 M NO2−, using an H-cell with a three-electrode configuration. All potentials are converted to the RHE scale in this work (Fig. S4†). An ink was prepared from Co@JDC and evenly loaded on a graphite felt (Co@JDC/GF, 0.25 cm2) that is inactive for the NO2RR to serve as the working electrode. As displayed in Fig. 2a, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves recorded on Co@JDC/GF in 0.1 M NaOH with 0.1 M NO2− show a significantly larger geometric area-normalized current density (j, −230.5 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V) than that in 0.1 M NaOH without 0.1 M NO2− (−48.8 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V), indicating the occurrence of fast NO2− reduction. The concentrations of NH3 and N2H4 (possible by-product) were determined by the indophenol blue method and the Watt and Chrisp method (Fig. S5–S8†), respectively. H2 is monitored using gas chromatography (GC). We performed chronoamperometry measurements at a series of electrode potentials (Fig. S9a†), and the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S9b†) suggest that the maximum absorbance intensity occurs at −1.0 V. As the cathodic potential increases, the NH3 yield and FE on the Co@JDC/GF both increase and reach the highest values of 2.8 ± 0.1 mol h−1 gCo−1 and 96.9 ± 2.1% at −1.0 V (Fig. 2b), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, such high NH3 yield and FE stand out from those of basically all recently reported NO2RR electrocatalysts (Fig. 2c and Table S2†). When the potential is more negative than −1.0 V, the NH3 yield and FE of the Co@JDC catalyst decrease, which is ascribed to the intensified hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).41–43 As shown in Fig. S10a,† excellent NO2− electroreduction performance of Co@JDC was observed in neutral electrolyte (0.1 M PBS), but the j obtained in 0.1 M PBS is smaller than that obtained in 0.1 M NaOH. Moreover, the NH3 yield and FE of Co@JDC in 0.1 M PBS are 0.8 ± 0.1 mol h−1 gCo−1 and 90.6 ± 3.1% (Fig. S10b–d†), respectively, both lower than those in 0.1 M NaOH (2.8 ± 0.1 mol h−1 gCo−1 and 96.9 ± 2.1%). Additionally, no N2H4 was generated during the electrocatalytic NO2RR process in both alkaline and neutral media (Fig. S11†). The H2 FE and N2 FE are rather low at each potential (Fig. S12†) when tested in alkaline and neutral media, which again indicates the high NH3 selectivity of our Co@JDC.

(f) Polarization curve and catalytic performances including FE and accumulated NH3 of the two-electrode electrolyzer with Co@JDC/GF as both anode and cathode electrodes. 
To further evidence the long-term stability of Co@JDC, consecutive cycling tests (3 h for each cycle) were performed at the optimal potential of −1.0 V (Fig. S13a and b†). As plotted in Fig. 2d, both NH3 yield and FE for the Co@JDC/GF can be reproduced for at least five consecutive cycles without changing the electrode, and only slight fluctuation was observed in both NH3 yields and FEs. The j shows neglectable changes during 12 h electrolysis (Fig. S13c†). The near-identical XRD patterns before and after the cycling tests (Fig. S14†) indicate the stability of Co@JDC. And the morphology of Co@JDC also exhibits no obvious change after the cycling tests (Fig. S15†), again evidencing its high structural stability.
As shown in Fig. S16,† we compared the NO2RR activities of Co@JDC/GF, JDC/GF, and bare GF with their LSV results, and both JDC/GF and bare GF show smaller j, evidencing that the active species for electrocatalytic NO2− reduction is the Co nanoparticles. Further, we carried out chronoamperometry tests with GF and JDC/GF as working electrodes (Fig. S17†), respectively. And the NH3 concentrations and FEs of GF, JDC/GF, and Co@JDC/GF are compared at the same electrode potential (Fig. S18†). This suggests that Co@JDC/GF is much superior to the JDC/GF and bare GF (basically inactive for the NO2− reduction) counterparts in terms of the NH3 yield and FE, demonstrating the dramatically enhanced NO2RR activity enabled by the highly dispersed Co nanoparticles. In addition, using the Co@JDC/GF as the catalyst, only 3.4 × 10−8 mol NH3 was detected after the bulk electrolysis tests at open-circuit potential (OCP) in 0.1 M NaOH with 0.1 M NO2− (Fig. S18 and S19†). And NH3 in the catholyte after electrolysis at −1.0 V was found to be only 1.8 × 10−8 mol without adding NO2− (Fig. S18 and S20†). The experimental results here strongly verify that our electrolyzer is less contaminated, and the detected NH3 was generated via the NO2RR process catalyzed by Co@JDC/GF.
Co@JDC/GF was used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a two-electrode electrolytic reactor powered by an external photovoltaic cell (PV) to produce NH3 (Fig. 2e and S21a†). The onset potentials (Eonset) for the NO2RR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) recorded on the Co@JDC/GF are determined to be 0.056 V (1 mA cm−2) and 1.286 V (1 mA cm−2) in a three-electrode system (Fig. S21b†), respectively. Fig. S21c† shows the intersection of the current density vs. cell voltage (j–V curve) of the solar cell with the current vs. cell voltage (load curve) of the electrochemical cell. The PV-electrolyzer has an operating current of 30 mA cm−2 with a cell voltage of 1.8 V. We performed long-term bulk electrolysis tests (Fig. S21d†) using the PV-powered electrolytic reactor. Noticeably, the assembled full cell offers a small Eonset of 1.239 V (1 mA cm−2, Fig. 2f) and produces a considerable amount of NH3 of up to 0.125 × 10−3 mol after 12 h operation at a cell voltage of 1.8 V (Fig. 2f), indicating the promising potential of our Co@JDC catalyst for practical NH3 synthesis devices. After taking the baseline of the NO2− reduction activity of the Co@JDC catalyst, we constructed a voltaic Zn–NO2− battery using Co@JDC/GF as the cathode and a low-cost Zn plate as the anode to generate electricity and synthesize valuable NH3 simultaneously. As shown in Fig. S22,† 1 M NaOH and 0.1 M NaOH with 0.1 M NO2− are used as the anolyte and catholyte for our homemade Zn–NO2− batteries, respectively, which are separated by a bipolar membrane. The typical discharging polarization curve and corresponding power densities are plotted in Fig. 3a. As observed, this battery with the Co@JDC/GF cathode offers a high peak power density of 10.50 mW cm−2 at 0.37 V vs. Zn, much superior to those of the GF and JDC/GF based counterpart. Furthermore, the Zn–NO2− battery shows an increasing current density from 0 mA cm−2 to 40 mA cm−2 with more negative electrode potential and offers almost the same OCP at 0 mA cm−2 as large as the initial OCP after long-term operation (Fig. 3b), suggesting superior performances. Moreover, the OCP is determined as 1.467 V vs. Zn (Fig. 3c), lower than the theoretical OCP (1.87 V vs. Zn) for the Zn–NO2− battery. This is because the chemical stability of NO2− and the complex NO2RR pathways result in relatively large cathode polarization.44 We conducted discharge tests at different current densities (from 1 mA cm−2 to 20 mA cm−2) to investigate the NO2−-to-NH3 conversion efficiencies. The chronoamperometry curves and related UV-vis absorption spectra are provided in Fig. S23.† Encouragingly, the Zn–NO2− battery with Co@JDC/GF as the cathode is able to offer an NH3 yield rate of 0.15 mol h−1 gCo−1 at 20 mA cm−2 and an ultrahigh NH3 FE of 99% (Fig. 3d). We compared the NH3 yield and power density of our battery with those of reported metal-N2, metal-NO, and metal-NO3− batteries (Table S3†). To probe the capability of our battery to continuously produce NH3, long-term 8 h measurements at a fixed current density of 25 mA cm−2 were conducted (Fig. S24†), and both the NH3 yield and FE are rather stable during the whole testing process (Fig. 3e).
NO2− and nitrate (NO3−) exist in groundwater as a mixture, and their concentrations in aquatic environments are indicative of water quality.45–49 We thus investigated the electrochemical performances of Co@JDC/GF toward the NO3− reduction reaction (NO3RR) under identical conditions as we performed the NO2RR measurements, using NO3− as the nitrogen source. A considerably enlarged current density was obtained for Co@JDC/GF in the presence of 0.1 M NO3−, indicating that NO3− can be effectively reduced on our catalyst electrochemically (Fig. S25a†). Chronoamperometry tests were performed to determine the NH3 yields and FEs (Fig. S26†), and our Co@JDC/GF achieves a large NH3 yield rate of up to 2.1 ± 0.1 mol h−1 gCo−1 and a FE of 93.2 ± 4.8% at −1.0 V (Fig. S25b†), confirming the superior NO3−-to-NH3 conversion efficiency. Indeed, the NH3 yield and FE of Co@JDC/GF are superior to those of most of the recent NO3RR electrocatalysts, such as Cu50Ni50,50 O–Cu–PTCDA,51 CuOx,52 Au/C,53 Fe-PPy SACs,54 and Fe3O4/SS (ref. 55) (Fig. S25c and Table S4†). Besides, Co@JDC/GF also performs electrocatalytic NO3RR stably with nearly unchanged FE and NH3 yields during the cycling tests (Fig. S25d and S27†). Note that Co@JDC/GF is also active for NO3− electroreduction in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte (Fig. S28†), and is able to provide an NH3 yield rate of 0.6 ± 0.03 mol h−1 gCo−1 with a FE of 86.1 ± 4.1% at −1.0 V. No N2H4 was generated during the electrocatalytic NO3RR process in both alkaline and neutral media (Fig. S29†). The low H2 FE at each potential implies suppressed HER electrocatalysis on Co@JDC/GF during the NO3− reduction process (Fig. S30†). Besides, small amounts of NO3− are converted to NO2−via a two-electron pathway on Co@JDC/GF in both alkaline and neutral media (Fig. S30 and S31†). We also compared the NO3RR activities of Co@JDC/GF, JDC/GF, and bare GF (Fig. S32†). Both JDC/GF and bare GF are inactive for electrocatalytic NO3− reduction. Further, using the Co@JDC/GF as the catalyst, only 3.1 × 10−8 mol NH3 was detected after bulk electrolysis at OCP (Fig. S32h†). And NH3 in the catholyte after electrolysis at −1.0 V was found to be only 2.7 × 10−8 mol without adding NO3− (Fig. S32h†). Thus, the detected NH3 was synthesized by the NO3− electroreduction on our Co@JDC/GF. Interestingly, the Eonset of the NO2RR on Co@JDC/GF is more negative than the Eonset of the NO3RR, suggesting that our Co@JDC/GF prefers the NO3− reduction to the NO2− reduction in alkaline media.56 We also point out that the rate-determining step (RDS) on Co@JDC/GF is the NO2− reduction process rather than the NO3−-to-NO2− conversion reaction because the Tafel slope for the NO3RR of 48.05 mV dec−1 is much lower than 120 mV dec−1 (Fig. S33†).57 Therefore, Co@JDC/GF shows high NO3−-to-NO2− activity. A Zn–NO3− battery with Co@JDC/GF as the cathode was constructed to provide a power density of 7.8 mW cm−2 (Fig. S34a†) and increasing j with more negative applied potential (Fig. S34b†). Moreover, our battery shows a high OCP of 1.525 V vs. Zn (Fig. S34c†), only 0.3 V lower than the theoretical OCP for the Zn–NO3− battery. The NH3 production performances of such a battery were probed by performing discharge tests (Fig. S35†), and an NH3 yield of 0.1 mol h−1 gCo−1 at 20 mA cm−2 and a high FE of 82.5% were achieved (Fig. S34d†). Importantly, the assembled Zn–NO3− battery shows strong operation stability toward NH3 production with steady NH3 yield and FE for at least 8 h (Fig. S34e†).
Furthermore, DFT calculations are used for investigating the mechanism of the NO2RR and the corresponding electronic structures of the catalysts, and detailed calculation methods and models are provided in the ESI.† According to the experiment, three representative catalyst models of Co(111), Co(200), and Co(220) are constructed (Fig. S36†). The reaction free-energy diagrams of the NO2RR on these three models are shown in Fig. 4a, the corresponding structures of the intermediates are displayed in Fig. S37,† and corresponding adsorption energies are listed in Table S5.† As shown in Fig. 4a and S38,† the step of *NH to *NH2 is the rate determining step (RDS) on Co(111) and Co(200), while the step of *NH2 to *NH3 is the RDS on Co(220). By contrast, the barrier of RDS on the Co(111) is more favorable than that on Co(200) and Co(220) (0.18 eV vs. 0.43 eV and 0.33 eV, U = 0 V), indicating the NO2RR performance on Co(111) is much higher than the other two planes. Besides, the competing reaction of the HER is the main challenge of the NO2RR. In order to explore the high FE of Co@JDC/GF, the HER mechanism is further calculated on all three models of Co(111), Co(200), and Co(220) (Fig. 4b), the comparison between the RDS barriers of the NO2RR and the Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG) of the H atom in the HER is carried out (Fig. 4c), and the corresponding intermediate structures are displayed in Fig. S39.† According to the calculations, the RDS barrier of the NO2RR on Co(111) is lower than the ΔG of the H atom (0.18 eV vs. 0.26 eV, U = 0 V), while the RDS barrier of the NO2RR on Co(200) and Co(220) is higher than that of the ΔG of the H atom (0.43 eV vs. 0.28 eV, and 0.33 eV vs. 0.18 eV, U = 0 V), suggesting that the NO2RR is the dominant reaction on the Co(111), while the HER is the dominant reaction on the Co(200) and Co(220). Actually, relatively inert H2O molecules are the reacting species for the HER in alkaline media, and hence the water dissociation kinetics of the Volmer step, namely the energy barrier of O–H bond cleavage, is usually more crucial to the overall reaction rate. As shown in Fig. S40,† the Volmer step (H2O → *H + *OH) of Co(111) exhibits an overall energy change of 1.16 eV over that of Co(200) and Co(220) (reaction models shown in Fig. S41†). Such a high energy barrier reflects poor HER activity on the Co(111) surface. These results exactly explain the excellent selectivity of the NO2RR on the Co@JDC/GF catalyst and the Co(111) plane is the activity site of the NO2RR.

(c) Relationship of the barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) in the NO2RR and the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of atomic H in the HER on the above three surfaces. (d) Projected density of states (pDOS) of the metal Co atoms in the three models of NH–Co(111), NH–Co(200), and NH2–Co(220), in which the D-band center is inserted with color fonts. (e) Charge density differences of the key intermediates of NH, NH2 or NO2 on the above three planes, light green and pink areas represent charge density accumulation and depletion, respectively; the cutoff of isosurfaces is 0.05 electrons Å−3. In the inset structures, the Co, N, O, and H atoms are shown in blue, cyan, red, and white, while the band gap is marked by the black font. 
In addition, to get insight into the relation between the catalytic activity and the electronic structure, the Bader charge analysis of different elements (Table S6†), the projected density of states (pDOS) of the metal Co atoms (Fig. 4d), and the charge density differences of the key intermediates (Fig. 4e) are investigated. To avoid misunderstanding, the inverse Bader charge is given here, which can be seen as the charge of the different elements. For the three planes of Co(111), Co(200), and Co(220), when the intermediates of NH, NH2 or NO2− are adsorbed, all the average charges of Co atoms are positive (Coδ+), while the charges of the N atom in NHx and O atoms in NO2− are negative, indicating that the Co atoms would donate electrons to the bonded N and O atoms. For comparison, the average charge of Co atoms in NH–Co(111) and NO2–Co(111) (0.17 and 0.18) is lower than that in NH–Co(200) and NO2–Co(200) (0.23 and 0.26), as well as NH2–Co(220) and NO2–Co(220) (0.25 and 0.25), suggesting that a stronger interaction can occur between the intermediates and the latter two surfaces, which can also be displayed by the corresponding adsorption energies in Table S5.† The pDOS reveals that the D-band center of the Co atom in Co(111) is lower than that in other planes (2.53 eV vs. 3.71 eV and 3.36 eV), manifesting that the higher D-band center can lead to more electron donation, which can also be reflected in the charge density differences of the key intermediates in Fig. 4e. In a word, based on the analysis of the electronic properties of these three planes, it is inferred that the lower D-band center of Co(111) leads to less positive charge of Co atoms (Coδ+) in the catalysts and lower adsorption energies of the intermediates, and thereby contributes to the higher catalytic activity and selectivity of the NO2RR, which is well in agreement with our experimental results.
In summary, we demonstrate that Co@JDC acts as a highly efficient NO2RR electrocatalyst for NH3 synthesis. Juncus derived carbon allows for higher mass loading of more dispersed cobalt nanoparticles with smaller size and considerably boosts the overall conductivity and stability. Remarkably, the NH3 yield and FE of our Co@JDC/GF can reach 2.8 ± 0.1 mol h−1 gCo−1 and 96.9 ± 2.1% at the optimal potential, respectively, which compare favorably with most reports adopting NO2− as a source for NH3 electrosynthesis. Moreover, the stability of Co@JDC/GF under working conditions is proven to be excellent after cycling tests for a total of 15 h. Additionally, efficient NO2−-to-NH3 conversion is also achieved on our Co@JDC/GF. DFT results reveal that the lower D-band center and the less positive charge of Co atoms (Coδ+) on the Co(111) plane lead to lower adsorption energies of the intermediates (NHx and NOx), thus leading to high catalytic activity and selectivity of the NO2RR. Future studies can thus focus on developing Co nanocatalysts preferentially oriented in the Co(111) direction for the NO2RR. This work not only offers a cost-effective catalyst material for high-performance electrochemical NO2−-to-NH3 conversion, but would open a new avenue for the construction of Co-based nanocatalysts for efficiently converting oxyanions present in environment and gaseous nitrogen oxides58,59 to NH3 under ambient conditions.
