    , Accepted 13th May 2023First published on 15th May 2023AbstractAmmonia can be decomposed to produce exclusively hydrogen and nitrogen so that it could function as a means for hydrogen storage. In situ hydrogen production from ammonia decomposition can effectively meet the challenges of hydrogen storage and transport. The specific energy cost of in situ hydrogen production from ammonia is lower than that of common energy sources, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Among the noble metal and non-noble metal components, Ru and Ni catalysts are the most worthy of study. Metal carbides, metal nitrides, and perovskites also have considerable potential. In addition, improving the structure or composition of the support to enhance the performance of catalysts is also a worthy research topic. Now, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic ammonia decomposition technology is also developing in full swing. Membrane reactors can integrate ammonia decomposition and hydrogen separation processes, which could attract researchers to optimize the process from various aspects. The present situation and future challenges of ammonia decomposition are also explored as to how to further reduce the ammonia decomposition temperature.
1. Introduction
There is a widespread consensus that conventional fossil fuels, such as oil, will be exhausted in the near future. It takes a long time to generate them, and burning them produces a lot of toxic sulfur and nitrogen, and carbon-containing waste, which are not environmentally friendly.1 However, due to the limitation of technology and equipment, new energy is still hard to replace traditional energy completely. Therefore, hydrogen comes to our attention, and it could be considered a new energy source with no pollution and CO2 emissions.2 The use of hydrogen energy is an effective way to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality. Because the only product of hydrogen combustion is water and no COx emission, which has a significant advantage over other traditional energy sources. At present, hydrogen has become one of the main alternative energy sources for vehicles, such as cars, and it also has practical applications for storing excess electricity during peak power generation.3
Hydrogen has a very high energy density by mass (119.7 MJ kg−1 of lower heating value at 25 °C and 1 bar).4 However, hydrogen storage and transportation bring us great challenges. First, hydrogen storage in liquid form for transportation requires very low temperature and high pressure,5 which not only brings great energy consumption but also puts forward high requirements on storage materials. Second, the diffusion of hydrogen in the container will cause the material to embrittle and weaken.6 The use of transportable compounds to store hydrogen and release it through chemical reactions is considered a pragmatic approach. These compounds can be methanol, methane, metal amine salts, ammonia, and other related compounds, which can meet the above requirements.7,8 Among them, ammonia to hydrogen is an effective and feasible scheme for on-site hydrogen production. Ammonia has many advantages, such as high gravimetric (17.7 wt% H2) and volumetric H2 density, high energy density, liquid state under mild conditions (20 °C and 0.8 MPa), and billion tons of annual production. Schueth et al.9 proposed that hydrogen produced by ammonia decomposition is a good source of hydrogen for fuel cells. Even if the ammonia could not be fully converted to hydrogen, some materials such as resins can be used to absorb the unconverted ammonia without poisoning the anode of the fuel cell. In addition, the specific energy cost of ammonia is lower than that of common energy sources such as liquefied petroleum gas.10,11 Moreover, the decomposition of ammonia to produce hydrogen is more economical than traditional methanol to produce hydrogen.
Considering the source-to-tank basis, the cost of ammonia ($4.50 per Gallon of Gasoline Equivalent, GGE) is ∼18% lower than methanol ($5.46 per GGE) and ∼31% lower than hydrogen ($6.55 per GGE).12 Similar results have been reported by the International Energy Agency in 2020.13
The advantages of ammonia decomposition for hydrogen production are described above, but some researchers believe that direct combustion of ammonia is also a good way to use it. NH3 has a high energy density (3160 W h L−1) and negligible thermal NOx emissions.14 However, NH3 combustion presents the following problems: (i) high ignition temperature, (ii) low combustion rate, and (iii) kinetic N2O/NOx production. In order to overcome these problems, it is necessary to establish a novel ammonia combustion system, and some researchers have put forward catalytic combustion, which is regarded as a promising technique for decreasing emissions from hydrocarbon-based fuels.15 The thermodynamic reaction equations for ammonia decomposition and ammonia combustion are given in eqn (1) and (2), respectively. Some researchers have also reported a combination of ammonia oxidation and ammonia decomposition.16
NH3 decomposition: NH3(g) → 0.5N2(g) + 1.5H2(g) ΔH° = 46 kJ molNH3−1(1)
NH3 oxidation (combustion): NH3(g) + 0.75O2(g) → 0.5N2(g) + 1.5H2O(g) ΔH° = −317 kJ molNH3−1(2)
This mini-review mainly indicates the promotion effects of different methods in COx-free hydrogen production from ammonia decomposition. Ammonia decomposition still needs to be better understood and optimized, especially since there is no industrial process available so far.17 There exist certain difficulties and challenges in ammonia decomposition. First, current large-scale NH3 decomposition reactions require high temperatures above 700 °C to achieve the full conversion. An important reason is that the recombination resolution of N atoms for ammonia decomposition on the catalyst surface is significantly inhibited at low temperatures.9 Such high temperatures make on-site hydrogen production less energy efficient and incur considerable energy consumption.18 Second, the toxicity of NH3 is an essential safety concern. Moreover, high process pressures would reduce the equilibrium conversion rate.19 One significant countermeasure is that the storage of ammonia in liquid or solid form has been a mature technology, which can be integrated with the distribution network already in place.20,21
The technologies using the recovered hydrogen from ammonia are particularly sensitive to NH3.22 In methanol production from syngas, ammonia impurities cause the formation of trimethylamine as a byproduct.23 Thus, catalytic ammonia decomposition must be 100% complete, or a post-purification process is required. When ammonia is not fully converted, the post-purification process is performed by (pressure swing) adsorption or H2-permeable membranes,24 adding additional costs and reducing the effectiveness of using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier.
Therefore, one of the most significant challenges in the preparation of hydrogen from ammonia decomposition is to customize a most effective catalyst that is energy efficient, highly selective, scalable, and inexpensive, providing a stable rate at low temperatures. Commonly used catalysts for the decomposition of ammonia include platinum, palladium, chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium. Ru and Ni show the most active catalytic activity among noble metals and non-noble metals, respectively.25 In addition to metal catalysts, metal amides, metal nitrides, metal carbides, and other catalysts, have been investigated through a lot of research.
We summed up the different methods to promote ammonia decomposition (Fig. 1). The addition of metal components to catalysts is a feasible technique to promote ammonia decomposition. The structure and type of catalyst support also affect the catalytic activity. In recent years, the electrocatalytic decomposition of ammonia to produce hydrogen has been extensively studied. The catalytic activity of the metal electrode can be significantly improved by applying a current or potential between the catalyst surface and the electrode. Photocatalysis is based on the principle of using light energy to excite electrons and holes, and the reaction conditions are mild and the energy consumption is low. Optimizing the reactor performance is also an effective way to promote ammonia decomposition. Recently, membrane reactors have become popular for ammonia decomposition because they can integrate the ammonia decomposition and hydrogen separation processes into one place while having excellent reaction performance and greatly reducing reactor volume.26

2. The different methods to promote ammonia decomposition
2.1. Metal addition
In previous studies, the active metals used for ammonia decomposition have been thoroughly studied. These are Ru, Pt, Pd, Co, Mo, Ni, Fe, Ir, and so on. In addition, a variety of metal components have been developed as promoters to improve the activity of catalysts. The addition of metals to Ru-based catalysts has also been studied the most. In the following, the different metal doping could be systematically summarized.

2.1.1. Addition of rare earth metal, alkaline metal, etc.. 
It is found that Ru catalyst is one of the most active and stable catalysts for ammonia decomposition.27 As early as 2004, Yin et al.28 published a review of ammonia catalytic decomposition focusing on Ru catalysts, concluding that Ru loaded on carbon nanotubes (CNT) has the highest activity and KOH was the best accelerant. As shown in Fig. 2, Wang et al.29 tested other types of nitrate promoters for Ru/CNTs catalysts and obtained the following promotion order at 400 °C: K > Na > Li > Ce > Ba > La > Ca. Hill and Torrente-Murciano30 reported that the ammonia decomposition activity of Ru/CNT was promoted by Cs (20 wt%) (Fig. 3). 20 wt% Cs loaded Ru/CNT catalyst showed ammonia decomposition activity at the temperature of <500 K and the activation energy significantly decreased. Raróg-Pilecka further found that the TOF of NH3 over KNO3-Ru was much higher than the Cs–Ru/C catalyst.31 The reaction rates over Cs–Ru/carbon were found to be higher than those over Ba–Ru/carbon. Their apparent activation energies were 134 and 158 kJ mol−1, respectively.32 Moreover, Wang et al. further employed salts of different anions to modify the Ru/CNTs catalyst at a K/Ru atomic ratio of 1/1. These results showed that the order of promoting effect was: KNO3 > KOH ≈ K2CO3 > KF > KCl > KBr > K2SO4 ≈ K3PO4. The influence of different K/Ru atomic ratios on KNO3-modified Ru/CNTs was studied, and it was found that the best K/Ru atomic ratio for KNO3-modified Ru/CNTs was around 2.29 For Ru/MgO catalyst, the activity of Ru/MgO doped with K could reach that of Ru/CNT, while the activity of Ru/MgO exceeded that of Ru/CNT using Li2NH as a promoter.33 In addition, due to the limited resources of ruthenium, some researchers have turned their attention to other metal catalysts for ammonia decomposition. El-Shafie et al.34 used three methods to synthesize different zeolite-based catalysts. The ratio of Ru, Li, and zeolite was changed to analyze the effect on ammonia decomposition performance. The catalyst with a mass ratio of 40 g (SA-600A)/5 g RuCl3·nH2O/3 g LiOH·H2O showed the highest activity, and the ammonia conversion rate reached 99.87% at 490 °C. Chung et al.35 found that the performance of Ru/Al2O3 could be improved by adjusting the load of La, and found that LaAlO3 perovskite had high catalytic activity and stability as a carrier in their study.

Among the non-precious metals used as catalysts for ammonia decomposition, Ni catalyst has been the most studied because it showed remarkable activity. The catalyst used for industrial ammonia decomposition is usually nickel supported by alumina. However, its catalytic performance did not meet the need for the high activity for ammonia decomposition. The addition of rare earth elements such as lanthanum to the alumina nickel system can improve the ammonia decomposition activity. Okura et al.36 studied the effects of different rare earth elements on the catalytic activity of the alumina nickel system, which followed the trend of La ≈ Pr ≈ Nd > Y > Sm > Eu ≈ Gd > Ce. The La-modified catalyst calcined at 400 °C followed by reduction at 600 °C exhibited the highest ammonia conversion of 94% at 550 °C.
Different proportions of dopants (Ce or Mg) were added to LaNiO3 perovskite to explore the effect on catalytic performance.37 Doped perovskite with Ce or Mg content equal to 0.9 (mol mol−1) showed 59.1% and 72.3% conversion at the reaction temperature of 350 °C, respectively. The activity comparison between this work and previous work at 350 °C is shown in Fig. 4. Cho et al. prepared monometallic 10 wt% Ni catalyst and alkaline-earth-metal (Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba)-doped Ni catalysts supported on the ultra-stable Y (USY) zeolite. The results showed that the surfactant-added Mg-promoted catalyst exhibited superior performance due to the high dispersion of Ni and MgO particles and the enhanced acidic and basic properties.38 Podila et al.39 studied the substitution of La by adding Ce in LaNiO3 and LaCoO3 catalysts, and found that partial substitution of La by Ce in perovskite catalyst had a significant effect on the catalytic performance, especially at lower temperatures. La0.5Ce0.5NiO3 catalyst has the highest activity among the prepared catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5, the conversion rate of ammonia can reach more than 95% at 550 °C. Zheng et al.40 found that the addition of CeO2 greatly improved the catalytic activity and stability of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for ammonia decomposition to produce COx-free hydrogen. The addition of CeO2 enlarged the catalyst pore, moderated the interaction between Ni and alumina, and suppressed the sintering of Ni0 microcrystal. Zhao et al.41 also studied the addition of K, Ba, La, Ce, and Zr nitrate to the Co–Mo nitride catalyst. These results showed that the La-promoted CoMoNx/CNTs catalyst had the best catalytic performance. At 600 °C, NH3 conversions over CoMoNx/CNTs, Zr–CoMoNx/CNTs, Ce–CoMoNx/CNTs, K–CoMoNx/CNTs and Ba–CoMoNx/CNTs catalysts were only 71.46%, 73.94%, 82.89%, 85.09%, and 90.37%, respectively, while NH3 conversion over La–CoMoNx/CNTs catalyst was up to 97.63%. Al-attar et al. prepared cobalt catalysts supported on perovskite-type xCeO3 oxide (x: Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). They concluded that 5Co–BaCeO (5 wt% Co impregnated on BaCeO3 support) catalyst showed the highest activity among all other catalysts and the sequential order of exhibited NH3 conversion was as follows: 5Co–MgCeO < 5Co–CaCeO ≤ 5Co–SrCeO < 5Co–BaCeO.42

2.1.2. Addition of another active metal. 
The addition of active metals into single-component materials was examined for the ammonia decomposition performance. The volcano-shaped relation between the ammonia synthesis activity of different catalysts and their nitrogen adsorption energy is shown in Fig. 6. The curve showed that Ru and Os were the best catalysts among the pure metals on account that they were close to the optimum for the nitrogen adsorption energy. As indicated in Fig. 6, the combination of Mo (which bound N too strongly) with Co (which bound N too weakly) should be close to optimum and could exceed the activity of noble metal.43

Yang et al.44 found that the Ru–Co system supported by the zeolite imidazole ester skeleton (ZIF) exhibited excellent catalytic activity. Li et al.45 further found that Ru–Fe loaded with porous graphite had better ammonia decomposition than single Ru metal. The ammonia decomposition of Ru, Ni, Ir, and Fe core-shell nanoparticles was analyzed using density functional theory (DFT).46 Ru–Ni core–shell bimetallic nanoparticles exhibited similar activity to Ru-based single metal nanoparticles based on potential and adsorption energy diagrams of ammonia decomposition. In contrast, Ir–Ni and Fe–Ni core–shell nanoparticles showed negligible activity. Guo et al.47 also showed that Ni/Pt bifunctional catalyst exhibited two orders higher activity compared with the pure metal surfaces of Ni and Pt. Polanski et al.48 reported Ni-supported precious metal Pd nanoparticles, which showed higher efficiency and better stability for hydrogen production. Its TOF reached a value of 2615 mmolH2 gPd−1 min at 600 °C under a flow of 12 dm3 h−1. Huang et al.49 found that the synergistic effect of Ni and Co species in Ni–Co bimetallic catalyst showed better catalytic performance than the single metal catalyst. In addition, Zhang et al. observed that Fe–Co nanoparticles with a wide range of Co/Fe ratios loaded with carbon nanotubes were active for ammonia decomposition. The stability of Co was significantly improved by alloying with Fe.50 Lorenzut et al. also proved that bimetallic Fe5Mo5/YSZ catalyst had higher activity than mono-metallic Fe10/YSZ and Mo10/YSZ catalyst.51 It was further found that Co combined with a small amount of Mo (Co7Mo3/MCM-41) had a higher ammonia decomposition activity.52 Miao et al. investigated the performance of Fe5Mo, Fe5Ni, Fe5Pt bimetallic alloys over graphene using first-principles calculations. They found that the adsorption of N followed Fe6 > Fe5Mo > Fe5Ni > Fe5Pt, and the catalyst activity followed Fe6 < Fe5Mo < Fe5Ni < Fe5Pt.53

2.2. Metal nitrides
For metal nitrides, the stronger metal–nitrogen bond (M–N) meant that the NH bond was easier to separate, but at the same time, the N–N bond recombination energy barrier was higher.54 Iron-based catalysts were easy to nitride during ammonia decomposition because of their high N–N bond recombination energy barrier.55 Lei et al.56 prepared rod-like, cubic, and shaped Fe2N, and found that rod-shaped Fe2N had the best activity, with an ammonia conversion rate of 30% at 723 K and 68% at 773 K. According to the Arrhenius fitting curve, the activation energy of the rod-shaped Fe2N was the lowest, which was 128.21 kJ mol−1. XRD analysis showed that rod-shaped Fe2N had smaller grains and better dispersion, so it had the best activity among the three kinds. However, the deep nitridation could poison the iron-based catalyst and lose its high activity. Lu et al.57 proposed a method to remove excess nitrogen on the catalyst surface: they used atmospheric pressure double dielectric barrier discharge (DDBD) plasma to remove nitrogen atoms to increase the activity. They also found that the Fe/Fe4N mixed phase was the phase with the highest ammonia decomposition activity among the different phases of iron based nitrides.
Leineweber et al.58 used Ni(NH3)6Cl2 and NaNH2 as the main reactants to synthesize NiNx. N atoms on the octahedral sites of an hcp arrangement of Ni showed virtually complete occupational order at ambient temperatures, while the isotypic iron nitride epsilon-Fe3N showed reversible partial disordering within the same range of temperatures. Leybo et al.59 explored the bimetallic NiMoN catalyst for ammonia decomposition and concluded that the catalyst prepared with acetate as the precursor and solid by evaporation had the highest activity. Ternary nitrogen compounds with the best N binding energy, such as Co–Mo–N and Ni–Mo–N, showed good performance for NH3 decomposition.52,60
In addition, the stability of metal amide itself as a catalyst was not ideal, and the catalytic effect was difficult to meet the requirements of the need. So, metal amide as a promoter was added to other catalysts such as metal nitrides, and very good results were obtained. TiN, VN, CrN, and MnN showed higher activity when combined with Li2NH. Jianping Guo et al.61 reported a significant synergistic effect of Li2NH on MnN in the catalytic decomposition of NH3. MnN–Li2NH exhibited catalytic activity below 623 K, and the hydrogen production rate at 773 K was 40 times that of MnN. The stability of the MnN–Li2NH composite catalyst depended on the mole ratio of MnN and Li2NH, and the higher the content of Mn, the better the stability of the catalyst. Li+ showed a positive induction effect to enhance covalent Mn–N bonding and lead to changes in reaction pathways and energetics, resulting in increased activity. Kinetic analysis showed that the H2 release step has a higher barrier than the N2 release step. Furthermore, Pei Yu62 studied the synergistic effect of calcium imide (CaNH) on metal nitrides. Two kinds of catalysts were synthesized by ball milling, and it was found that CaNH had a strong synergistic effect on Mn6N5 in the catalytic decomposition of NH3. CaNH was involved in catalytic ammonia decomposition through the formation of [Ca6MnN5] intermediates, thus could change the reaction pathway, reducing the activation energy.
We found that there are few comparisons in the literature on the catalytic activity of ammonia decomposition by various nitrides (Table 1).

2.3. Support optimization
In addition to the active metal, the support also played an important role in the performance of the catalyst. The noble metal catalyst Ru showed different performances on CeO2,75 Al2O3,76 and MgO supports.77 Vaninice et al. found that at 683 K, the ammonia decomposition performance of 1.6% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was one order of magnitude higher than that of 4.8% Ru/C catalyst, but there was no significant difference in the activation energy. The activation energy of 4.8% Ru/C was 23 ± 1 kcal mol−1, and the average activation energy of 1.6% Ru/Al2O3 was close to 21 kcal mol−1.78 Choudhary et al.79 proposed in their study on ammonia decomposition to hydrogen that the activity of Ir catalyst supported on SiO2 was lower than that of Ir supported on Al2O3, but the TOF of the former was higher than that of the latter. Hayashi et al.80 reported that the ammonia decomposition efficiency of Ru nanoparticles loaded on electro-mechatronic compound C12A7: e− support was very high at high temperatures (600 °C). The reason was that the work function of C12A7: e− catalyst support was very low, and the electrons on it can be injected into the antibonding orbital of the Ru–N bond, which could accelerate the reaction speed. Meanwhile, Zhu et al.81 found that the electronic structure of LaAlO3 perovskite could be modulated by the substitution of heterovalent cations. Cao et al.82 prepared LaAlO3 to load Ru nanoparticles and further found that the activity order was Ru/La0.8Sr0.2AlO3 > Ru/La0.9Sr0.1AlO3 > Ru/La0.7Sr0.3AlO3 > Ru/LaAlO3. A certain amount of Sr ion substitution could enhance the electron donor capacity of the support and accelerate the recombination and desorption of nitrogen in the process of ammonia decomposition. They found that the Ru catalyst was in the electron-rich state on the support, so the N atom recombination and desorption were easier, and the ammonia decomposition reaction was accelerated. Lee et al.83 prepared Ru/SiO2 catalysts with different specific surface areas and different particle sizes. When the size of Ru particles in Ru/SiO2 increased from 2.3 nm to 5.4 nm, the catalytic activity was enhanced, which supported the view that ammonia decomposition was a structure-sensitive reaction. The activity of Ru supported on carbonized and noncarbonized Al2O3 nanofibers (ANF) was tested by Borisov et al.84 The result showed that the release of hydrogen reached 8.7 and 18.3 mmolH2 min−1 gcat−1 on Ru/ANFC and Ru–Cs/ANFC whereas only 4.4 and 9.6 mmolH2 min−1 gcat−1 on Ru/ANF and Ru–Cs/ANF, respectively. Cha et al.85 prepared Ru supported on four different alkali-exchanged zeolite Y supports (H-Y, Na-Y, K-Y, and Rb-Y) as catalysts by an ion-exchange method, obtaining the order of activity Ru/Rb-Y > Ru/K-Y > Ru/Na-Y > Ru/H-Y. Tang et al.86 prepared SmCeOx composite oxide with Sm3+ occupying Ce4+ site in CeO2 crystal lattice as the support and supported 2% Ru as the catalyst. The ammonia conversion was increased from 54.6% to 74.9% at a temperature of 400 °C and a space velocity of 3900 ml gcat−1 h−1 when CeO2 was replaced by Sm0.4Ce0.6O1.8.
Muroyama et al.87 studied the catalytic activity of Ni/La2O3 catalyst and found that the catalytic activity of Ni/La2O3 was comparable to that of Ni/Al2O3, despite the low surface area of the carrier material (4.7 m2 g−1). When the Ni content of the Ni/La2O3 catalyst was 40 wt%, the conversion rate was the highest at 550 °C, which was 78.9%. The formation of LaNiO3 was responsible for the high activity of Ni/La2O3 catalyst for ammonia decomposition. Muroyama et al.87 also demonstrated that the catalytic activity of Ni supported by different carriers followed the following trend: Al2O3 ≈ La2O3 > SiO2 > MgO ≈ CeO2 > TiO2 > ZrO2. Nakamura et al.88 found that the activity of Ni-based catalyst with Y2O3 as the support was higher than that of other metal oxides (Al2O3, CeO2, La2O3, MgO, and ZrO2). This indicated that the effect of ammonia decomposition was not only related to the dispersion of Ni metal but also to the binding energy of Ni–M. Lucentini et al.89 reported the use of 3D printing technology to produce CeO2, which was undoubtedly of great significance in the research on CeO2 support. They subsequently prepared a catalyst using CeO2 as support and obtained the optimal catalytic performance when the active phase was 0.5Ni0.1Ru (w/w%).90 Zhang et al.91 prepared Ni particles supported on active attapulgite (AATP) as an ammonia decomposition catalyst by a homogeneous precipitation method and found that the 20%-Ni/ATTP catalyst showed a 95.3% NH3 conversion with 31.9 mmol min−1 gcat−1 H2 formation rate at 650 °C.
In addition, Yuan et al.92 reported the synthesis of high specific surface area and mesoporous Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 solid solution by the surfactant-assisted method as a Ni catalyst for ammonia decomposition reaction. The activity of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 supported Ni catalyst is higher than that of Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/CeO2. Okura et al.93 investigated the catalytic activity of oxides or mixtures of oxides as support for Ni and obtained trends of catalytic activity closely related to material basicity: BaZrO3 > SrZrO3 > SmAlO3 ≈ GdAlO3 > SrTiO3 > LaAlO3 ≈ BaTiO3 > Al2O3 > CaMnO3 > CaZrO3 > SrMnO3 > BaMnO3 > MnO2 > NaNbO3 > CaTiO3 ≈ KNbO3 > Nb2O5 > TiO2 > ZrO2. Catalysts supported on a mixture of oxides showed excellent catalytic activity compared with catalysts prepared using simple oxides. Furthermore, Zhao et al.94 studied the effect of the type of catalyst support on the performance of ammonia decomposition catalyzed by nitrides. They studied the activities of cobalt-molybdenum nitride catalysts supported by carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, 5A zeolite, and aluminum oxide. Carbon nanotubes as catalyst support showed the best performance because cobalt and molybdenum were uniformly dispersed on this support. At 550 °C, the ammonia decomposition conversion rate of Co–Mo nitride loaded on carbon nanotubes could reach 84.4%, while the highest conversion rate of other types was less than 70%.
The same support and different preparation methods could result in different catalytic performances. In addition to the traditional co-precipitate method (CP) and wet impregnation method (WI), the solid ion exchange method (SSIE) improved solid ion exchange method (MSSIE)95 and low-temperature chemical alloying technology (LTCA)96 have also been developed. Podila et al.97 prepared Co/Mg–La mixed oxide catalyst for ammonia decomposition by impregnation and co-precipitation method and found that the catalyst prepared by the co-precipitation method has superior activity among the other catalysts. Hu et al.95 prepared a series of Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts by the methods of wet impregnation (IM), deposition–precipitation (DP), solid-state ion exchange (SSIE), and modified solid-state ion exchange (MSSIE), and used for catalytic decomposition of ammonia to COx-free hydrogen. They found that the catalyst prepared by the MSSIE method exhibited the best catalytic activity due to the presence of strong metal–support interaction between highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles and ZSM-5 support. The stability testing results showed almost no activity loss at 650 °C for 60 h. Table 2 lists the latest activity studies on ammonia decomposition.

2.4. Electrocatalytic ammonia decomposition
It is well known that if part of the metal was used as an electrode, catalytic activity can be significantly increased by passing a current or potential between the catalyst and the reverse electrode deposited on the solid electrolyte. Ammonia decomposition can be carried out efficiently under electrocatalysis at low temperatures. The theoretical energy consumption of the ammonia electrolysis process (assuming no kinetic limitations to the reaction under thermodynamic conditions) can be calculated from the standard potential of the cell, which was equal to 1.55 W h g−1 H2, while the hydroelectrolysis could require at least 33 W h g−1 H2 under standard conditions. This suggested that ammonia electrolysis theoretically consumed 95% less energy than water electrolyzers.102 Therefore, it was necessary to develop an improved catalyst for hydrogen production by the electrical decomposition of ammonia.
Electrocatalytic ammonia decomposition can be divided into two steps: the ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); the high-efficiency electrocatalyst should drive both AOR and HER at a low potential. Zhong et al.103 systematically investigated the mechanism and activity of different metal atom pairs anchored on molecular g-CN for NH3 electro-oxidation by the first-principles calculations. They found that Rh2@g-CN and Ir2@g-CN exhibited great AOR and HER efficiency due to their low ΔGPDS values (0.52 and 0.48 eV) and ΔGH values (0.03 and 0.20 eV), indicating that Rh2@g-CN and Ir2@g-CN were desired bifunctional electrocatalysts for prompting ammonia decomposition. They also investigated the catalytic electro-oxidation of liquid ammonia on surfaces of transition metal dimer anchored on g-CN (TM2@g-CN) and reported a mechanism whereby the N–N bond formation occurs between hydrogenated NHx species rather than between the N adsorbed atoms. This result supported the mechanism proposed by Gerischer and Mauerer.104
Lim et al.105 employed a cell based on the proton-conducting electrolyte, cesium dihydrogen phosphate (CDP), a solid acid compound. The electrocatalyst was Pt with high tolerance to fuel impurities. The overall configuration of the ammonia decomposition cells is presented in Fig. 7. In addition, they also compared the hydrogen production rates achieved here to those from conventional thermal-cracking experiments reported in the literature (Fig. 8). It was shown that it was possible to generate hydrogen at a substantially high rate by integrating electrochemical product removal with thermal decomposition of ammonia.105 Pinzón et al.106 reported the electrochemical activation (EPOC) of Ru catalyst film with alkaline ion conductors for catalytic ammonia decomposition to produce hydrogen. They prepared two electrocatalysts, Ru/Na–βAl2O3 and Ru/K–βAl2O3, and tested them under low-temperature reaction conditions (250–350 °C). Among the two electrocatalysts, the effect of K was stronger, increasing the hydrogen production rate above 230% at 300 °C under optimal conditions. In Modisha's work,107 the decomposition of ammonia on Pt–Ir electrocatalyst was studied in a 5 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. The maximum ammonia conversion was 78% for 2300 ppm ammonia. Furthermore, the maximum hydrogen flow rate obtained was 25 L h−1 and the corresponding energy consumption was 1.6W h LH2−1. The hydrogen purity obtained from gas chromatography was 86%. Dong et al.108 also prepared five kinds of electrocatalysts of Pt-Black, Rh, Pt–Ir, Rh–Pt, and Rh–Pt–Ir alloys, and performed electrochemical tests on them for ammonia decomposition in the presence of NH4Cl. Rh–Pt–Ir tri-metal catalyst had the best activity: the Emin minimum was 0.47 V, and the maximum current density was 46.9 mA cm−2 at 2 V.

 Fig. 8  Comparison, on a catalyst mass-normalized basis, of the hydrogen generation rate obtained from the hybrid thermal-electrochemical approach of this work (pNH3 = 0.6 atm) with prior work by thermal decomposition.105 
Pitselis et al.109 explored the electrochemical facilitation of ammonia decomposition reactions. The electrochemical promotion of Fe catalyst was reported for the first time using a Fe catalyst electrode connected with proton (CaZr0.9In0.1O3-α)110 and K (K2YZr(PO4)3)111 conducting solid electrolyte carrier. It was also shown that proton and K ion conductors can be used to induce the catalytic activity of non-Faraday electrochemical modification of ammonia decomposition reaction. Vitse et al.102 prepared bimetallic catalysts by electrodeposition for the production of low-load active electrodes for the electro-decomposition of ammonia at low temperatures. These bimetallic catalysts containing Pt and a low concentration of secondary metals (Ru, Ir) showed higher activity at lower overpotentials and it could improve the efficiency of the ammonia decomposition process. Meng et al. developed a 2D thermo-electrochemical model to investigate the heat/mass transfer, chemical (ammonia thermal decomposition), and electrochemical reactions in a planar SOFC running on ammonia. The model integrated three sub-models to simulate the heat and mass transfer phenomena. It was beneficial to obtain a higher output current and high ammonia decomposition rate by increasing the inlet temperature of ammonia.112
2.5. Photocatalytic ammonia decomposition
Photocatalytic reaction conditions are mild and the energy consumption is less, so it has attracted wide attention. Li et al.113 found that using the RuO2–NiO–SrTiO3 catalytic system, the photocatalytic decomposition rate of ammonia in an aqueous solution was higher than that of ammonia in the gas phase. Nazir et al.114 showed that activated carbon as a support for TiO2 has achieved the best effect for ammonia adsorption, and the ammonia decomposition rate was proportional to the light intensity. Dong et al.115 prepared cotton fabrics loaded with TiO2, which was prepared by padding or coating the methods with the UV irradiation of 365 nm wavelengths preparation. The TiO2-padded cotton fabric has a better ammonia decomposition property. Yuzawa et al.116 studied the mechanism of the photocatalytic decomposition of ammonia by TiO2 loaded with Pt. As shown in Fig. 9, Pt-loaded anatase TiO2 obtained the highest product yield among the investigated Pt-loaded TiO2 samples. It had a large surface area and could produce hydrogen at a rate of 5.5 μmol min−1.
 Fig. 9  The hydrogen production rate over the various Pt(0.1)/TiO2 photocatalysts. Red, green, and blue circles correspond to the TiO2(A), TiO2(A/R), and TiO2(R) samples, respectively. The open symbols, two filled symbols, and a half-filled symbol indicate anatase, rutile, and anatase/rutile mixture, respectively.116 
Reli et al.117 indicated that the lowest Ce loadings (0.6 wt%) in TiO2 had the highest ammonia decomposition activity. Kaneko et al.118 used a molecular photoelectronic relay composed of Ru(BPY)32+, methyl viologen, and dioxygen to decompose ammonia solution under visible light. Kudo et al.119 designed a Ru/ZnS photocatalyst, which showed activity for the decomposition of aqueous NH3 solution into N2 and H2 under simulated sunlight irradiation (initial H2 evolution of 4.2 μmol gcat−1 h−1). Yuan et al.120 synthesized a Co single-atom catalyst supported on CeO2 nanosheets (SA Co/CeO2), which showed excellent photocatalytic and thermal activity. The ammonia decomposition rate of SA Co/CeO2 solar heating showed a stable H2 generation rate of 2.7 mmol g−1 min−1, which was 572 times that of ammonia decomposition driven by weak sunlight. The hydrogen produced could directly drive hydrogen fuel cells without any purification. The thermal catalytic decomposition of ammonia to hydrogen over SA Co/CeO2 was 29.1 mmol g−1 min−1 at 450 °C (Fig. 10), which was comparable to that of precious metals and 291 times higher than that of the corresponding Co nanoparticles. Theoretical calculation showed that SA Co/CeO2 could effectively reduce the energy barrier of nitrogen binding in the process of ammonia decomposition.

Xia et al.121 reported a highly activated FePi-coated α-Fe2O3 nanorod (NRs) photoanode for enhancing PEC ammonia decomposition. The photocatalyst achieved ∼54% NH3 decomposition in 3 h at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated sunlight illumination. The formation of FeOOH was key, and the specific mechanism of NH3 decomposition by PEC based on FePi/Fe2O3 photoanode is shown in Fig. 11. In the future, the synergistic effect of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic processes could significantly enhance the ammonia decomposition performance of PEC. Table 3 shows the respective advantages, challenges, and keys of photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, and electrocatalysis for ammonia decomposition.

2.6. Optimization of ammonia decomposition reactor
At present, the thermal decomposition of ammonia by photocatalytic decomposition, electrocatalytic decomposition, and other means have been studied. Thermal decomposition is still the most familiar, but it requires higher reaction temperatures and larger reactors. These reactors are not only bulky and expensive but also have a limited effect on ammonia decomposition. Therefore, developing high efficiency and small-volume ammonia decomposition reactor is a good way to promote the decomposition of ammonia.122
A membrane reactor is worth studying because it can integrate the ammonia decomposition reaction and membrane high-purity separation process.26 Itoh et al.123 found that this kinetically limited ammonia decomposition can be enhanced in the Pd membrane reactor. Compared with the traditional-packed reactor, the conversion rate of the membrane reactor with 200 microns thick Pd tube was increased by 15%, and the hydrogen recovery rate was increased by 25% at 450 °C. Sitar et al.124 found that adding zeolite to the Pd membrane reactor could improve the separation capacity of the membrane reactor and reduce the impurities in the permeable hydrogen.
Xie et al.125 used the finite time thermodynamics (FTT) theory to establish an ammonia decomposition membrane reactor model, which was equipped with a solar heat absorption system. Finally, the thermal efficiency and energy conversion rate have different degrees of optimization. In the following research,126 they established the ammonia decomposition endothermic membrane reactor model again, and showed that ammonia molar flow rate and ammonia preheating temperature have little effect on system efficiency and total heat absorption rate. Also, a recent study showed that the ammonia decomposition efficiency in membrane reactor can be improved mainly from two aspects: one is to increase the thickness of the membrane selective layer, and the other is to use a small purification device to separate the permeate material again during the membrane permeation process.127
3. Ammonia decomposition promotion mechanism
The mechanism of ammonia decomposition can be summarized as follows: ammonia is first adsorbed to the active site of the catalyst, and then ammonia molecules are adsorbed at the active site and begin to dehydrogenate. After hydrogen atoms were removed successively, nitrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms were recombined and desorbed into nitrogen and hydrogen, respectively.128 The equations are as follows (eqn (3)–(8)). Some researchers found that for the noble metals Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, etc., N–H bond breakage was a rate control step. Prasad et al. proposed the second N–H scission to be the rate-determining, with adsorbed atomic nitrogen and hydrogen being the most abundant reactive intermediates (MARI) on Ru/γ-Al2O3.129 NH3(g) + s ⇆ NH3(a)(3) NH3(g) + s ⇆ NH2(a) + H(a)(4) NH2(g) + s ⇆ NH(a) + H(a)(5) NH(g) + s ⇆ N(a) + H(a)(6) 2N(a) ⇆ N2(g) + 2s(7) 2H(a) ⇆ H2(g) + 2s(8)
For non-noble metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni, nitrogen recombination desorption was a speed control step.9 Appari et al.130 investigated the kinetics of the ammonia decomposition reaction on nickel catalysts. The result indicated that recombinative nitrogen desorption is the rate-limiting step based on previous results by McCabe131 and Choudhary et al.79 Other studies also found that the rate control steps were different at different conditions. For example, Tsai et al.132 reported that the speed control step of a Ru-based catalyst below 377 °C was nitrogen desorption, while the speed control step above 477 °C was N–H cleavage. Therefore, the important research direction of low-temperature ammonia decomposition is how to accelerate the rate of nitrogen desorption or N–H bond breaking. Yeo et al.133 clarified the detailed catalytic mechanism of NH3 decomposition on an Fe (100) surface using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. They compared the adsorption of two types of ammonia dimers (2NH3), locally adsorbed NH3 and hydrogen-bonded NH3, revealing that the former is more stable than the latter. Moreover, the investigation of the catalytic activity of an Fe surface precovered with N revealed a reduction in the catalytic activity as the N coverage on the Fe surface increased. Lian et al.134 investigated the stepwise dehydrogenation of NH3 molecules on Fe6M (M = Fe, Mo, Ni, and Co) clusters employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The result showed that NH3 prefers to bind to the top metal atom through the N end, which is in agreement with the electrostatic potential analysis. The reaction energy barriers showed that the last dehydrogenation step (NH* + * ⇌ N* + H*) is the rate-determining step for most investigated Fe clusters.
Metal amides and metal imides have different mechanisms to catalyze ammonia decomposition. In the process of ammonia decomposition, some metal amides and their corresponding metal imides would interconvert.135 Wood et al.136 studied the decomposition mechanism of ammonia on metal amides and found that metal amide only played the role of promoter in this process, and its mechanism was different from that of metal catalysts. For the decomposition of ammonia by nitride catalyst, N atoms usually occupied the gap between metal atoms, which changed the electron distribution and electron density on the metal surface, and thus may reduce the activation energy of ammonia decomposition. According to previous studies, dehydrogenation and nitrogen desorption were continuous during ammonia decomposition over transition metal nitride catalysts. The kinetics of ammonia decomposition over a powdered vanadium nitride catalyst was studied at 700 mm Hg in the temperature range 400 °C to 480 °C. It was found that the decomposition mechanism of vanadium nitride was similar to that of tungsten.137
In the field of electrocatalytic ammonia decomposition, there are two established mechanistic pathways for ammonia electro-oxidation (AOR): which are differentiated by their N–N bond formation step, as shown in Fig. 12. The first one is “G–M” mechanism, proposed by Gerischer and Mauerer,104 NH3 →  →  → ⋯ → N2, whereby the N–N bond formation occurs between the adsorbed NHx and NHy species, and then the hydrogenated NHxNHy in which the species are sequentially deprotonated to N2. The second one is “N + N” mechanism, NH3 →  → NH* → N* + N* → N2. In which N–N bond formation occurs between N-adsorbed atoms formed by the complete dehydrogenation of ammonia.103 For HER, there are two steps to generation H2. (1) The atomic H adsorption on the catalysts; (2) the formation and release of H2 molecules. AOR and HER comprise the process of electrocatalytic ammonia decomposition.
 Fig. 12  Proposed scheme for the most feasible steps during electrochemical oxidation of ammonia on TM2@g-CN.103 
In the report by Pinzón et al.,106 the alkaline ions (Na+ and K+) from the solid electrolyte supported the ruthenium catalyst film, activated the hydrogen production rate, enhanced the chemisorption bond of N surface species and thus facilitated the ammonia decomposition reaction. The addition of electron accelerators to accelerate the catalytic reactions was based on the electrochemical supply of promoter ions from a solid electrolyte material (support) to a metal catalyst (working electrode) by the application of electrical currents or potentials. This electrochemical activation of the catalyst by using solid electrolyte support allowed the in situ electrochemical addition or removal of promoters to different kinds of catalysts.109,138,139 Yuzawa et al.116 found that TiO2 was a typical N-type semiconductor that could absorb photons to activate electrons and create holes. The results showed that photoelectron holes could oxidize ammonia to amide radicals and protons, and amide radicals further form hydrazine. Hydrazine broke down, while the photoelectrons reduced the protons to produce nitrogen and hydrogen.
4. Further challenges for ammonia decomposition
Numerous efforts have been devoted to the development of highly active and robust catalysts, aimed at the decomposition of ammonia at the lowest possible temperature. How to further reduce the temperature of ammonia decomposition to improve efficiency and promote environment-friendly processes is the challenge.
Due to the shortcomings of these existing catalysts, metal nitrides may be one of the most promising catalysts for ammonia decomposition in the future. In the process of ammonia decomposition, it was easy to form a certain amount of nitride in any case.140,141 For example, Lee et al.73 found that Ni-decorated Co3Mo3N catalyst exhibited the NH3 conversion rate (71%) at 500 °C, and the performance might remain stable for 30 h of long-term testing. Highly dispersed molybdenum nitride (MoN/Mo2N) nanocrystals anchored on in situ support were also designed and synthesized as catalysts with the highest NH3 decomposition rate of 30.58 mmol g−1cat min−1 among any Mo-based catalysts reported to date.74 The catalysts composed of MnN and amides of the metals demonstrated superior activity. The catalytic activity of MnN combined with the imide Li2NH obtained a higher activity compared to the results with a Ru/CNTs catalyst under the same reaction conditions.61 Therefore, metal nitrides could have a theoretical advantage in ammonia decomposition reactions.
It is generally accepted that NH3 decomposition catalyst support should present high basicity, along with high conductivity, low concentration of electron-withdrawing groups, and high surface area. Basicity could increase the dispersion of the active metal and enhance the ammonia dehydrogenation and the recombinative desorption of surface N atoms, which were the most likely rate-limiting steps of the reaction. The electron-donating properties of the catalyst can have an indirect interaction with the support to induce stronger basicity. Therefore, modulating the basicity of supports seems to be fundamental for the development of efficient catalysts for NH3 decomposition.
5. Conclusion
Hydrogen production from ammonia decomposition could avoid the CO2 production, which is a good choice for in situ hydrogen production in fuel cells. The main ways to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production from ammonia decomposition include optimization of active components and carriers in conventional thermal decomposition, electrocatalytic decomposition of ammonia, photocatalytic decomposition of ammonia, and optimization of ammonia decomposition reactor. In addition to Ru and Ni catalysts, nitride, carbide, and perovskite catalysts were also popular in the optimization of active components. In the future, it is worth studying how to separate and purify hydrogen produced by ammonia decomposition at low cost and high efficiency. Microwave and plasma decomposition of ammonia may also be studied more in the future.
