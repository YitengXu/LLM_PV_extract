    , Accepted 25th November 2015First published on 2nd December 2015AbstractThe exploration of inexpensive and efficient anode buffer layers is essential in large scale commercial applications of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, we report a simple way that can significantly enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and extend the lifetime of PSCs. A solution-based tungsten oxide (WO3) layer with surface oxygen vacancies (VOs) is introduced as an efficient anode buffer layer between the active layer and indium tin oxide (ITO) glass. The PCEs of PSCs based on P3HT:PC61BM and PBDTTT–C:PC71BM active layers are improved by 24% (from 3.84% to 4.76%) and 27% (from 5.91% to 7.50%) with the introduction of the WO3 (VO) anode buffer layer, respectively, compared to that of the conventional PEDOT:PSS layer. The excellent performance is ascribed to the greatly improved fill factor and enhanced short circuit current density of the devices, which are benefited from the surface with lots of VOs for better interfacial contact and excellent charge transport properties of the WO3 (VO) layer. The impressive PCE, good stability, easy fabrication and compatibility with solution processed organic photovoltaic devices support this material's potential applications in PSCs for both wide bandgap and narrow bandgap polymers.
Introduction
Intensive effort has been devoted to the development of polymer solar cells (PSCs) in recent years due to their great potential in terms of low-cost, light weight, and easy fabrication on large-area flexible substrates.1 Encouraging advances have been made, and state-of-the-art PSCs have reached efficiencies exceeding 10%.2–4 However, much attention has been focused on the molecular structures and morphology of materials.5–11 Challenges still exist in finding satisfactory anode buffer layers with reliable, environmentally robust and easily processable crafts. For conventional PSCs with indium tin oxide (ITO) as the anode, polyethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as the anode buffer layer due to the higher work function as well as smoothening of the rough ITO film.12,13 Unfortunately, the strong acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS causes inhomogeneous corrosion that deteriorates the electrical properties and degrades the stability of the cells.14–18 To overcome this problem, a series of transition metal oxides, such as molybdenum oxide (MoO3),19,20 vanadium oxide (V2O5),21–23 nickel oxide (NiO),24–27 tungsten oxide (WO3)28–30 and rhenium oxide (ReO3),31 have been developed as alternative intermediate materials for the suitable work functions and air stability. These materials have been employed as hole injection layers in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and PSCs to reduce the injection barrier at the polymer/electrode interfaces.32–34 Among those transition metal oxides, WO3 is an extraordinary anode buffer layer for use in PSCs due to its suitable optical and electrical properties, high work function, air stability, low toxicity and capability of minimizing the series resistance and improving the fill factor of PSCs.35–38 Generally, the preparation of WO3 buffer layers in both OLEDs and PSCs is usually based on high-cost vacuum-based techniques, such as thermal evaporation, electron-beam evaporation, or hot filament vapor deposition.39–50 Recently, solution-based methods have been used to fabricate WO3 buffer layers,51 but a post-annealing process is required to allow the precursors to thermally decompose into WO3. In addition, the efficiency of state-of-the-art WO3 buffer layer based cells is very limited,30 because of the low conductivity and mediocre interfacial charge transfer of WO3. Therefore, it seems greatly vital to improve the performance of the WO3 buffer layer that is fabricated via low-cost solution-processed PSCs.
As is well known, even a very small decrease in the oxygen content gives rise to a dramatic increase in the electrical conductivity of WO3.52,53 A later study indicated that VOs depending on oxygen pressure and temperature during the process of oxide film formation will greatly affect the film crystal structure, conductivity and charge transport properties. Through investigating the effect of VOs on WO3 conductivity, Gillet et al. realized that the defect band caused by VOs increases the conductivity by lessening the band gap.54 Liao et al. found that the O/W ratio and the amount of W6+ ions in the WO3 nanowire films could be increased by increasing the annealing temperature, and the conductivity was decreased due to the reduced VO concentration.55 In the scope of photoelectricity, Li et al. fabricated WO3 nanoflakes with VOs by a simultaneous solution etching and reducing process, and found that the improved photoelectric conversion efficiency was attributed to the increased charge carrier density created by VOs.56 Cheng et al. introduced VOs into commercial WO3via hydrogen treatment, and found the dual effect of VOs that could serve as shallow electron donors to facilitate the charge migration and act as the active sites for absorbing electrolytes.57 Therefore, one strategy to increase the conductivity of WO3 and the interfacial charge transfer is to increase the VO concentration appropriately.
Here, in order to improve the interfacial properties and simplify the preparation process of WO3, an O2 plasma process was introduced by replacing thermal annealing. A smooth WO3 layer was prepared by spin coating tungsten(VI) isopropoxide propanol solution (5%) and then treated with O2 plasma. The precursor can be decomposed to WO3 by O2 plasma directly. Most of all, the surface contains a large quantity of VOs, which could not only increase the conductivity of WO3 to facilitate the hole transfer, but also form excellent interfacial contact. Hence, the short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) were significantly increased when using WO3 (VO) as the anode buffer layer in PSCs. In this work, taking PEDOT:PSS, thermally annealed WO3 (Δ) and O2 plasma treated WO3 (VO) as the anode buffer layer independently, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs was investigated based on P3HT:PC61BM (wide bandgap polymer) and PBDTTT–C:PC71BM (narrow bandgap polymer). The PCE was improved by 24% (from 3.84% to 4.76%) and 27% (from 5.91% to 7.50%) with the introduction of the WO3 (VO) anode buffer layer, respectively, compared to that of PEDOT:PSS.
Results and discussion
The structure of the solution-based WO3 layer was subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, as shown in Fig. 1(A). The broad diffraction peak at 2θ of 15–30° indicates the amorphous structure of the WO3 layer, which is less rigid and shows a better tolerance to the interfacial contact than its crystalline counterpart. The transmittance spectra of the WO3 layer on the ITO in comparison with those of the bare ITO substrate and the PEDOT:PSS layer on ITO are shown in Fig. 1(B). The high optical transmittance in the range of 330–430 nm was thought to be attributed to the smoothness of the ITO thin film surface with the PEDOT:PSS modification layer, which reduces dispersion and extinction of light caused by a rough surface (see the AFM section), which is in accordance with previous studies.58 The WO3 layer is highly transparent in the visible range and the transmittance of the samples coated with WO3 prepared with different methods shows almost the same spectra, which is even better than the PEDOT:PSS layer in the wavelength range of 430–550 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were taken to determine the purity and composition of the prepared WO3 anode buffer layers, as shown in Fig. 2. The WO3 films were fabricated through spin coating tungsten(VI) isopropoxide propanol solution (5%) at 4000 rpm on the precleaned silicon substrate and then treated as the devices were prepared. The binding energies (BEs) are corrected with C 1s (284.42 eV). As shown in Fig. 2(A) and (B), the characteristic peaks of W, O and C elements in the 0–1200 eV BE range can be seen. The peaks having binding energies at 35.9, 38 and 42 eV correspond to W 4f7/2, W 4f5/2 and W 5p3/2, respectively, in WO3 (+6 oxidation state, W6+).59,60 However, a careful study showed that the peaks at 34.5 and 36.6 eV corresponding to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of W5+ verify the existence of surface VOs.61,62 The peak with a binding energy of 530.5 eV is assigned to the oxygen atoms in WO3, the peak at 531.5 eV is attributed to O atoms in sub-stoichiometric WOx, and the peak at 532.5 eV is assigned to O in water molecules adsorbed on the surface of the film.63 The XPS results demonstrate the presence of VOs in the WO3 film, generated from the reduction of W6+ to W5+ during the process of O2 plasma treatment, which probably form defects and active sites for organic molecule bonding and facilitate interfacial charge transfer.

Surface morphologies of the WO3 layers were investigated by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 3, compared to bare ITO with a roughness of 3.93 nm (Fig. 3(A)), the modification of the WO3 layer under thermal annealing results in a lower roughness of 3.20 nm (Fig. 3(C)), which is still larger than that of PEDOT:PSS (2.31 nm) (Fig. 3(B)). While the O2 plasma treated WO3 (VO) shows the lowest roughness of 1.59 nm (Fig. 3(D)), the decreased roughness of the surface is favorable for the interfacial contact. The surface energy of the WO3 layer was explored by contact angle measurements as shown in Fig. 3 (E, F, G). The contact angle for the PEDOT:PSS layer is 17.41°, for the WO3 (Δ) layer, it is increased to 34.17°, and interestingly, for WO3 (VO) it is 16.59°. The results show that the WO3 (VO) exhibited better interfacial affinity properties when the active layer was spin-coated onto it.

The PSCs with the structure of glass/ITO/WO3/polymer:PCBM/Ca/Al, as shown in Fig. 4(A), were fabricated. Here, P3HT and PBDTTT–C were used as donors, as shown in Fig. 4(B), as well as PC61BM and PC71BM were used as acceptors. A schematic energy level diagram of the device is illustrated in Fig. 4(C). The energy levels are suitable for the charge separation and transport. Six types of devices as mentioned in the experimental section were prepared to investigate the effect of the WO3 anode buffer layer on the performance of the PSCs. J–V curves of devices A–F under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5(A) and (B). The optimized device performance is summarized in Table 1. For P3HT:PC61BM based devices, device A with the traditional PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer has a PCE of 3.84% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.61 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 9.53 mA cm−2, and a filled factor (FF) of 65.92%, comparable to that reported in the literature.64 Device B with the WO3 (Δ) anode layer shows a PCE of 4.23% with a VOC of 0.62 V, a JSC of 10.44 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.60%, which is consistent with WO3 as the anode buffer layer prepared with tungsten isopropanol oxide reported previously.30 In comparison, the PCE of device C with WO3 (VO) increases to 4.76%, with a higher JSC and FF of 11.23 mA cm−2 and 68.14%, respectively. To further explore the generality of the WO3 anode buffer layer in PSCs, another typical low bandgap donor polymer, PBDTTT–C, was studied. The J–V curves of the PSCs based on PBDTTT–C–T:PC71BM are shown in Fig. 5(B) and the related parameters are listed in Table 1. The traditional control device D with PEDOT:PSS as the anode buffer layer shows a PCE of 5.91% with a VOC of 0.70 V, a JSC of 15.54 mA cm−2, and a FF of 54.21%. Another control device E with the WO3 (Δ) anode buffer layer shows a PCE of 6.19% with a VOC of 0.70 V, a JSC of 15.27 mA cm−2, and a FF of 57.19%. In contrast, device F with the WO3 (VO) anode buffer layer has a champion PCE of 7.50% with a VOC of 0.70 V, a JSC of 17.08 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63.01%. J–V curves of devices C and F under various O2 plasma processing times are shown in Fig. S1,† along with related parameters listed in Table S1.†

Meanwhile, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the solar cells with different anode buffer layers were also measured, as shown in Fig. 5(C and D). Compared to the device fabricated with PEDOT:PSS, the device fabricated with WO3 (VO) exhibited a higher EQE covering a wider spectral range. In particular for P3HT:PC61BM solar cells, the maximal EQE reached 75.03% at 550 nm for the device with a WO3 (VO) anode buffer layer, and showed a much better photoresponse in the broad range of 400–620 nm. While for PBDTTT–C:PC71BM solar cells, the maximal EQE reached 72.88% at 660 nm for the device with a WO3 (VO) anode buffer layer, and showed a much better photo response in the broad range of 400–720 nm. Moreover, the JSC values calculated by integrating the EQE curves agree well with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves, as shown in Table 1. Combinedly, these account for a ∼20% and 10% increase in the JSC of P3HT and PBDTTT–C-based solar cells, respectively, indicating that the WO3 (VO) anode buffer layer was beneficial for device performance.
The resistance of the anode buffer layer is an important parameter that affects charge carrier transport and collection at the electrode. As shown in Fig. 4(D), the J–V curve of the WO3 (VO) layer exhibits the highest slope, i.e. the smallest resistance (4.0 Ω), while the PEDOT:PSS layer shows the lowest slope which means the largest resistance (13.4 Ω), and WO3 (Δ) falls in between the both, with a mediate resistance (6.2 Ω). The better conductivity of WO3 (VO) is beneficial for carrier transport in the anode buffer layer. Moreover, the interfacial conductivity between the anode buffer layer and the active layer could guarantee efficient carrier transport from the polymer film to the WO3 buffer layer. The series resistances (RS) are listed in Table 1, revealing a descending trend from PEDOT:PSS, WO3 (Δ) to WO3 (VO).
The interfacial charge transfer is a competitive process with exciton annealing, which results in photoluminescence (PL), therefore, time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) was used to monitor the PL decay of the polymer films on various anode buffer layers to further confirm the charge transfer characteristics. The films of P3HT or PBDTTT–C on WO3 buffer layers which have been annealed or treated by plasma O2 were investigated, and for comparison, bare P3HT or PBDTTT–C films on glass were also measured. Unfortunately, we did not detect the PL from PBDTTT–C films due to the weak signal. For the data of P3HT, optimum fits were obtained for a single exponential function after convolution with the instrument response (Fig. 6). As is shown, the WO3 (VO) results in a slight decrease in the PL lifetime in comparison to the both cases of PEDOT:PSS and WO3 (Δ). As we know, the PL of the active layer is arisen from the recombination of the excitons, which are generated by light excitation, and efficient interfacial charge transfer will accelerate the deactivation of the excitons thus resulting in fast PL decay.65,66 The results indicate that the charge transfer process taking place at the interface of the polymer and WO3 (VO) is higher than that of PEDOT:PSS and WO3 (Δ), which is consistent with the JSC increase.

To obtain a deeper insight into the role of VOs on the WO3 surface, a slab model is employed to simulate the surface structures, and density functional theory (DFT) is used to investigate the electronic structure properties. VOs are created by removing one (25% coverage) or two O atoms (50% coverage) on the clean (001) surface (0% coverage). Fig. 7A–C show the geometrical structure of WO3 under various VO coverages, and the corresponding band structures of (001) surfaces are also given in Fig. 7D–F. Evidently, the conduction bands tend to merge with the valence bands upon increasing VO coverage. The decreased band gaps, from 1.28 eV to 0.99 eV, induced by VOs lead to lower activation energy for the electron transition to increase the charge carrier density, which will increase the interfacial charge transfer and the conductivity of WO3. This is in accordance with the experimental results.

The stability of photovoltaic devices with P3HT as the active layer and various anode buffer layers of PEDOT:PSS, WO3 (Δ) and WO3 (VO) is investigated and represented in Fig. 8. The fast decay of PEDOT:PSS in all cases indicates its lower stability. The PCE decreases to less than 50% of the original value after 100 h exposure in a glovebox, and less than 40% after 500 h. The decrease is mainly ascribed to the obvious decay in both JSC and FF. The stability of PSCs is improved dramatically with the introduction of WO3 anode buffer layers between the active layer and the anode ITO. The PCE retains above 80% of its initial value after 500 h. The JSC and FF of PSCs with the WO3 buffer layer drop more slowly than that with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer. The JSC shows negligible reduction over time (Fig. 8(C)), which could be attributed to the stable nature of WO3. The stability evaluation of devices with PBDTTT–C as the active layer and various anode buffer layers of PEDOT:PSS, WO3 (Δ) and WO3 (VO) exhibits a similar trend (Fig. S2†).

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) using solution-processed annealing free WO3 anode buffer layers prepared by spin-coating a tungsten oxide alcohol solution on the ITO electrode and then treating by O2 plasma. The WO3 layer shows high light transmittance, high conductivity, and enhanced interfacial charge transfer. The PSCs with the WO3 (VO) anode buffer layer exhibit improved performance in comparison with conventional PEDOT:PSS and annealed WO3 anode buffer layers. The higher performance of the device is ascribed to the modified surface with lots of VOs for better interfacial contact and excellent electrical transport properties. DFT calculation further confirms that the band gaps of WO3 decrease with increased VO concentration to lower the activation energy for the electron transition, which is beneficial for the interfacial charge transfer and the conductivity of WO3. The PSCs presented here are far from being fully optimized, but the profound advantages along with ease of preparation, good stability and applicability for potential cost-effective manufacturing processes make it a good candidate for the anode buffer layer in PSCs. This work provides insights into the design of the interfacial hole transport layer for the fabrication of PSCs. The obtained results are therefore very encouraging and expected to be a new strategy to enhance the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
Experimental
Materials and preparation
ITO coated glass with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 was supplied by Shenzhen Display Co, Ltd (China). Tungsten(VI) isopropoxide (5% w/v in isopropanol) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. P3HT and PBDTTT–C were bought from Lumtec and Solarmer, respectively. PC61BM and PC71BM were purchased from American Dye Sources (ADS). 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich. All commercially available materials were used directly without any further purification.
Device fabrication
Six types of PSCs are designed as follows:
(A) ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P3HT:PC61BM (200 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), (B) ITO/WO3 (Δ, 16 nm)/P3HT:PC61BM (200 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), (C) ITO/WO3 (VO, 16 nm)/P3HT:PC61BM (200 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), (D) ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PBDTTT–C:PC71BM (90 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), (E) ITO/WO3 (Δ, 16 nm)/PBDTTT–C:PC71BM (90 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), and (F) ITO/WO3 (VO, 16 nm)/PBDTTT–C:PC71BM (90 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm).
The ITO coated glass was sequentially ultrasonically washed in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min each time. Then the pre-cleaned ITO coated glass was exposed to oxygen plasma to remove organic contaminants and increase the wetting envelope. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s on ITO coated glass, and then baked at 150 °C for 30 min in air. The WO3 was prepared by spin coating tungsten(VI) isopropoxide propanol solution (5%) at 4000 rpm on pre-cleaned ITO coated glass, and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air (WO3 (Δ)) or treated under O2 plasma (WO3 (VO)) for 9 min. Subsequently, the modified ITO coated glass was transferred to the glovebox filled with N2 and the active layer was prepared by spincoating the blend solution of donor materials and fullerene derivatives quickly. For P3HT:PC61BM based devices, the active layer was prepared by using the dichlorobenzene solution of P3HT and PC61BM (1:1 w/w, polymer concentration of 18 mg mL−1) on the modified ITO electrode, and then thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. The thickness of the active layer was around 200 nm. For PBDTTT–C:PC71BM based devices, the active layer was prepared by spin-coating the dichlorobenzene solution of PBDTTT-C and PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w, polymer concentration of 12.5 mg mL−1) with 3% volume ratio of the DIO additive on the modified ITO electrode. The thickness of the photoactive layer was about 90 nm. Finally, the substrate was transferred to a vacuum chamber and a Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) bilayer cathode electrode was thermally deposited on the active layer under a base pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa. The photoactive area of the device was 0.1 cm2 which is defined by a shadow mask.
Characterization and measurements
The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) pattern was obtained on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were obtained with an ESCA Lab250i-XL electron spectrometer from Thermo using 150 W Al Kα radiation. The transmission spectra of the films on ITO coated glass were recorded by using a scanning spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50 UV-vis) in the range of 250–800 nm at room temperature. Surface morphological characterization studies of the films were characterized by using a tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Agilent 5400). The water contact angle measurements were carried out on a JY-82 contact angle system (China). Deionized water is obtained from a Millipore ultrapure water system. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured with a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 with a Newport solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system. The TCSPC was performed using a home-built setup equipped with a picosecond pulsed laser (P-C-405B, 400 nm, 50 ps) and a photomultiplier (PMA-C-182 M).

Ab initio calculation
Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP).67,68 Ultrasoft pseudo-potential and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional were adopted.69 The electron–ion interaction was described by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) scheme.70,71 In the slab model, the (001) surface of γ-monoclinic WO3 with the space group of P21/n was considered, for it’s the most stable surface at room temperature. The first two atom layers were allowed to relax, the bottom layers of the slab were fixed. And the vacuum region was set to 15 Å between atom layers. A (3 × 3 ×1) Monkhorst–Pack scheme k-points sampling was used.72 During the process of structure optimization, the convergence criteria for energy, force and max displacement were set to be 10−5 eV, 0.03 eV Å−1 and 1.0 × 10−3 Å, respectively.
