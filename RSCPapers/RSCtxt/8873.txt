    , Accepted 24th April 2016First published on 25th April 2016AbstractNon-conjugated triethylene glycol (3-EG), tetraethylene glycol (4-EG) and pentaethylene glycol (5-EG) are presented as new cathode modification materials to achieve high-performance inverted-PCSs. By spin-coating from a non-chlorinated solvent, these small molecules can self-assemble on ITO via surface coordination and hydrogen bonding to form an ultra-thin layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that the coordination of oxygen atoms in the EG molecules to indium moieties on the ITO surface is the major mechanism in inducing interfacial dipoles, thereby reducing the work function (WF) of ITO for efficient electron collection. Based on the PBDTTT-EFT:PC71BM blend, the bulk heterojunction device using the 5-EG layer exhibited a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.27 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.69, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.46%, which are better than those of the corresponding devices using either inorganic ZnO or non-conjugated poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the cathode buffer layer. More importantly, this simple and expedited strategy is also demonstrated to be universally applicable to various p-type conjugated polymers. The EG oligomers with well-defined chemical structures have the advantages of easy availability, simple processability and good device reproducibility, which are crucial keys for future commercialization using large-scale roll-to-roll production.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative technique for producing clean and renewable energy due to their potential for fabrication onto large areas with lightweight flexible substrates by low-cost solution processing.1–13 A conventional PSC (C-PSC) device architecture consists of a low work-function (WF) Al cathode and a hole conducting PEDOT:PSS layer on top of indium tin oxide (ITO) as the anode.14–17 However, due to the rapid oxidation of the low WF metal cathode and etching of ITO by the acidic PEDOT:PSS layer, the PCE of a conventional un-encapsulated device rapidly degrades under ambient conditions. To overcome the poor device stability of C-PSCs, considerable research studies have been directed towards the device engineering of the inverted PSCs (I-PSC) that have opposite polarity of charge collection to C-PSCs. The merit of the I-PSC architecture is that air-stable metal such as Ag or Au can function as an anode for hole collection to avoid using air-sensitive Al, whereas ITO needs to serve as a cathode to collect electrons.18,19 Nevertheless, a large energy barrier at the interface between the WF of ITO (ca. 4.8 eV) and the LUMO energy level of an n-type fullerene material (ca. 3.8 eV) in the active layer detrimentally hinders the process of electron extraction.20–22 Consequently, inorganic metal oxides (MOs) such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium oxide (TiOx) have been commonly incorporated between ITO and the active layer in I-PSCs to improve the interfacial characteristics for electron collection due to their high electron mobility and visible-light transparency.23–27 Particularly, the higher-lying conduction band of ZnO at approximately 4.2 eV matches well with the LUMO energy level of fullerene for facilitating electron transportation. However, the success of the MO-based I-PSCs critically depends on the preparation of high-quality MOs which requires careful control of the sol–gel process.28,29 Furthermore, introducing an additional modifier on the top of ZnO is usually necessary to reduce the contact resistance resulting from the incompatible inorganic/organic interface.30–33 These tedious treatments inevitably increase the cost of fabrication and restrict commercialization.
Along with the inorganic semiconductors, developing organic-based interface materials is an alternative advanced strategy in terms of their easy solution processability and tunable functions through molecular engineering of chemical structures. It has been demonstrated that the electrical properties of the ITO surface can be effectively tuned by chemical or physical adsorption of a conjugated polymer grafting specific pendant groups such as neutral amino-functionalized groups.20 The nitrogen-containing moieties with high electronegativity and donating lone-pair electrons efficiently interact with the cathode surface to induce molecular and/or interfacial dipoles. Depending on the magnitude and the direction of the intrinsic dipole moment imposed by the interface materials, the reduction of the WF of ITO by shifting the vacuum-level can be achieved, which may decline the barrier for electron collection and/or reduce the charge recombination losses occurring in the interface, resulting in improving the performance of I-PSCs.20 Polyfluorene-based polyelectrolytes attaching ionic ammonium moieties as the side chains for inducing electrostatic interactions have also been described to fine-tune the WF of ITO.34–42 However, a delicate synthesis is required to make the aforementioned functional conjugated materials. Utilization of a non-conjugated polymer consisting of polar dipole-inducing groups has thus attracted growing attention in view of its easy synthesis and commercial availability. For instance, non-conjugated polyethylene oxide (PEO) has been employed as a cathode modifier in both C-PSCs45–47 and I-PSCs.48 However, the improvement of the PEO-inserted I-PSCs is only moderate presumably due to the insulating characteristics of PEO. To overcome the insulating nature of the non-conjugated materials, forming an ultra-thin interfacial layer (1–10 nm) such as polyethyleneimine is important to succeed in modulating the WF of ITO without worsening the electron tunneling.43,44 With an aim to search for better interfacial non-conjugated materials on the basis of the chemical structure of PEO, ethylene glycol-based oligomers (EGs) i.e. triethylene glycol (3-EG), tetraethylene glycol (4-EG) and pentaethylene glycol (5-EG) emerge as promising materials for investigation. Since the EG-based molecules have considerably smaller molecular weights than PEO, the intermolecular interactions between EG-based molecules are expected to be less significant, allowing for forming an ultra-thin layer on the ITO surface. Generally speaking, the possible advantages of employing EG-based materials in modifying the ITO surface include (1) the reduction of the WF of ITO by the presence of electron-donating oxygen functionality, advantageous to the Voc enhancement, (2) the formation of an ultra-thin interfacial layer, maximizing the electron-tunneling efficiency, (3) good chemical compatibility with the bottom ITO as well as the upper organic photoactive layer, and (4) simple fabrication, being favorably suitable for large-scale roll-to-roll production. In this research, high-performance I-PCSs were achieved by introducing a self-assembled ultra-thin EG-oligomer (SA-EG) layer. The PBDTTT-EFT:PC71BM-based device using the 5-EG layer as the modifier exhibited a high Jsc of 15.27 mA cm−2, FF of 0.69, and PCE of 8.46%, which greatly outperformed the ITO-only device.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the formation of a self-assembled 3-EG layer on the ITO surface. By spin-coating the EG solutions (40 mg/1 ml methanol), the EG oligomers can smoothly self-assemble on the hydrophilic ITO surface through two probable mechanisms: (1) the coordination of the oxygen atoms in the EG molecules to indium moieties on the ITO surface; (2) hydrogen bonding between the oxygen atoms of the EG oligomers and the hydroxyl groups on the surface of ITO (see Fig. 1).50 The ITO surface was further rinsed with methanol to wash out the weakly absorbed EG residues. In order to ensure that the SA-EG layer indeed exists on the ITO surface, we employed contact angle (CA) measurements to monitor the surface contact angle. The CA of the pristine ITO surface (after UV/ozone treatment) is 2°, whereas the CA of the ITO modified with SA-3-EG, SA-4-EG and SA-5-EG increases to 24°, 23° and 22°, respectively, due to the change of surface energy caused by the SA-EG layers. Moreover, after spin-rinsing the samples with ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), the contact angles only decreased slightly (20°, 22° and 20° for 3-EG, 4-EG and 5-EG layers, respectively), meaning that the SA-EG layers anchoring on the ITO surface have resistance to the o-DCB that will be used for processing the sequential active layer. Furthermore, the CA of the 3-EG layer only slightly decreased from 24° to 22° after washing with hot DI water (80 °C) or methanol (50 °C), indicating that the self-assembled EG layers are rather robust on the ITO surface.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to evaluate the work function of the ITO surfaces. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, the pristine ITO surface treated with UV-ozone exhibited a WF of 5.55 eV, while the ITO surface modified with 3-EG, 4-EG and 5-EG showed the reduced WF of 4.30 eV, 4.30 eV and 4.20 eV, respectively, especially the ITO with the 5-EG showed the largest ΔWF of 1.35 eV. The decrease of the work function is thus ascribed to the interfacial dipoles induced by the EG molecules at the ITO surface. It should be noted that the WF of ITO does not change when treatment with only methanol, indicating that methanol without EG molecules does not have modification effects on ITO.

It is known that the Voc of a planar heterojunction device is generally proportional to the energy offset at the interface between the HOMO energy level of the p-type material and the LUMO level of the n-type material. This characteristic can be further used to investigate the effect of SA-EG on the WF of the ITO by making a planar heterojunction ITO/(SA-EG)/P3HT/MoO3/Ag device and its reference ITO/P3HT/MoO3/Ag device without the SA-EG. The reference planar device with an ITO/P3HT heterojunction exhibited a Voc of 0.06 V, whereas the devices with the SA-3-EG, SA-4-EG and SA-5-EG layers between ITO and P3HT delivered a much higher Voc of 0.11 V, 0.11 V and 0.16 V, respectively. These results confirm that the modification of the ITO by using the SA-EG layers indeed decreases the WF of ITO leading to the greater energy offset at the interface and thus the higher Voc values. Fig. 3 demonstrates the energy level shift of ITO by using the SA-EG layer resulting in the improvement of Voc.

In order to gain insight into the WF reduction of ITO, DFT calculations were performed. Computational details are described in the ESI.† A simplified ITO surface (SITO, Fig. 4(a)) is used to represent the ITO surface, while diethylene glycol (2-EG) is chosen as a simplified model for the simulation of the 3-EG, 4-EG and 5-EG molecules. It should be emphasized that the used model system in this study could only provide a preliminary description of the ITO surface and the obtained computational estimates should be treated qualitatively. Possible interaction modes of 2-EG adsorbing on SITO deduced from our computation are summarized in Fig. 4(b)–(e). Mode 1 (Fig. 4(b)) is 2-EG adsorbing on SITO via hydrogen bonding. Mode 2 and mode 3 (Fig. 4(b)) are 2-EG adsorbing on SITO via hydroxy coordination. Mode 4 and mode 5 (Fig. 4(d)) are 2-EG adsorbing on SITO via internal oxygen coordination. Mode 6 (Fig. 4(e)) is two 2-EG adsorbing on SITO via hydroxy and internal oxygen coordination. Herein, the HOMO and LUMO energies are treated as coarse guesstimates for the valence and conduction bands of ITO, respectively.

(ΔHOMO is the HOMO energy difference relative to the HOMO of SITO; ΔLUMO is the LUMO energy difference relative to the LUMO of SITO.) 

Fig. 4 reveals that the hydrogen bonding between 2-EG and SITO gives marginal enhancement of the HOMO/LUMO energy. In contrast, the coordination modes either via internal oxygen or external hydroxy all result in much greater HOMO/LUMO energy elevation. Especially for mode 6 (Fig. 4(e)), two 2-EG molecules are able to increase the HOMO energy by 0.41 eV and the LUMO energy by 0.43 eV. These results suggest that the coordination of EG molecules on ITO is very likely to be responsible for the WF reduction.
Previous reports have pointed out that the change of the WF of a semiconductor is related to the electrostatic potential energy change and the bonding-dipole formation between the semiconductor and an adsorbing molecule.51,52
The electrostatic potential can shift the vacuum level and the bonding dipole is able to modify the Fermi level, both leading to the variation of the WF of the semiconductor. Extended transition state–natural orbitals for chemical valence (ETS–NOCV) analysis was thus conducted to look into the interactions between SITO and 2-EG for mode 1 to mode 6. Details about ETS–NOCV analysis are depicted in the ESI.† The interaction energy (ΔEint) is an approximation of the intermolecular strength. It is the sum of Pauli repulsion (ΔEPauli), electrostatic interaction (ΔVelst), orbital interaction (ΔEoi), and dispersion (ΔEdis), of which ΔVelst, ΔEoi, and ΔEdis are stabilization energy. ΔVelst and ΔEoi are associated with the electrostatic potential energy change and the bonding dipole between SITO and 2-EG, respectively. As revealed by Table 2, all interaction modes have noticeable ΔVelst and ΔEoi values and the stabilization contribution (see percentage in parenthesis) follows the order of ΔVelst > ΔEoi. The current theoretical framework cannot quantify the contribution of each term towards the WF reduction of ITO; however, it can be envisaged that both interactions have impact on it. Furthermore, as suggested by the computation, mode 1 (hydrogen-bonding) has the smallest stabilization energy and ΔEint, and mode 6 (double coordination) possesses the strongest stabilization energy and ΔEint, indicating that multiple coordination by the EG molecules is dominant on the ITO surface, leading to the WF reduction. Finally, the greatest orbital interactions existing in mode 1 to mode 6 are listed in Fig. 5. Green areas stand for the electron-density accumulation; orange areas denote the electron-density depletion. Through visualizing the contours of deformation density in Fig. 5, the interactions of hydrogen-bonding (Fig. 5(a)), hydroxy coordination (Fig. 5(b), (c) and (g)), and internal oxygen coordination (Fig. 5(d)–(f)) existing in mode 1 to mode 6 can be established. It is clear to see that the coordination modes can donate electrons down to indium but the hydrogen binding is limited only on the hydroxyl group. This theoretical observation is again consistent with our statement that the coordination of EG molecules on ITO may be the major contribution for the work-function reduction of ITO.

The surface morphology and transmittance properties of the SA-EG modified ITO surface were also investigated. The topography was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S1†). The pristine ITO surface exhibited a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.01 nm, and the ITO surface modified with SA-3-EG, SA-4-EG and 5-EG displayed a similar RMS roughness of ca. 0.98 nm, 1.01 nm and 1.24 nm, respectively. The transmittance of the SA-EG modified ITO glasses is shown in the Fig. S2.† All the samples showed a high transmittance of 93% in the visible region. These results indicate that the introduction of the SA-EG layer to modulate the WF of the ITO surface will not affect the surface morphology and the optical transparency of the ITO. After demonstrating the properties of the SA-EG layers on the ITO surface, we fabricated a series of inverted solar cell devices with the configuration of ITO/SA-EG/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag using different donor/acceptor materials whose chemical structures are shown in Fig. 6. Their corresponding reference devices (ITO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) without the SA-EG modification were also fabricated and characterized for comparison. For the active layer with PBDTTT-EFT,53 the J–V characteristics of these devices are shown in Fig. 7 and summarized in Table 3. The reference device 1a showed a low PCE of 1.94% with a Voc of 0.36 V, a Jsc of 11.63 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.46 under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Under the identical conditions, however, the device 1c with the SA-3-EG layer exhibited a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 14.92 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.68 leading to a much higher PCE of 8.14%. Similarly, the device 1d with the SA-4-EG layer displayed a PCE of 8.27%; moreover, the device 1e with the SA-5-EG layer showed the highest PCE of 8.46% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 15.27 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.69. These three devices with the SA-EG layers exhibited an overall improvement in the device parameters compared to the device 1a. More importantly, the efficiencies of the devices 1c–e are better than that of the device 1b using inorganic ZnO as the electron selective layer (ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 14.34 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.68 and a PCE of 7.82%), indicating that the EG oligomers can offer a promising alternative to traditional ZnO. Furthermore, we also made the device 1f (ITO/PEO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) incorporating a PEO layer (Mn ∼ 3000) for comparison. The device 1f exhibited an inferior PCE of 7.43% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 14.55 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.65. We suppose that the EG oligomers might be able to form a thinner layer than the PEO on the ITO for better electron tunneling. This result indicates that 3-EG, 4-EG and 5-EG are superior interface materials to the polymer-based non-conjugated PEO.

As shown in the energy level diagram in Fig. 8, the reference device has a large electron-injecting energy offset of ca. 1.6 eV between the LUMO energy level of PC71BM in the active layer and the WF of ITO. The unfavorable energy level alignment results in a lower build-in field and hampers the electron collection at the ITO cathode. Therefore, the device 1a delivered poor device parameters.

With the SA-EG layer to induce interfacial dipoles for reducing the WF of ITO, the electron-injecting barrier between the active layer and the cathode is reduced to ca. 0.3–0.4 eV which leads to the improvement of Jsc and FF in the SA-EG-based devices. On the other hand, the build-in field is also increased to dramatically enhance the Voc. Furthermore, the incorporation of the SA-EG layer can avoid incompatible inorganic/organic contact to decrease the contact resistance of the devices and diminish the leakage current and the charge recombination in the device. As shown in Table 3, the device 1a showed a shunt resistance (Rsh) of 176 Ω cm2 and series resistance (Rs) of 8.4 Ω cm2, whereas the devices with the SA-EG layers (1c–1e) exhibited higher Rsh and lower Rs. In addition to using PBDTTT-EFT as the donor material in the blend, this interfacial layer can be universally applied to various p-type polymers including PBDT-TS1,54 PBDCPDT-FBT,55 PBDCPDT-TPD,56 PDPP3T57 and P3HT (see Fig. 6). In a similar manner, the performance of the devices with these polymers all had remarkable improvement upon the introduction of SA-EG layers in comparison to their reference cells (Table 3 and Fig. 7). All the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. S3.† It should be pointed out that the spin–rinse of the as-cast EG layers with methanol to wash out the weakly absorbed EG residues is extremely important. If this step is omitted, the devices exhibited dramatically decreased efficiency due to the too thick insulating EG layers.
In addition to the traditional spin-coating technique, we also demonstrated that the SA-EG layers can be successfully formed by either a drop-casting method or an immersion method which are considered to be more compatible with the roll-to-roll and large-area device fabrication (Fig. 9), and the detailed processing procedures are shown in the Experimental section. Based on the two solution-processing approaches, we made the 3-EG modified devices using PBDCPDT-TPD as the p-type material, and the device characteristics are summarized in Table 4.

The devices fabricated with the drop-casting and immersion methods exhibited a PCE of 6.19% and 6.02%, respectively, which are comparable to that of the device fabricated using the spin-coating method (6.56%). The simple and easy non-spinning processing methods to form a SA-EG layer are highly advantageous for the large-area device production.
Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated that triethylene glycol (3-EG), tetraethylene glycol (4-EG) and pentaethylene glycol (5-EG) with well-defined structures can function as a superior cathode buffer layer to achieve efficient inverted polymer solar cells. These materials can be easily deposited on ITO by solution-processing techniques such as spin-coating, drop-casting and immersion using a non-chlorinated solvent without any post-treatment. The EG molecules form a self-assembled layer on the ITO surface via surface coordination and hydrogen bonding. The theoretical simulations reveal that the bonding dipoles are mainly induced by the oxygen–indium complexation at the interface, thereby effectively reducing the ITO work function to minimize the electron-injecting barrier and improve the interfacial contact. Based on the PBDTTT-EFT:PC71BM blend, the device with 5-EG exhibited a Jsc of 15.27 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.69, and a PCE of 8.46%, which greatly outperformed the device without the SA-EG modifier. Moreover, the enhanced efficiency is even better than the corresponding devices using either inorganic ZnO or non-conjugated PEO as the cathode buffer layer. More significantly, all the three EG oligomers can also be successfully applied to the other five p-type conjugated polymers. Compared to the conjugated or non-conjugated polymer-based interface materials with batch-to-batch variations in molecular weight and purity, the three EG small molecules with well-defined chemical structures can form an ultra-thin cathode layer to accomplish not only high efficiency but also good reproducibility. This work offers a simple, expedited, cost-effective and universal strategy to achieve high-performance inverted polymer solar cells, which is important for realizing future large-area production by roll-to-roll technology.
Experimental section
General measurements and characterization
Contact angle measurements were performed using a Face Model CAM-Micro by calculating the tangent line of the drop profile. Transmittance spectra were collected using the UV-HITACHI U-4100 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Surface topography was investigated using a Veeco diInnova AFM and standard tips (type Tap 300; L, 135 μm; FREQ, 300 MHz; k, 40 N m−1). UPS data were measured by using an Auger Electron Microprobe from a VG Scientific Sigma probe with a He I (21.22 eV) light source.
Device fabrication
The solar cell devices were fabricated by the following procedure: the ITO-coated glass substrate was pre-treated by ultrasonic cleaning in detergent, DI-water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min, respectively, and subsequently treated with UV-ozone for 45 min. For the device with the SA-EG and PEO layer, methanol solution containing EG (40 mg ml−1) was spin-cast at 500 rpm on the pre-cleaned ITO substrate to form a self-assembled EG thin film and laid in a glovebox for 1 hour. Subsequently, the as-cast film was spin-rinsed with methanol. (For the drop-casting method, the EG solution (40 mg/1 ml methanol) was dropped on the pre-treated ITO substrate, and the substrate was placed in a Petri dish for 30 min under ambient conditions. For the immersion method, the pre-treated ITO substrate was immersed in the EG solution (40 mg/1 ml methanol) and rested for 30 min under ambient conditions.) For the device 1b, the ZnO layer was prepared by a sol–gel procedure from ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated onto ITO-coated glass and followed by thermal annealing at 170 °C in air for 15 min to crystallize the film (thickness = ca. 40 nm).49 Furthermore, the active layers with the blending systems summarized in Table S1† were spin-coated on the top of different surfaces such as ITO, ITO/ZnO, ITO/PEO or ITO/SA-EG. After the post treatment in the glovebox, the MoO3 layer (7 nm) was evaporated thermally at a pressure below 10−6 torr. Finally, the top electrode, made of Ag film (100 nm-thick), was evaporated thermally at a pressure below 10−6 torr. The devices without encapsulation were characterized under the ambient conditions. Current–voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 SMU under the irradiation of a AM 1.5G San-Yi solar simulator with a JIS AAA spectrum. The characteristics of the solar cells were optimized by testing approximately 50 cells. IPCE spectra were measured using a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions with illumination by monochromatic light from a 250 W quartz-halogen lamp (Osram) passing through a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110).
