    , Accepted 10th June 2021First published on 10th June 2021AbstractBy an in situ modification of CdIn2S4 nano-octahedron on the surface of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets, ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composites with tight interface contact were obtained by a one-step solvothermal method. Because of the existence of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-heterostructure, the optimized sample (ZCIS-50) exhibited excellent photocatalytic H2 generation activity (12.67 mmol h−1 g−1) under visible light, which was approximately 15.1 times that of pure CdIn2S4 (0.84 mmol h−1 g−1) and 5.9 times that of ZnIn2S4 (2.13 mmol h−1 g−1). Based on experiments and simulation studies, the remarkable improvement of the photocatalytic performance of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 can be ascribed to the presence of a large number of Cd–S–Zn atomic bridges between ZnIn2S4 nanosheets and CdIn2S4 nano-octahedrons, which not only promoted the interfacial charge transfer but also inhibited the recombination of light-induced carriers. In Na2S/Na2SO3 solution, the apparent quantum yield of the ZCIS-50 sample at 420 nm was 18.73% with good stability under long-term irradiation. This work emphasizes the key role of interface design and defect engineering of in situ nano heterostructures. It may provide a promising strategy for the progress of high-efficiency photocatalytic water-splitting catalysts.
Introduction
Converting solar energy directly into hydrogen energy is identified as one of the most hopeful ways to alleviate energy crises and worsening environmental issues.1–3 Photocatalytic water decomposition technology for hydrogen production is expected to achieve utilization and storage of solar power.4,5 In the past few decades, various impressive materials have been explored for hydrogen evolution via photocatalytic water splitting, such as metal oxides,6,7 nitrides,8,9 sulfides,10,11 and phosphides.12 Nevertheless, these inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts generally contain precious metals and cannot meet the requirements of high quantum efficiency and visible light utilization simultaneously, which is far from practical applications.13,14
As a kind of ternary metal chalcogenide with a layered structure, ZnIn2S4 is one of the classic visible light-responsive photocatalysts. It has an adjustable (2.06–2.85 eV) direct band gap and a wide optical absorption range.15 Compared with conventional metal sulfides, ZnIn2S4 is less toxic and relatively easy to manufacture. In addition, ZnIn2S4 shows excellent chemical stability in the photocatalytic process.16,17 Based on the above advantages, ZnIn2S4 has been widely used in environmental protection,18,19 organic photo-synthesis,20 photoreduction of CO2 (ref. 21 and 22) and photocatalytic water decomposition for hydrogen production23,24 and other fields in recent years. Although the band gap of ZnIn2S4 can meet the requirement of releasing hydrogen from water, ZnIn2S4 still suffers from low efficiency of photogenerated carrier separation and poor mobility of charge carriers, which limits its practical applications.25,26
In order to improve the photocatalytic activity, various strategies have been developed, for instance, the construction of composite heterostructures, morphology control and defect engineering.27–29 Designing nanostructures with ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) structures is a valid way to enhance photocatalytic HER activity.30 Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) structures not only help to provide high specific surface area and shorten the diffusion length of charge carriers but also exposes plentiful active sites.31 On the other hand, defect engineering is regarded as a resultful strategy to increase photocatalytic efficiency.32,33 Recent studies have confirmed that defects can regulate charge transfer, band structure and surface active sites of photocatalysts.34,35 For example, the photocatalytic HER activity of Zn2In2S5 (ref. 36) increases steadily with the increase of sulphur vacancy concentration, which can be used as the active sites to capture electrons for proton reduction and the photosensitive unit to induce a visible light response. Similar phenomena were also observed in Bi5O7Br,37 Bi2WO6,38 SrTiO3,39 TiO2 (ref. 40) and CeO2 (ref. 41) with oxygen vacancies. Inspired by these studies, we design ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with sulfur vacancies to improve the photocatalytic HER performance.
In addition, constructing heterojunction is also a useful strategy to increase the photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4. Similar to ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4 is also a member of the AB2X4 family of ternary metal chalcogenide semiconductors. It reveals great photocatalytic performance under visible light because of its direct band gap and strong visible light capture capability.42 At present, these important physical and chemical properties of CdIn2S4 have been successfully developed in a lot of advanced applications, such as dye-sensitized solar cells,43 mineralization of persistent organic pollutants,44,45 selective organic conversion,46 photocatalytic water splitting47 and photocatalytic CO2 reduction.48 However, single-phase CdIn2S4 shows a high photogenerated carrier recombination rate because of its narrow band gap. In addition, the lack of catalytic active sites and the slow separation and migration kinetics of charge further limit its practical applications.49,50 Heterogeneous couplings of two kinds of metal sulfide with appropriate band gap potential are expected to enhance the photocatalytic activity. The built-in potential gradient between the interfaces of heterogeneous photocatalysts can not only facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, but also improve the photostability of hybrid materials, hence observably increasing the photocatalytic efficiency.
Although numerous examples of ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 based nanomaterials have made encouraging progress recently. There are still a lot of challenges to be resolved. The research on the formation mechanism and the interface force of the two-dimensional heterojunction is not clear and thorough enough. The focus of our work is exploring the enhancement mechanism of the photocatalytic performance of the heterojunction interface. Based on the aforementioned analysis, in this paper, the CdIn2S4 nano-octahedron was modified in situ on the surface of ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheet through a simple one-step solvothermal method to build a 2D/3D hierarchical heterostructure with nanoscale close interface contact. Under visible light, the optimized ZCIS-50 sample exhibited a photocatalytic H2 generation activity of as high as 12.67 mmol h−1 g−1, which is approximately 15.1 times that of pure CdIn2S4 (0.84 mmol h−1 g−1) and 5.9 times that of ZnIn2S4 (2.13 mmol h−1 g−1). Based on experiments and simulation studies, a remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic performance of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 can be put down to the large quantities of Cd–S–Zn atomic bridge between ZnIn2S4 nanosheets and CdIn2S4 nano-octahedron, which not only promotes interfacial charge transfer but also inhibit the recombination of light-induced carriers. At the same time, the introduction of CdIn2S4 also expands the light absorption range and further improves the utilization rate of visible light. In Na2S/Na2SO3 solution, the apparent quantum yield of the ZCIS-50 sample at 420 nm was 18.73%, and it has good stability under long-term irradiation. This work emphasizes the key role of interface design and defect engineering in in situ nano heterostructures. It may provide a promising strategy for the development of high-efficiency photocatalytic water-splitting catalysts.
Results and discussion
The details of the synthesis process are described in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 1, metal precursors In(NO3)3·6H2O and ZnCl2 were mixed with sulfur source thioacetamide (TAA) in an ethanol solution. By using one-pot hydrothermal treatment, ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 (ZCIS) nano-composites were obtained. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and scanning electron microscope (SEM) show that ZnIn2S4 nanosheets (Fig. S1†) are very thin and stacked on top of each other. It can also be observed that pure CdIn2S4 has irregular aggregation morphology and uneven particle size distribution (Fig. S1†), which is often detrimental to the transport of photogenerated charge. The SEM images (Fig. 2a and b) show that the composite typical sample ZCIS-50 was constructed by the CdIn2S4 octahedral nanoparticles with uniform particle size distribution and ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. Based on TEM analysis in Fig. 2c and d, the average size of CdIn2S4 octahedral nanoparticles is about 80 nm, and the particles are wrapped in thin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. There is no obvious change that can be observed in ZnIn2S4 nanosheets before and after the composite formation.

The heterostructures of ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 with a clear and close contact interface can be clearly observed from the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of ZCIS-50 (Fig. 2f and k), which is conducive to the high-speed separation and transfer of charge. As shown in Fig. 2g and h, lattice fringes of 0.410 nm and 0.320 nm spacings were observed can corresponding to the (006) plane and (102) plane of the hexagonal phase ZnIn2S4.51 The lattice fringes (Fig. 2i and j) with 0.327 nm and 0.384 nm spacings corresponding to the (311) and (220) planes, respectively, of cubic spinel CdIn2S4 are also observed.47 The SAED pattern (Fig. 2e) shows the characteristic electron diffraction spots of (110) and (102) planes for the hexagonal phase of ZnIn2S4 and the (220), (311) and (511) planes for the cubic phase of CdIn2S4, further confirming that the obtained materials are nanocomposites of ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4. The elemental composition and spatial distribution of ZCIS-50 were researched using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) and EDX elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 2l). The elemental mapping images show that the Cd element is concentrated and distributed in the core of the nanocomposites, while S, In and Zn elements are equally distributed in the entire nanocomposite. This is consistent with the above observations and confirms that an intimate nano-scale contact interface is formed between ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied to characterize the crystal structures of pure ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nanocomposites with different molar ratios. As shown in Fig. 3a, the crystal structure of pure ZnIn2S4 is identified as hexagonal phase (JCPDS 72-0773, a = b = 3.85 Å, c = 24.68 Å). The three distinct diffraction peaks at 21.8°, 27.6° and 47.2° match well with the (006), (102) and (110) crystal planes of hexagonal ZnIn2S4, respectively. In addition, no obvious diffraction peak corresponding to the ZnIn2S4 (104) crystal plane was observed at 30.4°, indicating a defect structure.52 The crystal structure of pure CdIn2S4 was determined to be a cubic spinel structure (JCPDS 27-0060). The diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 23.2°, 27.3°, 28.6°, 33.1°, 40.7°, 43.3°, 47.4°, 55.6° and 66.1° correspond to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440), (533) and (731) crystal planes of cubic spinel phase CdIn2S4, respectively.49 For ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composites, hexagonal ZnIn2S4 and cubic CdIn2S4 cannot form a uniform solid solution due to the mismatch of lattice parameters and space groups. Therefore, the characteristic diffraction peak of ZnIn2S4 at 21.8° gradually decreases with an increase in the molar ratio of Cd/Zn in the raw materials, while the characteristic diffraction peak of CdIn2S4 at 43.3° gradually increases, indicating the successful preparation of the nanocomposite. Additionally, no diffraction peaks from impurities were observed in all samples indicating a ultrahigh purity of the prepared products.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was estimated from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. CdIn2S4, ZnIn2S4 and ZCIS-50 samples exhibited the characteristic type IV isotherms with H3 type hysteresis loops (Fig. 3b), indicating the presence of a mesoporous structure.53 Moreover, the pore size distribution curves further confirmed (Fig. S2†) that these three samples are mesoporous materials. As shown in Table S1,† the average pore diameters of CdIn2S4, ZnIn2S4 and ZCIS-50 nano-composite computed by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method were 3.92 nm, 3.85 nm and 3.79 nm, respectively. According to BET method, the specific surface areas of CdIn2S4, ZnIn2S4 and ZCIS-50 nano-composite are 74.37 m2 g−1, 83.69 m2 g−1 and 98.89 m2 g−1, respectively. The hierarchical structure of ZCIS-50 nano-composite with higher BET specific surface area is conducive to expanding the contact area between the catalyst and the reactant, providing more adsorption and reaction active sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the hydrophilic characteristics of the materials before and after composite were characterized by water contact angle measurement. As shown in Fig. S3,† when compared with pure ZnIn2S4 (44.2°), the contact angle of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composite (ZCIS-50) decreased to 27.5°, which indicate that the hydrophilicity of ZCIS-50 was improved, which is beneficial to the contact between the catalyst and water molecules.
Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) was used to study the optical absorption characteristics and band gap energy of the prepared samples.54,55 As shown in Fig. 3c, all samples show strong light absorption extending from ultraviolet to the visible region. The absorption edge of pure ZnIn2S4 appears at about 500 nm, while pure CdIn2S4 shows wider light absorption with an edge located at about 560 nm. Obviously, compared with pure ZnIn2S4, the absorption edge of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composite has a red-shift, and the visible light absorption is enhanced implying a strong interface interaction between ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 in ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 heterojunction. The Kubelka–Munk function was used to estimate the optical bandgap (Eg) of the direct bandgap material:(αhν)2 = K(hν − Eg)where α is the absorbance index, hν is the energy of the photon, Eg is the bandgap and K is a constant. As shown in Fig. 3d, we can well approximate Eg values of the samples by extrapolating the linear portion of (αhν)2versus hν curve to (αhν)2 = 0.56,57 The Eg values of ZnIn2S4, ZCIS-10, ZCIS-30, ZCIS-50, ZCIS-70 and CdIn2S4 can be estimated to be 2.51 eV, 2.48 eV, 2.42 eV, 2.38 eV, 2.31 eV and 2.24 eV, respectively, which confirm that the prepared samples are responsive to visible light. Meantime, the band gap of the composite samples gradually shrinks and the visible light absorption increases as the content of CdIn2S4 increases, which may help improve the photocatalytic performance of the sample.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to analyze the surface composition and chemical state of pure ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composite (ZCIS-50). Fig. 4a shows the XPS survey spectra of these three samples. All signals of Zn 2p, Cd 3d, In 3d and S 2p are detected in ZCIS-50, which is in keeping with the EDS results, further proving that the ZCIS-50 sample consists of CdIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4. The Zn 2p spectrum of the ZnIn2S4 sample displays two peaks with binding energies of 1044.91 eV and 1021.85 eV, corresponding to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. 4b). When ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composites are formed, the characteristic signals of Zn 2p3/2 (1022.42 eV) and Zn 2p1/2 (1045.45 eV) shift slightly toward higher binding energy. When compared with pure CdIn2S4, in compsite ZCIS-50, Cd 3d3/2 (411.81 eV) and Cd 3d5/2 (405.05 eV) slightly shift to the lower binding energy (Fig. 4c). These results indicated that partial electrons transfer from ZnIn2S4 to CdIn2S4. Simultaneously, the binding energies for In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 of ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4 and ZCIS-50 (Fig. 4d) are 444.51 eV and 452.04 eV, 445.17 eV and 452.72 eV, 444.83 eV and 452.38 eV, respectively. The binding energies of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4 and ZCIS-50 (Fig. 4e) are 161.10 eV and 162.32 eV, 161.54 eV and 162.73 eV, 161.27 eV and 162.51 eV, respectively.50,58 This binding energy shift may be due to the strong interaction between ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4, indicating that there is a close interfacial contact between the two.51,59 It is conducive to the formation of an effective channel for photo-induced carriers transfer, hence further improving the photocatalytic performance.

The measurement of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum was used to confirm the existence of S vacancies in the sample. As shown in Fig. 4f, a clear ESR signal was found at g = 2.000, indicating that ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4 and ZCIS-50 samples contained sulfur vacancies, which was further confirmed from inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results listed in Table S2.†60 The ICP results show that the molar ratio of Cd and Zn between the reactant solution and the final product is close. The decrease in sulfur S content further indicates the formation of sulfur vacancies. Besides, we carried out zeta potential measurement (Fig. S4†) in order to characterize the dispersion of the samples in the aqueous solution. The results showed that the zeta potentials of pure ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4 and ZCIS-50 were −45.2 mV, −34.6 mV and −44.1 mV, respectively. This indicates that the samples have good dispersibility in water, which is conducive for the adsorption of more protons in the process of photocatalytic H2 evolution.52
The photocatalytic HER activity of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composites with different molar ratios, pure ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 were evaluated in a co-catalyst-free system by using 0.25 M Na2SO3 and 0.35 M Na2S as hole sacrificial agents. The relationship between accumulated H2 evolution amount and irradiation time is shown in Fig. 5a. With the extension of irradiation time, the H2 evolution amount increases linearly, indicating continuous hydrogen production. The composites reveal higher photocatalytic HER activity than the single component within 5 hours. The average H2 evolution rate was calculated to further check the photocatalytic performance, and the results are shown in Fig. 5b. Because of the fast recombination of electron–hole pairs induced by light, the photocatalytic H2 generation rate of pure ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 are merely 2.13 mmol h−1 g−1 and 0.84 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively. The corresponding hydrogen release rates of ZCIS-10, ZCIS-30, ZCIS-50 and ZCIS-70 composites are 3.94 mmol h−1 g−1, 7.44 mmol h−1 g−1, 12.67 mmol h−1 g−1 and 9.06 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively. Compared to pure ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4, the photocatalytic H2 generation rate of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composite increases significantly. This may be due to the strong interaction between ZnIn2S4 nanosheets and CdIn2S4 nano-octahedrons, which is conducive for the rapid interfacial charge transfer, thereby reducing the recombination of photogenerated carriers. In addition, sulfur vacancies in the composite also provide a large number of active sites for H2 evolution. It is notable that the photocatalytic performance of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 composite enhances with the increase of CdIn2S4 content. It exhibits the highest photocatalytic HER performance when the molar content of the CdIn2S4 component reaches 50%. However, further increases in CdIn2S4 content results in a decrease in the H2 release rate. Excessive CdIn2S4 not only hinders the absorption of light inside the material and reduces the utilization of light, but also shields the active sites on the surface. In addition, excessive CdIn2S4 nano-octahedron results in excessive surface, which leads to recombination of light-induced carries on the surface. Therefore, the appropriate content of each component is very important for the heterostructure photocatalyst to achieve the best activity. We also studied the stability of ZCIS-50 photocatalysts (Fig. 5c and d). After five consecutive photocatalytic HER cycle tests in Na2S/Na2SO3 solution, the photocatalytic activity of ZCIS-50 shows no obvious attenuation, indicating its excellent stability. In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of ZCIS-50 at different wavelengths was measured in 0.25 M Na2SO3 and 0.35 M Na2S solution (Fig. S5†). The AQE of H2 release can reach 18.73% under the 420 nm monochromatic light irradiation. The AQE of ZCIS-50 decreases with the increase of incident light wavelength, and the changing trend identifies with the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum. It indicates that the visible light absorption characteristics of photocatalysts play a significant role in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

To investigate the migration and separation efficiency of photo-induced carriers, the transient photocurrent responses of pure ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 samples with different molar ratios were measured. Fig. 6a displays the photocurrent–time curves of different samples with the light source on and off. ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 samples exhibit a stronger photocurrent response than the original ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4. In addition, ZCIS-50 has the highest photocurrent intensity, which indicates that the formation of the heterojunction between ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 is conducive to the migration and separation of photo-induced electrons and holes.61 Similar results were also observed in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 6b). Generally, the smaller arc radius in the Nyquist diagram reflects higher charge transfer efficiency and lower interfacial resistance. The arc radius of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nanocomposite is smaller than that of the original ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4. The result indicates that the formation of the heterojunction is beneficial to reduce the resistance of the interfacial charge transfer. Meanwhile, the arc radius of ZCIS-50 is the smallest, manifesting that it has the best transfer process of photogenerated carriers. PEC results display that the formation of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 heterostructure inhibits the recombination of photogenerated carriers, reduces the resistance of interface reaction and accelerates interfacial charge transfer.48,62 For understanding the electron transfer process of the catalyst more concretely, the photoelectrochemical properties of ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4, ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 were studied in 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to measure the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of different samples, which depends on the overpotential. A smaller overpotential value of the catalyst may indicate that the hydrogen evolution process is easier. The polarization curve in Fig. S6† shows that the current density of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nanocomposites is obviously higher than that of pure ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 at the same potential. At the same time, when the current density is 10 mA cm−2, the hydrogen evolution overpotential of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nanocomposites is significantly lower than that of pure ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4. This may be as a result of the rapid migration of electrons to the active sites (sulfur vacancies) at the interface of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 to reduce H2O molecules, thereby significantly improving the activity of photocatalytic HER activity.

(c) Steady-state PL spectra of different samples. (d) TRPL spectra of ZnIn2S4, ZCIS-50 and CdIn2S4. 
For gaining a deeper understanding of the possible reasons for improving photocatalytic performance, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 6c, on account of the high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, pure CdIn2S4 exhibits a strong emission peak at about 549 nm. Compared with pure ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 samples, the PL intensity of the ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composite decreased obviously, and the lowest PL intensity was observed in ZCIS-50, indicating that the electron–hole recombination in heterostructure materials is greatly inhibited. This can be ascribed to the strong interaction and the close interface contact between ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4, which promote interfacial charge transfer. In addition, the existence of surface sulfur vacancies can further raise the separation efficiency of photo-induced carriers by trapping electrons. The measurement of the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) attenuation spectrum also supports this conclusion (Fig. 6d). Based on the double exponential kinetic function fitting spectrum, the average emission lifetime (τA) can be calculated as follows:  where A1 and A2 are the corresponding amplitudes, τ1 and τ2 represent the fluorescence lifetime. Generally, the shorter is the average life, the better the charge separation effect is.22,63 All double exponential fitting results are summarized in Table S3.† The average PL lifetimes (τA) of CdIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4 are 10.96 ns and 5.37 ns, respectively. When the two are combined, the average PL life of ZCIS-50 is shortened to 1.97 ns. The obvious quenching of PL and the decrease of lifetime indicate that the electron transfer pathway from ZnIn2S4 to CdIn2S4 forms a non-radiation quenching mode, which also illustrates the rapid separation and migration of charges in heterojunction photocatalysts. The non-radiative transmission rate (kent) can be calculated according to the following formula:  τ1 and τ2 are short life and long life, respectively. The calculation results show that the energy transfer rate of ZCIS-50 is 5.80 times that of pure ZnIn2S4. In addition, the electron transfer rate (ket) is estimated by the following expression:  where τZCIS-50 and τZIS represent the average PL life of ZCIS-50 and ZnIn2S4, respectively.53,64 The interfacial electron transfer rate of ZISCN-50 was calculated as 0.32 ns−1. The charge carrier dynamics results of these photocatalysts are consistent with the performance of the above-mentioned photocatalytic HER, indicating that the tight heterostructure shortens the charge diffusion distance and effectively reduces the interfacial charge transfer resistance.
Moreover, SPV spectra of pure ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 are shown in Fig. S7,† which is known as a robust tool to investigate the process of photogenerated charge carriers' separation and transfer on the surface and interface. An obviously enhanced and positive SPV response within the range of 300–600 nm can be observed for the ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 heterostructure, demonstrating an accelerated photocarrier separation efficiency. This indicates that the photo-excited charge carriers are more easily separated and transferred to the surface on ZCIS-50. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was performed to survey the signal intensity of photoexcited superoxide radical (˙O2−; Fig. S8a†) and hole (h+; Fig. S8b†). In contrast to the pristine ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4, ZCIS-50 shows higher DMPO ˙O2− signal (DMPO: 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) and lower TEMPO h+ signal (TEMPO: 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxy) under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation for 10 min, corresponding to the photoexcited ˙O2− and h+ species, respectively, further demonstrating enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZCIS-50. Since photoexcited ˙O2− is generated from the separated photoexcited electron, the enhancement of photoexcited ˙O2− and h+ sufficiently proves that ZCIS-50 possesses a stronger ability to separate photoexcited electron–hole pairs, thus boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance.
For the sake of investigating the transfer mechanism of holes (h+) and electrons (e−) between ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4, the band edge positions of the valence band (VB) of the two semiconductors were measured by XPS valence band (VB) spectroscopy (Fig. 7a and b).65,66 The valence band potentials (EVB) of ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 are 1.67 V and 1.53 V (versus the normal hydrogen electrode, NHE), respectively. Combining the results of the bandgap energy (Eg) of ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4, on the basis of the formula ECB = EVB − Eg, the conduction band potential (ECB) is estimated to be −0.84 V and −0.71 V (vs. NHE) for ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4, respectively. A schematic diagram of the band structure for the two samples versus NHE is shown in Fig. 7c. Both ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 can be excited by visible light and generate electron–hole pairs. The ECB of ZnIn2S4 is more negative than that of CdIn2S4. Therefore, light-induced electron migration from the CB of ZnIn2S4 to the CB of CdIn2S4 is thermodynamically advantageous. At the same time, surface sulfur vacancies can capture electrons to inhibit their recombination with holes. After that, H+ will be reduced to hydrogen by photoelectrons, and the holes are trapped by the sacrificial reagent SO32−/S2−, thus preventing the recombination of charge. The appropriate band structure between ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 promotes the separation of light-induced holes and electrons, thus facilitating the release of photocatalytic H2.

In order to understand the charge transfer behavior at the interface of heterojunction in-depth, a DFT study was carried out. As shown in Fig. S9a,† when combined CdIn2S4 with ZnIn2S4, at the interface of the two crystals, Cd atoms of CdIn2S4 extruded from the top surface of the crystal, which contact with sulphur atoms located on the surface of ZnIn2S4 to form Cd–S bond (3.05 Å). This bond plays the role of channels for charge transfer between two semiconductors. Besides, as shown in Fig. S8b,† the partial DOS of the S atom located at the interface of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composite exhibits a clear decrease at the valence band maximum (VBM) with respect to that of the S atom located at the top layer of ZnIn2S4, revealing the partial electrons of S 2p transfer to the Cd atom. Meanwhile, partial DOS of the S atom (Fig. S9b†) spread indicates that the delocalization of the S atom strengthens and the Cd–S bond forms at the interface. Compared with pure CdIn2S4 crystal, partial DOS of the Cd atom at the interface have an obvious change (Fig. S9c†). The shrinkage of the band gap between CB and VB and the increase in density of state indicate that the Cd–S bond accelerates charge transfer at the interface and gives rise to more carriers that participate in the catalytic reaction. Furthermore, compared to pure ZnIn2S4, partial DOS of Zn at the interface also has changed (Fig. S9d†). The degree of delocalization of orbits (p and d) strengthen indicate the formation of delocalization around the Zn–S–Cd bridge bond at the interface. A clear decrease of the partial DOS of the Zn atom at VBM reveals that the partial electrons of Zn transfer to the Cd atom via the Zn–S–Cd bridge bond. These simulation results are consistent with the results observed from the XPS analysis. H adsorption-free energy on each catalyst was also calculated (Fig. S9e†). The calculation results showed that H adsorption-free energy on ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 composite is obviously lower than that on ZnIn2S4 (001) and CdIn2S4 (001), indicating that the surface of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 composite is much beneficial to H2 formation, thus boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance.
To further determine the stability of the sample, SEM, TEM, XPS and XRD of the ZCIS-50 sample before and after five photocatalytic cycles were compared. Both SEM and TEM images (Fig. S10†) proved that the micro-morphology of ZCIS-50 remained good after the cyclic reaction. The photocatalyst separated from the photocatalytic system was analyzed using XPS. As shown in Fig. S9,† the core energy-level spectra of high-resolution Zn 2p, Cd 3d, In 3d and S 2p are almost the same as the fresh samples. In addition, the XRD pattern after the recovery test shows that the crystal structure of the sample has no obvious change after the cyclic reaction (Fig. S11f†). The above results indicate that ZCIS-50 nano-composite material has excellent photocatalytic stability during the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production.
Conclusions
To sum up, ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-heterostructure photo-catalysts with different molar ratios were successfully prepared by a one-step solvothermal method. The obtained catalyst was constructed by CdIn2S4 nano-octahedron and ZnIn2S4 nanosheets via a close interface, which shortens the length of charge diffusion and migration. XPS analysis further verifies that the strong interaction between ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 promotes interfacial charge transfer. ESR results show that there are sulfur vacancies on the surface of the composite, which prolong the lifetime of photogenerated carriers by capturing photogenerated electrons and provide abundant active sites for surface redox reactions. In addition, the steady-state and time-resolved transient photoluminescence spectrum indicate that the recombination of photogenerated carriers in the composite is significantly inhibited, thereby enhancing overall photocatalytic activity. Therefore, compared with pure ZnIn2S4, CdIn2S4 and other related heterostructure systems, the photocatalytic hydrogen release performance of ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 nano-composites is significantly improved under visible light. It also has good stability in the long-term photocatalytic test of Na2S/Na2SO3 solution. We expect that this work can provide guidance for the interface design of in situ semiconductor heterojunction photocatalysts and provide a promising strategy for the progress of high-efficiency photocatalytic water decomposition catalysts.
