Herein, two-dimensional hierarchically porous anatase TiO2 with specific surface area of 486 m2 g−1, is fabricated through acetic acid etching, which facilitates the crystal phase transition of amorphous TiO2. The pore sizes are within the ranges of 2–6 nm and 15–80 nm, and the pore diameters are 3.5 nm and 45 nm. As the anode materials for lithium ion batteries, the initial discharge capacity of hierarchically porous anatase TiO2 reaches to 449 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1 and retains 191 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles. In particular, the discharge capacities of 42 and 35 mA h g−1 can be resumed after 750 cycles at the current rates of 1 and 5 A g−1, respectively, exhibiting high electrochemical stability and high reversible capacity. Further research reveals that the fabrication of hierarchically porous anatase TiO2 depends on the amounts of HAc added, and the pH of the solution.
1. Introduction
Hierarchically porous materials with high specific surface areas have many excellent properties in catalysis, separation, energy conversion and storage.1,2 One reason is that larger pores can facilitate rapid reactant transport, while smaller pores can provide higher specific surface areas for reactant adsorption/desorption, and more reaction sites.3 For example, in lithium ion batteries (LIBs), hierarchically porous materials can improve lithium ion transport in the electrode, facilitate charge transport across the electrolyte/electrode interface, and reduce the transport path lengths of lithium ion diffusion, leading to excellent capacity and cycling performance.4,5 The other reason is that the high specific surface areas of materials can also enhance their adsorption capability, generate many more active sites (such as oxygen vacancies)6 and provide a large interface for any type of reaction.7,8
TiO2 nanoparticles have many significant advantages in LIBs,9,10 such as small volume expansion (<4%), high charge/discharge current rates,11 high thermal and chemical stability,12,13 eliminating the influence of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer,14 etc. Unfortunately, the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles during the charge–discharge process is a serious challenge in practical application.15 To address this issue, one of the protocols is purposely designing the nano/micro hierarchical structures.16–18 So far, many TiO2 hierarchical microstructures have been prepared by various methods,19 such as the hydrothermal/solvothermal method,20,21 templates method, and the hydrolysis of precursors,5,22,23 etc. However, there are very few reports about the hierarchically porous anatase TiO2 (TiO2-HNPs), and to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the acid-etched synthesis of TiO2-HNPs, until now.
Anatase TiO2 shows a high rate capability and good cycle stability because it provides fast lithium-ion insertion/extraction pathways along the a and b axes;24 as such, anatase TiO2 shows a more excellent electrochemical performance than the anatase/rutile TiO2 and the amorphous TiO2.25 For anatase TiO2, it is easy to obtain specific surface areas of less than 250 m2 g−1,22,26 whereas for amorphous TiO2, values of 543 m2 g−1 are obtained.27,28 Unfortunately, for the amorphous TiO2, the poor electrical conductivity is disadvantageous when it serves as the substrate29,30 or the electrode material.25,31,32 The achievement of perfectly crystallized TiO2 usually conflicts with the achievement of high specific surface areas.33 For example, in order to improve the crystallinity of TiO2, an annealing step with temperature higher than 300 °C is usually used.34 However, the annealing step can, in most cases, lead to a collapse of the pore system and an increase in the particle size, along with a decrease in the specific surface area; therefore, this strategy is not suitable for synthesizing the high specific surface area materials.7 Until now, very few groups have reported anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with specific surface areas above 250 m2 g−1, or porosity, based on an aqueous-processed approach,35,36 which suggests that the synthesis of anatase TiO2 with high specific surface areas is still a difficult challenge.37
In this work, we demonstrate a simple but efficient acetic acid etching process to fabricate TiO2-HNPs with specific surface area of 486 m2 g−1. Unlike previous approaches mentioned above, which mainly involve calcination processes,7 our strategy is based on a fast etching and crystal transformation process from amorphous to anatase TiO2 in solution, through acetic acid (HAc) regulation. Apart from the high specific surface areas, TiO2-HNPs also possess two-dimensional, hierarchically porous structures, and nanoparticles of 4–9 nm. They showed excellent electrochemical stability and reversible capacity, even in high-rate charge–discharge processes, which suggests that TiO2-HNPs are favourable for improving the lithium storage properties of TiO2.
2. Experimental section
2.1 The synthesis of TiO2-HNPs
In a typical procedure, 15 mL of tetrabutyl titanate (TBT, Aladdin Industrial Corporation) were added to 100 mL of ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.) under vigorous magnetic stirring for 30 min. The solution was then heated at 164 °C for 2 hours to form the white precursor, and allowed stand for over 4 h; the white precipitate (TiO2-A) was deposited at the bottom of the flask. Subsequently, about 50 mL of the supernatant fluid was removed and 1 mL HAc (CH3COOH, Chemical Reagent Company of Tianjin) solution (3 M) was added to the flask. The flask was then reheated at 107 °C for 2 h under vigorous magnetic stirring. After cooling down to room temperature, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times, then dried at 100 °C for 10 h. The as-obtained sample was denoted as TiO2-P.
The TiO2-P (2 g) was added to deionized water (about 200 mL) in the photochemical reactor and sonicated for 30 min, then subjected to ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation for 2 h, and was left open to air. The product was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol three times, respectively, and dried at 100 °C for 10 h, and the TiO2-HNPs were obtained.
2.2 Photochemical reactor
The photochemical reactor used in the present study consisted of a quartz cylindrical cell surrounded by a water-cooled jacket, which was illuminated by an internal light source with about 1 cm optical path length. The UV light source was a 500 W high-pressure mercury lamp (main output 365 nm).
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were performed using coin-type half cells (2016-type). The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the as-prepared samples, carbon black (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder (70:20:10 by weight) in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) to form a slurry. The obtained slurry was then coated onto copper foil using a doctor blade, and dried at 120 °C for 12 h. Lithium metal foil was used as a counter electrode. The cell was assembled in an argon-filled glove box. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 v/v). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 at room temperature. The impedance spectra were also recorded on the CHI660D electrochemical workstation, by applying a sine wave with amplitude of 5.0 mV over the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were carried out on a LAND CT2001A battery-testing instrument at various current rates in the potential range of 1.0 to 3.0 V.
2.4 Structural characterization
A Bruker advance-D8 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) was used to characterize the crystal structures of TiO2-HNPs. A JEOL JSM-6390LV scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM), were used to investigate the microstructures and morphologies of TiO2-HNPs. The chemical state of TiO2-HNPs was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a VG Scientific ESCALABMKLL spectrometer using an Al Kα X-ray source (10 mA, 15 kV). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution of TiO2-HNPs were determined by nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements of TiO2-HNPs were performed on a STA449C Analyzer (NETZSCH, Germany) with a heating rate of 2.4 °C min−1 under the flow of air. Fourier transform infrared spectrographs (FT-IR) of samples were recorded on a Bio-Rad FTS-40 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 4000–400 cm−1. The dried samples were mixed with KBr for all FT-IR measurements.
3. Results and discussion
The TiO2-HNPs were synthesized by a facile solution chemistry method. As depicted in Scheme 1, TBT and EG were mixed together and formed amorphous TiO2 (TiO2-A); the TiO2-A particles were large and aggregated easily, and were etched by HAc, and formed anatase TiO2 (TiO2-P) nanoparticles with good dispersion. In this process, the crystal phase of TiO2 was transformed from amorphous to anatase because of the reduction of the organic residue of TiO2-A, which also resulted in a decrease in the size of TiO2-P. The mesoporous nanoparticles were obtained in the area from which the organic residue was removed, and a few of the aggregations of mesoporous TiO2-P nanoparticles formed hierarchically porous structures. Under UV irradiation, the organic residue was further reduced, and more mesoporous nanoparticles were obtained, so that the specific surface area of TiO2 was further increased. The hierarchically porous structures were obtained through mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles linking to each other.

As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD pattern of TiO2-A (Fig. 1a) exhibits the broader and lower intensity of the diffraction peaks, indicating the poorly crystalline nature of the TiO2 compound. For TiO2-P (Fig. 1b) and TiO2-HNPs (Fig. 1c), all of the strong diffraction peaks were indexed to the anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272), which suggests that the TiO2-A is in the amorphous phase, and the HAc can facilitate the crystal phase transition of TiO2 from amorphous (Fig. 1a) to anatase phase (Fig. 1b). The average grain sizes of the TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs were calculated along the (101) plane using the Scherrer formula to be about 7 nm.

The FESEM image of TiO2-HNPs is shown in Fig. 2a, in which TiO2-HNPs appear as irregularly shaped blocks with sizes ranging from 1 to 5 μm. With increasing the magnification, it can be seen that the irregular block is composed of nanoparticles and mesopores (Fig. 2b). The sizes of the nanoparticles range from 40 to 70 nm. The representative TEM image of the TiO2-HNPs are shown in Fig. 2c, in which TiO2-HNPs appear as irregular shaped nanoparticles of about 50 nm. The high-resolution TEM image (HRTEM) shows that TiO2-HNPs are composed of many smaller nanoparticles (secondary nanoparticles), the sizes of the secondary nanoparticles are 4–9 nm, and there are many mesoporous particles of 3–5 nm in TiO2-HNPs (the representative mesopores are indicated by the red arrow). The typical lattice fringe spacing of TiO2-HNPs of 0.24 nm is shown in Fig. 2d, and can be assigned to the (004) crystal plane of anatase TiO2. The ring patterns of the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (insets of Fig. 2c) also confirm that TiO2-HNPs are in the anatase phase, corresponding to the XRD pattern of TiO2-HNPs (Fig. 1c).

The hierarchically porous structures of TiO2 were confirmed by a nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiment. As shown in Fig. 3a, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of TiO2-A (black) show a type I isotherm, but the TiO2-P (red) and TiO2-HNPs (blue) show the type IV isotherm.38 This means that TiO2-A could contain many microporous nanoparticles, since the TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs show characteristics of mesoporous materials. Their pore size distributions are shown in Fig. 3b. For the TiO2-A (black), there is no hierarchically porous structure. For TiO2-P (red) and TiO2-HNPs (blue), however, they all contain two regions of pore size distribution, indicating that TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs have two-dimensional hierarchically porous structures, ranging from 2 to 6 nm, and 15 to 80 nm, respectively. The mesopores of the TiO2-HNPs are more obvious than those of TiO2-P, with pore diameters of 3.4 nm and 45 nm, respectively. This means that TiO2-HNPs are not only mesoporous, but also have a two-dimensional hierarchically porous structure. For the TiO2-A, TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs, their specific surface areas, pore volumes, and average pore sizes are listed in Table 1, according to the nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiment.

As can be seen from Table 1, the specific surface areas of as-prepared TiO2 gradually increase from TiO2-A to TiO2-HNPs. Moreover, the TiO2-HNPs exhibit higher specific surface area and pore volume, compared to the previous reports.22,39,40
Fig. 4 shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of as-prepared TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs under a flow of air. For the TiO2-P (Fig. 4a) and TiO2-HNPs (Fig. 4b), they both have a two-step pattern for weight loss in the temperature range of 20 to 250 °C and 250 to 600 °C, respectively. The weight loss of 7.5% (TiO2-P) and 10% (TiO2-HNPs) at the first stage of 20–250 °C may be attributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water molecules and EG molecules on the surface of the particles.41,42 In the range of 250–600 °C, the weight loss 20% (TiO2-P) and 6% (TiO2-HNPs) may mainly be associated with the removal of chemically bonded EG molecules and the degradation of organic groups (butoxy groups originating from EG).42,43 It is well known that more organic residue is not advantageous for electrical conductivity. The results indicate that some organic matter can be removed by UV irradiation, and the amount of organic residue can be reduced to about 6 wt%. This means that the weight percent of active material is 72.5% and 84% for TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs, respectively.

The chemical composition and surface state of TiO2-HNPs were investigated by XPS. The survey spectrum of TiO2-HNPs is shown in Fig. 5a; peaks of Ti, O, and C can be clearly observed, and there are no peaks for other elements. The high resolution XPS spectra of Ti, O, and C elements are shown in Fig. 5b–d, respectively. In Fig. 5b, there are two peaks located at 465.0 and 459.3 eV, with a peak separation of 5.7 eV, indicating the Ti4+ oxidation state.44,45 The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 5c) consists of three peaks that correspond to Ti–O, C–O, and O–H with binding energies of 530.7, 531.2, and 532.9 eV,46 respectively. Similarly, the high-resolution C 1s XPS curve (Fig. 5d) can be resolved into three peaks at 285.3, 286.4, and 289.7 eV, which are assigned to the C–C, C–O, and OC groups, respectively,47 possibly originating from the butoxy residue of TBT.

The FT-IR spectra of the as-prepared TiO2-A, TiO2-P, and TiO2-HNPs are shown in Fig. 6. For all the samples, the strong absorption bands at ∼3387 cm−1 and ∼1632 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching and bending vibrations of the –OH groups of absorbed water molecules.14 The absorption band in the 2972–2865 cm−1 range is due to C–H stretching.48 The absorption band at ∼1049 cm−1 corresponds to the C–O stretching vibration, and the wide peaks at 400–900 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of the Ti–O–Ti bonds in crystalline TiO2.49 However, for TiO2-P (Fig. 6b), the emergence of asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylic group centered at 1717 cm−1 (weak), 1540, and 1441 cm−1 indicate the formation of a titanium-containing complex.50 This reveals that the organic residues of amorphous TiO2 include the carboxylic group, which comes from HAc. However, after UV irradiation, the absorption bands of the carboxylic group disappear, which also suggests that the HAc could play an important role in forming TiO2-HNPs.

Therefore, we speculate that the crystallinity of TiO2 could be deeply affected by the organic residues of amorphous TiO2, and the crystallinity of TiO2 could be improved through removing these organic residues. Because there are no other substances in the first reaction (TiO2-A) except TBT and EG, the reaction equations can be formulated as follows:51 
Ti(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4 + 2HOCH2CH2OH → Ti((OCH2)2)2 + 4CH3CH2CH2CH2OH
(1)
Unfortunately, the resultant Ti((OCH2)2)2 (TG) is quite stable and can remain for a long period of time.51 A suitable method is needed for decomposing the TG unit of amorphous TiO2, such as microwave heating,51 light-induced,40 hydrothermal52 or heating hydrolysis treatment,22 etc. These methods can reduce a limited number of organic residues, so that the annealing step is necessary for their further application. In this work, when the HAc is introduced, the hydrolysis reaction of TG can be formulated as follows:40,51 
Ti((OCH2)2)2 + 4H+ + 4CH3COO− → Ti(OH)4 + 2CH3COOCH2CH2OOCCH3
(2) 
CH3COOCH2CH2OOCCH3 + 2H2O → HOCH2CH2OH + 2CH3COO− + 2H+
(3) 
Ti(OH)4 → TiO2↓ + 2H2O (ref. 40 and 51)
(4)
The vibrational signals (1700 cm−1) of the carboxylic group are very weak in the FT-IR spectra of TiO2-P (Fig. 6b), which suggests that eqn (3) is a very fast reaction, so that there are very few CH3COO− groups in TiO2-P; therefore, this process could be depicted by Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Schematic of the possible process for the formation of nanosized hierarchical particles of mesoporous anatase TiO2. 
In this process, the –CH2CH2– unit of TG is cut off by H+ and CH3COO−, so that the crystallinity of TiO2 could be improved. Meanwhile, a pore is formed at the site of the –CH2CH2– unit. This means that the H+ ion could play a catalytic role in the hydrolysis of TG (eqn (2) and (3)), and the amount of H+ ions could be important to forming anatase TiO2. According to this view, the crystallinity of TiO2 could be explained by the amount of H+ ions. More Ti–O–C bonds break and form Ti–O–H when there is a sufficient amount of H+ ions. The result is that Ti(OH)4 is obtained and further forms anatase TiO2 (eqn (4)). When there is not a sufficient amount of H+ ions, one Ti atom cannot form four Ti–O–H bonds, and the crystallization of amorphous TiO2 is not perfect.
The change in morphology can further confirm that HAc plays an important etching role in forming the mesoporous structure. As shown in Fig. 8, the sizes of the TiO2-A particles are greater than 100 nm and aggregate easily (Fig. 8a and b). The size range of TiO2-P is from 20 to 70 nm (Fig. 8c and d), and suggests that the volume of particles is reduced with the transition from the amorphous (TiO2-A) to anatase (TiO2-P). This results from the hydrolysis reaction of TG, because TiO2-A contains organic residues (–CH2CH2– unit), and the volume of TiO2-A is larger before the hydrolysis reaction. The extra space will form mesopores in the surface of TiO2-P when the –CH2CH2– units are removed in the hydrolysis reaction. In this case, the volume of TiO2-P decreases because of the aggregation of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The final result is that TiO2-A is etched and generates mesopores, so that the volume of TiO2-P is smaller than the TiO2-A.

The formation mechanisms of the anatase phase and hierarchically porous structures were also explored through a control experiment, where H2SO4 was added, rather than HAc. When the H2SO4 was used as the source of H+ ions, it could also facilitate the phase transition of TiO2 from amorphous to anatase. As shown in Fig. 9a, the anatase TiO2 can also be obtained when 1 mL of 98% H2SO4 is added to the reaction system. Moreover, the crystallinity of anatase TiO2 is improved with increasing the amount of H2SO4 (Fig. 9a, from 0.1 mL to 1 mL). However, this is unfavorable for obtaining the high specific surface areas of TiO2, because the specific surface areas of TiO2 gradually decrease with increasing the amount of H2SO4 (Fig. 9b), which means that this reaction system needs an appropriate pH value.

(c) The XRD patterns of the as-prepared TiO2 sample in the presence of different amounts of 3 M HAc. (d) The relation curve between the specific surface areas and the amount of 3 M HAc. 
In this work, the anatase TiO2 was formed when the pH value of the reaction system was about 3.3 (Fig. 9d), otherwise the as-prepared sample was amorphous TiO2, or imperfect crystallization of TiO2 occurred (Fig. 9c, 0.5 and 0.75 mL). Hence, pH = 3.3 is an appropriate pH value for obtaining excellent crystallinity and large specific surface area of TiO2 in this reaction system. However, under the action of H2SO4, the dispersity of TiO2 nanoparticles was good (e.g. Fig. 10a–c), and only mesoporous TiO2 was obtained, instead of the two-dimensional hierarchically porous TiO2 (Fig. 10d). This means that the CH3COO− plays an important role in forming two-dimensional hierarchically porous TiO2.

The lithium storage performances of TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs were evaluated based on their electrochemical performances in LIBs. As shown in Fig. 11a, the representative cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the TiO2-HNPs have two pronounced current peaks at 1.67 V (cathodic sweep) and 1.99 V (anodic sweep) for the first cycle at room temperature. The interval spacing between the cathodic/anodic peaks are about the 0.32 V, which is much lower than 0.49 V in the previous report.53 This indicates that the lithium insertion reaction of TiO2-HNPs occurs more easily,53,54 because the peak separation is determined by the overpotential required for the transformation between TiO2 and LixTiO2.54 The pairs of cathodic/anodic peaks were about 1.72 V/2.01 V and 1.69 V/2.03 V in the subsequent scans. The ratio of anodic to cathodic peak currents was nearly 1, demonstrating that this redox system remained in equilibrium throughout the potential scan, and Li+ intercalates and deintercalates reversibly.53,55

(d) Cycling performance of TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs at various charge–discharge rates. (e) Cycling performance of TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs at the different current rates. All the measurements were conducted using a voltage window of 1.0–3.0 V. 
The charge–discharge voltage profiles of TiO2-HNPs electrodes at the different current densities are shown in Fig. 11b. There are two voltage plateaus at about 1.7 and 2.0 V during the discharge and charge processes, respectively. The results are generally consistent with the above CV analysis. As shown in Fig. 11b, the initial discharge of TiO2-HNPs is 449 mA h g−1 and the subsequent charge capacity is 244 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, which corresponds to 1.3 Li inserted per formula unit of TiO2 and about 0.7 Li extracted, leading to a coulombic efficiency of 54%. The TiO2-HNPs electrode presented a similar coulombic efficiency at the other current densities, owing to the hierarchically porous structure of TiO2-HNPs and the formation of a Li2Ti2O4 phase.56,57 The Li2Ti2O4 crystals prefer to further facilitate the Li+ insertion/deinsertion capability of the TiO2-HNPs electrode, leading to the excellent capacity retention and superior rate performance.58
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to further understand the lithium storage performances of the as-prepared TiO2 samples. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 11c, and were collected from 100 kHz to 10 MHz. The Nyquist plots were fitted with the typical circuit model59–61 (inset of Fig. 11c), and the resistance parameters are listed in Table 2. The transfer resistances (Rct) of TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs electrodes were 8.7 and 25.7 ohm, respectively, suggesting that the electron transference for TiO2-P occurs prior to that of TiO2-HNPs.62 This may be ascribed to the fact that the disperse nanoparticles of TiO2-P can improve the amount of contact area between TiO2 and the conductive carbon additive, and enhance electrolyte transport and lithium ion diffusion.63 However, the amount of organic residue in TiO2-P is more than in TiO2-HNPs (Fig. 4), so that the electron transfer resistance (RSEI)59,61 is larger than in TiO2-HNPs.

As shown in Fig. 11d, the TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs display good capacity retention at different current densities. The initial discharge capacities of TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs were 332 and 449 mA h g−1, respectively, at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. With increasing the current densities to 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, the discharge capacities of TiO2-P were 115, 80, 51 and 25 mA h g−1, respectively, and for TiO2-HNPs, they were 160, 135, 113, and 87 mA h g−1, respectively. As the current densities were brought back to 0.1 A g−1, the discharge capacities of TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs were increased to 140 and 191 mA h g−1, respectively. Their long-term cycling capacities at the different current densities are shown in Fig. 11e; the initial discharge capacity of TiO2-HNPs was 364 mA h g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, and a reversible capacity of 68 mA h g−1 was retained after 400 cycles. The initial discharge capacities of TiO2-HNPs were 312 and 212 mA h g−1 at the current density of 1 and 5 A g−1, respectively, and the reversible capacities of 65 and 50 mA h g−1 were retained after 400 cycles. The TiO2-P electrodes had initial discharge capacities of 138 and 116 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 1 and 5 A g−1, respectively, and the reversible capacities of 22 and 15 mA h g−1 were retained after 400 cycles.
After completing 60 cycles, when the rate returned to 0.1 A g−1, the capacity of 191 mA h g−1 was resumed (Fig. 11c), which corresponds to 0.57 lithium inserted per formula unit of TiO2. According to the Li-insertion mechanism for the nanoporous TiO2 (anatase) structure with a high surface area,22 TiO2-HNPs should be the dominant means of interfacial storage. In comparison to the reported values of TiO2-based electrodes,22,37,39,64 the TiO2-HNPs exhibit high discharge capacity and electrochemical stability.
To understand the Li+ storage properties and the stability of this structure, the evolution of the morphology and structure of TiO2-P and TiO2-HNPs during the charge–discharge processes were further investigated. The SEM and TEM images of TiO2-P electrodes after 800 cycles are shown in Fig. 12a–d. The SEM image of TiO2-P (Fig. 12a) shows that TiO2-P electrodes appear as a collapsed structure after 800 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The TEM images (Fig. 12b–d) further verify that the collapsed structure comes from the aggregation of nanoparticles. However, the mesopores of the nanoparticles were not damaged in this process (Fig. 12c and d). The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 12e–h, show that the TiO2-HNPs electrode is stable after 800 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. There was no significant change in the size and mesoporous structure of TiO2-HNPs after long cycling.

The excellent electrochemical performance of TiO2-HNPs results from its hierarchically porous structure, anatase phase and high specific surface area. The hierarchically porous structure can improve lithium ion transport, facilitate charge transport across the electrolyte/electrode interface, and reduce the transport path lengths for ion diffusion within the hierarchically porous structure, leading to excellent capacity and long cycle lifetimes.4,5 The high specific surface area of the materials can guarantee good accessibility and contact with the electrolyte in the LIBs, and the anatase TiO2 can also enhance the conductivity and achieve a better power conversion efficiency (PCE).65
4. Conclusions
In summary, we developed a facile, solution route for fabricating the novel hierarchically porous anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. TiO2-HNPs not only have high specific surface areas, but also hierarchically porous structures, and present a high initial discharge capacity of 449 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and retain 185 mA h g−1, even after 70 cycles. Herein, we only demonstrated their electrochemical performance. TiO2-HNPs have high specific surface areas and hierarchical pore structures, which can enhance their adsorption capability, generate much more active sites, and provide a large interface for any type of reaction. This suggests that TiO2-HNPs should also have excellent photocatalytic activity. Therefore, TiO2-HNPs might be an attractive material and ideal candidate for manifold TiO2 applications, such as electrode materials in solar cells, photocatalysts and heterogeneous catalyst substrates, in biomedical engineering,66 etc.
