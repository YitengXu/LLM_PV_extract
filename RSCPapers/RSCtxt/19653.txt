    , Accepted 25th April 2019First published on 3rd May 2019AbstractWhile there has been rapid progress in the performance of perovskite solar cells, the details of film formation, effect of processing parameters and perovskite crystal structure are still under discussion. The details of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite existing at room temperature are often overlooked, with unresolved (002) (at 2θ = 13.99° for CuKα and q = 0.9927 Å−1) and (110) (at 2θ = 14.14° and q = 1.003 Å−1) peaks considered to be one peak at 14°, leading to an inaccurate estimation of lattice parameters. In this study, we use an electrospray deposition technique to prepare perovskite films at room temperature, oriented in (002) and (110) directions, with (002) as the preferred orientation. The results of a detailed study on the emergence of the two orientations during perovskite formation are reported. The effect of process parameters, such as substrate temperature during deposition and annealing temperature, on the grain orientation was established using XRD and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The study suggests that an irreversible crystal reorientation from (002) to (110) occurs at high temperature during rapid annealing, whereas a reversible crystal thermal expansion is seen during slow annealing. Finally, the results of the grain reorientation are correlated with the film properties, and it is shown that the film with the dominant (110) orientation has improved morphology and optoelectronic properties. The detailed structural investigation and characterization presented in this study are important for the precise determination of crystal orientation and achievement of desirable photovoltaic properties of the absorber material by carefully observing the adjacent crystal plane peaks in the XRD pattern of the perovskite thin films.
Introduction
In a few years' span, active research on organometallic halide perovskite solar cells has yielded the highest certified power conversion efficiency of 23.3%.1 The prototypical and most studied halide perovskite is methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, abbreviated to MAPbI3) because of its easy and low-temperature fabrication, wide absorption range (band gap = 1.55 eV), high defect tolerance, and excellent electronic properties. A variety of techniques have been reported to deposit perovskite films, broadly categorized as dip coating,2 spin-coating,3,4 ink-jet printing,5 spray deposition,6–9 and vapor-based deposition,10 with the solution-based techniques being easy to perform and requiring low energy input. Commonly, most of the techniques necessitate annealing treatment (temperature between 80 and 150 °C) of the perovskite film after deposition to ensure complete evaporation of the solvent and crystallization of the perovskite material. Previous studies had optimized annealing temperature and time, depending on the fabrication environment11–14 for complete formation of perovskite. Moreover, various other annealing procedures and environments, namely, solvent vapor annealing,15 air annealing,16 photonic flash-annealing,17 low-pressure vapor annealing,18 and gas blowing19 have been introduced to obtain uniform coverage of the film with a smooth surface and large grain size, necessary for superior device performance. Thermal annealing is also known to promote degradation of perovskite by inducing strain in the film during thermal expansion and contraction during annealing and cooling.20 Therefore, methods for annealing-free/room temperature formation of perovskite have also been demonstrated through (1) rapid anti-solvent crystallization21,22 or solvent–solvent extraction23 and (2) incorporation of an additive into the precursor solution.24,25 However, in some of these methods, post-annealing has shown further improvement in the film properties and device efficiency.21–23
The effect of annealing is primarily observed on perovskite crystallization and morphology of the film. The crystal structure and grain size are analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer, focusing on the relative change in intensity of the diffraction peaks of perovskite and lead iodide. However, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of perovskite has been overlooked, as in the peaks at 2θ = 13.99° and 14.14°, corresponding to (002) and (110) reflections,26,27 respectively, of the tetragonal perovskite phase (lattice dimension a = b = 8.849 Å, c = 12.642 Å), usually identified as one peak with (110) reflection, and the variation between these peaks with annealing has often been ignored. Similarly, other peaks are also not distinguished and identified; for instance, (004) and (220) peaks at 28.2° and 28.5° are classified as (220). Additionally, all three phases of MAPbI3 perovskite – orthogonal (existing at temperature T < −103 °C), tetragonal (−103 °C < T < 57 °C), and cubic (T > 57 °C) – have peaks that are very close.27–29 For example, (101) of the orthorhombic phase at 14.41°; (002)/(110) of the tetragonal phase at 13.99°/14.14°; and (001) of the cubic phase at 14.01°. This sometimes leads to a misinterpretation of the crystal structure. While this ambiguity in classifying the (002) and (110) peaks as one (110) peak occurs mainly due to poor instrument resolution (close reflections cannot be resolved), the wide range plots of the 2θ scan exacerbate this by the inability to distinguish the two adjacent peaks. However, such an approximation leads to inaccuracy in the calculation of the lattice parameters and determination of the crystal structure, and misguides in relating the structural characteristic to the film properties.
For a detailed understanding of the structure–property relationship of the perovskite film, it is very important to precisely classify the crystal structure and investigate its effect on the optoelectronic properties of the film. A few studies have elucidated the existence of these pairs of peaks ((002) & (110) and (004) & (220)) and their relative variation as a function of the process parameters.30–33 Docampo et al. discussed the dependency of the orientation of MAPbI3 on the temperature of methylammonium iodide (MAI) solution during dip coating on PbI2 substrates, and reported that the crystal orientation changes from (002) to (110) with an increase of temperature.32 A large portion of (110)-oriented crystals appears at higher temperatures as the (002)-oriented crystals disappear above a specific temperature. Additionally, an increase in short-circuit current for the (110)-oriented crystals was observed, probably resulting from the anisotropic electronic properties of the perovskite. Another study by Lilliu et al.33 focused on the importance of resolving the pair of close peaks in perovskite XRD patterns and their effect on power conversion efficiency. The authors used scanning nanofocus XRD in transmission geometry to probe the local variation in the orientation of individual grains and found the presence of both (002)- and (110)-oriented grains. The study also reports variation in the orientation as a function of substrate temperature during one-step spin coating of perovskite precursors. The perovskite grain size was found to increase with temperature (up to 90 °C) along with the presence of grains oriented in the [110] direction. A significant proportion of grains oriented in the [002] direction were still found in the film spun at 90 °C. Yet another study was able to resolve (004) and (220) peaks and found that the (004) orientation is preferred at high PbI2 to MAI flux through the vapor deposition of the perovskite.31 Therefore, it is vital to perform a detailed structural analysis of the perovskite, examine the emergence of the two close XRD peaks as a function of time during perovskite formation, and their variation with process parameters, which could be associated with the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite.
Previously, we have successfully demonstrated an electrospray deposition technique to fabricate a MAPbI3 perovskite layer for stable perovskite solar cells under ambient humidity (30–50% relative humidity).8 The method follows two steps: PbI2 is first deposited by spin coating, and then, MAI is electrosprayed on the PbI2 layer. In the electrospray process, charged MAI droplets are generated and directed towards the PbI2-coated substrate, connected to ground. The solvent evaporates before the arrival of droplets on the substrate, and charged MAI particles react with PbI2 and form perovskite film. The as-deposited, tetragonal-phase perovskite film consists of grains oriented in [002] and [110] directions with [002] as the preferred orientation. However, annealing the film reorients the grain in the [002] direction to the [110] direction and merges with grains oriented in the [110] direction. Therefore, this technique is useful to execute a detailed investigation of the presence of two orientations under different processing conditions, control the crystal structure, and inspect the effect of orientation on the properties of perovskite film.
In this work, we employ the electrospray technique to deposit perovskite layers and systematically investigate the occurrence of the different crystal orientations and their effect on film properties. First, we study the emergence of the two orientations during the perovskite formation at different temperatures. Second, the change in crystal orientation of the deposited perovskite film as a function of annealing temperature is determined. Third, we investigate the effect of annealing procedure (rapid and slow annealing) on the crystal orientation. Finally, we study the effect on the morphological, optical, and electronic properties of perovskite. These detailed structural investigations help deepen the general understanding of perovskite film growth as well as structure and temperature related stability issues.
Results and discussion
Crystal reorientation during annealing
A polycrystalline perovskite film was deposited in two steps: first, PbI2 was deposited using spin coating, then MAI using electrospray (Experimental details are provided in the ESI†). For electrospray deposition, a solution of MAI in IPA (14 mg ml−1) was pumped at a flow rate of 1 μL PM through a needle connected to a high voltage source. Monodisperse charged droplets containing MAI are generated in Taylor cone-jet mode, which then travel in the electric field towards the grounded PbI2-coated substrate. The charged MAI particles reach the substrate, react with PbI2 and form the perovskite. The dashed curve in Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of the as-deposited (before annealing) perovskite film, showing the tetragonal phase as manifested by splitting of the characteristic diffraction peaks; a major peak at 13.99° corresponding to the (002) plane and a minor peak/shoulder at 14.14°, corresponding to the (110) plane. The preferred orientation of grains at room temperature is with the [002] direction normal to the substrate surface because of the underlying mechanism of PbI2 to perovskite conversion. Similar to vapor phase formation of perovskite, in the electrospray-assisted fabrication, the formation occurs by diffusion–intercalation of MAI into the layered PbI2 structure, because MAI is supplied in the form of nanoparticles at a gradual rate, in contrast to the spin coating method where MAI solution is supplied in bulk and the reaction mechanism depends on the MAI concentration.34 Intercalation of MAI causes twisting of the corner sharing PbI6 octahedron in the layered structure of PbI2 and forms Pb–I bonds between the PbI2 layers, resulting in a 3D perovskite structure oriented along the [002] direction. Previous studies reported a strongly preferred orientation along the [002] direction, in the case of vapor reacted perovskite crystals, but of cubic phase because the reaction was performed at high temperature.35 However, in this study, the reaction occurs at room temperature, and therefore, the (002) peak seen is that of the tetragonal perovskite. Additionally, a clear splitting to two peaks at ∼14° confirms them as being (002) and (110) peaks of the tetragonal perovskite. The high index peaks of these families, (004) at 28.21° and (220) at 28.5°, are low in intensity but easy to distinguish because of the large 2θ difference between them. Fig. 1b shows the same XRD pattern as in Fig. 1a but zoomed in on the tiny PbI2 peak, coming from either some unreacted fraction or area on the substrate covered with a clamp during electrospraying MAI.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the electrosprayed perovskite film collected before (dashed curve) and after annealing (solid curve) at 100 °C for 5 min showing (a) perovskite peaks with a clear difference between (002) & (110) and (004) & (220) peaks and (b) PbI2 (001) peaks. Note that the y-axis in (b) is expanded 11 times to that of the y-axis in (a). 
After taking the XRD measurements, the films were annealed rapidly at 100 °C for 5 min. The solid curve in Fig. 1 is the XRD pattern of the same film after annealing and it shows that the (002) and (004) peaks disappear almost completely, while the (110) and (220) peaks are amplified. The change in the relative intensity of the perovskite peaks suggests that the grains oriented along the [002] direction change their orientation to [110] and merge with the grains oriented along the [110] direction, which also indicates that the grain size will increase after annealing (discussed in a later section). The PbI2 peak in Fig. 1b does not show any shift with annealing, which verifies that the change in the perovskite peaks does not arise from any measurement error. The complete XRD plots from 2θ = 5 to 40° of the same film before and after annealing are presented in Fig. S1a.† Similar changes in the intensity are also observed in other orientations of perovskite present in very small fractions, where (112) and (114) peaks diminish and their neighboring (200) and (222) peaks amplify respectively (ESI, Fig. S1b and c†).
It is important to further validate that the origin of the alteration in peak intensities is associated with the crystal reorientation (change in the population of the grains oriented in [002] and [110] directions) by considering other possibilities, such as (1) electrospraying excess MAI, and (2) perovskite phase transition. Electrospraying excess MAI may lead to the presence of excess MA+ and/or I− in the crystal structure, which then evaporates during annealing, resulting in crystal shrinkage and a rightward shift of the XRD peaks. To check this possibility, we fabricated other types of perovskites, such methylammonium lead iodide–bromide (MAPbI3−xBrx), methylammonium lead iodide–chloride (MAPbI3−xClx) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3). All three perovskites were fabricated by spin coating the PbI2 layer and electrospraying MABr, MACl and FAI using the same amount as when electrospraying MAI, to form MAPbI3−xBrx, MAPbI3−xClx, and FAPbI3, respectively. Electrospraying MABr on PbI2 forms a mixed iodide–bromide perovskite, MAPbI3−xBrx (Fig. S2a†), and shows no change in the position of the perovskite XRD peaks after annealing. Electrospraying MACl on PbI2 forms segregated MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 phases as shown in Fig. S2b† because of the low solubility of chloride ions in iodide-based perovskite. The XRD pattern clearly indicates a change in position of the MAPbI3 XRD peaks (at ∼14° and 28°), but no such transformation for MAPbCl3. Similarly, no change is observed in the case of FAPbI3 (Fig. S2c†) either. Considering the fabrication of different types of perovskites, the peak position change is only observed in the case of MAPbI3, supporting the presence of both the (002) and (110) families of XRD peaks before annealing, corresponding to the tetragonal structure of MAPbI3, in which the (002) orientation changes to (110) during annealing. If the change in crystal structure is because of the excess electrospraying of AX (A = MA+/FA+ and X = I−/Br−/Cl−), it would be visible in the case of other perovskites as well. Moreover, intentional electrospraying of excess MAI results in the presence of isolated MAI in the film, giving rise to diffraction peaks from MAI crystals at 9.6°, 19.6°, and 29.6°.8
MAPbI3 undergoes a phase transition from a tetragonal to a cubic structure at 57 °C. However, the results suggest a change in the relative intensity of (002) and (110) peaks; no simultaneous shift in the (110) and (002) reflections to merge together at 14.01° (corresponding to the (001) peak of cubic perovskite26,27) is observed, which eliminates the possibility that the change in the XRD peaks is related to the phase transition of perovskite. Additionally, the presence of the (211) reflection position at 2θ = 23.5° (Fig. S1b†), which is inconsistent with the cubic symmetry of MAPbI3, also supports the hypothesis that the change in the peaks is not related to the phase transition of MAPbI3.
Emergence of the two orientations
After resolving close peaks in the XRD pattern and observing the change in crystal orientation by annealing, the emergence of the two families of peaks and their variation with annealing was studied. For this analysis, we deconvoluted the peaks and calculated the area under each of them to represent the amount of grain oriented into each direction. Since the peaks ((002) and (110)) at ∼14° have the highest intensities, they were used for further analysis in this work. Curve fitting was performed in the range 2θ = 13.6 to 14.4° on a background subtracted XRD pattern using a Voigt function (combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian), which mimics shapes of both peaks (peak 1 at 13.99° and peak 2 at 14.14°). Peak positions were kept constant during fitting. The detailed curve fitting results are shown in Fig. S3,† corresponding to the before and after annealing XRD patterns displayed in Fig. 1. The Voigt function fits the XRD patterns well with R2 > 0.99 for all the cases. After fitting the two peaks, the fraction of each peak (F(002) or (110)) is calculated using the following equation: (1)

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite film deposited for different MAI electrospray times before annealing (dashed curve) and after annealing (solid curve), indicating the evolution of (002) and (110) peaks as the perovskite formation occurs. As the electrospray deposition time increases, perovskite peak intensity increases because of the reaction between MAI and PbI2, and the formation of perovskite. We can see that both peaks emerge and grow together; however, the (002) peak grows at a higher rate and therefore has higher intensity than the (110) peak before annealing. Interestingly, the total fraction of the (002) peak in the convoluted (002) and (110) peaks, calculated using eqn (1), remains almost constant in the range 0.7–0.8 as the deposition time increases (Fig. 2b). After annealing the films, the (002) peak diminishes, and the XRD patterns of all the films are aligned at the (110) reflection (solid curves in Fig. 2a). The total fraction of the (002) peak reduces to 0.15–0.05 for all the deposition times. The corresponding XRD patterns focused on the PbI2 peak (12.6°) and (211) peak of perovskite for different deposition times are shown in Fig. S4a and b,† respectively, showing no displacement in these peaks with annealing. Additionally, the (211) reflection position at 2θ = 23.5°, which is consistent with tetragonal perovskite but inconsistent with the higher-temperature cubic phase, was also observed after annealing (Fig. S4b†).

Effect of substrate and annealing temperatures
The process of annealing is very crucial and has been shown to significantly influence the film crystallinity. The effect of substrate temperature during deposition and annealing temperature on the crystal orientation was studied. The temperature at which reorientation occurs and the (110) orientation is favored during the perovskite formation was determined. This was done by preparing perovskite samples at different temperatures by electrospraying MAI on the PbI2-coated substrates held at different temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 55 °C. Fig. 3a displays their XRD patterns before (dashed curve) and after annealing (solid curve). The (002) orientation is preferred at room temperature, while upon increasing the substrate temperature, the (110) peak starts to rise and becomes dominant. Fig. 3b shows the fractional area of (002) and (110) reflections before and after annealing as a function of substrate temperature. The fraction of the (110) peak area increases as the (002) peak area decreases upon increase of substrate temperature. The increase in the fraction of the (110) peak with substrate temperature compared to its fraction in the film deposited at room temperature at all the deposition times is observed. This occurs as at higher substrate temperatures, the perovskite grains oriented in the (002) direction during deposition transform into the (110) orientation. Overall, grains are first oriented in the (002) direction during deposition and then convert to the (110) orientation with time as more energy is provided at high substrate temperature. Consequently, the conversion from (002) to (110) is higher at higher substrate temperatures. This is also consistent with Lilliu et al.,33 which described the dominance of the (110) orientation rather than (002) at high substrate temperatures during spin coating of perovskite precursors. The substrate temperatures used in their study33 were much higher than in the present study because of direct solution deposition, requiring additional energy (heat) to evaporate the solvent and then form the perovskite. At ∼43 °C substrate temperature, the (110) orientation begins to dominate in the as-deposited perovskite film. Above 43 °C, perovskite oriented in the [110] direction dominates and at 55 °C, the average fraction of the (110) peak is similar to the fraction of the (002) peak in the film fabricated at room temperature, exactly inverting the orientation composition. At high temperatures, the film looked rough and hazy, which is due to faster reaction between MAI and PbI2 compared to electrospray deposition at room temperature, similar to what was previously reported for two-step deposition of perovskite.6,36,37 At very high temperatures (above 55 °C) the electrosprayed MAI does not even adhere to the film because of its high volatility, and hence those temperatures are not considered here. These films were then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min, and the XRD patterns of all films aligned at the (110) peak. Further increase in the fraction of the (110) peak was observed (filled symbols) because of the conversion of the remaining grains oriented in the (002) to (110) orientation with annealing. Overall, the fraction of the (002) peak reduces, and that of the (110) peak enhances in the annealed film. Interestingly, the total fraction of the (110) peak in all the annealed films for all the substrate temperatures is constant, ∼0.85, irrespective of the (002) peak fraction present before annealing. This suggests that the transformation/grain reorientation is kinetically very fast at 100 °C; however, still a small proportion (<15%) of (002) oriented grains are always retained in the film after annealing.

(b) Fraction of XRD peak area of the perovskite peak (002) (circles) and (110) (squares) before (hollow symbols) and after annealing (filled symbols) as a function of substrate temperature. 
In order to determine the temperature at which reorientation occurs and calculate the activation energy for reorientation from (002) to (110), the films were synthesized at room temperature, with the dominating (002) orientation, and annealed at various temperatures for 5 minutes. The synthesized films contain 75–80% fraction of perovskite grains oriented in the [002] direction and 25% in the [110] direction (open symbols in Fig. 4a), similar to Fig. 2b and 3b. Annealing at 40 °C does not affect the crystal orientation significantly; however, as the temperature increases, grains reorient from [002] to [110] directions and the fraction of the (110) peak increases. Higher annealing temperature increases the conversion from (002) to (110) orientation, and the conversion occurs at ∼58 °C. However, at certain temperatures (around 85 °C and beyond), reorientation is very fast and the fraction of each orientation saturates. The highest fraction of perovskite oriented in the [110] direction reaches around 70% after annealing at 100 °C, and annealing the films at temperature > 100 °C does not significantly change the crystallinity, but can destroy the film morphology by forming large islands, and degrade perovskite, as reported previously.12 There are still some grains oriented in the [002] direction present in the film after annealing at 100 °C, which might be because of the close proximity of the two peaks, making it difficult to completely eliminate the (002) peak from the tail of the (110) peak. The activation energy of reorientation is calculated by solving the first order rate of change in fractional peak area (F) of the two peaks: (2)where Ao is a pre-factor, Ea is the activation energy, − sign is for the (002) peak as it decreases with annealing, and + sign is for the (110) peak as it increases with annealing. Initial conditions are as follows: at t = 0, F = fractional area before annealing (Fbefore annealing), and at t = tf, F = fractional area after annealing (Fafter annealing). Solving eqn (2) gives (3)
 Fig. 4  (a) Fraction of (002) (circles) and (110) (squares) peak area before and after annealing, and (b) fractional change in the peak area of (002) and (110) peaks with annealing as a function of annealing temperature. 
The plots of the natural log of the left hand side as a function of 1/RT for both the (002) and (110) peaks are shown in Fig. 4b, further indicating that the process is very fast at higher temperatures so the change in the peak area saturates at a certain temperature. Therefore, the activation energy is calculated from the average of the slope of the curves at low temperature (104/RT > 3.45 mol J−1) and is (70.2 ± 23.5) kJ mol−1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first estimation of the activation energy for such grain reorientation in MAPbI3 films. Nonetheless, the trend in the change in the orientation with temperature matches the previous study.32,33
Effect of annealing procedure: rapid vs. slow annealing
In order to capture transformation during annealing, an in situ XRD measurement would be desirable, but the time required for a theta–theta scan is not compatible with the fast kinetics of the process. Some groups have successfully reported time-resolved XRD measurements,38–41 but these are generally not routinely available. Instead, we applied the grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering technique, more compatible with in situ measurements. GIWAXS provides a 2D scattering plot of intensity as a function of photon wave vector transfer (q) at each measurement. In grazing-incidence geometry, the components of the scattering vector q are given by (4a) (4b) (4c)
For the specular reflection condition maintained in our XRD theta–theta scans, αi= αf= θ, the photon wave vector transfer is all in the z-direction and becomes (5)where d is the spacing between the crystal planes. Therefore, 2θ = 13.99 and 14.14° representing (002) and (110) planes, corresponds to q = 0.9927 and 1.0033 Å−1, for the Cu Kα wavelength used in XRD. Fig. 5a shows the 2D GIWAXS pattern of perovskite prepared on a TiO2/FTO slide before annealing, exhibiting crystalline domains oriented in [002] and [110] directions out-of-plane. The azimuthally integrated scattering intensity (azimuthal angle ranging from 90° to 180°, corresponding to the top-left quadrant of the GIWAXS pattern) is plotted in Fig. S5 (ESI†) as a function of scattering vector, q, over the range of q that includes the perovskite (002) and (110) features. A broad peak of perovskite is observed in the q range of 0.9635–1.061 Å−1, consistent with the experimental resolution, which in this q-range is about 0.05 Å−1, dominated by the geometry of the measurement.42 The highest peak intensity at q = 1.005 Å−1, in contrast to the expected peak at 0.9927 Å−1. A small rightward shift of the peak position might come from the small experimental error of the distance between the sample and the detector. Additionally, we could not observe a clear difference between the (002) and (110) XRD peaks. However, a trend in the peak shift could still be observed allowing investigation of the change in the crystal orientation as a function of the annealing temperature. The film was first annealed for 5 min on a 100 °C hot plate and quickly quenched. Fig. 5b shows azimuthally integrated scattered intensity before and after annealing and indicates a rightward shift of the peak, compatible with the observation from XRD. Then, in situ GIWAXS was performed to investigate the change during annealing. The sample was kept on a thermal stage, the temperature was increased at a rate of 20 °C min−1 up to 100 °C and then decreased to room temperature, and measurements were taken at every 5 °C change. Azimuthally integrated intensity profiles of the GIWAXS pattern taken at various temperatures during warming up from 30 °C to 100 °C and cooling down to 30 °C are displayed together in Fig. 5c. It is important to note that a correction due to the thermal expansion of the sample and stage was taken by realigning the sample at each temperature as mentioned in the Experimental section.† Interestingly, the perovskite peak shifts leftward during temperature increment, shifts back rightward as temperature decreases, and returns to the original position. This kind of shift is usually because of the thermal expansion and contraction of the material during increase and decrease of temperature, respectively.20 Moreover, the peak intensity decreases, which may be due to the degradation as a slight increase in the corresponding lead iodide peak is also observed. The observed peak shift during annealing is in contrast to the observation from rapid annealing for 5 min, where a rightward shift of the (002) peak to the (110) peak occurs. This dissimilarity occurs due to the different annealing procedures used during the measurements. When the films were annealed slowly while the measurements were taken, thermal expansion and contraction of the material was observed. Overall, a crystalline perovskite film is formed during electrospray deposition at room temperature, which then exhibits a crystal structure change in different annealing environments. In rapid annealing and quenching, the orientation of grains changes from the [002] direction to the [110] (rightward to [002]) irreversibly, whereas, during slow annealing, a reversible leftward peak shift occurs due to temporal thermal expansion of the perovskite. Additionally, the reversible peak shift during slow annealing is also observed for the case of mixed halide perovskite (MAPbI3−xBrx) (Fig. S6, ESI†), which does not have phase transition in this range of temperature, and further confirms that the origin is the thermal expansion.

Effect of change in crystal orientation on perovskite film properties
The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells strongly depends on the film morphology and its electronic and optical properties. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the effect of the change in the crystal orientation on the film properties. Additionally, previous studies showed anisotropy in the properties of perovskite, which change with their crystal orientation: for example, anisotropy in charge transport of orientationally pure crystalline MAPbI3 perovskite film fabricated using a thermal-gradient-assisted directional crystallization,43 anisotropy in mechanical properties (bulk, shear, and Young's modulus),44 and absorption properties. The film morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical properties by its absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and charge transport properties by time-resolved photoluminescence measurements of the films before and after 5 min annealing at 100 °C. SEM images of the perovskite film deposited on a TiO2/FTO substrate before and after annealing (Fig. 6a and b) indicate that annealing increases the grain size, heals any pin holes present in the film, and improves film smoothness. The grain size increases from 76 ± 2 nm before annealing to 320 ± 11 nm after annealing (calculated from the SEM images). Annealing-induced improvement in surface morphology/smoothness is well known in literature due to an increase in the grain size. However, in this work the increase in the grain size is the result of the conversion of the crystal oriented in the [002] direction to one in the [110] direction and merging with crystals oriented in the [110] direction. This is further sustained by the decrease in the full width half maxima of the (110) peak in the XRD pattern with annealing and the fact that the total peak area (sum of (002) and (110) peak areas) remains nearly the same before and after annealing. Changes in the surface morphology suggest that annealing is beneficial for obtaining a good quality film.

(c) Steady-state absorption and photoluminescence spectra before (dashed curve) and after (solid curve) annealing. (d) Time-resolved photoluminescence before and after annealing. The decay curves were fit with a monoexponential decay function ignoring the instrument response function of the spectrometer. The photoluminescence decay lifetime (τPL) represents the average value from measurements of two different samples. 
An annealing-mediated improvement in the morphology of the perovskite layer also affects the luminescence properties of the perovskite film. Fig. 6c shows steady-state absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the MAPbI3 perovskite film deposited on a TiO2/FTO substrate before and after annealing. The PL spectra represent time-integrated spectra of time-resolved PL measured to characterize the dynamics of PL decay. The PL spectra are normalized to their maxima for better comparison. Note that the position of the inter-band absorption essentially does not change after annealing, though probably the absorption coefficient does, resulting in the higher absorbance level, and an apparent shift toward longer wavelengths is observed for PL emission. The spectrum shifts from 767 to 773 nm, corresponding to a ∼10 meV energetic shift toward lower energies. The PL emission is associated with a radiative recombination of photogenerated charges but may have various origins including band-to-band transition (free charge recombination) and exciton recombination. Recently it was argued that for the organolead trihalide perovskites at low excitation intensities, comparable to the working condition of the solar cell, PL occurs mostly from recombination of excitons weakly localized just below the energetic mobility edge, a working regime of the solar cell. This may be surprising as the lack of band filling with free charges should prevent any photovoltaic application; however, at room temperature, those weakly localized excitons can be thermally activated, diffuse and “escape” above the mobility edge and play the role of free charge carriers.45 Spectral shift of the PL spectrum toward lower energies could be another confirmation that upon low excitation intensity, PL origins from recombination of weakly localized excitons. It is possible that the annealing process forms deeper local minima in the conduction band of MAPbI3 (alternatively, local maxima in the valence band, or both) to which excitons will relax to minimize their energy and then, after full relaxation, recombine/luminesce. Fig. 6d shows the dynamic characteristics of the PL process of the MAPbI3 perovskite film before and after annealing. In both cases, the decay curve could be successfully fitted with monoexponential decay; however, the fitting gives vastly different PL decay lifetimes (τPL): 37.5 ns and 28.5 ns for the sample before and after annealing, respectively. At first, this may be surprising as it was demonstrated that annealing greatly improves the quality of the perovskite film (notably its grain size is significantly increased, Fig. 6a and b) and as a consequence, the PL lifetime should rather increase, simply because of the expected mitigation of defect assisted non-radiative recombination on the grain surface.46,47 However, although it is true for a standalone perovskite film it may not hold true for the MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO device. Very likely annealing also improves the quenching properties of the TiO2 layer in a way that it leads to a better MAPbI3/TiO2 interface morphology and consequently enhanced charge carrier injection from the MAPbI3 film to the TiO2 layer. It is actually desirable, and it should improve the photovoltaic performance of the device. Therefore, on the one hand, annealing should elongate the PL lifetime of the MAPbI3 film, but on the other hand the rate of extraction of free charge from a conduction band of the MAPbI3 to TiO2 becomes greater and may easily overcome the first effect. As a result, shortening not elongation of the PL lifetime could be observed as well, specifically as it occurs in the annealed sample.
One drawback of our fabrication method is that we cannot synthesize perovskite crystals fully oriented in only the (002) direction, to investigate the properties of grains in the (002) orientation, which would be interesting to compare. In our method, both (002) and (110) emerge together during the formation of perovskite, while the former develops at a higher rate. Overall, the differences in the properties before and after annealing suggest that it is critical to evaluate the close XRD peaks and reach full conversion to perovskite oriented in the (110) direction in order to achieve the desired structural and optoelectronic properties of the film for maximum power conversion efficiency, and for precise determination of lattice parameters. Maximum orientation conversion to (110) can be achieved by thermal treatment as described in the present study, or by changing the perovskite precursor ratio.31
Conclusions
The formation of the perovskite film oriented in (002) and (110) directions was elucidated in this study. The perovskite films were deposited using an electrospray technique, and the emergence of the two orientations was studied during perovskite formation. Additionally, the effect of process parameters, substrate temperature, and post-annealing temperature on grain orientation and subsequently on the film properties was investigated. Two types of annealing, rapid and slow, were studied with in situ measurements. The grains oriented in the [002] direction convert to the [110] direction at high temperature and merge with other grains with the (110) orientation irreversibly during rapid annealing at 100 °C for 5 min and rapid quenching. However, during slow annealing and cooling of the film, reversible thermal expansion and contraction in the crystal structure is observed. Importantly, films with (110) dominant orientation show enhanced light absorption, smooth morphology, and efficient charge carrier transport properties, which are desirable in photovoltaic devices. Therefore, the study shows the importance of closely resolving the XRD peaks of the deposited perovskite film.
