    , Accepted 3rd September 2014First published on 8th September 2014AbstractThe metal-free photocatalyst, g-C3N4, is very attractive for solar hydrogen production. Presently, g-C3N4 is mainly fabricated by the conversion of nitrogen-rich precursors at high temperature (400–600 °C) for a long reaction time (several hours to days). Herein we report a rapid synthetic strategy named “microwave (MW)-assisted heating synthesis”, which allows the highly crystalline g-C3N4 photocatalyst to be fabricated in minutes. The obtained g-C3N4 displays enhanced photocatalytic H2 production. In addition, the described synthetic strategy is a general approach that can also be applicable to other nitrogen-rich organic precursors, such as melamine, cyanamide, and thiourea. Importantly, the present process enables scale-up production of g-C3N4 for several grams in minutes.
Solar hydrogen production has been regarded as one of the most important techniques for providing renewable clean energy resources in the future. In the past few decades, it has attracted tremendous efforts for developing various photocatalysts to produce hydrogen fuels through solar water splitting.1–5 So far several UV-active and visible-response photocatalysts containing metals, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), cadmium sulfide (CdS), In1−xNixTaO4, NaTaO3, (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx), have been demonstrated as promising photocatalysts for H2 production, but their limitations in terms of the requirement for UV excitation, photo-corrosion, and high cost are also noticeable.6–10 In comparison, carbon based semiconductors have become excellent candidates as new photocatalysts owing to their stability and “earth-abundant” nature.
Very recently, Wang and co-workers reported a polymeric photocatalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), for hydrogen production using visible light.11,12 Unlike those metal-ion-based photocatalysts that need expensive metal salts for synthesis, the g-C3N4 materials can be prepared using cheap nitrogen-rich precursors via a simple polymerization process. Moreover, this metal-free photocatalyst holds high thermal and chemical stability, and has a small band gap for visible light response with suitable band edge levels for water splitting.13–15 In addition, g-C3N4 has also been demonstrated for applications in carbon dioxide capture and fuel cells.16–18 However, the synthetic methods in the literature usually require high temperature (400–600 °C) with a long reaction time (several hours at least) for the conversion of nitrogen-rich precursors into g-C3N4. For example, Wang and co-workers fabricated g-C3N4 materials through thermal polymerization, precipitation, and solvothermal synthesis in a period of 4–96 hours.19–22 Thomas and co-workers reported mesoporous g-C3N4 through a 4 h thermal polymerization process.23 Zou et al. reported the thermal polymerization of melamine into g-C3N4 at 500 °C for 4 h.24 All these processes are time- and energy-consuming. Therefore, a rapid strategy for large-scale synthesis of g-C3N4 becomes highly desirable for practical applications.
Herein we report a rapid synthetic strategy named “microwave (MW)-assisted heating synthesis”, which allows the production of g-C3N4 photocatalysts in minutes through urea polymerization. The MW-assisted processes involve energy transfer from MW to the MW-absorber materials which induces strong heating in minutes, and have been widely used to fabricate various metal oxides and chalcogenide nanostructures.25 In the present method, CuO is used as the MW-absorber that can strongly absorb MW and rapidly raise a high temperature up to 1285 K in less than 7 min at an operation power of 1 kW.25 Interestingly, the g-C3N4 produced by this MW-assisted process can exhibit more than 1.5 times higher photocatalytic H2 generation rate than that of the g-C3N4 produced by the thermal polymerization process (550 °C for 6 h). Importantly, this MW-assisted process is a general strategy for the g-C3N4 synthesis, and one can use many different nitrogen-rich small molecules as precursors, such as urea, melamine, cyanamide, and thiourea. Moreover, this method is capable of scale-up production of g-C3N4 by feeding large amount of starting materials. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the MW-assisted synthesis of g-C3N4 photocatalysts.
Typically, the obtained products through the MW-assisted polymerization of urea are labeled as MCNP-t, in which P refers to the MW power (W) and t is the MW heating time (min). A comparison sample of g-C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. S1†) was also prepared by heating urea at 550 °C for 6 h in Ar (labeled as CN550) according to literature protocols (CN550 was used as the reference sample as we found that the CN550 possessed very high H2 production activity in our experiments, Fig. S2†).26,27 The model reaction, H2 generation via proton reduction, was used for evaluating the photocatalytic performance of prepared g-C3N4 samples.
In comparison with previous synthetic methods, a distinct feature of the MW-assisted heating synthesis has a very short reaction time. As shown in Fig. 1a, the sample prepared at 1000 W MW power for 18 min (MCN1000-18) showed two distinct diffraction peaks at 13° and 27.5°, resulting from the periodic array of the intraplanar tri-s-triazine motif stacking and the interlayer structural aromatic packing, respectively.11 These characteristic XRD features are essentially the same as that of the CN550 sample, and indicate the formation of g-C3N4. However, we noted that the peak intensities of the MCN1000-18 sample are evidently stronger than those of the CN550 sample, indicating an improved crystalline quality of the MCN1000-18 sample. This might be attributed to the MW-enhanced polymerization process that provides stronger localized heating as opposed to bulk thermal treatment. In addition, the other two weaker peaks at 18 and 22o, caused by (011) and (110) plane reflection, are also evident when compared to those of the CN550 sample.28,29

The FT-IR spectrum of MCN1000-18 is also essentially the same as that of the CN550 sample (Fig. 1b). We observed a series of bands of the typical stretching vibration modes of CN heterocycles (1640, 1568, 1460, and 1411 cm−1) and the intense bending vibration mode of the tri-s-triazine unit (810 cm−1). The stretching vibration modes of C–N(–C)–C and C–NH–C were also observed at 1318 and 1240 cm−1, respectively. These IR bands are typical vibration modes of triazine rings. The –NH2 stretching vibration mode appeared at around 3200 cm−1. In addition, the absence of the absorption peaks at 3000 and 2200 cm−1 excludes the formation of the CN triple bonds.19 All these results suggest that the polymerization of urea into g-C3N4 can be completed in 18 minutes. To the best of our knowledge, this case is the first example that the g-C3N4 photocatalyst could be synthesized within such a short time.
Typical TEM images of the MCN1000-18 sample are illustrated in Fig. 1c. The nanosheets appear as velvet-like sheets with rolling edges, as confirmed by TEM observation. The high crystalline quality of the MCN1000-18 sample is further visualized by the HRTEM observation. A very clear HRTEM image with spacing of 0.36 nm, indexed to (002) facets, can be obtained (Fig. 1d). Comparably, the HRTEM image of CN550 is not attainable.
The band gap energy of the MCN1000-18 sample is estimated to be 2.7 eV from the ultraviolet-visible spectrum, which is consistent with previous results (Fig. S3†).11 The C/N molar ratio of MCN1000-18 is only 0.66, deviating evidently from the theoretical ratio of 0.75 for g-C3N4. The elemental analysis reveals that the prepared MCN1000-18 sample is nitrogen-rich g-C3N4. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms revealed that the specific surface area (SBET) of the MCN1000-18 sample is 77 m2 g−1, which is higher than that of the CN550 sample (65.9 m2 g−1). This large surface area is desirable for photocatalytic H2 production since the large surface area can provide more active sites for H2 evolution reaction.19
The photocatalytic H2 evolution was carried out under visible light irradiation using TEOA as the sacrificial electron donor.30,31 Photocatalytic reactions start from the generation of electron–hole pairs (eqn (1)), following the transfer of the photoexcited charge carriers. The added sacrificial electron donor TEOA can consume the photoexcited holes to form the oxidation products (eqn (2)) and thereby suppress the recombination of electron–hole pairs.32 The retained electrons can then reduce water to produce hydrogen (eqn (3)).33 All g-C3N4 samples were in situ loaded with 0.5 wt% Pt as a co-catalyst through photodeposition (Fig. S4†). Control experiments showed that no H2 evolution was detected in the absence of either photocatalysts or light irradiation. This confirmed that the hydrogen evolution requires both light irradiation and g-C3N4 photocatalysts. The MCN1000-18 sample shows a H2 evolution rate of ∼20 μmol h−1, which is more than 1.5 times higher than that of the CN550 sample (13 μmol h−1) (Fig. 2a). As mentioned above, the CN550 sample possesses very high H2 production activity.27 When compared to the g-C3N4 sample obtained through melamine polymerization at 520 °C for 2 h (labelled as M520), an enhancement over 20 times H2 production was achieved under the same experimental conditions (∼1 μmol h−1, Fig. 2a). The apparent QE was determined to be 5.6% at 420 nm using only a 10 mg g-C3N4 photocatalyst, which is considerably higher than literature values based on g-C3N4.27 No obvious activity loss can be observed after four consecutive cycles, revealing the long-term stability of the MCN1000-18 sample for photocatalytic H2 production. hν + photocatalyst → e− + h+(1) h+ + electron donor + H2O → oxidation products(2) e− + H+ → H2(3)

(b) Current–potential curves, and (c) photoluminescence spectra of TAOH formed by the reaction of TA with ˙OH radicals generated from different samples under visible light irradiation for 10 min. 
The enhanced photocatalytic H2 production might be attributed to the enlarged surface area and the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes caused by the improved crystalline quality of the MCN1000-18 sample, as confirmed by photocurrent measurements (Fig. 2b). The photocurrent response of the MCN1000-18 and CN550 electrodes was measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Photocurrent generated over MCN1000-18 is larger than that of CN550, confirming the enhanced separation of photoinduced electrons and holes in the MCN1000-18 sample. The efficient separation of photoinduced electrons and holes in the MCN1000-18 sample can further be confirmed by the ˙OH radical measurement. The photoexcited holes on the MCN1000-18 sample could oxidize hydroxyl ions (OH−) to generate ˙OH radicals in the solution. It has been reported that ˙OH radicals could react with terephthalic acid (TA) in basic solution to produce 2-hydroxy-terephthalic acid (TAOH), which can emit a fluorescence signal with a peak centered at 426 nm.34–36 Therefore, the TAOH fluorescence intensity can be used to quantify the ˙OH radicals which are directly associated with the charge separation efficiency. As expected, the MCN1000-18 sample shows increased TAOH fluorescence intensity in comparison with the CN550 sample. A control experiment confirms no TAOH fluorescence peak without the g-C3N4 photocatalyst (Fig. 2c). The ˙OH radical measurements clearly reveal that the photogenerated holes on MCN1000-18 can generate more ˙OH radicals than CN550, revealing the more effective charge separation in MCN1000-18 than that in CN550. This conclusion can be further verified by the enhanced photodegradation activity for methyl orange (MO) dye (Fig. S5†).
We further examined the lifetime of the charge carriers in MCN1000-18 and CN550 by time-resolved transient fluorescence spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. S6.† The fitted lifetimes of the fluorescence decay profile are listed in Table S1.† The CN550 sample shows three radiative PL lifetime of 3.43 (weighting factor A1 = 24%), 0.6 (weighting factor A2 = 72%), and 17.4 ns (weighting factor A3 = 4%). Comparatively, the MCN1000-18 sample also exhibits three PL lifetime components of 4.1, 0.93, and 19.55 ns, respectively. Note that the A1 increases from 24% in CN550 to 32% in MCN1000-18, while A2 decreases from 72% in CN550 to 64% in MCN1000-18. The average PL lifetime of CN550 and MCN1000-18 was 1.94 and 2.76 ns, respectively. This result evidently reveals that the longer-lived charge carriers in MCN1000-18 allow the efficient charge separation and thus promote the photocatalytic H2 production.
To understand the dynamics of urea polymerization under MW irradiation, we studied the urea polymerization reactions under various conditions. As shown in Fig. 3a, the characteristic XRD peaks of g-C3N4 started to show up after MW treatment of urea for 6 min (MCN1000-6), indicating that the formation of g-C3N4 was initiated in a very short time. However, we note that the peak corresponding to the interlayer structural aromatic systems packing rises up to 27.9o when the reaction time is less than 12 min, and returns to its normal position at 27.5o after 15 min reaction. Further increasing the reaction time to 18 min does not change this peak position, but the peak intensity becomes stronger. Meanwhile, the in-planar reflection peak shifts significantly from 10.9o to 13.0o as the reaction time extends from 9 to 15 min. All these results demonstrate that a regular in-planar connection of the tri-s-triazine motifs in the g-C3N4 layer can form in a very short reaction time (≤6 min). However, some degree of the structural disorders in the tri-s-triazine connection still exists in the g-C3N4 layer when the reaction time is less than 15 min. Further extending the reaction time to 18 min led to the g-C3N4 materials with improved crystalline quality, as revealed by the enhanced XRD peak intensity. Prolonging the reaction time to 21 min causes the disappearance of the products owing to the burning out of the g-C3N4.

FT-IR spectroscopy was also used to monitor the MW-assisted urea polymerization process at different reaction times. White powders were obtained when the reaction time was less than 9 min. The FT-IR spectra clearly reveal that several bands of MCN1000-6 exactly agree with the bands of cyanuric acid (2781, 2449, 2109, 1779, 1722, 1398, 1053, 773, and 535 cm−1), implying that urea first condenses into cyanuric acid.37 As the reaction time increases, the intensity of these characteristic stretching bands drops, while a series of bands of the typical stretching vibration modes of CN heterocycles (1640, 1568, 1460, and 1411 cm−1) and the intense bending vibration mode of the tri-s-triazine unit (810 cm−1) become evident (Fig. S7†).19 In particular, the intensity of CO in cyanuric acid at 1722 cm−1 decreases gradually with the extended reaction time, and disappears after 12 min MW reaction. When the reaction time extends to 15 min, the shape of the spectrum is the same as that of the g-C3N4, suggesting a complete conversion of urea into g-C3N4.
The structure of the intermediate products was further analyzed by 13C MAS NMR (Fig. 3c). The spectrum of the MCN1000-6 sample shows two resonance peaks at δ1 = 152.7 and δ3 = 160.5 ppm, corresponding to the C species in urea and cyanuric acid. Prolonging the reaction time to 9 min results in the disappearance of the resonance peak at δ1 = 152.7 ppm (see the spectrum of MCN1000-9), indicating the total transformation of urea into cyanuric acid. The spectrum of MCN1000-18 gives two resonance peaks at δ2 = 156.8 and δ4 = 164.9 ppm. The first peak at δ4 = 164.9 ppm is ascribed to the C(e) atoms in CN2(–NH2), while the second peak at δ2 = 156.8 ppm is assigned to C(i) atoms in CN3 groups. This result is well consistent with the results previously reported by Wang et al.20 conforming the g-C3N4 frameworks in MCN1000-18. The 13C MAS NMR results are in good agreement with the FT-IR results, further confirming that urea is firstly converted into cyanuric acid, and then to g-C3N4 (see Fig. S8†).
SEM observations reveal that the prolonged reaction time causes the morphology of the products from nanosheets to candy wrapper-like morphology. This candy wrapper-like morphology is caused by the volatilization of the large volume of gas during urea decomposition (Fig. S9†). N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms revealed that SBET of the obtained products greatly depends on the MW irradiation time. The SBET increased from 9.7 m2 g−1 of MCN1000-9 to 56.9 m2 g−1 of MCN1000-15. The SBET value can be further increased to 77 m2 g−1 for MCN1000-18 with improved crystalline quality. This observation suggests that the extended heating time could improve the structural intactness of the g-C3N4, and is consistent with previous reports on thermal polymerization of urea, in which larger SBET of g-C3N4 was observed at a longer annealing time.38 No mesopores and micropores were formed in the present g-C3N4 samples (Fig. S10†). The optical absorption spectra were used to study the effect of the MW irradiation time on the electronic structure of g-C3N4 products, as shown in Fig. S11.† The absorption edge of the products gradually red shifts with increased irradiation time from 9 min to 15 min. MCN1000-15 and MCN1000-18 samples hold the essentially same absorption edge of 460 nm, corresponding to a band gap of ∼2.7 e V. These results reveal that a 15 min MW reaction time is needed to generate g-C3N4 with high crystalline quality to obtain reasonable photocatalytic H2 production activity. Nevertheless, the extended MW reaction time can improve the crystalline quality, enlarge the SBET, and enhance the optical absorption ability of the obtained g-C3N4, thus can promote the photocatalytic H2 production (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Effect of MW reaction time on photocatalytic H2 production over the obtained products. 
MW power also has strong impact on the polymerization reactions. At low MW output power (250 W) for 15 min, the peaks belonging to g-C3N4 were observed, but many intermediate species dominate in the products (Fig. S12a†). Interestingly, when the reaction time is prolonged to 60 min, g-C3N4 can also form at such a low (250 W) MW power, as revealed by the XRD pattern (Fig. S12b†). In addition, we found that g-C3N4 can even be formed at 660 W MW power after 15 min reaction; however, some degree of disorders exists in the g-C3N4 layer, as revealed by the shift of the in-planar reflection peak (10.9o) (Fig. S13a†). These disorders disappear when the reaction time increases to 18 min (Fig. S13b†).
As is well known, several nitrogen-rich organic compounds containing C–N structures, such as melamine, cyanamide, thiourea, have been commonly used as starting precursors to synthesize g-C3N4 through thermal annealing.21,24,39 In order to verify whether the present MW-assisted heating strategy can be generally applicable to these nitrogen-rich organic compounds as precursors for rapid synthesis of g-C3N4, we carried out the MW-assisted synthesis using cyanamide, melamine, and thiourea, respectively, at 1000 W MW power with a 15 min reaction time. The XRD and FT-IR analyses (Fig. S14†) confirmed that in all cases, a well-crystallized g-C3N4 can be obtained, confirming the rapidness and generality of our strategy for g-C3N4 production. Moreover, all of these obtained g-C3N4 samples are active for photocatalytic H2 generation under visible light irradiation (Fig. S15†), though the activity is lower than that of the MCN1000-15 sample (Fig. S16†). The difference in photocatalytic H2 production activities is caused by the difference in particle size, morphology, crystalline quality and optical properties of the prepared g-C3N4 as different precursors contain different C/N ratios and chemical compositions and thereby affect the specific polymerization process. The detailed studies of the reaction time on the physical properties and photocatalytic H2 production activities of the produced g-C3N4 through these nitrogen-rich small molecules will be reported later.
Most importantly, this MW-assisted synthesis can be readily scaled up for g-C3N4 synthesis through increasing the amount of precursors in the synthesis. For example, ∼1 g of g-C3N4 was produced when 3 g of melamine precursors were used in the synthesis. While ∼2 g of g-C3N4 products were obtained when the amount of the melamine precursors increased to 6 g under the same synthesis conditions. Given the easy operation of our strategy, over 1 kg of g-C3N4 catalysts is expected to be produced through enlarging the number of the microwave oven. This demonstrates that the present MW-assisted heating strategy is capable for large-scale production of g-C3N4 materials.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the MW-assisted heating process is a general route for rapid and large-scale synthesis of the g-C3N4 catalyst. This strategy holds several advantages over the conventional methods for g-C3N4 synthesis. First, it is a time- and energy-saving process. The reactions can be completed within several minutes. Importantly, the obtained g-C3N4 possesses enhanced H2 production due to the improved crystalline quality. Second, it is a general route that can be applicable to different nitrogen-rich organic precursors. Third, this process enables scale-up production of g-C3N4 for several grams. Last but not the least, the MW-assisted heating process can be readily operated, and the process can be easily reproduced. We believe that this innovative strategy provides a new route to prepare g-C3N4 photocatalysts, and can be extended to construct doped g-C3N4 and hybrid materials based on g-C3N4 and other materials, which allows us to tailor the composition, electronic structure, and surface functionality for catalysis, energy and environmental applications.
