    , Accepted 22nd June 2017First published on 23rd June 2017AbstractFour dithienoindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (DT-IDT) based small molecules IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 with increasing alkoxyl chain length from methoxy to butoxy on the terminal-groups were synthesized to investigate the end-group side-chain effects on these acceptor–donor–acceptor-type small molecule electron acceptors. The optical absorption and energy levels of the four molecules, blend morphologies, carrier mobilities, and photovoltaic performances of the devices blended with the polymer PBDB-T are systematically investigated. Interestingly, both the solubility and electron mobility are enhanced for these materials with decrease in side chain length, which lead to ideal morphologies and balanced charge transport. Hence, increased Jsc and FF, and thus distinctly higher PCEs of 11.6% were obtained from the PBDB-T:IT-O1-based devices.
Introduction
Non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs), consisting of non-fullerene polymers or small molecules as electron acceptors, have become one of the most promising candidates for further achieving improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs due to their strong optical absorption, easily tunable energy levels, crystalline properties, etc.1–7 So far, through fine chemical modification of high-performance acceptor materials, like ITIC8 and N2200,9–11 and rational selection of donor materials,12–17 the PCEs of the corresponding devices have been pushed to 12–13% in fullerene-free PSCs,18–21 which is comparable to the best performance of fullerene-based organic photovoltaics.22–25 Although the performance of NF-PSCs was boosted to new heights, detailed investigations on the relationships between the molecular structure of highly efficient non-fullerene acceptor materials and the device performance are still limited.
Recently, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecular acceptor (SMA) materials have presented great potential for achieving high efficiencies in NF-PSCs.26–36 Since the A–D–A type SMAs have simple structures, comprising of a rigid coplanar donor unit and strong electron-withdrawing terminal groups on both ends, the optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors of these materials can be effectively modulated by tailoring the chemical structures. In 2016, Zhan and Iain et al. reported that the crystallinity of indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based acceptors could be controlled through fine-tuning the steric hindrance and non-bonding interactions of the side chains on the central donor unit,37,38 which reveals the importance of side-chain engineering in these SMAs. Most recently, we found that the energy level of the well-known ITIC acceptor could be effectively modulated by introducing weak electron-donating methyl groups on the end-groups. By using the superior medium band-gap polymer PBDB-T as the electron–donor, a certified PCE of 11.6% was obtained.36 Continuing the pursuit of high-performance small molecule acceptors, we also found that molecular packing as well as the electron mobilities of IT-OM can be distinctly affected by altering the substitution position of methoxy group on the end-group.34 These findings demonstrate that terminal-groups also play a key role in determining the optoelectronic properties and charge transport properties of the ITIC derivatives. Therefore, further investigations on the side-chain engineering of the terminal-groups in these high-performance A–D–A type acceptors are imperative.
Several previously reported studies on small molecule donors demonstrate that the different side chains on the end-groups greatly affect the solubility and molecular packing structures of the materials and thus the photovoltaic performance of the devices.39–42 Such studies have been conducted in different systems, however, the structure–property correlations are typically not generalizable across families of organic semiconducting materials. Hence, carefully controlling the alkyl side chain length on the end-groups of these A–D–A-type small-molecule electron acceptors and establishing the correlations between the end group structure and the photovoltaic properties could further advance the high-performance non-fullerene SMAs.
Compared to the methyl-modified IT-M,36 our recently reported 5-methoxyl-modified ITIC acceptor, IT-OM-2, can be referred to as a more appropriate candidate for further investigations due to its well-defined chemical structure, stronger optical absorption and enhanced electron-mobility.34 To conduct the study on the end-group side-chain length effect, herein, we designed and synthesized four dithienoindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (DT-IDT)-based small molecules IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 (Scheme 1a) with increasing side-chain length from methyl to butyl on the 5-position of dicyanovinylindan-1-one (DCI). The four small molecules exhibit almost identical optical absorption spectra in solution and slightly different absorption edges in the solid film state, indicating that different π–π interactions were formed in the solid films. Since the energy levels of the four molecules are similar, in this work, we utilized the superior polymer PBDB-T (Scheme 1b) as the electron donor. PSCs based on the four acceptors and the polymer donor PBDB-T blends exhibit PCEs from 11.6% to 4.2%, and both the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are greatly decreased with increase in alkoxyl chain length. Morphology analysis results show that distinctly increased root-mean-square (RMS) roughness and significantly larger aggregated domains are formed in the PBDB-T:acceptor (IT-O3 and IT-O4) blend films compared to the blends based on IT-O1 and IT-O2, which may be due to the much poorer solubility of IT-O3 and IT-O4. The unfavorable donor/acceptor interpenetrating network in the blends is detrimental for efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation among the donor/acceptor interfaces and the charge collection among the photoactive/buffer layers, which could be the main reason for the decreased external quantum efficiency (EQE) and Jsc. Besides, the trends of variation in the charge mobility, balance of carrier transport and recombination mechanism along with the change of the length of the alkyl chains were also studied. Overall, these new findings will provide guidance for the design of new NF-acceptors.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the SMAs
The synthesis routes of these four small molecule acceptors are depicted in Scheme 1c. IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 were synthesized by end-capping DCI-O1, DCI-O2, DCI-O3 and DCI-O4, respectively, through the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Further purification was conducted by using column chromatography and then recrystallization from toluene. All end-groups can be obtained through column chromatography due to the difference in polarity of the 5-alkoxy isomers and 6-alkoxy isomers. The synthesis details can be found in the ESI.†
The thermal stability of the four small molecules was studied via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA plots are shown in Fig. 1a. It can be seen that the decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss are all above 350 °C, indicating that the good thermal stability of the four small molecules can meet the demand of application in PSCs.

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra are depicted in Fig. 1b and c. As shown, all acceptor molecules show the main absorption peak at ca. 668 nm and absorption edge at 740 nm in chlorobenzene solution. It can be observed that the four absorption bands of these small molecules are almost overlapped in chlorobenzene solution, which indicates that the four molecules possess similar intermolecular π–π interaction regardless of the length of the end group side chains. Compared to the absorption spectra in solution, the absorption onsets in solid films of all these small molecules are red-shifted by 40 nm and the corresponding Eoptg is 1.59 eV. The extinction coefficients of IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 are 2.16 × 105, 2.30 × 105, 2.15 × 105 and 2.20 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (see Fig. S1†), respectively. The extinction coefficients as solid thin films of these four acceptors are also provided in the ESI (see Table S1†). The absorption spectra of PBDB-T:acceptor blend films are also provided in Fig. S2.† PBDB-T shows strong absorption in the range of 500–600 nm, while IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 show strong absorption between 600 and 800 nm. The polymer and these novel small molecules show complementary absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, which is beneficial to cover a significant fraction of the solar spectrum.
In order to explore the effect of end group side chain length on the molecular energy levels and molecular conformations of these molecules, theoretical calculations were performed by using the density functional theory (DFT) method with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set (Gaussian 09).43 With the purpose of reducing the computation time, here, the four long n-hexyl side chains were replaced by the methyl group. The calculated molecular energy levels are shown in Fig. S3† and the calculated HOMO levels of IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-I4 are −5.38, −5.37, −5.36 and −5.35 eV, respectively. The calculated LUMO levels of IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 are −3.33, −3.31, −3.31 and −3.30 eV, respectively. Then, we employed the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method to further investigate the electrochemical properties of the four SMAs. The CV measurements were conducted with the films on the glassy carbon working electrode in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The Fc/Fc+ redox couple was used as the external standard. The onset oxidation potentials of IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 are 1.03, 1.05, 1.04 and 1.02 V, corresponding to similar HOMO levels of −5.48, −5.49, −5.48 and −5.47 eV, respectively. The onset reduction potentials of IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 are −0.49, −0.43, −0.47 and −0.45 V, corresponding to similar LUMO levels of −3.95, −4.01, −3.97 and −3.99 eV, respectively. The results from the theoretical calculations and CV measurements indicate that the energy levels of these ITIC-based materials are rarely affected by lengthening the end-capping alkoxy chain. In addition, the polymer PBDB-T exhibits matching energy levels with the four acceptor materials, which implies that PBDB-T should be an appropriate candidate as the donor material in the application of NF-PSCs.
Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the four acceptors, the PSC devices comprising of the polymer PBDB-T as the donor and IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 as the acceptors were fabricated in parallel with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT/PBDB-T:acceptor/PFN-Br/Al. Chlorobenzene (CB) is used as the processing solvent and the optimized weight ratios for all PBDB-T:IT-(O1–O4) blend systems are 1:1, which is coincident with the reported study.34 To further optimize the morphology of the blend films and thus the photovoltaic performance, we adopt a facile thermal annealing process to obtain the optimal devices. Varied annealing temperatures and times were scanned and the optimal conditions are to anneal the devices at 130 °C for 20 min. The device optimization processes based on the four blend films are all similar to those of the PBDB-T:IT-OM-based devices. All the photovoltaic measurements were carried out under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The optimal current–density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a and the optimal photovoltaic parameters of the PSC devices are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, the device based on PBDB-T:IT-O1 exhibits a Voc of 0.93 V, Jsc of 17.35 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.720, which yields the highest PCEs of 11.6% among devices based on the four acceptors. When the methoxyl is replaced with ethoxyl, the PBDB-T:IT-O2 based device exhibits a relatively lower PCE of 9.3%, with a Jsc of 15.34 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.97 V and FF of 0.626. When the end group is changed to propoxyl or butoxyl, the corresponding devices present similar Voc at ∼0.95 V but distinctly lower PCEs of 4.9% (Jsc of 9.80 mA cm−2, FF of 0.514) and 4.2% (Jsc of 9.16 mA cm−2, FF of 0.479), respectively.

The optimal EQE curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 2b. All of the devices exhibited photoresponse ranging from 300 to 800 nm, suggesting that both the donor and acceptor contribute to EQE and thus the Jsc. Therein, the PBDB-T:IT-O1 blend shows a higher EQE value than the other three blends and the maximum EQE value is ∼78% at 550 nm. The EQE values obviously decrease when the alkoxy chains are lengthened, especially for the IT-O3 and IT-O4-based devices. In addition, slightly blue-shifted EQE spectra of IT-O3 and IT-O4-based devices were also observed, which are consistent with their optical absorption spectra. It can be ascribed to the weakened molecular aggregation of IT-O3 and IT-O4 in the blends. All Jsc values deduced from EQE curves are consistent with those obtained from J–V measurements.
Charge generation

Fig. 2c displays the dependence of the photocurrent density Jph (Jph = JL − JD) on the effective voltage Veff (Veff = V0 − Va), in which JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively, Va is the applied voltage, and V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0. From Fig. 2c, with the increase of Veff, the saturation photocurrent (Jsat) in the device with IT-O1 is reached earlier than in devices based on IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4. The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) of devices based on IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 under short circuit conditions are 95%, 92%, 77% and 86%, respectively. This result suggests that, for IT-O1 based devices, both the processes of dissociation of photo-generated exciton into free charges and the charge collection near the electrodes are more efficient than the others.44
Film morphology
In order to gain insight into the nanoscale morphology and molecular miscibility of the blends, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were performed. As shown in Fig. 3a–h, significantly different surface morphologies of the four blend films can be observed. The active layers based on PBDB-T:IT-O1 and PBDB-T:IT-O2 blends exhibit much smoother surface morphology with a relatively small RMS roughness of 1.79 and 2.29 nm, respectively, which indicates the good miscibility of the donor and acceptor components in the blend films, while the blends of PBDB-T:IT-O3 and PBDB-T:IT-O4 show distinct fibrillar-like aggregates with significantly higher RMS values of 19.5 and 20.9 nm, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further employed to observe the bulk morphologies of the blends. Unlike the homogeneous morphology of the blends of PBDB-T:IT-O1, the blend films of PBDB-T:IT-(O2–O4) all show larger aggregates and the domain sizes are dramatically increased especially for the IT-O3 and IT-O4-based blends. Large aggregated domains with size over 100 nm could be observed in the blend films based on PBDB-T:IT-O3 and PBDB-T:IT-O4, which are much larger than the ideal exciton diffusion length (10–20 nm). The distinct difference in morphology even leads to a little change in the Voc of devices. In addition, as shown in Fig. S4,† high PL quenching efficiencies (PLQEs) of the blend films based on PBDB-T:IT-O1 and PBDB-T:IT-O2 contribute to efficient photoinduced charge transfer in the blend films, which benefits from the existence of smaller phase separated domain sizes. For the blend films based on PBDB-T:IT-O3 and PBDB-T:IT-O4 blends, PLQEs were only about 60% and 50%, respectively, which is consistent with the AFM analysis. The large phase separation size limits the exciton transport from the donor to the acceptor, leading to low PL quenching efficiency.

Consequently, it could be speculated that the large number of photogenerated excitons in active layers based on the acceptor IT-O3 or IT-O4 find it hard to diffuse to the D/A interfaces, which limits the EQE and thus the Jsc. We attribute the inferior morphologies of IT-O3 and IT-O4 based blends to their poor solubility. The solubilities of IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 in chlorobenzene at room temperature are 5.55 × 10−3, 3.13 × 10−3, 2.78 × 10−3 and 2.17 × 10−3 g cm−3, respectively. It can be seen that the solubility of these small molecules decreases from IT-O1 to IT-O4 with increase in the length of the alkoxy end groups, which is totally different from the previously reported studies.42 Overall, the observations of AFM and TEM measurements show the relatively ideal morphology for the IT-O1 and IT-O2 based blend films compared to the other two acceptors, which is beneficial for the exciton dissociation, better EQE and higher Jsc of the PBDB-T/IT-O1 and PBDB-T/IT-O2 based devices.
Charge recombination and transport
The carrier mobilities of the optimized devices were measured by utilizing the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5†). The electron (μe) mobility of the pristine IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4 films are 1.01 × 10−4, 3.65 × 10−5, 1.77 × 10−5 and 2.75 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It demonstrates that the introduction of longer side chains such as propoxy and butoxy on the end groups has an adverse impact on their mobilities. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of blend films were measured with device structures of ITO/PEDOT/PBDB-T:acceptor/Au and ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:acceptor/Al, respectively. The experimental results are summarized in Table 2. As shown, it is obvious that the blend films based on IT-O1 and IT-O2 exhibit higher and more balanced hole and electron mobility. In contrast, the blends based on IT-O3 and IT-O4 show rather lower and unbalanced hole and electron mobility, which are unfavorable for the charge transport and collection.

To further probe the charge recombination mechanism in the optimal devices, the light intensity dependence of the J–V characteristics was measured. Fig. 2d shows a linear dependence of the J–V on the light intensity (P) on a double logarithmic scale at both low and high effective voltages for all of the devices based on the four acceptors. The relationship between Jsc and P can be represented by the power-law equation Jsc ∝ Pα, where α is the recombination parameter, with α = 1 corresponding to the absence of photocurrent loss due to bimolecular recombination.45 Compared to the device based on IT-O3 (α = 0.86) and IT-O4 (α = 0.85), much less bimolecular recombinations occurred in optimal devices based on IT-O1 (α = 0.96) and IT-O2 (α = 0.95). Overall, lower carrier mobility, unbalanced charge transport and higher carrier recombination in the IT-O3 and IT-O4-based blend films lead to both decreased Jsc and FF of the corresponding devices.
Conclusions
In conclusion, by increasing the length of the alkoxyl side chain successively on the end groups, we have designed and synthesized a new class of ITIC-based small molecule acceptors, IT-O1 to IT-O4, for application in NF-PSCs. These molecules exhibit similar optical absorption and energy levels, and the influence of the increasing alkoxyl chains on their photovoltaic properties has been well studied in this work. The PSC devices based on these SMAs exhibit PCEs from 4.2% to 11.6%. As observed by AFM and TEM measurements, the blend films based on PBDB-T:IT-O1 and PBDB-T:IT-O2 demonstrate rather fine and evenly distributed domains with sizes of tens of nanometers and continuous interpenetrating networks, leading to a higher Jsc and FF and thus better PCEs. However, blend films based on PBDB-T:IT-O3 and PBDB-T:IT-O4 show distinctly large domains, which is detrimental to realize efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation, resulting in a sharply lower Jsc and FF. Overall, the results in this work demonstrate that the modulation of end group side chains has a great impact on the morphology of blend films in SMA-based PSCs and thus provides a guideline for the molecular design of SMAs.
Experimental section
Materials and synthesis
DT-IDT-CHO was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc., while all the other reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Alfa Aesar Co., TCI Chemical Co., and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., and used without further purification. IN-O1, IN-O2, IN-O3 and IN-O4 were synthesized according to the procedure provided in the literature. The polymer PBDB-T was copolymerized on the basis of our previous work. For the synthesis of terminal groups DCI-O1, DCI-O2, DCI-O3 and DCI-O4, refer to the synthesis method of DCI.

5-Methoxy-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione (IN-O1). 
4-Methoxybenzoic acid (7.6 g, 0.05 mol) was added to a 250 ml two-necked flask. After being flushed by a gentle stream of dry nitrogen, thionyl chloride (12 g, 0.1 mol) and 1–2 drops of dimethylformamide (DMF) were added, successively. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 3 hours and then the excessive thionyl chloride was evaporated. While the target product 4-methoxybenzoyl chloride was under the protection of dry nitrogen, dry nitrobenzene (240 ml) and anhydrous AlCl3 (20 g, 0.15 mol) were added and stirred for 15 min at room temperature. After that, malonyl dichloride (10.6 g, 0.075 mol) dissolved in dry nitrobenzene (120 ml) was added into the mixture and the solution was stirred at 80 °C overnight. Then the solution was further cooled to room temperature and quenched with aqueous oxalic acid (10%, 100 ml). After extracting with diethyl ether (Et2O, 400 ml) three times, the Et2O solution was treated with aqueous sodium carbonate (10%, 300 ml). The aqueous layer was further washed with Et2O (250 ml) to remove nitrobenzene residues and acidified with hydrochloric acid (HCl). The acidified mixture was extracted with Et2O three times. Finally, Et2O was evaporated and the crude product was purified by column chromatography with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the eluent to obtain IN-O1 as pale yellow crystals.

Fabrication of the PSC devices
All devices were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. The ITO-coated glass substrates were first thoroughly cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol twice successively. After the substrates were dried at 150 °C for 15 minutes, thin layers of PEDOT (30 nm) were spin-coated on them and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 minutes in air. The materials PBDB-T:IT-O1, PBDB-T:IT-O2, PBDB-T:IT-O3 and PBDB-T:IT-O4 were all dissolved in CB with a total concentration of 10 mg ml−1 and stirred at 100 °C for 5 hours. Subsequently, the mixture was spin coated on PEDOT modified glass substrates at 3000 rpm to the optimal film thickness of ca. 100 nm. The active layers were then thermally annealed at 130 °C for 20 minutes. Finally, 10 nm thick PFN-Br film and 100 nm thick Al layer were deposited sequentially to complete the device. The J–V curves of the PBDB-T:IT-O1, PBDB-T:IT-O2, PBDB-T:IT-O3 and PBDB-T:IT-O4 based devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 of the standard AM 1.5G spectrum.
Instruments and measurements
All J–V curves were obtained using an AAA solar simulator (XES-70S1, SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) calibrated with a standard photovoltaic cell equipped with a KG3 filter (certificated by the National Institute of Metrology (NIM)) and a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. All EQE spectra were obtained using the solar cell spectral response measurement system QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Ltd, Taiwan). The film thickness data were obtained via a surface profilometer (Bruker Dektak XT). For photocurrent behavior analysis, the photocurrent density (Jph) is given by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the light and dark current densities, respectively. The effective voltage (Veff) is given by the difference between compensation voltage (V0, determined when the Jph is zero) and applied voltage (V), and the saturation value of Jph in the high Veff region is the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat). The corresponding exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss, defined as the ratio of Jph to Jsat) can be determined under short circuit conditions. The carrier mobilities of the blend films were measured with the hole-only and electron-only device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/Au and ITO/ZnO/BHJ/Al, respectively. The surface morphology features of blend films were investigated by using a Nanoscope V (Vecco) in tapping mode with a 2 μm scanner.
