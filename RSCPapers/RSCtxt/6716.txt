    , Accepted 18th May 2023First published on 18th May 2023AbstractSolid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are one of the most promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency and gas flexibility. However, the degradation of their performance during long-term operation limits their commercialization. Among the different phenomena, the degradation of Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) fuel electrodes during long-term operation is recognized as one of the main causes for the loss in cell performance. Accordingly, numerous studies have focused on investigating the degradation of Ni/YSZ electrodes during steam electrolysis, whereas only limited studies have been performed on the stability of Ni/YSZ electrodes after long-term CO2 electrolysis. In this work, the microstructure evolution of Ni/YSZ electrodes after long-term operation in a CO/CO2 atmosphere was investigated. For this purpose, Ni/YSZ-supported planar-type SOEC cells were operated at 800 °C and −1 A cm−2 or zero current with a mixture of CO2/CO (90/10) supplied to the Ni/YSZ electrode. Subsequently, the 3D electrode microstructures of pristine cermet (reference) and after 1000 h operation were observed. A significant loss of Ni in the active electrode was observed in the cell operated at −1 A cm−2 for 1000 h, along with an increased Ni fraction in the support layer. An increase in the Ni particle size (i.e., Ni coarsening) was also observed. In the cell operated with zero current for 1000 h, only Ni coarsening was observed, with no Ni migration. Our results show that Ni migration away from the electrode/electrolyte interface also occurs during long-term CO2 electrolysis to a similar extent as in steam electrolysis.
Introduction
With the increasing energy demand, the rapid consumption of fossil fuels and the accompanying environmental problems are progressively pushing the transition toward renewable and clean energy scenarios.1 However, significant issues related to energy conversion and storage need to be addressed due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy. Presently, solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are considered one of the most promising energy conversion devices, which can convert renewable electricity to chemicals and fuels that can be more easily stored and transported. However, their performance degradation during long-term operation limits their commercialization. It has been found that the degradation of the Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) fuel electrode in SOECs during long-term operation is one of the main causes for the loss in cell performance.2,3
Accordingly, numerous studies have been devoted to investigating the degradation of Ni/YSZ electrodes after long-term steam electrolysis. By comparing the degradation of two SOEC cells during long-term steam electrolysis, The et al.4 proposed that the depletion of Ni at the electrode/electrolyte interface and agglomeration of Ni at the inner part of the Ni/YSZ electrode are the main causes for the loss in cell performance. Fang et al.5 utilized scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with impedance measurement and DRT analysis of an SOEC cell tested for 20000 h. They found that the main degradation comes from the continuously increased ohmic resistance, which is mainly attributed to the decrease in the effective conductivity of the fuel electrode because of the depletion of Ni in the active layer. Hoerlein et al.6 systematically studied the influence of operating parameters, such as temperature, fuel gas humidity, and current density, on the individual degradation processes through a series of long-term degradation measurements of SOEC cells. They proposed that the mechanism of Ni transport for Ni migration can be explained by the formation of volatile Ni(OH)x species.7 Trini et al.8 investigated the degradation of Ni/YSZ cermet exposed to a mixture of H2O/H2 (50/50) and tested at 800 °C for 1000 h in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes. They found that Ni coarsening occurs in both SOFC and SOEC modes, whereas Ni depletion was only observed at the electrode/electrolyte interface in the SOEC mode. This microstructural evolution was considered the main reason for the degradation in the performance of the SOEC. Moussaoui et al. built a model to predict the Ni agglomeration during long-term operation in SOEC mode by using a mathematical morphology approach.9 Sun et al.10 analyzed the change in porosity and Ni redistribution using SEM images of SOEC cells tested in H2O + CO2 co-electrolysis for 1000 h.
Several research groups investigated the degradation mechanisms of Ni/YSZ electrodes in SOECs.4,5,8,11–17 The microstructural degradation of Ni/YSZ includes Ni particle coarsening in the bulk and migration over long distances (i.e., Ni redistribution). Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for Ni evolution in the cermet, as follows: (1) the classical Ostwald ripening process, in which Ni atoms are emitted from one Ni particle, migrate over YSZ or in the vapor phase, and get captured by another Ni particle, and (2) Ni particle migration over the YSZ phase, followed by coalescence with other Ni clusters (particle migration and coalescence, PMC). In both cases, in the absence of other driving forces, the transport of Ni will be driven by the difference in Ni surface energy between small and large particles. Several different mechanisms have been proposed18 to explain the Ni migration over long distance in the cermet. It was found by Hauch et al. that in the SOEC mode, Ni migrates towards the electrolyte at a high current density and temperatures above 950 °C,11 and they explained this as Ni migrating down the gradient of the pH2O/pH2 ratio in the form of Ni(OH)x gas species. In contrast, at lower temperatures and under high polarization, pronounced Ni migration away from the electrolyte was observed.7,12 In this case, the mechanism based on Ni migration with Ni(OH)x volatile molecules in the gas phase seems unlikely.16,18 Alternatively, Jiao et al. found that the variation in the interfacial free energy between Ni and YSZ can account for the Ni migration in steam electrolysis.19,20 However, due to the contradictions among experimental findings from different research groups, the mechanism of Ni migration still needs to be investigated. Moreover, most of the published articles focused on the microstructure evolution of active fuel electrodes in steam electrolysis, whereas, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been devoted to characterizing the potential Ni migration at the electrode/electrolyte interface after long-term CO2 electrolysis. The degradation of the Ni–YSZ electrode in CO2 electrolysis differs from that in steam electrolysis, not only with regard to electrochemistry, but also in terms of the potential carbon deposition that may occur in CO2 electrolysis. These aspects have been discussed in detail in the literature.21–23 With regard to Ni migration, the degradation behavior is very similar to that we report in the current work. The observed difference may be caused by two factors, as follows: (1) the different reaction kinetics between CO2 reduction and steam splitting, thus resulting in a different over-potential of the Ni–YSZ electrode, and hence different driving forces for Ni migration and (2) the pathway and kinetics of Ni diffusion in CO2 and steam and their impact on Ni migration, which remains unclear to date.
In this work, the microstructure evolution of Ni/YSZ electrodes after long-term operation in a CO/CO2 atmosphere was investigated. Ni/YSZ-supported planar-type SOEC cells were operated with a mixture of CO2/CO (90/10) at 800 °C and −1 A cm−2 or zero current. The electrode microstructures are reconstructed at the cell inlet by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography for a pristine cermet in its reduced state (reference) and after around 1000 h operation with different constant current densities (0 and −1 A cm−2). By analyzing and comparing the 3D microstructure parameters of three cells, the Ni/YSZ degradation in CO2 electrolysis was investigated. In addition, the effect of Ni redistribution on the support layer of the Ni/YSZ electrode was also studied. The mechanism of Ni/YSZ electrode degradation in CO2 electrolysis is discussed by comparing the quantitative microstructure analysis in this work with that for steam electrolysis published previously. Based on the obtained results, the driving force of the observed Ni migration in CO2 electrolysis is discussed. The detailed electrochemical performance analysis of SOEC CO2 electrolysis will be reported elsewhere.
Experiments
The cells used in this study were planar fuel electrode-supported solid oxide cells, which consisted of an Ni/3YSZ (3 mol% Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2) support layer (∼300 μm in thickness), Ni/8YSZ active fuel electrode (10–15 μm), 8YSZ electrolyte (∼8 μm), CGO (Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95) barrier layer (∼5 μm), and LSCF/CGO (LSCF: La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ) oxygen electrode (∼25 μm). These cells had a footprint of 5.3 × 5.3 cm2, with an active area of 4 × 4 cm2, where an LSM (La1−xSrxMnO3) contact layer was screen-printed on top of the oxygen electrode.
The cells were tested in an alumina cell test house, and further details about the experimental procedure can be found in the literature.17 To reduce the NiO in the fuel electrode to Ni, the cells were exposed to dry safe hydrogen (N2/H2 = 95/5) at 850 °C for 2 h, and thereafter to humid hydrogen (H2O/H2 = 4/96) for 2 h. Then, one of the reduced cells was taken out and cooled to room temperature as the reference cell for microstructure analysis (herein called Cell_Ref). The other two cells were exposed to performance characterization and a durability test for more than 1000 h at constant current density (0 or −1 A cm−2) under CO2 electrolysis. According to the current density of the durability test condition, the cells were named Cell_0A and Cell_1A, respectively. The performance characterization was carried out with iV and AC electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements. The durability tests were performed under galvanostatic conditions at 800 °C with 13.4 L h−1 CO2/CO (90/10) supplied to the Ni/YSZ electrode and 50 L h−1 O2 to the LSCF/CGO electrode. The reactant conversion for Cell_1A was 56%. EIS was performed using a Solartron 1255 frequency analyzer and an external shunt resistor connected in series with the cell. The spectral data were recorded in the range of 96850 Hz to 0.08 Hz with 12 points per frequency decade. The analysis of the impedance data and iV curves was performed using the in-house developed software RAVDAV.24
The microstructural characterization was performed at a location taken at the cell inlet to ensure that all the analyzed samples were exposed to the same gas composition as the gas supply. The three cell pieces were embedded in epoxy resin and polished for the SEM analysis and FIB-SEM tomography. The SEM images were obtained with a Zeiss Merlin SEM. The accelerating voltage was 15 kV for EsB images and 0.95 kV for low voltage images. The EsB images were used to analyze the porosity of the samples. However, the contrast between the Ni and YSZ phases in these images was low. The low voltage images recorded with an In-Lens detector allowed the detection of the percolating Ni network, which appeared much brighter than the other phases.
3D image sets were collected using FIB serial sectioning with a Zeiss XB1540 Crossbeam microscope on Cell_Ref and the inlet side of interest in the tested cells (Cell_0A and Cell_1A). Two sets of images obtained from In-Lens and SE2 detectors were recorded for each sample and used for post-processing and segmentation. More details on the FIB-SEM serial sectioning and the image post-processing can be found in ref. 25. Fig. 1 shows a series of raw images obtained from the SE2 detector during FIB-SEM serial sectioning, and the milling front direction is presented in the picture. The 3D reconstructions were performed on the representative area highlighted by the yellow (as the active electrode) and red (as the support layer) rectangles in Fig. 1. Although the cells were made in the same batch and the thickness of the active fuel electrode was expected to be about 10 μm, the actual thickness of the active electrode was 12–14 μm (as shown in Fig. 3). The structural inhomogeneity of the area near the interfaces of electrolyte/active electrode and active electrode/support layer can cause some unexpected errors in 3D data analysis. In this work, the location for the electrode/electrolyte interface is defined as where the YSZ phase fraction drops from 100% and becomes relatively stable (further illustrated in Fig. 1 and 6). Subsequently, 10 μm from the electrode/electrolyte interface into the electrode was chosen as the active electrode for all three cells. The 10 μm-thick region next to the active electrode belonged to the support layer (it may contain around 2–3 μm active electrode microstructure, but we still called it the support layer in this work). Different voxel sizes and dimensions of the sub-volumes were used for the three samples due to the slightly different microscope setups used in this study. The overall 3D reconstruction volume was ∼10 × 22 × 12.9 μm3. To obtain the same analyzed volume for the three samples, the maximum size of the sub-volume extracted from the data sets was ∼10 × 10 × 12.9 μm3, i.e., for each sample a volume of 10 × 10 × 12.9 μm3 active electrode plus a volume of 10 × 10 × 12.9 μm3 neighboring support layer. The detailed voxel sizes were 25 × 25 × 35.92 nm3, 25 × 25 × 34.14 nm3, and 25 × 25 × 40.74 nm3, corresponding to the sub-volume size of 400 × 400 × 359 pixels, 400 × 400 × 378 pixels, and 400 × 400 × 317 pixels for the active electrode and support layers of Cell_Ref, Cell_0A and Cell_1A, respectively. The microstructural parameters, including continuous particle size distribution (PSD),26 phase volume fractions, total and percolating triple phase boundaries (TPBs),27 and percolating sites versus critical pathway diameter,25 were computed on the segmented volumes. The properties obtained after long-term operation at 0 or −1 A cm−2 in CO2 electrolysis were compared to that calculated for the reference (Cell_Ref).

Results

Fig. 2 presents the electrochemical performance of Cell_0A and Cell_1A before and after the long-term test and evolution of the cell voltages during the durability testing period. As expected, the two cells behaved differently when exposed to different current densities. As shown in Fig. 2a, Cell_0A had an initial voltage of 881.73 mV, which remained constant over the entire period. The cell voltage of Cell_1A started at 1199.73 mV, increasing steadily with an average degradation rate of 8.2% kh−1. Fig. 2b shows a comparison of the iV curves of the two cells measured before and after the durability tests. They were measured at 800 °C with 24 L h−1 H2/H2O (50/50) supplied to the fuel electrode and 50 L h−1 O2 to the oxygen electrode. The two cells showed a similar performance before the durability test and different degrees of performance degradation after it. As expected, a larger degradation was observed in the cell exposed to a current, i.e., Cell_1A, as reflected in the slope of the iV curves. The measured OCVs for Cell_0A are 969.1 and 968.8 mV, and for Cell_1A are 972.2 and 972.8 mV, before and after the durability test, respectively, which are all very close to the calculated theoretical Nernst potential (977.1 mV), showing the gas tightness of the cells and the test setup. Fig. 2c presents the Nyquist plots of the EIS data recorded before and after the durability tests under the same conditions as that for the iV measurements. For Cell_0A, the serial resistance, Rs, remained unchanged, whereas the polarization resistance, Rp, increased slightly after the durability test. In contrast, both Rs and Rp increased significantly for Cell_1A after being operated at −1 A cm−2 for 1083 h. This variation confirms that more pronounced cell degradation occurred when the cell was operated at a high current load of −1 A cm−2, as indicated in the iV curves. It is speculated that the increase in Rs value can be attributed to the migration of Ni away from the fuel electrode/electrolyte interface during the electrolysis operation, resulting in a significant Ni depletion in the active area. This resulted in an increase in the effective thickness of the YSZ layer, which was responsible for the transportation of oxygen ions.7 The distribution of relaxation times method (DRT) was used to further analyze the different contributions to the overall Rp. In the DRT plots (Fig. 2d), each peak represents an electrochemical process, and the integral area underneath represents the corresponding resistance of the specific electrochemical process.28–30 In our previous studies carried out on the same type of cells,8,17,31–34 we found that the peaks centred at ∼20 kHz, ∼10 kHz, and ∼0.5 kHz were characterized by pronounced thermal activation, while the peaks centred at ∼50 Hz and 1–10 Hz were not temperature sensitive. This strongly suggested that the peaks centred at ∼20 kHz, ∼10 kHz, and ∼0.5 kHz corresponded to the chemical and electrochemical processes in the electrodes and the peaks centred at ∼50 Hz and 1–10 Hz were related to gas diffusion and conversion, respectively. Furthermore, the peak centred at ∼20 kHz was almost independent of the gas conditions; the peak centred at ∼10 kHz was sensitive to the gas change at the fuel electrode, while almost independent of the gas change at the oxygen electrode; the peak centred at ∼0.5 kHz was dependent on the gas change at the oxygen electrode, while almost independent of the gas change at the fuel electrode; and the peaks centred at ∼50 Hz and 1–10 Hz were dependent on the gas change at both electrodes. Therefore, the peak centered at ∼20 kHz is related to the transport of O2− ions through the ionic conducting network, and this part of contribution mainly comes from the Ni/YSZ electrode; the peak centered at ∼10 kHz represents the electrochemical reactions at the TPBs in the Ni/YSZ electrode; the peak centered at ∼0.5 kHz is associated with the electrochemical reactions at the active sites in the LSCF/CGO electrode; and the peaks centered at ∼50 Hz and 1–10 Hz are associated with the gas diffusion and gas conversion processes, respectively. The peaks observed with frequencies of <1 Hz are deemed as measurement artifacts. As shown in Fig. 2d, the most significant change was observed in the high-frequency range (>2 kHz). The integral areas under the peaks centered at 10–20 kHz increased significantly, and the peak(s) shifted towards a lower frequency after the durability tests. This indicates that the main degradation during the CO2 electrolysis comes from the Ni/YSZ electrode, corresponding to the two processes of ionic conduction and TPB reactions in the Ni/YSZ electrode. The change in Cell_1A was more significant than in Cell_0A, indicating the larger degradation of the Ni/YSZ electrode in Cell_1A. Some small changes also occurred in the frequency ranges corresponding to the electrochemical process at the LSCF/CGO electrode and the gas diffusion and conversion processes. An interesting phenomenon is that the peaks corresponding to the gas diffusion and conversion shifted towards a higher frequency, indicating faster reaction rates.

(a) Cell voltage change with time during the CO2 electrolysis durability testing period. (b) iV curves, (c) Nyquist plots of the EIS data, and (d) corresponding DRT plots recorded before and after the durability testing period. The durability tests were performed at 800 °C with 13.4 L h−1 CO2/CO (90/10) to the Ni/YSZ electrode and 50 L h−1 O2 to the LSCF/CGO oxygen electrode. 
The SEM micrographs are shown in Fig. 3. A qualitative variation in porosity can be observed in the EsB images (Fig. 3a–c), and the low voltage images obtained with the InLens detector qualitatively illustrate the Ni percolation (Fig. 3d–f). In Fig. 3a–c, the pores are black, and nickel and YSZ are gray, whereas in Fig. 3d–f, the white phase is the percolating Ni, non-percolating Ni and YSZ are gray, and the pore phase is black, respectively. The SEM micrographs in Fig. 3 display the Ni/YSZ electrode degradation after the long-term aging process. By comparing the microstructure of the Ni/YSZ electrode of Cell_0A and Cell_1A (Fig. 3b and c) with that of Cell_Ref (Fig. 3a), it is clear that the Ni particles grew significantly after ∼1000 h operation at 800 °C, both at 0 and −1 A cm−2 and both in the active electrode and the support layer, respectively. In Fig. 3d–f, it can be observed that the Ni networks of Cell_0A and Cell_1A tended to coalesce and become bigger clusters compared to Cell_Ref, respectively. Besides, Cell_1A also showed an increase in pore volume fraction in the region close to the electrode/electrolyte interface though the contrast and brightness setting can affect the porosity analysis.

In the EsB images pore is black and YSZ and Ni are gray. In the low voltage images recorded with the InLens detector, the pores are black, YSZ and non-percolating Ni are gray, and the percolating Ni is white. 
The 3D volumes (around 10 × 22 × 12.9 μm3) extracted from the investigated geometries for the three cells are shown in Fig. 4. The three phases of interest are represented as follows: Ni particles are red, YSZ is gray, and pores are transparent. Based on the simple observation of the 3D microstructures of active electrodes, a more pronounced morphology change in the Ni phase can be found in Cell_1A compared to Cell_0A and Cell_Ref, especially at the electrolyte/electrode interface. Besides, coarser Ni particles can be observed in both Cell_0A and Cell_1A compared with Cell_Ref.

Table 1 summarizes the microstructural properties quantified on the active electrode and the support layer of each cell. In the following paragraphs, we firstly discuss the parameters of the active electrodes. The Ni phase volume fraction showed a decrease from 28.9% in Cell_Ref to 20.9% in Cell_1A, whereas that of Cell_0A was 27.9%. Considering the experimental uncertainty, it can be concluded that the Ni phase volume fraction in the active electrode of Cell_0A remained basically unchanged in comparison with that of Cell_Ref. Meanwhile, the porosity showed an increase from around 24.3% in Cell_Ref to 26.4% in Cell_0A, and further to 36.0% in Cell_1A. The YSZ phase volume fraction exhibited a slight difference of 46.8%, 45.7%, and 44.2% for Cell_Ref, Cell_0A, and Cell_1A, respectively. Given that the self-diffusion of YSZ is very slow at 800 °C,35 the variations in the YSZ phase fraction indicate the level of accuracy for 3D reconstruction and the following analysis (including the errors from image post-processing and segmentation together with the volume size limitation) plus the structure inhomogeneity.36,37 The total and percolating TPB length showed a slight increase in Cell_0A (2.29 μm μm−3 and 1.92 μm μm−3) and a pronounced decrease in Cell_1A (1.53 μm μm−3 and 0.73 μm μm−3) compared to Cell_Ref (2.29 μm μm−3 and 1.86 μm μm−3), respectively. The calculated interface and surface areas are also presented in Table 1. A significant reduction in pore/Ni and YSZ/Ni interface, as well as Ni surface area, can be observed in the comparison of Cell_Ref and Cell_1A, which decreased from 1.39 μm2 μm−3, 0.39 μm2 μm−3, and 1.00 μm2 μm−3 for Cell_Ref to 0.94 μm2 μm−3, and 0.29 μm2 μm−3 and 0.65 μm2 μm−3 for Cell_1A, respectively. Alternatively, there was little change in the Ni surface area, pore/Ni interface, and YSZ/Ni interface between Cell_Ref and Cell_0A. The change in pore/YSZ interface area, pore surface area, and YSZ surface area among the three cells can be treated as insignificant due to the small variations.

The parameters for the support layer are also discussed. Contrary changes in the pore and Ni phase volume fraction were observed in the support layer compared to the active electrode. Indeed, the phase volume fraction of the pore showed a pronounced reduction from 27.0% for Cell_Ref to 23.2% for Cell_1A and the Ni phase fraction increased apparently from 28.5% for Cell_Ref to 32.7% for Cell_1A. The variation in the pore and Ni phase volume fraction in Cell_0A (30.9% and 26.8%, respectively) compared to Cell_Ref was minor. The variation in the YSZ phase volume fraction in the support layer is similar to that in the active electrode, as follows: 44.4% for Cell_Ref, 42.4% for Cell_0A, and 44.1% for Cell_1A. As already mentioned, this small variation in the YSZ phase volume fraction can be ascribed to the errors from image post-processing and segmentation together with the inhomogeneity of the sample and the volume size limitation. The variations in the total and percolating TPB length were more pronounced in the support layer for both Cell_0A and Cell_1A compared to Cell_Ref. Therefore, the variations in the TPB length can be attributed to the coarser microstructure of the support layer compared to the active layer (and, to a lesser extent, the uncertainty of the 3D reconstruction method). The microstructure inhomogeneity of the support layer can also be demonstrated by the unexpected fluctuation of the YSZ surface area, which was 2.17 μm2 μm−3 for Cell_Ref, 1.74 μm2 μm−3 for Cell_0A, and 1.96 μm2 μm−3 for Cell_1A obtained from calculation. This also means that the representative volume size is significantly larger for the support layer due to the coarser and inhomogeneous microstructure than that in the active electrode.

Fig. 5 shows the continuous particle size distribution (PSD) for the Ni, pore, and YSZ phases of the analyzed cells. The PSD variations in the three phases in the active electrodes are illustrated in Fig. 5a–c, while that in the support layers are displayed in Fig. 5d–f, respectively. For the Ni phase (Fig. 5a), the peak of the PSD shifted from around 0.8 μm for Cell_Ref and Cell_0A to 1.0 μm for Cell_1A. Besides, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of PSD for Cell_Ref is smaller than that for Cell_0A and Cell_1A. Fig. 5b shows that Cell_Ref and Cell_0A have a similar PSD for the pore phase with a peak position at approximately 0.5 μm. For Cell_1A, the peak is positioned at around 0.7 μm, which is much broader than that for Cell_Ref and Cell_0A. The YSZ phase (Fig. 5c) showed similar PSD patterns for all three cells, even if the position of the peak for Cell_0A was slightly shifted compared to that of Cell_Ref and Cell_1A. With regard to the support layer, the pronounced increase in the peak position for the Ni phase PSD of Cell_0A and Cell_1A compared to Cell_Ref can be observed in Fig. 5d, from around 0.8 μm for Cell_Ref to 1.6 μm for Cell_0A and 1.2 μm for Cell_1A. Besides, Cell_0A has larger Ni particles with a diameter of 1.8–2.8 μm. In the case of the pore phase shown in Fig. 5e, it shows a similar distribution in all three cells with a peak at around 0.7 μm. An unexpected trend for the PSD of YSZ was found for Cell_0A (Fig. 5f), showing a few large particles with a particle diameter of over 2 μm.

According to the qualitative observation in Fig. 3d–f and the analysis of Ni PSD in Fig. 5a and d, it is clear that Ni coarsening appeared in both Cell_0A and Cell_1A and was more pronounced in the support layers than in the active electrodes. The variation in the PSD for the YSZ phase in Fig. 5c revealed the rather good microstructure homogeneity of the analyzed volume. The PSD peak position of the YSZ phase for the active electrodes was almost the same, whereas it showed a large difference in the support layers. This means that the active electrodes are more homogeneous, and their structures are finer than that in the support layers. In the case of the PSD of the pore phase, a pronounced variation in the active electrode for Cell_1A compared to Cell_Ref is shown in Fig. 5b, whereas that of Cell_0A is similar to Cell_Ref. This variation in Cell_1A is caused by Ni migration away from the electrode/electrolyte interface, leaving an empty area (as shown in Fig. 3f).
The phase volume fractions of the three cells are illustrated in Fig. 6 and used as further evidence of nickel migration in the electrode. Due to the inhomogeneity of the experimental structure, it is not easy to precisely define the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 6, the left grey dashed line is placed as the electrolyte/electrode interface, where the YSZ phase fraction drops sharply and hereafter becomes relatively stable. The 10 μm region between the two dashed grey lines is the active electrode area, and the part right to the second grey dashed line belongs to the support layer. A significant decrease in the Ni phase fraction was observed in the active electrode after the long-term operation at high current load (i.e., Cell_1A), especially near the electrolyte/electrode interface (from around 0–6 μm), whereas the Ni migration is not apparent in the support layer. The structure is more inhomogeneous in the support layer compared to the active electrode by observing the YSZ volume fraction.
 Fig. 6  Phase fraction of the pore, YSZ, and Ni phases versus distance for Cell_Ref, Cell_0A and Cell_1A. The calculation volume of the cells is 10 × 22 × 12.9 μm3. The grey dashed line at 0 μm represents the electrolyte/electrode interface and the grey dashed line at 10 μm divides the active electrode and the support layer. 
To further quantify the Ni migration in Cell_1A, the position for the volumetric center of the pore, YSZ, and Ni phases in all three cells was calculated in terms of the current direction coordinate starting from the electrolyte toward the support layer. The analyzed volume included the 10 μm-thick active electrode and the 10 μm-thick support layer. Fig. 7 shows the variation in the position of the volumetric center for the three phases. Considering that the YSZ phase was stable under the operating conditions, the tiny difference in the YSZ phase among Cell_Ref, Cell_0A and Cell_1A (9.94, 9.94 and 9.92 μm, respectively) gives an impression of the uncertainties caused by the reconstruction, the volume size limitation and the structure homogeneity of the cells. Comparing Cell_0A with Cell_Ref, the positions of the volumetric center for all three phases showed almost no change. However, this is not the case between Cell_1A and Cell_Ref. For the pore phase, the center moved from 10.16 μm in Cell_Ref to 8.70 μm in Cell_1A, whereas the Ni phase showed the opposite trend moving from 10.00 μm in Cell_Ref to 11.64 μm in Cell_1A. Both illustrate that Ni moved away from the electrolyte/electrode interface towards the support layer during the long-term CO2 electrolysis operation at a high current load (i.e., −1 A cm−2).
 Fig. 7  Position of the volumetric center for the pore, YSZ, and Ni phases in Cell_Ref, Cell_0A, and Cell_1A. The analyzed volume has dimensions of 10 × 20 × 12.9 μm3, starting from the electrolyte/electrode interface toward the support layer in the current direction (20 μm). The position is expressed in terms of the current direction coordinate, with 0 corresponding to the electrolyte/electrode interface, 10 to the electrode/support layer interface (the dashed line in the figure), and 20 to the edge of the analyzed volume. 
The critical pathway diameter, which represents the diameter of the largest sphere that can pass through the phase network, is a parameter to evaluate the quality of the pathway connections of the phases (i.e., the pathway widths of the Ni network for the electrons, the pore size for the gas phase and the YSZ phase for oxide ions). This morphological parameter is critical for understanding the quality of the pathways for the three phases in the active electrode, connecting the electrochemical properties and microstructure information. If the pathway shows a larger diameter (e.g., 200 nm or above), it is beneficial for the diffusion of gas in the pore phase, ions in the YSZ phase, and electrons in Ni networks. Given that the electrochemical reactions occur mainly in the active electrode, the critical pathway diameter was calculated only for this part of the three cells, as shown in Fig. 8. A significant variation in the critical pathway diameter for the Ni phase can be observed in Fig. 8a. The percentage of the pathway with a diameter of over 200 nm is around 90% for Cell_Ref, which slightly decreased but still over 80% for Cell_0A. In Cell_1A, less than 60% of the TPB sites percolated through the Ni phase. The characteristic drop-off seems to be at a similar size (around 400 nm) for all the three cells, indicating that the deterioration of the Ni phase network is the main cause of the poor TPB percolation. With regard to the pore phase (Fig. 8b), Cell_Ref and Cell_0A behave similarly, but Cell_1A behaves significantly different. The percentage of percolating TPB sites with a pathway diameter of over 200 nm is much higher in Cell_1A compared to Cell_Ref and Cell_0A. For the YSZ phase, all three cells show similar patterns, as displayed in Fig. 8c. The results illustrated in Fig. 8 confirm the degradation trends observed in Fig. 3 and 5. Ni coarsening occurred in both Cell_0A and Cell_1A, resulting in a slight degradation of the critical pathway diameter of the Ni phase. In contrast, Ni migration happening only in Cell_1A is the main cause of the decrease in the Ni critical pathway diameter.

Discussion
To clarify the mechanism of Ni migration during the long-term electrolysis operation, we compared our results presented in this work to the findings published previously by Trini et al. from the same group, but on cells tested for steam electrolysis.8 Similar types of cells were used in these studies, thus allowing us to make quantitative comparisons of the cell degradation and associated microstructural changes. Ni/YSZ-supported SOEC cells with the same cell configuration but from different production batches were used in these studies. In Trini's work, one cell was tested at 800 °C and −1 A cm−2 for steam electrolysis over 1000 h, and subsequently the result of this cell was compared with that of Cell_1A from the current work, as presented in Table 2. Both cells were tested at 800 °C and −1 A cm−2 (with 56% steam or CO2 conversion) for 1000 h and showed similar degradation rates of 8.2% kh−1 for Cell_1A tested for CO2 electrolysis and 8.3% kh−1 for the one in ref. 8 tested for steam electrolysis. The two types of cells differed slightly in the initial Ni/YSZ electrode microstructure, as reflected in total and percolating TPBs at 0 h presented in Table 2. The difference could have been caused by the small variations in cell production, cell reduction and 3D reconstruction. After around 1000 h testing, the cell tested in CO2 electrolysis showed slightly more pronounced loss in total and percolating TPBs than that in steam electrolysis.

However, the microstructural evolution of the active Ni/YSZ electrode was not exactly the same between the two cells, especially in the extent of Ni migration and the loss of the percolating TPBs, as presented in Table 2. The two cells exhibited similar characteristics in initial Ni/YSZ microstructure, e.g., 2.23 and 1.86 μm μm−3 for Cell_Ref (this work), and 2.44 and 2.19 μm μm−3 for Cell_Ref_Steam, for total and percolating TPBs, respectively. After around 1000 h electrolysis testing, the cell tested in CO2 electrolysis (Cell_1A) showed a more pronounced deterioration in the active Ni/YSZ electrode than that tested in steam electrolysis (Cell_1A_Steam) with a 60.75% loss in percolating TPBs and a 8 μm-thick Ni migration zone for the cell tested in CO2 electrolysis compared to the 37.90% loss in percolating TPBs and a 4 μm-thick Ni migration zone for the cell tested in steam electrolysis. Table 2 also presents the measured cell electrochemical performance. It can be noted that the increase in Rs is higher for the cell operated in CO2 electrolysis than that in steam electrolysis. This correlates well with the fact that the extent of Ni migration is more significant in CO2 electrolysis than in steam electrolysis.
The Ni coarsening and depletion at the electrode/electrolyte interface observed in this study are consistent with the results reported in ref. 22 for the standard cell tested under CO2 electrolysis. Therefore, it can be claimed that Ni migration away from the electrolyte interface also occurs under CO2 electrolysis. However, this microstructural evolution cannot be fully explained by the hypotheses reported in literature. Mogensen et al.18 proposed the hypothesis that in the H2O/H2 atmosphere, Ni migrates in the form of Ni(OH)x species via surface diffusion below 800 °C and gas diffusion above 900 °C. However, Ni(OH)x species do not exist in a dry CO2/CO atmosphere. Therefore, Ni(OH)2 diffusion alone cannot explain the Ni migration in CO2 electrolysis. Another hypothesis claims that the contact angle gradient (interface energy gradient) is the driving force for Ni migration.8,20 In this work, the mechanism of Ni coarsening and migration is further discussed. Generally, there are two types of driving forces causing the Ni rearrangement during the long-term electrolysis operation, as follows: (1) the gradient in the partial pressure of Ni-containing gas species,7,18 which claims that Ni may migrate down the local pO2 (pH2O/pH2) gradient in the form of Ni(OH)x, and (2) the minimization of the interfacial energy,38 which is related to the contact angle of the Ni and YSZ phases. The partial pressure-driven mechanism is strongly influenced by the partial pressure of the Ni-containing gas species. Fig. 9 shows the total and partial pressure of Ni gas species over the solid flat Ni at 800 °C as a function of the CO2 or steam fraction from 0 to 0.99 calculated using the FACTSAGE software and databases.39 The Ni phase was stable without oxidation in the CO2 or steam fraction range from 0 to 0.99. The top x-axis plots the corresponding oxygen partial pressure, which increased with an increase in CO2 or H2O. There are three Ni-containing gas species (i.e., Ni(CO)4, Ni, and NiO) in CO2/CO atmosphere and four Ni-containing gas species (i.e., Ni(OH)2, NiH, Ni, and NiO) in H2O/H2 atmosphere. It can be observed that in the atmosphere of CO2/CO (90/10), the total partial pressure of Ni gas species was 7.06 × 10−14 atm, while in the atmosphere of H2O/H2 (50/50), the total partial pressure of Ni gas species was 2.67 × 10−11 atm. The total partial pressure of Ni gas species remained almost constant when the pCO2 was >0.5 atm (SOEC mode), while in the H2O/H2 atmosphere, the total partial pressure of Ni gas species increased apparently from around 10−11 to 10−8 atm when pH2O increased from 0.5 to 0.99 atm.
 Fig. 9  Calculated partial pressure of Ni gas species over solid flat Ni at 800 °C (a) in CO2/CO atmosphere and (b) in H2O/H2 atmosphere. 
It is difficult to experimentally evaluate the contribution of the gas diffusion pathway on Ni rearrangement. Lei et al.40 conducted phase-field simulations and concluded that pH2O affects the Ni coarsening only at pH2O of >0.9 atm, i.e., when the partial pressure of Ni gas species is higher than 10−10 atm. In addition, a gradient in the partial pressure of Ni gas species is required to drive Ni to diffuse from high to low partial pressure. As shown in Fig. 9a, in CO2 electrolysis at 800 °C, the partial pressure of Ni-containing gas species was around 10−13 atm, regardless of the pCO2/(pCO + pCO2) composition, indicating that the gas phase diffusion pathway may have an insignificant contribution to both Ni coarsening and Ni migration in CO2/CO atmosphere. Mihaylov et al.41 investigated the formation of Ni(CO)4 during the interaction of CO with silica-supported highly dispersed nickel metal utilizing FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy. In combination with previous studies,42,43 Ni(CO)4 is preferentially formed with a large CO quantity at 350–390 K, and the formation rate drops sharply with an increase in temperature. This indicates that the Ni gas species Ni(CO)4 may hardly be formed under the high-temperature electrolysis condition, which is consistent with the calculation results in Fig. 9a.
With regard to the surface/interface energy minimization mechanism, the gradient in the Ni–YSZ contact angle (i.e., wettability gradient) was proposed as the driving force for Ni migration. Jiao et al.44 proposed that the variation in the Ni–YSZ contact angle is caused by the gradient of pO2 associated with the local over-potential of the fuel electrode. However, Trini et al. pointed out that this gradient is not sufficient to drive the Ni migration observed experimentally.8 Besides, the effect of the polarization on the work of adhesion at the Ni–YSZ interface, which can cause a larger contact angle gradient, was also studied.20 However, the quantitative correlation between the polarization overpotentials and work of adhesion still needs to be discussed. Monaco et al.16 proposed that the work of adhesion between Ni and YSZ can be affected by the electrode overpotential through the accumulation of oxygen vacancies in the electrochemical double layer at the Ni–YSZ interface, which also affects the contact angle between Ni and YSZ. In the following, we calculated the Ni–YSZ contact angle through the electrode thickness along the current direction using models developed by Jiao et al.20,44 and Monaco et al.,16,50 respectively. To assess the gradient of the contact angles through the electrode thickness, the fuel electrode overpotential at the electrolyte interface (ηfuel(x = 0)) was estimated with the corresponding electrode resistance values listed in Table 2.32,45 Then, the local oxygen partial pressure at the electrolyte interface (i.e., for x = 0: cf.Fig. 10) can be assessed according to the Nernst equation,13 as follows: (1)where R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J K−1 mol−1) and F is the Faraday constant equal to 96485 C mol−1. The term pgasO2 is the equilibrium oxygen partial pressure for the inlet gas. It can be calculated according to the equilibrium of H2O, H2, and O2 for steam electrolysis, and that of CO2, CO, and O2 for CO2 electrolysis, as follows: (2)where KH is the equilibrium constant, which equals 2.29 × 1018 for the H2O/H2 reaction, and 2.76 × 1018 for the CO2/CO reaction at 800 °C.39plocalO2(x) represents the oxygen partial pressure at the active TPBs. plocalO2(x)/pgasO2 is proportional to the activity of the surface adsorbed oxygen (aO), which is related to the Ni surface tension causing the variation in contact angle. The detailed description can be found in ref. 44. In this work, for simplicity, we took the thickness of the active Ni/YSZ electrode as 10 μm. Therefore, at the other end of the active layer (x = 10 μm), i.e., at the interface between the active electrode and the support layer, the local electrode overpotential dropped to zero and the local oxygen partial pressure was equal to the one of the inlet gas: plocalO2(x = 10 μm) = pgasO2. Between these two bounds, plocalO2(x = 0 μm) and plocalO2(x = 10 μm), a linear change in plocalO2 is assumed. According to Jiao's model, the contact angle of Ni/YSZ across the active layer θNi/YSZ(x) can be deduced from the evolution of local oxygen partial pressure plocalO2(x),44 as follows: (3)where Wad is the work of adhesion at the Ni/YSZ interface, and a constant value of 1.4 J m−2 is assumed in this work,46γp is the surface tension of pure Ni without oxygen adsorption and equals to 1829–0.4014 × (T - 1728) (10−3 N m−1), ΓO is the saturation coverage of oxygen adsorption on the Ni surface, which equals to 0.481 N m−1,47 and Ka is the oxygen adsorption coefficient, which is approximated to be 1200.48 The term ptotal denotes the atmospheric pressure. The contact angle θNi/YSZ is plotted as function of position x in the active layer in Fig. 10 (the blue and orange dashed lines for steam and CO2 electrolysis, respectively). For both steam and CO2 electrolysis, the Ni–YSZ contact angle decreased along the current direction from the electrolyte/electrode interface to the electrode/support interface, but the gradient was rather small. In this case, the gradient in CO2 electrolysis was slightly higher than that in steam electrolysis. However, these small gradients cannot account for the experimentally observed Ni migration in the SOEC mode, as also pointed out by Trini et al.8
 Fig. 10  Relation between the contact angle and distance x to the electrode/electrolyte interface (x = 0) for H2O/H2 (50/50) (blue lines) and CO2/CO (90/10) (orange lines) electrolysis. Dashed lines represent the contact angle calculated according to Jiao's work,44 and solid lines represent the contact angle calculated according to Monaco and Rorato's model (CEA).50 
Monaco et al. and Rorato et al.16,50 claimed that besides pO2, the overpotential also affects the accumulation of oxygen vacancies in the electrochemical double layer, which influences the contact angle of Ni and YSZ. Considering a blocking electrode (i.e., in the middle of the Ni/YSZ interface away from the TPBs lines), the concentration of vacancies in the vicinity of the Ni/YSZ interface can be estimated as a function of the distance in the electrode through the local over-potential η(x),49 as follows: (4)where  denotes the oxygen vacancy concentration at the Ni/YSZ interface, and  and  are the maximum and the bulk concentrations in YSZ, which are equal to 98113.3 and 3924.5 mol m−3, respectively. According to eqn (1), η(x) can be calculated assuming a linear relationship between the gas composition and distance. Therefore, the concentration of vacancies in the double layer can be estimated through the electrode thickness with eqn (4). To relate this concentration to the contact angles, a linear dependence was assumed between the two quantities. To establish this relation, it is worth mentioning that  is equal to the concentration in the bulk , and hence the corresponding contact angle  can be expressed by eqn (3). Besides, it was assumed that the Ni particles detach from YSZ (i.e., θmaxNi/YSZ = 180°) when the concentration of vacancies reaches . Due to this linear dependence, the contact angle θηNi/YSZ(x) can be calculated as a function of the position in the electrode thickness, as shown in Fig. 10 (where the blue and orange solid lines refer to steam and CO2 electrolysis, respectively). It can be noted that θηNi/YSZ(x = 0) at the electrode/electrolyte interface calculated using Monaco and Rorato's model is roughly 10° larger than θNi/YSZ(x = 0) calculated using Jiao's model.
Also, Monaco and Rorato's model predicts larger gradients in the contact angle for both steam and CO2 electrolysis. Starting from the electrolyte/electrode interface, both curves have a similar slope from 0 to around 4 μm. Hereafter, the curve for steam electrolysis starts to flatten out, while that for CO2 keeps the same slope. The contact angle curves predicted using Monaco and Rorato's model seems to fit better with the observed Ni migration, as summarized in Table 2, than that using Jiao's model, and thus can qualitatively explain the Ni migration for steam and CO2 electrolysis. Using the same model and combined with phase field modelling simulations, Rorato et al.50 reproduced the different Ni migration phenomena in the SOFC and SOEC modes. According to their results, a pronounced Ni migration away from the electrolyte is predicted in the SOEC mode, which is consistent with our experimental results. In the SOFC mode, a small extent of Ni migration towards the electrolyte is anticipated. This small movement of Ni may not be observed experimentally due to the errors from 3D reconstruction and inhomogeneity of the Ni–YSZ electrode local microstructure. Most experimental results showed that Ni coarsening is the main degradation of the Ni/YSZ electrode in the SOFC mode.8,51,52 However, Menzler et al.53 conducted post-test characterization on an SOFC stack tested at 700 °C and 0.5 A cm−2 for 100000 h and observed Ni enrichment in the Ni/YSZ electrode near the electrolyte. This is consistent with our phase field simulations.50 These findings seem to indicate that Ni migrates towards the electrolyte in the SOFC mode, but the extent of Ni migration is much less than in the SOEC mode in the opposite direction (i.e., towards the support layer). Further quantification of the microstructure evolution in long-term tested Ni–YSZ electrodes in SOFC mode is needed to clarify the mechanism.
Conclusions
In this work, detailed 3D microstructural characterization of Ni/YSZ electrodes after long-term operation in CO2 electrolysis was conducted. Three cells were selected for the study, i.e., Cell_Ref where the cell experienced a reduction only, and Cell_0A, and Cell_1A where the cells were operated at 0 or −1 A cm−2 for 1000 h at 800 °C, respectively. The coarsening of Ni was observed both in the support layer and active layer of Cell_0A and Cell_1A. The same type of analysis was performed on the YSZ backbone and confirmed the stability of this ceramic phase during the operation. The migration of Ni in the region close to the electrode/electrolyte interface toward the support layer could only be observed in Cell_1A, indicating that the current played a major role in Ni migration. By analyzing the 3D Ni/YSZ electrode microstructures, a significant loss of Ni in the active electrode was observed in Cell_1A, together with an increase in Ni phase fraction in the support layer. An increase in the Ni particle size (i.e., Ni coarsening) was also observed. In contrast, in Cell_0A, only Ni coarsening was observed, but without Ni migration. Our results showed that Ni migration away from the electrolyte/electrode interface also occurs during long-term CO2 electrolysis. The different possible mechanisms accounting for the Ni depletion under CO2 electrolysis were discussed. It seems that the contribution from the gas diffusion pathway is minor under the conditions explored in this work. The gradient in the Ni–YSZ contact angle may play a significant role, driving the Ni surface diffusion in both CO2 and steam electrolysis.
