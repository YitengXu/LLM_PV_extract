Upon optimization, the co-sensitized DSSCs exhibited remarkable overall efficiency enhancements of 33% and 356% as compared with the devices based on TP3 and YR6 alone, respectively, and a high efficiency up to 9.84% was achieved at the TP3/YR6 molar ratio of 25:1.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been recognized as one of the promising alternatives to the traditional costly inorganic silicon-based solar cells due to their cost-efficient fabrication and the unlimited variety of dyes available.1 Several recent major advances in the design of dyes and electrolytes for DSSCs have led to record power conversion efficiencies.2 However, the rapid progress of perovskite solar cells raised some doubts on whether the efficiency of the conventional DSSCs could be improved highly enough through current research strategies. In view of the theoretical performance and the best achieved values in different kinds of solar cells, there is still much room for the improvement of DSSC performance by increasing the short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). The major strategy to increase the Jsc is to improve the light harvesting efficiency by developing organic dyes with UV-visible-near-infrared (NIR) light-harvesting capability.3 Unfortunately, designing a single small molecule dye that can efficiently absorb panchromatic sunlight is still challenging. Co-sensitization of the TiO2 electrode by two or more dyes with complementary spectral profiles has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to realize a UV-visible-NIR spectral response and increase the photocurrent of organic dye-based DSSCs. To date, most of the successful co-sensitized DSSCs reported have combined a ruthenium dye or a porphyrin dye with metal-free organic dyes.2,4 In our previous studies, a series of simple phenothiazine-based dyes have been developed for highly efficient DSSC applications.5 The co-sensitization of a simple organic dye with a NIR-absorbing porphyrin dye can greatly retard the back reaction and enhance the spectral response of solar cells, resulting in an efficiency (η) exceeding 10%.6 Notably, squaraine (SQ) based dyes have been wildly applied as NIR photosensitizers because of their extraordinary intense absorption in the NIR spectral region and photolytic stability.7 Nazeeruddin et al. used a squaraine dye (SQ1) in combination with a metal-free dye (JK2) to obtain higher efficiency (η = 7.38%) than those of the individual dye-based cells.7d Han et al. employed a cis-configured squaraine dye (HSQ1) together with N3 for co-sensitized solar cells; the action spectra (IPCE) were extended up to 800 nm, and efficiency over 8.14% was achieved.8 Nevertheless, SQ-based co-sensitized device performances were usually not as good as expected. The major factors for the relatively poor performances were the weak absorption of SQs below 500 nm, the formation of aggregates on the TiO2 surface that induce quenching of photo-excited states and quick charge recombination,9 indicating that there is still much room to further improve the device performances by structural engineering of the organic dyes to enhance light absorption, suppress dye aggregation of SQs and retard charge recombination.
In this contribution, a series of phenothiazine-cored 3D bulky organic dyes have been designed and prepared, in which the dyes consist of a cyanoacrylate acceptor directly attached to the C(3) position of phenothiazine, a triphenylamine (TPA) donor group at C(7) on the opposite side of the acceptor, and substituents (R) of different sizes, i.e., hexyl, hexyloxybenzene, hexylcarbazole, and dihexylfluorene at N(10) of the phenothiazine periphery (Fig. 1). The influence of the different substituents on the suppression of dye aggregation and charge recombination as well as the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was systematically investigated. Amongst them, the dye TP3, with the highest efficiency of 8%, was used to co-sensitize with a NIR-absorbing squaraine dye, YR6.10 The co-sensitized devices based on TP3 and YR6 dyes show significantly enhanced Jsc relative to those of the individual single-dye sensitized devices. Upon optimization, the device fabricated at a TP3/YR6 molar ratio of 25:1 yielded Jsc = 19.18 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.721 V, FF = 0.712 and η = 9.84%. The performance is far superior to that of the single-dye device made from either TP3 (η = 8.00%) or YR6 (η = 2.16%) under the same conditions. The efficiency of 9.84% is the highest reported efficiency for squaraine dye-based co-sensitized DSSCs. Electrochemical impedance analysis and transient photovoltage studies were performed to elucidate the high performance of the co-sensitized DSSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The NIR dye YR6 was prepared according to the literature (see the ESI†).10 The synthetic protocols towards these new dyes TP1–TP4 are depicted in Scheme S1.† The dyes TP1–TP4 were prepared in good yields through the Suzuki cross-coupling of (4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)boronic acid with 7-bromo-N-hexyl-10H-phenothiazine-3-carbaldehyde and its analogues, respectively, followed by the widely employed Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate. All the new intermediates and target dye molecules were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectral data.
2.2. UV-Vis absorption properties
The absorption spectra of TP1–TP4 in CH2Cl2 are displayed in Fig. 2a and the detailed spectroscopic data are collected in Table 1. These dyes display two prominent distinct absorption bands in the range of 400–600 nm. The shorter wavelength bands are ascribed to the localized aromatic π–π* electronic transitions of the chromophores, while the longer wavelength ones correspond to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor. The ICT peaks (λmax) for TP2 (485 nm), TP3 (491 nm) and TP4 (487 nm) show a red-shift compared to that of TP1 (469 nm), indicating that the incorporation of stronger electron-donating groups, via attachment to the nitrogen atom, into the phenothiazine core is beneficial to the light-harvesting capability. In addition, the corresponding molar extinction coefficients of TP1–TP4 for the visible absorption peaks are 2.17, 1.99, 2.28 and 1.89 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. TP3 appended with a hexylcarbazole unit exhibits the best light-harvesting property, which may be beneficial for photocurrent generation in DSSCs. The absorption bands of TP1–TP4 adsorbed onto the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface display slight blue-shifts with respect to those in solutions, which can be ascribed to the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid, as well as to H-aggregation on the semiconductor surface as observed for most organic dyes of this type (Fig. 2b).11 Notably, the maximum absorption peaks of TP2, TP3 and TP4 exhibit much less hypsochromic shifts relative to that of TP1, which demonstrates that the intermolecular π-stacked aggregation on TiO2 films may be effectively weakened in the presence of these bulky auxiliary substituents on the nitrogen atom of the phenothiazine core.

2.3. Electrochemical properties
To study the possibility of electron injection from the excited state of the photosensitizers into the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 semiconductor and dye regeneration by redox electrolytes, the electrochemical behaviors of TP1–TP4 were studied by cyclic voltammetry in CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. 3). Obviously, all four dyes exhibit three quasi-reversible oxidation waves. Their first redox waves are attributed to the oxidation of the arylamino moiety. The second and the third quasi-reversible redox waves correspond to the phenothiazine segment. The first oxidation potentials (Eox) correspond to HOMOs, while the LUMOs are calculated from the values of Eox and the zero–zero band gaps (E0–0) estimated from the onset of the UV-visible absorption spectra. The electrochemical data of the four dyes are listed in Table 1. The estimated HOMO levels of the four dyes are sufficiently lower than the electrolyte iodide/tri-iodide redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE), thus ensuring that the oxidized dyes could be efficiently regenerated by the electrolyte. On the other hand, the LUMO levels of all dyes lie above the conduction band edge (CB) of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), indicating that the electron injection from the excited dye molecules into the conduction band of TiO2 is energetically permitted.

2.4. Theoretical calculation
To better understand the electronic distribution in the frontier molecular orbitals and electronic processes upon photoexcitation, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 program package at the B3LYP/6-31 G(d)* hybrid functional for full geometrical optimization (Fig. 4). The HOMOs are delocalized along the donor group and the phenothiazine core, while the LUMOs are primarily located over the cyanoacrylic acid segment and partly on the phenothiazine core. Hence, the well-overlapped HOMO and LUMO orbitals on the phenothiazine core can guarantee a fast charge transfer transition between the donor and the acceptor. Thus, excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO should lead to efficient photoinduced electron transfer from the electron-donating triphenylamine moiety to the terminal cyanoacrylic acid, and finally into the conduction band of TiO2.

In the optimized ground-state geometries shown in Fig. S1,† the dihedral angles formed between the bulky substituents (hexyloxybenzene, hexylcarbazole, and dihexylfluorene) at N(10) of the phenothiazine periphery and the phenothiazine core are computed to be 90° for TP2–TP4. Obviously, the whole molecular skeletons of the four dyes show an out-of-plane twist conformation. Notably, TP3 and TP4 show a considerably large bulky 3D twisted structure, which is favorable for suppressing dye aggregation, charge recombination, and back-electron transfer.12
2.5. Photovoltaic performance
The action spectra of incident photon-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for DSSCs based on TP1–TP4 are plotted in Fig. 5a. The IPCEs of the four dyes display broad bands in the region of 300–650 nm with values mostly >60 to 70%. It is worth noting that the IPCE curves of TP2–TP4 show obvious red shifts to longer wavelengths compared with that of TP1. This further demonstrates that the 3D constructed organic dyes tend to form a broad IPCE, which is consistent with their visible absorption spectrum.
 Fig. 5  IPCE spectra (a) and J–V curves (b) for DSSCs sensitized by TP1–TP4. 
Among these dyes, the DSSC based on TP3 exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with Jsc = 14.06 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.791 V, FF = 0.719, corresponding to the power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.00% (Fig. 5b and Table 2). Under the same conditions, other cells sensitized with the dyes TP1, TP2 and TP4 also showed attractive performances with Jsc of 14.87, 14.21 and 12.68 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.778, 0.790 and 0.801 V, and FF of 0.666, 0.686 and 0.693, corresponding to the η values of 7.71%, 7.70% and 7.05%, respectively. The most inferior photocurrent for the TP4-based solar cell is most likely attributed to the lowest dye loading (Table 2). The four photosensitizers exhibited relatively high Voc values in I−/I3− based DSSCs, in the range of 0.778–0.801 V. As compared to TP1, 3D structural TP2, TP3 and TP4 show higher Voc values. This can be attributed to the suppression of charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface by incorporating 3D bulky conjugated substituents on the N-atom of the phenothiazine core. The results illustrate that the introduction of the bulky substituents in the π-conjugated spacer in the orthogonal direction could suppress dye aggregation and retard charge recombination in DSSCs more effectively than the linear alkyl chain.

2.6. Photophysical and photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on co-sensitization of TP3 and YR6
In order to realize a panchromatic absorption in DSSCs, the reported NIR dye YR6 was selected to co-sensitize with TP3 to enhance the light harvesting efficiency due to their complementary absorption properties. Fig. S2† shows the co-adsorption spectrum of the two dyes on TiO2 films immersed in TP3 and YR6 solutions at varied molar ratios. The spectrum shows a broad absorption from 400 nm to 750 nm. The absorption of the co-sensitized films displayed an obvious enhancement of light absorption in the NIR region when compared with the individually sensitized films. Notably, the absorption peaks in the NIR region were red-shifted by 10 nm after co-sensitization, which indicates that the adsorption of TP3 could largely suppress the aggregation of the NIR dye YR6 on the TiO2 surface as a consequence of the 3D bulky repulsion by TP3. At the same time, the light harvesting efficiency can be effectively improved by the co-sensitization of TP3 and YR6 with complementary absorption bands.
The IPCE spectra of devices sensitized by TP3, YR6 and co-sensitization of the two dyes are plotted as a function of excitation wavelength and presented in Fig. 6a. The IPCE spectra of TP3/YR6 co-sensitized DSSCs show an impressive panchromatic response from 300 to 750 nm. As expected, the IPCE performances of co-sensitized DSSCs are better than those of the cells based on TP3 and YR6 alone. Also, it was found that the IPCEs of the co-sensitized devices were strongly dependent on the molar ratios of the two dyes in solutions. When the co-sensitized cell was prepared at the TP3/YR6 molar ratio of 25:1, the device exhibited the largest IPCE increase in the 650–750 nm region from ∼20% to ∼50%, which contributes to the higher photocurrent.
 Fig. 6  IPCE spectra (a) and J–V curves (b) of DSSCs based on TP3, YR6 and co-sensitization of the two dyes. 
The J–V curves for the cells based on TP3, YR6 and co-sensitization of the two dyes are presented in Fig. 6b and the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 3. The η of the devices based on individual TP3 and YR6 are 8.00% and 2.16%, respectively. To optimize the co-sensitization process for better photovoltaic performance, we investigated five devices at different dye-loading molar ratios, coded as A–E. It was observed that all of the co-sensitized solar cells showed much higher photocurrent and efficiency than the individual dye-sensitized solar cells. The performance of device A containing TP3 and YR6 in a solution of molar ratio 500:1 led to the η value of 8.58%, and it increased to 9.17% for device B and 9.28% for device C when the devices were prepared at the TP3/YR6 molar ratios of 100:1 and 50:1, respectively. When the TP3/YR6 molar ratio reached 25:1, the device D yielded the best performance with a short circuit current density of 19.18 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.721 V and a fill factor of 0.712, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 9.84%. A further increase of the TP3/YR6 molar ratio to 10:1 (device E) led to a decreased efficiency of 8.42%. The observed trend is qualitatively consistent with the photoresponse capabilities of the five devices as illustrated by IPCE spectra.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis has been performed to elucidate the interfacial charge recombination process under a forward bias of −0.73 V in the dark. As shown in Fig. 7a, a major semicircle for each device was observed in the Nyquist plot, which is related to the resistance of charge transfer processes at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface, i.e., the recombination kinetics between the charge on TiO2 film and I3− species from the electrolyte.13 In general, the resistance value (Rrec) corresponds to the diameters of the semicircles; a smaller Rrec value indicates a faster charge recombination, thus giving a lower Voc.14 The Rrec values for these devices increase in the order E < D < C < B < A. The trend observed here is consistent with the results obtained for the Voc values, i.e., the Voc values increased from 0.709 V to 0.780 V on increasing the molar concentration of TP3 from 10:1 to 500:1. The results suggest that TP3 with a 3D structure can form a good blocking layer between TiO2 and the electrolyte, suppressing the charge recombination between the injected electron in the TiO2 conduction band and I3− in the electrolyte. Though the co-adsorbent of YR6 lessened the photovoltage a little, the photocurrent related to the light-harvesting capability was strengthened significantly, giving rise to a highly elevated photovoltaic efficiency.
 Fig. 7  EIS Nyquist plots (a) and open circuit voltage decay profiles (b) for DSSCs based on these devices. 
To further probe the charge recombination kinetics of the devices, open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was recorded to illustrate the lifetime of Voc from an illuminated quasi-equilibrium state to dark equilibrium. Fig. 7b shows the OCVD profiles of devices A to E. The correlation between Voc decay and electron lifetime (τn) can be described by the following equation:  where KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and e is the positive elementary charge.15 Therefore, electron lifetimes in solar cells can be extracted from the slope of Voc decay curves. As a consequence, when the devices were prepared at different TP3/YR6 molar ratios from 500:1 to 10:1, the slope became steeper and steeper, indicating that the electron lifetimes were gradually reduced with the decrease in the molar concentration of TP3. These are well consistent with the EIS spectra which indicate that decreasing the molar concentration of TP3 would lead to faster charge recombination at the interface.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully developed a series of new 3D bulky phenothiazine-cored organic photosensitizers for DSSC applications. Compared with TP1, TP2–TP4 featuring a 3-dimensional bulky structure exhibited a bathochromic shift in wavelength on TiO2 films, and the suppression of dye aggregation and reduced charge recombination, leading to better DSSC performance. Impressively, the co-adsorbent-free DSSCs based on TP3 showed the highest efficiency of 8.00%. Subsequently, the organic dye TP3 with strong UV-visible absorption and excellent performance in co-adsorbent-free DSSCs was co-sensitized with the near-infrared (NIR) absorbing squaraine dye YR6 to realize UV-visible-NIR light-harvesting capability, which effectively suppressed the dye aggregation of YR6 with a planar structure and retarded the charge recombination in co-sensitized DSSCs. Upon optimization, the co-sensitized DSSCs exhibited remarkable overall efficiency enhancements of 33% and 356% as compared with the devices based on TP3 and YR6 alone, respectively, and the highest PCE of 9.84% was achieved at the TP3/YR6 molar ratio of 25:1. To our knowledge, such a value of η also represents the highest efficiency ever reported in the literature for squaraine dye-based co-sensitized DSSCs.

The starting materials phenothiazine and 2-cyanoacetic acid were purchased commercially. TiO2 paste and iodide-based liquid electrolyte (HL-HPE) were purchased from Dyesol Company. The synthetic routes to phenothiazine-based dyes TP1–TP4 are outlined in Scheme S1† and the details are depicted.
4.2. General procedures for the preparation of TP1–TP4
A mixture of each of the precursors 4a–4d (0.20 mmol) and cyanoacetic acid (89 mg, 1.10 mmol) in acetic acid (20 mL) was refluxed in the presence of ammonium acetate (200 mg) overnight under a N2 atmosphere. Then, water was added and extracted with CH2Cl2.

4.3. Characterizations

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Ultrashield 400 Plus NMR spectrometer. The high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were obtained with a Bruker Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The UV-visible absorption spectra of these dyes were measured in CH2Cl2 solution with a Varian Cary 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) were measured with a Versastat II electrochemical work station using a normal three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire auxiliary electrode and a saturated Ag/Ag+ reference electrode in KNO3 aqueous solution; 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF4) was used as the supporting electrolyte in CH2Cl2 solution. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene after each set of measurements, and all potentials mentioned in the work were against the normal hydrogen electrode.
4.4. Fabrication and characterization of cells
To make a reasonable comparison, all the anode films for DSSCs were made in the same standard manner, which are composed of a 12 µm thick transparent layer (TiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 20 nm) and a 6 µm thick scattering layer (TiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 200 nm). In particular, the doctor-blade technique was utilized to prepare photoanode (TiO2) films. Firstly, a layer of (ca. 6 µm) TiO2 paste (20 nm) was doctor-bladed onto the FTO conducting glass and then relaxed at room temperature for 3 min before heating at 150 °C for 6 min. This procedure was repeated once to achieve a film thickness of ca. 12 µm and the resulting surface was finally coated with a scattering layer (ca. 6 µm) of TiO2 paste (200 nm). The electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 275 °C for 5 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min and 470 °C for 30 min to remove polymers and generate a three-dimensional TiO2 nanoparticle network. After that, the sintered films were soaked in 0.02 M TiF4 aqueous solution for 45 min at 70 °C, washed with deionized water, and further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to ca. 80 °C, the electrodes were immersed into a 5 × 10−4 M TPn or 5 × 10−4 M YR6 dye bath in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio, 1:1) solution and maintained in the dark for 16 h. For the co-sensitized solar cells, TP3 and YR6 dyes of the same concentration (5 × 10−4 M) were mixed in different volume ratios, 500:1, 100:1, 50:1, 25:1 and 10:1. Afterwards, the electrodes were rinsed with ethanol to remove the non-adsorbed dyes and dried in air. Pt counter electrodes were prepared by the sputtering method at 15 mA for 90 s at a power of 150 W. Two holes (0.75 mm in diameter) were pre-drilled in the FTO glass for introducing the electrolyte. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled in a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt Parafilm at about 100 °C. The liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI, and 0.05 M I2 in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio, 1:1) was introduced into the cell through the drilled holes at the back of the counter electrode. Finally, the holes were sealed by using a Parafilm and covering glass (0.1 mm thickness) at an elevated temperature. The effective areas of all the TiO2 electrodes were 0.24 cm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled DSSCs were measured with a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 236) at room temperature in air under the spectral output from a solar simulator (Newport) using an AM 1.5 G filter with a light power of 100 mW cm−2. IPCEs of DSSCs were recorded using a Solar Cell QE/IPCE Measurement System (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100) in DC mode. A CHI 660D electrochemical workstation was used to characterize the electrochemical properties of the DSSCs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded under dark conditions over a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV and the parameters were calculated using Z-View software (v2.1b, Scribner Associates, Inc.).
