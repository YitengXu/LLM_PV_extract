    , Accepted 1st October 2020First published on 6th October 2020AbstractWe demonstrate that arrays of Ni3B/Fe2O3 nanotubes (NTAs) supported by a Fe foil can simultaneously boost the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) after exposure to visible light radiation (OER and HER overpotentials decreased by 162 and 150 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively). With a small band gap, Fe2O3 efficiently harnesses solar energy for the overall photoelectrochemical water splitting. Consequently, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 requires only 1.50 V under one-sun illumination. Surface and spectroscopic analyses indicate that photoholes at the Fe2O3 NTAs transfer to Ni3B, rendering the Ni3B surface easier to oxidize into β-Ni(OH)2, which is ultimately converted into the OER-catalyzing γ-NiOOH species at a relatively low anodic potential. Photoelectrons become localized at the HER-active Ni sites in Ni3B. This work integrates photochemistry with electrocatalysis, affording a new avenue for developing high-performance and cost-effective photoelectrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive route to produce hydrogen, a gas that is storable and environmentally sustainable.1 The PEC water splitting involves two half-reactions: the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Various n-type and p-type semiconductors have been examined as electrode materials for the OER and HER.2 Despite the tremendous effort, the solar conversion efficiency of PEC water splitting is limited by the large band gaps of many semiconductors, fast electron–hole recombination rates, and inactive catalytic sites.3 Many strategies have been explored to address these limitations.4,5 Some representative approaches include doping semiconductors to enhance absorption in the visible light spectrum,6 using electrocatalysts to separate photogenerated carriers while rendering new catalytic sites at the surface,7,8 and fabricating heterostructures to accelerate charge transport.9,10
The optimal working conditions for OER catalysts are generally different from those for their HER counterparts.11 Consequently, in most applications, the performance of OER and HER catalysts is compromised.12 A single catalyst that can simultaneously lower the OER and HER overpotentials (i.e., a bifunctional catalyst) is most desirable. Although many strategies have been developed, there are only a few reports about utilizing photochemistry to enhance the activity of electrocatalysts. Along this line, bifunctional electrocatalysts that can increase the number of high-valence active intermediates for the OER and enrich electrons at surface sites for the HER have been investigated.13–16 With the inherent surface plasmon resonance effect, Au nanorods have been shown to increase the carrier density of MoS2 to catalyze the HER.17 The photogenerated holes on Au nanoparticles, on the other hand, can effectively trap the electrons from Ni(OH)2, favoring the formation of active Ni(III/IV) species at solid Ni(OH)2 to enhance the OER activity.18 However, the high cost of gold as the catalyst or a major additive is prohibitive for industrial H2 production. Zhang and coworkers demonstrated that Ni/NiO nanosheets supported by a Ni foam are bifunctional, with NiO serving as the light-harvesting semiconductor and OER-active species and Ni acting as the HER-active component.13 The main limitation is the large band gap of NiO (Eg = 3.6–4.0 eV),19 which can only be overcome by radiation of UV light in the solar spectrum. We envision that additives capable of attenuating this large band gap for greater absorption of visible light should help improve the solar energy conversion and the resultant catalytic activity.
Fe2O3 has been widely applied to PEC water splitting due to its high earth abundance, nontoxicity, and stability.8,20–23 Particularly noteworthy is that the suitable energy band gap (Eg = 2.1 eV) enables absorption of as high as 40% of solar radiation.8,21,22,24 Recently, nickel borides (NiBx) have shown electrocatalytic activities towards both the OER and HER.25–28 It has been reported that boron does not act as the active center for the OER or HER. Instead, it assists in the formation of active transition-metal oxyhydroxides for the OER and accumulation of electrons at metal sites for the HER.29 Based on these characteristics, we explored the combination of Fe2O3 and NiBx as a heterostructure for enhanced PEC catalysis. We show here that radiation of visible light can generate abundant charge carriers in Fe2O3, which subsequently flow to Ni3B to catalyse both the OER and HER. We found that arrays of Ni3B/Fe2O3 nanotubes (NTAs) supported by a Fe foil accelerate the OER and HER under visible light more significantly than Fe2O3-only systems. Our PEC cell, constructed with an anode and a cathode using the same Fe-foil-supported Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs, requires only 1.50 V to produce a current density of 10 mA cm−2 under one-sun illumination. This is lower than that obtained with the Ni/NiO photoelectrocatalyst (∼1.63 V), one of the best bifunctional catalysts developed thus far for the overall water splitting.13
Experimental section
Materials and reagents
Iron foil pieces (99.999% purity, 0.25 mm in thickness) and graphite plates (99.95% purity, 0.2 mm in thickness) were purchased from Incoatm Co. Ltd (Shenyang, China). Sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98.0%), NH4F (96.0%), KOH (99.0%), and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4, 80%) were obtained from Ida Co. Ltd (Tianjin, China). Ethylenediamine (99.0%), NiCl2·6H2O (98.0%), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (98.0%), NaOH (98.0%), ethylene glycol (99.0% purity), acetone (99.5%), ethanol (99.7%) and other reagents of analytical grade were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used as received. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments.
Photoelectrocatalyst preparation
Fe2O3 NTAs were prepared by anodization of Fe foil pieces.23 Before anodization, the Fe foil pieces (1.0 × 2.0 cm) were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water three times. The cleaned Fe foil pieces were anodized at 50 V for 180 s in a 60 °C ethylene glycol solution containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and 3 vol% H2O. A platinum flag was used as the cathode. After oxidation, the Fe2O3 NTAs were rinsed with water and dried in air. The resulting amorphous Fe2O3 NTAs were annealed at 400 °C for 30 min in air with a heating and cooling rate of 5 °C min−1.
A layer of Ni3B was deposited on each Fe2O3 NTAs/Fe foil by an electroless plating method. An aqueous solution containing 126 mM NiCl2 was maintained below 10 °C in an ice-bath. An ethylenediamine solution (20 wt%, 5 mL) was slowly added into the NiCl2 solution under sonication. The color of the mixture changed from green to dark violet. A mixture of 47.5 mM NaBH4 and 325 mM NaOH at pH 13.5 was then poured into the NiCl2/ethylenediamine solution under intense stirring. A piece of the annealed Fe2O3 NTAs/Fe foil was immersed in the above electroless plating solution at 85 °C for 40 min. The Fe2O3 NTAs were covered with a Ni3B film. The Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs were rinsed with water and ethanol to remove impurities at the surface, and vacuum-dried at 50 °C. The as-prepared Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs were further calcined at 250 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere.
NiOOH/Fe2O3 NTAs were synthesized through an electrodeposition procedure.30 NiOOH was electrodeposited onto an annealed Fe2O3 NTAs/Fe foil sample in a 25 mM Ni(NO3)2 solution at −0.48 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 10 s. After electrodeposition, the NiOOH/Fe2O3 NTAs were rinsed with water and dried in air.
Characterization
The phase structures of the catalyst samples were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The morphology and microstructure of the catalyst samples were examined with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM 6700F) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEOL, JEM 2100F), both of which were equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis unit (Oxford). The oxidation states of the constituent elements of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs before and after the OER were analyzed using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Shimadzu, AXIS Ultra Supra) using a monochromatized Al source (1486.6 eV). Binding energies were determined using the C 1s peak (at 284.8 eV) from adventitious carbon as a reference. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluorolog-3, HORIBA, Kyoto, Japan) at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
An electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, CH Instruments, Austin, TX, U.S.A.) was used for all the electrochemical experiments. The Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs served as the working electrode, a graphite plate as the auxiliary electrode, and a Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was an oxygen-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution. The potentials measured vs. Hg/HgO were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale, according to the equation ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.059 × pH. In some cases, a 300 W Xe lamp (Ceaulight Inc., Beijing, China) equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter was used as the light source. The light intensity was measured using a radiation power meter (Model FZ-A, Beijing Normal University Photoelectric Inc., Beijing, China) and adjusted to be one sun. The polarization curves were recorded by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) from 0.92 to 1.81 V vs. RHE at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1 with 90% iR compensation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed with an amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. Curve fitting was performed using the Zview2 software (Scribner Associates Inc, Southern Pines, NC). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained from an IPCE instrument (Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co., Ltd., IPCE1000). The absorbed photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (APCE) was calculated using the equation APCE = [IPCE/(1 − 10−A)] × 100%,31 where A is the light absorbance of the photoelectrode. The injection efficiency (ηinj.) and charge separation efficiency (ηsep.) were calculated using the following equations:32,33ηinj. = Jethanol/JKOH × 100%ηsep. = Jethanol/Jabs. × 100%where Jethanol is the photocurrent density measured in 1.0 M KOH solution with 0.5 M ethanol as a hole scavenger, JKOH the photocurrent density measured in 1.0 M KOH solution, and Jabs. the theoretical maximum photocurrent density on Fe2O3 under AM 1.5G solar irradiation (11.4 mA cm−2).32,34

Ex situ and in situ Raman spectroscopy of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs during the OER

Ex situ and in situ Raman spectra were collected using a confocal Raman microscope (Model Via Reflex, Gloucestershire, Renishaw) coupled with an Olympus 10× objective. The excitation source was a frequency-doubled 532 nm Nd:YAG laser, with the laser power reduced to 100 mW. All in situ Raman characterization was performed using a spectro-electrochemical cell (ECC-Opto-Std-Aqu, EL-Cell GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) that uses an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The potentials measured were converted to the RHE scale. Each in situ Raman spectrum was collected with an acquisition time of 15 s in a 1100 cm−1 range. Spectral shifts were calibrated routinely against the value of 520.7 cm−1 using a silicon wafer.
Faradaic efficiency
The amounts of O2 and H2 generated during photoelectrolysis were measured using a classic water drainage method.35 The faradaic efficiency was deduced by comparing the experimentally measured gas amount with the theoretical value according to the following equation: faradaic efficiency = (m × n × F)/(I × t), where m is the amount of product in moles, n the number of electrons transferred, F the Faraday constant, I the current value, and t the reaction time.
Results and discussion
Photochemical electrocatalyses of the OER and HER by Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs

Scheme 1 illustrates the movement of photogenerated holes/electrons in our PEC cell during the overall water splitting reaction. Absorption of UV-visible light by Fe2O3, which has a lower band gap than NiO, readily produces hole/electron pairs. At the anode, the photogenerated holes transfer from Fe2O3 to Ni3B, promoting the adsorption of OH− ions on Ni sites to form Ni(OH)2 and converting the inactive Ni(II) into OER-active Ni(III/IV). Under the influence of an external potential, the photogenerated electrons move to the cathode and aggregate at the HER-active Ni sites in Ni3B to catalyze the HER.
 Scheme 1  Movement of photogenerated holes/electrons in the water-splitting reaction. 
We first investigated the catalysis of OER by the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs in the dark (black curves in Fig. 1) and under one-sun radiation (red curves), and compared the results to those by the Fe2O3 NTAs under the same experimental conditions (green and blue curves). From the LSVs collected at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs, the overpotential for generating a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10) under radiation is 233 mV, as opposed to 395 mV in the dark. In stark contrast, at the bare Fe2O3 NTAs, instead of a decrease, η10 is 480 mV under radiation. In the dark, the Fe2O3 NTAs are inactive towards the OER, and a current density of 10 mA cm−2 could not be attained at the potentials used to obtain the polarization curves. These results indicate that the charge carriers from photoexcited Fe2O3 boost the OER kinetics at the Fe2O3 NTAs and the Ni3B/Fe2O3 heterostructure facilitates the charge transfer. The cumulative effect leads to a sustained acceleration of the OER. Moreover, the difference between the photocurrent and dark current density at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs increases with the applied potential (Eapp.) indicating that more active species are generated at high potentials under radiation (vide infra).
 Fig. 1  Polarization curves (a and c) and Tafel plots (b and d) recorded at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs and bare Fe2O3 NTAs during the OER (a and b) and HER (c and d) in the dark and under radiation of one sun. The inset of (c) shows chronoamperomograms recorded from the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs (red curve) and bare Fe2O3 NTAs (blue curve) at −0.1 V under chopped one-sun radiation. 
The Tafel plots (Fig. 1b) were recorded to gauge the effect of radiation on the kinetics of the OER. The Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs exhibit a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec−1 under radiation (red line), which is substantially lower than that in the dark (139 mV dec−1 obtained from the black line). The Tafel slope is widely used to determine the rate-determining step for the OER.36–38 A Tafel slope value close to 120 mV dec−1 indicates that the OH− ion adsorption on the active sites should be the rate-determining step.39 The sharp decrease in the Tafel slope under radiation supports our contention that the transfer of photogenerated holes from Fe2O3 to Ni3B promotes markedly the adsorption of OH− ions on Ni sites. In contrast, visible light irradiation onto the Fe2O3 NTAs causes only a small decrease in the Tafel slope (180 mV dec−1 under radiation vs. 190 mV dec−1 in the dark). These results clearly show that the Ni3B/Fe2O3 heterostructure accelerates the OER kinetics rapidly under UV-visible light radiation. Remarkably, the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs also exhibit improved HER catalysis under radiation. As shown by the polarization curves (Fig. 1c), the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs exhibits a η10 of only 127 mV under radiation (red line), which is less than half of that obtained in the dark (277 mV, black line). It is evident that the opposite occurred at the bare Fe2O3 NTAs, as the η10 value increased to 154 mV under radiation (blue line) and 172 mV in the dark (green line). The peak at ca. −0.23 V is attributed to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 (ref. 40 and 41) during the HER. The inset of Fig. 1c compares chronoamperomograms collected from the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs and bare Fe2O3 NTAs at −0.1 V under chopped one-sun radiation. Both the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs and bare Fe2O3 NTAs exhibit instantaneous and reproducible responses to on–off illumination cycles. Obviously, the current densities are augmented upon radiation. The value of transient current density (ΔJ, difference between photocurrent and dark current density) at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs (−345 ± 5 μA cm−2) is almost three-fold that at the Fe2O3 NTAs (−117 ± 5 μA cm−2). These results suggest that the photogenerated electrons from excited Fe2O3 can boost the HER performance of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs. Fig. 1d shows that the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs exhibit a smaller Tafel slope (92 mV dec−1) under radiation than in the dark (288 mV dec−1), suggesting that the HER kinetics at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs is accelerated by photoexcitation. This is contrary to that observed at the bare Fe2O3 NTAs where the Tafel slope in the dark, 165 mV dec−1, decreased only by 15 mV dec−1 under radiation. Thus, the transfer of photogenerated electrons from Fe2O3 to Ni3B results in an enrichment of electrons at Ni3B (cf.Scheme 1), hastening the HER kinetics.
Stability of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs during the OER and HER photoelectrocatalyses
Photoelectrocatalytic stability is an important property of a bifunctional catalyst. We used chronoamperometry to examine the long-term stability of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs during the OER and HER. Under radiation, η10 for OER decreased by 7 mV in the first hour and increased by only 12 mV in the following 11 h (red curve in Fig. 2a). This stability is superior to those of the Co–Ni–B/Ni and NixB/Ni catalysts.35,42 A greater change (20 mV; the black curve) was observed in the dark. In a 12 h HER test, the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs showed an increase in η10 of only 29 mV under radiation (red curve in Fig. 2b), which is considerably lower than that in the dark (51 mV; the black curve). Thus, the stability of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs under radiation is higher than that in the dark. This is likely due to the enhanced charge transport under radiation. The Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs exhibit a much lower charge transfer resistance under radiation than in the dark (8.44 Ω vs. 13.17 Ω as shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the ESI†). Therefore, radiation is essential for enhancing charge transfer at the catalyst/solution interface.

Electrocatalytic water splitting under radiation
The performance of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs as a bifunctional (photo)electrocatalyst for the PEC water splitting was further examined in a two-electrode configuration. As shown in Fig. 3a, when the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs anode and cathode are both irradiated, the net cell voltage is 1.50 V to produce 10 mA cm−2. An improvement of 0.13 V was achieved over that operated in the dark. This is also better than that of the Ni/NiO photoelectrocatalysts (∼1.63 V).13 The faradaic efficiency of the PEC water splitting reaction was measured at a large current density (40 mA cm−2) to generate sufficient H2 and O2. In Fig. 3b, the faradaic efficiency was determined to be 98% and the amounts of O2 and H2 collected are in excellent agreement with the theoretical values. The excellent linearity of the plots would not be attainable had the stability of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTA catalyst deteriorated rapidly in alkaline solution.

Effects of radiation on the electrocatalysis of OER
The η10 value for OER at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs decreased gradually from 10 to 60 min of UV-visible light irradiation and stabilized with a net change of 0.233 V beyond 60 min (Fig. 4a). The spectra overlaid in the inset of Fig. 4a exhibit two characteristics. The peak at 1.43 V can be assigned to the irreversible oxidation of the unstable phases of Ni3B (ref. 43) and the peak at ca. 1.39 V is attributable to the oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III/IV).13,44,45 Ni(II) species are formed from nickel oxidation when Ni3B is exposed to air and/or water, consistent with our XPS results (vide infra). OER catalysts generally undergo chemical, structural, and phase changes in strong alkaline solutions at different potentials.46 As the irradiation time increases, the Ni(II) oxidation peak shifts to a less positive potential. For example, the oxidation peak is 1.37 V under radiation for 60 min, a 23 mV negative shift when compared to that under radiation for only 10 min. This shift suggests that Ni(II) has become easier to oxidize upon irradiation. The fact that the peak current increases with the extent of radiation is indicative of the photo-assisted production of the high-valence OER-active Ni(III/IV) species. Ni(III/IV) converted in situ from Ni(II) in the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs exhibit a higher PEC OER activity than in the NiOOH/Fe2O3 NTAs (Fig. S2†). Our previous work showed that metalloid boron in iron boride nanowires can modulate the electronic structure of iron, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance the hydrophilic surface.47 Hence, the composition and surface structure contribute to the high catalytic activity. Similar transition metal borides were also reported to possess high electrocatalytic activities for the OER.14,25,26,42,47–50

Fig. 4b shows the OER polarization curves at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs and bare Fe2O3 NTAs under repeated on–off one-sun radiation sequences. The Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs exhibit a photocurrent density increase at 1.23 V and a negative shift of the onset potential in comparison to the bare Fe2O3 NTAs. Fig. S3a† further shows the LSV curves at the bare and Fe2O3 NTAs modified with Ni3B using different deposition times (5, 10, 20, and 30 min) under repeated on–off radiation sequences. The Fe2O3 NTAs modified with Ni3B using 20 min deposition are the most active, exhibiting a significant enhancement in ΔJ (from 20.7 ± 0.1 μA cm−2 at the bare Fe2O3 NTAs to 45.7 ± 0.3 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V as shown in Fig. S3b†), and a negative shift of onset potential from 0.776 V at the bare Fe2O3 NTAs to 0.619 V (Fig. S3c†). Note that ΔJ increases with the Eapp. from 0.60 to 1.20 V at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs (Fig. 4b). This is expected as the photogenerated holes transfer to Ni3B at the electrode/solution interface, oxidizing OH− at low potentials. However, ΔJ begins to decrease beyond 1.20 V. The ΔJ value at 1.30 V (32.5 μA cm−2) is lower than that at 1.20 V (54.7 μA cm−2). This behavior can be rationalized by the fact that some photogenerated holes that transferred to the Ni3B layer are involved in the oxidation of Ni(0/II) at 1.20 V or higher, enhancing the electrocatalysis of the OER (cf.Scheme 1). Similar surface state recombination in a PEC water splitting process was also reported in connection with the α-Fe2O3/NiOOH catalyst.51 The OER polarization curves at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs (Fig. 4c) are dependent on the wavelength of the incident light. The Fe2O3 NTAs absorb below 600 nm (cf. the UV-visible spectrum in the inset). This is consistent with our finding that the OER catalysis is much more pronounced at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm. Particularly noteworthy is that green (520 nm) and blue (420 nm) radiation is more efficient than UV (365 nm) for lowing the OER overpotential. The Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs yielded the highest IPCE and APCE values at 520 nm (Fig. S4†). With 20 min deposition of Ni3B, they are 16.69% and 39.70% at 1.23 V, respectively. The greater absorption of our catalyst in the visible region is an attractive feature. Holes in Fe2O3 generated by the visible light produce high-valence Ni(III/IV) species for the enhanced OER catalysis. We should note that lower activities have been reported for more expensive catalysts such as Ni(OH)2–Au (ref. 18) and Ni/NiO.13
PL emission is a useful tool for probing electron–hole recombination.52–54 Compared to that at the bare Fe2O3 NTAs, the PL intensity at the Fe2O3 NTAs modified with Ni3B using 20 min deposition is quenched by about 97%, indicating that the electron–hole recombination has been largely suppressed (Fig. 4d). The fluorescence decay is an indirect measure of the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers.53,54 Deposition of Ni3B increases the fluorescence decay of Fe2O3 NTAs (inset of Fig. 4d). The fluorescence lifetime decreases with Ni3B deposition (Table S2†). Thus, Ni3B retards the hole/electron recombination and promotes the charge carrier separation.
To quantitatively analyze the hole/electron separation efficiency, ethanol as a hole scavenger was added into the electrolyte. Fig. 4e shows the ηsep. of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs and bare Fe2O3 NTAs. The bare Fe2O3 NTAs possess inferior ηsep. at various Eapp.. Remarkably, the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs exhibit improved ηsep. from 1.35 V, where Ni(III/IV) species are produced. This indicates that Ni3B significantly suppresses the bulk hole/electron recombination through trapping the photogenerated holes. An excellent ηsep. value of 81% of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs is observed at 1.50 V, which is superior to those of reported Fe2O3-based photoanodes (about 20%–35%).20,32,34 The injection of holes from photoanodes into electrolytes is correlated to the surface hole/electron recombination.32,34 Compared to bare Fe2O3 NTAs, the ηinj of Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs increase throughout the entire potential range used (Fig. 4f). Benefitted from the Eapp. and the catalytic effect of Ni3B, the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs reach a ηinj value of 90.04% at 1.84 V, which means that most of the photogenerated holes reacted with OH− to produce oxygen, and this value is over five-fold that at the bare Fe2O3 NTAs (17.27%) indicating that Ni3B promotes the injection of photogenerated holes into the electrolyte and suppresses the surface hole/electron recombination.
In Scheme 2, we schematically depict the movement of photogenerated holes/electrons in the OER and the effect of Ni3B deposited onto the Fe2O3 surface. At the bare Fe2O3 NTAs, the photogenerated holes recombine with electrons extensively, and only a small fraction moves to the electrode/solution interface to initiate the OH− oxidation. At the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs, when Eapp. < 1.20 V, most of the holes are trapped by the Ni3B sites present at the Ni3B–Fe2O3 interface, prolonging the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers. At Eapp. > 1.20 V, the current densities increase sharply because the holes help form highly electrocatalytic active Ni(III/IV) species.

We used in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy to monitor changes at high potentials. Fig. 5 shows an overlay of Raman spectra collected at different potentials under 532 nm radiation. The Raman peak at ∼123 cm−1 can be ascribed to the B–O–B stretching inherent in metaborate species.25,55,56 The peak at 1636 cm−1 is attributed to the characteristic H–O–H bending of water.11,44 We found that the active vibrational modes between 400 and 600 cm−1 are dependent on the Eapp.. The peak at 493 cm−1 recorded within the range of 1.23–1.33 V can be attributed to the A1g stretching vibration mode of Ni–O in β-Ni(OH)2.57–59 The presence of Ni(II) confirms that Ni(0) is oxidized during the catalyst synthesis, consistent with our XPS results (vide infra). The electrode surface undergoes a phase transformation between 1.33 and 1.35 V, in line with our LSV results (inset of Fig. 4a). The two peaks at 474 and 554 cm−1 observed within 1.35–1.41 V are ascribed to the eg bending and A1g stretching vibration modes of Ni–O in NiOOH.44,58,59 Based on the relative intensities of these two peaks, we assigned 3.3–3.7 to the Ni valence states in γ-NiOOH.57,60 As noted earlier, a Ni valence state higher than +2 is beneficial for water oxidation to oxygen.11 The two peaks at 474 and 554 cm−1 increased as β-Ni(OH)2 was converted into γ-NiOOH, and the 493 cm−1 peak disappeared once the conversion was complete. These results suggest that the Ni–O bond becomes stabilized at high potentials. At the NiO sites on Ni foams, the peaks at 474 and 554 cm−1 appear at 1.44 V.44 The peaks at a lower potential (1.35 V) at our catalyst indicates that the Ni3B/Fe2O3 heterostructure promotes the formation of Ni(III) species that is favorable for enhanced OER catalysis. The three Fe(III)-containing species, Fe2O3, FeOOH, and NiFe2O4, should exhibit Raman peaks within 650–740 cm−1.45,58,61,62 However, our in situ Raman spectra did not show the presence of these species. We therefore believe that OH− ions from the alkaline electrolyte adsorb on the Ni sites as the OH intermediates, OHad. Two OHad intermediates react with each other to form NiOOH, which can be further oxidized to O2 and H2O. Although Fe2O3 is a stronger Lewis acid than Ni(OH)2 and its interaction with OH− is stronger than that with Ni(OH)2,11 OH− absorption at Fe sites is inhibited as the surface of the Fe2O3 NTAs is partly covered by the Ni3B layer (Fig. S5–S7†). We posit that the transfer of photogenerated holes from Fe2O3 to Ni3B renders the Ni3B surface easier to oxidize to Ni(OH)2. This is likely the reason why Ni(OH)2 oxidation to NiOOH occurs at a relatively low anodic potential.

We used XPS to further determine the valence states of the elements in the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs before and after the OER. In the Ni 2p spectra (Fig. 6a), the peaks at 852.4 and 870 eV (colored magenta in the top panel) are assigned to metallic Ni0 in Ni3B,63,64 the blue-colored peak at 855.5 eV to Ni(II),42,45 and the green-colored peak at 856.8 eV in the bottom panel to Ni(III) in the nickel oxides/hydroxides (NiOxHy).65,66 NiOxHy is formed during nickel oxidation when Ni3B is exposed to air and water. This oxidation produces Ni3B@NiOxHy, a core/shell structure.42 The B 1s spectrum of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs shows a peak at 187.8 eV (green peak in the top panel of Fig. 6b), ascribable to metalloid boron.26,42,67 The broad peak at 192.3 eV in both panels can be assigned to boron–oxo species.65,68 As revealed in Fig. 6a and b, the Ni 2p3/2 binding energy decreased by 0.4 eV when compared to that of pure nickel (852.8 eV)28,35 and the B 1s binding energy is increased by 0.7 eV relative to that of boron (187.1 eV).28,35 These results are indicative of the electron transfer from boron to metallic nickel and formation of Ni3B in the catalyst. The transfer of electrons from boron to nickel weakens the metal–metal bonds and increases the electron density around the catalytic metal center.42,48,69 Such a change has been shown to accelerate the OER.25,58,70 Increased electron densities at the metal atoms, resulting from the electron redistribution, can also help accelerate the HER.29

The disappearance of the signals corresponding to metallic nickel and metalloid boron in the bottom panels of Fig. 6a and b indicates that substantial changes have taken place at the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs. The two peaks at 860.9 and 879.0 eV, corresponding to nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), have increased considerably. Thus, at least some of the nickel atoms are in higher valence states upon the OER catalysis. The peak associated with Fe(III) shifted to higher binding energy values after the OER (Fig. 6c). The peak heights of surface and lattice oxygen (Fig. 6d) increased and shifted to higher binding energy values. These results indicate that oxidation of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs had occurred at the surface during the OER. Similar results have been reported for catalysts comprising boron and other transition metals.26,35,42,48,49 It has been shown that the Ni(III/IV) species, being highly oxidative, are critically important for catalysing the OER.13,44,45,71 We believe that γ-NiOOH formed in situ is responsible for the high efficiency in the PEC catalysis of the OER. This reasoning is consistent with our in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 5) and LSV results (inset of Fig. 4a).
Structural and phase changes of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs after the OER and HER
We used HR-TEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy to probe structural and phase changes of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs brought about by the OER and HER. As shown in Fig. 7a, the Ni3B/Fe2O3 heterostructure is composed of amorphous and crystallographic domains. The lattice fringe spacing of 2.99 and 2.51 Å can be indexed to the Ni3B(111) plane (JPCDS card no. 48-1233) and Fe2O3(110) plane (JPCDS card no. 33-0664), respectively. The HR-TEM image in Fig. 7b shows that Ni3B had been converted into NiOOH after the OER. The lattice fringe spacing of 3.43 Å can be assigned to the NiOOH(006) plane (JPCDS card no. 06-0057). Unlike that in the case of OER, the phase of Ni3B remains unchanged after the HER. As shown in Fig. 7c, the fringe spacing of 2.24 Å can be indexed to the (201) plane of Ni3B (JPCDS card no. 48-1233).
 Fig. 7  HR-TEM images of Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs before (a) and after the OER (b) and HER (c). XRD patterns (d) and ex situ Raman spectra (e) of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs recorded before (black spectra) and after the OER (red spectra) and HER (blue spectra). 
The phase change of Ni3B during the OER was confirmed by XRD (Fig. 7d). Before the OER, the peak at 2θ of 44.7° is characteristic of the (102) plane of orthorhombic Ni3B (JCPDS no. 48-1223), and the peak at 35.6° corresponds to the (110) plane of hematite (Fe2O3, JCPDS no. 33-0664). After the OER, a new peak, ascribable to the (121) crystal phase of NiOOH (JCPDS no. 27-0956), appears at 57.2°. After the HER, the peaks belonging to Fe2O3 sharply decreased while the peak corresponding to Ni3B remained the same. This result is consistent with the LSV results (Fig. 1c) in that parts of Fe2O3 are reduced during the HER.
The Raman spectra of the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs obtained before and after the OER and HER are shown in Fig. 7e. We attributed the 474 and 554 cm−1 peaks at the anode after the OER to the eg bending and A1g stretching modes of Ni–O in γ-NiOOH.44,58,59 After the HER, the 493 cm−1 peak assigned to the A1g stretching mode of Ni–O for β-Ni(OH)2 (ref. 57–59) disappeared.
Taken together, γ-NiOOH formed in situ is responsible for the high efficiency in the PEC catalysis of OER. At the anode, the transfer of photogenerated holes from Fe2O3 to Ni3B enables the OH− adsorption on the Ni sites at the Ni3B surface to form β-Ni(OH)2, which is followed by a phase change to the OER-catalyzing γ-NiOOH. Radiation in the visible spectrum produces γ-NiOOH at a relatively low anodic potential. At the cathode, the photogenerated electrons aggregate at the HER-catalyzing Ni sites in Ni3B, and the transfer of electrons from B to the Ni sites in Ni3B increases the electron density around the catalytic Ni center.
Conclusions
We demonstrate that the Ni3B/Fe2O3 nanotube arrays supported by a Fe foil (Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs) and assisted with visible light radiation are an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. Both the OER and HER kinetics are significantly enhanced by the Ni3B/Fe2O3 NTAs. Our PEC cell resulted in a net cell voltage of only 1.50 V for the overall water splitting, which compares favorably to the Ni/NiO photoelectrocatalyst (net cell voltage ∼1.63 V). We attribute the improvement to the small bandgap of Fe2O3 that affords a more efficient harvest of visible light radiation compared to other materials with larger band gaps (e.g. NiO). The preferential OH− adsorption onto the Ni sites is retained for our photoelectrocatalyst, which is key to the formation of the OER-catalyzing γ-NiOOH species. The bifunctional Ni3B/Fe2O3 material exhibits an enhanced effect of photogenerated carriers on both the OER and HER kinetics compared to the Fe2O3-only catalyst. This work showcases the power of integrating photochemistry with electrocatalysis for lowering the energy demand of the overall water splitting reaction. With the single Ni3B/Fe2O3 heterostructure supported by inexpensive Fe foil as both cathode and anode, the PEC cell is simplified and the cost associated with electrode materials for hydrogen production is reduced.
