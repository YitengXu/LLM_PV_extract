    , Accepted 28th March 2019First published on 29th March 2019AbstractConversion of CO2 to value-added products is favorable for both greenhouse gas mitigation and carbon-resource utilization. It is still a huge challenge to efficiently, selectively, and economically convert CO2 to highly valuable products. Many reviews focusing on the catalysts and the products of CO2 transformation have been published. However, no comprehensive review of ionic liquid (IL)-mediated CO2 valorization has been published. Here, we provide a review of the IL-mediated conversion of CO2. During the conversion of CO2, ILs can act as solvents, electrolytes, CO2 absorbents, CO2 activating agents, catalysts or co-catalysts. The effects of cations, anions, alkyl chain length, and functional group of ILs, as well as temperature, pressure, other solvents, or co-catalysts on the catalytic efficiency and selectivity are discussed. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the recent experimental and theoretical progress of thermal, electrochemical and photochemical conversion of CO2 mediated by ILs and clarify the role of ILs in the process of CO2 conversion.
1. Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is composed of a carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, connected via covalent double bonds. A continuous increase of the CO2 amount in the atmosphere intensifies the greenhouse effect and leads to global warming.1 Besides, CO2 is deemed as an abundant, renewable and cheap C1 source for the production of chemicals and energy. Conversion of CO2 to value-added products can retard global warming and diminish the energy crisis.1 However, covalent double bonds make CO2 thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert; therefore, conversion of CO2 is hard to achieve.1 Due to the inertness of CO2, converting CO2 with high efficiency and selectivity usually requires a high-energy substrate to lower the Gibbs free energy, a favorable catalyst to reduce the energy barrier, reaction media (e.g., organic solvent, ionic liquids (ILs)) to stabilize the key intermediates, and/or a power source (e.g., thermal, electrochemical, or photochemical) to change the reaction route.
CO2 conversion usually proceeds via the following steps: (1) CO2 diffusion, (2) CO2 absorption on the catalyst, (3) CO2 conversion on the surface of a heterogeneous or a homogenous catalyst, (4) product desorption from the catalyst, (5) product diffusion into the solution/bulk phase or separation.1,2 CO2 absorption onto the catalyst can be achieved either by the same material or by two different materials. Both the CO2 capture and catalysis could be the rate determining steps. The capture and the separation of CO2 seem easier than CO2 conversion due to the fact that CO2 is chemically inert. But the high non-polarity and the weak acidity of CO2 molecules render the highly efficient and selective CO2 capture by many materials, such as ILs, organic porous polymers, and metal–organic frameworks.2–4 However, CO2 capture and separation still should be improved. Thus, both the CO2 capture and conversion are important for the value-added product formation from CO2.
The catalysts used for CO2 conversion are colorful; they include noble metals, non-noble metals, and metal-free materials.5–8 Noble metal-containing catalysts include pure noble metals with bulk states or nanoscale structures, noble-metal doped organic/inorganic/hybrid materials, and noble-metal-containing coordination complexes. The noble metals are Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au, and they are resistant to corrosion and oxidation in the air. The noble metals are rare and expensive, therefore, they are not favorable for large scale application as catalysts in the CO2 conversion. Therefore, the non-noble metal and the metal-free catalysts have attracted significant attention due to their low cost, high recyclability, and relatively high efficiency and selectivity.9 Post-transition metals, such as Ga, In, Sn, Ta, Pb and Bi, as a type of non-noble metal catalysts, are important for the conversion of CO2, particularly for the electrochemical catalysis.10 Other metals, such as Cu, Fe, and Ni, are also promising catalysts for the CO2 conversion.11 Graphene, carbon nanotubes, and porous organic polymers with task-specific groups are the typical metal-free catalysts for the CO2 conversion.12
Heat, electricity and light are the major forms of energy for the CO2 conversion to high value-added products. The efficiency of the thermal conversion of CO2 can be enhanced by lowering the energy barrier (using catalysts) to accelerate the reaction under the thermodynamically favorable conditions (by increasing the temperature and the CO2 pressure). Photo-conversion of CO2 requires the electron–hole separation from the photo-catalyst under the irradiation of light and the reduction of CO2 by the photo-generated electrons. However, the electrons, needed for the CO2 reduction using electro-catalysts, have to be generated by the external electricity sources. Due to being very convenient, clean, highly efficient, and selective, the electrochemical catalysis used for the CO2 conversion by electricity attracts a great deal of attention.5,13–18 Thermal, electrochemical, or photochemical conversion of CO2 into value-added products requires specific reaction media, such as ILs, for dissolving CO2, activating CO2, and helping to stabilize reaction key intermediates.
ILs are commonly composed of organic/inorganic cations and anions, remaining in a liquid state below 100 °C. High tunability, high stability, low pressure, high polarity and low melting point are the greatest advantages of ILs. The chemical structure and physical properties of ILs could be altered by selecting specific functional groups; the application of ILs could also be modified correspondingly. Thus, ILs have attracted much attention and have been applied in many fields, such as CO2 capture/conversion,19 biomass dissolution/conversion,20,21 SO2 uptake,22 materials synthesis, metal passivation,23 battery electrolyte production.24 Due to these merits, ILs are also called “solvents of the future”, “designer solvents”, or “green solvents and catalysts”.
ILs are favorable media for both CO2 capture and conversion. The earliest reported CO2 capture was accomplished using conventional ILs, such as [BMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6].25 CO2 capture was further improved by using the amine- or amino-containing ILs, either the cation, anion or both.26–35 Super-based or multi-sited ILs are also the promising absorbents with high CO2 capacity.36–44 Moreover, support of ILs on porous substrates and polymerization of ILs are common routes for the improvement of the CO2 absorption capacity.45,46 Usually, a high CO2 absorption capacity indicates a high extent of CO2 activation, followed by a low energy barrier for CO2 conversion. Therefore, numerous reports describing the CO2 conversion mediated by ILs relate to the above functionalization of ILs. This rule applies to all three forms of energy: heat,47–57 electricity58–60 and light.61,62 It also means that while designing new ILs, their high CO2 capacity should be considered, which is needed for the highly efficient and selective conversion of CO2 to value-added products.
The product distribution of the CO2 conversion mediated by ILs is far smaller than that of other systems. The IL-promoted thermal conversion of CO2 can generate products via CO2 hydrogenation and the C–O, C–N and C–S bond construction. Products of the CO2 hydrogenation mediated by ILs are mainly limited to HCOOH, CH4 and HCOOCH3. The C1 products of the electro-reduction of CO2 in ILs seem more colorful than those of the thermal CO2 hydrogenation in ILs. Construction of the C–C bond from CO2 by electrosynthesis is much easier than that by a thermal conversion. However, electrosynthesis of C–S constructed products has not been reported. The IL-promoted photo-catalysis and the photoelectrocatalysis of CO2 are seldom reported also. Therefore, it is necessary to review the effect of ILs on the thermal, electrochemical, and photochemical conversion of CO2 to understand the role of ILs and establish a methodology for the design of new ILs to obtain higher yield and selectivity.
The outline of this review is shown in Scheme 1. The key point is the CO2 conversion in the media of ILs. First, we summarize the product distribution and the corresponding reaction mechanism of the CO2 thermal conversion in the presence of ILs. Then, we review the CO2 electrochemical conversion products and the mechanism in the presence of ILs used as the electrolytes, solvents or co-catalysts. Finally, the photo-conversion or the photoelectron-conversion of CO2 mediated by ILs is discussed. The underlying role of ILs in these forms of CO2 conversion is also discussed. The abbreviations for the cations and the anions of ILs are listed in Table 1. The summary of the products of the CO2 conversion is shown in Tables 2–4.

2. Thermal conversion of CO2 mediated by ILs
2.1. CO2 hydrogenation
CO2 hydrogenation to produce chemicals and fuel as an energy-efficient route has attracted much attention in the chemical industry. CO2 can be hydrogenated into various products (e.g., HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4, listed in the order of decreasing valence) by altering the valence state of carbon atom.63,64 Particularly, long-chain hydrocarbons (e.g., C2–C4) are the major pursuit of the future research. Most commonly, metal catalysts are used for the hydrogenation of CO2.65,66 CO2 hydrogenation catalyzed by or mediated by ILs is very promising.64,67–69 The ultimate goal is to use metal-free ILs as catalysts and solvents for the CO2 hydrogenation to higher-chain carbonaceous products at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.63,70–73

2.1.1. HCOOH. 
HCOOH is the main reported product of the CO2 hydrogenation catalyzed by ILs. Han et al. developed a reaction/separation system for the synthesis of HCOOH from CO2 (4–18 MPa) and H2 (1–9 MPa) at 60 °C with the promotion of amino-based ILs by using Ru-immobilized silica as the heterogeneous catalyst.63 Subsequent product recovery and catalyst regeneration could be easily achieved via filtration and evaporation. The key point was to design a task-specific IL with a tertiary amino group on the cation that could form a salt with formic acid.63 However, the condition is still strict although some improvements are achieved by designing dual-amine-functionalized ILs.71 Srivastava et al. also tried to carry out the CO2 hydrogenation, mediated by amine-based ILs; however, high pressure, the presence of a metal, and other additives were also required.67,69,74 The efficiency of CO2 hydrogenation could be enhanced by increasing the interlayer space of the montmorillonite clay by using Ru ions and IL with a larger ion size than the original Na ion (Fig. 1).74 Dupont's group utilized RuFe as the catalyst and the conventional IL [BMIM][Ac] containing anions as the reaction media for the CO2 conversion at the lower pressure (1 MPa CO2 and 2 MPa H2) while introducing other co-solvents, such as H2O and DMSO (Fig. 2).64 HCOOH was produced with high values of TONs and TOF (400 and 23.52 h−1, respectively). The high efficiency was attributed to the structure of the IL cage around the RuFe nanoparticles and the basicity of ILs.64 Dupont further developed the multifunctional basic ILs (acting as Ru-catalyst stabilizer, acid buffer and entropic driver, Fig. 3) to promote the formation of HCOOH via CO2 hydrogenation at 70 °C, 2 MPa CO2 and 2 MPa H2 in the presence of H2O and DMSO.72 The favorable thermodynamic conditions promoted by the basic ILs resulted in high TON (17000), TOF and HCOOH concentration (1.2 M).72

 Fig. 2  ILs cage RuFe nanocatalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to HCOOH (basic IL) and hydrocarbons (nonbasic IL).64 
 Fig. 3  Multiple functions of the basic IL-mediated CO2 hydrogenation to HCOOH: catalyst stabilization, hydrogenation promotion, buffer pH stabilization and product separation.72 


2.1.2. CH4 and other hydrocarbons. 
In order to obtain C1–C21 hydrocarbons from the CO2 hydrogenation, Dupont et al. increased the temperature to 150 °C and the pressure to 1.7 MPa for CO2 and 6.8 MPa for H2 and avoided the usage of co-solvents (e.g., H2O and DMSO) by using RuFe as catalyst and [BMIM][Tf2N] as solvent.64 They used the nonbasic hydrophobic IL [BMIM][Tf2N] in a reaction with a similar mechanism to that of the basic IL (Fig. 2). The hydrocarbon production in the nonbasic IL media was a two-step process: CO2 conversion to CO by the reverse water-gas shift reaction on the surface of RuFe and the subsequent chain propagation via Fischer Tropsch synthesis.64 According to Dupont's report, high temperature, high pressure and the usage of precious RuFe catalyst were required for producing hydrocarbons. Branco et al. increased the temperature to 150 °C to obtain the best CH4 yield of 69% while keeping the comparable pressure (4–6 MPa H2 with a total H2/CO2 pressure of 8 MPa) by using Ru nanoparticles as the catalyst in [OMIM][Tf2N].69 Increasing the temperature or the amount of the catalyst improved the CH4 yield and the TON. Also, the TON increased at a higher rate from 140 °C to 150 °C and no product was obtained below 120 °C.69


2.1.3. HCOOCH3. 
Heldebrant et al. used the switchable ILs for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate at 110 °C and 2 MPa H2, employing the Ru-based catalyst and excess base. Methyl formate and water were the products at 140 °C in the presence of excess alcohol.70 The pathways were proposed to have three steps: (1) the carbonate-based IL formation via the capture and activation of CO2 by DBU and methanol, (2) formate-based IL formation by hydrogenation of carbonate-based IL, (3) HCOOCH3 formation by esterification of the formate-based IL (Fig. 4). In this case, the IL acted not only as the product of the reaction with CO2 and other alcohols but also as the intermediate to synthesize the final product. The above two roles of ILs resulted in an easy regeneration of both the IL and the catalyst. Han's group used urea and CO2 to synthesize methyl formate via the diol-based ILs at 150 °C and a CO2 flow rate of 5 mL min−1 in a two-step reaction (Fig. 5).73 The essence of Han's work was to circumvent the thermodynamic limitation and turn it into the thermodynamically favorable reaction using task-specific ILs.73

2.2. C–O bond
Typical construction of a C–O bond requires a highly-reactive reagent, such as an organolithium reagent or Grignard reagent. The substrates for the C–O bond construction include alkenes, dienes, alkynes, halogenated aromatic compounds, epoxides and C–H containing aromatic compounds. The conditions of the usage of organolithium and Grignard reagents are strict, restraining their applications. ILs provide an opportunity for the construction of the C–O bonds from CO2 and other substances in a green and sustainable way. However, up to now, the products of the C–O bond formation mediated by ILs were mainly limited to carbonates, including cyclic and linear carbonates.

2.2.1. Cyclic carbonates. 
The cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide, mediated by ILs, has been reported frequently and deemed as the model reaction for the CO2 conversion. Deng's group used ILs to catalyze the CO2 cycloaddition with epoxide to yield cyclic carbonates without any additional organic solvents at 2 MPa CO2 and 110 °C.75 He's group and Ikushima's group improved the yield and the conversion rate by using supercritical CO2 at 100–160 °C and 8–14 MPa.76,77 The merits of supercritical CO2 included attaining rapid equilibrium and elimination of organic solvents both for conducting the reaction and product separation.76,77 In addition to the change of CO2 source to improve efficiency, many efforts were paid on the design of new ILs (e.g., functionalized78 or polymerized79) or used in a supported method (e.g., silica-supported,80 polymer-supported,81 and MOF-immobilized).82 Introduction of metals to the ILs either by using metal-containing ILs or doping metal into the polymers immobilized by ILs could also improve the selectivity and the efficiency of the CO2 cycloaddition. However, a reaction containing pure ILs acting as both the catalyst and the solvent in CO2 cycloaddition in the absence of the supercritical state, metals and complicated immobilization processes is the ultimate and green system. Han et al. achieved both high selectively and efficiency by using a task-specific IL as the catalyst and the solvent at 1 bar and 30–60 °C (Fig. 6).83 Further efforts were exerted to lower the price and viscosity of ILs and the reaction time. Wang's group substituted epoxide for propargylic alcohol for the CO2 cycloaddition to synthesize α-alkylidene cyclic carbonate with the high yield of 89% using 200 mol% of the IL at 1 bar CO2 and 60 °C without other solvents.84 Still, in some systems, ILs did not act as the catalysts but as the solvents, the reactants85 or the templates.78 The eutectic solvents deemed analogous to ILs, also showed excellent selectivity and efficiency during the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide under mild conditions.86,87
 Fig. 6  Illustration of CO2 cycloaddition with high selectivity and yield at 30–60 °C and atmospheric CO2 pressure using a task-specific IL as both the catalyst and the solvent in the absence of any other solvents or additives.83 


2.2.2. Linear carbonates. 
Dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate are two typical linear carbonates synthesized from CO2. Traditional route to synthesize dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate usually utilized poisonous substances. The synthesis of linear carbonates directly from CO2 and CH3OH using ILs as the catalysts was found to be effective. Taking advantage of the high polarity, high solubility and facile activation of CO2, and high tunability of ILs, Zhao et al. designed a hydrogen carbonate-based IL as a recyclable catalyst and a dehydrant for the highly efficient synthesis of linear dimethyl carbonate from 1 MPa CO2 and methanol at near room temperature.88 Han's group improved the efficiency of the dimethyl carbonate synthesis using ILs by overcoming the thermodynamic limitations.73 They obtained the asymmetric organic carbonates from 1 bar CO2 and propargylic/primary alcohols at 30 °C via a reaction mediated by ILs.89 The catalytic activity remained almost unchanged after at least five regeneration times.89

2.3. C–N bond
The formation of the C–N bond is an important and novel route for the synthesis of organic substances and intermediates. In recent years, the construction of the C–N bond from CO2 using ILs became a promising route. ILs can act as CO2 absorbents, CO2 activators, reaction catalysts, solvents for the substrates, and product separators. Moreover, the high tunability, high stability and low volatility render ILs recyclable solvents and catalysts, favoring the concept of green chemistry and sustainable development.

2.3.1. Oxazolidinone. 
The pioneering study of using ILs to catalyze the reaction of CO2 with aziridine to produce oxazolidinone was reported in 2005. However, the conditions for the conversion of CO2 were very stringent, such as the requirement for supercritical CO2 and the presence of iodine.90 Following works sought the route to use only ILs without co-solvent, co-catalysts and at near room temperature and atmospheric pressure. He's group designed a series of Lewis-base91 and protic onium92 ILs to catalyze the synthesis of chemo- and regio-selective 5-aryl-2-oxazolidinones from aziridines and CO2 without any organic solvents or additives. Unfortunately, the conditions were also relatively strict, e.g., 3–9 MPa CO2 was required. They improved the carboxylative cyclization of various propargylic amines at 1 bar CO2 and 25 °C to synthesize 2-oxazolidinones via dual activation of both propargylic amine and CO2 using copper-substituted polyoxometalate-based ILs.93 Still, the disadvantage of using a metal (e.g., copper) provides additional space for improvement of the oxazolidinone synthesis. Han et al. produced 3,4,5-trisubstituted oxazolones from propargylic amines and CO2 at 100 °C and 1 bar CO2.94 Afterwards, they improved the conditions by using protic ILs to catalyze the reaction of propargylic amines to form 2-oxazolidinones at 1 bar CO2 and 60 °C.95 However, the above studies did not reveal clearly the corresponding mechanism. Gao and Xia used the DFT calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism of the IL-mediated synthesis of oxazolidinone and revealed that electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions of ILs played a crucial role.96


2.3.2. Quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione. 
Han et al. carried out a pioneering study by using the metal-free IL [BMIM][Ac], acting as both the solvent and the catalyst, to efficiently produce quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-diones from CO2 and 2-aminobenzonitrile at 1 bar CO2 and 90 °C.97 Moreover, this study displayed a new strategy of easy separation of products from reactants, and IL could be reused at least five times while retaining favorable catalytic activity.97 A big step was made by Liu et al. to improve the condition to be 1 bar CO2 and 30 °C by using a protic IL [DBU][TFE] as the catalyst.98 Both the cations and the anions of the IL could form hydrogen bonds with the substrate and weaken the N–H bonds, enabling the ILs to activate both CO2 and the substrate.98 Wang et al. found that the basicity of cation severely influenced the efficiency of CO2 conversion to quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-diones. Also, they found that the hydrogen bond from the cation of ILs could improve the efficiency.99 The CO2 absorption by the IL occurred prior to the CO2 activation process, as demonstrated by theoretical calculations (Fig. 7). However, the role of cations and anions in catalyzing the reaction was not very clear based on the above reports and was delineated by Dyson recently. Dyson pointed out that the cations of ILs played a secondary (rather than primary) role in activating the substrate and controlling the physical properties of the IL. Moreover, Dyson found that pKa of the IL anion was linearly related to the reaction rate and the anions of ILs governed the catalytic activity.100
 Fig. 7  Energy requirement for CO2 capture by IL (1) and CO2 activation by IL (2).99 


2.3.3. Carbamate. 
Choi’ et al. found that the superbase-derived protic IL [DBU][Ac] can catalyze the formation of carbamate from an amine, CO2, and a silicate ester at 5 MPa CO2 and 150 °C in acetonitrile.101 Aromatic amines showed a lower activity than aliphatic amines due to lower pKa values of aromatic amines.101 A hydrogen-bonding interaction occurred between aniline and the basic acetate anions of ILs. Protonated cations and the basic anions of the ILs were needed for the efficient synthesis of carbamate. The drawbacks of this report were the usage of co-solvent (i.e., acetonitrile) and the stringent conditions (i.e., 5 MPa and 150 °C). We believe that the synthesis of carbamate from CO2 catalyzed by ILs could be improved at an even milder temperature and a lower CO2 pressure by designing new types of metal-free ILs.


2.3.4. Formylation. 
Gao's group immobilized [TEA][Br] on the channel walls of the covalent organic frameworks, which showed both a high CO2 absorption capacity and a high efficiency of amine formylation with CO2 and PhSiH3 at 1 bar CO2 and 30 °C.102 One drawback was the usage of other substances as solvents (i.e., DMF) in spite of the mild conditions of 1 bar CO2 and 30 °C.102 Liu et al. refrained from using other organic solvents and used pure ILs as both the catalyst and the solvent for the formylation of amines using CO2 and phenylsilane at 30 °C.103 However, the pressure (1 MPa CO2) of the amine formylation could be further improved by tuning the chemical structure of the IL.103


2.3.5. Urea. 
Deng et al. showed an interesting combination of reaction and separation for the carbonylation of both aliphatic and aromatic amines with CO2 (6 MPa and 170 °C) to synthesize urea derivatives.104 The products could be easily recovered by filtration and dried by adding water into the reaction mixture.104 Nonetheless, CsOH is still expensive and the high pressure/temperature would cost more energy. Han's group used basic [BMIM][OH] which integrated the merits of ILs and the basicity of CsOH to avoid using the dangerous and relatively expensive CsOH.105 They expanded the range of amines to include aliphatic amines, cyclohexylamine and benzylamine, although the conditions of the CO2 conversion were still very stringent (170 °C and 5.5 MPa).

2.4. C–S bond

2.4.1. Benzothiazole. 
Liu et al. reported the first C–S bond construction from CO2, 2-aminothiophenol and hydrosilane to afford benzothiazole at 40 °C and 5 MPa CO2 in high yields, catalyzed by metal-free ILs.106 [BMIM][Ac] showed the best activity and acted as a multifunctional catalyst, activating CO2, hydrosilane, and 2-aminothiophenols via hydrogen bonding.106 The mechanism involved the formation of the intermediate A and the hydrosilane/A complex B first. Then, formoxysilane C attacked 2-aminothiophenol to form the intermediate D. The final product G was obtained after the release of hydrosilane and water via other intermediates, E and F (Fig. 8).106 One of the big contributions of this study was the generalization of the mechanism for both the C–N bond and the C–S bond construction from CO2 in the ILs media. Up to now, this was the only reported study regarding the C–S bond construction from CO2 using the IL as the catalyst. Low pressure of CO2 and the absence of hydrosilane while retaining high selectivity and efficiency with the usage of ILs as the catalysts and solvents might be the reaction conditions considered for future studies.

3. Electrochemical conversion of CO2 mediated by ILs
3.1. C1 products
C1 products (e.g., CO, HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4) are basic products and nearly cannot be avoided in the ILs mediated CO2 electro-reduction process. The valence of the carbon atom in CO2 is the highest (i.e., +4), while in the C1 products, the valence can be ordered as: CO, HOOH > HCHO > CH3OH > CH4. The production of C1 does not linearly correlate to the valence of the carbon atom, and it is influenced by many factors, such as the nature of electro-catalyst, electrolyte, extent of CO2 activation, potential, and the temperature/pressure of the system. In most cases, only C1 products are obtained and C2 products can not be detected due to the fact that C2 products consume more energy in the C–C formation process.
Although usage of cheap and efficient metal-free electro-catalysts is desirable, the cost-saving strategies related to metal such as nanotechnology, surface decoration, hybrid, metal-doping and facet construction are still anticipated. It is better to avoid the usage of the noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au) as electro-catalysts for the CO2 reduction because they are expensive. However, these noble metals are still used as electro-catalysts to produce long-chain carbonaceous products via CO2 reduction. Meanwhile, almost all the products obtained using noble metal catalysts could be synthesized employing cheap and stable metal-free materials.

3.1.1. CO. 
Noble metal-containing electro-catalysts in ILs media. 
Cuesta et al. monitored the process of CO2 reduction to CO on Au using in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy employing the attenuated total reflection mode technique in an IL/H2O mixture.107 Luo et al. successfully synthesized Ag2S nanowires for electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO in IL with ∼14-fold higher partial current density than that in KHCO3. They attributed the favorable performance to the formation of the [EMIM-CO2]+ complexes and the specific facet.108 Rudnev's group found that Au(110) showed the highest CO2 electro-reduction activity (in the order of Au(111) < Au(100) < Au(110)) in all the ILs investigated.109 Shi et al. found that the generated CO2˙− radical reacted with the [BMIM]+ film absorbed by the Au electrode, leading to the formation of [BMIMCO2](ad). Thus, CO2 reduction could be processed to produce CO with a low activation energy and overpotential.110 Grills used the homogenous ReCl(bpy)(CO)3 as the electro-catalyst for the CO2 reduction to produce CO and proposed the following mechanism. First, the imidazolium cation interacted with the reduced catalyst [Re(bpy)(CO)3]−. Then, CO2 reacted with a proton on the reduced metal center to form metallocarboxylic acid. Finally, the imidazolium cation interacted with carboxylic acid, producing a more positive reduction potential (Fig. 9).111 Shi’ group developed a novel electrolysis cell in the ILs/organic solvent media for CO2 reduction to CO catalyzed by Ag foil.112 Dlott used broad-band multiplex vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy to investigate the mechanism of CO2 reduction and found that the produced CO interacted weakly with Ag without poisoning the surface (Fig. 10).113
 Fig. 9  Proposed reaction scheme for CO2 electro-reduction using the IL as solvent and electrolyte.111 
 Fig. 10  Illustration of CO2 electro-reduction mechanism obtained by broad-band multiplex vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG).113 
Deng et al. found that the efficiency and the selectivity of CO2 reduction to CO was higher in [BMIM][Cl] with 20 wt% water when catalyzed by Ag (comparing to Pt, Au and Cu).114 Zhou et al. found that the IL inhibited the hydrogen evolution owing to the strong interactions between water and the anions and between water and the cations in aqueous [BMIM][Cl].114 Matsubara et al. reported that [EMIM][TCB] as both the solvent and electrolyte could decrease the onset potential and the overpotential for CO2 reduction to CO with fac-ReCl(bpy)(CO)3 (Fig. 11).115 Dlott concluded that the presence of water could dramatically increase the CO2 reduction efficiency, decrease the threshold potential, and move the potentials of the nonresonant sum-frequency generation spectroscopy minima.116 Zhang's group conducted the CO2 electro-reduction in distillable ILs catalyzed by 17 metal electrodes and found that most the of the metals (Al, Bi, Pb, Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt, Fe, Mo, Ti, and Zr) could not reduce CO2 and only produced hydrogen, while In, Sn, Zn, Ag and Au electrodes could reduce CO2 to primarily CO and a trace amount of HCOOH; the potential had only a slight effect on the distribution of products.117 They found that the non-noble metal In is the best electrode material for the CO2 reduction, even better than the other noble metals.117 Deng used Ag modified Cu electrode as the electro-catalyst in binary ILs, ([EMIM][BF4] + [BMIM][NO3]), with CoCl2 for CO2 reduction, and they found that the system showed excellent synergy for CO production with a stable area activity and a continuous production rate. In this system, binary ILs acted as both the solvent and co-catalyst.118 Masel's group developed IL/Ag system for the CO2 reduction to CO at overpotentials below 0.2 V; IL could decrease the energy of the CO2− intermediate and, hence, reduce the reaction barrier (Fig. 12).119

 Fig. 12  Illustration of the reaction process of CO2 electro-reduction to CO in water, acetonitrile or [EMIM][BF4].119 
Non-noble metal-containing electro-catalysts in ILs media. 
Fenter et al. proposed that the formation of the Bi⋯[BMIM]+ complex via partial cathodic corrosion of the Bi film could improve the catalytic activity of the CO2 reduction to CO.120 Bi electrodes underwent significant changes of bismuth oxide reduction to bismuth metal, roughness and near-surface viscosity in the presence of ILs.121 Isaacs used the mercury-free electrode with [Mn+(cyclam)Cln] (M = Co or Ni) as the catalyst for CO2 reduction in the ILs media and found that CO was the only product.122 Machado employed high pressured CO2 to enhance the CO2 solubility in ILs and produced a high pressured syngas directly from CO2 reduction with Zn–Cu as the electro-catalysts.123 Curtiss and Salehi-Khojin synthesized a transition metal dichalcogenide nanomaterial for the CO2 electro-reduction to CO in an IL.13 Officer et al. discovered that ILs promoted the formation of the Fe-porphyrin homogeneous catalyst, lowered overpotentials (670 mV), and increased kinetics of electron transfer.124 Isaacs et al. used Zn/Fe tetra-amino-phenyl porphyrins, modified as electrodes, and [BMIM][BF4] as the solvent and supporting electrolyte for the high efficiency CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CO.125 Salehi-Khojin et al. found that MoS2 accomplished a more efficient CO2 reduction (high current density and low overpotential) compared with the noble metals in [EMIM][BF4]. However, the Ag nanoparticles showed moderate electro-catalytic activity; undetectable products were obtained by using bulk Ag as the electro-catalyst under the same conditions.126 Terashima's group found that hydrogen evolution and CO selectivity could be tuned during the CO2 reduction by using a Cu-modified electrode in ILs.127 ILs could enhance the efficiency and the selectivity of CO2 reduction using the MoO2 electrode to obtain the reduction potential as low as 40 mV via several complicated steps (Fig. 13).128 Higher temperature and high potential increased the CO production and refrained from the HCOOH production by using ILs as both the electrolytes and the co-catalysts.128
 Fig. 13  Mechanism of CO2 electro-reduction by MoO2 in ILs.128 
Brennecke et al. found that [EMIM][Tf2N] switched from the CO2 reduction process to promoting CO production (Fig. 14b and c) rather than the oxalate anion generation (Fig. 14a) using the Pb electrode. As the concentration of [EMIM][Tf2N] increased, carboxylate species were formed along with CO.129 Han's group used supercritical CO2 as the carbon source and Cu as the cathode for CO2 reduction and found that CO2 could be primarily reduced to CO in the media of [BMIM][PF6]. Both the products and the IL could be recycled without cross-contamination.130 Rosenthal's group found that CO2 reduction to HCOO− or CO could be tuned by changing the ILs while keeping the same bismuth cathodes.131
 Fig. 14  Mechanism of CO2 electro-reduction without IL (a) and with IL (b) and (c) using Pb electrode in acetonitrile.129 
Metal-free electro-catalysts in ILs media. 
Han's group found that the metal-free catalysts (composites of graphene oxide/multi-walled carbon nanotubes) exhibited higher electroactivity than the Au and Ag electrodes for the CO2 reduction to CO in ILs/CH3CN media.132 Nakamura's group found that ILs [EMIM][BF4] first reacted with CO2 to form the [EMIM-COOH]− complex, and then CO was produced from this complex.133 Salehi-Khojin used metal-free N-doped carbon nanofibers for CO2 conversion to CO in [EMIM][BF4], exhibiting negligible overpotential and high current density. The high activity could be ascribed to the presence of the reduced carbons (rather than nitrogen atoms), the nanofibrillar structure, and close connection between the intermediates and the polymer surfaces (Fig. 15).12 Lei's group integrated the ILs (as the electro-catalysts) and the bioelectrochemical systems (as the electrical power inputs) for CO2 electro-reduction to CO, although both the reaction rate and selectivity needed to be improved.134
 Fig. 15  Mechanism of CO2 electro-reduction to CO in the IL media via the formation of IL-CO2 intermediate, its adsorption on reduced carbon atoms and CO production.12 


3.1.2. HCOOH. 
Noble metal-containing electro-catalysts in ILs media. 
Kim's group unveiled that the promotional effect of ILs was caused by the change of reaction microenvironment135 Masuda mainly obtained formate at −0.4 V (versus Ag/AgCl) and other products, such as methanol and CO, at −0.6–−0.8 V by using imidazole@IL/Au as the electrode.136 Sanchez-Sanchez's group observed the formation of the stable adduct [EMIMH-CO2] by using Pt(hkl) as the electrode, which limited the long-term use of ILs due to the degradation of ILs during the electrochemical CO2 reduction.137 Therefore, during the long-term industrial utilization of ILs, attention should be paid to their stability and the evaporation rate.138–142 The high hygroscopicity of ILs143–146 also influences the electrochemical selectivity and efficiency. The reuse of [C2mim+][NTf2] could be achieved by the addition of [H+][NTf2] with abundant protons. These protons hindered the reduction of [EMIM+] and favored the HCOOH production.137 Compton's group designed a novel pre-anodized Pt electro-catalyst for the synthesis of HCOOH via CO2 reduction at room temperature and 1 atm CO2 pressure.147 Hardacre's group found that chemisorbed CO2 by super-based ILs could be converted to formate on Ag electrodes with the overpotential of 0.17 V. However, CO2, physically-absorbed by [P66614][NTf2], was electroreduced only to CO at higher overpotentials. This report provides an energy-saving procedure for the CO2 electrochemical conversion (Fig. 16).148 Ramaprabhu's group found that Ag nanoparticles could be more finely dispersed on the poly-ILs functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes compared to the pure multiwalled carbon nanotubes, where the former showed a higher rate and a higher selectivity of CO2 reduction to HCOOH (Fig. 17).149

 Fig. 17  Mechanism of CO2 electro-reduction to produce HCOOH with enhanced efficiency, catalyzed by Ag nanoparticles and supported on poly-ILs functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube.149 
Non-noble metal-containing electro-catalysts in ILs. 
Han's group used commercial PbO2 as the electrode in the IL-containing media for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH and found that [BZMIM][BF4] was the best IL to enhance the current density and faradaic efficiency simultaneously via the formation of the complex [BZMIM-CO2]+, intermediate CO2˙− and subsequent HCOO˙ (Fig. 18).150 Also, they found that the activity of PbO2 for CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH was higher than that of TiO2, Bi2O3, ZnO, CuO and MoO3.150 Zhang et al. pointed out that in CO2 reduction by Pb electrode, the ionic microhabitat played a key role in improving the product selectivity and the reaction efficiency via enhancing the CO2 solubility and transferring activated CO2 to the cathode surface, which was deemed to be a great challenge for CO2 conversion.151 Ha et al. introduced [EMIM][DCA] into the aqueous solution and increased the efficiency of CO2 reduction to produce the formic acid on the Sn powder electrode; the underlying cause was the increased CO2 solubility and the suppressed hydrogen evolution by the IL.152 Fontecave's group found that the water/IL mixture increased CO2 solubility and activation, leading to higher current density and larger faradaic yield for CO2 electro-reduction to formic acid by using porous dendritic copper as the catalyst.11 Han et al. also conducted a study on CO2 reduction in ternary electrolytes (ILs/organic solvent/H2O) and found that a trace of H2O extremely improved the catalytic activity of CO2 conversion into HCOOH on a Pb or Sn electrode.153 The partial current density and faradaic efficiency of HCOOH formation were 37.6 mA cm−2 and 91.6%, respectively, much higher than the reported values of the homogeneous and noble-metal electro-catalysts.153 Bocarsly attributed a higher current density and lower potential for CO2 reduction at indium, tin, and lead electrodes to the higher extent of stabilizing intermediate and higher CO2 capture capacity by ILs.10
 Fig. 18  Mechanism of CO2 electro-reduction to HCOOH in the media of IL catalyzed by PbO2.150 


3.1.3. CH4. 
Han et al. combined an MOF cathode and a pure IL electrolyte for the CO2 reduction to CH4, which opened a new route to for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CH4 with high efficiency and selectivity via the CO2˙− and CO intermediates (Fig. 19).154 The Zn-MOF with a sheet-morphology exhibited a higher activity for the CO2 reduction than the Au/Ag/Pt/Fe/Zn/Cu-based MOF due to the largest electrochemical surface area. The fluorine-containing imidazolium-based ILs (e.g., [BMIM][PF6] > [BMIM][BF4] > [BMIM][TFO]) were more efficient than the non-fluorine-based ILs (e.g., [BMIM][ClO4]) because of the interaction between fluorine and CO2.154 Jovanovic's group obtained the parameters of the mathematical model for the CO2 reduction to CH4, CH3OH, H2, HCOOH and HCHO in the media of [BMIM][BF4] in a microscale-based electrochemical reactor. The developed model displayed the reactions for the reactants (CO2 and H2O) and the products (CH4, CH3OH, H2, HCOOH, and HCHO) during the CO2 electro-reduction process.155
 Fig. 19  Mechanism of CO2 electro-reduction to CH4 in the media of IL catalyzed by Zn-MOF.154 


3.1.4. CH3OH. 
Carlesi's group found that the amine-functionalized ILs showed a high CO2 absorption capacity, high ionic conductivity, high stability and a high stabilization of the charged intermediate (CO2˙−), resulting in favorable efficiency and selectivity of electro-reduction of the absorbed CO2 to CH3OH.156

3.2. C2 and higher-carbon-chain products
The C2 products are always accompanied by the C1 products; however, synthesis of C1 products does not necessary lead to a high yield of C2 products. Cn (n > 1) products of the CO2 electro-reduction have been reported in many papers. Unfortunately, the IL-mediated CO2 electro-reduction to higher-carbon-chain products as the major products has not been reported. Significant attention should be paid to this field because multi-chain carbonaceous products are very important.
3.3. Electrosynthesis

3.3.1. C–C bond. 
Thermo-construction of a C–C bond from CO2 in ILs has never been reported to the best of our knowledge; however, the C–C bond from CO2 could be easily obtained using the electrochemical power with the assistance of ILs. Atobe's group found that the CO2 solubility in [DEME][TFSI] was enhanced in supercritical CO2. The IL/supercritical CO2 systems contributed to favorable carboxylation of various organohalides on the electrodes of Pt, Cu, GC, and Ag. Moreover, the increase of CO2 pressure and the usage of the noble-metal Pt increases the efficiency of carboxylation.157 Dai et al. designed a novel, direct and efficient route for the reaction of CO2 (atm pressure) with benzyl bromide to yield ethyl phenylacetate (major product) in [BMIM][BF4] by using Cu–Ni as the working electrode. The high efficiency could be attributed to high porosity of the Cu–Ni electrode and the favorable adsorption energy for CO2 and the substrate by the Cu–Ni electrode.158 Huang et al. constructed the C–C bond from CO2 and an aromatic ketone to synthesize α-hydroxy-carboxylic acid methylester using the [BMIM][BF4] electrolyte. Moreover, it was also found that many factors could influence the yield of α-hydroxy-carboxylic acid methylester, such as temperature, current density, total charge, electrode and reactant concentration.159 Hiejima's group found that the efficiency of electrochemical carboxylation of α-chloroethylbenzene remarkably increased with temperature and pressure of compressed CO2 in ILs on Pt electrode with both the construction of C–C bond.160 Huang's group avoided the usage of volatile/toxic solvents and catalysts or any other additional supporting electrolytes but only used ILs as the media for the electrochemical carboxylation of 2-amino-5-bromopyridine with CO2. The product 6-aminonicotinic acid could be achieved in 75% yield and 100% selectivity.161 Chu's group synthesized low-density polyethylene from CO2 on a nanostructured TiO2 film electrode at −1.5 V (vs. SCE) in H2O/[EMIM][BF4] at room temperature under ambient pressure.162

Cyclic carbonate. 
Unexpectedly, the cyclic carbonate synthesis from CO2 and epoxides is seldom reported in the form of electrosynthesis in the IL media. Deng's group found that the electrocatalytic cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides to form cyclic carbonates could be conducted in ILs media with high efficiency and selectivity at mild conditions (1 atm CO2 and room temperature). This is the first report describing the use of pure IL as the electrolyte for the electrosynthesis of carbonate from CO2 without an additional supporting electrolyte or catalyst under mild conditions.163
Linear carbonate. 
Dimethyl carbonate potentially can be used as a gasoline additive. However, the traditional route to synthesize dimethyl carbonate requires hazardous phosgene and CO. The Garcia-Herrero's group used CO2 and methanol for the electrosynthesis of dimethyl carbonate in [BMIM][Br]/CH3OK on the Pt/Nb electrode in the absence of hazardous carcinogens in a filter-press electrochemical cell.164 [EMIM][EtSO4] displayed a higher CO2 absorption capacity than methanol. However, the yield of dimethyl carbonate in 40% [EMIM][EtSO4] + 40% methanol was lower than the yield in just 80% methanol on the Pt/Nb electrode.165 Cai et al. used metal-free graphite as the electrode for the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from methanol and CO2 in the ILs media without other additives. Cai et al. also found that graphite was the best electrode (compared to Pt, GC and Cu), and the amino-functionalized IL was the best IL for the electrochemical synthesis of dimethyl carbonate owing to its high CO2 solubility (compared to that of carboxylic and butyl-based ILs).166 Increasing the temperature decreased the selectivity of dimethyl carbonate (Fig. 20a); however, higher temperature led to a higher initial and a lower subsequent conversion rate (Fig. 20b).166 Increasing the reaction time had the same effect.166 Liu's group obtained dimethyl carbonate in a good yield (81%) in [BMIM][BF4]. The reaction was catalyzed by the Cu@Pt composites without any other catalysts and supporting electrolytes; the catalytic efficiency of Cu@Pt was higher than that in pure Pt.167 One pot synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from CO2, methanol, and epoxide was also achieved, which was more efficient than the previously-reported two-steps procedures in spite of a relative low yield of ca. 70%.168 CO2− (produced in Step 1) to interact with PO− (produced in Step 2) to produce propylene carbonate anion (Step 3 and 4), followed by the obtainment of dimethyl carbonate from Step 5.168 Liu et al. applied the Ag@Cu electrode for the electrosynthesis of dimethyl carbonate with high efficiency and selectivity in ILs due to the high surface area and open porosity of the electro-catalyst.169 Cai's group developed the system of [BMIM][Br]–CH3OK–methanol for a highly efficient electrosynthesis of dimethyl carbonate without CH3I and/or any other organic additives, in which Pt was the electro-catalyst, CH3OK was the co-catalyst and [BMIM][Br] acted as the electrolyte.170 Lu et al. found that the electrosynthesis of carbonates from CO2 and alcohols in [BMIM][BF4] could be processed under very mild conditions (55 °C and 1 atm CO2). A much higher yield could be obtained with primary and secondary alcohols than with tertiary alcohols and phenol. The efficiency was higher when the reaction was catalyzed by a cheap Cu electrode than by an expensive Ag electrode or Ti electro-catalyst.171

3.3.3. C–N bond. 
Inesi's group first obtained the electrogenerated O2˙− species from the electroactivation of O2/CO2 in ILs. Then, the electrogenerated O2˙− was used to construct the C–N bond (i.e., carbamates) from amines and CO2 with 2-imidazolone as the minor product. This process required a less negative potential than that of the direct CO2 electro-reduction and avoided other volatile and toxic organic solvents, supporting electrolytes and catalysts. They also found that the Ni cathode exhibited the best electrocatalytic activity among many types of electrode (e.g., C, Cu, Pt, Pb, and Cu).172 Furthermore, they synthesized organic carbamates from amines and CO2 in the [BMIM][BF4] solution (containing amines, CO2, and the alkylating agent EtI). The C–N bond formation was achieved at 1.0 atm CO2 and 55 °C without other solvents and catalysts. The Pt electrode was the most effective cathode among Ni, Cu and Pt.173

4. Photochemical conversion of CO2 mediated by ILs
Photochemical conversion of CO2 is favorite route for CO2 conversion due to the natural energy and high greenness from sunlight. Many reports have focused on the photochemical conversion of CO2. However, the IL-mediated conversion of CO2 under the irradiation of light has been seldom reported. ILs with high tunability and high CO2 solubility are promising media for the CO2 photochemical conversion, including under the irradiation of visible light.
4.1. Photochemical reduction
Chen et al. used the super-base ILs to capture CO2 from the air and found that ILs could absorb CO2 and water from the air simultaneously. Moreover, they found that the captured CO2 from the air by ILs could be converted to CO under visible-light irradiation with a metal-free conjugated polymer as a photo-catalyst (Fig. 21).174 CO could be generated at a production rate of 43.37 μmol g−1 selectivity as high as 98.3%. The high efficiency and selectivity could be ascribed to the high solubility and activation of CO2 by ILs. Compared to the metal-free photo-catalyst by the previous reports, conjugated polymer as photo-catalyst produced CO with a 15-fold rate.174 Wang's group found that ILs could promote the photo-conversion of CO2 to CO using [Ru(bpy)2]Cl2 as the photo-catalyst under mild conditions (1 atm CO2 and visible light). The reason for the high promotion of ILs was due to the task-specific property of ILs and the functional group on the IL cation.175
 Fig. 21  Mechanism of visible-light-driven CO2 photo-reduction to CO in IL media using metal-free conjugated polymer catalysts.174 
4.2. Photoelectrochemical reduction
Cronin's group carried out the photoelectrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO in a nonaqueous [EMIM][BF4]/CH3CN solution, obtaining the faradaic efficiency of 99% at the underpotential of +0.78 V. The photo-catalytic yield increased with the increase of the TiO2 layer. The presence of the catalytically active sites caused an increase in the electron–hole pair recombination rate. The complex between the [EMIM]+ ions of ILs and CO2 lowered the energy barrier of this reaction.176 Wang's group utilized the amine-functionalized ILs as both the absorbent and electrolyte for the efficient photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH at ambient temperature and pressure. In this system, ILs played a promotional role in the formation of HCOOH and the suppression of H2 production with a the faradaic efficiency of 94.1% and the electro-to-chemical efficiency of 86.2%.177
5. Conclusions and outlook
In summary, ILs could act as the CO2 absorbents, promoters of CO2 activation, electrolytes/solvents, catalysts, or co-catalysts. The type of ILs, catalyst, temperature, pressure, and other factors (e.g., solvent or co-catalyst) influence the efficiency and selectivity of the CO2 conversion. ILs have attracted much attention in the field of CO2 conversion. Tremendous accomplishments have been achieved recently. More attention should be paid to the following points.
(1) There are numerous reports related to the field of CO2 thermal/electrochemical-conversion promoted by ILs. ILs are also anticipated to be applied in the CO2 photo-reduction in the future. In our opinion, CO2 photo-catalysis to value-added products might be the most promising method for CO2 conversion mediated by ILs in spite of many obstacles to hinder the photo-conversion. The utilization of solar energy could provide the energy for the CO2 conversion while the other two methods (thermal and electrochemical conversion) consume a significant amount of energy inevitably.
(2) ILs could be designed with high conjugation to be used as photo-sensitizers, i.e., absorb visible light. In this case, ILs could play the role of visible-light photo-sensitizers, CO2 absorbents/activators and photo-reaction media, favoring the conversion of CO2 to chemicals and fuels under the visible light irradiation.
(3) Metal-free photo-catalysts integrated with task-specific ILs capturing CO2 from the air are a promising combination for simulating artificial photo-synthesis to produce value-added products.
(4) Most of the reported products for the thermal conversion of CO2 in ILs are compounds containing the C–O bond (mainly carbonates). New types of products and reactions, for example, the construction of the C–S, C–B, and C–P bonds, should be investigated.
(5) The desired thermal conversion of CO2 should be carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of CO2 using metal-free inexpensive catalysts.
(6) The products of the electrochemical and photochemical conversion of CO2 in the ILs media are mainly limited to the C1 type (e.g., CO, HCOOH, and CH4). There are almost no reports related to the conversion of CO2 by ILs to yield the C2 and Cn (n > 2) products (e.g., C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8). More attention should be paid to the generation of multiple carbon products of the electrochemical/photochemical reduction of CO2 in the ILs media.
(7) We might seek the help from electricity and light for reactions related to CO2 that could not be processed via thermal conversion. The activation of CO2 in the ILs media via (particularly) electricity and light could be more task-specific, selective and efficient.
(8) More attention should be paid to the one-pot production and separation of the value-added products of the CO2 conversion. Separation of products (especially multiple liquids or gases) in a real industrial setting is costly.
(9) Although the functionalization of ILs endows them with multiple functions in the conversion of CO2, these functionalized ILs are more expensive, less stable and more viscous. Due to the high designability of ILs, they can be modified to fulfill numerous demands for their ultimate industrial application, i.e., low cost, high stability, low viscosity, high efficiency, high selectivity and easier separation.
(10) New techniques should be used to monitor the in situ CO2 conversion process using ILs. The reported mechanism is mainly deduced by observing the static state in the beginning and in the end of the reaction. It would be helpful to clarify the CO2 conversion mechanism.
(11) The ILs should be stable during the usage of ILs via heat, electricity and light. Many ILs might decompose or react with other chemicals when exposed to the environment for a long time. Particularly, the stability of the task-specific ILs decreases after functionalization. The high hygroscopicity of ILs also influences the selectivity and the efficiency of the conversion.
(12) The development of a novel electrolysis cell or photolysis cell for the CO2 conversion is also important. The task-specific electrolysis cell or photolysis cell should also be paid more attention.
(13) In some cases, the CO2 concentration is very low (such as CO2 exiting from a flue), adding to the difficulty of CO2 utilization. Therefore, designing ILs with higher CO2 absorption capacity is the first goal. Moreover, the temperature of the flue gas is relatively high. Thus, full use should be made of the high temperature to catalyze the CO2 conversion while still maintaining the high CO2 absorption capacity by ILs and the high thermal stability of ILs.
