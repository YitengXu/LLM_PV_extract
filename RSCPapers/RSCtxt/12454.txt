1. Introduction
New synthetic materials with nanoscale dimensions and unique properties have been extensively explored in the last two decades for development of new solutions for energy production and storage.1,2 Among them, porous nanostructures with different morphologies made from materials including carbon, silicon, inorganic oxides and polymers were increasingly explored, providing some unique properties such as high available surface area and structural architecture for ion transport, and favourable mechanical, electrical, electrochemical, magnetic and optical properties or their combination required for energy conversion or storage processes.2–6 The main disadvantages of these synthetically produced materials are their high production cost, long production time using batch processes, lack of scalability, the use of toxic chemicals and production of hazardous waste with significant environmental footprint, which are not acceptable for sustainable production and established climate protection standards.7,8 Not only are environmental issues critical for their production, but also their use is concerning; for instance, superfine transition metal particles (e.g. Fe and vanadium) coated with redox-cycling organic chemicals (e.g. quinones) or carbon nanotubes with metal impurities could cause a negative health impact.9 To address these problems, there is strong attention to replace these hazardous materials using natural or biomaterials, providing low processing cost and minor impact on the environment and health as an alternative solution for energy conversion and storage.
Nature developed a unique biomolecular machinery and bio assembly process able to generate many biomaterials with unprecedented complexity and multiple functionalities and properties that outperform man-made manufacturing technologies.10,11 This natural molecular self-assembly process developed from millions of years of evolution is able to create these unique biological structures with high precision and reproducibility under mild environmental conditions and lower energy consumption. These biological materials attracted enormous interests for not only the biomimetic engineering of new nanostructured materials with complex architecture and unique properties, but also as a source of low cost natural materials ready to be used with minimal processing. Most living organisms, such as bacteria, algae, fish, insects, plants, animals and humans (bone), are able to synthesize these types of inorganic structures or their organic composites into intricate architectures with ordered micro-to-nanoscale features that cannot be replicated through existing engineering or chemical synthetic processes.11–13 Among them, the amorphous silica exoskeletons (frustules) of the single-celled algae, called diatoms, are one of the most spectacular examples of biologically derived nanostructured materials.14 Each of the estimated 100000 diatom species has a specific 3D silica shell called a frustule with a distinctive shape decorated with a unique pattern of nano-sized features such as pores, ridges, spikes and spines.14–17
Each frustule's structure has several hierarchical layers of porous membranes or structures differing in shapes, size and patterns. A remarkable diversity of diatom shapes, morphologies and pore architectures can be seen from Fig. 1, which presents several most common examples of diatom shapes. This variety of shapes and ordered porous structures irrefutably demonstrates precision and brilliance of natural design at the micro- and nanoscale, providing enormous opportunity to use this material for broad applications. A new term called diatom nanotechnology was recently created to describe a new emerging field for exploration of these outstanding materials and their applications across different disciplines including molecular biology, materials science, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and photonics.17 A number of potential applications for diatom silica including optics, photonics, catalysis, biosensors, drug delivery, microfluidics, molecular separation, filtration, adsorption, bioencapsulations and immunoisolations and template synthesis of nanomaterials have been proposed and explored.18–20 It is worth noting that diatom silica can be obtained by cultivation of diatoms in considerable quantities, but their enormous quantities from low cost fossilized diatoms, called diatomaceous earth, a white mineral powder composed of pure diatom frustules, are available in thousands of tonnes from the mining industry.

Therefore it is not surprising that these promising natural materials from diatoms based on their unique structures have been considered for energy conversion and storage. This review presents the recent progress on the applications of diatom-based nanostructures (native diatom, diatomite (diatom frustules), diatom replica, and their composites) in energy-related fields such as lithium ion battery materials, supercapacitors, solar cells, hydrogen storage properties and thermal energy storage properties. The field is still in the early stages, but it is progressing fast with a strong expectation to spur solid contributions of diatom nanotechnology to this field.
2. Diatom silica: structure, properties and their optimization
Diatom silica or the frustule structure composed of pure silica to protect cells is composed of two valves that are banded together by girdle bands, which wrap around and hold them together. The valve consists of piled hexagonal chambers divided by silica plates. The overall structure of a valve can be summarized as follows: lines of silica, called costae, diverge and occasionally branch from a nucleation site, the linear midrib in pennate diatoms or the circular mid ring in the centre.21–25 These complex hierarchical silica structures were developed and optimized by evolution to provide numerous functions including cell protection with strong mechanical structure and strength against predators, easy movement in water environment, optimised pore structures for molecular sieving for nutrient uptake, specific nano- to micro-scale pore patterns with optical and photonic properties for optimised light and energy harvesting and possible sensing and communications.17,25 Diatom silica walls (frustules) appear in various textures and shapes, which are mostly symmetrical. The micro-scale size of the diatom frustules and the nano-scale size of the pore structures are similar to the wavelengths of light that make them enhance the optical scattering properties and can be used as photoelectric devices.26–30 More importantly, photosynthetic receptors of diatoms are located in chloroplasts close to the silica wall; thus the light channelling and focusing properties of their silica structures can help the transmission and collection of more light into the photoreceptors, developing the silica frustules which help to increase the rate of photosynthesis.28,31–34
Although properties of diatom silica have several limitations such as high resistivity, which are not favourable for energy conversion and storage and other applications, considerable research is devoted to modify or convert silica into other materials, but with preserved diatom structure with micro- and nano-scale features. These modifications involve several materials including metals, semiconductors, carbon and polymers.17 Several approaches based on metal (Au, Ag, Pt) and nanoparticle coatings, using hydrothermal conversion, sol–gel chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition, have been presented to convert the silica surface into composite materials with new and more efficient optical, electrical and magnetic properties.17 Hydrothermal treatment in combination with thermal annealing were employed for conformal coating of diatoms by ZnFe2O4/SiO2. These coatings showed green photoluminescence resulting from the 4G–6S transition in Mn2+ ions.35–37 In addition, sol–gel surface-coating processes, combined with structure-directing agents, have afforded a conformal coating of diatoms by various oxides.37,38 Moreover, reducing the size of diatom-membrane pores while preserving the shape of the pores was exhibited to produce photocatalytically active diatom silica through atomic-layer deposition of titania.39 The hierarchically porous diatoms with transition metal oxide-modified structures are proposed to exhibit excellent specific capacitance and capacitance retention during cycling and commonly are with elaborately detailed and patterned nanoscale features.17,40–43
Another strategy is to completely convert diatom silica into another material such as non-natural metals (Au, Ag), polymers and Si without changing the bioassembled 3D morphologies.17 This strategy is called BaSIC (bioclastic and shape preserving inorganic conversion) and was pioneered by Snandhage and his team and includes gas/silica displacement reactions, conformal coatings, or a combination of those. Gas–silica displacement with an oxidation/reduction reaction, using elemental gas reactants or a metathesis reaction using halide–gas reactants, was used to convert silica-based frustules into MgO and TiO2 replicas, respectively.44–47 A combination of the displacement-reaction and solution-coating methods has been shown to generate a series of composite replicas with a variety of functional chemistries, including MgO/BaTiO3, MgO/BaTiO3 (Eu3+-doped), BaTiO3, and SrTiO3. Boron nitride was conformally coated on diatom frustules. Afterwards, the underlying frustules yielded free-standing boron nitride structures, which can hold promise for large-scale fabrication of nanostructured nonoxide ceramics for several applications including capacitors, piezoelectrics, thermistors, actuators, and sensors.
One of the most attractive diatom modification processes was achieved by magnesiothermic reduction using gaseous magnesium as a reducing agent, where the diatom silica was converted into diatom silicon with precise preservation of its 3D porous structure. In the first step, diatom silica is converted into a continuous nanocrystalline mixture of silicon and magnesia by thermal treatment at 650 °C, followed by selective magnesia dissolution, which yielded an interconnected network of silicon nanocrystals in the form of the initial diatom structure.48 This process is used for the fabrication of porous silicon and provides several advantages of low cost, shorter time, lower energy footprint, advanced properties and scalability compared with those of synthetic porous silicon prepared via an electrochemical process. Subsequently, combination of diatom silicon with carbon coating to gain better electrochemical performances attracted considerable attention to design new electrode materials for various energy applications, of which few are already demonstrated.49
From these presented approaches, we learned how many new materials and properties can be designed and fabricated from diatom silica materials. However, their limited number was explored for energy production and conversion applications. Table 1 summarizes currently developed concepts and the energy-related application of diatom biosilica structure-based devices. Considering the enormous potential and properties of these materials, we expect enormous progress on their applications including translation into real devices and energy production systems in the future.

3. Diatoms for lithium ion battery materials
The performance of low cost, high energy density and long lasting rechargeable lithium-ion batteries greatly depends on lithium storage materials. In the past, graphite has been considered as a potential candidate for anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its excellent cycling performance. However, the theoretical capacity of graphite is only 372 mA h g−1. It is crucial to develop electrode materials exhibiting higher power and energy densities. Silicon is one of the most attractive anode materials for lithium-ion batteries due to its high capacity of 4200 mA h g−1.50–54
In past years, various different forms of silicon were explored for Li battery applications including silicon films, nanoparticles, and electrochemically produced porous silicon.51,52 However, tons of optical fiber waste made from silica have been inevitably manufactured. A sustainable method is transforming wastes into Si@void@C yolk–shell structure to implement environmental friendliness.55 Among the types of silicon, a porous silicon with a unique hierarchical structure and high surface area was found to be a very attractive electrode material, having the ability to facilitate the fast transport of lithium ions due to its highly accessible surface area for liquid electrolytes, providing excellent rate properties and maintaining good electronic conductivity during charging/discharging cycles. To improve the performances of porous silicon electrodes, it is critically important to develop electrodes with new porous nano architectures able to greatly enhance performance by decreasing crystal strain and increasing the surface area available for ion transport. Through the lithium-ion insertion and extraction processes, silica as anode material is significantly hindered by severe volume expansion and fast capacity fading, leading to the pulverization of the electrode structure and the poor cycling performance.21
Thus, to enhance electrical conductivity, charge storage ability, electronic transport ability as well as suppress the particle pulverization, it is necessary to improve the performances of the silicon anode by including new nanoscale morphologies with increased surface and porosity such as nanowires, nanotubes,22 nanosheets and nanospheres.23 The following discharge capacity performances of prepared Li ion batteries were obtained using different silicon structures, such as 3D porous Si particles (around 2600 mA h g−1), Si nanotube arrays (about 1800 mA h g−1), and Si nanotubes (around 1000 mA h g−1).56 Another approach to improve performance of Si based anodes was to perform coating using Si-containing polymers18 such as silicohydrides.25 However, their reaction conditions are very laborious, time consuming and need complicated processing such as high pressure or temperature and expensive raw materials. Carbon coating was regarded as the most optimal solution because carbon-coated hierarchically porous silicon improved the cycling stability and improved electronic conductivity compared to the bare porous silicon, facilitating the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.20,57 The hierarchically porous Si/C composite was shown to exhibit the highest reversible capacity of about 1628 mA h g−1 at the first cycle with excellent capacity retention in the following cycles.58 One of the biggest limitations of silicon and porous silicon anodes for Li ion battery applications is the high production costs of these materials, which makes them less attractive for making batteries for the emerging electric car industry.
To overcome these problems of synthetically produced Si for Li ion batteries, diatom silica is recognised as a promising raw material for the fabrication of porous silicon anodes. Subsequently, combining silicon with carbon coating can alleviate the volume change of silicon and maintain the electrical contact between the porous Si particles.49 The porous silicon particles were obtained by a magnesiothermic process reducing commercial diatomite. With the void space between the silicon particles and the pores, each silicon particle is designed to supply sufficient room to accommodate the volume change of silicon in the charge and discharge processes, thus indicating much improved cycling stability. In their recent study, Campbell et al.59 first demonstrated carbon coated and converted diatom silicon as a high rate capable Li-ion battery anode. Diatom silicon was prepared by a reduction process from diatom silica using a magnesiothermic process, followed by carbonization with polyacrylic acid (PAA), which is summarized in Fig. 2. The resulting diatom-converted nanoSi exhibited a high BET specific surface area of 162.6 cm2 g−1, compared to a value of 7.3 cm2 g−1 for the original DE. DE contains SiO2 architectures that make ideal bio-derived templates for nanoscaled silicon. The DE-based nanoSi anodes exhibit good cyclability, with a specific discharge capacity of 1102.1 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a C-rate of C/5 (0.7 A g−1 Si) and high areal loading (2 mg cm−2) (Fig. 3). This study also demonstrates the first rate capability testing for a diatomite-based Si anode; C-rates of C/30-4C were tested. The anode maintained a specific capacity of 654.3 mA h g−1 – nearly 2× higher than graphite's theoretical value (372 mA h g−1).

In another study by Wang et al., the specific discharge and charge capacities were about 1700 mA h g−1 at the current density of 0.1 A g−1 and were demonstrated on porous Si/C composite anodes using Si converted diatoms. The anode also exhibits a much better cyclability than that of the bare porous silicon (205 mA h g−1). The result indicated that the restriction of the particle pulverization becomes the key to the improvement of the performances of the silicon-anode based lithium ion batteries.49,58,60–66 These examples indeed demonstrated that silicon converted diatoms are promising anode materials for lithium ion batteries, and we can expect more study to further advance these electrodes to improve capacity and cyclability.
4. Diatoms for energy storage: supercapacitors
Supercapacitors have become some of the most promising candidates for next-generation power devices owing to their high power density, fast charging/discharging rate, sustainable cycling life (millions of cycles), and excellent cycle stability. In particular, pseudocapacitors based on transition metal oxides exhibit specific capacitances much higher than those based on carbonaceous materials and conducting polymers as they can provide a variety of oxidation states for efficient redox charge transfer.67–76 In particular, pseudocapacitors based on transition metal oxides exhibit specific capacitances much higher than those based on carbonaceous materials and conducting polymers as they can provide a variety of oxidation states for efficient redox charge transfer. The transition metal oxides as electrode materials for supercapacitors including CuO,77 MnO2,78,79 NiO,80 Fe2O3,81 MoO3,82 V2O5,83 and Co3O4 (ref. 84) have been shown to enhance energy and power densities of supercapacitors. However, the majority of metal oxides also have a large portion of bulk and suffer from low electronic conductivity, low ionic diffusion constants and structural susceptibility, which limit their applications.85,86 It is crucial to maximize the utilization of the pseudocapacity of metal oxides, though providing reliable templates with high porosity becomes one of the essential criteria in designing high-performance electrodes for metal-oxide-based electrochemical supercapacitors.
Electrochemical supercapacitors based on manganese dioxides (MnO2) have attracted intensive interest due to their low fabrication cost, high specific capacitance (theoretical capacity is 1370 F g−1), abundant availability, environmental compatibility, as well as high cyclic stability in alkaline/neutral media.87,88 The manganese oxide supercapacitors with various structures and morphologies such as nanowires,89 nanosheets,90 nanotubes,91 nanoflowers,92 and hollow nanospheres93 have been fabricated via electrochemical and chemical routes, and their electrochemical properties have been investigated.94
The concept to use diatom 3D structure combined with manganese and Ni oxides and make composite electrodes for electrochemical capacitor applications was pioneered by Y. X. Zhang's team, indicating the valuable potential of these developments.95–99Fig. 4 shows the typical morphology of a MnO2-modified diatom structure used for making supercapacitor electrodes, showing the confirmed coating of the MnO2 layer, with nanofiber structures on the diatom silica structure preserving their pores and entire shapes.95

Purified diatoms exhibit a capacity of 8 F g−1, while the hierarchical and porous MnO2-modified diatoms obtained via a one-pot hydrothermal method show a higher power capacity of 202.6 F g−1. Because of the unique structure of the diatom surface, the MnO2-modified nanosheets are observed to grow vertically on the purified diatomite, increasing the specific surface area of the electrode, thus building hierarchical architecture. In addition, the MnO2 nanostructures after etching the diatomite have a higher power capacity (297.8 F g−1) and good cycle stability (95.92% retention after 5000 cycles). Subsequently, they presented that the Melosira-type MnO2 pattern exhibited a specific capacitance of 371.2 F g−1 at a scan rate of 0.5 A g−1 and good cycle stability 93.1% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at a scan rate of 5 A g−1 (Fig. 5).96 Based on the these results, the hierarchical and porous MnO2-modified diatomite composite is shown clearly to be a promising active material for low-cost, environmentally friendly, and electrochemically stable supercapacitors.

Furthermore, combining MnO2-modified diatoms with other materials showed that it is possible to improve the performance of supercapacitors. For instance, hollow diatom silica structures, TiO2 nanospheres and MnO2 mesoporous nanosheets were synthesized and explored for application in high-performance supercapacitors. The concept is presented in Fig. 6.97 The mixture demonstrated a high power capacitance of 425 F g−1 at a scan rate of 0.2 A g−1 and a long cyclic stability (94.1% retention after 2000 cycling). As the abundant interfaces and open-pore channels provided with TiO2 nanospheres and layers on diatom structures, the electronic transport of MnO2 nanosheets increased (Fig. 7). In addition, a unique combination of MnO2-nanostructures, grapheme oxide nanosheets (GO) and porous diatomaceous earth (DE) microparticles showed a larger specific capacitance of 152.5 F g−1 at 160 °C and a relatively better cycle stability (83.3% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at a scan rate of 2 A g−1).98 These studies indicated that unique diatom structure mixtures have great prospects to be an active material for supercapacitors, which are summarised in Table 2.

Nickel oxide (NiO) is well studied for supercapacitors because of its high specific capacitance, high chemical/thermal stability, ready availability, environmentally benign nature and lower cost.100,101 However, a large portion of bulk NiO suffers from a low ionic diffusion constant and structural susceptibility, which limits their applications.102,103 To improve the specific capacitance of supercapacitors with NiO nanowires, the hierarchically porous NiO moss-decorated diatomite was prepared. The high magnification images show that hundreds of large pores are regularly arrayed on one side of the frustules, and there are scarcely any discrete impurities in the pores. It was found that unique NiO-modified diatomite structures exhibit a specific capacitance of 218.7 F g−1 and an excellent cycling stability (90.61% retention after 1000 cycles).99 Based on these electrochemical results, it was concluded that hierarchical structure has an influence on electrolyte diffusion for improvement of electrochemical performances, making NiO-modified diatomite an attractive electrode for high-performance supercapacitors.
Previous studies using MnO2 and NiO modified diatoms for electrode applications indicate that controlling the morphology of these oxides on the diatom surface has a significant impact on the performance of the electrode. Results showed that metal oxides/hydroxides decorated on the diatom surface with precise control of morphology and component have a high power density, faster charging/discharging rate, sustainable cycling life, and excellent cycle stability. In principle, such unique nanostructures may solve the aggregation and volume expansion problem of electrode materials during long-term cycles, which is beneficial for the structural stability of the nanostructure.
Further improvement in development of diatom based supercapacitors was demonstrated by the Y. X. Zhang and D. Losic teams based on diatom silicon morphology made by the conversion of diatom silica into silicon using the magnesiothermic reduction, followed by growth of a MnO2 nanostructured layer using a hydrothermal process. The concept of fabrication of these new 3D Si-diatom@MnO2 electrodes for high performance supercapacitor applications is presented in Fig. 8.104
 Fig. 8  Schematic of the synthesis of Si-diatom@MnO2 material for supercapacitor applications.104 
Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets showed the best electrochemical performance, which delivered a high specific capacitance of 341.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, good rate capability (47.7% retention with current increases around 20 times) together with a steady cycle property (84.8% remained after 2000 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor based on the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets as the positive electrode and active graphene oxides (AGO) as the negative electrode delivered a maximum power density of 2.22 kW kg−1 and energy density of 23.2 W h kg−1. These outstanding electrochemical properties can be attributed to the good electrical conductivity of silicon diatom and its unique nanostructure, which enlarged the surface area and increased the active sites exposed in the electrolyte. Considering that silicon diatoms can be obtained from inexpensive and available natural resources using a scalable conversion process, these results suggest that Si-diatom@MnO2 electrodes showed great potential to be used as low-cost and high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors. The combination with other composites is expected to further improve these performances and possibly translate these electrodes into real practical applications.
5. Diatoms for solar cells
Solar cells are classified as silicon solar cells, dye-sensitized nanocrystal solar cells, plastic solar cells, organic solar cells and so on.105–111 Among them, the silicon solar cells with the unique tunable optical and electronic properties are the most dominant in the solar energy applications. Silicon semiconductors are not good conductors for electricity, leading to a large resistance and simultaneous mass loss. They are not employed in large scale due to high cost and immature technology. In 1991, Grätzel published a remarkable report that presented a novel type of solar cell known as a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and had a 7% efficiency based on nanocrystalline TiO2, subsequently improving the efficiency to 10%.112,113 Since then, DSSCs attracted considerable interest from researchers as they provided the possibility of enhancing solar energy conversion in reduced cost. Metal oxide materials like TiO2,110 ZnO,114 SnO2,115 and Nb2O5 (ref. 116) are applied in DSSCs. Among them, TiO2 is crucial due to its attractive optical, electrical and biological properties, which can yield optimal performance and be activated by UV light. However, the limitation of a thin film of TiO2 is that it lacks the high surface area that nanoparticles provide.39
The most synthetic processes for production of optical and electroactive materials involve complex and costly deposition systems or the use of chemically toxic materials. There is a strong demand to use and process environmentally more friendly materials such as biomaterials that are nontoxic, biodegradable and generate low waste and footprint. Furthermore, the hybrid functional nanostructured biomaterials have contributed to enhancing efficiency and reducing production cost.8,112,117 The specific surface area of diatoms can promote solar cell efficiency due to the large number of dye molecules adsorbed onto the nanostructured surfaces.41,118,119 Diatom has a refractive index of 1.43,120 whereas porous TiO2 thin films have refractive indexes ranging from 1.7 to 2.5,31 which gives TiO2-diatom layers high dielectric layer contrast and light scattering in the pore array. That is, TiO2-diatom compound DSSCs have improved the efficiency of the DSSC.121
Chandrasekaran et al.122 showed for the first time that the semiconducting and high surface area 3D silicon replicas prepared from diatom sustain photocurrents and enable solar energy conversion. They demonstrated that diatom frustules can be converted into nanostructured silicon semiconductors for solar energy conversion to power water electrolysis (Fig. 9). In addition, synthetic samples further improved the photocurrent density approximately to 14 μA cm−2via chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique of CdS. In conclusion, these low-cost, hierarchically-structured natural materials are promising in water splitting and hydrogen generation.

In another approach, Huang et al.121 prepared a TiO2-diatom paste mixture though spin coating and high-temperature sintering techniques and demonstrated that when the DSSCs were coated with three layers, one layer of diatom paste and two layers of TiO2 paste yielded an optimal power conversion efficiency of 5.26%. Results showed a 38% increase in the efficiency of DSSCs coated with three layers of TiO2 paste. Furthermore, in their study, high-speed centrifugal processing and sedimentation-rate separation techniques were successfully applied to obtain the diatom frustules. As a consequence, the results demonstrated that mixing diatom frustules with the TiO2 paste can enhance the light-trapping effect and optical scattering properties and increase the dye loading and surface area of working electrodes due to micro-scale size and nano-sized pore structures of the diatom (Fig. 10).

Park et al.123 found that adding low temperature TiO2-glass (LTG) can support Ti–O–Si binding and reduce surface charge recombination without appreciable changes to the crystalline structure of TiO2 in order to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs. However, adding more low temperature TiO2-glass may reduce the efficiency of DSSCs. Thus, the optimal addition of mixed glass powders is 2 wt% LTG and 3 wt% HTG with TiO2, displaying a power efficiency of 8.5%, which is significantly enhanced by 47% in comparison to that of DSSCs based exclusively on TiO2. Based on these results, the incorporation of high melting temperature glass powders on the surface of the photoelectrode was observed to enhance light scattering, which increased the light harvesting capability of the DSSC.
In previous studies, diatoms were not only applied in DSSCs, but also in other types of solar cells. Chen et al.124 presented the effects of a chlorophyll extract from diatom algae with better thermal stability as a spin-coating anti-reflection layer on surface textured silicon solar cells. They found that depositing a thin diatom extract layer can slightly reduce the reflection by up to 13% over spectral regions of 350–1100 nm. However, application of diatoms in solar cells is a promising due to their low cost, natural abundance and environmentally benign nature, but we still need to enhance the conversion efficiency of diatom solar cells.
6. Diatoms for hydrogen storage
Hydrogen energy has been proposed as an alternative fuel for the clean and highly efficient energy production. However, hydrogen storage is particularly challenging because it is difficult to establish a safe and efficient system at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Natural minerals as hydrogen storage materials such as metal–organic framework-5 (MOF-5) of composition Zn4O(BDC)3,125 microporous metal coordination materials (MMOMs), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT),126 silicate nanotubes, mesoporous crystalline silicon,127 and magnesium hydride (MgH2) have been extensively explored.128,129 The high dissociation temperature, slow hydriding–dehydriding kinetics and reactivity to oxidation limit the use some of these materials for hydrogen-related applications. Surprisingly, the high porosity with large surface area, small particle size, strong adsorbability and excellent thermal stability actuate diatomite a perfect candidate for hydrogen storage.130
Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising energy storage material due to its high storage capacity by weight (7.6 wt%), low weight and high volumetric density. The application of diatom material is reported using a procedure where MgH2 and diatomite were processed by ball milling and mixing.131 Both milling steps were performed under argon using a ball-to-powder (BPR) ratio of 10:1. Prior to milling with diatomite, pure MgH2 was pre-milled for 10 h and the mixture was prepared by additional 1 h of milling with 10 wt% of diatomite. Finally, the influence of porous diatomite structures on the desorption properties of MgH2 was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the fine porous microstructure of the composite played the foremost role. Therefore, diatomite is considered as an additive instead of a catalyst.
In another study, Jin et al.132 found that hydrogen adsorption capacity of pristine diatomite is 0.463 wt% at 2.63 MPa and 298 K, which is the highest of the known sorbents. The hydrogen adsorption capacity of acid-thermally activated diatomite could reach up to 0.833 wt% because of the appropriate pore properties obtained due to activation. Results confirmed an important finding that the hydrogen adsorption capacity strongly depends on the natural pore characteristics of diatomite. For further research, they created an effective metal-modified method that has been developed to disperse Pd and Pt nanoparticles on diatomite. By incorporation with 0.5 wt% of Pt and Pd, hydrogen adsorption capacities are enhanced to 0.696 wt% and 0.980 wt%, respectively.
Hence, diatomite mineral with large surface area, appropriate pore volume and small pore size is the promising physisorption-based material for hydrogen storage at room temperature. The influence on the hydrogen desorption characteristics under the diatomite-specific porous microstructure opens new ways to further improve the performance of these devices.
7. Diatoms for thermal energy storage
Thermal energy storage (TES) as an intermediate step to versatile, clean and efficient use of energy and has received increasing worldwide attention and research interest.133–136 Thus, in order to obtain a comfortable living environment, control of the indoor environment temperature change is needed using the air conditioning system, which also leads to a lot of energy consumption. Among various energy storage methods, thermal energy storage is recognized as an effective method. Because it can reduce the time differences between energy supply and demand in the future. There are three types of TES methods: sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, and reversible chemical reaction heat storage.137,138 Among the TES methods, latent heat energy storage realized using a phase change material (PCM) is the most effective technique due to its significant advantages of high energy storage density and narrow temperature variation during the thermal energy charge/discharge process.137–139 There are mainly two types of PCMs, inorganic PCMs and organic PCMs. The inorganic PCMs refer to inorganic salt hydrates based on the latent heat storage during dehydration and hydration, which have a high energy storage density and a high thermal conductivity.133,140 However, they also have several drawbacks that limit their application, such as the leakage problem of PCM during a solid–liquid change process.140,141 To overcome this problem, shape stabilization supports are introduced to fabricate form-stable composite PCM.142 Stabilization supports of PCM usually include microencapsulation containers, polymer microencapsulation shells, and porous materials,143 such as expanded graphite,141,144 fatty acid esters,145 paraffin bentonite,146 granular,147 perlite,148 gypsum,149 diatomite,150,151 vermiculite,152,153 attapulgite154 and clay minerals.155
Remarkably, porous materials can absorb or release water vapor when the relative humidity in the living environment changes. Therefore, the porous materials can regulate the relative humidity of the indoor environment, which makes people feel comfortable and reduces energy consumption.156 Considering this, porous diatom silica is recognized as a feasible candidate for an economical and light-weight material for incorporating PCM for thermal energy storage.157 Over the past two decades, the incorporation of PCMs with diatoms has been investigated as potential technology for minimizing energy consumption.158
In one pioneering study, Xu et al. reported a paraffin/diatomite composite phase change material featuring high tensile ductility and heat storage capacity, which was used as a fine aggregate in the production of novel thermal energy storage engineered cementitious composites. They also fabricated new paraffin/diatomite/multi-wall carbon nanotube composite PCM with a melting temperature of 27.12 °C and latent heat of 89.40 J g−1 (Table 3). Moreover, this composite PCM shows good chemical compatibility and thermal stability.160 Furthermore, Li et al. showed another phase change material composites of compounded diatomite with paraffin. Karaman et al.151 prepared a type of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/diatomite composite as a novel form-stable phase change material for thermal energy storage. The results showed that the melting temperature and latent heat of the composite PCM were 27.70 °C and 87.09 J g−1. The thermal conductivity of the compound material was improved by adding expanded graphite. Li et al.162 prepared several types of binary fatty acid/diatomite shape-stabilized phase change materials using the fusion adsorption method. The results indicated that the latent heat of capric–lauric acid/diatomite decreased to 57% of that of capric–lauric acid PCMs, and the phase-transition temperature rose slightly from 16.36 to 16.74 °C. In summary, modified diatomite composite phase change materials have the following remarkable features: large apparent specific heat for the phase-transition temperature region, suitable thermal conductivity, maintained shape-stabilization in the phase change process and no need for containers.

8. Conclusion and future perspective
From this review, it can be clearly seen that diatom based materials and their combination with other nanomaterials have attracted considerable research in recent years, showing their enormous potential for applications in the energy conversion and storage fields. This includes broad energy-related fields such as lithium ion battery materials, supercapacitors, solar cells, hydrogen storage properties and thermal energy storage. It took several million years to utilize diatoms in the synthesis of a unique biogenic 3D silica structure with multifunctional properties that scientists and engineers can use as a low cost biomaterial and transform in highly valuable materials for energy production and storage applications. Diatom nanotechnology, a new interdisciplinary area, has emerged over the past several years into a dynamic and productive research area with hundreds of studies to date, providing a strong research platform underpinning recent energy applications. As shown in this review, significant progress in understanding and tailoring diatoms' structural, mechanical, electrical, optical and photonic properties was obtained. This led to the fabrication and development of new devices for broad energy applications. Several typical examples of diatoms' enormous structural diversity with their organized 3D frustule architecture that can be modified and tailored with other materials to achieve new properties are presented in this review focused on energy applications. There are innumerable diatom species with unique frustule morphologies, and only a small fraction with functional diversity and surface chemistry has been explored for energy applications. We expect more research and development in this field in the near future that will include addressing some limitations of this material compared with existing and new synthetic materials. Diatom silica represents a cheap source of natural nanomaterial due to its easy availability in large quantities from fossilised diatomite mineral or from culturing using only light and minimal nutrients for growth. These low cost materials can be further transformed into highly efficient electrode materials using scalable processes that can be translated into industrial production. Finally, this review highlights recent progress showing how the outstanding of structural, physical, photonics, chemical and electrochemical properties of diatom silica can aid in using it as a promising new electrode material for lithium ion battery materials, supercapacitors, solar cells, hydrogen storage properties and thermal energy storage. Thus far we can conclude that the most promising energy application of diatoms is their conversion into low cost silicon that can be used for high performing silicon/carbon electrodes for Li ion batteries, asymmetric supercapacitors and solar cells. Even still, in this early stage, we can expect that this emerging field will rapidly progress and will be readily translated into practical applications in the following years.
