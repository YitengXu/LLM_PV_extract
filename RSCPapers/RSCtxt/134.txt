    , Accepted 25th August 2016First published on 25th August 2016AbstractA porous, cobalt vanadate (Co3V2O8) microsphere electrode with a cubic crystalline phase is synthesized using a novel one-pot synthesis with a metal–organic framework (MOF) based combustion strategy for use in high energy lithium ion batteries. The simple synthesis presented in this paper facilitates the evolution of a porous secondary microsphere morphology from primary aggregates of 20–50 nm particle sizes. This unique morphology appears to be derived from the Co-V–MOF intermediate network formed in situ during synthesis. The Co3V2O8 microsphere electrode displayed excellent cyclabilities at high current densities. In particular, a specific discharge capacity of 940 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g−1 and the highest known capacity of 650 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 5 A g−1 are sustained by the prepared microsphere electrode. The enhanced rate performance is mainly attributed to the unique morphology in addition to the nanoscale dimension of the electrode. Ex situ investigations confirmed that the high structural stability of the electrode facilitates minimum volume change during the electrochemical reaction under high discharge/charge rates. Furthermore, the present one-pot synthetic protocol appears to be promising for the production of phase pure, mixed metal oxide nanostructured electrodes for a wide range of applications including energy storage.
Introduction
Rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are generally a preferred option for use in the portable electronic market and in the future are expected to be used more in the electric vehicle industry. At present, LIB research is moving towards customization of already known materials to develop high energy/power density electrodes for immediate electric vehicle applications.1,2 In addition, efforts are ongoing to fully extend the technological expertise gained from LIB research and to identify alternative battery systems based on elements such as sodium.3 Nevertheless, to counter the over-dependency on carbonaceous electrodes with environmental issues and also to realize higher energy densities, the development of alternative anodes remains crucial for vehicular applications. In connection with this, transition metal oxides and, very recently, mixed metal oxides have been studied with growing interest as anodes for LIB applications because of their relatively high theoretical specific capacitance, low cost, high stability through a conversion reaction mechanism and synergetic effect from the variable oxidation states of the metal ions.4–7 Specifically, several reports have been published in the last five years on vanadium centered, non-stoichiometric mixed metal oxides with potential applications for batteries, photo-catalysis and hydrogen storage.8–14 Among them, cobalt vanadate (Co3V2O8; CVO) electrodes with a crystalline structure related to the Kagome' staircase geometry and an interesting magnetic behavior have demonstrated promising electrochemical properties for battery and supercapacitor applications.15–21 Despite its high potential as an acceptable anode for high energy lithium batteries, in general, the CVO material has been barely reported in the literature.22,23 For example, an ultrathin CVO nanosheet electrode synthesized via a hydrothermal method and post-calcination process delivered a specific capacity of 1114 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 1 A g−1 current density.22 An earlier report on a CVO electrode with a sponge network morphology obtained via a metal organic framework (MOF) intermediate displayed a stabilized capacity of 501 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 700 cycles.24 Very recently, interconnected hollow microspheres of CVO prepared using a simple hydrothermal route followed by air annealing exhibited excellent rate capability (320 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1), and good cycling stability (424 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 10 A g−1).25 Slightly better performances were obtained with mesoporous CVO nanoparticles (NPs) grown on reduced graphene which registered a capacity of 1050 mA h g−1 over 200 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1; however, the preparation method requires time and requires multiple heat treatments.26 Nevertheless, further enhancement in the rate performance is essential to suit the practical requirements of electric vehicle applications.
One of the strategies used to further improve the electrochemical reactivity with lithium and thus the anode performance is by morphological nanostructuring.27–29 Morphology tailoring, however, is hugely dependent on the type of synthesis used and therefore many preparation routes have been developed to obtain nanotubes,30 nanowires,31,32 nanorods,33 and various other customized electrode morphologies.34–37 However, in most cases, use of complex, tedious and time-consuming preparation routes remains essential to produce lithium battery anodes with favored morphologies and improved electrochemical properties.38–40 Also in certain cases, specialized equipment, such as thermal bombs, vapor deposition chambers, and so on, is necessary to synthesize such tailored morphologies. In addition, specific to the preparation of mixed metal oxides (including CVO) where the stoichiometric composition of transition metal elements is critical, one of the significant challenges is to design suitable synthetic strategies. To the extent of our knowledge, all the methods reported for CVO synthesis involve complex and time-consuming procedures/preparations. Nevertheless, the recent introduction of simple MOF-based synthetic strategies offers tremendous opportunities to develop nanostructured materials with unique morphologies. In fact, our recent report on a MOF-based solvothermal strategy to produce phase-pure CVO could be practically more effective/feasible provided the usage of thermal bombs can be avoided.24 Therefore, considering the fact that the MOF-based synthetic research is still in its progressive stages, the development of simplified and straightforward synthetic strategies to achieve electrode materials (especially non-stoichiometric mixed metal oxides) with unique morphologies for the promotion of enhanced electrochemical reactivity in LIB applications is worth pursuing.41–45
In the light of the previous discussion, in this paper, a new and very simple synthesis is reported, that is based on the combustion of a Co-V–MOF intermediate to obtain a porous microsphere type CVO electrode which is useful for high energy lithium battery applications. The advantage of this MOF-combustion (MOF-C) technique is that the material can be synthesized rapidly and directly within a short reaction time of just few minutes and avoids the need for any further post-heat treatments. This new technique, which has much similarity to that of microwave digestion, could provide opportunities for developing cost-effective and simple strategies for the direct production of nanostructured materials. The role of the dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvent used in this synthesis is not only to be part of the MOF formation, but also to act as a primary fuel to induce a flame that instantly provides ultrahigh thermal energy to its surroundings. Initially, part of the DMF is involved in the array-network formation with the metal precursors and the linker [benzene dicarboxylic acid (BDC) also known as terephthalic acid], while the remaining solvent facilitates fast combustion (exothermic) with the aid of the ignitor. The MOF network formed thermochemically decomposes (endothermic) at such high combustion temperatures, and subsequently undergoes nucleation under the oxygen atmosphere because of the consumption of the thermal energy released during the exothermic reaction. In fact, Kang et al. proposed a similar type of pyro-synthesis mechanism using polyol as a primary solvent for the synthesis of metal phosphate and oxide cathodes for rechargeable battery applications.46 The entire process occurs dynamically within a few minutes. The high energy generated and the short reaction time facilitates rapid nucleation of MOF and suppresses grain growth and as a result, highly crystalline ultrafine particles with unique morphologies are formed. It is worth noting that this synthetic protocol leads to the direct production of highly crystalline nanostructured materials that can be directly used as active electrode materials without any post-heat treatments.
This new preparative technique has the novelty of rapid, new and a one-step combustion of MOF which produces the desired metal oxides with a well known morphology. In addition, it has the advantage of having both the MOF and combustion techniques performed together which may satisfy the demands for in a advanced energy application in a more obvious way.
Experimental section
Synthesis of porous microspheres of Co3V2O8
In a typical procedure, 0.5 mmol of cobaltacetylactonate [Co(acac)2] and 0.33 mmol of vanadiumacetylactonate [VO(acac)2] were mixed with 0.8 mmol of BDC in 20 ml of DMF. After stirring for 20 min, 5 ml of thinner was added to the wine red, clear solution and stirred again for 10 min to make a homogeneous solution. The resultant solution was ignited with an external igniter while being simultaneously heated at 250–300 °C in an aluminum foil boat to obtain the corresponding metal oxide, Co3V2O8 (caution: take a minimum quantity of solution to avoid bumping occurring during synthesis). The as-prepared powder was used directly for further characterizations.
Structure and morphology characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction measurements (PXRD, CuKα radiation, with λ = 1.5406 Å), were carried out using a Shimadzu X-ray diffractometer. The surface morphology was determined using field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using the Hitachi S-4700 microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detection and the lattice fringes were analyzed using field emission-transmission electron microscopy using a Philips Tecnai F20 electron microscope at 200 kV (FE-TEM). The elemental oxidation states were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a Thermo VG MultiLab 2000 using AlKα as the X-ray source. The spectrometer was calibrated to the C 1s peak binding energy of 284.5 eV. The surface area and pore size distribution of the sample were determined based on the nitrogen (N2) adsorption and desorption isotherms obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 (Norcross, GA, USA) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller theory (BET).
Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical experiments were performed with 2032 coin type cells using Li foil as the counter electrode. The working electrode was prepared by mixing the active material, Super P carbon black as the conducting carbon, and polyacrylic acid binder in deionized water to form a slurry at a weight ratio of 70:15:15. The obtained mixture was then uniformly pasted on a pure copper-foil current collector and dried overnight under vacuum. The dried material was then pressed between stainless steel twin rollers at room temperature. The foil was then punched into circular discs, and the coin cells were assembled with lithium metal as the counter electrode and a membrane (Celgard 2400) together with a glass fiber as the separator. The electrolyte was 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1 by volume). Charge/discharge cycling was performed on a Nagano BTS2004H (Japan) battery test instrument at 0.01–3.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies of the electrode were performed using a Bio-Logic Science VSP 1075 at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
In the present study, the microsphere type CVO electrode was prepared using a Co-V–MOF intermediate using a combustion approach. The initial formation of the metals–linker network with solvents on the cavities/voids creates a spherical morphology. The morphology is normally governed by the way in which the linker coordinates with the metal ions in the presence of the solvent trapped in the cavities or voids within the network. It is highly possible that various types of linkers in the presence of different solvents could influence the network array and result in the formation of different crystal structures. Therefore, the targeted intermediate MOF, which can be represented by a general array of network formed with the linker and the solvent, may be governed by the following equation: 3Co(acac)2 + 2VO(acac)2 + xBDC + yDMF → (Co3V2(BDC)x·yDMF)n(1)
In fact, the determination of the exact coordination between the metal ions and linker and the position of solvent in the network remains complicated because of the lack of evidence from single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and simulation data. The framework analysis becomes further complicated, if more than one metal is involved. However, in order to arrive at an empirical estimation of the intermediate Co-V–MOF product, the synthesis of an approximate MOF with the specific stoichiometry corresponding to the single crystal structure was expected to be performed. The procedure adopted to prepare the MOF intermediate is as follows: appropriate precursors (with the exception of the thinner) corresponding to the targeted stoichiometry dissolved in a minimum quantity of DMF solvent on a hot plate were kept under observation for a few days to facilitate single crystal growth and this task still remains in progress at the moment. Meanwhile, the intermediate product (obtained when the reaction was stopped after the precipitate formation) thus formed was analyzed using PXRD and FE-SEM to identify the structural characteristics and the morphological origin, respectively. The major PXRD peaks at scanning angles (2θ) of 10.8° and 11.4°, shown in Fig. 1a, reveal that this pattern bears a resemblance to the standard XRD pattern of the Co–MOF-71 intermediate.47 Also, considering the chemical composition and chemistry, it was assumed that the Co-V–MOF was isostructural with the standard MOF-71. Therefore, the present Co-V–MOF intermediate was refined using the simulated MOF-71 (Co)48 pattern using X'Pert High Score software (Fig. S1; ESI†). The unit cell parameters for the refined Co-V–MOF intermediate were a = 8.02, b = 18.68 and c = 9.90. Interestingly, the Co position in the Co-V–MOF intermediate is located at the (4c) site of the unit cell whereas Co in the MOF-71 is located at the (4a) site (Fig. S1; ESI†). Subsequently, a random replacement of the Co ion by the vanadium ion leads to the resulting refined pattern that is isostructural with Co-V–MOF (Fig. S1 and S2; ESI†). However, single crystal studies of the present Co-V–MOF intermediate are required for the exact identification and understanding of its structure. For further confirmation, an intermediate product was obtained separately using the same precursors under solvothermal conditions at 180 °C for 12 h. The corresponding PXRD pattern bears a close resemblance (see Fig. S3; ESI†) to that in Fig. 1a and thereby confirms the formation of the MOF intermediate. However, a genuine pattern of the Co-V–MOF intermediate will be derived based on single crystal XRD and simulation data. However, the FE-SEM images of the Co-V–MOF intermediate (Fig. 1b and c) obtained by stopping the reaction after precipitate formation exhibit uniform microsphere particle morphology with diameters ranging from approximately 700 nm to 1 μm. The magnified image in Fig. 1c shows a large number of primary particles of sizes ranging between 20 and 50 nm agglomerated uniformly to form the microspheres and more importantly, the surface morphology does not appear to reveal any porous features.

Fig. 2a corresponds to the PXRD profile of the final product formed by the one-pot synthesis involving a MOF-based combustion technique in the presence of the ignitor. All of the diffraction lines in the pattern are indexed well to the characteristic lines of the cubic phase of Co3V2O8 (JCPDS no. 16-0675).20,23 The morphology investigations of the CVO powder obtained were carried out using electron microscopy techniques and the results are presented in Fig. 2b–d. As anticipated, the FE-SEM images reveal that the microsphere particle morphology of the final product clearly resembles that observed for the intermediate product; however, the difference is that the primary particles forming the secondary microspheres appear slightly bigger. More importantly, these primary particles have been connected to each other via inter-particle pores or voids, as is evident from Fig. 2b. The magnified image in Fig. 2b (inset) shows the topography where a small number of NPs were implanted on the sheets/flakes with distinguishable voids. The average sizes of the primary particles are observed to be in the range of 20–50 nm. The low magnification FE-TEM image in Fig. 2c confirms the presence of micrometer sized spherical particles with a large number of pores/voids. This secondary morphology consists of numerous primary nano-scale particles, as shown in the magnified image in the inset of Fig. 2c. The highly magnified image in Fig. 2d shows distinguishable lattice fringes of the sheets/flakes within which NPs are implanted. The measured inter-planar distance (d) of 0.251 nm agrees well with the (311) plane identified from the PXRD measurement and therefore confirms the cubic phase of Co3V2O8.22 A selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (from HR-TEM) in Fig. S4 (ESI†) confirms the planes of cubic Co3V2O8. Additional low magnification images revealing the unique morphology have been provided in the ESI (Fig. S5†). Therefore, these studies clearly confirm that the microsphere morphology of the present CVO electrode is mainly derived from the intermediate MOF network.

Based on the PXRD and electron microscopy results, Fig. 3a illustrates the possible formation of CVO microspheres: as discussed earlier, the initial homogenous solution containing the linker (BDC), creates a framework array with both metals to form the Co-V–MOF intermediate where the solvent is incorporated within the spatial voids in the MOF and thus a spherical particle morphology evolves. Then the solution is gradually precipitated at the evolved temperature of 250–300 °C. Meanwhile, the rapid ignition of the solvent by the thinner leads to the combustion of the solution and the resultant product decomposes at the evolved temperature. The rapid processes of MOF formation–combustion followed by the sudden decomposition of the MOF array and the formation of CVO occurs without affecting the overall spherical particle morphology. This process also facilitates the complete removal of the organic remnants and leads to the formation of CVO microspheres with numerous voids that constitute the pores. Although this rapid and versatile technique has several advantages including the consumption of lower solvent volume and shorter reaction time, this technique can introduce/enhance the carbon content either by doping or accumulating carbon on the particle surface. However, it is anticipated that the present CVO microsphere electrodes with porous features could aid in the improved electrochemical reactivity with lithium. The topochemical transformation from the intermediate Co-V–MOF product to the corresponding Co3V2O8 is illustrated in Fig. 3b. The octahedral units of CoO6 and VO6 in the Co-V–MOF intermediate share the alternate corners in the framework (linkers and solvents have been omitted for clarity). During the process of combustion, the octahedral CoO6 unit in the intermediate rotates along its own central axis (∼45°) accompanied by the migration of V ions to the tetrahedral site, thereby forming a stable ternary oxide of Co3V2O8.

In order to further understand the porous features of the CVO microspheres prepared, the surface adsorption studies were performed and the results revealed porous/macroporous characteristics with weak adsorption, as discerned from the type III isotherm (Fig. S6A; ESI†). The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm shows a distinct hysteresis loop in the range of ∼0.3–1.0P/P0 with a calculated surface area of ∼40 m2 g−1 from BET analysis. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore size distribution curve revealed a distribution of pores in the meso- and macro-range with a corresponding pore volume of 0.272 cm3 g−1 for this material (Fig. S6B; ESI†). This value reveals that CVO microspheres bear a larger number of small particles with partial heterogenic orientation and thus demonstrates that there is large phase segregation.
The surface electronic oxidation states and composition of porous Co3V2O8 microspheres were determined using XPS with AlKα as the X-ray source and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The C 1s profile in Fig. 4a shows four different distinct peaks after deconvolution at 282.9, 284.5, 286.5, and 288.4 eV which are because the carbon is related to different environments. The peak at 282.9 eV is from carbon substituting49 the oxygen in the Co3V2O8 lattice to become C–M–O, where M = Co or V. This carbon essentially originated from the MOF network because the process of sudden combustion causes a rearrangement in the matrix, and thus carbon is doped into the lattice. The other peaks are attributed to adventitious carbon on the surface of the material. The peak at 284.5 eV was because the graphitic-like carbon (C–C, from the MOF network) condensed on the surface and the remaining peaks at 286.5 and 288.5 eV, were because of the formation of the C–OH (and C–O–C) and CO (and COO) bonds of the carbonate-like species,50 respectively, originating from the oxidized carbon species present in the material. The oxygen profile also exhibits different environments of oxygen in the Co3V2O8 matrix (Fig. 4b). The deconvoluted peak positions at 528.8, 530.8, 532.1, and 533.2 eV can be interpreted as the M–O (lattice oxygen-unreconstructed),51 M–O (O2− lattice oxygen-reconstructed), CO (and COO, carbonate), and C–OH (and C–O–C, carbonate) species,52,53 respectively.

The Co 2p profile of the CVO microspheres shows two distinct peaks before deconvolution at 780.2 and 796.0 eV, because of the spin orbit coupling energy states of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, with a splitting energy of 15.8 eV. After deconvolution, as shown in Fig. 4c, two different oxidation states of Co evolve with shake-up satellite lines for each spin orbit state. In detail, the deconvoluted 2p3/2 peak shows a combination of +2 and +3 oxidation states54 at 780.0 and 782.8 eV, respectively, with the shake-up satellite peak at 786.3 eV. The observation of shake-up satellite peaks in this region (at 786.3 and 802.4 eV) provides evidence that Co is standing with the +2 oxidation state.55 It is worth mentioning that the shake-up satellite line at 786.3 eV suggests that the Co2+ ions are in an octahedral coordination. Although the Co 2p lines reveal the oxidation states of +2 and +3, the intensity of the former is predominant, as is evident in Fig. 4c. Similarly, the vanadium 2p lines in Co3V2O8 show the spin orbit coupling value of 7.2 eV between 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, corresponding to 517.1 and 524.3 eV, respectively. The resultant deconvolution (Fig. 4d) shows that V 2p encompassing the +4 and +5 oxidation states are revealed at 515.8 and 517.2 eV, respectively, where the lower and higher binding energy peak positions are assigned to the V4+ and V5+ species, respectively, on the particle surface.56 Therefore, the XPS profiles of both the elements confirm the quality of the prepared material and these values are well matched to those previously reported.23 The corresponding survey spectrum (Fig. S7: ESI†) shows the purity of this material.
The CV behavior of porous CVO microspheres over the voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V versus Li/Li+ for the first three cycles, shown in Fig. 5a, clearly depicts the oxidation and reduction status of electrodes at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. The CV profile clearly shows that the response of the first cycle (first scan) differed entirely from the remaining cycles (scans). The curves clearly show four reduction peaks at 1.39, 1.12, 0.68, and 0.12 V during the first cathodic scan of Li insertion, whereas the anodic scan depicts two distinct oxidation peaks at 1.32 and 2.2 V and these two peaks appear in all subsequent cycles without any shift in their positions. As anticipated, the cathodic peaks observed at 1.39 V and 0.68 V are attributed to the formation of CoO accompanied by the intermediate LixV2O5 and the conversion of CoO into metallic Co, respectively.23,57,58 However, the additional two peaks positioned between these two phases at 1.12 and 0.12 V might be increased because of the further insertion of Li ions into the intermediate LixV2O5 and the alloy formation of Li–Co, respectively.24 In contrast, from the second cathodic scan onwards, four reduction peaks are observed at 1.71, 1.36, 0.96, and 0.55 V, all of which are different from those observed in the first scan. The first lithiation peak at 1.71 V is because of the formation of LixV2O5, whereas the 1.36 V and 0.96 V peaks represent further insertion of Li ions into LixV2O5 and the 0.55 V peak increased by the conversion of cobalt(II) oxide (CoO) to metallic Co. The difference in the CV responses between the first and the remaining scans is most likely because of the irreversible destruction of the crystal structure and the related solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, as expected. The anodic peaks at 1.32 V and 2.2 V could be assigned to the delithiation from the LixV2O5 matrix and oxidation of metallic Co to CoO and further extraction of Li ions from the LixV2O5, respectively. These conclusions are drawn from earlier findings reported in the literature.22,23 For example, Yang et al.22 briefly explained the lithiation/delithiation processes in self-assembled multilayered nanosheets of Co3V2O8 using electron microscopy studies. They explained that, in the first cycle, Co3V2O8 is gradually destroyed, resulting in the emergence of CoO particles lying on the remaining disordered lithiated cobalt metal oxide (LixCo3V2O8) nanosheets. On further insertion of lithium ions, these CoO particles are reduced to metallic Co quantum dots that are anchored on to the remaining amorphous LixV2O5 matrixes.

The galvanostatic discharge and charge performance for the porous Co3V2O8 microsphere electrode was examined against Li ions at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0.005–2.5 V versus Li/Li+ and the resulting discharge and charge profiles for the 1st, 2nd, 50th, 100th, and 120th cycles are presented in Fig. 5b. In the initial stage of the first discharge curve, the potential is seen to rapidly drop to 0.92 V followed by a small plateau and then it again drops until 0.40 V. The curve then gradually lowers to a specific capacity corresponding to 1582 mA h g−1, whereas the following charge curve reaches the capacity of 933 mA h g−1 at the end of the first cycle. As anticipated, the large initial irreversible capacity is attributed to SEI layer formation. The measured specific discharge capacities for the 2nd, 50th, 100th, and 120th cycle are 956, 966, 1048, and 995 mA h g−1, respectively. The corresponding cyclability curves are shown in Fig. 5c. The cyclability performance at such a high current density indicates that, the initial capacity of 1582 mA h g−1 decreased to 835 mA h g−1 in the 8th cycle. On repeated cycling, the capacity gradually increased and attained the maximum value of 1022 mA h g−1 for the 65th cycle. After this cycle, a small drop in the capacity was observed, and thus at the end of 120th cycle, the value was sustained at 995 mA h g−1. The high capacities achieved support the excellent performance of this material by this simple preparative technique. For further estimation of their electrochemical behavior, the porous CVO microspheres underwent rate performance tests at various current densities and the results are presented in Fig. 5d. Prominent rate capability with average discharge capacities of 1189, 970, 926, 785, 532, and 280 mA h g−1 when the current densities are increased in the order of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 A g−1, respectively, were realized. By further altering the current density to 0.2 A g−1, the electrode retains an average capacity as high as 839 mA h g−1. The capacity drop, especially at high current densities, in rate capability measurement (by altering current rates), is observed because of concentration polarization of Li ions resulting from diffusion limitations.59
It is worth mentioning here that the performance of the CVO electrode was also investigated under prolonged cycling at two higher current densities of 1 A g−1 and 5 A g−1versus Li/Li+. The charge/discharge profile for 1 A g−1 exhibits an initial capacity of 1501 mA h g−1 and this value drops to 926 mA h g−1 at the 2nd cycle (Fig. 6a). The measured discharge capacities at the 50th, 80th, and 100th cycles were 850, 898, and 940 mA h g−1, respectively, revealing the sustainability of specific capacities by the porous CVO microsphere electrode at higher current densities. Notably, the specific discharge/charge profiles within the initial 400 cycles tested at a very high current density of 5 A g−1 followed by selected profiles of the consecutive 50 cycles, which were tested at a current density of 3 A g−1, are depicted in Fig. 6c. The discharge capacity at the end of the first cycle shows the value of 1348 mA h g−1; however, it exhibits 823 and 647 mA h g−1 at the end of the 2nd and 100th cycles, respectively. Interestingly, after 100 cycles, the capacity increases to 710 mA h g−1 in the 200th cycle. This could be because of the accumulation and re-utilization of more CoO increasingly formed from the lithiated intermediate product (LixV2O5). However, the specific capacity is almost sustained at around 650 mA h g−1 without any notable fading at the end of the 400th cycle and thus demonstrates the stability of the present CVO electrode prepared by the simple one-pot synthesis. In contrast, the capacity increased by altering the current density from 5 to 3 A g−1. A significantly high discharge capacity of 813 mA h g−1 was noted in the 401st cycle whereas a maximum capacity of 851 mA h g−1 was observed at the end of the 432nd cycle. At the end of the 450th cycle, a sustained value of 822 mA h g−1 was maintained and these results reveal the long cycle life stability of the present CVO electrode synthesized using the one-pot MOF-C technique.

Selected discharge/charge profiles within the 0–2.5 V potential window (a) at 1 A g−1 current density; (c) at 5 A g−1 for the initial 400 cycles followed by 3 A g−1. Their corresponding cyclability for (b) 100 cycles at 1 A g−1 and (d) 400 cycles at 5 A g−1 followed by 50 cycles at 3 A g−1. 
The corresponding cyclability patterns for the present CVO electrode at the current densities of 1 and 5 A g−1 (5 followed by 3 A g−1) are shown in Fig. 6b and d, respectively. The initial capacity of 1501 mA h g−1 drops to 926 mA h g−1 at the end of the 2nd cycle and, more significantly, this value was almost retained even after the 100th cycle [940 mA h g−1 with coulombic efficiency (CE) of ∼100%] and thereby strongly validates the stability of this electrode. As well as the cyclability performance under a current density of 5 A g−1 for the initial 400 cycles, the graph in Fig. 6d, demonstrates that the initial capacity gradually decreased from 1348 to 647 mA h g−1 at the end of the 100th cycle, however, the capacity steadily increased and reached a maximum value of 744 mA h g−1 at the end of the 237th cycle. Thereafter, a subtle change in the measured capacity value to 650 mA h g−1 with a CE close to ∼100% is observed at the end of the 400th cycle. On successive cycling at a lower current density of 3 A g−1, the discharge capacities increased with increasing cycle numbers to reach the maximum value of ∼850 mA h g−1 at the end of the 432nd cycle. Practically, the stabilized capacity of ∼820 mA h g−1 achieved in the 450th cycle reveals the long cycle stability of this electrode at very high current densities. Also, a significantly high performance was achieved at a very high current density of 5 A g−1 for prolonged cycling (∼400 cycles) and the fact that the present CVO electrode is able to recover a high discharge capacity of ∼820 mA h g−1 for 50 consecutive cycles demonstrates the remarkable material stability when two different high current density conditions are applied successively. In addition, the structural stability of the present porous CVO microsphere electrode was determined using SEM measurements (ex situ) on the electrode recovered after completing 100 cycles at 1 A g−1. The SEM image obtained (Fig. S8, ESI†) shows that the original microsphere shape is still retained even after prolonged cycling at high discharge/charge rates. Thus, these significant performances control a very attractive feature and stability of the present porous Co3V2O8 microsphere electrode.
Although the practical comparison of the electrochemical properties of the already reported Co3V2O8 can be complicated because of the different fabrication conditions followed by various research groups, it is worth mentioning that the performance of the present Co3V2O8 microsphere electrode is competitive. For example, the prismatic pencil type Co3V2O8 electrodes synthesized by hydrothermal reaction delivered a discharge capacity of 847 mA h g−1 after 255 cycles at 0.5 A g−1,23 and a hydrothermally synthesized sponge network type electrode exhibited discharge capacities of 730 and 501 mA h g−1 after 140 and 700 cycles at current densities of 0.5 and 1 A g−1, respectively.24 Furthermore, the mesoporous Co3V2O8/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite electrode, delivered a stable reversible capacity of 899 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 600 cycles whereas the bare Co3V2O8 nanoparticles showed relatively poor capacity even at a very low current density of 0.05 A g−1.26 In comparison, the present CVO microsphere electrode retains discharge capacities of 995 and 940 mA h g−1 after 120 and 100 cycles even at higher current densities of 0.5 and 1 A g−1, respectively. More importantly, at current densities as high as 5 A g−1, the CVO microsphere electrode registered average discharge capacities of 650 mA h g−1 with almost 100% CEs after 400 cycles. This value is much higher than the reported values of 470 mA h g−1 of multilayered nanosheets,22 and ∼600 mA h g−1 of interconnected hollow microspheres.25 To the best extent of the authors' knowledge, the reported discharge capacity values are highest among the CVO electrodes reported so far (see Table 1) and are also higher than those achieved by the solvothermally synthesized CVO electrode reported by us earlier.24 Therefore, these observations clearly demonstrate that the present Co3V2O8 electrode synthesized using a MOF-based combustion strategy with a one-pot technique displays remarkable electrochemical properties for LIB applications.

The substantial performance observed for the present CVO electrode can be correlated with the porous microsphere morphology governed by the MOF intermediate. A rapid MOF formation followed by thermal decomposition leads to nanometer sized particles that agglomerate to form a spherical morphology with a porous network. In addition, a reasonable surface area of 40 m2 g−1 tends to improve the diffusion kinetics by shortening the diffusion pathway for better electronic and ionic transport. The porous feature facilitates greater electrolyte penetration and tends to increase active sites for electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the electrode allows for a minimum volume change during simple ion insertion/extraction. All these factors contribute synergistically to the high lithium storage capability even under prolonged cycling at elevated discharge/charge rates. Nevertheless, the present porous CVO electrode prepared by a simple, scalable, and rapid synthetic protocol has great potential to serve as a high rate anode material for advanced LIBs and possible sodium battery applications. Furthermore, the present one-pot MOF-based combustion synthesis can serve as a promising protocol to directly produce nanostructured mixed metal oxide electrodes with unique morphologies for various applications including energy storage.
Conclusions
A porous Co3V2O8 microsphere electrode was prepared using a simple MOF-based combustion technique for high energy LIB applications. The one-pot synthesis overrides the complexities of using time-consuming and costly procedures and/or equipment. The structural and electron microscopic studies revealed that primary phase pure CVO particles of 20–50 nm average diameters aggregate to form secondary microspheres with porous morphologies. This unique morphology was found to be derived from the Co-V–MOF intermediate network formed in situ during the synthesis. The prepared porous Co3V2O8 microsphere electrode demonstrated excellent cyclability and rate performances (940 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and 650 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1 and 5 A g−1, respectively). The enhanced properties could be attributed to the porous microsphere morphology in addition to the nanoscale particle dimensions and high surface area of the Co3V2O8 electrode. Thus, the remarkable electrode performance predicts the potential of this anode to be employed in advanced high energy LIBs. Furthermore, this new, simple, cost-effective and rapid synthetic protocol may unlock opportunities for developing promising metal oxides including phase pure multi-metal oxides with unique morphologies not only for the next-generation high power LIBs and possible sodium battery applications but also other energy related applications including photocatalytic water splitting, hydrogen production and solar cell fabrication.
