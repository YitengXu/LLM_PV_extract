    , Accepted 2nd February 2016First published on 2nd February 2016AbstractA selective photoluminescence method based on Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs) functionalized with carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin for the direct determination of water-soluble C60 fullerene has been developed. CQDs were synthesized using a top-down methodology from multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and further functionalized with N-Boc-ethylenediamine to confer monoprotected amine groups onto their surface. Once amine-functionalized CQDs were obtained after deprotection, an amidation reaction with carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin cavitands was achieved and the obtained fluorescent β-cyclodextrin functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots (cd-CQDs) were investigated for the inclusion complexation of water-soluble C60. Quenching of their fluorescence was observed owing to the non-covalent self-assembly of cd-CQDs and C60, making possible the quantification of C60. A method to determine water-soluble C60 is then proposed with detection and quantification limits of 0.525 and 1.751 μg mL−1, respectively. The method was validated by determining soluble C60 fullerene in spiked river water. One added value of the paper is the fact that it can be ascribed to the “Third Way in Analytical Nanoscience and Nanotechnology”.
Introduction
This work represents an excellent example of the trending topic known as the “Third Way in Analytical Nanoscience and Nanotechnology” (AN&N)1 which involves the use of biocompatible nanoparticles as tools – sorbents,2 sensors, etc. – for the analysis of other nanomaterials in the same analytical process. By way of example, our group has already reported the use of carbon-based nanodots as a selective sensor of carboxylated-MWCNTs3 and metallic nanoparticles such as gold4 and silver5,6 nanoparticles.
Amongst carbon materials, fullerenes7, which were considered as the third allotropic form of carbon after graphite and diamond, have been well-known for many years thanks to their rich chemistry, powerful antioxidant and catalytic characters, and their high power conversion efficiencies. In particular, in this decade biocompatible pristine and water-soluble fullerenes (C60) have gradually become a rising star in the nanocarbon family in a wide range of applications related to life science, for example in the monitoring of aquatic systems, in vehicles, medicine, and cancer therapeutics,8 in the treatment of neuro-degenerative disorders,9 in biomolecular optical devices, and in cosmetics.10 For instance, their excellent abilities for disinfection, and microbial control11 and metal removal12 in water offers a great opportunity for purification systems. Related to medicine and cosmetic issues, researchers are extensively investigating new methods for obtaining these soluble fullerene derivatives in water using many different strategies to take advantage of their properties.13,14
However, early studies have shown that C60 derivatives produce oxidative cell damage15–19 due to their easy penetration through skin20,21 and being retained in the body for a long period.22 It is certain that pristine fullerenes are more toxic than water-soluble fullerenes,23,24 but the widespread use of such water-soluble nanoparticles and their negative interactions with environmental species, such as algae, plants and fungi, will combine in a few years to cause potential adverse effects in this early stage of nanotechnology. In fact, the lack of risk assessment and regulation not only promotes the need for further studies about their toxicity and interaction with the environment and living organisms, but also for urgent methodologies to monitor them.
Cyclodextrins (cd) have frequently been applied in many fields25–27 ranging from environmental protection28 to biomedical science29 thanks to their ability to form supramolecular host–guest inclusion complexes with suitably sized hydrophobic molecules or even nanomaterials as guests. The capability of β-cyclodextrin (β-cd) and γ-cyclodextin (γ-cd) to either partially or entirely accommodate C60 derivatives is well known, because of their suitable cavity size. Many authors focused their attention on the enhancement of C60 solubilization in aqueous media as a result of the inclusion complexation for different purposes – e.g. cancer photodynamic therapy30 – whereas others studied the reactivity of C60 upon encapsulation inside γ-cd as an opportune host against ozone degradation.31
Interestingly, few applications of nanomaterials containing such cavitands are described,32–38 in particular those based on fluorescent carbon nanodots39 because of their non-toxicity, high biocompatibility and quantum yield and easy surface functionalization.40,41 Baruah et al. have already described the preparation of spherical nanodots from chitosan hydrogel, which were electrostatically capped with β-cyclodextrin, for the detection of fluoride.42 As part of our ongoing research on detection of potential nanocontaminants and based on the intrinsic C60 affinity to β-cd,43,44 herein we described an easy way to prepare covalently linked β-cyclodextrin-based CQDs, cd-CQDs, via amidation reactions for the self-assembly of water-soluble polyhydroxilated C60 present in water. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on non-covalent inclusion complexation of C60 with β-cd covalently capped Carbon Quantum Dots, C60/cd-CQDs. The applicability of the proposed method has been corroborated in river water samples.
Experimental
Reagents
Sulfuric acid (95–98%), nitric acid (69%), chloroform and ethanol (99%) were purchased from PANREAC, S.A.U. (Barcelona, Spain). N,N′-Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC, 98%), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, 97%), triethylamine (TEA, 99%), N-Boc-ethylenediamine (Boc-EDA, 98%), carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrin sodium salt (CMβ-cd), Kaiser test kits, tribasic sodium citrate (99.5%), acetone (99.9%), humic acid (HA), triton™ X-100, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS, 99%), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 99%), sodium chloride (99%) and C60 fullerenes (99.5%, 0.7 nm) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). MWCNTs were purchased from Bayer (Germany).
Instrumentation
Fluorescence emission and absorption spectra were recorded on a PTI QuantaMaster™ spectrofluorimeter from Photon Technology International equipped with a 75 W Xenon short arc lamp and a model 814 PMT detection system. Felix 32 software was used to collect and process fluorescence data.
Infrared spectra were obtained with a Tensor 27 FT-MIR Bruker spectrophotometer equipped with a Hyperion 2000 microscope using samples mounted in KBr pellets.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM 1400 microscope for the characterization of cd-CQDs with a point-to-point resolution of 0.38 nm.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained through integration with a Raman spectrometer (alpha 500) using ultrasharp tapping mode tips in an intermittent contact mode.
An ultrasonic bath PCE-UC 20 (with a capacity of 2 liters) and a Selecta Centronic-BL II centrifuge were also used.
Synthesis and functionalization of CQDs
CQDs were obtained from MWCNTs as previously described.45 After the activation of the fluorescence of the passivated CQDs (p-CQDs) by introducing carboxylic groups onto their surface, amide formation with Boc-EDA was performed using NHS and DIC as coupling agents as reported elsewhere.5 The as-prepared CQDs were heated for 10 minutes at 100 °C to remove the Boc groups and the obtained amine-CQDs (a-CQDs) were then treated with CMβ-cd. The procedure was performed in two steps as follows: in a 50 mL single neck flask 50 mg of NHS (0.5 mmol) and 126 mg DIC (1 mmol) were added to 200 mg of CMβ-cd (0.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred under an inert atmosphere, then 4 mL of deoxygenated a-CQDs at neutral pH and 5 μL of TEA (3.58 × 10−3 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred for 24 hours under an inert atmosphere at room temperature. After that, a second functionalization step was carried out for incrementing the amount of cavitands attached onto the CQD surface; 50 mg of NHS (0.5 mmol), 126 mg DIC (1 mmol) and 400 mg of CMβ-cd (0.25 mmol) were added to the previous functionalized nanomaterial with 5 μL of TEA. This mixture was stirred under an inert atmosphere for 20 hours and the product (cd-CQDs) was purified by washing with chloroform.
The colorimetric Kaiser test46 was performed in triplicate for each sample in order to know the content of the amine groups on the CQD surface. Kaiser test solutions containing phenol in ethanol (75 μl), KCN in pyridine (100 μl) and ninhydrin in ethanol (75 μl) were sequentially added to 1 mL of three different CQDs: p-CQDs (with carboxylic groups onto their surface), a-CQDs and cd-CQDs. Each mixture was heated for 7 minutes at 100 °C with observation of a colour change. Then, ethanol (60%) was added, a ten-fold dilution being necessary for measurements in the UV-Visible region.
Potential interferences
Water-soluble C60 was obtained following the procedure described by Kokubo et al. in 2008.47 10 mL of hydrogen peroxide solution (30%) was added to 0.1 g of C60 in a single-neck flask and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for three days. The water-soluble C60 was then separated from any aggregate using filtration and stored at room temperature until use.
For the interference assay, pristine C60 was dispersed with different surfactants (SDS, CTAB, Triton-X) and with natural organic matter like HA at different concentrations until a stable dispersion of pristine C60 was obtained. Only HA at a concentration of 16.5 μg mL−1 gave a very stable dispersion to be used as standards.
Determination of water-soluble fullerene
Between different dilutions (1:3, 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20) of the as-prepared cd-CQDs in aqueous solution at physiological pH, an optimized ten-fold dilution was selected as stock solution. Thus, the determination of water-soluble C60 was achieved using fluorescence measurements; increasing concentrations of water-soluble C60 (0.5–10 μg mL−1) were added to ten-fold diluted cd-CQDs with the fluorescence being recorded at room temperature. The Stern–Volmer equation was used to describe the fluorescence quenching of the cd-CQDs using C60 as an analyte, where I0 and I are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of C60.I0/I = 1 + Ksv[C60]
The proposed method was validated by determining water-soluble C60 in river samples from the Rabanales River (Spain). The samples were filtered firstly through a nylon filter (0.45 μm) and then through diatomaceous earth to remove organic matter. The samples were stored at 4 °C until analysed.
Results and discussion
Characterization of cd-CQDs
Fluorescent a-CQDs obtained as in our previous work5 were covalently functionalized with CMβ-cd. The as-prepared nanoparticles were 2.4–3.6 nm in size as determined by TEM (Fig. 1A and B) and AFM (Fig. 1C). Although the exact PL origins are still in debate, the PL properties of CQDs can be explained by two main mechanisms: the first one related to the intrinsic state emission owing to the electron–hole recombination of the core, and a second one related to the defect state emission due to the superficial functional groups. Luminescence of the as-prepared CQDs was studied at different excitation wavelengths ranging from 350 nm to 420 nm. The maximum excitation centred at 357 nm was not dependent on emission wavelength which means that there are no differences at the core and the emission is mainly due to the superficial defects. Fig. 1D shows the emission spectra with a maximum at 442 nm under an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and the absorption band of cd-CQDs.

The FTIR spectrum of cd-CQDs illustrated in Fig. 1E shows the typical characteristic absorption peaks of the cavitand at 3412, 2923, 1146 and 1028 cm−1 corresponding to the symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching modes of the –OH and C–H bonds and the stretching and bending modes of the C–O–C bonds. Furthermore, additional peaks at 1701 and 1595 cm−1 attributed to the CO and CC stretching modes of the CQDs with amide bonds confirm their successful functionalization.
Interestingly, the photoluminescence intensity decreases after complete functionalization with β-cd if compared with both carboxylated and amine functionalized CQDs, as depicted in Fig. 2A; such diminution is in accordance with other reports of carbon nanoparticles capped with cyclodextrins.42,48 Notice that the first functionalization reaction gave rise to CQDs with a low functionalization degree; that is, the photoluminescence intensity of the resulting CQDs slightly decreases as well as the Kaiser test corroborating a high percentage of free amine groups on the CQD surface. However, after the second functionalization reaction a significant reduction of the emission intensity was observed. Furthermore, selecting quinine sulphate as the standard and 360 nm as the excitation wavelength, the quantum yield for cd-CQDs at these conditions was 1.7%, which is lower than that of p-CQDs and a-CQDs (10 and 3%, respectively) of previous works.5,45 It is known that the quantum size effect and surface defects are responsible for the photoluminescence mechanism of the CQDs. As the core diameter of all three CQDs remains almost the same, no change in the maximum excitation wavelength was observed; thus, the superficial modification may lead to different electronic properties which resulted in the variations of the fluorescent intensity for cd-CQD.48 Furthermore, the complete functionalization was monitored using the Kaiser test kit by taking into consideration the degree of free amine groups covalently linked to the CQD surface. Three different types of CQDs (p-CQDs, a-CQDs and cd-CQDs) were analysed in triplicate. As expected, no amine groups were observed in p-CQDs whereas the amount of free amine groups for a-CQDs and cd-CQDs was 1.4 and 0.52 mmol L−1, respectively. Fig. 2B shows the images of the obtained colourless and coloured solutions after the colorimetric Kaiser test. It can be observed that in cd-CQDs free amine groups are still present on the CQD surface owing to the steric hindrance arising from the dimensions of β-cd that make difficult the complete amine functionalization.

For the as-prepared cd-CQDs the maximum fluorescence intensity of the ten-fold dilution in aqueous solution was used for all the fluorescence assays. It is essential to mention their high stability towards a wide range of pH (from 3 to 9) and ionic strength (0.1 to 0.5 M of NaCl) of the media in terms of the photoluminescence emission properties.
β-Cyclodextrin functionalized carbon quantum dots as a fluorescent nanosensor of C60
Taking into consideration that the β-cd cavity is suitable for spherically shaped guests such as C6043,49, and that the inclusion complexation is governed by the two repulsive forces between the encapsulated water molecules and the apolar cyclodextrin cavity and between the apolar fullerene and the bulk water, we proposed the use of cd-CQDs as sensor of soluble C60 in aquatic environments. Thus, photoluminescence studies of three different CQDs (p-CQDs, a-CQDs and cd-CQDs) were carried out in the presence of water-soluble C60. As expected, cd-CQDs were the only ones which exhibit a high photoluminescence response towards C60 as a result of the inclusion complexation process, forming C60/cd-CQDs (see Fig. 3A). Thus, this complexation may induce an energy transfer between cd-CQDs and C60.
 Fig. 3  Representative scheme (A) and AFM image (B) of C60/cd-CQDs. 
Furthermore, there are apparent differences between cd-CQDs and C60/cd-CQDs in their emission wavelength position and band width, which corroborates such host–guest interaction. In fact, the maximum emission for the C60/cd-CQDs was shifted 5 nm to longer wavelengths, whereas the excitation remained unchanged. It is known that a red-shifted emission is related to an increase in the nanoparticle size; thus, AFM shows the increase in the size of the nanoparticles to 7 nm possibly due to the inclusion complexation of fullerene around the CQD surface, C60/cd-CQDs (see Fig. 3B).
The stability of the inclusion complex C60/cd-CQDs was also evaluated by varying the pH and ionic strength of the media. In that case, only a little decrease in their PL signal appears up to 0.5 M of NaCl, possibly due to the aggregation of the nanomaterials that inhibit the emission of the CQDs.
Analytical potential
The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the analytical potential of cd-CQDs based on direct host:guest interaction with the analyte. The present research focused on the detection of water-soluble C60 by monitoring the fluorescence emission properties of cd-CQDs. The analytical features of the proposed method were evaluated using the Stern–Volmer equation for increasing concentrations of C60 (0.5–10 μg mL−1). The calibration plot and the stacked fluorescence spectra are depicted in Fig. 4A and B, giving the following equation: I0/I = 1.2133 + 0.1[C60], with R2 = 0.9933. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were calculated as three and ten times the standard deviation (SD) of the blank divided by the slope of the equation, being 0.525 and 1.751 μg mL−1, respectively, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 6.6%.

Based on the fact that water-soluble C60 are not the only carbonaceous nanoparticles present in aquatic environments coming from industry and consequently accumulated in the environment, pristine C60 and carboxylated-MWCNTs were used as potential interferences. To disperse the pristine C60 in aqueous media it was necessary to add increasing concentrations of surfactants like SDS, CTAB, Triton-X and HA until a very stable aqueous dispersion was obtained. The best result was obtained with HA at a concentration of 16.5 μg mL−1. In that case, this organic matter surrounding the pristine C60 was responsible for the photoluminescence changes of the cd-CQDs. In the case of carboxylated-MWCNTs no significant quenching was observed, but at high concentrations of carboxylated-MWCNTs the fluorescence increases up to 10% possibly due to π–π stacking interactions between both analyte and interference nanomaterials.
Validation of the proposed method
The applicability of the method was studied with Rabanales River samples (Spain). Preliminary experiments indicate that no water-soluble C60 was found in the river water; consequently, it was necessary to enrich the samples with increasing concentrations of water-soluble C60 (0.5–10 μg mL−1). It is important to mention that after filtering the river water through a 25 μm nylon membrane incongruous results were obtained in the quenching of the fluorescence of cd-CQD. For that reason, it was necessary to remove the organic matter with a diatomaceous earth cartridge using an SPE column. Once all samples were filtered as indicated before, a linear response with R2 of 0.9931 was obtained, indicating that no matrix effect was observed, and so the proposed method can be applicable in aquatic environments.
This strategy is another example of the use of CQDs in the “Third Way in AN&N”. It is not the first time that fluorescent nanomaterials have been used for the direct determination of fullerene in water samples. Although another report33 proposed the use of semiconductor (CdSe/ZnS) quantum dots coated by p-tertbutylcalix[8]arene as a nanosensor of C60 combined with a liquid–liquid extraction step, we report the direct detection in aqueous media without the need for any additional steps.
Conclusions
With the aim to evaluate the ability of CQDs in determining and quantifying water-soluble C60 fullerene as an analyte, a straightforward protocol is proposed involving the inclusion complexation of water-soluble C60 (acting as a guest) into the cyclodextrin cavities attached to CQDs (acting as a host). The quantification of the analyte is performed owing to a diminishing of the CQD fluorescence as signal response versus the concentration of the analyte. The method possesses excellent discrimination of water soluble C60 from other common carbonaceous organic materials present in aquatic environments. The inclusion complexation process endowed this host:guest system with further potential applications in cosmetics, solar cells and even in analytical and biological fields, extending this capability to other sensing or imaging processes.
