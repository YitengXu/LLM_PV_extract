Among the various adsorbents explored by the scientific community for CO2 removal from flue gases, graphene is receiving increased attention because of its unique molecular structure and many exciting properties such as high mechanical strength, excellent thermal conductivity, good chemical stability, large accessible surface area, and tunable porosity. In addition, the facile surface functionalization of graphene leads to production of innovative graphene-based materials that have the potential to be applied as advanced next-generation CO2 adsorbents.

1. Introduction
Atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise rapidly in response to increased combustion of fossil fuels, especially coal, to meet the world's growing energy demand. Because CO2 is a major greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change, a rapid transition to a sustainable low carbon energy system has become an absolute necessity. However, coal is still affordable, reliable and abundantly available.1 Many countries have huge coal reserves within their geographical borders, and are therefore unlikely to reduce their reliance on this fossil fuel in the short- and intermediate-term.2 Moreover, between now and 2050, the world economy is projected to rise exponentially in the emerging and developing nations.3 Such rapid economic growth will inevitably require increased energy consumption, much of which would likely come from coal. As a consequence, mitigation of CO2 emissions from coal and other fossil fuel-fired power plants is of increased concern from the climate change viewpoint.
There is a widespread consensus that the selective removal of CO2 from flue gases, followed by its compression and subsequent sequestration in deep underground geologic formations, can effectively reduce the carbon footprint of existing power plants.4,5 The importance of such carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a short/medium-term technological option to curb anthropogenic energy-related CO2 emissions has been globally recognized.6,7 However, despite extensive research on CO2 capture from flue gases, progress in deploying CCS-based technologies has been impeded mainly due to technical difficulties in the efficient extraction of CO2 from the exhaust of coal-fired power plants and expensive operations associated with this separation process.8 Hence, there is an urgent need to develop efficient CO2 capture techniques, such as those potentially offered by solid adsorbents, to achieve a secure, cost-effective and low-carbon electricity supply for the foreseeable future.9,10
Among the various solid adsorbents that are currently being explored for capturing CO2 emanating from fossil fuel combustion systems, graphene, a novel two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial with a wide range of intriguing characteristics, is receiving considerable attention.11 Indeed, substantial scientific progress has been made in recent years in terms of evaluating the performance of graphene and its derivatives as adsorbents for selective separation of CO2 under different flue gas conditions. At the same time, there remain a range of technical challenges that need to be overcome in order to make graphene-based materials next-generation CO2 adsorbents. This review therefore brings together the current knowledge available in the literature in the development of graphene-based CO2 adsorbents, identifies key knowledge gaps, and provides new strategic research directions toward the use of graphene-based CO2 adsorbents for large-scale industrial applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of its kind in the rapidly evolving cross-disciplinary field of graphene-mediated CO2 adsorption.
2. Current status of CO2 capture technologies
Efficient capture of CO2 from large point sources of air pollution is a top global priority for stabilizing the CO2 level in the atmosphere. This goal can be achieved by adopting one of the following three strategies (Fig. 1): (1) pre-combustion capture, where the carbon content of the fuel is stripped off prior to combustion by reacting it with steam (known as ‘steam reforming’) or oxygen (known as ‘partial oxidation’ or ‘gasification’), producing a syngas composed mainly of CO and H2 which is then subsequently reacted with steam (through a water–gas shift reaction), thereby generating additional H2 and oxidizing CO to CO2; (2) post-combustion capture, where CO2 is removed from a flue gas resulting from the burning of fossil fuels in ambient air; and (3) oxyfuel-combustion systems, where the combustion is performed in pure oxygen instead of air leading to a flue gas that primarily consists of CO2 and H2O.12–14 Among the three approaches, oxyfuel-combustion is a near-zero emission technology for both new and existing pulverized fossil-fired power stations.15 However, oxy-combustion options are still under development and will require significantly more effort to reach operational and commercial readiness.16 In contrast, both pre-combustion and post-combustion capture are technically feasible and have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by a gigaton or more per year.17Table 1 summarizes the typical composition and physical condition of flue gas streams relevant to pre- and post-combustion CO2 capture processes. Evidently, each of these capture scenarios entails different gas separation requirements and constraints mainly due to variations in the flue gas composition and operating environment as well as inconsistency in physical properties (i.e., effective kinetic diameter, dipole moment, quadrupole moment and polarization) of the gases involved (see Table 2). For example, in pre-combustion capture, a concentrated, high-pressure, and hot CO2/H2 mixture has to be treated where the difference in polarizability between the gases is considerably large whereas in post-combustion capture, a diluted, low-pressure, and wet CO2/N2 mixture has to be treated where the difference in effective kinetic diameter between the gases is relatively small. Accordingly, several technologies with varying degrees of maturity have been proposed for CO2 capture from both concentrated and dilute gas mixtures, including absorption, adsorption, and membrane separation.18,22,23 While chemical absorption with alkanolamines (or variants) can inflict a parasitic energy penalty on top of the energy produced by the power plant,24 most membrane-based gas separation methods are still in their infancy.25 Adsorption, on the other hand, is an attractive option to curb CO2 emissions because of its comparatively less energy requirements and many other competitive advantages (including simplicity of operation, applicability over a relatively wide range of temperature and pressure conditions, and low capital investment costs).26,27

Adsorption technologies use solid adsorbents that allow selective removal of CO2 from various constituents of the flue gas mixture because of different interaction forces between the gases and the solid surface. Depending on the type of adsorbent used, CO2 is adsorbed by either weak attraction forces such as electrostatic or van der Waals forces (physisorption) or through strong chemical bonds (chemisorption).28 These adsorbents are usually employed in a cyclic procedure that alternate between adsorption and desorption modes of operation, with desorption induced by increasing the temperature (temperature swing adsorption (TSA)), reducing the pressure (pressure swing adsorption (PSA)), or by creating a near-vacuum (vacuum swing adsorption (VSA)).29 Since in pre-combustion capture the gas stream is inherently pressurized after the conversion reactions, a PSA process is the most suitable. On the other hand, in post-combustion capture the flue gas is released at near ambient pressure. Compressing or applying a vacuum to such a large volume of gas is difficult; a TSA cycle is therefore the most appropriate.30 Nevertheless, regardless of the regeneration method, almost pure CO2 can be recovered for subsequent sequestration. For adsorption-based gas separations to attain commercial viability, one of the main challenges is the development of suitable adsorbents that satisfy the performance standards for deployment in coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. As described in Table 3, effective adsorbents for carbon capture must possess the following key features: (i) high adsorption capacity, (ii) high selectivity, (iii) moderate heat of adsorption, (iv) fast adsorption and desorption kinetics, and (v) excellent chemical and mechanical stability. These operational criteria should also be finely tuned depending on the type of CO2 capture to be performed (i.e., pre-combustion or post-combustion) and the specific configuration of the power plant (which depends on the type of fuel being burned in that particular plant). Recently, a variety of solid adsorbents have been studied comprehensively for CO2 capture, such as zeolites, porous silica, metal oxides, porous polymers, alumina, activated carbon, carbon fibers, ion-exchange resin, and metal organic frameworks (MOF).9,19,35–43 Some of them have low adsorption capacities and/or require a long time to reach saturation due to slow adsorption kinetics, or sometimes poor selectivity relative to other gases.43 Furthermore, most of these adsorbents exhibit reduced activity in the presence of moisture, low chemical and thermal stability, or weak mechanical properties that lessen their suitability for on-site application.43 There is therefore a pressing need to develop advanced solid adsorbents that can adequately address the inherent requirements of real-world capture systems.
Table 3 Requisite attributes of an ideal CO2 adsorbent27,31–34




Property
Description




High adsorption capacity
Reduces the mass of adsorbent required for a given throughput, lowers the volume of adsorbent bed and minimizes the related equipment size and cost


High selectivity
High selectivity for CO2 against other gases ensures that the CO2 component of the exhaust gas is completely removed for subsequent sequestration


Moderate heat of adsorption
Heats of adsorption at the borderline between strong physisorption and weak chemisorption provide a good trade-off between selectivity and regeneration


Fast kinetics
Decreases capital costs, energy requirements for operation and adsorption cycle times


Chemical/mechanical stability
High chemical stability under the conditions of capture and regeneration maximizes the adsorbent lifetime and reduce replacement rates to a minimum which has a direct impact on the overall economics of the CO2 capture process


Good mechanical stability allows the adsorbent to be pulverized into fine particles and densely packed for the maximum volumetric capacity. It also warrants that the adsorbent is capable of withstanding bulk handling that is a feature of any industrial unit




3. Graphene as next-generation CO2 adsorbents
Since its first isolation in 2004, graphene, a carbon monolayer packed into a honeycomb lattice, has proved itself as an exciting material with a wide range of opportunities for new scientific knowledge generation and technological innovations (Fig. 2).44–46 Graphene already holds tremendous promise for diverse applications: supercapacitors,47,48 energy storage,49–51 catalysis,52 photocatalysis,53 solar cells,54 sensing platforms,55 memory devices,56 molecular imaging,57 3D printing,58 tissue engineering,59 drug delivery,60 water filtration and desalination,61,62 gas separation and storage,63,64 sensors for detection of pollutants,65,66 remediation of air and water,67–71etc. The latest addition to this list is the use of graphene for CO2 adsorption. Research is conducted to provide answers to questions such as (1) would graphene be able to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art adsorbents that are currently known for CO2 removal? (2) Is graphene versatile enough to comply with CCS industry standards? With its amazingly attractive properties, graphene certainly has the potential to be a selective and efficient adsorbent for CO2 capture if its molecular architecture can be rationally tailored for this application.
 Fig. 2  Representation of the honeycomb lattice of graphene and its unit cell (indicated by the dashed line). Each unit cell comprises two equivalent sub-lattices of carbon atoms, joined together by σ bonds. 
Graphene is a strictly 2D material with exceptionally high specific surface area (theoretical value of 2630 m2 g−1).72 Interestingly, by strategically removing atoms from its hexagonal lattice to create pores with radii large enough to admit CO2, adsorbents with concomitantly high CO2 selectivity and high CO2 capacity can be developed.73 These characteristics of graphene render it even more attractive compared to the conventional CO2 adsorbents. In addition, graphene's planar geometry makes it amenable for modification or functionalization,74 providing essentially infinite possibilities to fabricate adsorbents with properties that are precisely tuned for the desired capture setting.
With respect to large-scale industrial capture of CO2, one of the defining features of graphene is its inherent mechanical strength and stiffness. Conventional TSA/PSA processes rely on compact packing of adsorbent particles inside an adsorption column in the form of packed beds for continuous operation. Such high-density packing could cause a collapse of the pores and eventually reduce the adsorbent's effective surface area.75 Additionally, operation with rapid swings in temperature/pressure can lead to mechanical attrition of the adsorbent, causing a host of operational problems that affect the overall performance of the CO2 capture system.75 To overcome those technological challenges, adsorbent materials with excellent mechanical stability are currently sought by both academic and industrial communities. Due to the strong in-plane C–C bonds, graphene has an enormous tensile strength of 130 GPa and an exceedingly large Young's modulus of about 1 TPa, making it 30 times harder than diamonds and 200 times harder than steel.76 Such mechanical properties of graphene are therefore not only attractive for the development of robust adsorbents that can afford high packing densities, but also warrant a long lifetime with a high number of operating cycles. Also, graphene manifests an extraordinary thermal conductivity of up to 5000 W m−1 K−1, which stems from its highly anisotropic nature and the low mass of the carbon atoms.77 For TSA-based CO2 capture, the impressive thermal conductivity of graphene would ensure a high rate of heat transfer through the adsorbent bed, which would in turn reduce the duration of the regeneration cycle, and lower the operating costs. More importantly, graphene is chemically inert and relatively stable under conditions where most other substances would undergo a rapid phase transition and chemical reactions.78 This makes graphene extremely favorable for CO2 capture applications, especially post-combustion capture where substantial quantities of water and other contaminants (O2, SO2, NOX) in the flue gas stream can compromise the long-term stability of the adsorbent. Above all, graphene is environmentally benign and can be easily manufactured by either top down (such as exfoliation from bulk) or bottom up (atom by atom growth) techniques.79–82
Because of these unparalleled attributes, graphene is undoubtedly an appealing material for CO2 sequestration. The unique combination of graphene's structural, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties enables it to be used as an important building block for the next-generation of CO2 adsorbents, which can overcome the shortcomings of the existing ones. Consequently, there has been an enormous effort in recent years to explore graphene and its oxygen-containing analogue, graphene oxide (GO), for CO2 capture applications from both the experimental and theoretical scientific communities. This has led to numerous practical and conceptual developments as discussed in the following section.
4. CO2 adsorption on graphene-based materials
4.1. Experimental exploration and developments
Experimental exploration is the most direct and accurate means of determining the adsorption characteristics of any material, and is a prerequisite for the assessment of its suitability for practical applications. There have been many rigorous attempts to quantify the CO2 capture profile of graphene or its derivatives over a broad range of temperature and pressure conditions (Table 4). These efforts have mostly focused on the measurement of the pure CO2 gas isotherm: the plot of the amount of gas adsorbed as a function of pressure at a constant temperature.116 The isotherm is an empirical outcome from which critical information about the quality of the adsorbent material such as adsorption capacity, selectivity and enthalpy of adsorption can be extracted. Although a variety of analytical techniques are available to measure gas adsorption on solids (volumetry, gravimetry, oscillometry, calorimetry, impedance spectroscopy, nuclear resonance and combinations thereof),117,118 the volumetric (also called manometric) and the gravimetric methods are commonly used to obtain CO2 isotherms of graphene materials. In the volumetric approach, the volume of a gas adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbent is determined from the pressure drop before and after adsorption in a closed system using the ideal gas equation.120 Gravimetric techniques, on the other hand, estimate the quantity of a gas adsorbed by detecting the weight change of the adsorbent sample in response to its exposure to a step change in the gas pressure.119 While the gravimetric method is inherently more accurate and easier to automate,120 the volumetric method has been more frequently applied for its simplicity.

One of the primary initiatives to experimentally assess the CO2 adsorption performance of graphene came from Rao and co-workers.83 They measured the volumetric CO2 isotherm of graphene samples synthesized from different carbon precursors. At −78 °C and 1 bar, graphene obtained from exfoliation of GO adsorbed up to 7.8 mmol g−1 whereas those from thermal conversion of nanodiamonds up to 8.6 mmol g−1. Regardless of the precursor used, CO2 adsorption on graphene was completely reversible and no significant hysteresis was observed on the desorption branches of the isotherms, suggesting weak intermolecular forces were involved. Moreover, based on density functional theory calculations the binding energy of a CO2 molecule was estimated to be −59.1 kJ mol−1, indicating the occurrence of physical adsorption of CO2 onto graphene. This finding was confirmed by Mishra and Ramaprabhu who examined the uptake of CO2 by graphene, produced via hydrogen-induced thermal exfoliation of GO at 200 °C, using infrared (IR) spectroscopy.84 Beyond the normal hydroxyl (3435 cm−1), carboxyl (1726 cm−1) and carbonyl (1173 cm−1) peaks, a new band corresponding to the asymmetric stretching of CO2 appeared at 2324 cm−1 in the IR spectra, implying physisorption of CO2 onto graphene sheets. Mishra and Ramaprabhu further demonstrated that graphene has the potential for CO2 abatement under operating conditions likely to be encountered in an actual flue gas treatment system.84 They achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of 12 mmol g−1 at 11 bar and 100 °C. In another recent work, Wang et al. recorded CO2 and H2O isotherms for a 3D mesoporous graphene material with a specific surface area of 477 m2 g−1.85 A major hysteresis appeared between the CO2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, indicating strong electrostatic interactions between the unsaturated sp2 bonds at the edge of the graphene plane and the polar CO2 molecules. No distinct hysteresis loop was observed for H2O adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing that the 3D graphene material was highly hydrophobic and hence merits further consideration for capturing CO2 from wet flue gas.
Graphene as a bulk material, however, has the tendency to form irreversible agglomerates, behaving as particulate graphite platelets, due to strong van der Waals force between the large and planar basal planes. The formation of agglomerates causes a significant decrease of the ultrahigh surface area of 2D graphene sheets.121 Since gas adsorption behavior is mainly governed by the surface area and pore characteristics of the adsorbent material,90 the introduction of nanopores into graphene sheets has been identified as one of the most effective methods for improving the adsorption performance of graphene materials.122 Depending on the pressure at which CO2 capture will be carried out, pores of different dimension contribute the most: narrow micropores or ultramicropores (pore widths < 0.7 nm) govern the CO2 uptake at low pressures (i.e., post-combustion applications) whereas at high pressures (i.e., pre-combustion capture) large micropores/small mesopores (pores below 2.0–3.0 nm) are preferred.123,124 As such, rapid and fruitful developments have been made to introduce nanopores in graphene for better CO2 adsorption. Owing to their porous structure, such holey graphene scaffolds have a higher surface area and much more “space” for capturing and storing CO2 compared to pristine graphene.121 Meng and Park thermally exfoliated GO sheets in a vacuum (Fig. 3, top), producing graphene nanoplates (GNPs) with broad pore size distribution (including supermicropores with widths ∼1.2 nm, mesopores between 20 and 50 nm, and macropores around 90 nm) and appreciable porosity (1.7 cm3 g−1).86 The GNPs proved to be extremely suitable for separating CO2 from flue gases at high pressures and room temperature: 56.4 mmol g−1 at 25 °C and 30 bar. Meanwhile, Ning et al. demonstrated graphene nanomesh (GNM), a novel type of graphene structure with in-plane pores, as an excellent candidate for trapping CO2 at high pressures.87 The GNM, obtained through chemical vapor deposition using porous layered MgO as a template, had a flat box-like structure with a specific surface area of up to 2038 m2 g−1 and supermicropores of ∼1 nm, which resulted in a superior CO2 uptake of 36.5 mmol g−1 at 1 °C and 31 bar. Subsequently, Xia et al. synthesized graphene with trimodal micro–meso–macroporous system by CO2 activation of GO (Fig. 3, bottom).88 Volumetric gas adsorption measurements indicated that these hierarchical porous graphene (HPG) sheets could adsorb about 1.8 mmol CO2 per gram at 0 °C and 1 bar. The isosteric heat of adsorption at low surface coverage confirmed physical interactions between CO2 and HPG. Furthermore, HPG could undergo multiple rounds of recycling without any significant drop in capture efficiency. Likewise, Sui et al. prepared highly efficient graphene-based porous CO2 adsorbents through steam activation of graphene aerogel.89 More interestingly, Kumar et al. developed porous graphene frameworks (PGFs) via covalent linking of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers with 1,4-diethynylbenzene (PGF-1) or 4,4′-diethynylbiphenyl (PGF-2).90 Due to the C–C coupling between the graphene layers and the linkers, the PGFs displayed large specific surface areas and high thermal stability, as well as good CO2 storage capacities at both low and high pressures.

There is also a concerted effort to further improve the CO2 separation ability of graphene for practical deployment. To this end, heteroatom (N, S, B, etc.) doping has been found to endow graphene materials with greater capacity and selectivity for CO2.91–95,125 Kim and colleagues fabricated a series of N- or S-doped graphene-based carbons from different kinds of graphene/polymer composites (graphene/polypyrrole,91 rGO/polyaniline,92 rGO/polyindole,93 and rGO/polythiophene94) by chemical (KOH) activation at temperatures in the range of 400–800 °C. The synthesized materials featured high surface area, large pore volume and profound microporosity (Fig. 4). Consequently, the doped graphene samples adsorbed large volumes of CO2 under ambient conditions (>4 mmol g−1), which was comparable with or even higher than many other solid adsorbents: activated carbons, amine functionalized silica and MOFs. Additionally, the materials had impressive selectivity for CO2 over N2 (post-combustion CO2 capture), H2 (pre-combustion CO2 capture), and CH4 (an important separation for natural gas sweetening) (see Table 4), and could also be easily regenerated for repeated use. A detailed analysis of the adsorption phenomena disclosed that the CO2 uptake by these high-performance adsorbents was directly correlated with their specific surface area, pore dimensions, as well as the dopant concentration. While high activation temperatures improved the textural characteristics of the samples, it significantly reduced their dopant content. Accordingly, the Kim group recommended that heteroatom-doped graphene procured at relatively lower temperatures (600–700 °C) was suitable for industrial setting. With the same design principle, Oh et al. proposed a low-level B-doped graphene adsorbent having excellent recycling properties, derived by reacting GO with a borane–tetrahydrofuran (BH3–THF) adduct, for CO2 separation processes.95 The amount of CO2 adsorbed by B-doped graphene (1.8 mmol g−1) was at least 35% higher than that by the parent material (1.3 mmol g−1).

Alternatively, non-covalent functionalization with poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) can also sufficiently enhance the carbon sequestration efficiency of graphene sheets.96 Upon functionalization, IL moieties uniformly cover graphene, masking the lattice adsorption sites (structural defects). PIL moieties, on the other hand, form porous nanoparticles that are well distributed on the graphene surface, providing greater access to the adsorption sites. Inevitably, with PIL functionalization a 22% increment in CO2 adsorption capacity was attained, whereas IL functionalization resulted in just a 2% increase.
Additional attempts to upgrade the CO2 adsorption properties of graphene have focused on incorporating the bulk material into various organic/inorganic matrices. As depicted in Fig. 5, Zhou et al. prepared porous graphene/terpyridine complex hybrids through an azide–alkyne click reaction between alkynyl group modified GO (alkynyl–GO) and azido–terpyridine complex.97 The introduction of N-rich terpyridine units between graphene sheets not only increased the surface area and porosity of the materials, but also created more basic sites for adsorbing acidic gases, resulting in a CO2 capacity of up to 2.7 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 1 bar. Similarly, Mishra and Ramaprabhu considered graphene/polyaniline composites for CO2 capture.98 The composite showed greater CO2 adsorption than pristine graphene (75 mmol g−1vs. 21.6 mmol g−1 at 11 bar and 25 °C) and also a high degree of recyclability. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the CO2-loaded composite illustrated that the large volume of gas uptake could be attributed to the chemical interaction of CO2 with the N-containing functional groups along with molecular adsorption on the surface of the nanostructured graphene/polyaniline hybrid material. Mishra and Ramaprabhu subsequently developed graphene/Fe3O4 nanocomposites via in situ chemical co-precipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in alkaline solution in the presence of graphene and investigated its CO2 adsorption potential at elevated pressures (11 bar).99 In spite of having a low specific surface area (∼98 m2 g−1), graphene/Fe3O4 could deliver a large CO2 separation capacity of 60 mmol g−1 at 25 °C which decreased to 24 mmol g−1 at 100 °C. On the basis of FTIR spectral profiles, it was concluded that physicochemical interactions were responsible for the high CO2 capture by the composite (Fig. 6). In a similar way, Ding and co-workers reported graphene/Mn3O4 porous materials, formulated by a facile hydrothermal reaction, for CO2 removal at low temperatures and ambient pressure.100

Along with binary hybrids, ternary hybrid hierarchical structures have recently been explored as a new strategy to revamp the CO2 performance of graphene. For example, Yang et al. constructed an efficient graphene-based organic–inorganic ternary solid CO2 adsorbent (PEI/G-silica) using a nanocasting technique outlined in Fig. 7.101 Such unique architecture enabled a strong synergetic effect of each component: large surface area and high thermal conductivity of graphene (G), uniform porosity and flexible morphology of mesoporous silica, and large CO2 potential of polyethyleneimine (PEI). As a result, the sandwich-like PEI/G-silica complex boasted an excellent CO2 capacity (4.3 mmol g−1 at 75 °C) and long-term cycling stability (∼20 cycles).
 Fig. 7  Schematic of the fabrication method of PEI/G-silica sheets. The procedure involves three steps: (1) synthesis of GO-porous silica sheets via GO as the template, (2) pyrolysis of GO-porous silica sheets at 700 °C under an Ar atmosphere to produce graphene–silica sheets, (3) impregnation of PEI into graphene–silica sheets.

Apart from graphene, its close chemical cousin, graphene oxide (GO), too has received a great deal of attention as CO2 adsorbent. By applying a gas pressurizing technique, Lee and Park produced exfoliated GO that exhibited a remarkable CO2 adsorption capacity of 6.4 mmol g−1 at 25 °C because of its large surface area (547 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (2.5 cm3 g−1).102 Notably, Srinivas et al. described the fabrication of highly porous carbon adsorbents, through activation of exfoliated GO precursors with KOH, and their feasibility toward capturing and storing CO2.103 From a close comparison with other porous adsorbents including activated carbons and MOFs, it was inferred that the GO derived carbons were truly promising for CO2 capture applications due to their facile and inexpensive synthesis, tunable porosity, high chemical stability and moderate heat of adsorption. Recently, Sui and Han prepared GO-based 3D hydrogels with interconnected pores by hydrothermal treatment of aqueous GO dispersion at different temperatures (80, 100, and 120 °C) for 16 h (Fig. 8a and b).104 While the hydrogel synthesized at 120 °C showed the best textural features (specific surface area, 870 m2 g−1; total pore volume, 2.2 cm3 g−1), the hydrogel achieved at 100 °C registered the highest capacity (2.4 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 1 bar) and selectivity for CO2 (Fig. 8c). Such anomalies in adsorption capacity may be ascribed to strong surface interactions between CO2 and the hydrogel (involving acid–base interactions, polar interactions, and hydrogen bonding) along with the normal pore-filling process. This was indeed evident from the high isosteric heat of adsorption (−51 kJ mol−1) calculated using the classical Clausius–Clapeyron equation.

Impressively, GO is inherently decorated with oxygen-containing functional groups — either on the basal plane or at the edges — allowing it to interact with a wide variety of organic and inorganic materials. There has, therefore, been considerable interest in developing GO-based composites or functional hybrids with enhanced properties for CO2 adsorption in recent years. For instance, Zhao et al. generated a range of amine-functionalized GO materials through an intercalation reaction of GO with alkylamine molecules, including ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), and triethylenetetramine (TETA), and studied them as solid adsorbents for post-combustion CO2 capture by performing dynamic adsorption tests with a 15% CO2 in N2 gas mixture.126 As can be seen in Fig. 9, the breakthrough time of the amine-functionalized GO samples decreased in the following order: GO/EDA > GO/DETA > GO/TETA, which was in line with their N-content. The GO intercalated with 50% EDA presented the highest CO2 capacity (1.1 mmol g−1) under the experimental conditions. Another important contribution that deserves special mention is the development of TiO2/GO composites for CO2 adsorption beyond its unambiguous implications in (photo)catalysis.105 A series of mesoporous TiO2/GO nanocomposites, with different GO to TiO2 mass ratios (0.10, 0.20 and 0.30), were synthesized by Chowdhury et al. using a simple colloidal blending process and their pure component isotherms were determined up to 1 bar pressure for the temperature range (0 to 50) °C. CO2 adsorption increased with decreasing temperature and increasing adsorbate concentration. TiO2/GO-0.10 with the lowest GO to TiO2 mass ratio demonstrated the highest adsorption rate because of its large specific surface area (100 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (0.4 cm3 g−1). The maximum CO2 adsorption achieved at 25 °C and 1 bar was 1.9 mmol g−1, a value comparatively higher than those of other solid CO2 adsorbents including zeolite, activated carbon and some MOFs. Additionally, the rate of adsorption was very fast, and TiO2/GO-0.10 attained saturation levels in just 3 min. TiO2/GO-0.10 also showed a high selectivity in adsorbing CO2 over N2 under conditions pertinent to post-combustion applications. Furthermore, the low isosteric heat of adsorption at zero coverage (−19.6 kJ mol−1) indicated the possibility of desorbing the gas and regenerating the adsorbent at a much lower energy penalty. It was hypothesized that physisorption as well as chemisorption contributed to the observed composite performance (Fig. 10).

 Fig. 10  Different modes of CO2 chemisorption at the surface of the TiO2/GO-0.10 composite adsorbent (labels 1 M or 2 M refer to the number of metal atoms involved in the adsorption). CO2 is an amphoteric molecule: the carbon atom is acidic while the oxygen atoms are weakly basic. When it is adsorbed as a base, the binding mode can involve one or two oxygen atoms of CO2 (monodentate or bidentate) and one or two Ti centers. As an acidic species, it can bind to the oxygen functionalities at the GO surface (O–C coordinated). Reprinted from Chowdhury et al.,105 Copyright 2014, with permission from Elsevier Ltd. 
Hydrotalcite-like compounds, an emerging class of materials for removing a range of acidic molecules (e.g., H2S, SOX, HCl and CO2) from many industrial processes and waste streams,19 have also been composited with GO for effective CO2 capture from flue gas. Garcia-Gallastegui and colleagues directly precipitated Mg–Al layered double hydroxide(s) (LDH) onto GO sheets in a “layer-by-layer” fashion, followed by calcination at 400 °C in a N2 atmosphere for 4 h, to obtain GO/LDH heterostructured nanohybrids.106 High temperature CO2 adsorption measurements revealed that both CO2 uptake and multicycle stability of the GO/LDH composite were considerably higher than those of the pure LDH (Fig. 11). In a near identical study, Iruretagoyena et al. investigated layered double oxide(s) (LDO) supported on GO sheets for CO2 sequestration.107 Multicycle temperature swing and isothermal N2 purge experiments suggested that the GO/LDO composites retained a greater CO2 capacity and stability compared to pure LDO or pristine GO. Most importantly, the presence of moisture had a positive influence on CO2 removal due to the formation of new adsorption sites as a result of surface rehydration of GO/LDO.

Cross-linking GO with polymers can further lead to high-performing CO2 adsorbents. Sui et al. devised a facile approach to the preparation of lightweight GO/PEI porous materials with 3D interconnected networks under mild conditions (Fig. 12).108 The GO/PEI with bulk densities in the range of 0.02–0.03 g cm−3 displayed a large specific surface area (476 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (1.3 cm3 g−1), offering enormous technological promise for CO2 emission reduction. Alhwaige and co-workers almost simultaneously reported GO/chitosan hybrid aerogels as exciting new adsorbents for CO2 capture.109 N2 (−196 °C) adsorption/desorption measurements corroborated that increasing GO content dramatically increased the specific surface of the GO/chitosan aerogels (Fig. 13). Consequently, the aerogel with the highest GO loading (20%) gave the maximum CO2 uptake at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure (Fig. 13). In addition, the GO/chitosan aerogels showed easy regeneration and good stability over multiple cycles, which is extremely beneficial from a practical viewpoint.

Most recently, Tsoufis et al. intercalated low molecular weight DAB (diaminobutane poly-propylene-imine) dendrimers into the interlayer spacing of GO sheets without the use of any cross-linking agent and evaluated the CO2 adsorption potential of the resulting GO/DAB hybrids under conditions relevant to post-combustion capture.110 Gravimetric gas adsorption measurements indicated that GO/DAB had greater adsorption ability and faster kinetics under wet conditions than under dry conditions. The improvement in adsorption upon wetting could be due to the reaction of CO2 with the primary (through the formation of a zwitterion as an intermediate) and tertiary (by base-catalyzed hydration) amines of the DAB dendrimer to form carbamates and bicarbonates, respectively. Additionally, the presence of water molecules on GO/DAB favored the formation of continuous liquid phase channels, which in turn increased the solubility of CO2 in the water phase, thereby augmenting the adsorption kinetics. It therefore appears that investigating the effect of water vapor on the CO2 adsorption properties of graphene material is of utmost importance. The CO2 uptake profile, as determined from pure-component isotherms, may not always be the best indicator of adsorbent performance in a real-world CO2 capture process and hence the need for addressing the effects of water vapor.
Other than inorganic nanostructures and polymers, MOFs have also been recently composited with GO for the synthesis of novel adsorbents with unique characteristics to efficiently capture CO2 from existing emission sources. In a seminal report, Rao and co-workers described the preparation of GO/ZIF-8 hybrid nanocomposites as intriguing candidates for high volume CO2 capture (Fig. 14a).111 By fine-tuning the GO content, the surface area, pore volume as well as the nanoscale morphology of the composite (from hexagonal to spherical) could be rationally controlled (Fig. 14b). The CO2 capacity of the GO/ZIF-8 composites was remarkably higher compared to the parent MOF and increased with increasing GO concentration. This was attributed to the synergistic effect of ZIF-8 and GO, where the latter provided additional interaction sites for CO2. Furthermore, in a subsequent publication, the Rao group demonstrated GO/Cd-PBM† composites for highly selective adsorption of CO2 from N2.127 Simultaneously, inspired by the findings of the Rao group, Huang et al. synthesized GO/Cu-BTC composites using a solvothermal method for the separation of the CO2/CH4 binary mixture.112 The adsorption of CO2 by GO/Cu-BTC (8.2 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 1 bar) was higher than that by pristine Cu-BTC (6.5 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 1 bar), estimated from single-component gas adsorption isotherms. Analysis of the CO2/CH4 adsorption selectivity (14 at 1 bar or 2.6 times that of Cu-BTC) on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) further established the efficacy of the GO/Cu-BTC composite in CO2 removal applications (Fig. 15a). Another significant contribution recently came from Zhou et al. who showed that the introduction of a small fraction of GO to the MIL-101 framework can result in a robust GO/MIL-101 composite adsorbent with enhanced porosity and improved CO2 uptake.113 The CO2 capacity of GO/MIL-101 at 25 °C and 25 bar was much higher than many traditional adsorbents and most other MOFs including MIL-101. Moreover, IAST calculations revealed that CO2 was more favorably adsorbed than CH4 on GO/MIL-101. In addition, GO/MIL-101 displayed a readily reversible adsorption/desorption under PSA conditions (Fig. 15b). In a similar manner, Cao and colleagues tested GO/UiO-66 as CO2 adsorbents at room temperature.114 The composite exhibited higher surface area and micropore volume compared to UiO-66 (1184 m2 g−1 and 0.3 cm3 g−1vs. 838 m2 g−1 and 0.2 cm3 g−1), whereby as much as 3.4 mmol g−1 CO2 could be adsorbed at 25 °C and 1 bar. Moreover, the GO/UiO-66 manifested a stable adsorption/desorption cycling behavior for continuous operation. Very recently, Bian et al. developed a facile IL-assisted method for in situ growth of Cu3(BTC)2 MOF on GO sheets for improved CO2 adsorption (Fig. 16).115 Three different ILs, namely triethylenetetramine acetate (TETA-Ac), triethylenetetraminetetrafluoroborate (TETA-BF4) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4), were used to investigate the effect of their chemical make-up on the structure and morphology of the resulting ternary composites. Due to its four amine groups in the cation and the contrary acetate anion, TETA-Ac produced GO-IL/MOF composite with the largest surface area (2043 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (0.2 cm3 g−1). As a result, GO–TETA-Ac/Cu3(BTC)2 showed a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 5.6 mmol g−1 and a high CO2/N2 selectivity of 21 at 25 °C and 1 bar. Above all, the composite presented a high CO2 kinetic separation as well as good cyclic adsorption/desorption stability.

4.2. Computational simulations and predictions
With recent growth in computational power, molecular simulations can now provide valuable insights into the interaction of adsorbate molecules with the adsorbent surface, enhancing our ability to interpret experimental observations based on an adsorbent's atomic scale properties and macroscopic functionality.128 Such in-depth fundamental information on an adsorbent's molecular structure in conjunction with experimental data is particularly important for the rational design of new adsorbents tailored to meet the intended operating conditions. In addition, molecular simulations constitute an extremely powerful tool for rapid and systematic screening of both existing and hypothetical adsorbents, necessitating experimental validation of only those that demonstrate the highest level of performance, thus saving time and resources.129 In view of these explicit benefits, there is a growing interest in applying molecular simulation techniques to assess and predict CO2 adsorption on graphene-based materials (Table 5). Much of this work has been shaped and fueled by the general availability of quality simulation facilities including quantum calculations (i.e., density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio simulations), Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

The first molecular simulation of CO2 adsorption on graphene was reported by Cabrera-Sanfelix,130 who carried out DFT calculations to explore the adsorption of CO2 on defective graphene sheets (with a single vacancy) because of their higher chemical reactivity for small molecules compared with pristine (defect-free) graphene (Fig. 17a–c). CO2 was indeed strongly physisorbed on top of the vacancy defect with a physisorption energy of −13.1 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 17d). The molecule was then subsequently chemisorbed at the vacancy defect of the graphene layer, after overcoming an energy barrier of about 96.5 kJ mol−1 relative to the gas phase, by forming a “lactone complex” with an exothermicity of 135.1 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 17e). Following this pioneering study, Liu and Wilcox applied the plane-wave electronic DFT calculations to develop a more rigorous understanding of the underlying mechanism of CO2 adsorption on defective graphene surfaces.131 Specifically, the interaction of CO2 with graphene surfaces containing (i) a monovacancy, (ii) a pentagon–octagon–pentagon (5–8–5) double vacancy, and (iii) the Stone–Wales defect was investigated. The results of DFT optimization implied that the CO2 binding affinity of defective graphene was relatively higher than its pristine counterpart. The physisorption energy of CO2 on the defective graphene site with one carbon atom missing (i.e. monovacancy) was four times as strong as that on a perfect defect-free graphene surface (−20.3 kJ mol−1 on the monovacancy site compared to −4.8 kJ mol−1 on pristine graphene). Based on these findings, one may envisage that the controlled introduction of vacancy defects is a possible scheme to drastically improve the CO2 adsorption profile of graphene.
 Fig. 17  (a), (b) and (c) represent the three initial configurations considered for the physisorption of CO2 on a defected graphene sheet. In the first configuration (a), the CO2 molecule has an initial height of 2.5 Å with its molecular axis parallel to the graphene surface. In the second configuration (b), CO2 is still parallel to the surface but rotated 30° with respect to the structure. In the third configuration (c), the molecule is perpendicularly oriented to the surface. The optimized physisorption state is shown in (d) while the chemisorption of CO2 as a lactone complex on the vacancy defect of the graphene layer is shown in (e).

Ohba and Kanoh inspected the variation in the interaction potentials of edge sites and basal planes of nanographene for CO2 and N2 using GCMC simulations.132 They found that CO2 preferred to be adsorbed on the edge sites whereas N2 on the basal planes. Accordingly, it was reasoned that edge sites of nanographene were centers of strong columbic interaction because of partial charges at the edges, but basal planes had no partial electronic charges, corresponding to near-zero columbic interaction. As a result, CO2 with appreciably higher quadrupole moment than N2 was preferentially adsorbed to the edge sites in the low-pressure region. To our knowledge, this work is the first and perhaps the only simulation-based account on edge effects of nanographene on CO2 adsorption. The results provide preliminary evidence to build adsorbents for selective separation of CO2 from post-combustion flue gas mixture via precise tuning of graphene edges.
In gas adsorption processes, separation is based on differences in the physical properties of the gases, such as polarizability and quadrupole moment, which results in a higher enthalpy of adsorption for certain molecules over others. As can be seen from Table 2, CO2 is a highly quadrupolar gas while the other gases which are likely to be encountered in a CO2 capture system, including N2, O2 and H2, are non-polar or weakly polar. It is therefore intuitively appealing to improve the adsorption capacity and selectivity of graphene by the introduction of functional groups having high affinity for CO2. A good example in this context is the work of Wood et al.133 Using DFT simulations, they systematically quantified the effect of grafting diverse functional substituents (–OH, –NH2, –CH3, –NO2, –COOH, and –H2PO3) on the interaction of CO2 with zigzag graphene nanoribbons. In fact, polar groups, including –COOH, –NH2, –NO2, and –H2PO3, proved promising for enhancing CO2 adsorption by activating exposed edges and terraces to act as suitable gas binding sites. In another recent study, Dasgupta et al. investigated the influence of specific functional moieties on the selective separation of CO2 from CO2/N2 mixtures using a combination of ab initio and classical Monte Carlo simulations.134 A bilayer graphene nanoribbon, edge functionalized with –OH, –NH2, –NO2, –CH3, and –COOH groups, was considered for this purpose. The results of ab initio calculations carried out by employing the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) method confirmed that functionalization augments CO2 as well as N2 binding with the greatest enhancement shown by –COOH (Fig. 18a), which could be attributed to the overall increase in van der Waals interactions owing to the presence of the CO bond. Equilibrium adsorption capacities and heats of adsorption obtained at a temperature of 25 °C and pressures up to 20 bar using GCMC simulations further ascertained that the –COOH group instituted the maximum increment for both CO2 and N2. Nevertheless, the surface excess and heats of adsorption for CO2 were remarkably higher than those for N2 across the functional groups investigated (Fig. 18b). Besides, the –COOH functionalization resulted in a notable improvement in the selectivity for CO2 over N2 (by almost 28%). From these studies, it can be concluded that site specific functionalization with –COOH has a prominent effect on the local gas adsorption characteristics and may be explored as a potential route to manipulate graphene sheets for high CO2 capacity and selectivity.

Computational efforts have further demonstrated that doping graphene with metal ions can also improve its efficiency of capturing CO2. Carrillo et al. examined the uptake of CO2 by a graphene layer with high titanium coverage at atmospheric pressure and 27 °C (see Fig. 19a), using DFT and molecular dynamics simulation.135 On the basis of their calculations, Carrillo et al. proposed a plausible mechanism of CO2 adsorption in the titanium–graphene (C2Ti) system. The CO2 molecule is linear, positively charged at the C atom and negatively charged at the O atoms. When it is brought near the C2Ti surface, the positively charged Ti atoms exert a strong attraction for the negatively charged O atoms. Obviously, this electrostatic force is stronger than the repulsion force on the C atom by the Ti atoms. As the CO2 molecule gradually moves closer toward C2Ti, the O atoms being under different force fields bend the CO2 molecule. One of the O atoms traps electronic charges from the Ti atoms of the upper plane and ends up bonding to four Ti atoms, thereby dissociating CO2 into CO and O. The CO fraction is then adsorbed on the C2Ti surface in a manner that the C atom is bonded to three Ti atoms while the O atom is bonded to another Ti atom, as illustrated in Fig. 19b. It is therefore likely that inclusion of monodispersed Ti atoms onto the graphene surface will significantly increase its CO2 capture performance. Likewise, Cazorla et al.136 conducted a systematic simulation-based research to assess the CCS potential of Ca-doped graphene. CO2 molecules were observed to bind very weakly to pristine graphene and preferred to accommodate on top of subjacent C–C bonds (Fig. 20a). In contrast, the interaction of CO2 with Ca-doped graphene was relatively strong and the strength of the binding could be efficiently tuned by altering the metal dopant concentration. Intense molecular binding accompanied by large electronic charge transfer was noticed at low dopant concentrations (Fig. 20b) whereas in the case of high dopant concentrations, CO2 molecules were physisorbed on the graphene surface (Fig. 20c). This implies that densely doped graphene would be ideal for low-temperature/low-pressure CCS application (e.g., post-combustion capture) whereas sparsely doped graphene would be promising for high-temperature/high-pressure CCS practice (e.g., pre-combustion capture). The CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity was also inspected with the finding that N2 binds to the Ca-doped surface more weakly than CO2. Thus, Ca-doped graphene may be potentially applicable to carbon capture processes. By using first-principles calculations, doping of GO with light metals (Li, Al) has also been recently proposed as an attractive approach for highly efficient CO2 capture from flue gas streams.137

Another useful strategy for improving the CO2 uptake potential of graphene is the incorporation of other carbon-based materials, such as fullerenes, into graphene sheets. Using GCMC simulations, Terzyk et al. showed that the CO2 adsorption capacity of fullerene intercalated graphene nano-containers was amplified by increasing fullerene concentration of the composite system.138 Terzyk et al. also observed that pores with an effective diameter of ca. 0.5 nm were competent for CO2 removal at low pressures due to energetically favorable surface interactions. Conversely, larger slit pores (diameters in the range 1–2.4 nm) were found appropriate for CO2 capture under high pressure conditions owing to multilayer molecular adsorption.
Recently, the modification of GO layers through intercalation has been studied as a powerful alternative to develop new adsorbents with tailored properties for CO2 capture applications. For example, Garberoglio et al. theoretically created a three-dimensional (3D) GO framework (GOF) pillared by organic linkers using DFT based atomistic simulations as shown in Fig. 21.139 GCMC simulations were then implemented at −78 °C for gas pressures up to 1 bar to predict the CO2 adsorption properties of the developed framework. Their simulation results suggested that the rate of CO2 uptake was a function of the density of pillars and the specific chemical moiety used as a spacer. Moreover, the constructed 3D framework also displayed a high CO2/H2 selectivity at 25 °C and pressures below ∼0.5 bar. Garberoglio et al. attributed this observation to the thermodynamically favorable interaction of CO2 with GOF at low pressures.

It is well acknowledged that the considerable volume of combustion water in flue gas is a serious impediment to adsorption-based CO2 capture. Water can have negative impacts on an adsorbent's CO2 selectivity and also on capacity, owing to its competition with CO2 for the adsorption sites. Computational attempts focusing on the influence of water on the CO2 adsorption strength of graphene materials have therefore also begun to emerge. Yumura and Yamasaki employed DFT calculations to understand the role of water molecules in trapping CO2 inside the interlayer space of GO.140 A detailed analysis of the simulation data revealed that CO2 interacts repulsively with anhydrous GO layers to increase the interlayer spacing, which is reduced in the presence of water molecules because of the occurrence of attractive water–layer interactions through hydrogen bonding. The DFT calculations further indicated that the GO interlayer spacing, which is affected by the intercalation of water molecules, controls CO2 migration within the GO layers. When the GO interlayer distance is less due to the existence of intercalated water molecules, the fairly strong repulsive interactions between CO2 and GO avert the migration of CO2 from its original binding position. Such repulsive interactions do not arise during the migration of CO2 within anhydrous GO structures owing to the relatively longer interlayer distance. Accordingly, migration of CO2 within anhydrous GO involves much lower energy barriers, implying that CO2 molecules are easily released from the GO layers. These findings are undoubtedly useful for the development of next-generation graphene-based adsorbents exhibiting improved moisture resistance for post-combustion capture.
Overall, there has been a significant amount of research resorting to different molecular simulation tools for elucidating the CO2 adsorption properties of graphene-based materials. In addition to providing quantitative information (such as CO2 uptake capacity, CO2/N2 selectivity, and heat of adsorption), computer simulations also present the unique opportunity to deduce the underlying CO2 uptake mechanism, which would otherwise require expensive and tedious experimental settings. Considering the vast array of possibilities available for engineering new graphene-based adsorbents, it would be both judicious and thoughtful to systematically screen graphene-based systems using molecular simulation methods in order to identify the most ideal candidates for CO2 capture applications. However, the combination of computational research with laboratory experiments is imperative to successfully realize the true potential of such promising graphene-based structures for reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants.
5. Outlook and future perspectives
Clearly, a broad range of graphene materials have been investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, to curb CO2 emissions from static sources of fossil fuel combustion. Based on the critical analysis of all findings discussed above, a consensus emerges that graphene and its derivatives possess the ability to capture CO2, specifically in terms of high storage, excellent selectivity, rapid uptake, easy regeneration, and good reproducibility and stability. Many of the graphene-based materials exhibit CO2 adsorption capacities comparable to or exceeding those of the best activated carbons, zeolites and MOFs. However, a number of technological limitations and practical challenges have to be tackled in order to produce next-generation graphene-based adsorbents with the capability of being applied on an industrial scale for efficient and effective CO2 separation from flue gases. To achieve this desired outcome, the following recommendations are made for further research (Fig. 22):
 Fig. 22  Key research priorities for further development of graphene-based CO2 adsorbents. 
(i) Measurement of CO2 uptake on volumetric basis
The adsorption capacity is undoubtedly one of the most critical parameters when evaluating a new material for CO2 capture applications. While the gravimetric capacity (i.e., the mass of gas adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent) estimates the amount of an adsorbent required to be packed in a continuously operating adsorption system, the volumetric capacity (i.e., the volume of gas adsorbed under standard conditions divided by the volume of adsorbent) has a significant impact on the volume of the adsorbent bed and hence the size of the CO2 recovery apparatus.141 Consequently, the volumetric uptake appears to be the most appropriate metric to quantify the CO2 adsorption capacity of any adsorbent. However, based on the literature reviewed, CO2 adsorption in graphene materials has been found to be commonly measured on a gravimetric basis with no data on volumetric uptake currently available. Therefore, the volumetric CO2 adsorption capacity should be determined and provided as part of laboratory-based investigations, which in turn would enable the prospects of applying these nanomaterials in an industrial setting to be more accurately evaluated.
(ii) Evaluation of working capacity
Another important metric for evaluating any adsorbent is the CO2 working capacity, determined by measuring the difference between the amounts of a gas adsorbed at adsorption and desorption pressures. From a practical viewpoint, a good working capacity is highly desirable since the quantity of an adsorbent needed to construct the adsorption column can be reduced considerably.30 This in turn lowers the initial capital costs as well as leads to long-term energy benefits for regeneration.30 Future research work in graphene-based CO2 adsorbents should also focus on calculating the maximum working capacity in order to ascertain their large scale deployment.
(iii) Measurement of multicomponent gas adsorption isotherms
Most of the adsorption experiments have been carried out with a single component system i.e., CO2 only with no other gases in the matrix that can potentially compete for the limited number of adsorption sites on the adsorbent. While single component isotherms provide precise information on the CO2 uptake capacity of an adsorbent, multicomponent isotherms are of greater importance for assessing the performance of an adsorbent under conditions expected to be encountered in an actual CO2 capture system.142 For example, with reactive gases (SO2, NOX, and CO) present in an industrial flue gas, complex interactions between CO2 and various flue gas constituents can occur at the adsorbent surface which can in turn affect its capture efficiency. To our knowledge, no direct measurements of such multicomponent isotherms in graphene materials are currently available in the literature. Even though some researchers have attempted to predict the multicomponent equilibrium from pure component isotherms (using IAST), such predictions are, however, not accurate enough for process development because of their intrinsic limitations.143 Future research must therefore address this issue if graphene or its derivatives are to be employed in a real-world CO2 capture system.
(iv) Determination of the influence of water vapor
When evaluating graphene-based materials for applications in a CO2 capture process, it is further important to consider the effect of moisture on the separation of CO2 since the flue gas usually contains significant volumes of water vapor which can in turn affect the adsorption process. While some attempts have been made to record the CO2 adsorption profile of graphene materials under humid conditions, most existing studies do not rigorously evaluate the performance of these materials upon repeated exposure to moisture. A better understanding of the influence of water vapor on carbon capture is therefore urgently needed, which would eventually assist in the rational design of more advanced graphene-based CO2 adsorbents that are water-repellent.
(v) 
          In situ characterization of adsorbed CO2

In situ characterization methods are of great importance for studying the relationship between the structural and chemical features of an adsorbent and its observed adsorption performance.144 Future research should therefore focus on crystallographic characterization of CO2-loaded graphene materials with in situ analytical techniques such as XRD, IR or NMR spectroscopy for direct observations of the location of CO2 molecules within the molecular structure of the adsorbents.‡ The outcome of this work would facilitate a fundamental understanding of the gas adsorption mechanism and thus contribute toward designing more advanced graphene-based CO2 adsorbents.
(vi) Development of molecular models and force fields mimicking realistic conditions
In parallel with experimental studies, molecular simulation methods must be further developed as a tool to predict the performance of graphene materials for CO2 separation. Currently, much of the simulation-based work has been performed under highly idealized conditions, and less attention has typically been given to provide a deep understanding of the CO2 uptake performance of graphene materials when exposed to operating environments similar to those encountered in industrial settings. Hence, developing molecular models and force fields based on actual flue gas conditions is a prerequisite for the successful screening and evaluation of new graphene-based CO2 adsorbents.
Beyond these considerations, the engineering economics of graphene materials must be evaluated upon scaling-up the materials for industrial applications, and economic models must be established to perform life cycle assessment in order to ascertain the feasibility of bulk preparations of the most promising graphene-based adsorbents.
6. Conclusion
The development of new adsorbents with high capacity and high selectivity for reducing energy-related CO2 emissions is a topic of utmost global importance because of its implications in climate change mitigation. Recent advances in materials science and engineering suggest that graphene, a wonder material with many attractive properties, can deliver viable solutions to the challenges of developing cost-effective, energy efficient and high-volume adsorption-based CO2 capture technologies. This review therefore integrated the recent research progress in the development of graphene and its derivatives as the next-generation of CO2 adsorbents. Indeed it is apparent from the existing literature that graphene's unique structure and highly interesting properties provide vast opportunities for designing and fabricating robust adsorbents that are truly well-suited to be deployed in an industrial setting. Both experimentation and molecular simulation studies demonstrate the immense potential of graphene-based materials for capturing and isolating CO2 from fossil fuel combustion-derived flue gas streams. In comparison to other competing adsorbents, a key advantage of these 2D material systems is that many different functional groups or heteroatoms can be attached to their surface, allowing custom-tailoring of surface properties without sacrificing the remarkable intrinsic characteristics of the graphene core. Nonetheless, this field of investigation is still at its early development stage. There are many research gaps and technical challenges that need immediate attention if the outcome of laboratory-based investigations on these promising nanostructures is to be translated into real-world CO2 capture applications. This inevitably calls for a broad interdisciplinary and integrated research initiative, which would in turn ultimately lead to a low-carbon future by reducing CO2 emissions from coal-burning power plants and other stationary sources.

High adsorption capacity	Reduces the mass of adsorbent required for a given throughput, lowers the volume of adsorbent bed and minimizes the related equipment size and cost
High selectivity	High selectivity for CO2 against other gases ensures that the CO2 component of the exhaust gas is completely removed for subsequent sequestration
Moderate heat of adsorption	Heats of adsorption at the borderline between strong physisorption and weak chemisorption provide a good trade-off between selectivity and regeneration
Fast kinetics	Decreases capital costs, energy requirements for operation and adsorption cycle times
Chemical/mechanical stability	High chemical stability under the conditions of capture and regeneration maximizes the adsorbent lifetime and reduce replacement rates to a minimum which has a direct impact on the overall economics of the CO2 capture process
Good mechanical stability allows the adsorbent to be pulverized into fine particles and densely packed for the maximum volumetric capacity. It also warrants that the adsorbent is capable of withstanding bulk handling that is a feature of any industrial unit

 	Fig. 10  Different modes of CO2 chemisorption at the surface of the TiO2/GO-0.10 composite adsorbent (labels 1 M or 2 M refer to the number of metal atoms involved in the adsorption). CO2 is an amphoteric molecule: the carbon atom is acidic while the oxygen atoms are weakly basic. When it is adsorbed as a base, the binding mode can involve one or two oxygen atoms of CO2 (monodentate or bidentate) and one or two Ti centers. As an acidic species, it can bind to the oxygen functionalities at the GO surface (O–C coordinated). Reprinted from Chowdhury et al.,105 Copyright 2014, with permission from Elsevier Ltd.

 	Fig. 17  (a), (b) and (c) represent the three initial configurations considered for the physisorption of CO2 on a defected graphene sheet. In the first configuration (a), the CO2 molecule has an initial height of 2.5 Å with its molecular axis parallel to the graphene surface. In the second configuration (b), CO2 is still parallel to the surface but rotated 30° with respect to the structure. In the third configuration (c), the molecule is perpendicularly oriented to the surface. The optimized physisorption state is shown in (d) while the chemisorption of CO2 as a lactone complex on the vacancy defect of the graphene layer is shown in (e).

 	Fig. 19  Adsorption of CO2 onto C2Ti system — represented by a hexagonal unit cell consisting of four Ti atoms and eight C atoms (a). When the linear CO2 molecule approaches the C2Ti surface, it first dissociates into CO and O. The CO fraction is then adsorbed on the surface in a manner that the C atom is bonded to three Ti atoms while the O atom is bonded to another Ti atom (b).
