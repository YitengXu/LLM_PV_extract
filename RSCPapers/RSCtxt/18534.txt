    , Accepted 2nd July 2014First published on 3rd July 2014AbstractElectrolyzers and fuel cells have been extensively investigated as promising solutions for renewable energy storage and conversion. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are important electrocatalytic processes in electrolyzers and fuel cells. Exploring efficient non-precious metal catalysts for HER and ORR in acidic medium remains a great challenge. Herein, we report that graphene-supported iron-based nanoparticles encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe@N–C) hybrid material acts as an efficient HER and ORR catalyst. The hybrid material was synthesized by pyrolysis of graphene oxide and ammonia ferric citrate followed by acid-leaching. During the pyrolysis, nitrogen was doped into a graphene lattice, and the carbon nanoshell grown on graphene effectively suppressed the stacking of graphene sheets, exposing more active sites to reactants. The hybrid material showed higher electrocatalytic activities than graphene sheets or Fe@N–C alone, which is probably attributed to the synergetic role of nitrogen-doped graphene and Fe@N–C towards the electrocatalytic reactions.
Introduction
Renewable electricity from solar and wind energy has drawn much attention in recent years due to the increasing scarcity of fossil fuels and environmental deterioration.1–3 A major challenge for renewable electricity is directly merging it into electricity grids because of its intermittent and localized nature. Therefore, it is essential to develop efficient energy storage and conversion technologies towards the rapid development of renewable electricity.4–6 Electrochemical technologies such as rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, electrolyzers and fuel cells have been extensively investigated as promising solutions.1,7,8 The combination of electrolyzers and fuel cells is a particularly interesting candidate. Hydrogen and oxygen are produced by water splitting in electrolyzers using renewable electricity, and then fed into the anode and cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) for generating electricity as portable and transportation power sources.4,9,10 Electrocatalysts are key materials in electrolyzers and PEMFCs for catalyzing hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions and oxygen evolution/reduction reactions. Developing low-cost, efficient electrocatalysts for the above reactions is one of the most important challenges in the research and development of electrolyzers and PEMFCs.11,12
Carbon materials are usually the essential component in electrocatalysts, acting as a support to disperse the metal or metal oxide nanoparticles.13,14 Graphene, a two-dimensional plane structure with a thickness of a single-layer carbon atom, has attracted great interest in the field of energy storage and conversion due to its high electronic conductivity, large surface area, and excellent chemical stability.15–17 In PEMFC, electrochemical corrosion of carbon materials as catalyst supports leads to aggregation of Pt-based nanoparticles, and thus decreases the electrochemical surface area and eventually the long-term durability of PEMFC.18,19 Traditional carbon supports widely used in PEMFC are carbon black (CB), carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber.20,21 Due to the above unique properties, graphene has been investigated as a promising supporting material in carbon-supported Pt-based electrocatalysts.22,23 Previous studies show that graphene-supported Pt-based electrocatalysts demonstrate enhanced catalytic activity.24–26 However, the surface area of graphene sheets will be decreased during the electrochemical cycling due to the stacking of graphene sheets resulting from van der Waals forces and π–π interactions.27,28 CB or CNT was often inserted between graphene sheets as nanospacers to suppress this stacking behavior.29,30 The graphene–CB and graphene–CNT hybrid support materials provide a three-dimensional (3D) porous architecture for the deposition of Pt-based nanoparticles, expanding the electrochemical three-phase interface and thus enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and durability.
Although Pt-based electrocatalysts have demonstrated high electrocatalytic activities, the high cost and limited resources hinder their wide application in electrocatalytic reactions such as oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction.31–33 Meanwhile, the Pt-based electrocatalysts are vulnerable to poisonous species such as SO2 and methanol, etc.31–33 Many efforts have been devoted to develop non-precious metal catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions. Heteroatom-doped carbon materials have been considered as a new class of electrocatalysts. Due to the intrinsic chemical inertness of graphene, nitrogen is usually doped into graphene lattice to tailor its electronic structure and possess the electrocatalytic activity.17,34,35 Various methods have been developed to synthesize nitrogen-doped graphene, such as thermal annealing of graphene or graphene oxide (GO) with NH3, chemical vapor deposition, nitrogen plasma treatment of graphene and arc discharge of graphite with pyridine/NH3.36,37 However, these approaches have some limitations, such as high cost, inability to scale up, etc. In addition, the stacking behavior of nitrogen-doped graphene is even more serious than that of graphene-supported Pt-based nanoparticles, and the accessible active sites in nitrogen-doped graphene are exposed limitedly. It has been shown that some non-noble metal oxide nanoparticles, such as Co3O4 and MnOx supported on graphene sheets, can suppress the stacking behavior,29,38 however, the majority of the metal oxide/graphene hybrid materials can only work in alkaline media because of the acid-leaching of metal oxide.
Iron-based nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe@N–C) have been synthesized using ammonia ferric citrate as a single-source molecular precursor in our group.39 The carbon phase with a hollow nanoshell structure is formed by pyrolysis and acid-leaching, which would be an ideal separator to suppress the stacking behavior of graphene sheets. Inspired by this, ammonia ferric citrate was mixed with GO uniformly and pyrolyzed in Ar atmosphere. The stacking of graphene sheets was effectively suppressed by growing hollow carbon nanoshell on the graphene surface, meanwhile, GO was doped with nitrogen and reduced to graphene by the decomposition species from ammonia ferric citrate during pyrolysis. The encapsulation structure prevents direct contact between the iron-based nanoparticles with oxygen and acidic medium. The graphene-supported Fe@N–C hybrid material demonstrates higher electrocatalytic activities towards hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions than Fe@N–C or graphene sheets alone.
Experimental
Materials synthesis
GO was prepared from natural graphite flakes using a modified Hummers method.40 The hybrid material was prepared by freeze-drying an aqueous dispersion of ammonia ferric citrate and GO, followed by pyrolysis in Ar atmosphere and acid-leaching. In a typical experiment, 15 g ammonium ferric citrate (C6H11FeNO7, J&K Chemical Ltd.) and 1.5 g GO were added to 300 mL of de-ionized water. After 10 min sonication, the stable suspension was freeze-dried. The mixture was placed in a quartz tube of a horizontal furnace and pyrolyzed in Ar atmosphere at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1 for 2 h at 600 °C. The product was leached in 0.5 M HClO4 solution at 80 °C for 10 h to remove unstable Fe species, and washed with de-ionized water thoroughly. Finally, the sample was dried at 60 °C in an oven, which is denoted as Fe@N–C/RGO. For comparison, ammonia ferric citrate and GO were prepared under the same conditions, which are denoted as Fe@N–C and RGO, respectively. Dicyandiamide was added into the precursor mixture as an additional nitrogen source, and the mixture was pyrolyzed at 700 °C, followed by acid-leaching, which is denoted as H–Fe@N–C/RGO.
Physicochemical characterizations
The morphologies of the samples were investigated by an FEI Tecnai G2 microscope at 120 kV, a JEM-2100 microscope at 200 kV and a QUANTA 200 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 20 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 200 mA at a scan rate of 5° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Thermo Scientific spectrometer with an Escalab 250 Xi X-ray as the excitation source. Thermogravimetry (TG) measurements were performed on a TGA-DSC analyzer (NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter®). Dry air provided by a pressured tank with a flow rate of 50 mL min−1 was used as the carrier gas. The experiments were carried out from room temperature to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption was carried out using a Quantachrome QUADRASORB SI system at 77 K, and specific surface areas of the samples were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a 150 mL three-electrode cell (AKCELL3, Pine Research Instrumentation) at 25 °C. A commercial glassy carbon (GC) electrode (AFE2M050 GC, 5 mm in diameter, 0.196 cm2, Pine Research Instrumentation) covered by the sample with Nafion ionomer as a binder and Pt-wire electrode (Pine Research Instrumentation) were used as the working electrode and counter electrode. Ag/AgCl and Hg/HgO electrodes (Shanghai Yueci Electronic Technology Co. Ltd.) were used as the reference electrode in acidic and alkaline electrolyte solutions, respectively. The rotation rate and the potential of the working electrode were controlled by a MSR Electrode Rotator (Pine Research Instrumentation) and an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 302N). The Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.5 M HClO4 and 0.1 M HClO4 solution, while the Hg/HgO reference electrode was calibrated vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH solution. All potential values in this paper are referred to compared with the RHE. Five mg of the catalyst was dispersed in a mixture of 2 mL ethanol and 50 μL Nafion solution (5 wt%, Aldrich) with ultrasonic stirring to form a homogenous ink. The catalyst layer was prepared by dropping 25 μL of the ink onto a GC disk electrode by a micropipette and dried at room temperature. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities of the catalysts were evaluated by rotating disc electrode (RDE) measurement in Ar-saturated 0.5 M HClO4 solution with a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities of the catalysts were also evaluated by RDE measurements in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution or 0.1 M KOH solution with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Current–voltage data was recorded at a rotation rate of 2500 rpm.
Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements of the samples in 0.1 M HClO4 solution were conducted on a glassy carbon disk (Ø 5.7 mm) with a polycrystalline Pt biased at 1.06 V. The following equations were used for calculation of H2O2 (η) formation yield and the electron transfer number (n) per oxygen molecule: (1) (2)where Ir and Id are ring and disk currents, respectively, and N is collection efficiency (0.38).
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the typical procedures to synthesize the Fe@N–C/RGO hybrid material. Firstly, GO and ammonia ferric citrate are mixed into an aqueous solution. The presence of many oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the GO sheets makes GO uniformly disperse in the ammonia ferric citrate aqueous solution. Subsequently, the mixture is freeze-dried and then pyrolyzed in Ar atmosphere. Then ammonia ferric citrate is decomposed to form Fe@N–C, meanwhile, GO is reduced to nitrogen-doped graphene sheet. After acid-leaching, incompletely encapsulated iron-based nanoparticles are removed and hollow carbon nanoshells are left behind between graphene sheets. Some entirely encapsulated iron-based nanoparticles are supported on the graphene sheet.
 Scheme 1  The schematic preparation procedures of Fe@N–C/RGO. 
SEM images in Fig. 1a and b display the obvious differences between RGO and Fe@N–C/RGO. Fig. 1a shows the very smooth surface of the typical graphene sheet. In sharp contrast, carbon nanoshells are uniformly decorated on the graphene sheet in Fe@N–C/RGO. The freeze-drying process can facilitate the uniform distribution of ammonia ferric citrate powder among GO sheets.41 During the pyrolysis, carbon nanoshells grow on the surface of graphene sheets. This hybrid structure is considered to be much more stable than graphene/CNT and graphene/CB hybrid structures produced by mechanical mixing. Thanks to the unique encapsulation structure, the iron-based nanoparticles are prevented from contact with oxygen, the electrolyte and contaminants, and remains stable in a wide pH range. Therefore, Fe@N–C/RGO hybrid material can be used as an electrocatalyst under harsh reaction conditions.
 Fig. 1  SEM and TEM images of RGO (a), (c) and Fe@N–C/RGO (b), (d)–(f). 
Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) images in Fig. 1c and d confirm the obvious differences between RGO and Fe@N–C/RGO. Fig. 1c illustrates typical stacked graphene sheets, while hollow carbon nanoshells in Fe@N–C/RGO are supported on graphene sheets with a much smaller size compared with that in Fe@N–C.39 The presence of GO separates the continuous distribution of ammonia ferric citrate, resulting in the formation of small carbon nanoshells on the graphene sheet during pyrolysis. Some nanoparticles are also observed to be entirely encapsulated within the carbon nanoshells. As shown in Fig. 1e, one nanoparticle with a size of about 15 nm is completely encased in a carbon nanoshell with 3–4 graphene layers. Some hollow graphitic pores with a size of ∼20 nm are also observed, which were generated by removing incompletely encapsulated iron-based nanoparticles during acid-leaching.
The present strategy for the synthesis of this unique Fe@N–C/graphene hybrid architecture has several advantages. Firstly, the preparation procedures are quite simple, consisting of freeze-drying, pyrolysis and acid-leaching using non-expensive equipment. Secondly, GO is reduced and doped with nitrogen uniformly by the decomposition of ammonia ferric citrate without the need of any other reductive or nitrogen-containing gas. Thirdly, the stacking of graphene sheets is suppressed effectively by the growth of carbon nanoshells on its surface, constructing an open 3D architecture, facilitating transport of reactants to active sites. Thus, this synthesis process exactly meets the requirements to scale up for mass production.

Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of Fe@N–C, RGO and Fe@N–C/RGO. The broad peaks at 26.1° and 43° are assigned to diffractions from the (002) and (10) planes of the hexagonal structure of graphite, indicative of a high graphitic structure in the three samples.42 The thickness of the graphitic domains (Lc) in different samples is calculated according to the Scherrer equation using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of (002).43 The calculated value of the thickness of graphitic domains (Lc) can be used to quantify the average thickness of the carbon nanoshells and graphene sheets. For Fe@N–C and RGO, the average thickness of the graphitic domains is 5.8 nm and 3.0 nm. It should be noted that the average value of Lc in Fe@N–C/RGO is only 1.5 nm, much smaller than those of Fe@N–C and RGO. This result indicates that pyrolysis of the mixture of GO and ammonia ferric citrate plays a synergistic role in suppressing the aggregation of graphene sheets and carbon nanoshells. The continuous distribution of GO and ammonia ferric citrate in the mixture is interrupted, and thus the thickness of graphitic domains is decreased. For Fe@N–C, the weak peaks at around 44.5° and 82.3° are assigned to Fe44 and the other strong peaks are assigned to Fe3C.38 In contrast, diffraction peaks associated with Fe and Fe3C are not observed for the hybrid material, probably due to overlapping with the diffraction peaks of graphene.

TG curves of different samples in air atmosphere are shown in Fig. 3. RGO has a 100% mass loss at the end of the TG experiment. In contrast, Fe@N–C and Fe@N–C/RGO have similar residual masses of about 8%. During the heating process, two types of oxidation reactions occurred.39 One is the oxidation of iron-based species to Fe2O3, and the other is the oxidation of carbon to CO2. CO2 is released from the samples, and the residual material after TG experiments in air atmosphere is Fe2O3. The complete mass loss of RGO suggests that it contains negligible metal or metal oxide, and the similar mass loss of Fe@N–C and Fe@N–C/RGO confirms that there are nearly identical contents of encapsulated iron species in both samples. The mass loss of RGO mainly occurs in the temperature range of 410 °C and 590 °C, while that of Fe@N–C occurs in a temperature range of 300 °C and 750 °C. The mass loss of RGO is very fast, indicating that RGO has a uniform composition distribution to activate oxygen in the air simultaneously and thus is oxidized to CO2 in a narrow temperature window. Although Fe@N–C has a higher graphitization extent than RGO considering its high value of Lc, the onset oxidation temperature of Fe@N–C is much lower than that of RGO, suggesting the encapsulation structure of Fe@N–C can activate oxygen favorably. The mass loss at high oxidation temperature is probably ascribed to the oxidation of hollow carbon nanoshells without encapsulated iron-based nanoparticles. Interestingly, Fe@N–C/RGO hybrid material shows the lowest onset oxidation temperature and a narrow temperature range of carbon oxidation, suggesting improved oxygen-activating ability compared with RGO and Fe@N–C.

The total nitrogen content in Fe@N–C/RGO is found to be 4.2 wt% by XPS, much higher than that in Fe@N–C (1.8 wt%). During the pyrolysis, ammonia ferric citrate was decomposed and the nitrogen species was conveniently doped into the graphene due to an intimate contact between GO and ammonia ferric citrate in the mixture after freeze-drying. Therefore, the doped nitrogen content in Fe@N–C/RGO is greatly improved. The high resolution N 1s peaks in the XPS spectra are fitted into four components originating from pyridinic N (398.5 ± 0.2 eV), pyrrolic N (400.5 ± 0.2 eV), graphitic N (401.4 ± 0.2 eV), and oxidized N (402.6 ± 0.2 eV),39 as shown in Fig. 4. The percentage of different nitrogen species is listed in Table 1, compared with Fe@N–C, the proportion of nitrogen species in Fe@N–C/RGO is different especially for the oxidized N. Both pyridinic-N and graphitic-N are reported to be responsible for the electrocatalytic activity.45,46 The percentage of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N in Fe@N–C/RGO is 52.6% of the total nitrogen content, exceeding that of 44.7% in Fe@N–C, suggesting that a high content of nitrogen functional groups in Fe@N–C/RGO will contribute to the electrocatalytic activity.

The N2 adsorption–desorption curves of RGO and Fe@N–C/RGO belong to the isotherms of type IV (based on IUPAC classification) with a hysteresis loop, indicative of the existence of mesopores, as shown in Fig. 5. The specific surface area and pore volume of RGO are 302 m2 g−1 and 0.88 cm3 g−1, while those of Fe@N–C/RGO are 453 m2 g−1 and 0.80 cm3 g−1, respectively. Compared with RGO, the specific surface area of Fe@N–C/RGO is greatly improved, indicative of a more open structure. However, the pore volume of Fe@N–C/RGO is slightly decreased, probably because the majority of pore volume is contributed by the interspace of graphene sheets, and the carbon nanoshells supported on the graphene sheets decrease the interspace volume. The high specific surface area of Fe@N–C/RGO is expected to facilitate exposing more active sites to reactants with enhanced mass-transport properties during the electrocatalytic process.39

The electrocatalytic activities of RGO, Fe@N–C and Fe@N–C/RGO towards HER are evaluated in Ar-saturated 0.5 M HClO4 solution. As shown in Fig. 6a, RGO has a negligible current density, indicating that pure carbon material is almost inert to HER. Fe@N–C shows an inferior activity for HER. In contrast, Fe@N–C/RGO demonstrates a greatly improved HER activity. The Tafel plots are shown in Fig. 6b. The slopes were calculated to be 100 mV dec−1 for Fe@N–C/RGO, 232 mV dec−1 for Fe@N–C and 356 mV dec−1 for RGO. In acidic medium, HER is composed of two out of three microscopic steps (Tafel/Volmer or Heyrovsky/Volmer):47,48Volmer step: H+ + e− = HadHeyrovsky step: Had + H+ + e− = H2Tafel step: 2Had = H2
 Fig. 6  Linear sweep voltammetries (a), and Tafel slopes (b) of RGO, Fe@N–C and Fe@N–C/RGO for hydrogen evolution reactions in Ar-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 at 25 °C. 
The Tafel curve of Fe@N–C/RGO clearly demonstrates that the Volmer step is the rate-determining step. The Volmer reaction involves the adsorption of a proton and the transfer of an electron to form the adsorbed H species. The comparatively lower onset potential and smaller Tafel slope of Fe@N–C/RGO than those of Fe@N–C and RGO alone denote that the presence of more nitrogen species favors proton adsorption kinetics. For HER in acidic medium, Pt/C has demonstrated the best activity.49 Development of non-precious metal catalysts for HER has been one of the major challenges in renewable energy storage and conversion in recent years.50–52 Metal sulfide (such as MoS2, WS2, etc.), metal nitride (such as Ni–Mo–N) and metal phosphides (such as Ni2P) have demonstrated high HER activity in acidic medium.50–52 However, the durability of these catalysts is not satisfactory because the transition metal species are in direct contact with the acidic electrolyte solution and prone to dissolution. Carbon materials are very stable in acidic medium, but there are only a few reports on carbon materials for application in HER. Herein, Fe@N–C/RGO serves as a promising alternative for HER in acidic medium. Further functionalization of Fe@N–C/RGO hybrid material is essential to improve the HER activity.
The electrocatalytic activities of Fe@N–C, RGO and Fe@N–C/RGO towards ORR are also assessed in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution. Fig. 7a shows linear sweep voltammetries of different samples. RGO and Fe@N–C have similar ORR activities. In contrast, Fe@N–C/RGO displays an obvious positive shift on the onset potential at 0.7 V and high cathodic current density. The ORR activity on Fe@N–C/RGO is much higher than that of RGO or Fe@N–C alone, confirming a synergetic effect of nitrogen-doped graphene and Fe@N–C for catalyzing ORR. The ORR pathway is further confirmed by RRDE, which is fit to monitor the number of transferred electron and the formation of peroxide species (HO2−) (Fig. 7b). The measured n is between 3.7 and 3.9 in the potential range of −0.15 V–0.6 V, and the H2O2 yields between 14% and 6% within the same potential window.

Dicyandiamide has been used as a suitable nitrogen source to increase the content of doped nitrogen.53 We also incorporate dicyandiamide into the precursor mixture, which was then pyrolyzed and acid-leached, and the obtained material is denoted as H–Fe@N–C/RGO. Fig. 8 shows the TEM image of H–Fe@N–C/RGO. Compared with Fe@N–C, the density of encapsulated iron-based nanoparticles is obviously increased with the addition of dicyandiamide, and the graphene sheet can also be clearly observed, indicating that the encapsulated iron nanoparticles are supported on the graphene sheet. Several carbon encapsulated iron, iron–cobalt and iron carbide nanoparticles have been synthesized for catalyzing ORR in acidic medium.54,55 It is proposed that the electronic interaction between the inner iron-based nanoparticle and outer carbon nanoshell promotes oxygen adsorption and association on the surface of the carbon nanoshell.54,55 Therefore, high-density Fe@N–C would be expected to increase ORR activity. The ORR activities on H–Fe@N–C/RGO and Pt/C in acidic and alkaline mediums are shown in Fig. 9. The onset potential and half-wave potential (E1/2) are 0.89 V and 0.67 V in 0.1 M HClO4 solution, only slightly smaller than that of Pt/C catalyst. Interestingly, H–Fe@N–C/RGO shows even higher ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH solution. We have compared the ORR activities of the reported non-precious metal catalysts, as listed in Table 2. H–Fe@N–C/RGO shows high ORR activity both in acidic and alkaline mediums amongst the reported non-precious metal catalysts with encapsulation structure.38,44,54–57 In the alkaline medium, H–Fe@N–C/RGO exhibits an ORR activity similar to the high-performance cobalt oxide/nitrogen-doped carbon hybrid materials58,59 and a much higher ORR activity than metal-free nitrogen-doped graphene/CNT hybrid material.60 Therefore, H–Fe@N–C/RGO has shown high ORR activities in a wide pH range and promising applications in fuel cells.

Conclusions
A graphene-supported Fe@N–C hybrid material was obtained by pyrolysis of graphene oxide and ammonium ferric citrate in Ar atmosphere followed by acid-leaching. Hollow carbon nanoshells grown on graphene sheets by pyrolysis of ammonium ferric citrate suppressed the stacking of graphene sheet effectively, meanwhile, the decomposition species reduced the graphene oxide and doped nitrogen into the graphene lattice. The hybrid material showed higher electrocatalytic activities for HER and ORR in acidic medium than RGO or Fe@N–C alone, suggesting a synergistic role of nitrogen-doped graphene and Fe@N–C towards the electrocatalytic reactions. By incorporating dicyandiamide to the precursor mixture, the hybrid material exhibited high ORR activities both in acidic and alkaline mediums, which is amongst the best reported non-precious metal catalysts.
