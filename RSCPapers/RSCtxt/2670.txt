    , Accepted 19th March 2020First published on 20th March 2020AbstractImproving the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is a big challenge for gaining highly efficient nonfullerene all-small-molecule organic solar cells (NFASM-OSCs). Herein, a novel small molecular donor, BT-2F which is derived from previously reported BTEC-2F, was designed and synthesized. The shortened alkyl-chains with higher regularity endow BT-2F with more ordered packing arrangement and more compact lamellar stacking as evidenced by the characterization of differential scanning calorimetry and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. By blending BT-2F with Y6 or N3, BT-2F based devices showed impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 13.80% and 14.09% respectively, much higher than the reported PCE of 13.34% for BTEC-2F:Y6. Besides, the efficiency of 14.09% is also among the highest PCE values reported so far for NFASM-OSCs. The distinctly improved Jsc resulted in enhanced PCE values, meanwhile both BT-2F:Y6 and BT-2F:N3 still maintain high fill factors of over 70%, which are ascribed to the good balance between high crystallinity and appropriate phase separation.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), serving as a new type of sustainable photovoltaic application, have witnessed great progress in recent years.1–8 Compared to strict preparation conditions and rigid substrates in conventional silicon-based solar cells, OSCs have numerous intrinsic advantages like low cost, flexibility, solution –processability, easy fabrication etc.9–12 To date binary OSCs can achieve a PCE of over 16% (ref. 13 and 14) and ternary OSCs have also obtained an efficiency of over 17%,15 which are mainly ascribed to the rapid progress of nonfullerene acceptors,16–18 especially the recently developed Y6 derivatives13,14,19 based on the electron-deficient core. In order to achieve a higher PCE, the nonfullerene acceptor has played an irreplaceable role owing to its wide infrared absorption and high electron mobility.20,21 Accordingly, highly efficient OSC systems can be simply divided into two branches based on the composition of the active layer: polymer organic solar cells (PSCs) which comprise polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors, and nonfullerene all-small-molecule organic solar cells (NFASM-OSCs) which consist of small molecular donors and nonfullerene acceptors. Though PSCs have exhibited great potential in achieving high PCE performance, they still exhibit intrinsic disadvantages of multiple molecular weight distribution and batch-to-batch variation which are critically important for large-scale fabrication.22,23 By contrast, NFASM-OSCs have attracted a growing amount of attention in recent years due to their definite chemical structure, mono-distribution, easy synthesis and good reproducibility.24,25 Nevertheless, the PCE performance of NFASM-OSCs still lags behind that of the PSCs owing to their unsuitable nanoscale interpenetrating morphology, which thus results in a low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) in NFASM-OSC fields.26–28
Modulating the phase-separated morphology by means of rational molecular design is always a straightforward and effective method to pursue higher Jsc and FF values. Lu group29 developed a novel small molecular donor BTR-Cl through a chlorination strategy and the corresponding PCE value was distinctly improved to 13.61% as compared to the 10.67% of the nonchlorinated BTR based device. Wei group30 also reported a PCE of over 14% by incorporating a large coplanar core of DTBDT into the small molecular donor. The distinctly improved Jsc should be the main reason behind the reported high-efficiency NFASM-OSCs, whereas their limited FFs become another shortcoming for the PCE performance. Recently, our group31 found that di-fluorination on the side groups of benzodithiophene (BDT) can effectively improve the voltage, induce compact molecular stacking, reduce molecular crystallization, and enhance the nanoscale phase separation. As a result, the device performance was distinctly improved from 10.64% to 13.34% with an impressive FF of 72.35%, demonstrating great potential to achieve highly efficient NFASM-OSCs for difluorinated alkylthiophene-substituted BDT (BDTT-2F) based small molecular donors.
Nevertheless, NFASM-OSCs still face big challenges to pursue higher Jsc values. Though the recently reported Y6-based NFASM-OSCs have achieved excellent progress, their Jsc lags far behind the Jsc value of 25.7 mA cm−2 provided by the PM6:Y6 system,19 despite the similar absorption wavelength range in both the PM6:Y6 polymer system and in the SM:Y6 NFASM-OSC system. In order to achieve higher Jsc values in NFAMS-OSCs, the following characteristics should be carefully considered. First, small molecular donors should be well ordered to guarantee an efficient carrier transport on the basis of appropriate nanoscale phase separation. Second, small molecular donors can compactly stack not only in π–π stacking but also in lamellar stacking so as to accelerate exciton diffusion and hole transport and thus reduce Jsc loss. However, to meet these requirements simultaneously, more efforts are required on materials synthesis and device optimization as there is always difficulty in maintaining a balance between high crystallinity and the appropriate domain size.
In this work, a novel small molecular donor named BT-2F (2-ethylhexyl(E)-2-cyano-3-(5′′-(6-(5′′-((E)-2-cyano-3-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)-3,4′-dihexyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophen]-5-yl)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4-difluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-3′′-hexyl-3′-pentyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophen]-5-yl)acrylate) is designed and synthesized according to our previously reported BTEC-2F, as depicted in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, the common device structure was fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties. When blended with the nonfullerene acceptor Y6, the as-cast devices based on BT-2F:Y6 showed a distinctly improved PCE (power conversion efficiency) of 8.94% as compared to the as-cast PCE of 6.69% for BTEC-2F:Y6, which is quite impressive for the as-cast devices in NFASM-OSCs. After TA (thermal annealing), a PCE value of 13.80% was obtained for BT-2F:Y6 based devices, much higher than the PCE of 13.34% for BTEC-2F:Y6 based devices, which is mainly attributed to the improved Jsc from 21.55 to 22.38 mA cm−2. The PCE of the BT-2F-based device was further improved to 14.09% when using N3 as the acceptor. Characterization results revealed that BT-2F has more ordered packing arrangement and more compact lamellar stacking, meanwhile BT-2F based blend films still maintain a good interpenetrating network morphology, which explains their improved Jsc and high FF of over 70%.

Results and discussion
BT-2F can be prepared by a two-step reaction of Stille-coupling and Knoevenagel condensation, and the detailed synthetic process is shown in the ESI.† Compared to BTEC-2F, BT-2F shows completely the same backbone but with a slight difference in side alkyl-chains on the terthiophene π-bridge. Though the terthiophene π-bridge in BTEC-2F has the easier synthetic route, the symmetrical structure of the alkyl chains attached to the π-bridge is not beneficial for the ordered arrangement among the molecules. By contrast, for BT-2F, alkyl chains attached to the thiophene π-bridge are arranged in a more regular manner, which is conducive to the interdigitation of the alkyl chains thus benefiting ordered arrangement.4,32 In addition, the alkyl chain is also shortened from octane to hexane for the formation of compact lateral molecular stacking.33
Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level was applied to evaluate the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels. Fig. S1† shows the HOMO and LUMO distribution of BT-2F. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of BT-2F were calculated to be −5.123/−2.861 eV, slightly lower than −5.116/−2.855 eV (ref. 31) of BTEC-2F. Fig. S2† shows the images of the side view and top view of BT-2F. BT-2F shows good planarity and dihedral similar to BTEC-2F (55.59° for BT-2F and 55.71° for BTEC-2F), which is considered to benefit hole transport. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was then performed to calculate its energy levels, and the corresponding CV curves are depicted in Fig. S3.† HOMO/LUMO energy levels can be obtained from the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −(φox/red − φFc/Fc+ + 4.8) eV, where φox/red is the onset oxidation/reduction potential and φFc/Fc+ is the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ relative to Ag/Ag+. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of BT-2F were calculated to be −5.40/−3.40 eV (bandgap 2.0 eV), slightly lower than −5.39/−3.38 eV (bandgap 2.01 eV) of BTEC-2F and are consistent with DFT simulations. The energy level diagram of all materials used in devices is shown in Fig. 2b.

Fig. 2c shows the normalized absorption spectra of thin films for BTEC-2F, BT-2F and Y6. BTEC-2F and BT-2F demonstrate a comparable absorption peak at 561 and 554 nm, however, it could be noted that BT-2F exhibits a slightly enhanced shoulder peak, indicating their increased propensity of molecular aggregation.34 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was also applied to investigate the properties of molecular aggregation and crystallinity, as shown in Fig. 2d. Two weak DSC peaks, an endothermic peak with an enthalpy of 15.71 J g−1 at 246.4° and an exothermic peak with an enthalpy of 15.57 J g−1 at 210.6°, were recorded for BTEC-2F, indicating its low crystallinity and weak aggregation propensity.31,35 By contrast, BT-2F presents a distinctly increased endothermic/exothermic enthalpy of 32.77/25.95 J g−1 (located at 206.1/152.8 °C), demonstrating its enhanced crystallinity and propensity of molecular aggregation, which is consistent with the results of absorption analysis. Fig. 2f depicts the photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the neat and blend films excited at 560 nm. A red-shifted emission peak of 687 nm was recorded for the neat film of BT-2F as compared to 655 nm for BTEC-2F, assigned to the slightly narrower bandgap of BT-2F. The emission peaks were dramatically decreased when the donors were blended with the acceptor Y6, demonstrating efficient charge transfer between donors and the acceptor.36
The devices with the common structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethyl-enedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate))/active layer/PDINO (perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide)/Al were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties, as shown in Fig. 2a. The detailed fabrication process is depicted in the ESI†. Table 1 displays the PCE values of as-cast devices and annealed devices and the corresponding J–V curves are depicted in Fig. 3a. Without any post treatment, BT-2F based devices exhibited a distinctly improved PCE of 8.94% which is also the highest PCE value for as-cast conditions in NFASM-OSCs, much higher than 6.69% of BTEC-2F based devices. Though BT-2F:Y6 showed a decreased Voc of 0.874 V, the improved Jsc of 17.08 mA cm−2 and FF of 59.85% are the reasons behind its increased PCE value. Since the molecular arrangement is closely related to the device Voc, more compact (discussed later) and ordered molecular stacking may explain its decreased Voc in as-cast BT-2F:Y6.24 After thermal annealing with 100 °C, the PCE performance was improved to 13.80% owing to the increased Jsc of 22.38 mA cm−2 and the almost same Voc and FF as BTEC-2F:Y6, much higher than the previously reported 13.34% for BTEC-2F:Y6.

 Fig. 3  (a) J–V curves of the as-cast and annealed devices for BT-2F:Y6. (b) External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves. 
External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are demonstrated in Fig. 3b. The integral current densities obtained from the EQE curves for as-cast/annealed devices of BT-2F:Y6 are 16.56/21.22 mA cm−2, which are consistent with Jsc values measured for the devices (within 5% errors). Fig. 3b also shows the comparison of the difference of the EQE profiles of BTEC-2F:Y6 and BT-2F:Y6, and the integral current density of BTEC-2F:Y6 was measured to be 20.55 mA cm−2 in this work. As can be seen, BT-2F:Y6 shows a higher integral Jsc value as compared to BTEC-2F:Y6, whereas the main contribution can be ascribed to the enhanced EQE value from 450–660 nm, indicating improved hole extraction in the BT-2F:Y6 device,34,37 which can be well explained by the previously analyzed result of improved molecular ordering in BT-2F. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) was applied to evaluate the properties of carrier transport. The device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/MoO3/Ag was fabricated to measure hole mobility (μh), and the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al was applied to test electron mobility(μe), as shown in Fig. S4.† The μh/μe of BTEC-2F:Y6 was measured to be 3.30 ± 0.51/4.75 ± 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (the average value obtained from 10 devices). By contrast, BT-2F:Y6 shows a relatively high μh/μe of 3.93 ± 0.90/5.00 ± 0.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The improved hole mobility for BT-2F:Y6 can be assigned to the improved crystallinity of BT-2F, which explains its better photovoltaic performance.
To gain a better understanding of the better performance of BT-2F, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to investigate the surface morphology, as shown in Fig. 4. The roughness values for the two blend films of BTEC-2F:Y6 and BT-2F:Y6 were measured to be 2.78 and 3.78 nm, respectively, as shown in the height images in Fig. 4a and d. Compared to BTEC-2F:Y6, though BT-2F:Y6 exhibits an increased roughness value, we can observe that BT-2F:Y6 shows a relatively finer fibrous network morphology, as shown in Fig. 4e and f, indicating a decreased domain size in BT-2F:Y6, which explains the better performance of BT-2F:Y6. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was further employed to study the molecular stacking and orientation, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a and c depict the 2D images of the neat films of BTEC-2F and BT-2F, and the corresponding 1D plots are shown in Fig. 5e. As can be seen, all of them show a similar edge-on π–π stacking and ordered molecular arrangement as evidenced by the appearance of (100), (200), and (300) lamellar diffraction peaks. In the out-of-plane direction, the lamellar diffraction peaks of (100)/(200)/(300) for BTEC-2F were measured at 0.30/0.60/0.90 Å−1. According to the equation: d = 2π/q, the d-spacing distance of alkyl-chain stacking for BTEC-2F was calculated to be 2.09 nm. Owing to the shortened alkyl chains, BT-2F shows a tighter alkyl-chain packing distance of 1.96 nm, corresponding to the right-shifted lamellar diffraction peaks at 0.32/0.65/0.98 Å−1. The crystallite coherence lengths(CCLs) calculated from lamellar(100)/π–π stacking(010) diffraction for the neat BT-2F film are 18.50/2.73 nm, higher than 17.44/2.61 nm of BTEC-2F; in addition, more sharp diffraction peaks at (100)/(200)/(300) can also be observed for BT-2F. These results demonstrate that BT-2F has the higher crystallinity and more ordered molecular stacking,38,39 which is consistent with the DSC results. As a result, the tighter and more ordered molecular stacking are considered to be beneficial for carrier transport, which explains the increased Jsc of BT-2F:Y6. Fig. 5b and d demonstrate the 2D diffraction patterns of blend films for BTEC-2F:Y6 and BT-2F:Y6, and Fig. 5f shows their 1D profiles. Both the blend films show a predominant face-on orientation with the same π–π stacking diffraction peaks at 1.73 Å−1. However, we can find that BT-2F:Y6 shows weaker lamellar(100) and π–π stacking(010) diffraction intensities than BTEC-2F:Y6. Correspondingly, CCLs of lamellar and π–π stacking for BT-2F:Y6 (11.34/2.42 nm) are also smaller than those of BTEC-2F:Y6 (15.90/2.58 nm), indicating a decreased phase separation for BT-2F:Y6,4 which is also consistent with the AFM results.

As a result, BT-2F is demonstrated to be a good candidate to fabricate efficient NFASM-OSCs because of its ordered arrangement, tight molecular stacking and good hole mobility. Recently, N3 (as shown in Fig. 6a), which possesses a completely similar structure to Y6 except for subtle alterations in the alkyl chains, was demonstrated to have better performance in morphology modulation and electronic properties according to the results reported by the Yan15 and Yang40 groups. Herein, we have also fabricated NFASM-OSCs by mixing the BT-2F and N3. After thermal annealing at 100 °C, the device exhibited a PCE of 14.09%, with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 23.81 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.22%, and the PCE of 14.09% is also among the highest PCEs for NFASM-OSCs29–31,41–50 (Fig. 6d). The significantly improved Jsc can be used to explain its better PCE performance compared to BT-2F:Y6 based devices. Fig. 6b and c show the corresponding J–V curve and EQE profile. The integral current density obtained from EQE was measured to be 23.35 mA cm−2, also consistent with the measured Jsc value. AFM and TEM were applied to investigate the microstructure morphology, as show in Fig. S5.† Interestingly, when blended with N3, the roughness value of the BT-2F based film was dramatically decreased from 3.78 (BT-2F:Y6) to 1.10 nm (Fig. S5a†). The small roughness value of the BT-2F:N3 film reflects a smoother surface, which is conducive to better contact between the active layer and electron transport layer. In addition, as observed from the phase and TEM images (Fig. S5b and c†), the blend film of BT-2F:N3 presents a good bicontinuous interpenetrating network, which is closely related to its efficient PCE performance. Furthermore, GIWAXS characterization (Fig. S6†) revealed that the BT-2F:N3 has a smaller π–π stacking distance of 3.59 Å (π–π diffraction peak at 1.75 Å−1) as compared to 3.63 Å of BT-2F:Y6. It is generally considered that a smaller π–π stacking distance is beneficial for efficient carrier transport, which is also consistent with its very high Jsc value.

Conclusion
In summary, a novel small molecular donor BT-2F, derived from our previously reported BTEC-2F, was designed and synthesized. Characterization indicate that the BT-2F has more ordered molecular arrangement and more compact lamellar stacking benefiting from the shortened alkyl-chains with regular arrangement, which endows BT-2F with higher hole mobility, more efficient hole extraction and a better phase-separated morphology when blended with Y6-derivatives acceptors. As a result, BT-2F:Y6 and BT-2F:N3 exhibited PCEs of 13.80% and 14.09%, which are quite impressive in the field of NFASM-OSCs as both of them can achieve an FF of over 70%. In addition, the PCE of 14.09% is also among the highest PCEs reported so far. Our work demonstrates an effective designing strategy for further improving the performance of NFASM-OSCs through the rational modulation of alkyl-chains.
