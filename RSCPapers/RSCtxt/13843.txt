    , Accepted 6th July 2017First published on 10th July 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been widely recognized as highly luminescent materials for efficient light-emitting devices. Herein, we report a simple perovskite-based metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) device structure with green light emission. Electron tunnelling and subsequent recombination in the semiconductor–insulator interface region is confirmed as the working mechanism of the perovskite light-emitting devices.
Introduction
For the past few years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, where X = Cl, Br, or I) have been widely studied as promising materials for optoelectronic devices owing to their brilliant advantages such as low cost of raw materials, high absorption coefficients, tunable band gap in the whole visible region, long charge carrier diffusion lengths, and solution processability.1–12 Hybrid perovskites were first used as a sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.5 While within less than six years, the performance of perovskite solar cells improved rapidly, and the highest PCE has already reached 22.1% to date.6 It is very exciting that in addition to the outstanding photovoltaic performance, hybrid perovskites also show excellent light emitting properties such as low non-radiative recombination rates and high colour purity.7–12 A series of breakthroughs on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on hybrid perovskites have also been achieved recently.13–17 For example, Cho et al. reported a green-LED based on the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.57%,15 which is a significant leap compared to the first reported value of 0.76%.16 Recently, Xiao et al. invented a wonderful method to form perovskite films with self-assembled, nanometre-sized crystallites. The EQE values of LEDs based on these CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites have reached 9.3% and 10.4%, respectively.17
Almost all of the reported perovskite LEDs adopted the conventional PIN-based device structures, in which P, I, and N stand for the hole transporting layer, the active layer, and the electron transporting layer, respectively. In such structures, the devices work under a mechanism of carrier injection. Additional layers are usually necessary to improve the carrier injection efficiency,13 which makes the device structure more complicated and the interfacial control more difficult. In this regard, it is worth exploring simpler LED structures for perovskites. Here, we propose a simple perovskite LED based on a metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) structure. Such a structure has been widely adopted in various semiconductors to realize light-emitting devices including electroluminescence (EL) and random lasing.18–22 Due to the existence of the insulating layer, the MIS devices may avoid the leakage phenomenon even if there are some pinholes in the semiconductor layer. This is particularly important for perovskite devices because pinholes are usually present in the solution-processed perovskite films. Besides the simple device structure, this is another advantage of the MIS-LED compared with the traditional PIN structure.
In this work, we report the prototype CH3NH3PbBr3 MIS-LED devices using a thin Al2O3 film as the insulating layer, and realize green light emission from such devices. We also confirm that electron tunnelling through the insulating layer is the working mechanism of the MIS device. We believe that this kind of device owns the potential to achieve efficient electroluminescence with further optimization.
Experimental section
All the ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with acetone, deionized water, ethanol and oxygen plasma before subsequent experiments. The compact Al2O3 films with a thickness of ∼10 nm were grown as a transparent insulating layer between the ITO (on glass) and the perovskite film through two methods, namely, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). For the PLD growth of the Al2O3 film, a laser with a repeating frequency of 5 Hz and a single pulse energy of 294 mJ was used to irradiate on the alumina target materials. Meanwhile, the oxygen pressure and substrate temperature were kept at 6.7 Pa and 200 °C, respectively. In the case of ALD growth, high purity trimethylaluminium (TMA) and deionized water (H2O) were used as the Al and O sources, and argon was used as the carrier and purging gas. The substrate temperature was kept at 200 °C, and the growth rate is 0.8 Å per cycle. In detail, 5 seconds of precursor injection and 10 seconds of purging were applied in each cycle, with TMA injection first, followed by H2O. The CH3NH3PbBr3 films were produced on the Al2O3 insulating layers through a spin-coating method reported in detail elsewhere.23 Briefly, CH3NH3Br (MABr, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%, Alfa Aesar) at a 3:1 molar ratio to form the perovskite precursor solution. The precursor was filtered through a 0.22 μm PTFE filter head, and then spin-coated on the compact Al2O3 films at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds. Poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-(4,4′-(N-(4-butylphenyl)))] (TFB, 50 nm), molybdena (MoOX, 10 nm), and gold (Au, 150 nm) were deposited subsequently through thermal evaporation at rates of 2.0, 0.1, and 5.0 Å s−1, respectively, under high vacuum (<1 × 10−5 Pa).
Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed on a fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments FLS-920). A semiconductor laser diode (EPL-405) with a wavelength of 404.2 nm and a pulse width of 58.6 ps was used as the excitation source. The film morphology was studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi-S4800). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Dimension Edge) was used to measure the surface roughness of the Al2O3 layers. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were collected on a UV-3600 spectrometer in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). For the MIS-LED characterizations, we used a Keithley 2400 electrometer for electrical measurements and a fiber integration sphere (FOIS-1) coupled with a QE-6500 spectrometer for light-output measurements.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a describes a schematic of the MIS device structure of the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite LEDs. Fig. 1b shows the energy band diagram of our LEDs, which presents the work functions of the contacts, the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) of the semiconductor and the insulator, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the polymer. In this structure, ITO acts as a cathode and plays the role of a metal in the MIS structure. An Al2O3 film is used as a transparent insulating layer between the ITO cathode and the perovskite light-emitting layer. Au is used as the anode, and a MoOX layer is used to improve the hole injection. TFB is used as the hole transporting layer which leads the hole injection into the light-emitting layer efficiently. An SEM cross-section micrograph of the MIS device is shown in Fig. 1c. The thickness of TFB and the perovskite layer is ∼50 and 120 nm, respectively. The Al2O3 layer in the device was deposited via ALD, and is hard to be distinguished in the image due to the limited resolution of the SEM. Hence the thickness cannot be directly determined. However, we note that the relationship between the film thickness and the growth cycle in the ALD growth has been well documented. In our previous work,24 a transmission electron microscopy image of the ALD-Al2O3 layer grown at 200 °C showed a thickness in perfect agreement with that predicted by the growth cycles.

As mentioned above, the Al2O3 insulating layer is very important in the device, and what we want is an Al2O3 insulation layer with a compact and smooth surface in order to facilitate the preparation of a smooth and compact perovskite film and prevent the short circuit of the MIS device. We tried two methods for the preparation of the Al2O3 thin film, namely, the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) methods. For simplicity, we call the Al2O3 insulating layers obtained via PLD and ALD methods as PLD-Al2O3 and ALD-Al2O3 films, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology of both Al2O3 films probed by AFM. Both films are compact, and the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the ALD- and PLD-Al2O3 layers is 1.03 and 4.99 nm, respectively. The insulating layer prepared via ALD is obviously smoother.

After the completion of the Al2O3 insulation layer deposition, the CH3NH3PbBr3 precursor solutions were spin coated on the Al2O3 insulating layers, and the surface morphologies of CH3NH3PbBr3 films synthesized on different insulation layers are shown in Fig. 3a and b. Obviously, the crystallinity and covering-ratio of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film prepared on the ALD-Al2O3 insulating layer (Fig. 3b) are superior to that prepared on the PLD-Al2O3 film (Fig. 3a). What's more, it seems that the surface of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film on the ALD-Al2O3 film is smoother, which is beneficial for the fabrication of the MIS device. This may be related to the surface morphology and bonding of the Al2O3 film, because in our experiments it is difficult to get a compact and smooth film on the rough PLD-Al2O3 layer no matter how the experimental conditions are regulated. We note that the ALD growth uses water as the oxygen source and the growth temperature is relatively low, therefore there should be hydrogen-containing groups on the surface of the ALD-Al2O3 layer, which may affect the wetting properties of the precursors and the perovskite film. The PL spectra of both kinds of film are displayed in Fig. 3c. The emission from the CH3NH3PbBr3 film coated on the ALD-Al2O3 film is significantly stronger. Therefore, we adopt the ALD-Al2O3 film as the insulating layer in our MIS devices. According to our previous work,24 the ALD-Al2O3 film prepared at 200 °C is mainly amorphous with a few grains embedded in it. In order to confirm the insulation of the ALD-Al2O3 layer, a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) structure, namely ITO/Al2O3/Au, was fabricated. The current (I)–voltage (V) curves of this MIM device is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The very low current density confirms the good insulation of the ALD-Al2O3 film under the working voltage of our MIS device. From Fig. S1 (ESI†), one can find that the PLD-Al2O3 layer also shows good insulation, although it seems not suitable for the deposition of a compact and smooth perovskite film.

For light-emitting devices, the quality of the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite film is of vital importance, and this is directly related to the performance of our MIS devices. Therefore, a series of basic characterizations were conducted to test the film quality. Fig. 4a shows the room-temperature optical absorption and PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 thin film, which present the typical features reported for the solution-processed CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskites.25Fig. 4b shows the corresponding XRD pattern, indicating that the cubic phase is the only crystal structure as previously reported,26 and the linewidth of the diffraction peaks is very narrow. All these features suggest the high crystal quality of the film, in consistent with the SEM results.

The electrical and optical characterizations of our perovskite LEDs based on the MIS structure are shown in Fig. 5a–c. The EL spectrum of the MIS device is shown in Fig. 5a. The EL peak is consistent with the PL peak with a slightly broader linewidth, implying that the recombination zone is in the CH3NH3PbBr3 layer. Fig. 5b presents the current density (J)–voltage (V) and luminance (L)–voltage (V) curves which show that the device turns on under the bias voltage of ∼9–10 V. The high turn-on voltage results from the high potential barrier contributed by the large bandgap of the Al2O3 insulating layer. After the device is turned on, the J and L values increase rapidly. Fig. 5c shows the EL spectra of the MIS device under different bias voltages. We found that when the voltage bias value is increased from 9 to 13.5 V, the light emission gradually enhances and the lineshapes of EL spectra are almost unchanged. The external quantum efficiency (EQE)–voltage (V) curve of the MIS-LED is plotted in Fig. 5d, showing a peak EQE value of 0.081%. In addition, a MIS device was also fabricated using the CH3NH3PbBr3 layer with some pinholes. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the EQE value is 0.077%, only slightly lower than that of the best device. This result confirms that our MIS-LED structure can resist the leakage phenomenon even if there are some pinholes in the semiconductor layer. This is particularly important for perovskite devices because pinholes are usually present in solution-processed perovskite films.

In order to understand the working mechanism of the light-emitting device, we put forward a possible model which combines the band structure of our device and the observed EL spectra in Fig. 5. We describe this model in detail in Fig. 6. The status of the MIS device under thermal equilibrium when a bias voltage is not applied is shown in Fig. 5a according to Fig. 1b. When a negative bias is applied on the ITO, the surface band of the perovskite film near the Al2O3 insulating layer will bend upward and the Fermi level of the ITO moves upward. This results in the accumulation of electrons and holes on the ITO side and the perovskite side of the Al2O3 layer respectively, as shown in Fig. 6b. However, the recombination of electrons and holes is hindered due to the blocking of the insulating layer. With the increase of the bias voltage, the degree of surface band bending becomes larger, and the density of carriers accumulated becomes higher. When the bias exceeds a critical value, the probability of electrons tunnelling into the perovskite layer increases greatly and then the recombination of electrons and holes occurs in the interface region of the perovskite film and the Al2O3 layer, as shown in Fig. 6c. This results in the green light emission from our perovskite MIS devices.

The tunnelling model is supported by the results presented in Fig. 5c. As previously reported,27,28 in the limit of large applied bias within the Simmon's approximation, the dependence of the light emission intensity on the bias voltage can be written as (1)where I is the integrated intensity of the EL spectra, V is the applied bias, me is the electron effective mass, φ is the tunnel barrier height, and d is the barrier width. The relationship between the integrated intensity divided by V2 and V−1 is shown in Fig. 7, and we obtained a linear dependence under a semi-log plot of the data. The result agrees with that predicted by eqn (1), indicating that the carrier tunnelling model is indeed the working mechanism in our MIS-LEDs.

Although the EQE of our MIS-LEDs is still low when compared with the state-of-the-art value of the perovskite LEDs, it is commensurate with the first CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite LED based on the PIN structure whose EQE is ∼0.1%.16 Here, we emphasize that we demonstrate a conceptually new device structure for perovskite LEDs, and we believe that the EQE value can be substantially enhanced with further optimization other than the control over the pinhole in the perovskite films and thickness of the insulating layer which has been done in the present work. Such an optimization may include, for examples, the thickness of each layer, the morphological and crystalline quality of the films, and the interfacial engineering including the band offset and defects. We do not evade the limits of our device, mainly the higher turn-on voltage and the lower EQE value when compared with PIN-LEDs, which are inherited from the high potential barrier due to the large bandgap of the insulating layer in the MIS structure. However, the MIS structure offers a simple but effective choice for LEDs, and may even help to realize electrically driven lasing more easily, as demonstrated in other semiconductors.22,29,30
Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a new and simple light-emitting device structure for the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite, based on the MIS structure, in which a very thin Al2O3 film is used as the insulating layer. Practically, we explored the deposition methods of the Al2O3 insulating layer specially, and then fabricated the MIS devices on ALD-grown Al2O3, and conducted a series of characterizations about the light-emitting properties. The MIS-LED emits a green light with a turn-on voltage of ∼9–10 V, and the peak EQE value is ∼0.08%. Based on the voltage-dependent EL measurements, we confirmed the electron tunnelling into the perovskite through the Al2O3 insulating layer as the working mechanism of the light-emitting device. Our work demonstrates a new strategy towards perovskite light-emitting devices, which may shed new light on the optoelectronic devices based on this class of materials.
