    , Accepted 2nd January 2018First published on 2nd January 2018AbstractPhotocaging allows for precise spatiotemporal control over the release of biologically active compounds with light. Most photocaged molecules employ organic photolabile protecting groups; however, biologically active compounds often contain functionalities such as nitriles and aromatic heterocycles that cannot be caged with organic groups. Despite their prevalence, only a few studies have reported successful caging of nitriles and aromatic heterocycles. Recently, Ru(II)-based photocaging has emerged as a powerful method for the release of bioactive molecules containing these functional groups, in many cases providing high levels of spatial and temporal control over biological activity. This Feature Article discusses recent developments in applying Ru(II)-based photocaging towards biological problems. Our groups designed and synthesized Ru(II)-based platforms for the photoinduced delivery of cysteine protease and cytochrome P450 inhibitors in order to achieve selective control over enzyme inhibition. We also reported Ru(II) photocaging groups derived from higher-denticity ancillary ligands that possess photophysical and photochemical properties distinct from more traditional Ru(II)-based caging groups. In addition, for the first time, we are able to rapidly synthesize and screen Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes that elicit desired properties by solid-phase synthesis. Finally, our work also defined steric and orbital mixing effects that are important factors in controlling photoinduced ligand exchange.

1 Introduction
Photocaging is a highly attractive method for providing precise spatial and temporal control over biological activity.1–5 Since photocaging manipulates biological systems in a non-invasive manner,6 this method has been employed frequently in basic research. In addition, this technique is currently being explored as a new platform for many exciting applications in photoactivated drug delivery and photochemotherapy.7–11
Traditionally, photocaging has been applied to functional groups, such as carboxylic acids, alcohols and amines, found in bioactive molecules.12,13 While many organic-based photocaged compounds are commercially available, several disadvantages exist in their application. With a few notable exceptions,14–16 most photoremovable organic protecting groups require UV light for uncaging, which adversely causes uncontrollable photodamage to biological systems.17–19 Furthermore, functional groups, such as nitriles and aromatic heterocycles, which are important “warheads” that interact directly with thiolates and hemes in the active sites of protein targets,20–30 have not been protected by organic groups.
Transition metal fragments are attractive for caging applications, especially complexes that bind to functional groups that cannot be protected with organic compounds. Thus, metal coordination provides an orthogonal approach to photocaging bioactive molecules. Because transition metal complexes often exhibit strong charge transfer absorption in the visible range, and the bond between a metal and its ancillary ligand is almost always weaker than an organic σ-bond, metal-based photocaging allows for the facile release of bioactive molecules upon irradiation with low energy light.2,31–45 By manipulating ancillary ligands, one is able to tune the photochemistry for achieving drug release over a broad spectral range in the visible range to near infrared wavelengths.9,10 Metal-caged molecules can be selectively liberated with spatiotemporal control, making them promising chemical agents for biological research applications.2,5,46–49
In addition to basic research applications, metal-based photocaging is actively being applied towards novel light-activated therapeutics. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically validated method for achieving spatiotemporal control over cancer treatment by generating the toxic species 1O2 at the irradiated area.50–53 Although PDT is highly selective and can be localized to specific areas, it relies on the presence of molecular oxygen at the irradiated site.50,51 The fact that many tumors are hypoxic in nature limits the efficacy of this treatment, which makes it imperative to discover new agents that are not only oxygen-independent but capable of generating anticancer effects upon light irradiation.
Ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes have been successfully developed as photocages.8–10,46,49,54–56 The octahedral geometry of Ru(II) complexes has the ability to undergo excited state ligand dissociation, a feature that is generally not accessible in square planar Pt(II) complexes such as cisplatin.57 In general, Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes are thermally stable in aqueous solutions and able to absorb in the visible range. Due to the property of mimicking iron binding, some Ru(II) complexes accumulate at tumor cells, which is an attractive property for drug delivery.58–60 In many Ru(II)-based polypyridyl complexes, ligand dissociation is achieved through the thermal population of 3dd states from a triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) state after light absorption.55,57,61
Since Etchenique and coworkers first reported the development of the Ru(bpy)2 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) fragment for caging 4-aminopyridine (4-AP),9 Ru(II) photocaging groups have been applied towards a wide variety of bioactive molecules, including neurotransmitters, enzyme inhibitors and recently peptides (Fig. 1).8,9,46,62–74 Ru(bpy)2 is the most widely used fragment for photocaging these bioactive molecules, which the Etchenique group used to cage γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)46 and nicotine.62 In addition, the Turro group showed that both Ru(bpy)2 and Ru(tpy) (tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) groups can be used to cage 5-cyanouracil (5-CNU), a cytotoxic agent that inhibits pyrimidine catabolism in vivo.54,63 In order to reduce antibiotic resistance, Sadler and coworkers used Ru(bpy)2 to cage isoniazid (INH), an anti-tuberculosis compound that is selectively released upon light irradiation to inhibit mycobacterial infections.66 The Glazer group caged metyrapone, a potent CYP11B1 inhibitor, with Ru(bpy)2, where light triggers the release of metyrapone for effective CYP11B1 inhibition.68 Vázquez and coworkers also used Ru(bpy)2 to cage a histidine-containing tripeptide, Arg-Gly-His (RGH), for controlling Ni(II)-dependent nuclease activity in vitro.67 Apart from Ru(bpy)2, the Bonnet group photoreleased N-acetylmethionine and biotin bound to Ru(tpy)(bpy), where the caged thioethers form stronger bonds than Ru–Cl in aqueous solutions in the dark and can be cleaved upon light irradiation.36,65,75–77 Recently, they also caged a cytotoxic nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitor with Ru(tpy)(biq) (biq = 2,2′-biquinoline), which exhibits great photoactivated enzyme inhibition in hypoxic cancer cells.78 Finally, the Renfrew group used Ru(phen)2 (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) to photorelease econazole, demonstrating that the Ru(II)-caged complex not only selectively releases econazole ligands upon light irradiation but also exhibits strong luminescence for live cell imaging.64

In this Feature Article, we present recent developments from our groups on caging bioactive molecules with Ru(II) compounds. Major areas of interest include the caging of bioactive nitriles and heterocycles, as well as the development of Ru(II) caging groups derived from higher-denticity ligands. The later aim was considered to be an important and underexplored area ripe for investigation and development, because Ru(II) photocaging groups shown in Fig. 1 are all based on planar heteroaromatic ligands, with denticities of two or three. Collectively our studies confirm that Ru(II) photocaging is widely applicable towards bioactive enzyme inhibitors, and that Ru(II) complexes derived from higher-denticity ligands are attractive platforms for achieving selective drug release. In many cases our compounds are stable in the dark, non-toxic and can be used to achieve bioactive compound release in living cells.
2 Ru(II) caging nitriles
To date, bioactive molecules that contain nitrile warheads have not been protected by organic-based photocaging. However, the ability to undergo efficient photoinduced ligand exchange makes nitriles and nitrile-containing bioactive molecules suitable for metal-based photocaging.54,79 The Ru(bpy)2 fragment has been successfully employed in caging nitriles to form stable complexes such as [Ru(bpy)2(MeCN)2]2+ and [Ru(bpy)2(5-CNU)2]2+, where two equivalents of nitriles are coordinated to Ru(II) and released selectively upon light irradiation.54,79 Although nitriles are biologically robust and commonly found in many bioactive molecules,80,81 only a few studies have reported the photocaging of nitriles and nitrile-containing bioactive molecules through Ru(II) coordination.
2.1 The Ru(bpy)2 fragment as a photocaging group for cysteine protease inhibitors
Cysteine proteases play a critical role in cancer development.24–27 Inhibition of cysteine proteases prevents enzyme–substrate interactions and achieves anticancer effects, mainly by inhibiting invasion and metastasis.24,25 Nitrile-containing molecules represent a group of inhibitors that inactivate cysteine protease activity by reacting with the active site thiolate of this class of enzymes, where the nitrile serves at the “warhead” and forms a covalent bond with the target protein.20–23 For example, Odanacatib, a known nitrile-based inhibitor of cathepsin K that advanced to phase III clinical trial for the treatment of osteoporosis, binds to the active site of the target enzyme and reduces bone resorption.82,83 Because nitriles can be stably coordinated to Ru(II), we hypothesized that cysteine protease inhibition would only occur upon light irradiation. Therefore, in order to control cysteine protease inhibition spatially and temporally, we used Ru(II)-based protecting groups to cage known nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors (Fig. 2),21,84 with the caged inhibitors showing the ability to be released upon exposure to light.56,85
 Fig. 2  Structures of nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors. 
We developed a series of Ru(bpy)2-caged cysteine protease inhibitors with the general formula [Ru(bpy)2(L)2]2+, where L = Ac-Phe-NHCH2CN (4), Cbz-Leu-NHCH2CN (5) and Cbz-Leu-Ser(OBn)-CN (6) (Fig. 3). Each inhibitor contains an electrophilic nitrile group available to react with the active site thiolate of cysteine proteases for enzyme inhibition. Generally, their Ru(II)-caged complexes share some common photochemical properties: first, they are stable in the dark in aqueous solutions; second, they efficiently release the caged inhibitors upon irradiation with visible light, and in most cases both of the two equivalents of the caged inhibitors are released (Fig. 3); third, all caged complexes show significant enhancement of cysteine protease inhibition in the presence of light, and each of the light-activated complex exhibits greater potency on cysteine protease inhibition than inhibitor alone (Table 1); fourth, the quantum yields of the first ligand exchange process of the caged complexes are generally lower than that of [Ru(bpy)2(MeCN)2]2+ (Φ400 = 0.21),79 which may be due to the larger size and reduced aqueous solubility of the nitrile-based inhibitors relative to MeCN.56,85

Irradiation of [Ru(bpy)2(1)2]2+ (4) results in the ∼32-fold enhancement of the inhibition of cysteine protease papain compared to that in the dark. Control experiments performed with [Ru(bpy)2(MeCN)2]2+ on papain rule out the possibility of enzyme inhibition that may be caused by other photolysis products, which implies that it is the inhibitor 1 released upon light irradiation that leads to enzyme inhibition. The inhibition of purified human cathepsin B, L and K by 4 is also stronger in the presence of light (Table 1). Finally, inhibition on human cell lysates, DU145 and hBMSC cells, that exhibit significant cathepsin B activity86–88 further confirms that higher levels of cysteine protease inhibition is enhanced when light triggers the release of the caged inhibitors (Table 1).
Compounds 2 and 3 represent structural modifications of 1, and they also inhibit cysteine proteases, especially cathepsin K.21,84 In addition, both inhibitors are more potent than 1 for cathepsin K inhibition.84 Notably, the photochemical release of 2 in [Ru(bpy)2(2)2]2+ (5) is more efficient than that of 3 in [Ru(bpy)2(3)2]2+ (6) under similar conditions, which may be due to the smaller size and a better solubility of 2 compared to 3 in aqueous solutions. Inhibition of purified human cathepsin K by 5 and 6 presents a 35- and 88-fold enhancement upon light irradiation, respectively, similar to the observation in 4. Furthermore, because cathepsin K is a critical enzyme related to osteoporosis,21 inhibition of cathepsin K was evaluated in a cell-based assay, where murine BMM and BMM-derived osteoclast cells were treated with complex 5 under the dark and light conditions. Results show that no cathepsin K inhibition occurs in the dark, but the enzyme is effectively inactivated upon light irradiation (data are not shown). These results suggest that Ru(II)-based photocaging is applicable towards light-activated enzyme inhibition in cells.
2.2 The Ru(TPA) as a photocaging group for nitriles
To date, Ru(II) photocaging groups mostly focus on using bidentate or tridentate ancillary ligands, such as bpy, tpy and phen.8,46,54,64,65 Complexes derived from these planar heteroaromatic ligands are capable of covalently binding to DNA once vacant coordination sites are opened through ligand release.89,90 In addition, related ligands are also capable of undergoing DNA intercalation to cause cell death.91–93 Although such properties are ideal for applications in photoactivated cancer drug design, they are not desirable to be used as photochemical tools for controlling biological activity for basic research applications, where toxicity from the Ru(II) leaving groups is undesired. Notably, Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes that have ancillary ligands with denticity of four or above are still underdeveloped. Such ligands introduce geometrical constraint to metal centers, which in turn stabilize their coordination sphere. Since higher-denticity ancillary ligands can result in Ru(II) complexes with different photophysical and photochemical properties than lower-denticity ancillary ligands, we sought to explore Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes with tetradentate ancillary ligands.
Ru(TPA) is a class of photocaging groups based on the tertiary amine scaffold tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA).94 This non-planar tetradentate ligand increases the structural rigidity of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, which can aid in decreasing non-radiative relaxation to the ground state following absorption of a photon. Ru(TPA) as a photocaging group has only been investigated for the release of nitric oxide (NO).94 Since TPA has the high potential of derivatization, Ru(TPA) is attractive for the development of new metal-based photocaging groups.
In our initial work, we used Ru(TPA) as the photocaging group to cage two different nitriles, MeCN (7) and the nitrile-based cysteine cathepsin K inhibitor Cbz-Leu-NHCH2CN (8) (Fig. 4).95 We demonstrated that Ru(TPA), similar to Ru(bpy)2, is an effective photocaging group for nitriles, and that the enzyme inhibition of cathepsin K can be precisely controlled with light. Both complexes exhibit strong absorption in the UV range, consistent with their singlet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) bands occurring at λ < 400 nm. In addition, 7 and 8 are highly stable in the dark, with half-lives of >730 days in aqueous solutions. Since TPA coordinates to ruthenium by four nitrogen-donor atoms, two coordination sites are thus available for caging nitriles, where one nitrile is positioned cis to the basic amine nitrogen, and the other is in a trans disposition. UV irradiation selectively releases the cis nitrile, while the trans nitrile remains bound. The quantum yields (λirr = 350 nm) for the exchange of cis nitrile with solvent in 7 and 8 were determined to be 0.012(1) and 0.011(1) in H2O, respectively. These values are smaller than that of [Ru(bpy)2(MeCN)2]2+ (Φ400 = 0.21), a point that remains to be investigated.

Notably, complex [Ru(TPA)(2)2]2+ (8) also acts as a potent photoactivated inhibitor of cathepsin K and liberates the caged inhibitor upon light irradiation. The enzyme inhibition is enhanced by a factor of ∼89 upon exposure, which is nearly as potent as the free inhibitor 2 under similar experimental conditions (Table 2). In addition, the inhibition of cathepsin K is not observed when complex 7 is treated against the enzyme either under dark or light conditions, indicating that the complex and their photochemical byproducts do not contribute to cathepsin K inhibition. Taken together, these data support that Ru(TPA) is appropriate as a light-activated agent for caging nitriles.

2.3 Solid-phase synthesis of Ru(II)–MeCN caged complexes
Although Ru(TPA) functions as an effective photocaging platform for nitriles, UV light is still required for uncaging. In efforts to tune the spectral properties of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes into the visible range and optimize the photocaging properties of photocaging groups, we next developed a method to rapidly synthesize and screen Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes capable of selectively releasing nitriles with low-energy irradiation.96 A library of TPA derivatives were synthesized on polystyrene resin. Accordingly, Ru(II)–MeCN complexes were generated from these resin-bound ligands, followed by cleavage from the resin for photochemical analysis.96 This represents the first example of applying solid-phase synthesis to the discovery of new metal-based caging groups.
Ru(II)–MeCN complexes generated by solid phase display a wide range of spectral tuning and reactivity with visible light. All of the complexes absorb strongly in the UV range and the derivatives that possess the ancillary ligands DPAbpy (DPAbpy = N,N-bis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine-6-methanamine), TQA (TQA = tris(1-isoquinolylmethyl)amine) and N4Py (N4Py = 1,1-di(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine) (Fig. 5) also absorb in the visible range. Thus, these Ru(II)–MeCN derivatives were chosen for further evaluation of their photochemical properties in solution phase.
 Fig. 5  Structures of [Ru(L)(MeCN)n](PF6)2, where L = DPAbpy (9), n = 1; L = TQA (10), n = 2; and L = N4Py (11), n = 1. 
Our results indicate that although [Ru(DPAbpy)(MeCN)]2+ (9) absorbs strongly in the visible range, it does not undergo photoinduced ligand exchange upon irradiation with visible light, consistent with the observation in solid phase where no bathochromic shift for ligand substitution is observed upon irradiation with visible light. Complex [Ru(TQA)(MeCN)2]2+ (10), however, not only absorbs strongly in the visible range but also exhibits strong reactivity with visible light. Similar to [Ru(TPA)(MeCN)2]2+ (7), the cis MeCN in 10 is selectively released upon 400 nm irradiation with a quantum yield of 0.027(1) in H2O, a value that is >2-fold greater than that measured for 7 (Φ400 = 0.012(1)). An interesting phenomenon was observed for [Ru(N4Py)(MeCN)]2+ (11): a bathochromic shift of substitution of H2O for MeCN does not occur when the complexes derived from solid or solution phase were irradiated with visible light. Instead, based on the photolysis monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, one of the coordinated pyridyl substituents of the N4Py ligand undergoes dissociation with H2O trapping the vacant coordination site. To conclude, these data indicate that the photochemical behavior of the Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes synthesized through solution phase are in good agreement with those generated by solid phase, validating that solid-phase synthesis is applicable towards the rapid preparation and identification of Ru(II) photocaging groups for nitriles. However, spectral tuning to achieve absorption in the visible range does not guarantee the photorelease of the caged nitriles. Therefore, further investigation was required to obtain a clearer understanding of factors that control photoinduced ligand exchange in Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes.
2.4 Orbital mixing enhances photoinduced ligand exchange
Generally, in order to achieve photoinduced ligand exchange, the complex must absorb in the desired wavelength of the light source. Once the Ru(II) polypyridyl complex absorbs a photon, the complex is excited to a 1MLCT state, which intersystem crosses to a 3MLCT state with ∼100% efficiency. At this stage, it is generally believed that the thermal population of a 3dd, metal-centered (3MC) state, through internal conversion accomplishes ligand dissociation.57 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed in collaboration with the Schlegel group helped to explain the reasons for differences in the photoreactivity of several Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes.61 By computing the energies and geometries of the 3MLCT states and the corresponding dissociative 3MC states, they concluded that orbital mixing is essential for efficient photoinduced ligand exchange, where the octahedral geometry of the Ru(II) complex is distorted to achieve favorable orbital overlap for efficient ligand dissociation.61 This accounts for the efficient photorelease of the cis MeCN in 10: since the bond between the N of the cis MeCN and the ruthenium is perpendicular to the two isoquinolyl rings of TQA, efficient mixing between the π* orbitals of the two isoquinolyl rings of TQA and the Ru–N (cis MeCN) dσ* orbital occurs. In contrast, orbital mixing is not possible between the trans MeCN and TQA, so the trans MeCN is not photolabile. Similarly, the only MeCN in [Ru(DPAbpy)(MeCN)]2+ (9) is coplanar with the bpy moiety of DPAbpy, making the Ru-N(dσ*) orbital and π* orbital of bpy orthogonal. Such an orbital orientation disfavors photodissociation since a large energy barrier is likely required in order to achieve a favorable geometry to induce ligand dissociation. Therefore, in these complexes, photoinduced ligand exchange occurs most favorably when orbital mixing in photoexcited states is geometrically allowed.
2.5 Influence of steric effects on photoinduced ligand exchange
In addition to orbital mixing, steric effects also play an important role in the photochemical reactivity of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes.49,70,97 In order to evaluate steric effects on the photodissociation of nitriles from Ru(TPA), methyl groups were introduced consecutively to the 6-position of pyridine donors of TPA, resulting in three new complexes with the general formula [Ru(L)(MeCN)2]2+, where L = MeTPA (12), Me2TPA (13) and Me3TPA (14) (Fig. 6).98 Complex 14 is isolated as a single isomer while complexes 12 and 13 are obtained as 2:1 and 1.5:1 mixtures of stereoisomers, respectively. All three complexes are less stable than [Ru(TPA)(MeCN)2]2+ (7), implying that the steric crowding introduced by the methyl groups enhances the dissociation of the caged MeCN ligands. Photochemical studies carried out in CH2Cl2 with 10 mM Bu4NCl show that complex 12 is stable for over 1 h in the dark, and the cis MeCN in 12 is released with a similar efficiency as that of the cis MeCN in [Ru(TPA)(MeCN)2]2+ (7). However, the trans MeCN in 12 is more labile than the trans MeCN in 7, suggesting that the methyl group increases the photoliability of the trans MeCN in 12. Interestingly, complexes 13 and 14 undergo ligand exchange in the absence of light, which illustrates that a delicate balance exists between the addition of some vs. too much steric bulk to facilitate photochemical nitrile release, since the latter accelerates undesirable thermal ligand exchange in the dark.
 Fig. 6  (A) Structures of MeTPA, Me2TPA and Me3TPA. (B) Model of [Ru(L)(MeCN)2]2+, where L = MeTPA (12), Me2TPA (13) or Me3TPA (14), showing MeCN groups cis and trans to the basic nitrogen donor that undergo selective thermal or photochemical release. 
In order to gain insight into the relationship between the geometric structures of methyl-substituted Ru(TPA) complexes and their thermal and photochemical properties, DFT calculations were performed to investigate the behavior of these complexes. These calculations were used to gain insight into the thermal reactivity from their ground states and the energy barriers required for photochemical ligand dissociation from the excited states of these complexes.98 Relaxed potential energy scans revealed that the estimated energy barrier for the trans MeCN to dissociate in 14 (12 kcal mol−1) is roughly half of that for the cis MeCN. This energy barrier is also nearly half of that required for the dissociation of MeCNs in 7 (20–21 kcal mol−1). The sterically encumbered geometry of 14 accelerates the thermal release of the trans MeCN, which then relieves the steric repulsion between the two caged MeCN ligands. Similar steric effects were also observed for complexes 12 and 13 (data are not shown). Taken together, the addition of methyl groups at the axial pyridine of TPA distorts the trans MeCN and facilitates its release under thermal conditions and confirms that photoinduced ligand exchange is significantly influenced by steric bulk.
3 Ru(II) caging aromatic heterocycles
Nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles are common functional groups found in many bioactive molecules.99 In order to achieve effective spatiotemporal control over their release, coordination metal complexes can be used to protect these aromatic heterocycles.19,64,66,67,70 Ru(bpy)2 is a common photocaging group used for caging aromatic heterocycles, such as 4-AP, nicotine and histidine-containing peptides; however, owing to their stronger metal coordination, the quantum yield for pyridine release is generally significantly lower than that for nitriles.9,62,67 In addition, other Ru(II)-based photocages have also been developed for the release of aromatic heterocycles, such as [Ru(tpy)(Me2bpy)(py)]2+ and [Ru(phen)2(econazole)2]2+.64,70 All of these Ru(II)-caged complexes are able to effectively release the caged aromatic heterocycles upon light irradiation. However, most of the ongoing research still largely rely on the use of Ru(bpy)2 or Ru(phen)2 for photocaging.
3.1 [Ru(TPA)]2+ as a photocaging group for aromatic heterocycles
Because aromatic heterocycles are considerably stronger σ-donors than nitriles, we sought to derivatize Ru(TPA) for caging strong σ-donors. As an initial study, we used Ru(TPA) to cage pyridines (py, 15), nicotinamides (NA, 16), and imidazoles (Im, 17) (Fig. 7). Similar to the nitrile-caged complex 7, two equivalents of aromatic heterocycles are bound to the ruthenium center.100 However, in contrast to the nitrile-caged Ru(II) complexes that require UV light for uncaging, Ru(TPA)-caged aromatic heterocycles show strong absorption in the visible range and can be selectively released upon irradiation with visible light. The absorption of these complexes in the visible range is attributed to several overlapping 1MLCT transitions that occur between the Ru(II) dπ orbitals and the π* orbital of the pyridines in TPA, according to DFT calculations. As expected, the cis aromatic heterocycles are rapidly released upon irradiation with visible light. The quantum yields (Φ400) for the release of these ligands were determined to be 9.7(8) × 10−3, 9.1(8) × 10−3 and 5.3(3) × 10−4 in H2O, respectively. As expected, these values are lower than that measured for [Ru(TPA)(MeCN)2]2+ (7), Φ350 = 0.012(1), consistent with the binding characters of pyridines and imidazoles that form stronger interactions with ruthenium center compared to nitriles. It is worthy to note that in 15–17 longer irradiation times also achieve the substitution of the trans aromatic heterocycles by H2O. All Ru(TPA)-caged aromatic heterocycles are extremely stable in the dark in aqueous solutions, including in cell growth media at 37 °C over the course of 24 h. Cell viability measured against human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells indicate that the complexes and their metal-containing photoproducts are non-toxic either under dark or light conditions. Therefore, Ru(TPA) is not only an effective photocaging group for nitriles and aromatic heterocycles but also has ideal properties for building new chemical tools. The different photophysical and photochemical properties of Ru(TPA) complexes support further development of Ru(II) photocaging groups with higher-denticity ancillary ligands.

3.2 Ru(tpy)(diimine) fragments as photocaging groups for enzyme inhibitors
[Ru(tpy)(diimine)(L)]2+ (L = monodentate ligand) complexes represent another common class of Ru(II)-based protecting groups for caging bioactive molecules.36,49,65,70,75,77,78 Previous work has successfully demonstrated that the molecules caged by Ru(tpy)(diimine), such as thioethers and pyridines, are efficiently released upon light irradiation.49,65,70,101 The introduction of the steric bulk on the bpy framework, such as bpy, Me2bpy (6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) and biq (2,2′-biquinoline), distorts the pseudo-octahedral geometry around ruthenium center, which weakens the Ru–L (L = caged molecules) bond and then affords an enhancement of the quantum efficiency of ligand dissociation.70,102,103 In addition, Ru(tpy)(diimine) only has one coordination site available for caging. Recently, our groups applied Ru(tpy)(diimine) to caging larger bioactive molecules that contain aromatic heterocycles, including epoxysuccinyl-based inhibitors of cysteine cathepsin L104 and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYPs),105 for the purpose of achieving high spatial and temporal control over enzyme activity.

3.2.1 Ru(tpy)(diimine) for caging cysteine cathepsin L inhibitors. 
Following the work based on using Ru(bpy)2 to cage nitrile-based cathepsin inhibitors, we continued to probe cysteine protease inhibition by caging cathepsin inhibitors with the [Ru(tpy)(Me2bpy)] group. CLIK-148 and CLIK-181 (Fig. 8A) are known epoxysuccinyl-based inhibitors that effectively deactivate cathepsin L in a biological environment, where a covalent σ-bond is generated through the irreversible nucleophilic attack from the active thiolate of cathepsin L to the epoxide ring within these inhibitors.106–108 However, since epoxysuccinyl-based inhibitors normally lack functional that are capable of metal binding, two modified CLIK inhibitors, 18 and 19 (Fig. 8A), that have similar potency to CLIK-148 and CLIK-181 were designed, synthesized and caged by [Ru(tpy)(Me2bpy)(L)]2+ to generate 20 and 21 (Fig. 8B), respectively.104 Each modified CLIK inhibitor possesses a pyridyl moiety that coordinates to the ruthenium center.
 Fig. 8  (A) Structures of CLIK-148 and CLIK-181; (B) structures of CLIK-modified cathepsin L inhibitors, 18 and 19; structures of [Ru(tpy)(Me2bpy)(py-R)]Cl2, where py-R is inhibitor 18 and 19, respectively. 
Interestingly, although complex 20 is stable in the dark, cathepsin L activity is inactivated in the dark once the enzyme is treated with the complex. The inhibition introduced by complex 20 under dark conditions is comparable to that caused by the free inhibitor 18 alone, suggesting that the caged 18 can bind to the active site of cathepsin L without breaking the Ru–N (py-R) bond. Complex 21, on the other hand, is not as stable in the dark, with 30% of cathepsin L activity consumed after 1 h of incubation with the enzyme. However, a >10-fold stronger cathepsin L inhibition was observed when 21 was exposed to visible light. This suggests that the inhibition of cathepsin L by 21 largely depends on light irradiation, where the caged inhibitor is unleashed, leading to enzyme inhibition. Therefore, these [Ru(tpy)(Me2bpy)]2+-caged epoxysuccinyl inhibitors, 20 and 21, exhibit different mechanisms for inactivating cathepsin L.
Since 20 inhibits cathepsin L in the dark, the binding behavior of the complex was further evaluated by using papain. Data measured by LCMS revealed that 20 binds to the active site thiolate of cathepsin L in the dark, and that [Ru(tpy)(Me2bpy)(OH2)]2+ is released from the papain inhibitor-conjugate upon exposure to light (Fig. 9). This experiment demonstrates that Ru(II)-caged enzyme inhibitors can inhibit enzymes in a different manner, where the Ru(II) photocaging groups are released upon light irradiation after the caged inhibitor binds to its target.

3.2.2 Ru(tpy)(diimine) for caging cytochrome P450 inhibitors. 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are heme-containing monooxygenases that catalyze steroid biosynthesis and drug metabolism in humans.109 Inhibition of CYPs regulates adverse drug–substrate interactions and prevents steroid production, making them attractive targets for the treatments of common diseases.110–113 However, since CYP activity is sometimes upregulated in diseased tissues but also plays a crucial role in other areas of the body, traditional CYP inhibition lacks selectivity and usually causes severe side effects.114 Metal-based photocaging provides an attractive approach for gaining spatiotemporal control over CYP inhibition in vivo. Recently, the Glazer group reported Ru(bpy)2-caged prodrugs for controlling CYP11B1 inhibition, where the caged inhibitors were released upon light irradiation.68 However, such a method still relies on Ru(bpy)2 as photocages. In addition, they stated that the aqua complex [Ru(bpy)2(H2O)2]2+ generated after the photorelease of the caged inhibitors directly targets DNA to induce DNA damage, which offers a dual function beyond just CYP11B1 inhibition.68 However, according to the recent study of the Bonnet group on the determination of cytotoxicity of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes and their photoproducts, [Ru(bpy)2(H2O)2]2+ is in fact hydrophilic and thus unable to cross cell membranes to cause damage to DNA.115 In an effort to develop photochemical agents for controlling CYP activity with low-energy light, our group further applied the Ru(tpy)(diimine) group for caging CYP inhibitors.
CYP17A1 is an important CYP protein that catalyzes androgen synthesis in humans that contributes to proliferation of prostate cancer cells.30 Abiraterone (ABI) is a known potent steroidal inhibitor of CYP17A1 and effectively prevents androgen production.29,116–119 Abiraterone acetate, a prodrug form of ABI, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.119 In order to control CYP17A1 activity with light, our group designed and synthesized Ru(tpy)(diimine)-caged ABI complexes, which effectively release ABI upon irradiation with low-energy light.105 Due to the outstanding efficacy of photoinduced ligand exchange presented by caging pyridines with Ru(tpy)(Me2bpy) and Ru(tpy)(biq) fragments,49,70 both were used to cage ABI in complexes 22 and 23 (Fig. 10), which exhibit strong absorption in the visible range. However, complex 22 photodissociates ABI more efficiently than complex 23, with quantum yields of ABI exchange for solvent of 0.049(5) and 0.018(1) in CH3CN and H2O, respectively.

In order to gain insight into the binding behavior of CYP17A1, complex 22 was chosen to evaluate the CYP17A1–ABI binding under dark and photolysis conditions. The spectral properties of the heme of CYPs are usually utilized to monitor the CYP–substrate binding.28,120 According to the structural analysis of CYP17A1 reported by the Scott group, ABI binds to CYP17A1 with a high affinity through a typical Type II binding mode.28 Similar binding difference spectra were obtained with the light-exposed complex 22, where the released ABI replaced the H2O molecule that is bound to the heme iron for CYP17A1 inhibition (Fig. 11A).28,30,116 This binding assay resulted in an estimated Kd value of 89.6 ± 10.5 nM (Fig. 11B), similar to free ABI that binds to CYP17A1 with Kd ≈ 100 nM. In contrast, similar Type II binding difference spectra were not observed under dark conditions (data are not shown), which implies that the Ru(II)-caged ABI complex is still intact and does not inhibit the enzyme in the absence of light.

The evaluation of 22 and 23 against DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells121 confirmed that low-energy light can be used to liberate ABI in a cellular environment, achieving photochemical control over cell death. For these experiments, 22, 23 and ABI were evaluated for effects on viability against the DU145 cell line. With 22, cell viability drops sharply at concentrations higher than 20 μM under irradiation, similar to ABI, whereas in the dark minimal effects on viability are observed (Fig. 12). In contrast, 23 resulted in significant toxicity under both light and dark conditions (data are not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the nature of the Ru(II) caging group plays a role in controlling cellular behavior, including toxicity. To conclude, CYP17A1 binding is controlled with light using Ru(tpy)(diimine) photocaging groups. The bidentate diimine ligands increase the efficiency of photoinduced ligand exchange, making Ru(tpy)(diimine) fragments promising chemical agents for controlling enzyme inhibition with low-energy light.

Cells were incubated in the presence of 22 (10 mM to 100 mM) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by 10 min incubation in the dark at room temperature or irradiated with a 250 W tungsten halogen lamp (λirr = 395 nm). The cytotoxic compound thapsigargin (TPG; 10 mM) was used as a positive control. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean of quadruple wells, and data are representative of four independent experiments. 

4. Conclusions
In this Feature Article, recent developments of Ru(II) photocaging nitriles and aromatic heterocycles from our groups have been discussed. We designed and synthesized Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes that can selectively release caged nitriles and aromatic heterocycles as photochemical agents for controlling biological activity with light. Because most of the Ru(II)-based photocaging groups are based on lower-denticity ancillary ligands, we developed new ancillary ligands with denticity of four or above for caging. Nitriles and nitrile-containing bioactive molecules, such as cysteine protease inhibitors, are successfully caged by Ru(bpy)2 and Ru(TPA), and the caged inhibitors are effectively released upon light irradiation for enzyme inhibition. In addition, we, for the first time, introduced solid-phase synthesis to rapidly screen and identify Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes that allow access to photochemical properties using visible light. Further, we demonstrated that orbital mixing facilitates photoinduced ligand exchange, and steric effects can also be used to increase the efficacy of photodissociation. Recently, we used Ru(TPA) and Ru(tpy)(diimine) to cage aromatic heterocycles, including cysteine protease and CYP inhibitors. The Ru(II)-caged aromatic heterocycles absorb strongly in the visible range and can be released upon irradiation with low-energy light. Importantly, we validated CYP17A1 binding behavior with Ru(II)-caged ABI complexes under dark and light conditions, making it promising to design photoactivated inhibitors to inactivate CYP activity with high spatiotemporal control.
Many exciting advancements have been made in the last decade by directing Ru(II)-based photocaging towards biological problems, including the development of chemical tools and prototypes for photoactivated drugs. Our groups have contributed to this field by demonstrating light-activated control over enzyme inhibition in cells and by developing high-denticity ligands for Ru(II) caging groups that provide distinctive photophysical and photochemical properties. However, most of these studies investigate Ru(II) photocaging in vitro. Therefore, future work will be needed in this area for in vivo validation, including the development of Ru(II) photocaging groups that release ligands with longer wavelengths for achieving tissue penetration into the red and near-IR regions. This can be achieved by tuning the nature of ancillary ligands of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes with extended π-system or by introducing electron-donating substituents to ancillary ligands. In addition, in order to increase the biocompatibility of ruthenium polypyridyl cages, complexes need to be more water-soluble and show slow rates of ligand exchange in solution in the dark, in addition to higher levels of turn on for readouts such as cytotoxicity upon photoexcitation. Overall, Ru(II) photocaging is still in an early stage of development, but given its potential to control where and when bioactive compounds and drugs are released, further work is certainly needed.
