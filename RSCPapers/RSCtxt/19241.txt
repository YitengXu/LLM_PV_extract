, Accepted 10th October 2016First published on 10th October 2016AbstractAn efficient route to synthesise hybrid polymers consisting of a semiconducting polymer and a fullerene unit, for BHJ OPV devices is presented herein. The synthetic procedure is based on the in situ functionalisation of regioregular polythiophenes of various molecular weights with perfluorophenyl moieties at the ω end position of the polymeric chains, after the GRIM polymerisation reaction. Each of the perfluorophenyl moieties is then decorated with an azide group, and employed in a [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction with fullerene species, i.e. C70 or IC70MA, yielding P3HT–fullerene hybrids covalently linked via aziridine bridges. The effectiveness of the purification procedures of the above organic and hybrid materials were evaluated by extended spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. The optical and electrochemical characterisation of the resulting hybrid structures revealed that the unique optoelectronic properties of the P3HT polymers are retained in the hybrid materials. Whereas the morphological properties are largely affected by the introduction of the C70 and IC70MA fullerenes. The enhanced and tunable nanophase separation observed in the polymer–fullerene hybrid films coupled with their excellent optoelectronic properties makes them exciting potential polymeric additives for the P3HT:IC70BA active blends.
Introduction
Low-cost organic photovoltaics hold significant potential for meeting future electricity demands and have steadily approached economic feasibility in recent years.1–3 One of the most efficient device architectures is bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells in which the donor and the acceptor components are blended together to form a bicontinuous interpenetrating network.4,5 In order to achieve highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), the choice of the donor and the acceptor materials in such devices is crucial and both the electronic structure and the morphology6 of the resulting mixture have to be considered. Among the most widely used electron donating polymers,7,8 the regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) is by far the most commonly studied due to both relatively easy and cost efficient preparation and electronic properties matching the demand of the device architecture.9 The state of the art electron acceptor components are various C60 fullerene derivatives.10 The typical BHJ devices comprise a mixture of P3HT and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and exhibit moderate power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4–5% which is however lower than desired. Thermal treatment11,12 or solvent and vapour13 annealing, as well as mixture solvent treatment14,15 led to improved nano-scaled morphology of the active layer and so to slightly higher efficiencies. Development of new generation fullerene acceptors, based on the bis-functionalisation pattern of the fullerene cage16–18 as well as the replacement of C60 fullerene with the stronger absorbing C70,16 and the incorporation of slightly electron donating indene groups,19 resulted in the highly efficient acceptors indene-C70 mono- and, most importantly, bis-adducts (IC70MA and IC70BA respectively).20 As a result, the LUMO level in IC70BA is 0.19 eV higher as compared to PCBM and 0.07 eV higher as compared to the analogous bis-PCBM adducts.16 Consequently, the BHJ devices featuring the P3HT:IC70BA mixtures show remarkably high Voc of 0.86 V and average PCEs of 6.5%,20 and upon further optimization of the morphology of the active layer21,22 and device architecture23,24 have achieved PCEs as high as 7.4%.
The performance of such devices can be further improved by the stabilization and control over the morphology of the P3HT:fullerene active blends. This can be achieved through several approaches: (1) functionalisation of either the electron donor or electron acceptor with different functional groups to affect the miscibility and thus co-crystallization in the blend;25–28 (2) employing various thermal or solvent annealing steps which both improve the nanophase separation,11,29,30 or (3) incorporation of hybrid materials, consisting of a semiconducting polymer and a carbon nanostructure, as compatibilisers of the polymer/fullerene binary blend25,31–35 or (4) non-covalent interactions between compatibilisers bearing nitrogen heterocycles (such as pyridine-units) and the fullerene acceptor of the active blend.36–38 Incorporation of small amounts (1–20 wt%) of such compatibilisers in the polymer:fullerene blend affects the morphology of the final blend and enhances phase stability between the major components. Various synthetic strategies have been exploited for the preparation of such hybrid polymeric architectures, mostly employing multi-step synthetic procedures as well as the introduction of non-conjugated connecting bridges between the semiconducting polymer and the carbon nanostructure. Recently developed new synthetic approaches instead utilise the “direct” attachment of the semiconductor to the fullerene cage via diamino-,39 cyclopentadienyl-,40 or aziridine-41–43 functional groups resulting in nearly fully conjugated systems.
In this work, we focus on the development of such hybrid polymeric materials based on a previously reported methodology.41 More specifically, the electron deficient perfluorophenyl moiety is introduced at the ω end position of regioregular-P3HT oligomers, during the polymerization step, in high yields followed by the substitution of one of the fluoride groups with the highly reactive azide functionality. Afterwards, the azide moiety engages in a [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction with a fullerene species, either C70 or IC70MA, affording the hybrid semiconducting poly(thiophene). Extensive purification and combined structural characterization was performed for the polymeric precursors and the final hybrid materials to ensure the successful introduction of the fullerenes onto the P3HT polymeric chains. The optical, electronic and morphological properties of the final hybrid materials revealed potential application of these polymers as additives of the P3HT:IC70BA based BHJ OPVs devices.
Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Fullerene carbon (C70, 99.5%) was purchased from SES research. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was purchased from Aldrich and dried by distillation with benzophenone and metallic sodium (THFdry). All the other solvents and reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification unless otherwise stated.
2.2. Instrumentation
1H, 13C, 19F, 15N NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance DPX 400.13, 100.6 and 376.5, 40.55 MHz spectrometer, respectively, using CDCl3 as solvent containing TMS as internal standard.
Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) measurements were carried out using a Polymer Lab chromatographer equipped with two PLgel 5 μm mixed columns and a UV detector, using CHCl3 as an eluent with a flow rate of 1 mL min−1 at 25 °C, molecular weight calibration versus polystyrene standards. The UV-Vis detector was set at 440 nm were the maximum absorbance wavelength of rr-P3HT is located.

A glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt wire secondary electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode (chemically isolated from the test solution via a bridge tube containing electrolyte solution and fitted with a porous Vycor frit) were used in the cell. Experiments were performed under an atmosphere of argon and in anhydrous solvents. Sample solutions were prepared under an atmosphere of argon using Schlenk line techniques and consisted of a 0.2 M [nBu4N][BF4] solution as the supporting electrolyte and a 0.5–1 mM solution of the test compound. Redox potentials were referenced vs. the Fc+/Fc couple, which was used as an internal standard. Compensation for internal resistance was not applied.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL JEM2100 operating at 200 kV. Sample preparation for TEM examination involved the preparation of dilute solutions of the samples in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and filtration through a 0.45 μm filter. A drop of the solution was placed on 3 mm carbon coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and the samples were dried in air for 2 days. Image post-analysis of the hybrid polymers was performed in ImageJ.44,45

Results and discussion
We have recently reported a versatile approach for creating semiconducting polymer–fullerene hybrid structures based on the [3 + 2] cyloaddition reaction of perfluorophenylazide tagged semiconducting small molecules or polymers and C60-fullerene derivatives. This method is straightforward and high yielding, and has been successfully employed for the functionalization of pristine C60 as well as of the C60 derivative, PC61BM in good yields.41 We have therefore utilized the same methodology in the present study for the preparation of C70-containing hybrid polymers. To assess the reactivity of C70 and develop the procedure for C70 functionalisation with semiconducting polymers, we have initially performed a model reaction between C70 and a small molecule, namely phenyl perfluorophenylquinoline azide (Ph-5FQ-N3) (Scheme S1†). The [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between the Ph-5FQ-N3 and the C70 was performed in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at 140 °C, followed by chromatographic purification (eluents:petroleum ether, petroleum ether:toluene gradient mixtures) to give the Ph-5FQ–N–C70 hybrid in good yields (60%). The structure of the Ph-5FQ–N–C70 hybrid was confirmed by a combination of 13C NMR, ATR, UV-Vis and PL spectroscopies proving the successful functionalisation of C70 via the perfluorophenyl aziridine bridge formation (see ESI file for details†).
This methodology was then transferred to the rr-P3HT precursors for the preparation of P3HT–fullerene hybrids. We initially synthesized ω end perfluorophenyl regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophenes) (rr-P3HT-5F) of different molecular weights, which were then transformed to azides followed by the [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction with the C70 or IC70MA fullerenes to yield the corresponding P3HT–fullerene hybrid semiconducting polymers.
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of P3HT-hybrids
Preparation of azide P3HT-5F precursors. End functionalized perfluorophenyl regioregular-polythiophene (rr-P3HT-5F) can be synthesized in two ways. The first method involves a Suzuki cross coupling reaction of a perfluorophenylboronic acid with the “living” bromide end groups of rr-P3HT chains46 produced via the GRIM polymerization. The second method, which was used in this study, involves the in situ addition of perfluorophenylmagnesium bromide directly in the polymerization medium after the completion of the GRIM polymerization step (Scheme 1).28 The successful introduction of the perfluorophenyl ring was confirmed through 19F NMR and ATR spectroscopies (Fig. S8,† 1). The 19F NMR spectrum of rr-P3HT-5F presents three peaks at −100.51, −130.46, −136.41 ppm corresponding to the pentafluorophenyl unit (Fig. S8†). Additionally, the ATR spectrum of the end rr-P3HT-5F presents a strong band at 1250 cm−1 and two strong bands at 1020–1090 cm−1, which are absent in the non-functionalized P3HT. These bands are attributed to the vibration of C–F bond and the vibration of the phenyl ring respectively (Fig. 1), confirming the successful introduction of the perfluorophenyl unit at the end of the P3HT chain.

In order to investigate the influence of the molecular weight (MW) of the P3HT on the properties of the targeted hybrid materials, end rr-P3HT-5F with different molecular weight (low MW n = 6, medium MW n = 12, high MW n = 80) have been synthesized. The preparation of the low and medium MW end P3HTs was achieved by performing the polymerization reaction using an increased amount of the Ni-catalyst (Ni(dppp)Cl2) compared to the monomer (M), corresponding to a ratio of [M]:[catalyst] = 50:1 in contrast to the typical ratio of 136:1. The crude end P3HT-5F was then purified via Soxhlet extraction using methanol, followed by acetone, hexane and chloroform as solvents.
The low MW end P3HT-5F (n = 6) was obtained from the hexane extract, while the medium MW end P3HT-5F (n = 12) proceeded from the CHCl3 fraction. The high MW end P3HT-5F (n = 80) polymer was synthesized in the same manner using the [M]:[catalyst] = 125:1 ratio and was isolated from the CHCl3 fraction of the Soxhlet purification procedure. The resulting end P3HT-5F polymers were characterized, in respect to their molecular characteristics, by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) revealing that the polymers synthesized herein are of narrow polydispersities with the polydispersity indexes (PDI) of ∼1.3. Moreover, the relative integral intensities of the thiophene protons at 6.99 ppm and of the α-methylene protons at 2.58 ppm in 1H NMR spectra were used to calculate the average number of thiophene repeating units in each case, namely of 6, 12 and 80 thiophene repeating units for the low MW, medium MW and high MW polymers, respectively (Table 1).

Since polymer MW characterization via SEC inherently deviate from the true polymer characteristics due to differences in the hydrodynamic volume of the materials versus that of the polystyrene calibrants, we carried out all further calculations using the average number of repeating units derived via 1H NMR spectroscopy.
Thereafter, the end-perfluorophenyl rr-(P3HT)n-5F polymers were quantitatively transformed into azides via a nucleophilic substitution of the para fluorine atom, using sodium azide in the presence of 18-crown-6 in a THF/DMF solvent mixture,47 resulting in the end (P3HT)n-5F–N3 of different MWs (n = 6, n = 12 and n = 80) (Scheme 1). The successful azidation of the end P3HT-5Fs was confirmed using ATR and 15N NMR spectroscopies (Fig. 1, S9†). The low MW fraction showed a clear peak at 2100 cm−1 in the ATR spectrum owing to the azide functionality48 (Fig. 1). The characteristic peak of the azide group in the ATR spectra of medium and high MW end P3HT-5F–N3 was indistinguishable due to the low concentration of the azide functionality in the final polymers. However, 15N NMR spectroscopy of all molecular weights of (P3HT)n-5F–N3 clearly showed two peaks attributed to the two different nitrogen environments of the azide functionality and thus the successful azidation in each case (Fig. S9†).

Preparation of the C70-containing hybrids. The three different MW perfluorophenyl azide polythiophenes ((P3HT)n-5F–N3) were utilized in a [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction with either C70 or IC70MA according to the method described above, providing the desired hybrid semiconducting polymers (Scheme 2, Table 1). After completion of the reaction, the resulting hybrid materials were washed thoroughly with either tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the case of C70, or Et2O in the case of IC70MA hybrids to remove any traces of unreacted fullerenes and azide precursors.
 Scheme 2  [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between the P3HT-5F–N3 and C70 or IC70MA resulting the (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 and (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA hybrids, respectively. 
A thorough ATR investigation of the purified hybrid materials versus the crude reaction mixtures and the initial polymer and fullerene precursors was carried out in order to assess the efficiency of the purification procedure (Fig. 2, S4 and S5†). The spectra of the crude (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 hybrids (Fig. 2a, black curve) show high contents of fullerenes due to the intense peaks in the area of 450–790 cm−1 and 1424 cm−1. In the purified hybrid polymers a drastic decrease of the intensity of these peaks is observed, providing strong evidence of the successful removal of any unreacted C70 (Fig. 2a, green curve). The purification of (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA hybrids was carried out in a similar manner (Fig. 2b), but was less straightforward. Due to the similar solubilities of the hybrid material and IC70MA in most solvents, selective removal of the unreacted IC70MA is trickier, particularly for lower MW fractions. Therefore additional chromatographic purification of the medium MW (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA (n = 12) was employed to achieve complete removal of the unreacted IC70MA (see ESI file for details†).
 Fig. 2  ATR spectra of the crude and purified medium MW end P3HT-5F–N–fullerene hybrids with (a) C70 and (b) IC70MA in comparison with the initial P3HT-5F and the corresponding fullerene precursors. 
The resulting hybrids were characterized by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C NMR, and ATR spectroscopies. MALDI TOF mass spectra of low, medium and high MW fractions of (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 exhibit a very strong peak with m/z 840 corresponding to the C70 fragment, whereas all (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA hybrids exhibit a very strong peak with m/z 956 corresponding to the IC70MA unit, both unambiguously confirming the formation of the desired hybrid structures (see ESI for details†). The corresponding molecular ion peaks were not observed in any of the hybrids suggesting that the strain energy in the three-membered aziridine ring is high and fragmentation is more favourable than the ionization of the entire hybrid molecule, even with low laser powers.49
1H NMR spectroscopy of (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 shows only the signals corresponding to the P3HT fragments, (Fig. S10†). On the other hand, the 1H NMR spectra of the (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA hybrids additionally show a number of weak signals in the regions 3.0–5.0 ppm and 7.0–7.6 ppm characteristic of the aliphatic bridge protons and of the aromatic protons of the indene functional group on the IC70MA fragment, respectively. These signals are not present in neither the end-P3HT-5F precursors, nor in the C70-containing hybrids (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70, additionally confirming the successful introduction of the IC70MA functionality (Fig. S11 and S12†). Furthermore, 13C NMR spectroscopy characterization of both low MW P3HT-5F–N–C70 and medium MW P3HT-5F–N–IC70MA presents conclusive evidence of the successful functionalisation of the polymer chain with the fullerene cage (Fig. 3). Both the C70 and IC70MA containing hybrids show the characteristic signals of the rr-P3HT backbone in 139.94, 133.75, 130.55, 128.67 ppm region. The 13C NMR spectrum of the low MW P3HT-5F–N–C70 shows ∼30 additional peaks of lower intensity, compared to the initial P3HT in the 120–150 ppm region confirming the successful functionalisation of the C70 cage as well as the formation of the hybrid structure. The 13C NMR spectrum of the medium MW P3HT-5F–N–IC70MA hybrid exhibits a higher number of fullerene related signals (over 30 peaks in the region 120–150 ppm). This is consistent with the lower symmetry of the bis-functionalized C70 cage and potential presence of more than one regioisomers, and this unambiguously confirms the proposed structure. Unfortunately, for the higher MW polymeric hybrids the fullerene signals could not be clearly distinguished due to the low relative fraction of the fullerenes in those samples.

3.2. Electronic properties of the P3HT-5F–N–C70 and P3HT-5F–N–IC70MA hybrids
The UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all end (P3HT)n-5F–C70 and end (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA hybrids were recorded in toluene solutions as well as in film form. The UV-Vis spectra of all hybrid materials in solutions essentially comprise a superposition of the characteristic absorption peaks of the P3HT and the fullerene components (Fig. 4). The strong P3HT absorption dominates the spectrum in each case, with the absorbance maximum slightly red shifted with the increase of the molecular weight: 440 nm in the low MW, 450 nm in the medium MW and at 460 nm in the high MW polymer, respectively. Additionally, both C70- and IC70MA-tagged hybrids exhibit the characteristic absorbance bands of the C70 cage, showing transitions at 335, 363, 382 and 600 nm in the former and at 350, 400 and 560 nm in the latter structures. These absorption bands are notable in both low and medium MW fractions, and are undistinguishable in the high MW fraction due to the low ratio of the fullerene unit over the polymer within these hybrids (Fig. 4a and b). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all end (P3HT)n-5F-hybrids in toluene solutions (Fig. S13–S15†) after excitation at 440 nm corresponding to the P3HT absorption maximum, showed the characteristic photoluminescence peaks of the poly(thiophene) segments, however no quenching of the luminescence in the hybrid polymeric materials.

The absorption (Fig. 5 and 6a) and emission spectra (Fig. 6b, S16 and S17†) of all end (P3HT)n-5F-hybrid materials have also been recorded in film form. Similarly to the solution spectra, the absorption spectrum of each polymeric material shows the strong characteristic absorbance of the P3HT backbone, as well as weaker characteristic absorbance peaks of the functionalized C70 in the 200–400 nm region (Fig. 5).

In contrast, the photoluminescence spectra of (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 and (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA recorded in film form, upon excitation at 520 nm, showed small but notable differences compared to the solution measurements (Fig. 6b, S16 and S17†). The medium and high MW (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA (Fig. S17b,† 6b) as well as the high MW (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 hybrid films (Fig. 6b) showed notable decrease of the photoluminescence intensity. Whereas the PL intensity in the low and medium MW (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 slightly increased compared to their analogous fullerene-free precursors (Fig. S16b and S17b†). Such non-linear behaviour may be related to the changes in the film structure of the different hybrid materials, as well as the known concentration dependence of the P3HT photoluminescence intensity.50
However, some degree of electronic interactions between the IC70MA component and the P3HT backbone cannot be excluded, as well as possible non-uniformity in the film thickness between the different samples. In all hybrid polymer cases, however, a total PL quenching is not anticipated since the weight fraction of the fullerene species is below that of the P3HT weight fraction. The P3HT absorption maxima are slightly red shifted with the increasing molecular weight of the sample, following the same trend as observed in solution.
C70 fullerene exhibits a characteristic emission in the 700–750 nm region, the peak position of which depends on the functionalisation pattern of the fullerene cage and can shift slightly upon functionalisation, thus providing useful structural information. However, the quantum yield of this emission is extremely low and normally has values of ×10−4.51,52 On the contrary, P3HT is a strong fluorophore, with a broad emission peak centred around 550 nm and quantum yield values of ×10−2,53 which is two orders of magnitude higher than the fullerene emission. Fig. S18† shows photoluminescence maps of IC70MA (a), (P3HT)n-5F (n = 6) (b), and (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA (n = 12) (c) recorded in toluene solutions of similar concentrations and centred around the 650–750 nm emission region where the fullerene photoluminescence is expected. Although the maximum of P3HT photoluminescence is well outside of this region, the tail of its emission peak is still visible (Fig. S18b†) and has relatively strong intensity compared to the IC70MA (Fig. S18a†). As a result, the photoluminescence map of the hybrid material (Fig. S18c†) is dominated by the emission of the P3HT backbone, and the fullerene-related emission cannot be distinguished, therefore making any further structural conclusions unfeasible.
To get a further insight into the electronic properties of the resulting hybrids cyclic voltammetric analysis has also been performed. The cyclic voltammograms have been recorded in o-DCB solutions containing 0.2 M [nBu4N][BF4] as supporting electrolyte at 0.1 V s−1. The observed redox potentials for each hybrid are summarized in Table 2 and an example of a typical CV is given in Fig. 7, while the voltammograms of the remaining materials are presented in Fig. S19–S21.† Each of the hybrid polymers as well as their perfluorinated precursors exhibit a set of several broad overlapping irreversible oxidation processes in the range from +0.08 to +0.70 V corresponding to the sequential oxidation of a number of P3HT units.54 The intensity and the position of the onset potential of this process vary from the low to medium and high MW fractions.55–57 Moreover, each of the fullerene-containing hybrids (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 and (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA also shows three quasi-reversible reduction processes, significantly lower in intensity than the P3HT oxidation (Fig. 7, S20 and S21†). These reduction processes are observed at −1.01/−1.02, −1.39/−1.41 and −1.80/−1.83 V in all (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70, and at −1.14, −1.51 and −1.87/−1.89 V in all (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA hybrids. Comparison of the redox potentials of the corresponding hybrids (Table 2) with the unfunctionalised C70, indene-C70 monoadduct (IC70MA) and a C70-indene bis-adduct (IC70BA)20 suggests that these one-electron reduction processes most likely correspond to the sequential fullerene cage reductions C70/C701−, C701−/C702− and C702−/C703−, respectively.

 Fig. 7  Cyclic voltammogram of low MW P3HT-5F–N–C70 recorded in o-DCB containing 0.2 M [nBu4N][BF4] as supporting electrolyte at 0.1 V s−1. 
Each of the reduction processes is slightly shifted towards more negative values in (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA as compared to (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 hybrids which is characteristic of the increasing degree of functionalization of the fullerene cage.20 Notably, the fullerene-related processes are observed in all hybrid samples regardless of the molecular weight, although their intensity decreases as the molecular weight increases (Fig. S20†).
3.3. Morphology of the P3HT–fullerene hybrids
Thin film morphology of all end P3HT-5F and their respective fullerene-containing hybrids was probed by transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) (Fig. 8, S22†). The functionalised end (P3HT)n-5F polymers exhibit formation of homogeneous thin films whereas their corresponding fullerene-containing hybrids ((P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 and (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA) show higher nanophase separation due to the attachment of the fullerene cage. Notably, neither of the hybrids displayed any aggregates formation.
 Fig. 8  TEM images of medium and high MW end-(P3HT)n-5F, (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 and (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA hybrids obtained by drop casting dilute solution of the corresponding polymer in o-DCB on the TEM grid without any thermal treatment (scale bar 20 nm). 
As the molecular weight of the end (P3HT)n-5F increases, the films present better organization and thus formation of larger domains. The low MW P3HT-5F–N–C70 hybrid showed a more phase separated thin film compared to its fullerene-free polymer with notable crystallization of the P3HT chains as evident from the grey rod like structures (Fig. S22†). On the contrary, the medium and high MW (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 hybrids showed formation of uniform films with extended phase separation compared to their corresponding end (P3HT)n-5F polymeric precursors, with the domain size increasing from the medium to high MW fraction. The films of both medium and high MW IC70MA-containing hybrids, (P3HT)n-5F–N–IC70MA, also showed notable change in the morphology compared to their initial fullerene-free analogues resulting in higher nanophase separated thin films. However, the domain size of the IC70MA-tagged hybrids is smaller than of their respective end (P3HT)n-5F–C70 hybrids. This is related to the effect of indene functional group which is known to improve the miscibility of the fullerene with the P3HT polymer58 therefore resulting in improved, nanostructured and homogeneous film formation.
More specifically, quantitative statistical analyses of the TEM images of different hybrids revealed that the dark regions, identified as C70-rich regions, in the medium and high MW (P3HT)n-5F–N–C70 are of 0.7–2 nm and 1.4–3.5 nm size, respectively. Whereas the IC70MA medium and high MW hybrids show the formation of the dark fullerene-rich regions of 0.5–2 nm in both cases.
Conclusions
An efficient route to synthesize hybrid additives for the P3HT:IC70BA based BHJ OPV devices has been developed. The three-step synthetic procedure is based on the in situ introduction of a pentafluorophenyl moiety to the ω end position of the polythiophene backbone during the polymerisation step, followed by the substitution of the para fluorine atom with a functional azide group. The azide-functionalized P3HT polymers are then reacted with pristine C70 or indene-C70 monoadduct (IC70MA) via a [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction providing the corresponding hybrid materials. The synthetic procedure has been tailored to tune the molecular weight of the resulting polymer, yielding structures with the polythiophene chain varying from 6 to 80 thiophene repeating units, and the subsequent introduction of both unfunctionalised C70 and indene-C70 monoadduct (IC70MA).
The properties of the resulting hybrid structures have been thoroughly investigated showing that the electronic properties of the P3HT polymer are largely unaffected by the introduction of the fullerene cage at the end position of the polymeric chain. The morphology of the resulting hybrid materials is notably different from the fullerene-free analogues, showing an enhanced nanophase separation. The domain sizes in all C70-containing hybrids are notably larger than in the IC70MA-containing hybrids, demonstrating the importance of the indene functional group in tuning the morphology of the resulting films. Due to their unique electronic and morphological properties the hybrid polymers reported in this study are expected to improve and stabilize the morphology of the P3HT:IC70BA photoactive blend, which becomes more and more widely used to produce highly efficient and cheap large scale OPV devices. The addition of small quantities of these hybrids as compatibilising additives into the P3HT:IC70BA blend may allow better control over the film morphology of the active layer whilst not perturbing the electronic structure of the blend.
