    , Accepted 28th April 2020First published on 28th April 2020AbstractIn this work, CuS nanostructures are successfully synthesized by using two different structure directing agents, cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). For comparison CuS nanostructures are also synthesized without a structure directing agent. The morphologically dependent electrochemical properties such as the capacity, cycling stability, rate capability and capacitive controlled kinetics are comparatively investigated for potassium-ion batteries. The structure directing agents play a vital role in determining the surface area and electrochemical performance of the CuS nanostructures. The CTAB based CuS nanostructure shows a flake like morphology (length 100–150 nm and diameter 5–10 nm) whereas the SDS based CuS exhibits nanospheres with a particle size of 5–15 nm. The capacity, cycling stability and capacitive contribution are higher for the SDS assisted synthesis of the CuS based electrodes as compared to the CTAB assisted CuS and CuS without any agent. At a low current density of 0.1 A g−1, the SDS based CuS electrode exhibits an excellent reversible capacity of 470 mA h g−1. It also exhibits a stable reversible capacity of 451 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 73% after 500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (500 mA g−1). The excellent electrochemical performance of the SDS based CuS is attributed to its spherical morphology with a smaller particle size that exhibits a large surface area and the resulting surface dominated pseudocapacitive mechanism enhances the K+ ion storage. The comparative study of these CuS nanostructures can afford significant insights into the design of high performance potassium-ion batteries using hierarchical nanostructures with distinct morphologies.
Introduction
Rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the global energy crisis has urged us to develop sustainable and green energy storage/generation technologies.1 Among the available candidates of choice, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have gained significant attention owing to their high power and energy density, especially in the portable electronic market2,3 which is led by LIBs. However, cost and lithium scarcity has led us to develop alternate chemistries without sacrificing the energy and power density of lithium-ion batteries. The next possible and potential substitutes for LIBs are sodium and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) owing to the natural abundance of the sodium (2.3%) and potassium (1.8%) resources in the Earth's crust and their low cost.4 Significant efforts have been made in the development of novel kinds of electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, electrode materials for KIBs are still largely unexplored5 as the larger radius of the K+ ion hinders its ionic movement into the host materials, resulting in a lack of suitable anode candidates. To date many efforts have been devoted to exploring different kinds of anode materials for KIBs with various mechanisms such as alloying, conversion and intercalation.6–8 However, many of them are hampered by the poor cycle life, low capacity and sluggish charge transfer kinetics.9
Recently, metal sulfides and selenides were explored as successful candidates for LIBs/SIBs because of their superior electronic conductivity and high theoretical capacity.10,11 The advantages of sulfur in metal sulfides are that it provides a mechanical buffering of the volume change during charge/discharge12 and also sulfide formation is more reversible than oxide formation. Owing to the unique physical and chemical properties of metal sulfides, they have been considered as alternative energy storage materials for alkali-ion batteries.13–15 Among the investigated metal sulfides, CuS is considered to be one of the most effective semiconductors and has perspective applications in many areas such as photocatalysts and solar cells.16,17 The covellite CuS possesses a high electrical conductivity (10−3 S cm−1) and high theoretical capacity (560 mA h g−1) and also exhibits flat discharge profiles18 when cycled versus Li/Li+. In addition to these advantages, one of the major drawbacks of using sulfides is the rapid fall in capacity during cycling.19 The drop in capacity is caused by the formation of electrolyte soluble Li2S during the prolonged charge/discharge process which means the cycling stability is the key issue for using CuS as an anode material in alkali-ion batteries.20 Therefore, an effective approach is the construction of novel architectures, in particular the morphological design of anode materials to overcome the key issues and enhance their electrochemical performance for use in alkali-ion batteries. This strategy has been successfully employed in LIBs and SIBs to a certain extent.21–24 Recently morphologically optimized electrode materials demonstrated a superior electrochemical25 and photocatalytic performance.26–28 As the diffusivity of the K+ ion is a significant factor for determining the performance of KIBs, the morphologically oriented design of materials with hierarchical nanostructures is one of the most effective ways to improve the K+ ion kinetics/reactivity, thereby shortening the potassium-ion diffusion path length in order to achieve a high rate capability and cycling stability.29 To date, various morphologies with nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanosheets, nanoroses and nanoclusters have been designed which can effectively overcome the volume expansion and improve the reaction kinetics to a certain extent, especially for sulfur/selenium based electrodes.30 Various hierarchical designs for CuS have been studied such as the double-sandwich structure,21 flower CuS31 and CuS@graphene32,33 for LIBs, SIBs and KIBs. However, a comparative study of various morphologies with nanostructures has not yet been reported to the best of our knowledge, especially for KIBs.
Herein we report the morphologically dependent electrochemical performance of various CuS nanostructures synthesized using a facile hydrothermal technique with the use of different structure directing agents, such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The obtained morphologies of nanospheres and nanoflakes were employed as anode materials for KIBs and their influence on the surface area and electrochemical performance was also investigated. The surface enhanced capacitive storage phenomenon of CuS with various morphologies was investigated in detail and it was found that the potassium storage behavior is highly dependent on the morphology and the high surface area. Hence, this comparative study provides novel insights into the development of the hierarchical design of electrode materials for KIBs.
Materials and methods
All of the chemicals (analytical grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without any further purification.
Synthesis of CuS nanostructures
Various CuS nanostructures were synthesized by using a one-pot hydrothermal method in which CuSO4·5H2O was employed as the source of copper. In a typical synthesis, first 0.06 mol of CuSO4·5H2O was dissolved in distilled water and either 0.1 mmol of CTAB or SDS was dissolved in distilled water separately. Then the two solutions were mixed under vigorous stirring followed by the addition of the thiourea (0.03 mol) solution. After that the mixture was transferred to a Teflon lined autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 24 h. The autoclave was cooled down naturally then the black precipitate was removed from the bottom of the autoclave, washed several times with water followed by ethanol in order to remove the impurities. Thereafter, the black precipitate was dried for 12 h in a hot air oven at 100 °C. Drying was followed by grinding to obtain the CuS nanostructures as a black powder. The same procedure was repeated without the structure directing agent to prepare the CuS. The CuS nanostructures with three types of morphologies (CuS, CuS–C (CTAB added), CuS–S (SDS added)) were comparatively studied for electrochemical performance in KIBs.
Structural characterization
Typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of various CuS nanostructures were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) between 10 and 80° at the scan rate of 5° min−1. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOLJEM 2100) was used to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized materials. The oxidation states of the synthesized nanostructures were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher Scientific Instruments UK) with a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV), and the obtained results were calibrated by reference with C1s at 284.6 eV. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the synthesized nanostructures was investigated using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms which were recorded at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical characterization of the synthesized CuS nanostructures was investigated using CR2032 type coin cells (half-cells). A potassium ingot was used as the reference and counter electrode and Celgard 2400 was used as the separator. 1 M KPF6 was dissolved in a mixture of 1:1 (vol. ratio) ethylene carbonate (EC)–diethyl carbonate (DEC) was employed as the electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared by using the traditional slurry coating method which contains the active material (synthesized CuS nanostructures), Super-P carbon and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF binder) in the weight ratio of 80:10:10. The as-prepared slurry was coated uniformly on the copper foil using an electrode coater and the electrodes were dried at 120 °C overnight. The circular discs of 18 mm diameter were blanked out and used as the working electrode and the cells were assembled in an argon filled glove box (Vigor, China). Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were carried out at room temperature using a NEWARE battery analyzer (China) and a Biologic electrochemical workstation (Biologic SAS, France), respectively. The voltage cut-off window used was between 0.01 and 3 V at different current densities (0.1 to 5 A g−1) and scan rates (0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1) respectively. The electrochemical impedance behavior of the synthesized CuS nanostructures was measured using the Biologic electrochemical workstation (Biologic SAS, France) in which the AC voltage amplitude was 5 mV and the frequency range was between 100 kHz and 5 mHz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a presents the XRD patterns of the CuS, CuS–C and CuS–S nanostructures which were synthesized using the hydrothermal technique and they clearly show the characteristic peaks of CuS i.e., (111), (102), (103), (006), (110), (108), (116) and (208), these can be indexed on the basis of the hexagonal phase (ICDD no. 01-079-2321) with the space group P63/mmc. All three CuS patterns exhibit peaks with different intensities that depends on the crystallinity of the CuS material, the peaks are well matched with the standard patterns which indicates that all three CuS nanostructures are phase pure. The average crystal size of the synthesized CuS nanostructures was calculated using the Scherrer equation:34 D = kλ/βcosθ(1)In which k is the shape factor for which the value is unity, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray used (Cu-Kα = 1.5404 Å), β is the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak in radians and θ is the Bragg diffraction angle. The average crystallite sizes of the hydrothermally synthesized CuS nanostructures are approximately 68, 55 and 18 nm for CuS, CuS–C and CuS–S respectively. No diffraction peak was attributed to impurities such as Cu2S or S, indicating the phase purity of the synthesized samples.

The chemical states of the synthesized CuS–S nanostructure was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and is shown in Fig. 1b. The survey spectrum shows only Cu2p, C1s, O1s and S2p, and no impurities. The Cu 2p XPS spectra depicts two distinct peaks, 955 and 935 eV, corresponding to the Cu2p1/2 and Cu2p3/2 states indicating that Cu is present in the +2 state in the synthesized CuS nanospheres. The presence of shakeup satellite peaks around 943 and 963 eV are evidence of the 9 electrons in the 3d shell which further confirms the oxidation state of Cu is in +2 state. Furthermore, the difference in the spin orbit coupling energy of 20 eV between the Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 states also indicates the Cu2+ oxidation state.35,36 It can be seen that the XPS spectra of S2p is divided into two peaks centered at 162.4 and 163.3 eV corresponding to the S2p3/2 and S2p1/2 states, which is quite consistent with the earlier reports.37 The obtained results confirmed the presence of CuS in the nanostructures.
The surface area of the synthesized nanostructures was successfully investigated using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm analysis and is shown in Fig. 2. All of the CuS nanostructures show a type II isotherm according to IUPAC nomenclature, which is highly indicative of the non-porous nature of the materials and the shape is the result of unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption.38 The nanostructures exhibit a specific surface area of 1.914, 5.85 and 12.45 m2 g−1 for CuS, CuS–C and CuS–S respectively. The introduction of surfactants in the hydrothermal synthesis enhanced the surface area of the CuS nanostructures. This is attributed to the surfactant molecules acting as a protective and stabilizing agent and inducing the formation of nanoparticles with a larger surface area and preventing agglomeration during synthesis.39 In the surfactant assisted synthesis, particle formation involves nucleation, growth, coagulation and flocculation, all of which may be affected significantly by surfactant assemblies. In general, materials that possess a high surface area can offer a better electrode–electrolyte contact area and more potassium-ion diffusion pathways. Moreover, during the intercalation/deintercalation process of potassium, the larger surface area also provides more space to adapt the volume expansion.40 This results in the better electrochemical performance of the CuS–S nanospheres.

Fig. 3 presents the morphologies of different CuS nanostructures as evidenced by the HRTEM images. Fig. 3a depicts the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the CuS nanostructure without the use of the structure directing agent and shows an irregular morphology with a particle size in the range of 10–50 nm (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). On the other hand the CTAB assisted synthesis of CuS (Fig. 3c) shows a flake like morphology with a length of 100–150 nm and a diameter of 5–10 nm (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Moreover, when SDS is used as a structure directing agent, the particles (Fig. 3e) are nanospheres with a size of 10–15 nm (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). In view of the above mentioned observation it might be ascertained that the coordination ability of copper with different structure directing agents is essential to direct the morphology of the CuS nanostructures. Moreover, the particle sizes calculated from Scherrer's equation are comparable to those obtained from the HRTEM analysis. As shown in Fig. S3† the d-spacing of all CuS nanostructures match well with the lattice spacings of 0.27, 0.30 and 0.28 nm for CuS, CuS–C and CuS–S, which correspond to the planes of (103), (102) and (006) respectively. The well-aligned lattice planes of the three different nanostructures indicate the high crystallinity of the samples. Fig. 3b, d, and f depict the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and clearly display distinct ring patterns corresponding to the planes (207), (112) for CuS, (110), (114) for CuS–C and (301), (108) for CuS–S which match well with the hexagonal CuS for all of the nanostructures and indicate the highly crystalline nature of the CuS nanostructures.

In the synthesis of CuS using the hydrothermal route, the surfactants play a major role in determining the morphology of the CuS nanostructures. The blank experiment was carried out without the addition of the structure directing agents, either CTAB or SDS, and leads to agglomerated CuS particles. In general, CuS has a hexagonal crystal symmetry and stacked CuS4–CuS3–CuS4 layers held together by covalent S–S bonds along the [0001] direction.41 According to Wu et al.42 a low concentration of CTAB (0.1 mmol) can rarely affect the growth of inorganic microcrystals. In the present study a concentration of CTAB of 0.1 mmol was used and the introduced Br− ions in CTAB preferentially adsorb onto the CuS nuclei on the crystallographic (10(−1)2) direction, which reduces their surface energy and growth rate. Therefore along the direction of (10(−1)2) significantly more nanoflakes grew from the basal one diagonal directions. When the concentration of CTAB was increased to 0.5 mmol, it formed the minimum energy configuration of spherical micelles which act as a soft template for the inorganic reaction according to Gou et al.43 In this case the surfactant cationic group CTA+ coordinated with the S2− ions owing to the electrostatic interactions and the Cu2+ reacted with the S2− ions to form a CuS nuclei on the surface of the CTAB micelles44 resulting in the formation of thin microflakes after the removal of CTAB.45
In the case of SDS, the hydrophilic head group of the surfactant points out towards the outer surface while the hydrophobic tail group points inward and an electrostatic interaction takes place between the sulfonic groups46 of the SDS and Cu2+ ions and the S2− ions react with the Cu2+ ions to form a CuS nuclei on the surface of the SDS micelles. However, when we move from a cationic surfactant (CTAB) to an anionic surfactant (SDS), the particle size and shape of the CuS particle varies which is attributed to the length of the hydrocarbon tail and the area of the head group. The hydrocarbon tail length and the area of the head group of CTAB are 20.5 Å and 2.20 nm2 respectively, whereas for SDS they are 16.7 Å and 1.07 nm2 respectively.47 If the length of the tail and the area of the head group vary, the geometry and shape of the particles also vary. These may be the factors necessary for obtaining the different morphology of CuS nanostructures.
Potassium-ion storage behavior of the CuS nanostructures
The electrochemical potassium-ion storage performances of all three CuS nanostructures were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge studies. The CV studies of all three nanostructures were carried out between the potential limits 0.01 and 3 V at the scan rate 0.1 mV s−1. The first cycle representative curves for the CuS nanostructures as a result of the electrochemical reactions are shown in Fig. 4. All three nanostructures exhibit similar types of CV curves except for the peak intensities. In the first cathodic scan (potassiation process), three peaks were observed at 1.8, 1.17 and 0.28 V, whereas the corresponding two anodic peaks were located at 1.9 and 2.6 V respectively. This indicates that the potassium intercalation/deintercalation process is not a simple one step conversion reaction. The reduction peak at 1.8 V indicates that the conversion of CuS to the intermediate KxCuS (eqn (2)) and the peak at 1.17 V correspond to the transformation from KxCuS to K2S and Cu (eqn (3)).48 The peak obtained at around 0.28 V indicates the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer however, this peak disappears in the subsequent cycles for the CuS nanostructures (Fig. 4b–d). However, the two reduction and oxidation peaks that appear in the subsequent cycles indicate that the reactions are highly reversible. CuS + xK+ + xe− ↔ KxCuS(2) KxCuS + (2 − x)K+ + (2 − x)e− ↔ K2S + Cu(3)

In the anodic scan the obtained peaks are indicative of the reversible process of the cathodic reaction. Moreover, the shapes of the oxidation and reduction peaks are well maintained, which indicates that the electrode reactions are highly reversible in the second cycle onwards.
The morphological dependence of the electrochemical behavior of the CuS nanostructures were further investigated using the galvanostatic charge/discharge behavior. The CuS nanostructures were investigated between the potential limits of 0.01 and 3 V at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Three sloping potential regions ranging from 2.3–1.7, 1.4–0.8 and 0.4–0.2 V were observed in the first discharge curve for all three nanostructures. These indicate that a multistep reduction process of CuS occurs during the potassium intercalation reaction as indicated by eqn (1) and (2), as well as the decomposition of the electrolyte solvents and the formation of a SEI layer. The obtained sloping potential region of the CuS nanostructures corroborated well with the CV results. The first cycle discharge capacities were found to be 744, 812 and 934 mA h g−1, whereas the charge capacities were 383, 410 and 465 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 for CuS, CuS–C and CuS–S respectively. The corresponding coulombic efficiencies were 48, 49 and 50.2% respectively, which indicates that all three CuS nanostructures exhibit large irreversible capacities in the first cycle which is significant for intercalation type anodes.49 The large irreversible capacity is attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte solvents to form the SEI layer in which more potassium ions are trapped in the SEI layer. The charge/discharge capacity of the CuS–S electrode is larger compared to the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures which is attributed to the high surface area of the CuS–S nanospheres which favors electrochemical reaction kinetics during cycling.
The ex situ XRD patterns (Fig. 5b) at various charge/discharge potentials gave further insights into the reaction mechanism and the phase transformation of the CuS electrode during the charge/discharge process. In the discharge process when the discharge voltage is reduced to 1.8 V, there is a progressive reduction of the CuS peaks at 2θ values of 31.8 and 47.9° and new peaks are observed at 18.5 and 29.7° which could be assigned to the intermediate KxCuS phase (eqn (2)). The discharge voltage is further reduced to 1.23 V, new peaks are obtained at 2θ values of 33.2, 46 and 50.02° which could be assigned to the K2S and Cu phase according to eqn (3). When the charging potential reaches 1.9 V the intermediate phase KxCuS forms and upon further charging to 3 V new peaks are observed at 2θ values of 29.4, 31.9 and 48.02° which corroborate the formation of the CuS phase.48 A close examination of the ex situ XRD patterns further confirmed that no other phase formation occurred during the potassium intercalation and deintercalation process for CuS.

The cycle performance of the different nanostructured CuS electrodes at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 were evaluated and are shown in Fig. 5c. It was observed that the CuS–S nanospheres electrode exhibited a better cycling stability than the CuS–C and CuS electrodes. The obtained charge capacities of 451, 401 and 363 mA h g−1 were observed for the CuS–S, CuS–C and CuS nanostructures in the first cycle, whereas the 500th cycle capacities were 331, 146 and 66 mA h g−1 with capacity retentions of 73.3, 36.5 and 18.1%. The initial losses in the first irreversible capacity, as well as the efficiency, are attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte solvents on the electrode surface and lead to the formation of a SEI layer and the irreversible trapping of K+ in the sulfide lattice. Afterwards, the charge and discharge capacities were overlapped, indicating that the contact between the electrode and electrolyte improved significantly and the stable SEI layer. The first cycle coulombic efficiencies were approximately 48–50% for all three nanostructures, however, it was further increased in the subsequent cycles and was maintained at more than 99.99% for up to 500 cycles. The capacities of the electrode constructed with the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures fade much faster than those of CuS–S. During the charge/discharge steps the volume expansion and contraction leads to the loss of electronic continuity upon the breakdown of the particles and results in a major capacity loss in the disordered nanoflakes (CuS–C) and irregular morphological CuS nanostructures.50 On the other hand, the CuS–S nanospheres offer a short diffusion path length for potassium ion intercalation/deintercalation and accommodate the strain developed during cycling, and therefore overcome the capacity loss upon cycling.51
The rate capabilities of various CuS nanostructures were evaluated at different current densities from 0.1 to 5 A g−1 and are illustrated in Fig. 5d. Among the investigated CuS nanostructures, the CuS–S electrode shows a better performance than the CuS–C and CuS electrodes. The obtained charge capacities were 469, 451, 408, 382, 353 and 112 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1 respectively. These values are higher than the capacities obtained for the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures. The current density was raised to 5 A g−1 and the charge capacity obtained for the CuS–S electrode was 112 mA h g−1, which is much higher than those of 94 mA h g−1 (for CuS–C) and 78 mA h g−1 (for CuS). Interestingly the cell was cycled back to 0.1 A g−1 and the original capacity of 461 mA h g−1 was retained for CuS–S, whereas the CuS–C (408 mA h g−1) and CuS (379 mA h g−1) electrode delivered a reduced capacity compared to the capacities obtained in the first cycle. In contrast to the CuS–S electrode, the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures exhibit an average electrochemical performance which can be attributed to the lack of ordering of the nanoparticles that leads to agglomeration during cycling and which hinders the potassium ion intercalation/deintercalation.52 In addition to that, the interparticle contact resistance might have raised the sluggish potassium ion diffusion results for both the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures. In order to investigate the stability and morphology of the CuS–S electrode after 500 cycles we carried out ex situ XRD (Fig. 5e) and HRTEM imaging (Fig. 5f) after 500 cycles. In comparison to the original morphology of the CuS–S nanospheres no noticeable change occurred after 500 cycles except they became a little hazy on the surface of the spheres, which may be caused by the binder and the conductive carbon used for the electrode coating. The SAED pattern shown as an inset in Fig. 5f reveals that the nanostructure of the CuS–S nanospheres retains a crystalline nature after 500 cycles of charge–discharge. The obtained results established that the CuS–S nanospheres can maintain their structural and morphological integrity after cycling without serious particle cracking which helps to achieve a better cycling stability than the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures. The obtained capacity, cycling performance and rate capability for the CuS–S nanospheres were superior and comparable to those of the lithium/sodium storage capability of the CuS nanostructures18,19,21,31–33,48,49,53–55 (Table S1†).
In the case of the nanoscale materials, a considerable amount of K+ storage occurs on the surface of the active materials along with K+ storage via faradaic processes. The spherical and flake like nanoscale morphology of the CuS–S nanostructures have a high surface area and exhibit a high potassium storage capability. To investigate the effects of the morphology and surface area on the K+ storage properties in the nanoscale materials, the intercalation and capacitive contribution to total capacity were characterized using CV curves at various scan rates. The K ion transportation kinetics were determined using the relationship between the current (i) and the scan rate (ν) using the following equation: log(i) = loga + blogν(4)In which i is the current in mA, ν is the scan rate in mV s−1, and a and b are adjustable parameters. The slope of log(|i|) versus log(ν) gives the value of the b exponent which provides information about whether the electrochemical reaction kinetics are controlled by a faradaic process or non-faradaic process. For example, if the value of b equals 0.5 the electrochemical reaction kinetics are solely controlled by a faradaic process such as the diffusion-controlled intercalation reaction, conversion, or alloying reactions, but if the value of b equals 1 this indicates that the kinetics are controlled by surface-limited pseudocapacitance.56Fig. 6a, c, and e shows the CV curves of the CuS, CuS–C and CuS–S nanostructures at various scan rates from 0.2 to 1.2 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 6b, d, and f the ‘b’ values of C1, C2, A1 and A2 are less than 0.5 for CuS and CuS–C whereas they are greater than 0.5 for the CuS–S nanospheres. This indicates that the anodic and cathodic reactions of CuS and CuS–C are dominated by a diffusion controlled intercalation reaction, whereas the redox reactions of the CuS–S nanospheres are controlled by the combined behavior of the surface-dominated pseudocapacitive and intercalation reactions. In particular the ‘b’ values of C1 (0.69), C2 (0.71), A1 (0.72), A2 (0.68) for the CuS–S nanospheres are higher than CuS and CuS–C, suggesting that there is more surface K+ storage in the CuS nanospheres. The contribution of the diffusion controlled-intercalation and the surface-limited reactions are quantitatively obtained using the eqn (5), in which the current response (i) at a fixed voltage (V) is the combination of the diffusion-controlled intercalation effect (k2ν1/2) and the capacitive effect (k1ν). i = k1ν + k2ν1/2(5)In which k1 and k2 are the constants, i is the current (A) at a given potential, and ν is the scan rate (mV s−1). The values of k1 and k2 are obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot of i(ν)/ν1/2versus ν1/2. The capacitive contribution k1ν can be easily separated from the measured total current according to the value of k2. The quantitative contribution of the capacitive and diffusion controlled reactions are shown in the bar graph in Fig. 7a. In all three CuS nanostructures the diffusion controlled intercalation behavior dominates in the CuS and CuS–C nanostructures, whereas surface K+ ion storage is dominant in the CuS–S nanospheres. The normalized capacitive contribution of the CuS–S nanospheres is 64.6% at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 7b. The capacitive contributions of the CuS–S nanospheres are 37.3, 43.4, 50.8, 57.4 and 64.6% for 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 7c. As the scan rate increases from 0.2 to 1 mV s−1, the role of the capacitive contribution increases and reaches a maximum at the scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1. As a result of the spherical morphology with an enhanced surface area, the CuS–S nanospheres exhibit the maximum capacitive contribution in the overall capacity compared to a flake like morphology. The kinetic analysis of the CuS nanostructures successfully verifies the K-ion storage process is mainly attributed to the surface dominated capacitive mechanism in the CuS–S nanospheres, whereas the diffusion controlled intercalation plays a major role in the CuS and CuS–C nanostructures.

Fig. 7d depicts the impedance characteristics of the different CuS nanostructures obtained from EIS analysis as shown in the Nyquist plot. At low frequency the EIS spectra comprises a sloping line, whereas at a high frequency the spectra show a semicircle. The corresponding equivalent circuit and fitted plots are shown as insets in Fig. 7d and S4† respectively, in which Rs, Rct, Cdl and W are the electrolyte resistance, charge transfer resistance, double layer capacitance and Warburg resistance associated with the K+ ion diffusion in the electrode respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 7d there is a significant difference in the Rs (CuS 34 Ω; CuS–C 72 Ω; CuS–S 27 Ω) and Rct (CuS 146 Ω; CuS–C 275 Ω; CuS–S 115 Ω) of all the CuS nanostructures. The diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot of the CuS–S nanospheres is lower than that of the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures, indicating that the charge transfer resistance between the electrode/electrolyte interface of the CuS–S nanospheres is considerably smaller than that of the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures. The K+ ion diffusion coefficient is evaluated from the following equation. (6)In which DK+ represents the K+ ion diffusion coefficient, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature respectively. C, F, n and A refer to the concentration of K+ ions, the Faraday constant, the number of electrons transferred per molecule in the electrochemical reaction and the area of the electrode respectively. The intersection of the straight line on the real axis57 gives the value of σ (Warburg coefficient) which is equal to (Rs + Rct − 2σ2Cdl). The K+ ion diffusion coefficient of the CuS–S nanospheres is 3.12 × 10−13 cm2 s−1. It is one order higher than that of the CuS–C nanoflakes (1.68 × 10−14 cm2 s−1) and two orders greater than that of the CuS nanostructures (1.28 × 10−15 cm2 s−1). The greater K+ ion diffusion coefficient of the CuS–S nanospheres indicates the good electrochemical reaction kinetics of the nanosphere morphology. Hence, the CuS–S nanosphere morphology with a smaller size is favorable for the shortened diffusion path length as compared to the CuS–C nanoflakes and CuS nanostructures. The nanospheres have a size ranging from 5–15 nm, which is sufficient to shorten the diffusion length of the K+ ion transfer and buffer the volume expansion during cycling.
On the basis of the experimental observations and results, the high specific capacity and the cycling stability with a superior rate capability are attributed to the spherical morphology and the smaller particle size. However, the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures also exhibit a moderate electrochemical performance. The superior electrochemical performance of the CuS–S nanostructures also indicates that morphology is an essential controlling factor for enhanced electrochemical reaction kinetics. The hydrothermally synthesized CuS–S nanospheres have sizes ranging from 5–15 nm as evidenced by the HRTEM images. According to earlier reports,58–60 the nanospheres with a smaller size exhibit a superior performance owing to the high surface-to-volume ratio which in turn related to the surface electrochemical activity of the material. Moreover, the high specific capacity and superior rate capability and cycling stability are attributed to the following reasons. CuS–S nanospheres have a smaller size and offer an increased specific surface area to form more active sites, and improve the electrolyte accessibility which can provide more surface storage of K+ and results in surface enhanced pseudocpacitance61 along with faradaic storage of K+. Moreover, the spherical morphology enlarges the electrode/electrolyte contact area thereby decreasing the diffusion distances and thus allows fast ion/electron transportation. This leads to favorable intercalation and deintercalation of K+ within the electrolyte and results in an enhanced capacity and cycling stability, especially at a high current density. The specific surface area according to the BET adsorption–desorption isotherm of all three CuS nanostructures ranges from 1–13 m2 g−1. The specific surface area of CuS (1.914 m2 g−1) without a surfactant is much lower as compared the CuS–C nanoflakes (5.85 m2 g−1) which in turn lower than the CuS–S nanospheres (12.45 m2 g−1), and hence CuS–S is expected to perform well. The reason for the decreased surface area of the CuS–C nanoflakes and the CuS nanostructures is attributed to the improperly ordered close stacking of the flakes in CuS–C and the irregular morphology of the CuS nanostructures. Therefore, in reality the nanospherical morphology is one of the factors for the enhanced electrochemical behavior and evidently the morphologically oriented electrochemical reaction kinetics. Here we have to consider another important factor is the crystallite size of the nanostructures, which is calculated from the Scherrer equation (CuS–S 18 nm, CuS–C 55 nm, CuS 68 nm). A smaller crystallite size62 also plays a major role along with the morphology dependent electrochemical behavior, which is why CuS–S nanospheres outperform their counterparts. The poor performance of the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures is evident from the high Rct as well as the lowest value for the diffusion of the K+ ion which probably hampers the potassium-ion diffusion into the SEI layer. Moreover, the charge/discharge capacities of the CuS–C and CuS nanostructures also decreased rapidly with an increase in the cycle number. The reason for the weak performance may be attributed to the irregularly organized nanoflakes and particles that results in the poor interaction of the electrode/electrolyte, as well as an increased diffusion distance. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the CuS–S based electrode evidently demonstrates the benefits of the morphology dependent spherical nanostructures over the other nanostructured morphologies of the CuS nanostructures.
Conclusion
In summary, this work presents the systematic comparative analysis of CuS nanostructures with different morphologies for applications in KIBs. The facile hydrothermal approach is adapted to prepare different CuS nanostructures such as the nanospheres and nanoflakes, in which SDS and CTAB are employed as structure directing agents respectively. The morphology dependent electrochemical behavior is systematically investigated on the basis of the specific capacity, cycling stability, rate capability, ex situ XRD and HRTEM analysis, EIS characteristics and the diffusion coefficient. The CuS–S nanospheres demonstrated an outstanding electrochemical performance whereas the CuS–C nanoflakes and CuS nanostructures show a moderate electrochemical behavior. The CuS–S nanosphere delivered an excellent reversible capacity of 451 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and retains 73% of the initial reversible capacity after 500 cycles. It shows a remarkable rate capability which delivers 112 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 5 A g−1 (5000 mA g−1). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the CuS–S nanospheres is attributed to the small size and the spherical morphology, which offer a high surface area and provides favorable K+ ion diffusivity and enhanced surface K+ storage over the diffusion-controlled intercalation reaction. This strategy provides further insights into enhancing the energy density and power density of potassium-ion batteries for high rate applications. The above obtained results may accelerate further development of KIBs by the use of smart nanoscale materials.
