    , Accepted 22nd March 2021First published on 8th April 2021AbstractAs a key factor for fast-charging lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), high-rate anode materials that can recharge in a few minutes have aroused increasing attention. However, high-rate performance is always accompanied by low theoretical capacities, such as the widely known high-rate electrode of Li4Ti5O12 (175 mA h g−1), which severely limits its large-scale implementation in the development of high power density LIBs. Here, we report a modified close-spaced thermal evaporation process to deposit 3D-structured Sb2Se3 films (3D-SSF) with tunable morphology as an additive-free anode for LIBs. After a high-rate activation process, 3D-SSF exhibits a flatter discharge plateau than the reported results and could deliver a high capacity of 471 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh current density of 21 440 mA g−1, which is superior to the widely known high-rate Li4Ti5O12 anode (over 150 mA h g−1 at 8750 mA g−1). Moreover, we reveal a current-regulated Li-ion storage mechanism where 3D-SFF undergoes a synergistic conversion and alloying reaction at low current densities, while an alloying reaction-dominated process at high rates. Beyond that, full batteries with excellent rate performance were successfully assembled by pairing with homemade LiFePO4 (LFP) as the cathode.
1. Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with a higher energy density and that are capable of fast charging are required to meet the increasingly high demands of portable devices and electric vehicles. However, the restricted rate performance and low specific capacity (372 mA h g−1) of commercial graphite anodes have limited their further development. On the other hand, Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) has been well studied for its great rate performance brought by the unique lithium insertion/extraction mechanism, but it has a low specific capacity of 175 mA h g−1, which severely limits its large-scale implementation in the development of high energy density LIBs.1–3 Sb2Se3, as an attractive anode material based on the conversion and alloying reaction mechanism, can deliver a much higher capacity up to 670 mA h g−1 and exhibit some other favorable characteristics including Earth-abundant constituents, and great tolerance to high temperatures and bending.4–8 Nevertheless, Sb2Se3 in practice experiences large volume changes during the discharge/charge process, resulting in pulverization, active material loss, and rapid capacity degradation.
In this case, extensive efforts have been devoted to explore and optimize lithium and sodium storage properties of Sb2Se3. In these works, typical strategies used are combining Sb2Se3 with carbon-based materials, such as carbon,4 polypyrrole,9 and rGO10,11 to enhance the conductivity of the electrode and relieve volume expansion during the Li+/Na+ insertion. The anodes are assembled by casting the mixture of Sb2Se3 composites, conductive additives, and binders on current collectors. Therefore, the incorporation of carbon-based materials and additives led to a low content of Sb2Se3 (mass ratio <70%) in the whole electrode, which would inevitably degenerate the actual specific capacity of the electrode.12,13 Besides, the addition of non-conductive binders further increases the internal resistance of the electrode, resulting in poor electronic conductivity during cycling.14 Ideally, using a thin film deposition process to directly deposit electrode films on current collectors as an additive-free anode can efficiently resolve the drawbacks above.15 In the meantime, the thin-film electrode can also be employed for thin-film microbatteries,16 which have been considered to be the ideal energy supply for microchips, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and implantable medical devices.17–19 Fu et al. adopted pulsed laser deposition (PLD) to prepare Sb2Se3 thin film anodes for LIBs,20,21 whereas the capacity degenerated significantly after 100 cycles at a low current of 5 μA cm−2. Beyond that, Sb2Se3-based thin film anodes have been barely reported. Based on the above discussion, there still exists an urgent need to prepare additive-free thin-film Sb2Se3 anodes with great lithium-storage performance through a thin film deposition method.16
Herein, through a modified close-spaced rapid thermal evaporation process, 3D structured Sb2Se3 films (3D-SSFs) were successfully prepared on a flexible substrate and these functioned as additive-free anodes. The morphology can be controllably regulated by tuning the evaporation temperature in a narrow range (550–560 °C) and the fabrication process can be completed in under 0.2 hours, which is far less than the time taken for the fabrication process of other previously reported Sb2Se3-based electrodes (Fig. S1†). Compared with the traditional casting-derived method, the as-prepared electrode has a 100% Sb2Se3 content. As a result, it exhibits a flat voltage plateau and a stable cycling performance with a capacity of 544 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 3C (2010 mA g−1), and especially, a high capacity up to 473 mA h g−1 at an extremely high current density of 32C (21 440 mA g−1). Such results exceed those reported for the previously reported Sb2Se3-based anodes or even the well-known high-rate LTO anode (over 150 mA h g−1 at 8750 mA g−1). Moreover, a unique current-regulated Li+ insertion/extraction mechanism was revealed to understand the excellent rate performance of 3D-SSFs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Material synthesis
The additive-free Sb2Se3 anodes were fabricated by a modified close-spaced rapid thermal evaporation method as illustrated in Fig. S2.† Typically, flexible titanium (Ti) foils (0.05 mm thick, 99.9% purity) were thoroughly cleaned and placed in a tube furnace (OTF-1200X-RTP, MTI, Hefei, China) as a substrate. Sb2Se3 powders were evenly sprinkled under the Ti foil as the evaporation source. The deposition process began after the air pressure inside the tube furnace was less than 0.8 Pa. First, the furnace was heated to 100 °C and held for 300 s to stabilize the temperature and pressure, and then the temperature was increased to 555 °C in 53 s and held for 170 s. After that, the heat source was turned off and the samples were taken out when the temperature in the furnace was cooled naturally to 150 °C. Besides, samples with different surface morphologies could be prepared by tuning the evaporation temperatures. The samples with 2D grains and large flaky structures were prepared at evaporation temperatures of 550 °C and 560 °C, respectively.
2.2 Material characterization
The Raman spectrum was recorded using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope with an excitation laser of 532 nm wavelength. The crystal structures of the Sb2Se3 electrodes were characterized using an X-ray diffraction system (Rigaku, Cu Kα, λ = 1.54 Å). The morphologies of the electrodes were obtained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Helios G4 CX), and the composition of the electrodes was determined using an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX) attached to the same instrument. In addition, the cross-section of the sample was obtained by cutting using an ion beam milling system (Leica EM TIC 3X).
2.3 Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical characterization was performed by using a CR-2032 coin-type cell, which was assembled in a glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm and O2 < 0.1 ppm) with Sb2Se3 as the working electrode and lithium foil as the counter and reference electrodes. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate (EC/DMC/EMC, 1:1:1 in vol%) containing 5.0 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The LFP cathode was prepared of a mixture of LFP powder, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and super P (8:1:1 by mass) on aluminum foils. The capacity ratio of the cathode/anode was controlled approximately at 1:1.05. The average mass loading of LiFePO4 in the electrode was around 2.8 mg cm−2. The as-prepared full cells were first activated for 6 cycles at 0.3C (81 mA g−1). The cycling performance, rate performance, and galvanostatic discharge–charge measurements were carried out using a multichannel battery tester (Neware, BTS-4000). For the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests, a titration current at a current density of 0.2C (134 mA g−1) was applied for 10 min, followed by a relaxation time of 60 min. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were implemented using an electrochemical workstation (Biologic, SP-200).
3. Results and discussion
The plane-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the 3D-SSF grown at 555 °C are presented in Fig. 1a and b, from which one can visibly find that 3D-SSF is composed of in situ grown, closely arranged columnar and lamellar Sb2Se3 grains. Such a structure could not only increase the surface area and accommodate volume expansion, but also ensure structural stability and good contact with current collectors during cycling.22 As seen from the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1c), the 4 μm-thick 3D-SSF has a dense Sb2Se3 film with a thickness of ∼0.6 μm at the bottom and loose 3D-structured grains at the top that are interconnected with each other, which matches well with the top view SEM images. Benefitting from the flexibility of 0.05 mm-thick Ti foil, the 3D-SSF could withstand a certain extent of bending as well (inset in Fig. 1d). The Raman spectrum of the 3D-SSF is presented in Fig. 1d. The peaks located at 123, 152, 189, 210, and 252 cm−1 are denoted as the typical vibration band of crystalline Sb2Se3, and the XRD pattern as shown in Fig. 1e is well-indexed to JCPDS card no. 75-1642. Simultaneously, no other crystalline phases are observed, indicating that the 3D-SSF is composed of Sb2Se3 crystals and contains no other impurities. EDS analysis shown in Fig. 1f further indicates that the atomic ratio of Sb:Se is 2:2.81, which is in good agreement with the formula of Sb2Se3. The slightly higher Sb ratio might be attributed to the partial decomposition of Sb2Se3 and the larger vapor pressure of Se, which led to the loss of Se content during the evaporation process.23,24 Besides, the surface morphologies of Sb2Se3 films vary significantly when the evaporation temperature deviates slightly from 555 °C to 550 °C or 560 °C. Fig. S3a, c and S3b, d† present the plane-view SEM images of the samples grown at 550 °C (sample-550) and 560 °C (sample-560), respectively. It can be seen that sample-550 exhibits densely arranged grains with a diameter of less than 1 μm, while sample-560 has a much looser and irregular structure containing needle-like grains and flaky grains with a diameter larger than 2 μm.

The electrochemical performance of the 3D-SSF was evaluated using the coin-type cell. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was first employed to investigate the Li+ insertion and extraction process of the 3D-SSF.
As displayed in Fig. 2a, the CV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 in a potential range of 0.01–3.0 V. In the first cathodic scan, two distinct peaks at around 1.32 V and 0.8 V were ascribed to the reduction of Sb3+ into Sb0 and alloying reaction of Sb with Li+, respectively. In addition, a small peak at 1.5 V was observed, which was probably ascribed to the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.10,25 In the first anodic scan, the two peaks located around 1.07 V and 2 V were ascribed to the dealloying reaction of Li3Sb and the formation of Sb2Se3, respectively. Besides, the positions of the main peaks remained nearly unchanged in the subsequent cycles, elucidating that 3D-SSFs exhibit a high electrochemical repeatability. Therefore, the main reaction mechanism between Li+ and Sb2Se3 can be described as eqn (1) and (2).4,5,26,27 Conversion: Sb2Se3 + 6Li+ + 6e− ↔ 2Sb + 3Li2Se.(1) Alloying: 2Sb + 6Li+ + 6e− ↔ 2Li3Sb.(2)

Fig. 2b shows the galvanostatic discharge–charge voltage profiles of the 3D-SSF anode at different cycles at 3C under a voltage window from 0.01 to 3.0 V. The initial discharge curve exhibits two overt voltage plateaus at approximately 1.35 V and 0.8 V, which correspond to the reduction of Sb3+ and the alloying reaction, respectively. The relatively low initial coulombic efficiency could be associated with the formation of the irreversible SEI layer.28 The charge capacity substantially increased from 350.4 mA h g−1 to 572.9 mA h g−1 after the first 15 cycles, indicating that a significant activation process has occurred in the electrode, which has also been reported in other metal chalcogenides such as Sb2S329 and Cu4SnS4.30 Two well overlapped curves are observed for the 50th and 100th cycles, respectively, suggesting the great electrochemical stability of the 3D-SSF. Moreover, the 3D-SSF exhibits a much more stable discharge plateau at around 0.8 V in comparison with the reported Sb2Se3-based anodes,4,5,28,31–34 where a stable plateau is considered a crucial characteristic in the practical application of anode materials. As shown in Fig. 2c, the 3D-SSF could deliver a high capacity of around 288 mA h g−1 in a narrow voltage range of 0.2 V in the 50th cycle, while capacity was lower than 175 mA h g−1 for other reported Sb2Se3-based anodes. Fig. 2d presents the subsequent cycling measurement of the 3D-SSF anode at a high current density of 3C (2010 mA g−1). A high discharge specific capacity of 544 mA h g−1 was still retained after 200 cycles, suggesting the high structural stability of the 3D-SSF anode.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to further investigate the activation process of the 3D-SSF. Fig. 3a presents the typical Nyquist plots of the anode after the 1st and 15th cycle at a current density of 3C. The resistance value of the two curves was derived by fitting to an equivalent electrical circuit model.14 As shown in Table S1,† the ohmic resistance (Ro) of the sample remained unchanged, while the interfacial resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) after 15 cycles remarkably decreased from 48.8 Ω and 106 Ω to 6.95 Ω and 63.07 Ω, respectively, indicating enhanced electron and Li+ transport conductance of the sample after the activation process.35 Besides, the diffusion coefficient (D) of Li+ in the electrode was estimated by the EIS results. Fig. 3b shows the fitting lines of the real part of resistance (Z′) versus the inverse square root of angular frequency (ω−1/2) in the low-frequency region, where the slope of the line is deemed as the Warburg impedance coefficient (σ).36σ is inversely proportional to D based on the following equation: D = R2T2/2A2n2F4C2σ2,(3)where R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, A is the electrode area, F is the Faraday constant, C is the molar concentration of Li+, and n is defined as the molar amount of charge transferred in the reaction.36 Except for D and σ, all the parameters above are kept constant in this measurement. As shown in Fig. 3b, the 3D-SSF exhibited a smaller σ after 15 cycles compared with the first cycle (435.7 Ω s−1vs. 660.8 Ω s−1), suggesting a higher D, and promoted Li+ kinetics brought by the activation process as well. Fig. 3c presents the galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of the 3D-SSF from the 2nd cycle to the 15th cycle. The corresponding capacity contribution of the conversion and alloying processes evenly increased from 170 to 240 mA h g−1 and 249 to 342 mA h g−1, respectively, indicating that more Sb2Se3 could participate in the reaction after the activation process. The SEM images (Fig. 3d) further confirm that the 3D structure of the 3D-SSF was maintained very well and some deep cracks associated with the volume change during the Li insertion/extraction appeared in the film.37,38 These cracks may increase the contact area between the electrolyte and 3D-SSF and thereby enhance the Li+ diffusion of the electrode to some extent.30

Rate performance is a pivotal parameter to evaluate the fast charging capability of the electrodes. To avoid the interference of the capacity increase, the 3D-SSF anode was first activated for 15 cycles before the rate test (Fig. S4†). As shown in Fig. 4a, the 3D-SSF delivered a high discharge capacity of 654, 616, 585, 557, 534, and 507 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16C, respectively. A specific capacity of 473 mA h g−1 was obtained even at an ultrahigh current density of 32C (21 440 mA g−1). When the current density goes back to 0.5C, the capacity was fully recovered to 671 mA h g−1. Fig. 4b compares the rate performance of the 3D-SSF anode with those of other Sb2Se3-based anodes for LIBs from the previous literature, indicating that it exhibits an unprecedented performance in comparison with the reported results.1,5,28,31–34,39,40 There is no reported Sb2Se3-based anode that can function at a high current density exceeding 5 A g−1. Besides, the 3D-SSF also presents more than twice the capacity and a comparable rate performance with the high-rate Li4Ti5O12 and Nb18W16O93 anodes reported before. It is worth mentioning that all the other Sb2Se3-based anodes listed were prepared by chemical methods. This work demonstrates for the first time that Sb2Se3 prepared by a physical method can achieve high lithium storage performance.

The discharge–charge curves at different rates and the capacity contribution measured from different voltage windows are shown in Fig. 4c and Table 1, respectively. Interestingly, it can be seen that the first discharge plateaus (around 1.35 V) ascribed to the formation of Sb and Li2Se shorten with the increase of the current density, while the second discharge plateaus (around 0.8 V) related to the formation of Li3Sb remain the same. This phenomenon suggests that the alloying reaction of Sb provides most of the capacity at high rates (∼68.2% at 16C and ∼74.2% at 32C). However, considering that the Sb for the alloying reaction (eqn (2)) originated from the conversion reaction (eqn (1)), the ratio of capacity contribution from the two plateaus should be around 1:1 theoretically, which is inconsistent with the results above. Therefore, detailed investigations are conducted to explain this abnormal phenomenon. Fig. 4d presents the charge and discharge curves of the 3D-SSF when the current density increased from 1C to 2C. One can see that the capacity loss first occurred in the voltage range of 0.95–3 V (related to the reversible conversion reaction and marked as a green area) during the first charging process (26th-2C charging) rather than the discharging process (25th-2C discharging) at 2C. This result indicates that the reversibility of the reversible conversion reaction is partially hindered, which means part of the Li2Se could not participate in the reaction to form Sb2Se3 according to eqn (2). Meanwhile, Sb generated from the first 2C discharging process (26th-2C discharging) can still alloy with Li+ reversibly at high rates without a conversion reaction. Similar results were observed for other high current densities (Fig. S5a–d†). More importantly, the temporarily irreversible part at high current densities could recover activity again at low current densities. As shown in Fig. S5e,† the capacity of the conversion reaction was fully recovered after the first 0.5C charging and following cycles.

Since the reversibility of the reaction is closely related to the Li-ion diffusion process, we adopted the GITT to characterize the diffusion kinetics of the two voltage plateaus (Fig. S6a†). The diffusion coefficient (D) of the Li ions can be defined by the following equation: (4)
Here, τ is the relaxation time, and nm and Vm are the molar quantity and molar volume of the active materials of the electrode, respectively. A is the electrode area, and ΔEs and ΔEt are the voltage change during the current pulse and relaxation, respectively.41 Considering that nm, Vm, and A remain constant during the test, the diffusion coefficient is proportional to (ΔEs/ΔEt)2. As shown in Fig. 4e, the value of (ΔEs/ΔEt)2 drops sharply when the charging voltage exceeds 1.5 V, indicating lower Li-ion diffusion kinetics at 1.5–3 V corresponding to the reversible conversion reaction. In the meantime, the value of (ΔEs/ΔEt)2 exhibits no obvious difference in the two voltage plateaus during the discharge (Fig. S6b†). Therefore, the dealloying reaction of Li3Sb exhibits faster reaction kinetics than the reversible conversion reaction, which might be associated with the fast electron and ion transport speeds in the composite of Sb and Li2Se. Based on the above discussion, the Li-ion storage process for the 3D-SSF could be described as a current-regulated mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 4f.
Additionally, to evaluate the practical application and the rate performance of the 3D-SSF anode, full cells were assembled using homemade LiFePO4 (LFP) as cathodes. Fig. 5a displays the rate performance of the LFP//3D-SSF full cell in a voltage range of 0.8–3.3 V. The full cell could deliver a reversible capacity of 116 mA h g−1 and 58.1 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and 8C, respectively, and a capacity of 121.31 mA h g−1 (0.34 mA h cm−2) was retained when the current density goes back to 0.5C. Fig. 5b presents the charge/discharge curves of the LFP//3D-SSF full cell at various current densities. The curves exhibit a flat charge/discharge plateau around 2.6 V, coinciding well with the 3D-SSF half cells. Beyond that, a pouch cell with an effective area of ∼16 cm2 using LFP as the cathode and the 3D-SSF as the anode was assembled as well. The LFP//3D-SSF pouch cell could easily drive a light-emitting diode (LED) and maintain the performance under both flat and bending states (Fig. 6c).

The enhanced rate performance also could be attributed to the structural merits of the as-prepared electrode. Fig. 6 illustrates the difference in lithium storage between conventional coated electrodes and the 3D-SSF. For conventional coated electrodes, Sb2Se3 is incorporated with conductive additives and binders to form an electrode, which resulted in a low mass ratio of active materials and thus compromised the capacity advantages of Sb2Se3. Meanwhile, the discontinuous material structure is easily destroyed by the large volume variation during cycling, leading to a degeneration of electron transport.42,43 In contrast, the as-prepared 3D-SSF anode is composed of Sb2Se3 grains grown directly from bottom to top, ensuring a 100% active material content and a direct charge transport path. Additionally, the 3D structure is not easily affected by volume changes during cycling, offering sustainable electron transport and higher structural stability of the electrode.44,45
4. Conclusions
In summary, 3D Sb2Se3 films with controllable morphologies were successfully fabricated through a modified close-spaced rapid thermal evaporation process. Using as an additive-free LIB anode, 3D-SSFs can deliver a flat discharge plateau and a large capacity of 471 mA h g−1 at an ultra-high current density of 32C. The enhanced lithium storage performance is mainly due to the high active material content and great electron transport brought by the additive-free electrode structure. Moreover, we found that a high-rate activation process could facilitate the electron and ion transport in the electrode. Beyond that, a current-regulated Li-ion storage mechanism has been found for better understanding the rate performance of the 3D-SSF. Consequently, this work not only provides a new fabrication strategy for preparing high-performance anodes which are compatible with the integrated circuit process, but also gives new insights into high-rate lithium storage for Sb2Se3-based anodes.
