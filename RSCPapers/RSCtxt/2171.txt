    , Accepted 1st May 2018First published on 2nd May 2018AbstractBiVO4 is a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical water splitting, but its actual activity is hindered by the high energy surface states. Here, we report that In3+ can be used as a dopant to substitute the partial sites of Bi3+ in BiVO4 for modifying the surface states and improving the water oxidation activity of a BiVO4 nanoflake film. Among the In3+-doped BiVO4 film photoanodes, the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film shows optimal photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity. At 1.23 V vs. RHE, the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 1.56 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4, which is over 200% greater than that of the undoped BiVO4 photoanode. In3+-doping did not change the morphology, phase and band gap of BiVO4 obviously, but resulted in a positive shift of the flat band position and higher surface charge separation efficiency for water oxidation. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the surface energy of BiVO4 decreased after In3+-doping that involved more unsaturated electrons of the Bi atom in the Bi–O bonds, thus reducing the amount of exposed unsaturated Bi atoms and broken Bi–O bonds. Therefore, the enhanced water oxidation activity on the In3+-doped BiVO4 photoanode can be ascribed to In3+-doping that passivated the surface states of BiVO4 and thus inhibited the surface charge recombination.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been considered a sustainable approach to produce hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) via capturing and utilizing abundant solar energy.1,2 It is generally accepted that the four-electron water-oxidation half-cell reaction on a semiconductor photoanode is one of the major challenges in PEC water splitting, because of its dynamic difficulty.3,4 In theory, the semiconductor photoanode with satisfactory PEC water oxidation performance should have a suitable valence band (VB) position, high solar conversion efficiency, good PEC stability and low synthesis cost.5,6 Unfortunately, the reported photoanodes so far can't fully achieve the above requirements. Therefore, the search for and study of photoanode materials is still at the forefront of the PEC water splitting field.
Among the candidate semiconductors for PEC water oxidation, monoclinic bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has attracted extensive attention as a promising photoanode material in recent years,7 due to its appropriate band gap (2.4–2.5 eV) with a VB edge position of ∼2.40 V vs. RHE.8 Assuming a 100% solar conversion efficiency on the BiVO4 photoanode, 11% of solar energy can be absorbed to drive the PEC water oxidation reaction, and a maximum photocurrent of ∼7.5 mA cm−2 could be achieved.9 Previous research studies have demonstrated that the VB of BiVO4 is mainly composed of hybridized O 2p and Bi 6s orbitals, and the conduction band (CB) consists of mainly the V 3d orbital with contributions from O 2p and Bi 6p orbitals.10,11 It is emphasized that the multi-atom orbital hybridization makes BiVO4 has a modest band gap and VB edge position, but the extensive mixing of the Bi 6s orbital and O 2p orbital results in low carrier mobility in BiVO4.11 Additionally, the multi-atom orbital hybridization leads to the formation of dangling bonds that are derived from broken Bi–O bonds and exposes unsaturated Bi atoms on the BiVO4 surface, which induces high energy surface states of BiVO4.12,13 Significantly, the photocatalyst with high energy surface states could generate native electron–hole recombination centers on its surface, which is disadvantageous to photocatalytic reactions.14–16 Therefore, the modification of BiVO4 high energy surface states is one of the important breakthroughs to improve its PEC water oxidation activity.
In general, the surface states of BiVO4 depend on its surface feature and crystal structure. Co-catalyst coupling has shown effective improvement in the surface charge separation of BiVO4 through the modification of its surface states. Typically, amorphous TiO2 has the function of reacting with the surface defects of BiVO4 and blocking its surface charge recombination; thus the amorphous TiO2 coupled BiVO4 photoanode has much higher PEC water oxidation activity than pure BiVO4.17 An ultrathin p-type NiO layer on the BiVO4 photoanode is capable of reducing the charge recombination at the BiVO4 surface trapping states, and accordingly enhanced PEC water oxidation activity was achieved on the NiO/BiVO4 photoanode.18 In addition, impurity doping has been demonstrated to improve the carrier mobility in the bulk and surface of BiVO4. For example, W and Mo co-doped BiVO4 shows higher PEC water oxidation activity than undoped BiVO4,19,20 because W and Mo can act as excellent shallow dopants to facilitate the charge separation of BiVO4. Phosphate doped into BiVO4 is conducive to facilitate charge transfer for PEC water oxidation; thus the phosphate doped BiVO4 photoanode shows greatly enhanced PEC water oxidation activity.21 However, the reported BiVO4 doping works mainly focus on V5+ or O2− be substituted with impurity, few regard to the effect of Bi3+ be substituted.
As mentioned above, the high energy surface states of BiVO4 are mainly caused by the broken Bi–O bonds and exposed unsaturated Bi atoms in BiVO4, indicating that the substitution of partial sites of Bi3+ in BiVO4 by impurities should result in the modification of BiVO4 surface states. Herein, trivalent indium (In3+) was studied as a smaller ionic radius (0.8 Å) dopant to substitute partial sites of Bi3+ (1.03 Å) for the modification of surface states and PEC water oxidation activity of BiVO4. The 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 photoanode shows over 200% greater photocurrent than the undoped BiVO4 photoanode for water oxidation. Density functional theory calculations indicate that In3+-doping passivates the surface states of BiVO4 by shortening the Bi–O bond length to reduce the amount of exposed unsaturated Bi atoms and broken Bi–O bonds on the BiVO4 surface, which thus suppresses the surface charge recombination rate of BiVO4.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of BiVO4 and In3+-doped BiVO4 films
BiVO4 and In3+-doped BiVO4 films were prepared by a similar drop-casting method as our previous work.22,23 Firstly, bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99.0%, Aladdin) and vanadium trichloride (VCl3, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved separately in ethylene glycol to form 0.5 M Bi3+ and V3+ precursor solution. Indium nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)3·41/2H2O, ≥99.5%, Aladdin) was dissolved in ethylene glycol to form a In3+ precursor solution with a concentration of 0.1 M. Then, the resulting precursor solution was mixed with desired atomic ratios of V3+:Bi3+:In3+ = 1:(1 − x):x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.09). After that, 50 μL of the mixed precursor solution was dropped on a fluorine doped tin oxide glass (FTO, 1.0 cm × 1.5 cm, sheet resistance < 50 Ω) substrate which had been ultrasonically cleaned with distilled water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, the FTO substrate with the dropped precursor solution was evaporated at 150 °C for 60 min and annealed in air at 500 °C for 90 min. For comparison, the In2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction film was prepared using a similar drop-casting procedure. The In3+ precursor solution was dropped on the surface of the BiVO4 film and then annealed in air at 450 °C for 45 min. Thus, the formed In2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction film consists of an upper layer of In2O3 and a lower layer of BiVO4 film. For investigating the effect of In3+-doping on the surface states of BiVO4, BiVO4 and In3+-doped BiVO4 films were treated using 1,2-ethanedithiol (C2H4(SH)2, EDT, 97%, Aladdin). The as-prepared films were immersed in EDT for 20–25 min followed by cleaning with deionized water and then used for PEC measurements.
2.2 Material characterization
The morphology of BiVO4 and In3+-doped BiVO4 films was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Supra 55 VP). The crystal phase of the as-prepared samples was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a PANalytical X'pert PRO diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. The chemical state and compositions of the as-prepared samples were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250, Thermo Scientific). The composition of the as-prepared films was further analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP, Thermo ICAP6300 Duo) via dissolving the films in 15 wt% nitric acid. UV-vis absorption spectra were collected on a Shimadzu UV-2600/2700 spectrophotometer. In situ photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded using a Spex 500 M spectrometer in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution at room temperature with a 325 nm laser as an excitation source. Simultaneously, PL emission spectra were recorded using the same spectrometer and excitation source in air at room temperature.
2.3 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out employing a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode system (quartz cube cup, 5.0 × 5.0 × 5.0 cm3). The as-prepared films were directly used as a working electrode without further treatment. A Pt wire (99.99%) and saturated calomel electrode (Hg/Hg2Cl2/KCl, SCE) were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH 6.8) was used as the electrolyte for the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements. The pH of the used electrolyte was checked using a benchtop pH meter (PHS-3C, Shanghai INESA Scientific Instrument). A 300 W xenon lamp with an AM 1.5G filter (Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd.) provided 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar light during photoelectrochemical measurements. The photoelectrochemical measurements for all film electrodes were mainly conducted using back-side illumination (through the FTO substrate to film). For comparison, a front-side illumination LSV measurement was performed. All potentials measured were calibrated to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following equation: ERHE = EθSCE + ESCE + 0.059pH (EθSCE = 0.2415 V vs. RHE, at 298 K)(1)
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the as-prepared film electrodes was performed at 1.23 V vs. RHE in a frequency range of 0.1–100000 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV in 0.1 M Na2SO4 under irradiation. The measured EIS spectra were fitted using Zview software with a proposed equivalent circuit model. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the as-prepared films was measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 under monochromatic light irradiation. A typical incident light power density spectrum used for the IPCE measurement can be found in Fig. S1.† The incident light power was measured using a handheld optical power meter with a UV enhanced silicon photo-detector (Newport, Models 1916C and 818-UV). The IPCE at each wavelength was calculated using the following equation: IPCE (%) = (1240 × I)/(Plight × λ) × 100%(2)where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) under monochromatic light irradiation, Plight is the incident light power density (mW cm−2), and λ is the wavelength (nm) of the incident light.
The flat band potential of BiVO4 and 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 films was investigated using Mott–Schottky measurements. The flat band potential was determined using the following equation: 1/C2 = (2/eεε0A2Nd)(Va − Vfb − kT/e)(3)where C is the differential capacitance of the space-charge region, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the sample, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, A is the surface area of the sample, Nd is the concentration of charge carriers, Va is the applied potential, Vfb is the flat band potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and e is the elemental charge.
To investigate whether photocurrents on the photoanode originated from water oxidation, the faradaic efficiency of O2 evolution [η(O2)] was measured in a single gas-tight cell at 1.0 V vs. RHE. Prior to measurement, the solution (0.1 M Na2SO4) was degassed by bubbling Ar for 0.5 h. The amount of generated O2 was detected using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph. The value of [η(O2)] was calculated according to eqn (4). η(O2) = (amount of generated O2) × 100/(theoretical amount of O2)(4)
2.4 Computational method and details
Theoretical calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT) and were carried out using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). Ultrasoft pseudopotentials were employed corresponding to the optimization scheme of Vanderbilt.24 The Kohn–Sham wave functions were expanded using a plane wave at a selected fixed cutoff of 380 eV. The effects of exchange and correlation were described through the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism within generalized gradient approximation (GGA).25 A k-point sampling set of 5 × 5 × 1 was tested to be converged. A force tolerance of 0.01 eV Å−1, energy tolerance of 1.0 × 10−5 eV per atom and maximum displacement of 1.0 × 10−3 Å were considered for an equilibrium structure. The surfaces cut along the (121) and (110) directions form bulk with the fixed three atomic layers at the bottom. The vacuum space along the z direction is set to be 15 Å, which is enough to avoid interaction between the two neighboring images. The pristine BiVO4 and doped BiVO4 systems with In atoms replacing 7% Bi atoms have been considered. For each surface, there exist different possible termination planes. Therefore, the surface energy of each possible termination plane was calculated firstly, and then the most stable plane with the lowest surface energy was chosen for further surface calculations. The surface energy (ΔEsurf) calculation was performed as follows. ΔEsurf = (Esurf − Ebulk)/A(5)where Esurf and Ebulk denote the energies of the BiVO4 bulk and surface, respectively, and A denotes the area of the surface.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the photograph of BiVO4 and In3+-doped BiVO4 films, showing uniform yellow films covered on the FTO substrate. The morphology of films was observed by SEM and shown in Fig. 1b–f. The undoped BiVO4 film consisted of randomly oriented nanoflakes, and the cross-sectional analysis (inset of Fig. 1b) indicates that the BiVO4 layer has a thickness of ∼500 nm. After incorporation of In3+, the morphology of BiVO4 did not change obviously. 3%, 5%, 7%, and 9% In3+-doped BiVO4 films have a similar morphology to the undoped BiVO4 film (Fig. 1c–f), which is consistent with previous studies related to the W6+- or Mo6+-doped BiVO4 film showing no obvious morphology and microstructure changes.22,26 From the SEM observations, it is clear that the obviously enhanced PEC water oxidation activity observed on In3+-doped BiVO4 films in subsequent PEC measurements should not be caused by morphology difference.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of BiVO4 and In3+-doped BiVO4 films. The diffraction peaks in the pattern of undoped BiVO4 are perfectly indexed to monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS card no. 14-0688). For the In3+-doped BiVO4 films, their diffraction peaks are almost identical to the undoped BiVO4 film, implying that In3+-doping did not induce phase transformation in BiVO4. However, the diffraction peak at 35.25° was observed to shift slight in the In3+-doped samples with respect to undoped BiVO4 (inset of Fig. 2a), which suggests that the incorporation of In3+ deforms the crystal structure of monoclinic BiVO4.27 The crystal deformation should be caused by partial Bi3+ sites being occupied by In3+ because of the ionic radii of In3+ (0.8 Å) being smaller than that of Bi3+ (1.03 Å), making In3+-doping feasible.28 XPS analysis was conducted to get additional insights into the chemical composition of the In3+-doped BiVO4 film. A typical overall survey spectrum obtained from the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film is shown in Fig. S2a.† As expected, the characteristic peaks in the survey spectrum closely match with Bi 4f, V 2p, O 1s and In 3d. In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Bi 4f, the two peaks located at ∼159.20 eV and ∼164.42 eV can be assigned to the characteristic spin–orbit split of the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 in monoclinic BiVO4, respectively (Fig. 2b).29 The V 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2c) exhibits two peaks at binding energies of 516.75 eV and 524.35 eV, corresponding to the V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 of BiVO4, respectively.30 In addition, the observed O 1s peak (Fig. S2b†) at 530.03 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen in BiVO4.26 The successful doping of In3+ can be observed from Fig. 2d, and the characteristic peaks at 444.98 eV (In 3d5/2) and 453.54 eV (In 3d3/2) closely match the In3+ oxidation state.31 According to the XPS spectrum, the atomic ratio of Bi3+ and In3+ was calculated to be 93.2:6.8. Furthermore, the ICP test further confirmed that the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film has an atomic ratio of Bi3+:In3+ = 93.1:6.9 (shown in Table S1†), which is close to the expected atomic ratio of 93:7. The XRD and XPS results confirm that In3+ was expectantly doped into the BiVO4 lattice.

The PEC water oxidation activity of undoped BiVO4 and In3+-doped BiVO4 films in 0.1 M Na2SO4 was evaluated and shown in Fig. 3. In general, the In3+-doped BiVO4 photoanodes show higher photocurrent than the undoped BiVO4 photoanode, revealing higher PEC water oxidation activity. Among the In3+-doped BiVO4 photoanodes, the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film has optimal PEC water oxidation activity with a highest photocurrent of 1.56 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the 7% In3+-doped film shows over 200% greater photocurrent than the undoped BiVO4 film both under front-side and back-side illumination (Fig. 3b, c and S3†). The faradaic efficiency of the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film for O2 evolution is close to 100%, demonstrating that its photocurrents are originated from the PEC water oxidation (Fig. S4†). The IPCE measurement further confirms that the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film shows enhanced PEC water oxidation activity. As demonstrated in Fig. 3d, the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film exhibits enhanced IPCE over the entire measurement region (320 to 520 nm) in comparison to the undoped BiVO4 film. The IPCE data are further integrated and shown in Table S2,† which is consistent with the measured LSV and i–t results. To further check the possibility that the higher photocurrent on the In3+-doped BiVO4 film was merely due to In2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction interaction, the PEC water oxidation activity of the In2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction film was measured. The In2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction film has a lower photocurrent similar to the undoped BiVO4 film (Fig. S5†). In theory, if the In2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction was formed in the In3+-doped BiVO4 film, different absorption edges should be observed in the subsequent UV-vis absorbance spectrum (Fig. 4a). From the SEM, XRD and subsequent UV-vis absorbance spectral observations, it can be concluded that In3+ doped into BiVO4 did not lead to an obvious change in the morphology, phase and band gap of BiVO4. Thus, the improved PEC water oxidation activity on the In3+-doped BiVO4 film can be ascribed to the fact that In3+ substituting the partial sites of Bi3+ in BiVO4 improves the transfer and separation of charge for PEC water oxidation.

All measurements were conducted in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH 6.8) under back-side illumination, and the scan rate for LSV measurements was 15 mV s−1. Amperometric i–t curves and IPCE spectra were recorded at 1.23 V vs. RHE.

In order to understand the effect of In3+-doping on the optical absorption properties of BiVO4, UV-vis absorbance spectra for 7% In3+-doped and undoped BiVO4 films were measured. As shown in Fig. 4a, both spectra show the typical feature of BiVO4 with an absorption edge around 520 nm. On the basis of UV-vis absorbance spectra, the band gap of films was calculated and shown in Fig. 4b. Regardless of In3+ incorporation, both the films have the same band gap of ∼2.41 eV, which is close to the reported band gap of 2.4–2.5 eV for monoclinic BiVO4 synthesized by other methods.30,32 Additionally, the 7% In3+-doped and undoped BiVO4 films reveal a similar absorbed photon flux (shown in Fig. 4c), and the total absorbed photocurrent values of 7% In3+-doped and undoped BiVO4 films are integrated to be 5.42 mA cm−2 and 5.84 mA cm−2, respectively. These results indicate that the slight difference in the optical absorption properties should not be the main cause for PEC water oxidation activity change on the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film.
The flat band potential and PEC water oxidation kinetics of 7% In3+-doped and undoped BiVO4 films were determined to understand the origin of enhanced PEC water oxidation activity on the In3+-doped BiVO4 photoanode. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, both 7% In3+-doped and undoped BiVO4 films display typical n-type semiconductor characteristics with a positive slope, indicating that electrons are the major carriers in the film electrodes.33,34 The flat band potential for the undoped BiVO4 is around −0.36 V vs. SCE, while for the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 it is about −0.20 to −0.24 V vs. SCE; a positive shift of ∼120 to 160 mV was observed. According to the Mott–Schottky equation (shown in eqn (3)), the positive shift of flat band potential indicates that In3+-doping may induce the increase of carrier density.26,27 As for the kinetics of the PEC water oxidation reaction, the semicircle arc of the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film electrode is much smaller than that of the undoped BiVO4 film electrode (Fig. 5c), implying that 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 has faster water oxidation kinetics. The impedance spectra are further fitted using an equivalent circuit model (Fig. 5d). In the equivalent circuit, Rs represents the resistance of the electrolyte, Rct is the charge transfer resistance of the PEC water oxidation reaction, and CPE is the constant phase element. It is generally accepted that a smaller value of Rct corresponds to faster kinetics of the PEC water oxidation reaction. As shown in Table 1, the fitted Rct value of the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film electrode is 347 Ω, while that of the undoped BiVO4 film electrode is 4105 Ω, indicating that In3+-doping induces faster PEC water oxidation on the BiVO4 photoanode.

The surface charge recombination rate of 7% In3+-doped and undoped BiVO4 films was examined by chronoamperometry (Fig. 6a). Typically, an anodic photocurrent spike (Iin) can appear on the photoanode under a sudden illumination, which is attributed to the bulk separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Immediately, a photocurrent decay owing to the surface recombination of electrons and holes is observed until a gradually stabilized photocurrent (Ist) (shown in Fig. 6b).35–37 To quantitatively determine the charge recombination behavior, a normalized parameter (D) is applied as follows: D = (It − Ist)/(Iin − Ist)(6)where It is the time-dependent photocurrent, Ist is the steady-state photocurrent, and Iin represents the initial photocurrent. In any case, we define the transient time constant (τ) as the time at which lnD = −1 in the normalized plot. Based on the definition, the τ value was estimated to be 3.97 s for the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film, while it was 0.95 s for the undoped BiVO4 film (Fig. 6c), revealing that In3+-doping suppresses the surface charge recombination of the BiVO4 photoanode.

Previous experimental and calculation studies have demonstrated that the relatively poor PEC activity of the BiVO4 photoanode is caused by the high recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the bulk and surface.8,38 The native recombination centers of BiVO4 are related to its high energy surface states, which is mainly derived from exposed unsaturated Bi atoms and broken Bi–O bonds in BiVO4.12,13 Notably, 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) was used as a typical passivator to modify the surface states of photocatalysts and improve their surface charge separation efficiency through bonding with the dangling bonds of the photocatalyst surface.39–41 For investigating the effect of In3+-doping on the surface states of BiVO4, we studied the PEC water oxidation activity of the EDT-treated BiVO4 and 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 films (Fig. 7a). Significantly, the photocurrent on EDT-treated BiVO4 and 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 films is higher than that on the undoped BiVO4 film, but the photocurrent is slightly enhanced on the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film that was further treated with EDT. In addition, the surface charge states of undoped BiVO4, 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 films with and without EDT treatment were further investigated by in situ photoluminescence (PL) emission measurement in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. As shown in Fig. 7b, a strong PL emission peak at ∼560 nm originating from the surface recombination of electron–hole pairs was observed on the undoped BiVO4 film. In contrast, the PL emission peak intensity of 7% In3+-doped, EDT-treated, and EDT-treated/7% In3+-doped BiVO4 films is obviously reduced, which is opposite to the typical feature of PL emission intensity for EDT-passivated photocatalysts.42 It should be noted that our PL emission measurement was performed in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution, which has a function of charge extraction due to its high conductivity. Actually, a similar reduction in PL emission intensity has been reported on some passivated films with a charge extraction layer for solar cells.43,44 On the other hand, enhanced PL emission intensity was observed for our 7% In3+-doped and EDT-treated BiVO4 films under PL emission measurement in air (see Fig. S6†). Significantly, the Bi–O dangling bonds on the BiVO4 surface normally result in typical nonradiative charge recombination. Therefore, we can infer that In3+-doping may have a similar effect as EDT-passivation on the surface states of BiVO4 on the basis of the LSV and PL results.

To illustrate the surface state changing of BiVO4 with and without In3+-doping, DFT calculations were performed to investigate the bond length and surface energy (ΔEsurf) of BiVO4 and 7% In3+-doped BiVO4. Based on the XRD results (Fig. 2a), the structural parameters of BiVO4 and 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 along the (110) and (121) directions were mainly simulated. As shown in Fig. 8, the length of Bi–O bonds was shortened from 2.454 Å to 2.235 Å for BiVO4 (110), and 2.165 Å to 2.079 Å for BiVO4 (121) after 7% In3+-doping. The calculation results further indicate that more unsaturated electrons in the Bi atom are involved into the Bi–O bonds after In3+ substituting partially Bi3+ sites in BiVO4, resulting in a reduced amount of exposed unsaturated Bi atoms and broken Bi–O bonds. Thus, the surface energy of 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 was lower than those of the undoped BiVO4 both in (110) and (121) directions (Table 2). The ΔEsurf for undoped BiVO4 (110) and (121) is 0.28333 J m−2, 0.61702 J m−2, respectively. In contrast, 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 has lower ΔEsurf, 0.14467 J m−2 for (110) and 0.35834 J m−2 for (121). Generally, the surface energies of both doped and undoped BiVO4 (121) are higher than that of (110) because the structure along the (121) direction is unstable and more dangling bonds are formed. According to the experimental and calculation results, the enhanced PEC water oxidation activity on the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film can be attributed to the incorporation of In3+ that passivated the surface states of BiVO4, and thus inhibited the surface charge recombination.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that In3+ doped into BiVO4 to substitute partial sites of Bi3+ has the functions of modifying the surface states and improving the PEC water oxidation activity of BiVO4. Among the In3+-doped BiVO4 film photoanodes, the 7% In3+-doped BiVO4 film has optimal PEC water oxidation activity. In3+-doping did not change the morphology, phase and band gap of BiVO4 obviously, but resulted in a positive shift of the flat band position and higher surface charge separation efficiency for PEC water oxidation. After In3+-doping, the surface energy of BiVO4 decreased through the involvement of more unsaturated electrons of the Bi atom in the Bi–O bonds, thus reducing the amount of exposed unsaturated Bi atoms and broken Bi–O bonds. Therefore, the enhanced PEC water oxidation activity on the In3+-doped BiVO4 film can be ascribed to the incorporation of In3+ that passivated the surface states of BiVO4 and thus inhibited the surface charge recombination.
