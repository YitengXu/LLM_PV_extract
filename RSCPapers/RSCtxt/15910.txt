    , Accepted 20th April 2018First published on 20th April 2018AbstractThe electronic structures of three previously synthesized Ni-coordinated chlorins with β-substituents of thioketone, fluorene, and ketone were investigated using magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy (MCD) and density functional theory (DFT) for potential application as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Computational studies on modeled Zn-coordinated chlorins allowed identification of charge transfer and d–d transitions of the Ni2+ coordinated chlorins. Two fictive Zn chlorins, M1 and M2, were designed with thiophene units based on the fluorene substituted chlorin. Substitution with thiophene altered the typical arrangement of the four Gouterman molecular orbitals (MOs) and red-shifted and greatly intensified the lowest energy absorption band (the Q band). The introduction of the thiophene-based MO as the LUMO below the usual Gouterman LUMO is predicted to increase the efficiency of electron transfer from the dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor in DSSCs. The addition of a donor group on the opposite pyrrole (M2) red-shifted the Q band further and introduced a donor-based MO between the typical Gouterman HOMO and HOMO−1. Despite the relatively small ΔHOMO, M1 and M2 exhibited remarkably intense Q bands. M2 would be a possible candidate for application in DSSCs due to its panchromatic absorption, intense and red-shifted Q band, and the presence of the substituent based MO properties. Another indicator of a successful dye is the alignment of the ground state and excited state oxidation potentials (GSOP and ESOP, respectively) with respect to the conduction band of the semiconductor. The GSOP for M2 lies 0.55 eV below the I−/I3− redox potential and the ESOP lies 0.48 eV above the TiO2 conduction band. The impact of the thiophene dominance in the LUMO also supports the prediction of efficient sensitization properties. The remarkably intense Q band of M2 predicted to be at 777 nm with a ΔHOMO of just 1.04 eV provides a synthetic route to tetrapyrroles with extremely intense, red Q bands without the need for aza nitrogens of the phthalocyanines. This study illustrates the value of guided synthesis using MCD spectral analysis and computational methods for optimizing the design of porphyrin dyes.
Introduction
The increasing demand for renewable energy has led to the search for efficient methods for capturing photon energy and converting it into electricity. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising photovoltaic devices that mimic photosynthetic processes.1 They are relatively cheap and easy to fabricate compared to the traditional silicon-based solar cells, however, the power conversion efficiency is still not as high.2–4 In addition, the organic dyes are not as robust as the silicon-based solar cells. Unlike traditional solar cells, light absorption and electron transport are handled by different materials in DSSCs.1,5,6 This different mechanism allows for the tuning of the stability and optical properties of the sensitizing dye to maximize electron transfer to the wide-band-gap semiconductor, most often TiO2 nanoparticles. An ideal dye should also show a panchromatic response, with strong absorption in the 700–900 nm region.7,8 Chlorophylls (Chls) are Nature's energy convertors and the chlorin macrocycle (Fig. 1) plays a major role in light-harvesting and the subsequent electron transfer.9,10 Nature's use of chlorophyll has inspired researchers to synthesize chlorin derivatives for use in DSSCs,11,12 as the natural Chls dimerize readily, and are also unstable.13

The chlorin functionality is based on the reduced pyrrole ring, which gives a more intense and red-shifted lowest energy absorption band (Q band) when compared with the completely unsaturated porphyrin.14 The tetrapyrrole macrocycle also offers many design possibilities. Substituents can be attached to the pyrrole ring (β-position) and at the methine bridge (meso-position), Fig. 1. The visible region spectral properties of tetrapyrroles, specifically chlorins in this study, arise from transitions between two highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO, HOMO−1) and two lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO, LUMO+1).15 These four orbitals are referred to as Gouterman's MOs.16 The two HOMOs and two LUMOs can be identified by their nodal patterns of 4 and 5, respectively. The absorption and redox properties of the π ring can be tuned by modifying the peripheral substituents, the conjugation pathway,17,18 and the central metal ion.
Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy can identify subtle yet significant changes in the electronic structure to support the computational data of the underlying electronic structure.19 The MCD spectrum is dominated by three band morphologies namely the A, B, and C terms.20–23 In the experimental spectra described in this paper, the low symmetry of the chlorins means that only B terms are observed. When the energy difference between the HOMO pair (ΔHOMO) is greater than the energy difference between the LUMO pair (ΔLUMO), a negative-to-positive MCD band pattern is observed in increasing energy (a positive A term).24,25 This is the normal situation for tetrapyrroles. The opposite sign pattern, positive-to-negative in increasing energy (a negative A term), is observed when ΔLUMO is greater than ΔHOMO, which is relatively unusual.20,24
In this paper we describe computationally guided design of dyes that are predicted to exhibit exceptional performance in DSSC applications. We started by exploring the influence of β-substitution and Ni2+ coordination on the electronic structure of three chlorin compounds (Fig. 2). Computational studies on both the synthetic Ni2+ coordinated and modeled Zn2+ coordinated chlorins assisted in the assignment of the optical spectra and the interpretation of the effect of β-substitution with thioketone (Syn3), fluorene (Syn6), and ketone (Lie95). Syn3 and Syn6 exhibited the necessary intense, red Q band but lack an anchor group for use in DSSCs. Syn6 was used as the base of two fictive chlorins with thiophene units attached to the fluorene group. In addition, a donor group was incorporated in one of the fictive chlorins. The thiophene moiety from Yamamoto et al.26 was utilized because thiophenes provide a good linking bridge between the tetrapyrrole and the anchor group that is necessary for connection to the semiconductor.27 Polythiophene substituents in tetrapyrroles are known to increase the absorption coefficient and red-shift the Q band, which are necessary properties for efficient dyes.28–30 MCD spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT), and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were used to guide the design of the fictive chlorins. The effects of these substituents on the energies of the Gouterman MOs and the impact on the Q band energy and intensity were explored. The fictive chlorin with the donor group exhibited exceptional optical properties with a remarkably high molar absorptivity and red Q band making this compound an ideal candidate for use in DSSC applications.

Materials and methods
The chlorins studied here were kindly provided by Franz-Peter Montforts, Universitat Bremen, and their synthesis and characterization are reported in the following papers.31,32 The compounds were used as supplied. The sample solutions for UV-visible absorption and MCD spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving each compound in dichloromethane (DCM) (Caledon Laboratories Ltd). All measurements were obtained at room temperature.
Spectroscopy
UV-visible absorption data were recorded on a Varian Cary 500 absorption spectrometer (Varian, Toronto, Canada). MCD spectral data were recorded on a Jasco J-810 CD instrument (Jasco Inc., New Jersey, USA) with a 1.4 T permanent magnet (Olis Inc., Georgia, USA).
Computational methods
The Scigress Modelling Software33 was used to model all the compounds. The Gaussian G09 program34 was used to carry out DFT ground state geometry optimizations and TD-DFT single point excited state calculations. The CAM-B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set were used in all the calculations. Solvent effects were modeled with the default SCRF method, using DCM as solvent. Atomic coordinates of the optimized structures can be found in the ESI,† Tables S1–S4.
Results and discussion
The solutions of Syn3 and Syn6 were green, giving rise to broad absorption throughout the UV-visible region, but no absorption was measured to the red of the Q band up to 800 nm. The solution of Lie95 was blue. No emission was detected up to 1000 nm following excitation into the Q band at room temperature for all three chlorins.
UV-visible absorption and MCD spectral data
The absorption and MCD spectra for the three Ni2+ coordinated chlorins are shown in Fig. 3. For each of the three chlorins, four bands are observed in the Q band region: Qx, Qy, and their respective vibronic bands. The splitting of Qx and Qy suggest that the magnitudes of ΔHOMO and ΔLUMO are large.35,36 A negatively signed MCD B term locates Qx at 684, 680, and 612 nm for Syn3, Syn6, and Lie95, respectively. A positively signed MCD B term locates Qy at 591, 586, and 544 nm for Syn3, Syn6, and Lie95, respectively. The negative-to-positive sign sequence of the B terms indicates that ΔHOMO is larger than ΔLUMO in all three chlorins.19,20
 Fig. 3  MCD, absorption, and calculated absorption spectra for the Ni-coordinated Syn3, Syn6, and Lie95 in DCM. The theoretical spectra of the respective Zn-coordinated chlorins are shown in the last row. A bandwidth of 500 cm−1 was used. 
Multiple bands are observed in the B band region for Syn3 and Syn6 while a typical single B band is observed for Lie95. The panchromatic absorption as a result of multiple transitions in the B band region, and the intense red-shifted Q band for Syn3 and Syn6 would likely make these more efficient sensitizing dyes than Lie95.
The theoretical spectra of the Ni2+ and Zn2+ coordinated complexes are also included in Fig. 3 to allow for direct comparison with the experimental data. TD-DFT calculations overestimate the energies of the excited states.37,38 To allow for easier band assignment between the theoretical and experimental spectra, different start and end values of the x-axis were chosen for the theoretical spectra. From the calculations, the lowest energy Q band was found to be Qx for Syn3, Syn6, and Lie95. This is opposite the case for chlorophyll, where Qy is the lowest energy absorption band.39,40Syn3 and Syn6, with the thioketone and fluorene substitution, respectively, exhibit experimental Q bands (at 689 and 683 nm, respectively) that are more red-shifted than chlorophyll a (662 nm). The mismatch in the theoretically derived Q band energies is rationalized later in Fig. 9 (vide infra).
Origin of the B band spectral properties
With respect to the B band spectral properties, it is clear that only the Lie95 absorption spectrum resembles that of a simple methyl-substituted chlorin absorption spectrum.41,42 The absorption spectra of Syn3 and Syn6 in the B region are much more complicated,37 exhibiting several resolved absorption bands. In the same manner as for the Q band analysis, the MCD spectra provides guidance about the electronic structure of the excited states responsible for the B bands. The MCD spectra for chlorins are dominated by Faraday B terms. This B term intensity arises from the field induced coupling between x- and y-polarized excited states of the nominally planar ring.21 This results in equal and opposite B terms. The magnitude of the B terms is dependent on the sign and orbital angular momentum of the originating, nominally degenerate states. The observed B term intensity is also inversely dependent on the difference in energy between the coupled states. For chlorins, the parental angular momentum arises from transitions between the Gouterman MOs that form the B band state. The signs of the two MCD B terms in the B band are expected to follow the Q band, which is negative-to-positive in increasing energy.
To reiterate, the MCD spectral properties of the Q band for all three compounds exhibit the negative-to-positive MCD pattern in ascending energy that is typically observed for a low symmetry porphyrin.36 In addition, the calculations to be described below, show that ΔLUMO is less than ΔHOMO (vide infra), which is consistent with the observation of the positive pseudo MCD A term for the Q band.20 We focus first on Lie95 because its spectral properties are the simplest of the three chlorins. The B band MCD band morphology appears to be a negative MCD pseudo A term, with the positive lobe at 417 and the negative lobe at 401 nm. In other words, the MCD B band morphology does not follow the sign pattern of the Q band. This is unusual because there have been no previous reports, to our knowledge, of negative A term character for the B band when the Q band character exhibited a typical positive MCD pattern. However, Rhoda et al. do report a negatively signed Q band with a positively signed B band.43 The B band intensity, as noted above, arises from the coupling between adjacent states with x- and y-polarization in planar molecules. Unlike the Qx and Qy states, the Bx and By states are closer in energy. The underlying angular momentum for the B band is ±1 BM compared with ±9 BM for the Q band so we expect and we observe much weaker MCD intensity for the B band. We will discuss the possible origin of the inversion of the B band morphology next.
The polarization of the main transitions in the B band of Lie95 are aligned at approximately 90° which allows for the equal and opposite B terms to be observed in the MCD spectrum centered on 409 nm. The significant splitting of LUMO and LUMO+1 has been identified as the origin for the inversion of the pseudo A term in the Q band of tetrapyrroles because the angular momentum in the excited state is quenched. In the B band of Lie95, the introduction of metal based transitions in states 8 and 12 also clearly results in the quenching of the angular momentum of these states, which are much higher in energy than the Q band. This leads us, therefore, to assign the observed positive-to-negative sign pattern in the B band region to a mixture of metal-to-ligand charge transfer and to the usual π-to-π* transitions. The same argument can be applied to the B band in Syn3, with states 8 and 10 comprising a mixture of metal based and π-to-π* transitions. For Syn6, the overlap of B terms in the B band region near 440 nm makes assignment impossible.
Influence of Ni(II) on the optical spectrum of Syn3, Syn6, and Lie95 chlorins
Ni(II) has unfilled d-orbitals (d8) which allows for charge transfer to the ring MOs and vice versa. Zn(II), with completely filled d-orbitals (d10), will not exhibit charge transfer contributions to the optical spectra in the visible region. Tables 1–3 shows a comparison of the excited state contributions for the Zn- and Ni-centered synthetic chlorins. For the Zn-centered Syn3, Syn6, and Lie95, excited states 1 and 2 represent the Qx and Qy bands and arise from the usual set of transitions between the four Gouterman MOs. On the other hand for the Ni-centered compounds, the calculations show excited states from charge transfer and d–d transitions at lower energies of the Q band. However, transition to these states have oscillator strengths close to zero. The transitions that make up the Q and B bands come from similar MOs for both the Zn- and Ni-centered compounds, except in addition, the Ni-centered compounds exhibit ring to metal, metal to ring, and ring to substituent transitions. The electron density surfaces for the non Gouterman MOs are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S1–S3.

The electronic structures of Syn3, Syn6, and Lie95
The energies and electron density surfaces of the four Gouterman orbitals obtained from DFT and TD-DFT calculations for the Ni- and Zn-coordinated Syn3, Syn6, and Lie95 are shown in Fig. 4 and 5. Data for the unsubstituted Ni and Zn chlorin are also shown for comparison. The reduced symmetry of the chlorin compared with a porphyrin, due to the reduced pyrrole ring, splits the typically degenerate HOMO pair and LUMO pair (Fig. 4). In comparison with the unsubstituted zinc chlorin, the electron withdrawing nature of the thioketone (Syn3), fluorene (Syn6), and ketone (Lie95) groups at the β-positions stabilize these four MOs, lowering their energy. Syn3, with the strongest electron withdrawing group of these three chlorins (thioketone), exhibited the largest decrease in orbital energy. The fluorene group shows the smallest electron withdrawing character of the three based on the reduction in MO energy. The Zn-centered compounds exhibit smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps, resulting in a more red-shifted Q band than the respective Ni-centered compounds in the computed absorption spectra. Interestingly, only the Zn-centered Syn3 exhibited a ΔLUMO > ΔHOMO relationship like the parent chlorin. The surfaces in Fig. 5 help explain this difference. The LUMO pair with five nodes see all the electron density equally so the metal will have no major effect on their energies. The a1u orbital (HOMO) has nodes through the pyrrole nitrogen and the metal, making it also insensitive to the metal. However, the density surface for the a2u orbital (HOMO−1) shows contributions from the Ni2+ d-orbitals that are absent for the Zn complexes, which results in the a2u ring orbital being stabilized. Therefore, when the chlorins are Ni-coordinated, the metal stabilizes HOMO−1 resulting in a ΔHOMO that is larger than the respective Zn-coordinated chlorin.

Influence of β-substitution and metal on Gouterman MOs
For all three chlorins, the a1u orbital, with nodes through the methine bridge and pyrrole nitrogen, lie above the a2u (Fig. 5). The β-substituents are observed to contribute density in the HOMO (a1u), LUMO, and LUMO+1, with the most density in the LUMO and least density in the HOMO. The presence of electron density on the substituents in the LUMO will help facilitate electron transfer to the CB of the semiconductor.44 The β-substituents do not contribute density to the a2u orbital (HOMO−1) as a node passes through them. Active β-substituents will connect to the ring π system but the energy of the substituent itself cannot be too high or it will be unable to interact with the ring orbitals. For example, the carbonyl group in Lie95 does not contribute as much electron density as the thioketone group in Syn3 because the lower energy sulfur matches the energy of the ring better. The optimized ring geometry for the Ni- and Zn-coordinated chlorins are saddle shaped and planar, respectively.
Design features for dyes in DSSCs
While the chlorins described above exhibit intense and red-shifted Q bands, the electron transfer component requires additional features. Strong coupling between the dye and the semiconductor is necessary for efficient electron transfer.45 Typically, thiophene units have been used as electron conductors based on their extended π-conjugation.46,47 Connection to the CB of TiO2 is most commonly achieved via the carboxylate group. The fluorene in Syn6 provides an excellent conjugated anchoring site for the polythiophene. Zn2+ was chosen as the central metal because the presence of the low-lying charge transfer and d–d transitions with Ni2+ identified in the calculations preclude electron transfer to the CB of the TiO2. These low-lying states resulted in the emission being quenched.
Electronic structure of the fictive chlorins
Two fictive Zn-coordinated chlorins, M1 and M2 (Fig. 6A), were designed based on Syn6. In M1, thiophene units were attached to the fluorene group, in M2, thiophene units were attached to the fluorene group and in addition, an electron donating group was fused to the opposite pyrrole. These two molecular structures were chosen to exploit the extended π-conjugation at the β-position in chlorins for efficient electron transfer to the CB.48 The extent of conjugation influences the relative energy of the π MOs. Additional π conjugation results in more orbitals, stabilizing the LUMO and destabilizing the HOMO, which together, reduces the HOMO–LUMO gap and results in a lower energy Q band. In M1 and M2, the presence of the thiophene and donor group result in this effect. Fig. 6B shows the energies of the frontier MOs. The most significant change introduced by the thiophene is shown in the analysis of the electron density surfaces (Fig. 7). In M1 and M2, the LUMO is thiophene-based, rather than the Gouterman LUMO. The Gouterman MOs are identified by their nodal patterns of four for the occupied MOs and five for the unoccupied MOs. Similar effects of the thiophene on the MO density surfaces have been previously reported.49,50 The fusing of an electron donor group on the opposite pyrrole in M2 introduces a donor-based MO between the typical Gouterman HOMO and HOMO−1 (shown in green in Fig. 6B). As expected, the donor group added electron density onto the ring and destabilized the HOMO of M2 when compared with M1, resulting in a larger ΔHOMO and smaller HOMO–LUMO gap. The energy of the unoccupied orbitals remained the same.

(MO 256, 257, 259–261 for M1 and MO 320, 322, 324–326 for M2). Surfaces are shown with an isovalue of 0.02. 
Impact of thiophene on the electronic structure of the fluorene substituted chlorin
In M1 and M2, the thiophene units altered the typical arrangement of the four Gouterman MOs. A thiophene-based MO is introduced below the usual Gouterman LUMO. This means that the thiophene-based MO becomes the LUMO in M1 (MO 258) and M2 (MO 323). In addition, three unoccupied MOs with 5 nodes are observed next before the second thiophene-based MO (MO 262 for M1 and MO 327 for M2).
With reference to the electron density surfaces (Fig. 7), we can see that the reason there are three Gouterman type unoccupied MOs with 5 nodes, is due to the presence of the thiophene groups conjugated to the fluorene. Taking the unoccupied MOs of M1 first, (i) MO 258 (LUMO) involves mainly the thiophene unit on the right side of the fluorene group. Changing the surface isovalue to 0.01 showed the presence of only small amounts of density on the ring (ESI,† Fig. S4). (ii) MO 259 consists of both left and right thiophene components conjugated over the entire ring, (iii) MO 260 consists primarily of the left fluorene conjugated over the ring, (iv) MO 261 involves mainly the right thiophene conjugated over the ring, and finally above the three π ring MOs, (v) MO 262 involves the entire thiophene group with no conjugation into the ring, like MO 258. Turning now to M2, we see the same electron density pattern from MO 323 to 327, indicating that the presence of the electron donor group does not result in major change to the unoccupied MOs.
In contrast to the similarity of the electron density distribution in the unoccupied MOs, the highest two occupied MOs for M1 and M2 are different because the electron donor MOs are involved. In M1, the typical tetrapyrrole a1u and a2u like MOs (MO 256, 257) are observed as the highest occupied. The three relatively isolated thiophene MOs are located just below these two highest occupied MOs (MO 255, 254, 253). In M2, however, the a1u like MO is the highest occupied but below this is the conjugated electron donor MO (321). The a2u orbital lies next and below this orbital are the thiophene-based MOs (MO 317 to 319). Clearly then, the conjugated electron donor energy has significant influence on the electronic structure of M2. As noted above, the donor group destabilizes the HOMO (322), thus raising its energy.
Spectral properties of the thiophene modified chlorins
The addition of thiophene groups on the fluorene group of Syn6 extended the π conjugation of the ring, reducing the HOMO–LUMO gap. The resulting Q band energy of M1 and M2 (Fig. 8) are more red-shifted than the Q band of Syn6. Attachment of the electron donor group in M2 further red-shifted the Q band to the computed value of 677 nm. Table 4 shows the electronic transitions that give rise to the Qx and Qy states of the two thiophene-substituted fictive chlorins. The lower and higher energy states are labeled as Q−1 and Q+1, respectively. A significant feature is that the Q states arise from transitions between six MOs for M1 and seven MOs for M2, which is unlike typical tetrapyrroles where the Q band arises solely from transitions between the four Gouterman MOs. In addition, similar to the three synthetic chlorins, multiple bands are observed in the B band region, which we characterize as part of the panchromatic properties of these molecules.

As mentioned before, unlike normal tetrapyrroles where the Q band arises from transitions between the nominally degenerate HOMOs (a1u, a2u) and the nominally degenerate LUMOs, the Q bands of M1 and M2 arise from transitions between HOMO (a1u), HOMO−1 (a2u) into the thiophene-based MO (MO 258 for M1 and MO 323 for M2) and the three unoccupied chlorin ring MOs (MO 259, 260, 261 for M1 and MO 324, 325, 326 for M2). The complexity of the Q band states have significant ramification for the optical properties as we will see in the trends to be discussed next.
Connecting experimental data with computational results
A successful set of trends were reported in 2005 that connected experimental Q band energy and its oscillator strength with computationally derived data.35Fig. 9 shows an updated version of these trends, using the CAM-B3LYP functional, and the data for the chlorins discussed here. Data for Chl a are included for comparison. These trends provide a connection between each molecule's electronic structure and its respective spectroscopic properties. The trends reported in 2005 clearly showed that the energy of the Q bands for those symmetric porphyrins and phthalocyanines included is proportional to the HOMO–LUMO gap and that the intensity of the Q bands (oscillator strength) is proportional to the magnitude of ΔHOMO.

In Fig. 9A, the observed Q band energy is plotted as a function of the HOMO–LUMO gap for a set of extended π conjugated porphyrins and phthalocyanines, together with the data for the three synthetic chlorins and the predicted Q band energies for M1 and M2. The data for M1 and M2 are extracted from the trend in Fig. 9C. Although Syn3, Syn6, Lie95, M1, and M2 are chlorins, their data lie closely around the trend line in Fig. 9A. The magnitude of the HOMO–LUMO gap is dependent on the functional used, however, the state energy should remain the same regardless of the functional used. The fact that the trend in Q band energy is so linear with the HOMO–LUMO gap indicates that the first excited state energy is dominated in these compounds by transitions from the HOMO to the LUMO, as predicted by the Gouterman model. It is significant that the experimental Q band energy can be predicted so well regardless of the form of tetrapyrrole involved. The substitution of thioketone (Syn3) and fluorene (Syn6) at the β-position of the chlorin stabilized the LUMO, resulting in a slightly smaller HOMO–LUMO gap than Chl a, red-shifting the Q band. The addition of thiophene units in the fictive chlorins stabilized the LUMO further and the extra donating group in M2 destabilized the HOMO as described above. The significantly red-shifted Q band and the presence of thiophene-based MOs between the Gouterman MOs make M2 a good dye candidate for DSSCs.

Fig. 9B shows the computationally derived oscillator strengths for the set of porphyrins and phthalocyanines together with the data for the three synthetic chlorins and M1 and M2. For the three synthetic chlorins and Chl a, the four Gouterman MOs appear conventional in their electron density distribution. Although the trend is based on the ΔHOMO value, the computed oscillator strength is dependent on the HOMO and LUMO composition. The calculated absorption spectra for the three synthetic chlorins closely match in relative absorbance the experimental spectra. Based on the computational results, we can estimate the molar absorption coefficient of the three experimental Q bands as approximately 80000 for Syn3 and Syn6, but 40000 for Lie95. As the trend in Fig. 9B indicates, these Q band absorbance are similar to zinc tetrabenzporphyrin (e.g. ZnTBP) and chlorophyll. Therefore, these three synthetic chlorins are good mimics of chlorophyll. The data in Fig. 9B for M1 and M2 show that the addition of thiophene greatly intensifies the red-shifted Q band. The M1 and M2 oscillator strengths lie well off the trend line, with Q band intensity much higher than even the phthalocyanines but with a much smaller magnitude of ΔHOMO.35 This unusual relationship is clearly a result of the transition complexity of the first excited state.

Fig. 9C shows the experimental Q band wavelength as a function of the calculated Q band wavelength for a set of chlorins previously synthesized and reported by Montforts, 7–10,31,51 along with the chlorins described in this paper. Although TD-DFT calculations overestimate the energy of the first excited state, which is responsible for the Q band, the linear trend line shows that this error is systematic. Using the trend line, the predicted experimental Q band wavelengths for the fictive chlorins, M1 and M2, were estimated to be 716 and 777 nm, respectively. These estimated experimental Q band energies were used for M1 and M2 in Fig. 9A. Clearly, the effect of the combined electron donor and acceptor substituents dramatically red-shifts and intensifies the Q band in M2.
Energy level alignment for efficient dye sensitization
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs depends on efficient electron transfer from the dye's excited state to the TiO2 conduction band and fast regeneration of the oxidized dye by the redox couple (I−/I3−).52 The ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) and the excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) provide a quantitative estimate of the efficiency of the electron transfer and regeneration. The GSOP of the dye should lie above the TiO2 conduction band and the ESOP of the dye should lie below the redox mediator (I−/I3−) by at least 0.2 eV for both.53 According to Koopman's Theorem, the GSOP could be approximated by the HOMO energy of the neutral species. The ESOP can then be approximated by adding the energy of the lowest excited state, E0–0, to the GSOP (in this case, the energy of the HOMO).54,55 The E0–0 can be obtained from the optical spectrum as the energy of the first excited state and can also be approximated by TD-DFT calculations. The TiO2 conduction band energy and I−/I3− redox couple potential used here are −4.0 eV and −4.8 eV, respectively.56

Fig. 10 shows the values of GSOP and ESOP for M1, M2, αPcS1, and αPcS2 with respect to the TiO2 conduction band energy and I−/I3− redox couple potential. αPcS1 and αPcS2 are previously studied phthalocyanines with a PCE of 5.5% and 3.8%, respectively, that involved thiophene substituents.26 Both the GSOP and ESOP of M1 and M2 align well with the CB and redox potential, suggesting efficient electron transfer and dye regeneration. The GSOPs of M1 and M2 were about 0.74 eV and 0.55 eV lower from the redox couple, respectively. The closer GSOP of M2 to the redox couple would make dye regeneration faster and possibly more efficient than M1. Fast reduction of the oxidized dye will reduce recombination from the first excited state back onto the ground state (we will describe the composition of the first excited state below). Their ESOPs were above the CB by about 0.45 eV. The black/purple lines shown in Fig. 10 follow the traditional procedures of using the HOMO energy and the calculated excited state energy from a single TD-DFT calculation to obtain the values for GSOP and ESOP. We can adjust the ESOP magnitudes using the estimated experimental value for the excited state energy of M1 and M2 from the trend in Fig. 9C (grey lines in Fig. 10). As expected, the experimental ESOP is lower in energy than the calculated ESOP, since TD-DFT overestimates the energy of the first excited state.

Grey lines show the ESOP value calculated using the experimental Q band energy. Their values are −3.81, −3.75, −3.84, and −3.71 eV for M1, M2, αPcS1, and αPcS2, respectively. 
Impact of the thiophene substituents on enhanced photosensitizer properties
A key aspect of the electron transfer, in addition to the matching of energies, is the presence of electron density on the acceptor group in the unoccupied MOs that forms the lowest excited state.45 As described above in Fig. 7, the LUMO for M1 and M2 both show electron density on the thiophene acceptor. The electron density on the next three unoccupied chlorin ring MOs also extends onto the thiophene. The presence of electron density on the thiophene facilitates the charge transfer process to the conduction band. The additional presence of the donor group in M2 introduces a dipole within the HOMO and LUMO which will further enhance electron transfer to the semiconductor. By way of contrast, the αPcS1 did provide panchromatic absorption but the thiophene-based MO was LUMO+2, which we consider reduced the electron transfer efficiency.
Conclusions
Three Ni-coordinated synthetic chlorins with β-substitution of thioketone (Syn3), fluorene (Syn6), and ketone (Lie95) were studied using MCD spectroscopy and DFT methods. The unusual MCD Faraday B band sign pattern of Syn3 and Lie95 was interpreted as being due to the quenching of the angular momentum of the chlorin B band states as a result of Ni-based transitions. Calculations were also performed on Zn-coordinated Syn3, Syn6, and Lie95 to identify Ni-dependent optical bands. Although the Zn- and Ni-coordinated chlorins exhibited similar theoretical absorption spectra, the unfilled d-orbitals of the Ni2+ introduced charge transfer and d–d transitions in addition to the typical transitions between the Gouterman MOs. Depending on the nature of the electron withdrawing or electron donating properties of the β-substituents, the Gouterman MOs are stabilized or destabilized, respectively. The three substituents in these chlorins were all electron withdrawing and as a result, both occupied and unoccupied MOs were lower in energy than the unsubstituted chlorin. In addition, the substituents reduced the HOMO–LUMO gap, resulting in red-shifts of the Q band with respect to both the Zn- and Ni-coordinated chlorin.
While the three synthetic chlorins showed the intense red Q bands necessary for dye sensitization in DSSCs, they lack an anchor that will connect them to the semiconductor. Of the three chlorins, the fluorene substituted Syn6 offered a connection site for the thiophene units. Based on this structure, M1 was designed with just the thiophene bonded to the fluorene and M2 included a thiophene and a donor group on the opposite pyrrole. The substitution with the thiophene units introduced a thiophene-based MO between the typical Gouterman HOMO and LUMO and generated three unoccupied ring π MOs (e.g. MO 259, 260, and 261 for M1) instead of the usual two. The additional donor group in M2 introduced a donor-based MO between the usual Gouterman HOMO and HOMO−1. The electron donating effect of the donor group destabilized the HOMO and brought it closer to the LUMO. Despite the relatively small ΔHOMO, M1 and M2 exhibited a remarkably intense Q band. The panchromatic absorption observed from the theoretical absorption spectra, the intense and red-shifted Q band, and the presence of the donor-, thiophene-based MO properties of M2 make it a possible candidate for application in DSSCs.
