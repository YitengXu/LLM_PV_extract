    , Accepted 17th August 2019First published on 19th August 2019AbstractThe construction of three-dimensional (3D) photonic micro/nanostructures is regarded as one of the most promising approaches to develop highly efficient photoelectrodes for solar water splitting. Here, we report the design and fabrication of an indium tin oxide glass with 3D micro concave-pit arrays (MCPAs) as an effective photonic substrate for dramatically enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Compared with the planar counterpart, more than three-fold photocurrent density can be obtained for the 3D photoelectrodes with In2S3 nanosheet arrays grown on the inner surfaces of the MCPAs, mainly ascribable to their largely improved light trapping ability and increased surface area for charge separation and extraction. The PEC performance is further elevated by constructing an effective In2S3/ZnO heterojunction to accelerate the photocarrier separation. As a result, the 3D MCPA-based photoanodes demonstrate a maximum incident photon to current efficiency of 11.7% at 380 nm, which is about four times higher than that of the planar counterpart. The significant advancement demonstrated here provides a facile and low-cost route for the large-scale fabrication of 3D photonic electrodes aiming to achieve highly efficient PEC water splitting.
Introduction
In recent decades, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been arousing enormous interest among scientists around the world as one of the most efficient approaches to store solar energy by producing carbon-free fuel hydrogen (H2) from water in a renewable and eco-friendly manner.1–5 In general, a PEC process for water splitting mainly involves absorption of sunlight with a semiconductor photoelectrode to generate electron–hole pairs and the following charge separation and transfer into the electrolyte for water reduction or oxidation.6–8 Accordingly, the design of a photoelectrode with excellent light trapping ability as well as prominent photocarrier collection efficiency can largely determine the ultimate energy conversion efficiency in the PEC process.9–11
To realize the aforementioned favorable characteristics, most of the research studies in the past focused on engineering nanoarray morphologies for the PEC active materials, such as one-dimensional (1D) nanowire/nanorod/nanotube arrays and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet/nanoplate/nanoflake arrays.12–16 Compared with their planar counterparts, it is believed that the nanoarray structures not only have the advantages of ideal geometry for abundant sunlight absorption and efficient charge separation, but also possess a large surface area for fast carrier collection.17–20 Furthermore, hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) nanoarray structures with a variety of morphologies, which are constructed from 1D and/or 2D nanostructured blocks, have also been developed to further enhance the light trapping ability and specific surface area of photoelectrodes.21–25 In spite of the various advantages mentioned above, the 3D nanoarchitectures will also bring about remarkably increased defects on the surfaces of semiconductor active materials, which easily become centers for the recombination of photocarriers.26 Although surface passivation has generally been adopted to suppress the recombination process, only limited progress has been achieved so far.27 A promising solution to this dilemma is to design 3D ordered conductive substrates for the construction of PEC active materials. It is proved that a 3D photonic substrate itself can serve as not only a light scattering architecture for enhanced photon capture, but also a direct transportation network for highly efficient charge collection.27–29 This scheme also has the ability to decouple the competition between optical absorption length and carrier diffusion distance, especially for the active materials with relatively short diffusion length of minority carrier.
Although various hierarchical 3D semiconductor nanostructures have been developed for enhancing light absorption and charge separation, relatively few studies have been reported to explore 3D photonic electrodes for the modification of nanostructured active materials.30–32 Typically, template-assisted methods, such as anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) templates, have been used to engineer 3D photonic nanostructures (e.g., nanospike, nanocone and nanowell arrays).26,28,33 Despite their proven feasibilities for the direct growth of target materials, the following chemical etching procedure may give rise to unexpected damage to the semiconductor active layers. Although the AAO template pattern can be transferred onto another flexible substrate such as polydimethylsiloxane, the obtained organic 3D nanoarchitectures are unstable under high temperature environments. The nature of flexible organic substrates certainly narrows the range for the deposition of active materials, which largely limits their applications as photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting. Yang et al. introduced the fabrication of 3D hexagonal nanocone arrays of fluorine-doped tin oxide on glasses by combining the techniques of the AAO template and hot-joining, demonstrating greatly improved PEC performance.26 However, the complex and high-cost manufacturing process is not beneficial for the large-scale fabrication of uniform 3D micro/nanostructured electrodes applied in PEC cells. Fan et al. developed Al nanospike arrays as an excellent 3D conductive electrode for PEC water splitting.28 However, this kind of electrode cannot tolerate either acidic or basic chemical environments, which remains a challenge for long term applications. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a low-cost method for the large-scale fabrication of 3D photonic electrodes with high stability in harsh thermal and chemical environments.34
Herein, we introduce the design and fabrication of 3D micro concave-pit arrays (MCPAs) on glasses by a typical micro-fabrication technique, which are proved to be efficient photonic substrates as electrodes for PEC water splitting after the modification of a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) layer. As a promising photoanode active material with a narrow bandgap of 2.0–2.3 eV for visible light absorption, In2S3 nanosheet arrays were grown on the photonic electrodes to construct hierarchical 3D photoanodes through a facile solvothermal process.35–38 A thin ZnO layer was then uniformly deposited on the surfaces of In2S3 nanosheets by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method to accelerate the photocarrier separation because of the formation of In2S3/ZnO heterojunction. Furthermore, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation was conducted to understand the microscopic details underlying the elevated light trapping capability of the MCPA-based electrodes over their corresponding planar counterparts. Importantly, we have systematically investigated the dramatically enhanced PEC performance of the 3D MCPA-based photoanodes for water splitting.
Experimental section
Fabrication of 3D MCPA-based electrodes
As illustrated in Scheme 1, a typical micro-fabrication technique was used to prepare 3D MCPA-based electrodes. Firstly, a cleaned optical glass wafer (3 inches) was coated with a thin Cr/Cu (50 nm/200 nm) metal film by magnetron sputtering, and then covered with a positive photoresist layer (3 μm) through a spin-coating process. Secondly, the Cr/Cu film with periodic circular pores could be formed on the planar glass using patterned photoresist film as a mask for argon ion etching of the uncovered metal layer. The photoresist film mask was cleaned off by soaking the glass wafer in acetone for several minutes. The pore diameter (d) and period (L) are 2 and 10 μm, respectively. Thirdly, a MCPA glass with a pitch (D) of 10 μm could be obtained using 15% HF solution to etch the glass with a patterned Cr/Cu film as the mask, which was then removed by a mixture of HClO4, Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 and H2O with a mass proportion of 6:9:85. Finally, a 3D MCPA-based electrode was realized by the deposition of a thin ITO film with a thickness of ∼550 nm via magnetron sputtering.

Growth of In2S3/ZnO heterojunction nanosheet arrays on MCPA-based electrodes
A facile solvothermal method was adopted for the growth of In2S3 nanosheet arrays on both the 3D MCPA-based electrode and its planar counterpart, denoted as In2S3@MCPAs and In2S3@Planar, respectively. As a typical process, a piece of substrate was put into a Teflon autoclave (100 mL), and then immersed with 40 mL InCl3·4H2O (24 mM) and thioacetamide (63 mM) ethylene glycol solution.13,35 For uniform micromorphology, the substrate, facing down, was angled against the vessel wall. Next, the sealed autoclave was transferred into an oven heated at 200 °C, and naturally cooled to room temperature after a 2 h reaction process. Finally, the as-prepared samples were washed with deionized water and ethanol several times to eliminate the residual substances, and then dried at 70 °C under atmospheric conditions, when a yellow film could be observed on the surfaces of the substrates, indicating the successful growth of In2S3 nanosheet arrays.
The ALD method was used to realize the conformal modification of the ZnO layer on the surfaces of In2S3 nanosheet arrays (denoted as In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs and In2S3/ZnO@Planar for 3D and planar photoelectrodes, respectively). A typical ZnO deposition cycle includes four processes of 0.1 s diethylzinc pulse, 3 s N2 purge, 0.1 s H2O pulse and 4 s N2 purge.13 The growth rate of the ZnO layer at 150 °C is about 0.2 nm per cycle. The thickness of the ZnO layer on the In2S3 nanosheets was set to be 50 nm.
Characterization studies
A field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Ultra 55, Carl Zeiss, Germany) was adopted to observe the micromorphology for all of the samples. A transmission electron microscope (TEM, Talos F200X, FEI, USA) operating at 200 kV was used to characterize the detailed micromorphology and microstructure of the ZnO-decorated In2S3 nanosheets as well as the pristine In2S3. A 3D profiler was used to profile the optical morphologies of the pristine MCPA glass and In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs (ZYGO, NewView 9000, USA). The crystal structures of In2S3 and In2S3/ZnO heterojunction nanosheet arrays grown on MCPA electrodes were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an advanced X-ray diffractometer (D8 Avance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm), working at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the heterostructured In2S3/ZnO nanosheets were recorded using a Japan Kratos Axis UltraDLD spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). The optical properties including transmission, reflection and absorption were evaluated using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer, USA).
FDTD simulations
A 3D FDTD model (Lumerical Solutions Ltd) was employed to simulate the near-field intensities around the surfaces of MCPAs modified with ITO, In2S3 and In2S3/ZnO layers compared to those of the planar counterparts. To simplify the FDTD model, the nanostructured morphologies of In2S3 and In2S3/ZnO nanosheet arrays have been ignored, which doesn't have much influence on investigating the optical difference between planar and MCPA substrates.26 The film thicknesses of ITO, In2S3 and ZnO used in the FDTD simulations are 550, 1000 and 50 nm, respectively. Electromagnetic field distributions were calculated using plane wave polarized light with a wavelength of 500 nm along the z-axis for MCPAs (D = 10 μm) compared to those of the planar samples. The electric field distributions were obtained using a plane monitor placed parallel to the x–z plane with passing the sphere center of pit hemispheres.
PEC measurements
For convenient PEC measurement, the as-prepared sample was fixed onto a glass slide using a piece of double-faced adhesive tape, and then one metal end of a straight enameled copper wire was connected to the ITO layer of the sample using conductive silver paint. Both the metal connection point and the edge of the photosensitive film were sealed with an epoxy resin to prevent photocurrent leakage in the following PEC tests.19 The measurements were conducted using a PEC test system consisting of an electrochemical working station (CHI 650E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd) and a solar simulator (CHF-XM500, Beijing Perfectlight) equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp and an AM 1.5G filter. A three-electrode scheme was used to characterize the PEC properties, in which the sample, Pt mesh and an Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode (RE), respectively, and the electrolyte used was 1.0 M KCl aqueous solution (pH = 5.97). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) tests were performed in the frequency range of 100 kHz–0.1 Hz under a sinusoidal perturbation with an amplitude of 5 mV.
In the PEC characterization studies, the potentials were presented in the scale of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by converting the measured potentials versus Ag/AgCl RE using the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + E0(1)where ERHE, EAg/AgCl and E0 are the converted potential versus RHE, the measured potential against Ag/AgCl RE and the standard potential of Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) at 25 °C (i.e., 0.197), respectively.19
The photoconversion efficiency (η) was obtained via the following equation: η = I(1.23 − VRHE)/Pin(2)where I, VRHE (V vs. RHE) and Pin represent the photocurrent density, bias voltage and incoming light flux (100 mW cm−2), respectively.
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was conducted at a bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE under monochromatic light illumination, which was calculated using the following equation: IPCE = (1240I)/(λPlight)(3)where λ is the incident light wavelength (nm), I and Plight are the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and power density (mW cm−2) at a specific monochromatic light, respectively.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the optical image of a MCPA-based glass wafer with a size of 3 inches, on which colourful stripes can be observed due to the reflection of sunlight by the periodic microstructures. The photonic microstructures can be proved by the ordered diffraction pattern under the irradiation of a red-light laser (Fig. 1b) and the 3D optical microprofile for the MCPAs glass (Fig. 1c). Various SEM images of a MCPA glass further demonstrate the successful fabrication of periodic micro concave pits with uniform 3D morphologies and smooth surfaces by a traditional micromachining technique (Fig. 1d–f). The inset of Fig. 1f is the corresponding schematic diagram. The pitch of MCPAs is ∼10 μm, which is consistent with the designed value. The cross-sectional SEM image of MCPAs shows that the depth of a micro concave pit is about 3.4 μm (Fig. 1f), which is much smaller than half of the pitch, i.e. 5 μm. It can be ascribed to a relatively bigger pore ratio of the Cr/Cu mask. Next, 3D MCPA-based electrodes can be obtained by the surface modification of a thin ITO layer with a thickness of ∼550 nm (Fig. S1†) via magnetron sputtering. It can be observed that the ITO film is very uniform and smooth, and doesn't have much influence on the 3D concave pit array morphologies (Fig. S2†). The above method is believed to be beneficial for the large-scale fabrication of conductive MCPA glasses due to the mature microfabrication technique along with its simple processing steps, resulting in relatively lower manufacturing cost compared with other methods for designing 3D ordered substrates applied in the areas of PEC water splitting. Additionally, the nature of glass endows the corresponding electrodes with the capability of high stability in harsh thermal and chemical environments. The top-view SEM image, as shown in Fig. 1g, suggests that a thin nanostructured In2S3 film can be conformably grown on the surfaces of 3D MCPA-based electrodes through a facile solvothermal process. It can be found in the further refined morphology characterization that the In2S3 film consists of vertically oriented and interconnected 2D graphene-like nanosheets with sizes of several hundreds of nanometers (inset, Fig. 1g). The cross-sectional SEM image of the planar counterpart suggests that the film thickness of the In2S3 layer is about 1.0 μm (Fig. S3†). A ZnO layer with a thickness of 50 nm was conformally modified on the surfaces of In2S3 nanosheet arrays to form nanostructured heterojunctions by a thermal ALD process at 150 °C (Fig. 1h and the inset). Their hierarchical 3D morphologies have been confirmed by the optical microprofile, as shown in Fig. 1i. Their corresponding cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 1j and k) further demonstrate the uniform growth of heterostructured In2S3/ZnO nanosheet arrays on a 3D MCPA-based electrode.

The XRD patterns as shown in Fig. S4† exhibit two weak diffraction peaks of cubic β-In2S3 (JCPDS no. 32-0456) at 27.5 and 28.8° corresponding to the (311) and (222) crystal planes, respectively.35 After the decoration of the ZnO layer with a thickness of 50 nm, distinct diffraction peaks centered at 31.7, 34.4 and 36.3° can be observed, which are indexed to the (100), (002) and (101) crystal planes of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS no. 36-1451), respectively.13 The above XRD results further demonstrate the successful growth of heterostructured In2S3/ZnO nanosheet arrays on 3D MCPA-based electrodes as photoanodes for PEC water splitting.
TEM was used to further characterize the micromorphology and microstructure of the In2S3/ZnO heterojunction nanosheets compared with those of the pristine In2S3 sample. The low-magnification TEM images in Fig. 2a1–a2 reveal that the In2S3 nanosheets showing graphene-like morphology are connected with each other. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the cross-section of an In2S3 nanosheet (inset, Fig. 2a3) demonstrates a fringe spacing of 0.31 nm, indicating its preferentially exposed (222) facets.35,37,38 Accordingly, the ultrathin nanosheet thickness of ∼3.6 nm (Fig. 2a2) corresponds to the duodenary interplanar spacing of the (222) plane of cubic In2S3. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern suggests that an In2S3 nanosheet is composed of nanocrystal grains (Fig. 2a4). To clearly characterize the heterojunction by TEM, a thin ZnO layer with a nominal thickness of 5 nm was deposited on the surfaces of In2S3 nanosheets. After the modification of ZnO, the surfaces of nanosheets become rougher compared with their pristine counterparts (Fig. 2b1), and obvious ZnO nanocrystals with sizes of several nanometers can be observed, as indicated by the white arrows in Fig. 2b2. A typical HRTEM image of ZnO nanocrystalline grown on the In2S3 nanosheet exhibits a lattice spacing of ∼0.28 nm corresponding to the interplanar spacing of the (100) plane of hexagonal ZnO (inset, Fig. 2b3), which is confirmed by analyzing the corresponding SAED pattern (Fig. 2b4). The results are consistent with the XRD characterization, where the strongest diffraction peak appears at 2θ of 31.7° for the (100) plane of ZnO. The elemental mapping of a heterostructured nanosheet suggests that ZnO nanocrystallines are distributed uniformly on the In2S3 matrix (Fig. 2c1–c4).

To get a further insight into the formation of heterojunction, XPS of this heterostructured In2S3/ZnO sample was conducted to analyse their surface compositions and valence states. The full XPS spectrum indicates the existence of In, S, Zn and O elements, further elucidating the successful fabrication of In2S3/ZnO nanosheet arrays on 3D MCPA-based electrodes (Fig. S5†). The high-resolution XPS spectrum of In 3d exhibits two distinct peaks positioned at 452.4 and 444.8 eV corresponding to In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2 in In2S3 with the In valence state of +3, respectively (Fig. 2d1).35 The binding energies of S 2p presented in Fig. 2d2 can be fitted to two peaks centered at 162.7 and 161.5 eV, which can be indexed to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 in In2S3, respectively. The Zn 2p core peaks appearing at 1044.9 and 1021.9 eV are consistent with Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 for the formal Zn2+ valence state in ZnO, respectively (Fig. 2d3).39 As shown in Fig. 2d4, the XPS curve of O 1s can be split into two peaks located at 530.6 and 532.0 eV, which can be attributed to the lattice oxygen of ZnO and chemisorbed oxygen caused by the surface hydroxyl groups, respectively.39 The existence of adsorbed oxygen on the surfaces of In2S3/ZnO nanosheets is also confirmed by the result of elemental mapping in which the distribution area of the O element is much bigger than that of the Zn element (Fig. 2c3–c4).
Furthermore, FDTD simulations were conducted to understand the microscopic details underlying the elevated light trapping capability of the pristine 3D MCPA-based electrode along with that modified with single In2S3 and heterostructured In2S3/ZnO active layers (In2S3@MCPAs and In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs, respectively) over their corresponding planar counterparts (In2S3@Planar and In2S3/ZnO@Planar, respectively).26,28,30Fig. 3 presents the comparative cross-sectional electric field (|E|) distributions of the electromagnetic wave mapped at 500 nm, where the red colour hot area represents high photon capture. As the incident light conducts multiple scattering inside the micro concave pits, the electromagnetic wave will re-distribute and then lead to a significant electric field enhancement around the 3D microstructures. It can be observed that all of the MCPA-based samples exhibit an obvious hot area around the bottom of the concave pit compared with the corresponding planar pit, indicating the significant enhancement of light trapping ability by using the 3D conductive glasses as photoelectrodes.30 Additionally, the electric field has also been increased apparently after the modification of In2S3 as the active material on the 3D MCPA-based electrodes, especially at the interfaces between In2S3 and ITO layers (Fig. 3a2–b2). However, no distinct light absorption enhancement can be observed for In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs after the modification of the ZnO layer on In2S3 (Fig. 3b2–c2), which can be ascribed to the relatively big bandgap of ZnO (∼3.2 eV).
 Fig. 3  Cross-sectional electric field (|E|) distributions of FDTD simulations at a wavelength of 500 nm for the ITO thin film (550 nm) on (a1) planar and (a2) 3D MCPA-based glasses, the In2S3 film (1.0 μm) on (b1) planar and (b2) 3D MCPA-based electrodes, and the heterostructured In2S3/ZnO film (ZnO: 50 nm) on (c1) planar and (c2) 3D MCPA-based electrodes. 
The light absorption ability (A) in the wavelength range of 350–850 nm for In2S3 nanosheet arrays grown on both planar and 3D MCPA-based electrodes were characterized by measuring their corresponding transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) values according to the relationship of T + R + A = 100%. Compared with their planar counterparts (In2S3@Planar), the sample of In2S3@MCPAs exhibits remarkably decreased transmittance and reflectance (Fig. S6†), which results in greatly enhanced performance for light absorption due to the excellent light-harvesting properties of the 3D photonic microstructures of MCPAs (Fig. 4a). With the incident light of 500 nm, the absorption has been increased from 39.3% for the planar sample to 82.1% for In2S3@MCPAs. The biggest light absorption of In2S3@MCPAs can reach to as high as 92.2% at 420 nm.

The outstanding light trapping capability of the 3D photonic microstructures is highly beneficial for solar energy conversion devices, such as photovoltaic cells and photochemical conversion devices.28 Herein, we have investigated the PEC performance of the 3D MCPA-based devices with a nanostructured In2S3 film as the active material for solar water splitting compared to their planar counterparts. Fig. 4b presents the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for the samples of In2S3 nanosheet arrays grown on planar and 3D MCPA-based electrodes under dark and AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination conditions. The measured dark currents are negligible as the bias potential is lower than 1.3 V vs. RHE. Obvious photocurrent can be observed under light irradiation, demonstrating the efficient generation and separation of photoelectrons at the interfaces of the photosensitive material and electrolyte. The increasing photocurrent with a positive shift in the bias potential proves the n-type semiconductor characteristic of the grown In2S3 nanosheet arrays. The 3D sample of In2S3@MCPAs shows a photocurrent density of 25.7 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 3.5 times higher than that of their planar counterparts (7.2 μA cm−2). Their amperometric I–t curves at 1.23 V vs. RHE under chopped AM 1.5G illumination are presented in Fig. 4c, in which both of the planar and 3D samples demonstrate a prompt photocurrent with good repeatability under each illumination, suggesting their excellent switching behaviour as well as good stability for PEC water splitting without using any sacrificial agent. Besides, a more than three-fold photocurrent has been realized by using the 3D photonic glass as the substrate for the growth of In2S3 nanosheet arrays. As illustrated in Fig. 4d, the photoconversion efficiency of In2S3@MCPAs compared with that of In2S3@Planar can be calculated from their corresponding LSV curves as shown in Fig. 4b according to eqn (2). The MCPAs and planar-based photoanodes exhibit optimal photoconversion efficiencies of about 0.02% and 0.006% at 0.1 V vs. RHE, respectively.
To further optimize the PEC performance of the 3D MCPA-based photoelectrodes, a conformal ZnO layer with a thickness of 50 nm was modified on the surfaces of In2S3 nanosheet arrays by an ALD method. The engineered In2S3/ZnO heterojunction is expected to accelerate the separation and transfer of the photocarrier with reducing the recombination of unstable photogenerated electron–hole pairs.13,35Fig. 5a shows the LSV curves of In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs under dark and AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination conditions compared to those of their planar counterparts. Obviously, the sample of In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs exhibits an enhanced photocurrent density of 420 μA cm−2 at 1.55 V vs. RHE, which demonstrates a 3.5 times increase compared with the planar counterparts (120 μA cm−2). Fig. 5b exhibits the contrastive I–t curves of In2S3/ZnO@Planar and In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs at 1.23 V vs. RHE under chopped AM 1.5G illumination, further proving the promoted PEC performance for the 3D MCPA-based electrode as well as their outstanding switching behaviour as a photoanode. Their optimal photoconversion efficiencies are 0.02% and 0.08% for In2S3/ZnO@Planar and In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs, respectively (Fig. 5c). Based on eqn (3), their IPCE spectra have been characterized at 1.23 V vs. RHE under monochromatic irradiation. As illustrated in Fig. 5d, both samples exhibit a relatively higher IPCE performance in the short-wavelength region, which can be attributed to the relatively bigger band gap for both In2S3 and ZnO. The sample of In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs exhibits a maximum IPCE of 11.7% at 380 nm, which is 4.2 times higher than that of the In2S3/ZnO@Planar (2.8%).

To explore the reason for the outstanding PEC performance of the 3D MCPA-based photoanodes, the optical properties of heterostructured In2S3/ZnO nanosheet arrays grown on both planar and MCPA electrodes were also characterized (Fig. 5e, Fig. S7†). The results suggest that the sample of In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs exhibits suppressed transmittance and reflectance and then greatly elevated absorptance compared with their planar counterparts. In addition, only slightly increased light absorption can be observed after the modification of ZnO on the nanostructured In2S3 photoelectrodes. It proves that the remarkably improved PEC performance for the heterostructured In2S3/ZnO photoanodes compared with their single In2S3 counterparts mainly results from the promoted charge separation and transfer abilities because of the formed n–n-type heterojunction.13 As shown in Fig. 5f, the EIS spectrum of In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs was obtained compared with that of In2S3/ZnO@Planar to further evaluate its enhanced ability for interface charge transfer. The corresponding equivalent circuit is presented in the inset of Fig. 5f, in which Rs, Rct and CPE are the contact resistance between the photosensitive material (In2S3/ZnO) and the current collector substrate (ITO glass), the charge transfer resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and the constant phase element, respectively. The much lower Rs value of In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs (41.6 Ω cm2) than that of In2S3/ZnO@Planar (380.7 Ω cm2) implies the facile charge transport realized by relatively shorter migration path through the In2S3/ZnO active material directly coming in contact with the 3D ITO current collector. Additionally, the 3D MCPA-based photoanode shows a smaller diameter of the semicircle at the high frequency region in the Nyquist plot compared with the planar counterpart, which represents its lower Rct value (101.6 and 181.2 kΩ cm2 for In2S3/ZnO@MCPAs and In2S3/ZnO@Planar, respectively). The results indicate that the increased contact surface area for the 3D photoelectrode can accelerate the transportation of photogenerated holes from the active material to electrolyte for water oxidation.
Based on the above results, a schematic diagram was proposed to illustrate the PEC water splitting mechanism and charge transport process in the hierarchical 3D In2S3/ZnO@MCPA photoanode. As shown in Scheme 2, the incident light can be efficiently trapped in the hierarchical 3D photonic photoelectrode via multiple scattering of light inside the micro concave-pits, which will considerably increase the light absorption ability for the active material, i.e., In2S3/ZnO heterojunction nanosheet arrays. The absorbed photons will then motivate the generation of electron–hole pairs. With the assistance of the external bias potential, a majority of holes transfer from the valence band maximum (EVBM) of In2S3 to that of ZnO, and then to the electrolyte for water oxidation. The produced electrons left on the conduction band minimum (ECBM) move towards the ITO back contact, and then to the Pt counter electrode through the outer circuit for hydrogen generation. It is noted that the band alignment between In2S3 and ZnO plays a critical role in the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers.13 As the band edges (EVBM and ECBM) and the Fermi level of ZnO are higher than those of In2S3, respectively, the electrons will transfer from the former to the latter, resulting in the formation of a built-in electric field with the direction pointing from ZnO to In2S3 in the formed In2S3/ZnO heterojunction. The built-in potential (VD) can be expressed as eqn (4): qVD = qVD1 + qVD2(4)where VD1, VD2 and q represent the built-in potentials on the side of In2S3 and ZnO of the heterojunction and the electron charge, respectively.13 The amounts of downward and upward bending for the band edges of In2S3 and ZnO at the interfaces of heterojunction are qVD1 and qVD2, respectively. When a positive bias potential (V) is applied onto the heterojunction (V1 and V2 for the sides of In2S3 and ZnO, respectively, V = V1 + V2), the potential barriers on both sides of In2S3 and ZnO will be decreased to q(VD1 − V1) and q(VD2 − V2), respectively. The reduced barrier will benefit the transfer of photogenerated carriers and ultimately enhance the PEC performance. In addition, the 3D MCPA-based photonic microstructures for the growth of In2S3/ZnO nanosheet arrays provide a greatly increased electrode/electrolyte contact area for fast charge extraction.

Conclusions
We have introduced a method for the construction of single In2S3 and In2S3/ZnO heterojunction nanosheet arrays on 3D MCPA-based photonic substrates as photoanodes for PEC water splitting. The remarkably enhanced PEC performance can be mainly attributed to the periodic micro concave-pit structures for largely improved light absorption and an increased semiconductor/electrolyte interface area for charge collection. The results of FDTD simulation suggest that the MCPA-based electrodes exhibit an obvious hot area around the bottom of the concave pit compared with their corresponding planar counterparts, demonstrating the significant enhancement of light trapping ability for the 3D photonic substrates. The hierarchical 3D In2S3/ZnO@MCPA photoanodes exhibit a maximum IPCE of 11.7% at 380 nm, which is about four times higher than that of their planar counterparts. It is believed that this work is significant to the research and development of high-performance PEC cells.
