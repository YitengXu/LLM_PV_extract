1 Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) comprising donor (D) : acceptor (A) bulk-heterojunction structures have drawn much attention due to their superiority for fabricating flexible solar panels through low-cost solution processing technologies.1–3 Benefiting from the development of various new OPV materials, especially non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPV cells have boosted over 19%.4–6 In the early stage of OPV development, electron acceptors were dominated by fullerenes and their derivatives with spherical geometry facilitating isotropic electron transport.7–9 However, the poor absorption and the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital limit their access to high short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage.10,11 To address these shortcomings, NFAs were developed; however their efficiencies lag behind that of fullerene systems. In 2015, Zhan et al. synthesized a new A–D–A-structured acceptor, i.e., ITIC, which makes it possible for NFAs to achieve high efficiencies.12,13 Since then, much effort has been devoted to the development of new NFAs to improve the efficiencies of OPV cells.14–18 In 2019, a new NFA, i.e., Y6, based on N-hetero-fused-ring building blocks was designed by Zou et al., which realized a higher PCE.5,6,19 In addition, the cost issue of photoactive materials has received more and more attention. The high synthesis complexity and production cost of these acceptors hinder their large-scale synthesis and commercial application.20–22 Therefore, the strategy of designing NFAs featuring simple structures and facile synthesis was proposed.23,24 At present, the PCEs based on non-fused ring acceptors have surpassed 15%, indicating their great potential.25,26
In terms of molecular design, the state-of-the-art NFAs comprise an electron-rich central core and two electron-deficient end groups (EGs).27 The absorption spectra and energy levels are finely regulated by modulating the intramolecular charge transfer effect between the central core and the EGs. The planar and rigid core facilitates π-electron delocalization and intramolecular charge transport. Moreover, the bulk alkyl groups on the central core ensure good solubility, which additionally avoid excessive aggregation of the central core in the solid state.11,28–30 However, it's more complicated to design non-fused acceptors. The introduction of multiple single bonds increases the probability of rotation of the molecular backbone, which is unfavourable to achieve ordered molecular packing.31–33 Currently, the rotation of single bonds can be restricted by the incorporation of large steric hindrance34 and noncovalent interactions, such as O⋯S, N⋯S, H⋯S and F⋯S. In this way, a rigid and coplanar backbone can be formed.23,24,35,36 Therefore, exploring the correlation between solid-state molecular packing and charge transport properties in these fused-ring and non-fused ring molecules is of great significance to understand physicochemical properties in active layers and design new materials with a low cost for the development of OPV cells. In this review, we have summarized the recent advances in the study of single crystals of A–D–A-type and A–DAD–A-type acceptors. The relationship between molecular design, packing patterns and their corresponding properties is discussed in detail. Finally, we review the challenges for molecule design toward practical applications.
2 Relationships of molecular design and packing structures in NFAs
2.1 A–D–A-type fuse-ring NFAs with revealed single crystals
In 2015, the development of a high-performance A–D–A type NFA, ITIC, enabled a dramatic increase in the efficiencies of OPV cells. Single crystal X-ray diffraction is considered to be an important technique to understand packing arrangement and molecular properties in the solid state. The effects of chemical modifications on molecular self-assembly were summarized. The molecular structures discussed below are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The summarized structures of NFAs with revealed single crystals. 
Liu et al. investigated the crystalline structure change upon different chemical modifications including the central core and the end groups.37 The chemical structures of ITIC, TRID, SRID, IT4F, TRID-4F, and SRID-4F are illustrated Fig. 1. Compared to ITIC, TRID and SRID are selenium modified on the central core at different positions. IT4F, TRID-4F, and SRID-4F are their fluorinated derivatives. For the single crystals of these molecules, four interactions, including π–π stacking, hydrogen bonding (C–H⋯N, C–H⋯O and S–F), and S–π interaction between two central groups, and side-chain interaction are the driving force for the molecular packing. For ITIC, TRID and SRID, they show only a head-to-head brickwork arrangement and form twisted 2D brickwork structures (Fig. 2a–c). For IT4F, TRID-4F, and SRID-4F, the fluorination of the end groups enhances the packing energies of π–π interactions. As seen in IT4F, π–π stacking and hydrogen bonding induce 1D chains and 2D layers. They form 3D structures through S–π interactions (Fig. 2d). For TRID-4F and SRED-4F, the π–π stacking is stronger, and the Se at different positions on the central core leads to a change in the π–π stacking direction. In the TRID-4F single crystals, the molecules tend to form a π–π stacking column and then induce a 3D structure (Fig. 2e). While for SRED-4F, linear π–π stacking dominates and forms a 2D brickwork structure (Fig. 2f). The position of the modification has a significant impact on the π–π packing and the crystalline structures. In addition, hydrogen bonding interaction plays a vital role in the crystalline packing structure. In ITIC single crystals, no obvious hydrogen bonding can be found. With the introduction of Se atoms into the central core or halogen atoms into the end groups, hydrogen bonds are formed and further induce the formation of 2D assemblies. Hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking together affect the crystal structure.

In addition to ITIC and its derivatives, the crystal structures of other A–D–A type electron acceptors have also been investigated. In 2019, Zhan et al. synthesized four NFAs (NOICs) based on naphthalene-fused octacyclic cores (Fig. 1).38 They explored the effect of different methoxy positions on the central core on molecular packing. The four NFAs exhibit planar backbones due to the S⋯O interactions between the core and the end groups. The distance of S⋯O interactions is ∼2.7 Å. In terms of molecular stacking patterns, the intermolecular π–π interactions in the adjacent D–A moieties (including partial core and the end group) induce the formation of a 3D network in NOIC (Fig. 3a). For the other three NFAs based on the introduction of methoxy groups at different positions, their conformations and packing arrangements are different. With the incorporation of methoxy groups at the (4,8) positions, four independent molecular conformations are observed in NOIC1 (Fig. 3b). The molecules of the four different configurations are stacked in orthogonal directions to form a 3D structure. For NOIC2 with methoxy groups at the (3,7) positions, multiple S⋯O interactions are formed and are conducive to a planar backbone. The stacking pattern of NOIC2 is similar to that of NOIC, except that the stacking of the end groups increases (Fig. 3c). For NOIC3, covalent cyclization of oxygen destroys the coplanarity of the central core and leads to a more complex packing pattern (Fig. 3d).

In addition to the above mentioned, Zheng et al. developed a series of NFAs (M-series) based on ladder-type heteroheptacene without sp3-hybridized bridging atoms.39 They investigated the crystalline structure change of the heteroheptacene-based NFAs with different fluorinated terminal groups. The chemical structures and the crystal structures of the three NFAs are shown in Fig. 1 and 4. The torsion angles between the core and the end groups are ∼1.8°, ∼9.52°, and 5,17° for ML-2FM, ML-1F and ML-2FP, respectively. A smaller torsion angle in the former indicates a more planar backbone. ML-1F displays partial overlaps between the core of one molecule and the end groups of the adjacent molecule. The π–π packing distances are 3.36 and 3.65 Å, respectively. Meanwhile, π–π stacking with distances of 3.22 and 3.34 Å between two molecules is also observed. The π–π intermolecular interactions and coordinated CN⋯H interaction between two end groups of ML-1F lead to a 3D network packing structure (Fig. 4a). For ML-2FM, both A-to-D and A-to-A type J-aggregations exist. The π–π interaction distances for A-to-D type aggregation are smaller than that of ML-1F. Therefore, a more compact 3D network structure is formed (Fig. 4b). Despite only minor change in the position of the fluorine substitutions, ML-2FP demonstrates a different packing pattern in comparison with ML-2FM. The π–π stacking distances are 3.42 and 3.33 Å for A-to-D type and A-to-A type π–π interactions, respectively. The ML-2FP single crystal shows a 2D network packing structure (Fig. 4c).

2.2 Single crystal in Y6 and its derivatives
The emergence of Y6 and its derivatives has attracted much attention to the A–DAD–A type NFA. Single crystal X-ray diffraction is considered to be an important technique to understand packing arrangement and molecular properties in the solid state. Taking different cores, end groups, and alkyl chain lengths into consideration, the molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1 and discussed below.

2.2.1 The effects of the alkyl chain length on the packing arrangement in the crystal and thin film. 
The effects of the alkyl chain length on molecular packing behavior and photovoltaic performance were investigated by Sun et al.6 3-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene in Y6 was replaced by branched 3-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene and three NFAs, namely L8-R, were prepared. As shown in Fig. 5b, there are three different π–π packing modes for the three L8-R molecules. Their average π–π distances vary from 3.19 Å to 3.40 Å with an elongated alkyl chain. The Y6 single crystal shows two π–π packing modes with a π–π distance of 3.20 Å. A similar molecular conformation can be observed for these NFAs regardless of the size of the alkyl substitutions. The interaction between S and O ensures a planar backbone. The alkyl chains are arranged disorderly and protrudes outwards from the main chain, interacting with adjacent side chains (Fig. 5a). Although the structure and configuration of those molecules are quite similar, the variation in alkyl substitution has a significant effect on intermolecular interactions and packing mode. Specifically, these derivatives have branched alkyl chains of different sizes and tend to form molecular arrangements with small elliptical voids. Meanwhile the Y6 molecules prefer to form orthorhombic vacancies. The L8-R side chain in a single crystal displays a larger torsion angle with the conjugated backbone, interacting with the adjacent chains at different heights. However, the torsion between the straight-chain Y6 alkyl chain and the conjugated backbone is small, which is conducive to interaction with in-plane molecules, thus forming large orthogonal voids. In addition, the packing coefficients in L8-R molecules are higher than that of Y6, indicating more condensed molecular assembly. In conclusion, with the introduction of branched alkyl chains, dense L8-R molecules assembly in single crystals have been achieved, and multiple charge-hopping pathways provide channels for charge transport. The steric effect of the branched alkyl chain reduces the overlap between the cores and the terminal units, resulting in blue shifts in the absorption spectra.

The crystalline feature in neat films was investigated via grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements, and it was found that stronger diffraction signals along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction can be clearly observed in L8-R neat films compared with the Y6 neat film. The OOP (010) peaks are located at 1.78, 1.75, 1.72, and 1.71 Å−1 for Y6, L8-BO, L8-HD, and L8-OD, respectively (Fig. 5c), corresponding to increased π–π distances. The π–π packing distances of L8-R are closer in single crystals than that in thin films, indicating the effect of processing on molecular self-assembly. The diffraction signal appearing at 1.4 Å−1 of the Y6 neat film indicates that the film contains an amorphous component. In the L8-BO-based neat and blend films, the appearance of the (021) diffraction peak was well preserved as in the single crystal (Fig. 5d).
The effects of the asymmetric/symmetric side chains on molecular packing behaviours were investigated by Luo et al.40 The crystallographic data of three NFAs, Y6, BTP-PhC6, and their asymmetric derivative namely BTP-PhC6-C11 were explored. The three NFAs show a similar Y-shaped molecular geometry. The S⋯O distances are 2.66, 2.63, and 2.72 Å for Y6, BTP-PhC6-C11, and BTP-PhC6, respectively. The introducing of 3-hexylphenyl into BTP-PhC6-C11 and BTP-PhC6 increases the dihedral angles between the central core and the end groups due to the steric hindrance effect of benzene. The three NFAs demonstrate four packing motifs with four pairs of dimers (Fig. 6a–c): dimer I (central core-central core interaction), dimer II (head-to-foot EG–EG interaction), dimer III (central core-EG interaction), dimer IV (head-to-head EG–EG interaction). The π–π distances of dimer II, III and IV in the asymmetric molecule BTP-PhC6-C11 are smaller than that of Y6 and BTP-PhC6, suggesting a stronger intermolecular interaction in this molecule. Furthermore, hydrogen bonding interactions of C–H⋯O are observed in BTP-PhC6 and BTPPhC6-C11. The synergistic effect of hydrogen bonding interaction and a smaller steric hindrance in the asymmetric molecule leads to more compact molecular packing in BTPPhC6-C11, which is helpful for charge transport.

2.2.2 The effects of the central core on the packing behaviour in the crystal. 
The molecular packing of Y6 and its selenium-substituted derivative (CH1007) was reported by Jen et al.41 The single crystal of Y6 displays a banana-shaped configuration. The torsional angles between the core and end groups are 11.9(7)° and 4.3(8)°, and the corresponding S–O interaction distances are 2.62(0) and 2.64(0) Å, respectively. The self-assembly of Y6 can be considered as the stacking of two pairs of Y6 enantiomers (M-enantiomer and P-enantiomer). Two M-enantiomers or P-enantiomers adopt the following stacking mode: π–π stacking between two end groups and face-to-face π-core interaction between the benzothiadiazole (BT) moieties. The π–π stacking distance and the S–N distance are 3.3 and 3.63(5) Å, respectively. The M- and P-channels are stacked into a 2D network in an antiparallel manner, along the out-of-plane direction. The two channels interact with each other through the π–π interaction of the terminal groups to form a 3D network structure. For the single crystal CH1007, two pairs of enantiomers (M/P-enantiomer and M′/P′ enantiomer) can be observed (Fig. 7b). The M and P-enantiomeric pair exhibits a π-core torsion of 7.3(9)°. The dihedral angles between the core and the terminal groups are 1.9(0)° and 11.4(1)°, corresponding to Se–O distances of 2.63(6) and 2.70(1) Å, respectively. For the M′ and P′-enantiomeric pair, π-core torsion and D–A dihedral angles are 2.2(6)°, 1.8(7)° and 11.9(2)°, and the Se–O distances are 2.65(1) and 2.66(1) Å, respectively. Compared with Y6, CH1007 demonstrates a more planar backbone. The molecular packing of CH1007 is similar to that of Y6, without considering complexity introduced by more enantiomers (Fig. 7a). In Y6 and CH1007, the S–N interaction between the two BT groups is intrinsic to the molecule's ability to form face-to-face π-core interaction, which plays a crucial role in the molecular unique self-assembly. The S–N non-covalent interactions in the adjacent molecules and face-to-face π-core interaction between the BT units and π–π interactions between end groups together induce the formation of a 3D network that facilitates carrier transport.

Recently, Jen's group developed a series of benzotriazole (Bz)-substituted Y6 derivatives and investigated the impact of N-alkyl substitution on the molecular packing.42 As displayed in Fig. 7e, similar to Y6 and CH1007, enantiomers exist in the three crystals due to the twisted central core and the crescentic molecular geometry. Three pairs of M/P, M'/P′, and M′′/P′′ enantiomers with larger π-core torsion angles are observed in mBzS-4F (with an N-methyl substituent) crystals (Fig. 7e). In contrast, EHN6SEH-4F, substituted with 2-ethylhexyl on the Bz unit, and AN6SBO-4F with an N-pentyl substituent exhibit a pair of M/P enantiomers. The π-core interactions through S–N non-covalent interaction can be observed in mBzS-4F and AN6SBO-4F, and the π-core interaction distances in mBzS-4F are 3.44(4) and 3.56(4) Å, which are larger than that of (3.19(6) Å) in AN6SBO-4F. This can be attributed to the larger π-core torsion of mBzS-4F (Fig. 7c). Unlike the packing pattern of Y6 molecules, the presence of N-alkyl groups on the benzotriazole (Bz) unit weakens the face-to-face π-core interaction between the Bz segments. For mBzS-4F, although a certain disorder in the molecular arrangement is observed, efficient end-group interactions and face-to-face π-core interactions have been preserved due to the short N-methyl substituent. Meanwhile for AN6SBO-4F, the long n-amyl side chains disrupt the molecular ordering packing in the out-of-plane direction, which is unfavourable for efficient charge transport. Compared to mBzS-4F and AN6SBO-4F, the long and branched N-alkyl group on the BT unit in EHN6SEH-4F prevents the π-core interaction. However, the shorter N-alkyl group on the pyrrole unit reduces the steric hindrance. Strong intermolecular interaction between the end groups in adjacent molecules promotes the formation of a 3D network, which endows EHN6SEH-4F crystals with efficient charge-transport channels (Fig. 7e).


2.2.3 The effects of terminal groups on the packing behavior in the crystal. 
The effects of terminal units on the molecule packing were systematically studied by T. J. Marks et al.43 and as shown in Fig. 8. Single crystals of Y5, BT-LIC, BT-L4F, and BT-BO-L4F were obtained by solvent vapor diffusion from halogenated solvents. For Y5, Y6, and BT-BO-L4F, two different configurations can be distinguished, while BT-LIC and BT-L4F possess a single configuration. Similar to other Y6 derivatives, three NFAs (i.e., BT-LIC, BT-L4F, and BT-BO-L4F) exhibit a planar backbone due to the S⋯O conformational locking effect. The torsional angles between the core and the terminal groups increase with the π-extension and fluorination of the end groups. In these molecules, 3D interpenetrating networks formed through the stacking between the core and the end groups (Fig. 8a). In the Y5 crystals, some of the end groups do not interact with other neighbours. Meanwhile for Y6 and BT-LIC, enhanced π–π stacking occurs benefiting from the π-extension and fluorination in terminal groups. Interestingly, unlike traditional reverse parallel head-to-toe end group stacking, BT-LIC demonstrates a new head-to-head end group stacking pattern, which provides a dense BT-LIC packing network. Other acceptors exhibit typical hollow topologies. The stacking pattern of BT-L4F is very similar to that of Y6, except that the extent of end groups and core stacking is greater in the former. In terms of π–π interaction distances, the values for Y6 (∼3.4 Å) and BT-LIC (∼3.3 Å) are clearly smaller than that of Y5 (3.5–3.7 Å), which can be attributed to closer molecular packing (Fig. 8b). For BT-BO-L4F, with the incorporation of elongated alkyl chains on the pyrrole unit, the enhanced intramolecular torsion prevents the coupling of several BT-BO-L4F molecules around a single molecule.
 Fig. 8  (a) Molecular stacking, (b) π–π interlayer distance, and (c) intermolecular stacking pattern of Y5, Y6, BT-LIC, BT-L4F, and BT-BO-L4F. The spatial positions of the three molecules are indicated by coloring the terminal groups in red, blue, and green, respectively (top: red, middle: blue, and bottom: green). Reproduced with permission.43 Copyright 2020 American Chemical Society. 
The crystal packing patterns of these NFAs are shown in Fig. 8a, Y5 displays well-aligned EG–EG, thiophene (Th)–Th, and BT–BT stacking, and Y6 possesses Th–EG and EG–EG stacking. BT-LIC with an extended π conjugated backbone shows enhanced EG–EG interactions (head-to-head + head-to-foot) as the predominant stacking. For BTL4F, EG–EG, Th–Th, EG–Th, and BT–BT stacking are obtained. This feature offers BT-L4F a strong self-aggregation tendency. In the BT-BO-L4F crystal, EG–Th interaction is lost, and the other three types of stacking are maintained. The charge transfer abilities of these NFAs can be evaluated from the electronic coupling. Y5 and Y6 possess large couplings of |J|= (53.0 and 63.3 meV) and |J|= (20.9 and 37.9 meV), respectively. BT-LIC shows two comparable couplings (|Jmax| = 34.5 and 36.5 meV), while BT-L4F has two much higher couplings, |Jmax| = (56.8 and 103.8 meV), due to the enhanced EG–EG stacking. However, the strong aggregation tendency of BTL4F makes it a poor candidate due to large domains and weak interactions with the electrodes. For BT-BO-L4F, moderate couplings of |J| = (33.0 and 47.5 meV) are achieved. The strong aggregation tendency of BT-L4F limits the formation of an appropriate domain size.
Recently, Wang et al. reported three Y6 derivatives namely Y-BO-FCl, Y-BO-FBr, and Y-BO-ClBr by introducing three hetero-dihalogenated terminals.44 As can be seen in Fig. 9, the three NFAs display a similar banana-curved molecular geometry. The molecular torsion angles between the central core and the end groups are 3.05°, 3.79°, and 10.91° for Y-BO-FCl, Y-BO-FBr, and Y-BO-ClBr, respectively. The small torsion angle in Y-BO-FCl indicates its relative planar conformation. In addition, the introduction of a larger size halogen substituted atom into the end groups results in a more distorted molecular backbone in Y-BO-ClBr. In terms of intermolecular packing modes, the three NFAs are different. For the fluorine-based NFAs, Y-BO-FCl and Y-BO-FBr, they have four molecular conformations with three types of π–π interactions between neighbouring molecules, including antiparallel EG–EG interaction, non-reverse parallel EG–EG interaction and EG-central core stacking (Fig. 9a and b). The π–π stacking distances of the EG-central core and antiparallel EG–EG in the former are slightly shorter than that of the latter. In contrast, Y-BO-ClBr crystals have two molecular conformations and one type of π–π stacking between two end groups (Fig. 9c). The π–π stacking distances of Y-BO-ClBr are comparable with that of Y-BO-FBr and slighter larger than that of Y-BO-FCl. In particular, π–π stacking between the central BT units with a distance of 3.31 Å in the Y-BO-ClBr crystal can be observed. However, a torsion angle between the EG–EG (reverse) π–π interactions for the Y-BO-ClBr crystal exists. These lead to the transformation in the crystal system from a monoclinic system of Y-BO-FCl to a triclinic system of Y-BO-ClBr. The molecular packing networks of the three NFAs are displayed in Fig. 9a–c. For the Y-BO-FCl and Y-BO-FBr crystals, four molecules form an elliptical frame structure through multiple intermolecular interactions. Meanwhile for the Y-BO-ClBr crystals, only two types of molecules are involved in forming the elliptical structure. Due to the relatively small radius of F and Cl atoms, Y-BO-FCl shows a planar backbone and compact molecular packing, which facilitates charge transport in multiple channels in thin films.

2.3 The crystal structures of non-fused electron acceptors
Non-fused or partially non-fused strategies are considered as an effective way to achieve low cost due to their ability to simplify the molecular design and reduce synthesis steps. However, compared with the typical fused-ring NFAs, rotatable single bonds in non-fused NFAs pose a great challenge to the geometric configuration control and the formation of ordered molecular packing in the solid state. Single crystallographic studies provide reliable information to determine the molecular geometry and intermolecular stacking patterns in organic compounds, enabling in-depth exploration of the correlation between the aggregation structure and charge transport properties of non-fused ring-based NFAs, providing insight into molecular design. The molecular structures discussed below are shown in Fig. 1.

2.3.1 Molecular packing in partially non-fused electron acceptors. 
Bo et al. developed two noncovalent fused-ring electron acceptors (FOC6-IC and FOC2C6-2FIC) to study the effect of halogen substitution and the alkyl chain on molecular configurations and intermolecular interactions.45 The molecular geometries are shown in Fig. 10. The dihedral angles between the core and 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene unit are 6.6 and 6.2° for FOC6-IC and FOC2C6-2FIC, respectively. The torsional angles between 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and EG are 5.4° and 9.4°, respectively. FOC6-IC exhibits a F⋯S distance of 2.57 Å and O⋯S distances of 2.76 and 2.72 Å, while these values of FOC2C6-2FIC are 2.79, 2.67, and 2.69 Å, respectively. Benefiting from the non-covalent interactions between F⋯S and O⋯S, the two NFAs exhibit planar molecular backbones (Fig. 10a). FOC6-IC and FOC6-2FIC show well-aligned EG-phenylene, 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene unit-4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene unit stacking in an antiparallel manner with π–π distances of 3.36 and 3.39 Å. For FOC6-2FIC with an F-substituted terminal group, S⋯F and C–H⋯O noncovalent interactions can be observed between two adjacent molecules, which are favourable for improving in-plane packing of these molecules (Fig. 10b).

In addition, two partially non-fused acceptors (CH3-2F and 2BTh-2F) based on a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit are designed and synthesized by Bo et al.26,46 In the single crystal of CH3-2F, the dihedral angle between the core and alkyl-thiophene is 27.61°, indicating a twisted molecular backbone. A smaller dihedral angle of 2.91° is observed between the alkyl-thiophene and the end groups due to the S⋯O noncovalent interactions (Fig. 10c). In a single crystal, two molecules adopt a face to face packing pattern to form a hollow topology with an end group distance of 3.47 Å (Fig. 10d). Moreover, the alkyl-thiophene-EG packing is observed in two adjacent “dimers” with a distance of 3.44 Å, which can be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the two groups. The two different packing arrangements construct a quasi-2D grid-like electron transport channel (Fig. 10e). 2BTh-2F was prepared by replacing the alkyl-thiophene in CH3-2F with a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit. As shown in Fig. 6f, compared with CH3-2F, 2BTh-2F exhibits a planar conjugated backbone with smaller dihedral angles benefitting from S⋯O and S⋯N intramolecular interactions. In single crystals, 2BTh-2F displays partial face-to-face overlaps between two adjacent EGs with π–π packing distances of 3.3–3.4 Å. Benefiting from the various noncovalent interactions, a 3D network structure was formed in 2BTh-2F (Fig. 10g).


2.3.2 Molecular packing in completely non-fused electron acceptors. 
Hou's group designed and synthesized three non-fused ring electron acceptors (A4T-16,25 A4T-25,47 and A4T-26 (ref. 47)) based on tetrathiophene with substituted-2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl onto different positions of the central two thiophene units to investigate the variation of the crystal structure upon chemical modifications. In A4T-16, a small dihedral angle of 0.13° is observed between the two central thiophenes due to the large steric hindrance effect of the isopropyl groups. The phenyl group is nearly perpendicular to the central bithiophene with a dihedral angle of 89.9°. Despite the high planarity of the central bithiophene, a larger torsion angle of 30.1° between the central bithiophene core and the alkyl-thiophene exists. In a single crystal, A4T-16 stacks along two orthogonal directions. Firstly, two adjacent molecules overlap through the two nearby end groups forming a straight linear sub-structure. Similarly, in the out-of-plane orthogonal direction, another substructure is formed through the interactions between the end groups. As a result, linear substructures along the orthogonal direction stack with each other and form a 3D charge transport network (Fig. 11a). For A4T-25 with the linear alkyl groups (dodecyl) attached to the β position of the outer two thiophenes (Fig. 1), the single crystal structure is drastically different from that of A4T-16. The two molecules show completely different packing topology, i.e., a monoclinic cell for A4T-16 and a triclinic cell for A4T-25. Moreover, the alkyl groups have an effect not only on solubility, but also on the charge transport properties. In the A4T-25 crystal packing, the dihedral angle between the alkyl and the central thiophene units is 12.48°, which is smaller than that of A4T-16 (30.1°). A4T-25 shows a conventional reversed parallel head-to-toe EG stacking pattern with a π⋯π distance of 3.25 Å, and the long side chains in the single crystal are tilted outward at an angle almost perpendicular to the conjugate plane (Fig. 11b). A4T-25 therefore exhibits a 2D packing structure in the crystal (Fig. 11c). In terms of the chemical structure, A4T-25 and A4T-26 differ in the 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl side groups locating at the β, β′- and γ, γ′ -positions of the central thiophene, respectively (Fig. 1). In comparison with A4T-25, A4T-26 shows a slightly more twisted conjugate backbone with a larger dihedral angle of 27.59° between the alkyl-thiophene and the central bithiophene units. Similarly, A4T-26 also adopts a head-to-toe EG stacking pattern with a shortened spacing of 4.59 Å in the laminar-like secondary structure, and this value is much smaller than that of A4T-25 (12.92 Å) (Fig. 11b). Therefore, more compact π–π stacking (3.18 Å) was obtained in A4T-26, which is favourable for a better charge transfer process. The electron (te)/hole (th) transfer integrals were calculated to be 66.94/35.37 (1–2) and 0.68/2.04 (1–3) meV for A4T-25, and (47.21/7.07 (1–2) and 21.50/3.53 (1–3) meV for A4T-26, indicating more efficient charge transfer in A4T-26 along these directions (Fig. 11c).

Recently, another fully unfused acceptor, named 2T2Se-F, was developed by using selenophene to bridge the bithiophene core with the fluorinated end group by Li et al.48 As shown in Fig. 11d, the dihedral angles between the core and selenophenyl rings are 15.2°. This value is 40.0° between the two central thienyl rings. A small dihedral angle of 2° is observed between the selenophenyl ring and the end groups due to the Se⋯O⋯C intramolecular interaction. 2T2Se-F displays multiple short intermolecular π–π interactions, including J-aggregations between two adjacent end groups and between the end groups with the central core, and H-aggregations between molecular backbones. Furthermore, CN⋯H–Ar and CN⋯π interactions are observed. As a result, a 3D interpenetrating network is formed due to the multiple noncovalent interactions and π–π interactions (Fig. 11e).
Molecule packing in non-fused electron acceptors with three thiophene and phenyl backbones was investigated by Chen's group.49,50 As shown in Fig. 11f, PTIC shows a planar geometry due to the noncovalent conformational locks, and the dihedral angles between phenyl core/thiophene and thiophene bridge/EGs are 2.97/2.27°. The PTIC side chains tilt out of the conjugated plane with a small angle. PTIC adopts the phenyl-thiophene-EG moiety stack with the adjacent phenyl-thiophene-EG moiety with a π–π distance of 3.369 Å. In addition, they introduced phenyl side-chains at the β-position of bridge thiophene, and two non-fused electron acceptors, PTB4F and PTB4Cl, are developed.50 The single crystallographic data of PTB4F and PTB4Cl are shown in Fig. 11g, and the two acceptors show nearly co-planar conformation due to the conformational lock of O⋯H and O⋯S interactions. PTB4Cl shows well-aligned A-to-A and A-to-D type stacking with a π–π distance of ∼3.5 Å, whereas PTB4F exhibits multiple stacking patterns including A-to-A and A-to-D stacking, and crossed face-to-face stacking. PTB4Cl crystals display a short lamellar distance of 21.86 Å, which is shorter than that of the PTB4F crystals.

2.4 The connection between single crystal structures and blend films

2.4.1 Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis. 
Our recent work demonstrated that the packing pattern in A4T-16 single crystals could be partially maintained in the blend film by GIWAXS measurements.25 As shown in Fig. 12a, for the A4T-16 neat film, a weak (010) diffraction peak locating at 1.87 Å−1 in both the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions and the periodical peaks at 0.36 and 0.72 Å−1 can be clearly observed, corresponding to a π–π and a laminar packing distance of 3.35, and 17.4 Å. These values are consistent with the crystallographic results. For the PBDB-TF:A4T-16 blend film, a distinctive molecular packing from the annular diffraction pattern, π–π and lamellar diffraction peaks was evidenced, which coincides with that of the A4T-16 pristine film. This result indicates that the 3D network of A4T-16 is preserved to some extent in this blend film. In addition, a similar phenomenon was also evidenced recently by Liu's group.52 From the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of BTIC-2Cl-γCF3 single crystals, strong diffraction signals locating at 2θ = 6.088, 7.168 and 26.488° can be observed. The calculated q values are 0.29, 0.51, and 1.87 Å−1, respectively. From the GIWAXS data, q = 0.29 and 0.53 Å−1 in the IP direction and q = 1.87 Å−1 in the OOP direction can be distinguished in the PBDB-TF:BTIC-2Cl-γCF3 film, which is in accordance with the data from single crystals, indicating that the packing arrangement of BTIC-2Cl-gCF3 should be partially retained in the blend film.

2.4.2 Infrared spectrum analysis. 
The intermolecular interactions in the OSC blend films were investigated via infrared variable temperature spectra by He et al.51 The temperature-dependent IR spectra of the single crystal of BTIC-CF3-γ are shown in Fig. 12b. Vibrational changes in multiple chemical bonds can be clearly observed as the temperature rises from 26 °C to 126 °C. The CN, C–F, and CN bonds vibrated from 1533 to 1529, and 1274 to 1272, 2216 and 2214 cm−1, respectively. The vibrational absorption signal of the C–H bond did not change. This demonstrates that the change in temperature plays a vital role in intermolecular interactions. For the PBDB-TF/BTIC-CF3-γ- blend film, the same vibrational frequencies of the CN, C–F, and CN bonds can be distinguished compared with the single crystal of BTIC-CF3-γ at 26 °C (Fig. 12c). This suggests that the intermolecular interaction in a single crystal agrees with that in blend films.

3 Conclusions
In this review, we discuss the molecular packing information of fused-ring and non-fused electron acceptors at the atomic level in single crystal structures to understand the relationship between structures and electron transport properties. For the fused-ring NFAs, the intermolecular interactions in A–D–A-type and A–DAD–A-type NFAs are significantly different. The multiple packing patterns in the latter including EG–EG, EG–Th, Th–Th, and BT–BT lead to a compact π–π distance and more electron transport channels. In addition, the 3D networks may play a vital role in the high efficiencies of Y6 and its derivatives. However, the packing arrangement behaviour of non-fused electron acceptors is significantly different from that of A–DAD–A type acceptors. The former is mainly dominated by EG–EG interactions and forms 2D charge transport channels. Only a few non-fused electron acceptors possess a 3D packing arrangement and deliver PCEs over 15%. In terms of molecular design, the construction of multi-dimensional charge transport channels with compact π–π stacking distances is beneficial to charge transport and the reduction of reorganization energy. The development of new-generation materials with multiple packing modes between cores and end groups is a feasible method to achieve the next breakthrough. In addition, although previous studies demonstrated that the packing arrangement in a single crystal can be partially preserved when blending with a donor, it is still a challenge to establish the correlation between crystal packing information and the device performance.
