    , Accepted 3rd November 2020First published on 5th November 2020AbstractEnergy storage is a vital issue to be solved for the efficient utilization of renewable energies such as solar, wind and tidal energy. In terms of rechargeable battery energy storage, magnesium has many advantages over lithium, such as low cost, environmental benignity and ease of operation. Therefore, rechargeable Mg batteries (RMBs) are considered as a promising green alternative to rechargeable lithium batteries for practical applications. Over the past few years, RMBs have made great progress, but there are also many problems.

1. Introduction
With the rapid development of mobile electronic devices, electric vehicles, and the like, the requirements of power sources to operate these devices have also been increasing. The breakthrough of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) has led to their application in various fields. There is no doubt that the LIB currently is the leading technology for energy storage batteries.1 However, LIBs also have many disadvantages, including high cost and poor safety performance. For large-scale application of energy storage for renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and tidal, these issues should be solved. As a result, alternative electrochemical energy storage systems should be developed. Confronted with this, some earth-abundant elements have been intensively investigated for battery energy storage, such as potassium-ion (K+),2 sodium-ion (Na+),3 magnesium-ion (Mg2+),4 calcium-ion (Ca2+),5 and zinc-ion (Zn2+)6 batteries. Among these battery systems, as an alternative to LIB technology, rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are considered to have the most potential for commercial applications, which is attributed to the following advantages.7 (i) Abundant magnesium resources. As shown in Fig. 1b, the abundance of Mg resources is ∼104 times higher than that of Li resources in the Earth's crust. (ii) High volumetric capacity. Mg possesses a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 3833 mA h cm−3 (vs. 2046 mA h cm−3 for Li) (Fig. 1a), benefiting from offering two electrons per redox center, and low electrode potential (−2.37 V vs. SHE). (iii) Smooth deposition behavior. Compared with alkali metal (Li, Na, and K) anodes, Mg anodes tend to form a smooth and homogeneous deposition layer during electrodeposition, thus avoiding dendrite nucleation and growth and making them safer. It is noteworthy that the dendrite-free deposition behavior of Mg depends heavily on the electrolyte and current density though there are some different opinions.8–10 These attractive features make RMBs one of the promising large-scale energy storage systems for practical applications beyond LIBs.

Although the prototype system for RMBs was first reported by Aurbach et al. in 2000, many challenges still exist in the development process of RMBs.11 One of the challenges is the compatibility of the electrolyte with Mg metal anodes. In most of the conventional polar aprotic solvents containing simple salt anions (ClO4−, PF6−, BF4−, etc.), the surface of the Mg metal electrode generates a passivation layer, which hinders the reversible deposition of Mg2+ ions resulting in poor coulombic efficiency.12,13 Another major challenge is the unique divalent nature of Mg2+, which leads to large polarization and strong solvation of Mg2+, resulting in Mg2+ diffusion in solid state electrode materials being difficult. Therefore, the exploration and development of suitable electrode materials with acceptable kinetics and electrolytes compatible with electrode materials become crucial for high performance and their practical RMBs.14,15
Various active electrode materials and innovatively designed electrolytes have been developed by scholars to tackle the above challenges, and some excellent reviews were reported to summarize some pioneering studies from the aspects of structural design, fabrication methods and battery performance. For example, Wang and Mao et al. summarized the electrochemical performance and improvement strategies of cathode materials.16 Niu et al. systematically analyzed and summarized the synthesis strategies, electrochemical properties and reaction mechanisms of Mg alloy anode materials.8 However, there are few comprehensive reviews, and several recent advances in these critical battery materials for RMBs need to be timely summarized. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively overview the recent developments of electrolytes and electrode materials for RMBs, thus providing new inspirations to push forward the R&D on the above key materials.
In this review, we will overview recent progress in research on RMBs, covering cathodes, electrolytes and anodes, as displayed in Fig. 2. Firstly, the influences of the structure and composition of the cathode material on the Mg2+ migration kinetics are explained. Subsequently, the design principles of the electrolyte and the application prospects of chlorine-free electrolytes are analysed in detail. Finally, the surface modification of metallic Mg and insertion type anodes is elucidated systematically. We hope that this review can provide insights and valuable references for RMBs on the way to commercial applications with high capacity and long cycle life.

2. Cathode materials
In recent years, to realize the application of RMBs, researchers have made extraordinary progress in the development of cathode materials. An ideal cathode material for RMBs should have the following characteristics: (i) high specific capacity and operating potential; (ii) fast and reversible kinetics for Mg2+ ion transportation; (iii) good cycling stability. Currently, most of the research on cathode materials for RMBs is focused on transition metal compounds. Beyond the normal sulfides, selenides, and oxides, which have been studied extensively, other cathode materials such as polyanionic compounds, organics, etc. have also attracted much attention. In this part, we summarize recent advances in development of sulfides, selenides, oxides, and other types of cathode materials according to their chemical compositions.
2.1 Transition metal sulfides

2.1.1 Chevrel phase. 
Chevrel phase type MxMo6T8 compounds (M = metal, e.g., Li, Mg, Cu, Zn, etc. and T = S, Se and Te) were originally known as superconducting materials. Since Li+ ions can be inserted/extracted reversibly in the three-dimensional channels of these compounds, they were applied early as LIB cathode materials.17 This type of material has a variable number of Mo6 clusters, a flexible anion backbone, multidirectional diffusion paths, and several types of cavities. These properties allow different sized cations to be inserted and charge injections of up to 4 electrons.18,19 As shown in Fig. 3a, the block-stacked Chevrel phase Mo6S8 forms a three-dimensional open structure. The existence of 12 sites per cluster of Mo (Mo6), that readily serve as solid-state diffusion channels, allows Mg2+ to diffuse rapidly.7 Due to geometric effects and static electricity, Mg2+ can insert into and occupy mainly sites A and B between Mo6S8 blocks (Fig. 3b inset). In the initial stage of Mg2+ insertion, the ions occupy A inner sites preferentially following reaction eqn (1) at 1.2 V versus Mg/Mg2+. After site A is occupied, Mg2+ further occupies the outer site B following reaction eqn (2) at 1.0 V versus Mg/Mg2+.11,20–23 Mo6S8 + Mg2+ + 2e− ⇄ MgMo6S8(1) MgMo6S8 + Mg2+ + 2e− ⇄ Mg2Mo6S8(2)

Aurbach et al. assembled a battery with a Chevrel phase Mo6S8 as the cathode and 0.25 M Mg(AlCl2BuEt)2 in THF (tetrahydrofuran) as the electrolyte. The initial discharge capacity reached ∼80 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.3 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the most promising feature of Mo6S8 was its excellent cyclability. The cathode sustained more than 2000 cycles at 100% depth of discharge over a wide temperature range (−20 °C < T < 80 °C) without significant capacity loss (less than 15%).11 However, some defects of the Mo6S8 cathode hinder its commercial application, such as initial capacity loss caused by Mg2+ capture and sluggish kinetics at room temperature.

Methods to improve the performance of the Mo6S8 cathode have been tried continuously. An effective method is to reduce the particle size of Mo6S8 clusters at the nanoscale. The reduced particle size results in a shorter Mg2+ diffusion path and faster kinetics inside the particles.24,25 The large surface area of the nano-sized material also increases the effective contact area with the electrolyte.26 The effects of milling Mo6S8 for various lengths of time under Ar or air on the specific surface area have been studied. Ball milling can effectively reduce the particle size and improve the electronic conductivity of the particle surface. The Ar atmosphere can effectively prevent the occurrence of side reactions on the particle surface compared to air.17,18 Kim et al. obtained sub-microsized Mo6S8 powder by mechanical milling. They found that these smaller particles can provide a shorter diffusion path for Mg2+, resulting in better electrochemical performance.26 Recently, Mao et al. obtained large-scale and highly pure Mo6S8 nanosheets by an iodine vapor transport reaction (IVT).27 A typical three-dimensional material, iodine, helps to regulate the growth kinetics and induces the preferential growth of Mo6S8 to form nanosheets. Compared with Mo6S8 microparticles obtained by the conventional method, Mo6S8 nanosheets exhibit lower polarization, higher capacities, and better low-temperature performance (−40 °C). This method provides an extremely short and economical method for the synthesis of high-purity Mo6S8 in large quantities, and greatly reduces the cost of synthesis.
The structural modification of Chevrel Mo6S8 clusters on the atomic scale by partial Se substitution was proposed.16,19,28–31 Chevrel Mo6S8 with larger chalcogenide (T) substitution, especially Se, possesses increased cell constants (Fig. 4a).7 The increase in cell constants greatly improves the mobility of Mg2+. According to previous reports, the insertion/extraction of Mg2+ into Mo6Se8 is fully reversible and exhibits no irreversible capacity at room temperature. The presence of Se in the anionic framework of Mo6Se8 increased its polarizability and thus facilitated the solid matrix diffusion of Mg2+ (Fig. 4b).30 Selenide avoids an unusual arrangement of the inner sites for cation insertion, which results in the degeneration of trapping.29,30 However, Mo6Se8 is still unsuitable for practical applications because of its low operating potential and lower capacity (88.8 vs. 122 mA h g−1). Fig. 4c shows that, for a partial substitution of Se to obtain a compound with the Mo6S8−ySey (y = 0, 1, 2) stoichiometry, increased specific capacity can be obtained at room temperature, without a significant drop in operating potential, with different levels of Se in the Chevrel cluster structure.32,33 Importantly, the charge–discharge performance improved at low temperatures (15 °C) without significant capacity loss or power degradation during cycling (left inset of Fig. 4c).
CuxMo6S8, the precursor of Mo6S8, has also been shown to have excellent Mg2+ (de)intercalation performance.24 The presence of elemental Cu in the ternary CuxMo6S8 structure makes it free of charge trapping during cycling, which has a positive effect on the performance of RMBs. Although the theoretical capacity of CuMo6S8 is slightly lower than that of Mo6S8 (114 vs. 122 mA h g−1, respectively), CuMo6S8 is superior to Mo6S8 in terms of rate and cycling stability (100 vs. 90 mA h g−1, respectively, after 100 cycles).18 Kim et al. prepared ternary CuxMo6S8 by an easily composition-controllable chemical intercalation method and verified the beneficial effects of Cu incorporation on RMB performance. Benefiting from a reversible phase transformation with a positive Cu effect, the material showed a stable capacity retention over 50 cycles in PhMgCl-AlCl3/THF electrolyte.34 The conventional solid state and molten salt synthesis routes of ternary CuxMo6S8 require a long reaction time,35 complex synthesis steps,36 and demanding reaction conditions.37 N. Kumta et al. exploited high energy mechanical milling (HEMM) as a viable time and cost saving method for laboratory scale synthesis of ternary CuxMo6S8 using CuS, Mo, and MoS2 as the precursors.38 The preparation of CuxMo6S8 by this method is relatively simple with stable capacity, high coulombic efficiency and excellent rate capabilities, making it a viable route for laboratory-scale production of Chevrel phase compounds.
Despite the excellent cyclability and Mg2+ mobility, the application of Chevrel phase compounds in practical RMBs is limited by their low theoretical capacity (<150 mA h g−1) and low output voltage (<1.5 V). These facts suggest that Chevrel phase compounds can only be regarded as medium or low energy density cathodes. However, as the best-known model cathode for RMBs, Mo6S8 has become the standard cathode for serving as a baseline system to evaluate the suitability of new magnesium electrodes and electrolytes.39–41


2.1.2 Sulfides. 
Two-dimensional layered transition metal sulfides MX2 (M = Ti, Mo, Nb, W, V, and X = S) have a layered structure formed by stacking sheets of X–M–X. The weak van der Waals' interaction between layers and the large interlayer distance make MX2 an attractive host for ion intercalation.21,42 Tao et al. reported TiS2 nanotubes cycled in Mg(ClO4)2/acetonitrile with a Mg anode; a maximum initial discharge capacity of 236 mA h g−1 was achieved at 10 mA g−1 with 78% capacity retention after 80 cycles at 20 °C.43 Despite its high theoretical capacity, TiS2 has a high Mg2+ migration barrier (>1 eV) at room temperature.44 Therefore, most researchers increased the migration rate of Mg2+ in TiS2 by increasing the temperature and reducing the particle size of the material.45,46 The application of nano-sized electrode materials can shorten the Mg2+ diffusion length and improve the electrode/electrolyte interaction. Sun et al. reported the mechanism of Mg2+ insertion into TiS2 using first-principles calculations combined with experiments. The Mg2+ insertion process (in APC/THF electrolyte) involves a multistep insertion mechanism with initial occupation of primarily the octahedral sites followed by occupation of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites.38 The latter process is electrochemically reversible, but the first is not. But Tchitchekova recently reported that only solvated Mg2+ ions were inserted between TiS2 layers following reaction eqn (3) in Mg(TFSI)2/EC:PC.42 [xMg2+ − ySL] + 2e− + TiS2 ⇄ MgxSLyTiS2(3)with SL being used as a generic notation for EC and PC. Because of the stronger solvent–Mg2+ interactions, naked Mg2+ cannot be intercalated from an EC:PC mixture. Nevertheless, the formation of solvated intercalates of TiS2 could improve Mg2+ diffusion with the partial screening of the Mg2+ charge by the solvent molecules. Yao and co-workers extended the TiS2 interlayer spacing by PY14+ intercalation and realized MgCl+ as an inserted cation (Fig. 5c) in an Mg cell with magnesium metal as the anode and the traditional chlorine-containing magnesium electrolyte (APC) as the electrolyte.47 When monovalent MgCl+ is substituted for divalent Mg2+ as the inserted ion, only a simple desolvation (Ea ∼ 0.8 eV) process occurs during ion intercalation, and the Mg–Cl bond does not break. Compared with Mg2+, the solid phase diffusion energy barrier of MgCl+ is significantly lowered (∼0.18 eV), and the diffusion rate is substantially increased (Fig. 5a). The battery achieves a reversible specific capacity of up to 400 mA h g−1 at 60 °C. The excellent kinetics are also maintained even at room temperature, providing a reversible capacity of 179 mA h g−1 at 240 mA g−1 and excellent cycling performance (over 500 cycles, Fig. 5b).

Layered TiS3 was also applied as the RMB cathode.48,49 Arsentev et al. used first principles calculations to investigate the electrochemical properties of Mg in TiS3. The migration barrier for Mg2+ ions in TiS3 is only 0.292–0.698 eV (depending on the Mg content), which is much lower than the value for layered and spinel TiS2 (0.8–1.2 eV).49 Thus, TiS3 as a cathode material shows huge development potential in RMBs. Taniguchi et al. synthesized micro-sized TiS3 with d–p orbital hybridized electronic structures by a high temperature solid-state reaction.48 The charge delocalization over cluster-like [TiS3] units by d–p orbital hybridization is advantageous for the reversible intercalation/de-intercalation of Mg2+ ions at room temperature. However, irreversible decomposition of TiS3 would occur to form MgS and TiS2, which is caused by increasing the Mg content and can hinder its practical applications.
MoS2, a frequently encountered member of the class of layered metal sulfides, has long been extensively applied in energy storage systems. MoS2 has an analogous structure to graphene which enables the convenient insertion and extraction of Mg2+ ions with a high theoretical specific capacity of 223.2 mA h g−1.50–53 Yang et al. studied the insertion behavior of Mg2+ ions in MoS2 nanoribbons with a defect-free single layer structure using first principles.52 They found that the activation barrier of Mg2+ diffusion on the surface of MoS2 nanoribbons is only 0.48 eV, which is one-fifth of that of the bulk interlayer migration (2.61 eV) (Fig. 7a). The electrode reactions of the defect-free single-layered MoS2 cathode can be summarized as follows 6MoS2 + 4Mg2+ + 8e− ⇄ Mg4Mo6S12(4)
Correspondingly, for a defect-free MoS2 single layer, on both sides of which Mg is fully intercalated, a Mg storage capacity of 223.2 mA h g−1 is derived. Chen's group reported a highly exfoliated, graphene-like MoS2 (G-MoS2) cathode using a solvothermal method.53 G-MoS2 exhibited an operating voltage of 1.8 V and a high discharge capacity of 170 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 when paired with an ultrasmall Mg nanoparticle anode. Although G-MoS2 has a graphene-like structure and is highly exfoliated, it is still not an ideal single-layer structure, therefore only ca. 76% of the theoretical capacity was obtained and Mg may only be inserted on one side of the layer.
Several strategies have been used to improve the transfer of Mg2+ ions in MoS2, as shown in Fig. 6.50,51,54–59 Liu et al. synthesized sandwich structured graphene-like MoS2/C microspheres with the carbonaceous materials produced by the hydrothermal carbonization of glucose inserted between the MoS2 layers.54 The carbonaceous materials not only improve the electronic conductivity but also expand the interlayer distance of MoS2 (Fig. 7b). Thus, the MoS2/C microspheres provided a high discharge capacity of 213 mA h g−1, which is very close to the theoretical capacity, and outstanding cycling stability. Similarly, Jiao et al. obtained a sandwich-structured MoS2/graphene by inserting graphene into the highly exfoliated MoS2 layer and showed excellent Mg storage capacity and good cyclability.59 Yao et al. found that increasing the interlayer spacing is a good way to enhance the Mg2+ intercalation kinetics of MoS2.55 They synthesized MoS2–poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) nano-composites with tunable interlayer distance by controlling the amount of PEO intercalation into the MoS2.56 As the interlayer distance is enhanced from 0.62 to 1.45 nm, improvements of 200% in specific capacity and 100-fold in Mg mobility were observed. Sun et al. synthesized PVP–MoS2 nanospheres with an interlayer spacing of 0.97 nm. The nanocomposite cathode showed a high capacity of 143.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1, and good cycling performance (with 92% capacity retention after 100 cycles) because of its high structural stability (Fig. 7c and d).57 The unique Mg2+–solvent co-intercalation in MoS2 was studied to achieve fast insertion kinetics.58 In comparison with pure Mg2+, the solvated magnesium ion ([Mg(DME)x]2+, where DME is dimethoxyethane), has a larger ionic radius and therefore reduced charge density, resulting in a lower diffusion energy barrier in MoS2. Thus, the MoS2@C porous nanorod cathode provided a capacity of 130 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1, good cycling stability (with 71% capacity retention after 200 cycles), and remarkable rate performance (47 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1) (Fig. 7e and f).

Several other sulfide materials, such as Ti2S4,60–63 CuS,64–70 VS4,71–74 and VS2,75–77 have also been considered as cathode materials for RMBs. Sun et al. described the cycling of thiospinel Ti2S4 at a temperature of 60 °C, providing a capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at an average voltage of 1.2 V.60 Subsequently, Cr2S4,61 Mn2S4,61 Zr2S4,62 and other materials with similar structures to Ti2S4 were also studied as cathode materials for magnesium cells. However, the sluggish diffusion of Mg2+ ions at room temperature hinders the practical application of these materials.63 Nazar et al. first reported a CuS cathode for RMBs using the APC electrolyte.64 CuS has a superior theoretical capacity (560 mA h g−1) as a conversion material, but it showed negligible capacity and poor cycling stability at room temperature. Reducing the particle size of CuS is an important strategy to enhance the reversible capacity of CuS at room temperature. For example, CuS nanospheres with diameters of 300–800 nm achieve a high initial discharge capacity of 361 mA h g−1 at room temperature with Mg(ClO4)2/AN electrolyte.65 CuS nanoparticles (specific surface area: 10.8 m2 g−1) delivered a high specific capacity of 175 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, excellent cycling stability (over 350 cycles) and superior rate performance (90 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1).66 CuS hierarchical nanosheets with a larger specific surface area of 24.1 m2 g−1 achieved a higher capacity of more than 200 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1.67 Hollow CuS nanocubes with a larger specific surface area (198.474 m2 g−1) have also been demonstrated to have high capacity, remarkable rate capability and superior long-term cyclability.68 The reversible capacity was further increased to 300 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 when ultrafine CuS nanocrystals of 20 nm size were used.69 Increasing the insertion kinetics of Mg2+ ions in CuS can also be achieved by extending the layer spacing. As shown in Fig. 8a, by inserting cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to extend the CuS layer spacing from 0.82 to 1.3 nm, interlayer-expanded CuS microflowers reached a maximum discharge capacity of 477 mA h g−1 and outstanding cycling stability over 1000 cycles (Fig. 8c and d).70 Highly branched VS4 nanodendrites with 1D atomic chains were applied as the RMB cathode. The unique one-dimensional atomic chain structure provides an open channel for Mg2+ ion diffusion and sufficient active sites.71 Li et al. demonstrated that VS4 has fast Mg2+ ion diffusion kinetics benefiting from its soft structure and flexible electronic configuration, and it has a unique redox activity mainly at anionic sulfide moieties, which allows reversible two-electron redox with cationic–anionic contributions.72 With the intercalation of [BMP]+ (1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium chloride, [BMP]Cl), interchain-expanded VS4 reached a higher reversible capacity than that of branched VS4 nanodendrites (268.3 mA h g−1vs. 195 mA h g−1).73 A similar strategy was applied to prepare a VS2 cathode for RMBs (Fig. 8b); the insertion of molecules such as 2-ethylhexylamine or ions (PP14+) greatly expands the interlayer spacing of VS2, which greatly improves the Mg2+ diffusion coefficient and structural stability (Fig. 8e and f).75,76 Therefore, these expanded VS2 cathodes exhibit excellent electrochemical Mg storage performance. In addition, the layered WS2–graphene composite also exhibits excellent Mg storage capacity and cycling stability benefiting from the stability and excellent conductivity of the carbon backbone, which provides a physical support for metal sulfides and facilitates ion and electron transport during the charge–discharge process.78

2.2 Transition metal selenides
In analogous transition metal selenides, Se occupies the original S sites to provide larger Mg2+ diffusion channels with weaker interactions between the Mg2+ ions and the basic lattice, and higher electronic conductivity, thereby lowering the migration barriers to Mg2+ diffusion.79 Gu et al. reported the effect of electronic structure on the Mg insertion into microsized TiSe2 with a d–p orbital hybridized electronic structure as a cathode material for RMBs.80 They found that the charge delocalization caused by strong d–p orbital hybridization in metal–ligand units can improve the reversible performance of Mg2+ intercalation/deintercalation. Nevertheless, the operating voltage (∼1.0 V) and capacity (108 mA h g−1) of TiSe2 are only equivalent to those of the Chevrel phase compound Mo6S8.11 Nano-sized materials proved to be beneficial for magnesium ion migration because of the short diffusion path. Shen and co-workers synthesized WSe2 nanowires (7–100 nm) using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) route from the reaction of Se powder and W foil. As shown in Fig. 9b, the unique nanowire morphology provides efficient Mg2+ insertion active sites and a short diffusion path. Thus, the WSe2 nanowire-based electrode was observed to have a stable discharge capacity of 203 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, a voltage plateau of 1.6 V, and excellent rate performance (142 mA h g−1 at 800 mA g−1) (Fig. 9a).81 Tashiro et al. combined a micrometer-sized β-Cu2Se cathode with a Mg metal anode and Mg(AlCl2EtBu)2/THF electrolyte to measure the electrochemical performance.82 The β-Cu2Se electrode had an average specific capacity of 117 mA h g−1, which is 45% of the theoretical capacity (260 mA h g−1). Due to the highly mobile Cu+ cations that are disorderedly distributed among the Se atoms, non-stoichiometric Cu2−xSe with electronic conductivity 3000 times higher than that of stoichiometric Cu2Se is considered a promising Mg storage material. Xu et al. synthesized a starfish-like Cu2−xSe with hierarchical structure assembled as nanosheets, which delivers a high reversible capacity of 210 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, an excellent rate capability (100 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1), and superior cycling stability over 300 cycles.83 Recently, Cui et al. introduced cuprous ions, Cu+, originating from the Cu3Se2 cathode by a stationary process, as charge carriers to achieve fast cathode reaction kinetics.84 The faster kinetics of the magnesiation/de-magnesiation processes was mediated by the highly reversible chemical equilibrium involving Cu+ (equilibrium driven by reduction and oxidation of Cu+ as shown in Fig. 9c). After the conditioning process, this new Cu+-mediated magnesium cell exhibited a reversible specific capacity of 310 mA h g−1, low polarization, and excellent rate performance and cycling stability (Fig. 9d and e). However, its low average discharge voltage (<1 V vs. Mg/Mg2+) makes its practical application difficult. Ag2Se, which undergoes Mg2+ ion (de)intercalation by conversion reaction, was also considered as a RMB cathode.85 Mai and co-workers found that NbSe2 enables the intercalation/deintercalation of Mg2+ ions with a discharge plateau of 1.3 V.86 However, due to the strong polarization of Mg2+, the capacity of NbSe2 declines rapidly.

To date, only a few transition metal selenides have been applied for RMBs. Among these selenides, WSe2 nanowires are the most promising cathode materials for RMBs due to the capacity and discharge voltage plateaus. The regulation strategy based on the chemical equilibrium of cuprous ions provides new ideas for improving the cathode kinetics of RMBs. Further development of selenide cathode materials for RMBs with improved performance is necessary, probably by structural engineering and dimensional optimization.
2.3 Transition metal oxides
For optimal performance, a cathode material for RMBs should have at least the following two characteristics: high Mg2+ insertion voltage and high Mg2+ insertion capacity.21 Transition metal oxides achieve a high degree of ionic character and high anodic oxidation potentials because of the stable oxygen–metal bond.87 Various transition metal oxides based on an intercalation mechanism or conversion mechanism, such as V2O5, MnO2, MoO3, and TiO2, are used as cathode materials for RMBs.

2.3.1 Vanadium oxides. 
Novák et al. first reported that a layered V2O5 structure enabled the insertion of Mg2+ at room temperature.88 Subsequently, work on a layered V2O5 cathode for RMBs concentrated on exploring the mechanism of Mg2+ insertion and the improvement of electrochemical performance. The Mg2+ intercalation mechanism of V2O5 has been recently expounded by first-principles calculations.89,90 With the increase of Mg insertion content (0 → 0.5 → 1), V2O5 undergoes a structural transformation from α-V2O5 to ε-Mg0.5V2O5 and δ-MgV2O5.89 Mg insertion into α-V2O5 is favorable for increasing the electronic conductivity of the electrode material, as the band gap of magnesiated V2O5 is decreased. Thus, the migration energy of Mg2+ in δ-MgV2O5 (0.68 eV) is lower than that of ε-Mg0.5V2O5 (1.06 eV) and α-V2O5 (1.30 eV) (Fig. 10). The diffusion of Mg in α-V2O5 was described as a one-dimensional hopping process along the b axis with a preference for the site that is above and near the center of the quadrilateral composed of four V atoms.89,90 Compared to α-V2O5, δ-V2O5 exhibits better Mg mobility and higher voltage and is considered to be a promising cathode for RMBs. However, δ-V2O5 is thermodynamically stable only in an almost fully discharged state91,92 and may change its intrinsic structure over a wide range of intercalated-Mg concentrations.89 Fu et al. built a unique battery system of V2O5|Mg(ClO4)2/AN|MgxMo6S8 and used in operando synchrotron diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy to confirm the structural evolution and charge compensation mechanisms of α-V2O5 in RMBs.93

Reducing the particle size,94 introducing water into the electrolyte and/or structure,95 or both,95–98 increasing the interlayer spacing,99 incorporating carbon materials and cation pre-intercalation100,101 are effective strategies for improving the electrochemical performance of V2O5. Rajh and co-workers studied the electrochemical performance of Mg insertion using a nanoribbon of bilayered V2O5 electrochemically grown on a carbon nanofoam (CNF) as a cathode material in Mg(ClO4)2/acetonitrile electrolyte.94 This open-framework electrode exhibited a first discharge capacity of 240 mA h g−1. However, with further cycling, the capacity dropped sharply. Mukherjee et al. designed a monodisperse spherical V2O5 with a hierarchical architecture through a facile and scalable method. The material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 225 mA h g−1 and stable capacity of ∼190 mA h g−1 in the anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2–AN electrolyte system.95 Novak and Burrell demonstrated that the polarization of Mg2+ is reduced by introducing a small amount of H2O into the electrolyte thus significantly improving the capability of Mg2+ extraction.88,96 Subsequently, Ceder and co-workers found that the discharge voltage of xerogel–V2O5 can be increased by co-intercalation of water with Mg2+.97 The coordination of water in the electrolyte and the structured water in xerogel–V2O5 improves the performance of V2O5.97,98 Perera et al. introduced PEO into the layers of V2O5 xerogels, increasing the interlayer spacing from 11.6 to 12.6 Å.99 The incorporation of PEO shields the Mg2+ ions from strong interaction with the host lattice and improves Mg2+ mobility. Thus, the V2O5–PEO nanocomposite showed fivefold higher discharge capacity than the V2O5 xerogel. Incorporating carbon and mixing with other metal composites are other effective ways to improve the Mg2+ storage capacity of V2O5. Mai and co-workers synthesized hydrated V2O5 nanowire/graphene nanocomposites with large surface area and excellent structural stability. A discharge capacity of up to 330 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.02 A g−1 was obtained.100 The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to bi-continuous electron/ion pathways and rapid insertion kinetics of Mg2+ ions shielded by crystal water. V2O5 nanoclusters supported on porous carbon frameworks synthesized by Cheng et al. showed a capacity exceeding 300 mA h g−1 at 40 mA g−1.101 Compared to poly-crystalline V2O5, amorphous V2O5–P2O5 cathodes with 75:25 (V2O5:P2O5) ratio exhibited an improved high-voltage electrochemical magnesiation.102 The manipulation of the inter-layer spacing and amorphization of V2O5 can enhance Mg2+ diffusion. Recently, Mai et al. obtained a Mg2+ pre-intercalated hydrated vanadium oxide, Mg0.3V2O5·1.1H2O (Fig. 11a), with high electronic conductivity, fast ion mobility, and good structural stability.103 As a Mg intercalation cathode, the Mg0.3V2O5·1.1H2O showed good rate performance (50 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1) and unprecedented cycling stability (capacity retention of 80.0% after 10000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1) (Fig. 11b–d). Ouyang found that the Mg-ion migration energy barrier in the hydrogenated α-V2O5 (HxV2O5) decreased to 0.56 eV when x = 2.104 This promises better prospects for the use of V2O5 as a high performance RMB cathode material.

Several other vanadium-based materials, such as VO2(B),105 VOx (ref. 106 and 107) and vanadium bronzes108,109 have been introduced as cathode materials in RMBs. Chen and co-workers studied the electrochemical performance of Mg insertion using VO2(B) nanorods as a cathode material.105 An initial discharge specific capacity of 391 mA h g−1 was obtained at 25 mA g−1 with a discharge voltage of 2.17 V (vs. Mg/Mg2+). Kim et al. found that V3+ ions in VOx nanotubes had a lower charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface and high kinetics of Mg2+ migration.106 However, interfacial reaction products formed by decomposition of the electrolyte during charging may cause the degradation of electrochemical performance.107 In addition, layered vanadium bronzes are also promising cathode materials for RMBs because of the stable crystalline framework with ion-linked inter-layer structure and large layer spacing for ion storage and transport. Mai et al. studied the effects of pre-insertion of different alkali metal ions into the crystal structure on the structural stability and electrochemical performance of layered vanadium bronze V3O8 (Fig. 12a and c).108 By comparison, NaV3O8 exhibited longer cycling stability and higher specific capacity, benefiting from the large radius cation pre-intercalation as an interlayer pillar to stabilize the interlayer structure and more magnesium ion insertion active sites provided by the unique crystal structure of V3O8 (Fig. 12b). Subsequently, they further reported that Na2V6O16·1.63H2O RMB cathodes with interlayer metal ions and structured water as the pillars exhibited better structural stability and high ion mobility (Fig. 12d–g).109

2.3.2 Molybdenum oxides. 
Orthorhombic MoO3 is considered an excellent intercalation host for guest ions, such as Li+ and Mg2+, owing to its unique layered structure. The insertion behavior of Mg2+ in MoO3 was first demonstrated by Gregory.110 The structural change of the host material during the cycling results in a rapidly decaying capacity. Wan et al. found that anions in different electrolytes have different effects on Mg2+ desolvation chemistry on MoO3 surfaces.111 Therefore, it is important to choose a suitable electrolyte to evoke the electrochemical properties of MoO3. Gershinsky et al. synthesized a film-like orthorhombic MoO3 electrode (nanoscale thickness and particle size), which had a relatively high capacity of 220 mA h g−1 at a potential around 1.8 V (vs. Mg2+/Mg).112 Prendergast and co-workers found that the mild fluorination of α-MoO3 (MoO2.8F0.2) can slightly reduce the lattice energy of MoO3 and increase the electronic conductivity and the Mg2+ ion diffusion kinetics.113,114


2.3.3 Titanium oxides. 
Anatase TiO2, a typical lithium intercalation electrode material with good stability and low discharge rate, has also shown potential as a RMB cathode candidate.115 Zhao et al. studied the insertion process of Mg ions in anatase TiO2 in APC electrolyte and confirmed that Mg can be inserted into anatase. However, due to strong coulombic ion–lattice interactions, slow Mg2+ diffusion and inhibited reversible intercalation on practical timescales resulted in poor electrochemical activity.116 Defect engineering is an effective strategy to improve TiO2 performance.117–120 Koketsu et al. found that F-doped anatase TiO2 with a large number of charge-compensating titanium vacancies (cation-deficiency) provides intercalation sites for Mg ions, thereby improving electrochemical performance toward Mg intercalation.117 Jin and co-workers synthesized ultrathin black TiO2−x (B-TiO2−x) nanoflakes with rich oxygen vacancies (OVs) and porosity utilizing an atomic substitution strategy.119 The introduction of OVs can remarkably enhance the electrical conductivity and increase the number of active sites for Mg2+ ion storage. The vacancy-rich B-TiO2−x nanoflakes exhibit a reversible capacity of about 150 mA h g−1 and good cycling stability (over 300 cycles at 300 mA g−1). It is worth mentioning that the introduction of Ti vacancies in metastable brookite TiO2 (Ti-deficient TiO2(B)) by F doping also achieved a high reversible capacity of 165.3 mA h g−1 and good cycling stability.120


2.3.4 Manganese oxides. 
MnO2 is considered to be a highly promising candidate for cathode materials for RMBs attributed to the easy synthesis, the abundant polymorphism and easily tuned electrochemical properties.121 Zhang et al. reported that nano-sized α-MnO2 with a (2 × 2) tunnel structure yielded a high initial discharge capacity of about 280 mA h g−1. But the subsequent cycles showed rapid capacity decay.122 Arthur also studied the Mg2+ insertion mechanism of K-αMnO2. The gradual reduction of K-αMnO2 was presumed to form Mn2O3 and then MnO at the interface, finally resulting in the formation of the K-αMnO2@(Mg, Mn)O core–shell product after full discharge.123 Contrary to the conversion reaction mechanism observed in α-MnO2, an intercalation mechanism was proposed by Kim for the insertion of Mg2+ into spinel-MnO2.124 Ling et al. confirmed that α-MnO2 formed a conversion type cathode with unstable intercalation products and large structural deformation after Mg insertion, whereas spinel-MnO2 was shown to be a promising candidate for Mg intercalation.125 Nevertheless, the lower levels of Mg2+ intercalation suggest considerable kinetic barriers in solid-state active materials. Aurbach's group found that the synergistic effect of crystal water shielding and hydration of Mg2+ in water-containing electrolyte can induce birnessite MnO2 to provide a high discharge capacity (227.6 mA h g−1) at a high discharge voltage (2.8 V vs. Mg2+/Mg).126 Nazar et al. suggested that in nonaqueous electrolyte, birnessite MnO2 participates in a conversion mechanism, and in aqueous cells in an intercalation mechanism (Fig. 13a).127 Water-activated MnO2 formed by pre-cycling in water-containing electrolyte can facilitate Mg2+ insertion/extraction capacities even in nonaqueous electrolyte (Fig. 13b)128 Reducing the size of the material129 and increasing the interlayer spacing130,131 have also been proven to be effective strategies for improving the performance of MnO2.

2.4 Other cathode materials
Some other materials with different structures have also been studied as cathode materials for RMBs. Because of the structural stability and environmental benignity, polyanionic compounds with olivine shaped crystal structure are considered as potential cathode materials for RMBs. Various olivine structured materials, such as MgMnSiO4,132 MgFeSiO4,133 and MgCoSiO4,134 and spinel structured materials, such as MgV2O4,135 MgMn2O4,136 MgCrMnO4 (ref. 137), etc., were reported. These olivine structured materials exhibited high discharge capacities and high operating voltages, as shown in Table 1. Mai et al. obtained polyanion VOPO4 with an expanded layer spacing of 1.42 nm, which shows superior rate capability (109 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1) and good cycling stability (192 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 100 mA g−1).138 NASICON structured compounds, including Na3V2(PO4)3,139 Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3,140 Li3V2(PO4)3 (ref. 141), etc. with 3D open frameworks allowing rapid ion diffusion inside, are also used as cathode materials for RMBs. Other compounds with an open framework structure such as Prussian Blue also attracted the attention of researchers.142,143 The unique metal–organic framework structure provides larger inserted sites to allow rapid insertion/extraction of Mg2+ ions. However, the cycling performance of these materials in organic electrolytes needs to be further improved. Recently, organic materials were also investigated as cathode materials for RMBs because of the properties of redox organic groups and adjustable electrochemical performance.144–147 Thus these materials can exhibit excellent cycling life and high discharge capacity. In addition, the construction of a dual-ion battery, the use of Li+ ion rapid (de)intercalation at the cathode to achieve high capacity, high rate, long cycle life Mg–Li hybrid batteries is also promising.148

3. Electrolytes
In the development of RMBs, since the Mg metal anode reacts with most conventional electrolytes containing polar non-protonic solvents (carbonates, nitriles, lactones, esters, etc.) and salt anions (Mg(ClO4)2, Mg(BF4)2, or Mg(PF6)2, etc.) resulting in a passivation layer that contains non-conductive Mg2+, this incompatibility between the anode and the electrolyte has become the main obstacle to the practical application of RMBs.12,13,15,149 Therefore, researchers have made efforts to synthesize electrolyte systems with Mg reversible electrochemical deposition/exfoliation and modification performances and have attained many achievements. In the following sections, we introduce recent advances in organic solvent-based electrolytes, ionic liquid-based electrolytes, and polymer-based solid electrolytes, respectively.
3.1 Organic solvent-based Mg electrolytes
The electrolyte plays a role in transferring ions between the cathode and anode, which is a key factor affecting the performance of the battery. The development of electrolytes has been considered as one of the most important challenges for the commercialization of RMBs. An appropriate electrolyte formulation for RMBs must be stable toward both Mg metal and the cathode material and must have a wide electrochemical window.12 Earlier studies showed that using Grignard reagents (R–MgX, R = alkyl or aryl group, X = Br, Cl) as the Lewis base with Al or B based Lewis acids in THF results in a passivation-free Mg surface and enables reversible Mg deposition–dissolution with a high coulombic efficiency.11,12 However, the intrinsically strong nucleophilic R groups with reducing properties (EtMgBr and BuMgCl are oxidized at 1.5 V vs. Mg2+/Mg) result in poor anodic stability, which leads to restrictions on their practical applications for RMBs.150,151 The magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolyte composed of Mg2+-containing Lewis bases (Bu2Mg, PhMgCl) and Lewis acids (AlCl3 or AlCl2Et) has an anodic stability >2.5 V.11,152 For example, the all-phenyl-complex PhMgCl–AlCl3/THF (APC) electrolyte has an anodic potential of 3.0 V vs. Mg2+/Mg and supports highly reversible Mg deposition (100% cycling efficiency).153 Further, Liao et al. found that replacing the alkyl groups with alkoxides (n-BuOMgCl, tert-BuOMgCl, or Me3SiOMgCl) can enhance the anodic stability (above 2.5 V vs. Mg2+/Mg) and the ionic conductivity of Grignard reagents.153 However, electrolytes involving such salts still struggle to meet the expected criterion of a wide voltage window. Improving the anodic stabilities of electrolytes by regulating the properties of the R groups in the Grignard reagents was also investigated. These types of electrolytes, such as HMDS–MgCl–AlCl3 (HMDS = hexamethyldisilazide),154 (HMDS)2Mg–AlCl3,155 Mg(HMDS)2–MgCl2,156 and (HMDS)2Mg–AlCl3 (ref. 157–160) in ethers (THF, tetraglyme (G4), diglyme (G2) or DME), show a much higher oxidation potential (up to 3.2 V vs. Mg2+/Mg). The active species present in these electrolytes include anions such as [HMDSAlCl3]−, [(HMDS)2AlCl2]−, and [HMDSMgCl2]−, and cations such as [MgCl]+ and [Mg2Cl3]+. [Mg2Cl3]+, formed from MgCl2, reacts with [MgCl]+ and is stabilized by coordinating with the ethereal oxygen atoms from the solvent, which enables Mg deposition and dissolution.34 These electrolytes are generally used in Mg–S batteries due to their non-nucleophilic properties. Unfortunately, the complicated preparation process and high cost of the HMDSMgCl based electrolyte are not conductive to practical applications.
Several Mg electrolytes containing simple magnesium salts, such as MgCl2 or/both Mg(TFSI)2 (TFSI = bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) and AlCl3, have been developed.12,151,161–165 By combining MgCl2 and the Lewis acid AlCl3 in THF or DME, the magnesium–aluminium–chloro complex (MACC) exhibits as high as 99% coulombic efficiency, a deposition overpotential of <200 mV, and an anodic stability of 3.1 V vs. Mg2+/Mg.151 Although MgCl2 is slightly soluble in ether, the presence of AlCl3 can enhance the formation of the [Mg2Cl3]+ dimer and promote the dissolution of MgCl2 in ether solvents.161,162 Typically, in the MACC/THF electrolyte, the reaction equation can be written as163 2MgCl2 + AlCl3 + 6THF → [Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF]+ + AlCl4−(5)
The electrochemically active [Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF]+ ions play an important role in the deposition of magnesium.165,166 However, in this electrolyte system, to obtain a reasonable electrochemical performance (more [Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF]+ in electrolyte), an electrochemical conditioning process (Fig. 14b and g) following reaction eqn (6), which occurs in the continuous cyclic voltammogram scans over 30 cycles, was essential.163–165 4AlCl4− + 6Mgmetal + 18THF → 3[Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF]+ + 4Almetal + 7Cl−(6)

Recent studies confirmed that by adding highly toxic CrCl3,167 Mg powder,168 Mg(HMDS)2,169 Mg(TFSI)2 (ref. 170) or/and heptamethyldisilazane (HpMS)171 to MACC electrolytes, conditioning-free electrolytes can be obtained. It is worth mentioning that the addition of Mg(TFSI)2 into the MACC electrolyte in THF significantly improved the electrochemical performance of the Mg metal at the beginning (conditioning-free following reaction eqn (7), as well as excellent water-tolerance properties (even up to 2000 ppm) (Fig. 14a–f)).170 3MgCl2 + Mg(TFSI)2 + 12THF → 2[Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF]+ + 2TFSI−(7)
HpMS achieves the same effect as the electrochemical conditioning process by removing traces of water from the electrolyte and removing Mg(OH)2 from the Mg surface.171
All the electrolytes mentioned above include chloride (Cl−) anions, which are important for deposition of Mg. The free Cl− anion in electrolytes can adsorb onto the electrode surface and disrupt any passivating layer, which was formed due to the presence of trace impurities such as H2O and O2 in the electrolyte, to enhance Mg electrodeposition (Fig. 14g).164 Recent studies have also shown that Cl-containing compounds adsorbed on the electrode surface have a lower activation energy for the interfacial charge transfer stage (migration of Mg2+ ions from solution to the crystalline phase).172 However, Cl− ions can also corrode the current collector and other metal battery components. Halide-free electrolytes or low-corrosive electrolytes have recently received much attention. Adding LiBH4 or Mg(BH4)2 in THF or DME showed reversible Mg reduction and oxidation with efficiencies of 94%.173 However, the low anodic stability of (BH4)− (1.7 V vs. Mg2+/Mg) does not meet the expected requirements of the electrolyte. With the addition of THFPB (tris(2H-hexafluoroisopropyl)borate), the anodic stability of the Mg(BH4)2/diglyme electrolyte can be increased to 2.8 V (vs. Mg2+/Mg) with high coulombic efficiency (>99%).174 The selection of suitable solvents and functional additives is feasible for improving the electrochemical stability window of Mg(BH4)2-based electrolytes.12 Mg(TFSI)2 in glyme-based solvents demonstrated anodic stability up to 3.0 V (vs. Mg2+/Mg) on a stainless steel electrode and up to 2.5 V on an Al electrode.175 Leprêtre et al. reported Mg(TFSI)2 + anthracene in glyme electrolyte for RMBs, which exhibits an electrochemical stability window of up to 3.1 V.176 Chlorine-free electrolytes obtained using secondary amine cosolvent-promoted Mg(TFSI)2 salts dissolved in a wide array of polar but aprotic ether solvents also exhibited reversible plating and stripping of Mg with a CE up to 90%.177 Although these electrolytes are free of chloride ions and do not cause corrosion of the current collector, they exhibit low Mg plating/stripping kinetics.176,177 Subsequent experiments proved that adding MgCl2 can enhance the plating/stripping kinetics, which may be due to the addition of chloride ions to help overcome the passivation of the Mg electrode.178 Subsequent studies revealed that the possible reason for the poorer deposition behavior in Mg(TFSI)2-based electrolytes is that the deposited Mg with main cluster structure is in point contact with the electrode, and the limited contact area impedes ion transport leading to sluggish electrode reaction.179 By introducing Mg(BH4)2 into the Mg(TFSI)2 based electrolyte, the stability of the electrolyte was significantly improved due to the remarkable increase in nucleation sites and the compact accumulation on the electrode during deposition. This finding provides new insights into the study of chlorine-free electrolytes. To obtain electrolytes for RMBs that meet the expected requirements, other Mg compounds such as Mg(PF6)2,180 Mg(C2H11B10)Cl,181 Mg(CB11H12)2,182 Mg(RCB11H11)2 and Mg(FCB11H11)2,183 borate-centered anion-based magnesium (BCM),184,185 MgB[(hfip)4]2 (hfip = hexafluoroisopropyloxy),186 Mg[B(O2C2(CF3)4)2]2 (Mg-FPB)187 and magnesium bis(diisopropyl)amide (MBA)188 were investigated; however, synthetic difficulty, poor compatibility with cathode materials, or a narrow electrochemical window might be a concern for these electrolytes.
In organic solvent-based electrolytes, Grignard-based electrolytes have high coulombic efficiency and low overpotential, but low anodic stability limits their application. Further development of chlorine-free electrolytes is also limited by the stability of some of the anions in the electrolyte. The improvements in the oxidation stability of the electrolyte during the continuous development process are very impressive. However, due to stringent requirements, low-cost commercially available magnesium analogs of lithium salts cannot be used in typical high dielectric constant solvents. The complex synthesis process of magnesium salts in some new electrolytes can be costly and become a new barrier to the development of electrolytes. Further search for new non-corrosive electrolytes with simple magnesium salts as solutes with high oxidation stability is necessary.
3.2 Ionic liquid-based Mg electrolytes
Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have been widely investigated in LIB applications.41 This class of electrolytes has many desirable properties ranging from low volatility, non-flammability, high thermal stability, and wide electrochemical stability window to good conductivity and tunability of cationic/anionic groups.189 They were also explored as alternative electrolytes in RMBs. The electrochemical reversibility of Mg in imidazolium based ILs, such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMImI4) with MgI2,190 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMImBF4) with MgCl2,191 and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMImCl) with MACC,192 was investigated. In this type of electrolyte, the Lewis acid AlX3 (X = Cl, I) and Lewis base MgX2 (X = Cl, I) in the solution generated the active species for reversible Mg deposition/stripping by a transmetallation reaction with the production of free halide ions, similar to the above mentioned MACC electrolytes.41 The reversible Mg reduction and oxidation were also demonstrated in ether-based IL electrolytes containing Mg(BH4)2.189,193Fig. 15a shows a typical coordination structure of the Mg2+ complex, and these Mg2+ ions formed a strongly bound hepta-coordinated complex by coordinating with (TFSI)− and (BH4)− anions and the IL cation. The cationic polyether oxygen coordination to Mg2+ can replace (TFSI)− and promote the dissociation of Mg2+ ions from Mg(BH4)2, to improve reversible electrochemical deposition and dissolution of Mg.193,194

(b) Linear sweep voltammograms of a series of electrolytes combining 0.4 M PhMgCl with a different molar concentration of ILs in THF: (i) 0.1 M, (ii) 0.2 M, and (iii) 0.4 M N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium chloride (BMPyrrCl) and (iv) 0.4 M N-allyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium chloride (AMPyrrCl). Reproduced from ref. 198, copyright 2018, Royal Society of Chemistry. 
In most cases, hybrid electrolytes based on mixtures of ILs and ether-based (THF, glyme, etc.) organic solvents was investigated for applications in RMBs. The hybrid electrolytes result in improved electrochemical and physical properties. Thus far, ILs such as N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium-bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (DEME·TFSI),195,196N-butyl-n-methyl-pyrrolidinium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (C4mpyr·TFSI),197 and others, when mixed with ethereal solvents, have been shown to support reversible Mg deposition/stripping with various Mg salts, including Grignard salts, Mg organohaloaluminates, MACC, Mg(BH4)2, and Mg(TFSI)2.36 Compared to neat organic solvent based electrolytes or neat IL Mg electrolytes, these mixed electrolytes have higher conductivity, enhanced active-ion transfer and wider electrochemical voltage windows (Fig. 11b).195,198 For example, the mixed electrolyte composed of EtMgBr/THF and DEME·TFSI showed higher ionic conductivity (7.44 mS cm−1 at 25 °C) than that of neat EtMgBr/THF (0.33 mS cm−1) or DEMETFSI (2.73 mS cm−1).176 In comparison to an organic solvent electrolyte, adding ILs can also enhance the thermal stability of Mg electrolytes.197
IL-based electrolytes are considered to be potentially promising electrolytes for RMBs; however, the problems to be solved are lower conductivity, higher interfacial impedance, and poor compatibility with cathode materials. Mixed electrolyte systems containing ILs, with better electrochemical performances, will be an important direction in the future research on electrolytes for RMBs.
3.3 Polymer-based solid Mg electrolytes
In addition to the liquid electrolyte systems mentioned above, polymer-based solid electrolytes may be another promising candidates for Mg electrolytes, because of their enormous advantages such as not causing internal short circuits, no electrolyte leakage, and high electrochemical and thermal stabilities.199,200 Besides high ionic conductivity, polymer-based solid electrolytes with excellent electrochemical performance should have the following characteristics: very low electronic conductivity, single mobile active ion species, high transference number, wide electrochemical window, and good compatibility with metallic magnesium and high-voltage cathodes.199 The polymer electrolyte is a combination of magnesium salt, such as Mg(ClO4)2, Mg[(CF3SO2)2N]2, MgCl2 or Mg(CF3SO3)2, and polymer matrices such as PEO or polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN).12,199,201 In earlier studies, Mg(ClO4)2–PEO and MgCl2–PEO polymer electrolytes exhibited ionic conductivities of 10−6 and 10−9 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively.201,202 However, these salts are incompatible with Mg metal electrodes, which do not meet the requirements of polymer Mg2+ electrolytes. Furthermore, the Mg(AlCl2EtBu)2–PVDF–tetraglyme polymer electrolyte obtained by dissolving a magnesium-metal-compatible salt (magnesium organo-haloaluminate, Mg(AlCl2EtBu)2) in the polymer matrices of PEO and PVDF, plasticized with small amounts of THF and tetraglyme, exhibited high ionic conductivity up to 3.7 mS cm−1 at 25 °C and a wide electrochemical window (2.5 V).20 The electrolytes showed good compatibility of magnesium metal and cathode materials (Chevrel-phase Mo6S8).
The key challenge is to improve the ionic conductivity and transfer number of the polymer electrolyte at room temperature. The ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes depends on the ability of salts to dissociate in polymer electrolytes.199 Using mixed polymer matrixes,20,203,204 plasticizers,203 borate ester,205,206 ILs,207etc. has been shown to be an effective strategy to improve the ionic conductivity and transfer number of polymer electrolytes. Recently, Du et al. proposed a novel polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF)-borate-based gel polymer electrolyte (PTB@GF-GPE), synthesized by in situ cross-linking reaction of Mg(BH4)2 and hydroxyl-terminated PTHF inside a glass fiber (GF) membrane (Fig. 16a).200 The PTB@GF-GPE exhibited reversible Mg plating/stripping performance, a high ionic conductivity of 4.76 × 10−3 mS cm−1, a high transfer number of 0.73 at room temperature and excellent compatibility with a Mg-metal anode. Moreover, the Mg//PTB@GF-GPEs//Mo6S8 batteries delivered outstanding cycling stability (near-perfect coulombic efficiency with a capacity of 74 mA h g−1 over 250 cycles at 64 mA g−1) and excellent rate capability in a wide operating temperature range (−20 to 60 °C) (Fig. 12b–d). Dispersing ceramic filler particles (SiO2,208 MgO,209 TiO2 (ref. 210), etc.) into the polymer matrix is also an effective strategy to improve the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte. This opens up the opportunities for the further development of polymer solid electrolytes.

Some novel materials with high Mg2+ mobility, such as MgSc2Se4, were also investigated for their possibility as solid electrolytes, but they also have high electronic conductivity, which prohibits their use as solid electrolytes.211 Research on Mg solid electrolytes is still in the nascent stage, and the main challenges are poor electrolyte–Mg metal compatibility, high electrode–electrolyte interface impedance, and low ionic conductivity. Therefore, the development of Mg solid electrolytes that can achieve reversible deposition of Mg and high ionic conductivity is the focus of future Mg solid electrolyte research.
4. Anode materials
Unlike alkali metals (Li, Na, and K), the lower reactivity of Mg in the atmosphere allows commercial pure Mg metal to be used directly as an anode, and Mg metal easily forms a smooth and uniform deposition layer during the charging process. This Mg deposition behavior effectively avoids the formation of magnesium dendrites and is therefore very safe, although Mg metal electrodeposition is not completely free of dendrite formation in all situations.13 However, in most polar organic electrolytes, the surface of the Mg metal forms a non-conducting Mg2+ passivation layer, which can severely hinder the reversible deposition and dissolution of Mg.212,213 Therefore, it is crucial to develop an anode that can effectively avoid passivation layer formation with improved Mg kinetics. At this stage, researchers' work is focused on modified Mg metal anodes, low-potential insertion Mg materials and alloy-based insertion-type materials.
4.1 Modification of Mg metal
The passivation layer irreversibly formed on the surface of a Mg electrode (unlike the Li+-conducting solid–electrolyte interphase) will block the Mg2+ diffusion channels, thereby hindering the reversible plating/stripping of Mg2+.213,214 Nanoscale materials often yield some inspiring results. Liang et al. prepared ultrasmall Mg nanoparticles (N-Mg) as an active anode by ionic liquid-assisted chemical reduction.53 Compared to bulk Mg, N-Mg exhibited better cycling when assessed under the same conditions with graphene-like MoS2 as the cathode. N-Mg with the decreased thickness of the surface film effectively enhanced Mg diffusion kinetics.13,53 The unfavorable effects of the passivation layer can also be mitigated effectively by modifying the surface of the Mg metal. Yim et al. proposed a chemical pre-treatment of the Mg anode using a titanium complex, Ti(TFSI)2Cl2, which remarkably decreases the binding affinity between Mg and O by the formation of a multicoordinate complex (Mg–O–Ti) (Fig. 17a).215 The subsequent chemical reactions effectively remove the native oxide layer on the Mg anode surface, which tends to improve the electrochemical performance.

Recently, Son et al. constructed a Mg2+-conductive polymer interphase (about 100 nm thick, Fig. 17b) on the surface of a Mg metal electrode by thermally cross-linking polyacrylonitrile, Mg(CF3SO3)2, and carbon black.216 The elastic and Mg2+-conducting artificial membrane on the surface of Mg metal can allow Mg2+ to migrate (ionic conductivity 1.19 × 10−6 S cm−1) and effectively prevent the electrochemical reduction of the electrolyte and the water therein (Fig. 17c and d). This strategy provides a solution for the compatibility between Mg metal anodes, oxidation-resistant electrolytes, and high-voltage cathodes. Similarly, Cui et al. constructed a stable SEI on the surface of the Mg anode by partial decomposition of the Li[B(hfip)4] electrolyte during the electrochemical process, which is able to conduct Mg2+ and prevent further side reactions between the Mg anode and the electrolyte, enabling the electrolyte to achieve long-term stable electrochemical cycling.217 Cao et al. formed a chemically inert (electrically insulated) magnesium fluoride (MgF2) layer by a controlled reaction of the Mg surface with hydrofluoric acid.218 Unlike most Mg passivation films, the MgF2 passivation layer not only inhibits the side reaction with the electrolyte but also allows the transport of Mg2+ between the electrode and the electrolyte. Luo et al. created a self-healing Ge-based protection layer on the Mg metal surface by adding GeCl4 into the Mg(TFSI)2/DME electrolyte (with excess GeCl4 in the electrolyte).219 The Ge-based protection layer provides a pathway for the rapid migration of Mg2+ and prevents the formation of passivation films on the Mg anode surface. Even at high current densities (10 mA cm−2), a low and stable magnesium deposition/dissolution overpotential was shown in the GeCl4-containing ether electrolyte.
A stable Mg2+-conducting surface film, also termed the “artificial SEI”, can be formed on the surface of the Mg anode by using appropriate solvents, salts and/or additives.220,221 This surface film enables the Mg metal anode to combine with the traditional electrolyte to build rechargeable Mg battery systems, which points to a new direction for the development of Mg metal anodes for rechargeable Mg batteries.
4.2 Mg2+ insertion materials
Insertion type anodes capable of insertion/extraction of Mg at lower potentials were explored to try to solve the problem posed by the passivation film.13,222 Insertion anodes are compatible with electrolytes made from Mg ionic salts in polar aprotic solvents, but there are also some challenges such as relatively low Mg insertion/extraction kinetics, high volume expansion, and electrode fragmenting.222 Er et al. predicted the adsorption behavior of Mg2+ ions on defective graphene and graphene allotropes as anode materials by first-principles density functional theory.223 They found that graphene with 25% divacancy defects can achieve a Mg storage capacity as high as 1042 mA h g−1. Vessally et al. studied the adsorption of Mg2+ and Mg on nanostructured carbons such as nanocones, nanotubes (4,0), nanosheets, and C60 nanocages.224 This research pointed out that these nanostructured carbon materials are appropriate as anodes of RMBs. Kim and co-workers achieved reversible insertion and extraction in graphite by solvated Mg2+ ions. A graphite/Mg cell with 0.3 M Mg(TFSI)2 in DME/DEGDME showed a constant capacity of 180 mA h g−1 (DEGDME: diethylene glycol dimethyl ether).225 The compatibility of the carbon-based material with most electrolytes makes it a promising alternative for Mg cell anodes. Spinel Li4Ti5O12 was reported as an intercalation-type anode material for RMBs by Guo et al.226–228 The results showed that the electrochemical insertion of Mg2+ in LTO is strongly size-dependent, and only when the particle size is less than 40 nm, significant Mg2+ insertion can be achieved. LTO nanoparticles 7–8 nm in size showed a high reversible capacity (175 mA h g−1 at 15 mA g−1) (Fig. 18a) and superior cycling performance (over 500 cycles) (Fig. 18b), benefiting from the low-strain characteristics of LTO.227 By using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, LTO was found to exhibit an insertional Mg-ion storage capacity by the gradual replacement of Li ions by Mg ions, and this Mg insertion transforms LTO into spinel magnesium titanate.226 Interestingly, tuning the Li+ activity in the electrolyte by adding LiCl to the pure magnesium electrolyte (Mg(AlCl2BuEt2)2/THF) enabled LTO with large particles to also exhibit remarkably improved reversible capacity and kinetics.228 Chen et al. reported layered Na2Ti3O7 nanoribbons for reversible electrochemical Mg storage.229 With 0.5 M Mg2+ reversibly occupying the sites of Na+ coordinated to seven oxygen atoms (Fig. 18c), a specific capacity of 78 mA h g−1 was achieved in practical tests (Fig. 18d) Subsequently, Luo et al. reported a Na2Ti6O13 anode, with better structural stability during the Mg2+ insertion/extraction processes, exhibiting a higher discharge capacity of 165.8 mA h g−1 and more stable cycling stability.230 Zeng et al. introduced mesoporous Li3VO4/Carbon (LVO/C) hollow spheres as an effective anode for RMBs with a high discharge capacity of 318 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1.231 The unique structure of hollow spheres with high specific surface area effectively shortens the diffusion path for Mg2+ and enhances Mg2+ insertion kinetics. Ultrathin TiO2-B nanowires with a naked (−110) surface delivered a reversible Mg2+ ion capacity of 110 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1.232 Mg2+ ions coordinated with unpaired surface oxygen atoms, which avoided strong interactions between the Mg2+ ions and the host framework, resulting in excellent cycling stability (capacity loss of 0.08% per cycle).

Alloying-based anode materials were evaluated as anode materials for RMBs owing to their high theoretical specific capacity and ability to undergo reversible magnesiation/demagnesiation at a low potential.13,212 Arthur et al. studied the electrochemical performance of bismuth (Bi), antimony (Sb) and Bi1−xSbx alloys in conventional battery electrolytes.233 Bi and Bi0.88Sb0.12 alloy anodes demonstrated reversible insertion/extraction of Mg2+ with good cycling performance over 100 cycles. However, Sb showed poor cycling results, which may be caused by a huge volume change. Indium (In) and lead (Pb) were also shown to achieve reversible insertion/extraction of Mg2+ by alloying reactions with considerable capacity.234,235 Nevertheless, the rapid capacity decay that may be caused by interfacial side reactions is a hindrance to practicality. Among the materials mentioned above, the Bi anode exhibited a low Mg2+ insertion/extraction potential (+0.23/0.32 V vs. Mg2+/Mg) and high theoretical specific capacity of 385 mA h g−1, which is very attractive for anodes. Further, Shao et al. proposed Bi nanotubes to shorten the Mg2+ diffusion distance and accommodate the volume expansion during the insertion/extraction of Mg2+ ions, which showed a high specific capacity of 350 mA h g−1, excellent stability (capacity retention of 92.3% after 200 cycles), and high coulombic efficiency (close to 100%).236 Using colloidal Bi nanocrystals as a model anode material, Kravchyk et al. verified that the alloying reaction achieved the insertion of Mg2+ into the Bi material and formed α-Mg3Bi2 and β-Mg3Bi2 (Fig. 19a).237 Zhang et al. demonstrated a reversible two-step alloying reaction mechanism: Bi ↔ MgBi ↔ Mg3Bi2, with the use of X-ray diffraction and near-edge X-ray absorption. The presence of the intermediate phase MgBi can greatly reduce the volume expansion and promote Mg storing kinetics.238 Tan and co-workers assembled a Mg full battery by combining a Mg3Bi2 alloy nanocluster anode and Prussian Blue cathode; it exhibited stable cycling (capacity retention of 88% over 200 cycles at 200 mA g−1) and good rate capability (58 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1) (Fig. 19b).239 Guo et al. prepared BiOF nanosheets by solvent thermal methodology and utilized the conversion of BiOF to metallic Bi during the Mg2+ insertion/extraction process in a novel way to obtain a stable two-dimensional Bi anode.240 The space limitation in the in situ conversion process effectively mitigated the large volume change of metal Bi during the alloying reaction, allowing the anode material to exhibit not only a high reversible Mg storage capacity (335 mA h g−1) and excellent rate capability, but also an outstanding long cycle life. Zhang et al. designed a biphasic Pb0.7Bi0.3/Bi film via a convenient magnetron co-sputtering route. The well synergistic effect of the biphasic buffer matrix and the rich phase boundaries that mitigate the volume changes during alloying/de-alloying and promote Mg2+ ion transport make the Pb0.7Bi0.3/Bi film present outstanding electrochemical properties.241 Similar to Bi, tin (Sn), which has a higher theoretical capacity (903 mA h g−1) and lower Mg2+ insertion/extraction voltages (+0.15/0.20 V vs. Mg2+/Mg), is also regarded as a possible anode candidate.242,243 Singh et al. experimentally verified the reversible insertion/extraction of Mg2+ in the Sn anode, but it undergoes a slow electrochemical alloying reaction and rapid capacity decay.242 Subsequently, down-sizing Sn into nanoparticles was used to improve the electrochemical performance of the Sn anode. Parent et al. utilized the β-SnSb alloy as a precursor to in situ form nanosized Sn (33 ± 20 nm) by electrochemical regulation, resulting in effective Mg storage.244 The authors pointed out that the fast and fully reversible storage of Mg in Sn is highly dependent on the size and morphology of the Sn nanoparticles (<40 nm). Subsequently, Cheng et al. utilized the proposed β-SnSb alloy methodology to obtain a high-performance nanoparticulate Sn electrode for RMBs.245 It had a high discharge capacity (∼420 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1), good rate capability (∼300 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1) and excellent stability (capacity retention of 74% over 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1). Asl and co-workers studied reversible Mg storage in pure nanostructured Sn formed in situ from a Mg2Sn precursor.246 They used chemo-mechanical coupling associated with the tensile stresses arising during demagnesiation of micrometer-sized bulk Mg2Sn electrode materials, which promotes crack nucleation and propagation in the electrode material, to produce nanostructured Sn with a characteristic size in the 10–50 nm range. The method requires no sacrificial elements and is a cost-effective synthetic route for magnesium anodes. Pyo et al. constructed a 3Mg/Mg2Sn alloy which is composed of ternary phases (crystalline Mg-rich (c-Mg), amorphous Mg-rich (a-Mg), and intermetallic Mg2Sn phases). The reversible magnesiation/de-magnesiation in Mg2Sn and a-Mg was promoted by irreversible dissolution of c-Mg as the sacrificial phase during the first de-magnesiation process. As shown in Table 2, 3Mg/Mg2Sn exhibits excellent electrochemical performance.247 Combining the high capacity of Sn and the stable reversibility of Bi, a Bi–Sn alloy was proposed as an anode material for RMBs. As shown in Fig. 20a, using the X–Bi–Sn (X = Al or Mg) three-phase alloy as a precursor, by chemical dealloying or selective etching of the X phase, a dual-phase Bi–Sn alloy with a nanoporous structure and alternate phase distribution was obtained and used as an anode.248,249 The Bi–Sn alloys exhibit excellent Mg storage electrochemical performance compared to single phase Bi or Sn due to the fast Mg2+ transport channels provided by the increased phase/grain boundaries and the unique nanoporous structure that can accommodate large volume variations (Fig. 15b). Meanwhile, the introduction of Bi can effectively trigger the alloying reaction between Sn with Mg, thus significantly improving the electrochemical performance of the Si–Bi electrodes.250 Recently, Wang et al. obtained an alloying anode with an extremely long cycle life (over 1000 cycles) at a large current density (922.5 mA g−1) by solid–liquid phase transformation between Mg2Ga5 (solid) and Ga (liquid) at near room temperature (Fig. 20c and d).251 This concept opened the way to the development of practical anodes for next-generation RMBs. Mg2+ insertion materials based on magnesium ion insertion/extraction bypass the problem of surface passivation of Mg metal anodes and therefore can be compatible with conventional high voltage electrolytes. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between the divalent Mg2+ and the host materials (Li4Ti5O12, Li3VO4, TiO2-B, Na2Ti3O7, etc.) leads to poor diffusion kinetics, and in addition, the higher reaction potential and lower anode specific capacity substantially reduce the energy density of high-voltage Mg cells. The alloy-based anode based on the alloying reaction mechanism exhibited a high theoretical specific capacity. However, large volume changes during the cycling process may lead to structural damage and sustained capacity loss of the alloy anode.252 Alloy anode materials with reasonable cost effectiveness and long cycle life should be further developed using novel designs of a combination of alloy, electrolyte and electrode to mitigate the large volume changes.

5. Summary and outlook
The inexpensive, nontoxic, and safety characteristics of RMBs indicate excellent application prospects and development possibilities. However, the current research work on RMBs is still not satisfactory, and compared with lithium batteries, there is still a long way to go in terms of capacity, output voltage, and energy density. Therefore, the search for electrode materials with better electrochemical performance and the optimization of electrolyte systems are crucial for the realization of commercial applications of RMBs. In this review, we systematically summarized and discussed current advances in cathode materials, anode materials and electrolytes. For cathode materials, the Chevrel phase is considered the most promising electrode material for commercially viable Mg ion batteries due to its high electrical conductivity, excellent Mg ion diffusion capability and reversible Mg ion insertion/extraction performance. However, its inherent low discharge voltage plateau and low energy density are still major restrictions of this material. Some sulfides and selenides exhibit high theoretical specific capacities, but their charge/discharge voltages need to be increased. Transition metal oxides possess a high Mg ion insertion voltage, and improving the kinetics of Mg ions in such materials is critical. To date, there are few cathode materials that can provide rapid Mg ion insertion and extraction at room temperature, due to the slow kinetics caused by the divalent nature of Mg2+ and strong electrostatic interactions. For electrolytes, the development of Grignard-based electrolytes has matured considerably and other types of electrolytes have also been developed in the last few years. Although Cl− plays a very important role in the deposition and dissolution of Mg, the corrosion of the collector by Cl-containing electrolytes cannot be neglected in practice. Ionic liquid electrolytes have a wide and stable electrochemical window, but their conductivity should still be increased. Polymer solid electrolytes have the advantage of high safety, and further improving their ionic conductivity and poor compatibility with Mg metals is the focus. The incompatibility between electrolytes and electrodes (generating a passivation layer on the surface of magnesium metal with non-conducting Mg2+) reduces the suitability of conventional electrolytes for RMBs, thus creating a barrier for the development of electrolytes. For anodes, the construction of an “artificial SEI” on the surface of Mg metal provides a new way to alleviate the formation of a surface passivation layer. An anode using the insertion mechanism can effectively bypass the problem of the surface passivation layer on Mg metal. In particular, the compatibility of Mg alloy anodes with conventional electrolyte solutions has been successfully confirmed, and can provide a high energy density by combining high voltage/high specific capacity cathodes.
In summary, the challenges described above are addressed by the following trends in the development of key materials for RMBs: (1) innovative structural design of new cathode materials with enhanced Mg2+ diffusion kinetics, high voltage and high capacity. Structural innovation and nanodesign to reduce polarization, overcome the slow diffusion kinetics of Mg2+ ions, and construct new cathodes with fast Mg2+ ion transport are prerequisites for the commercialization of RMBs. (2) Developing electrolytes with passivation free performance, wide voltage window, no corrosion, low cost and high safety. The corrosion of the existing electrolyte containing chlorine to the current collector is a problem that cannot be ignored in the further development of RMBs. So the development of a new non-corrosive electrolyte constructed of simple Mg salt at low cost is imperative. (3) Further exploration on the Mg metal anode/electrolyte interface to construct an artificial interface on the Mg metal surface will expand the range for the selection of electrolytes and cathodes. In-depth exploration of the electrode/electrolyte interface reaction mechanism can provide more information for electrolyte design to construct stable electrode/electrolyte interfaces. With further optimization of electrolytes,253 and the development of high capacity, long-life electrode materials, high-performance RMBs could be applied practically and commercialized in the near future.
