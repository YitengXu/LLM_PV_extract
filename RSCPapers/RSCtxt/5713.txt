1 Introduction
In recent decades, the endless consumption of fossil fuel for meeting the ever-increasing energy demands in the modern society has caused severe environmental problems, e.g. greenhouse effect, water resources pollution and the very frequently occurring fog haze. To prevent further deterioration of the environment, much effort has been devoted to discovering earth-abundant energy alternatives and designing new sustainable as well as efficient energy storage systems (ESSs).1–3 Owing to the intermittence of natural renewable energy resources, such as solar, wind and tide, which strongly depend on time, weather and locations, the ESSs have been regarded as the key factor in building the bridge between the energy sources and power consumption, and it is also based on the consideration of the provided power reliability and unending supply. In this respect, rechargeable batteries, electrochemical capacitors and fuel cells come into being and are widely employed in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles and smart grids owing to their environmental benignity, long cycle life, and high power densities.4–6
Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also termed as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, are proposed as the most promising energy storage devices because of their high power density, fast charge/discharge rate, long lifespan and outstanding safety. Based on the energy storage mechanism of ECs, they can be classified as electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.7,8 In EDLCs, the capacitance emanates from the pure electrostatic adsorbed or accumulated charges on the electrode/electrolyte interface (like ideal capacitors), in which the electrode materials are mainly pure carbon materials, i.e. activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene.9 For pseudocapacitors, fast reversible reactions, such as underpotential deposition, redox pseudocapacitance, and intercalation pseudocapacitance, occur at the electrode/electrolyte interface or within the inner surface of the electroactive materials, which are mainly transition metal oxides (such as RuO2, MnO2 and Nb2O5) and/or conducting polymers.10 Though pseudocapacitors deliver higher capacitance and energy density than EDLCs, they suffer from the drawbacks of low power density and cycling stability. To circumvent these shortcomings, tremendous effort has been put in designing pseudocapacitor electrodes with various transition metal compounds.11–15
Recently, Ni compound-based electrode materials have been widely studied for achieving fast charge/discharge processes, high powerful performance and long cyclic life, which are typical characteristics of pseudocapacitors. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that the obviously separated redox peaks in cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and flat charge/discharge plateaus in galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) plots indicate that their charge storage mechanism is totally different from that of pseudocapacitor electrode materials. To differentiate the redox reaction mechanism as a pseudocapacitor- or battery-type mechanism, the peak current (i) vs. scan rate (v) at a fixed potential window in CVs should be identified, and the corresponding equation can be expressed as follows:16 i = avb(1)
For a battery-type redox reaction that is controlled by a semi-infinite diffusion, the value of the exponent (b) is 0.5. In a capacitive process, the exponent is proportional to the scan rate, i.e. i = av.17 Nevertheless, the kinetic process of the electrode is complex and often involves more than one mechanism, which means that the exponent (b) often takes a value between 0.5 and 1. Thus, some literature reports have assigned the Ni compound-based electrode materials to the battery-type energy storage mechanism.18–20 It is worth noting that many previous studies have confusedly reported that Ni compound-based materials exhibit pure pseudocapacitance. Very recently, some research studies pointed out that capacity (C or mA h) should be utilized as the unit, and not capacitance (F) in the assessment of the electrochemical performance of Ni compound-based materials.18 Compared with the traditional carbon-based electrodes, the Ni compound-based materials can offer several times higher charge storage capability in the same potential windows. In particular, the Ni compound-based materials with high capacity coupled with a capacitive carbon anode have great potential for configuration of hybrid devices with high power and energy. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to improving the electrochemical performance of Ni compound-based electrode materials, including designing specific 3D nanostructures, coordination with other metal elements or formation of composites with high surface area carbonaceous materials.21–23
Benefiting from the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, deliberate tailoring of nanomaterials with excellent chemical and physical properties has become possible and has been exploited for application in ESSs. It is well known that electrodes composed of nanoarchitectures could effectively enhance the electrochemical performance in energy storage devices. The electrochemical behavior of a battery-type electrode can be considered as “extrinsic” pseudocapacitive, if the size of electrode materials is lower than a threshold value.17 In nanostructured electrodes, the higher surface area provides more electroactive sites and shortens the diffusion/transport pathway of electrons/ions, leading to high power and energy density, high-rate capability and long cyclic lifespan. Thus, design of nanomaterials is deemed to be an effective strategy for significant breakthroughs in ESSs. A number of studies have been implemented in the synthesis, fabrication, modification, assembly and assessment of the electrochemical performance of electrode materials in a nano/microscale.9,24–28 Moreover, the possible mechanisms of electrochemical reactions and physicochemical properties of electrode materials have been theoretically disclosed by molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT).29–31 We have witnessed the significant predictions of MD and DFT in revealing the intrinsic physicochemical properties of materials (e.g. conductivity),32,33 the electrochemical reaction activity at different crystal faces,34–36 and reaction mechanism at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte.37,38 These studies afford a reasonable guidance and microcosmic insight for future improvements of electrode materials.
So far, the energy density and power density of an EC have been well improved to satisfy the practical requirements in ESSs. The average energy density (E) and power density (P) of an EC can be calculated by the following equations: (2) (3)where C is the capacitance of the device, ΔV is the operating potential window (eliminating the effect of iR drop), and Δt is the discharge time. Due to the highly reversible and fast electrochemical reactions at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte, ECs possess high power densities. However, the reactions occurring at the interface or near the surface of the electrode result in low energy storage efficiency compared with batteries. Based on the electrode configurations, ECs can be divided into two types, i.e. symmetric and asymmetric (hybrid) ECs. In the first case, both electrodes are loaded with the same materials, which are commonly used carbon materials. Asymmetric (hybrid) ECs are assembled with different electrode materials, that is, a capacitive EDL electrode and a pseudocapacitive (battery-type) electrode. It is worth noting that this faradaic electrode can store more charges than carbon materials when assembled to an EC, leading to increased capacitance for devices. Eqn (2) reveals that the energy density of a device could be increased upon increasing its total capacitance (C). Besides, since the overpotential is determined by different electrode materials, the operating voltage window of an asymmetric EC can reach 1.7 V, higher than the theoretical decomposition voltage of water (1.23 V). As the voltage window rises from 1.5 to 1.7 V, the energy density of the devices can be increased by ∼28% while their capacitances are the same in this case. Notwithstanding, it is expected that both the pseudocapacitive (battery-type) and capacitive electrode provide high energy density and power density in an asymmetric (hybrid) EC, the match and balance of charges (Q) and voltage of both electrodes are still hot and difficult issues in ECs.39 Thus, the energy density and power density of ECs still need to be effectively improved and balanced for their large-scale practical applications in ESSs.
In this tutorial review, we focus on the state-of-the-art synthesis and electrochemical performance of Ni compound-based electrode materials. Two classes of Ni-based compounds are systematically summarized, i.e. Ni-based oxides and sulfides. In more detail, they include NiO and its composites, ternary nickel based metal oxides and their composites, nickel sulfides and their composites, and ternary nickel based metal sulfides and their composites. Besides that, Ni-based compounds derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs), which are regarded as one kind of newly emerged porous materials are also discussed. The discussion will be mainly carried out for in-depth understanding of the relationship among nanostructures, chemical composition and electrochemical performance. At the end of this review, the current challenges and future outlook for Ni compound-based materials and their electrochemical behaviors will be addressed.
2 Ni-based oxides for electrode materials
2.1 Nanostructured NiO
Among metal oxides, nickel oxide (NiO) with ultrahigh theoretical capacity (2584 F g−1 within a potential window of 0.5 V, or 1292 C g−1) has attracted tremendous attention in the past few years.40 However, the real wide applications of NiO electrodes are impeded by their poor electric conductivity, leading to unsatisfied electrochemical performance. To date, many strategies, such as the hydrothermal method, solvothermal process, electrochemical deposition, electrospinning technique, microwave-assisted method, and hot-filament metal-oxide vapor deposition (HFMOVD), have been explored in tailoring NiO nanoarchitectures including nanoflowers,41 nanowires,42 nanorods,43 nanoplates,44 nanosheets,45 hollow spheres,46 and thin films.47,48 The detailed information on nanostructured NiO is listed in Table 1. It is well known that the most convenient way to prepare nanostructured NiO is by annealing Ni-based precursors (such as Ni(OH)2 and Ni2(OH)2(CO3)), during which process anions could easily turn into gases under a certain temperature and heating rate. In this regard, the annealing temperature is a key factor in the determination of the crystallinity and wettability of the products. High annealing temperature could lead to re-crystallization of the samples and removal of organic impurities in the samples, while it is detrimental to the hydrophilicity of products in the electrolyte. Furthermore, it is also found that a higher heating rate can result in a fast release of gas from the solid phase in a short time, which could damage the product architectures. This process has been disclosed in some literature studies.49,50 Thus, it is suggested that various nanostructured NiO could be simply prepared by annealing the precursors under an appropriate set temperature and heating rate. The products will preserve the morphology of the precursors and generate abundant pores, simultaneously, resulting in enhancement of the electrochemical performance. The electrochemical redox reaction of the NiO electrode in an alkaline electrolyte can be expressed by the following equation:2,51 NiO + OH− ↔ NiOOH + e−(4)

The typical preparation process of nanostructured NiO is given in Fig. 1a.56 Firstly, a mixed solution containing the Ni source, alkaline reagents and template/surfactant (if needed) was kept under specified reaction conditions (microwave irradiation) for a given time. Following the self-assembly and oriented attached growth, 2D lamellar α-Ni(OH)2 was obtained as shown in Fig. 1b and c. After annealing treatment at 300 °C, α-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were converted into NiO nanosheets (Fig. 1d), which completely retained the morphology and structure of the precursor. The ultrathin NiO nanosheets electrode delivered a high specific capacitance of 2236 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and 1392 F g−1 at 12 A g−1 (Fig. 1e). The NiO electrode also demonstrated excellent cycling stability, wherein no obvious degradation behavior was observed at a current density of 4 A g−1 for 2000 cycles (Fig. 1f).

Wang et al. developed a simple method to prepare nanostructured NiO electrode materials.53 In this approach, Ni-based precursors with different morphologies could be produced by mixing different amounts of reagents (urea, sodium salts and nickel sources) together with water and glycerol. Fig. 2a and b demonstrate that the as-prepared samples were 3D structures constituted of plenty of interlaced nanosheets with increasing glycerol content in the solution, indicating that glycerol played a critical role in the morphology formation procedure of the products. Similarly, the morphology of the obtained product changed from large plates (Fig. 2c) to interconnected 3D structures (Fig. 2d) that were constructed with ultrafine nanofibers obtained by increasing the amount of urea. By optimizing the experimental conditions, the Ni-based nanobelt precursor was synthesized. After the annealing treatment, the NiO nanobelts retained the structure as well as the morphology of the precursor completely as displayed in Fig. 2e and f. The NiO nanobelt electrode delivered a specific capacitance of 1126, 900, 660, 340, and 283.5 F g−1 at different current densities of 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10 A g−1, respectively. For comparison, the electrochemical cycling performance of all the samples was evaluated, which revealed that the NiO nanobelt electrode exhibited the highest capacitance and showed excellent stability among all the prepared NiO nanostructures.

It is well known that NiO is a semiconductor with a band gap of 2.318 eV. Thus, the low conductivity of NiO limits full use of its ultrahigh theoretical capacity, and also causes severe capacity decay at high charge/discharge current densities (see Table 1). To solve this problem, tremendous strategies have been devised, such as reducing the size of NiO, and designing new nanoarchitectures. A number of synthesis methods have been explored to fabricate NiO architectures with large surface areas and specific porous structures. The nanostructured NiO electrodes could provide a large contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, providing more electroactive sites for redox reactions (refer to eqn (4)). Proper porous distribution in NiO electrodes allows the permeation and timely flow of electrolyte, and ensures replenishment of sufficient hydroxyl ions expended by the redox reactions.
2.2 Nanostructured NiO based composites
As mentioned above, the electrochemical performance of NiO electrodes could be effectively improved by reducing the dimension size or designing particular nanoarchitectures. However, in most cases, the rate capability and cycling stability of NiO electrodes are still low, which decay fast at high current densities or after certain cycle numbers. The reason is associated with the low electric conductivity of NiO, and the collapse or aggregation of metastable nanostructures during the cycling process. It is well known that metal compounds combined with carbonaceous materials or ordered matrixes could greatly enhance their electrochemical performance. In some literature studies, it is proposed that nickel oxides grown on a matrix shorten the transport/diffusion pathway of electrons/ions, leading to excellent electrochemical performance.57,58 Concerning the matrix material, graphene is proposed as one of the most suitable candidates for application in ESSs, due to its superior electric conductivity, large surface area, mechanical flexibility and high chemical stability.59–61 The attached functional groups, such as epoxy groups (C–O) and carbonyl groups (CO), on graphene can bind metal oxides on its surface.62,63 Moreover, graphene could effectively address the internal forces generated and prevent the aggregation of the nanoparticles during the repeated charge/discharge processes. In turn, the integration of metal oxide particles with graphene also relieves the restacked graphene layers and takes full advantage of their large surface area.
Using a simple chemical reaction approach, Zhao et al. grew a Ni-based precursor on graphene oxide (GO), which was then subjected to an annealing treatment in air.64 After that, the final product graphene/NiO was obtained. The functional groups (C–O and CO) on GO allowed the anchored Ni2+ to react with OH− or CO32−, forming a precipitate via mutual electrostatic attraction at an appropriate pH value, i.e. chemical environment. On the other side, the formed precursor also prevented the restacking of GO layers by van der Waals forces. The morphology of the prepared graphene/NiO is shown in Fig. 3a and b. The graphene/NiO electrode exhibited outstanding cycling stability. A specific capacitance of ∼525 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, which was much higher than that of pure NiO (307 F g−1). Similarly, Zhu et al. prepared an RG-O/NiO precursor by a homogeneous coprecipitation method, which was then reduced with hydrazine by refluxing in the subsequent process.65 The RG-O/NiO composite was obtained by annealing the precursor in air, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The RG-O/NiO delivered a high specific capacitance of about 700 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Jiang et al. synthesized graphene/NiO composites through a hydrothermal method and a subsequent annealing treatment in air.66 The SEM and TEM images are provided in Fig. 3e and f, revealing that the NiO nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the surface of graphene sheets. In this case, the calculated specific capacitance of the graphene/NiO was 429.7 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1, whereas it was about 125.3 F g−1 for the pure NiO.

Besides graphene, many other materials were also tested as holders to support nickel oxides for electrochemical applications. Feng et al. synthesized Ni(OH)2 nanowires (Fig. 4a) by a simple hydrothermal method, following which they were coated with an organic carbon shell outside by a re-hydrothermal reaction in a glucose solution.67 After annealing in argon, the Ni(OH)2 nanowires coated with the glucose shell were transformed into NiO nanoparticles encapsulated with a carbon shell as displayed in Fig. 4b and c. This peapod-like NiO/C delivered an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2048 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and showed excellent rate performance (1573 F g−1 at 40 A g−1). Outstanding cycling stability was also achieved with capacitance retention of ∼97% relative to the initial value for 8000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance might be ascribed to the porous and novel peapod like NiO/C structure that made full use of the electroactive sites of NiO nanoparticles, allowed fast ion diffusion, facilitated the transportation of electrons through the carbon shell, and also prevented the aggregation of NiO nanoparticles in the cycling process. Let us consider some cases as examples. Lin et al. grew a Ni-based precursor on carbon fibers, which was then annealed in an argon atmosphere to form a C@NiO core–shell structure as shown in Fig. 4d–f.68 The hierarchical C@NiO exhibited a high specific capacitance of 891.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and high rate performance, i.e. 742.2 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 (with 83.3% capacitance retention), which was much higher than that of the pure NiO shell. Similarly, Fan et al. employed carbon spheres (Fig. 4g) as templates for decorating the Ni(OH)2 shell (Fig. 4h) by a hydrothermal method.69 Interestingly, carbon nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow NiO spheres were obtained after further heat treatment in argon as depicted in Fig. 4i, revealing a high specific capacitance of 988.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and outstanding cycling stability. Using a two-step growth method, Dam et al. firstly grew indium-tin oxide nanowires (ITO NWs, Fig. 4j) on titanium foil in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system, following which electrodeposition was adopted for preparation of nickel hydroxide on the nanowires by utilization of lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) as templates.70 After annealing in air, hierarchical NiO nanoflakes (NFs) on the ITO NW nanostructure were finally fabricated. Such a kind of one-dimensional nanowire arrays not only provided a fast electron transport pathway but also acted as a stable skeleton for the growth of NiO NFs. In Fig. 4k and l, the high magnification TEM images disclose the morphology and nanostructure of the as-deposited NiO NFs on ITO NWs (NiO/ITO NWs). The NiO/ITO NWs gave higher specific capacitance than pure NiO on titanium foil at high current densities, exhibiting excellent rate performance.

For electrochemical measurement of powder materials, binders and conductive materials (usually acetylene black) are basically involved, due to which an inevitable contact resistance between the current collector and the electroactive materials will be formed. Besides the low conductivity of nickel oxides, the introduced contact resistance will further disrupt the electrochemical performance. Thus, an in situ growth technique is proposed to synthesize the nickel oxides on different conductive substrates, such as commonly used carbon cloth, carbon nanotubes, graphene nanosheets, and Ni foam. Since some of the NiO based composites can be directly utilized as electrodes without an additional binder or acetylene black, higher capacitance values were achieved. The specific composite structures not only facilitate the fast electron transport between the active material and collector, but also act as the backbone for the growth of nanostructured nickel oxides to gain high surface area.
2.3 Ternary and quaternary Ni-based metal oxides
Synthesis of composites of carbon matrix and NiO through chemical and/or physical methods is a simple as well as effective way to enhance the electrochemical performance of nickel oxides for ESSs. Nonetheless, it is found that the composites are generally handicapped by the intrinsic low conductivity of NiO and limited by the single valence variation of NiO during the redox reaction. Additionally, the complex synthesis procedures further impede their practical applications. To address these issues, nanostructured ternary or quaternary Ni-based oxides are synthesized, because ternary or quaternary metal oxides are proposed to possess advantages of metallic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and richer redox reaction compared with monometallic oxides.71,72 To date, tremendous effort has been paid to the design and synthesis of different nanostructured ternary Ni-based metal oxides, the electrochemical performance of which is listed in Table 2. Based on the molecular formula, the ternary Ni-based metal oxides can be divided into three types, i.e. NiA2O4 (A = Co, Fe, Mn, etc.), NiMO4 (M = Mo, W, etc.), and Ni3Q2O8 (Q = V, etc.).73,74 Note that metal A (in NiA2O4) will participate in the electrochemical reaction, whereas M (in NiMO4) and Q (in Ni3Q2O8) mainly contribute to the improvement of the electric conductivity of the oxides and do not involve in the redox reactions.75 The common redox reaction can be described by the following equations:73 NiA2O4 + OH− + H2O ↔ NiOOH + 2AOOH + e−(5)

In our previous work, we proposed a facile and scalable way for the preparation of a porous NiCo2O4 flowerlike nanostructure via a one-step hydrothermal method and a subsequent annealing process in air,71 the morphology of which is depicted in Fig. 5a and b. The flowerlike NiCo2O4 electrode exhibited much higher specific capacitance than NiO and Co3O4 at the same current density (Fig. 5c) and excellent cyclic stability. Moreover, 78% specific capacitance retention for 20-times current density increase from 1 to 20 A g−1 demonstrated the superior rate performance of the porous NiCo2O4 electrode. Yuan et al. employed an effective template-assisted strategy to synthesize hollow NiCo2O4 sub-microspheres by refluxing.88 As shown in Fig. 5d and e, the surface of the NiCo2O4 sub-microspheres was rather rough, which seemed to consist of many folds. Since more electroactive sites could be possibly created during the electrochemical redox reaction, the NiCo2O4 sub-microspheres electrode delivered a specific capacitance of 678 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 79.6% at a current density ranging from 1 to 10 A g−1 (Fig. 5f). Ma et al. reported a one-step solvothermal method to synthesize the Ni–Co based precursor of hierarchical tetragonal microtubes, which was then annealed in air to form their oxide counterparts with the same morphology as well as structure.89 Time-dependent observation disclosed that thermodynamically metastable microprisms were formed at the very beginning, acting as templates for self-assembling Ni–Co layered double hydroxides as shown in Fig. 5g. As the reaction continued, hierarchical microtubes consisting of nanosheets were observed due to dissolution of the solid microprisms. The NiCo2O4 microtubes exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1387.9 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 (Fig. 5h) with outstanding cycling stability, indicating that the hierarchical microstructure possessed a short ion diffusion length and abundant electroactive sites for redox reactions. Utilizing a general hydrothermal method with some additional surfactants, Wang et al. achieved growth of a NixCo3−xO4 nanowire precursor on Ni foam.90 The growth mechanism of the precursor was systematically investigated in the time-dependent experiment, revealing that the dodecyl sulfate resulted in the crystallization–dissolution–recrystallization process. The NixCo3−xO4 nanowires obtained by annealing treatment showed a specific capacitance of 1479 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 with stable cycling performance.

In many of the published studies, Ni foam was frequently utilized as a substrate to grow Ni-based precursors under a violent reaction environment with some soluble nickel sources added. To calculate the specific capacitance of the electrodes, the mass variation of Ni foam before and after the synthesis was weighed for confirming the mass of the as-prepared electroactive material. Nonetheless, it is necessary to point out that the Ni foam will be partially corroded by some oxidants contained in the solution under high temperature and pressure, leading to mass loss of the substrates.91,92 As a result, the specific capacitance (F g−1) of Ni compound-based materials on Ni foam generally possesses higher values compared with the actual ones. To solve this problem, we propose to use the unit of areal or volumetric capacitance (capacity) rather than specific capacitance (capacity) in evaluating the electrochemical performance of the Ni compound-based electrode materials in situ grown on Ni foam.
Besides NiCo2O4 electrodes, other ternary metal oxides were also synthesized for supercapacitor applications. In our group, NiMoO4 nanoclusters (shown in Fig. 6a and b) were rapidly synthesized in several minutes by a novel microwave assisted synthesis method for the first time.93 A specific capacitance of 682 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and acceptable cyclic stability were achieved. To further improve the electrochemical performance of ternary metal oxides, a simple hydrothermal method was also developed, by which quaternary metal oxides (NixCo1−xMoO4) with different addition ratios of Ni and Co were grown.20 It was found that the electrochemical activity of Ni–Co molybdates could be tuned by balancing the content of Ni and Co in NixCo1−xMoO4. It was demonstrated that the rod-like Ni0.67Co0.33MoO4 (Fig. 6c and d) achieved the highest specific capacity of 441 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 with capacity retention of 71% in the current range of 1 to 50 A g−1, which also showed superior cycling stability. The overall outstanding performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of Ni and Co ions in the alkaline electrolyte. Using a facile and environmentally friendly strategy (the detailed procedures of which are presented in Fig. 6e), Wu et al. obtained hierarchical mesoporous Zn–Ni–Co quaternary oxide (ZNCO) nanowire arrays on Ni foam as shown in Fig. 6f. The morphology of ZNCO nanowires was quite similar to a reported spinel Co3O4.94 The calculated areal capacitance values of ZNCO nanowire electrodes were 4.2, 4.0, 3.9, 3.8, and 3.7 F m−2 at 1.7, 3.3, 5.0, 6.7, and 8.3 mA cm−2, respectively.

To improve the electrochemical performance of nickel oxides, one of the most effective ways is to adjust their electronic structure by introducing other transition metal atoms. Both theoretical calculation and experimental results verify that NiCo2O4 is a metallic conductor.95,96 This is because, the introduced Co3+ adjusts the band gap of the Ni-based oxides, and enhances the electric conductivity of the compounds. Thus, it is evidenced why ternary Ni-based metal oxides usually deliver higher specific capacity values than monometallic oxides. Similarly, Mo6+, W6+, V5+ or other ions in ternary Ni-based oxides can be regarded as a modifier of electron structures in the improvement of the conductivity of the compounds. Besides the conductivity, some metal ions, such as Co3+, will also react with OH− in the electrolyte and contribute to the total capacity, the mechanism of which is shown in eqn (5). The above mentioned double effects make NiCo2O4 compounds achieve excellent electrochemical performance.
2.4 Combination of ternary Ni-based metal oxides with other materials
As mentioned above, combination of metal oxides with carbonaceous materials can effectively prevent the restacking or aggregation of individual components, achieving large surface area, providing more electrochemical active sites, and yielding outstanding electrochemical performance. In particular, highly ordered 3D structures facilitate the effective penetration and diffusion of electrolyte and a shorter ion/electron diffusion/transport pathway, leading to excellent cycling stability. Concerning these issues, a number of ternary metal oxide nanoarchitectures have been designed on different carbonaceous materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, either by environmentally friendly approaches or scalable ways.97
Yu et al. reported an approach to grow mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays on graphene–nickel foam (GNF, shown in Fig. 7b) by a two-step method.98 The procedures are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7a. In detail, multi-layer graphene nanosheets (Fig. 7c) were grown on acid-treated nickel foam in a chemical vapor deposition system firstly. Then, the NiCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays (Fig. 7d) were prepared on GNF through a hydrothermal method. The hierarchical NiCo2O4/GNF delivered a specific capacitance of 1588 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which was much higher than that of NiCo2O4 on nickel foam. Similarly, Guo et al. synthesized NiMoO4 nanowires (NWs) on carbon cloth.99 The formation process is depicted in Fig. 7e, which is suggested as a general synthesis approach for preparation of metal oxides on different substrates. The processes included pretreatment of the substrates, i.e. elimination of impurity or oxides, synthesis of metal compound precursors, and annealing treatment of the hierarchical precursors to form the oxide counterparts. The NiMoO4 NWs on a carbon cloth (Fig. 7f) flexible electrode yielded an areal (specific) capacitance of 1.27 F cm−2 (1587 F g−1) at 5 mA cm−2 (6.25 A g−1). To further evaluate the capacitive performance, a symmetric supercapacitor composed of NiMoO4 NWs on carbon cloth that was used as both cathode and anode was set up as shown in Fig. 7g. A cell voltage of 1.7 V and a high energy density of 70.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1000 W kg−1 were achieved when testing in an aqueous electrolyte. Interestingly, Xiong et al. developed a cheap and environmentally friendly biocarbon substrate from mollusc shells by acid treatment and it was further carbonized, making it a promising scaffold for preparing NiCo2O4 nanowires.100 The detailed preparation process is revealed in Fig. 7h. Fig. 7i shows the morphology of the mollusc shell based macroporous carbon material (MSBPC), possessing a relatively uniform pore size. As shown in Fig. 7j, NiCo2O4 nanowires grew vertically on the MSBPC, which formed aligned nanowire arrays. The NiCo2O4 on the MSBPC delivered a high specific capacitance of 1696 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with good rate performance and outstanding cycling stability. Thus, combining the nanostructured carbon materials derived from natural organisms with transition metal oxides demonstrates to be a promising as well as smart strategy towards high performance energy storage devices.

In addition to ternary Ni-based metal oxides, the use of hierarchical nanostructures with two or more transition metal compounds hybridized is also considered to be a promising route to improve the electrochemical performance. The recent years have witnessed the fabrication of sophisticated core–shell hierarchical structured arrays with two types of transition metal oxides for superior electrochemical performance. Yu et al. reported synthesis of a NiCo2O4@MnO2 core–shell heterostructure on Ni foam via a two-step hydrothermal method followed by an annealing treatment.101 In this core–shell heterostructure, the mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays served as a core, while the MnO2 nanoflakes acted as a shell. The binder-free NiCo2O4@MnO2 core–shell nanowire arrays exhibited an areal capacitance of 3.31 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2, which was much higher than that of bare NiCo2O4 nanowires (2.01 cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2). Likewise, Xu et al. also synthesized a similar NiCo2O4@MnO2 core–shell heterostructure for supercapacitor application, yielding an areal capacitance of 2.244 cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2.102 Cui et al. reported another heterostructured NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 nanocolumn array on Ni foam, in which NiCo2O4 nanocolumn arrays acted as the core, while MnMoO4 nanosheets served as the shell.103 The NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 delivered a specific capacitance of 1.91 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 with excellent cycling stability. Moreover, Kong and his co-workers prepared PPy nanospheres on self-supported NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays (NWAs), which looked like a bunch of ice-sugar gourds.104 The hierarchical NiCo2O4@PPy NWA electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 2244.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, showing well-maintained cycling stability.
Smart design of novel binder-free heterostructured electrodes that consist of two kinds of transition metal oxides results in enhanced electrochemical performance. The reasons could be as follows. (1) Both types of transition metal oxides show excellent electrochemical behaviors in aqueous electrolytes, yielding a synergistic effect. (2) The ternary metal oxide nanowire arrays grown on conductive substrates/skeletons shorten the electron transport pathway between the electrode and the reliable networks during the repeated cycling processes. (3) The obtained core–shell heterostructures are highly mesoporous, leading to a large surface area, providing more electrochemical active sites and allowing easier electrolyte penetration and diffusion into the inner electrode.
2.5 Ni-based oxides as cathode materials for asymmetric EC applications
Limited by the electronic structure and redox potential of Ni-based oxides, few contributions have been devoted to the capacity at a negative potential window in alkaline aqueous electrolytes. Thus, Ni-based oxides are widely used as a cathode material for configuration of ECs, together with anodes made of carbon materials, such as active carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. In comparison with traditional symmetric ECs that are assembled by carbon materials as both electrodes, the energy density of asymmetric ECs fabricated by Ni-based oxides is found to be increased many times under the same power density. The device performance of Ni-based oxides is listed in Table 3.

It should be pointed out that a number of recent studies have aimed at the enhancement of the energy density of ECs by using different electrode materials and electrolytes. However, there is no standard approach for the evaluation and calculation of energy density. In most papers, the mass of active materials (without collectors, electrolyte and separator) was utilized to assess the performance of a whole device. In particular, the choice of area or volume (active materials, electrodes, or whole device) has an obvious difference in the calculation of areal or volumetric energy density. Therefore, it is proposed to calculate the energy density and power density of an EC based on the mass/area/volume of the whole device to avoid overestimating the performance of the device. There are also many excellent reviews discussing about the optimization of ECs.3,105–108 Unless otherwise specified, the mass used to account for the energy and power density of the device in the following papers is only the mass of active materials on both electrodes instead of the whole device. According to the charge storage mechanisms, a device that is assembled by pseudocapacitive and capacitive electrodes should be termed as an asymmetric EC, while a device that is configured by battery-type and capacitive electrodes should be termed as a hybrid EC. For convenience, “asymmetric EC” will be used to address a device fabricated by using Ni-based compounds as cathode materials in this review.
As shown in Table 3, the device assembled by using Ni-based oxides (including ternary Ni-based oxides) as the cathode material delivers an energy density ranging from about 20 to 40 kW kg−1 at a low power density. Though the energy densities of these asymmetric ECs are still lower than those of commercial lithium ion batteries (>100 kW kg−1), they possess higher energy density than the traditional symmetric EDL capacitors (<10 kW kg−1) as compared in many previous studies. Thus, the pseudocapacitive (battery-type) electrode materials that substituted carbon materials in the fabrication of ECs will facilitate much more charge storage owing to faradaic reactions, resulting in enhancement of energy densities of the devices. For cathode materials, the ECs of ternary Ni-based oxides show a little higher energy density than monometallic nickel oxides, which can be roughly attributed to the higher capacity of ternary Ni-based oxides compared to nickel oxides. Nevertheless, nickel oxides still suffer from the intrinsic drawback of poor conductivity, leading to low rate capabilities and power density.
3 Ni-based sulfides for electrode materials
3.1 Nanostructured nickel sulfides
Due to the low electronegativity of sulfur compared with oxygen, sulfur couples more favorably with nickel to form different phases of nickel sulfides, such as α-NiS, β-NiS, NiS2, Ni3S2, α-Ni3+xS2, Ni4S3+x, Ni6S5, Ni7S6, Ni9S8 and Ni3S4.117 Different from nickel oxides, nearly all nickel sulfides possess metallic conductivity, facilitating fast electron transport in the inner region of the materials.96 Various strategies to synthesize different nanostructured nickel sulfides have been reported, such as hollow spheres,118,119 nanosheet frames,120 nanowire arrays,121 nanochains,122 layer-rolled structures,123 nanopyramids,124 and thin films.125 A number of papers demonstrate that nickel sulfides could well serve as potential energy storage electrodes, details of which are provided in Table 4.

The redox reactions of NiSx (x = 1, 2) and Ni3S2 in alkaline electrolytes are generally given as follows:117,137,138 NiSx + OH− ↔ NiSxOH + e−(6) Ni3S2 + 3OH− ↔ Ni3S2(OH)3 + 3e−(7)
However, the poor cycling performance of nickel sulfide electrodes is also frequently observed in many papers, the reason for which could be the following irreversible reactions:126,139 NiS + H2O + ½O2 → Ni(OH)2 + S(8) Ni(OH)2 + OH− ↔ NiOOH + H2O + e−(9)
The electrochemical behavior of nickel sulfides is verified to be a semi-infinite diffusion-limited reaction process.126,134,140 As mentioned in eqn (1), the linear relationship of ip (current peak) vs. v1/2 (square root of scan rate) indicates that the electrode materials involving typical diffusion-limited redox reactions should be a battery-type one. Thus, the nickel sulfides suffer from low rate performance and poor cycling stability, which dramatically hinder their wide applications.
By controlling hydrothermal conditions, Wei et al. successfully synthesized α-NiS and β-NiS hollow spheres as shown in Fig. 8a and b.141 The polycrystalline α-NiS electrode delivered a slightly higher specific capacitance of 562.3 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 than monocrystalline β-NiS (501.5 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1). Interestingly, it was found that prolonged hydrothermal reaction can lead to the conversion of α-NiS to β-NiS. Our group developed a rapid route to synthesize α-NiS nanoparticles (Fig. 8c) via a microwave-assisted method, which only needed fifteen minutes.142 The calculated specific capacitance values of the α-NiS electrode were 845 F g−1 and 375 F g−1 at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. To probe quasireversible redox reaction processes at the interface of materials and electrolytes, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were implemented to disclose how the electrolyte ions interact with NiS nanoparticles (Fig. 8d). Besides α-NiS nanoparticles, our group also proposed a facile wet chemical method for the preparation of NiS2 nanorods as shown in Fig. 8e, involving self-assembled and Ostwald ripening processes.140 Different annealing conditions such as the heating rate, sintering temperature, and time for heat preservation were systematically studied. The porous NiS2 rod-like (Fig. 8f) electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 1020.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, showing excellent cycling stability.

Different from nickel oxides, nickel sulfides show a metallic nature, allowing fast charge transfer from the surface redox reaction to the current collector. The electrically conductive nickel sulfide electrodes take full advantage of the energy generated during the fast faradaic reaction process, resulting in delivering higher specific capacity values than nickel oxide electrodes. Among the nickel sulfides, the capacity will change according to the stoichiometry of nickel and sulfur. However, it is hard to explain why different phased nickel sulfides can result in different electrochemical performances. To the best of our knowledge, synthesis of nickel sulfides with the same morphology, while being with different stoichiometries, has never been reported. Each phase of nickel sulfide has its own specific crystal face for the preferential growth orientation. If the capacity contribution coming from the morphology and/or surface area of electrode materials could not be discerned, it would be difficult to conclude which phase of nickel sulfide shows the best electrochemical performance. Although metallic nickel sulfides deliver high capacity values, the energy storage mechanisms of the different phased nickel sulfides are still not very well understood
3.2 Nanostructured nickel sulfide composites
Nickel sulfides exhibit high specific capacitance values owing to their metallic conductivity. However, either rate performance or cycling performance remains unsatisfactory. Coupling metal compounds with carbonaceous materials or matrixes could remarkably improve the electrochemical performance of the electrodes, as discussed above. The substrates not only offer the skeleton for growth of nickel sulfides, but also provide more electroactive sites for shortening the diffusion length of electrolyte ions. Until now, many strategies for the preparation of nanostructured nickel sulfide composites have been proposed, and some of the typical cases are summarized in Table 5.

Lin et al. prepared a flower-like Ni3S2-embedded graphene (rGO–Ni3S2) aerogel through an F127-assisted hydrothermal method and subsequent high-temperature pyrolysis.160 The complete synthesis process is illustrated in Fig. 9a, which is a general hydrothermal method for growth of nickel sulfide nanoparticles on graphene nanosheets. Since GO was synthesized by a modified Hummer's method, the oxygen-containing groups on the surface of graphene oxides could easily interact with nickel ions, serving as the active sites to grow nickel based precursors or sulfides. It is noteworthy that the high-temperature annealing treatment was necessary for the formation of nickel sulfides due to the presence of impurities or organic polymers in the hydrothermal procedure. Moreover, the content of carbon in the composites played a key role in the electrochemical performance of the products. Fig. 9b shows the specific capacitance of rGO–Ni3S2 with different contents of carbon and pure Ni3S2 at different current densities. rGO–Ni3S2 (1:5) exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1329.2 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 1050 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 compared with all the other samples. The morphology of rGO–Ni3S2 (1:5) was recorded and is shown in Fig. 9c, verifying that Ni3S2 nanoparticles were densely grown on the rGO surface and well separated by the graphene sheets. Besides carbonaceous substrates, numerous metal compound matrixes were explored to grow nickel sulfides. Wang et al. reported a simple one-step hydrothermal method to grow hierarchical Ni3S2 nanorods@MoS2 nanosheet core–shell arrays on Ni foam.161 They found that the concentration of the sulfide source (thioacetamide, TAA) determined the formation of the MoS2 nanosheets, the details of which are provided in Fig. 9d. Fig. 9e reveals a typical SEM image of Ni3S2@MoS2 arrays (1.5 g L−1 of TAA), delivering a specific capacitance of 848 F g−1 at 5 A g−1. Kong et al. successfully fabricated novel hierarchical Co3O4@C@Ni3S2 sandwich-structured nanoneedle arrays (NNAs) on Ni foam via a two-step hydrothermal method.162 The detailed synthesis procedures of NNAs are demonstrated in Fig. 9f, which contained the following four steps: (i) hydrothermal synthesis of the Co3O4 precursor of nanoneedle arrays on Ni foam; (ii) formation of Co3O4 arrays by annealing; (iii) immersing the as-prepared substrate into glucose solution, which was further subjected to annealing in an Ar atmosphere; (iv) growth of Ni3S2 on Co3O4@C to form the final product Co3O4@C@Ni3S2. The morphology of Co3O4@C@Ni3S2 NNAs is disclosed in Fig. 9g. The hierarchical structure of mesoporous Co3O4 nanorods (core), the amorphous carbon layer (shell), and hexagonal-like ultrathin Ni3S2 nanoflakes (shell) are pointed out and highlighted in Fig. 9h. The Co3O4@C@Ni3S2 NNA electrode yielded an areal capacitance of 3.564 F cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, and showed good cycling stability at different operating temperatures.

The cycling stability and rate capability of nickel sulfides could be further improved by smart engineering of the nanoarchitectures. However, the smaller sized structure exposes higher electroactive area, resulting in instability of the structure during repeated charge–discharge processes. As mentioned above, the configuration of nanostructured nickel sulfides together with carbon materials or in situ growth on other substrates was proposed as an effective approach to circumvent the disadvantage of nanocrystallization of the materials. The substrates/matrixes that serve as skeletons help anchor these nanostructured nickel sulfides and prevent their aggregation during the robust redox reactions. Moreover, the conductive skeletons facilitate fast electron transport between the electroactive sites and current collector (discussed in Section 2.2). The hierarchical structure, i.e. nickel sulfides grown in situ on other metal compounds (such as Co3O4 and MoS2), shows a higher capacity value than the individual component. The enhanced electrochemical performance may be attributed to the fact that other metal ions also participate in electrochemical reactions at the corresponding potential window, the mechanism of which is similar to that of ternary Ni-based oxides as discussed above. This synergistic effect takes full advantage of the potential window, improving the rate performance of nickel sulfide composites.
3.3 Ternary Ni-based transition metal sulfides
In ternary metal oxides, the second transition metal involved enriches the species of electrochemical redox reactions for achieving higher capacity and rate performance. Replacing oxygen with sulfur that has lower electronegativity in a compound creates a more flexible architecture, which effectively alleviates the disintegration of the nanoarchitecture and increases the conductivity of the composites. Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of ternary metal sulfides for electrochemical energy storage as listed in Table 6. As a significant branch of ternary metal sulfides, NixCo3−xS4 (0 < x < 3) has been verified to exhibit metallic conductivity, leading to remarkable performance in many fields.96,163 The electrochemical behavior of NixCo3−xS4 involves several redox processes of Co2+/Co3+/Co4+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couples, resulting in broad and multiple redox peaks as follows: CoS + OH− ↔ CoSOH + e−(10) CoSOH + OH− ↔ CoSO + H2O + e−(11) NiS + OH− ↔ NiSOH + e−(12)

As demonstrated in Table 6, the most common way to synthesize nickel–cobalt sulfides is a two-step hydrothermal (or solvothermal) method. Nanostructured Ni-based precursors are first prepared by a hydrothermal process, which is more or less same as the synthesis procedure of Ni-based oxide precursors. Owing to the diversity of reagents, surfactants, and solvents, ternary Ni-based precursors with different morphologies and structures can be obtained by tuning the experimental parameters. Then the precursors reacted with a sulfur source, such as sodium sulfide, thioacetamide, or thiourea, and were transformed into their sulfide counterparts in a second hydrothermal process. During the second hydrothermal process, i.e. sulfidation process, an irreversible mutual diffusion process of two or more kinds of ions occurs at the interface of the solvent and solid precursors, generating a vacancy to balance the unequal diffusion rate of the ions in the solid precursors. The driving force of the diffusion process originates from ion concentration gradients between the interface of solvent and solid precursors. As the reactions progress, vacancies gather together gradually to form cavities and finally evolve into a hollow structure. This evolution mechanism is termed as the Kirkendall effect.177
Recently, our group proposed a two-step hydrothermal method to synthesize NiCo2S4 urchin-like nanostructures, the morphology of which could be seen in Fig. 10a.178 This urchin-like NiCo2S4 exhibited metallic conductivity, which was proposed as a promising candidate for electrochemical energy storage. High specific capacitances of 1149 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 761 F g−1 at 50 A g−1 were achieved as shown in Fig. 10b. Thereafter, we also investigated the effect of the ratio of Ni to Co in the ternary Ni–Co sulfides on the morphology and electrochemical performance of the products.179 Owing to the mesoporous structure, high surface area, rich redox species, and low charge-transfer resistance, the Ni1.5Co1.5S4 nanoparticles electrode exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1093 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retained 108% of the initial specific capacitance after 2000 charge–discharge cycles. Besides Ni–Co sulfides, nickel based manganese sulfides were also investigated for electrochemical energy storage by our group for the first time.180 In a time-dependent experiment, it was found that the formation of a hedgehog-like hollow Ni–Mn precursor strongly relied on the manganese ion (Mn2+) (shown in Fig. 10c). The hollow Ni–Mn sulfide spheres delivered a higher specific capacitance than Ni–Mn oxides (Fig. 10d), as well as displayed outstanding cyclic stability.

Taking advantage of the Kirkendall effect, Shen et al. synthesized NiCo2S4 ball-in-ball hollow spheres by a two-step solvothermal process.94 The detailed process could be divided into three stages, as displayed in Fig. 11a. In the beginning, sulfide ions (S2−) spread to the surface of NiCo-glycerate solid spheres (Fig. 11b), reacting with metal ions to form a NiCo2S4 shell (Fig. 11c). In stage II, fast outward diffused metal ions reacted with inward diffused S2− to generate a gap between the NiCo2S4 shell and NiCo-precursor core (Fig. 11d), which hindered the diffusion rate of the metal ions. As a result, a secondary NiCo2S4 hollow sphere was formed in the bigger NiCo2S4 shell as shown in Fig. 11e. Thus, this evolution process was closely related to the diffusion rate of the ions. Besides the ball-in-ball structure, the authors also synthesized the single shell NiCo2S4 hollow structure at a higher temperature, where the diffusion rates of metal ions and S2− were fast enough to across the gap between the NiCo2S4 shell and NiCo-precursor core. The NiCo2S4 ball-in-ball hollow spheres electrode showed a specific capacitance of 1036 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability.

Different from the various phases of nickel sulfides and ternary Ni-based oxides, NixCo3−xS4 (0 < x < 3) is the most common compound of ternary Ni-based sulfides. Few papers have reported about ECs based on other ternary Ni-based sulfide composites, which are composed of transition metal elements other than cobalt. The reason may be that the lower electronegativity of sulfur (compared to that of oxygen) weakens the bonding strength between the atoms, leading to the dissolution of other metal ions during the sulfidation process. Nonetheless, the situation will be different in NixCo3−xS4. The nickel and cobalt ions favor the generation of spinel ternary Ni–Co sulfides due to their similar ionic properties. Therefore, a more flexible structure of Ni–Co sulfides will be formed compared to that of oxides, suggesting the ability to buffer the structural deformation during the repeated redox reactions, which results in good cycling stability. Besides that, different sized pores will be developed in the prepared Ni–Co sulfides that are synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method owing to the Kirkendall effect. The macropores in the electrode materials acted as a reservoir of the electrolyte and facilitated fast replenishment of the expended OH− through faradaic reactions. Furthermore, the mesopores provide both a free transport pathway of electrolyte ions and more contact surface area, i.e. electroactive sites, yielding excellent rate performance. Until now, the role of nanopores in pseudocapacitive (battery-type) materials is still unclear. But the nanopores in EDL materials have been verified in playing a key role in rapidly increasing the EDL capacitance over a critical size.181 Thus, it can be concluded that the special crystal structure and abundant porosity of Ni–Co sulfides could lead to outstanding cycling stability, and high rate capacity.
3.4 Combination of ternary Ni-based transition metal sulfides with carbon materials
To further increase the electroactive surface area, enhance the electric conductivity, and improve the mechanical flexibility of ternary Ni-based metal sulfides (TNMS), much effort has been devoted to designing smart 3D architecture by combining TNMS with flexible carbon structures. Some representational examples of novel TNMS composites are given in Table 7.

As a representative example, our group fabricated novel 3D hierarchical NiCo2S4 nanotubes@Ni–Mn layered double hydroxide (LDH) core–shell arrays on graphene sponge (GS).203 The synthesis process is depicted in Fig. 12a. The GS skeletons were prepared from a graphene oxide dispersion solution by a simple freeze-drying technique. The SEM image, optical image and width of the GS were demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 12a, which showed interconnected porous networks. Then a typical two-step hydrothermal method mentioned above was employed to in situ grow NiCo2S4 nanotubes on graphene sponge. Finally, the Ni–Mn LDH nanosheets were coated on the surface of NiCo2S4 nanotubes by a third-time implemented hydrothermal method as shown in Fig. 12b. The NiCo2S4@Ni–Mn LDH on the GS electrode delivered a high areal capacitance of 1.74 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and 1.13 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2, which were much higher than that of Ni–Mn LDH/GS and NiCo2S4/GS electrodes tested at the same current densities. The excellent rate performance and cycling stability could be attributed to the hierarchical porous networks and rich redox species of the NiCo2S4@Ni–Mn LDH heterostructure.

The elaborate nanoarchitectures of ternary Ni-based metal sulfide (TNMS) composites on different substrates show outstanding electrochemical performance with extremely high delivered capacity. A comprehensive consideration of all the factors has been discussed above. We propose that the superior electrochemical performance of TNMS composites could be attributed to the following reasons. (1) The electroactive and metallic conductive TNMS facilitate the reversible redox reaction of metal and electrolyte ions, and accelerate electron transport to the current collector, resulting in high delivered specific capacity. (2) The abundant mesopores in TNMS promote the diffusion of electrolyte ions in electrode materials as well as offer much more electroactive sites for redox reactions, leading to outstanding rate performance. (3) The flexible and conductive substrates that acted as backbones for the growth of TNMS could effectively alleviate the deformation of electrode during the robust repeated redox reactions, and decrease the charge transfer resistance between the electroactive materials and external circuit, achieving reliable cycling stability.
3.5 Ni-based sulfides as cathode materials for asymmetric EC applications
As mentioned above, Ni-based sulfides exhibit metallic conductivity, suggesting that ECs assembled by using Ni-based sulfides as cathode materials will ensure a higher power output than their oxides. Meanwhile, rational design of specific architectures and miniaturization of ECs have attracted much more attention in recent studies.204 For instance, Kurra et al. achieved an interdigital micro-supercapacitor for on-chip energy storage, which was fabricated by electrochemical co-deposition of Ni–Co sulfide on the rGO/Au/patterned photoresist and then a subsequent step of photoresist lift-off.205 This CoNi2S4 micro-supercapacitor was tested in a 2-electrode configuration in 1 M KOH electrolyte, delivering a maximum energy density of 18.7 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 1163 mW cm−3 and a voltage window of 0.8 V. Besides that, Cai et al. reported a wearable asymmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor (AFSC) by coating NiCo2S4 nanoparticles on graphene fibers (GF).206 The AFSC was assembled by using GF/NiCo2S4 as the cathode, GF as the anode, and PVA–KOH gel as both the solid electrolyte and separator. The AFSC with a cell voltage of 1.5 V showed a maximum energy density of 12.3 mW h cm−3 and a maximum power density of 1.6 W cm−3 (normalized to the active materials including two fibers). Interestingly, no capacitance decrease was observed when tested under different bending angles, and also presented impressive waterproof characteristic when tested in water. Though wearable and microdevices have got involved in people's daily life, the fabrication and design of these ECs are still complex and immature. Some cases of asymmetric ECs fabricated by using Ni-based sulfides and carbon materials as cathodes and anodes, respectively, are summarized in Table 8.

Compared with Ni-based oxide ECs (see Table 3), Ni-based sulfide ECs show a slightly higher energy density than that of Ni-based oxide ECs, the reason for which was roughly ascribed to the high capacity of Ni-based sulfides. However, similar to Ni-based oxides, only improving the capacity of cathode materials could not dramatically increase the energy density of ECs. Basically, the device performance is closely related to packaging processes, excluding the nature of electrode materials. In particular, the charge balance and mass balance of cathode and anode materials have great influence on the charge/discharge processes. The stored charges (Q) in each electrode can be determined by the following equation: Q = C × ΔV × m(13)where C, ΔV, and m are the capacitance, operating voltage window, and mass of active material of a single electrode, respectively. For an EC, the stored charges in the cathode and anode should be equal, i.e. Q+ = Q−. Analysis of the CV results of Ni-based sulfide ECs is shown in Table 8; it can be found that the smaller the area of CV curves at a low voltage is, the lower the energy density of the device will be (as shown in ref. 209 and 210). Besides the relatively low capacity of the single NiCo2S4 electrode, the cathode and anode may not match well, leading to a low delivered capacitance for the whole device at a low voltage window (0–0.6 V). As a result, the device will deliver a lower energy density at the same voltage window. It should also be pointed out that numerous efforts and attention have been devoted to improving the performance of cathode materials, whereas the capacitance of anode materials is still at a very unsatisfied level (<300 F g−1).
4 Ni-based metal organic framework electrode materials
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a subclass of coordination polymers with a porous nature, which consist of metal ions or clusters coordinated with organic ligands to form specific architectures.211 In other words, MOF is an interconnected network with duplicated coordination entities, extending in one-, two-, or three-dimension. The porous MOFs have very low mass densities (∼0.13 g cm−3), high surface areas (up to 10000 m2 g−1), large pore volumes, and uniform pore size distributions.212 Moreover, the pore size of MOFs can be tuned from angstroms to nanometers by using different lengths of organic ligands.213–215 In most cases, the pores in MOFs are stable during the elimination of the guest molecules (often solvents). Therefore, MOFs with a porous structure and large surface area are adaptable for a variety of applications, such as carbon dioxide capture, hydrogen storage, and electrochemical energy storage.
4.1 Ni-based metal–organic framework electrode
In this section, nickel based MOFs directly working as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage will be discussed, where the nickel ion serves as a central metal ion linking with organic ligands. By using different organic ligands, one can synthesize Ni-based MOFs with different physical and chemical properties.
Qu et al. successfully synthesized a series of Ni-based pillared DABCO-MOFs (DMOFs) of similar structure [Ni(L)(DABCO)0.5] (DABCO, i.e. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]-octane),216 where L is a functionalized ligand such as NDC (1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid), ADC (9,10-anthracenedicarboxylic acid), or TM (2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid), as shown in Fig. 13a. They found that Ni–DMOF–ADC and Ni–DMOF–TM were stable and maintained large surface area upon water exposure, while Ni–DMOF–NDC was degraded. The good structural stability and large surface area of Ni–DMOF–ADC and Ni–DMOF–TM suggested that they were quite suitable for use as electrodes. Fig. 13b showed that the Ni–DMOF–ADC exhibited a high specific capacitance of 552 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 438 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 with excellent cycling stability (98% capacitance retention compared with the initial one at 10 A g−1 after 15000 cycles) in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.

By dissolving NiCl2·6H2O and PTA (p-benzenedicarboxylic acid) in DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide), Yang et al. prepared a layered 2D [Ni3(OH)2(C8H4O4)2·(H2O)4]·2H2O (Ni-MOF-24) by a solvothermal method.217 The electrode exhibited specific capacitances of 1127 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 668 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Over 90% of the initial capacitance was retained after 3000 cycles. To further improve the specific capacitance, different amounts of ZnCl2 were introduced during the aforementioned solvothermal process, by which Zn-doped Ni-MOF-24 was obtained.218 The Zn2+ ion played a significant role in the formation of Zn-doped Ni-MOF-24 with different morphologies and structures as well as its electrochemical performance. The optimized Zn-doped Ni-MOF delivered a specific capacitance of 1620 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 and showed excellent cycling stability. By adding Ni(Cl)2·6H2O together with H3btc (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) in a solvent of DMF, Kang et al. synthesized Ni3(btc)2·12H2O by a solvothermal method,219 which delivered a specific capacitance of 726 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 94.6% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles in a 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Utilizing a simple co-precipitation method, Chen et al. prepared Ni3(Fe(CN)6)2(H2O) by mixing solutions of K3[Fe(CN)6] and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O at room temperature.220 The Ni3(Fe(CN)6)2(H2O) electrode showed specific capacitances of 574.7 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 453.5 F g−1 at 1.8 A g−1 in a 1 M KNO3 aqueous electrolyte. Wen et al. reported a solvothermal route to grow Ni-MOF on a CNT surface by dissolving NiCl2·6H2O, H2BDC (1,4-dicarboxybenzene), and CNTs in DMF.221 The optimized Ni-MOF/CNT electrode revealed a specific capacitance of 1765 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Banerjee et al. successfully synthesized Ni-doped MOF-5-RGO (Zn4O(BDC)3, BDC2− = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; RGO, reduced graphene oxide) composites by a room-temperature solution method.222 The optimized Ni-doped MOF-5/RGO electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 758 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 in a 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.
4.2 Ni-based compounds derived from Ni-based MOFs
Besides using raw MOFs as electrodes, many researchers have explored a post treatment process to synthesize Ni-based oxides,223 sulfides,224 or phosphates225 derived from various MOFs towards high electrochemical performance. Herein, we will review the Ni compounds derived from Ni-based metal organic frameworks, in which the metal ion is nickel ion.
Wu et al. synthesized partially graphitic porous carbon coated nickel nanoparticles by a Ni-MOF template route.226 In this approach, NiCl2·6H2O was reacted with BDC (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) under solvothermal conditions. Then heat and acid treatments were carried out to obtain partially graphitic porous carbon with embedded metallic nickel nanoparticles, following which the product was coated on stainless steel foil by electrophoretic deposition. The as-prepared electrode exhibited high specific capacitances of 886 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 746 F g−1 at 30 A g−1. Sun et al. reported a facile wet chemical method to fabricate a novel Ni-based MOF (Ni(H2O)2[Ni(CN)4]·XH2O) as the precursor.227 The nanoporous NiO nanosheets were obtained by heating the Ni-MOF precursor at 300 °C in air. The NiO nanosheets delivered a specific capacitance of 527.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and showed good cycling stability (with 80.2% capacitance retention at 5 A g−1 after 500 cycles). Xia et al. prepared nitrogen-doped mesoporous interlinked carbon/NiO nanosheets by annealing treatment of Ni-ZIF-8 (ZIF, Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework).228 The Ni-ZIF-8 was synthesized by mixing two ethanol solutions containing Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 2-methylimidazole, respectively, and then aging overnight at room temperature. After heat treatment, the as-prepared C/NiO electrode showed a specific capacitance of 414 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 92.2% after 3000 cycles. By chemical etching/anion exchange reaction of PBA (Prussian blue analogue) with S2− ion, Yu et al. obtained nickel sulfide cubic nanoframes.224 The PBA nanocubes with a tuned size were synthesized by mixing two types of solution and aging for 24 h at room temperature. The two solutions were obtained as follows: (i) nickel nitrate and sodium citrate were dissolved in deionized water; (ii) potassium hexacyanocobaltate(III) was dissolved separately in deionized water. Fig. 14 schematically demonstrates the morphological evolution process of the NiS nanoframes from Ni–Co PBA nanocubes. The formation mechanism of NiS nanoframes was proposed as follows: the rough edges of PBA nanotubes possessed higher curvature and more defects than the smooth plane surface, which had more reactive sites for chemical etching/anion exchange. The annealed NiS nanoframes with a size of 300 nm exhibited high specific capacitances of 2112 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 711 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, and showed excellent cycling stability (91.8% capacitance compared with the initial one after 4000 cycles).

Also, by using the ligand substitution mechanism in a hydrothermal method, Bendi et al. prepared hollow porous NixPyOz composites from Ni-based MOFs (Ni-MOFs).229 The Ni-MOF consisting of 1D zigzag chains was synthesized by mixing BTC (benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) with nickel nitrate hexahydrate in an ethanol–water solution. The as-prepared NixPyOz showed good rating capability of 1627 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 1044 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, whereas the specific capacitance of pristine Ni-MOF are only 399.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 84 F g−1 at 20 A g−1. Pramanik and coworkers successfully synthesized nanoporous nickel phosphate (NiP) by heat treatment of Ni-MOF, which was prepared by reacting nickel(II) chloride with NMPA (nitrilotris(methylene)triphosphonic acid) via a hydrothermal method.230 The NiP electrode delivered a specific capacitance of 265 F g−1 at 20 mV s−1.
4.3 Ni-based compounds derived from other MOFs
Besides Ni-MOF, some researchers have also attempted to design hierarchical Ni-based compounds with a MOF template (mainly ZIF-67), in which the central metal ion is NOT the nickel ion. Hu and coworkers reported Co3O4/NiCo2O4 double shelled nanocages (DSNCs) derived from ZIF-67.231 The detailed formation process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 15a. The ZIF-67 was prepared by a common method, i.e. two methanol solutions containing Co(NO3)2 and 2-methylimidazole, respectively, were mixed and aged for 24 h at room temperature. Then the as-prepared ZIF-67 was added into a methanol solution of Ni(NO3)2, which was then stirred for 30 min to form Ni–Co LDH yolk-shelled particles. Finally, the Co3O4/NiCo2O4 DSNCs were formed by thermal calcination in air, whose morphology is shown in Fig. 15b. The Co3O4/NiCo2O4 DSNCs exhibited high specific capacitances of 972 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 and 615 F g−1 at 50 A g−1, which were much higher than that of Co3O4 nanocages (Fig. 15c).

Similarly, Jiang et al. reported the preparation of Ni–Co LDH nanocages with a simple and facile method by utilizing ZIF-67 as a sacrificial template.232 The ZIF-67 was dispersed in an ethanol solution of Ni(NO3)2, and then it was refluxed for 1 h under vigorous stirring. The Ni–Co LDH nanocages showed a specific capacitance of 1203 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 90.2% after 1000 cycles. Gao et al. also utilized ZIF-67 as a sacrificial template to synthesize a Ni2CO3(OH)2@ZIF-67 composite.233 The as-prepared composite delivered a specific capacitance of 1037 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 m V s−1 and showed excellent cycling performance. Utilizing a solvothermal route, He et al. synthesized a Ni–Co MOF based on the ligand H2BDC (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid).234 The Ni–Co LDH microspheres were obtained by a simple reaction of Ni–Co MOF with KOH aqueous solution for 1 h, delivering a specific capacitance of 1235.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1.
Ni-based metal organic framework (MOF) electrode materials can be mainly divided into two types: (1) porous macromolecular Ni-based MOFs directly utilized as electrode materials; (2) Ni-based compounds, such as nickel oxides, nickel sulfides and ternary Ni-based compounds, derived from MOFs used as electrode materials. In the first case, the Ni-based MOFs have a certain microporous/nanoporous distribution tuned by ligands. Proper porosity is beneficial for achieving outstanding electrochemical performance as discussed above. Besides that, the nickel ion in MOFs provokes high electrochemical activity, and bonding with organic ligands enhances the structural flexibility during the redox reactions. It is noteworthy that some Ni-based MOFs are very sensitive to water, causing the decrease of electrochemical performance when tested in an aqueous electrolyte. The other types of Ni-based compounds derived from MOFs provide efficient ways to synthesize electrode materials with a specific designed nanostructure. After annealing or other treatments to remove the organic skeletons, the as-prepared Ni-based oxides or sulfides can still retain the morphology and structure of the MOF precursor. Owing to the diverse structures of MOFs, one can obtain some special nanostructured Ni-based compounds, which cannot be directly prepared by general inorganic synthesis approaches. However, everything is dialectical in this world. The organic ligands used to synthesize the MOFs are normally expensive and toxic, which dramatically impedes the practical applications of Ni-based MOF electrodes in energy storage systems.
5 Summary and outlook
In this review, numerous strategies have been summarized to synthesize different structured Ni compound-based materials, such as nickel oxides, nickel sulfides, ternary nickel based metal oxides, and ternary nickel based metal sulfides towards high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices. Due to the high theoretical capacity, low cost, high activity, and low toxicity compared with the traditional bulk materials and hydrous RuO2 electrodes, Ni-based compounds are proposed as promising candidates for electrochemical applications. However, nickel oxide is a p-type semiconductor with a stable band gap. To circumvent the intrinsically low electric conductivity of nickel oxides, ternary metal compounds are designed by introducing other transition metals. Besides that, transformation of nickel oxide into its sulfide counterpart and in situ growth of nickel oxides on carbon matrixes are deemed to be effective routes to enhance the electrochemical performance of Ni compound-based electrodes. Moreover, the rational and smart design of sophisticated nanostructures of Ni compound-based electrodes can further facilitate the electrochemical reactions at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte, leading to enhanced capacity, high rate performance, and excellent cycling stability. The nanostructured materials can provide large surface area, more electroactive sites, and fast ion/electron diffusion/transport pathway to improve the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of electrochemical reactions for high energy and power density.
Although much effort has been devoted to the synthesis of Ni compound-based materials and their application in electrochemical energy storage over the past few decades, many challenges are still being faced. We propose that the future trends of Ni compound-based materials for ever-increasing electrochemical energy storage could be as follows:
(i) A systematic and comprehensive understanding of electrochemical redox reaction mechanisms and pathways of Ni compound-based materials is needed for some in situ and ex situ nanocharacterization techniques. More recently, some researchers pointed out that the electrochemical behaviors of nickel oxides and nickel hydroxides are analogous to that of batteries instead of pseudocapacitive electrodes. Not only that, nickel sulfides and ternary Ni-based metal compounds have very similar electrochemical characteristics, i.e. obvious redox peaks in CV curves and plateaus in charge/discharge curves. Thus, further exploration should be focused on the mechanisms and the dynamic electrochemical reaction processes of Ni compound-based materials.
(ii) To improve the electrochemical performance of Ni compound-based materials, deliberately designed nanoarchitectures with controllable sizes and multinary metal compounds with a superior synergistic effect are highly desired. Nanostructured materials with high surface area and specific pore sizes facilitate the penetration and diffusion of electrolytes as well as provide more electroactive sites, resulting in high capacity and rate performance. Furthermore, the multinary Ni-based metal compounds offer rich redox species for charge transfer during the electrochemical reactions, owing to which the energy storage capability can be effectively increased several times compared with that of single metal compounds.
(iii) Though Ni compound-based materials are proposed as battery-type electrodes, it is nothing inappropriate to combine nanostructured Ni compound-based materials with capacitive materials to fabricate a hybrid energy storage device. In other words, hybrid capacitors assembled with Ni compound-based materials (cathode) and carbonaceous materials (anode) are proposed to achieve outstanding electrochemical performance with high energy and power density. This aqueous hybrid capacitor with a potential window of 1.5–1.7 V can take full advantage of the virtue of both electrodes to obtain higher power density (than batteries) and energy density (than traditional capacitors). Nonetheless, how to optimize the electrochemical performance of the two materials with different charge storage mechanisms is still a challenge.
