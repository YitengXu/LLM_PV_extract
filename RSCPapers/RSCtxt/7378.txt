These were achieved by growing the single crystal of Y6via a simple solvent evaporation method and then using a “gold trips sticking” technique. We found that in the single crystal structure Y6 exhibited two isomers with a chiral symmetry (M- or P-enantiomer), which were responsible for the two-dimensional porous networks. The hierarchical structures could be favorable for charge transport along π–π stacking directions, as confirmed by SC-OFETs: high ambipolar mobilities with a hole mobility of 0.84 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 1.94 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained. This could be further used as phototransistors with a high responsivity of 1.2 × 103 A W−1 and a photosensitivity of 2.1 × 104.
Introduction
Non-fullerene organic solar cells (NFOSCs) based on fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have made rapid progress in the past few years with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) close to 18%.1–5 These electron acceptors are usually constructed in acceptor–donor–acceptor configurations in which the donor part contains fused structures, such as indacenodithieno[3,2-b]-thiophene,4 indacenodithiophene6–8 and dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (DTT-BT).5 The acceptor parts use strong electron-deficient 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) and its derivatives via the introduction of fluorine, chlorine and methyl groups.7,9–11 The design strategy enables FREAs to have the absorption spectra in the near-infrared (NIR) region, low-lying frontier energy levels, and particularly excellent electron transports via the IC end groups.12,13 Currently, most studies focus on developing new FREAs to realize distinct absorption spectra and frontier energy levels in order to obtain high performance NFOSCs but their intrinsic properties, such as the molecular packing structures14,15 and charge carrier mobilities9 that can be used to explain the high performance, have been rarely studied.
Single-crystal organic field-effect transistors (SC-OFETs) that use single-crystal conjugated materials as a charge transport layer play an important role in the study of intrinsic charge transport properties of organic semiconductors since organic single crystals exhibit minimal grain boundaries and traps compared to their thin film counterparts.16–21 However, these devices have never been reported based on FREA molecules. Long and branched alkyl chains are usually introduced into these acceptors in order to improve their solubilities and microstructures; however, they are also responsible for the difficulty caused in growing single crystals. Therefore, most studies use the two-dimensional grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAX) to reveal the microstructures of FREAs in thin films. There are only a few studies that have reported the single crystal structures of FREAs. Marks et al., introduced fluorine atoms to FREAs, in which they found that the number of fluorination had significantly impacted the crystal structures.22 Similar studies had also been conducted by He et al., in which they found that the different positions of chlorine atoms could significantly influence the molecular orientation and packing.14 All these results strongly suggest that FREAs are able to grow single crystals, which will be very interesting if used as charge transport layers for OFETs.
Recently, a FREA molecule, namely Y6 (Fig. 1a), had exhibited excellent application in NFOSCs.1,3,5,23 Therefore, we intentionally selected this molecule to grow single crystals via a solution self-assembling technique.24–26 Interestingly, an X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that Y6 was crystallized in triclinic unit cells in which M- and P-enantiomers embrace the “porous” interpenetrating networks. SC-OFETs with this single crystal proved that the porous networks exhibited high ambipolar mobilities with a hole mobility of 0.84 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 1.94 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is among the highest mobilities of n-type small molecule semiconductors.27–30 The outstanding charge transport properties also enabled us to fabricate single-crystal organic phototransistors (SC-OPTs),25,31–33 in which a responsivity (R) of 1.1 × 103 A W−1 and a photosensitivity (P) of 2.1 × 104 could be obtained. These results reveal that the existence of isomers in Y6 is responsible for the porous networks, which can explain the high charge carrier mobility and high performance NFOSCs.

Y6 was first reported by Zou et al.,5 and then was widely applied in NFOSCs with PCEs close to 18%.3Y6 exhibits strong absorption spectra in the NIR region (Fig. 1b) that is responsible for the high photocurrent of over 25 mA cm−2.5,34–37 Hence, we speculate that Y6 may be packed in an extraordinary mode, and the intrinsic charge carrier mobilities of Y6 would be much higher than those measured by the space charge limit current method.
The crystals of Y6 for the X-ray crystallography analysis were grown from a chloroform/isopropanol mixture via a solvent vapor diffusion strategy. Y6 was crystallized in the triclinic space group P with a twisted molecular configuration and two independent molecules in one unit cell (M- and P-isomers) (Fig. 2a). The homochirality (M- or P-enantiomer) coexisted in one crystal due to the terminal IC units pointed toward different directions (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2c, ESI†), which is similar to S/N-hetero[11]helicene moieties.38,39 As expected, the electron-rich DTT-BT cores (donor) of Y6 had a deformed structure due to the repulsion arising from the 2-ethylhexyl on the pyrrole nitrogen up to 10.4°. The terminal IC units (acceptor) were twisted toward opposite directions with respect to the lateral thiophene ring at an angle of 8.9° (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The twisted structures could be partially attributed to the intramolecular conformational interlock, originating from the strong intramolecular S⋯OC interactions (Fig. S1b, ESI†).15,22,40,41 Therefore, the dihedral angle of 20.34° between the two terminal IC units in the Y6 molecule for both M- and P-isomer could be observed (Fig. 2b).

We then discussed the molecular packing and three-dimensional structures of the Y6 single crystal (Fig. 2c and d). We observed π–π interactions with the d-spacings of 3.23–3.65 Å between different units including donor/donor, donor/acceptor and acceptor/acceptor in two isomers (Fig. S1d, ESI†). These interactions enable Y6 to construct a “porous” interpenetrating supramolecular structure (Fig. 2d).14 In addition, the hetero-chiral crystals with a twisted molecular core staggered into a condensed two-dimensional (2D) π–π stacking mode with multiple interlocked S⋯π, C–H⋯F, C–H⋯N interactions between adjacent molecules (Fig. 2c).16 This unique “brick”-like structure of rac-Y6 provides multiple electron transport tunnels that are expected to favour efficient ambipolar charge transport.
In order to investigate the charge transport properties of the Y6 single crystal containing chiral enantiomers, we fabricated top-contact bottom-gate SC-OFET devices by applying micrometer-sized racemic single crystals. The single-crystalline micro-ribbons of rac-Y6 were prepared by a slow self-assembling of the chloroform solution (0.2 mg mL−1) with the n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified SiO2/Si substrates24 under a certain solvent pressure in a closed jar. The crystal structure of the nanowires was evaluated using cross-polarized optical microscopy (CPOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2, ESI†). The single-crystalline micro-ribbons of rac-Y6 exhibited excellent long-range and homogenous regularity with a length of 20–200 micrometers, as shown in OM images (Fig. S2, ESI†). The thickness ranged from several to tens of nanometers with very smooth surfaces, as shown in SEM and AFM images (Fig. 3). The change in crystal intensities in the CPOM images indicated the single crystal nature of the micro-plates (Fig. 3c and d). The out of plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with strong and sharp multiple Bragg diffractions in Fig. S3a (ESI†) indicate high degree crystalline structures of the micro-ribbons of rac-Y6. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. S3b, ESI†) of rac-Y6 micro-plates show ordered and bright diffractions at different places, indicating the single-crystal nature of the micro-ribbons.

We then fabricated SC-OFETs based on these elongated crystals of rac-Y6 using Au as the source and drain electrodes through a “gold trips sticking” technique.19,42 Typical transfer and output curves of representative optimal devices, which were tested under glove box conditions, are presented in Fig. 4. The maximum/average ambipolar mobilities of these ribbons and corresponding important characters including width/length ratio of the devices, on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) and threshold voltage (Vth) are summarized in Table 1. The V-shape ambipolar phenomenon can be observed in Fig. 4 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). Ambipolar charge transports with a hole mobility of 0.84 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 1.94 cm2 V−1 s−1 could be obtained. For comparison, we also fabricated thin film OFETs based on Y6, in which ambipolar mobility could also be obtained but with low hole and electron mobilities (0.012 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.044 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) (Table 1). Such excellent ambipolar transport properties based on over 20 devices can be attributed to its compact brick-like π–π stacking mode formed by multiple intermolecular interactions and strongly suggests that the 2D brick-like π–π stacking is responsible for the efficient charge transport.

The high ambipolar mobilities and excellent absorption properties of rac-Y6 intrigue us to further fabricate OPT devices based on OFETs. We used a cold light-emitting diode illumination (LED) with an emission spectrum in the visible range to perform the measurement. The schematic device structure of the OPT is shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b and c showed n-type transfer curves of OPTs based on the thin film and single crystal Y6, which were obtained by varying the LED intensity within 45–2290 μW cm−2. The P and R of the OPT devices as a function of the incident light intensity are shown in Fig. 5d. All the OPT devices could recover to their initial state when the light was off. When using a light intensity of 2290 μW cm−2, a photoresponsivity of R = 0.27 A W−1 and P = 8.7 × 102 were obtained for thin-film OPTs, which was significantly enhanced to R = 1200 A W−1 and P = 2.1 × 104 for single crystal OPTs (Table 2). This can be explained by the efficient charge transport of the rac-Y6 crystal with minimal traps.31,43,44 Under the assumption that the shot noise from the dark current is the dominant contribution to the noise current,43 the specific detectivity D* for thin-film OPTs and single crystal OPTs are 5.6 × 1011 Jones and 1.8 × 1014 Jones, respectively. The low detectivity is mainly attributed to the high dark current density, which is as high as 0.13 mA cm−2 in single crystal OPTs. (Table 2). Photoresponse time is also an important parameter for OPTs, but unfortunately, we were unable to perform this measurement. It has been reported that OPTs exhibit a relatively long response time (0.4–4.7 s) compared to inorganic phototransistors,45–47 which could be due to the trapping of photogenerated charge carriers at the organic semiconductor/dielectric interface and the slow recombination nature of the generated carriers in organic semiconductors.48

In conclusion, in this study, we have successfully obtained the single crystal of rac-Y6 and we found chiral symmetry enantiomers, which were responsible for the porous internetworks of rac-Y6. This unique structure facilitated the charge transport, so that SC-OFETs based on rac-Y6 single crystals exhibited high ambipolar mobility. This device could be further applied into OPTs, resulting in a high responsivity of 1.1 × 103 A W−1 and a photosensitivity of 2.1 × 104. Our studies, in this work, reveal the outstanding networks for charge transports, explaining the high performance NFOSCs based on Y6. More importantly, the results also indicate that FREAs have great potential application in high performance OFETs and OPTs.
