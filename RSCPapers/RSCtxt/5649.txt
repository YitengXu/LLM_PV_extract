    , Accepted 16th July 2019First published on 16th July 2019AbstractBiomass is a naturally abundant, sustainable and clean resource, which has potential to replace a portion of the finite petroleum and fossil feedstock for sustainable production of value-added chemicals and fuels. However, an efficient conversion process is still difficult to be achieved due to the complex nature of biomass. Currently, the simple, mild, and environmentally benign photocatalytic process appears to be a new research avenue for lignocellulosic biomass transformation. This review provides insights into the state-of-the-art accomplishments in photocatalytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass and its derivatives, including selective cleavage of dominant bonds of lignin, valorization of processed and native lignin, photoreforming reactions of cellulose and its intermediates, and the depolymerization of robust native lignocellulose under visible or UVA light irradiation. In addition, electricity production from photocatalytic conversion of biomass is also discussed as an innovative lignocellulosic biomass transformation process. We then put forward perspectives for photocatalytic conversion of native lignocellulose and future challenges in increasing the profitability and sustainability of a photocatalysis biorefinery system.Xiaoqing LiuXiaoqing Liu received her M.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2016.

1. Introduction
Biomass produced by the photosynthesis of CO2 and water stores solar energy in the form of chemical energy. Biomass resources are widely available in the natural environment. It is estimated that the global biomass production is approximately 100 billion tons per year.1 Lignocellulose is the most abundant form of biomass and indigestible for humans and most animals.2 Biomass waste will become an abundantly available resource, if properly handled. Rationally exploiting the waste into value-added products has gained significance in the scientific community nowadays.3 The International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that bioenergy has the potential to provide 10% of the world's primary energy supply by 2035, and biofuels can replace up to 27% of world transportation fuel by 2050.1 This indicates that biomass is promising to be a supplement for the limited petroleum and fossil feedstock to provide chemicals and fuels. Moreover, energy production from biomass is an environmentally benign process with low hazardous impacts on the natural environment.4 Therefore, the exploitation of biomass could help address two global issues: the sharply increased demands for chemicals and fuels, and the adverse impacts on the global environment and climate caused by the depletion of the finite fossil fuels.5,6
Lignocellulosic biomass generally refers to organic materials such as wood, grass, and agricultural crop residues. The main contents of lignocellulosic biomass are lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. In terms of the structure of the whole lignocellulose (Fig. 1), lignin is located in the outer cell wall of biomass which provides extra rigidity and recalcitrance to the entire material. Cellulose is located within the lignin shell and forms bundles attached together by hemicellulose with a random structure.7,8 The most abundant component in lignocellulosic biomass is cellulose, constituting 35–50 wt%. It is a linear crystalline polymer composed of glucose units. A cellulose molecule has the generic chemical formula (C6H12O5)n, in which glucose-based monomers are joined together through β-1,4-glycosidic linkages.9 The glucose units are further tightly confined by the extensive intramolecular and intermolecular bonding networks,10 endowing cellulose with rigid crystallinity which impedes hydrolysis. Hemicellulose, constituting 20–30 wt% of lignocellulosic biomass, is an amorphous branched polymer. Hemicellulose is generally comprised of five different sugar monomers, i.e., D-xylose, L-arabinose, D-galactose, D-glucose, and D-mannose, among which xylose is the most abundant.11 Lignin is an amorphous polymer of aromatic allylic alcohols. It is resistant to hydrolysis and cannot be utilized by fermentation.12 Three phenylpropanoid precursors of lignin are p-coumaryl alcohol (trans-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propen-1-ol), coniferyl alcohol (trans-3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-propen-1-ol) and sinapyl alcohol (trans-3-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propen-1-ol).13 The dominant linkage in lignin is the β-O-4 bond, accounting for 43–65% of all lignin linkages.14 Lignin (constituting up to 30 wt% in lignocellulosic biomass) is appealing as a source of small aromatic molecules such as phenols and aryl ethers.15

Lignocellulose first has to be depolymerised and (partially) deoxygenated for further production of liquid fuels or commodity chemicals.16,17 The complex structure of lignocellulose makes it an energy-consuming process and difficult to generate target chemicals and fuels with high yields. Biological processes and chemocatalytic methods have been studied to convert lignocellulosic biomass.10,18 Biological processes, such as fermentation and enzymatic catalysis, involve the use of peculiar enzymes, bacteria and other microorganisms to break down cellulose or starch. The physical conditions of biological processes are less severe than those of chemocatalytic methods. However, the intricate structure of lignocellulosic biomass leads to low accessibility of cellulose to enzymatic hydrolysis,19 giving rise to the relatively low conversion rate20 and potentially high cost in pretreatment. For example, the cost of cellulosic ethanol is approximately two times higher than that of corn ethanol.21 These challenges limit the scaling-up of biological processes.22 Some chemocatalytic methods, such as pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrogenation, typically require high temperature or/and pressure, thus resulting in intensive thermal energy consumption.23 For example, pyrolysis is commonly used to convert biomass to biofuels and biochar, and the pyrolysis temperature ranges from 573 to 1073 K.24 Hydrogenation of biomass is typically conducted under high pressure ranging from 2.0 to 5.5 MPa.25,26 Other chemocatalytic methods, such as acid-catalysis, are used for hydrolysis of cellulose in lignocellulosic biomass, and can be conducted at 373–533 K, 0.1–4 MPa. Nowadays, much attention is being paid to the use of solid acid catalysts, such as layered transition metal oxides, acidic resins and acid-modified amorphous carbon.10 In contrast, solar light as an inexhaustible energy source can be leveraged to replace thermal energy. For instance, the solid acid-catalytic hydrolysis of cellulose can be conducted at lower temperatures ranging from 353 to 413 K under Uv-vis light irradiation.27–30 Therefore, it is becoming an industrial priority to develop novel strategies, which could use solar energy to convert green resources such as biomass into value-added raw materials and energy vectors.31
“Photocatalysis” is a term used to describe the acceleration of chemical reactions by photo-induced electrons/holes, in the presence of a photocatalyst under electromagnetic radiation.33,34 In recent decades, photocatalysis has been extensively studied for contaminant remediation,35 fine chemical synthesis,36,37 proton reduction38 and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction.39 More recently, photocatalytic conversion of biomass to high-value-added products has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional catalytic processes.20,33 Compared to conventional chemocatalytic approaches, photocatalytic reactions are typically carried out under ambient atmospheric pressure and temperature because of the use of photon rather than thermal energy. This mild process provides convenient control of selective cleavage of certain bonds in lignocellulose, to obtain valuable chemicals with valuable aromatic units and functional groups reserved.40 For example, metal complexes and semiconductors have been used for the cleavage of certain bonds in components of biomass.15,27 Moreover, fuels and electricity can also be generated from two other different photocatalytic biomass conversion processes, respectively. For production of fuels, biomass conversion was combined with the water-splitting process to produce hydrogen (H2).41 In this process, photo-oxidation of biomass helps reduce the electron–hole (e−–h+) recombination rate, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the water-splitting process. Solar induced fuel cells are emerging devices to generate electricity from photocatalytic reforming of biomass. In this process, biomass is oxidized on the photoanode and oxygen (O2) reduction occurs on the photocathode under light irradiation.42
A growing number of publications deal with the photocatalytic conversion of biomass to chemicals, fuels and other energy sources such as electricity. However, photocatalytic reforming of raw biomass and biomass derivatives has not been comprehensively reviewed previously.41,43 In order to facilitate the further development of such a promising process, it is highly desired and timely to conduct a systematic review of recent advances in this area. Therefore, in this review, we aim to provide a critical overview of the recent research advances in this field, and outlook for the future development trends and research directions. Specifically, we comprehensively analysed the photocatalytic conversion of native lignocellulosic biomass, its primary structural components (e.g., lignin and cellulose) and the platform chemicals with various functionalities (lignin model compounds, glucose, HMF, etc.). In addition, we discussed the photocatalytic electricity production processes using biomass as the feedstock.
2. Fundamentals of lignocellulosic biomass photocatalysis
2.1 Mechanisms for the photocatalytic process
An electron (e−) is promoted from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), after absorbing a photon with energy exceeding the bandgap energy (EBG) of the photocatalyst, leaving a vacancy called a hole (h+) on the valence band. The electrons on the conduction band are responsible for the reduction processes. The most common reduction process of biomass photoreforming is the reduction of a proton by an electron to form H2. In this process, lignocellulose or its derivatives act as sacrificial agents to be oxidized by photo-induced holes, thus reducing the e−–h+ recombination rate and increasing the efficiency of water-splitting processes.44 Lignocellulosic biomass can be completely mineralized to CO2.45 However, the greenness of this approach might be compromised by the CO2 emission as greenhouse gas. In contrast, value-added products can be obtained when biomass-derived intermediates are partly oxidized.46 The holes generated in photocatalysis have a high potential to oxidise organic species, either directly or indirectly by forming oxidative radicals to oxidize the target materials. For instance, hydroxyl ions (OH−) would react with the oxidative hole to produce hydroxyl radicals (˙OH, redox potential: +2.81 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, SHE). Then, oxidative radicals will attack the biomass molecules. Taking a lignin photoreforming process as an example (Scheme 1), reactive ˙OH radicals can result in the degradation of lignin due to the scission of the β-O-4 bond. This results in the generation of benzyl, alkoxy and alkyl free radicals which take part in a variety of lignin depolymerisation reactions to form low molecular weight lignin fragments. The ˙OH radicals can also directly attack the phenyl rings of lignin to form catechol, resorcinol and hydroquinone.47 Other reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be formed during a photocatalytic process, including superoxide anions (O2˙−, redox potential: +0.89 V vs. SHE), singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) and O3− species.33 ROS is essential in heterogeneous photocatalysis. It plays important roles in selective organic photocatalytic oxidations. So, researchers can control the generation of ROS by changing photocatalysts, reaction media, light source etc. to obtain more desired products. Theoretically, the utilisation of both electrons and holes ensures that the chemical energy is completely utilized. However, processes such as the direct recombination of the stimulated electron–hole pairs, or self-trapping of the photogenerated charges by surface/bulk defects, all lead to the consumption of converted solar energy and result in deteriorated photocatalytic efficiency.2 Thus, strategies for minimizing the recombination of electrons and holes will enhance the light utilization efficiency.

2.2 Photocatalysts for lignocellulosic biomass conversion
Heterogeneous photocatalysis has been intensively studied for the valorization of biomass and its derived compounds, due to its benefits of being clean and energy-efficient, easy separation of the catalysts and mild reaction conditions. A few semiconductor photocatalysts have been explored for the photocatalysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most frequently used semiconductor, due to its strong oxidizing capacity induced by prior excitation with radiation of suitable frequency, long-term photostability, commercial availability and low cost. The most important factor that influences the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 is its crystal phases.48 TiO2 of different phases has been intensively studied.49 Moreover, deliberately tuning the anatase–rutile surface-phase junction of TiO2 can significantly enhance its photocatalytic activity.50,51 The phase junctions may facilitate the transfer of the photo-generated electron from the conduction band of the rutile phase to the trapping sites on the anatase surface,51 thereby improving the charge-separation efficiency and enhancing the photocatalytic activity. However, the large bandgap of TiO2 (∼3.2 eV) makes it inactive under visible light irradiation,52 which largely restricts its practical applications. Therefore, a large number of research studies have been conducted to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 using different strategies, including loading metallic particles on TiO2,53 doping with non-metallic elements (e.g. C, N, P and S),54 or introducing heterojunctions by combination with other photocatalysts or immobilizing on carbon materials.55,56 For instance, the photocatalytic efficiency could be further improved by loading noble metals such as Pt, Ag, V and Au onto TiO2.53 After metal deposition, the photocatalytic process of the hetero-structures is based on the mechanism related to the photo-induced charge generation, separation and migration at metal–TiO2 interfaces.57 Taking Ag as an example, at the interface of the two materials, electrons will transfer from the counterpart with a lower work function (i.e., 4.26 eV for Ag) to the material with a higher work function (i.e., 5.1 eV for anatase type TiO2). In addition, the Fermi energy of Ag is higher than that of TiO2 due to the greater work function of TiO2. Thus, electrons would transfer from the Fermi level of Ag to that of TiO2 until reaching equilibrium, and then, a new Fermi energy level with more free electrons is established.57,58 Doping non-metal elements (e.g. N and B) into TiO2 also noticeably improves its photoactivity for the conversion of biomass-derived compounds to hydrogen.54 The reason could be that non-metal doping helps extend visible light absorption.59 Non-metal element doping also has effects on other photocatalytic properties of TiO2, such as the mobility of excited electrons and holes and their recombination rate.60 But there have been ongoing debates about the underlying mechanism of non-metal doping in improving the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in different senarios.61,62 Building heterojunctions is a good way to tune bandgaps to facilitate photoredox reactions.63
Sulphides such as CdS and NiS are frequently used as photocatalysts for the photoconversion of biomass-related materials. CdS is attractive because of its favourable bandgap (2.4 V) and matching band-edge stations. Nickel sulphide (NiS), a p-type semiconductor, has several merits such as low-cost and good electrical properties. CdS in different morphologies such as CdS quantum dots (QD)32 and CdS/CdOx45 has been prepared and applied for the valorization of biomass. NiS can be employed as a cocatalyst of CdS. An appropriate amount of NiS loading on CdS can substantially improve the charge carrier lifetime due to the charge transfer from CdS to NiS. Thus, 1D CdS/NiS nanocomposites exhibit enhanced visible light reactivity compared with pristine CdS nanowires.64 Other sulphides such as P-doped ZnxCd1−xS65 and ZnIn2S4 based photocatalysts14,66 have also been researched for their photocatalytic activities for biomass conversion. But, sulphide photocatalysts suffer from photo-corrosion during the photocatalytic process, which should be paid more attention to in the future research.
Silver based compounds have been widely used as visible-light responsive photocatalysts for biomass conversion. But, the photo-induced instability of silver compounds limits its large-scale utilization. Multi-heterojunction photocatalysts were designed based on silver compounds to increase both the activity and stability. For instance, Ag3PO4/SnO2/porcine bone was prepared and it showed enhanced activity in the photodegradation of lignosulfonate compared to pure Ag3PO4. The improved catalysis was due to the synergistic effect including the matched energy band alignment of Ag3PO4 and SnO2, and the hierarchically porous structure of porcine bone.67 Ag–AgCl/ZnO nanorods were synthesized and they showed excellent photocatalytic activities for degradation of lignin, owing to its enhanced light absorption ability and good e−–h+ separation property.68
Other metal-free photocatalysts such as carbon nitride (g-C3N4 and CNx)69,70 are also good candidates for biomass photocatalytic conversion. Carbon nitride is a nontoxic and inexpensive carbonaceous photocatalyst with well positioned band gaps. g-C3N4 possesses a bandgap of 2.7 eV, with the CB and VB positions at ca. −1.1 eV and ca. +1.6 eV vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which enables g-C3N4 to be active for a range of photocatalytic reactions.71 Compared with TiO2, the bandgap of g-C3N4 is narrower, resulting in an onset visible light absorption around 450–460 nm. Many research studies have been conducted to modulate the electronic structure and nanostructure of g-C3N4 to optimize its photocatalytic performance, which has been well summarized in a recent review.72
Only a few examples of using homogeneous photocatalysts for the conversion of biomass have been reported so far. Homogeneous photocatalysis of lignin model compounds has been studied using Ir and Earth-abundant V complexes as photocatalysts.15,73 The metal complex photocatalysts are often composed of rare metal ions with organic ligands. The reactivity can often be tuned by the choice and structure of ligands. Upon the absorption of a visible photon, the long-lived photoexcited state of the metal complex (*PC) is generated, and it is both more oxidative and more reductive than the ground-state species. Therefore, the reaction of *PC may proceed by either an oxidative or a reductive quenching cycle. In the oxidative quenching cycle, *PC functions as a reductant. Alternatively, in the reductive quenching cycle, *PC functions as an oxidant. An in-depth discussion of the extensive literature in these fields is directed to an existing review on this topic.74
3. Photocatalytic conversion of lignin
Degradation of lignin with TiO2 as the photocatalyst was first studied by Kobayakawa et al. (1989).75 However, the Kraft lignin was completely decomposed into carbon dioxide and water. Early in 1995, the simultaneous photo-evolution of molecular oxygen and volatile hydrocarbons was observed by Greenbaum et al. The photoreactions were conducted under high pressure and irradiation with near-UV and visible light and implanting ferric chloride and other photosensitizers such as semiconducting oxides in cellulose and wood.76 To take utmost advantage of biomass, research studies are focusing on the photocatalytic conversion of biomass-derived components to useful products. Firstly, selective cleavage of certain bonds was studied using lignin model compounds. Secondly, photocatalytic processes of native and processed lignin were conducted to obtain useful aromatic chemicals and H2.
3.1 Photocatalytic conversion of lignin model compounds
Lignin, the most abundant renewable feedstock for aromatic compounds,14 constituted 20–30 wt% of the lignocellulosic biomass.77 Selective cleavage of C–O bonds in lignin allows access to a variety of aromatic compounds, which can be further upgraded to fine chemicals. The cleavage of alkyl–aryl ether β-O-4 bonds, which represent 45–62% of the ether moieties of lignin,78 is the core to realize the lignin valorization process. Therefore, a number of studies have been conducted on the photocatalytic transformation of lignin β-O-4 models and native lignin from lignocellulosic biomass.14,32,79
One common method to cleave the C–O bond of the β-O-4 ethers is typically conducted in two steps as shown in Scheme 2. The first step is the selective oxidation of the benzylic β-O-4 alcohol to a benzylic β-O-4 ketone. The subsequent reductive process occurs to cleave the C–O bond, which allows the access to complementary fragmentation partners.80 Theoretical studies show that the C–O bond energy decreases from 69.2 to 55.9 kcal mol−1 induced by the initial oxidation of the alcohol to ketone.81,82
 Scheme 2  A two-step conversion strategy of the lignin β-O-4 linkage. 
Cao et al. reported a two-step process which comprises visible-light photocatalytic oxidation and in situ carbonic acid-facilitated hydrogenolysis for the cleavage of C–O bonds in lignin β-O-4 model compounds.79 In the first step, the secondary alcohol in the ether linkage is selectively oxidized to the corresponding ketone with up to 99% yield under visible light irradiation, using persulfate as a radical initiator and copper as the catalyst. In the second step, the C–O bond cleavage of lignin β-O-4 ketones was promoted using an in situ acidic EtOH/H2O/CO2 system in the presence of zinc powder, producing acetophenones and phenols in high yields.
Some metal complexes have shown promising photocatalytic properties in the cleavage of β-O-4 bonds. A selective [4-AcNH-TEMPO]BF4-mediated oxidation was combined with a chemoselective visible-light-mediated reductive C–O bond cleavage promoted by the photocatalyst [Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]PF6. This process was proved to be a mild and efficient two-stage lignin degradation strategy.15 Bond construction and cleavage can be greatly controlled to ultimately maintain the integrity of the fragmentation products, due to the separation of the oxidation and reduction steps, as well as the mild nature of the reaction conditions. This system was tested on relevant lignin model substrates containing β-O-4 linkages to generate fragmentation products with excellent yields (Table 1). Chemoselective reduction of carbon–oxygen bonds of α-keto ethers was conducted over an Ir(III) based photocatalyst thereafter by the same group.83 They found that the addition of iPr2Net and formic acid could enable complete consumption of the starting material in 12 h.

The first step of the two-step oxidation/reduction strategies is the “activation” of lignin for the controlled fragmentation reactions. As shown in Scheme 3, a combined system with photo-redox and Pd catalysis was developed for the efficient oxidation of lignin-related systems at room temperature. This is a vital step toward converting lignin to value-added, low molecular weight aromatics.84 Solvent as the reaction medium has a significant effect on the photocatalytic outcomes. The envisioned dual catalytic system was initially evaluated with photocatalysts 1(PF6) (1 mol%), Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%), and Na2S2O8 (1 equiv.) in acetonitrile (MeCN) using 4.4 W blue LEDs at room temperature. However, this resulted in only 11% of the oxidized product (Table 2, entry 1). By changing the reaction medium to dimethylformamide (DMF), 53% of the desired oxidized product could be yielded (Table 2, entry 2).84 Increasing the amount of persulfate to 2 equiv. further improved the yield, furnishing the product in 85% yield (Table 2, entry 3).

Semiconductors are also studied for the cleavage of β-O-4 bonds of model compounds. Luo et al. employed a photocatalytic oxidation–hydrogenolysis tandem method for cleaving C–O bonds of β-O-4 alcohols. Interestingly, the individual oxidation and hydrogenolysis reactions can be conducted consecutively with the coexistence of the two catalysts under aerobic conditions. The selectivity for phenols and ketones was up to 90%. Firstly, α-C–OH of β-O-4 alcohols is oxidized to α-CO over the Pd/ZnIn2S4 catalyst under an aerobic atmosphere with 455 nm light irradiation. Then a TiO2–NaOAc system is employed for cleaving C–O bonds neighbouring the α-CO bonds through a hydrogenolysis reaction by switching to 365 nm light.14 In-depth work reveals that the in situ formed Ti3+ is responsible for the photocatalytic hydrogenolysis of C–O bonds. This dual light wavelength switching strategy is believed to be particularly useful for converting highly functionalized molecules requiring multiple or cascade reactions. A transfer hydrogenolysis protocol was proposed for photocatalytic selective cleavage of β-O-4 bonds. Visible-light-driven fragmentation of lignin models was achieved over a ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst, and phenolic compounds were obtained by selective cleavage of β-O-4 bonds.66 The transfer hydrogenolysis protocol can be described as follows: during the photocatalysis, the CαH–OH hydrogen of β-O-4 models is transferred to the ZnIn2S4 surface to form a “hydrogen pool”, and then the Cβ–O bond is hydrogenated for cleavage by the hydrogen species in the “hydrogen pool”.
Carbazolic porous organic frameworks (POFs) are amorphous and porous polymers composed of cross-linked carbazoles. Extended π conjugation, insolubility in organic solvents, and visible-light response properties afford them as heterogeneous photocatalysts.85 More intriguingly, the photo-redox properties of these types of materials can be easily tuned.40 For example, Luo et al. reported a facile approach to tune the redox potentials of POFs by copolymerizing carbazolic electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) based comonomers at different ratios (Fig. 2). The resulting carbazolic copolymers (CzCPs) were used for the photocatalytic degradation of lignin β-O-4 models.80 CzCP100 (D:A = 0:100) exhibits the highest oxidation efficiency for benzylic β-O-4 alcohols to ketones (90–99% yields). The highest yields for the reductive cleavage of β-O-4 ketones are achieved by CzCP33 (D:A = 66:33), with 69–91% yields for ketone products and 74–86% yields for phenol products.

The presence of C–C bonds is one of the reasons for lignin's recalcitrance to be converted into value-added monomers. However, a facile and efficient method for the cleavage of C–C bonds has yet to be developed. Photocatalytic processes have great potential in reducing energy consumption for organic conduction and are being studied for the cleavage of C–C bonds. When a C–C bond is a targeted linkage to be cleaved, the activation of the Cβ–H bond is a requisite (Scheme 4).87,88 The cleavage of the β-O-4 bond is easier after the C–OH bond is preoxidized to a ketone. Once the C–OH bond is converted to a ketone via oxy-dehydrogenation, the Cα–Cβ bond dissociation energy (BDE) increases from 294.7 to 354.2 kJ mol−1, making the conversion of the ketone more difficult. Thus, a highly selective catalyst to oxidize β-1 C–C bonds should selectively activate the Cβ–H bond but suppress the formation of the ketone. Hou et al. prepared a CuOx/ceria/anatase nanotube hybrid showing excellent selectivity for oxidation of C–C bonds under visible light irradiation.86 Benzaldehydes with 96% yield were obtained when the lignin β-1 model was oxidized by photocatalysis.

Gazi et al. reported an Earth-abundant VV oxo complex supported by a redox non-innocent salicylaldimine ligand. It was used for the chemoselective C–C bond cleavage of lignin model compounds under ambient conditions, promoted by visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).73 Selective C–C bond cleavage leads to valuable and functional fine chemicals such as substituted aryl aldehydes and formates.
3.2 Photocatalytic conversion of native and processed lignin
The photoconversion of native and processed lignin to various valuable chemicals is displayed in Table 3. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) based photocatalysts have frequently been studied for the conversion of lignin. Bi and Pt co-modified TiO2 was prepared and used for photo-oxidation of lignin under solar light illumination to form guaiacol, vanillic acid, vanillin, and 4-phenyl-1-buten-4-ol. It exhibited better photocatalytic performance than Bi–TiO2 and Pt–TiO2. Bi and Pt provided active sites on the TiO2 surface which are essential for production of O2˙− rather than ˙OH. O2˙− is expected to result in selective oxidation owing to its suitable redox potential (0.89 V, vs. SHE). This system enhanced the selectivity towards value-added products from lignin, because it facilitated the generation of O2˙−. After 1 h solar light irradiation, the conversion efficiency of lignin was 84.5%, with 22.7% yield of guaiacol in the presence of Bi1%/Pt1%–TiO2.58 A commercial solution composed of TiO2 doped with AgCl was investigated for photocatalytic valorization of lignin in wheat straw. It was found that alkaline conditions are favourable for the total phenolic compound (TPC) production. A 24 h period of mixing in darkness exerted a positive effect for production of high-value aromatic compounds, enhancing the TPC yield to more than 80 mg TPC g−1 lignin. The production of TPC from lignocellulosic substrates is largely influenced by the pH and catalyst concentration. The usage of 5.5 g L−1 TiO2–AgCl under alkaline conditions boosted the TPC yield more than 13% within 2 h of irradiation.57 TiO2/lignin-based carbon composite photocatalysts were synthesized and used for the conversion of lignin to value-added chemicals.89 The catalyst prepared with a TiO2/lignin ratio of 1:0.5 was found to exhibit the best photocatalytic activity by increasing the lignin conversion efficiency up to 40.28% under UVA irradiation, and commodity chemicals, such as vanillin, were obtained after photocatalysis.

Silver-based photocatalysts were also developed. For example, a novel Ag3PO4/SnO2/porcine bone composite photocatalyst was prepared and it showed good activity in the conversion of lignosulfonate to small molecules (Table 3) upon exposure to visible light at ambient temperature and pressure.67
Photocatalysis has also been integrated with biocatalytic, mechanical, chemical and electrochemical methods to enhance the conversion efficiency of lignin. For instance, photocatalytic processes (TiO2/UV) and biocatalytic processes (laccase) were coupled together to degrade high-molecular-weight lignin. The dual-step process with successive photocatalysis and laccase treatment demonstrated outstanding performance.90 A significant quantity of succinic and malonic acids could be produced in the TiO2/UV system in the presence of H2O2, which could also produce a variety of useful chemicals. Li et al. demonstrated the feasibility of using Ag–AgCl/ZnO to degrade lignin under natural solar light.68 Then the degraded lignin solution was used for methane production by anaerobic digestion, with the solution obtained from 120 min photocatalysis yielding 184 ml methane and 325 ml biogas per gram of removed total organic carbon, which indicate an increase by 10.9% and 23.1%, respectively, compared to the control.
Ball milling of lignin and TiO2 mixtures followed by UV radiation was applied for the photocatalytic conversion of lignin to valuable phenolics and aromatic hydrocarbons. Ball milled mixtures obtained using acetone and water resulted in a high yield of phenolic compounds after 3–4 hours of UV exposure, as wet milling facilitated the intimate interactions between lignin and nano-TiO2.47 Lignin was firstly treated by organosolv pulping or [Bmim][MeSO4] pulping methods, and then photocatalytic cracking using TiO2 as a heterogeneous catalyst under UV light for different periods of time. Organosolv liquor treated by photocatalysis manifested considerably enhanced performance. The illumination time has a great effect on the biomass degradation products. As observed from the degradation of pulping lignin, 1 h of exposure time to UV light irradiation shows the highest yields of aromatic products.91 The obtained principal compounds are syringaldehyde, pyrocatechol and raspberry ketone.
Lignin modification and oxidation were conducted using the integration of the photochemical and electrochemical oxidation methods, where a Ta2O5–IrO2 thin film was used as the electrocatalyst and TiO2 nanotube arrays were used as the photocatalyst.92 When the photocatalyst and electrocatalyst were combined, not only the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes on the photocatalyst face was suppressed, but also the electrochemical oxidation on the electrocatalyst was driven. Thus, a strong synergistic effect is observed for lignin oxidation, and the combination is much more efficient than either method alone. As depicted in Fig. 3a the lignin solution became light with the prolonged oxidation time, indicating that lignin was being oxidized. The precipitated lignin was obtained by acidifying the lignin solutions with HCl to pH = ∼3. The remaining lignin was gradually consumed with the increase of the oxidation time (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3d presents the results of intermediates; the two primary intermediates were vanillin and vanillic acid which are of great interest to the industrial production of food, aromas and perfumes.

As shown in Fig. 4, it can be concluded that the photocatalytic products of lignin are mainly aromatic compounds, which can be categorized as phenolics such as vanillin and 4-hydroxyl-3-methoxy acetophenone, aromatics including styrene and ethyl benzene, aromatic acids, lignin monomeric units syringaldehyde and acetosyringone, and the deeper oxidation product of quinone. Cleavage of C–C bonds, β-O-4 linkages and other ether linkages of lignin results in the formation of these main lignin degradation products. These aromatic compounds have important applications in a large number of industries, including the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, paper and polymer industries etc. (Table S1†).

Lignin received relatively little attention as a photocatalytic substrate for hydrogen production.41 Previous publications on photoconversion of lignin to H2 mainly focused on the exploration of transition metal sulphides as photocatalysts. The activity of NiS/CdS with 20 mol% of NiS loading, in the coexistence of lactic acid and lignin as hole scavengers, is 5041 times that of pristine CdS, with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 44.9% for H2 generation. Thus, in this process, more hydrogen can be produced using one-dimensional (1D) NiS/CdS nanocomposites as the photocatalyst. The enhanced performance is due to the prolonged average charge carrier lifetime improved by a 0.2 molar ratio of NiS, which is 97 times that of CdS NWs.64 A C, N and S-co-doped mixed phase ZnO/ZnS nanostructure (sample S1) was synthesized by thermal decomposition of a bis-thiourea zinc acetate (BTZA) complex at 500 °C, and further calcination at 600 °C yielded the N and S-doped ZnO (sample S3).93 Sample S1 shows superior activity for both H2 production (580 and 558 mmol h−1) via water splitting and the complete degradation of lignin under visible light. This is due to its novel characteristics such as a narrow band gap of 2.83 eV. In contrast, the sample S3 attains less lignin degradation but higher activity for H2 production (643 and 602 mmol h−1).
4. Photocatalytic conversion of cellulose and its derivatives
4.1 Photocatalytic conversion of cellulose
Different photocatalytic processes for the conversion of cellulose are shown in Table 4. Photocatalysis driven acid hydrolysis of cellulose is an efficient method for cellulose depolymerization. When acid-catalytic hydrolysis of cellulose was conducted under light irradiation, the temperature ranges from 353 to 413 K, shown in Table 4. This indicates that when conducting the hydrolysis of cellulose under light irradiation, the reaction temperature can be lower than those of acid-hydrolysis processes (373–533 K).10

Photocatalysis driven cellulose to glucose conversion is the first step for producing hydrogen on metal (e.g. Pt) loaded TiO2.98 However, cellulose hydrolysis hardly occurred in pure water even under photocatalysis, which inevitably limits the conversion of cellulose due to the strict pH requirement. A simple and highly efficient one-pot process combining photocatalysis and acid hydrolysis was firstly reported to solve problems in cellulosic biomass conversion.28 Specifically, photocatalytic reforming of cellulose to hydrogen was accomplished by hydrolysis of cellulose in 0.6 M sulfuric acid solution at 403 K in the presence of a photocatalyst (e.g. platinized TiO2) under UV-vis light irradiation. The photocatalytic H2 production is promoted by in situ generation of electron donors from direct conversion of cellulose, as the generated carbohydrates are very effective electron donors due to their low oxidation potentials.
Considering that the drawbacks such as reactor corrosion and waste disposal significantly limit the practical applications of using a homogeneous acid, solid acid catalysts are studied as the substrate of photocatalysts. Solid acid catalysts, such as metal oxides, metal phosphates, polymer-based acid resins, sulphonated carbonaceous acids, heteropoly acids, and H-form zeolites, normally carry a high concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites. These solid acid catalysts possess a high affinity to the poly-saccharide structure, suitable for cellulose hydrolysis.99 Therefore, plasmonic metals such as Au and Ir were deposited on H-form zeolites to enhance cellulose hydrolysis under visible light irradiation, combining the photothermal effect of plasmonic metals and the acid effect of H-form zeolites.27,29 For example, the cleavage of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds of cellobiose on an Ir/HY catalyst has been reported, with high activity and selectivity (>99%) under visible light illumination at temperature not exceeding 100 °C. The hydrolysis of cellobiose under mild conditions is attributed to the synergistic effect between the photothermal plasmonic behaviour of Ir nanoparticles and acid catalysis of the HY zeolite. The hydrolysis products are glucose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).27 There are several HY zeolites used including HY (Si/Al = 7), HY2 (Si/Al = 5.2), and HY3 (Si/Al = 11). Amberlyst-15 resin is a commercial solid acid. For HY zeolites with different Si/Al ratios, when the Si/Al ratios of HY zeolites are increased, the activity is enhanced in the dark, which is well correlated with the acid density of the supports.
The photocatalysis-driven hydrolysis of non-pretreated crystalline cellulose was also investigated using Ir/HY3 and Ir/Amberlsyt-15 as catalysts (Table S2†). The main products are cellobiose, glucose and HMF. In the dark, the Ir/HY3 catalyst only shows a low activity (8.4% yield of total products) at 90 °C, and the main product is cellobiose. With visible light illumination, the yield of total products promptly increases to 75.3%. Ir/Amberlyst-15 resin gives 72.6% yield of total products at 70 °C under visible light irradiation. The photothermal effect of Ir nanoparticles (NPs) dramatically increases the catalyst temperature, thus accelerating the catalytic hydrolysis of cellobiose. A new plasmonic nanostructure composed of TiO2 nanofibre (NF) supported H-form Y-zeolites (HY) decorated with Au-NPs (Au-HYT) was used for the photocatalytic hydrolysis of cellulose.29 Under mild conditions, the yield of glucose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was more than 60% at 130 °C for 24 h. Both the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Au-NPs and the acid strength of HY contribute a lot to the cellulose conversion process.
Modification of a photocatalyst with acid groups was another method to obtain a photocatalyst with acid sites. Hao et al. prepared modified TiO2 with nickel sulfide (NixSy) and chemisorbed sulfate (P25-S-Ni) in one step and studied its application in the photoreforming of cellulose to H2 in neutral water. A significant elevation in H2 yield was achieved with the optimum modified TiO2 which is almost 76-fold higher than that with P25.30 The authors inferred that NixSy acted as a cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production, and SO42− ions promoted cellulose hydrolysis, consequently enhancing the accessibility of biomass to the catalysts (Fig. 5).

Immobilizing cellulose particles onto photocatalysts would substantially enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. Immobilization of cellulose may lead to the formation of a ligand-to-metal-charge-transfer complex (LMCT) which allows electrons to be injected directly on the conduction band of the photocatalyst. For example, the CdS/regenerated cellulose (CdS/RC) nanocomposite films exhibited obvious predominance, in comparison with a CdS nanoparticle suspension.94 A high photocatalytic H2 production rate of about 1.323 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible-light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) was attained over the Pt-loaded CdS/RC nanocomposite film. It is mainly due to the efficient light absorption, fast charge carrier transfer, and photochemical reactions between the loaded CdS nanoparticles and electrolyte interfaces. A TiO2(Pt) photocatalyst immobilized with cellulose was prepared based on a facile “mixing and drying” immobilization procedure.95 The hybrid/cellulose system shows better photocatalytic performance than bare TiO2(Pt) for conversion of cellulose to sugars and carbon dioxide, with simultaneous production of hydrogen under UV or solar light irradiation. This approach enables the production of hydrogen from water without using valuable sacrificial agents and provides the possibility of recovering sugars as liquid fuels.
As shown in Fig. 6, photocatalytic cellulose hydrolysis can be integrated with H2 evolution from water splitting. This process can significantly boost H2 production and simultaneously yield valuable organic products. Cellulose and the produced glucose act as scavengers for the VB holes and/or the ˙OH and O2 produced by cleavage of water. This helps suppress the charge carrier recombination and/or O2–H2 back reaction, providing electrons to the TiO2 CB or directly to the Pt islands on the catalyst surface for the production of H2. The polysaccharide depolymerisation generates valuable intermediates, among which 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was identified.96 The procedure is evaluated and successfully extended to cellulosic biomass, i.e. rice husk and alfalfa stems.

Zhang et al. demonstrated the feasibility of producing hydrogen directly from biomass by a single photocatalytic process.97 Graphitic carbon layer grafted TiO2/NiOx nanoparticles exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for cellulose conversion to H2. When TiO2 is illuminated by a photon with energy higher than its band gap energy, photo-excited electrons transfer from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to the deposited NiOx, resulting in reduced Ni. A proton abstracted from the –OH group of the alcohol adsorbed on the Ni surface is reduced by the electron, obtaining a Ni–H hydride and an alkoxide anion. Subsequently, two Ni–H hydrides afford one molecule of hydrogen. The carbon overlayer may play an important role in the H2 evolution process by weakening the interaction between H and the underlying Ni metal surface. The hydrogen production increased with an increase in the reaction temperature in the order of 25 °C < 60 °C < 80 °C (Table 4), with a maximum hydrogen production rate of 82.9 μmol h−1 at 80 °C which was more than one order of magnitude of 5.4 μmol h−1 at 25 °C. The reason may be that a higher temperature is favorable for dissolving a portion of the suspended carbohydrate fragments formed, providing solvated cellulose as a substrate for photocatalysis which can be oxidized more rapidly.
4.2 Photocatalytic conversion of glucose
Glucose is one of the main products of photosynthesis in plants. It is the cheapest monosaccharide in nature among the hexose sugars (i.e., glucose, fructose and galactose), which can be directly obtained by hydrolysis of cellulose. TiO2-based photocatalysts are widely used for the photoconversion of glucose to various valuable chemicals, as shown in Table 5. TiO2 in different phases was used for the photocatalytic oxidation of glucose. Anatase, rutile and P-25 exhibited quite different selectivities towards organic compounds (mainly glucaric acid, gluconic acid and arabitol), and among them anatase showed the best selectivity.49 Moreover, elaborately controlling the anatase–rutile phase junction structure is beneficial for electron–hole separation. The phase junctions may facilitate transfer of the photogenerated electron from the conduction band of the rutile phase to the trapping sites on the anatase surface, thereby improving the charge-separation efficiency and enhancing the photocatalytic activity, consequently enhancing the performance of Pt/P25 for glucose reforming.50 TiO2 supported on zeolite Y was used for the selective oxidation of glucose in a 1:1 water–acetonitrile solution under UV irradiation. After 10 min illumination, glucaric acid (GUA) and gluconic acid (GA) were obtained with a total selectivity of 68%.100

The visible-light photo-conversion of glucose over unmodified titania was achieved through the formation of a metal–organic complex by glucose and TiO2. The presence of the ligand-to-metal-charge-transfer complex (LMCT) is responsible for the visible light absorption ability of TiO2, as it allows electrons to be injected directly from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of glucose to the conduction band of TiO2. Optimization of the reaction conditions resulted in 42% glucose conversion under visible light with 7% selectivity to gluconic acid and 93% selectivity to other partial oxidation products. Meanwhile, the mineralization pathway to CO2 was completely suppressed. Higher conversion efficiency could be achieved under UV light irradiation; however, this process suffered from substantial mineralization through an unselective way. This demonstrated the crucial role of the adsorption–desorption mechanisms in photocatalytic reactions which are sometimes overlooked.101
A TiO2-based photocatalyst was used for the photocatalytic conversion of aqueous glucose to value-added chemicals arabinose and erythrose with H2 as the by-product.102 It has been proposed for the first time that the photodegradation of glucose initially involves C1–C2 bond cleavage (α-scission) to produce arabinose in aqueous solution. Anatase (TiO2-A), rutile (TiO2-R) and commercial P25 were compared, and TiO2-R showed the highest activity and highest total selectivity of 91% for arabinose and erythrose at 65% conversion. EPR results indicate that the selectivity of the products is mainly dependent on the reactive oxygen species (ROS). The hydroxyl radicals may lead to low selectivity, while the peroxy species lead to a high selectivity.
The solvent plays an important role in the selectivity of photocatalytic reaction products. Powdered TiO2 prepared by an ultrasound-promoted sol–gel method was used for the photocatalytic oxidation of glucose. When the reaction was conducted in water, the highest level of glucose mineralization was observed. However, when the reaction was conducted in 50%H2O/50%ACN, the best selectivity towards carboxylic acids of 71.3% was achieved.49 The high selectivity could be due to a lower concentration of highly oxidative ˙OH caused by a lower amount of water and lower affinity of acids on the catalyst surface in the presence of acetonitrile. Nano-TiO2 has been reported for the efficient photocatalytic oxidation of glucose to formate under mild conditions. A 35% yield of formate and high conversion of glucose up to 100% was achieved at 25 °C in 0.03 M NaOH solution. The conversion of glucose into formic acid occurs mainly because hydroxyl ions can accelerate the utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes for the formation of active oxidative radicals (O2˙−, ˙OH), meanwhile the charge of the TiO2 surface is adjusted by hydroxyl ions, controlling the adsorption of glucose and the desorption of formic acid.103
The photocatalyst morphology is found to be an important factor influencing its activity. Accumulation of electrons and holes on different facets seems to be a fancy electron–hole separation approach. Zhang et al. have synthesized a multifaceted Cu2O with controlled crystal facet exposure via a facile one-step method and have studied its photocatalytic reforming properties of glucose under visible light. Efficient charge separation and enhanced photocatalytic reforming of glucose were achieved on Cu2O, because photo-generated electrons prefer to accumulate on high-index planes, while holes tend to migrate to the {100} facet of the Cu2O polyhedron.104
Hydrogen was produced by the photocatalytic degradation of glucose over a Ru-doped LaFeO3 photocatalyst under UV or visible light irradiation.105 Ru existed in the form of Ru3+ in the crystalline structure of LaFeO3 and acted as an electron scavenger preventing the electron–hole recombination. Thus Ru-doped LaFeO3 exhibited better photocatalytic performance than bare LaFeO3.
4.3 Photocatalytic conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)
HMF is derived from the depolymerisation of C6 monosaccharides, and is a key intermediate in cellulosic biomass conversion and an important industrial and pharmaceutical chemical. 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), which can be obtained from the oxidation of HMF, is an important monomer for the production of numerous polymers. Various photocatalysts were studied for the photoreforming of HMF, and it is transformed to its corresponding aldehydes and acids, with medium to high selectivity, as shown in Table 6.

Ethanol, glucose, xylose, HMF and furfural alcohol can be selectively oxidized to the corresponding carboxyl compounds using oxygen as the oxidant and Au NPs/TiO2 as the photocatalyst under both UV and visible light irradiation in Na2CO3 aqueous solution.106 For HMF, the aldehyde group was preferentially oxidized to produce 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furan-carboxylic acid (HMFCA) with a high selectivity of 95% and conversion efficiency of >99%. A kinetics experiment indicated that the hydroxyl group could be further oxidized to yield FDCA. Na2CO3 acts as an inhibitor of ROS (e.g. ˙OH and 1O2) under UV light. Thus, the addition of Na2CO3 could enhance the selectivity of the desired products under UV light because ˙OH and 1O2 lead to the deep oxidation of substrates. For the visible-light-induced oxidation, Na2CO3 behaves as an effective promoter for the reaction. Generally speaking, a basic environment is favourable for achieving high activity and selectivity under both UV and visible light.
Ultrathin CdS nanosheets (thickness ∼1 nm) decorated with a cocatalyst of Ni as Ni/CdS nanocomposites (shown in Fig. 7) are able to transform biomass-derived compounds (i.e., furfural alcohol and HMF) to their corresponding aldehydes effectively in neutral water upon visible light irradiation with simultaneous H2 production. Under alkaline conditions, both furfural alcohol and HMF were completely transformed to the respective carboxylates with concomitant production of H2. Desirable products, either aldehydes or acids, can be achieved selectively by tuning the catalyst and reaction conditions, which represents a great advantage.46

A metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) catalyst synthesized by simple calcination of melamine was applied in the photocatalytic selective oxidation of HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF).70 Under the irradiation of visible light with wavelength >400 nm, an HMF conversion rate of 31.2% can be achieved in the presence of O2 with the highest DFF selectivity of 85.6%.
A P doped ZnxCd1−xS solid catalyst exhibited better photocatalytic activity for water spitting than ZnS–P and CdS–P. Zn0.5Cd0.5S–P shows a maximum H2 evolution rate of 419 μmol h−1 g−1. Coupled photocatalytic oxidation of HMF can further speed up water splitting with the H2 evolution rate increasing to 786 μmol h−1 g−1, with HMF oxidized to DFF in the meantime.65
Bimetallic Au–Ru nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxides (Au–Ru/rGO) exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties for both the partial oxidation of HMF to DFF and one-pot conversion of fructose to DFF in the absence of any bases, with the yield of DFF reaching 91% and 86%, respectively. The better photocatalytic activity of bimetallic Au–Ru/rGO than that of a monometallic Au or Ru catalyst is due to the transfer of photo-excited electrons from Ru to Au nanoparticles through the conductive graphene support.107
A photochemical cell (PEC) with HMF oxidation as the anode reaction was constructed (Fig. 8). 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) was used as the mediator to perform the photoelectrochemical oxidation of HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). In this cell, an n-type nanoporous BiVO4 electrode was used as a photoanode, and the photogenerated holes in the VB of BiVO4 were responsible for TEMPO-mediated HMF oxidation. The high faradaic efficiency achieved for FDCA formation indicates that TEMPO oxidation is kinetically much more favourable than water oxidation. These results confirm that the TEMPO-mediated oxidation of HMF can be a viable anode reaction which has potential to increase both the efficiency and the utility of PECs. Based on these encouraging results, more diverse biomass conversion and organic synthesis reactions should be investigated as anode reactions in PECs.108

Fig. 9 displays the conclusion of the photocatalytic conversion process of cellulose, mainly including hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose, the subsequent oxidation of glucose into smaller organics such as arabinose, xylose, formic acid, and HMF, and HMF converting to its corresponding aldehydes and acids. Moreover, cellulose and its derivatives can serve as sacrificial agents (electron donors) to reduce the photocatalyst recombination e−–h+ rate to obtain H2 from the water splitting process.109

5. Photocatalytic conversion of native lignocellulosic biomass
Despite a lot of work on each structural component of lignocellulose, more efforts have to be devoted to native lignocellulose to enhance the profitability and sustainability of biomass photocatalysis. There are still many issues to be resolved to utilize lignocellulose efficiently. The fractionation of lignocellulose remains challenging and the lack of effective contacts between the solid catalyst and the solid biomass remains an issue. Up to now a handful of studies have been carried out on the photoreforming of lignocellulose to valuable chemicals and fuels (Table 7) and new solutions have been proposed to deal with the existing problems.

Wakerley et al. reported the light-driven solar valorization of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin to H2 using semiconducting cadmium sulfide quantum dots (QDs) in alkaline aqueous solution.45 Basic conditions promote the in situ formation of Cd(OH)2/CdO (henceforth CdOx) on the CdS surface. This could impressively improve their photocatalytic performance because the resultant CdS/CdOx QDs are more resistant to photocorrosion. In addition, the alkaline conditions facilitate the dissolving of hemicellulose, lignin, cellulose and other saccharides into solution, making them more available to the photocatalytic process. Native lignocellulose can be reformed to H2 (Fig. 10) at room temperature under visible light irradiation and catalysed by CdS/CdOx QDs. In this process, lignocellulose adopts the role of a hole scavenger to provide a continuous supply of electrons for hydrogen production. The products from α-cellulose oxidation were identified by 13C-NMR spectroscopy using uniformly 13C-labelled cellulose. Polymeric carboxylic acid and formate were produced as the major intermediates. Both the decarboxylation of carboxylic acids and oxidation of formate can produce CO2, which is converted to CO32− by the alkaline solution. The system's tolerance to a range of substrates is particularly appealing for H2 generation without the need for lignocellulose processing.
 Fig. 10  Photoreforming of lignocellulose to H2 on CdS/CdOx: a, lignocellulose exists as microfibrils in plant cell walls and comprises cellulose surrounded by the less crystalline polymers hemicellulose and lignin; b, these components can be photoreformed into H2 using semiconducting CdS coated with CdOx (the CdOx surface is believed to contain some –OH functionality, but H atoms have been removed in the illustration for clarity). Light absorption by CdS generates electrons and holes, which travel to the CdOx surface and undertake proton reduction and lignocellulose oxidation, respectively; and c, this combination creates a highly robust photocatalyst able to generate H2 from crude sources of lignocellulose when suspended in alkaline solution and irradiated with sunlight.

CdS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized and they showed excellent activities for photoconversion of lignocellulosic biomass, as the colloidal character of QDs allows intimate interactions with the solid biomass substrate. Wu et al. found that cadmium sulfide QDs not only catalysed the cleavage of β-O-4 bonds in lignin models quantitatively but also efficiently converted native lignin within biomass into functionalized aromatics under visible light, while cellulose/hemicellulose can survive after the photocatalytic transformation of lignin.32 The efficient cleavage of β-O-4 bonds in native lignin is the core of the present approach. Both experimental and computational results reveal an electron–hole coupled (EHCO) mechanism via a Cα radical intermediate of the selective photocatalytic cleavage of the β-O-4 bond at room temperature. The bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the β-O-4 bond decreases from 55 to 7.8 kal mol−1 in the Cα radical intermediate, which is the key reason for the high activity and selectivity of this system. Fig. 11 displays the valorization of the entire lignocellulose. The contents of xylans and glucans were 18 wt% and 43 wt% (Fig. 11b), respectively, corresponding to 90% and 98% of those in the original birch woodmeal. This indicates that hemicellulose and cellulose remain almost intact after photocatalytic conversion of native lignin in birch woodmeal. The catalytic transformations of the solid residue containing hemicellulose and cellulose were performed. After separation with the re-colloidized CdS QDs, the solid residue (fraction I) was first subjected to acidolysis under mild conditions. Xylose with a yield of 84% was obtained (Fig. 11c). Afterwards, enzymatic hydrolysis was performed for digesting the remaining solid (fraction II). Glucose with a yield of 91% was obtained (Fig. 11c).

Activated cyanamide-functionalized carbon nitride (NCNCNx) upon ultrasonication has been reported to demonstrate siginificant activities for the visible-light driven conversion of purified and raw lignocellulose samples (e.g. sawdust and bagasse) into H2 in the presence of various proton reduction cocatalysts (Fig. 12). This room-temperature photoreforming process operates under benign aqueous conditions (pH ≈ 2–15) without the use of toxic materials.69 Compared with bulk NCNCNx, activated NCNCNx shows a significantly enhanced light absorption capacity, higher surface area, and faster discharging behavior which allow the cocatalyst to access electrons stored in CNx more easily, thus exhibiting higher photocatalytic activity. The conversion yields determined with different α-cellulose loadings indicate that 22% conversion can be reached, more than twice the yield with CdS/CdOx quantum dots under similar conditions (9.7%).45

Rice husk can be photocatalytically depolymerized over TiO2 in H2O2 aqueous solution under ultraviolet light irradiation.110 As shown in Fig. 13, the resulting soluble organic species can be classified into products including alkanes, alkenes, arenes, alkenols, phenols, ketones, alkanoates, phthalates, non-substituted alkanols (NSAs), substituted alkanols (SAs), benzaldehydes (BAs), carboxylic acids (CAs), nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NCOCs), sulfur-containing organic compounds (SCOCs) and other species (OSs). The predominant products are alkanes, phthalates, ketones and carboxylic acids with relatively abundant quantities. Alkanes resulted from the degradation of waxes in rice husk. Most of the aldehydes and ketones were derived from cellulose, hemicellulose and waxes. Phthalates and arenes resulted from lignin degradation.

Pretreatment of rice straw with NaOH solution assisted with photocatalysis could degrade more of the alkali-soluble lignin and hemicellulose, and make the cellulose fraction more vulnerable to enzyme hydrolysis.111 The enzymatic hydrolysis rate of the straw pretreated using this procedure was 2.56 times higher than that of the straw treated only with the alkali.
Recent studies focus more on the conversion of lignin model compounds, glucose and HMF. The structures of these compounds are much simpler than that of the native lignocellulosic biomass. There are several challenges in direct conversion of native lignocellulosic biomass (Scheme 5 and Table 7). Firstly, due to the insolubility of lignocellulose and the ineffective contacts between the solid catalyst and biomass, the photoconversion of lignocellulose is more difficult than that of model compounds. Harsh reaction conditions, such as basic solution, are required to solubilize the lignocellulose (Table 7, entry 1), which would compromise the greenness of the overall process to some extent. Secondly, if all the three components in the lignocellulosic biomass are simultaneously converted, the products cannot be easily separated (Table 7, entry 4).110 Thirdly, biorefinery processes generally utilize carbohydrates and lignin separately,112 whereas the rigid association of cellulose with lignin makes the separation process more complicated. Wu et al. provide a facile method to overcome the insolubility problems of lignocellulosic biomass.32 This lignin-first method can efficiently convert native lignin in birch woodmeal at room temperature. Meanwhile, hemicellulose and cellulose can survive after the photocatalytic conversion of lignin. The photocatalysts of CdS QDs used in this method were functionalized with a ligand of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) (Table 7, entry 2), which affords the QDs high dispersity in aqueous solution. Homogeneous catalysts are capable of penetrating into the specific linkages of lignocellulose. After photocatalysis, the CdS-MPA could be aggregated and re-dispersed in aqueous solution. The activity of the passivated catalyst can be recovered by the reversible aggregation–colloidization strategy in multiple runs. In addition, the development of a photocatalytic system for biomass depolymerization in a continuous microreactor may be a promising approach for the generation of valuable products. For more details about this topic, please refer to an existing tutorial review.113

6. Innovative photocatalytic conversion process of biomass
Solar induced fuel cells offer an attractive way to simultaneously convert biomass and solar energy to electricity.114 Photo-fuel-cells (PFCs) comprising a photoanode for biomass oxidation and a cathode for oxygen reduction are unique photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices to directly convert the two most abundant renewable resources into electricity output.115 Zhang et al. built a membrane-free PFC based on a dual-electrode configuration, including a tungsten(W)-doped BiVO4 photoanode and polyterthiophene photocathode for solar-stimulated biomass-to-electricity conversion.116 This PFC uses dissolved O2 in the air and water-soluble biomass derivatives such as glucose as the reagents, obtaining a maximum power density of 82 μW cm−2. Moreover, the PFC shows excellent sustainability during a long-term discharging test of up to 20 h.
Liu et al. demonstrated the feasibility of biomass in a solar-induced hybrid fuel cell using a polyoxometalate (POM) photocatalyst. Natural polymeric biomass, such as starch, cellulose, lignin and even switchgrass and wood powders, can power this process. This hybrid cell has advantages of being inert to most organic and inorganic contaminants present in the fuels. The power density of this solar-induced hybrid fuel can reach 0.72 mW cm−2 when cellulose is used as the fuel, which is almost 100 times higher than that of cellulose-based microbial fuel cells.42 Liu and his workmates had tried sugars thereafter and reported the highest power density reaching 45 mW cm−2.117 As shown in Fig. 14a, the hybrid fuel cell consists of a solar panel, a redox flow cell, and a catholyte regeneration tank. The whole reaction for this hybrid solar biomass fuel cell is sugar oxidation with O2 to CO2 and degradation compounds, as shown in Fig. 14b. The electricity generation is realized by discharging reduced POM-I on the anode and POM-II on the cathode. Under light irradiation or heating, POM-I can capture the electrons from sugar and be stored in the reduced state, which is based on the valence change from Mo6+ to Mo5+.

Shewa et al. reported another process to produce electricity from biomass. Photocatalysis of lignin is followed by microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to generate electricity.118 Pretreatment of lignosulfonate was performed using TiO2-UV photocatalysis. The pretreated lignosulfonate fed MFCs, operated at 37 ± 1 °C, generated the maximum current and power densities of 6556 ± 360 mA m−3 and 1881 ± 103 mW m−3, respectively.
7. Conclusions and perspectives
Photocatalysis is a promising strategy to convert renewable lignocellulosic biomass and solar energy into fuels and chemicals.33 This review summarized the state-of-the-art accomplishments in photocatalytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass and its derivatives, focusing on selective cleavage of dominant bonds of lignin, valorization of processed and native lignin, photoreforming reactions of cellulose and its intermediates, and the depolymerization of robust native lignocellulose under visible or UVA light irradiation, as well as the innovative lignocellulosic biomass transformation process for producing electricity. The information in this review is expected to provide useful guidance to facilitate the further development of these promising processes.
However, photocatalytic wet reforming of biomass is still in the early-stage research, and most of the present investigations are largely performed in a laboratory scale.119 There are some critical issues which should be addressed in the future. Firstly, efficient photocatalytic methods are needed to directly convert biomass in green media under solar light irradiation.31 To this end, researchers should explore more noble metal-free photocatalysts with high activity, good stability and recoverability from the system.
Secondly, future efforts should be shifted to complex raw biomass. The photocatalytic processes of native lignocellulosic biomass, lignin and cellulose are more complicated than those of model compounds. In addition, lignocellulose fractionation is a difficult process, which would increase the cost of utilizing native lignocellulosic feedstock.21 Thus, finding ways to selectively convert native biomass into the desired products with high quality and suppress the formation of undesired products (e.g., CO2 and water) remains a big challenge.
Thirdly, detailed information regarding the mechanism of native lignocellulosic biomass conversion is still lacking, which is mainly rooted in the complex composition of the native lignocellulose and the properties of photocatalysts. Accurate characterization and detection technologies would be required to help deeply elucidate the potential mechanism of this process. For example, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) can be used to trace surface-bound radicals generated on the sub-ns timescale.41 DFT calculations can also help understand the reaction mechanism of biomass photocatalysis.40
Last but not least, subsequent separation and purification of the valuable products from the reaction medium are rather difficult, which is still an issue to be resolved for practical applications. A photocatalytic process which can separately transform lignin and carbohydrate fractions120 would separate aromatic products and carbohydrate products in the reforming stage and ease the subsequent separation burden.
Considering the recalcitrant structure of native lignocellulosic biomass, future work should also be devoted to tackling the problems of biomass utilization from a multidisciplinary point of view through integrating photocatalysis with other physical, chemical or biological approaches effectively.121,122

 	Fig. 10  Photoreforming of lignocellulose to H2 on CdS/CdOx: a, lignocellulose exists as microfibrils in plant cell walls and comprises cellulose surrounded by the less crystalline polymers hemicellulose and lignin; b, these components can be photoreformed into H2 using semiconducting CdS coated with CdOx (the CdOx surface is believed to contain some –OH functionality, but H atoms have been removed in the illustration for clarity). Light absorption by CdS generates electrons and holes, which travel to the CdOx surface and undertake proton reduction and lignocellulose oxidation, respectively; and c, this combination creates a highly robust photocatalyst able to generate H2 from crude sources of lignocellulose when suspended in alkaline solution and irradiated with sunlight.
