    , Accepted 23rd October 2018First published on 23rd October 2018AbstractDue to the photoinstability and large hysteresis of the TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the search for novel electron transport materials has emerged. Herein, using first principles calculations, we unveiled the key factor for the ideal band alignment between La-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) and methyl ammonium (MA) lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3). The (PbI2-, MAI-terminated)CH3NH3PbI3/(SnO2-, BaO-terminated)LaxBa(1−x)SnO3 interface formed a stable “all-perovskite” heterostructure with large binding energy. The selective band alignment of the conduction band was easily manipulated by La-doping on the Ba site due to the band gap renormalization (or shrinkage) caused by doped electrons and La3+ dopant. In addition, the MAI-terminated MAPbI3/LBSO interface exhibited proton transfer (BaO-terminated) and strong hydrogen bonding (SnO2-terminated) between MA and oxygen anion. LBSO presenting high mobility, photostability, and structural stability would help develop the next generation ETL materials for PSCs.
Introduction
Solar energy is a highly efficient and eco-friendly source for future energy harvesting. In recent years, the development of inorganic/organic hybrid halide PSCs based on ABX3 (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+ (MA+), CHN2H4+ (FA+); B = Pb2+; X = Cl−, Br− or I−) has shown rapid progress to achieve over 23% (ref. 1) solar cell efficiency, and are considered to be the most promising large-scale thin-film solar energy materials.2 PSCs possess many interesting physical properties,3 including giant dielectric screening,4 bottleneck of hot phonon relaxation process,5 excitonic state,6 polaron state7,8 ideal band gap, mobility, defect tolerance,9,10 and optical absorbance.
TiO2 has been the most popular ETL material for PSC devices. Both anatase and rutile TiO2 have achieved high power conversion efficiency (PCE).11,12 However, the ultraviolet(UV)-induced photocatalysis of TiO2 has resulted in device degradation and gradual performance deterioration over a long UV exposure.13 Direct optical measurements have shown that the electron barrier of ∼0.1 eV may exist at the interface of MAPbI3/TiO2,14 and such a large electron barrier causes I–V hysteresis, possibly due to the accumulation of iodine defects at MAPbI3/TiO2.15–17 To overcome these obstacles, the development of efficient and stable next generation ETL materials is recently emerging.18 To date, metal oxide materials such as SnO2, ZnO, WO3, and ZnSnO4 have been highlighted as the next generation ETL.19
BaSnO3 (BSO) has been known as a wide indirect band gap (Eg > 3.1 eV) semiconductor20,21 with high electrical mobility21 of ∼300 cm2 V−1 s−1 and possible existence of a polaron state. Recently, the BSO thin film22 has achieved room temperature conductivity of over ∼104 S cm−1. The band gap (Eg) of BSO is easily tunable via chemical substitution with Pb, Bi or La.20 As proved by the hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiment,23 this band gap tuning can be explained by the band gap renormalization due to electrostatic interactions between the dopant cation (La3+) and extra free electrons in the conduction band.24 Therefore, rather than tuning the band gap of PSCs by A-site cation or halides substitutions, we can directly tune the band gap of ETL using BSO to achieve the optimal band alignment. We have shown that this scenario is also plausible at the interface of an LBSO slab, as evidenced by a large energy difference of ∼2–4 eV between the conduction band (Sn, O-s states) and La states (d states), which is consistent with the bulk LBSO case proven by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurement.23 However, LBSO film deposition on flexible or glass substrates is highly challenging because of the high crystallization temperature of the LBSO perovskite (>1000 °C).25 Recently, a new synthesis method for thin-film LBSO with crystallization temperature below 500 °C was discovered.26 The photostable 5 mol% LBSO used as ETL (MAPbI3/LBSO) has achieved PCE of over 22% with 1000 hours of illumination.26
In this study, using the density functional theory (DFT) at the PBE0 + spin–orbit coupling (SOC) + Grimme-D3 van der Waals level of theory, we unveiled that La-doping on BSO was the key factor for the optimal band alignment at the MAPbI3/LBSO interface. We found that though the terminations of both MAPbI3 and LBSO can affect the band alignment, the hybridization between two layers removed the dependency on the terminations. We also found that the calculated binding energies between LBSO and PSCs with various terminations were large enough to stabilize the interface.
Computational section
We used Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)27 for non-collinear DFT calculations using PBE0 functional plus Grimme DFT-D3 (ref. 28) van der Waals correction with inclusion of the dipole correction and the spin–orbit coupling by switching off any presumed symmetry. We employed the electrostatic potential of the solid to define the common vacuum level and to relate the calculation of PBE + SOC to that of PBE0 + SOC, which included the Hartree–Fock exchange. The reference electrostatic local potential only included the Hartree potential so that it is independent of the chosen exchange–correlation functionals.29,30
We employed a symmetric slab for BSO and MAPbI3 slabs. A supercell comprised 3 BSO layers (BaO-terminated and SnO2-terminated) and 3 layers of cubic MAPbI3 layers (MAI-terminated and PbI2-terminated) with (001) orientation for both, where the lattice mismatch using BSO(001)-(3 × 3) and MAPbI3(001)-(2 × 2) was as small as ∼1.0%. A vacuum size of ∼30 Å was included, which was as large as the size of the slab.
Results and discussion
We first investigated the electronic structures of bulk cubic MAPbI3 (Fig. 1a) and cubic BaSnO3 (Fig. 1b) perovskites using the PBE0 + SOC functional to correctly describe the experimental band gap of MAPbI3 (1.5–1.6 eV)31 and BSO (3.1–3.5 eV).20 Indeed, our calculation showed that PBE0 + SOC was the optimal choice, Eg,PBE0+SOC(MAPbI3) = 1.59 eV (Fig. 1a and S1a†) and Eg,PBE0+SOC(BSO) = 3.51 eV (Fig. 1b and S1b†). We found that the HSE06 + SOC functional rather underestimated the experimental band gap for both materials (Eg,HSE06+SOC(MAPbI3) = 1.03 eV and Eg,HSE06+SOC(BSO) = 2.79 eV). We also found that BSO's band gap was susceptible to the lattice constant a(BSO) (Fig. S1c†). Thus, we used a(BSO) = 4.09 Å, which was the experimental in-plane lattice constant of thin-film La-doped BaSnO3,23 and confirmed that the DFT band gap agreed with the experimental band gap.20 In contrast to MAPbI3, in which the conduction and valence energy levels significantly shifted, the shift in energy levels of the conduction and valence bands in BSO was almost negligible with the inclusion of SOC, ΔEg = 40 meV. In BSO, the conduction band minimum (CBM) was the bonding state between Sn s-orbital and O s-orbitals at Γ of BZ. VBM was the anti-bonding state of O p-orbitals at R of BZ (Fig. 1b and S1b†). For MAPbI3, the CBM states were |j = 1/2〉 and |j = 3/2〉 bonding states of Pb p-orbital and I s-orbital and the VBM state was |s = 1/2〉 anti-bonding state of I p-orbital and Pb s-orbital (Fig. 1a and S1a†).

The band level shift was only desirable in the conduction band, unless an elevated valence band level would allow hole carriers to transport and recombine with electron carriers in the ETL materials. Indeed, we noted that La-doping on BSO lowered the conduction band energy, leaving the valence band energy intact (Fig. 1c). Upon La-doping (x = 0, 3.7, 7.4, 11%), the band gap of LBSO decreased in the order Eg,x=0%(3.51 eV) > Eg,x=3.7%(2.91 eV) > Eg,x=7.4%(2.68 eV) > Eg,x=11.1%(2.55 eV) due to the electrostatic interaction between La3+ dopant and the electrons in the conduction band (Fig. 1d).20,21,23
In addition to the band gap renormalization, we studied various interfacial terminations between LBSO and MAPbI3. Because the work function, band gap and band alignment were significantly affected by the slab terminations, the study on various terminations were imperative for the thorough understanding of the interface. For MAPbI3, experiments and DFT studies showed that MAI termination was thermodynamically more stable than PbI2 termination.32 However, in the PbI2-rich condition the PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 surface could also form.33 A previous DFT study has revealed that the work function of MAI termination was ∼1 eV smaller than that of PbI2 termination, indicating that termination of the MAPbI3 slab played a crucial role in determining the work function and its band alignment.32 Along the (001) plane, the interface between BSO and MAPbI3 presents four possible morphologies: MAI-terminated MAPbI3 and SnO2-terminated BSO (MAI-SnO2) (Fig. 2a), MAI-terminated MAPbI3 and BaO-terminated BSO (MAI-BaO) (Fig. 2b), PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 and BaO-terminated BSO (PbI2–BaO) (Fig. 2c) and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 and SnO2-terminated BSO (PbI2–SnO2) (Fig. S2†). We investigated the minimum energy configurations of the interfaces and corresponding binding energies Eb. For the PbI2–SnO2 interface (Fig. S2a†), the interfacial PbI2 (in perovskite form) became unstable and formed PbO2 with oxygen anions of SnO2-terminated BSO. Thus, at the PbI2–SnO2 interface of MAPbI3/LBSO, the perovskite forms of both materials were deformed into plumbic oxide (Fig. S2a†). We found that this instability persisted when La was doped on BSO (Fig. S2b–d†). Apart from the PbI2–SnO2 interface, the binding energies per unit cell of MAPbI3/LBSO for all interfaces were strong (Eb(PbI2–BaO) = 4.38 eV per unit-cell, Eb(MAI–BaO) = 5.15 eV per unit-cell, and Eb(MAI–SnO2) = 4.49 eV per unit-cell, Table 1) and larger than those of PbI2- and MAI-terminated MAPbI3/TiO2 interfaces.34 The large binding energy indicated strong hybridization among the interfacial atoms. Therefore, we expect that LBSO presents superior carrier injection property for MAPbI3 compared with other ETL materials.

For MAI-terminations, the interaction between NH3 of MA+ and oxygen anion depended on the termination type of LBSO. At the SnO2-termination, the short strong hydrogen bonding (SSHB)35,36 between NH3 and O, where the hydrogen atom bounces back and forth between adjacent atoms, was present (Fig. S3a†). This is rather an expected phenomenon as SSHB was also found at the MAPbI3/TiO2 interface.34 The presence of such strong hydrogen bonding (HB) was crucial because it could further stabilize the interface and affect the energy levels between the interfaces. At the BaO-termination, we observed a proton transfer from an NH3 molecule to an oxygen anion (Fig. S3b†). We also found that a slight La-doping (x = 3.7%) on BSO hardly affected the optimized geometry (Fig. 2). The optimized geometries for further doping (x = 7.4, 11.0%) were almost the same with the pristine case (Fig. S4†).
Depending on the terminations of MAPbI3 and BSO (PbI2, MAI, SnO2 and BaO), the work function of the system would vary significantly. This dependency on the interfacial morphology could then impact the practical performance of PSCs. However, the strong hybridizations between adjacent interfaces rearranged the pristine electronic density and hence, the expected large dependency on the terminations was removed (Fig. S5†). From the density of states (DOS) of LBSO/MAPbI3 at the PBE level, we observed a sizable hybridization of interfacial atoms irrespective of the termination types (Fig. S5a–c†). We also noted that these hybridizations were formed between conduction and valence states of each adjacent layer (i.e. Sn(BSO) and I(MAPbI3) states) without impacting the band alignment. Though we observed the lowering of La levels (Fig. S6b and c†) compared with those in the bulk LBSO23 and MAI–SnO2 interface (Fig. S6a†), we emphasized that this was unrelated to the CBM energy level. Thus, the energy level shift caused by the induced dipole or the charge transfer will not be the dominant factor to describe the energy levels of LBSO/MAPbI3 partly because of its role in compensating the two levels' difference and partly because of the sizable hybridization.32 The charge transfer between two layers is not calculated because the PBE + SOC energy levels of both materials are not accurate enough. An accurate calculation of the charge transfer is only possible using the PBE0 + SOC + D3 calculation of the entire system, which is very demanding even for supercomputers.
Given that the hybridization was strong in MAPbI3/LBSO, it was crucial to check if this affected the electronic states of La and the conduction band minimum (Sn-s states). For instance, hybridization existing between two states would result in a significant modification on the conduction band's character and its energy levels. If this is true, then the assumed mechanism on the band gap renormalization would be incorrect. For instance, in conducting oxides, such as Sn-doped or Ge-doped In2O3,37 the dopant ion significantly modified the CBM state by orbital hybridization, giving rise to complex band gap modification. To confirm the mechanism, in which the coulombic interactions between La3+ dopant and free electrons of the conduction band lower the band edge energy, we checked the partial density of states (PDOS) of La in the slab (Fig. S6†). This mechanism had been verified already for the bulk in the previous experiment and DFT calculation.23 We observed that regardless of the termination type, the La d states did not hybridize with the Sn-s state at the interface. At x = 3.7%, the La d states were ∼4 eV (Fig. S6a;† MAI–SnO2) and ∼2 eV (Fig. S6b and c;† MAI–BaO and PbI2–BaO) above the CBM of LBSO. This was consistent with O K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum experiment where La dopant state solely hybridized with the O state at ∼4 eV above the conduction band.23 The result is also consistent for other La-doping concentrations. Even for a case where the La dopant was at the very surface of LBSO slab, we observed no hybridization between La and Sn states. Therefore, we concluded that the downshift of conduction band energy (band gap renormalization) was purely driven by the electrostatic interaction between La3+ dopant and Sn conduction band state, as evidenced by the negligible orbital hybridization between them (Fig. S6†).
To account for the energy levels of the LBSO/MAPbI3 interface, we corrected the PBE energy levels to PBE0 levels. These corrections are listed in Table S1.† Without La-doping, sizable electron barriers exist in all the three cases (0.4 eV (MAI–SnO2), 0.1 eV (MAI–BaO), and 0.45 eV (PbI2–BaO)), indicating that pristine BSO loses the open circuit voltage (Voc) and hence, it is not the ideal ETL for MAPbI3 (Fig. 3a and e). To investigate the effect of La-doping (x = 3.7, 4.7, and 11.1%) on the LBSO/MAPbI3 interface, we presented the results of MAI–SnO2- (Fig. 3b–d) and PbI2–BaO- (Fig. 3f–h) terminated interfaces. The MAI–BaO case is shown in Fig. S7.† Upon La-doping of x = 3.7%, only the conduction band level of LBSO lowers (Fig. 3b and f), and the band alignment between MAPbI3 and LBSO starts to be favorable for the electron transfer process i.e., the LBSO's conduction band level became lower than the MAPbI3's conduction band level. The energy shift was more pronounced for the further La-doping of x = 7.4 and 11% (Fig. 3c, d, g and h).
 Fig. 3  Partial density of states (PDOS) of the MAI–SnO2-terminated LaxB(1−x)SO/MAPbI3 (x = 0, 3.7, 7.4, 11.1%) interfaces with PBE0 + SOC + D3 corrections, where (a) x = 0%, (b) x = 3.7%, (c) x = 7.4%, (d) x = 11.1%. PDOS of PbI2–BaO-terminated LaxBa(1−x)SnO3/MAPbI3 with La-doping of (e) x = 0%, (f) x = 3.7%, (g) x = 7.4% and (h) x = 11.1%. The Fermi level (E − EF) is indicated as a gray dashed line. For clarity, we only plotted interfacial Pb s, p (red) and Sn s, p (blue) states, which were the main components of conduction and valence bands near EF. As the La-doping x increases, we note that the electron energy barrier between MAPbI3 and LBSO gradually decreases and is finally reversed. 
For all the three interfaces, the band alignments of band edge states with respect to the La-doping concentrations (x%) are summarized in Fig. 4. For the comparison, we set the vacuum level of the system to 0 eV. In all the cases, an unfavorable conduction band alignment between MAPbI3 and BSO can be overcome by a small amount of La-doping. Therefore, as a function of La-doping x, we would find the optimal band alignment between MAPbI3 and LBSO to maximize Voc and corresponding PCE of the device. Therefore, a further experimental study would be required to investigate the optimal La-doping range for achieving maximum photovoltaic efficiency in PSCs. In addition, the related phenomena, such as the hysteresis and the accumulation of defects at the interface of MAPbI3/LBSO as the function of La-doping will be fascinating subjects.

We have set the vacuum level to 0 eV. For all interface morphologies, the pristine BSO is not appropriate for ETL due to large electron barrier. La-doping lowers the conduction level of BSO, thereby letting electrons transport to the electrode. 
Conclusion
In summary, we investigated the interface between a novel ETL material of La-doped BaSnO3 and the cubic MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell using DFT with PBE0 + SOC + D3. We found that (001) MAPbI3/LBSO formed stable “all-perovskite” interfaces with large binding energy. Depending on the termination types, MA and O at the interface show SSHB and proton transfer. Because LBSO can tune the conduction band energy selectively via La-doping due to the conduction band renormalization, it enables the control of band level solely by La-doping without halide or organic cation substitutions on PSC materials. This demonstrates an advantage of LBSO over other ETL materials in addition to the appreciable photostability over the UV range. We expect that the development of novel ETL materials, including LBSO, would enable a further enhancement in the efficiency and the stability of the lead-halide-based PSC devices.

 	Fig. 1  Geometrical and electronic structures of MAPbI3 and La-doped BaSnO3, band gap renormalization upon La-doping and band alignment diagram between MAPbI3 and LBSO. (a) Cubic MAPbI3 perovskite crystal structure and PBE0 + SOC density of states (DOS). (b) Cubic BSO crystal structure and PBE0 + SOC DOS. (c) The PBE0 + SOC band gap change of LBSO with respect to La-doping concentration x = 0.0, 3.7, 7.4 and 11.1%. The local potential of each system has been set to E = 0 eV as a reference. (d) The schematic for the band alignment diagram between MAPbI3 and LxB(1−x)SO. Due to La-doping, the band gap of BSO Eg renormalized to Eg − Δ.	 

 	Fig. 2  Examples of all-perovskite heterostructures of LxB(1–x)SO/MAPbI3 (x = 0.0 and 3.7%). DFT optimized BSO/MAPbI3 interface of (a) MAI–SnO2, (b) MAI–BaO, (c) PbI2–BaO termination and LxB(1−x)SO/MAPbI3 (x = 3.7%) interface of (d) MAI–SnO2, (e) MAI–BaO, and (f) PbI2–BaO termination. [Pb(gray), I(purple), C(brown), N(light blue), Sn(silver), O(red), Ba(green), and La(cyan)]. The integrated local electrostatic potential profile along z-direction of MAI–SnO2 interface is shown. The kink appearing in the vacuum region indicates two different work functions of MAPbI3 and LxB(1−x)SO by the dipole corrections.	 

BSO	MAI–SnO2	1.53	4.49
MAI–BaO	—	5.15
PbI2–BaO	—	4.38
LBSO	MAI–SnO2	1.47	4.40
MAI–BaO	—	4.37
PbI2–BaO	—	4.87

 	Fig. 3  Partial density of states (PDOS) of the MAI–SnO2-terminated LaxB(1−x)SO/MAPbI3 (x = 0, 3.7, 7.4, 11.1%) interfaces with PBE0 + SOC + D3 corrections, where (a) x = 0%, (b) x = 3.7%, (c) x = 7.4%, (d) x = 11.1%. PDOS of PbI2–BaO-terminated LaxBa(1−x)SnO3/MAPbI3 with La-doping of (e) x = 0%, (f) x = 3.7%, (g) x = 7.4% and (h) x = 11.1%. The Fermi level (E − EF) is indicated as a gray dashed line. For clarity, we only plotted interfacial Pb s, p (red) and Sn s, p (blue) states, which were the main components of conduction and valence bands near EF. As the La-doping x increases, we note that the electron energy barrier between MAPbI3 and LBSO gradually decreases and is finally reversed.	 

 	Fig. 4  The band alignment of (a) MAI–SnO2, (b) MAI–BaO and (c) PbI2–BaO-terminated LBSO/MAPbI3 interfaces at PBE0 + SOC + D3 level of theory as a function of La-doping x (%). We have set the vacuum level to 0 eV. For all interface morphologies, the pristine BSO is not appropriate for ETL due to large electron barrier. La-doping lowers the conduction level of BSO, thereby letting electrons transport to the electrode.
