    , Accepted 2nd February 2022First published on 2nd February 2022AbstractTitanium electrodes, and general Ti oxide films, play an important role in state-of-the-art devices and technological developments. In this work, titanium oxide thin-films were prepared by electroformation on titanium substrates up to several anodic potential values in different electrolyte compositions. The analysis took into account the cathodic treatment applied in order to modify the thin-film electronic properties. The oxidation state of the surface of the electrodes at different depths was analyzed using the energy-dispersive inelastic X-ray scattering (EDIXS) technique under grazing incidence conditions. The measurements were carried out using monochromatic synchrotron radiation in a dedicated endstation. After RIXS spectra were treated by multivariate methods, the results indicate a well-defined distribution of titanium oxides in the (+3) state as compared to the standard (+4) state, in good agreement with predictions. In addition, this work demonstrates the capability of the GI-EDIXS technique to provide valuable information from nanolayers of technological materials for both industrial and scientific applications.
1. Introduction
Titanium is a transition element which is widely used in state-of-the-art technology, such as for medical prosthetic implants, solid state memories, active materials for Li-ion batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysts, among others.1–10
Among the variety of applications, titanium electrodes play an important role. Titanium nitride (TiN) thin films fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) have drawn attention as electrode materials with application in semiconductor devices, for instance, logic transistors or dynamic random access memories (DRAMs). Nevertheless, its resistivity is highly dependent on the fabrication process (i.e., temperature and impurities).11 Titanium oxide electrodes based on thin films doped with iridium are used to carry out a reliable and inexpensive oxygen catalysis for electrochemical hydrogen production. In this case, self-passivation of titanium oxynitride (TiON) is achieved by a surface layer of TiO2 obtaining high stability and durability.12 Semiconductor TiO2 thin films are used in the production of solar cells. Recently a combination of 3D printing and liquid deposition modeling (LDM) was used for controlling the pattern of TiO2 electrodes. In this way, it is possible to vary the numbers of printed layers and patterns of TiO2 thin films in a single operation.13
As titanium is a major constituent element in this kind of technological device, it requires adequate characterization.14–17 The properties of electrodes based on titanium dioxide thin films are constantly evaluated regarding their electrochemical features such as storage capacity, temperature behavior, colouration efficiency, etc.18 In addition, the performance of the electrodes is closely related to the production, amount and location of the different titanium oxides, which are related to the composition of substrates and levels of polarization, among others.19 In thin-film electrodes based on TiO2 formed on different substrates, the polarization process induces the formation of Ti(III) states, which cohabit in the bulk of Ti(IV); nevertheless, a passivated surface layer of Ti(IV) can appear at room temperature preventing the recombination of Ti(III) into Ti(IV) and keeping a net state of charge in the electrode.20 In photocatalysis, as well as in solar cell devices, the presence of reduced species in the TiO2 matrix by doping is believed to be responsible for electronic conduction.21–23 For this reason, one of the most important issues in titanium analysis is to properly discriminate two titanium oxidation states, specifically Ti(III) from Ti(IV), in surface layers of different technological materials of current interest. This task requires more precise and reliable techniques and methodologies.
This is where energy-dispersive inelastic X-ray scattering (EDIXS) spectroscopy comes in handy. This technique is a promising and novel tool for the discrimination and characterization of samples and materials of interest.24 During the last decade, and thanks to the versatility of X-ray emission techniques, EDIXS allowed the successful characterization of a wide variety of samples, from energy storage materials25 to contaminated waters.26 The versatility of this technique can be extended to irradiation geometries and experimental setups. Several results were reported in the last few years regarding the application of EDIXS in different geometries with the aim of highlighting specific sample information: 45–45° for bulk inspections,25,27–30 total reflection for surface analysis,26,31 grazing incidence for surface studies32–34 and even confocal setups for 3D explorations.35 It is interesting to note that EDIXS has already been successfully employed for the discrimination of multilayered metallic samples. These samples, composed by an arrangement of nanometric layers of different compounds of the same element, are particularly difficult to study by conventional spectroscopic techniques.
In this work, for the first time, the EDIXS technique is used with synchrotron radiation under grazing incidence conditions to determine the depth profile of Ti chemical states in surface nanolayers of diverse technological-application films. The originality of this methodology should be highlighted since it allowed chemical speciation by a novel X-ray technique in relevant film samples, in addition to the capability of performing depth sensitive characterization with nanometer resolution.
The measurements were carried out at Elettra synchrotron facility (Italy) utilizing monochromatic X-rays and scanning the incident radiation angle through the critical angle of total reflection.
The results obtained in this work confirm that the energy deposition at a particular depth of the electrodes is responsible for the changes in the chemical state of Ti, i.e. conversion from Ti(IV) to Ti(III). In addition, a passive nanolayer of Ti(IV) is formed on the most external region of the surface. These outcomes seem to be independent of the oxide film growth conditions.
The results of this work can be extended for application to other elements present in technological and energy storage materials for both scientific and industrial purposes.
2. Experimental
2.1 Samples
Samples consisted of thin titanium oxide films electrochemically grown on metallic titanium through potentiodynamic anodic polarization up to different final potential values (3.0 and 10.0 V). The anodic polarization was performed in a three electrode cell configuration using platinum foil as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, using different electrolyte compositions (NaCl and phosphoric acid). In order to investigate the effect of the cathodic treatment on the Ti oxidation state, after the Ti(IV) oxide film was prepared, a cathodic polarization up to −1.6 V was applied. Blank samples (Ti(IV) oxide with no cathodic polarization) were used as the standards of Ti(IV). Surface films of titanium oxides or (hydr)oxides of different chemical characteristics were obtained, as can be seen in Table 1.

In all samples, the surface roughness of the newly formed titanium electrodes was estimated in tens of nanometers,36 being sufficiently low to perform external total reflection of X-rays without any significant interference.
2.2 Measurements
The measurements of the titanium thin film samples described previously were performed at the XRF beamline of the Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste (EST, Italy) using the IAEA end-station facility (IAEAXSpe).37 The core of this end-station is an ultra-high vacuum chamber (UHVC) with a seven-axis motorized manipulator, for sample and detector positioning. The detector used in this work was an ultrathin window silicon drift detector (SDD) mounted in a fixed position of 90° with respect to the excitation beam (energy resolution of ∼131 eV for the Mn–Kα line). The flux of the primary X-ray beam was monitored by using a diamond membrane detector, and a LabVIEW Graphical User Interface (GUI) was utilized for data acquisition.38 This XRF beamline is equipped with a double crystal channel-cut monochromator, using a Si(111) crystal (with a resolving power of 1.4 × 10−4).
In order to study the samples by means of the EDIXS technique, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra were acquired at a fixed incident energy of 4900 eV, i.e., just beneath the K absorption edge of titanium. All the measurements were carried out under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions.
The endstation was set up in a grazing incidence geometry. The incidence radiation angle was scanned with the aim of studying the local chemical environment of titanium at different probing depths. Four different grazing incidence angles were selected for each sample: 0.1°, 0.3°, 0.4° and 1° with respect to the sample surface (determined accuracy for the rotational axes better than 10 arcsec (ref. 37)). The measuring time was 400 s per spectrum.
It should be noted that the measured angles (0.1°, 0.3°, 0.4° and 1° with respect to the sample surface) were selected after inspection of the penetration depth in TiO2, a typical Ti(IV) compound, for photons with an energy of 4900 eV. Fig. 1 shows the theoretical penetration depth as a function of the incident angle. Selected angles for measurement (bold vertical lines) are also indicated, which take into account the four representative depths of the surface. This curve was calculated according to the equations derived by Parratt39 and considering a density of 2.725 g cm−3 for TiO2.

2.3 Data analysis
As an example, Fig. 2 shows a measured spectrum from the blank sample at 1 degree (Energy 4900 eV, 400 s), where a RIXS peak can be observed to the left of the elastic one (at 4900 eV). The region of interest (ROI) for applying multivariate methods for the characterization procedure is shaded in green. The ROI determination is decided by the range of energy in which the main features of the RIXS process extend. In general, RIXS effects are not significantly 400–500 eV below the energy corresponding to the maximum amplitude of the peak. Since EDIXS spectroscopy relies on multivariate analysis, particularly in PCA, and this technique takes into account the whole variability of the dataset, slight alterations of some channels at the beginning of the ROI do not substantially modify the obtained results.
 Fig. 2  Example of the spectrum acquired from a titanium oxide sample (Blank, 1 degree). The RIXS peak (left) and the elastic peak (right) are shown. The ROI for PCA is also indicated in green. 
In order to discriminate changes in the titanium chemical state of the formed surface films, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the selected ROI of the RIXS spectra.24 The PCA of the 16 × 28 size dataset, consisting of 4 measurements of 28 energy channels for the 4 samples (Blank, 3 V-NaCl, 10 V-NaCl and 3 V-phosphoric), was carried out using the InfoStat software.40

Fig. 3 depicts the variability present in the dataset. In this figure, the average intensity count value of each energy channel is shown. Error bars represent the corresponding energy channel's sample standard deviation. The aim of these error bars is to give an estimation of the variability present in the experimental data set.
 Fig. 3  Average value and the sample standard deviation (error bars) of the energy channels, calculated with the set of spectra corresponding to each sample in the region of interest. 
The RIXS oscillations that are present in this region have a small amplitude compared to the average spectral values. This explains why a multivariate statistical analysis is required for a proper discrimination task. Fig. 3 also shows that the ROI (lower energy tail of the RIXS peaks) was normalized to its maximum intensity value before applying the PCA procedure. The blank samples were used as references for Ti(IV) oxide.
3. Results and discussion
The results of the principal component analysis of the measured dataset are shown in Fig. 4 and 5. Fig. 4 shows the loadings for each energy channel of the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) resulting from the PCA. It is important to have in mind that each principal component is a linear combination of all energy channel counts. This figure shows the weights in the linear combination of the energy channels that constitute PC1 and PC2.

 Fig. 5  Score plot of the PC1–PC2 plane resulting from the PCA applied to the region of interest. 

Fig. 5 displays the scores for each spectrum in both PC1 and PC2. This projection allows for the discrimination of the incident angle of excitation (numbers) in the different substrates (colors). In fact, PC1 separates the dataset into two subgroups, one having all intermediate depth measurements (0.3° and 0.4°) at negative values of PC1 (left), and another one having both superficial and bulk measurements (0.1° and 1° respectively) at positive values of PC1 (right). The only sample in which this is not the case is the blank sample (standard) with no treatment for which the oxidation state of Ti is known to be Ti(IV) for all depths.
By inspecting these last figures, it is interesting to note that the PC1 weight distribution of the energy channels in Fig. 4 indicates that the spectra clustered at positive values of PC1 in Fig. 5 have higher counts in the central area of the ROI, shown in Fig. 3, than those clustered at negative values of PC1. The total variability accounted for by the first two components is significantly high: 97%; this means that only 3% of the total variance is missing by analyzing this plane. Therefore, the main structure responsible for the differences between the studied spectra is being contemplated by this projection plane.
The analysis can be taken a step further by reprojecting the variability contemplated by the first principal component onto the energy channel basis41 as depicted in Fig. 6. By doing so, it is possible to understand what features allow for the discrimination in this spectra set. As the figure shows, all samples separate into two groups in which the measurements at 0.1° and 1° result in higher intensity values in this ROI than the measurements at 0.3° and 0.4°, despite the noise (around 3%). Also, the spectra gathered at 0.1° and 1° have the same behavior in this ROI as those of the blank samples, which are the standard samples for Ti(IV) oxide. Taking this into account, the selected ROI was observed to be highly sensitive to the chemical environment of Ti under the experimental conditions described before. This figure supports the hypothesis that the in-between layers, measured at 0.3° and 0.4°, differ in the Ti local environment.
 Fig. 6  Variability of the data contemplated by PC1, allowing for discrimination shown in energy space. Blank reference samples are marked with X, angles 0.1° and 1° are denoted by circles and angles and 0.3° and 0.4° by squares. The colors are in consistency with Fig. 5. 
Summarizing the results, at grazing angles (0.1°, the most external nanolayers) and penetrating angles (1°, bulk) the oxidation state corresponds to the Blank, i.e. Ti(IV) state. On the other hand, intermediate angles (0.3° and 0.4°, in-between layers) show a different Ti state. This behavior is in agreement with the expected one described in section 1. While the bulk and the most external nanolayer of the sample show a pure Ti(IV) state, intermediate layers contain a mixture of Ti(IV) and TI(III), indicating the depth range of energy deposition due to the cathodic polarization treatments, clearly related to the changes in the local environment of Ti according to the following reduction reaction: TiO2 + H+ + e− → TiO(OH). In addition, neither the substrate final anodic polarization nor the electrolyte used in the oxide growth seems to significantly modify the spatial distribution of the titanium oxidation states.
While studies of titanium multilayer characterization are numerous, depth profiling analyses of oxidation states at nanometric levels of the surface are hard to find. This is due to the limitations of the traditional techniques used in this field, i.e., AES, XPS, and GAXRD42–45 that are generally applied in the micrometric range. In this regard, the results shown in this work are in agreement with the expected behavior of titanium oxides in the bulk and in middle depths. Studies on kinetic oxidation of the surface layers have been carried out by Auger spectroscopy,20,46 indicating a fast and significant growth of the oxidation of titanium on the surface, which is in agreement with the behavior observed in this work. In addition, the EDIXS technique applied here presents a higher sensitivity at the nanometric level on the surface, in comparison with other traditional techniques that are effective at the micrometric range.
4. Conclusions
The results of this work show that changes in the oxidation state of Ti, from Ti(IV) to Ti(III), are related to the energy deposition due to the cathodic polarization treatment of the surface of the electrodes.
The depth-resolved study reveals that the energy deposition is located in a region spanning from some nanometers to a few hundred nanometers deep. On top of the sample, a thin passive nanolayer of Ti(IV) is formed after polarization, preserving the charged mixture of Ti(IV)/Ti(III) in the core of the electrode surface material. It is interesting to note that previous results20 seem to be independent of the oxide film growth conditions.
The results also show that it is possible to perform a depth profiling analysis of Ti oxidation states by means of EDIXS, which is difficult to achieve by conventional X-ray methods. Even considering that EDIXS has been used in previous studies to perform depth profiling analysis, some other techniques could be tested for alternative validation.
This outcome can be easily extended for application to other elements in technological materials for both scientific and industrial purposes.
