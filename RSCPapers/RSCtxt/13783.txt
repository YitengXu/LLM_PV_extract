    , Accepted 25th October 2022First published on 26th October 2022AbstractSilicon anodes are widely used in advanced energy conversion and storage devices such as lithium-ion batteries due to their high specific capacity. Nevertheless, the volume expansion and the poor electrical conductivity of silicon anodes limit their further commercial application. Thus, many researchers have recently explored several effective methods to improve their electrochemical performance and reduce volume expansion. These valuable methods include structure modification and design, seeking suitable binders, synthesizing composites of silicon with other materials, etc. In this work, we report a simple physical mixing method followed by pyrolysis to synthesize a Si and ZnMOF composite material (Si/ZnMOF) as a new type of MOF coated Si anode for lithium-ion batteries. Our Si/ZnMOF material pyrolyzed at 300 °C shows an excellent and stable capacity after long-term charge/discharge cycling. The specific capacity of the Si/ZnMOF-300 anode is 666.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 250 charge/discharge cycles, which is twice as high as that of pure Si under the same charge/discharge conditions. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the Si/ZnMOF anode is due to the consolidated MOF network which covers the Si particle surface as a coating. That coating can alleviate the volume expansion of anode materials during the charge/discharge process.
1. Introduction
With the increasing demand for energy storage/transmission devices such as electronic products and electric vehicles, a variety of rechargeable devices with high energy density and high power performance have been studied.1–3 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are important electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices in emerging portable electronics and powered vehicles, and even large-scale power grids. Lithium-ion batteries have the advantages of high energy density, abundant resources, wide electrochemical window, environment friendliness and so on.4,5 In recent years, the research on lithium-ion batteries has been gradually focused on batteries with light weight, long cycling stability, minimum cost, and environmental safety. However, due to the low theoretical capacity of conventional graphite anodes (372 mA h g−1),6 researchers began to study other anode materials to meet the increasing demand for high energy density.7
Silicon-based anodes have become a promising research area for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries,8,9 as silicon has the highest theoretical specific capacity (4200 mA h g−1), high safety, and high content in the Earth’s crust. But the low electrical conductivity of silicon,10,11 its low initial coulombic efficiency, and its huge volume expansion during cycling lead to severe capacity attenuation.12 There are three main reasons for the serious attenuation of silicon negative electrode capacity: (1) the volume expansion of silicon particles leads to their cracking and fragmentation, (2) separation from the current collector due to the stratification of the silicon electrodes, and (3) the expansion of silicon particles breaks the solid–electrolyte interphase layer (SEI), thus consuming more electrolyte and forming a thick SEI layer.13–15 In order to solve a series of problems caused by Si anodes, some effective methods have been adopted. First, researchers started by changing and modifying the morphology of simple Si substances, such as amorphous films, Si nanowires, Si nanoparticles, etc. After that, researchers also began to study hybrid composites of silicon anodes with other materials.16–19,24
Metal–organic frameworks are a type of crystalline material composed of metal ions and organic ligands.20 They have broad application prospects, including in gas separation, energy storage and catalysis.21–23 MOFs have very broad application prospects in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems because of their super-high specific surface area, large porosity, and adjustable structure.24,25 MOFs are widely used in energy storage systems like lithium–sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, fuel cells, and lithium-ion cells due to their unique structure. After treatments such as calcination, the inherent properties of the MOF are not only retained, but the electrochemical stability is also improved, so MOFs are candidates for optimal self-sacrifice templates.26 Nitrogen or carbon-doped MOF derivatives improve the conductivity and electrochemical activity of the anodic material through controlling the appropriate temperature and pyrolysis conditions for calcination in an air or nitrogen atmosphere.27–29
Therefore, on this basis, a porous carbon-doped Si/ZnMOF composite derived from the attached Si surface was prepared by physically mixing Si and ZnMOF and calcining under argon in a tubular furnace. The synthesis process is shown in Scheme 1. With its use as an anodic material for lithium-ion batteries, the Si/ZnMOF composite has a high specific capacity and good cycling properties. The good electrochemical properties of the composite are mainly due to the following factors. First of all, the composite inherits the extremely high specific capacity of silicon, which can improve the capacity. Second, the MOF coating covers the surface of Si to alleviate the huge volume expansion, which can benefit the cycling stability.

2. Results and discussion
The SEM images in Fig. 1 show the surface morphology of ZnMOF, and Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500 composites. Fig. 1a and b show the SEM image of ZnMOF. The morphology of ZnMOF is a spherical cluster structure with different cluster sizes. The particle size is about 0.5–1.0 μm. However, the structure of Si/ZnMOF-300 was changed when ZnMOF was mixed with Si and calcined at 300 °C. As is shown in Fig. 1c and d, the smooth bulk silicon is distributed as small particles, and the distribution of small particles (size 1–2 μm) is uneven. Fig. 1e and f show the morphological characteristics of the Si/ZnMOF composite after pyrolysis at 500 °C. The large smooth bulk structure is silicon, which is surrounded by rough and porous aggregates. The addition of ZnMOF increases the surface area and pore volume of the material to a certain extent, so that it can effectively adsorb the electrolyte, accelerating the diffusion of Li+ and improving the rate performance.

From Fig. 2a and b, TEM images of Si/ZnMOF-300 show that the Si particles are simply coated with ZnMOF on the outer layer of Si. Fig. 2c shows the diffraction image of the region, compared with Si (JCPDS card no. 75-0589), showing the (220), (222), and (331) crystal planes at 2θ = 47.43, 58.6, and 76.4°, respectively. The element mapping in Fig. 2d shows that the C, O, and Zn elements of Si/ZnMOF-300 are evenly distributed, and Si is present in large blocks. This proves that ZnMOF, composed mainly of C, O, and Zn, completely wraps Si as a coating.

As shown in Fig. 3a, it can be seen from the XRD images that the diffraction peaks of Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500 at 28.443°, 47.304°, 56.124°, 58.857°, 69.131° and 76.378° correspond to Si when compared with the standard XRD pattern of Si. This indicates that the two materials are simply composites, and the characteristic peaks of Si are still maintained after pyrolysis. In addition to the peaks of Si, the peaks of Si/ZnMOF-300 are reduced compared with those of ZnMOF. This may be due to the insufficient drying of ZnMOF during synthesis, resulting in an unvolatilized solvent peak. However, after calcination at 300 °C and volatilization of DMF solvent and water, the peaks of Si/ZnMOF-300 were reduced. A comparison between Si/ZnMOF-500 and the ZnO standard pattern (JCPDS card no. 36-1451) shows that the two patterns completely correspond, indicating that ZnMOF changes at 500 °C and transforms into ZnO. No peak of crystalline carbon (graphite) was found in Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500, indicating that the carbon in both may be amorphous and the carbon peak is covered by ZnO and MOF peaks.

Thermogravimetric analysis of the Si/ZnMOF precursor was carried out in a N2 atmosphere. As can be seen from the TGA curve in Fig. 3b, the sample has two weight loss zones. The first weight loss occurs below 200 °C, during which the evaporation process of solvent and water occurs.30 At the first plateau, the precursor was heat treated at 300 °C to obtain the Si/ZnMOF-300 complex. This process is a solvent volatilization process at low temperature, which is consistent with the XRD results. It is worth noting that the second weight loss is more obvious at 300 °C to 500 °C, during which the weight is reduced by 22.6%. Thermogravimetric analysis combined with XRD suggests that this is due to the process of ZnMOF converting to ZnO. After calcination at 500 °C, the ZnMOF coating in the Si/ZnMOF-500 complex was completely transformed into ZnO with the collapse of the MOF matrices, which may lead to lower electrochemical capacity compared to the 300 °C counterpart.

Fig. 3c and d show the BET surface area and pore size distribution of Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500. According to IUPAC classification, the two BET curves are classified as type III curves with small specific surface area, which may be due to the presence of large smooth Si surfaces in the material, resulting in a small average surface area of the material. The main peak in the BJH pore size distribution curve (Fig. 3d) is in the range of 0–10 nm, confirming that the two materials have a mesoporous structure.
As shown in Fig. 4a, the capacity of the Si/ZnMOF-300 material is much higher than that of Si/ZnMOF-500 and pure Si and can be maintained at 650 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 within the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V and after 250 cycles. The specific discharge capacity of the Si/ZnMOF-300 composite remains at 666.7 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles, which is nearly two times higher than that of pure Si (343.4 mA h g−1) tested under the same conditions. However, the discharge specific capacity has a large capacity decay in the first few weeks. This is due to the instability of the electrode structure after the insertion of lithium in the first few weeks, coupled with the huge volume expansion generated by the Si particles, which led to the rapid capacity decay in the first few weeks. In the following cycle, the gap of the MOF is gradually opened, the electrolyte penetrates the gap, and the electrode material is activated, leading to a slow rise in the discharge specific capacity. Combined with the SEM and TEM results (Fig. 1), the Si/ZnMOF-300 material is coated with a layer of MOF material on the surface of Si particles, which can alleviate the huge volume expansion of Si particles at charge/discharge cycling. In addition, the layer of MOF covering the surface of Si particles can greatly improve the specific surface area of the material which will increase the contact area between the composite and the electrolyte, benefiting the capacity performance.

Fig. 4b and c show the voltage curves of Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500 composite anodes at a constant current density of 100 mA g−1. The specific discharge capacity of the Si/ZnMOF-300 electrode is 1661.5 mA h g−1 at first discharge and 1763.9 mA h g−1 at first charge, and the initial coulomb efficiency (CE) is 94.2%. On the first cycle curve, there is an obvious charging platform with voltage below 0.5 V, which is consistent with the CV diagram of the first cycle of Si/ZnMOF-300 in Fig. 4e. It is worth noting that with the increase in the number of cycles, the specific discharge capacity from the first to the 50th cycle decreases significantly, while from the 50th cycle to the 250th cycle the specific discharge capacity increases significantly, which is consistent with the constant-current charge–discharge curve in Fig. 4a. The rapid decrease in specific discharge capacity in the first ten cycles is due to the expansion and cracking of Si particles, forming an SEI layer, and the electrode is unstable due to embedding of Li+. However, after the 50th cycle, the capacity starts to grow slowly for two possible reasons: (1) since the outer surface of Si is covered with a ZnMOF layer, this slows down part of the volume expansion of Si and inhibits the cracking of Si particles; (2) with the increase in the number of cycles, the pores of the MOF are gradually opened, and the MOF is activated to form a relatively stable pore structure. The surface area increases, leading to an increase in the capacity. The voltage curves of Si/ZnMOF-500 shown in Fig. 4c exhibit the same trend as those of Si/ZnMOF-300, but the capacity is much lower than that of the latter.
In addition, as shown in Fig. 4d, Si/ZnMOF-300 also has good rate performance. When the current density is 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, and 50 mA g−1, the reversible capacities are 510.8, 358.2, 216.1, 162.7, 127.6, 155.6, and 468.1 mA h g−1, respectively. The volume expansion of Si/ZnMOF-300 is inevitable in the process of charging and discharging, which seriously affects the rate performance of Si/ZnMOF-300. However, because of the unique porous structure of the MOF as a coating on the Si particles, lithium insertion and extraction can occur smoothly under rapid charge and discharge conditions, and the rate performance of Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500 is slightly higher than that of pure silicon materials.
To study the reaction mechanism of Si/ZnMOF composites, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were carried out at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 and in a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. Fig. 4e shows the CV curves of Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500 in the second cycle. The peak positions of Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500 are relatively close, and the Si/ZnMOF-300 material has a cathode peak at about 0.19 V, which is due to the formation of LixSi when Li+ is inserted into Si. However, two anodic peaks appear at about 0.38 and 0.5 V, which are formed due to the delithiation process of LixSi.31,32 The peaks at 0.54 V and 0.45 V may be due to the reaction between ZnO and Li to produce Zn and Li2O.33,34 In addition, Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500 also show two weakened oxidation peaks at about 1.0 V and 1.2 V, respectively.
To study the lithium storage performance of the Si/ZnMOF composite material, an EIS test was carried out. Fig. 4f shows the Nyquist diagram of the two materials and their equivalent circuit diagram. The Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500 electrodes show a semicircle representing the charge transfer resistance between the electrode and the electrolyte interface layer. In addition, there is a slanting line representing ion diffusion in the low frequency region. The semicircle of Si/ZnMOF-500 is slightly smaller than that of Si/ZnMOF-300, which indicates that the electrochemical dynamics of Si/ZnMOF-500 is better than that of Si/ZnMOF-300. This may be because ZnMOF still retains its original structure at 300 °C. Because of the lower conductivity of the MOF, Si/ZnMOF-300 exhibits bad electron transfer in the electrochemical process. In contrast, at 500 °C ZnMOF is converted to ZnO, which improves the conductivity and the electron transfer on the interface of the Si/ZnMOF-500 composite, thus resulting in good electrochemical dynamics.

Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of Si/ZnMOF-300 before and after 300 cycles. The batteries before and after cycling are 50% DOD discharged. The morphology of the Si/ZnMOF-300 composite electrode does not change much before and after cycling, and there is no passivation film on the electrode surface, indicating that the material has good structural stability and reversible properties during the charge/discharge process, which is consistent with its cycling performance shown in Fig. 4a. This is further proof that the ZnMOF coating improves the cycling stability of Si anodes.

3. Experimental
3.1. Synthesis of ZnMOF
Terephthalic acid (2.5 g) and trimethylamine (4 mL) were dissolved in DMF (200 mL). Zn(OAc)2 (8.5 g) was dissolved in DMF (250 mL). Then the two solutions were mixed to form a precipitate. After stirring for 2.5 h, the samples were collected by centrifugation using a centrifuge. The resulting mixture was washed with DMF (100 mL) and methanol (50 mL). The resulting solid was put into a vacuum drying tank for 85 °C to dry out the white solid.
3.2. Synthesis of the Si/ZnMOF material
Si and the prepared ZnMOF (mass ratio 1:1) were mixed, and the Si/ZnMOF composite was obtained by manual grinding in a mortar for 0.5 h. The resulting Si/ZnMOF composite was transferred to an alumina crucible in a tubular furnace. The pyrolysis temperatures were 300 °C and 500 °C in an atmosphere of argon, and the heating rate was 5 °C min−1. The temperature was held for 2 h, and the products were cooled naturally. Si/ZnMOF-300 and Si/ZnMOF-500 composites were obtained after grinding.
3.3. Materials characterization
A Rigaku D&A X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) was used to measure the X-ray diffraction patterns. The radiation source was Cu Kα (λ = 0.15 nm) with an angle measurement range (2θ) of 5–80°. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out by using a TGA Q500 synchronous analyzer (TA, USA), and the temperature was raised to 800 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The samples were characterized by SEM with a Quanta FEG 250 system, and the acceleration voltage was 15 kV. TEM tests were carried out on the samples. The powder samples were dispersed with ethanol for 10 min, and then TEM was carried out using an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 system. The acceleration voltage was 200 kV.
3.4. Electrochemical measurements
The anode material was prepared by mixing the Si and ZnMOF-300 composite material with acetylene black (SaiBo, China) and PVDF (ShunJie, China) at a mass ratio of 5:3:2. The mixed slurry was uniformly coated on the copper collector and dried at 60 °C for 5 h in a vacuum drying oven. Si/ZnMOF-500 and pure Si anodes were prepared by the same method.
The battery to be tested was assembled in a glove box filled with high-purity argon gas. During the test, the battery model was LIR 2032, and the electrolyte was KlE-HV4701 high-voltage buckle battery electrolyte (XiangHeKunLun, China). The battery was sealed using an MK-160E buckle battery sealing machine, and the battery assembly was completed. The assembled battery was tested on a LAND CT2001A battery cycle test system for a constant current charge–discharge test and rate performance test. The charge–discharge cut-off voltage was 3.0 and 0.01 V vs. Li+/Li, respectively, and the current density was 100 mA g−1.
Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a 1260/1287 electrochemical workstation (Solartron, UK) with the working electrode as the test electrode and lithium metal as the reference electrode and counter electrode. The cyclic voltammetry test started with the stable potential of the working electrode, and the scanning was carried out continuously for several cycles in a certain potential range and at a certain scanning rate. The potential range was 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li+/Li, and the scanning speed was 0.1 mV s−1. The AC impedance test started from the stable potential of the working electrode, and the frequency range was 0.01–100000 Hz.
4. Conclusions
In summary, ZnMOF with a porous structure was synthesized by a one-step stirring method, and the Si/ZnMOF-300 composite was synthesized by mixing ZnMOF with Si and calcination at 300 °C. The Si/ZnMOF-300 anode shows high capacity and excellent cycling stability. The specific capacity of the Si/ZnMOF-300 anode was maintained at 666.7 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the Si/ZnMOF-300 anode is attributed to the ZnMOF coating which wraps the outer layer of Si particles to alleviate the volume expansion during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the ZnMOF coating increases the surface area of the Si particles, which is beneficial to the storage of Li+ and electron transport. Therefore, our ZnMOF coating improves the electrochemical properties of the Si anode, which has significance for the application of MOF materials in anodes or cathodes for lithium-ion batteries.
