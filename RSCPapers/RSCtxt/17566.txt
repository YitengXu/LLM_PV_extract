    , Accepted 19th October 2016First published on 19th October 2016AbstractWe designed and synthesized a water-dispersible dye-sensitized upconversion nanocomposite with approximately 17 times enhancement of upconversion luminescence. The nanocomposite was successfully applied in lymphatic imaging for the first time as an application model.
Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted significant attention in recent years because of their ability to combine two or more low-energy photons to generate one high-energy photon by an anti-Stokes process.1 Such a special optical property makes UCNPs applicable in many areas, including bioimaging,2 drug delivery,3 biosensing,4 photodynamic therapy,5 photoactivation,6 and solar cell development.7 However, further progress in utilizing rare-earth upconversion nanoparticles has been constrained by low conversion efficiency.8 In order to improve the upconversion luminescence (UCL) of UCNPs, recent efforts have been attempted by reducing the possibility of nonradiative transition,9 enhancing the absorption of sensitizers or using a combination of these methods.10 However, none of these approaches address the main limitation of UCNPs, namely the narrow and weak absorption associated with the nature of the 4f–4f electronic transitions of lanthanide ions.
To address this problem of lanthanide-doped UCNPs, Hummelen’s group reported that the utilization of a carboxylic acid-modified cyanine dye, acting as an antenna to absorb packets of optical energies across a broad wavelength range, enabled a broadband excitation of NaYF4:Yb/Er.11 In a dye-sensitized system, a large energy match between the donating energy level of the dye and the accepting energy level of UCNPs is important to achieve efficient energy transfer. Chen et al. proved that the upconversion quantum efficiency was as high as 19% with a large energy match between UCNPs and dyes.12 However, the dye-sensitized upconversion system is difficult to achieve directly in aqueous solution, because the fluorescence efficiency of NIR dyes in water is much lower than in the organic phase, which limits its application in biological imaging. The development of water-dispersible dye-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles should lead to important applications in biological imaging.13
In our study, we designed a water-dispersible dye-sensitized upconversion nanocomposite for biological imaging. This nanocomposite was composed of an epitaxial core–shell upconversion nanocrystal NaYF4:Yb,Nd,Er@NaYF4:Nd (abbreviated as CS:Nd) and NIR dyes attached on the core–shell nanocrystal surface wrapped in an amphiphilic phosphatidylcholine. The NIR dyes can broadly and strongly harvest NIR light, and subsequently initialize multistep directional energy transfer to the excite lanthanide ions positioned within the inorganic core to entail an upconversion process, which results in enhancing the UCL in the aqueous phase (Scheme 1). The surface modified with phosphatidylcholine can provide both the hydrophobic layer to reduce the possible non-radiative quenching of NIR dye molecules and the hydrophilic surface to be biocompatible. We successfully realized the application of the water-dispersible dye-sensitized upconversion nanocomposite in lymphatic imaging under different NIR excitation wavelengths for the first time. This suggests the feasibility of the dye-sensitized upconversion nanocomposite system for biophotonic applications.

To realize high efficiency energy transfer in a dye-sensitized upconversion, a core–shell nanophosphor NaYF4:30%Yb,1%Nd,0.5%Er@NaYF4:20%Nd (denoted CS:Nd) was utilized. Monodispersed, hexagonal phase core–shell nanoparticles of ∼22 nm size, with a shell thickness of ∼4 nm, were synthesized. The crystal phase, the formation of a core–shell structure, and the dimensions of the core and the shell have been substantiated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra (Fig. 1a, Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The UCL properties of the CS:Nd were examined at an excitation of 808 nm as shown in Fig. S1f (ESI†). A sulfonic-functionalized cyanine dye derivative (abbreviated as Cy7) (Scheme S1, Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†) was used as the antenna dye. The sulfonic groups of Cy7 can contribute to its anchoring to the nanoparticle surface. The emission spectrum of Cy7 overlaps strongly with the absorption peaks of the Nd3+-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles (Fig. 1b). This overlap allows for energy transfer from Cy7 to Nd3+ ions in the shell.

Upconversion emission spectra from ligand free CS:Nd with varied concentrations of Cy7 dye for sensitization and the enhancement of the UCL540nm from the CS:Nd nanoparticles versus the Cy7 dye concentration (inset): (c) in EtOH and (d) in water. 
To examine the energy transfer between Cy7 dye and CS:Nd in organic solvent, we used a simple model with close contact between Cy7 dye and the upconversion nanoparticles driven by static electronic forces. An ionic NOBF4 ligand was used to replace the original oleic ligand and then further exchanged with the sulfonic-functionalized Cy7 following a previous report.14 Attachment of Cy7 to the surface of the UCNPs was confirmed by changes in the spectral properties of the dyes (Fig. S5, ESI†).
When introducing varied concentrations of the Cy7 dye into ligand free CS:Nd nanoparticles dispersed in EtOH, the upconversion emission intensity first increased (Fig. 1c), which was consistent with increasing overall absorption of the excitation energy by an increasing number of surface-bound antenna molecules (Fig. S6a, ESI†). However, beyond a certain concentration, the further increase in the Cy7/nanoparticle ratio resulted in decreased luminescence intensities. The observed decline can be explained by two factors: increased mutual interactions between the antenna molecules on the CS:Nd nanoparticle surface (self-quenching) (Fig. S6b, ESI†) and increased concentration of unbound (excess) antenna molecules which absorb the excitation energy but do not transfer it to the nanoparticle. The optimized UCL from the Cy7 dye sensitized core–shell CS:Nd was enhanced ∼30 times in EtOH and the efficiency of energy transfer was determined to be about ∼62% quantified using the decay of Cy7 fluorescence lifetime shortened from 1.07 ns to 0.41 ns (Fig. S7, ESI†). Since the rare earth up-conversion luminescence is a two-photon process, the upconversion quantum yield (UCQY) of its own is increased with the power density. The Cy7 modification is equivalent to the increase in the power density of the excitation light, which results in a higher relative UCQY of the optimized Cy7 dye-sensitized CS:Nd nanoparticles (Fig. S8, ESI†). However, the optimized UCL intensity of the dye sensitized system was only enhanced ∼2.0 times in the aqueous phase (Fig. 1d). The low sensitization efficiency in the aqueous phase can be explained by two factors: the low absorption and fluorescence of the dye in water and the attachment of Cy7 dye to the surface of the UCNPs affected by water. As shown in Fig. S9a and b (ESI†), the absorption and fluorescence of Cy7 dye in water were significantly lower than in the organic solvents, as well as the relative quantum efficiency (Table S1, ESI†). In addition, the UCL intensities of the Cy7-attached upconversion nanoparticles exhibited a stronger dependence on the H2O/EtOH ratio (v/v) than those of the free upconversion nanoparticles (Fig. S9c and d, ESI†). To confirm the influence of water on the UCL intensities of Cy7-attached CS:Nd, the changes in the absorption and fluorescence of pure Cy7 dye and Cy7-attached CS:Nd versus the H2O/EtOH ratio were investigated. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the H2O/EtOH ratio made no difference in the absorption and fluorescence of pure Cy7 dye, whereas the absorption and fluorescence of Cy7-attached CS:Nd nanoparticles were first increased and then stabilized. Moreover, when varied volumes of water were introduced into the Cy7-attached CS:Nd dispersed in EtOH, the absorption of the dye in the supernatant was increased (Fig. S11, ESI†), indicating that the attachment of Cy7 dye to the surface of the upconversion nanoparticles was affected by water.
In order to achieve highly efficient dye-sensitized upconversion luminescence in water, we proposed to fabricate CS:Nd and Cy7 into a composite structure. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), which is one of the main components of an animal cell membrane and has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for disease treatment in the clinic,15 was used to assist self-assembly through a hydrophobic–hydrophobic interaction, the protocol of which is presented in Fig. 2a. Sulfonic-functionalized Cy7 first partly exchanged the oleic acid ligands in the surface of the UCNPs, and then the hydrophobic UCNPs were wrapped in the amphiphilic PC to obtain a water dispersible nanocomposite. TEM images (Fig. S12, ESI†) showed that the as-prepared nanocomposite has no significant changes in size, shape, and crystallinity after loading of Cy7. The assembly of the organic dye Cy7 and amphiphilic phosphatidylcholine on the surface of CS:Nd was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis (Fig. S13, ESI†).

(b) UCL of CS:Nd-Cy7@PC (0.5 mg mL−1) loaded with different concentrations of Cy7 in water and emission intensity integrated in the range of 500–675 nm as a function of the Cy7 content (inset) excited using an 808 nm c.w. laser. (c) Photographic images of CS:Nd@PC and optimized CS:Nd-Cy7@PC (excited at 808 nm). (d) UCL images in living HeLa cells incubated with CS:Nd-Cy7@PC and CS:Nd@PC, respectively. The UCL signal was collected by a green channel at 500–560 nm. 
We verified the absorption and fluorescence of pure Cy7 dye coated with PC showed obvious enhancement in aqueous solution (Fig. S14, ESI†) and the relative quantum efficiency of Cy7@PC was increased to 8.0% in water (Table S1, ESI†). We then determined the optimal concentrations of antenna molecules of Cy7 in the nanocomposite so as to achieve the most efficient dye-sensitized upconversion (Table S2 and Fig. S15, ESI†). With the increase of Cy7 concentration, we observed that the upconversion emission intensity first increased and then decreased (Fig. 2b), which was similar to the case in ethanol solution. The optimum Cy7 dye:NP number ratio was determined to be ∼84. The optimized UCL from the Cy7 dye sensitized CS:Nd-Cy7@PC was shown to be ∼17 times greater than that of CS:Nd@PC under irradiation at ∼808 nm. The UCL boost was also visible from the photographic images in Fig. 2c. In addition, the CS:Nd-Cy7@PC had strong upconversion emission, whereas no detectable upconversion emission of CS:Nd@PC was observed under irradiation at 785 nm and 760 nm (Fig. S16, ESI†). This reveals that the photon energy is absorbed by the NIR dye Cy7 and then transferred to the nanoparticles. Moreover, the dye release rate in this nanocomposite was measured by the changes in absorption and UCL intensities as shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†). After seven days, the absorption and UCL intensities of CS:Nd-Cy7@PC remained more than 70%, indicating that the water-dispersible dye-sensitized upconversion nanocomposite is relatively stable. The nanocomposite with optimal concentration was used in all subsequent experiments for bioapplications.
The cytotoxicity of CS:Nd-Cy7@PC was investigated by standard methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay (Fig. S18, ESI†). After incubation with 100–800 μg mL−1 samples for 24 h, the cellular viability of HeLa cells was more than 85%, indicating that the CS:Nd-Cy7@PC have low cytotoxicity on cell proliferation. Subsequently, the monodispersed water-dispersible nanocomposite has been further explored as a luminescent probe for biological applications. By utilizing a laser scanning upconversion luminescence microscope, the luminescence imaging of living cells was investigated. HeLa cells were incubated with 300 μg mL−1 CS:Nd-Cy7@PC and CS:Nd@PC respectively. It was found that intense UCL emission in HeLa cells incubated with CS:Nd-Cy7@PC was observed, whereas no obvious signal was detected for cells cultured with CS:Nd@PC under the same conditions as shown in Fig. 2d, These results suggested the feasibility of biological applications for dye-sensitized upconversion.
Moreover, the in vivo animal imaging of such phosphatidylcholine modified dye-sensitized upconversion nanocomposites was evaluated by lymph imaging. The CS:Nd-Cy7@PC and CS:Nd@PC (20 μL, 2 mg mL−1) were injected intradermally into the claw with the expected drainage pattern to nodes within the oxter, respectively. It was found that the intense upconversion signal only appeared in the lymphatic drainage basins of the oxter of the mice injected with CS:Nd-Cy7@PC under irradiation at 808 nm, 785 nm and 760 nm, whereas a very weak or no UCL signal was detected for the mice after injection with CS:Nd@PC (Fig. 3 and Fig. S19, ESI†). The lymph nodes in situ and ex vivo imaging were investigated further to confirm the luminescence from the lymphatic drainage basins of the oxter. This result demonstrated that the water-dispersible dye-sensitized upconversion nanosystem is feasible and results in images with improved UCL intensity. The ability to utilize numerous excitation IR wavelengths for bioimaging provides strong potential for wide use of dye-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles for biological applications.

In summary, we designed and synthesized a phosphatidylcholine modified water-dispersible dye-sensitized upconversion nanocomposite composed of NIR dye, and Nd3+-based upconversion nanophosphors for biological imaging. We demonstrated that the NIR dye molecules are able to act as antennae to capture photons for subsequent upconversion energy transfer, which results in enhancing the UCL intensity in the water-dispersible nanocomposite. The overall upconversion luminescence of the dye-sensitized nanoparticles is enhanced approximately 17 times under irradiation at 808 nm and NIR excitation responses are broad. Importantly, we successfully realized the application of the phosphatidylcholine modified water-dispersible dye-sensitized upconversion nanocomposite in lymphatic imaging under broad NIR excitation for the first time. This approach promises to provide a generalized method that can be utilized in many practical applications in biological systems.
