    , Accepted 28th September 2015First published on 29th September 2015AbstractThe advantage of visible-light photocatalysis lies in its use of clean, renewable, cheap visible light as a driving force. Recently heterogeneous visible light photocatalysts have drawn much attention due to their nature of easy recycling and simple chemical work-up. Immense effort has been devoted to the application of solar energy in the field of energy regeneration such as hydrogen production and the reduction of carbon dioxide. Recently, solar energy has also captured much attention in organic synthesis due to its unique advantages. This paper will review the state-of-the-art progresses in the application of heterogeneous visible-light photocatalysis in organic synthesis through four sections: oxidation of alcohols, oxidation of amines, carbon–carbon bond formation reactions, and carbon–hetero bond formation reactions.

1. Introduction
With the intensification of the conflict between the global depletion of fossil fuels and rising energy demand, environmental pollution caused by coal and oil is certainly serious. Therefore, clean and renewable solar energy resources are gradually entering scientists' horizons and have shown great advantages in applications in the past decades, such as in solar cells,1–3 hydrogen production by water splitting,4,5 degradation of organic pollutants,6–9 reduction of carbon dioxide,10–12etc. Meanwhile, the application of solar energy as the motive power in organic synthesis starts to become alive.13,14 The main components of solar energy are ultraviolet (λ = 200–400 nm), visible light (λ = 400–800 nm) and infrared (λ > 800 nm), the proportions of which are approximately 5%, 43%, and 52% respectively. The ultraviolet energy can directly activate the chemical bonds of some organic molecules to give highly reactive radical intermediates, which results in poor selectivity of the products. Moreover, the infrared wavelength with comparatively low energy is unable to meet the requirement of activation energy for the vast majority of organic reactions.
Visible light is abundant in nature compared to the ultraviolet and infrared, but it generally cannot be adsorbed directly by the reactant molecules to drive the reaction. Therefore, visible light photocatalysts, employed as a bridging media for the energy transfer between visible light and the substrates, will be of particular importance. These photocatalysts can be divided into five different groups including the homogeneous photocatalysts represented by Ru and Ir metal complexes,15–26 organic dyes27–30 and the opposite heterogeneous photocatalysts represented by semiconductors,31–33 plasmonic-metal nanoparticles34,35 and other novel photoelectric materials.36–39 As known to all, heterogeneous visible light catalysts can be easily recovered and the reaction products can be separated more conveniently with respect to the homogeneous catalysts, and so provides a greener way for organic chemical transformation.
For semiconductors with a relatively small band gap, like CdS, BiVO4, mpg-C3N4, etc., the catalytic mechanism follows the fundamental principle that the electrons at the valence band transit to the conduction band by absorbing photons when the incident visible light energy is equal to or greater than the band gap of the semiconductor and hence leave holes at the valence band. Different semiconductors exhibit different band gap widths and band positions, so the hole and electron pairs generated in situ have different oxidation and reduction potentials. The recombination of hole and electron pairs often occurs when the carrier (electron and hole) migrates to the surface of the catalyst, which lowers the photo-catalytic efficiency. Several methods have been reported to enhance the separation efficiency of hole–electron pairs, such as taking a photocatalyst supported on graphene with a large surface area,40,41 or to make full use of a precious metal material with strong electron conductivity like Pt42,43 that could accelerate the photogenerated charge transfer. However, not all of the semiconductors with a relatively small band gap, such as TiO2 and Nb2O5, respond to the visible light. The most recent research found that even when big band gap semiconductors were used as photocatalysts under visible light irradiation, they still performed well when specific substrates like benzyl alcohols or benzylamines and their derivatives were used.
In this case, surface complexes formed by the interaction of the active species such as metal active sites44–46 or surface ˙OH species47,48 with alcohols or amines may be the reason that TiO2 or Nb2O5 could respond to the visible light, in which these complex species are more likely to be excited by visible light and subsequently transfer electrons to the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore, the visible light photocatalysis principle of TiO2 and Nb2O5 can be depicted as in Scheme 1, which is different to the principle of CdS and mpg-C3N4 with small band gaps. In another case, Zhao and Robinson49–51 recently developed catalytic systems using a dye-sensitized semiconductor as the photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The unique catalytic mechanism of dye-sensitized semiconductor photocatalysts in organic synthesis under visible light irradiation is as indicated in Scheme 2. The dye, excited by visible light, directly injects an electron into the conduction band of a semiconductor like TiO2 and is subsequently quenched by TEMPO. Thus, the active oxidising species of TEMPO plays a critical role in the oxidation of substrates.

When the frequency of the incident photon is well matched with the overall vibration frequency of the conduction electrons of the plasmonic-metal nanoparticles, strong absorption of photons occurs due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect.52,53 The plasmon resonance absorption of typical spherical Au nanoparticles is around the 520–550 nm visible region, exhibiting great potential in visible-light photocatalysis.34,35 However, the stability and catalytic performance of the single plasmon nanoparticle is poor, which severely restricts its use.32 Generally, inert ZrO2,54 SiO255 and reducible CeO256 and TiO257 are often used as the supports of Au nanoparticles. The conduction bands of those supports receiving electrons generated by visible light can excite Au nanoparticles, which are subsequently turned into new catalytic active sites (catalytic principle is as shown in Scheme 3).52 Thus, those supports could not only stabilize the plasmon nanoparticles, but also improve the catalytic performance of the photocatalyst.

Zhao32 has reviewed the application of heterogeneous visible-light photocatalysts in organic transformations based on the types of photocatalysts. We intend to review the processes from a different perspective through four sections: the oxidation of alcohols, oxidation of amines, carbon–carbon bond formation reactions, and carbon–hetero bond formation reactions. The application of different types of heterogeneous photocatalysts like metal oxides, metal sulfides, organic semiconductors, plasmonic-metal nanoparticles, and other novel heterogeneous photoelectric materials in organic synthesis will be illustrated in each part.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Oxidation of alcohols
Carbonyl compounds are important intermediates in organic synthesis, and the selective oxidation of alcohols is a major approach to obtain carbonyl compounds.58,59 But traditional chemical oxidants such as chromate60 or permanganate61 do not comply with environmental and economic requirements. The low cost, easily available, non-toxic, highly active TiO2 photocatalyst62,63 using light as the energy source has become a hot research area. However, the big band gap of TiO2 limits its application in visible-light photocatalysis. Thus, modifications of TiO264 such as through Fe3+, V4+, Cr3+, Sn4+, and Sm3+ metal ion doping,65–69 C, N, S and F non-metal ion doping,70–73 or dye-sensitization49 has become necessary to extend the photo-response of TiO2 to the visible region.
Zhao et al. reported the selective oxidation reaction of aromatic alcohols catalyzed by the co-catalytic system of dye-sensitized TiO2 and TEMPO (Scheme 4).49 Under visible-light irradiation and in the presence of O2, the excited alizarin red transferred electrons to the conduction band of TiO2 and TEMPO subsequently reduced the dye radical cation to complete the dye photocatalytic cycle. The process was then followed by the direct oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. Robinson et al.50,51 used the dye/ZnO/TEMPO system with AgNO3 as an terminal oxidant, and successfully oxidized aromatic alcohols to aromatic aldehydes.
 Scheme 4 
The unmodified anatase TiO2 can also catalyze the oxidation of benzyl alcohol and its derivatives in the presence of visible light and O2, and the visible-light response is derived from the complex formed in situ by the interaction between the surface OH species of TiO2 and alcohols (Scheme 5).47,48 The 2p orbital of the oxygen atom of the surface complex, whose energy level is higher than the valence band of TiO2, can act as a donor energy level,32 hence the surface complex could be excited by visible light. When the substrate is para-hydroxyl benzyl alcohol, the yield is relatively low. This may be ascribed to the strong adsorption of phenolic hydroxyl with the surface hydroxyl group of TiO2, resulting in the hard desorption and thus excessive oxidation of the products. The adsorption characteristic of the substrate on the surface of TiO2 is the reason why the relatively low activity of a rutile phase TiO274 photocatalyst could also catalyze the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde effectively under similar conditions. Analogous to TiO2, Nb2O5 also belongs to the large band gap semiconductor family, and can only absorb light with wavelength λ < 390 nm. Taking into account of this adsorption characteristic, Tanaka44 realized the visible-light photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds.
 Scheme 5 
Though the conventional semiconductor TiO2 photocatalyst can be modified to make it respond to visible light, more novel photoelectric materials have been found with better photo-catalytic efficiency. A metal organic framework (MOF) is a kind of porous coordination polymer formed by the self-assembly of metal ions and organic ligands, and recently they have attracted much attention because of their high porosity, specific surface area and other notable properties.75–77 Through the use of UIO–66(NH2)MOFs as the support, a MOF–CdS nanocomposite was synthesized by Wu.36 Experimental results indicated that UIO–66(NH2) could not only act as a support, but also participate in the photoinduced electron transfer, which effectively inhibited the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers, and successfully catalyzed the aromatic alcohol selective oxidation (Scheme 6).
 Scheme 6 
The photocatalyst mpg-C3N4 with a medium-band gap and appropriate band positions has been used in selective oxidation reactions.31 Recently, Wang78 used the mpg-C3N4 organic semiconductor as a visible light photocatalyst, and successfully catalyzed the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds under conditions of visible light and O2 (Scheme 7). The amino and alkaline N groups on the surface of mpg-C3N4 are beneficial for the formation of aldehydes and ketones, and the in situ generated ˙OOH intermediate is regarded as the active species.
 Scheme 7 
Generally, O2 is used as an electron acceptor in the photocatalytic oxidative reaction. However, Chen79 recently reported that aromatic alcohols could be oxidized to aromatic aldehydes using a CdS/g-C3N4 composite as photocatalyst and nitrobenzene instead of O2 as the electron acceptor under visible-light irradiation (Scheme 8). The photogenerated hole produced by the excited CdS migrates to the g-C3N4 valence band and the CdS conduction band receives an electron generated by the excited g-C3N4 at the same time. Subsequently, nitrobenzene was reduced on the surface of CdS, and aromatic alcohols absorbed on g-C3N4 were oxidized. In comparison, when using the single CdS or g-C3N4 photocatalyst, the conversions and yields in the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline were lower than those with the CdS/g-C3N4 composite catalyst. And when the ratio of CdS to g-C3N4 was 10%, the catalytic performance was optimal. Besides, Higashimoto80 reported that the CdS–TiO2 composite visible light photocatalyst with 15% CdS could also catalyze the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline simultaneously.
 Scheme 8 
H2O is regarded as an ideal solvent in organic reactions. However, the problem is that the semiconductor valence band hole may oxidize H2O to form the highly active OH radical under photocatalytic conditions, thus making the reaction system become complicated and uncontrollable. The inherent reduction potential of the Bi2WO6 photocatalyst valence band is +1.77 V vs. Ag/AgCl,79 which is more negative than the H2O/˙OH reduction potential. So when Bi2WO6 is used as a catalyst, water as solvent is feasible. Recently, a Bi2WO6/H2O/air system was successfully applied to the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes (Scheme 9).81
 Scheme 9 
Nanogold plasmonic photocatalysts can also be applied in the light catalytic selective oxidation of alcohols in the visible region due to the LSPR effect of plasmonic nanoparticles. Tanaka47 successfully realized the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols under green light (λ = 530 nm) radiation by using CeO2 as the support (Scheme 10). In this case, the conduction band of reducible CeO2 could accept electrons from the excited Au nanoparticles, and the as-formed electron-deficient Au can directly catalyze the oxidation of alcohols. Au nanoparticles also possess the ability to decompose the active oxygen species H2O282 which is generated by the injection of electrons from the conduction band of CeO2 into O2 and is preferable to the formation of ˙O2− radical formed by the one-electron reduction of O2. So in this system, the high selectivity of benzaldehyde may be attributed to the decomposition of the active oxygen species by Au nanoparticles. Except for aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols also can be selectively oxidized to carbonyl compounds by an Au/CeO2 visible light photocatalyst,83 and the chain or cyclic secondary alcohols were oxidized to the corresponding ketones.
 Scheme 10 
The process of a hot electron being injected from the plasmonic-metal irradiated by visible light into the support is the critical procedure in organic synthesis under photocatalysis. Hence, the metal/semiconductor interface will play an important role in transferring electrons. Recently, Shiraishi reported that Pt nanoparticles could be excited by visible light due to the LSPR effect (Scheme 11).84 The catalyst, with a low Schottky barrier and a large number of perimeter Pt atoms, might favour the electron transferring from Pt to TiO2 through control of the amount and size of the Pt particles. In addition to this, a great effort by Shiraishi was made to increase the efficiency of electron transfer at the metal/semiconductor interface, such as through the loading of Au–Cu and Pt–Cu alloys on anatase TiO2, etc.85–88 So, facilitating electron transfer at the interface to improve the photocatalytic activity is of significance.
 Scheme 11 
Recent research revealed the great influence of the property of the substrates on the yield of the product besides the nature of the photocatalysts in photocatalysis. For example, Zhang89 reported that Au nanoparticles supported on a Y-type zeolite could catalyze the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols (Scheme 12). The results showed that the regular porous molecular sieve as the support could gather the reactants, and the conversion was related to the polarity of the reactant molecules.
 Scheme 12 
Different supports have distinctive effects. When inert SiO2 was used as the support for Au nanoparticles with H2O2 as the terminal oxidant, Au/SiO2 could catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzyl alcohol and morpholine to afford 4-benzoylmorpholine under λ = 532 nm visible radiation. Benzyl alcohol was first oxidized to benzaldehyde by photocatalysis, then the formation of amide compounds took place (Scheme 13).55
 Scheme 13 
The activation condition for the saturated sp3 C–H bond is very harsh, which causes difficulty in controlling the selectivity of the reaction. Under visible-light irradiation, cubic phase, sheet shaped semiconductor CdS90 can catalyze the oxidation of toluene and its derivatives to the corresponding aldehydes (Scheme 14). This CdS has the characteristics of a large surface area and high light-induced charge carrier separation efficiency, making the selectivity for aldehyde 100%. Toluene was oxidized to the corresponding radical cation and O2 was reduced to the corresponding superoxide radical anion in the CdS valence and conduction band, respectively. Subsequently, two active species were combined to produce benzaldehyde.
 Scheme 14 
2.2 Oxidation of amines
The oxidation of amines is an important chemical transformation, and is one of the key steps in the synthesis of drug and pesticide intermediates.91,92 A stoichiometric strong oxidant, such as 2-iodylbenzoic acid93 or N-tert-butylbenzenesulfinimidoyl chloride94 is generally required for the oxidation process. Recently, heterogeneous visible light photocatalysts have been widely used in the selective oxidation of amines. O2 is used as the oxidant to accept electrons under photocatalysis, and this fully embodies the advantages of visible-light photocatalysis.
Zhao45 and Tanaka46 reported that under conditions of visible light and O2, TiO2 or Nb2O5 can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of amines (Scheme 15). Although the large band gap of TiO2 and Nb2O5 catalysts limits their applications in the visible region, these catalysts could react with amines to generate surface complex species which are competent in absorbing visible light. The 2p orbital of the nitrogen atom of the surface complex, whose energy level is higher than the conduction band of TiO2 or Nb2O5, can serve as the donor energy level. The surface complexes were excited by visible light and transfer electrons to the conduction band of TiO2 or Nb2O5. Based on these, Nb2O5 can not only catalyze the conversion of primary amines to imines, but can also act on secondary amines and cyclic amines (Scheme 15).
 Scheme 15 
Compared with other TiO2 crystal structures such as rutile, brookite, and TiO2(B), anatase TiO2 has a higher photocatalytic activity.95 However, the wire-like crystal of a mixed-phase photocatalyst composed of 65% TiO2(B) crystal form and 35% anatase TiO2 exhibits better efficiency in the catalytic oxidation of amines than single-phase anatase TiO2 or TiO2(B).96 The surface phase junction of the TiO2 mixed-phase photocatalyst facilitated charge carrier separation, and thus improved the photocatalytic activity (Scheme 16).
 Scheme 16 
CdS, as a small band gap semiconductor photocatalyst, without doping and surface modification, could display a response in the visible region. Zhang97 reported the oxidation of benzylamine derivatives to imines by porous single crystal CdS (Scheme 17). The high specific surface area and unique crystal surface exposure of the porous single crystal CdS nanocrystals were responsible for the high catalytic activity.
 Scheme 17 
Although the yield of oxidative coupling of primary amines to imines is very high, the oxidation of secondary amines to imines is not efficient by using a metal oxide or sulfide semiconductor as the photocatalyst. Recently, Li developed new Bi-based semiconductor photocatalysts, such as BiOCl and98 BiVO4,99 for the oxidation of secondary amines to imines; the conversion and selectivity could reach more than 93% and 90% respectively (Scheme 18), and under the same conditions the effects of TiO245 and Nb2O546 are poor.
 Scheme 18 
Novel material MOFs have great potential in the synthesis of imines, and MIL-100(Fe), MOF-253 and other MOFs have been applied to the catalytic oxidation of amines.100,101 Recently, Li37 reported that the MOFs NH2–MIL-125(Ti) could catalyze the oxidation of amines in the presence of visible light and O2 (Scheme 19). Ti3+ species were formed due to an electron transferring from the ligand to the Ti–O oxo-clusters of NH2–MIL-125(Ti) by the LMCT mechanism. The Ti3+ species were believed to play a very important role in the oxidation of amines.
 Scheme 19 
Wang102 reported that the mpg-C3N4 organic photocatalyst can catalyze the selective oxidation of amines. With O2 as the oxidant, primary amines can be oxidatively coupled to form imines at 80 °C and a good result can also be achieved by using cyclic amines under these conditions (Scheme 20). The catalytic performance of mpg-C3N4 was better than Nb2O546 described above. The temperature of 80 °C is a necessary condition for high conversion, because the transformation of the amines decreases with a decrease in temperature. When the temperature drops to 30 °C, the conversion of benzylamines was only 13%.
 Scheme 20 
Through the use of plasmon Au nanoparticles loaded on the rutile phase TiO2 as a photocatalyst,103 the selectivity of the oxidation of amines to imines could reach 99% (Scheme 21). Although surface complexes can be generated from the interaction of amines with the TiO2 surface and thus result in a visible-light response, experimental results showed that the in situ formed surface complexes of the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts exhibited a very weak absorption in the visible region. The visible-light response is mainly caused by the LSPR effect of Au nanoparticles.
 Scheme 21 
The electronic heterogeneity of the surface of Au–Pd alloy nanoparticles that stems from the difference in the electronegativity of Au and Pd causes the surface charge distribution of the Au–Pd nanoparticles to be un-uniform.104,105 This characteristic is beneficial in improving the interaction between the alloy and the reactant, in which Au nanoparticles serve as the plasmonic-metal excited by visible-light, and Pd nanoparticles act as the catalytic active sites directly. By utilizing this feature, an Au–Pd alloy loaded on inert ZrO2 was applied to the selective oxidation of the amines (Scheme 22).106
 Scheme 22 
For some organic reactions, the desired products may convert into byproducts when the reaction temperature is high. The oxidation of aniline to nitrosobenzene is a typical example, where aniline and nitrosobenzene formed in situ could condense and transform into the undesired azobenzene at high temperature.107 Recently, under visible light irradiation, nitrosobenzene was synthesized from aniline by a Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst at room temperature, which is unfavourable for the formation of the azobenzene (Scheme 23).108
 Scheme 23 
The activation and functionalization of the ortho sp3 C–H bond adjacent to the nitrogen atom of a tertiary amine by photocatalysis is an important pathway for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds. Secondary amines are usually used as a substrate in the traditional Mannich reaction,109 however, photocatalysis based on the SET mechanism could use the tertiary amine as the starting material.
Under the irradiation of a 11 W fluorescent lamp and catalysed by TiO2, Rueping110 reported that N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives could be oxidized to give iminium ion intermediates which subsequently coupled with nucleophilic compounds such as nitromethane, KCN, etc. (Scheme 24). By the co-catalysis of TiO2 and L-proline, N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives with acetone could also undergo the Mannich reaction. The enamine formed by L-proline with acetone can increase the nucleophilicity of the ketone, thereby improving the yield of β-amino ketone.
 Scheme 24 
When excited by visible light, ZnO can also catalyze the activation of the ortho sp3 C–H bond adjacent to the nitrogen atom of N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives (Scheme 25),110 and then the coupling with diethyl phosphite to synthesize high valuable α-aminophosphonate derivatives.
 Scheme 25 
The choice of solvents sometimes may influence the yield of products. When the polycrystalline CdS as a visible light photocatalyst was applied to the oxidative coupling of N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives with nitromethane under irradiation of λ = 440 nm visible light (Scheme 26), the solvent was shown to be an important factor. The use of nitromethane as a co-solvent (CH3CN:CH3NO2 = 1:2) instead of single solvent CH3CN can effectively prevent the dimerization reaction of benzyl radicals generated by photocatalysis.111
 Scheme 26 
When mpg-C3N4 was used as photocatalyst,112 a higher oxygen pressure was required for the oxidation of tertiary amines to the iminium cation, which was then coupled with the nucleophiles of nitroalkanes or dimethyl malonate (Scheme 27). A Mannich-type reaction of a tertiary amine and ketone could successfully be performed under the co-catalysis of L-proline and mpg-C3N4. With 2-pentone with more steric hindrance replacing acetone, the yield dropped sharply to 44%.
 Scheme 27 
Generally speaking, for the reaction of an iminium cation intermediate and a weak nucleophilic reagent, it is difficult to achieve an ideal result. But recently, Blechert113 realized the coupling reaction of N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinoline with the weak nucleophilic allyl or allenyl stannane by using mpg-C3N4 as the photocatalyst and air as the oxidant (Scheme 28). Through improvements such as using air instead of pure oxygen, and methanol as a solvent, as well as reducing the concentration of the reaction mixture and excess amount of stannane, all of these measures could increase the collision probability of the weak nucleophilic allyl or allenyl stannane with the electrophilic iminium cation, and thus greatly enhance the product yield.
 Scheme 28 
Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2PF6 were employed as homogeneous photocatalysts to catalyze the aza-Henry reaction, which was developed by Stephenson114 in 2010. Although a high yield could be achieved, the drawback of this reaction system is the difficulty in the recycling of the photocatalysts. Novel porous cross-linked polymers (PCPs) using phosphorescent [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]3+ as the building blocks designed by Lin38 can efficiently catalyze the aza-Henry reaction between nitromethane and N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinoline under visible-light irradiation (Scheme 29). This catalyst not only showed excellent photocatalytic activity, but it can also be highly stable and recyclable, which is superior to the homogeneous Ru and Ir complex photocatalysts.
 Scheme 29 
Zhao39 reported a new type of KIT-1-B photocatalyst which was synthesized by immobilization of the homogeneous organic photocatalyst iodo-Bodipy on the siliceous mesoporous molecular sieve KIT-1. Under visible-light irradiation and catalyzed by KIT-1-B, tetrahydroisoquinoline and N-phenylmaleimide could undergo a [3 + 2] dipolar cycloaddition reaction to generate pyrrolo[2,1-a] isoquinoline compounds (Scheme 30). The experimental results showed that the immobilization of the organic light catalyst did not inhibit the single electron transfer between the photocatalyst and substrate, and eventually achieved high catalytic performance.
 Scheme 30 
Besides ion doping and dye-sensitization, surface modification of TiO2 is another expedient method for extending the TiO2 light response to the visible light region. Highly dispersed NiO particles can be used as a surface modification agent. NiO/TiO2 can catalyze the cyclization reaction of N,N-dimethylaniline derivatives with maleimide (Scheme 31) under visible-light irradiation.115N,N-dimethylaniline derivatives firstly underwent oxidative dehydrogenation by the TiO2 valence band hole to generate α-amino alkyl radical intermediates, which subsequently added to maleimide to produce new radicals, and finally intramolecular cyclization and dehydrogenation took place to give the target products.
 Scheme 31 
Catalyzed by TiO2, α-amino substituted amide compounds could be synthesized through the three component coupling reaction of tertiary amine, isocyanide, and water (Scheme 32).116 The maximum light absorption wavelength of TiO2 shifted towards a longer wavelength due to the interaction of the tertiary amine with the TiO2 surface functional group. The strong nucleophilic carbon of isocyanide attacked the iminium cation generated by the oxidation of tertiary amines, and subsequently hydrolysed to give the product.
 Scheme 32 
2.3 Carbon–carbon bond formation reactions
Cross-coupling reactions meet the requirement of atom economy,117–119 and recently photoredox catalysis, as a new type of green catalytic method, has been gradually applied to the cross-coupling reaction. The co-catalysis of a homogeneous visible light catalyst and chiral amine developed by MacMillan could realize the enantioselective α-alkylation of aldehyde.120 In order to avoid the use of a precious metal homogeneous photocatalyst and the succeeding troublesome work-up, the use of a suitable semiconductor visible light catalyst PbBiO2Br121 instead of a noble metal catalyst could also catalyze the above reaction with almost the same yield and ee value (Scheme 33). At 440 nm light irradiation, the photoinduced electron from the excited PbBiO2Br semiconductor transferred to the halogenated carbonyl compounds to generate an α-carbonyl radical and bromine anion, then the α-carbonyl radical attacked the enamine produced in situ by the secondary amine chiral catalyst and aldehyde to form an α-amino radical which can be oxidized by the semiconductor valence band hole to form iminium cations, and eventually release the α-alkylation products of aldehyde and organic amine catalyst. When α-bromide carbonyl compounds were used as the alkylation reagent, the combination of semiconductor Bi2O3 and organic catalyst could also catalyze the enantioselective alkylation of aldehyde.122
 Scheme 33 
Catalyzed by homogeneous Ru and Ir complexes under visible-light irradiation, the atom transfer free radical addition reaction (ATRA) has been reported by Stephenson.123 Recently, heterogeneous Bi2O3 was used as an ATRA reaction catalyst (Scheme 34).124 The α-bromide carbonyl compounds were first reduced to alkyl radicals and a bromine anion, then the radicals attacked the double bond of terminal olefins to form new alkyl radicals. The newly generated radicals may react through two reaction paths: the first is that the radicals are oxidized by the Bi2O3 valence band hole to form carbonium ion intermediates and subsequently react with bromine anion to give the final products, and the second is the free radical chain growth path in which the radicals directly capture a bromine atom to form α-bromide carbonyl compounds.
 Scheme 34 
The direct arylation of heterocyclic compounds such as furan, pyridine, etc. has been implemented in homogeneous photocatalysis system.125 Recently Rueping126 used the cheaper, non-toxic TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalyst to realize this reaction (Scheme 35). TiO2 in this system may play a dual role; the first is that TiO2, as a general thermodynamic catalyst, catalyzed the reaction of aryl diazonium salts with ethanol to give azoether compounds which subsequently underwent transetherification to generate a TiO2–azoether species, and this species can be excited by visible light and transfer an electron to TiO2. The second is as a photocatalyst, reducing azoether compounds to generate electron deficient aryl radicals, which add to the heterocyclic compound giving new free radicals and then transform into a carbonium ion by a free radical chain reaction or TiO2 hole oxidation, and eventually rearomatization occurs to afford the heterocyclic aryl products.
 Scheme 35 
In the above section, we have discussed the application of porous cross-linked polymers (PCPs) to the aza-Henry reaction designed by Lin.38 Besides this, Ru–PCPs could catalyze the α-arylation of bromomalonate (Scheme 36) and oxyamination of 3-phenylpropanal. Moreover, the results showed this photocatalyst could be reused several times and still maintain considerably high activity.
 Scheme 36 
Fluorine-containing compounds have been widely used in medicine, pesticides, and materials.127–129 Introducing a fluorine atom into organic compounds has been a hot research field in organic synthesis. MacMillan130 directly introduced the CF3 group into aromatic hydrocarbons by homogeneous photocatalysis. Subsequently, by using mpg-C3N4 as a visible light catalyst and CF3SO2Cl as a CF3 radical precursor, Blechert successfully achieved the trifluoromethylation of aromatics (Scheme 37).131
 Scheme 37 
Stephenson132 reported the intramolecular radical cyclization reaction of bromide malonic ester with double bonds. Recently, using the mpg-C3N4 heterogeneous system, this reaction has also been successfully realized (Scheme 38).133
 Scheme 38 
Palladium is widely used as a catalyst in organic synthesis.134,135 The palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction is one of the important methods for the synthesis of biaryls.136 Recently, Wang137 found that Au–Pd nanostructures had a very good catalytic effect on the Suzuki coupling reaction under the irradiation of a Xe lamp (Scheme 39). Plasmon nano Au could absorb visible light by the LSPR effect, and Pd was used as a direct catalyst for the catalytic reaction. Control experiments showed that the light absorption of plasmon nano Au greatly improved the efficiency of the catalytic reaction.
 Scheme 39 
Huang138 synthesized AuPd nanowheels with a core–shell structure, where the key characteristic of this material was that the Au nanoparticle cores were surrounded by Pd. The interaction between Au and Pd was considered to be responsible for the better catalytic efficiency in the Suzuki coupling reaction than the pure Pd catalyst (Scheme 40).
 Scheme 40 
An Au–Pd alloy nanomaterial could also catalyze the Suzuki coupling reaction under visible light irradiation (Scheme 41). The catalytic efficiency was at an optimum when the ratio of Au and Pd was 1:1.62.139 Furthermore, the application of Au–Pd alloy was not only limited to the Suzuki cross coupling reaction; it was also proved to have good catalytic activity in other reactions, such as Sonogashira, Stille, Hiyama, Ullmann and Buchwald–Hartwig reactions.140 The co-catalysis of the nano Au plasmon and metal Pd is beneficial in improving the conversion and selectivity.
 Scheme 41 
The three component reaction of aldehyde, amine, phenylacetylene to synthesize propargylamines can be realized through the LSPR effect of Au nanoparticles loaded on a ZnO support under visible-light irradiation (Scheme 42).141 The interaction of the support and phenylacetylene is a necessary condition for the high yield of propargylamines. Compared with TiO2 and Al2O3 as supports, the interaction between ZnO and phenylacetylene is stronger, which is more favourable for the adsorption of phenylacetylene.
 Scheme 42 
2.4 Carbon–hetero bond formation reactions
The concept of synergistic oxygen-requiring photocatalysis has recently been proposed by Lang,142 in which two seemingly unrelated reactions could be coupled in the same photocatalytic system. For example, through the use of TiO2 as a photocatalyst, sulfide is oxidized to sulfoxide and amine reacts with methanol to give amide in the presence of O2 (Scheme 43). By visible-light excitation, the complexes formed by amine adsorption on the TiO2 surface will transfer electrons to the TiO2 and the positive charge left oxidizes the sulfide itself to generate the S-center radical cation surface complex species. Under the action of the oxygen, the S-center surface complexes are transformed into sulfoxide and methanol is oxidized to form formaldehyde which reacts with amine to give an intermediate. Eventually the amide could be obtained by the decomposition of the intermediate under photocatalytic conditions.
 Scheme 43 
Using TiO2 as a photocatalyst, the catalytic oxidation and sulfonation of n-heptane was performed when the volume ratio of SO2 and O2 was 1:1 (Scheme 44).143,144 TiO2 powder exposed to an atmosphere of SO2 could turn into a yellow charge-transfer complex, which had a response in the 400–420 nm visible region.
 Scheme 44 
The thiol–ene reaction is an important method for the construction of C–S bond,145 although the thiol–ene reaction needs be carried out under UV radiation directly. Greaney146 reported the success of using TiO2 to catalyze the thiol–ene reaction under visible-light irradiation (Scheme 45). RSH and ROH have analogous physical and chemical properties such as being able to adsorb on the TiO2 surface to form a complex68,69 and thus extend the TiO2 light response wavelength to the visible light region. Thiol is oxidized by a TiO2 valence band electron and loses a proton to generate an RS radical which is then added to the double bond of an alkene to produce a new alkyl radical. Eventually, the alkyl radical captures the hydrogen of the thiol to generate a new free radical and the target product.
 Scheme 45 
Recently Wang147 reported that the use of a g-C3N4 semiconductor photocatalyst doped by the transition metal iron could selectively oxidize benzene to phenol in the presence of H2O2 (Scheme 46). H2O2 is the donor of the phenolic hydroxyl group, and iron may play an important role in the reduction of H2O2 to the OH radical. The large surface area of SBA-15 as Fe–g-C3N4 support also helps to improve the conversion of benzene.
 Scheme 46 
Conclusions
In short, the application of heterogeneous visible light catalysts in organic reactions is not only confined to the conversion of organic functional groups, but also the catalyzation of the complex carbon–carbon and carbon–hetero coupling reaction. Besides its many advantages, heterogeneous photocatalysis is still not ideal from the view of catalytic activity and selectivity, which thus has limited its application in organic synthesis.
Combination of the advantages of heterogeneous and homogeneous visible light catalysts may be a hot research topic in the future. The high selectivity of the products can be achieved by the synergistic catalysis of different catalysts. For example, the introduction of an organic chiral catalyst into the heterogeneous catalytic system can enhance the selectivity of the product. At the same time, the design and discovery of new heterogeneous catalysts is also an important direction in the future.
