    , Accepted 5th August 2019First published on 7th August 2019AbstractThe past few decades have witnessed rapid advances in two dimensional (2D) materials as they carry a stellar set of unique properties over their bulk counterparts. Two families of 2D materials, namely, layered 2D materials and nonlayered 2D materials, have garnered considerable attention. Layered 2D materials have been widely used in electronic devices, catalysis, and bioelectronics due to their tunable energy band structure, and superlative physical and chemical properties. By contrast, dangling bonds on the surface of non-layered 2D materials and intrinsic crystal distortion endow them with abundant active sites for use in energy storage and photodetectors. In this context, the ability to effectively exfoliate 2D materials is the key to these applications. This review highlights the recent developments pertaining to exfoliation techniques applicable to 2D layered and non-layered materials and the corresponding exfoliation mechanisms. In particular, some emerging exfoliation techniques are emphasized. Subsequently, how these exfoliation techniques facilitate the application of 2D materials in electronic devices, catalysis, batteries, and supercapacitors is summarized.

1. Introduction
Since the successful exfoliation of atomically thin graphene from graphite in 2004,1 two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a topical subject of research. As the first-discovered 2D material, graphene possesses superlative physical, optical, chemical and electronic properties, such as the ultrahigh carrier mobility at room-temperature,1 high mechanical strength,2 quantum hall effect,3 high optical transparency,4 ultrahigh specific surface area,5 and excellent electrical and thermal conductivities.1,6 However, the zero-band gap and quasi metal features of graphene limit its applications.7 To overcome the disadvantages of graphene, a series of layered 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), layered metal oxides, MXenes, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), black phosphorus (BP), group III–VI compounds like In2Se3, GaS, and GaSe, and group V–VI compounds like Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, have been widely explored.8–13 These materials range from insulators to metals, making them suitable for many applications.8,9,13–16 For example, few-layer h-BN is utilized as a charge leakage barrier layer in electronic devices because of the ultrawide band gap (i.e., 5.92 eV);8,17 monolayer MoS2 is exploited in photovoltaic devices and photocatalysis due to the narrow band gap (i.e., 1.9 eV);18–20 and silicene is employed in field-effect transistors (FET) owing to its conductivity.21,22 Inspired by layered 2D materials, recent research has centred on delamination of non-layered materials into 2D structures, such as metal oxides (Fe2O3, Mn3O4, ZnMn2O4, WO3, etc.) and metal chalcogenides (CdS, PbS, Cu9S5, CuInS2, etc.).23–26 Compared with layered 2D materials, non-layered 2D materials carry abundant dangling bonds on the surface and noticeable crystal structure distortion.23 As a result of their distinctive electronic properties, 2D nonlayered materials have found applications in flexible optoelectronic devices,27 broadband photodetection,28 ultrafast photonics,29 and phototransistors.30
Owing to the promising prospect of 2D materials, it is highly desirable to obtain high-quality 2D materials from their bulk counterparts via suitable preparative methods. To this end, various exfoliation approaches, such as micromechanical cleavage (i.e., the Scotch tape method),1,31,32 mechanical liquid exfoliation (e.g., shear-assisted liquid exfoliation, sonication-assisted liquid exfoliation, etc.),29,33 ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation,34,35 ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation,36,37 oxidation-assisted liquid exfoliation,38,39 and selective erosion-assisted liquid exfoliation,40,41 have been developed. Micromechanical cleavage is one of the most commonly used techniques for device applications, including symmetric pseudocapacitors,42 gas sensors,43 ultrasensitive photodetectors,44 and phototransistors.45 However, it is labor intensive and has low production rate.46 Liquid exfoliation techniques enable comparably high yield of 2D materials for use in imaging-guided cancer therapy,47 noncontact sensing devices,48 all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors,49 and catalysis.50 However, it is impossible to exfoliate all the layered materials from their bulk counterparts via a certain liquid exfoliation route. For example, oxidation-assisted exfoliation is applicable to the preparation of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, yet difficult to exfoliate other layered materials.46 Moreover, all of the well-established exfoliation methods noted above are limited to layered 2D crystals instead of non-layered 2D compounds.46
To date, some novel exfoliation techniques have been developed to yield non-layered materials. Photochemical-assisted exfoliation is reported to be an effective technique for preparing non-layered 2D metal chalcogenide nanosheets (e.g., CdS, PbS, Cu9S5, etc.).24 Gel-blowing exfoliation and animal protein-assisted exfoliation methods are suitable to exfoliate non-layered metal oxides, including Fe2O3, Mn3O4, ZnMn2O4, WO3, etc.25,26 In addition, some facile and green exfoliation techniques (e.g., Ostwald ripening,47 liquid nitrogen-assisted route,51 pure water exfoliation,52 bacterial etching,53 amphiphile-assisted route,54etc.) will be discussed in this review.
After a brief discussion that motivates the study of 2D materials as described above, this review aims to summarize recent advances in eleven exfoliation techniques for both layered and non-layered 2D materials and their corresponding exfoliation mechanisms. Specifically, some appealing exfoliation routes are emphasized. Subsequently, the applications of 2D materials yielded by the aforementioned exfoliation routes are discussed, including electronic devices, catalysis, batteries and supercapacitors. Finally, a summary and perspective on future development of exfoliation techniques are provided.
2. Exfoliation techniques of 2D layered and non-layered materials
2.1. Well-established exfoliation methods
Well-established exfoliation methods can be divided into micromechanical cleavage and liquid exfoliation methods. Micromechanical cleavage is performed using Scotch tape to yield layered 2D materials.46,55 Liquid exfoliation methods include mechanical liquid exfoliation,33,56,57 ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation,34,35,56,58,59 ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation,36,37,56 electrochemical lithiation and delithiation exfoliation,59 oxidation-assisted liquid exfoliation,38,39 and selective erosion-assisted liquid exfoliation (Table 1).40,41

Low yield


Mechanical liquid exfoliation
Exfoliating layered materials in liquid solution via appropriate mechanical force (i.e., sonication and shear-force) to break the van der Waals force between different layers of bulk crystals
Graphene,69 h-BN,70 TMDs (e.g., MoS2,33 MoSe2,33 MoTe2,71 WS2,33 NbSe2,33 TaS2,72 and VS2(ref. 73)), TMOs (e.g., MoO3,74 hydrated-WO3,75 MnO2,76etc.), BP,77 MOFs,78–83 and COFs.84–87
High yield and suitable for large-scale production
It is hard to choose a suitable solvent to match the surface energy of the layered bulk crystals


Ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation
Bringing small ions, such as Li+, Na+, and K+, into the interspacing of adjacent layers of bulk materials to expand the interspacing and weaken the van der Waals force between adjacent layers of 2D materials
Graphene,88 h-BN,35 TMDs (e.g., MoS2,34 MoS2xSe2(1−x),89 WS2,34 WSe2,35 TiS2,34 TaS2,34 ZrS2,34 NbSe2,35 and MoxW1−xS2 (ref. 89)), and metal chalcogenides (e.g., Sb2Se3,35 Bi2Te3,35 Ta2NiS5,90 and Ta2NiSe5 (ref. 90))
High yield, and as-obtained nanosheets are positively charged with a clean surface
Time consuming, relatively small lateral size of obtained nanosheets (less than 1 μm)


Ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation
Utilizing larger ions to replace small ions in pristine layered crystals. Thus, the interspacing of adjacent layers expands and the van der Waals force between them weakens. Then 2D flakes are obtained via sonication or mechanical shaking
Layered metal oxides (e.g., Cs0.7Ti1.825O4,91 K0.45MnO2,92 and KCa2Nb3O10 (ref. 93)), LDHs (typical formula is M1−xMx(OH)2Ax/n·yH2O, M = Zn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+; M = Fe3+, Co3+, Al3+; and A = CO32−, Cl−, NO3−, ClO4−),94,95 and metal phosphorus trichalcogenides (i.e., MnPS3,96 CdPS3,96 Mn0.8PS3,97 and Cd0.8PS3 (ref. 97))

Selective erosion-assisted liquid exfoliation
A strong etching agent (e.g., hydrofluoric acid, mixture of fluoride salts and HCl/H2SO4, etc.) is applied to selectively etch A layers without breaking the bonds in Mn+1Xn planes. After removing A layers, the remaining bulk materials are composed of loosely piled Mn+1Xn layers, which can be easily exfoliated into atomically thin 2D flakes via sonication treatment
MXenes (e.g., Ti3C2,41 Ti2C,100 Nb2C,101 Ti4N3,102 V2C,101 (Ti0.5, Nb0.5)2C,40 (V0.5, Cr0.5)3C2,40 Ta4C3,40 Mo2TiC2,103 Mo2Ti2C3,103 Mo2CTx,103 Cr2TiC2,104 and Al3C3 (ref. 104))

Utilization of strong oxidizing agents, making this technique not safe. Only applicable to certain kinds of materials





2.1.1. Micromechanical cleavage exfoliation. 
The mechanism of this approach is to apply mechanical force via Scotch tape to break the van der Waals force between the interlayers of bulk crystals without breaking the in-plane covalent bonds, and thus atomically thin layered 2D materials are obtained.57,60 To date, this method is available for preparing many layered 2D materials like TMDs (e.g., MoxW1−xS2,61 TaS2,62 TaSe2,62 MoS2,31 WSe2,31,55 MoTe2,63 and ReS2 (ref. 64)), topological insulators (e.g., Bi2Te3,65 Bi2Se3,66 and Sb2Te3 (ref. 67)), graphene,55 and metal phosphorus trichalcogenides (e.g., MPS3, M = Fe, Mn, Ni, Cd, and Zn).68


2.1.2. Mechanical liquid exfoliation. 
The mechanical liquid exfoliation method uses sonication or shear-force to craft layered 2D materials in the liquid environment. Similar to micromechanical cleavage exfoliation, the mechanism of this method is also utilization of appropriate mechanical force to break the van der Waals force between different layers of bulk crystals. Nowadays, this method is being used to craft graphene,69 h-BN,70 TMDs (e.g., MoS2,33 MoSe2,33 MoTe2,71 WS2,33 NbSe2,33 TaS2,72 and VS2 (ref. 73)), transition metal oxides (TMOs, e.g., MoO3,74 hydrated-WO3,75 MnO2,76etc.), BP,77 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),78–83 and covalent organic frameworks (COFs).84–87


2.1.3. Electrochemical exfoliation. 
Electrochemical exfoliation is a normal and controllable method via a liquid electrolyte and an applied potential to promote the expansion of interlayers.59
2.1.3.1. Ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation. 
This route introduces ions of small radius, such as Li+, Na+, and K+, into the spacing between interlayers of bulk crystals to form ion-intercalated compounds via an electrochemical process. The ion intercalation can expand the interspacing and weaken the van der Waals force between adjacent layers of bulk materials. After that, the ion-intercalated layered crystals could be easily delaminated into atomically thin nanosheets under sonication treatment in aqueous solution. This approach has been utilized to yield graphene,88 h-BN,35 TMDs (e.g., MoS2,34 MoS2xSe2(1−x),89 WS2,34 WSe2,35 TiS2,34 TaS2,34 ZrS2,34 NbSe2,35 and MoxW1−xS2 (ref. 89)), and metal chalcogenides (e.g., Sb2Se3,35 Bi2Te3,35 Ta2NiS5,90 and Ta2NiSe5 (ref. 90)).
2.1.3.2. Ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation. 
Unlike ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation, this technique replaces ions of small radius in the original layered crystals with ions of larger size through an electrochemical process. After this process, the interlayer spacing of layered bulk materials is obviously expanded, thus weakening the interaction between interlayers of bulk crystals. Then the ion-exchanged compounds can be easily delaminated into 2D nanosheets with the help of mechanical force, such as mechanical shaking or sonication. Ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation is an effective method, which is available for the exfoliation of layered metal oxides (e.g., Cs0.7Ti1.825O4,91 K0·45MnO2,92 and KCa2Nb3O10 (ref. 93)), LDHs (typical formula is M1−xMx(OH)2Ax/n·yH2O, M = Zn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+; M = Fe3+, Co3+, Al3+; and A = CO32−, Cl−, NO3−, ClO4−),94,95 and metal phosphorus trichalcogenides (i.e., MnPS3,96 CdPS3,96 Mn0.8PS3,97 and Cd0.8PS3 (ref. 97)).
2.1.3.3. Electrochemical lithiation and delithiation exfoliation. 
This method is available for obtaining few-layered silicene nanosheets from ball-milled silicon nanopowder.98 Delithiation solvent is the key to control the rate of delithiation.59 When using deionized water as the delithiation solvent, the exfoliated films tend to re-assemble into the bulk. It is proposed that in isopropyl alcohol, lithium is drawn slowly but completely from lithiated Si nanopowder. This slow process enables the newly formed surface to be functionalized, avoiding re-assembling of the as-exfoliated silicene nanosheets. Therefore, few-layered silicene nanosheets can be successfully prepared. Unfortunately, the exact exfoliation mechanism of this method is still unknown.59


2.1.4. Selective erosion-assisted liquid exfoliation. 
MXenes can be obtained facilely from MAX in aqueous solution via this method. MAX is represented by the formula Mn+1AXn (n = 1, 2, or 3), where M, A and X refer to early transition metals, elements of group IIIA or IVA, and carbon and/or nitrogen, respectively. As Mn+1Xn layers are combined by metal A, the metallic bonding between adjacent layers of Mn+1AXn phases is remarkably stronger than van der Waals force in the aforesaid layered materials.46 Therefore, the methods mentioned in previous sections are not suitable for crafting MXenes.46 In this exfoliation process, a strong etching agent (e.g., hydrofluoric acid,41 mixture of fluoride salts and HCl/H2SO4,99etc.) is applied to selectively etch the A layers without breaking the bonds in Mn+1Xn planes. After removing the A layers, the remaining bulk materials are composed of loosely piled Mn+1Xn layers, which can be easily exfoliated into atomically thin 2D flakes via sonication treatment. This method has been used to craft many kinds of MXenes (e.g., Ti3C2,41 Ti2C,100 Nb2C,101 Ti4N3,102 V2C,101 (Ti0.5, Nb0.5)2C,40 (V0.5, Cr0.5)3C2,40 Ta4C3,40 Mo2TiC2,103 Mo2Ti2C3,103 Mo2CTx,103 Cr2TiC2,104 and Al3C3 (ref. 104)).


2.1.5. Oxidation-assisted liquid exfoliation. 
This is a technique that allows for obtaining single-layer graphene oxide with the help of strong oxidizing agents. After being oxidized, each surface of layered graphite is decorated with abundant oxygen-containing groups,105,106 which can significantly expand the interspacing between different layers of graphite and thus weaken the van der Waals force between adjacent layers.39 After sonication treatment, atomically thin graphene oxide is obtained.46 However, the technique is not environmentally friendly owing to the utilization of strong oxidizing agents.39

2.2. Green chemistry routes
Herein, the definition of green chemistry routes is exfoliation of bulk materials into 2D nanosheets without using or generating environmental pollutants and hazardous substances.84,107 We divide green chemistry exfoliation techniques into four categories including the supercritical fluid method, Ostwald ripening method, ultralow temperature liquid nitrogen-assisted technique, and pure water route.

2.2.1. Supercritical fluid method. 
In this section, supercritical fluid (SCF) refers to supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2). According to the definition of SCF, the SC CO2 phenomenon happens when the temperature and pressure are above the critical point of CO2.108 SCF exhibits some superb physical properties (for example, zero surface tension, high flowability, etc.).109 These superior physical properties can be used to craft 2D nanomaterials from their bulk counterparts.110 Compared with conventional liquid-exfoliation, SC CO2-assisted liquid exfoliation methods have advantages in terms of nontoxic substance production and utilization.110 According to different exfoliation mechanisms, SC CO2-assisted liquid exfoliation methods can be classified into three types, that is, ultrasonic wave/shear-assisted exfoliation, reverse-micelle-induced exfoliation, and Pickering emulsion-induced exfoliation.
2.2.1.1. Ultrasonic wave-assisted exfoliation. 
The aforementioned well-established liquid exfoliation methods are available to craft graphene but suffer from disadvantages such as being time-consuming and low yields.111 According to previous reports,112 applying pressure on a liquid-exfoliation system can enhance the dynamics of molecule (i.e., SC CO2) intercalation into the interlayers of bulk crystals, thus effectively raising the exfoliation efficiency.113
This is an exfoliation technique combining SC CO2 with ultrasound to further enhance the efficiency of molecule (i.e., the combination of CO2 and cavitation) intercalation and exfoliation of bulk crystals. The strong intercalation force is generated from the high-pressure acoustic cavitation in a SC CO2/solution system. Concurrently, the fantastic penetration ability of SC CO2 enhances its intercalation into the interspacing of graphite. Consequently, the exfoliation efficiency of graphite is obviously increased.

Fig. 1a shows the procedure of exfoliating graphite into 2D graphene nanosheets. Due to the low density, SC CO2 fills in the upper space of the system, while the aqueous solution and graphite particles distribute in the lower space due to their high density. The solution is composed of deionized water and ethanol in a 1:1 volume ratio (Fig. 1a(i)).114 Then, the aqueous solution starts to emulsify with the SC CO2 medium via ultrasound treatment because of the cavitation effect (Fig. 1a(ii)).114 With increasing the ultrasonication time, large emulsion droplets change into small droplets and form a uniform emulsion environment. So, graphite is surrounded by SC CO2 and small emulsion droplets (Fig. 1a(iii)).114 Finally, the SC CO2 molecules penetrate into the inter-layers of bulk graphite and break the van der Waals force between adjacent layers of graphite with the help of cavitation attack (Fig. 1a(iv)).114 Then an atomically thin graphene suspension is obtained. After centrifugation and filtration, single-layer or few-layer graphene nanosheets are successfully crafted.114Fig. 1b and c indicate that the best exfoliation conditions are a pressure of 16 MPa and an ultrasonic power of 2 kW.114 Through this exfoliation technique, graphene,114 BN,115 MoS2,115 and WS2 (ref. 115) nanosheets have been successfully crafted.

2.2.1.2. Reverse-micelle-induced exfoliation. 
In order to explain the possible mechanism of reverse-micelle-induced exfoliation, it is proposed that a surfactant and graphite can be considered as a complete unit due to their intense hydrophobic interaction.116 Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) is a surfactant, consisting of a hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain and a hydrophilic pyrrolidone group. When reaching the critical micelle concentration of PVP, PVP will aggregate and form micelles in H2O at a pressure of 8 MPa in the lower aqueous-rich layer or become reverse micelles in the upper layer of SC CO2 at a pressure of 16 MPa.114 Hence, the pressure in the system is the key to obtaining reverse micelles.

Fig. 2 demonstrates the whole process of reverse-micelle-induced exfoliation.117 As shown in Fig. 2a(i), the hydrophilic groups of PVP point to the aqueous solution, while hydrophobic tails connect with graphite.117 At the same time, CO2 molecules dissolve in water at low pressure. When reaching the super critical pressure of SC CO2, SC CO2 penetrates into the adjacent layers of graphite thus weakening the van der Waals force between them (Fig. 2a(ii)).117 With increasing the amount of CO2 injection, PVP tends to form reverse micelles in the SC CO2 phase (Fig. 2a(iii)).117,118 Under the concurrent force from SC CO2 penetration and micelle reversal, the curly single-layer graphene is separated from graphite (Fig. 2a(iv)).117 After releasing the pressure of the system, the curly graphene attached by PVP becomes flat (Fig. 2a(v)).117Fig. 2b presents the difference between pristine graphite and as-exfoliated graphene.117 Graphite exhibits a sharp intense diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.52° (d-spacing = 0.34 nm), which is in accordance with the (002) plane of the graphite structure (Fig. 2b).117 By contrast, there is no change in the peak position of graphene, indicating that the original structure is retained (Fig. 2b).117 The SAED pattern in Fig. 2c depicts a representative diffraction pattern of graphene.117 In Fig. 2d, the diffraction intensity from the (010) plane is much stronger than that from the (110) plane, which testifies the existence of the graphene monolayer.117 A large amount of graphene flakes are observed in the low-resolution TEM (Fig. 2e), whose lateral dimensions are in the range of 0.2–1 μm.117 Some stacked nanosheets in Fig. 2e are marked by red arrows.117

2.2.1.3. Pickering emulsion-induced exfoliation. 
Emulsions can be stabilized by small- and macro-molecular emulsifiers. The stabilizers of Pickering emulsion are solid particles, which accumulate at the interface between two immiscible liquids (e.g., oil and water phases) and prevent droplets from coalescing.119 Herein, MoS2–water Pickering emulsion is obtained via SC CO2 treatment.120 The possible mechanism of exfoliation is shown in Fig. 3a.120 At first, bulk MoS2 is dispersed in ethanol (Fig. 3a(i)).120 After reaching the conditions of SC CO2 (i.e., 40 °C and at least 7.38 MPa),121 the bulk MoS2 crystals float at the interface between water and SC CO2–ethanol due to the intense hydrophobic property. Under high speed stirring, MoS2–water Pickering emulsion is created (Fig. 3a(ii)).120 Because of the shear force induced by high-speed stirring between the CO2–ethanol phase and MoS2–water phase, bulk MoS2 is delaminated layer by layer (Fig. 3a(iii) and 3a(iv)).120,122 As shown in Fig. 3b, the thickness of the as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets is around 1.1–1.6 nm, approximately equal to the theoretical thickness (i.e., 0.9–1.2 nm) of single-layer MoS2.120,123 The corresponding lateral dimensions of MoS2 are characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. 3c.120

Through this exfoliation technique, 2D MoO3 nanosheets are also successfully crafted.124


2.2.2. Ostwald ripening exfoliation. 
Generally speaking, a two-phase mixture (i.e., a matrix containing a dispersed second phase) is formed during any first-order phase transformation process.125 However, this mixture is not in thermodynamic equilibrium at the beginning due to the large specific surface area of the second phase. In order to decrease the total energy of the two-phase mixture, the size of the second phase tends to increase and the total interfacial area between the second phase and matrix is prone to decrease.125 This process is named Ostwald ripening.125

Fig. 4a shows the exfoliation process of NiFe LDHs via Ostwald ripening exfoliation.47 As shown in the magnified views of Fig. 4a, each bulk Ni(OH)2 nanoplate is made up of a number of tightly piled ultrathin layers.47 Driven by the spontaneous thermodynamic transformation process of Ostwald ripening, the small nanoparticles dissolve and precipitate into big ones via the ordinary hydrothermal treatment (Fig. 4a).47 After the in situ exfoliation for 2–7 hours, the original layered bulk Ni(OH)2 is gradually delaminated into ultrathin nanosheets with decreasing thickness and increasing lateral sizes (Fig. 4b–d).47 Through this exfoliation technique, 2D BiOCl nanosheets are also successfully obtained.126

2.2.3. Liquid nitrogen-assisted method. 
This method aims to utilize liquid nitrogen treatment to weaken the van der Waals interaction between adjacent layers of layered bulk materials and introduce cracks in each layer.51,127 After that, it is easy to exfoliate bulk crystals into 2D nano-materials in a polar solvent within a short time with the assistance of microwaves or ultrasound.51,128
The schematic illustration of the g-C3N4 exfoliation process is displayed in Fig. 5a. The g-C3N4 bulk material is immersed in liquid nitrogen (Fig. 5a).51 Due to the introduction of microwaves, the polar solvent molecules intercalate into the interlayers of bulk materials, vibrating for over two billion times per second. Subsequently, this vibration energy is quickly transferred to the bulk crystals, weakening the van der Waals interaction between adjacent layers and causing the exfoliation of g-C3N4 (Fig. 5a).51 XRD results indicate that the intensity of (100) and (002) peaks of 2D g-C3N4 is obviously weaker than that of the bulk counterpart, illustrating successful preparation of atomically thin g-C3N4 (Fig. 5b).51 This approach is also suitable for the preparation of other 2D materials such as MoS2, WS2, h-BN, TiS2, NbS2, Bi2Se3, MoTe2, Sb2Te3, graphene, and BP.51,128,129

Another representative study reports an opposite process to yield h-BN nanosheets.129 At first, the temperature of the system is increased to 800 °C.129 The interspacing and volume of layered h-BN expand during raising the temperature, so the van der Waals force between adjacent layers is weakened.129 Then the system is rapidly cooled down by using liquid nitrogen,129 bringing about the curling of bulk h-BN materials. The dramatic volume expansion of bulk is observed when liquid nitrogen changes to the gas phase.129 Therefore, 2D h-BN materials are crafted during this process (Fig. 5c).129 Few-layer h-BN nanosheets are successfully obtained after exfoliating 10 times (denoted as BNNS-10, Fig. 5d).129


2.2.4. Pure water exfoliation technique. 
Although some materials cannot be exfoliated in cold water, they can be directly exfoliated in hot water.130 High temperature facilitates water molecules to penetrate into interlayers and break the van der Waals force between adjacent layers.130
This is a standard two-step exfoliation procedure for preparing 2D MoSe2 flakes via sonication-centrifugation treatment in hot water (50 °C, Fig. 6a).130 MoSe2 is exfoliated into 2D nanosheets via ultrasonic wave treatment, and then the 2D nanosheets are separated from water by centrifugation (Fig. 6a).130 The TEM image and corresponding SAED pattern (inset) of obtained MoSe2 are presented in Fig. 6b, illustrating the successful exfoliation of the isolated MoSe2 layer.130Fig. 6c shows the Raman spectra of the ultrathin MoSe2 layers and bulk counterparts, which display characteristic peaks ascribed to the A1g (238 cm−1) and E12g (284 cm−1) patterns.130,131 The strong A1g pattern, coming from the vibration out of plane, affirms the existence of high quality atomically thin MoSe2 nanoflakes.130,132 The XRD patterns illustrate the high quality of 2D MoSe2 nanosheets (Fig. 6d).130

A series of reports have demonstrated successful formation of as-exfoliated 2D nanosheets via the pure water exfoliation technique, including WS2,52 MoS2,133,134 MoSe2,133 V2O5·0.55H2O,135 and h-BN.52,133–135

2.3. Bio-assisted exfoliation routes
Bio-assisted exfoliation methods refer to utilization of animal protein, plant extracts, and microorganisms to yield 2D materials. Three exfoliation techniques (i.e., animal protein-assisted exfoliation, bacterial etching exfoliation, and plant-extract-assisted exfoliation) are discussed here.

2.3.1. Animal protein-assisted exfoliation. 
As the functional groups of bovine serum albumin (BSA) molecules are tethered on the surface of bulk materials, BSA facilitates the exfoliation of bulk materials.136 As shown in Fig. 7a, the binding energies between layered MoS2 materials and benzene groups of BSA are the highest.136 When layered bulk MoS2 crystals are added to BSA solution, benzene groups of BSA molecules tightly combine with the surface of MoS2 crystals due to the intense hydrophobic interaction (Fig. 7b).136 Meanwhile, polar groups of BSA are exposed to water (Fig. 7b).136 When sonication is applied to BSA solution, the surfaces of MoS2 bound with BSA gradually slide, followed by freshly exposed MoS2 surfaces immediately adsorbing BSA. Eventually, ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets are obtained.136

Reproduced with permission.137 Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society. 
This route is also applicable to exfoliating non-layered 2D materials. Non-layered bulk WO3 is delaminated into 2D nanosheets with the assistance of BSA.26 Due to the intense electrostatic interaction between BSA and –NH3+ groups on the negatively charged surface of WO3, WO3 nanosheets are crafted via the same preparation process as that for previous MoS2 nanosheets.26,136
Another animal protein wool keratin (WK) is also utilized as an exfoliating agent, as the sulfur-containing groups of WK bind with the edge of MoS2.137 The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image demonstrates a interspacing of 0.27 nm, which is assigned to the (100) plane of MoS2 (Fig. 7c).137 The inset of Fig. 7c displays the hexagonally symmetric structure of MoS2.137 As shown in Fig. 7d, the A1g/E12g peaks for WK–MoS2 nanosheets and bulk crystals are located at 385.8/383 cm−1 and 407.6/408.5 cm−1, respectively.137 The peak site difference between A1g and E12g is 21.6 cm−1 for the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets, indicating that the exfoliated MoS2 is bilayer-thick.137


2.3.2. Bacterial etching exfoliation. 
Bioengineering is an emerging research topic in materials science and chemistry owing to its advantages (such as industrial availability, environmentally friendly, and low cost).53 According to previous reports on bacterial decomposition of polymers, Sun et al. deduced that both the C–N bond and weak van der Waals interaction between adjacent layers of bulk g-C3N4 can be broken by bacterial etching.53,99 The bacterial etching exfoliation process of g-C3N4 is shown in Fig. 8a.53 By secreting biological enzymes and biological acids that can etch bulk g-C3N4, Escherichia coli bacteria successfully delaminate bulk g-C3N4 into nanosheets (Fig. 8a).53 Moreover, the 2D planar morphology and thickness of exfoliated g-C3N4 are characterized by AFM, as depicted in Fig. 8b.53 The average thickness of the exfoliated g-C3N4 flakes is 15.4 nm (Fig. 8c).53

2.3.3. Plant-extract-assisted exfoliation. 
The mechanism of plant-extract-assisted exfoliation is the same as the animal protein-assisted exfoliation. Curcumin containing a variety of functional groups (for example, hydroxyl groups, β-diketone groups, etc.) has been proved to be a stabilizing agent.138,139 Specifically, as π–π coupling and hydrophobic interaction between curcumin and graphene reduce the interface energy, the adsorbed curcumin molecules restrain the recombination of the exfoliated graphene flakes. When exfoliation is carried out in the curcumin solution, newly obtained exfoliated graphene sheets are instantaneously covered with curcumin molecules to realize the stabilization of graphene.139 As shown in Fig. 9a, the process of graphene exfoliation comprises three steps.139 In the first step, curcumin is dissolved in ethanol under ultrasonic treatment.139 In the second step, graphite powder is added to the curcumin solution and ultrasound is applied to graphite.139 Graphite bulks are disassembled into graphene nanosheets because curcumin stabilizes graphene dispersion through chemical group interaction.139 In the last step, excess residual curcumin is removed by vacuum filtration.139 The as-prepared graphene sheets possess large lateral dimensions (Fig. 9b) and a thickness of 0.63 nm (Fig. 9c).139 It is proved that most of the as-exfoliated graphene sheets are bilayer nanosheets.139

Besides curcumin, Opuntia ficus-indica and β-cyclodextrin are used as exfoliating agents to exfoliate graphite into ultrathin graphene and TMDs (i.e., MoS2 and ReS2) into 2D nanosheets, respectively.29,140

2.4. Other routes
There are four other exfoliation methods that cannot be categorized into the previous two categories because of different mechanisms. Specifically, photochemical-assisted exfoliation, amphiphile-assisted exfoliation, gel-blowing exfoliation, and liquid metal-assisted exfoliation are summarized.

2.4.1. Photochemical-assisted exfoliation. 
Light promoted chemical reactions have been increasingly applied in chemical synthesis.24,141,142 As shown in Fig. 10a, many metal thiolates possess layered structures, allowing them to serve as precursors of 2D non-layered metal sulfides.24,143–145 When metal thiolate precursors are exposed to light, the temperature of the whole system slightly increases and the structure of precursors tends to gradually disperse into thinner lamellas (Fig. 10a).24 Finally, these lamellas of precursors are exfoliated into 2D metal sulfide nanosheets.24 As shown in Fig. 10b, at the beginning of the photochemical reaction process, parts of Pb–S and C–S bonds that belong to Pb dodecane thiolate (Pb–DDT) are broken, leading to the decomposition of Pb–DDT sheets into nanoparticles and fragments with crystalline edges made up of the Pb–S complex.24 With increasing the light irradiation time, nanoparticles recombine with the edges of the fragments, producing non-layered 2D PbS flakes. The transformation process of PbS nanosheets indicates an oriented attachment of PbS nanoparticles along particular crystalline directions.24,146 The intrinsic layered structure of Pb–DDT and chlorine in cosolvent are critical factors for the formation of PbS nanosheets, which retain the 2D architecture of lead thiolate.24Fig. 10c shows the grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) intensity along the qy axis, exhibiting scattering at two lengths.24 The peaks at around 2° and 6° refer to the total thickness (i.e., 4.4 nm) of the PbS monolayer and two ligand layers, and the thickness (i.e., 1.4 nm) of the PbS monolayer, respectively (Fig. 10c).24 The blue inset of Fig. 10c shows the 2D scattering mode, revealing that the obtained nanosheets are parallel to the surface of the substrate. According to the GISAXS data, a model is built which contains PbS nanosheets of 1.4 nm thickness separated by a penetrated bilayer ligand whose thickness is 3 nm (depicted in the center of Fig. 10c).24

This photochemical method with mild reaction conditions (i.e., temperature around 75 °C to 105 °C) has been applied to obtain non-layered 2D metal sulfide nanosheets (e.g., Cu9S5, CdS, PbS, Cu9S5, CuInS2, etc.).24


2.4.2. Amphiphile-assisted exfoliation. 
Conventionally chemical exfoliation of bulks, such as clay, graphite, and metal oxides/chalcogenides, has been thought as a practical way to prepare 2D nanosheets.147 However, these methods usually yield nanosheets of non-uniform lateral sizes, low crystallinity, and irregularly faceted edges.147,148 Compared with traditional chemical exfoliation methods, the amphiphile-assisted exfoliation technique could delaminate a 3D layered superstructure into 2D nanoplatelets of much higher quality.147,149–151
As shown in Fig. 11a and c, the 3D polydimethoxy aniline (PDMA)-covered Co(OH)2 superstructure (i.e., a peony flower-like structure) is composed of hierarchical 2D nanoplatelets with a thickness of a few nanometers and a width of several micrometers. This 3D structure is usually formed through nanoparticle-regulated crystallization involving a mesoscale changing process in the polymer matrix (i.e., PDMA).147,152 The crystallization of the inorganic phase is combined with organic mesophase transitions, producing nanosheets of high crystallinity (Fig. 11a).147 Compared with layered materials whose interaction force between interlayers is the van der Waals force, the nanosheet building blocks in the peony flower-like structure are separated by organic additives and are gathered together via complex interlayer interactions.147,153,154 Thus, GO is added as an effective exfoliant to craft ultrathin β-cobalt hydroxide–reduced graphene oxide (β-Co(OH)2–rGO) hybrid nanosheets. PDMA-covered Co(OH)2 mesocrystals are dispersed in GO solution (Fig. 11b(i)).147 Then GO sheets are adsorbed on the surface of Co(OH)2 flower-like nanomaterials and weaken the interlayer interactions (Fig. 11b(ii)).147 After this, lamellas are gradually peeled off (Fig. 11b(iii)).147 Finally, 2D hybrid Co(OH)2–rGO nanosheets are successfully crafted (Fig. 11b(iv)).147 The SEM image in Fig. 11d shows hexagonal hybrid Co(OH)2–rGO nanosheets with the lateral size ranging from 5–7 μm.147 According to Fig. 11e,147 almost all peaks of both mesocrystals and nanosheets are referred to the hexagonal brucite-like structured β-Co(OH)2 phase, suggesting that there is no change in the crystal structure after the exfoliation process. Through this technique, 2D graphene nanosheets are exfoliated.54

2.4.3. Gel-blowing exfoliation. 
Generally speaking, current routes for the preparation of 2D materials can be sorted into gas-phase and liquid-phase synthesis.25 One of the most popular gas-phase syntheses is chemical vapor deposition (CVD).25 CVD usually produces 2D nanosheets with large lateral size and high quality, but its shortcomings of low productivity, high cost and low output restrict its large-scale application.25,155–157 Liquid-phase methods, such as chemical synthesis158–160 and liquid exfoliation,122,161,162 are facile, uncomplicated, and able to obtain a large number of samples.25 However, there are two disadvantages of these liquid-phase techniques. To be specific, small 2D nanosheets are easily contaminated during the synthesis process. Moreover, liquid-phase methods are only available for layered compounds.25,122,163,164 Thus, it is highly desirable to develop a strategy that can combine the advantages of both gas-phase and liquid-phase approaches to yield large-size homogeneous 2D nanosheets, especially nonlayered materials.25 Inspired by the Chinese sugar figure blowing art, gel-blowing has been developed. This technique employs rapid annealing to blow a sticky gel precursor and obtain a bubble which is made up of atomically thin nanosheets (Fig. 12a).25 The gel precursor is crafted via the esterification reaction between citric acid (CA) and ethylene glycol (EG).25 The volume of the gel precursor expands to form a bubble, followed by collapse of the bubble during the gas release to form 2D thin films.25 The advantage of this strategy is the facile control of reactants and temperature.25

This gel blowing technique suits mass production of more than ten kinds of non-layered 2D nanosheet materials, including pure N-doped carbon (NC), metal oxides (i.e., Fe2O3, Mn3O4, ZnMn2O4, ZnO–ZnxFe3−xO4, and CoxMn1−xFe2O4), metal oxide/NC mixtures (i.e., MnO/NC, Fe3O4/NC, ZnO–MnO/NC, and ZnO–ZnxFe3−xO4/NC) and metal/NC mixtures (Ni/NC, NiCo/NC and Ni/NC).25Fig. 12b illustrates the successful preparation of 2D non-layered Fe2O3 nanosheets.25 The lattice fringe of 0.25 nm corresponds to the (10) plane of exfoliated Fe2O3 nanosheets (Fig. 12c).25


2.4.4. Liquid metal-assisted exfoliation. 
This is a novel exfoliation technique to delaminate ultrathin 2D metal oxide nanosheets (e.g., HfO2, Al2O3, and Gd2O3) by using liquid gallium-based alloys as the reaction solvent. Gallium-based alloys tend to form a self-limiting thin oxide layer at the interface between alloys and air under ambient conditions.165 According to the principles of thermodynamics, the formed thin film of metal oxides outside gallium-based alloys can significantly decrease Gibbs free energy, leading to a more stable state of gallium-based alloys.165 The composition of this metal oxide thin film is decided by the constituents of alloyed metals (Fig. 13a).165 There are two specific exfoliation strategies used in the study.165Fig. 13b shows that the thickness of the HfO2 nanosheets exfoliated through this method is 0.46 nm.165 The first method is to transfer the metal oxide film from the surface of the liquid metal droplet to a solid substrate thus obtaining ultrathin 2D metal oxide nanosheets (Fig. 13c).165 Because of the nature of the liquid metal, there exist macroscopic forces (i.e., van der Waals force) between the liquid metal and its oxide skin.165 Breaking the van der Waals force with a solid substrate allows the delamination of 2D metal oxide films.165,166 This exfoliation strategy is suitable for preparing metal oxide films of high quality on the substrate.165 The other strategy is injecting pressurized air into the liquid metal Ga at room temperature to craft 2D metal oxide nanosheets (Fig. 13d).165 As the air bubbles ascend through the high-density liquid metal, the ultrathin metal oxides formed inside them (Fig. 13d).165 Then, the released air bubbles pass through the low-density layer of deionized water to form a suspension of 2D metal oxide nanosheets (Fig. 13d) (Table 2).165

3. Applications of 2D materials
Based on the various aforementioned exfoliation techniques (i.e., well-established exfoliation methods, green chemistry exfoliation techniques, bio-assisted exfoliation techniques, and other exfoliation techniques), suitable 2D materials can be obtained for different applications (i.e., batteries, supercapacitors, electronic devices, and catalysis).
3.1. Electronic devices
Graphene nanosheets have been widely utilized in electronic devices. The micromechanical cleavage exfoliation technique has been applied to obtain 2D materials for electrochemical energy storage devices,167,168 photodetectors,169 FETs,170 and gas sensors due to the large lateral size and high crystallinity of the as-prepared 2D materials.167–170 However, its poor production yield restricts the applications.46 Conventional mechanical liquid exfoliation routes can increase the yield of graphene nanosheets.46 Compared with traditional mechanical liquid exfoliation approaches applied to graphene nanosheets, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation techniques could further enhance the productivity and size of the as-prepared 2D graphene nanosheets.114 It is noted that liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation, pure water exfoliation, plant extract-assisted exfoliation, and amphiphile-assisted exfoliation are also available for producing 2D graphene nanosheets. Liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation and pure water exfoliation techniques are limited by the small lateral size (less than 0.5 μm) of exfoliated nanosheets, which are not suitable for graphene-based electronic devices. The plant extract-assisted exfoliation technique is not fit for electronic devices due to the defects at the edge of exfoliated graphene nanosheets. By contrast, amphiphile-assisted exfoliation is another method for fabricating graphene-based electronic devices due to its advantages of high yield and large lateral size (around 5–10 μm) of the obtained graphene nanosheets. Therefore, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation and amphiphile-assisted exfoliation are the most suitable techniques to prepare graphene of large lateral size (0.5–2 μm) and high crystallinity for electronic devices.
2D TMD (i.e., MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2 and WSe2) nanosheets are promising candidates for electronic/optoelectronic devices due to their relatively high charge carrier mobility and adjustable energy band structure.46,167 To assemble 2D TMD-based electronic devices such as transistors and photodetectors, high crystal quality of 2D TMDs is a prerequisite.46 In comparison with well-established exfoliation methods, the pure water exfoliation technique has the advantages of high-quality and high yield of 2D TMDs.52,130,133 In addition, 2D TMDs (especially MoS2) have been widely applied in the wearable and implantable flexible bioelectronics field.171 In order to craft MoS2-based wearable and implantable flexible bioelectronic devices, large specific surface area, ultrathin thickness, and intrinsic defects serving as active sites are three essential prerequisites.171 The Pickering emulsion-induced exfoliation and animal protein-assisted exfoliation meet these conditions, exhibiting high biocompatibility.
In recent years, non-layered 2D PbS nanosheets have received wide attention due to their superlative performance in field-effect transistors and photodetectors.172,173 The photochemical-assisted exfoliation technique is a potential strategy to craft 2D PbS nanosheets.24 The responsivity and specific detectivity of the as-prepared Cu-decorated PbS nanosheets for a wavelength of 808 nm reach 1739 A W−1 and about 2.55 × 1011 Jones, respectively.173

Many non-layered 2D materials, such as CdS, WO3 and Fe2O3, are ideal candidates for photocatalysis, as they possess dangling bonds, which act as active sites to promote catalytic activity.25,174,175 Well-established exfoliation methods are limited to layered materials.26,29,46,176 Up to now, only two techniques (i.e., animal protein-assisted exfoliation and gel-blowing exfoliation) have been reported to successfully exfoliate these non-layered metal oxide nanosheets.25,26
2D BiOCl nanoplates are crafted via an Ostwald ripening process (Fig. 14a).126 Then BiOCl nanoplates are changed into BiOCl/Bi2S3 heterostructures through a thermodynamic equilibrium exchange between BiOCl nanoplates and S2− anions (Fig. 14a).126,177 To estimate the effect of Na2S2O3·5H2O concentration on the formation of 2D BiOCl/Bi2S3 heterostructures, different concentrations are investigated during the anion exchange process. The samples of different concentrations (0.025, 2, 4 and 6 mmol Na2S2O3·5H2O) are denoted as H-1, H-2, H-3 and H-4, respectively. H-3 exhibits a higher photocatalytic reduction rate than other samples (Fig. 14b).126 As shown in Fig. 14c, the obvious reaction rate constant of sample H-3 is 0.01078 min−1, which is 100.0 and 6.0 times larger than that of pristine BiOCl (i.e., 1.00681 × 10−4 min−1) and a physical mixture of pristine Bi2S3 and pure BiOCl (i.e., 0.00179 min−1), respectively.126 The as-prepared pure BiOCl nanoplates and 2D network BiOCl/Bi2S3 heterostructures are shown in Fig. 14d and e, respectively.126

2D layered materials like TMDs (e.g., MoS2 and SnS2) and g-C3N4 also display superlative photocatalytic performance. Mechanical liquid exfoliation,33 ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation,34 SC CO2-assisted exfoliation,120 liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation,51 pure water exfoliation,133 animal protein-assisted exfoliation,136 bacterial etching exfoliation,53 plant extract-assisted exfoliation,139 and liquid metal-assisted exfoliation165 techniques are applicable for mass production of these layered 2D materials. Only two techniques (i.e., bacterial etching exfoliation and liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation) are applicable to the delamination of g-C3N4. g-C3N4 nanosheets obtained via liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation have higher specific surface area (average lateral size of 200 nm and thickness less than 5 nm) than those (average thickness of 15.4 nm and lateral size of around 100–200 nm) prepared via bacterial etching exfoliation. Thus, liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation is the most appropriate route for exfoliating g-C3N4.


3.2.2. Electrocatalysis. 
2D NiFe LDHs are some of the best candidates for electrocatalytic water oxidation.178 It is critical to tune the thickness of 2D NiFe LDHs for better electrocatalytic water oxidation performance.178 The thin thickness of 2D nanosheets ensures the short transfer distance of charge carriers. Compared with the well-established preparation (i.e., ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation), Ostwald ripening can in situ yield 2D NiFe LDHs through the hydrothermal process, through which the morphology of 2D NiFe LDHs is regulated.47 Due to their highly active chalcogenide atoms at the edge of the 2D architecture, the adjustable bandgap and a suitable band structure for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reaction, TMDs have received much attention as electrocatalysts for the HER.179,180 Pure water exfoliation is a good technique to obtain high yields of 2D TMDs (i.e., MoS2,133 WS2,52,133 and MoSe2 (ref. 130)). By contrast, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation with ultrasound produces 2D MoS2 nanosheets with a thinner thickness of around 0.75–0.8 nm than that obtained with pure water exfoliation (average 4.56 nm). Therefore, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation with ultrasound is the most suitable technique for preparing 2D MoS2 nanosheet catalysts. Owing to the catalytic active sites (i.e., N-species) in the carbon framework, 2D N-doped graphene and g-C3N4 emerge as metal-free electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Gel-blowing exfoliation and liquid nitrogen-assisted routes are ideal solutions to craft these two 2D metal-free electrocatalysts.25,51

3.3. Batteries

3.3.1. Lithium-ion batteries. 
2D materials, such as graphene, MoS2, MoSe2, MXenes and V2O5, are suitable candidates for anodes of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of their high theoretical capacity.181–184
Mechanical liquid exfoliation, ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation, animal protein-assisted exfoliation, plant extract-assisted exfoliation, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation, and pure water exfoliation have been utilized to craft graphene nanosheets.46,52,130,133 Mechanical liquid exfoliation with sonication and a freeze-drying treatment have been applied to prepare monolayered MoS2 nanosheets of high specific surface area, which promotes the ability of lithium ion storage.185 The results show that monolayered MoS2 nanosheets (lateral size of 30–50 nm, average thickness of around 0.6–0.7 nm) as anode materials of lithium-ion battery display a superlative lithium-storage capacity of ∼1400 mA h g−1 and recharge over 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 without attenuation.185 The other traditional exfoliation technique (i.e., ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation) yields 2D MoS2 nanosheets with a lateral size of around 100 nm and average thickness of about 1 nm.34 MoS2 nanosheets can also be delaminated by novel exfoliation techniques, including liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation, animal protein-assisted exfoliation, plant extract-assisted exfoliation, and SC CO2-assisted exfoliation. It is worth noting that MoS2 nanosheets obtained by SC CO2-assisted exfoliation with ultrasound show a large lateral size ranging from 0.5 to 2 μm, a thin average thickness of around 0.75–0.8 nm and high crystallinity.115 The pure water exfoliation technique produces exfoliated 2D MoS2 nanosheets possessing high crystallinity, with a thickness of 2–3 layers, and a lateral size of around 200–300 nm.133 By contrast, 2D MoS2 nanosheets crafted by animal protein-assisted exfoliation and plant extract-assisted exfoliation show a thicker thickness of 3–4 nm and 5–15 nm, respectively.29,137 In addition, animal protein-assisted and plant extract-assisted exfoliation methods result in MoS2 nanosheets with a lateral size of 100–300 nm and induce defects in MoS2 nanosheets during the delamination process.29,137 Thus, to satisfy the requirements for mass production of 2D MoS2 nanosheets of high quality for LIBs, pure water exfoliation and SC CO2-assisted exfoliation are the most appropriate techniques.
V2O5 is a suitable cathode material for LIBs on account of its low cost and high theoretical capacity (about 300 mA h g−1).183 It is noted that the capacity of V2O5·nH2O is over 550 mA h g−1, which might be a better choice for LIBs.135 But normal preparation approaches of 2D V2O5·nH2O nanosheets harm the environment due to the utilization of environmentally unfriendly chemicals. In order to address this problem, a novel and green pure water exfoliation technique has been developed to successfully obtain V2O5·0.55H2O nanosheets.135 As shown in Fig. 15a, the vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) precursor is refluxed at 60 °C for 3 days after sonication treatment in water.135 During the reflux process, water molecules insert into VO2(B) crystals and break the covalent bonds between the interlayers of VO2(B) (Fig. 15a).135 Thus, 2D V2O5·0.55H2O nanosheets are obtained (Fig. 15a).135 The as-exfoliated sample is proven by SEM in Fig. 15b.135 The electrodes coated with the thinnest (i.e., 4 μm) V2O5·0.55H2O nanosheets deliver the best gravimetric capacity of 480 mA h g−1 under a current density of 200 mA g−1 in the cycle test (Fig. 15c).135 To achieve large-scale application of V2O5 as lithium metal cathodes, pure water exfoliation is a suitable route due to its high yield and low cost.

3.3.2. Sodium-ion batteries. 
Sodium demonstrates similar chemical properties to lithium, which makes the previous knowledge of designing LIBs also available for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).186 Compared with LIBs, SIBs present a lower ion transport rate and lower electrochemical reaction kinetics during the charge/discharge procedure because of the larger radius of sodium.186,187 These drawbacks lead to limited rate capability and sodium storage reversibility of SIBs.186 Therefore, developing electrode materials of high capacity for SIBs is highly desirable.186
2D materials, TMDs (i.e., MoS2, SnS2, Sb2S3, WS2, and VS2),186 TMOs (i.e., V2O5, Co3O4, SnO2, NiO, MnO2, and α-Fe2O3),188 BP,189 graphene,190 and MXenes (i.e., Ti3C2Tx,191 Ti3C2,186 and Ti2AlC192) have been proved to be appropriate electrode materials for SIBs. For example, 2D WS2 nanosheets have been recognized as promising electrode materials for SIBs due to their large theoretical specific capacity (432 mA h g−1).193 More importantly, thin 2D nanosheets exhibit a large specific surface area, which benefits the ability of ion storage. Defects of 2D nanosheets can serve as active sites which contribute to the higher capacity of sodium ions.186 2D WS2 nanosheets can be crafted by SC CO2-assisted exfoliation and pure water exfoliation techniques.52,115 The pure water exfoliation method endows exfoliated 2D WS2 nanosheets with high crystallinity, an average thickness of 4.56 nm and an average lateral size of 769 nm.52 SC CO2-assisted exfoliation with ultrasound is a technique to craft 2D WS2 nanosheets with high crystallinity, a thickness of 0.75–0.8 nm and a lateral size of 0.5–2 μm.115 Therefore, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation with ultrasound is an appropriate exfoliation technique of 2D WS2 nanosheets for SIBs.
Well-established liquid exfoliation methods, including mechanical liquid exfoliation,33,69–72 ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation34,35,88 and selective erosion-assisted liquid exfoliation,46 are able to craft 2D TMDs (i.e., MoS2, SnS2, Sb2S3 and VS2), graphene, BP, layered TMOs and MXenes. Mechanical liquid exfoliation with sonication has been used to prepare 2D MoS2 nanosheets (thickness of about 10 nm, lateral size of around 100–400 nm), which work as the anode of SIBs and display a high discharge capacity of 386 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.102 2D MoS2 nanosheets (thickness ranging from 1 to 9 nm, lateral size ranging from 50 nm to 1 μm) are prepared by ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation. The electrode composed of these MoS2 nanosheets and graphene shows a discharge capacity of 376 mA h g−1. As a novel exfoliation technique, the SC CO2-assisted exfoliation technique is able to craft 2D graphene and MoS2 nanosheets of high productivity.114,120 Gel-blowing exfoliation has been utilized to craft 2D Fe2O3 nanosheets. SC CO2-assisted exfoliation and gel-blowing exfoliation techniques have potential for application in the synthesis of other layered and non-layered 2D nanosheets for SIBs.25


3.3.3. Lithium/sodium metal batteries. 
Because of the high theoretical capacity (3860 mA h g−1) and ultralow standard negative electrochemical potential (−3.040 V), lithium metal batteries are regarded as some of the most promising energy storage devices.194 However, the dendrite growth of Li limits their applications.195,196 To address the problem of dendrite growth, 2D layered materials (such as graphene, rGO, and h-BN nanosheets) have been employed as shield films to protect lithium metal anodes.195,196 In Li–O2 batteries, oxygen reacts with lithium to form the solid-state discharge oxide (i.e., Li2O2), resulting in decreased reaction kinetics. Graphene, B-doped graphene, and N-doped graphene are ideal 2D materials to tackle this issue by improving the charge transfer from Li2O2 to the cathode.195 In the cathode of Li–S batteries, sulfur is reduced to form Li2S where the energy is stored. Despite the solid state of both sulfur and Li2S, soluble intermediate lithium polysulfides are formed during the reactions. The dissolution of these polysulfides into the electrolyte causes the attenuation of capacity. To tackle this problem, 2D materials, such as V2O5 and MoS2, are used to restrict these lithium polysulfides in the cathode of Li–S batteries.197 SC CO2-assisted exfoliation is a better technique to craft graphene due to its high yield when compared with mechanical liquid exfoliation.114 Oxidation-assisted liquid exfoliation is a good choice to craft 2D GO, which is the source to yield 2D rGO nanosheets.
Similar to lithium metal batteries, sodium metal anodes also suffer from the limitations of dendrite growth.195,196 According to previous studies, graphene, h-BN, silicene and rGO 2D nanosheets act as a protective layer for sodium metal anodes.194–196 Electrochemical lithiation and delithiation exfoliation has been applied to prepare 2D silicene nanosheets.59 Mechanical liquid exfoliation, ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation and pure water exfoliation techniques are all available for preparing 2D h-BN nanosheets. However, ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation is time consuming. Mechanical liquid exfoliation requires a suitable solvent. The pure water exfoliation technique is the best choice to produce 2D h-BN with high yield, as it is environmentally friendly and low cost.

3.4. Supercapacitors
Since the dangling bonds on the surface provide abundant surface-active sites and enhance the ability of capacitive charge storage, non-layered 2D materials are promising electrode materials of supercapacitors.23 One of the typical non-layered 2D materials applied in supercapacitors is β-Co(OH)2, whose monolayer nanosheets possess high specific capacity (2028 F g−1).159 β-Co(OH)2–rGO nanosheets have been crafted via the amphiphile-assisted exfoliation technique, demonstrating a reversible capacity of over 850 mA h g−1 for more than 30 cycles.147 Another ideal material is ultrathin NiO nanosheets which exhibit high specific capacity (i.e., 2236 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and low capacity attenuation (0.9%) for more than 2000 cycles.198 2D TMDs (i.e., MoS2,199 WS2,200 and MoTe2 (ref. 200)), BP201 and graphene nanosheets are materials of high conductivity while 2D LDHs200 and MXenes202 possess high electrochemical activity, and are suitable for electrode materials. 2D ZnCo LDHs show the maximum theoretical capacitance (i.e., 3946.5 F g−1 at 3 A g−1).200 Ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation is a well-known method to yield LDHs, which is, however, time consuming. The Ostwald ripening exfoliation technique, a time-saving method, has been applied to craft 2D NiFe LDHs of high quality.47 It is expected to yield 2D ZnCo LDH nanosheets through this method with higher efficiency. SC CO2-assisted exfoliation is an ideal route for crafting 2D TMDs (i.e., WS2 (ref. 115) and MoS2 (ref. 115 and 120)) due to its advantages of high yield and relatively low cost.115,120 In order to realize industrial-scale production of 2D MoS2 nanosheets, pure water delamination is an ideal route because of its facile strategy, low cost and high yield.
One-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on two-dimensional (2D) N-doped carbon nanosheets (NCNS) are successfully crafted through the gel-blowing approach.203 Different from the previous report,25 this work designs a 3D structure material, showing a specific capacity of 124 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.203 The gel-blowing synthesis procedure of the NCNS@CNT hybrid is shown in Fig. 16a.203 After the gel-blowing treatment, 3D NCNS@CNTs are successfully obtained, as depicted in Fig. 16b.203 The specific capacities are 580, 521, 458, 420, and 360 F g−1 for NCNS@NiO, and 660, 620, 576, 560, and 532 F g−1 for NCNS@CNTs@NiO at 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 16c).203 Furthermore, it is discovered that NCNS@CNTs@NiO exhibits a higher capacity than NCNS@NiO at all current densities (inset of Fig. 16c).203 Notably, the capacity disparity between NCNS@NiO and NCNS@CNTs@NiO becomes larger as the current density increases (Fig. 16c).203 The NCNS@CNTs@NiO retains 80.6% of the capacity when the current density rises from 1 to 20 A g−1, higher than that of NCNS@NiO (i.e., 62.1%).203 According to Fig. 16d, the Rct of NCNS@CNTs@NiO (i.e., 4.3 Ω) is evidently smaller than that of NCNS@NiO (i.e., 14 Ω), which may be due to the higher quality of NCNS@CNTs.203

4. Conclusion and outlook
Owing to their tailorable band structure and conductivity, layered 2D materials have been widely studied. Notably, inspired by layered 2D materials, non-layered 2D materials have subsequently emerged, possessing unique properties such as abundant surface-active sites and short ion-transfer routes.23,25 In order to access these layered and non-layered 2D materials, a series of exfoliation methods have been explored. This review summarizes several practical and facile exfoliation techniques (e.g., well-established exfoliation techniques, as well as other emerging strategies such as green chemical routes, bio-assisted methods, etc.) and their corresponding exfoliation mechanisms to yield 2D layered and non-layered materials. It is noteworthy that among the emerging techniques, liquid metal-assisted exfoliation, animal protein-assisted exfoliation,26 photochemical-assisted exfoliation,24 and gel-blowing exfoliation25 have been utilized to produce 2D non-layered materials, such as metal oxides and metal chalcogenides. The remaining emerging techniques yield 2D layered materials. All these routes overcome the disadvantages of well-established liquid exfoliation techniques to some extent. We further summarize the applications of layered and non-layered 2D materials achieved by these exfoliation techniques in electronic devices, catalysis, batteries and supercapacitors.
Different applications of 2D materials demonstrate various criteria to choose exfoliation strategies. Electronic devices require 2D materials of high crystal quality and large lateral size, so micromechanical cleavage exfoliation, amphiphile-assisted exfoliation, pure water exfoliation, Pickering emulsion-induced exfoliation, animal protein-assisted exfoliation and liquid metal-assisted exfoliation routes become appropriate choices. Photochemical-assisted exfoliation has the potential to yield 2D nonlayered PbS which is an ideal material in field-effect transistors and photodetectors. For catalysis, batteries and supercapacitors, high yield and low cost are key factors. Varying from electronic devices, defects of 2D nanosheets might play positive roles in catalysis, batteries and supercapacitors. In catalysis, defects might serve as active sites, while in batteries and supercapacitors, defects might enhance the ability of ion storage. Hence, mechanical liquid exfoliation, ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation, liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation, pure water exfoliation, animal protein-assisted exfoliation, bacterial etching exfoliation, and plant extract-assisted exfoliation are suitable methods to exfoliate 2D materials for catalysis, batteries and supercapacitors. Non-layered 2D materials (e.g., WO3 and Fe2O3) used in catalysis and supercapacitors can be delaminated by animal protein-assisted exfoliation and photochemical-assisted exfoliation. Selective erosion-assisted liquid exfoliation is an effective way to obtain many kinds of 2D MXenes for batteries.
As mentioned in the previous section, there are eleven exfoliation techniques (i.e., mechanical liquid exfoliation, ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation, ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation, liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation, pure water exfoliation, animal protein-assisted exfoliation, bacterial etching exfoliation, plant extract-assisted exfoliation, gel-blowing exfoliation, and liquid metal-assisted exfoliation) that could prepare 2D materials on the large scale. When it comes to industrial-scale production of 2D materials, low cost and high quality of materials are the most important points to consider. SC CO2-assisted exfoliation techniques are not suitable for industrial-scale production of 2D materials because of harsh exfoliation conditions (high pressure), which will tremendously increase the cost. Biological reagents (e.g., BSA and curcumin) used in animal protein-assisted exfoliation, plant extract-assisted exfoliation and bacterial etching exfoliation not only increase the cost, but also cause the adsorption of reagent residues on the surface of the obtained nanosheets, which has a negative influence on the quality of 2D nanosheets. Expensive liquid nitrogen and liquid metal (i.e., Ga) utilized in liquid nitrogen-assisted exfoliation and liquid metal-assisted exfoliation also raise the cost. Therefore, mechanical liquid exfoliation, ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation, ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation, pure water exfoliation and gel-blowing exfoliation techniques have the potential to realize industrial-scale production of 2D materials. However, ultrasound of high power used in mechanical liquid exfoliation, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation, ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation and ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation techniques might induce surface defects on the exfoliated nanosheets, leading to the decreased quality of 2D materials. In addition, the facile and adjustable exfoliation conditions of pure water exfoliation and gel-blowing exfoliation techniques make it possible to ensure high quality of 2D materials.
Future investigation into 2D materials may focus on the following directions. First, given the relatively short period of time in which this class of exciting yet diverse materials has been developed, some exfoliation mechanisms still remain unclear. Delamination procedures might induce defects and adsorption of chemicals in/on the 2D materials. Future research should be focused on how the exfoliation process affects the properties of the as-prepared 2D materials, which in turn facilitates the improvement of exfoliation techniques. Second, several techniques (i.e., SC CO2-assisted exfoliation, Ostwald ripening exfoliation, and gel-blowing technique) in this review are simply utilized to exfoliate certain 2D materials. These routes should be extended to exfoliate other intriguing 2D materials, such as 2D metals and 2D MOFs. Third, more techniques should be developed to delaminate 2D non-layered materials. It is hard to selectively etch non-layered metal oxides/sulfides/nitrides into 2D counterparts. But it is a clever thought to make the precursors of metal oxides/sulfides/nitrides disassemble into 2D structures, followed by the recombination of these 2D precursors into metal oxide/sulfide/nitride nanosheets. Fourth, the application of 2D materials might be restricted due to the lack of long-term physical and/or chemical stability. The low stability is mainly attributed to the irreversible aggregation of 2D materials, easy oxidation under ambient conditions, and collapse or decomposition during the chemical reactions. Therefore, it is important to increase the physical and/or chemical stability of 2D materials during the application. Fifth, the modification of 2D materials after exfoliation should be taken into consideration, which reduces the complexity and cost of fabrication. For example, 2D Co(OH)2–rGO nanosheets and WO3/MoS2 heterojunctions are crafted in one-step amphiphile-assisted exfoliation and animal protein-assisted exfoliation, respectively. The obtained materials can be applied in catalysis and energy storage. Finally, environmentally friendly and low-cost exfoliation approaches that enable mass production of 2D materials are extremely desirable, as they represent a key step toward practical application of 2D materials. This merits much attention and remains as an active area of exploration.

Micromechanical cleavage exfoliation	Applying mechanical force via Scotch tape to break the van der Waals force between the interlayers of bulk crystals	TMDs (e.g., MoxW1−xS2,61 TaS2,62 TaSe2,62 MoS2,31 WSe2,31 MoTe2,63 and ReS2 (ref. 64)), topological insulators (e.g., Bi2Te3,65 Bi2Se3,66 and Sb2Te3 (ref. 67)), and metal phosphorus trichalcogenides (e.g., MPS3: M = Fe, Mn, Ni, Cd, and Zn).68	Obtaining 2D materials of high crystal quality, clean surface, and large lateral size of ultrathin 2D nanosheets	Low yield
Mechanical liquid exfoliation	Exfoliating layered materials in liquid solution via appropriate mechanical force (i.e., sonication and shear-force) to break the van der Waals force between different layers of bulk crystals	Graphene,69 h-BN,70 TMDs (e.g., MoS2,33 MoSe2,33 MoTe2,71 WS2,33 NbSe2,33 TaS2,72 and VS2(ref. 73)), TMOs (e.g., MoO3,74 hydrated-WO3,75 MnO2,76etc.), BP,77 MOFs,78–83 and COFs.84–87	High yield and suitable for large-scale production	It is hard to choose a suitable solvent to match the surface energy of the layered bulk crystals
Ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation	Bringing small ions, such as Li+, Na+, and K+, into the interspacing of adjacent layers of bulk materials to expand the interspacing and weaken the van der Waals force between adjacent layers of 2D materials	Graphene,88 h-BN,35 TMDs (e.g., MoS2,34 MoS2xSe2(1−x),89 WS2,34 WSe2,35 TiS2,34 TaS2,34 ZrS2,34 NbSe2,35 and MoxW1−xS2 (ref. 89)), and metal chalcogenides (e.g., Sb2Se3,35 Bi2Te3,35 Ta2NiS5,90 and Ta2NiSe5 (ref. 90))	High yield, and as-obtained nanosheets are positively charged with a clean surface	Time consuming, relatively small lateral size of obtained nanosheets (less than 1 μm)
Ion displacement-assisted liquid exfoliation	Utilizing larger ions to replace small ions in pristine layered crystals. Thus, the interspacing of adjacent layers expands and the van der Waals force between them weakens. Then 2D flakes are obtained via sonication or mechanical shaking	Layered metal oxides (e.g., Cs0.7Ti1.825O4,91 K0.45MnO2,92 and KCa2Nb3O10 (ref. 93)), LDHs (typical formula is M1−xMx(OH)2Ax/n·yH2O, M = Zn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+; M = Fe3+, Co3+, Al3+; and A = CO32−, Cl−, NO3−, ClO4−),94,95 and metal phosphorus trichalcogenides (i.e., MnPS3,96 CdPS3,96 Mn0.8PS3,97 and Cd0.8PS3 (ref. 97))	High yield and suitable for large-scale production	Only applicable to certain kinds of layered materials
Electrochemical lithiation and delithiation exfoliation	It is proposed that in isopropyl alcohol, lithium is drawn slowly but completely from lithiated Si nanopowder. This slow process enables the newly formed surface to be functionalized, avoiding resembling of the as-exfoliated silicene nanosheets	Silicene59	Available for preparing 2D silicene nanosheets	Small lateral size (30–100 nm) of silicene, only applicable to silicene and an unclear exfoliation mechanism
Selective erosion-assisted liquid exfoliation	A strong etching agent (e.g., hydrofluoric acid, mixture of fluoride salts and HCl/H2SO4, etc.) is applied to selectively etch A layers without breaking the bonds in Mn+1Xn planes. After removing A layers, the remaining bulk materials are composed of loosely piled Mn+1Xn layers, which can be easily exfoliated into atomically thin 2D flakes via sonication treatment	MXenes (e.g., Ti3C2,41 Ti2C,100 Nb2C,101 Ti4N3,102 V2C,101 (Ti0.5, Nb0.5)2C,40 (V0.5, Cr0.5)3C2,40 Ta4C3,40 Mo2TiC2,103 Mo2Ti2C3,103 Mo2CTx,103 Cr2TiC2,104 and Al3C3 (ref. 104))	An effective way to craft many kinds of 2D MXenes	It is not safe for experimenters to conduct this process due to the utilization of strong corrosive agents
Oxidation-assisted liquid exfoliation	After being oxidized, each surface of layered graphite is decorated with abundant oxygen-containing groups, which can significantly expand the interspacing between different layers of graphite and thus obviously weaken the van der Waals force between adjacent layers. Then it is easy to obtain 2D GO nanosheets under sonication treatment	GO105,106	High yield	Utilization of strong oxidizing agents, making this technique not safe. Only applicable to certain kinds of materials

Gel-blowing exfoliation	The volume of the gel precursor expands to form a bubble under annealing treatment in air, followed by collapse of the bubble during the gas release to form 2D thin films	Layered materials: 2D carbon nanosheets and NC.25	Well adjustable exfoliation speed. Large lateral size (over 10 μm) and high production suitable for preparing nonlayered metal oxide nanosheets	It is hard to craft monolayer nanosheets
Nonlayered materials: Fe2O3, Mn3O4, ZnMn2O4, ZnO–ZnxFe3−xO4, CoxMn1−xFe2O4, MnO/NC, Fe3O4/NC, ZnO–MnO/NC, and ZnO–ZnxFe3−xO4/NC.25
Liquid metal-assisted exfoliation	Gallium-based alloys tend to form a self-limiting thin oxide layer under ambient conditions at the interface between the metal and air. Then using a solid substrate or by injecting air ultrathin metal oxide films are isolated from the interface	Non-layered materials: HfO2, Al2O3, and Gd2O3 (ref. 165)	High yield, high quality and facile to craft nonlayered metal oxide nanosheets	It is hard to extend to other materials
