    , Accepted 3rd August 2019First published on 5th August 2019AbstractThe Janus structures of transition metal dichalcogenides with intrinsic dipoles have recently drawn attention as efficient candidates in the class of non-precious metal photocatalysts for water splitting. Here, we have proposed Janus ScXY (X/Y = S, Se, or Te, X ≠ Y) monolayers as promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We have thoroughly investigated the structural stabilities of the ScXY monolayers, as a primary step to understand the splitting mechanism more accurately. It has been observed that Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are dynamically, thermally and mechanically stable, whereas the ScSTe monolayer is dynamically unstable. Moreover, based on hybrid functional (HSE06) calculations, these stable ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are semiconductors with direct band gaps of 1.810 and 0.921 eV, respectively. Considering spin–orbit coupling on top of the HSE06 calculations results in an insignificant change in the band gaps. The steady optical responses of Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe, respectively, in the visible and near IR spectra demonstrate their photocatalytic activities in the respective regions. Interestingly, we have observed excellent performance shown by the ScSeTe monolayer, where both surfaces are catalytically active, and maintain close to thermoneutral conditions with near-zero adsorption free energy at different H* coverages. Comparatively, the ScSSe monolayer shows poor performance for the HER due to strong bonds with the adsorbed hydrogen. Also, it has been confirmed that even the application of ±2% strain on the ScSSe monolayer does not enhance its HER activity. Our theoretical predictions demonstrate that out of all the Janus ScXY monolayers studied here, ScSeTe is the most active catalyst for the HER to efficiently split water, which certainly could make it worth performing further experimental investigations.
Introduction
The depletion of traditional fossil fuels and the long-term effects of consecutive environmental problems have forced the scientific community, as well as human society, to look for more efficient and green renewable energies to practice sustainable development.1 In this respect, hydrogen has been recognized as an ideal energy carrier, due to its high abundancy, it having the highest energy per mass ratio among all chemical fuels, and its emission of zero pollutants after burning.2,3 The feasibility of hydrogen as an alternative energy source strongly depends on the production of vast amounts of hydrogen in a highly economical way. Throughout the years, numerous efforts3–5 have been made to seek a sustainable and efficient way to produce hydrogen (H2). Among several possible methods, photocatalytic water splitting is considered a promising approach to produce hydrogen from the most economically viable resource: water. Generally, the water splitting mechanism consists of two half-reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H+ + 2e− → H2) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (2H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2). One of the key problems in photocatalytic water splitting is the development of photocatalysts with high solar energy conversion efficiency. A good photocatalytic material also should possess some unique properties, such as high stability, low toxicity, abundance and inexpensiveness.6 Up to now, platinum (Pt) and its alloys, nickel (Ni) alloys, and other noble metals have been considered as the most potent catalysts for HER activity.7,8 However, these metal alloys are less abundant and are expensive, which introduces large barriers to large-scale hydrogen production based on these catalysts.9,10 This paves the way for exploring alternative catalysts based on abundance and cost-effectiveness, as well as efficiency and activity. As a consequence, intensive research effort has been devoted to the search for replacement noble metal-based photocatalysts in the last few decades.11–14
With the success of graphene-based materials, various other two-dimensional (2D) compounds have received tremendous attention due to their possible application in energy scavenging areas, such as energy conversion, storage and catalysis, due to their unique and intriguing structural, electronic, transport and optical properties. For instance, several 2D transition metal disulfides (TMDs), such as MoS2 and WS2, have been reported to be promising photocatalysts owing to their large specific surface areas and high densities of catalytically active edge sites for the HER.15–18 However, one of the deficiencies of these 2D materials is that their basal planes are catalytically inactive.19 Furthermore, it has been reported that the metallic zigzag edge of MoS2 could be more catalytically active towards the HER than its semiconducting counterpart.20,21 In addition, doping with impurity atoms could decrease the recombination rates of photoinduced holes and electrons through enhancing the lifespan via confining the electronic carrier, hence improving the photocatalytic activity at the edges of the system.6,22–24 In particular, the types and concentrations of dopants are closely related to the performances of photocatalysts. For instance, C-doping into 2D borophene could enhance its HER activity.22 Also, the planar carbon tetracoordinated structures of pristine Al2C monolayers, as well as the monolayers doped with nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), boron (B), and sulphur (S), have been observed to be active catalysts for the HER.25 Most importantly, the atomic arrangement of catalytic materials is one of the prominent factors when it comes to improving their efficiency. Hence, from a structural point of view, a more reasonable design is required for 2D materials to increase the catalytic activity for the HER.
Very recently, a new family of 2D materials, called Janus MoSSe monolayers, was successfully synthesized via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.26 Unlike the randomly alloyed MoSSe, the top-layer Se atoms are fully sulfurized in MoSe2, resulting in broken structural symmetry along the out-of-plane direction. Further, intrinsic strain and a dipole moment are produced within the Janus MoSSe monolayers, which could enhance their HER activity. It has been reported that the intrinsic lattice strain within the Janus structure makes MoSSe monolayers more promising HER catalysts than pure MoS2 or MoSe2.27 Similar results are also found for Janus WSSe monolayers.28 Inspired by this new strategy to design transition metal dichalcogenide materials that show exceptionally good activity for photocatalytic water splitting,27–31 we have proposed a series of Janus ScXY (X/Y = S, Se, or Te, X ≠ Y) monolayers and investigated their catalytic properties for the HER based on first-principles calculations. Firstly, their structural stabilities are examined with respect to dynamic, thermal, and mechanical properties. Intriguingly, the Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers exhibit structural stability and could be worth synthesizing experimentally, whereas the ScSTe monolayer is structurally unstable. Therefore, we have solely focused on the HER performances of the stable ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers. It has been observed from calculations that the bonding of hydrogen on the ScSSe monolayers is too strong, relatively. And the strain effect from −2% to 2% is insignificant when it comes to altering the value of the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) on the ScSSe monolayers, which indicates that the ScSSe monolayers are insensitive to biaxial tensile strain within this range. Interestingly, Janus ScSeTe is a highly active catalyst for the HER in both an individual/differential process and an average/collective process, with near-zero ΔGH* values at different H* coverages. These findings could not only lead to a new entry in the class of HER catalysts for hydrogen production, but they could also be helpful for designing new 2D electronics.
Computational methods
In this work, first-principles calculations have been carried out based on the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),32,33 with the plane-wave pseudopotential method32 and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange–correlation functional.34 Besides this, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid (HSE06) exchange–correlation functional35 was employed to accurately describe the electronic properties of the Janus ScXY system (X/Y = S, Se, or Te, X ≠ Y). The spin–orbit coupling effect is also considered throughout the band structure calculations. The valence electrons are described using a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 520 eV. The convergence thresholds for the total energy and residual Hellmann–Feynman force are chosen to be 1.0 × 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. Based on structural optimisation, the HSE06 functional is also used to calculate the optical properties of the Janus layers. A Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh,36 a 7 × 7 × 1 k-mesh, is used for the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell with/without hydrogen adsorption (moreover a very fine k-mesh of 21 × 21 × 1 is chosen initially for primitive cell geometry optimization). A vacuum space of over 20 Å is considered along the Z-direction of the surface to avoid interactions between periodic images. The Grimme dispersion correction (D3)37 takes into account the long-range van der Waals (vdW) type interactions between layers, which are neglected by the GGA functional. Dipole correction is employed to treat the intrinsic dipole in the Janus ScXY system. Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) is considered in all calculations. Both ferromagnetic (FM) order and antiferromagnetic (AFM) order are considered for Sc atoms. The spin orders of Sc are set in a simple “↑↓↑↓” alternative manner along the [001] direction for the AFM case. It has been found that the difference between the FM and AFM configuration ground state total energies is negligible, in the order of 0.01 eV (in fact, more precisely, the FM configuration is 0.01 eV lower than the AFM order). Thus, we have chosen FM order for all the systems in this work, considering this small magnetic coupling. The dynamic stabilities of the structures are confirmed from phonon dispersions of the systems through the finite displacement approach using the PHONOPY package.38 Additionally, the thermal and mechanical stabilities of the systems are studied. Bader charge analysis39 has been performed to gain a profound understanding of charge transfer during the HER on the Janus monolayers.
Results and discussion
Structures and stabilities of the Janus ScXY monolayers
The crystal structures of the Janus ScXY monolayers are formed through sandwiching the Sc layer with one X layer and one Y layer (X/Y = S, Se, or Te, X ≠ Y), as depicted in Fig. 1(a) and S3.† Structural optimization has been performed by minimizing the ground state energy and atomic forces, together with varying the atomic positions in the primitive cell and the lattice constants of the cell.

The inset in (b) shows snapshots of the equilibrium structure from top and side views of the ScSSe monolayer at 600 K. (c) Phonon band dispersions for the ScSSe monolayer and (d) calculated formation energies and cohesive energies for ScX2 and ScXY (X/Y = S, Se, or Te, X ≠ Y) monolayers. 
The formation energy is calculated using the following expression: Efor = EScXY − ESc − EX − EY, where EScXY is the total energy of the ScXY monolayer (X/Y = S, Se, or Te) and the rest of the terms are the energies per atom of the equilibrium bulk phases. The cohesive energy is defined as: Ecoh = (EScXY − ESc − EX − EY)/3, where the last three terms are the total energies of the free constituent atoms, namely a single Sc, S, Se, or Te atom. The calculated formation energies and cohesive energies of the Janus layers are presented in Fig. 1(d). It is found that both the formation energies and cohesive energies are negative, which indicates an exothermic formation process for the Janus ScXY monolayers, similar to the corresponding parents. The optimized lattice constants and other structural parameters of the stable ScXY structures, along with the parents ScX2 and ScY2, are shown in Table 1 (except ScSTe, which is structurally unstable, as explained in the following discussion). The obtained lattice constant (a) and thickness (h) of the ScSSe monolayer are in between the parent structures, i.e., ScS2 and ScSe2. However, the lattice constant (a) of the ScSeTe monolayer is 4.075 Å, which is slightly larger than the average value of the corresponding parent phases ScSe2 and ScTe2. The ScS2 and ScSe2 parent monolayers show a magnetic moment of 1.0 μB, which is consistent with previous results.40 As expected, the Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers inherit this property well from the corresponding parent systems; it arises because of different electronegativities, causing different amounts of charge transfer from Sc to the X and Y atoms. Specifically, the outer planes of the X and Y atoms are negatively charged, whereas the basal planes of the Sc atoms between them are positively charged. Significantly, the Janus ScXY monolayers exhibit more interesting charge distributions, as shown in Fig. S1,† with different charge densities. For example, in the Janus ScSSe monolayer, the S atoms with stronger electronegativity gain more electrons from Sc atoms than Se atoms. This results in an asymmetric charge distribution between the two side surfaces. Bader analysis has been performed to get a better understanding of this charge transfer process from Sc atoms to chalcogen atoms. As shown in Table 1, the amount of charge transferred from the Sc atoms is 1.689 e for the ScSSe monolayer, which lies between the values for its parent structures. However, the corresponding S and Se atoms gain 0.925 e and 0.643 e, respectively, with a difference of 0.282 e, which is due to different electronegativities between the two side surfaces of the ScSSe monolayer.

To accurately confirm the stabilities of the Janus ScXY monolayers, the phonon dispersion spectra along the high symmetry points in the BZs of the respective structures are analysed critically. As shown in Fig. 1(c), no imaginary modes appear in the phonon frequency spectrum of ScSSe, which implies it has dynamic stability. Similar results are obtained for ScSeTe, as shown in Fig. S2(a).† Surprisingly, the phonon dispersion of the Janus ScSTe structure shows imaginary modes along the Γ → M and Γ → K paths, as displayed in Fig. S2(b),† which indicates that the ScSTe monolayer is dynamically unstable. Furthermore, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 600 K for 5 ps are carried out for all the proposed monolayers to investigate their structural stabilities. The evolution of the total energy is plotted in Fig. 1(b) for the ScSSe monolayer and Fig. S3† for the ScSTe and ScSeTe monolayers. Neither broken bonds nor structural reconstruction are discovered in the snapshots at 600 K for 5 ps for the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, in spite of the small deviations in total energy at the beginning, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and S3(a),† respectively. However, the total energy of the ScSTe monolayer is continuously increasing, as shown in Fig. S3(b),† throughout the 5 ps AIMD simulation at a temperature of 600 K, which also suggests its thermodynamic instability. Subsequently, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and layer modulus data are investigated to further examine the mechanical stabilities of the Janus ScXY structures. The Young's modulus Y(θ) and Poisson's ratio υ(θ) values along the in-plane θ direction in the 2D monolayers can be determined on the basis of the elastic constants Cij (ref. 41). (1) (2)
Here, A = C11C12 – C122/C66 – 2C12 and B = C11 + C22 – (C11C22 – C122)/C66. The obtained results are shown in Table 2 and Fig. S4.† It is well known that 2D materials that satisfy the Born criteria C11C22 − C122 > 0 and C66 > 0 can be considered as mechanically stable. As listed in Table 2, the calculated elastic constants are C11 = 53.652 N m−1, C22 = 53.572, N m−1, C12 = 25.264 N m−1, and C66 = 14.105 N m−1 for the ScSSe monolayer, suggesting that it is mechanically stable. Additionally, the obtained Young's modulus values are 41.738 N m−1 and 41.675 N m−1 along the x and y directions, respectively. Similar characteristics are observed for the ScSeTe monolayer with relatively lower values. The predicted Young's modulus values of both the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are largely lower than the values for graphene (350 N m−1) and MoS2 (123 N m−1),42,43 indicating that the Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are less rigid than those traditional 2D materials. The Poisson's ratio υ(θ) values of both the ScSSe and ScSeTe nanosheets are about 0.47, as shown in Fig. S3(b) and (d),† similar to most of these types of material (0–0.5).31,44 The slight buckling and intrinsic asymmetric structures give rise to the flexibility and slight anisotropic mechanical properties of the Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers.

Another important parameter, the layer modulus (γ), which describes the resilience of materials to hydrostatic stretching, can be calculated as follows: (3)
The calculated values are 39.438 N m−1 and 30.217 N m−1 for the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, respectively. As expected, the value of C66 = −5.387 N m−1 is negative for ScSTe, revealing that the ScSTe monolayer is mechanically unstable, agreeing well with our conclusions from phonon dispersion and AIMD simulation studies. Thus, we do not consider ScSTe when evaluating catalytic performances in the following discussion. Overall, the phonon dispersion and AIMD simulation results, as well as the elastic constants, establish that the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are dynamically, thermally and mechanically stable at room temperature. So far, only one representative Janus 2D material, MoSSe, has been successfully synthesized,29 whereas our aforementioned extensive stability studies strongly suggest that Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers could be potentially interesting to synthesize experimentally. To evaluate further and to obtain more electronic insight, we performed a systematic investigation into the various structural and electronic properties of Janus ScXY.
Electronic properties of the Janus layers
The intrinsic anisotropy in the Janus ScXY monolayers displays magnificent diversity in electronic properties. The electronic structures of pristine ScXY (X/Y = S, Se, Te, X ≠ Y) monolayers are calculated based on PBE as well as HSE06 exchange–correlational functionals (as shown in Fig. 2) to gain a better understanding of the effects of different surface atoms. The band structures of the corresponding parent ScX2 monolayers are depicted in Fig. S5.† It has been found that the ScS2 and ScSe2 monolayers are semiconductors with different spin channel densities, with band gaps of 0.741 eV and 0.570 eV at the PBE level, respectively. However, ScTe2 is non-magnetic and metallic, which is very consistent with previous studies.40,45 Interestingly, both the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are magnetic semiconductors, with direct band gaps of 0.842 eV and 0.268 eV using the PBE functional and 1.810 eV and 0.921 eV using the HSE06 functional, as shown in Fig. 2. Both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the G point. The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect is also considered and compared in Fig. S6.† The inclusion of this effect results in the band gaps changing to 0.764 eV and 0.164 eV using the PBE functional and 1.723 eV and 0.797 eV using the HSE06 functional. More specifically, in the case of SOC-PBE, the spin-down channels show small gaps of 0.859 eV and 0.26 eV just near the Fermi energy for ScSSe and ScSeTe, respectively. The spin specific gaps are also prominent using HSE06. The ScSSe monolayer possesses a direct band gap of 4.289 eV for the spin-up channel and 1.835 eV for the spin-down channel. Similarly, the ScSeTe monolayer exhibits band gaps of 3.22 eV and 0.958 eV for the spin-up channel and spin-down channel, respectively. Therefore, the inclusion of SOC does not affect the band inversion and results in a small change of 50–80 meV when employing a SOC gap. Notably, in Table 1, it is found that the total band gap of the ScSSe monolayer is exactly in between the parent phase ScS2 and ScSe2 monolayers for both PBE and HSE calculations, agreeing well with previous results.40,45

Optical response of the Janus layers
Photon absorption by the monolayers generates electron–hole pairs, which is one of the important primary steps in water splitting. To evaluate the visible light absorption abilities of the Janus ScXY monolayers, the optical absorption properties are calculated with a hybrid functional (HSE06) according to the method proposed by Gajdoš et al.46 The imaginary part of the dielectric tensor is calculated via a summation over the empty states as follows: (4)where c and v are conduction and valence band states, respectively. uck denotes the cell periodic part of the wavefunctions at the k point. The real part of the dielectric matrix is determined via the Kramers–Kronig transformation:46 (5)where P is the principal value of the integral. Then, the adsorption coefficient α(ω) is expressed as (6)
The calculated imaginary part εimag(ω) and adsorption coefficient α(ω) values of the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are shown in Fig. 3. The first peaks in εimag(ω) are observed at 2.11 eV and 1.13 eV, respectively, for the Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, which reveals that the ScSeTe monolayer is more active than ScSSe in the near-IR region. The absorption coefficient α(ω) spectra follow similar trends, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Note that the first maxima peaks emerge at about 3.0 eV and 2.6 eV for the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, respectively. So, both the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers exhibit strong absorption intensities in the visible light region, which is almost 50% of the overall solar radiation energy, hence they could maximise electron–hole pair generation. The high absorption coefficients of both monolayers indicate their excellent light-harvesting and energy conversion abilities. Compared to traditional 2D TMD monolayers, the atoms at the top and bottom surfaces are different in the Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers; this results in broken mirror symmetry and an intrinsic dipole moment along the out-of-plane direction. The calculated dipole moments are 0.123 Debye and 0.119 Debye for the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, respectively, which could improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, leading to electrostatic potential differences, as shown in Table 1. The obtained differences in electrostatic potential (ΔΦ) between the two side surfaces are 0.172 eV and 0.212 eV for the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, respectively. These ΔΦ values for the ScXY systems are much smaller compared to similar CrSSe (0.88 eV) and CrSeTe (0.98 eV) Janus system monolayers.47

The HER with defects and intrinsic strain

Effect of defects. 
Traditional 2D materials carry a fair number of defects, even in their pristine state, which could influence the material properties and even dominate them.48 Thus, before discussing the photocatalytic activities of pristine as well as defective Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, the formation energies of chalcogen vacancy defects are evaluated according to the following equation: Efor = E(VX/Y) − E(pristine) + ΔμX/Y,  (X/Y = S, Se, or Te)(7)here, E(pristine) and E(VX/Y) are the total energies of defect-free and defective ScXY monolayers, respectively. ΔμX/Y is the energy of a single chalcogen atom in its standard zero energy reference state. The calculated results show that the formation energies of vacancies decrease as the atomic number of the chalcogen increases, i.e., a Se vacancy at −0.342 eV in the ScSSe monolayer and a Te vacancy at −0.324 eV in the ScSeTe monolayer both are energetically favourable. It is worth noting that there are no noticeable structural changes during the structural relaxation of the defective Janus ScXY monolayers.
Generally, the HER is a two electron transfer process, which could follow either the Volmer–Heyrovsky or Volmer–Tafel mechanism.3,25 Irrespective of any uncertainty regarding the mechanism being followed, the first step is the adsorption of hydrogen. This is known as the Volmer reaction, where a proton gains an electron from the catalyst to form adsorbed hydrogen. This step can be described as H+ + e− + * → H*, where * denotes an active site on the catalyst surface. There are two possibilities for the subsequent step: one is the heterolytic Heyrovsky reaction, H* + H+ + e− → H2; the other one is the homolytic Tafel reaction, 2H* → H2. Under standard conditions [pH = 0, U = 0], the hydrogen adsorption free energy is defined as49ΔGH* = ΔE − ΔEZPE − TΔSH,where ΔE is the hydrogen adsorption energy, which is defined as  for an individual/differential process, assuming the one-by-one attachment of H to the surface. However, in an average/collective process, all hydrogen atoms absorbed on the substrate are simultaneously converted to H2, which is expressed as . Here, Esubstrate+nH and Esubstrate are, respectively, the total energies of the Janus monolayer with and without the adsorbed H atoms. EH2 is the total energy of a H2 molecule in the gas phase, and n is the number of hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the Janus monolayer. ΔEZPE is the zero-point energy difference of the hydrogen vibration energy between the adsorbed state and the gas phase. TΔSH is the entropy change between the hydrogen absorbed state and the gas phase. We have calculated the change in ΔEZPE and estimated the ΔEZPE − TΔSH values to be 0.29 eV and 0.26 eV at T = 300 K for the Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, respectively. According to the Sabatier rule for an ideal HER catalyst, ΔGH* should be zero.3
The free energy diagrams for the reaction are depicted in Fig. 4(a). It is observed clearly that the Te side of the pristine ScSeTe monolayer is very close to the thermoneutrality criterion, with ΔGH* = −0.043 eV. This closely resembles the metal Pt, which is known as an efficient HER catalyst.46 Furthermore, the Se surface of the ScSeTe monolayer is also revealed as an excellent catalytically active site for the HER, with ΔGH* = −0.057 eV. The local bonding between H* and single Se vacancies in the ScSeTe monolayer is too weak, which is reflected in the ΔGH* value of 0.641 eV. Additionally, this could be even weaker in the case of Te vacancies, raising ΔGH* to 0.801 eV, which indicates that the presence of vacancies will not enhance the catalytic activity of the ScSeTe monolayer.

(c) The positions of the VBMs and CBMs with respect to the redox levels for different Janus monolayers. 
This is completely different from the case of Janus MSSe (M = Mo or W), where the presence of chalcogen vacancies could serve as an efficient tuning method for the HER.28 Qualitatively, the Janus ScSSe system shows similar characteristics to ScSeTe, except for showing higher values of ΔGH*, which are in the range of −0.5–0.3 eV. This indicates the relatively too strong chemical adsorption of H* on the ScSSe surface. It is important to mention that compared with previous results for traditional TMD monolayers, where it was required to tailor the properties using strain, vacancy concentrations or both,17 the Janus ScSeTe monolayer is capable enough to function as an excellent catalyst for the HER without such extreme requirements.
In addition to analysing the explicit interactions of the key intermediate of the HER, the photocatalytic activity is verified further through carrying out band alignment of the Janus layers based on Mulliken's electronegativity theory.50 Band alignment has been done with respect to the vacuum level. The band edge positions also could straddle the redox potentials for water splitting. Here, we consider that the standard (at pH = 0) water reduction level is 4.44 eV and the water oxidation level is 5.67 eV with respect to the vacuum.51 The positions of the band edges, VBMs and CBMs with respect to the redox levels are shown in Fig. 4(c). The side-specific band alignments of the Janus layers are also shown in Fig. S7.† To be a good HER catalyst, the conduction band edge should be above but close to the energy of the water reduction level. Our results show that the CBM of ScSeTe is relatively close to the reduction level compared to ScSSe. This indicates that it is comparatively easy to drive electrons for water reduction (which is one of the main driving forces for the HER) in the former case. Moreover, the energy levels of the CBMs of the monolayers are much closer to the water reduction potential at pH = 7. Therefore, ScSeTe has much better photocatalytic water-splitting power than the ScSSe monolayer, which also supports our previous findings based on the hydrogen adsorption free energy data.


Hydrogen coverage effects. 
To further explore the influence of H* coverage on the catalytic activity for the HER, we have calculated the ΔGH* values for atomic hydrogen adsorption on the stable positions with respect to the top-S and top-Se sites for the Janus ScSSe monolayer and the top-Se and top-Te sites for the ScSeTe monolayer at different H* coverages [at pH = 0, U = 0]. The H* coverage (θ) is varied via adding hydrogen atoms (n = 1 to 4) one by one on the surface, and θ changes from 25% to 100% accordingly. H* coverages and adsorption sites significantly influence ΔGH*, especially for the ScSSe monolayer, as shown in Fig. 4(b). It is worth noting that the ΔGH* value of the ScSeTe monolayer can be tuned to zero on the Se surface at n = 4 and −0.04 eV on the Te surface at n = 2, suggesting higher catalytic activity for the HER at certain H coverages on both surface sides for the ScSeTe monolayer. The effects of the average/collective process are shown in Fig. S8.† It has been noticed that the differences between I(ΔGH*) and A(ΔGH*) are negligible at n = 4 on both the Se and Te sides of the ScSeTe monolayer, which demonstrates the good catalytic ability under both individual and collective processes. Comparatively, when the hydrogen coverage is increased to θ = 100% on the Janus ScSSe monolayer, A(ΔGH*) values on the S and Se surfaces are −0.446 eV and −0.282 eV, respectively. This implies that the chemical adsorption of H* on the Janus ScSSe surfaces is still too strong to release hydrogen molecules. By considering the I(ΔGH*) and A(ΔGH*) values of the Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, it is expected that the ScSeTe monolayer will be the best catalyst due to its high catalytic activities on both surface sides with near-zero ΔGH* at high hydrogen coverage.


PDOS and charge density differences with hydrogen adsorption. 
The bonding nature upon hydrogen adsorption is analysed using the PDOS of the Se atoms (the adsorption sites) of pristine and defective ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers before and after mono-hydrogen adsorption, as shown in Fig. 5. Looking at the PDOS of pristine ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, we find a sharp state near the Fermi level, contributed to by the 4pz orbitals of surface Se atoms, therefore strongly implying the existence of dangling bonds on the Se surface. This state of the ScSSe monolayer is closer to the Fermi level than that of the ScSeTe monolayer, which indicates that Janus ScSSe is inclined to form strong local bonding with adsorbed hydrogen. Upon H adsorption on the ScSSe monolayer, the signature from the 4pz orbitals of the Se atoms in the PDOS does not disappear but moves closer to the Fermi energy, which still symbolizes the existence of dangling bonds on the surface. In contrast, we find a downshift in the energies of the 4pz orbitals with hydrogen adsorption in the case of ScSeTe compared to its pristine PDOS, while the px/py orbitals away from the Fermi level change little; this reveals that the 4pz orbitals have bonded with hydrogen atoms. Interestingly, after introducing Se vacancies, the 4pz orbitals of the Se atoms move away from the Fermi level in both the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers, as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d), which results in weak bonding strengths with hydrogen adatoms. This is also consistent with the positive values of ΔGH*, as observed in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 5  Projected density of states (PDOS) on the surface Se atoms of Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers before (top panel) and after (bottom panel) hydrogen adsorption. (a) and (c), and (b) and (d) indicate pristine and defective structures, respectively. 
To provide further evidence for the enhanced catalytic performance of the stable ScXY monolayers, we have investigated the charge density differences, as depicted in Fig. S9.† The charge density distributes on the different surfaces based on variations in the dipole moment. Quantitatively, the net charge transferred to hydrogen from the Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers is 0.185 e and 0.04 e, respectively. The larger depletion of electrons on the ScSSe monolayer will lead to stronger hydrogen binding. Correspondingly, the hydrogen adsorption energy on the ScSSe monolayer will be much higher than on the ScSeTe monolayer, and this is confirmed in Fig. 4(a).


Effects of strain. 
Besides the defects, changes in pH, an external bias voltage or mechanical strain can play an important role in determining the HER activity of 2D monolayers.52 It has been reported that the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) can be tuned to zero by applying a strain value of 2.7% on 1 T-phase WS2.15 Hence, it naturally makes sense to explore the effects of strain on the ΔGH* values of Janus ScXY monolayers. Here, we take the ScSSe monolayer as an example; upon applying a homogeneous biaxial tensile strain in both the x- and y-directions from −2% to 2%, ΔGH* increases from −327 meV to −307 meV with a variation of 20 meV, as depicted in Fig. S10.† In contrast, the variation in ΔGH* is around 280 meV from 0% to 2.7% strain in a WS2 monolayer.15 The small variation of ΔGH* basically indicates that the ScSSe monolayer is insensitive to strain within the applied limits. Thus, the application of tensile strain on the Janus ScSSe monolayer does not decrease the density of states near the Fermi level to weaken hydrogen binding. This result agrees with the previous calculations regarding the parent structures of ScS2 and ScSe2 monolayers, where their electronic properties hardly changed regardless of strain.53

Conclusions
In this work, we have determined the photocatalytic activities of a new family of Janus ScXY (X/Y = S, Se, or Te) monolayers based on first-principles calculations. The thermal, dynamic, and mechanical stabilities of the Janus monolayers have been thoroughly investigated in this study. It is found that the ScSSe and ScSeTe monolayers are structurally stable, whereas ScSTe is unstable. The stable Janus ScSSe and ScSeTe systems show a semiconducting nature with band gaps of 1.810 eV and 0.921 eV. The optical absorption spectra demonstrate that these stable Janus monolayers show strong absorption intensities in the visible and near-IR regions; in particular, the ScSeTe monolayer is active even under near-IR light, suggesting that it could be highly efficient at utilizing a broad range of solar energy. Most importantly, the reaction coordinate plot of ΔGH* values of the ScSeTe monolayer confirms the thermoneutrality of both surfaces; hence both surfaces are the most catalytically active for the hydrogen evolution reaction out of the considered stable Janus systems. Moreover, ΔGH* can be further tuned through H* coverage on the ScSeTe monolayer. However, due to the strong H binding on the ScSSe monolayer, it shows poor performance for the HER at different H* coverages. Besides this, even an applied strain in the order of ±2% on the ScSSe monolayer could not facilitate changes in its HER activity. This theoretical prediction of the HER mechanism of the proposed Janus ScSeTe monolayer certainly paves the way for such a prediction to be extended to all other possible photocatalytic materials beyond the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, as well as Janus systems; it could also inspire experimental investigations to probe such mechanisms based on the reaction coordinates for many such exciting materials for water splitting, utilizing a broad range of the solar spectrum.
