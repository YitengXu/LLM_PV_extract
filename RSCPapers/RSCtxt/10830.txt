    , Accepted 4th July 2019First published on 19th July 2019AbstractConjugated polymers (P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12) with two different side chains based on thienyl-substituted benzodithiophene and dicarboxylic ester terthiophene were synthesized and applied in non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). Detailed studies revealed that the length of side chains in conjugated polymers showed a weak influence on their optical bandgaps and electrochemical properties, but a strong influence on their aggregation behaviors in solution, films, bulk heterojunction morphologies and photovoltaic performances. Among PSC devices, the P3TE-C8:ITIC-based device showed a PCE of 5.49%, a VOC of 0.814 V, JSC of 12.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 52.48%, while the P3TE-C12:ITIC-based device exhibited a higher PCE of 7.64%, with simultaneously improved photovoltaic parameters of VOC of 0.906 V, JSC of 14.20 mA cm−2 and FF of 59.36%. This work demonstrates that the reduction aggregation in conjugated polymers via changing the length of side chains is an effective method to improve PSC performances.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on conjugated polymers as electron donors and small molecules as electron acceptors have attracted more attention in recent years, since they are potential candidates for developing light-weight, flexible and large-area photovoltaic devices via roll-to-roll solution processing.1 In the past decade, a large number of low band-gap polymers were designed and synthesized, which have greatly promoted the development of fullerene-based PSCs.2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of fullerene-based PSCs has been increased to 11.7% so far, which approaches the theoretical efficiency limit of fullerene-based PSCs.3 In fullerene-based PSCs, the weak absorption in the visible and NIR regions of fullerene derivatives and the large energy loss of PSC devices are the major reasons for limiting their efficiencies.4 Compared to fullerene derivative-based electron acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors (NF) not only exhibit strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region, but also have small energy losses in the resulting PSC devices, and therefore, NF-based PSCs have been widely studied in recent years.5 Currently, the PCEs reach 16% for single-junction PSCs and 17% for tandem PSCs, respectively.6 Therefore, the development of polymer donors and electron acceptors is very important in improving the PCE of PSCs. Previous studies have predicted that the PCE of NF-based PSCs could reach 20% in single-junction devices.7 To promote the development of PSCs, not only novel NF acceptors, but also well-matched polymer donors are required. Therefore, it is essential to develop new conjugated polymer donors and establish their structure–performance relationship.
Currently, there are many electron-withdrawing building blocks that can be used to create high-performance conjugated polymers for PSCs such as fluorine-substituted benzothiadiazole (FBT),8 pyrrolobenzotriazole (TZBI),9 benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),10 fluorine-substituted benzotriazole (FBTA)11 and thiadiazole (TDZ).12 Besides these conjugated units, ester substituted thiophene is the unique one. Ester substituted thiophene was employed to construct conjugated polymers, which not only lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, but also enhance the intermolecular interaction of the resulting polymers.13 More importantly, the synthesis of ester substituted thiophene-based monomers is more easy than that of fused ring units. Since the first ester substituted thiophene-based polymer was reported over two decades ago,14 the PCE of this kind of polymer has exceeded 14% to date.15 Therefore, it is important to develop new ester substituted thiophene-based polymers for investigating the structure–property relationship in PSCs.
In this contribution, we used diester substituted thiophene as an electron-withdrawing unit and a famous 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene as an electron-donating unit to prepare conjugated polymers. In order to reduce the steric hindrance in the polymer main chain, a thiophene bridge was introduced between both units. Additionally, the side chains of conjugated polymers have been proved to play a key role in polymer solubility, self-organization, and BHJ morphology as well as device performance. The chemists usually employ side chain engineering, such as the position, length, geometry and branching position of side chains, to optimize photovoltaic efficiencies.16 Therefore, we synthesized two different lengths of side chains in the conjugated polymers (P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12) to investigate their structure–performance relationships. To exclude the influence of molecular weights on device performances in both polymers, we carefully prepared two polymers with the same degree of polymerization (DP) of 11 and excellent solubility in organic solvents. After blending with a non-fullerene acceptor (ITIC), the device P3TE-C8 exhibited a PCE of 6.35%, and P3TE-C12 showed a PCE of 7.48%. We carefully studied their optical and electrochemical properties, and BHJ morphologies as well as device performances via comparing different linear side chain lengths.
Experimental part
Instruments and measurements

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents using a Bruker DPX 300. The molecular weights of both polymers were estimated by high temperature (145 °C) gel permeation chromatography (GPC) by using monodispersed polystyrene as a standard and o-dichlorobenzene as an eluent. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement was carried out using a TGA-2050 Thermogravimetric Analyzer. Elemental analysis was performed using a Flash EA1112 instrument. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Reflex II-TOF Spectrometer using a 337 nm nitrogen laser with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as the matrix. The UV-Vis absorption measurements were carried out using a Hitachi U-3100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The film samples were prepared via spin-coating onto quartz plates (1 × 1 cm2).
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode cell using a computer-controlled GSTAT12. 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in anhydrous acetonitrile solvent was used as the electrolyte. The experiments were performed at room temperature with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under argon. A silver wire, a Pt wire and a glassy carbon electrode were used as the reference electrode, the counter electrode and the working electrode, respectively. The Fc/Fc+ redox couple was used as an external standard.
The current density–voltage J–V measurement was performed using a solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) along with AM 1.5G spectra, and the whole intensity was calibrated using a certified standard silicon solar cell (SRC-2020, Enlitech) at 100 mv cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data were obtained by using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech).
Polymer solar cell fabrication and testing: All devices were fabricated using the conventional device architecture of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/BHJ/PFN-Br/Al. Pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 10–15 ohm per square was cleaned by sequential sonication in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol twice for 20 min. Then it was placed into an oven and dried at 150 °C for 15 min. After ultraviolet-ozone treatment for 20 min, PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Materials, 4083) was spin-coated on ITO with a thickness of around 10 nm, which was measured using a surface profilometer (Bruker Dektak XT). The substrates were annealed for 15 min at 150 °C, and placed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The mixture of the polymer and acceptor solutions was prepared in chlorobenzene solution at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. The film thickness was controlled at around 90 nm by tuning the spin-coating speed. Finally, PFN-Br was spin-coated (3000 rpm, 30 s) onto the active layer as the cathode buffer layer, and the whole device was fabricated by vacuum evaporating Al metal electrodes (100 nm) to obtain an area of 4 mm2 cell.

X-ray diffraction. 
X-ray diffraction of films was performed using a theta–theta Philips PW 1820 Kristalloflex diffractometer with a graphite-monochromized Cu-Kα X-ray beam (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å) focusing on the thin film deposited as described in each case. The diffraction patterns were recorded in the 2θ range from 0° to 30°.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of both polymers is shown in Scheme 1. The starting material 2,5-dibromothiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (1) was converted to 2,5-dibromothiophene-3,4-dicarbonyl dichloride, and then allowed to react with octan-1-ol and dodecan-1-ol to produce compounds 2a and 2b, respectively. Afterwards, the Stille coupling reaction was performed between compound 2a (2b) and tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane to yield compound 3a (3b) in a high yield of 97% (98%). Finally, both desired monomers 4a and 4b were obtained via dibromination of their corresponding precursors. Both polymers P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12 were prepared via Stille coupling between 4a or 4b and monomer 5. In order to obtain similar molecular weights of both polymers for studies, the polymerization times were carefully controlled at 20 h and 60 h for P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12, respectively. The detailed synthesis is provided in the Experimental section. Both polymers have good solubility (>15 mg mL−1) in common solvents such as chloroform, toluene and chlorobenzene.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12. 
The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12 were 12.0 and 13.6 kg mol−1, with polydispersity indexes (Đ) of 2.4 and 2.5, respectively, evaluated by GPC using polystyrene as the standard and 1,2-dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 145 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). It is worth mentioning that both polymers have the same DP of 11. Therefore, we can minimize the influence of molecular weights of polymers on their optoelectronic properties and device performances in comparison with other reported studies.5c,17 Additionally, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) show that both polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability, with 5% weight loss at 400 and 380 °C for P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Optical, self-organization and electrochemical properties
The UV-Visible absorption spectra of both polymers were investigated in dilute chlorobenzene solutions and thin films as shown in Fig. 1. The temperature-dependent absorption spectra of both polymers were recorded in chlorobenzene solution. From 100 to 70 °C, the absorption profiles of both polymers did not change, implying that the total elimination of intermolecular interactions in both polymers acquired upon heating to at least 70 °C in chlorobenzene solutions. When the intermolecular interactions in both polymers were eliminated in chlorobenzene solutions (100 °C), both polymers showed the total overlap absorption profiles with absorption peaks at 343 nm and 465 nm (Fig. 1c). After the temperature was gradually cooled to 20 °C, the maximum absorption peaks (λmax) of P3TE-C8 showed a more significant redshift (517 nm) than that of P3TE-C12 (498 nm). In films (Fig. 1c), the P3TE-C8 showed a stronger shoulder peak at 646 nm than P3TE-C12 (576 nm). These results suggest that the shorter length of side chains in conjugated polymers shows a strong influence on their aggregation behaviours in solutions at low temperature as well as in films. The optical bandgaps of P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12 were calculated to be 1.92 and 1.96 eV, respectively, according to the onset of the solid-state absorption spectra. Additionally, both polymers have similar absorption coefficients of 9.17 ± 0.31 × 104 cm−1 (587 nm) for P3TE-C8, and 9.47 ± 0.38 × 104 cm−1 (582 nm) for P3TE-C12 in films.

In order to investigate the self-organization behaviours of both polymers, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed for their pure films, which were prepared by drop-casting from 10 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solutions as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The XRD results showed that P3TE-C8 had a smaller chain-to-chain distance of 2.02 nm (4.28°) than P3TE-C12 (2.36 nm, 3.74°), which was attributed to the shorter side chains of P3TE-C8; meanwhile, both polymers showed a similar π stacking distance (0.36 nm), but P3TE-C8 gave a stronger diffraction peak. These results implied that P3TE-C8 showed a stronger intermolecular interaction than P3TE-C12, which was in good agreement with UV-vis results that P3TE-C8 showed a stronger aggregation than P3TE-C12.
The electrochemical properties of both polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The oxidation curves of P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12 are shown in Fig. 2a. The HOMO levels of both polymers were calculated from their onset oxidation potential according to equation EHOMO = −e(Eox − EFc/Fc+ + 4.8) (eV). The corresponding values were −5.22 and −5.24 eV for P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was calculated to be −3.30 and −3.28 eV for P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12, respectively, according to ELUMO = EHOMO + Eopt.18 This result implies that the side chains of the polymers have a weak influence on their molecular energy levels. In addition, the energy level diagram of both polymer donors and acceptors (ITIC) is shown in Fig. 2b. Their energy level alignment indicates that both polymer donors match well with ITIC.

Photovoltaic performances
PSC devices were fabricated by employing a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC/PFN-Br/Al. The device performances of both polymers were carefully optimized by changing the donor/acceptor weight ratios (w/w), 1,8-diiodoctane DIO volume ratios (v/v) and thermal annealing temperatures for the active layers (Tables S1–S6, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best devices are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The P3TE-C8:ITIC-based device showed a PCE of 5.49%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) = 0.814 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) = 12.86 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) = 52.48%. The longer linear side chains of the P3TE-C12-based device yielded a higher PCE of 7.64%, with simultaneously improved photovoltaic parameters of VOC = 0.906 V, JSC = 14.20 mA cm−2 and FF = 59.36%. The difference in VOC (0.092 V) of both devices was significantly larger than their offset of HOMO levels (0.02 eV). The main reason could be attributed to the strengthening of the intermolecular interactions in P3TE-C8.19 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of both polymer-based devices are shown in Fig. 3b. Compared to the P3TE-C8:ITIC-based device, the P3TE-C12:ITIC-based device exhibited a significantly higher EQE in the broad wavelength range from 420 to 730 nm. The results suggested that JSC of the P3TE-C12:ITIC-based device was higher than that of the P3TE-C8:ITIC-based device. The JSC values integrated from the EQE spectra were 12.10 and 13.96 mA cm−2 for P3TE-C8:ITIC and P3TE-C12:ITIC-based devices, respectively, which fitted well with JSC obtained in the J–V measurements.

Non-radiative energy loss
To understand why both PSC devices have large different VOC values, we investigated their energy loss (Eloss), and the resulting data are listed in Table S7 (ESI†). The qVOC = Egap − Eloss. According to the literature reported,20 the Eloss of the resulting device includes three parts: (1) ΔE1, radiative recombination loss above the band gap, both devices have the same value of 0.276 eV according to Shockley–Queisser theory.21 (2) ΔE2, radiative recombination loss below the band gap, the P3TE-C8:ITIC blend has a larger ΔE2 (0.207 eV) than the P3TE-C12:ITIC blend (0.141 eV), these results could be attributed to a larger CT state in the P3TE-C8:ITIC blend. (3) ΔE3, non-radiative energy loss. This value was calculated from −kTln(EQEEL),22 wherein k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and EQEEL is the radiative quantum efficiency of the solar cell. We measured the EQEEL of both devices to be 7.97 × 10−7 and 2.18 × 10−6 for P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12-based devices (see Fig. S4, ESI†), respectively. The corresponding ΔE3 values were 0.363 and 0.337 eV for P3TE-C8:ITIC and P3TE-C12:ITIC-based devices, respectively. Therefore, the large difference in VOC of both devices could originate from their different CT states and the electroluminescence quantum efficiencies.
Charge generation and transport
To understand the different JSC and FF values in both PSC devices, we investigated the photogenerated current density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of both devices as shown in Fig. 4a.23 The photocurrent density (Jph) is defined as Jph = JL − JD, wherein JL and JD represent the light and dark current density, respectively. The effective voltage (Veff) is defined as the difference between the compensation voltage (V0, determined when the Jph is zero) and the applied voltage (V). The Jsat is defined as the saturation photocurrent density. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) of the P3TE-C12:ITIC-based device (87.0%) was higher than that of the P3TE-C8:ITIC-based device (85.5%), which was consistent with the JSC of both PSC devices. Moreover, the charge carrier mobilities of both devices were also investigated by the photo-CELIV transient method.24 All the transient measurements were recorded by applying a 0.14 V s−1 linearly increasing reverse bias pulse without delay time. The photo-CELIV transients of the two devices are shown in Fig. 4b. The charge carrier mobility of the P3TE-C12:ITIC-based device was calculated to be 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was higher than that of the P3TE-C8:ITIC-based device (1.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results were in good agreement with a higher FF in the P3TE-C12:ITIC-based device.

Morphologies of the blended films
The only difference in both PSC devices is the side chain length of polymer donors, which could lead to the different BHJ morphologies due to their different aggregation behaviours. Therefore, the morphologies of pure polymer films and the polymer:ITIC blended films were observed by AFM measurements. Fig. 5 shows the AFM images of neat polymer films and polymer:ITIC blended films. The root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of the neat P3TE-C8 film was 2.04 nm, which was significantly bigger than that of the neat P3TE-C12 film (RMS = 0.76 nm). Meanwhile, obvious gaps were observed in the neat P3TE-C8 film, which limited the continuity of the film. In contrast, the neat P3TE-C12 film exhibited a uniform and continuous surface. In the blend films, the P3TE-C12:ITIC blended film exhibited good nanoscale bi-continuous phase separation with a small RMS of 1.54 nm, but the P3TE-C8:ITIC film showed the large-scale phase separation; it was harmful for exciton dissociation and charge transport. This was the main reason that the P3TE-C8:ITIC-based device had a low JSC and PCE.

Conclusions
We presented two novel conjugated polymers (P3TE-C8 and P3TE-C12) with different side chains, which were composed of thienyl-substituted benzodithiophene and dicarboxylic ester terthiophene. Both polymers had the same DP of 11 and good solubility in common organic solvents. These two side chains in conjugated polymers showed a weak influence on their optical bandgaps (1.92 eV for P3TE-C8 and 1.96 eV for P3TE-C12) and HOMO levels (−5.22 eV for P3TE-C8 and −5.24 eV for P3TE-C12), but a strong influence on their aggregation behaviours. The P3TE-C8:ITIC-based photovoltaic device showed a PCE of 5.49%, a VOC of 0.814 V, JSC of 12.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 52.48%. After extending the length of side chains of polymers, the BHJ morphology of the P3TE-C12:ITIC blended film was optimized by weakening molecular aggregation in P3TE-C12, and thus the P3TE-C12:ITIC-based device exhibited a higher PCE of 7.64%, with simultaneously improved device parameters of VOC = 0.906 V, JSC = 14.20 mA cm−2 and FF = 59.36%. This work demonstrates that the reduction aggregation in conjugated polymers by tuning the length of side chains is an effective method to improve device performance.
