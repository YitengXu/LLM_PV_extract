    , Accepted 30th May 2021First published on 1st June 2021AbstractThree polymer donors named Qx-8F, Qx-10F, and Qx-12F, with similar chemical structures, were synthesized. The energy level of these donors is manipulated by precisely controlling the fluorination sites. We demonstrate that the exciton dissociation efficiency is gradually enhanced from Qx-8F:Y6 to Qx-12F:Y6, leading to improved open circuit voltage VOC and short circuit current density JSC for donors with a higher degree of fluorination. Simultaneously, the trap-assisted recombination or bimolecular recombination intensity is reduced, while the extraction rate is enhanced because of increased charge carrier mobilities, leading to an increase in fill factor for donors with higher amount of fluorine atoms. The optimized device based on Qx-12F with the most fluorine atoms and the non-fullerene acceptor Y6 shows the highest power conversion efficiency of 15.21%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, JSC of 24.55 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 72.88%. It is further demonstrated that the optimized ternary device based on the Qx-12F:PM6:Y6 blend provides a power conversion efficiency of 16.32%.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture have attracted tremendous attention owing to their high efficiency, compared to their single junction counterparts.1,2 Due to the relatively low dielectric constants of organic materials, excitons with a charge transfer nature at the donor–acceptor interface possess a binding energy in the range of 0.3–0.5 eV.3 A driving energy is needed to overcome the binding energy to achieve efficient charge dissociation.3,4 The generated charge carriers from exciton dissociation need to be transported towards the respective electrodes in a hopping manner.5 Therefore, enhancing the exciton dissociation while maintaining efficient charge carrier transport is of vital importance for OSCs to obtain high performance. Previous studies suggest that the difference in the electronic orbital energy offset of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels between the donor and acceptor is a key factor for the charge separation efficiency.6,7 Efficient charge separation is anticipated for fullerene-based systems whenever the energy level difference exceeds 0.3 eV.7,8 However, there are reports that efficient charge separation can still be obtained for material systems with the energy offset ΔHOMO as small as 0–0.06 eV for non-fullerene based OSCs.9,10 Since intrinsically the HOMO level of donor materials and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of acceptors determine the open circuit voltage, a reduction of the HOMO level of donor materials while keeping large enough ΔHOMO to maintain efficient charge separation would potentially enhance the open circuit voltage VOC and short circuit current density JSC. Therefore, the design of donor materials is substantial for efficient OSCs.
Recently, great attention has been paid to non-fullerene acceptors, but it should be noted that the study on the relationship between a donor material and non-fullerene acceptor is still rare.11 In this work, three polymeric donors were synthesized and systematically studied in devices with the well-known non-fullerene acceptor Y6. Quinoxaline (Qx)12,13 and benzodithiophene (BDT)14,15 are widely utilized in organic electronic materials due to their rigid plane structures with the ease of chemical modification, while simultaneously possessing high electron transport mobility.16–19 Because of strong light absorption, planarity, and photochemical stability, tetrafluorobenzene (TFB) can be a multi-functional unit for constructing semiconductor materials for solar cells.20–22 Meanwhile, fluorine atoms have the highest electronegativity (3.98),23 and fluorination has been demonstrated as an effective method to tune the HOMO level of organic semiconductors.24 Fluorination would lead to a deeper HOMO energy level for organic semiconductors.25 Besides, fluorine atoms have a very small van der Waals radius (1.35 Å) and a strong interaction with carbon and hydrogen atoms,26–28 leading to better molecular planarity and intermolecular packing, giving rise to high charge carrier mobilities.29,30
Based on the above considerations, three polymer donors with TFB, Qx and BDT units, named Qx-8F, Qx-10F and Qx-12F (Fig. 1) were designed and synthesized. The nomenclature of these polymers follows the fact that there are 8, 10 and 12 fluorine atoms in their monomer. By gradually increasing the fluorination, the HOMO of the polymer is shifted to a deeper level. For OSCs with Y6 as the acceptor, devices based on these donors possess sufficient energy offsets (over 0.47 eV), leading to efficient charge separation. Because of a higher absorption coefficient, larger charge mobilities, and lower recombination intensity in devices based on fluorinated polymer donors, the fill factor (FF) is also enhanced.31 Therefore, device parameters including VOC, JSC and FF are simultaneously boosted via the simple fluorination strategy. OSCs with the Qx-12F donor show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.21%, while it is only 6.07% for devices with Qx-8F and 12.75% for those with Qx-10F.

Results and discussion
The chemical structures of donor polymers Qx-8F, Qx-10F, Qx-12F, and non-fullerene acceptors (Y5 and Y6) are shown in Fig. 1a. The building blocks of polymer donors are based on TFB, Qx and BDT moieties. There is a gradual increase of fluorine atoms of the monomer from Qx-8F to Qx-10F to Qx-12F. The detailed synthesis procedures and characterization of the polymers are described in the ESI.† The number-averaged molar masses (Mn) of Qx-8F, Qx-10F, and Qx-12F were 25.69, 30.25, and 27.13 kDa, with the dispersity values (Đ: Mw/Mn) of 2.47, 2.36, and 2.24 (Fig. S33–S35†), respectively. As shown in Fig. S1,† all polymer donors have excellent thermal stability, with a decomposition temperature (Td) higher than 400 °C. With the increase of fluorine atoms, the decomposition temperature rises, indicating that the thermal stability of OSCs can be improved.14 The normalized absorption spectra of neat polymer donors, Y5 and Y6 measured in films are shown in Fig. 1c. These polymers exhibit absorption edges at 746, 732, and 722 nm, corresponding to optical bandgaps of 1.66, 1.69, and 1.72 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, these polymeric donors also have strong absorption peaks at 350–500 nm, which originate from the localized π–π* transition.32 The maximum absorption coefficients of the three polymers are 2.18 × 105, 2.31 × 105, and 2.38 × 105 cm−1 (as shown in Fig. S2†), indicating a gradual increase of absorption from Qx-8F to Qx-10F to Qx-12F. The corresponding absorption peaks and extinction coefficients are summarized in Table 1. The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra in chloroform are shown in Fig. S2.† Because of the molecular aggregation in the solid state, the absorption onset is red-shifted from solutions to films. After blending with Y5 or Y6, the absorption range of the active layer extends from the UV-Vis to near infrared region. It is anticipated that such a broad absorption range can improve the exciton charge separation and carrier transfer efficiency,33 leading to higher JSC.

The energy levels of donor and acceptor materials were determined with a combination of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV).31 As shown in Fig. S3† and Table 1, the HOMO level of Qx-8F is located at 5.11 eV below the vacuum level, while it shifts to 5.18 eV and 5.22 eV for Qx-10F and Qx-12F, with a gradual increase of fluorination. Simultaneously, the LUMO level changes from 3.45 eV for Qx-8F, to 3.49 eV for Qx-10F and to 3.50 eV for Qx-12F. Simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed to provide further insights into the energy level shifts of Qx-8F, Qx-10F and Qx-12F. To save the calculation capacity, two repeating units of each polymer were used, while the long alkyl side chains were replaced by methyl groups (Fig. S4†).25 DFT calculation shows that the electron cloud of the HOMO level is well delocalized along the whole conjugated main chain within the BDT and TFB groups, while the electron cloud of the LUMO level is mainly distributed among the Qx units. When fluorine atoms are introduced into the BDT group for Qx-10F and Qx-12F, a clear change of the electron cloud distribution of the HOMO level is noted, leading to a gradual shift of the HOMO energy level. Since the LUMO energy is mainly distributed among the Qx units, the LUMO energy levels are barely changed after the introduction of fluorine atoms into the BDT moiety.
Photovoltaic properties of these polymeric donors are studied in devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:Y6(or Y5)/PDINN/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized PSCs based on polymer donors and Y6 as the acceptor are presented in Fig. 2a. The photovoltaic performance parameters of the corresponding devices are summarized in Table 2. As the number of fluorine atoms increases, the VOC values of OSCs based on polymer donors Qx-8F, Qx-10F and Qx-12F with acceptor Y6 gradually rise, which are 0.63, 0.78 and 0.85 V, respectively. As the HOMO energy level gets deeper, the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor gets larger, leading to higher VOC.8,34 Meanwhile, because of a gradual increase in absorption, there is an increase of JSC. Compared to Qx-8F, both VOC and JSC are higher for devices with the donor Qx-12F.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was further measured to investigate the wavelength dependent response, as shown in Fig. 2b. A broad photon-to-current response in the wavelength range of 400 to 850 nm is noted. For devices based on Qx-10F:Y6 and Qx-12F:Y6, the entire photon-to-current response is stronger than that of devices with Qx-8F:Y6. The maximum EQE value reaches 80.85% and 80.00% for Qx-10F and Qx-12F, respectively, compared to the 71.65% for Qx-8F. The integral current densities from EQE spectra are 18.69, 24.34 and 24.22 mA cm−2, for Qx-8F, Qx-10F and Qx-12, respectively, consistent with those obtained from J–V measurements.
Exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and photoluminescence quenching efficiency were investigated to study the influence of ΔHOMO on exciton dissociation.35 The photocurrent density Jph is given by the difference between the light JL and dark current density JD.11 Supposing all the generated excitons are dissociated into free charges and collected by electrodes, when Jph reaches saturation (Jsat) at large reverse bias (Veff = 2 V in this case), Pdiss can be defined as Jph/Jsat.35 The details are presented in Fig. 2d. In Y6 based systems, the Pdiss increases with the gradual decrease of ΔHOMO, from Qx-8F to Qx-12F. The ΔHOMO is still as large as 0.47 eV for the Qx-12F:Y6 system, as summarized in Fig. 2c.
It is known that the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL) of OSCs is related to the VOC loss.34 At present, the lowest non-radiative voltage loss for OPVs can reach a very low value (0.16 eV),36 but there is no clear research on it. The non-radiative voltage loss ΔVOC,nr is defined as:37 ΔVOC,nr = −KT/q × ln(EQEEL)(1)
Lower electroluminescence would give rise to a reduced VOC loss. Since the electroluminescence EQE is directly related to the photoluminescence intensity under photon excitation, we here quantitatively investigate the photoluminescence quenching effect induced by non-fullerene acceptors.37 As shown in Fig. S5,† the PL intensity of the polymer donor can be significantly quenched by non-fullerene acceptors, indicating an efficient energy transfer from the donor to acceptor. The photoluminescence is almost completely quenched for the Qx-12F:Y6 blend, which is much lower than that for Qx-8F and Qx-10F with acceptor Y6. According to eqn (1), the non-radiative voltage losses would be less for the Qx-12F system, qualitatively consistent with the device result of VOC summarized in Table 2.
Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for these polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors was measured to investigate the charge separation efficiency, mainly the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) and the photo-induced hole transfer (PHT) processes.8,10 The wavelength dependent IQE spectra are shown in Fig. 3a for devices based on the non-fullerene acceptor Y6. Because most PHTs are less efficient than PETs,10 they can be used as a parameter to describe the hole transfer efficiency in different blends. For each acceptor series, IQE spectra obtained by normalizing the internal quantum efficiency of PHT to PET (IQEPHT/IQEPET) give the information on the degree of imbalance between PET and PHT processes.9 As shown in Fig. 3a, for Qx-10F:Y6 and Qx-12F:Y6, the PHT efficiency is as good as PET, suggesting that the HOMO energy level offset is sufficient to drive hole transfer at the D/A interface. However, for the Qx-8F:Y6 blend, a comparably low IQE is noted resulting from a reduced PHT, giving rise to a lower JSC than that for Qx-10F:Y6 and Qx-12F:Y6 (Table 1). Since the HOMO energy offset is 0.58 eV in the Qx-8F:Y6 system (Fig. 2c), such a lower IQE in the Qx-8F:Y6 system demonstrates that other parameters such as mobility and morphology also contribute to the PHT processes.

Once the electron–hole pairs separate into free charges, subsequent bimolecular recombination or trap filling events could happen before they are collected by electrodes. First, the dependence of JSC and VOC on light-intensity was measured to investigate the charge carrier recombination mechanism. The correlation of light intensity P and JSC can be described as Jsc ∝ Pα. When α is 1, charge carriers generated after charge separation are completely collected by electrodes, in which case the bimolecular recombination is negligible.11 As shown in Fig. 3b, the α values of Qx-8F:Y6, Qx-10F:Y6 and Qx-12F:Y6 are 0.992, 0.999 and 0.999, respectively, proving that the bimolecular recombination intensity in these devices is low. The slightly lower α in Qx-8F:Y6 devices indicates that the bimolecular recombination intensity is relatively high than that in Qx-10F- and Qx-12F-based OSCs.
Meanwhile, the dependence of VOC on light intensity P was measured to investigate the trap-assisted recombination. The relationship between VOC and P can be described as VOC ∝ nKT/qln(P), in which n is the ideality factor, K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. The slope of 2KT/q in a log–linear plot represents that trap-assisted recombination is the dominant recombination mechanism, while a slope of KT/q indicates that bimolecular recombination is the dominant recombination process.35 As shown in Fig. 3c, the ideality factor of Qx-8F is 1.89, indicating that the recombination happens mainly in a trap-assisted recombination manner. The ideality factor is 1.53 for Qx-10F and is 1.17 for Qx-12F. The ideality factor of VOC–logP demonstrates that the main recombination mechanism in Qx-12F is bimolecular type. However, as shown in Fig. 3b, the bimolecular intensity for Qx-12F is lower than that for Qx-8F and Qx-10F. Therefore, higher amounts of traps were observed, together with a stronger bimolecular recombination intensity in the Qx-8F system, compared to those for Qx-10F and Qx-12F, giving rise to a lower FF.38 The light intensity dependent JSC and VOC results demonstrate that the recombination losses in forms of either trap-assisted or bimolecular types are suppressed in OSCs with the polymeric donor Qx-12F. In order to better illustrate the effect of device charge extraction and trap-assisted recombination, transient photocurrent (TPC)39 measurement is carried out, which is shown in Fig. S13 and S14.† For the polymer:Y6 device, we observe fast turn-on and turn-off dynamics (Fig. S13†) with very little change in the shape of the transient photocurrent curves under light intensity up to 1 sun equivalent. The rise/fall times of the polymer:Y6 device (defined as the time taken to go from 10% to 90% of the full response)39 are 2.70, 2.06, and 1.14 μs, respectively (Fig. S14†). Qx-12F:Y6 has the fastest charge extraction, accounting for a lower trap density, while it is as long as 2 μs for devices with Y5.39,40
The relationship between the charge recombination of the BHJ active layer and the HOMO offset can be inferred from the TPV measurement (details in the ESI†). Carrier lifetimes (τ) were measured under open-circuit conditions, obtained by fitting TPV decay dynamics with a mono-exponential function over a broad range of light intensities (1–80% max. LED intensity).41 Charge-extraction (CE) measurements were performed on the same devices under illumination with various light intensities, to estimate the corresponding carrier densities n. As shown in Fig. S6,† higher carrier densities for Qx-10F:Y6 and Qx-12F:Y6 were noted, which may stem from higher exciton dissociation efficiency. The bimolecular recombination rate constant krec is then determined using the carrier lifetime and density: krec = 1/(λ + 1)nτ,(2)where λ is the recombination order determined from the analyses presented in Fig. S6.† As shown in Fig. 3d, at all given carrier densities, krec for the Qx-8F:Y6 is substantially larger than that for devices based on Qx-10F:Y6 or Qx-12F:Y6.
For an OSC with an active layer thickness L, the extraction rate to reach the electrode can be estimated as:38 kex = 2μe,hVint/L2(3)in which μ is the charge carrier mobility and Vint is the internal voltage, which is related to the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor.
The electron and hole mobilities of blended films were determined independently within the space charge-limited current (SCLC) region, based on single-carrier devices. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S1,† the electron mobility for Qx-8F and Qx-10F blended with Y6 is 3.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while it is 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the Qx-12F:Y6 blend. An enhanced hole mobility is also noted for Qx-12F:Y6. The hole mobility is 5.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Qx-8F:Y6, while it slightly decreases to 5.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Qx-10F:Y6 and further increases to 1.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Qx-12F:Y6. Therefore, by increasing the fluorination to Qx-12F, the electron and hole mobilities are simultaneously enhanced by a factor of 3–4, compared to those of Qx-8F:Y6. As summarized in Table S1,† the ratio between electron and hole mobilities μe/μh is close to 1 for Qx-10F and Qx-12F with Y6, while the ratio is 0.64 for Qx-8F:Y6. Therefore, the charge transport is more balanced for OSCs based on Qx-10F and Qx-12F. Because of the synergistic effects from enhanced mobilities and internal voltages (Fig. 1c), the extraction rate (eqn (3)) for OSCs based on Qx-12F:Y6 is enhanced by a factor of ∼5 for electrons and holes simultaneously. Therefore, from the Qx-8F to Qx-12F system, the fill factor is significantly enhanced from 50.71% to 72.88%, since it is dependent on the ratio between the extraction rate and recombination rate.38
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to study the influence of fluorine atoms on the morphology. As shown in Fig. 4, comparable or even lower roughness can be obtained in blended films for Qx-8F and Qx-10F with Y6. The Qx-12F neat film has a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.20 nm (Fig. S8†), while it slightly increases to 1.71 nm after blending with Y6. According to TEM, Qx-10F:Y6 and Qx-12F:Y6 show a more uniform interpenetrating network structure than Qx-8F:Y6 (Fig. 4), which is conducive to the diffusion and dissociation of excitons, leading to high JSC.

It should be noted that Qx-8F, Qx-10F and Qx-12F with a gradual shift of the HOMO energy level can also be utilized together with other acceptors. When blended with another non-fullerene acceptor Y5, with the chemical structure shown in Fig. 1b, a similar VOC trend can be noted, as summarized in Table S2.† The detailed device performance based on these polymer donors and acceptor Y5 are summarized in Fig. S9–S12.† In general, the efficiency of OSCs based on polymeric donors blended with Y6 is higher than that of those with Y5, resulting from broader absorption and more balanced charge mobilities, as shown in Fig. 1c and Table S1.† It is worth noting that OSCs with Qx-12F:Y5 exhibit a limited photocurrent, which might result from large phase segregation (Fig. S12†), since Qx-12F is highly fluorinated while Y5 is not. For OSCs with Qx-8F and Qx-10F blending with Y5, the PCE reaches 10.23% and 10.54%, respectively.
The device performance based on Qx-12F and Y6 can be further improved by mixing with another polymer donor PM6.32 As shown in Fig. S13,† the PCE of ternary devices can reach 16.32%, with the maximum EQE up to 90.63%.
Conclusions
In summary, three polymeric donors were designed and synthesized to achieve efficient OSCs. By gradually increasing the fluorine atoms of the monomer from Qx-8F to Qx-10F to Qx-12F, the HOMO energy level is downshifted. For a given acceptor, the energy offset between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor gets larger, leading to higher VOC in devices. When blended with the non-fullerene acceptor Y6, lower trap-assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination intensity were observed for devices based on Qx-12F, compared to those of the Qx-8F system. This was revealed by systematic investigations on the nongeminate recombination rate, and light intensity dependent VOC and JSC. Together with enhanced charge mobilities by a factor of 4–5 for both electrons and holes, the extraction rate is significantly improved for OSCs with Qx-12F:Y6, in comparison to those with Qx-8F:Y6. Because of the enhanced extraction rate and reduced recombination intensity, the FF is significantly enhanced by a factor of 1.44 from Qx-8F to Qx-12F. Therefore, by precisely controlling the fluorination of polymer donors, the VOC, JSC and FF are improved simultaneously, leading to an efficient OSC with a PCE of 15.21%. It is anticipated that our results may pave ways for further development of highly efficient organic solar cells based on non-fullerene acceptors with tailor-made polymer donors.
