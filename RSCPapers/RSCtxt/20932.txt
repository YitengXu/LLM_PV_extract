    , Accepted 12th June 2013First published on 17th June 2013AbstractA series of organic dyes with alkaline pyridine-N-oxide as the electron acceptor and anchoring group have been synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells. Photoelectrical data show a good coordination between pyridine-N-oxide and TiO2 films, which effectively guarantee the injection and adsorption of the dye molecules. With the simple WL102 dye, the best photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 3.72% and an excellent IPCE value about 95% have been achieved under optimized conditions.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention due to the low-cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiency since 1991.1 To increase the power conversion efficiency, attention has been paid to the development of new dyes, efficient electrolytes and the improvement of nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes.2 One important aspect is the development of more efficient organic dye molecules with good photoelectrical properties and easy synthesis. Now, DSSCs based on the donor-linker-acceptor, also known as D-π-A dyes have reached power conversion efficiencies as high as 10–11%.3 Unlike the multiple choices of the donor parts, for the organic dyes, acidic groups such as carboxylic acid,4–6 cyanoacrylic acid7–9 or rhodanine-3-acetic acid10,11 were commonly introduced as acceptor and anchoring groups. These carboxyl groups enabled good adsorption and electronic communication with the TiO2 films, but limitations on the acceptor groups are not good for developing much more excellent dye structures. Ooyama et al., have published fluorescent organic sensitizers with pyridine as the acceptor and got the highest efficiency of 1.89%.12 The main reasons for the low efficiency are the poor dye adsorption on TiO2 and the weak electron-drawing ability of the pyridine leading to the poor electronic property of the dyes. In organic synthesis, pyridine-N-oxide is usually introduced to avoid the formation of pyridine cation, where oxygen acts as an electron-withdrawing group to reduce the electron density on nitrogen. In particular, there is an internal charge transfer existing inside of molecule which forms a weak basicity property of the pyridine-N-oxide.13 Herein we reported the introduction of pyridine-N-oxide as a new stronger dye acceptor in the hope of improving the spectral response of the dye molecule while maintaining good charge injection and therefore designed three novel organic dyes.
The structures of the new dyes WL101–WL103 are shown in Fig. 1 and the synthetic details are described in Scheme S1, ESI. †A reference dye WL101-R with pyridine as the acceptor group is also synthesized here to show the difference with its oxidized form WL101.
 Fig. 1  The structures of dyes WL101-R–WL103. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dyes are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. All of the dyes show good absorption between 300–500 nm; the main absorption bands for all dyes are ascribed to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) transition, the shorter wavelength absorption are gained from the S0–S2 transition. Compared with the absorption spectrum of WL101-R, WL101 with the pyridine-N-oxide as acceptor is red-shifted about 25 nm from 347 nm to 370 nm, which can be attributed to the stronger withdrawing ability of pyridine-N-oxide. WL102 shows the largest absorption wavelength at 405 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 3.33 × 104 M−1 cm−1. After being adsorbed on the thin TiO2 film, all these dyes showed broader absorption bands and about 10 nm red-shift in the absorption compared to those measured in DCM solution.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and different pulse voltammetry (DPV) were tested and shown in Fig. S2, ESI†. The energy levels of WL101–WL103 were determined by CV and the corresponding data are also collected in the Table 1. The ground state oxidation potentials were calculated by the CV data, which are sufficiently positive compared to the redox potential of the iodide/triiodide couple (0.35 V vs. NHE) used as an electrolyte. Additionally the estimated LUMO levels of the dyes are all more negative than the conduction-band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring an efficient electron injection process from the excited state of dye molecule into the conduction band of TiO2. Compared with the electrochemical data of WL101-R, WL101 with the pyridine-N-oxide shows a less negative LUMO value, which also proves the stronger electron-drawing property of the new pyridine-N-oxide acceptor.
The four dyes were fabricated into DSSC devices for the photovoltaic characterizations. The J–V curves and the corresponding incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) action spectra for the devices sensitized by WL101–WL103 devices were shown in Fig. 3, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, WL dyes give similar open-circuit photovoltages (Voc) ranging from 0.610–0.630 V but quite different short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), which are all shown in Table 2. For the cells sensitized by WL101-R, the Jsc is 1.98 mA cm−2, while for its oxidized counterpart WL101, the cell yeilds a Jsc of 3.67 mA cm−2. To explain this significant difference, the energy state and electron distribution were calculated to gain insight into it. The optimized geometries and isodensity plots of the frontier orbitals of the chromophores are shown in Table S1, ESI†. It is clear that the HOMO and LUMO localized more reasonable for WL101 owing to the stronger electron withdrawing characteristic of pyridine-N-oxide unit compared to WL101-R. In addition a test of adsorption amount of the dyes on TiO2 films was investigated and the result showed the amount of WL101 is almost 5 times more than the adsorbed WL101-R. This is also responsible for the large difference of Jsc values between these two dyes.

For WL102 and WL103, the introduction of a thiophene bridge in the molecular structures decreases the dihedral angle and broadens the absorption windows, which leads to an enhanced photovoltaic performance. It can be seen that the Jsc got by the cell sensitized by WL103 is only 7.09 mA cm−2, which is lower than WL102 by around 20%. Due to the big steric hindrance provided by the lateral long alkyl chain and comparative smaller adsorption sites of this dye series, the adsorption amount of WL103 is two folds less than WL102 shown by the adsorption amount test. Based on the optimized structures, WL102 gives the highest Jsc value of 8.65 mA cm−2 and yields the greatest efficiency (η) 3.72% among the four dyes under the same experimental conditions. The integrated current calculated from IPCE showed the same trend with the J–V curves for all the four dyes. WL102 shows an excellent IPCE value of over 90% from 400 nm to 480 nm.
We have also investigated the FTIR of the four dyes on the TiO2 to get to know the adsorption properties, and the FTIR spectra for these dyes are shown in Fig. 4. Here for the dye adsorbed on the TiO2, the spectra were recorded with TiO2 as a blank. For WL101-R, the spectra showed that the stretching bands of CC, CN appear at around 1590, 1540, 1490 cm−1.13–15 For the pyridine-N-oxide dyes, the characteristic peaks of pyridine shifted a little to a lower wavenumber relative to the non-oxidised dyes and a new NO stretch peak appears at around 1250 cm−1. The previous study reported that the pyridine dyes are coordinated to the Lewis acid cites of the TiO2 surface, which can also be proved in this work by the new peak at 1620 cm−1 for WL101-R on the TiO2.12 For the pyridine-N-oxide dyes, after being adsorbed on the TiO2 the pyridine stretch peaks remain unchanged at around 1500–1600 cm−1 which is shown in Fig. 4, while the NO peaks at 1250 cm−1 shifted to the low wavenumber obviously, indicating that the coordination between NO and the TiO2 surface is the main adsorption way for all pyridine-N-oxide dyes. As the alkaline property of pyridine-N-oxide unit, the coordination may possibly occur between the oxygen and the surface bounded hydroxyl groups. This explanation can also be confirmed by the dye loading results. As there are fewer Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface than Brønsted acid sites, the adsorbed amounts of WL101–WL103 are all more than two folds than that of WL101-R.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also was employed to study the interfacial charge transfer processes in DSSCs based on the WL dyes under −0.650 V bias applied voltage in the dark. The intermediate frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plot represents the charge transfer phenomena between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte. This recombination resistance decreases in the order of WL101 > WL103 > WL102. Additionally the electron recombination lifetimes (τ) were calculated from the angular frequency (ωmin) at the intermediate–frequency peak in bode phase plot using τ = 1/ωmin. The calculation results show the same order as the recombination resistance. This result suggests that the electron recombination rate is indeed suppressed by the introduction of the long alkyl chain. Considering the result of WL101, the high resistance is obtained because the adsorption amount guarantees enough coverage of TiO2 surface to suppress the electron recombination. This trend is in accordance with the Voc results of the pyridine-N-oxide dyes, but owing to the different adsorption property of WL101-R, the Voc got in the experiment is not so high although it has the longest electron recombination lifetime (Fig. 5).
Conclusions
A new type of alkaline pyridine-N-oxide was introduced as electron acceptor and anchoring group in this work. A systematic investigation on the relationship between the dye and performance of DSSCs was conducted. FTIR and EIS data show the good adsorption and electron injection efficiency of the pyridine-N-oxide dye-sensitizers. When applied in DSSCs, WL102 got the highest efficiency of 3.72% under AM 1.5G illumination. Although the introduction of long-chains on the bridge did not have much effect on the photovoltaic performance, we are preparing to introduce a second acceptor to form a D–A-π-A structure with pyridine-N-oxide to obtain broader absorption in order to improve the photovoltaic performance. This aspect of work now is ongoing in our lab, which will be summarized later.
