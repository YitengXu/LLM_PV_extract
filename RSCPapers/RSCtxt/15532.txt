    , Accepted 2nd October 2020First published on 20th October 2020AbstractWe conducted an exploratory study on the characteristics and applications of carbonaceous materials prepared using different types of biomass and petroleum coke (PC). The strengthening mechanism was analyzed based on the outcomes of the experimental results we obtained from micro-analytical methods, such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that within the scope of the experiment, when mixed with petroleum coke, moldy orange peel (M-OP) played a prominent strengthening role. The strengthening manifests itself as a 30–70 °C reduction in Tmax. Notably, the reaction rate at Tmax and the activation energy were markedly reduced as the biomass ratio increased from 20% to 50%. The increase in activity may also be related to the fermentation of OP. Microorganisms produce enzymes, causing the enzymatic hydrolysis of the fibrous part of OP to produce a large number of small molecules, increase the specific surface area, and expose more carboxyl, hydroxyl and other active groups. This study may provide new insights into expanding the application of biomass and have important implications for developing different types of biomass as carbon materials in production systems to promote clean, efficient production.
1. Introduction
Data from the “Statistical Review of World Energy” show that with the rapid growth of global energy consumption, the global energy landscape is being transformed from being mainly based on fossil energy to being geared toward green energy.1–3 Renewable energy raw materials for industrial smelting production have increasingly been used to address problems such as limited fossil fuel resources, climate change and the like.4–7 Rising energy prices and public concern about global warming have opened the market for solar cells. Solar photovoltaic power generation has a broad outlook for development owing to its safety, reliability, efficiency, convenience, flexibility and stability.8,9 It is expected to gradually become the main body of energy supply in the 21st century. Photovoltaic power generation is the use of solar cells, solar collectors and concentrated solar power generation technology to directly convert solar energy into electricity.10 Most commercial solar cells are manufactured with semiconductor silicon as the main raw material. With the rapid development of integrated circuits (ICs) in the semiconductor industry, silicon materials have gained a great potential market in modern industries.
China is one of the largest producers of silicon and ferrosilicon products globally. These materials are produced in electric arc furnaces from quartz raw materials and carbon-reducing materials.11 In terms of energy input, the electrical power needed for this process ranges from 11 kW h to 13 kW h per ton of silicon produced, comprising about 45% of the total energy supplied to the process, while the chemical energy of raw materials constitutes the rest.9,12–14 Owing to its excellent physicochemical properties, charcoal has long been regarded as an ideal carbonaceous reducing agent. Coke and wood chips are also used as main reduction materials. The electric power provided is almost entirely renewable;11 regardless, the total CO2 emissions for the silicon and ferrosilicon industry are particularly high. With environmental protection and awareness of ecological construction considered, the country has banned forest resources, thus limiting the source of charcoal. However, a combination of high coke and high coal leads to increased power consumption, lowered efficiency and high costs. Thus, the physical and chemical properties of carbonaceous materials need to be improved to replace charcoal during silicon production, particularly using methods that effectively recover energy.
In a report published by CI Consulting, approximately 170 billion tons of biomass are produced by photosynthesis annually worldwide, which is 10 times the contribution of the main fuel globally. Bio-energy supplies 10% of the energy supply globally and thus is the most significant renewable energy source with 14% of the 18% renewable energy mix.15–17 However, less than 1% of the total amount of biomass is utilized as energy (most of it is buried or easily forms mildew), but it has great latent capacity for development and application. A schematic of the circulation of organic substances in the ecosystem is presented in Fig. 1. The development and utilization of biomass significantly affect the recovery of waste resources, transformation of energy construction, environmental improvement and protection, and so on.
 Fig. 1  A schematic of the circulation of organic substances in the ecosystem. 
Numerous studies on the co-gasification of biomass and other materials have successively been published both locally and internationally. Diao et al.18 studied the CO2 co-gasification characteristics of pyrolytic oil distillation residues and biochar under different reaction temperatures. The results indicated that the increasing proportion of pyrolytic oil distillation residue positively affected the improvement of the gasification reactivity of biomass and the strengthening of the synergistic effect between separate feedstocks, while the rising reaction temperature reduced the enhancement of the co-gasification reactivity. Basha et al.19 investigated the performance of air co-gasification of palm kernel shells and polystyrene under different operating conditions. Zhao et al.20 found that sufficient H2O vapor could enhance synergy in accordance with the rising catalytic effect of alkali and alkaline earth metals, promoting the generation of free radicals and increasing the reactivity of half-chars by co-pyrolysis and steam co-gasification of wheat straw and lignite coal. In their study of petroleum coke and biomass, Wei et al.21 indicated that char gasification reactivity was enhanced with increases in biomass proportion and gasification temperature. Zhang et al.22 assessed the effect of fuel origin on synergy in coal/biomass blends during co-gasification; synergy was shown to occur when ash residuals were formed, and potassium species in biomass ash played a catalytic role in promoting the gasification reactivity of coal char. However, no relevant studies have been reported on the use of these decaying and degraded resources for industrial production, thereby restricting the use of such sources to a certain extent. In our previous work,23 the results indicated that the reactivity enhancement is more pronounced when an organic solvent was used in the reaction media. The rotten biomass itself can also act as an organic solvent. In the current study, the co-gasification characteristics of petroleum coke were determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The petroleum coke was derived from oil refineries and biomass involving widespread degenerative changes in daily life. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy were conducted to investigate the species of active alkali metals and alkali earth metals (AAEMs) and the evolution of the carbon structure to further relate it to co-gasification synergy.18,24 The findings in the present study are expected to guide the correlation of co-gasification synergy with variations in the chemical structure of biomass during the metamorphic process. It is also intended to provide a valuable basis for enhancing the performance of carbon materials as well as optimizing the disposal of biomass waste.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials and analysis
Petroleum coke (PC) was purchased from Taiwan. Waste biomass (represented by orange peel (OP) and moldy orange peel (M-OP)) was collected from a local farmers' market. As listed in Table 1, the proximate and ultimate analyses of each raw material were conducted in accordance with the Chinese standards GB/T 212-2008, GB/T 214-2007, and GB/T 30733-2014. As shown in Table 1, the biomass has a higher AAEM content than PC. The H/C value in PC was 0.06, and that of biomass was 0.13.

2.2. Sample preparation
PC was pre-dried to a constant weight before it was crushed. The crushed PC was then sieved through multiple meshes with holes of varying sizes to obtain particles with sizes smaller than 100 μm. To minimize the temperature gradients during heating of the samples, the material was dried for another 12 h period in a drying oven at 353 K. To retain the active ingredients contained in the biomass, wet grinding was used in this study. The samples consisted of PC and biomass in ratios of 80:20 and 50:50 (moisture-free basis). The preparation of the samples included mixing the materials, grinding the mixture into fine powder, drying to constant weight, and packing. Fig. 2 presents the aforementioned process in a simplified sequence flow diagram.

2.3. Thermomechanical analysis
Heat reaction behaviors were determined using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA-STA449F3, NETZSCH, Germany). Samples weighing 7–8 mg were prepared. Pure argon (>99.99%) with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1 was first passed as the shielding gas to eliminate the inclusion gas in the samples and the residual gas in the instrument, which could prevent carbon from being oxidized during heating. Gas in the atmosphere as a gasification agent then changes to CO2 with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The samples were heated to 1400 °C at a constant heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and then maintained at the target temperature for 60 min. The burning characteristics and mechanism of the samples were analyzed using analytical methods such as FTIR (Nicolet iS 10), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
2.4. Kinetic analysis
The kinetic analysis of the co-gasification of carbon materials is key to determining the reaction mechanism. It is significant for the design and operation of the gasification equipment and further research. Numerous methods, particularly the integration method, have often been used to calculate the reaction kinetics of carbon materials.25–27 In this study, the Coats–Redfern method was used. Kinetic parameters, including the activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A0), were determined following the Arrhenius equation.28–31 The gasification progress of carbon materials follows a first-order reaction, as previously determined.32,33
Based on the data obtained by TGA, the function of the conversion rate (α) of each material can be defined using eqn (1). (1)where m0 represents the initial mass (mg) of the reactants, mt is defined as the instantaneous mass (mg) and mf is the residual mass (mg) when the sample is no longer weightless. An effective and well-established method of data analysis, as defined in eqn (2), assumes the general reaction rate (dx/dt):29 (2)where t (min) is the reaction time, k is the rate constant at temperature T and f(x) is a reasonable reaction mechanism model. An assumption of the activation energy (Ea) in accordance with the Arrhenius equation is expressed in eqn (3). (3)where A0 (min−1) refers to the pre-exponential factor (also known as the Arrhenius constant) of the reaction, Ea (kJ mol−1) represents the activation energy, R (8.314 J K−1 mol−1) is the molar gas constant and T (K) is the absolute temperature. The heating rate β = dT/dt is always a constant value that was set in the temperature programming of the thermal gravimetric analyzer. Eqn (4) could also be obtained to calculate the kinetic parameters by rearranging eqn (2), followed by integration. (4)
The first term on the right side of eqn (4) is basically constant for most values of Ea in many temperature ranges.34 Plotting ln[g(x)/T2] versus 1/T results in a linear regression line with a high correlation coefficient. The activation energy Ea of the reaction can be calculated from the slope (−E/R) of that straight curve. T in eqn (4) is then replaced by the expression mt = (m0 − mf)/2 as the intercept term, and the pre-exponential factor is determined as well.35,36
The function g(x) depends on the control model and the special mechanism of the reaction, size and shape of the reactants. In addition, g(x) is used as the solid-phase reaction mechanism model in a kinetic study. In this study, the kinetic mechanism of the CO2 gasification reaction was studied using the first-order chemical reaction model. The model assumes that the activity is evenly distributed in the solid particles, the particle size remains unchanged, and the particle density changes uniformly during gasification.37 The expressions for the f(x) and g(x) functions of the kinetic models commonly used for solid-state reactions are shown in eqn (5) and (6). f(x) = 1 − x(5) g(x) = −ln(1 − x)(6)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermogravimetric analysis
In this study, we researched far more on the properties of the carbon composites prepared using the aforementioned methods to determine the strengthening mechanism of the smelting process of silicon. The physicochemical properties and reactivity performance of the carbon materials were evaluated using experimental and theoretical methods. The values determined using eqn (4) were compared with the ones obtained in the thermogravimetric experiments, as shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Comparison of the experimental and theoretical values of TG and DTG curves for PC, OP and M-OP with mass ratios of 80:20 and 50:50, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. 3, the theoretical calculation and the experimental data are significantly different. The theoretical DTG curves of the carbon gasification reaction stage show two peaks in the high-temperature region. The first peak becomes larger as the mass ratio of the biomass increases. Owing to the abundant pore structures on the biochar surface, the aliphatic chain and highly aromatic structures increase. The actual reaction curve shows only one peak in the high-temperature region. The inconsistency between the theoretical and experimental results can be potentially attributed to an evident synergistic effect exerted by the co-gasification of PC with OP and M-OP. The reactivity of biomass is considerably higher than that of PC. After biomass pyrolysis, the contents of alkali metals such as K2O, Na2O and Ca2O in ash are relatively high, playing a catalytic role in the pyrolysis and gasification of PC. The value of H/C in biomass is about twice that of PC. In the pyrolysis process of petroleum coke, the amount of hydrogen should be sufficient to allow the PC to evaporate and pyrolyze completely, provided that the hydrogen atoms in the petroleum coke are properly allocated to the carbon atoms. However, since petroleum coke is a high molecular weight carbide with high aromatization, hydrogen always escapes from PC mainly in the form of combined water (derived from hydroxyl groups) and highly stable aliphatic hydrocarbons (such as methane and ethane).38,39 As a result, some of the carbon atoms that need hydrogen badly cannot combine with hydrogen. The H/C ratio of biomass is markedly high, and the internal hydrogen is sufficient to allow the complete volatilization of biomass. The hydrogen atmosphere largely influences the pyrolysis of coal, and it can be used as a good hydrogen donor for the low-hydrogen material coal. During co-gasification of biomass and PC, hydrogen is generated beforehand by biomass pyrolysis, and a certain amount of hydrogen may be transferred to PC, facilitating the pyrolysis of PC.
The correlating thermodynamic parameters of the samples are listed in Table 2, where DTGmax is the maximum reaction rate and Tmax is the temperature of the reaction at the maximum reaction rate.

As shown in Table 2, when PC and OP were mixed in a mass ratio of 50:50, the maximum reaction rate of the sample relative to that with a mass ratio of 80:20 was increased by 18.46%, and Tmax was reduced by 85 °C. Accordingly, when PC was mixed with M-OP, the maximum reaction rate of the sample with a mass ratio of 50:50 was increased by 32.43% relative to that with a mass ratio of 80:20, and Tmax was reduced by 45 °C. The results showed that as the mass ratio of waste biomass increased, the synergistic effect between carbon materials increased. Consequently, the reactivity of mixed carbon materials was strengthened and the reaction rate was increased. In addition, Tmax was compared when the mass ratio of the biomass in the raw material was 20%. It indicated that the Tmax of the carbon material prepared from PC and M-OP was 70 °C lower than that of the mixture of PC and OP. Otherwise, when the mass ratio of the biomass increased to 50%, the Tmax of the carbon material prepared using PC and M-OP was 30 °C lower than that of the mixture of PC and OP. The reactivity of the mixed carbon material was significantly higher when PC was blended with M-OP than with OP.
3.2. Kinetic analysis
This experiment was mainly aimed at the carbon gasification reaction stage in the high-temperature region. According to the thermogravimetric data, the relative relationship between ln[g(x)/T2] and 1/T was calculated based on the Coats–Redfern method using the kinetic model described in Section 2.4 to analyze the kinetic characteristics of the co-gasification reaction of mixed carbon materials. However, the co-gasification of biomass and PC remained undetermined, and no completely determined dynamic model was available. During the fitting, the regression curve did not change linearly within the temperature range, which might be attributable to the co-pyrolysis reaction. In the low-temperature range, biomass pyrolysis was the main factor; in the high-temperature range, the main factor was the progress of PC pyrolysis. In the middle-temperature range, the reaction process is so complex that numerous parallel and secondary reactions occur, rendering the entire reaction process too elaborate to fit to the first-order reaction model. However, in the low-temperature pyrolysis range (300–500 °C) and the high-temperature gasification reaction range (1200–1400 °C), the reaction process can be regarded as a simple first-order reaction in the respective temperature ranges. For carbon materials, the most difficult reaction stage is the coking reaction stage (the high-temperature gasification reaction stage). Thus, in this study, kinetic analysis was conducted only at this stage. The high-temperature gasification stage with ln[g(x)/T2] is considered as the ordinate, and 1/T is considered as the abscissa to fit a linear straight line, as shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding calculated kinetic parameters are listed in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, the reaction activation energy of the gasification of PC and M-OP is lower than that of PC and OP under similar conditions regardless of the mass ratio (80:20 or 50:50). When the ratio of OP is increased from 20% to 50%, the activation energy decreased by 31.42%. With regard to the ratio of M-OP with the same varying tendency, the activation energy decreased by 35.21%.
3.3. FTIR analysis
To distinguish the changes in chemical bonds and components in OP before and after metamorphism, infrared spectroscopy of OP and M-OP was conducted separately (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  IR spectral analysis of OP and M-OP. 
As shown in Fig. 5, the two kinds of OP markedly vary. Specifically, the asymmetric stretching vibration peaks of –CH3 and –CH2 are strengthened in M-OP. The figure also shows that at 1630 cm−1, an apparent vibration peak appears, which is the CO stretching vibration in the binary aromatic ketone (1-ketone group 2-hydroxy aromatic ketone). During the fermentation of OP, microorganisms produced enzymes, prompting the enzymatic hydrolysis of the fibrous part of OP to produce a large number of small molecules, increase the specific surface area, and expose more carboxyl, hydroxyl and other active groups. Meanwhile, the transformation of the insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) into the soluble dietary fiber (SDF) of M-OP exposed more polar groups, which combined not only with the groups in coal or coke but also combined with their own AAEM ions, producing a synergistic catalytic effect.
3.4. Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy can be used to characterize the carbon structure and the degree of graphitization of materials. Data were obtained by Raman spectroscopy and data peak fitting was conducted. The results were plotted as curves, as shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Raman spectroscopy analysis of PC blended with OP and M-OP. 
On the basis of the Raman spectrum peak fitting diagram, the single peak area corresponding to the five fitting peaks and the peak area between different fitting peaks were calculated, and the results are shown in Table 4.

In the Raman spectrum of carbon materials, the larger the ratio of the area occupied by the G peak to the IG/IAll value, the more regular the arrangement of the carbon structure. The fitting data in Table 4 clearly indicate that for the mixture of PC and M-OP, ID3/IG increases, while IG/IAll decreases. That is, the amorphous carbon content is higher in these hybrid carbon materials. To a certain extent, the reactivity performance of this hybrid carbon material prepared using PC and M-OP is higher during the reaction.
3.5. SEM analysis
To further determine the reason why M-OP favored the reactivity of the carbon material, SEM analysis was conducted on M-OP (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Morphology of M-OP characterized by SEM. 
M-OP presented a porous and layered structure, as analyzed. This structure provides a channel for gas circulation during the reaction. The porosity of the mixed carbon material is increased, and the contact area between the reaction gas and the reaction material is largely increased, leading to a rising reaction rate. Meanwhile, this structure can retain the relative uniformity of the internal temperature distribution of the entire carbon material, facilitating the carbon gasification reaction of different carbon materials in the mixture.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, waste biomass with different characteristics was selected to blend with PC by wet grinding, and the physicochemical properties were evaluated. For OP, when the proportion grew from 20% to 50%, the reaction rate rose by 18.46% with an 85 °C reduction in Tmax, and the activation energy decreased from 237.01 kJ mol−1 to 162.53 kJ mol−1, corresponding to a reduction of 31.42%. However, for M-OP, under similar conditions, the reaction rate increased by 32.43% with a reduction of 45 °C in Tmax, and the activation energy decreased from 234.92 kJ mol−1 to 152.21 kJ mol−1, corresponding to a reduction of 35.21%. Specifically, the Tmax values of the carbon material prepared using PC and M-OP were 70 °C and 30 °C lower than those of PC and OP when biomass comprised 20% and 50%, respectively. In addition, the activation energy of the gasification of PC and M-OP was consistently lower than that of PC and OP under similar conditions on the basis of the obtained data. These results generally demonstrate that reactivity enhancement is greater when waste biomass exhibiting organic solvent properties and rich in AAEMs was used as a carbonaceous reducing agent raw material. Thus, this study provides an ideal method for the valuable use of waste resources, saving energy sources and reducing costs.
