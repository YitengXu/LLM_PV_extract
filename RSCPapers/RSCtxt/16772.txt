    , Accepted 19th March 2021First published on 20th March 2021AbstractManipulating the charge carrier transport in photoactive materials is a big challenge toward high efficiency solar water splitting. Herein, we designed a hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS architecture for tuning the interfacial charge transfer kinetics. The in situ growth of ZnxCd1−xS nanoflakes on ZnO backbones provided low interfacial resistance for charge separation. With this special configuration, the optimized Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode achieved significantly enhanced performance with a photocurrent density of 10.67 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE under AM1.5G solar light irradiation, which is about 14.1 and 2.5 times higher than that of the pristine ZnO and CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO photoanodes, respectively. After coating a thin SiO2 layer, the photostability of the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode is greatly enhanced with 92.33% of the initial value retained under 3600 s continuous light illumination. The prominent PEC activity of the hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS nanorod arrays can be ascribed to an enhanced charge transfer rate aroused by the binder-free interfacial heterojunction, and the improved reaction kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which is evidenced by electrochemically active surface area measurements and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy analysis. This interfacial heterojunction strategy provides a promising pathway to prepare high performance photoelectrodes.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, using sunlight to produce hydrogen, has been regarded as a clean, renewable and environmentally-benign strategy for solar fuel production.1,2 Metal oxide semiconductors like TiO2,3–5 ZnO,6–9 and Fe2O310 have been widely investigated as photoelectrodes in PEC hydrogen evolution due to their earth-abundance, excellent photoactivity and chemical stability. The key challenge in photoelectrode materials is to design a proper configuration with excellent light harvesting efficiency, suitable band alignment, high charge separation efficiency and favorable evolution reaction kinetics.11 In this respect, one-dimensional (1D) hierarchically branched core/shell nanorods with an increased surface area and type-II alignment band positions are most attractive candidates for the strong light scattering ability and improvement of charge separation and transfer through the backbone–branch interface junctions.12–14 Therefore, the synthesis of hierarchical branched core/shell nanorods with a favorable heterojunction to direct charge transfer for high efficiency PEC water splitting is attracting more and more attention.
Metal sulfides, as a type of important visible-light-driven materials with suitable band positions and superior electrical transport properties,15 have been used in solar water splitting,16 solar cells17 and photodetectors.18 Among them, the n-type semiconductor CdS with a bandgap of 2.4 eV has been extensively investigated as a model photoanode for solar energy conversion because of its strong visible-light absorption, high electronic mobility, and suitable band positions to drive the redox reactions of water.19 For instance, H2 production with CdS nanorods can reach 90% quantum efficiency when a Pt nanoparticle is placed at the tip of a nanorod.20 The serious corrosion of CdS upon light illumination in aqueous solution strongly restricts its further applications.21 The photocorrosion of CdS has been proved to be oxidized by photogenerated holes and the newly formed oxygen in water.22 An efficient method to solve the inherent defects is to directly fabricate type-II band alignment heterostructures, such as ZnO/CdS,23–25 and TiO2/CdS.26 In particular, highly ordered ZnO/CdS nanorods are well known for effective charge separation and rapid interfacial reaction kinetics.27 As examples, CdS sensitized ZnO nanorods,28 Au@CdS nanoparticle modified ZnO nanowires,29 CdS anchored Al–ZnO nanorods,30 and CdS sensitized 3D branched ZnO nanowires31 have been designed and applied for solar energy conversion. Although much progress has been achieved over the past years, the low active material loading and unsatisfactory specific surface area urgently require development of novel nanostructures for improving the photoconversion efficiency. The hierarchical branched architecture enhances the light-trapping ability and solid/liquid interface area. Also, the binder-free heterojunction accelerates the interface charge transfer. Therefore, it is highly expected to prepare hierarchical ZnO/CdS branched nanorods with a favorable interfacial heterojunction to investigate the catalytic mechanism of PEC water splitting.
Herein, we report an ion-exchange route to prepare hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS nanorod arrays with tunable interfacial heterojunctions, which were vertically aligned on conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates for PEC water splitting. The in situ growth of ZnxCd1−xS nanosheets on ZnO backbones provided a binder-free heterojunction with low interfacial resistance for improving the charge transfer rate. With this interfacial heterojunction configuration, a photocurrent of 10.67 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a conversion efficiency of 7.5% at 0.45 V versus RHE were achieved for the optimized Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanorod arrays, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest value ever reported for a CdS-based photoanode. The coating of a protective SiO2 passivation layer through a facile solution process significantly improved the stability of the Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode. This work might be important for designing unique heterostructured photoelectrodes for applications in solar energy conversion.
Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used directly without further purification. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was bought from Zhuhai Kaivo Electronic Components Co., Ltd (8 Ω cm−2) with a thickness of 1.2 mm and dimensions of 1.5 × 2.0 cm. Deionized water (resistivity over 18 MΩ cm) from a Millipore Q water purification system was used in all experiments.
Synthesis of ZnO nanorod arrays on FTO glass
Prior to the experiments, the FTO glass was cleaned using acetone, ethanol, and deionized water under ultrasonication, and blow-dried with nitrogen before use. Aligned ZnO nanorod arrays were grown using a simple two-step process: electrodeposition of ZnO seed layers, followed by growth of ZnO nanorods using a hydrothermal route. The electrodeposition experiment was carried out in a 50 mL three-chambered electrochemical cell with an anodic current density of 0.75 mA cm−2 and a deposition time of 2 min. The pre-cleaned FTO glass, platinum (Pt) foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 40 mL of aqueous solution containing 5 mM Zn(NO3)2 and 50 mM CH3COONH4 (pH = 9) was used as the electrolyte, and the temperature was kept at 85 °C in a hot water bath. After that, the ZnO seed coated FTO glass was vertically immersed into a 75 mL reaction solution containing 10 mM Zn(NO3)2, 15 mM C6H12N4 (HMT) and 0.25 mM NH3·H2O in a sealed glass bottle and heated to 90 °C for 16 h. Last, the substrate was taken out of the reaction and washed thoroughly with ethanol and deionized water for further use.
Synthesis of hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS core/shell nanorod arrays on FTO glass
The hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS core/shell branched nanorod arrays were prepared by a two-step ion-exchange method. Firstly, the as-prepared ZnO nanorod array substrate was immersed into 15 mM Na2S at 60 °C for 8 h. Then, the obtained ZnO@ZnS composite was rinsed with deionized water followed by dipping in 15 mM CdCl2 aqueous solution at 99 °C for 10 h to obtain the ZnxCd1−xS sample, which was cleaned and dried under a vacuum at 60 °C for further characterization and use. Experiments with 5, 10 and 30 mM Na2S solution for cation exchange were also performed using similar procedures.
Preparation of the CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO nanorod array photoanode
The CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO nanorod array photoanode was prepared through the following steps: CdS nanoparticles were galvanostatically electrodeposited onto the ZnO nanorod surfaces (the exposed geometric area is 1 cm × 1 cm). The electrolyte for electrodeposition was a mixture of 0.2 mol L−1 cadmium nitrate, 0.2 mol L−1 thiourea, 25 mL dimethylsulfoxide, and 25 mL deionized water. The ZnO nanorod acted as the working electrode, and a platinum sheet acted as the counter electrode. The electrodeposition current density was 0.5 mA cm−2, and the electrodeposition temperature was 90 °C. The electrodeposition time was 30 min. The sample was then repeatedly rinsed with deionized water and anhydrous alcohol. Finally, the sample was dried at 80 °C for 2 h in a vacuum.
Characterization
The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized using SEM (Hitachi FE-S4800, 5 kV), TEM (FEI Tecnai T20, 200 kV), HRTEM (FEI Tecnai F30, 300 kV), and XRD (RigakuD/MAX-PC2500, Cu Kα). All the UV-vis absorption and reflectance spectra were measured using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were measured using a FLS980 spectrophotometer. The chemical status of the elements was analyzed using XPS (ESCALab MKII, Al Ka 1486.6 eV).
PEC measurements
All PEC measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI Instruments, CHI 660E) in a three-electrode system using the as-prepared photoanode as the working electrode, a Pt plate as the counter electrode, and a standard Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. A 300 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the radiation source with a light intensity of about 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a silicon reference solar cell. An aqueous solution containing 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 was employed as the electrolyte. Photocurrent response tests of the photoanodes with on and off cycles were carried out at a fixed bias of 1.23 V versus RHE. Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed by using Zahner IM6 (Zahner Elektrik, Kronach, Germany) equipment with light emitting diode (LED) lamps. The IPCE was calculated from amperometry measurements with a three-electrode configuration at 1.23 V vs. RHE with 1 nm steps in the range of 300–600 nm. The intensity-modulated light was provided by an LED lamp that allowed superimposition of sinusoidal modulation (ca. 10%) on a dc illumination level. The wavelength of the light was 430 nm with an average intensity of 1.5 W m−2, and the modulation amplitude of the lamp voltage was 10 mV. EIS was performed under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) in an AC potential frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV.
Results and discussion
A seed-mediated growth combined with ion-exchange route was employed to fabricate the hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS core/shell nanorod arrays, as illustrated in Scheme 1. In the first step, well-defined ZnO nanorod arrays were vertically grown on FTO glass as a backbone template for the growth of secondary nanostructure. In an electrochemical system, a hierarchical structure electrode with large surface area would provide more active sites for the reactions between the electrode and electrolyte. For this purpose, in situ growth of ZnxCd1−xS nanosheets on ZnO backbones is a good choice, because it can give favorable type-II band alignment, low interfacial resistance, large specific surface area and high visible light harvesting, which is beneficial to light harvesting and charge separation and transfer. Thus, ZnxCd1−xS nanosheets were uniformly grown on the ZnO nanorod surface by successive S2− and Cd2+ ion-exchange reactions in the second step, which resulted in hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS core/shell nanorod arrays. The composition of Cd/Zn in the ZnS/CdS bilayer shell can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of S2− ions in the exchange solution. For reference, CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO nanorod arrays were also prepared by an electrodeposition technique.
 Scheme 1  Schematic of the proposed synthesis process of the hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS core/shell nanorod arrays. 
As-prepared ZnO nanorod arrays with diameters of 100–200 nm were vertically grown on FTO substrates on a large scale (ESI,† Fig. S1). After S2− ion-exchange, the ZnO nanorods were uniformly and compactly covered by ZnS nanoflakes that are ca. 10 nm thick (ESI,† Fig. S2). The nanoflakes are perpendicularly interconnected to form an open and highly porous architecture. After being further exchanged with Cd2+ ions, the porous architecture is perfectly maintained (Fig. 1a–c), and the thickness of the nanoflakes is slightly increased to ca. 15 nm. The morphologies of the porous shells can be controlled by immersing the ZnO nanorods into different concentrations of S2− solutions as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The distributions of the nanoflakes covered on the surface of the ZnO nanorods were changed from sparseness to compactness with increasing the molar ratio of S2− ions in the exchange solution. The hierarchical core/shell structure was further demonstrated by TEM and high-resolution TEM images as shown in Fig. 1d and e. Fig. 1d shows a typical TEM image of a hierarchical core/shell configuration. Across the hierarchical nanorod, the brightness profile shows a clear variation with a light-contrast shell of about 10 nm thick. However, the nanorods are crystalline as a whole, as revealed by the SAED pattern, which implies that the nanocrystallites are oriented in order (ESI,† Fig. S4a). The nanoflake shell shows a polycrystalline SAED pattern corresponding to the cubic CdS phase (ESI,† Fig. S4b). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shown in Fig. 1e suggested that the nanorod showed clear lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.26 nm, which can be ascribed to the (001) plane of hexagonal ZnO. The fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.34 nm and 0.30 nm are assigned to the (111) plane of CdS, and (111) plane of ZnS, respectively. It confirms the co-existence of ZnS and CdS phases in the shell. The crystal interface between ZnO and CdS was closely combined, which provided direct proof that the ZnxCd1−xS phases were grown from the ZnO cores rather than randomly deposited on its surface. The binder-free heterojunctions enable the photogenerated electrons to transfer swiftly to the nanorod. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum (ESI,† Fig. S5) shows that the elemental mass contents of Zn, Cd, O and S (Cu comes from the underlying support) of the as-prepared sample are 17.34 wt%, 58.05 wt%, 10.63 wt% and 13.97 wt%, respectively. After alkali treatment, the chemical compositions of the samples were studied using ICP-AES measurements, and the typical hierarchical sample is Zn0.33Cd0.67S as shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). This core/shell heterostructure is also confirmed by EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 1f–i and Fig. S6, ESI†), revealing that Zn is mainly distributed in the core region, while Cd and S are homogeneously distributed through the entire shell. Such a hierarchical core/shell architecture with a binder-free interface is more favorable for the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions and efficient charge separation and transfer for improved PEC activity.

Fig. 2a and Fig. S7 (ESI†) show the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples. For the pure ZnO nanorod arrays, the diffraction peaks marked by asterisks can be indexed to wurtzite phase ZnO (JCPDS file No. 36-1451). The predominant (002) and (004) peaks suggest that the ZnO nanorods grow with their c-axis orientation normal to the FTO surface.8 After epitaxial growth of Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanosheets, some new peaks are observed at 24.57°, 26.31°, 28.06°, 43.72°, and 51.61°, which can be indexed respectively to the (100), (101), (001), (110) and (112) planes of cubic CdS (JCPDS file No. 65-3414). Noticeably, no ZnS peaks were detected in the XRD pattern, possibly due to the low component contents. To confirm the valence states, the ZnxCd1−xS samples were characterized by XPS measurements, as shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S8 (ESI†). The full scan spectrum indicates the presence of Zn 2p, Cd 3d, O 1s, and S 3d peaks in the sample (ESI,† Fig. S8a) with no obvious impurities detected. In comparison with the pristine ZnO nanorods, and CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO nanorods, the Zn 2p core (Fig. 2b) splits into 2p3/2 (1021.88 eV) and 2p1/2 (1044.95 eV) peaks, which were shifted to higher binding energy after the growth of CdS nanosheets, revealing the presence of strong interactions between ZnO and CdS at their interface.32 The oxygen peak at a binding energy of 531.5 eV (ESI,† Fig. S8b) was also higher than that of the pristine ZnO sample and CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO nanorod (530.8 eV). As seen in Fig. S8c (ESI†), the Cd 2p XPS spectrum of the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S core/shell nanorod arrays exhibits an approximately 0.15 eV blue-shift relative to the CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO sample, which can be attributed to the existence of a strong interaction between the Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanosheets and ZnO nanorods.33 The tight growth of Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanosheets on ZnO nanorods favors the formation of intimate interfacial contacts, which is highly favorable for efficient charge separation/transfer. Meanwhile, the two peaks located at 161.50 and 162.69 eV are mainly attributed to S 3d3/2 and S 3d1/2 (ESI,† Fig. S8d), which are ascribed to the hybrid chemical bond species. All these results indicate that charge or energy transfer occurred after the formation of the heterojunction.

Raman spectra are further used to analyze the microstructure of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 2c). The Raman peaks of the first-order longitudinal optical phonon mode show a systematic decrease from 301.02 cm−1 for Zn0.7Cd0.3S to 300.96 cm−1 for Zn0.33Cd0.67S and 300.89 cm−1 for pure CdS with decreasing Zn content due to the destruction of the lattice periodicity to a certain extent. This continuous shift further confirms that the shell is a homogeneous ternary alloy of tunable composition instead of a mixture of ZnS and CdS.34 All Raman peaks of the ZnxCd1−xS samples shift slightly compared with the positions of pure CdS, which might be attributed to the interactions between ZnO and CdS. Fig. 2d shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the as-prepared samples. The pristine ZnO nanorod arrays displayed a sharp absorption edge at around 410 nm, which matched the bandgap of 3.11 eV. After secondary epitaxial growth of ZnxCd1−xS nanosheets, the spectrum shows a great enhancement in the visible region up to 590 nm. While the lattice parameter of ternary alloys (AxB1−xC) changes linearly with the composition, the band gaps often vary nonlinearly. To a first approximation, the variation is quadratic,35 Eg(AxA1−xC) = xEg(AC) + (1 − x)Eg(BC) – bx(1 − x)(1)where b is a bowing parameter, describing the extent of nonlinearity. In our case, the variation of the band gaps of the ZnxCd1−xS shell with the Zn content (x) is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and can be fitted with a quadratic function of Eg = 0.67x2 + 0.04x + 1.62 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) with a bowing parameter of 0.67 eV. According to a theoretical model developed by Zunger and co-workers, the observed band gap bowing may arise from three structural and electronic factors: (i) the volume deformation resulting from the changing lattice constant which alters the band structure; (ii) the electronegativity difference of the atoms in the alloy deforming the electron distribution; and (iii) the internal structural relaxation of the anion cation bond lengths and angles to accommodate the differently sized constituents.36 The results indicate that the ZnO nanorods with hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS branched nanosheets have enhanced light-trapping capacity, and thus are suitable to be used in PEC cells.
The hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanorod arrays were subsequently investigated as photoanodes in PEC water splitting. As shown in Fig. 3a, compared with the pristine ZnO sample, the photocurrent density of the Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode increases significantly in a potential window from −0.3 to 1.3 V vs. RHE. The curve shows a pronounced photocurrent starting at about −0.3 V, which increases to 10.67 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V vs. RHE under illumination. The photocurrent density is about 14.1 times larger than that of the pristine ZnO sample, suggesting the definitely enhanced PEC performance by the in situ growth of the Zn0.33Cd0.67S shell. As seen, the photocurrent density depends on the photon trapping capacity of the catalyst (Fig. S10, ESI†). The performance of Zn0.33Cd0.67S approximates the maximum ca. 12.3mA cm−2 based on the UV-vis absorption spectra of Zn0.33Cd0.67S (590 nm). This might be attributed to separation of bulk charge, because the growth of Zn0.33Cd0.67S on ZnO is an in situ growth process. To further reveal the effect of the binder-free interfacial heterojunction, the electrodeposition of CdS shells on ZnO nanorods was carried out as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†) via an electrodeposition method, which displayed a saturated photocurrent density of 4.09 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V vs. RHE under illumination, nearly half the value of the Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode. It suggested that the physical contact between the two phases has a high interfacial resistance to charge transportation. Noticeably, the achieved photocurrent density is also superior to metal sulfide modified photoelectrodes, such as ZnO/CdS (3.58 mA cm−2),31 Al–ZnO/CdS/TiO2 (12.7 mA cm−2),30 ZnO/CdS/ZnFe2O4 (3.88 mA cm−2),37 ZnO/CdS/Au (11.01 mA cm−2),38 and ZnO/CdS/PbS (14.1 mA cm−2).39 A detailed comparison is given in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Such prominent PEC performance of the Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode could be ascribed to the unique hierarchical core/shell heterostructure, which provides type-II band alignment, low interfacial resistance, large specific surface area and high visible light absorption.

Fig. 3b shows the photoresponses of the three types of nanoarray photoanodes over time at 0.9 V versus RHE with chopped light illumination. It can be seen that the photocurrent stabilized at 10.67 mA cm−2 once the light was switched on, suggesting rapid transfer of the photogenerated electrons from Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanoflakes to ZnO nanorods. In addition, once the light was switched off, the photocurrent decayed rapidly to negligible dark current, indicating fast transport of photogenerated electrons from the ZnO nanorods to the FTO substrate. Generally, the photocurrent spikes in the beginning of switching can be attributed to instantaneous separation of photogenerated electron/hole pairs and subsequent charge recombination at the photoanode surface or during transfer to the photoanode surface, and, once the generation rate and recombination rate attain equilibrium, a steady-state photocurrent density is achieved.40

Fig. 3c displays the photoconversion efficiency of the three types of nanoarray photoanodes, which suggested that the hierarchical exhibited much higher photoconversion efficiency than the CdS nanoparticle modified ZnO photoanode, and the pristine ZnO photoanode. The maximum photoconversion efficiency reached 7.5% for the optimized Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE, a ca. 2.4 times increase relative to that of the CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO photoanode. The photocorrosion of metal sulfides may also contribute to the conversion efficiency. This is a common problem appearing in the literature, and seems inevitable for metal sulfides. Therefore, developing a protective layer method is a promising protocol for sulfides. Furthermore, incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were also measured as shown in Fig. 3d. Obviously, the optimized Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode exhibited considerably higher photoactivity than that of the CdS nanoparticle modified ZnO photoanode, and the pristine ZnO photoanode in the range below 600 nm. The IPCE is as high as 25.5% at 0 V vs. RHE under 480 nm light irradiation, and the value can even arrive to 68.3% at 0.9 V vs. RHE (Fig. S12, ESI†).
With regard to the enhancement of the PEC activity for the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode, the presence of a binder-free interfacial heterojunction could enhance the overall electronic conductivity, which was confirmed by the lowest interfacial charge-transfer resistance in Fig. 4a, hence ensuring fast electron transfer to the ZnxCd1−xS–electrolyte interface. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were also used to evaluate the photoinduced charge separation42 (Fig. S13, ESI†). As seen, the peak intensity of the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S sample is the weakest, indicating that the electron–hole recombination is largely inhibited. The increase in the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) may also be one of the main contributors since a larger ECSA could afford more catalytically active sites.41 According to the measured double-layer capacitance in Fig. 4b and Fig. S14 (ESI†), the ECSA for the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode was estimated to be roughly 3 and 4.5 times higher than that of the CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO photoanode and pristine ZnO photoanode. The above results strongly demonstrate that the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanorod array with a binder-free heterojunction and large ECSA could greatly improve the water oxidation reaction kinetics under light irradiation.

The inset in (a) is the impedance curve of the Zn0.33Cd0.67S sample in the low AC potential frequency region. 
The charge transfer and surface recombination kinetics of the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode were further explored by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) from 0.1 to 10 kHz. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the negative semicircle of the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S electrode is much bigger than that of the CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO photoanode and pristine ZnO photoanode, indicating that a smaller fraction of the holes achieved the semiconductor surface for water oxidation. The semicircle diameter gradually increased with the light power density rising (Fig. S15a and b, ESI†). The rate constant of charge recombination (krec) and transfer (ktran) can be calculated from the plots as displayed in Fig. 5c. Obviously, the ktran value of hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S is higher than the krec value in the light intensity range, suggesting that the binder-free interfacial heterojunction accelerates the charge transport for improving the PEC performance.43 The overall effect of ktran and krec is shown in Fig. S16a and b (ESI†). In order to further understand the effect of the binder-free interfacial heterojunction on charge separation, the charge carrier transit times (τd) were quantified by IMPS measurements. τd refers to the average time for photogenerated charges to reach the back contact, and can be estimated from τd = (2πfmin(IMPS))−1, where fmin is the frequency at the minimal value in the IMPS plot. τd reflects the recombination probability of photogenerated electrons and holes in the photoeletrode, which determines the PEC properties of an electrode. Fig. 5d shows the IMPS plots of the as-prepared photoelectrodes under light illumination (200 W m−2). τd is 0.148 ms (hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S electrode), 0.453 ms (CdS nanoparticle decorated ZnO electrode), and 587.597 ms (pristine ZnO electrode). Apparently, τd of the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S heterostructured electrode is the smallest among the three types of electrodes, demonstrating rapid charge transport to the electrode interface for the lowest interfacial charge-transfer resistance. As a result, the electrons have more chances to be collected by FTO.

The PEC stability is another important factor of a photoanode for practical application, especially for sulfide photoanodes seriously hindered by the photocorrosion reaction.31 For improving the stability of the hierarchical heterostructured electrode, a protective SiO2 layer was deposited onto the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanorods via a mild solution method.44 As shown in Fig. 6a–b, the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanorods were coated with a SiO2 thin layer with a thickness of ca. 3–5 nm. EDS spectra confirmed the presence of the Si element in the measured region as shown in Fig. 6c. The absorption at 1100 cm−1 indicated the Si–O vibration from the sample (FTIR spectra, Fig. S17, ESI†), further revealing the deposition of the SiO2 protective layer. Fig. 6d shows that the photocurrent density of the SiO2-coated photoanode was slightly decreased from 10.67 to 8.2 cm−2 at 0.9 V versus RHE, which could be ascribed to the poor electron mobility of the SiO2 layer. Moreover, the current density of the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode without the SiO2 coating was gradually decreased with a ca. 42.67% decay of the initial value under continuous illumination. In contrast, the current density of the SiO2-coated Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode could be maintained at 92.33% of the initial photocurrent density for 3600 s under continuous illumination. Furthermore, a prolonged stability test was carried out for the photoanode (Fig. S18, ESI†). After 2 h of light illumination, the photocurrent density maintained 76.9% of the initial value, indicating that the SiO2 coating is an effective protocol to stabilize the Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode during PEC water splitting. After usage, the microstructures of the photoanode (Fig. S19, ESI†) kept similar characteristics to the initial, also demonstrating that the solution SiO2 coating protocol is a promising way to obtain a robust surface passivation layer. Furthermore, hydrogen evolution is further used to evaluate the prolonged stability of the SiO2-coated Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode. As illustrated in Fig. 6e, the evolution rates of H2 from the Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode and SiO2-coated heterojunction photoanodes were 150.0 and 216.0 μmol cm−2 h−1 in a hole sacrificial reagent circumstance, respectively. Thus, coating a SiO2 layer prevented the electrolyte from contacting the Zn0.33Cd0.67S surface and prohibited the photocorrosion reaction without considerably sacrificing its photoactivity.

Based on the above-mentioned results and Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. S20, ESI†), a possible PEC hydrogen generation mechanism as well as the charge separation and transfer in the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode is schematically illustrated in Scheme 2. The flat band potentials for the ZnO and ZnO/Zn0.33Cd0.67S samples were −0.18 V and −0.68 V vs. NHE, respectively. It is reported that the bottom of the conduction band (CB) potential is negative by 0.2 V compared to that of the flat band potential of an n-type semiconductor. The CB positions of the ZnO and ZnO/Zn0.33Cd0.67S samples can be calculated as −0.38 V and −0.88 V vs. NHE, respectively. The bandgaps of the ZnO and ZnO/Zn0.33Cd0.67S samples were 3.11 and 2.29 eV according to Fig. 2d. Correspondingly, the valence band (VB) positions were 2.73 V and 1.41 V for the ZnO and ZnO/Zn0.33Cd0.67S samples, respectively. Thus, photoelectrons can be excited from the VB to the CB of Zn0.33Cd0.67S and then rapidly transferred to the CB of ZnO due to the potential difference, which then moved toward the Pt electrode to generate hydrogen. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes migrated to the surfaces of the Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanoflakes where the oxidation reaction occurred. Besides, the hierarchical Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanoflakes offer a large ECSA with abundant catalytically active sites, low interfacial resistance and high visible light harvesting. Thus, the ZnO@Zn0.33Cd0.67S photoanode not only absorbs more visible light, but also improves the efficiency of charge separation across the binder-free interfacial heterojunction and hence also improves the PEC water splitting performance. In addition, if Zn0.33Cd0.67S nanorods were coated with a thin layer of SiO2, the oxidation reaction would occur at the surface of the SiO2 layer.

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS nanorod arrays with a tunable shell composition (0 ≤ x ≤1) and binder-free heterojunction by a combined two-step strategy for high performance PEC water splitting. The hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS nanorod array is able to enhance the light harvesting ability, provide an enlarged ESCA for reaction kinetics, promote efficient charge separation at the ZnxCd1−xS–ZnO interface, and accelerate charge transport owing to the favorable type-II band alignment. The unique heterostructure photoanode exhibited a large photocurrent density and high efficiency for hydrogen generation and long-term stability achieved after surface coating with a thin layer of SiO2, which is superior to sulfide modified ZnO photoanodes. Our results have demonstrated that hierarchical ZnxCd1−xS nanorod arrays might provide important insight to rationally design heterostructured photoelectrodes with optimum architectures and desired heterojunctions toward practical sunlight-driven energy conversion.
