    , Accepted 15th February 2018First published on 21st February 2018AbstractChemical vapor deposited CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin films showed a long-term stability of approximately one month after exposure to air at room temperature. Self-powered sensors using 500 nm-thick MAPbI3 films were demonstrated for pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensor applications. The generated output voltage was attributed to an intrinsic piezoelectric property of the MAPbI3 films and their sensitivities for sensors were approximately 8.34 mV kPa−1 and 0.02 nA kPa−1. The output current generated in the release mode showed a strong dependence on the light power irrespective of the applied pressure, revealing the light-sensitive effect of the MAPbI3 films. The response time of bimodal sensors for applied pressure and light power was approximately 0.066 and 0.320 s at an applied pressure of 30 kPa, respectively. The CVD-MAPbI3 films have attracted attention for simultaneous realization of both pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensor applications.
Introduction
Self-powered nanotechnology based on piezoelectric thin films has been focused on building a self-powered system that operates independently, wirelessly, and sustainably. Therefore, self-powered nanosystems have been attracting a lot of attention due to their various advantages.1–5 In various methods to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, energy harvesting using piezoelectric materials provides higher energy density and higher flexibility for being integrated into a system, and thus has been studied the most widely.6,7 Piezoelectric nanogenerators due to their small size can be effectively integrated with nano/microscale functional devices to form self-powered nanosystems. Recently, piezoelectric materials, such as ZnO,8,9 InN,10 ZnS,11 PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT),12–14 BaTiO3 (BT),15 polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF),16–18 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)–PVDF nanocomposites,19 have been used for fabricating piezoelectric nanogenerators.
Perovskite solar cells have demonstrated impressive efficiencies between 15 and 20% with 1 cm2 sized solar cells using CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite dye.20,21 Their efficiencies have been still enhanced through the control of the interfacial issues above 20%. In addition, because MAPbI3 possessed a perovskite structure, it was expected to show piezoelectric properties, being utilized for applications in piezoelectric energy harvesting. Kim et al.22 reported the piezoelectric properties of MAPbI3 and piezoelectric generators using MAPbI3 films synthesized via the solution technique. However, the electrical properties of the MAPbI3 films synthesized via the solution technique were known to be easily degraded by exposure to air at room temperature.23–25 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) instead of the solution process was used for high steady state power and thermal stability of solar cells.26
A functional sensing device is indispensable for next-generation biomedical, automotive, aerospace, and industrial control technologies. The present technology of pressure sensors by touch requires large-scale with spatial resolution, fast response, and high sensitivity.27 Recently, the pressure sensing technology has been widely used in the daily life of humans. For flexible pressure sensors, P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE)-MWCNTs have been widely investigated since they can be deposited at room temperature, maintaining the characteristics of flexibility, low cost, and lightness.28,29 The ZnO nanowire/p-polymer array was studied for piezo-phototronic pressure sensor applications,30 and high-resolution dynamic pressure sensors based on the piezo-phototronic effect were investigated using nanopillars that consist of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells.31 However, to the best of our knowledge, simultaneous realization of pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensors using piezoelectric MAPbI3 films had not been reported.
In this study, piezoelectric MAPbI3 films were synthesized and characterized via CVD for long-term stability rather than those via the solution process. Based on the self-powered sensors using CVD-MAPbI3 films, the output voltage and current were demonstrated as a function of applied pressure and light powers for simultaneous realization of pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensors with one sensor structure.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the CVD equipment with two heating-zones for the deposition of the MAPbI3 films. Heating zone “1” was established to control the vaporization of the PbI2 source and the evaporation temperature of the MAI source was monitored by the places layered in heating zone “1”. The vapors of PbI2 and MAI were separately flowed to the substrate because the concentrations of PbI2 and MAI were differently controlled via an argon carrier gas. The substrates were placed in heating zone “2” and their temperatures were independently controlled. The morphologies and long-term stability of the MAPbI3 thin films were compared with those of spin-coated and chemical vapor deposited 500 nm-thick samples. Fig. 1b and c show SEM surface images of the MAPbI3 thin films deposited via spin-coating and CVD, respectively. Spin-coated samples showed rough morphologies with crystalline particles (Fig. 1b). In contrast, CVD-coated samples showed uniform and dense morphologies with large grains of 500–800 nm size (Fig. 1c). Although the MAPbI3 materials have drawn intense interest due to their excellent photovoltaic energy conversion capability, their high sensitivity to moisture poses severe challenges in terms of their practical applications.32 XRD patterns of the MAPbI3 thin films are recorded for the evaluation of the stability upon exposure to air at room temperature. Fig. 1d shows the XRD patterns of the spin-coated MAPbI3 films maintained for several days. They showed that the PbI2 phase dissociated from the MAPbI3 films remained for three days, as shown in Fig. 1d. In contrast, the CVD-MAPbI3 films showed a long-term stability of up to thirty days and showed an existence of the PbI2 phase from the samples maintained for forty days (Fig. 1e). Most of the solution-processed perovskite films that were fabricated using various solvents such as DMF or DMSO solutions possessed both O and N within the films and both elements have a hydrogen bond to form H2O molecules, which promotes the attachment of H2O molecules to the MAPbI3 films.33 Infiltration of the H2O molecules through the spin-coated porous MAPbI3 films promotes the decomposition of the MAPbI3 films. As a result, the spin-coated MAPbI3 films were degraded very quickly (Fig. 1d). In contrast, CVD was performed under a vacuum environment for the synthesis of MAPbI3 films and allowed the formation of a dense structure with full surface coverage, preventing the penetration of moisture. In addition, the CVD-MAPbI3 films are free of residual solvents and other contaminants. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1e, the CVD-MAPbI3 films showed a long-term stability up to one month in ambient air.

The schematic structure of pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensors using CVD-MAPbI3 films and Al (3 at%)-doped ZnO (AZO, 45 nm)/Au (10 nm)/AZO (45 nm) bottom- and top-electrodes is shown in Fig. 2a. Although a glass substrate was used in this study, the reason why AZO multilayers were used as top- and bottom electrodes was attributed to the flexibility of the future devices (see references in the Methods section). For sensor devices using MAPbI3 films, the MAPbI3 thin films were sandwiched via AZO multilayer top- and bottom-electrodes, as shown in Fig. 2a. MAPbI3 materials have low activation energies of EA = 0.58 eV and 0.84 eV, respectively, for I− and MA+ migration and they become leaky upon applying pressure.34 Recently, many studies on resistive and photovoltaic switching properties through iodine migration of perovskite MAPbI3 have been reported extensively.35–37 In order to prevent the migration of I− and MA+ toward the top-electrode of I− and MA+ within the MAPbI3 films for the generation of output voltage and current, a 50 nm-thick SiO2 layer was stacked onto the MAPbI3 films. In order to certify the generation of output voltage under forward and reverse pressures via CVD-MAPbI3 sensors, the electric circuit was designed to drive the output voltage as shown in Fig. 2b. Here, an SR560 V-amplifier (Fig. 2b) was used to filter noise during the measurement of the output voltage. As shown in Fig. 2d, output voltages of 125.6 ± 2.4 mV and −30.2 ± 8.2 mV under an applied pressure of 30 kPa (an active area of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2) at a cycle of 0.4 Hz were observed in the press and release modes, respectively. However, certification that the output voltage of the MAPbI3 sensors was governed by the triboelectric properties is indispensably required. For this purpose, the device structure was electrically connected to remove the triboelectric effect during pressing the device (Fig. S1, ESI†). In order to prevent the leakage of the accumulated charge during pressing the device, an AD8642 V-amplifier with higher internal resistance than that of MAPbI3 films was connected to measure the output voltage, as shown in Fig. 2c. Fig. 2e shows the output voltage observed in the MAPbI3 sensors under an applied pressure of 30 kPa and shows a rectangle-shaped pattern since the reversed output voltage was filtered. The time delay of the output voltage in the press and release modes under an applied pressure of 70 kPa shown in Fig. 2e was revealed in an enlarged time interval shown on the right of Fig. 2e. The time delays of 0.072 and 0.087 s in the press and release modes were attributed to the domain switching upon applying pressure, demonstrating the intrinsic piezoelectric properties of MAPbI3 for pressure sensors.

(d) Output voltage generated via piezoelectric sensors using the electric circuit of (b). (e) Output voltage measured using the electric circuit of (c). Right figures of (e) show output voltage observed in a narrow time region during pressing (red dotted line) and releasing (blue dotted line) from the output square patterns of (e). 

Fig. 3a shows the output voltage of the sensors applied under various pressures from 10 to 70 kPa. Actually, for pressure-sensor applications using piezoelectric MAPbI3 films, the pressures between approximately 15 kPa (1.5 N @ 1 × 1 cm2) and 3000 kPa (3 N @ 1 × 1 mm2) for finger (Supplementary Movie 1, ESI†) and pen (Supplementary Movie 2, ESI†) touch, respectively, were applied on the sensor device.38 In the plot of the relationship between the output voltage and applied pressure (Fig. 3b), output voltages increased with increasing pressure and then saturated at approximately 0.4 V above 40 kPa. This result suggested that the MAPbI3 device can be utilized for sensor applications via finger touch. The sensitivity of the pressure sensor was calculated from the linear plot of the relationship between output voltage and pressure (Fig. 3b), revealing approximately 8.43 mV kPa−1 in the dynamic range, which is higher than that (0.35 mV kPa−1) observed for 500 μm-thick PZT piezoelectric sensors.39 The output current of the sensors was measured with an electric circuit (Fig. 3c) as a function of pressure. Measurements of the output current were performed with a connection of a current amplifier (SR 570 A-amplifier) with a low internal resistance of approximately 1–10 MΩ. Based on the electric circuit, the output current was observed in both press and release modes under different pressures (Fig. 3d). In accordance with the results of output voltage, the output current was linearly increased upon increasing the pressure up to 40 kPa and was saturated at 0.8 nA above 40 kPa (Fig. 3e). The sensitivity of the output current was approximately 0.02 nA kPa−1 in the dynamic range of the pressure sensors.

(d and e) Output current patterns generated by different applied pressures and a relationship between the output current and applied pressure, respectively. 
For the investigation of the pressure and light sensitive bimodal characteristics of the piezoelectric MAPbI3 films, light with different powers was exposed to the pressure sensor in the press and release modes, as shown in Fig. 4a. Because the light was exposed to the samples at the side of the sensor measurement system, the samples were not exposed to light during pressing, and after releasing the pressure, the light influenced the output current because the block for applying the pressure was removed from the sensor device (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b shows the output current of the sensors exposed to various light powers under a pressure of 30 kPa for revealing light sensitive effects of the pressure sensors. As shown in Fig. 4b, the output current by a piezoelectric effect only was observed in the press mode, and in contrast, in the release mode, the output current was strongly dependent on the power of the light and was increased upon increasing the light power. In order to investigate the output current via pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensors, the output currents in the release and press modes are shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4c, in the release mode (left dotted box in Fig. 4b), the output current was strongly influenced only by the light power irrespective of the applied pressure. In contrast, the output current (right dotted box in Fig. 4b) observed as a function of light power for different applied pressures did not change remarkably, as revealed only by the pressure effect (Fig. 4d). In the release mode, strong dependence of output current on the light power demonstrated the light sensitive behavior of the MAPbI3 films. As a result, CVD-MAPbI3 films revealed simultaneous characteristics of self-powered pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensors for one device.

(c) Relationship between the output current and light powers in the release mode (left dotted line of (b)) irrespective of an applied pressure. (d) Relationship between the output current and light powers in the press mode (right dotted line of (b)) under different applied pressures. 
The response time of the sensors was investigated for the output currents for different light powers (for light sensitive sensors) and applied pressures (for pressure sensors). The response times of the output current observed during exposure and un-exposure (dotted lines (1) and (2), respectively, in the inset of Fig. 5a) of the release mode as a function of light power at 30 kPa were approximately 0.32 ± 0.039 and 0.38 ± 0.018 s, respectively. In contrast, the response times of the output current observed upward (press mode) and downward (release mode) (dotted lines of (1) and (2), respectively, in inset of Fig. 5b) as a function of applied pressure were about 0.066 and 0.072 s at 30 kPa, resulting in a shorter response time than the light sensitive effect. Therefore, the response time of the sensors observed by the pressure and light sensitive effects is appropriate to apply for the simultaneous realization of self-powered pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensors. Recently, a flexible bimodal sensor array for simultaneous sensing of pressure and temperature has been reported for electronic skin applications.40–42 In addition, our flexible self-powered pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensors can be applied for electronic skin and wearable devices.

Conclusions
CVD-MAPbI3 thin films were investigated for their long-term stability after exposure to air at room temperature and they were demonstrated as CVD-MAPbI3 sensor devices for pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensor applications. CVD-MAPbI3 showed a long-term stability of approximately 30 days compared with a short-term stability of spin-coated MAPbI3 films. The output voltage observed via sensors fabricated using CVD-500 nm-thick MAPbI3 films was attributed to an intrinsic piezoelectric property of the MAPbI3 films and their sensitivities for the pressure sensor were approximately 8.43 mV kPa−1 and 0.02 nA kPa−1. The output current generated in the release mode showed a strong dependence on the light power irrespective of the applied pressure, demonstrating the light sensitive effect of the MAPbI3 films. The response time of the sensors observed by the pressure and light sensitive effects is appropriate for the simultaneous realization of self-powered pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensors.
Methods
Preparation of pressure and light sensitive bimodal sensors
For flexible bimodal sensors, AZO multilayers as top- and bottom electrodes43,44 were used on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Facing-target sputtering (FTS)45,46 was used to prevent the plasma damage of the PET substrates and MAPbI3 films during the deposition of the AZO multilayer. 50 nm-thick SiO2 thin films were deposited between MAPbI3 and the top-AZO multilayer electrode via FTS for bimodal sensors. For the measurement of the true piezoelectric properties, 150 nm-thick insulated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin films were deposited for device protection and no triboelectric effect was observed after wiring at both electrodes. Both FTS and conventional rf-sputtering were used for deposition of the 150 nm-thick PTFE films because the deposition rate of FTS was slower than that of conventional rf-sputtering. The deposition conditions of the AZO multilayer, SiO2, and the PTFE protection layer are summarized in Table 1. The 500 nm-thick MAPbI3 films were synthesized via CVD (Fig. 1a) and the conditions are summarized in Table 2.

Characterization and electrical properties of MAPbI3 films
The morphology and crystallinity of the spin-coated and chemical vapor deposited MAPbI3 films were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The long-term stability of the spin-coated and chemical vapor deposited MAPbI3 films was evaluated by dissociation into PbI2 and MAI of the MAPbI3 films via XRD using samples exposed to ambient air at room temperature.
Measurement of output voltage and current for pressure sensors
The fabricated devices were poled in order to align the ferroelectric domains of the active layer (MAPbI3: 0.4 × 0.4 cm2) while applying for 30 min at 60 kV cm−1 at room temperature. For measurement of the output voltage and current, pressures of 5 to 70 kPa were applied on the devices at a constant velocity of 2 mm s−1 using a linear motor (Supplementary Movie 3, ESI†). The output performances of the sensors were characterized using a low-noise current amplifier (SR 570, Standford Research Systems) and an oscilloscope (DPO5054, Tektronix) with a load resistance of 10 MΩ (resolution (1 mV) of the oscilloscope). During measurements, various pressures from 5 to 70 kPa were applied using a custom-built press machine at a cycle of 0.4 Hz (Supplementary Movie 4, ESI†).
Measurement of light sensitive output current
For light sensitive properties of the sensors using MAPbI3 films, as shown in Fig. 4a, the light from 0 to 3000 lx was exposed to sensors during pressing and releasing. The light power was monitored using a digital light meter (T-10MA).
