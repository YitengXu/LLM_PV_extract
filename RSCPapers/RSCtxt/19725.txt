    , Accepted 17th May 2017First published on 19th May 2017AbstractThe gas permeability of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films is influenced by controlling the lateral size and void generation. Low gas permeability was achieved by the controlled synthesis of parent graphene oxide (GO). The organic device lifetime using rGO-coated barriers was prolonged by 65.9 times when compared to bare samples.
Encapsulation is a key step in the fabrication of organic-based devices due to their high reactivity with oxygen and water vapor.1 In particular, the development of flexible gas barrier materials is required for next-generation wearable organic electronics. The gas blocking materials should not only have low permeability, but also make it easier for low-cost and large-area fabrication for practical applications. Polymers like polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) or polyimide have been discussed for flexible encapsulants due to their good mechanical properties, thermal stability and chemical resistivity.2 However, the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of these polymers is generally greater than 2 g m−2 day−1, which is inappropriate as a gas barrier. To overcome this problem, depositing additional gas blocking materials on polymeric substrates is essential.
Defect-free graphene is impermeable to all atom types due to a honeycomb-like sp2 carbon-based structure.3 Due to its flexible behavior, cost-effective production, and high throughput, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is an attractive material for gas barrier application in organic electronics. In order to reduce molecular permeability through the stacked rGO structure, suppressing permeation sites in membranes is a key issue. Such penetration pathways are classified under two types: pinholes formed by stacked rGO structures and continuous passages through voids within rGO sheets (Fig. 1). Therefore, reducing the gas permeability of the rGO membranes begins from designing compact rGO sheet packing. This relates to the nature of rGO – its lateral size, the number of functional groups, voids, and other standards. To achieve the goal, researchers have focused on fabricating rGO-coated gas barriers, particularly on the impact of the reduction method on generation of large-size voids and increase in porosity.4–6 The nature of GO controlled by synthetic conditions has been emphasized for diverse graphene-based applications.7–10 Nevertheless, none of the literature on rGO-based gas barriers has focused on synthetic parameters and their influence on the rGO film permeability. Recently, our group revealed that oxidation during GO synthesis influences the lateral size and number of functional groups and voids,11 which are critical for gas molecule penetration through the rGO network. Therefore, adjusting the GO nature eventually affects the gas blocking ability of the rGO membranes.
 Fig. 1  Scheme on the gas molecule permeation through an rGO-layered membrane. The voids within the rGO sheets are exaggerated for clarity. 
In this paper, we emphasize the importance of the rGO nature in preparing efficient gas barriers. The oxidation step of GO was carefully controlled to confirm the influence of the intrinsic rGO characteristics on the gas permeability of the output membranes with the best gas blocking performance. The relationship between the characteristics of rGO and water vapor permeability is discussed. The resulting gas barriers were utilized as encapsulating materials in conventional polymer solar cells (PSCs).
The resulting GO characteristics depend on the oxidative conditions. The oxidation of graphite to GO is divided into two steps: the first is related to the Mn2O7/MnO3+ reaction, while the second (denoted step II oxidation) is initiated by the addition of water into the reaction bath that is performed with MnO4−, generated by the Mn2O7/MnO3+ conversion.11 In step II oxidation, MnO4− generates oxidative cleavage, which can further induce cracks and voids within the GO structure at high temperatures over 70 °C. To obtain optimal rGO as a gas barrier material, step II oxidation should be carefully controlled. Consequently, we synthesized seven GO types at different degrees of oxidation and reduced these materials by thermal treatment. The step II oxidation was performed at 45 °C for 2, 4, and 8 h (denoted GO_452, GO_454, and GO_458), 70 °C for 8 h (GO_708) and 95 °C for 0.5 and 2 h (GO_950.5 and GO_952). Thermally reduced GOs are denoted rGO_000, rGO_452, rGO_454, rGO_458, rGO_708, rGO_950.5, and rGO_952, respectively.
The gas blocking ability of the rGO network is strongly related to the parent GO characteristics. A permeation model looking through the rGO-layered structure is shown in Fig. 1. In contrast to GO laminates, the compact stacking of rGO restricts the water molecule permeation through the nanocapillaries in rGO membranes.12 The interlayer distance between rGO layers was calculated from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) profile (Fig. 2a) using Bragg's law where a peak related to the graphitic structure formation at 23–24° was clearly observed. The C1s spectra measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were deconvoluted to confirm the chemical nature of rGOs. The detailed deconvoluted spectra for each sample are shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† The amounts of different carbon atoms for each rGO are summarized in Table 1. We confirmed that the d-spacings between graphene sheets were almost identical (0.37–0.38 nm), which is consistent with the similar concentration of hydroxyl groups attached on the basal plane of the rGO structure (Fig. 2b). Therefore, gas molecule permeation occurs through the pathways where the rGO sheets are uncovered. As larger rGO sheets are used to fabricate gas barriers, the permeation site density decreases. Furthermore, rGO with large-size cracks and voids allows larger permeation through membranes. If GO suffers harsh oxidative conditions, voids are generated within the GO. These voids allow additional gas permeation (green dotted line in Fig. 1), which is a drawback for gas blocking materials. Therefore, the preparation of pinhole-free GO layers with large lateral sizes is essential for achieving low permeability.

We characterized the lateral size of rGO. Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of rGO on a Si substrate and Table 1 shows the average lateral size of rGO. Detailed distribution of rGO sheet sizes is plotted in Fig. S2, ESI.† In addition, the size of GO was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis (Fig. S3, ESI†). Since DLS analysis assumes a spherical shape, there may be slight discrepancy. However, the size tendency of the GO depending on the synthetic conditions is the same as the microscopy image analysis (refer Table S1, ESI†). As expected, rGO without step II oxidation had the largest lateral size, while the reaction temperature increase resulted in a gradual lateral size decrease. Note that rGO was prepared under harsh conditions (95 °C) and had smaller lateral sizes despite the shorter reaction time than under mild conditions (reaction at 45 and 70 °C). This drastic variation indicated that controlling the temperature during step II oxidation played a critical role in suppressing the gas permeability. Furthermore, while GO_000 had a pinhole-free structure, GO_952 had voids of several hundred nanometers within the layer (Fig. S4, ESI†). These large voids may cause additional moisture permeation. The ID/IGs of the rGO samples were monitored by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S5, ESI†) to confirm the degree of defects at the atomic scale in the graphene structure. The rGO derived from parent GO synthesized under harsh oxidation conditions showed small ID/IG, which is attributed to the preservation of the remaining functional groups. However, point defects did not affect the water vapor permeability.

To evaluate the gas barrier performance of the rGO-based membrane, we measured the WVTRs of several rGO/PEN samples. The films for characterization were prepared by spin casting GO suspensions onto PEN substrates followed by thermal annealing. Controlled thermal treatment resulted in rGO membranes with reduced porosity.5,13,14 The resulting films were 20–30 nanometers thick, flexible and semitransparent. The water vapor permeability through rGO (PrGO) was calculated from the following equation: (1)where T is the WVTR and d is the component thickness.15 Since T and d were monitored using the WVTR test and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, PrGO was eventually obtained. The calculated PrGOs are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the PrGO of rGO_000 was the smallest, while rGO_952 allowed 6.3 times larger water vapor compared to rGO_000.
The gas molecule permeation through rGO membranes is a summation of that through nanosize pores within the rGO-stacked structure. Thus, the pinhole density in the rGO films contributes to the gas permeability of rGO, which is similar to AlOx thin film experiments reported in the literature.16 Since the membranes consist of stacked 2D materials, the permeable pore distribution is related to the lateral size of rGOs. To check the lateral size influence, the relationship between rGO membrane permeability and rGO layer lateral size was investigated, as shown in Fig. 4. The rGO barrier permeability gradually increased by utilizing small rGOs from rGO_000 to rGO_708. Meanwhile, a rapid growth in permeability for rGO_952 was observed when compared to the other rGO films. The permeation pathways through void-induced capillaries played a critical role in the gas penetration compared to the sites formed with edge-to-edge rGO pinholes.
 Fig. 4  Water vapor permeability of rGO films and average surface coverage of rGO sheets as a function of lateral size induced by controlling the oxidative conditions. The black dotted line is inserted for trending. 
Next, we calculated the 2D coverage of rGO sheets for a unit layer (shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S6, ESI†) due to the relationship between the optical transmittance and thickness of the rGO membrane. The surface coverage of the rGO sheets indicates the compact packing degree of the rGO-stacked structure and the detailed derivation is provided in the ESI.†Fig. 4 indicates the trend in the surface coverage by controlling the nature of rGOs. As shown by the comparison between rGO_452 and rGO_454, the water vapor permeability of rGOs with similar sizes but different chemical properties did not show any remarkable difference. Thus, we concluded that the impact of rGO size on gas molecule permeation is much more important than that of the functional groups at the edge. The decrease in the degree of surface coverage was attributed to inadequately covering the building blocks and generating large voids within rGO sheets. Furthermore, GOs that were synthesized between 70 and 95 °C had some cracks in their chemical structure. However, rGO_952 allowed larger amounts of water vapor to penetrate through membranes than the other rGO samples. If the amount of voids within rGO sheets is insufficient, the penetration of gas molecules with sizes in the several nanometers range through voids in the graphene sheets is difficult due to the impermeable nature of adjacent graphene sheets.17,18 Therefore, the permeation of gas molecules through the rGO membrane depends on the high density of voids in the several hundreds of nanometers range. This result emphasizes the importance of controlling the oxidation when preparing chemically derived graphene as a gas barrier material.
To evaluate the practical gas blocking performance, the rGO-based gas-blocking layer was adopted to encapsulate PSCs. The fabricated PSC architecture for lifetime analysis was glass/ITO/ZnO/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/MoO3/Ag/gas barrier. The degradation rate of the devices under the saturated water vapor conditions was remarkably faster than that under ambient conditions (Fig. S7, ESI†). Thus, the devices stored at a relative humidity of 100% confirm the rapid water vapor blocking ability. The time-dependent J–V curves of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 5a–d. The decay trend in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices is plotted in Fig. 5e. The detailed decay of relative photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) as a function of time, is plotted in Fig. S8, ESI.† The J–V characteristics show rGO_000/PEN-laminated solar cells as the most stable and efficient under humid conditions, when compared to unencapsulated devices and their dramatic drop. To determine lifetime markers, the time when the efficiency reached 80% of the initial PCE (denoted T80) was obtained, as shown in Fig. 5f.19 The T80 values for devices encapsulated with rGO_000/PEN were 65.9 times greater than bare PSCs and 6.8 times greater than PEN-laminated PSCs. The efficiency decay for P3HT:PC61BM-based devices originates from the photoactive material oxidation, interfacial layer degradation, and morphological changes.19–21 The penetration of gas molecules, including water vapor and oxygen, was suppressed by inserting rGO thin layers, which was proved by conserving the JSC and FF. Since the permeability of rGO_000 is thousands of times smaller than that of PEN (0.314 g mm m−2 day−1), a simple rGO layer coating that is tens of nanometers thick showed a remarkable effect on the PSCs’ lifetimes. Under the same humidity conditions, the PCE of the PSCs using the rGO/PEN barrier decreased by 37% after 504 h (Fig. S9, ESI†). This suggested that the rGO/PEN film has an effect on the long-term stability of the organic devices, given that the lifetime test was performed at a relative humidity of 100%. A group using rGO_952/PEN showed inferior stability to the barrier using rGO_000, which is represented by T80 reduction. This result was consistent with the trend in the water vapor permeability of rGO membranes.

In summary, the effects of the characteristics of rGO on the gas permeability and its practical applications were presented in this paper. From the gas penetration model, the ideal rGO structure as a gas barrier material was suggested. A corresponding resultant was prepared by controlling the synthetic conditions of GO. The best rGO showed remarkable water vapor permeability and device stability in air. The large-size void generation within the GO structure led to a dramatic increase in the water vapor permeability of the resultant rGO membranes. Although the rGO coating in this work exhibited improvements in the PSCs’ lifetimes, the long-term stability of the devices is required for commercialization. Additional improvement in the gas blocking ability by adopting cross-linking and hybridization by space filling is expected for further utilization. This study reveals that controlling the oxidation step is critical for rGO-based applications.
