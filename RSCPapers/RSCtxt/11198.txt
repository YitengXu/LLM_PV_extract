, Accepted 4th July 2013First published on 11th July 2013AbstractWe demonstrate a facile one-pot approach for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)–cuprous sulfide quantum dot (Cu2S QD) hybrids, wherein the reduction of GO and the growth of Cu2S QDs on graphene occur simultaneously. The as-synthesized rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids exhibit an excellent photoelectric response and efficient electron transfer from the Cu2S QDs to the rGO sheets.
Graphene, a single-atom-thick sheet of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, is considered to be a promising nanoscale building block for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices due to its unique electronic and optical properties.1,2 In particular, graphene has the fastest known electron mobility of ∼1.5 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1,3 and has been demonstrated to be an excellent electron acceptor in graphene–semiconductor nanoparticle (NP) or quantum dot (QD) hybrids.4,5 In the past few years, graphene–QD hybrids have drawn considerable attention owing to their potential application in photovoltaics, light emitting diodes and photo sensors.6–8 For instance, Cao et al.4 directly synthesized reduced graphene oxide (rGO)–CdS hybrids using a solvothermal reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and demonstrated an ultrafast electron transfer process from the excited CdS QDs to graphene. Lin et al.8 reported that rGO–CdSe hybrids possess a dramatically enhanced photoresponse with a very fast response time compared to pure CdSe NPs, bare rGO, and physically mixed rGO–CdSe NPs. Sun et al.9 fabricated ultrasensitive NIR photodetectors based on CVD-grown graphene and PbS QDs using facile solution processing, with the responsivities of the devices reaching values as high as 107 A W−1 under low light irradiation.
As a well-known p-type semiconductor with a bulk band gap of 1.2 eV, cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) is considered to be an ideal sunlight-absorbing material for solar cells10,11 and has been extensively investigated since the discovery of CdS/Cu2S heterojunction solar cells in 1954.12 With the advent of various Cu2S nanostructures, this solar energy conversion material has attracted renewed interest due to quantum-size effects. For instance, Lee et al.13 reported the in situ synthesis of MWNT–Cu2S hybrids through the direct growth of Cu2S nanocrystals on MWNTs, and the solar cell based on these MWNT–Cu2S hybrids exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 0.08% under AM 1.5 illumination. Unfortunately, the optoelectronic properties suffered due to the low carrier-mobility and structural defects of the MWNTs. Radich et al.14 reported a sandwiched CdSe quantum dot sensitized solar cell constructed using an optimized rGO–Cu2S composite counter electrode, which exhibited an unsurpassed power conversion efficiency of 4.4%. However, the controlled synthesis and optoelectronic properties of rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids have not been investigated yet. Herein, we present a facile one-pot approach for the density-controlled assembly of rGO sheets with Cu2S QDs, wherein the reduction of GO and the in situ growth of Cu2S QDs on the graphene sheets occur simultaneously. Most importantly, the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids exhibit an ultrafast photo-induced carrier transfer between the Cu2S QDs and the rGO.
GO sheets for the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids in this work were prepared by the oxidation and exfoliation of natural graphite using Hummers’ method.15 Before the hybrid synthesis, 10 mg freeze-dried GO was added to 20 ml ethanol and the mixture was sonicated for 2 h until the GO was homogeneously dispersed in the solution. Scheme 1 illustrates the approach used to synthesise the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids. In a typical experiment, 1 mmol copper acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2), 15 ml oleylamine (OLA), and 20 ml GO–ethanol solution were added into a three-necked flask (100 ml) at room temperature, followed by sonication for 30 min. After this, the mixture was heated to 120 °C and kept at this temperature for 30 min, while alternating between a vacuum (obtained using a vacuum pump) and a N2 atmosphere (by bubbling N2 through the mixture). Next, the GO–Cu(acac)2–OLA solution was heated to 200 °C and 5 ml of a sulfur–OLA solution (obtained by stirring 0.5 mmol sulfur powder and 5 ml OLA at 60 °C under a N2 atmosphere) was injected and the mixture was kept at the same temperature under a N2 atmosphere, with vigorous stirring, for 1 h. Finally, after cooling, the as-synthesized rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids were purified by repeated centrifugation and then washed using a mixture of solvent (chloroform) and anti-solvent (ethanol). The final product was redispersed in chloroform and kept for further characterization.

In the above reaction, the GO provides a template for Cu2S QD growth, where the oxygen-containing groups on the GO sheets coordinate to the Cu ions complexed with OLA.16 The Cu2S QDs were grown in situ at elevated temperature by injecting a mixture of S2−–OLA. Meanwhile, the GO was also reduced to rGO by OLA.17 Fig. 1a shows a typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids. One can clearly see that the individual Cu2S QDs are well distributed on the graphene sheets without apparent aggregation, which guarantees efficient optoelectronic properties for the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids.17 From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1b, the interplanar distance of the Cu2S QDs was measured to be around 0.2 nm, corresponding to the (220) plane of the Cu2S fcc lattice. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids (see the inset of Fig. 1b) exhibits sharp diffraction rings corresponding to the specific crystalline planes of the Cu2S QDs and rGO, indicating that the Cu2S QDs on the graphene sheets are mainly randomly orientated.

The sizes of the Cu2S QDs on the rGO sheets were determined by measuring the diameters of the QDs in the TEM images, as shown in Fig. 1c. This diagram shows that the size distribution of the as-synthesized Cu2S QDs is in the range of 6–8 nm, which is consistent with that of pure Cu2S (Fig. S1†). The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis shown in Fig. 1d confirms that the oxygen content of the as-synthesized rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids is quite low in intensity due to the reduction of GO and that the ratio of Cu to S is about 2:1, further supporting the formation of rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids. In order to estimate the mass ratio of rGO to Cu2S QDs, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 750 °C in an air atmosphere. The results (Fig. S2†) show that the content of Cu2S QDs in the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids is about 29%. It is worth mentioning that different loading densities of Cu2S QDs on the graphene sheets could be obtained in a controlled fashion by changing the ratio of Cu(acac)2/GO used in the synthesis (see Fig. S3†).
Raman spectroscopy was performed in order to characterize the GO and the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids, as shown in Fig. 2. Both spectra exhibit a disorder induced D band at about 1340 cm−1, a G band at about 1585 cm−1, and a small 2D band at about 2680 cm−1. Compared with GO, an obvious decline in the relative intensity of the D band to the G band can be observed for the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids, suggesting a change in the electronic conjugation state during the reduction process of GO.

To further characterize the optical properties of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids, we synthesized pure Cu2S QDs under the same conditions, except in the absence of GO. Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids as well as those of the pure Cu2S QDs. As shown in Fig. 3a, the pure Cu2S QDs have a wide absorption band up to 750 nm. After the addition of rGO, the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids exhibit an enhanced absorbance over a broad region ranging from 300 to 750 nm. From the PL spectra (excited at 380 nm) in Fig. 3b, a dominant emission peak at 492 nm can be clearly observed for the pure Cu2S QDs, while the PL intensity of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids is too weak to be identified. Similar to previous reports on other semiconductor QD–rGO hybrids,7,8,18–20 this behaviour can be attributed to a photo-induced electron transfer from the Cu2S QDs to the rGO sheets, which hampers the radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs and results in PL quenching.

Since the photo-induced electrons are able to transfer quickly from the Cu2S QDs to the rGO sheets, one would expect a remarkable photoelectric response to occur in photodevices based upon the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids. Therefore, we fabricated a prototype photodetector device by drop casting a dispersion of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids in chloroform onto a SiO2 substrate between two Au electrodes with a spacing of 15 μm. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4a, a thin film composed of rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids was successfully deposited between the Au electrodes. The typical I–V curves of the device, with and without blue light irradiation (405 nm, 30 mW), are shown in Fig. 4a. Compared with the device in the dark, the current is dramatically increased by over 70% when the blue light is turned on. This increase in current, under blue light irradiation, is observed for all of the hybrid films with different thicknesses, demonstrating the excellent photosensitivity of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids. The photoelectric response is much stronger than that of pure Cu2S (see Fig. S4†), which further confirms that the photo-induced electrons and holes generated in the Cu2S QDs are separated efficiently and rapidly transferred to the rGO sheets, producing an additional current when the charge reaches the Au electrodes through the rGO sheets.

Upper inset: schematic of the hybrid-based photodetector device. Lower inset: a typical SEM image the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrid film integrated between two Au electrodes. (b) The current response versus time under intermittent blue light irradiation with a voltage of 10 V. 
We also estimated the repeatability of the photoelectric response of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids. Fig. 4b shows the typical time-dependent photocurrent generated using blue light irradiation at time intervals of 25 seconds. One can clearly see that the photocurrent exhibits good repeatability over repeated on–off cycles of blue light irradiation, and that the current values stay relatively stable for both light-on and light-off states. The photocurrent increases or reduces drastically after the blue light is turned on or off, exhibiting a fast photoelectric response. Therefore, combined with the PL quenching of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids, we believe that this drastic photoresponse can be attributed to the efficient separation of the photo-induced charges and the fast transfer of electrons from the Cu2S QDs to the rGO sheets.
In order to gain a better understanding of the charge transfer process taking place at the interface between the Cu2S QDs and rGO sheets, the energy band structures of both the Cu2S QDs and rGO should be considered. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of rGO are roughly estimated to be 4.61–4.66 and 4.66–4.71 eV, considering graphene's work function (4.66 eV) and the small opening of the gap caused by the incomplete reduction.8,21 While the bandgap of the Cu2S QDs is ∼1.2 eV, the location of CBM and VBM have been reported to be ∼4.18 and ∼5.38 eV, respectively.22,23 Therefore, when the Cu2S QDs are in direct and tight contact with the rGO sheets, a large valence band offset and conduction band offset will form at the interface between the Cu2S QDs and rGO. Under blue light irradiation, photo-induced electrons and holes are generated and separated in the Cu2S QDs, and then transferred rapidly to the rGO sheets due to this band offset at the interface, as shown in Fig. 5. Since the mobility of electrons in graphene is greater than that of holes,24,25 and due to the different band offsets at the interface, the transfer rates of the photo-induced electrons are probably entirely different to those of the holes, resulting in the separate transfer of electrons and holes to the rGO sheets. Finally, the separated electrons and holes in the rGO sheets are rapidly drifted to opposite electrodes by the external electric field,8 resulting in a fast photoelectric response.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a facile and efficient approach for the one-pot synthesis of rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids, in which the reduction of GO and direct formation of Cu2S QDs on graphene sheets occur simultaneously. Moreover, the density of the Cu2S QDs assembled onto the rGO surface can be easily tailored by changing the ratio of Cu2S to GO. The optoelectronic properties of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids have also been investigated. The hybrids exhibit an excellent photoelectric response with good repeatability of the photocurrent over repeated on–off cycles of blue light irradiation, which can be attributed to the efficient generation of photo-induced carriers in the Cu2S QDs and the separate transfer of these photo-induced carriers from the Cu2S QDs to the rGO. We believe that this approach would enable a viable route toward the controlled synthesis of various rGO–semiconductor QD hybrids, and our findings would highlight the potential application of the rGO–Cu2S QD hybrids for new optoelectronic devices.
