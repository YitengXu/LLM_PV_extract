    , Accepted 12th March 2013First published on 12th March 2013AbstractA one-step dye cocktail strategy is proposed for the efficient sensitization of a ZnO photoelectrode in dye-sensitized solar cells. A high IPCE plateau is obtained between 400 and 600 nm by using two complementary indoline metal-free organic dyes. The roles of the co-adsorbents are also investigated and the cells are shown to be highly stable upon aging.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained increasing attention from both industry and academic research during the last decade. They present many potential advantages such as flexibility, light-weight, low cost and easy processing with colourful and transparent features, which render them greatly promising for the next generation of photovoltaic devices.1,2 The dye is a key component of the device since its role is to efficiently harvest the light and inject the photogenerated electron into the semiconductor oxide. Many dyes have been developed and extensively studied for this application such as: ruthenium complexes, zinc porphyrin and metal-free organic dyes.3,4 However, a disadvantage of using a single sensitizer is the restricted wavelength range of light absorption. Co-sensitization is an effective approach to achieve a panchromatic collection behaviour of the photoelectrode. The device performance is enhanced through a combination of two or more dyes covalently attached on a semiconductor film, extending the light-harvesting ability so as to increase the photocurrent in the devices. The sensitizers must have complementary absorption spectra and matched energy levels (LUMOs and oxide conduction band edge). This approach with TiO2 has attracted much attention during the recent years and has given rise to remarkable results.4–9 For instance Yella et al.,4 by combining a zinc porphyrin (YD2−o−C8) and an organic dye (Y123), have attained a solar cell with an overall conversion efficiency of 12.3%. The presence of the organic dye was proved to enhance the cell’s short circuit current (Jsc) by improving the light harvesting efficiency (LHE). The most successful systems reported in the literature are twofold: Zn porphyrin (or phtalocyanine) and organic dye4–6 and ruthenium complex and organic dye.7–9 The co-sensitization by organic dyes has attracted much less attention.10–13
Various metal-free organic dyes with high absorption coefficients have been investigated as sensitizers of TiO2 and ZnO DSSCs.10–16 The good intramolecular charge transfer upon excitation is achieved by using D-π-A molecular structures, D being the donor group, A the acceptor group and π a long conjugated chain.3 The anchoring group is localized in the vicinity of the acceptor group in order to favor the fast electronic charge transfer to the oxide after excitation. In the case of ZnO, indoline dyes have been shown to be highly efficient.16–18 Indoline dyes exhibit not only remarkable performance, but also a relatively inexpensive to manufacture due to their simple preparation procedure.14
In this communication we report the combination of indoline dyes for the marked improvement of the ZnO solar cell efficiency. We show that a one-step cocktail sensitization approach, using an equimolar mixture of indoline dyes in the presence of co-adsorbent to avoid dye aggregation, gives rise to a high incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) over a broad wavelength range. Moreover, the cell is stable to aging under ambient condition.
The molecular structures of the investigated dyes are presented in Fig. 1a. The D149 and D205 dyes, with a rhodanine dimer as the acceptor and carboxylic acid as the anchoring group, are the main absorbers. They are affiliated dyes. D205 is an amphiphilic derivative of D149 in which the ethyl chain bound to a N of rhodanine is replaced by an octyl chain which is supposed to limit the dye aggregation upon the sensitization step. The D131 dye has a cyano-acrylic acid acceptor group and has been used as a co-sensitizer. The normalized absorbance spectra of the dyes in solution are presented in Fig. 1b. The HOMO–LUMO absorption peak of D149 and D205 is centered at 530 nm and presents an absorption gap at about 450 nm. In the case of D131, due to the weaker acceptor strength, the absorption peak is blue-shifted and centered at about 420 nm. It shows a good complementarity with D149 and D205 dyes. Fig. 1b also shows the absorbance spectra of an equimolar solution (0.25 mM/0.25 mM) of D149–D131 and D205–D131 that confirms the good spectral complementarity of these dyes for visible light harvesting. Similar but broadened spectra were recorded in the case of dyes adsorbed on the ZnO film.

The dye combination was tested in ZnO solar cells. Nanoporous ZnO films,18 with a thickness of about 8 μm were prepared by electrochemical deposition19 as described in the ESI.† Typical J–V curves without co-adsorbent are presented in Fig. 2a and the cell parameters are gathered in Table 1. Fig. 2b compares the IPCE curves (corrected for the FTO substrate transmission) for individual dyes and for the co-sensitized cell. The IPCE of the latter is improved in the blue region compared to the D149 alone. The IPCE plateau over a wide wavelength range (400 nm to 600 nm) confirms the high complementarity of the dyes. The same result was found in the case of co-sensitizing of D205 with D131 as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The IPCE and dye absorption curves show that the cell’s higher Jsc in the case of the dye mixture is due to better light harvesting in the blue region. Without a co-adsorbent, the cell’s Voc varies with the dye used due to the recombination pathway between the oxide and the electrolyte. Whereas, when a co-adsorbent was used we found that the cell’s open circuit voltage (Voc) did not change significantly between the main dye alone and the dye mixture as shown in Table 1. The dye molar ratio in the sensitization solution was optimized to reach the best results (see Fig. S2 in ESI†) and we found the highest conversion efficiency for an equimolar solution of indolines (0.25 mM D131 and 0.25 mM D149 or D205). The excess of one dye led to a decreased LHE in part of the visible light spectral region and then a lowered Jsc.

It is well-known that organic dyes have a tendency to aggregate upon sensitizing. The phenomenon is limited by using a co-adsorbent, that is classically cholic acid (CA) in the case of indoline dyes.20,21 We have shown recently improved results using amphiphilic molecules such as fatty acids, and the best candidate was octanoic acid (C8H16O2).20 We have investigated the roles of cholic acid and octanoic acid on the dye concentration in the photoelectrodes (Table 1 and Fig. S3, ESI†). The film dye concentration in the case of D149 alone is high and it decreases with the presence of co-adsorbent, whereas Jsc is improved due to reduction of aggregation. The D205 concentration is much lower than the D149 one (entries 1 and 2) and it confirms the aggregation reduction assigned to the presence of the octyl chain. In the case of organic dye co-sensitization the total dye concentration in the absence of a co-adsorbent (entries 3 and 4) is higher than the D149–D205 concentration when used alone (entries 1 and 2) and suggests the presence of aggregates. Using CA reduces the concentration of each dye by about a factor 2. This is due to less aggregatation and to the fact that CA occupies a fraction of the oxide surface. In the case of octanoic acid, the concentration lies in-between the two previous cases. The IPCE curve presents a plateau at around 80% and suggests a high LHE, since the charge collection efficiency has been measured recently by impedance spectroscopy and was found to be higher than 92% in the case of electrodeposited nanoporous ZnO photoelectrodes.22 A close inspection of Table 1 reveals that the total concentration of dye in the case of co-sensitization with co-adsorbent (entries 7 and 9) is higher than the concentration of individual dyes (entries 5, 6 and 8). This is partly due to the lower steric size of D131 compared to D149 or D205. We can also note that for D131 the cyanoacetic acid group permits the dye to anchor by either the carboxyl group or cyano group.7,23 Therefore more adsorption sites on the ZnO surface could be available for this dye giving rise to better sensitization.
The Voc is also an important parameter of the cells (Table 1). It is favored by a large co-adsorbent such as CA, which decreases the dark current and then the charge recombination with tri-iodide (entries 6,7 compared to 8,9 in Table 1).20
Solar cells co-sensitized using a D131–D149 and octanoic acid mixture have been prepared and stored under ambient illumination and temperature conditions (see experimental section in the ESI†). Their power conversion characteristics have been measured periodically and reported in Fig. 3a. They were highly stable with no performance degradation over six months. The three cell parameters, Voc, FF and Jsc did not change. We have also characterized the devices by impedance spectroscopy (see ESI† for experimental details). The impedance spectra are presented in Fig. S4a, ESI.† They have been fitted with the equivalent circuit presented in Fig. S4b, ESI.† From the main arc of the circle observed at low frequency, the chemical capacitance Cμ and the charge transfer resistance Rct have been determined.22 The electron lifetime is defined by τn = RctCμ and is presented in Fig. 3b. Some initial internal evolution in the cell occurred. Indeed, we observed an increase of Cμ during the first 30 days and then stabilization, whereas Rct decreased concurrently (Fig. S4c in ESI†). The rise in Cμ suggests some initial ZnO doping and density of states (DOS) increase in the oxide, since we have DOS = Cμ/(qAL(1−p)) with p being the porosity, A the cell surface area, L the photoelectrode thickness and q the elementary charge.22 However, the phenomenon is compensated by an increase in recombination and gives rise to an almost contant τn.

In summary, we have described a successful methodology for increasing the overall efficiency of ZnO based DSSCs by 5–8%. Two indoline dyes with complementary absorption spectra and different anchoring groups have been used for co-sensitizing. A one-step cocktail approach has been developed and the best performance was reached for an equimolar mixture in the sensitization solution. The presence of octanoic acid as the co-adsorbent optimizes the dye loading and limits the dye aggregation. We have also found that our DSSCs are highly stable upon aging for several months. Impedance spectroscopy shows an evolution of Rct and Cμ during the first month that could be due to the increase of DOS. However, the charge carrier lifetime has been found to be constant throughout the test period. The results prove the great interest of co-sensitization using organic dyes and acid co-adsorbents. This approach could be extended to the near-IR region by finding an ad-hoc dye.
