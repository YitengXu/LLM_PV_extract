    , Accepted 16th June 2011First published on 22nd July 2011AbstractWe report on the design, synthesis and characterization of light harvesting small molecules for use in solution-processed small molecule bulk heterojunction (SM-BHJ) solar cell devices. These molecular materials are based upon an acceptor/donor/acceptor (A/D/A) core with donor endcapping units. Utilization of a dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole (DTS) donor and pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) acceptor leads to strong charge transfer characteristics, resulting in broad optical absorption spectra extending well beyond 700 nm. SM-BHJ solar cell devices fabricated with the specific example 5,5′-bis{7-(4-(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine}-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (6) as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor component showed short circuit currents above −10 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 3%. Thermal processing is a critical factor in obtaining favorable active layer morphologies and high PCE values. A combination of UV-visible spectroscopy, conductive and photo-conductive atomic force microscopies, dynamic secondary mass ion spectrometry (DSIMS), and grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments were carried out to characterize how thermal treatment influences the active layer structure and organization.
Introduction
Solution processed organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) have emerged as a promising energy technology due to their ease of fabrication, potential to enable low-cost manufacturing, and ability to be incorporated onto light-weight flexible substrates.1Conjugated polymer based OPVs have by far been the most studied. This considerable world-wide effort in both industry2 and academia3–8 has resulted in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 6–8% for polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices. The keys to achieving high PCEs are the utilization of narrow band gap polymers with high charge carrier mobilities for efficient light harvesting and charge transport9–12 and controlling the BHJ morphology via processing to yield appropriate nanoscale phase segregation and percolation pathways for charge separation and collection.13–16
In contrast, solution-processed small molecule BHJ (SM-BHJ) devices have received less attention.17–20 SM-BHJ active layers can offer advantages relative to their polymer counterparts, in that the materials have well defined structures, are easily functionalized, can be readily purified by standard organic chemistry techniques, and tend not to suffer from batch-to-batch variations typical of synthetic polymers. Reports of efficient SM-BHJ devices have recently emerged that have utilized merocyanine dyes,21,22squaraine dyes,23–25isoindigo,26 and diketopyrrolopyrrole27 based chromophores, linear28–30 and star-shaped oligothiophenes,31,32 and push–pull organic dyes33 as the light harvesting donor component and fullerene derivatives as the complementary acceptor material. Optimized devices exhibit PCEs on the order of 2–3% and have even reached upwards of 4%.27,31,33 Additionally, the combination of a solution processed SM-BHJ active layer with thermally evaporated n-type layers has led to devices with PCEs from 4 to 5%.34–36
While the results discussed in the preceding paragraph are encouraging, there still exists a need for the development of novel molecular light harvesting materials. Important parameters for effective small molecule donors include: (a) broad and efficient optical absorption that extends into the near-IR region to maximize photon absorption, (b) relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels from −5 to −5.5 eV to maximize open circuit voltages, while still matching commonly used high work function anodes, (c) relatively planar structures for improving charge carrier mobility, and (d) sufficient viscosity and solubility to enable thin film formation via solution deposition. Additionally, it is important that novel molecular architectures have facile and highly tunable syntheses so that molecular libraries can be generated rapidly and efficiently.37
In the design of an efficient light harvesting small molecular architecture, we utilized the donor/acceptor (D/A) concept, where the π-electron distribution between electron rich and electron deficient moieties leads to low energy optical transitions.38,39 Depending on the electronic offset between the donor and acceptor, a wide range of band gaps can be achieved and thus the optical absorption can be tailored.11,40–42 For organic solar cells, it is important that the active layer components absorb from 300 to 800 nm, the region of maximum photon flux in the solar spectrum.10,43,44 Endcapping a proposed acceptor/donor/acceptor core with weak π-conjugated donor units is further expected to increase electron delocalization and allow variation of the HOMO/LUMO levels, where LUMO refers to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.
As a key building block, we utilized the pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) heterocycle as the acceptor moiety.45,46 This unit has a high electron affinity making it a suitable electron acceptor module within the chromophore design. Very recent reports by You et al.,47 Bäuerle et al.,48 and Welch and Bazan49 have demonstrated that PT is an excellent electron acceptor. Importantly, the asymmetric nature of the pyridine containing PT heterocycle allows for mono-functionalization,50,51 which can lead to facile molecular synthesis, not common with symmetric heterocycles, such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT).52,53
Herein, we describe the design of and synthetic entry into π-conjugated molecular platforms based on the PT unit as the acceptor building block and we detail the incorporation of one such derivative into SM-BHJ devices. Furthermore, we use a variety of characterization techniques including photo-conductive atomic force microscopy (pc-AFM), grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and dynamic secondary mass ion spectrometry (DSIMS) to probe how the processing history influences the solid state arrangement of the active layer thin film.
Results and discussion
Design, synthesis and characterization of functional donor–acceptor building blocks
As a model system, we sought to mono-functionalize 4,7-dibromo-pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PTBr2) with the common heterocyclic donor thiophene (Th). As shown in Scheme 1, following a microwave assisted Stille cross-coupling procedure between equal molar equivalents of PTBr2 and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene, the mono-substituted compound 7-bromo-4-thienyl[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (1) can be obtained in yields as high as 85%. There was no evidence of any significant formation of bis-substituted product via1H NMR spectroscopy, indicating a high degree of selectivity for coupling at the electron deficient C–Br bond adjacent to the pyridal N-atom. Compound 1 was characterized by multinuclear NMR solution spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 reveals 4 resonances in the aromatic region, with the PT CH resonance shifted the furthest downfield at δ 8.7 ppm, owing to the electron withdrawing effect of the pyridal N-atom. The thiophene CHproton in the 4-position adjacent to the PT acceptor is also affected by the strong electron affinity of the PT unit as it is shifted downfield by nearly 1 ppm from the CHprotons in the 3- and 2-positions on the thiophene ring. The regiochemistry of 1 was confirmed via a 1H–1H NMR spectroscopy NOE experiment, where no cross peak could be detected between the aromatic PT proton resonance and the thiophene resonances.

Single crystals of 1 suitable for analysis by X-ray crystallography were grown by slow evaporation of a concentrated CH2Cl2 solution. As seen in Fig. 1, the thiophene heterocycle is coupled to the PT unit at the 4-carbon position confirming our proposed regiochemistry from solution characterization. Compound 1 exhibits a planar conformation with the pyridal N-atom and thiophene S-atom cis to one another. The planarity of the molecule in the solid state implies that there is minimal steric strain between the two aromatic rings. The N(1)–S(2) distance of 2.89 Å is within the van der Waals radii of both atoms54 and may indicate the existence of a through space non-bonding interaction.55,56

Two additional derivatives were synthesized with the goal of accessing more practical functionalized donor–acceptor building blocks. In order to extend the π-conjugation length, PTBr2 was coupled with benzothiophene (BzTh) to yield 4-(benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-7-bromo-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (2) in 82% yield, see Scheme 1. Anticipating the importance of solution processing, the compound 7-bromo-4-(5-(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (3) was synthesized in 87% yield, where the PTBr2 unit is mono-functionalized with a 2-hexyl substituted bithiophene moiety. In 3, the 2-hexyl substituted bithiophene extends the effective π-conjugated length and improves solubility in organic solvents.52,57 Compounds 2 and 3 were characterized by multinuclear solution NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. It should be noted that syntheses of 2 and 3 were attempted using a Suzuki coupling procedure between PTBr2 and benzothiophene-2-boronic acid or 5′-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene-5-boronic acid pinacol ester, respectively (see ESI†). In both cases, product yields no greater than 68% were achieved as a result of significant formation of the bis-substituted PT product. Despite the more toxic nature of the stannylated starting materials and the resulting organotin by-products, Stille coupling protocols were used in our studies because of the higher product yields.
Design, synthesis and characterization of light harvesting donor–acceptor–donor–acceptor–donor molecules
Effective donor moieties for use in low band gap D/A type systems include carbazole, fluorene, silolefluorene, cyclopenta-(2,1-b;3,4-b′)dithiophene, dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole, and benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene, among others.9–12 Taking into consideration the electronic and film forming properties of the resulting molecule, it was desirable in our molecular design to employ an electron rich thiophene based donor unit with alkyl substituents to (a) promote strong charge transfer transitions within the molecular backbone, (b) minimize aryl–aryl steric interactions to enhance molecular planarity and enable π-electron delocalization, and (c) ensure solubility in organic solvents for solution processing. Based on these criteria, the dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole (DTS) unit was utilized,58–60 as it can be synthesized in a straightforward fashion, acts as an excellent electron donor, while still maintaining relatively deep HOMO energy levels,61,62 enhances solid-state interchromophore packing compared to the related cyclopenta-(2,1-b; 3,4-b′)dithiophene derivative,63–65 and the 4-coordinate Si atom allows incorporation of inert alkyl side chains to improve solubility.40,662-Ethylhexyl side chains were specifically introduced to further ensure good solubility.62
As shown in Scheme 2, molecules 5,5′-bis{7-(4-(thiophen-2-yl))-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine}-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (4), 5,5′-bis{7-(4-(benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl))-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine}-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (5), and 5,5′-bis{7-(4-(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine}-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (6) were synthesized via a microwave assisted Stille cross-coupling reactions between 1, 2, or 3, respectively, and 0.5 equivalents of DTS(SnMe3)2 by using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst.40,62Precipitation with methanol and purificationvia flash silica-gel chromatography gave the desired products as purple solids in yields greater than 70%. All three molecules were characterized by multinuclear NMR solution spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The 1H NMR spectrum of each molecule displays resonances consistent with symmetric structures. In each case, the proton on the PT unit is shifted furthest downfield, owing to the strong electron withdrawing nature of the pyridal N-atom. NOE cross-correlation peaks are also observed between the PT proton and the aromatic DTS resonances, consistent with the proposed regiochemistry of the pyridal N-atom shown in Scheme 2 (see ESI†). The orientation of 4 in the solid state was determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The molecule exists in a near planar conformation with the pyridal N-atoms of the PT units trans to the Si bridge of the DTS unit. As with 1, the thiophene S-atoms and pyridal N-atoms are directed towards each other (see ESI†). The solubilities of 4, 5, and 6 in CHCl3 were found to be 29 ± 2, 4 ± 1, and 33 ± 2 mg mL−1, respectively. The considerably lower solubility of 5 compared to 4 and 6 can be attributed to the longer, planar aromatic structure and lack of solubilizing alkyl side chains, which can lead to stronger intermolecular interactions. The higher solubility of 4 and 6 compared to 5 is reflected in their ability to form thicker and more uniform films from CHCl3 solution. All compounds exhibit good thermal stability showing <5% mass loss at 420 °C, 427 °C, and 411 °C, for 4, 5, and 6, respectively, viathermogravimetric analysis (see ESI†).

Optical, electrochemical, and thermal characterization of 4, 5, and 6
The UV-visible optical absorption spectra of 4, 5, and 6 in CHCl3 at room temperature are shown in Fig. 2. Compound 4 has the furthest blue shifted absorption spectrum with an absorption maximum (λmax) of 582 nm. For compound 5, the increased π-conjugated length afforded by the BzTh moieties relative to Th yields a slightly red-shifted spectrum with λmax = 594 nm. Compound 6 has the furthest red-shifted absorption spectrum with λmax = 625 nm. There is little change in the λmax and spectral width of C6H5Cl solutions upon heating (see ESI†), demonstrating that there is a less pronounced tendency for 6 to aggregate in solution, when compared to typical narrow band gap conjugated polymers.66
 Fig. 2  Normalized UV-visible absorption spectra of 4 (red), 5 (blue), and 6 (black) in CHCl3 solution. 
Transitioning from solution to the solid state, one observes a broadening and a red shift of the optical absorption of 4–6 (Fig. 3a), along with the emergence of fine structure within the low energy band. Such features are attributed to a more rigid and ordered structure in the solid, which lead to greater π-electron delocalization across the molecular backbone and enhanced inter-chromophore interactions.26,27 Compound 6 shows the greatest change, with a red shift in the onset of absorption (λonset) of ∼95 nm (Table 1). Specifically, thin films of 6 exhibit absorption throughout the region of greatest photon flux in the solar spectrum, with λmax = 720 nm and λonset = 820 nm. The effects of thermal annealing on thin films of 6 were also examined. As seen in Fig. 3b, the optical density of the lowest energy absorption peak is progressively increased upon thermal annealing at temperatures at or below 110 °C, which we attribute to better π–π packing.27,67 Further heating above 110 °C results in no significant changes. Similar observations were observed for thin films of 4 and 5 (see ESI†).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in CH2Cl2 solution were used to evaluate electrochemical characteristics, as shown in Fig. 4a. Relevant data are provided in Table 2.68 As expected, compounds 4, 5, and 6 exhibit two reversible oxidation waves that are associated with the internal DTS core and terminal donor units, and a reversible reduction peak for the two symmetric PT acceptors. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of all three compounds were estimated from the onset of oxidation and reduction, respectively; data are presented in Table 2. All three compounds have relatively low lying LUMO energy levels as a result of the incorporation of the PT units within the electronically delocalized backbone. These values are similar to related PT containing small molecules.48 Compounds 5 and 6 have slightly deeper LUMO levels compared to 4, most reasonably as a result of the increased conjugation length.52 Compound 6 has the highest energy HOMO level, which we attribute to the increased donor character across the molecular backbone afforded by the additional terminal bithiophene moieties. In all cases the high acceptor content in the molecules results in relatively deep HOMO levels (−5.16 eV to −5.25 eV), which are advantageous for achieving high open circuit voltages in fullerene-based OPV devices.69 The trends in decreasing optical and electrochemical band gap in solution from 4 to 6 are supported by DFT calculations, as shown in the ESI†.

Differential scanning calorimetry was used to probe the thermal properties of 4, 5, and 6 (Fig. 4b and Table 2). Compound 4 exhibits a sharp melting transition at ∼220 °C and crystallizes at ∼165 °C. In 5, the incorporation of the BzTh units on both ends of the molecule results in a large increase in melting point and crystallization to ∼256 °C and ∼204 °C, respectively. The melting transition of compound 6 (∼208 °C) is slightly lower than that observed for 4. The significantly higher melting temperature of 5, compared to 4 and 6, is likely a result of the more planar structure; this can lead to stronger intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state and is consistent with the lower solubility of 5 in CHCl3 compared to 4 and 6, vide supra.
Solution processed SM-BHJ solar cell devices utilizing a 6:PC71BM active layer
Based upon the appropriate optical features, good solubility in CHCl3, and good film forming properties of 6, we focused our efforts on the incorporation of this molecule into SM-BHJ solar cells and subsequent device optimization. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of 6 (Table 2) also make it an excellent candidate for use with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor component.69 The absorption spectrum of a film obtained from a 6:PC71BM blend (60:40 w/w) cast from CHCl3 solution is shown in Fig. 5. One observes an absorption spectrum that spans the entire UV-visible spectrum and extends into the near-IR, an attractive feature not common with many small molecule–fullerene combinations.17,18

SM-BHJ photovoltaic devices were fabricated using a standard device architecture of ITO/HIL/6:PC71BM/Al. Plextronics Plexcore OC AQ-1300 was used as the hole injection layer (HIL). Testing of the devices was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere using 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination, as described previously.27,61 Active layers were deposited at 25 °C by spin coating a 2% (w/v) CHCl3 solution of 6:PC71BM. The choice of CHCl3 was based on the fact that it is a good solvent for both 6 and PC71BM, and its low boiling point allows for fast evaporation during spin-coating, which yields films with controllable thicknesses. The active layers were optimized by varying the 6:PC71BM blends under 5 compositional ratios (30:70, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, and 70:30), at 3 different active layer thicknesses (75, 85, and 105 nm), and by post-deposition thermal annealing (110 °C for 2 minutes). Best performances from this set of experiments were obtained with solar cell devices with an active layer of 85 nm, a 6:PC71BM ratio of 60:40, and after thermally annealing at 110 °C; the results are summarized in Table 3, while representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves are presented in Fig. 6. Full details of SM-BHJ devices with 75 nm and 105 nm active layer thicknesses can be found in the ESI†.

          As-cast devices with a 50:50 6:PC71BM blend ratio and an 85 nm thick active layer yield PCE values on the order of 1.3%. General trends show that decreasing the donor content in the active layer results in little change in the PCE for 40:60 and 30:70 6:PC71BM blends, while increasing the donor content in the active layer results in a decrease in PCE to 0.7% and 0.5% for 60:40 and 70:30 6:PC71BM blends, respectively, see Table 3. Similar trends were observed for 75 nm and 105 nm active layer thicknesses (see ESI†). The best performing as-cast devices were obtained with a 6:PC71BM ratio of 40:60 by mass (1:1.3 molar ratio) and displayed a PCE of approximately 1.5%, see the second entry in Table 3.
Thermal annealing of small molecule–fullerene BHJ devices can in specific instances lead to improved device performance.23,27 As seen in Fig. 5, heating a 60:40 6:PC71BM thin film to 110 °C for 2 minutes causes the emergence of vibronic structure in the absorbance spectrum (see ESI† for other blend ratios). These features have been associated with better packing and increased order in the donor material.26,27,67 We found that annealing 6:PC71BM blends with 30:70 and 40:60 ratios resulted in no significant improvement in the PCE; however, for the 50:50 6:PC71BM blend, an increase in both short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) leads to a near doubling of the PCE from 1.3% to 2.4%. The largest changes between as-cast and annealed devices were observed for devices with high donor content (60:40 and 70:30), where PCEs on the order of 3% were achieved (see Table 3).
The highest PCE was achieved with 60:40 6:PC71BM active layer blends that were 85 nm thick. Upon annealing, increases in Jsc and FF, from −3.7 mA cm−2 and 0.27 to −10.9 mA cm−2 and 0.42, respectively, were observed, which lead to a PCE of 3.2% (see Table 3). As seen in Fig. 6, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) increases by two and a half-fold. These EQE data show that 6:PC71BM based solar cells have a broad spectral response of up to 46% with photocurrent being generated beyond 800 nm. Furthermore, the integrated EQE for these devices matches Jsc to within 4%.
Single-carrier devices were fabricated using an ITO/HIL/6:PC71BM/Au or Al architecture to gain an insight of the effective charge carrier mobilities in annealed 6:PC71BM blends with a 60:40 composition ratio. These mobilities were extracted by fitting the current–voltage characteristics to the space-charge limited current model.70,71 From these experiments one finds hole and electron diode mobilities to be 1.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1s−1 and 5.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1s−1, respectively. The electron mobility is thus approximately one order of magnitude higher than the hole mobility, which leads to unbalanced charge carrier transport (unlike high efficiency SM BHJ devices,27 or polymer BHJ devices72), and may be responsible for the lower FF values in the present system.73
Tapping mode, conductive and photoconductive AFM measurements
Nanoscale phase separation and photocurrent generation within photoactive layers were probed by tapping mode, conductive, and photoconductive atomic force microscopy (AFM) in order to gain insight into the thermal annealing effects.61,74Fig. 7a and c display the topographic and phase images of 60:40 6:PC71BM films as cast atop ITO/HIL substrates. These films appear to have a cluster like morphology and are fairly smooth, with a surface roughness of ∼1 nm. After heating, there is very little change in the surface roughness, but the domains appear to become better defined and do not increase substantially in size, as seen in both the topography and phase images in Fig. 7b and d, respectively. This observation differs from other small molecule:fullerene systems, where significant increases in surface roughness and large phase separation take place upon thermal annealing.26,27

Phase images of (c) as-cast and (d) annealed. Scan size for all images was 4 μm × 4 μm. Thermal annealing conditions: 110 °C for 2 minutes. 

Fig. 8 provides a summary from a set of conductive AFM (c-AFM) experiments that were carried out to examine nanoscale electronic properties and, by inference, the organization of the donor and acceptor phases within the interior of the film. These measurements involved using a gold tip with a work function of 5.1 eV.74 Since the work function of the ITO/HIL substrate is estimated at 5.3 eV (see ESI†), the overall testing platform measures hole currents. At an applied bias of −3 V, the average injected current within the conductive areas is larger (Fig. 8b) for the annealed films, compared to the as-cast films (Fig. 8a). Therefore, the increase in the dark current is consistent with a reorganization of the blend components to improve hole transport through the bulk. Whether the increased current also related to improved carrier generation upon irradiation was probed by examination of the corresponding photoconductive AFM (pcAFM) measurements, as shown in Fig. 8c and d. The relative integrated photocurrents of as-cast and annealed films over a 4 μm × 4 μm area were found to be 0.7 μA and 4.1 μA, respectively, almost a 5-fold improvement. This finding correlates well with the Jsc increase shown in Fig. 6a. Furthermore, the photocurrent histogram in Fig. 8e illustrates that thermal annealing causes a wider dispersion of the more conductive surface domains. The composite set of AFM data are consistent with substantial molecular redistribution and better order within the active layer, which leads to the improved photocurrent generation.

DSIMS and GIWAXS measurements
The increase in PCE after annealing in conjunction with the pcAFM results suggests that thermal annealing causes a change in the distribution and/or a reorganization of the components in the blend. To probe the distribution of 6:PC71BM blended films in the bulk and at the top and bottom interfaces, before and after thermal annealing, dynamic secondary mass ion spectrometry (DSIMS) was employed. DSIMS is a well-established depth-profiling technique with high sensitivity and the ability to simultaneously obtain profiles of several elements and thereby track the mobility or diffusion of compounds in multi-component systems.75,76 Deuterated fullerene PC61BM-d5 was used as a surrogate for PC71BM to establish a unique mass signal for the fullerene component.77,78Sulfur and deuterium signals were thus used to identify 6 and PC61BM-d5, respectively. ITO/HIL was used as the substrate and sample composition and processing conditions were identical to best performing devices. For clarity, the deuterium, D, and sulfur, S, signals are plotted against the relative thickness of the sample as shown in Fig. 9. The relative thickness is plotted from 0, the top surface of the film, and 1 being the start of the ITO substrate.
 Fig. 9  
DSIMS plot for 60:40 6:PC71BM blend films. Dotted lines: as-cast. Solid lines: annealed at 110 °C for 2 minutes. Blue lines: deuterium (D) signals. Orange lines: sulfur (S) signals. The SM BHJ/HIL interface occurs at ∼0.6. 

Fig. 9 shows that the intensity of the D and S signals for as-cast films (dotted lines) is constant throughout the entire film, up to a relative distance of 0.6, where the SM BHJ/HIL interface occurs. These data are consistent with a fairly uniform distribution of 6 and PC61BM-d5 across the vertical direction of the active layer. The distribution of the components after annealing for 2 min at 110 °C (solid traces) exhibits an apparent change at the interfaces of the active matrix. The top surface of the blend shows a sharp increase of sulfur content (distance ≈ 0.1), which suggests a surface segregation of 6 that was not clearly visible in the AFM analysis. Such surface wetting of alkyl side chain containing donor materials has been reported in polymer based BHJ systems such as P3HT:PC61BM.79 This effect is ultimately undesirable for device performance since 6 is anticipated to form an electron blocking layer and decrease charge collection efficiency at the Al electrode.80 Interestingly, the SM BHJ:HIL interface also shows an increase in the S signal (distance ≈ 0.5) relative to the as-cast film, and suggests an additional location where accumulation of 6 takes place. Based on these observations, interdiffusion of molecule 6 and PC61BM-d5 is rapid at 110 °C and results in an excess of 6 at both active layer interfaces.
Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to obtain information on the differences in structural order within the active layer. GIWAXS is a scattering technique that has been used in a number of polymer BHJ systems to delineate structure–processing relationships in thin films;81–83 however few studies to date have looked at SM-BHJ systems. All the thin films examined in the study were cast under similar conditions to those used for solar cell fabrication, except that Si wafers coated with HIL were used as the substrate instead of ITO/HIL to reduce background scattering.
GIWAXS results are shown in Fig. 10. The data are represented as sector plots, which show three dimensional datasets whose x-axis represents the polar angle, y-axis represents q (scattering vector), and the color coded z-axis corresponds to intensity on a log scale.84 From these plots one finds the out of plane qz contribution at polar angle = 0°, while the in plane qxy scattering occurs at ±90°. As a control, we first probed neat films of 6 to determine how annealing modifies the structure of the donor material. As cast films of 6 display a strong Bragg reflection in the nominally out of plane direction (normal to substrate, qz = 3.21 nm−1), corresponding to a spacing of 1.96 nm (Fig. 10a). This spacing is attributed to stacking along the 2-ethylhexyl side chains analogous to the lamellae stacking in P3HT (i.e., (100) planes). This feature has been observed in several donor polymers with alkyl side chains orthogonal to the π-conjugated backbone, such as P3HT85,86 and PBTTT.87 The much larger intensity near the normal to the film plane shows that there is a strong tendency for the alkyl stacking direction to align in the out of plane direction. Nevertheless, the fact that the reflection is seen at all polar angles shows that there are some crystallites with (100) planes at all orientations with respect to the surface normal. A weaker reflection was also detected in the in plane direction (parallel to the substrate) at qxy = 18.1 nm−1 (d = 0.35 nm), which is typical for π–π intermolecular stacking. This reflection has highest intensity in the in plane direction, but is observed at all polar angles, suggesting that the π–π stacking direction in the crystals of 6 is roughly orthogonal to the alkyl chain stacking direction, as it is in many conjugated polymers. A weak diffuse halo ring exists at q = 14.3 nm−1 that is attributed at this point to amorphous scattering from the underlying HIL or possible amorphous regions within the 6 layer.84
 Fig. 10  GIWAXS plots for (a) 6as-cast film, (b) 6 film annealed at 110 °C for 2 minutes, (c) 60:40 6:PC71BM blend as-cast film and (d) 60:40 6:PC71BM blend film annealed at 110 °C for 2 minutes. All films cast from CHCl3 onto a Si/HIL substrate. 
Structural evolution of 6 upon heating is evident in several ways (Fig. 10b). The d spacing of the alkyl chain stacking reflection decreased slightly to 1.87 nm, which indicates improved packing order. Consistent with this, the width of the reflection decreased, indicating an increased crystalline correlation length, due either to an increase in crystallite size or a decrease in crystal defect density.87 This reflection is still present at all polar angles but remains much stronger in the out of plane direction. In other words, the internal structure of the film is increasingly textured so that crystallites are distributed throughout, but with a stronger preference for the (100) plane normals to be oriented in the out of plane direction. A weak second order reflection with a spacing of 3.74 nm appears along the nominal qz direction that is consistent with the improved order in the crystallites. The π–π in-plane peak remains at the same intermolecular distance as in the as-cast film of 6. However, the width of this reflection decreased and the intensity is more sharply peaked in the in plane direction, which is also consistent with an increased correlation length of the crystallites as well as an increase in their preferential orientation. Weak, broad but oriented, reflections also appear at qxy and qz ≈ 5.5 nm−1 and at a polar angle of ∼30°. These mixed index peaks indicate the development of three dimensional order in the annealed films of 6 (e.g. alkyl chain interdigitation).
For as-cast 60:40 6:PC71BM blended films, the characteristic reflections of 6 are not present and only contributions from the HIL or amorphous scattering as described earlier persist (Fig. 10c). Comparison of Fig. 10c with Fig. 10a and b shows that PC71BM prevents or disrupts the ability for crystalline 6 to efficiently pack. After annealing at 110 °C for 2 minutes, the characteristic reflections for 6 reappear (including the weak mixed index reflections), showing crystallization of 6 under these conditions (Fig. 10d). These features are consistent with the more pronounced vibronic definition in the absorption spectra of 6:PC71BM (Fig. 5), and suggest that the improvement in device PCE observed upon thermally annealing may ultimately be attributed to substantially more ordered donor domains.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have introduced a novel small molecule framework that relies on the PT acceptor unit. Taking advantage of the asymmetric nature of the PT unit, three well-defined small molecules with a D/A/D/A/D architecture have been synthesized in a facile fashion in high yields. By increasing the π-conjugation length or electron density of the terminal donor, materials with progressively small band gaps can be achieved. Specifically, 6 consists of a PT/DTS/PT core with hexyl substituted bithiophene endcapping units. This material shows several similarities to related D/A π-conjugated copolymers in both structure and properties, but is without the associated issues of batch variations and molecular weight dependence on device performance. Initial SM-BHJ devices incorporating 6 and the fullerene acceptor PC71BM gave PCEs up to 3.2%. A high donor content and thermal processing are important ingredients of this optimization. A combination of UV-visible spectroscopy, pcAFM, DSIMS, and GIWAXS experiments were performed to gain insight into the bulk properties of the active layer that result from thermal annealing. These experiments reveal that heating leads to increased molecular order in the donor phase and improved electronic properties. Moreover, there are excellent opportunities to further optimize the organization of the SM-BHJ active layer, for example by finding processing methods that improve the vertical organization such that the donor does not accumulate adjacent to the electron-collecting electrode. It is also worth pointing out that the limiting factor in solution processed SM-BHJ OPV devices typically arises from poor FF values, which prevents reaching efficiencies comparable with narrow band gap conjugated polymers. The exact structural and/or electronic reasons for this difference, and whether it is a problem intrinsic to molecular systems, remain poorly understood at this stage. Identification of undesirable morphologies coupled to improvements in processing and the availability of modular molecular species that are simple to synthesize are anticipated to further improve device efficiencies so that a proper comparison to solar cells prepared from conjugated polymers can be made.
