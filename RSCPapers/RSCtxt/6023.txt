The strongest electron-donor derivative, 7-tetradecylthieno[3′,2′:7,8]indolizino[6,5,4,3-ija]thieno[2,3-c]quinolone, was copolymerized with electron-deficient thienopyrroledione (TPD), isoindigo (IID), and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives to provide three donor–acceptor conjugated polymers (D–A CPs). Their photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic (PV) properties were investigated. The polymers showed broad UV-vis-NIR absorption bands with λmax values of 612 nm, 698 nm, 788 nm in chloroform and exhibited optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.58 eV, 1.41 eV, 1.24 eV measured as films. Inverted bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) were fabricated using these polymers as host and light-harvesting materials. The device based on P3:PC70BM blends shows the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.23% (Voc = 0.55 V, Jsc = 7.86 mA cm−2, FF = 52%). These promising results demonstrate that π-extended ullazine derivatives can be used as electron-rich building blocks for the construction of D–A CPs for efficient PSCs applications.
1. Introduction
Ullazine and its π-extended derivatives have recently attracted the attention of the organic electronics community due to their planarity and electron-rich character. The chemical modification with various functional groups and addition of electron-deficient moieties on the periphery of ullazine provide promising opto- and electroactive materials with a wide range of electronic properties.1,2 With 16 π-electrons, ullazine is isoelectronic to pyrene, but can also be seen as an aromatic, 14 π-electron annulene (outer ring) with a positively charged nitrogen atom resulting from a mesomeric effect.3 This provides ullazine with the unusual ability to donate electrons while stabilizing the reduced form of the molecule. Ullazine-based molecules have been mostly used as a light-harvesting moiety and electron donor in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and an efficiency as high as 8.45% has been obtained.4 Despite its potential, ullazine has been scarcely used as a building block for organic semiconductors and no example of conjugated polymers incorporating this unit has been reported so far. This might be explained by the difficulty of preparing ullazine derivatives with synthetic handles (Br, I, OTf, B(OR)2, etc.) on the alkene units bridging the pyrrole and the phenyl moieties.
Since the first report on the synthesis of ullazine by Balli and Zeller in 1983,5 several improved methods have been reported, including metal-catalyzed annulation of substituted alkynes,3,5–11 Friedel–Crafts reaction12 and [2+3]-cycloaddition reaction on azomethine ylides.13,14 Using all these methods, several ullazine derivatives have been prepared, but very few π-extended analogs in the lateral axis have been reported.15,16 The [2+3]-cycloaddition on azomethine ylides is the only reported strategy so far to provide fused ullazine derivatives and only phenyl-annulated derivatives have been synthesized.
Herein, we report a metal-free, photochemical strategy for the formation of π-extended ullazine derivatives from chlorinated precursors (Scheme 1). One of the thiophene-fused derivatives, the thieno[3′,2′:7,8]indolizino[6,5,4,3-ija]thieno[2,3-c]quinoline, was copolymerized with different electron-deficient moieties and the resulting D–A conjugated polymers were tested in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of conjugated polymers with π-extended ullazine as a comonomer.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis of ullazine derivatives
Our synthetic approach for the synthesis of π-extended ullazine derivatives involved the photochemical cyclodehydrochlorination (CDHC) reaction as the key step. Our group used this reaction recently for the synthesis of nanographenes17 and graphene nanoribbons.18–20
The synthetic routes for the ullazine derivatives are shown in Scheme 1.
Compound 1 was obtained by iodination at the 2 and 6 positions of 4-tetradecylaniline using iodine monochloride in a mixture of H2O and HCl.21 Then, the formation of the pyrrole was achieved using the Clauson–Kass reaction between compound 1 and 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran in the mixture of AcOH and 1,2-dichloroethane.22 A two-fold borylation reaction using copper iodide (CuI) as the catalyst23 gave compound 3 that was coupled to 2-bromo-3-chloropyridine and 3-bromo-2-chloropyridine using Pd(dppf)Cl2 as the catalyst to give compounds 4 (81%) and 6 (88%), respectively. Likewise, coupling with 2-bromo-3-chlorothiophene and 3-bromo-2-chlorothiophene using PdCl2(PPh3)2 as the catalyst give compounds 8 (89%) and 10 (86%), respectively. It is noteworthy that the conditions had to be optimized for the coupling with thiophene units as those used for the coupling with pyridine failed to provide the desire products. Compounds 4, 6, 8 and 10 were subjected to a photochemical CDHC reaction using conditions that we optimized previously for other substrates:17–20 the chlorinated precursors were dissolved in degassed decahydronaphthalene (decalin) at a concentration of 0.001 M and the solutions were irradiated under UV light (16 × 7.2 W low pressure mercury lamps, λ = 254 nm) at 100 °C for 2 hours under a continuous flow of argon to obtain the photocyclized compounds 5 (96%), 7 (94%), 9 (92%) and 11 (95%) in excellent yield with no formation of side products. These results demonstrate the versatility of the CDHC reaction to link different heterocycles in an intramolecular fashion.
2.2 Optical properties of ullazine derivatives

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the 4 photocyclized compounds. As shown in Fig. 1, all π-extended ullazine derivatives exhibit highly defined vibronic structure as expected for very rigid structure.24 Also, compared with their chlorinated precursors, the absorption peaks are all significantly red-shifted (see ESI,† Fig. S28), which confirms that the photocyclization leads to more conjugated structures. Interestingly, the nature of the heterocycle fused at both ends of the ullazine unit does not have a significant influence on the optical properties of the ullazine as all four derivatives have a band gap value of ca. 2.8 eV (from the onset of the absorption spectra).

2.3 Synthesis of polymers
Since 7-tetradecylthieno[3′,2′:7,8]indolizino[6,5,4,3-ija]thieno[2,3-c]quinoline (compound 11) is the most electron-rich and the most conjugated due to its substitution pattern (fused with the pyrrole unit at the 2 position), we undertook the synthesis of D–A conjugated polymers with this unit and three different acceptors. As the first step, we tried the bromination of compound 11 at the 4 and 10 position (α position relative to the sulfur atom), but all our attempts failed. In all the conditions that we have tested, a significant amount of side products, mostly polybrominated compounds, were formed. Decreasing the reaction temperature or adding the bromination agent portion-wise did not improve the yield. Thus, we changed our strategy and synthesized compound 12 that allow the use of Stille coupling with different dibrominated electron-accepting monomers. As shown in Scheme 2, compound 12 was obtained in 90% yield by adding n-BuLi in THF at −78 °C and making the stannylation with tributylchlorostannane.25 Compound 12 was then copolymerized with three commonly used acceptor monomers, namely 1,3-dibromo-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD), (E)-6,6′-dibromo-1,1′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-[3,3′-biindolinylidene]-2,2′-dione (IID), 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP)26–28 by a palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction29 to afford the three D–A polymers P1, P2 and P3 in 90, 92 and 89% yield, respectively.

Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using polystyrene as standard was performed and the results are presented in Table 1.  values ranging from 12500 and 21400 g mol−1 were obtained, corresponding to degrees of polymerization between 14 and 16. The thermal properties of P1, P2 and P3 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S36 and S37, ESI†). The TGA analysis was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The polymers showed no degradation up to 425 °C for P1 and P3, and 350 °C for P2, meaning that the π-extended ullazine moiety, despite its electron donating character, is quite robust. DSC studies were also performed to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymers. The samples were heated up to 250 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. Unfortunately, the amplitude of the Tg transitions were too weak to measure values reliably while no melting peaks have been observed. This suggests that all three polymers are amorphous, which can be explained by the presence of long, branched lateral alkyl chains.

2.4 Optical properties of the polymers
The optical properties of the three polymers were investigated both in solution and as thin films by UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The corresponding photophysical parameters are summarized in Table 2. All the polymers showed broad absorption bands in the UV-vis region or the NIR region, matching well with the solar emission spectrum. Each polymer exhibits two characteristic absorption bands with a high-energy band peak at around 400 nm and a low-energy band peak at 612 nm, 698 nm and 788 nm for P1, P2 and P3, respectively (Fig. 2). The high-energy absorption bands come from the π–π* transitions of the donor and acceptor units,30 while the low-energy absorption bands can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units in the backbone.31 Compared to the spectra in the solution state, all the spectra in the solid state were only slightly broadened and red-shifted (5–8 nm) (Fig. 2), which indicates that the polymers have a very similar conformation in both solution and solid states. This behavior is typical of planar polymers with thiophene moiety as the linking unit.32 The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) estimated from the edges of the absorption spectra in the thin films are 1.58 eV, 1.41 eV and 1.24 eV for P1, P2 and P3, respectively (Table 2). Interestingly, the λmax values are larger and the bandgap values lower than most of the D–A copolymers prepared with the same acceptors,26–28 proving that 7-tetradecylthieno[3′,2′:7,8]indolizino[6,5,4,3-ija]thieno[2,3-c]quinoline (compound 11) is very electron-rich.

2.5 Electrochemical properties
Thin-film cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to investigate the electrochemical properties and estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the three polymers. As shown in Fig. S31–S33 (ESI†), the polymers exhibited quasi-reversible processes both in the oxidative and reductive scans. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated from the oxidation and reduction onset potential,33 respectively, and the results are summarized in Table 2.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.08 and −3.49 eV for P1, −4.98 and −3.58 eV for P2, and −4.97 to −3.59 eV for P3. Correspondingly, the electrochemical bandgap values (Eelecg) were calculated to be 1.59, 1.40 and 1.38 eV for P1, P2 and P3, which are in good agreement with the optical bandgap values. All the polymers showed quite narrow bandgap, which corresponds to near ideal bandgap for solar cells applications.34
In addition, the LUMO energy levels of these polymers are around −3.5 eV, which is suitable for the electron to transfer from the polymer donors to the acceptor PC70BM or PC60BM (∼−4.0 eV, see Fig. 3a for the energy level diagram of the organic solar cell device constructed in this work).32

2.6 Organic photovoltaics properties
The photovoltaic properties of P1, P2, P3 as donor materials were investigated in devices with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PEI/Active layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 3a). Several common acceptors (PC60BM, PC70BM, ITIC) were chosen to evaluate the viability of ullazine moiety in organic solar cells active layer. For the preliminary tests, the three polymers were tested with PC60BM as the acceptor with or without diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive. The J–V curves of the best device for each polymer are shown in Fig. 3b and Table 3 summarizes the device parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency values (PCE). Notably, the first cells show quite low efficiencies for P1 and P2 (respectively 0.36% and 0.26%) and higher value for P3 (1.31%). As expected, these polymers yielded approximately the same Voc (∼0.55 V, estimated from the difference between the HOMO level of the donor material and the LUMO level of the acceptor material) due to the similar energy of their HOMO levels.

The morphology of polymer:PC60BM blend films was investigated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM topographic and phase images are shown in Fig. S34 (ESI†). When the polymer blends were processed without additives, the film morphology show aggregated domains especially in the P2 blend where the nanodomains diameters span from 160 nm to 330 nm. This type of segregation lead to poor current density by an increasing rate of exciton recombination and can explain the poor performances obtained with these blend solutions.35 As a consequence, we use DIO as a processing additive which should help to solubilize the fullerene derivatives in the processing solution and enhance the overall efficiency.36 The resulting film shows a clear improvement of the segregation phase in the active layer for the three polymer blends leading to a better organization between the donor and the acceptor materials. These improved morphologies lead to better efficiency but stay non-optimal for high efficiency solar cells.
To pursue our investigations, we focused on the polymer P3 and changed the classical PC60BM for another fullerene derivative (PC70BM) and a non-fullerene acceptors (ITIC), that shows better optical absorption properties.37,38 Notably, the most efficient device was obtained with P3 and PC70BM, which showed a PCE of 2.23% with Voc of 0.55 V, Jsc of 7.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 52% (Fig. 3c). We also perform AFM measurements on P3:PC70BM for comparison with P3:PC70BM + DIO blend shown in Fig. 4. Without additives, nanodomains from 160 nm to 430 nm were observed along with a rough surface of the film (root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 9.62 nm) leading not only for poor exciton dissociation but also to rough surface decreasing the interface contact with other layers. The addition of DIO strongly influences the blend morphology by suppressing the phase segregation and smoothing the surface roughness to 1.52 nm (RMS) leading to the best efficiency observed for P3 devices.

The ITIC-based device also shows a promising 0.96% PCE with a higher Voc (0.60 V) than PCBM-based devices, which can be ascribed to a higher LUMO level of the acceptor (−3.83 eV vs. −4.0 eV) and a homogenous morphology observed with AFM (see Fig. S35, ESI†). Further device optimizations are needed to improve the photovoltaic performances of this series of polymers.
3. Conclusions
In this work, we showed the efficiency and versatility of the photochemical CDHC reaction in synthesizing several π-extended ullazine derivatives containing electron-rich or electron-poor heterocycles. We developed a novel electron donor compound with one pyrrole and two thiophene rings, the 7-tetradecylthieno[3′,2′:7,8]indolizino[6,5,4,3-ija]thieno[2,3-c]quinoline, which was successfully employed in the preparation of a series of D–A conjugated polymers whose optical and electrochemical properties were fully investigated. The D–A polymers exhibited strong and broad UV-vis-NIR absorption bands and quite narrow bandgaps (1.24 to 1.58 eV, with the HOMO levels −4.97 to −5.08 eV and LUMO levels −3.49 to −3.59 eV), demonstrating the strong electron-donor property of the ullazine-based monomer. To test the solar cell performances of these polymers, BHJ-PSCs were fabricated using these polymers as host materials and PCE values as high as 2.23% (Voc = 0.55 V, Jsc = 7.86 mA cm−2, FF = 52%) were obtained with PC70BM as the acceptor without any optimization.
4. Experimental
4.1 General methods and apparatus
Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Canada, Alfa Aesar Co., TCI America Co. or Oakwood Products Inc. and used as received. Solvents used for organic synthesis were purchased from Fisher Chemical Co., EMD Millipore Co. and CFS Chemical Co. as HPLC grade. These solvents were degassed, dried and purified with a Solvent Purifier System (SPS) (Vacuum Atmosphere Co., Hawthorne, USA). Anhydrous decahydronaphthalene (mixture of cis + trans) was used as received for photochemical reactions and other anhydrous solvents were bought from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Canada. All anhydrous and air sensitive reactions were performed in oven-dried glassware purchased from Synthware™ under positive nitrogen stream. Analytical thin-layer chromatographies were performed with silica gel 60 F254, 0.25 mm pre-coated TLC plates (Silicycle, Québec, Canada). Compounds were revealed by a 254 nm and/or 365 nm UV wavelength and/or aqueous K2CO3 and NaOH solution of potassium permanganate. Flash column chromatographies were performed with 230–400 mesh silica gel R10030B (Silicycle, Québec, Canada). 1,3-Dibromo-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD) was synthesized according to literature procedures.39,40 (E)-6,6′-dibromo-1,1′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-[3,3′-biindolinylidene]-2,2′-dione (IID) was synthesized according to literature procedures.41 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4 dione (DPP) was synthesized according to literature procedures.42 Photochemical reactions were performed in a CCP-ICH2 Luzchem® photochemical reactor equipped with a thermostat and a heating mantle. Photochemical reactions were performed in a 100 mL quartz round-bottom flask bought from Chemglass®. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova AS400 spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, USA) at 400 MHz (1H) and 100 MHz (13C). Chemical shifts were reported as values (ppm) relative to residual solvent peak. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded with an Agilent 6210 Time-of-Flight (TOF) LC-MS apparatus equipped with an APPI ion source (Agilent Technologies, Toronto, Canada). Number-average () and weight-average () molecular weights were determined by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Varian Polymer Laboratories GPC220 equipped with an RI detector and a PL BV400 HT Bridge Viscometer. The column set consists of 2 PL gel Mixed C (300 × 7.5 mm) columns and a PL gel Mixed C guard column. The flow rate was fixed at 1 mL min−1 using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) (with 0.0125% BHT w/v) as the eluent. The temperature of the system was set to 110 °C. All the samples were prepared at a nominal concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 in TCB. Dissolution was performed using a Varian Polymer Laboratories PL-SP 260VC sample preparation system. The sample vials were held at 110 °C with shaking for 1 h for complete dissolution. The solutions were filtered through a 2 mm porous stainless steel filter used with a 0.40 μm glass filter into a 2 mL chromatography vial. The calibration method used to generate the reported data was the classical polystyrene method using polystyrene narrow standards Easi-Vials PS-M from Varian Polymer Laboratories which were dissolved in TCB. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 500 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer using 1 cm path length quartz cells. For solid state measurements, the polymer solution (1.0 mg mL−1 in chloroform) was spin coated on glass plates. Optical bandgaps were calculated from the onset of the absorption band. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) were recorded on a Solartron 1287 potentiostat using platinum wires as the working electrode and counter electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The reference electrode was Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile) in an anhydrous and argon-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in dry acetonitrile. Under these conditions, the oxidation potential of ferrocene was 0.09 V versus Ag/Ag+, whereas the oxidation potential of ferrocene was 0.41 V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined from the oxidation and reduction onsets (where the current starts to differ from the baseline) from the cyclic voltammogram assuming that the SCE is −4.71 eV in vacuum, as reported in the literature.43
4.2 Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
Inverted BHJ solar cells were prepared on a commercial ITO coated glass substrate. The substrates were cleaned sequentially in ultrasonic baths with clean room detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. Prior to the fabrication, the ITO glass substrates were treated in a plasma-oxygen chamber (Spacemaker II sensor, Plasmatic Systems, Inc, USA) for 5 min. First, a 20–30 nm ZnO thin film was made by spin coating a ZnO precursor solution (250 mg of zinc acetate, 69.0 μL of ethanolamine, and 2.91 mL of 2-methoxyethanol) onto the ITO glass at 5000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 250 °C on a hot plate in air for 1 h. Then, a 0.05 wt % polyethylenimine (PEI) in 2-methoxyethanol solution was spin-coated onto the ZnO layer and dried at 110 °C on a hot plate in air for 10 min. The blend solution was spin-coated over the ZnO layer and then dried at 130 °C for 90 s to make the active layer. All the blend solutions were prepared by dissolving the polymers (10 mg mL−1) and PC60BM (10 mg mL−1) or PC70BM (10 mg mL−1) or ITIC (10 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene and stirring the mixtures on a hot plate in air at 60 °C overnight. Finally, MoO3 (8 nm) and Ag anode (100 nm) were sequentially vacuum-deposited onto the active layer through a shadow mask on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (1 × 10−7 Torr). Current versus potential curves (J–V characteristics) were measured with a Keithley 2400 Digital Source Meter under a collimated beam. Illumination of the cells was done through the ITO side using light from a 150 W Oriel Instruments Solar Simulator (model 16S, Solar Light Co., Philadelphia, PA) and a 200 W xenon Lamp Power Supply (Model XPS 200, Solar Light Co., Philadelphia, PA) with an AM 1.5G filter to provide an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by NREL certified Si photodiode (Model 1787-04, Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Japan) and a HP4155A semiconductor parameter analyzer (Yokogawa Hewlett-Packard, Japan).
4.3 Materials synthesis

2,6-Diiodo-4-tetradecylaniline (1). 
To a solution of 37% w/w aq. HCl (24.0 mL, 0.430 M) and water (173 mL, 0.0600 M) in a round-bottom flask was added 4-tetradecylaniline (3.00 g, 10.4 mmol) at room temperature all at once.

The chloroform fractions were precipitated again in methanol and the precipitates were filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon filter and thoroughly dried under vacuum to obtain polymer P1 ( = 12.5 kg mol−1,  = 22.5 kg mol−1, Đ = 1.8) as a dark blue solid (0.146 g, 90%), polymer P2 ( = 16.8 kg mol−1,  = 47.0 kg mol−1, Đ = 2.8) as a dark green solid (0.206 g, 92%) and P3 ( = 21.4 kg mol−1,  = 55.6 kg mol−1, Đ = 2.6) as a dark green solid (0.224 g, 89%).
