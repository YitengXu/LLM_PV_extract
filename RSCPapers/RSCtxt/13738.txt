    , Accepted 13th December 2013First published on 16th December 2013AbstractPolyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane functionalized with eight imidazolium iodide arms has been designed and synthesized for use as solid-state electrolytes in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, which exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 7.11% under one sun illumination and good long-term stability under one sun soaking.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are becoming more and more attractive because of their potential low cost, high power conversion efficiency, easy fabrication, and environmental friendliness.1 A typical DSSC consists of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline semiconductor electrode, a redox electrolyte, and a counter electrode. The most commonly used electrolyte in high-performance DSSCs is iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) dissolved in a volatile organic solvent.2 However, the leakage or volatilization of the liquid solvent in the electrolyte significantly deteriorates the long-term stability of the DSSCs. Thus, it is necessary to develop all-solid-state electrolytes to replace the liquid electrolytes.3 Recently, we reported solid imidazolium-based ionic conductors for use in solid state DSSCs (ssDSSCs), which exhibited good photovoltaic performance.4 However, the wettability of solid electrolytes on the TiO2 surface is a big problem limiting the performance of solar cells. Therefore, a crystal growth inhibitor should be added into the electrolyte to improve the interfacial contact between solid electrolytes and TiO2 towards better photovoltaic performance.4 Therefore, synthesis of new solid electrolytes with good wettability on TiO2 is of significance to achieve good performance.
Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) was discovered in 1946 by Scott.5 In consideration of its unique three-dimensional cage structure composed of Si–O bonds (Fig. 1), different functional groups could be easily attached to POSS to expand its properties. In this communication, eight ester-propyl-substituted imidazolium iodide4 (EsPImI, Fig. S1, ESI†) arms were linked to POSS, forming POSS-8EsPImI. POSS has good wettability on the TiO2 surface due to the presence of Si–O bonds, which is favourable for good pore filling of TiO2 with this POSS based solid electrolyte. The linked imidazolium iodides act as an iodide source for efficient dye regeneration. When POSS-8EsPImI was mixed with an appropriate amount of I2, LiI and 1-methylbenziimidazole (NMBI, solid) as the solid electrolyte, the ssDSSC produced a power conversion efficiency of 7.11% in combination with an organic dye (Fig. S2, ESI†).6

The synthesis of POSS-8EsPImI (Fig. 1 and Scheme S1, ESI†) is detailed in the ESI.† The structure of POSS-8EsPImI was confirmed by 1H, 13C, 29Si NMR and HRMS (Fig. S3, ESI†) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy (Fig. S4, ESI†). The IR band of the trisilanol silsesquioxane cage appears at 1118 cm−1 which is accompanied by CH3 stretching (2951 cm−1) and the corresponding deformational mode (1234 cm−1).7 The IR band at 1752 cm−1 is attributed to CO in the ester group. The band at 1561 cm−1 is assigned to the CC stretching in the imidazolium ring, while the bands at 3143 and 3082 cm−1 are attributed to C–H stretching in the imidazolium ring.8 The decomposition temperature of POSS-8EsPImI is determined to be 120 °C by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S5a, ESI†). POSS-8EsPImI is amorphous as revealed by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve (Fig. S5b, ESI†), where glass transition takes place in the range of 52 °C. This feature avoids crystallization of the ionic conductor during electrolyte injection followed by drying and facilitates pore filling of TiO2 with the solid electrolyte. The pore filling and interfacial contact between the solid electrolyte and TiO2 are expected to improve owing to the amorphous nature and the presence of Si–O bonds.
The conductivity of the solid electrolyte, which is crucial to the performance of ssDSSCs, was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. S6, ESI†). The conductivity of POSS-8EsPImI was 0.061 mS cm−1, which was enhanced significantly to 0.17 mS cm−1 upon doping iodine to POSS-8EsPImI (molar ratio, POSS-8EsPImI/I2 = 1.5/1). This remarkable increase in ionic conductivity originates from the formation of polyiodides such as I3− ions by means of a reaction between iodide and iodine. The formation of polyiodides facilitates the charge transfer along the polyiodide chain by the Grotthus-type exchange mechanism, which is the major reason for the remarkable enhancement of conductivity.9 Introduction of LiI to the above mixture (molar ratio, POSS-8EsPImI/I2/LiI = 1.5/1/3) further increased the conductivity to 0.78 mS cm−1. This is attributed to the increased concentration of iodide and Li+ ions. The conductivity of 8EsPImI/I2/LiI was 0.77 mS cm−1, comparable to that of POSS-8EsPImI/I2/LiI. This suggests that linking EsPImI to POSS hardly influenced the conductivity of the ionic liquid. When NMBI, which like 4-tertbutylpyridine is a useful additive in electrolytes for voltage enhancement,10 was added to the above electrolyte mixture (molar ratio, POSS-8EsPImI/I2/LiI/NMBI = 1.5/1/3/10), the conductivity changed negligibly as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It should be noted that the above-mentioned molar ratios in the solid electrolyte were determined by optimizing the solar cell performance.
The ssDSSCs based on the solid electrolytes with various compositions were tested under illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2). For the POSS-8EsPImI/I2 electrolyte (molar ratio, 1.5/1), the DSSC produced a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 11.08 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.60 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.62, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (η) of 4.12% (Fig. 2a). The η was improved to 5.81% (Jsc = 15.63 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.63 V, FF = 0.59) using the POSS-8EsPImI/I2/LiI solid electrolyte (molar ratio, 1.5/1/3), as shown in Fig. 2a. The increase in η is mainly attributed to the enhancement of Jsc because of the positive shift of the conduction band edge of TiO2 caused by the adsorption of Li+ ions on the TiO2 surface11 and the increased conductivity as well. When NMBI was added to the above electrolyte (the molar ratio of POSS-8EsPImI/I2/LiI/NMBI was 1.5/1/3/10), Voc increased to 0.74 V but Jsc decreased to 14.12 mA cm−2. The observed increase in Voc and decrease in Jsc are likely attributed to the negative shift of the conduction band edge of TiO2 caused by the basic NMBI.10 As a result, the η was improved to 7.11%. Fig. 2b displays the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength. The IPCE values in the visible spectral range were the lowest for POSS-8EsPImI/I2 among the three electrolytes. The IPCE increased significantly upon addition of LiI to POSS-8EsPImI/I2, which decreased to some extent upon further addition of NMBI. The IPCE order is the same as that of Jsc.

The filling of pores in TiO2 films with solid electrolytes is crucial to achieve good performance. Fig. 3 shows the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images of TiO2 films before and after solid electrolyte filling. The surface of bare TiO2 films is porous, which becomes non-porous and smooth when the solid electrolyte is filled in the film. This indicates that the pores in TiO2 are filled with the solid electrolyte very well, which accounts for the good photocurrent and efficiency. However, for the solid ionic liquid (EsPImI, Fig. S1, ESI†) that is not linked to the POSS, pore filling is not good due to the serious ionic crystallization (Fig. S7, ESI†). For this reason, EsPImI only produces an η of 2.07% without addition of the crystal growth inhibitor and produces an efficiency of 3.81% with a small amount of the crystal growth inhibitor. Despite the comparable conductivity, the solid electrolyte based on POSS-8EsPImI yields much higher efficiency than the corresponding solid electrolyte based on EsPImI without or with the crystal growth inhibitor. It is evident that the combination of POSS and ionic liquid can improve the photovoltaic performance remarkably.

The performance of the ssDSSC was recorded over a period of 1000 h under one sun soaking using an unoptimizable cell (Fig. 4). Jsc, Voc, FF and η remained almost constant during light soaking, suggesting that this ssDSSC shows long-term stability.

In summary, novel ionic liquid functionalized POSS has been designed and synthesized for use in ssDSSCs, which have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 7.11% and good long-term stability under one sun soaking. The combination of POSS with imidazolium iodides improves the pore filling of TiO2 and facilitates interfacial contact between solid electrolytes and TiO2, resulting in good photovoltaic performance. Improvement of efficiency can be expected by further structural modification of POSS and choice of a better dye.
