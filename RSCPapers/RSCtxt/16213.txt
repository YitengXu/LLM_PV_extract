    , Accepted 28th September 2018First published on 22nd October 2018AbstractIn this work, we demonstrate all-polymer solar cells where all the layers are made from polymers. We use PEDOT:PSS as the semitransparent anode and polyethyleneimine modified PEDOT:PSS as the semi-transparent cathode, both of which are slot-die printed on polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Active layers are deposited on the cathode and anode surfaces by spin coating separately. These layers are then joined through a roll-to-roll compatible lamination process. This results in a semitransparent and flexible solar cell. We have used two polymer–polymer systems and several combinations, and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) obtained is 2.3% with a mean transparency > 35% within the visible light range. By laminating a thin layer acceptor polymer to a thick polymer–polymer blend, we can improve the performance by reducing recombination, compared to laminating blend to blend, which is verified by the trap-limited charge transport, CELIV and electroluminescence.
1 Introduction
Rapidly growing energy consumption worldwide forces the search for green and sustainable replacements for current fossil-based energy sources. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) have attracted the attention of scientists due to their advantages of being inexpensive, lightweight, flexible and suitable for roll-to-roll production. As a result of numerous improvements in device structure and novel materials design by the organic photovoltaics community, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the lab has now reached 12–14%.1–3 OPV are clearly not yet comparable with silicon solar cells in terms of PCE, but instead are more attractive because of their flexibility, low weight and semitransparency.
In recent years, considerable attention has been focused on new acceptor materials, either polymers or small molecules, to replace the once dominating fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).4,5 There are obvious disadvantages of using fullerene derivatives as the acceptor, such as thermal instability, weak absorption in the visible light range, poorly tunable energy levels and high cost. Therefore, great efforts have been made to develop novel alternative acceptors with more morphological stability, more absorption and more desired energy levels. Among these non-fullerene acceptors, a number of polymeric acceptors have been reported which increase the PCE of all polymer solar cells to 9–10%.6–13 What is even more interesting is that many groups have reported the printability of non-fullerene solar cells, i.e., using blade coating or spray coating to get the same or higher PCE compared to spin coating, implying that there is great potential for large area production in the future.14–19 However, some of them still use vacuum-based processing, usually to fabricate Al or Ag electrodes, and some of them use indium tin oxide (ITO) with the rare and expensive element indium, which could limit the large scale production of OPV. To meet the basic requirements for roll-to-roll printing so that all the layers of OPV can be printed, high conductivity PEDOT:PSS has proved to be a good alternative as a semitransparent electrode, and serves not only as a charge carrier collector but also as a hole selective layer because of its high work function.19–21 By tuning the work function of PEDOT:PSS using another layer, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) or polyethyleneimine (PEI), it can also work as a cathode. However, the wet deposition of the top PEDOT:PSS layer on the active layer allows the wet PEDOT solution to penetrate to the bottom through defects in the printed layer, which may result in short-circuiting due to direct contact with the bottom electrodes. We have developed a lamination method to avoid this problem.22 By laminating the two electrodes, both with the active layer on top, we can build well-performing semitransparent solar cells on flexible substrates. This lamination process also provides us with more possibilities for the design of the active layer, since the two active layers on the cathode or anode side may be different and could be a blend or a pure donor or acceptor, which also enables us to optimize the device performance and study the lamination process in terms of morphology and electrical properties. Here we report all-polymer semitransparent solar cells fabricated through lamination, in which all the layers including the substrates are polymers, with the structure PET/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PEI/PEDOT:PSS/PET. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully polymeric solar cell ever reported.
2 Results and discussion
The PEDOT:PSS electrodes and PEI are all printed in air on PET, and the active layers are spin-coated in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. The lamination was done in an ambient atmosphere after the spin coating of the active layers. Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the lamination process. Fig. 1b gives the molecular structure of the polymer used in this study and Fig. 1c shows the absorbance of the pure polymer in the films. We chose an NDI based polymer named PNDI-T10 as the acceptor,6 and two commonly used donor polymers TQ1 (ref. 23) and PTB7-Th.24 Since we can deposit different layers on the cathode and anode side, we have combined different bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) and pure polymers to make semitransparent solar cells, as shown in Table 1. The highest PCE we achieved is 2.3% from the PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 system, which is half of that achieved in normal structured devices with metallic reflectors (ITO/PEDOT/active layer/LiF/Al), as shown in Table S2.† Compared to that of previously reported semitransparent flexible organic solar cells,14,25–27 all of which have either ITO or Ag nanowires as the electrodes and ZnO or MoO3 as the interlayers, the PCE is relatively low. One reason is that the choice of active layer material is quite limited for polymer–polymer blends, and the device performance highly depends on the quality of materials. Another reason is our use of semitransparent electrodes with only PEDOT:PSS and PEI. As electrodes, they are not competitive compared to the typical evaporated ones, but PEDOT:PSS is still one of the most practical and low-cost candidates for electrodes so far for roll-to-roll printed organic solar cells.

Among these different combinations, the bilayer one shows the lowest short circuit current (Jsc) and highest FF, as expected. The high FF in bilayer devices is because of the much smaller recombination in the pure polymer phases, due to low minority carrier density. The Jsc achieved in bilayer devices, which is almost one quarter of the Jsc of the blend devices, implies the presence of mixed phases at the lamination interface, which proves that lamination can assemble different materials together, not only mechanically but also electrically, at sufficient pressure and temperature. The well-performing ternary heterojunction PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10/TQ1:PNDI-T10 devices further confirm this, since the holes need to pass over the TQ1 phase to the PTB7-Th phase to be collected at the anode.
When we compared the BHJ/BHJ devices to the BHJ/PNDI-T10 devices, we found that the BHJ/PNDI-T10 devices show a higher Jsc and a slightly higher PCE. We made the total thickness of the active layer for BHJ/BHJ devices the same as for BHJ/PNDI-T10 devices, by applying half thickness of active layer on each side when preparing BHJ/BHJ devices. But we also want to clarify that the thickness was measured for the spin-coated films on glass and might not be identical to the thickness of similar spin-coated films on PEDOT:PSS. For the BHJ/PNDI-T10 junction, PNDI-T10 was only 4 nm thick and contributed little current, especially when the light comes from the anode side. The photocurrent (light current–dark current) plots (Fig. 2a and b) show very clearly that in BHJ/BHJ devices, more carriers can be extracted under high reverse bias, but due to the stronger field dependence of extraction, the Jsc is smaller than that for the BHJ/PNDI-T10 devices. Even though the initial thickness is the same for the active layers, or even thicker due to adding the 4 nm thick PNDI-T10, the two different preparation methods seem to result in different interfacial area. Furthermore, the injection current in the first quadrant shows worse selectivity in the BHJ/BHJ devices; as for the ideal selective electrode there should be no injected current under forward bias.28 This behaviour is expected since the addition of PNDI-T10 improves the selectivity at the cathode. The stronger field dependence of extraction in the third quadrant also implies different charge generation and/or recombination mechanisms.
 Fig. 2  (a) and (b) Photocurrent of the devices with BHJ/BHJ and BHJ/PNDI-T10. (c) and (d) EQE data. The Jsc calculated from the EQE data does not agree with the Jsc determined from the I–V curves, probably due to strongly suppressed bimolecular recombination under low intensity light from a monochromator. As shown in light intensity dependence measurements, the current is the same for both BHJ/BHJ and BHJ/PNDI-T10 devices under 0.01 sun. (e) and (f) corrected IQE data of the active layers calculated by subtracting the absorption of the PEDOT electrodes from the total absorption of the devices. 
To determine how these improvements came about, we first measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and absorptance, as shown in Fig. 2c, d and S2 in the ESI.† The absorptance of the devices was calculated from the transmittance and reflectance as (100% − R − T). The stronger absorption agrees with the higher photocurrent at a high reverse voltage for the BHJ/BHJ devices. If we subtract the absorption of the PEDOT electrodes from the total absorption of the devices, and neglect the very small contribution of reflections inside the device, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the active layer can be calculated, and is shown in Fig. 2e and f. For both systems, BHJ/PDNI-T10 has a higher IQE than BHJ/BHJ, indicating more recombination loss in the BHJ/BHJ devices.
To study the recombination, the light intensity dependence of Jsc and Voc was measured and presented in Fig. 3. The Jsc shows a power law dependence on light intensity, J ∝ Plightα, and the deviation of α from 1 can be due to severe bimolecular recombination or the space charge effect.29,30 The fitted α is the same for the PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 system, around 0.95. However, the α in TQ1:PNDI-T10 BHJ/BHJ devices is smaller than that in TQ1:PNDI-T10 BHJ/PNDI-T10 devices, decreasing from 0.98 to 0.90. As for the Vocvs. light intensity plots, the slopes for both TQ1:PNDI-T10 and PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 systems seem close to 1kT/q if we fitted a straight line through the whole range (Fig. S3, ESI†), but transitions are observed where the slope changes. The data can be roughly separated into several sections, with slopes for each section fitted and depicted. Except at a high Voc range, the slopes are all close to one, indicating minimal trap-assisted recombination. Kirchartz has studied the light intensity dependence of Voc and proposed that by analyzing the slopes as a function of Voc, a more detailed interpretation of the data can be given.31 Under different Voc ranges, the dominant recombination mechanism might vary and thus gives different slopes, with a slope of one for bimolecular and a slope of two for trap-assisted recombination. When the Voc gets close to Vbi, the dominating surface recombination would make the slope approach 1, or even lower than 1.32,33 The reason is that as Voc gets closer to Vbi, the minority carrier density close to the contacts increases with the illumination intensity, but because of the reduced selectivity due to the low internal electric field, it would contribute less to Voc.34 The same reasoning also applies to trap-assisted recombination if it mainly occurs close to the contacts, which makes it Voc-dependent as well. From the slope-fitting, trap-assisted recombination, which probably occurs close to the contacts rather than within the bulk, is observed in the two TQ1 samples and PTB7-Th BHJ/BHJ samples (Fig. 3b and d), and in the PTB7-Th BHJ/PNDI-T10 sample, the surface recombination is pronounced. Trap-assisted recombination can also be evidenced through electroluminescence measurements (Fig. S5, ESI†). The existence of trap-assisted non-radiative recombination would make the EL-EQE carrier density dependent and thus bias dependent. The reason is that bimolecular recombination has quadratic density dependence, but trap-assisted recombination has linear density dependence, and if these two mechanisms are both present and competing, the bimolecular recombination would become more important when more carriers are injected.35 The BHJ/BHJ EQE EL has a steeper slope, indicative of more trap-assisted recombination. In TQ1:PNDI-T10 samples, BHJ/PNDI-T10 and BHJ/BHJ exhibit minor differences and eventually the same value was obtained, indicating that trap-assisted recombination is overwhelmed by bimolecular recombination at a high carrier density.
 Fig. 3  Light intensity dependence measurements. (a) and (b) are for PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 and (c) and (d) are for TQ1:PNDI-T10. 
The contact selectivity in both TQ1 and PTB7-Th systems is poor, as observed in Fig. 2a and b, and surface recombination is also expected to contribute to this. However, the contribution from surface recombination is overwhelmed by that from trap-assisted recombination, resulting in a >1kT/q slope, for both TQ1 devices and the PTB7-Th BHJ/BHJ device. Since the slope represents the sum intensity of these two recombination mechanisms which have opposite effects on slope values, we cannot conclude which device has more trap-assisted recombination just by comparing their slopes if we don't know the surface recombination rate of each device. It should also be noted that both trap-assisted and surface recombination mostly occur close to the wrong contact (cathode for holes and anode for electrons) and is thus highly affected by the field and mobility in the device.
Transport measurements of single carrier devices help to further explore the traps. Using PEDOT:PSS (for holes) and PEDOT:PSS/PEI (for electrons) as the electrodes, single carrier devices were prepared and tested, and we managed to fit the mobilities for both systems using eqn (1). (1)where μ is the mobility, γ is the field-dependence prefactor, L is the thickness, k is the Boltzmann constant, and Vbi is the built-in potential. The results are found in Table S2.†
For electron transport in the TQ1:PNDI-T10 system, we can observe many more traps in the BHJ/BHJ configuration, as evidenced by the much lower current and the much higher transition voltage above which the J–V curves observed in slope 2 region in the log–log plot, as shown in Fig. 4. The traps have either Gaussian or exponential distribution according to the drift and diffusion model proposed by P. W. M. Blom,36 with a slope > 2 under lower bias eventually reaching a slope of 2, when all the traps are filled under higher bias towards trap-free space charge limited current (SCLC).

Unlike the TQ1:PNDI-T10 BHJ/BHJ samples, the BHJ/PNDI-T10 samples show almost trap-free SCLC features at low bias, and the fitted electron mobility is 4.9 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. For TQ1 BHJ/BHJ devices, the fitted mobility with fully filled traps is 1.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. Under operational conditions, this electron mobility is expected to be much lower and to cause imbalanced mobility of electrons and holes in BHJ/BHJ devices. Imbalanced mobility together with trapped charges causes space charge effects and can be responsible for α < 1. For the TQ1:PNDI-T10 system, the smaller α in BHJ/BHJ devices can explain the field dependence of charge extraction since either space charge effects or severe bimolecular recombination would lead to it.37,38 The PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 systems show similar trends for electron-only transport; more traps are found in the BHJ/BHJ samples.
From previous observations of the light intensity dependence of Voc, we have suspected that there are traps located close to contact interfaces, in this case the cathode contact. To find out if these traps were introduced by PEI, another configuration of electron-only samples was prepared, by laminating PEDOT:PSS/PEI directly to 90 nm TQ1:PNDI-T10 BHJ films on PEI/PEDOT:PSS. It turned out that they can only be laminated under a much higher pressure. The interface between the BHJ and PEI seems electrically comparable with that formed by spin-coating BHJ/BHJ on PEI, but still similar trap features were observed in this device. Therefore, the thin PNDI-T10 layer may passivate the PEI surface and reduce the trap-assisted recombination. More trap-assisted recombination also agrees with the observed severely asymmetric photocurrent in BHJ/BHJ devices, as shown in Table S1,† since when light comes from the PEI side, more free carriers would be generated close to the cathode side, with more recombination leading to less photocurrent.
Hole-only samples were also prepared using PEDOT:PSS as the electrodes for TQ1:PNDI-T10. For the BHJ/BHJ samples, no strong clues for traps were observed, and the fitted mobility is 4.2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, as shown in Fig. S3.† BHJ/PEDOT:PSS samples were also prepared, which underwent high pressure treatment to make sure that the lamination of BHJ to PEDOT:PSS occurred. These samples show different features as there are fewer traps in the BHJ/PEDOT samples than in BHJ/BHJ. The fitted mobility is 3.2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, on the assumption that the thickness is not changed. Because of the complexity and uncertainty, we did not measure the hole mobility for the PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 system.
More solid evidence of the poor hole selectivity is confirmed by the higher hole surface recombination rate characterized by charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV), in a novel method developed by Österbacka et al.39,40 For an electron transport interlayer, with a higher hole surface recombination velocity, lower hole blocking ability is expected. If the surface recombination velocity SR is much smaller than the transport velocity (υd = μE) in the active layer, carriers would accumulate at the interface and the steady state dark current would be determined using JD = qSRps, where ps is the carrier (hole) density at the interface. With ps as the boundary condition, by solving the Poisson equation and continuity equation, a relationship between the total charge Q in the active layer and SR is obtained, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and ε is the permittivity. (2)
The total charges are ready to be fully extracted using CELIV when there is little recombination loss in the active layer, like in hole-only devices consisting of pure donor material. Therefore, we made two different structures, A: PEDOT/TQ1(600 nm)/PEI/PEDOT and B: PEDOT/TQ1(900 nm)/PNDI-T10(4 nm)/PEI/PEDOT using lamination.
The thickness is estimated by the displacement current, with ε = 3.3. When V > Vbi (work function difference between the anode and cathode), holes can be injected from the PEDOT anode side and then collected at the PEI/PEDOT cathode side. The bulk transport would be the same for both structures but with different surface recombination velocities. Fig. 5 shows the transient current J(t) at different V. J(t) contains two parts: one is the displacement current J0 due to the changing voltage and the other is the extraction current of the excess charges Q.
 Fig. 5  Schematic of the CELIV technique is shown. J(t) has been corrected for the steady state current JD and total charges could be obtained using  where  and d is the thickness of the active layer. For all the different V values, ramping rate of the voltage is the same. The JD for structure B is 0.033 and 0.18 A m−2 at V = 0.7 V and V = 1.1 V. JD of structure A is 0.065, 0.097 and 0.148 A m−2 for V = 1.1 V, V = 1.3 V and V = 1.5 V. With different voltages, the injection current varies a lot, thus the accumulated charges will vary. 
With a higher injection current, more excess charges would be present in devices if the surface recombination velocity is the limiting factor rather than the bulk transport velocity. For structure B, the extracted Q is 1.5 and 3.7 C m−2, and SR ∼ 0.022 cm s−1 as calculated using eqn (2). There are also chances of electrons being injected from the PEI side in both structure A and B, but in structure A the electron injection would be much less favorable due to the mismatch of energy levels with TQ1. For structure B, the electrons injected into the PNDI-T10 domain would recombine with holes in the vicinity of the cathode, reducing the extractable charges in the devices and as a result the surface recombination rate of holes is overestimated. However, the calculated SR is comparable with the diffusion velocity υd ≈ μkT/qd = 0.020 cm s−1 with no field, and is much smaller than the drift velocity υd = μE = 0.076 cm s−1 under injection conditions assuming V − Vbi = 0.1 V. The mobility was fitted using the SCLC measured on pure TQ1 hole-only devices (Table S2, ESI†).
We did not observe obvious extraction current (no bump in current vs. time curves) in structure A, even under a higher applied voltage, and thus a higher injection current. The surface recombination velocity is too high to prevent holes from leaving the devices from the cathode contact in structure A, and is much higher than the bulk transport velocity. Adding a thin layer of PNDI-T10 which is supposed to be partially or even fully mixed with TQ1 after lamination, however, could dramatically diminish the collection of holes at PEI/PEDOT. The high surface recombination is probably because of the mismatched work function of PEI/PEDOT with the TQ1 HOMO, and the added n-type PNDI-T10 with a HOMO lower than that of TQ1 will act as a blocking layer. On the other hand, electron traps close to the cathode would also enhance the surface recombination by reducing the electron mobility according to Würfel et al.,41 so that the selectivity of electrodes strongly depends on the difference between the mobility of majority and minority charge carriers in the vicinity of the contact.
All the previous measurements and conclusions are consistent with the observation that BHJ/PNDI-T10 samples are better in carrier extraction for PTB7-Th devices but seem to not agree with the higher FF in TQ1:PNDI-T10 BHJ/BHJ samples. It is expected that the improved charge transport and lower recombination would usually result in a higher FF than that which the PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 system shows. The FF is an important, albeit the least understood, parameter for OPV so far. It is widely accepted that the FF depends on the interplay of charge transport, recombination, thickness and light intensity. Only a few research groups have developed analytical models to try to quantitatively correlate the FF with all these parameters, in which they defined the extraction and recombination ratio to characterize the field dependence of charge extraction.42,43
If we evaluate the performance in terms of the ratio between extraction and recombination, the BHJ/PNDI-T10 samples are better since the extracted current is higher than that for the BHJ/BHJ samples in the whole range of the fourth quadrant, meaning that this ratio is always higher. It should be noted that there is an obvious transition of the voltage dependence of the photocurrent for the TQ1:PNDI-T10 BHJ/BHJ samples. If there is a serious space charge effect, the local field in regions outside the space charge region would be low, with poor collection of photogenerated charge carriers. The changing of the applied voltage does not affect the field that much and thus the charge extraction is not affected.42 But at reverse voltages, transition could happen as this space charge region extends to the whole region and the field was found throughout the device length. This observation was also supported by the light intensity Jsc measurements where TQ1 BHJ/BHJ shows a much smaller α.
We note that all discussions relating the dark current transport mechanisms, which are studied using methods which are slow and well characterized by equilibrium mobilities, to the indicators of recombination mechanisms based on the light illumination intensity, which rely on the charge carriers introduced by photoinduced charge carrier separation, and which are at early times reflecting much higher and time dependent mobilities, are inherently complex.44–47
3 Conclusion
In summary, we made semitransparent all-polymer solar cells on flexible PET substrates using a roll-to-roll compatible lamination method with a mean transparency > 35% within the visible light range. PEDOT:PSS and PEI modified PEDOT:PSS work as the anode and cathode and polymer:polymer blends work as the active layers, which makes our solar cells real all-polymer solar cells, with all the functional layers made from polymers. The good mechanical and electrical binding between the different materials is obtained with lamination at an appropriate pressure and temperature. This lamination method allows us to fabricate solar cells with different geometries and when combined with the all-polymer concept it has great potential to scale up the low-cost OPV production. With the advantages of lamination, a 4 nm thick layer of a pure acceptor polymer was introduced between the cathode and a 90–110 nm thick polymer–polymer blend active layer (BHJ/PNDI-T10), and on average 2.3% PCE for PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 and 1.3% PCE for TQ1:PNDI-T10 were achieved, which is about a 20% improvement in the PCE compared to the BHJ/BHJ samples. Through charge transport, light intensity dependence, CELIV and EL measurements, we note that the thin layer of PNDI-T10 passivates PEI/PEDOT to reduce surface recombination via traps close to the cathode and recombination sites within the electrodes at the cathode side and reduce the space charge effect. More optimization could be done in the future to make PEDOT electrodes thinner to further increase the performance and lower the cost.
4 Experimental section
Device fabrication characterization
PEDOT:PSS PH1000 electrodes (Heraeus) and PEI were printed according to the literature.18 Active layers were spin-coated in a glovebox separately on PH1000 and PEI modified PH1000, and then laminated outside the glovebox using a roll laminator (GSS DH-650S Graphical Solutions, Scandinavia AB) with a roll temperature of 120 °C and a force ∼ 25 N between the two rollers. Force was measured using a force sensor (FlexiForce A201, Tekscan). TQ1:PNDI-T10 (2:1 wt%) was spin-coated using a solution of 12 mg ml−1 concentration in xylene at 500 rpm and 1500 rpm to achieve 45 nm and 90 nm thick films. PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 (1:1 wt%) was spin-coated using a solution of 12 mg ml−1 in CB at 700 rpm and 2000 rpm to achieve 55 nm and 110 nm films. 4 nm PNDI-T10 was spin-coated at 3000 rpm using 4 mg ml−1 in xylene. Devices for CELIV measurements were fabricated through drop casting. PNDI-T10 and TQ1 were synthesized according to the literature ref. 5 and 18. PTB7-Th was purchased from Solarmer Energy Inc, USA. J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under illumination from a solar simulator (LSH-7320 LED Solar Simulator, Newport). Light intensity was controlled by presetting the solar simulator from 0.1 to 1 sun and with a 11% neutral filter to obtain 0.01 sun. EQE was measured using Q-R system (Enlitech).
EL measurements
EL measurements were done using a Shamrock SR 303i spectrograph with a Newton EMCCD silicon detector cooled to −60 °C. EL EQE was measured using a homebuilt system using a calibrated large-area Si photodiode from Oriel.
CELIV measurements
CELIV measurement was done using a function generator (Tektronix AFG3022C) to generate the wavefunction needed and it is connected in series with the devices and a 1 kΩ resistor and using an oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 4104B-L) to record the transient voltage on the resistor.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of the lamination process, (b) molecular structure, (c) absorbance and (d) energy levels of TQ1, PTB7-Th and PNDI-T10.	 


TQ1	PNDI-T10	0.75 ± 0.01	64 ± 1	0.84 ± 0.00	0.4 ± 0.1a
TQ1:PNDI-T10	PNDI-T10	4.2 ± 0.6	40 ± 2	0.81 ± 0.01	1.4 ± 0.2
TQ1:PNDI-T10	TQ1:PNDI-T10	2.8 ± 0.4	46 ± 3	0.81 ± 0.01	1.1 ± 0.1
PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10	PNDI-T10	6.6 ± 0.5	43 ± 2	0.80 ± 0.00	2.3 ± 0.2
PTB7-TH:PNDI-T10	PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10	6.2 ± 0.1	39 ± 2	0.80 ± 0.01	1.9 ± 0.1
PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10	TQ1:PNDI-T10	5.3 ± 0.4	43 ± 3	0.80 ± 0.00	1.8 ± 0.1

 	Fig. 2  (a) and (b) Photocurrent of the devices with BHJ/BHJ and BHJ/PNDI-T10. (c) and (d) EQE data. The Jsc calculated from the EQE data does not agree with the Jsc determined from the I–V curves, probably due to strongly suppressed bimolecular recombination under low intensity light from a monochromator. As shown in light intensity dependence measurements, the current is the same for both BHJ/BHJ and BHJ/PNDI-T10 devices under 0.01 sun. (e) and (f) corrected IQE data of the active layers calculated by subtracting the absorption of the PEDOT electrodes from the total absorption of the devices.	 

 	Fig. 3  Light intensity dependence measurements. (a) and (b) are for PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 and (c) and (d) are for TQ1:PNDI-T10.	 
	(1)

 	Fig. 4  
J–V curves for electron only devices. (a) TQ1:PNDI-T10 and (b) PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10. Dotted lines have a slope of 2 as a guide for the eye.	 
	(2)

 	Fig. 5  Schematic of the CELIV technique is shown. J(t) has been corrected for the steady state current JD and total charges could be obtained using  where  and d is the thickness of the active layer. For all the different V values, ramping rate of the voltage is the same. The JD for structure B is 0.033 and 0.18 A m−2 at V = 0.7 V and V = 1.1 V. JD of structure A is 0.065, 0.097 and 0.148 A m−2 for V = 1.1 V, V = 1.3 V and V = 1.5 V. With different voltages, the injection current varies a lot, thus the accumulated charges will vary.
