    , Accepted 9th May 2019First published on 9th May 2019AbstractOxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting is one of the most critical and more demanding half-reactions in electrochemical devices; therefore, the design of highly efficient and nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts is required. Herein, we presented the fast microwave synthesis of the solid nanorods of Co(OH)2 and their conversion into interconnected porous nanorods of Co3O4 by high-temperature calcination for exposing active sites, which offered a high surface area; this resulted in faster exchange of intermediates and more efficient electron transfer for enhanced OER activities in alkaline solutions. The as-synthesized solid Co(OH)2 and calcined porous Co3O4 nanorod catalysts were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); finally, the OER performance was investigated for water oxidation. FE-SEM and HR-TEM images revealed the formation of solid nanorods of as-synthesized Co(OH)2, which were broken and converted into porous interconnected nanorods after calcination at a high temperature. In 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, solid Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C nanorods did not have favorable OER activity, while the Co3O4 @ 600 °C electrocatalyst exhibited a low onset potential (1.55 V vs. RHE) and Tafel slope (49 mV dec−1), maintaining robust stability for more than 18 h with negligible fading. This is mainly because the interconnected porous nanorod Co3O4 @ 600 °C catalyst possessed rich active boundary sites and short paths for charge/mass transport (higher reactivity of active sites) than Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C. Such high catalytic activity was attributed to the sufficient exposure of the accessible active sites of porous Co3O4 electrocatalysts.
Introduction
The production of chemical fuels from naturally abundant sources such as water and solar energy depends on the discovery of highly energy-efficient, stable and cost-effective water oxidation catalysts.1,2 In recent years, water oxidation has become an active area of research inspired by energy challenges and the emerging understanding of photosystem II.3 The overall efficiency of the water oxidation process is largely limited by OER, which usually has slow kinetics and requires a high overpotential to drive it. Of the two half-reactions for water splitting, OER is one of the most critical and most demanding half-reactions because it requires the coupling of 4 electron and proton transfers from two water molecules4,5 and the formation of an oxygen–oxygen bond,6,7 which occurs in the acidic and basic conditions via the reactions 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e− and 4OH− → 2H2O + 4e− + O2, respectively. Therefore, the development of a highly active OER catalyst is required to enhance the reaction rate and/or lower the overpotential.8 The overall photocatalytic water oxidation efficiency is generally determined by three processes, namely, the determination of the light absorption ability of the semiconducting material and electron–hole pair generation, separation and transfer to the surface of semiconductors and finally surface catalytic reactions, which is determined by the OER catalyst.9 Hence, to achieve the cost-effective production of solar fuels, it is important to address the water oxidation issue by developing an innovative and highly active OER catalyst. An efficient water oxidation catalyst based on precious metal elements such as the oxides of ruthenium10 and iridium11 exhibited superior OER performance. However, these materials are expensive (Ir = $1460 per ozt, Ru = $266 per ozt; March 2019), which limits their applications at the industrial scale.12 Alternatively, non-noble, inexpensive and earth-abundant transition metal/metal oxides that can undergo multiple oxidation/reduction states afford electrocatalysts such as Co–Ci,13 Co–Pi,14 Co–Bi,15 CoOx,16–18 Co3O4,19 CoP/CoP2,20 Fe–N–C,21 FiNi,22 MnOx,23 and NiOx;24,25 have attracted widespread scientific interest because of their superior activity towards water oxidation in neutral-to-basic solution conditions. It has also been reported that the conductivity of the Co-based catalyst can be increased by doping elements such as N, S, Fe, Ni and Ag.26–28 Unfortunately, the stability and performance issues of these electrocatalytic water oxidation systems limit their commercialization on a large scale; therefore, there is a continuous demand for the development of an efficient, stable and robust electrocatalyst.29 Among all the first-row transition metal oxides, cobalt and its (hydro) oxides have been extensively investigated as electrochemical water oxidation catalysts.18,30,31 They have shown promising water oxidation performance due to the mixed valence states of Co2+/3+/4+, which was first reported in the patent literature in 1968.32 Additionally, cobalt and its (hydro) oxides can dissolve in acids; thus, very few studies have focused on non-precious electrocatalysts for acidic OER33,34 and hence, the OER performance has been studied in alkaline solutions.35,36
However, the electrocatalytic performance of nanostructured cobalt and its (hydro) oxides is largely dependent on the surface-to-volume ratio and morphology.37,38 Therefore, the design of nanostructures with specific morphology, geometry and microstructures is an effective strategy for increasing the OER performance of the catalyst by increasing number of reactive active sites. Different synthetic approaches have been reported to prepare cobalt-based nanomaterials, which include electrodeposition,39 hydrothermal,40 and co-precipitation methods.41 Nevertheless, improving the reactivity and number of active sites to achieve a better OER performance remains a challenge. However, a fast synthesis procedure such as microwave heating, which offers the direct synthesis of solid Co(OH)2 nanorods at a low temperature and their conversion into porous microstructures, has been rarely reported. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the enhanced OER performance of high surface-to-volume ratio porous cobalt and its (hydro) oxide nanorods synthesized by a fast microwave heating process.
Inspired by these findings, we demonstrated a facile, fast microwave heating procedure for the synthesis of a stable, low-cost, environmentally friendly and efficient cobalt (hydro) oxide electrocatalyst for excellent OER performance in alkaline solutions, which could produce oxygen at a lower overpotential. Our measurements indicated that the electrocatalyst Co3O4 calcined at 600 °C required a low onset potential (1.55 V vs. RHE) and exhibited a low Tafel slope (49 mV dec−1) in a 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the cobalt (hydro) oxide electrocatalyst could maintain a stable performance for 18 h with negligible current loss. It should be pointed out that microwave heating and subsequent calcination is a simple and cost-effective approach and can be used for the rapid, large-scale synthesis of water splitting catalysts for industrial applications.
Experimental
Materials
All materials were of analytical grade and were purchased and used as-received without further purification: cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O); cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CH3(CH2)15N(CH3)3Br, CTAB); 1-pentanol; urea (CO(NH2)2); and cyclohexane.
Synthesis of cobalt (hydro) oxides
In a typical large-scale synthesis, urea (4.8 g) and CTAB (4 g) were dissolved in 400 ml of H2O, followed by stirring for 20 min. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (3.2 g) was dissolved in 25 ml of H2O and added to the above mixture to form solution A. Then, a mixed solution of 400 ml of cyclohexane and 24 ml of 1-pentanol was prepared to form solution B, which was then added to solution A. Then, the mixture was stirred for 60 min at room temperature. The reaction solution was then transferred to a Teflon-sealed microwave reactor. The reaction mixture was exposed to microwave radiation (800 W maximum power) at 120 °C for 4 h. After cooling the mixture at room temperature, the precipitated powder of solid Co(OH)2 nanorods was isolated by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with distilled water and ethanol and air-dried at room temperature. After drying, these solid Co(OH)2 nanorods were annealed in air at 400 °C and 600 °C for 2 h and converted into porous interconnected Co3O4 nanorods. The as-prepared samples and calcined at 400 °C and 600 °C were labelled as Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C electrocatalysts, respectively, and used for further structural and electrochemical characterizations.
Structural characterization
Scanning electron microscopy images were collected on a Nova Nano 630 scanning electron microscope (SEM) from FEI coupled with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). High-resolution transmission electron microcopy (HR-TEM) images of the as-synthesized and calcined samples were captured at 300 kV with a CT-Titan microscope (FEI Company). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyses were applied to the various regions of the HR-TEM micrographs to investigate the crystal structure. Bright-field images (BF) and the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were acquired to study the sample morphology and crystal structure. The crystallinity and phases of the prepared samples were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV) using a monochromatized X-ray beam with Cu-Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 10–80° with a step size of 2° and scanning rate of 0.05 steps per s. X-rays of wavelength 1.54178 Å and irradiation width of 1.43 mm used for this purpose were generated at 40 kV and 1.6 kW. Energy-dispersive XPS spectra were obtained on AMICUS KRATOS using Mg/Al anodes at 12 kV and 10 mA. The peak maximum of C 1s at 284.6 eV was used as an internal standard to correct the binding energies. For BET surface area measurements, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using micrometrics ASP 2420 analyses. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a thermal analyzer instrument (SDT Q600 V20.9) at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 in nitrogen gas.
Electrochemical characterization
All electrocatalytic OER performances were measured using Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ) at room temperature in a three-electrode cell connected to a Bio-Logic VMP3 electrochemical workstation. First, the as-prepared Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C electrocatalysts (10 mg) were ultrasonically dispersed in 10 ml of absolute ethanol and ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then, 30 μl of the aqueous dispersion of the catalyst was drop-casted on a 150 nm Au-sputtered glass substrate, which acted as the working electrode. A high-purity platinum wire and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were obtained at a scanning rate of 1 mV s−1 in a regular one-compartment electrochemical cell with a three-electrode configuration. A 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution of pH 13 was used as the electrolyte. During the experiments, it was ensured that only the desired active area was in contact with the electrolyte. All the potentials were measured with respect to the reference electrode Ag/AgCl and converted into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation: ERHE = E0 + 0.059 × 13 + 0.197. The reported potentials in the current manuscript were not corrected for the uncompensated resistance between the reference and working electrodes.
Results and discussion
The schematic for the synthesis of solid Co(OH)2 nanorods is presented in Fig. 1. The solid Co(OH)2 nanorods were synthesized in a Teflon-sealed reactor under microwave irradiation at 120 °C for 4 h in the presence of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant; then, they were converted to porous Co3O4 nanorods by calcining at 400 °C and 600 °C. Being a cationic surfactant, CTAB possesses a critical micelle concentration (CMC) in the range of 0.9–1.0 mmol L−1.42 CTAB surfactants dissolve with their polar groups at the hydrocarbon–water interface of the micelles. Therefore, the surface charge density of the ionic micelles decreases, which supports the formation of aligned micellar structures such as rods.43 At higher concentrations of cationic surfactants (greater than the CMC value), spherical micelles are converted into a solid rod-like structure.44 Hence, we used 44 mmol L−1 of CTAB concentration for the synthesis of Co(OH)2. This implied that rod-like structures comprising Co2+ ions can be easily formed using CTAB as a structure-directing agent. During the subsequent calcination process, the cobalt hydroxide precursor decomposed into interconnected porous Co3O4 nanorods, which approximately maintained the rod-like precursor morphology.

The successful conversion from hydroxide to oxide requires thermal stability of the chosen surfactant. Thus, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to evaluate the decomposition of CTAB (Fig. S6†). The TGA curve (Fig. S6†) reveals that CTAB is thermally stable up to 210 °C and completely decomposes at 320 °C. The catalysts were accordingly calcined at temperatures of 400 °C and 600 °C.

Fig. 2 shows the high-resolution FE-SEM and HR-TEM images of Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C. Fig. 2A–C show the overall SEM images of Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C, respectively. From the FE-SEM images, we clearly observe that the connectivity and shape of the nanorods are very well maintained during the high-temperature treatment; in contrast, the solid Co(OH)2 nanorods become increasingly porous due to the volume shrinkage caused by the dehydration of Co(OH)2 and phase change to Co3O4. From the HR-TEM images (Fig. 2D–F), it is revealed that the Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C sample is composed of uniform and smooth solid nanorods with a mean diameter of approximately 200 nm and an average length of approximately 2.87 μm. Interestingly, after calcination at 400 °C, the solid nanorods were converted to porous nanorods. It was also observed that these porous nanorods were composed of many cubic or octahedral structures, which self-assembled and formed rod-like microstructures of Co3O4; these were formed by the self-assembly of nanometer-sized (5–20 nm) particles in the 1D direction, as can be observed by their higher magnification images (Fig. S1†). However, with the increase in the calcination temperature up to 600 °C, porous rod-like structures were generated. The HR-TEM images reveal that inter-particle pores are developed at 400 °C; in contrast, after calcination at a higher temperature (600 °C), still continuity in the nanorods with perfect hexagonal-type crystalline facets are formed, which provides more active sites for a better OER performance. The selected area electron diffraction patterns of Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C indicated the polycrystalline nature of the particles (Fig. S2†). The bright spots of the concentric rings matched well with the Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C planes obtained from XRD. In addition, the purity of these nanoparticles was confirmed by the EDS spectrum, as shown in Fig. S3.† To assess the surface areas of the cobalt and (hydro) oxide samples, N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were obtained. As shown in Fig. S4,† Co3O4 @ 600 °C exhibits a large specific surface area of 120 m2 g−1 compared with Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C samples. The BET surface areas of Co3O4 @ 400 and Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C samples are 70 m2 g−1 and 50 m2 g−1, respectively. As explained above, the calcination treatment decomposes the organic surfactant such as CTAB and results in more porous nanorod structures of Co3O4 with phase change from hydroxide to oxide.

Furthermore, Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction to check the crystalline nature. The changes in the XRD patterns before and after the heat treatment are shown in Fig. 3A. The presence of a crystalline α-Co(OH)2 phase for the as-prepared Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C was observed (JCPDS file: 02-0925).45 However, after calcination, intense Bragg reflections at 2θ values of 19.02°, 31.30°, 36.94°, 38.65°, 44.99°, 55.87°, 59.49°, 65.33°, and 77.42° corresponding to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440) and (533) lattice planes of the cubic spinel-type phase with space group Fdm (Co3O4, JCPDS file: 73-1701, with a = 8.3919 Å) were observed. The formation of other crystalline phases including elemental metals or other non-spinel-type oxides was not observed. After comparing the XRD patterns of Co3O4 calcined at 400 °C and 600 °C, no significant difference was found, indicating that the increase in temperature does not change the crystal structure and phase purity of Co3O4; however, increment in intensity was observed.

XPS was performed to obtain the chemical compositions of Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C and Co3O4 nanostructures prepared at 400 °C and 600 °C. Fig. 3B shows the complete XPS survey spectra of Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C. From this figure, it is clearly evident that there is no contamination in the samples. The narrow scan for Co 2p of Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C is shown in Fig. 3C. The peak positions at 782.2 eV and 798.0 eV are attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, which are the characteristic peaks of the spinel phase of α-Co(OH)2.46,47 In contrast, the peak positions at 803.7 eV and 787.6 eV are the satellite peaks, corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2. Fig. 3D shows the narrow scan for O 1s of Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C. The peak position at 531.9 eV indicates the presence of oxygen in the form of hydroxide. The narrow scan for Co 2p of Co3O4 @ 400 °C is shown in Fig. 3C. The peak positions at 780.7 eV and 795.9 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 with a spin–orbit splitting of 15.2 eV.48 The tetrahedral Co2+ and octahedral Co3+ species contributed to the spin–orbit doublet 2p spectral profile of Co3O4,49 which was also observed in the narrow scan for Co 2p of Co3O4 @ 600 °C (Fig. 3C). The satellite peaks of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 found at 788.2 eV and 803.2 eV correspond to the presence of Co[II] and Co[III] on the surface of the material and are consistent with the reported values of binding energies.50 By comparing the relative intensities of the binding energy peaks corresponding to the Co2+ and Co3+ oxidation states, it can be seen that there is not much difference and they contribute equally to the formation of spinel Co3O4. Fig. 3D shows the narrow scan for O 1s of Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C. The O 1s spectra of Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C reveal a characteristic peak at 529.5 eV and satellite peaks at higher binding energies, which are consistent with that reported for the Co3O4 phase.40
The electrocatalytic OER performances of as-synthesized Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C electrocatalysts were evaluated in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte in three-electrode configuration using techniques such as linear sweep voltammetry, Tafel analysis and constant potential electrolysis. The onset potential and achieving a high current density at a given potential were considered as the criteria to judge the best catalyst. As represented in Fig. 4A, Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C electrocatalysts show promising OER performances. However, among all the three catalysts, Co3O4 @ 600 °C shows the best OER performance, displaying a low onset potential and a high current density response at an applied potential. Moreover, the current density of the Co3O4 @ 600 °C catalyst at 1.76 V vs. RHE was higher than those of the Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C and Co3O4 @ 400 °C catalysts. This was because high-temperature calcination generated more active sites of the Co3O4 @ 600 °C catalyst and higher hydration, which resulted in drastic improvement in the OER performance. In addition, as seen in the LSV curve, the Co3O4 @ 600 °C catalyst exhibits one weak oxidation peak at 1.23 V and a very strong peak at 1.43 V vs. RHE,45 corresponding to the transformation of Co2+/Co3+ and Co3+/Co4+, which is desirable for improving OER activity (Fig. S6†). As a result, Co3O4 @ 600 °C required a low overpotential to achieve a high current density compared to Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C and Co3O4 @ 400 °C electrocatalysts. As shown in the LSV curve, Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C requires a relatively higher overpotential to oxidize water, which is probably because cobalt ions need to be deoxidized from the solution to the electrode. To start the electrolysis of water, Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C and Co3O4 @ 400 °C electrocatalysts required 1.69 and 1.59 V vs. RHE onset potential, respectively, while the Co3O4 @ 600 °C catalyst needed only 1.55 V vs. RHE, indicating the effective OER performance of Co3O4 @ 600 °C. As shown in Fig. 4A, the onset potential for OER on Co3O4 @ 600 °C is 1.55 V vs. RHE, which is the lowest onset potential among those of the three samples; thus, Co3O4 @ 600 °C shows the best OER performance.

To understand the water oxidation mechanism, we analyzed the Tafel slope. The Tafel slopes for the Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C electrocatalysts were determined from the steady state currents and found to be 69 mV dec−1 for Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, 60 mV dec−1 for Co3O4 @ 400 °C and 49 mV dec−1 for Co3O4 @ 600 °C. The above-mentioned OER results confirm that the phase transition from Co(OH)2 to Co3O4 simply by a calcination treatment results in the formation of porous nanorods from solid nanorods by volume shrinkage and decomposition of the inactive organic surfactant (CTAB) used during the synthesis process. More importantly, the resulting porous Co3O4 @ 600 °C catalyst showed excellent OER performance, which could increase the effective surface area and provide better access to the active sites. Furthermore, the long-term electrolysis stability towards OER is of great significance for chemical fuel production. Co(OH)2 @ 120 °C, Co3O4 @ 400 °C and Co3O4 @ 600 °C were tested for stability under constant potential electrolysis.

Fig. 4C shows the current density–time profiles of all the three catalysts for 18 h electrolysis under highly oxidizing environments, i.e., 1.76 V vs. RHE. It is clearly seen that all the catalysts are stable during electrolysis with a higher current response. The Co3O4 catalyst calcined at 600 °C showed enhanced electrocatalytic OER performance with no drastic decrease in the current density profile. The superior electrocatalytic OER performance of cobalt and (hydro) oxide electrocatalysts can be attributed to the nanorod-like structure; this offers a large specific surface area and efficient release of the liberated oxygen from the catalyst deposited on an Au/glass support, which has higher mechanical strength and results in better stability of all the electrodes.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we rationally designed and demonstrated a facile and cost-effective microwave-based large-scale synthesis approach for the fabrication of a cobalt (hydro) oxide electrocatalyst. The electrocatalyst developed by microwave-induced synthesis resulted in solid nanorods of Co(OH)2, which were easily converted into porous interconnected nanorods by a simple heat treatment. When applied as an OER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium of 0.1 M KOH, Co3O4 @ 600 °C showed enhanced and better water oxidation activity including a low onset potential, low Tafel slope, and excellent stability. This high OER activity is attributed to porous nanorods that afford rich active sites and better charge and mass transport. We envisage that this simple approach addressed in the present work can be extended for the fabrication of an efficient water oxidation catalyst, which can lead to the production of useful chemical fuels from water oxidation.
