    , Accepted 2nd February 2022First published on 2nd February 2022AbstractThe limited stability of thermoelectric materials under operating conditions is a major inhibiting factor in the development of thermoelectric technology. With increasing awareness of the stability issue, many stability studies have been carried out during the past decade, and a wide range of characterization methods have been employed for evaluating stability. Here, we present a perspective on the most common characterization methods used in the thermoelectric literature for testing materials stability. Based on the parameter control and comparability to real-world conditions, we propose a division of stability tests into three overall levels to encourage more elaborate stability studies to be made with a high degree of real-world resemblance. For each level, we propose a reporting protocol to streamline the experimental information in stability studies, which will make comparison of results across studies much more reliable. We believe that these steps will help bridge the gap between fundamental materials science and actual application, which is necessary for better maturing thermoelectric technology towards broad commercialization.Lasse Rabøl JørgensenLasse Rabøl Jørgensen is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University (AU) working on thermoelectric materials.

Introduction
Thermoelectric materials can interconvert thermal and electrical energy and thus hold promise for waste heat harvesting for the green transition.1 The main inhibiting factor preventing commercialization once was the large cost per watt, due to low conversion efficiency and expensive and rare elements making up the best performing materials, but recent discoveries of both cheaper and better performing systems have significantly improved the economic viability of the thermoelectric technology.2–6 With that in mind, it is puzzling that there is still no commercially widespread thermoelectric module for energy harvesting available on the market for intermediate-to-high temperature applications.
The thermoelectric technology has for decades constituted the main power source in unmanned space probes for extraterrestrial exhibitions, where heat is delivered by a decay of radioactive isotopes, usually plutonium-238. These so-called radioisotope thermoelectric generators have been based on a variety of materials depending on the application temperature range, such as PbTe, PbSnTe, TAGS and SiGe.7 The high content of scarce tellurium in some of these systems has motivated the search for cheaper alternatives, but one of the biggest challenges in the search for new materials for thermoelectric application is to find materials, which can endure the harsh conditions of thermal and electrical gradients, where they must operate. This has been an essential challenge for NASA, which has lifetime tests incorporated as a natural part of their technology development lifecycle.8,9 To qualify for NASA's Next-Generation Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Study, the materials must exhibit stable physical properties for more than 17 years of constant operation.8,9 As such, even small signs of degradation during typical laboratory experiments and stability tests of several hours or days should be considered and scrutinized, as they might be exacerbated during years of operation. In the early 70's the TPM-217 module consisting of p-type Cu2Se and n-type GdSe was anticipated to replace PbTe-based modules due to its exciting conversion efficiency of 12%. However, stability issues with the Cu2Se-legs appeared during long-term operation, where Se evaporated from the hot end of the sample and mobile Cu-ions migrated in the direction of the current and precipitated as metallic Cu on the surface of the material.10,11 This naturally affects the thermoelectric properties of Cu2Se and furthermore deteriorates the electrical contact between the thermoelectric material and the interlayer. This decomposition mechanism seems common among the mixed-ionic-electronic-conductors (MIEC), which have received a lot of interest recently due to their complex crystal structure and associated low lattice thermal conductivity.12,13 These issues led NASA to fully abandon the system after years of testing.
From the perspective of a company with much less financial capacity than NASA, investing in a new thermoelectric material with a promising thermoelectric performance for energy harvesting comes with a lot of uncertainty due to the unknown stability of the material in a real thermoelectric application. This emphasizes the importance of performing stability tests already in the research stage rather than later in the product development, which is reflected in the significant increase in thermoelectric stability publications observed in the past decade (Fig. 1). The stability studies come with a variety of experimental approaches to test and evaluate stability, such as looking at the physical properties during thermal cycles,14,15 thermal analysis (DSC-TG),16–20 electrical output of a module assembly,21–24 or changes in the atomic structure as observed by diffraction.18,25,26 While diversity is beneficial, the lack of common test procedures or guidelines has the unfortunate downside that the experimental test environment and the level of detail reported in the studies are inconsistent, which complicates comparisons between stability studies. Furthermore, the test environment is usually not representative for the conditions found in a thermoelectric module, and the testing time is often inadequate to reveal slow structural changes or decompositions. Hence, extrapolating from the results of these tests to conclude on the stability in actual application settings is highly uncertain.
 Fig. 1  Evolution in the number of published thermoelectric stability studies since 1960. The results have been generated using Google Scholar with the following search string: allintitle:stability | stable | migration | degradation | decomposition | “break down” | deterioration | reliable thermoelectric – “phase stability” – “mechanically stable” – “thermodynamic stability” – “first-principles” – “ab initio” – “mechanical stability”. The results are influenced by duplicates and false positives. 
Since the potential applications for thermoelectric materials cover a wide range of environments, from extraterrestrial high temperature applications in vacuum to low power battery free heat sensors, defining one standard test for all purposes would be an oversimplification. Instead, the sample stability should be verified in a temperature window determined by the intended application of the material, and the atmosphere should similarly be chosen based on the expected operation atmosphere. However, even though some parameters vary between applications, some settings do remain constant in essentially any applications, that is, the sample must have a density of more than 95%,27 and must be able to endure the desired thermal gradient during long-term operations. These conditions, which are essential for application, are often what is lacking in thermoelectric stability studies.
With the increasing number of published stability studies, we find it timely to discuss and evaluate common characterization methods used for testing the stability of thermoelectric materials in order to address the strengths and shortcomings of each method.
Additionally, with the purpose of streamlining the reporting of parameters in thermoelectric stability studies, and thus increase the reproducibility of these studies, we encourage the implementation of a parameter reporting protocol. Such a protocol is difficult to define, as the complexity of the stability tests found in the thermoelectric literature varies significantly. As such, we propose to divide the stability tests into three levels of increasing complexity, real-world resemblance and parameter control. We propose an initial draft for such a division, which is aimed towards studies of thermoelectric materials, rather than thermoelectric modules, which cover most of the thermoelectric stability studies in the literature. These guidelines should then be used as a protocol when writing thermoelectric stability articles. Here, we give an outline for how such a reporting scheme could be defined for each of the three proposed levels of stability tests. It should be emphasized that the way of categorizing the stability tests and the content of the associated reporting protocol are merely suggestions, which are highly influenced by our own experiences and are thus inherently incomplete. The success of such an implementation therefore depends on contributions from other laboratories and research groups.
Characterizing stability of thermoelectric materials
What is stability?
In literature, instability of thermoelectric materials has expressed itself in a range of different ways, ranging from a complete decomposition of the crystal structure, as seen for SrZn2Sb2,20 to a slight growth of nano inclusions in the PbTe/PbS nano composite structure.28 This naturally raises the question: how should we define stability? When is a material unstable? From the perspective of an engineer, the electrical power produced by the thermoelectric module must be constant over time. However, in the nano composite structure of PbTe/PbS, a clear decrease in the S-content of the PbTe-PbS solid solution was observed during exposure to high temperatures, which resulted in a growth of the PbS nanoparticles. However, this significant alteration of the overall system did not deteriorate its physical properties. As such, it appears that defining stability as the ability to exhibit stable physical properties over time is insufficient. Instead, we define stability more fundamentally as an irreversible change in the state of the sample. In order to fully characterize such changes, several characterization techniques are often required.
In this section, the most widely used techniques for characterizing stability in the thermoelectric literature will be discussed with the purpose of clearly addressing their capabilities and shortcomings. Here, we will mainly focus on the physical properties used to determine the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), X-ray diffraction, DSC-TG and module assemblies.
Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity
Both the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity are sensitive probes of the carrier concentration, and are therefore capable of detecting subtle changes in the doping content of a phase, which are hardly detectable by other techniques such as diffraction.29 The Seebeck microprobe instrument developed by Dieter Platzek adds spatial resolution, and it is an excellent tool for revealing spatially varying compositions, as has been demonstrated in a number of studies.30,31
The electrical conductivity is also influenced by minuscule changes in the atomic structure properties such as defects and grain boundaries. This is has been seen for Mg3+δSb1.49Bi0.5Te0.01, where the effect of resistive grain boundaries was shown to limit the performance of the material at room temperature.32 By annealing the sample in Mg-vapor, it was possible to increase the grain sizes while maintaining the necessary Mg-rich stoichiometry of the sample. The immediate effect was a significant improvement in the measured electrical conductivity at room temperature,33 as shown in Fig. 2. The average grain sizes shown in this study was measured using electron backscattering.

One drawback of testing stability through the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity is that structural information remains inaccessible, and even though changes in the atomic structure often are reflected in the physical properties, the underlying mechanisms mostly remain unexplainable from the measured transport values alone. Furthermore, potential phase decompositions might occur, which are not necessarily clear from the electronic property data.
One such case is the study by Kuznetsov from 1999 on the thermoelectric properties of Ba8Ga16X30 with X = Si, Ge and Sn.34 From the Seebeck coefficient measured in the temperature range of 100–870 K, a good agreement between the measured and calculated values was found for the samples containing Si and Sn using a single parabolic band model with acoustic phonon scattering. For Ba8Ge16Ge30, a significant deviation from the calculated model was observed, as seen in Fig. 3a, which remained unexplored at the time. Later studies of the thermal stability found Ga to be expelled from the clathrate structure at elevated temperatures (Fig. 3b), as observed through DSC15 and a combination of PXRD and TEM-EDX.18 This also demonstrates the potential consequence of overlooking stability during high temperature physical property measurements as the measured values might not represent the anticipated compound.

Despite being highly sensitive towards minute changes in the doping content of the main phase, detecting small fractions of impurity phases might be troublesome using the bulk Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. This depends on the spatial distribution of the impurity phase, but well-dispersed impurity phases in low contents normally do not change the bulk electrical transport properties significantly.27
Thermal conductivity
While it is crucial to characterize the thermal conductivity of a material in the expected operational temperature range, it is not an optimal parameter for stability evaluation at high temperatures. This is because the phonon mean free path in a solid is significantly reduced at elevated temperatures due to increased phonon–phonon scattering. Contributions from compositional variations, order–disorder transitions and nano-structuring, which usually scatter phonons on longer length scales, will therefore effectively be drowned.35 Minor structural changes in a material might therefore not be visible from the high temperature thermal conductivity, and stability claims based solely on an unchanged thermal conductivity through repetitive thermal cycling should therefore be avoided. This is not to say that the thermal conductivity is unchangeable at high temperatures, but the behavior is highly dependent on the system and the dominating phonon modes.
Dissolution of impurity phases and changes in sample crystallinity during high-temperature stability tests will influence the thermal conductivity peak usually found in the low-temperature range from approximately 10–100 K, where phonon–phonon scattering is weak. Crystallite growth also affects the thermal conductivity through macroscopic boundary scattering at even lower temperatures.36 Using low-temperature thermal conductivity measurements as an ex situ characterization method in-between heating cycles can therefore yield extremely useful information about the sample, which is hardly obtainable from other techniques.
Powder diffraction
Powder diffraction (X-ray or neutron) is a highly suitable technique for studying the structural stability of crystalline components. The diffraction pattern produced by a crystalline phase can be thought of as a unique fingerprint, and several crystalline phases in a single sample can therefore be identified and monitored all at once. In the thermoelectric community, powder diffraction is mostly used to check for phase purity after synthesis, but it has also been used to infer the decomposition mechanism from the resulting decomposition products.37 Measuring X-ray diffraction data after any sample processing or high-temperature property measurement is generally advised to ensure that the structure remains stable and unchanged.
With the advancement of neutron, synchrotron and powerful laboratory X-ray sources, both in terms of photon flux and possible sample environments, non-ambient time-resolved diffraction experiments have become fully viable. Due to the high time-resolution enabled by 3rd generation synchrotron sources, it is possible to follow decompositions while they occur with the purpose of explaining the underlying mechanism.
An archetypical example on the importance of stability studies is thermoelectric β-Zn4Sb3, where diffraction techniques have been essential for establishing the stability limits. The material instability was first observed by Tapiero et al. in 1985,38 who considered the material for photovoltaic solar cell energy conversion, and later by Caillat et al. in 1997 in a thermoelectric context,13 but it was not until 2004 that the decomposition was understood using diffraction techniques. Here, Mozharivskyj et al. observed formation of ZnSb and Sb byproducts during heating,37 and Pedersen et al. later quantified the content of the impurity phases based on synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data collected at multiple temperatures.25 Based on the formation of these byproducts, two decomposition mechanisms were proposed by Yin et al.,39 (i) Zn4Sb3 → ZnSb + Zn and (ii) Zn4Sb3 → Zn + Sb. Numerous studies have later attempted to improve the stability e.g. by the synthesis method,40 cation substitution,41 nanostructuring,42 or inclusion of nanoparticles.43 Stability studies have also considered the effect of a thermal gradient and an electric field on Zn4Sb3. Here, severe zinc migration was observed in the direction of an applied current, or in the direction dictated by the Seebeck effect in the case of a thermal gradient.41,44,45 This causes decomposition of the Zn4Sb3 phase in the zinc-deficient end of the sample and growth of zinc whiskers in the zinc-enriched end.
Diffraction peaks are only produced by crystalline phases. Even semi-crystalline phases, such as nano-particles, are hardly detectable if present in low quantities.46 The scattering from non-crystalline components will be diffusely distributed in the diffraction pattern, but it can be analyzed through the Pair Distribution Function. This analysis has some drawbacks at high temperatures such as severe peak broadening, but it can be used as an ex situ tool to study the material after thermal treatment. These types of experiments are widely used in other fields of materials science, such as battery operando experiments,47,48in situ hydrothermal-nucleation49,50 and have also been applied in thermoelectric operando experiments by our group.45,51
From the shape of the diffraction peaks it is possible to extract microstructural parameters such as the distribution of unit cell sizes and the average crystallite size, but for grains larger than approximately 100 nm, the peak shape is no longer significantly afftected by the crystallite size.52 For observing growth of grains significantly larger than 100 nm, which was shown to influence the electrical conductivity in the example by Wood et al.,33 conventional diffraction techniques are not optimal.
Another risk of assessing the material stability using diffraction methods is that changes in the crystal structure do not necessarily affect the bulk physical properties. In cases where only minute structural changes are observed, the thermoelectric properties should be measured separately.
Simultaneous thermal analysis
Thermogravimety (TG) is an important method for stability testing. At NASA it is primarily used in the so-called Beginning of Life test, which extends for several days before eventually moving to instruments that are more sophisticated.9 For NASA, it is essential to determine the sublimation rate of a material when operated at high temperature and in high vacuum, as severe sublimation could lead to porosity, excessive contact resistance, mechanical failure and an overall reduced conversion efficiency.
TG is not capable of revealing phase transitions, which is why it is often combined with DSC, where endo- and exothermic reactions are detected. In these methods, data is produced with a high time-resolution, which enables accurate determination of transition temperatures. The observed transition temperature in a DSC experiment is mostly determined by the thermodynamics of the system but can also be influenced by experimental parameters such as the applied heating rate. This is especially true for kinetically limited transitions, where a high heating rate can shift the observed signal. By varying the applied heating rate in succeeding experiments, it is possible to estimate certain kinetic properties, such as the reaction rate constant and activation energy.19,20,53
In this regard, the combination of DSC and TG is a well-suited solution for probing the immediate thermal stability of a material, producing results with a high reproducibility due to the tightly controlled atmosphere and heating rate. Heating the sample uniformly, however, does not fully represent the thermal profile of a material in a thermoelectric module, as the additional effects from a thermal gradient are not considered. Also, the typical DSC-TG experiments presented in literature are rather short-term and consider mostly just a single thermal cycle. In such cases, slow evaporation or decomposition reactions can easily be overlooked.
Thermoelectric module assembly
Long-term stability tests have been carried out in literature on commercial Bi2Te3-based and non-commercial half-Heusler-based modules.21–24 In these studies, the stability of the thermoelectric module is often evaluated partly from the electrical power output and the electromotive force generated by the applied thermal gradient, and the tests are usually conducted over thousands of thermal cycles to mimic realistic applications. Displaying a stable power output at a constant thermal gradient is essential for any thermoelectric application, and evaluating stability based on this parameter is therefore highly useful from an application point of view. In contrast to most stability studies in the thermoelectric literature, where focus is on the individual thermoelectric legs, evaluating the stability of the entire module as a whole is certainly an efficient approach. If the power output is constant, small changes in the atomic or microscopic structure within the individual thermoelectric legs are of little concern. However, one should be aware that this approach considerably increases the number of investigated parameters as numerous aspects associated with assembling a thermoelectric module could influence the resulting power output, such as increased thermal and electrical interface resistances, stability and diffusion of contact materials etc. As such, the origin of a decreasing electrical power output would be hard to diagnose, and additional autopsy would be required such as physical property measurements,24 AC impedance measurements21 or microscopy.22 To successfully assemble a thermoelectric module requires a high level of technical expertise, which naturally limits the availability of this testing method.
As mentioned, assembling a thermoelectric module brings about additional challenges to the stability of the individual thermoelectric legs. One of the main issues lies in the interface diffusion between the thermoelectric legs and the electrode material. A rich literature exists on the interlayer diffusion of the skutterudite structure CoSb3 and electrodes consisting of e.g. Mo, Cu and W.54–57 During thermal aging, formation of an intermetallic layer occurs, which is highly detrimental for the mechanical stability and the physical properties of the thermoelectric module.58 Often, such issues are solved by introducing a diffusion blocking interlayer.59,60
Another challenge lies in finding electrode, diffusion barrier and thermoelectric materials with similar coefficient of thermal expansion. With several layers compactly connected, a mismatch in thermal expansion causes severe mechanical stress, which ultimately leads to formation of cracks and mechanical failure during extended thermal cycling.55,61 These are just some of the challenges that are faced when assembling a module and the solutions to such issues are often unpublished and kept a business secret.
Mechanical stability tests
As briefly mentioned in the previous section, inducing a thermal gradient across a thermoelectric material leads to structural strain inside the material due to thermal expansion.62 However, besides elevated temperatures, thermal gradients and electric fields, thermoelectric modules might also encounter mechanical challenges such as vibrations, compression, or shear stress. To cope with such conditions, the material needs to possess a high hardness. In the literature, hardness is often determined from nano indentation measurements.63 However, a high material hardness does not guarantee mechanical stability of the final thermoelectric module. Once again, assembling a module introduces a range of additional mechanical challenges. For radioisotope thermoelectric generators, comprehensive vibration and shock tests are conducted on the entire generator to ensure mechanical reliability prior to extraterrestrial launches.64
Categorization of stability tests
The different characterization methods used to evaluate stability require specific sample geometries, atmosphere composition and furthermore employs different heating profiles. This brings about two apparent challenges. Firstly, the test environment will often differ from the potential application environment. The stability results obtained will therefore not guarantee that the material is actually stable during real-world applications. Secondly, results from different stability studies using different characterization methods might not be comparable. This is particularly true if the experimental parameters are reported inadequately, which is unfortunately the case in some studies.
Historically, collective efforts to streamline how physical properties are measured and reported are common in the thermoelectric community.65,66 For characterizing thermoelectric stability, no such consensus currently exists. Thus, to streamline the way experimental parameters are reported in thermoelectric stability literature, we propose to implement a reporting protocol for the test parameters employed during stability tests. As the reporting protocol should match the complexity of the experiment, it requires some division of the stability tests found in the thermoelectric literature. How to divide these studies is highly subjective and can be done in many ways depending on the overall purpose. In Table 1, we present a possible categorization of stability tests, which focuses on the stability of individual thermoelectric materials rather than thermoelectric modules as an ensemble. The motivation behind this particular focus is that we want to enhance the reproducibility of stability tests in the thermoelectric literature, which mostly focus on thermoelectric materials. Here, we divide the stability tests based on the parameter control of the experiment and the real-world resemblance of the test. We acknowledge that this division deviates from the conventional R&D stages towards commercialization. Such a division could instead range from (1) thermodynamical stability tests of the individual materials at high temperatures and in inert atmospheres followed by (2) thermal gradients, electrical fields, and reactive atmospheres, and finally (3) insertion and evaluation of the material in a thermoelectric module. We fully acknowledge that this represents another useful way of categorizing stability tests.

Our proposed categorization, which is heavily inspired by the community of perovskite photovoltaics, divides stability tests into three levels based on the parameter control and the real-world resemblance of the test.67,68 The purpose of this is to encourage more elaborate stability research to be conducted and to clearly mark those where the results are relevant for module integration.
In Table 1, the proposed experimental characteristics defining the three levels are listed. The proposed characteristics should operate as minimum requirements for the different levels, and most of the actual stability studies are probably placed somewhere in-between these levels. The first level covers the uncontrolled experiments, which can be carried out with low-grade experimental equipment, such as an oven or a hot-plate, and where the test environment, exact temperature and sample characteristics are largely unrestricted and uncontrolled. We note that these experiments are still very useful and can certainly contribute with valuable information, but the reproducibility of these results might be limited by the lack of parameter control. The second level covers more reproducible tests, which are mostly carried out using commercial instruments, and where the atmosphere, heating rate and temperature are tightly controlled. Most stability tests in the thermoelectric literature fall into this category. The results from these tests are reproducible and indisputable but claiming that a material is stabile during operation should not be done purely based on results from a level 2 test, as the sample, heating profile and test times do not match that of the true application. Instead, the level 3 tests require conditions, which approach that of a thermoelectric module. The results from these tests are not only highly reproducible but can furthermore be used in estimating the lifetime of the material, which can be used to assess whether further development and module integration are meaningful. The intention with this level is to combine the reproducibility and careful parameter control of fundamental science with the application aspects of engineering, which might require interdisciplinary collaboration to fulfill.
Reporting protocol
For each level of the stability tests presented in Table 1, we propose an experimental reporting protocol (Table 2). The protocol is a list of parameters, which we have found to be important when evaluating stability, and it can be used as a checklist in the process of preparing a scientific manuscript. The degree of detail needed to be reported is naturally increasing for the three levels and is closely linked to the experimental requirements in Table 1. As the current version of the protocol contains only the parameters we have found to be important, some of the proposed parameters could turn out to be redundant with respect to the material stability, whereas parameters overlooked in this scheme on the other hand could turn out to be crucial for some systems. As such, the protocol should not be considered final, but instead be dynamically updated with newly identified factors as the field of thermoelectric stability studies becomes increasingly explored. We therefore advise researchers to go beyond the protocol when reporting experimental parameters.

We hope that introducing a reporting protocol will help streamline the reported parameters in stability studies, which will improve the comparability between studies and the reproducibility of the results, and thus create the optimal prerequisites for mapping out the exact influence of individual parameters on the stability of the different thermoelectric systems.
Final remarks
Even though operational stability is rarely addressed adequately in high-impact publications of thermoelectric materials, it is as crucial for the overall performance as a high figure of merit. Nevertheless, a significant increase in the number of studies specifically dedicated towards stability has been observed in the past decade employing a wide range of characterization methods. This has led to a deep understanding of the root of instability in numerous well-known thermo-electric systems such as Zn4Sb3 and Cu2Se/Cu2S, where detrimental ion migration occurs in an electric field,51,69 or Mg3Sb2-type materials, where Mg-evaporation is believed to be causing a fall in the carrier concentration at extended exposure to high temperatures.70 Common for these discoveries is that they are paramount in enabling a tailored stabilization strategy to be formulated such as segmentation,69,71 coating,72 and elemental doping.70,73,74 This emphasizes the importance of not only testing the stability but also understanding the mechanisms at play. A new trend in thermoelectric stability studies is to combine several characterization techniques in studying the material, while exposing it to more realistic conditions. Recent examples include the custom-built operando setup by Jørgensen et al., which is capable of combining electronic property data with diffraction data during the stability test,45,51 the setup by Jakob et al., which combines spatially resolved Seebeck coefficient measurements with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,44 and the setup by Hung et al. combining in situ transmission electron microscopy and physical property measurements.41 By proposing the categorization scheme, we hope to inspire even more of these detailed stability researches to be conducted, which will have a huge impact in maturing the thermoelectric technology. Combined with the experimental reporting protocol, we hope to contribute to the overall progress of the field of thermoelectric stability research.

He has extensively used synchrotron X-ray scattering techniques to investigate the atomic structure of materials.
Bo Brummerstedt Iversen	Bo Brummerstedt Iversen is professor of chemistry at Aarhus University (AU) and VILLUM Investigator. He received his PhD degree in 1995 from AU, and he holds both a Doctor of Science degree (AU, 2002, on chemical bonding) and a Doctor of Technology degree (DTU, 2010, on thermoelectrics). His work has focus on exploiting structural studies to obtain a proper understanding of material properties.

 	Fig. 1  Evolution in the number of published thermoelectric stability studies since 1960. The results have been generated using Google Scholar with the following search string: allintitle:stability | stable | migration | degradation | decomposition | “break down” | deterioration | reliable thermoelectric – “phase stability” – “mechanically stable” – “thermodynamic stability” – “first-principles” – “ab initio” – “mechanical stability”. The results are influenced by duplicates and false positives.
