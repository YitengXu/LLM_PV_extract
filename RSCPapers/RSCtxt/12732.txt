    , Accepted 21st April 2016First published on 21st April 2016AbstractIn this study, graphene/MoS2 quantum dots (G/M QDs) hybrid nanostructures were synthesized in two steps. The bulk materials were separately converted into quantum dots by combining physical exfoliation and solvothermal treatments. Then, the two QDs were assembled together in a hot water bath. The products exhibit excellent fluorescence and gas sensitivity to NO2 and NH3, which can be manipulated by adjusting the proportion of the components. The light-reinforced effect on the gas sensing properties of quantum dots was verified by analysing the photothermal heating curves. Due to these properties, the developed hybrid QDs are potentially suitable for gas sensing applications.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of graphene, a lot of attention has been given to other 2D layered materials due to their unique electronic properties and high surface-to-volume ratio characteristics, which provide wide-ranging applications, including sensors, photodetectors, lithium ion batteries, and energy storage applications.1–3 Among these, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a widely known transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), has been traditionally used as a solid-state lubricant,4 as well as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution,5 supercapacitor electrode,6 and photodetector.7 However, in spite of the excellent semiconducting properties of MoS2, there are few recent reports on its potential as a viable and effective gas sensor.8,9 Considering the low conductivities of TMDs, the possibility of using hybrid nanostructures to fabricate functional devices offers a new solution to improve device performance.10,11 Accordingly, blending MoS2 with graphene can obviously improve their gas sensing behavior.12,13
Quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as zero dimensional nanomaterials with sizes less than 10 nm. TMD QDs, in general, have potential in nanoscale device applications, such as next-generation electronic and chemical devices (including LEDs and solar cells), because they not only have the advantages of the traditional semiconductor quantum dots, such as unique optical and electrochemical properties, but also have low toxicity and are environmentally friendly when compared with toxic heavy metal quantum dots.14 Therefore, numerous studies have focused on the synthesis, properties, and applications of these nanomaterials.15,16
Herein, for the first time, we report a facile technique used for the synthesis of G/M QDs for gas sensing. The sensing properties for NO2 and NH3 have been assessed under light illumination, which undoubtedly opens up new possibilities for various environmental sensing devices.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of graphene–MoS2 quantum dots hybrid nanostructures
Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized from natural graphite flakes using the modified Hummers method as described beforehand (as described in the ESI†).13 GO/MoS2 powder was first exfoliated to nanosheets via a high-speed shear mixing method. Typically, 1 g of GO/MoS2 powder and 100 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were added into a 150 mL serum bottle and maintained under high-speed shear mixing at 5000 rpm for 3 h. Then, the suspensions were maintained under sonication for 3 h using an ultrasonic probe (VCX 350) at 20 kHz. After sonication for 3 h, the as-prepared suspensions were transferred into a 150 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and then hydrothermally heated at 140 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the resulting suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm and dried in vacuo at 80 °C. The obtained graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and MoS2 quantum dots (MQDs) were mixed in a 1:1 mass ratio at 80 °C in a water bath for 24 h, the G/M QDs obtained and designated as G/M 1:1. For comparison, the hybrid nanostructures with a 3:1 and 5:1 mass ratio were prepared and named as G/M 3:1 and G/M 5:1, respectively.
2.2 Characterization
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis of the powders was carried out with on a JEOL JEM-1200EX electron microscope operating at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Thermoescalab 250Xi instrument with Al Kα radiation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Multimode Nano 4 microscope operated in tapping mode. The absorption and fluorescence spectra were obtained at room temperature on a Hitachi 3100 spectrophotometer and a Hitachi 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively.
The gas sensing tests were carried out using a chemical gas sensor-1 temperature pressure intelligent gas sensing analysis system (CGS-1PT, Elite Tech, China). The G/M QDs were dispersed in DMF and then drops (0.1 mL) of the dispersion were cast onto the platinum interdigital electrode. To purify the sensor and improve the electrical connection, the devices were annealed in 80 °C before analysis. For improved adsorption and recovery, NO2 and NH3 were injected into the chamber for 5 min at different concentrations (10, 50, 100, 200, 500 ppm) and recovered in pure nitrogen flow for 5 min. Considering the influence of the sample weight, the samples were maintained at the same weight in the gas sensing measurements. Light-assisted gas sensing tests were carried out using a 80 mW cm−2 laser with 532 nm green emission.
To investigate the photothermal effect under light illumination, 1 mL of an aqueous solution of G/M QDs was irradiated using a laser (532 nm, 80 mW cm−2) for 5 min. The temperatures of the solutions were monitored using a thermocouple microprobe submerged in the solution. To compare the photothermal conversion efficiency of the G/M QDs with other reported nanoparticles, the illumination power was adjusted to 0.6 W cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The morphology and microstructure of the graphene–MoS2 quantum dots

Fig. 1 displays the typical characterization studies of the uniform quantum dots observed after the solvothermal treatment. The average size of the MQDs and GQDs was about 7.8 and 12.5 nm, respectively (Fig. 1(a) and (b)). HRTEM shows the defect free crystal lattice with d-spacing of 0.23 nm, corresponding to the (103) faces of the MoS2 crystals.17 The lattice spacing of the GQDs was 0.28 nm, smaller than the (002) interlayer spacing of bulk graphite (0.334 nm).18 As shown in Fig. 1(c), the graphene and MoS2 QDs are stacked together, forming larger, sub-micron agglomerates with widths of <100 nm and lengths around 90–120 nm. In Fig. 1(d), the interference of two overlapping quantum dots can be clearly observed. The intersection of the crystal lattices with different d-spacing indicates the formation of a stacked structure. To further investigate the thickness of the G/M QDs, AFM measurements were carried out. The results show that the average height of the G/M QDs was about 3.1 nm. The height of monolayer graphene/MoS2 was 0.8–1.2 nm,17,19 suggesting that most of the G/M QDs were tri-layered.

The chemical composition of the G/M QDs and GO nanosheets were characterized by XPS spectroscopy (Fig. S2 ESI†). The peaks at 229.6 and 232.8 eV in the Mo spectrum were assigned to Mo4+ 3d3/2 and Mo4+ 3d5/2, respectively, and the weak peak at 235.9 eV corresponds to Mo6+, indicating slight oxidation occurs during the process of the experiment. In addition, a doublet for S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 was observed at 162.3 and 163.5 eV, respectively. When compared to the C 1s peak fitting spectrum of GO, the relative intensity of CC/C–C in the G/M QDs increased, which confirms the GO was partially reduced during the preparation of the GQDs.
3.2 The optical properties of the graphene–MoS2 quantum dots
To further investigate the properties of the G/M QDs, the samples were characterized by absorption spectroscopy. The UV-Vis spectra shown in Fig. 2(a) exhibits a peak in the near-UV region (λ < 300 nm), which was ascribed to the excitonic features of the MQDs.20 The inset figures are images of the MQDs dispersed in DMF under visible and 365 nm radiation. The blue fluorescent color was observed by the naked eye. For the GQDs, the absorption peak at 267 nm was assigned to the π–π* transition of the aromatic sp2 domains21 (Fig. S3†). Then, the optical properties of the MQDs and GQDs were investigated using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy at room temperature (Fig. S4†). The MQDs exhibit an intense fluorescence with a peak maximum at 407 nm under an excitation wavelength of 339 nm. However, the PL excitation (PLE) spectrum of the GQDs recorded with the strongest luminescence shows two peaks at 287 and 395 nm (Fig. S4d†), indicating that the observed luminescence of the GQDs was directly correlated with the two new transitions at 287 and 395 nm rather than the π–π* transition.21 According to the carbene-like triplet ground state theory,22 the two transitions can be regarded as transitions from the σ and π orbitals (highest occupied molecular orbitals, HOMOs) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The δE between 395 nm (3.13 eV) and 287 nm (4.32 eV) was within the required value (1.5 eV), which suggests that the analysis was reasonable. When the excitation wavelength ranged from 320 to 460 nm, the PL peak of the MQDs presents a red shift ranging from 402 to 531 nm (Fig. 2(b)). The excitation dependent luminescence indicates the polydispersity of the MQDs dispersions.23 This interesting feature was also observed for the GQDs shown in Fig. 2(c) and other nanocrystals.24,25 As a comparison, the PL spectra of the G/M QDs with different GQDs concentrations are shown in Fig. 2(d). The PL intensity decreases and red shifts upon increasing the GQDs concentration, which can be attributed to a change in the exciton density via n-type doping.26 According to the reported study,27 the estimated HUMO level of GQDs is around 4.3 eV28 and the MQD Fermi level is around 4.5 eV;29 therefore, the photo-excited electrons can be effectively transferred from the GQDs to the MQDs. The doping electrons suppress the recombination of the electron–hole pairs, leading to the PL red shifting and intensity attenuation.

3.3 The gas sensing properties of the graphene–MoS2 quantum dots
The gas sensing properties of the as-prepared quantum dots were tested under different concentration of NO2 and NH3 (see details in the Experimental section). The gas sensitivity of the quantum dots is defined as:  where Rg is the resistance detected under target gas exposure and R0 is the initial resistance under N2 exposure. As shown in Fig. 3, the gas sensing mechanism can be described as a charge transfer mechanism. During preparation of the graphene and MoS2 quantum dots, a certain amount of functional groups still exist because of incomplete reduction according to the XPS spectra.19 Moreover, the process can introduce some vacancies and structural defects, which can also act as adsorption sites for gas molecules.30 They can act as temporary dopants, which contribute electrons or holes to the quantum dots and change the electron concentration. The adsorption of electron-accepting gas molecules, such as NO2, enhances the doping level of the quantum dots and increases their conductance. On the other hand, electron-donating molecules such as NH3 de-dope the quantum dots and decrease their conductance.12,31 The GQDs usually behaves as a p-type semiconductor in air at room temperature and was usually used as a conducting channel.32,33 Because the G/M quantum dots can form an excellent charge transfer pathways, the charge can favorably travel from the MQDs to the GQDs and transport quickly through the pristine sp2 carbon structures of the GQDs, resulting in a very large and fast variation of the resistance.

Fig. 4 illustrates the dynamic sensing response of the sensor against various NO2 and NH3 concentrations. Fig. 4(a) and (b) suggest that the G/M QDs exhibit an excellent response to different concentrations of NO2 and NH3. The resistance reacts significantly even at low concentrations of 10 ppm. Moreover, the sensitivities of the G/M QDs to NO2 and NH3 are much higher than those of the GQDs and MQDs. In addition, the reaction and recovery time were much shorter. This is mainly due to the high conductivity of the GQDs,34,35 which sets up channels to transfer the carriers generated between MoS2 and the target gas. Moreover, the recoveries were not complete due to the high-energy binding sites of the GQDs and MQDs,36,37 which makes the desorption of gas difficult. Moreover, the effect of desorption on the recovery becomes greater when the resistance of the system varies intensely. We will focus on how to balance the relationship between the selectivity and fast desorption in our future study. The working temperature of the G/M QDs was around room temperature, which is much lower than that found for previously reported metal oxide quantum dot semiconductors and their hybrid structures.38,39 Our results suggest low energies were required for target gas adsorption and desorption.

Insets: the corresponding plots of percentage change in sensitivity vs. low gas concentration (2, 5, 10 ppm) and their fitting curves for the LOD. 
To investigate the appropriate proportion of components, the gas sensitivities of the G/M QDs with different proportions of GQDs were measured. The sensitive response of G/M 3:1 was greater than the other two (as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d)). This was mainly attributed to an insufficient amount of GQDs leading to a shortage of flexible carriers in the system. On the contrary, an excess inhibits the gas adsorption and desorption of the MQDs. The limits of detection (LOD) for the G/M QDs devices were calculated based on a signal (S)-to-noise (N) ratio (S/N > 3), as shown in insets of Fig. 4(c) and (d) (details shown in S5†).40 The theoretical LODs to NO2 and NH3 were calculated to be 41.4 ppb and 35.5 ppb, respectively, in the case of G/M 3:1, which are lower or comparable with graphene-based sensors and our previously reported MoS2–graphene fiber devices.13,41–43
In view of the photosensitivity of MoS2,44,45 light irradiation was applied during the gas sensing measurements. To retain the structural integrity and stability of the G/M QDs, we selected a 532 nm light source with a low power density of around 80 mW cm−2, instead of UV light.46 As shown in Fig. 5, the sensitivities of G/M 3:1 to NO2 and NH3 increase by 6.5% and 7.1%, respectively. The light-assisted sensing performance is attributed to varied mechanisms.36,47 For monolayer MoS2, the photothermoelectric effect contributes more to the photocurrent than photoexcited electron–hole pairs across the Schottky barriers.48 The photothermology-assisted generation of current between the G/M QDs and the target gases can be understood as follows: the absorption of light creates a local heating at the junction between the MQDs and the gas. This local heating of the junction is translated into a voltage difference, which will drive current through the device.

3.4 The photothermal properties of graphene–MoS2 quantum dots
To investigate the photothermal performance of the quantum dots, we prepared the photothermal heating curves for different aqueous dispersions of the quantum dots were studied under 532 nm illumination. For the different quantum dots, the mass concentration was adjusted to 50 ppm. With a very low power density (80 mW cm−2), the G/M 3:1 dispersion temperature was increased by 10.6 °C after irradiation for 5 min (see Fig. 6(a)). In contrast, the temperature of pure water increased by only 1.2 °C, indicating that the G/M QDs can rapidly and efficiently convert light into thermal energy. When compared to the G/M QDs solutions, the temperature changes of the GQDs and MQDs individual solutions were less significant under the same laser irradiation conditions. Therefore, the efficiency of photothermal energy conversion was significantly enhanced by coupling of the surface plasmon resonance of the MQDs with the laser reduction of the GQDs.49,50 Moreover, the photothermal effect of G/M 1:1 was higher than the other two G/M QDs, as shown in Fig. 6(b), indicating that the photothermal energy conversion increases with the proportion of MQDs.

(e) The photothermal heating curves for G/M 3:1 under 80 mW cm−2 irradiation (red) and 0.6 W cm−2 irradiation. 
To further assess the photothermal stability of the as-prepared quantum dots, the temperatures of the dispersions upon radiation for 5 min (laser on) were monitored, followed by cooling to room temperature after the light irradiation was removed (laser off). After three cycles, all quantum dot dispersions show high stability and repeatability, as shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). However, the heating rates of the quantum dot dispersions in the latter cycle are much higher than the former one. The reason for this needs to be discussed in our future study. To compare the photothermal effect of the as-prepared quantum dots, with other reported nanoparticles, the power density was increased to 0.6 W cm−2. The photothermal performance is shown in Fig. 6(e), which is better than that found for the previously reported MoS2 nanosheets51 and comparable to a Au–graphene hybrid structure.49
4. Conclusions
We have reported a facile method to prepare graphene and MoS2 quantum dots hybrid nanostructures by combining high-speed shear, sonication and solvothermal treatment of bulk MoS2 and GO in DMF. The as-prepared quantum dots show strong fluorescence, which can be adjusted by changing their mass ratio. The theoretical LODs to NO2 and NH3 were calculated to be 41.4 ppb and 35.5 ppb, respectively, and was attributed to the synergistic effects of the GQDs and MQDs. The prediction of the photothermal enhancement of light irradiation on the remarkable sensing performance was confirmed by the analysis of the photothermal heating curves. Furthermore, this technique may provide a versatile approach to produce a new generation of gas sensing devices.
