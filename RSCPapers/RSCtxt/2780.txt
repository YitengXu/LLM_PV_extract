    , Accepted 16th September 2021First published on 17th September 2021AbstractNi-based nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention as photocatalysts thanks to their high photocatalytic activity and non-toxicity. In this study, a novel visible-light-induced photocatalyst CuMn-LDO/NiS (CMS) was successfully synthesized with high yield and nanostructure. The crystal structure, chemical composition and morphology of the catalysts were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photoelectric properties of the catalysts were analyzed by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electrochemical measurement. The photocatalytic performance of CMS p–p heterojunction was measured under the condition of light. The results showed that when the content of CuMn-LDO was 40%, hydrogen evolution reached 194 μmol, which is about 10 times that of pure CuMn-LDO. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of composite CMS was due to the formation of a p–p heterojunction, which inhibits the recombination of e− and h+, and improves the separation ability of photogenerated carriers.
1 Introduction
At present, due to the aggravation of environmental pollution and energy shortage, the demand for new clean energy is increasing day by day.1–3 Hydrogen is considered to be the most promising energy4–6 due to its advantages, such as high combustion heat value and non-pollution of combustion products to the environment.7,8 Furthermore, combining hydrogen with inexhaustible solar energy could improve the chronic underutilization of solar energy.9,10 Among various studies, photocatalytic decomposition of water for hydrogen production has attracted extensive attention.11–14 In this technology, the focus is to find an affordable, simple preparation, environmental pollution-free photocatalyst.15,16
Bimetal oxides such as ABO2 (A, B = Cr, Al, Ga, Fe, Mn, La, etc.) have good optical properties.17–22 CuMn-LDO has been used in the reduction of CO and NOx, photocatalytic hydrogen production, preparation of supercapacitors and other fields.23 However, NiS has good metal properties and excellent electrical conductivity.24 In the process of photocatalytic decomposition of water, it has higher current density, higher stability, and better performance in an alkaline medium.25 Therefore, it has been given much attention in the fields of photocatalysis and supercapacitors. The combination of CuMn-LDO and the two p-type semiconductor NiS can regulate the electron distribution on the semiconductor surface and expose more active sites to absorb active substances. Moreover, under the action of energy band difference, it can make the photogenerated carrier transfer quickly and improve the effective separation of e− and h+.26 By combining the two semiconductors, the light absorption intensity of NiS and the utilization of light can be improved.
A new type of CMS composites is reported in this paper, whereby the photocatalytic activity of decomposing aquatic hydrogen under visible light irradiation was studied. Based on the relative band positions of the semiconductor CuMn-LDO and NiS, a photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. The chemical, physical and optical properties of the catalysts were studied by XRD, SEM, EDX, BET, XPS, PL and UV-vis spectroscopy. In addition, the catalyst was optimized for photocatalytic hydrogen production, and the effects of the pH of the sacrificial agent, photocatalyst loading amount and EY addition concentration were investigated. Finally, when the loading of CuMn-LDO was 40 mg (CMS-3), the sacrifant pH = 10, and the EY = 24 mg, the hydrogen production effeciency of p-p heterojunction CMS-3 was the best.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
Copper chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), eosin Y (EY, C20H6Br4Na2O5), triethanolamine (TEOA), nickel acetate (Ni(CH3COO)2), ethylene glycol ((CH2OH)2) and thiourea (CH4N2S) were used.
2.2 Synthesis of CuMn-LDO catalyst
Dissolve 5 mmol CuCl2·2H2O and 5 mmol Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O in 60 mL of deionized water. Stir until completely dissolved, adjust the pH of the solution to 11 with 1 mol L−1 NaOH solution, stir for 1 h with a magnetic stirrer, then transfer to a high-pressure reactor lined with polytetrafluoroethylene, and allow it to react at 180 °C 12 h. The reaction product was washed several times with ethanol and water, dried at 60 °C, and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
2.3 Synthesis of NiS catalyst
0.298 g Ni(CH3COO)2 and 0.182 g CH4N2S were dissolved in 70 mL (CH2OH)2 and stirred vigorously for 1 h. Then, the mixture was poured into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and reacted at 180 °C for 12 h. After the autoclave cooled naturally, the product was washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and then dried at 60 °C for 10 h. The product obtained after grinding was NiS.
2.4 Synthesis of CMS catalyst
The composite catalyst CuMn-LDO/NiS was prepared by simple physical methods of ultrasonic treatment and grinding. First, 100 mg of the prepared NiS was dissolved in 60 mL deionized water, and the mixture was stirred. Then, the prepared CuMn-LDO was added. After ultrasonic treatment for 0.5 h and stirring for 0.5 h, the product was completely dissolved, washed with water and ethanol several times, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The product was named CMS. The preparation process of the composite catalyst CMS is shown in Scheme 1.

The composite catalysts were named CMS-1, CMS-2, CMS-3 and CMS-5 by adding 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg CuMn-LDO, respectively.
2.5 Characterizations
The as-prepared catalyst structure was studied by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Rigaku Smartlab) at 10° min−1. The morphologies of CuMn-LDO, NiS, and CMS were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-6701F.JEOL). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was used for analyzing the fabric with JEOL JEM-2100 field emission TEM. The crystal lattice, atomic ratio and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum were obtained. The composition and valence of the elements were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). The N2 adsorption and desorption curves were measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, ASAP 2020M) at 77 K. The photoluminescence (PL) of CuMn-LDO, NiS, and CMS were analyzed using a fluorescence spectrometer (FLUOROMAX-4). UV-vis DRS was analyzed using a UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer with BaSO4 as the reference.
Electrochemical characterization was conducted on a three-electrode electrochemical workstation (Versa Stat 4-400, Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc.). The working electrode was prepared by dispersing 0.01 g of sample and 1 mg of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) into 0.1 mL ethanol, which was stirred, and coated onto an ITO conductive glass (1 cm2 thick), and dried at room temperature. Ag/AgCl served as the reference electrode, and Na2SO4 (0.2 mol L−1) was used as the electrolyte.
2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
The photocatalytic reaction was carried through a circulation system (5 W LED, λ ≥ 420 nm, Perfect Light, PCX50B Discover) in a 62 cm2 closed quartz bottle, and the hydrogen production was monitored online using gas chromatography (Ruili SP-2100, TCD, 13X column, N2 carrier). 10 mg sample was dissolved with a certain amount of eosin (EY) in 30 mL of 10% (v/v) triethanolamine solution (TEOA). Before illumination, ultrasonic dispersion was carried out for 30 min followed by vacuum treatment with N2 to eliminate the influence of air. In the whole process of photocatalysis, the mixed liquid was stirred vigorously to obtain good dispersibility of photocatalyst in the solution. The sample gas was extracted into the chromatograph every 1 h for analysis.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology analysis

Fig. 1(a) shows that pure CuMn-LDO is stacked in irregular sheets with a particle size of about 500 nm. The pure NiS was composed of stacked particles with a diameter of approximately 500 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Flakes and particle stacking can be observed in Fig. 1(c), indicating that the synthesis of the composite catalyst CMS-3 was successful. Fig. 1(d) shows the TEM of CMS-3. Fig. 1(e) is an HRTEM image of CMS-3, in which the lattice spacing of 0.15 nm corresponds to the (−311) plane of CuMn-LDO, while the lattice spacing of 0.17 nm corresponds to the (110) plane of NiS. According to the element mapping, Cu, Mn, O, Ni and S elements were distributed in the composite catalyst CMS-3.

3.2 XRD analysis
From the XRD patterns of the catalysts used, it can be seen that all catalysts have good crystallinity, as shown in Fig. 2(a and b). For pure CuMn-LDO, the diffraction peak corresponded to the monoclinic CuMnO2 (No. 18-448). For NiS, the diffraction peak corresponded well to the hexagonal phase NiS (No. 65-830). In addition, the diffraction peaks of CuMn-LDO and NiS were contained in the composites. With the increase of NiS, the intensity of (102) diffraction peak at 46° increased, indicating that the preparation of the composite catalyst CMS was successful (Fig. 2(c)). According to the crystal plane index a = 5.58, b = 2.877 and c = 5.875 of CuMn-LDO, it was calculated that CuMn-LDO belonged to the monoclinic system and the unit cell coordination unit was 2 (Fig. 2(d)). The crystal plane parameters of NiS, a = 3.4361 and c = 5.29, could be calculated and it was established that NiS belonged to the hexagonal crystal system and the coordination number was 2.

3.3 XPS analysis
In order to study the chemical state of each element in the catalyst, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on the samples. The p–p heterojunction CMS-3 contains Cu, Mn, O, Ni and S elements (Fig. 3(a)). In the high-resolution pattern of Cu 2p (Fig. 3(b)), there were two obvious peaks at 952.1 eV and 932.3 eV, which corresponded to Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2, respectively, and belong to the univalent Cu cation.27–29Fig. 3(c) shows a detailed map of Mn 2p. These binding energies correspond to Mn 2p1/2 (652.8 eV) and Mn 2p3/2 (641.6 eV), respectively, indicating that Mn element existed in the form of Mn3+.30,31 The high-resolution O1s pattern shows two binding energies of 529.8 eV and 531.1 eV, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The binding energy of 531.1 eV corresponds to the surface oxygen (i.e., the absorbed oxygen species and hydroxyl group), while the binding energy of 529.7 eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen.32–34 However, two Ni2+ signals (873.5 eV and 885.8 eV) and two satellite peaks (879.6 eV and 861.6 eV) can be observed in the Ni 2p high-resolution map (Fig. 3(e)).35 In the S 2p high-resolution map (Fig. 3(f)), it can be observed that the two peaks at 168 eV and 162.3 eV correspond to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 of S2−.36,37

3.4 BET analysis
The pore size distribution (Fig. 4(a)) and specific surface area (Fig. 4(b)) of CuMn-LDO, NiS and CMS-3 were obtained by N2 adsorption–desorption measurements. The composite CMS-3 showed strong adsorption capacity, indicating that it was a porous structure. From the BJH pore size distribution, CuMn-LDO, NiS and CMS-3 were mainly mesoporous. The growth trend of BET area and pore volume are as follows: CMS-3 > NiS > CuMn-LDO (Table 1). High specific area and high pore volume can further improve photocatalytic performance.

3.5 Photocatalytic properties of the photocatalyst
In the hydrogen evolution system with TEOA as the sacrificial agent and EY as the sensitizer, the hydrogen evolution property of the prepared samples was evaluated. Evidently, when the pH of TEOA was 10 and the sensitizer EY was 20 mg, the best hydrogen evolution of CMS-3 in 5 h was 194 μmol, which was about 10 times that of pure CuMn-LDO (19 μmol) and about 2 times that of NiS (88 μmol). In addition, increasing or decreasing the loading amount of NiS would bring about the decrease of hydrogen evolution performance in the composite catalyst (Fig. 5(a)). Since acidity and alkalinity affect the solubility of electrons in the sacrificial agent, the amount of sensitizer will affect the transfer of photogenerated electrons.38–41 Therefore, after obtaining the optimum catalyst for CMS-3, we further studied the sacrificial agent of acid–alkali (Fig. 5(b)) and sensitizing agent content (Fig. 5(c)) influence on the performance of catalyst activity of hydrogen evolution; it was concluded that the composite catalyst CMS-3 was the most appropriate in the pH = 10 sacrificial agent and sensitizing agent content of 24 mg system for hydrogen evolution reaction. The sensitizer could absorb photogenerated electrons to promote the catalytic reaction. Excessive sensitizer will mask the active site of the catalyst itself, hence reducing the hydrogen evolution of the system. Good stability is an essential property for the catalyst.42,43 Therefore, we tested the composite catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production for 20 hours in four cycles. The hydrogen production of the catalyst (Fig. 5(d)) decreased slightly after four cycles. We believed that this was on account of the degradation of the sensitizer in the sensitization system under the condition of light, which resulted in the decrease of hydrogen production in the system. By comparing the XRD patterns of the catalysts before and after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5(e)), we found that the crystal phase of the composite catalyst CMS-3 did not change, which indicated that the composite catalyst CMS-3 had good stability.

3.6 PL analysis
The severe combination of photogenerated e− and h+ is one of the key factors to inhibit the photocatalytic reaction.44 The principal stage to improving the property of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is to prevent the recombination of photogenerated e− and h+. PL is an effective method to analyze the charge separation of the photocatalyst. Fig. 6(a) shows that the fluorescence response intensity of EY was the highest, and the diffraction peak intensity decreased after the addition of the catalyst, while the intensity of composite catalyst CMS-3 was the lowest, indicating that the addition of the catalyst inhibited the recombination of e− and h+. Meanwhile, the composite catalyst performed the best in inhibiting this situation. The time-resolved PL of the composite catalysts was analyzed to obtain more carrier information, and the average lifetime of these catalysts was obtained, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The composite catalyst CMS-3 has the longest fluorescence lifetime and can improve the separation rate of e− and h+, thus promoting the photocatalytic reaction.

3.7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra
UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is an effective method to characterize the light absorption properties of catalysts. The optical absorption of the composite catalysts was detected by ultraviolet spectroscopy (Fig. 7(a)). It can be seen that CuMn-LDO has a strong light absorption at 450–650 nm, while NiS has a high light absorption intensity at 350–450 nm. CuMn-LDO and NiS combined to form a composite catalyst, among which CMS-3 has the best light absorption. Therefore, the photocatalytic performance was the best. The bandgap αhν = a(hν − Eg)n/2 (α represents absorption coefficient, h represents Planck's constant, ν represents light frequency, a represents proportionality constant and Eg represents light bandgap energy; the value of n depends on the transition characteristics in the semiconductor) was calculated by the formula.45Fig. 7(b and c) shows the relationship between (αhν)2 and photon energy (hν) of CuMn-LDO and NiS. The bandgaps of CuMn-LDO and NiS were 1.51 eV and 2.07 eV, respectively.

3.8 Electrochemical behavior of the prepared material
The photocurrent densities of CuMn-LDO, NiS, and CMS-3 were measured using transient photocurrent (Fig. 8(a)). It could be observed that the corresponding photocurrent intensity of the composite catalyst CMS-3 was the highest, indicating that the combination of CuMn-LDO and NiS could inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers. The polarization curve (Fig. 8(b)) shows that under the condition of the same current density, the composite catalyst showed the smallest over-potential, indicating that its reducing power was the strongest. In the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 8(c)), the radius of the Nyquist curve of the prepared sample was from small to large: CMS-3 < NiS < CuMn-LDO, indicating that the photogenerated carrier in CMS-3 has the lowest resistance in the process of transmission, which was more conducive to the transfer and improved the separation efficiency of electron and hole.

Fig. 8(d) shows the Mott–Schottky plots of NiS and CuMn-LDO. According to the Mott–Schottky plots, both CuMn-LDO and NiS were p-type semiconductors, and the flat band potentials of CuMn-LDO and NiS at the Ag/AgCl electrode were 1.15 eV and 0.93 eV, respectively. Relative to standard hydrogen electrode ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.20 eV26 were 1.35 eV and 1.13 eV, respectively. We know that the bandgaps of CuMn-LDO and NiS were 1.51 eV and 2.07 eV, respectively. According to the formula ECB = EVB − Eg,46 the conduction band potentials of CuMn-LDO and NiS were −0.16 eV and −0.94 eV, respectively.
3.9 Photocatalytic H2 production mechanism of p–p heterojunction CMS
The bandgap structure, tight coupling and suitable structure arrangement are important factors to determine the performance of heterojunction. Based on Tauc Plots (Fig. 7(b and c)) and Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 8(d)), the band structure of CMS was determined (Fig. 9) to explore its possible photocatalytic mechanism. When the composite catalyst CMS was exposed to light, the EY absorbed on its surface was excited to the single excited state EY1*, and the unstable EY1* would transition to the stable triple excited state EY3*. EY3* participates in the reduction reaction of the sacrificial agent to obtain electron conversion to EY−*. EY−* would lose electrons in the process of conversion to the EY molecule. The lost e− were transferred to the conduction band (CB) of CuMn-LDO to participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction. On the other hand, illumination would stimulate the electrons in the semiconductor to transition from the valence band (VB) guide band, and the electrons of NiS would be excited to the CB and continue to migrate to the VB of the CuMn-LDO and participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction together with the electrons lost during the formation of EY molecule and the electrons from the VB transition of CuMn-LDO. The holes left in the VB of CuMn-LDO would be transferred to the VB of NiS and consumed by the sacrificial agent TEOA. Therefore, the p–p heterojunction CMS inhibited the recombination of e− and h+ and improved the property of photocatalytic hydrogen production.

4 Conclusion
CuMn-LDO was successfully loaded onto NiS to form a p–p heterojunction. The 5 hour photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of CMS-3 composites was 194 μmol, which was 10 times that of pure CuMn-LDO. The high yield of hydrogen may be attributed to the following aspects: the introduction of CuMn-LDO provided a higher specific surface area for photocatalytic reaction; the p–p heterojunction can greatly enhance the carrier separation efficiency, accelerate the charge transfer at the interface, and inhibit electron–hole recombination; in addition, under light irradiation, CuMn-LDO could enhance the light absorption intensity and expand the response intensity of the spectrum to the visible region. All these characteristics may be the reasons for the improvement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of CMS-3 composites. We consider that this work will provide a new idea for the synthesis of bimetallic oxides and transition metal sulfides for photocatalytic hydrogen production.
