    , Accepted 26th July 2015First published on 29th July 2015AbstractA type of freestanding, light-weight eggshell membrane-based electrode is demonstrated for supercapacitors and for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. As a widely available daily waste, eggshell membranes have unique porous three-dimensional grid-like fibrous structures with relatively high surface area and abundant macropores, allowing for effective conjugation of carbon nanotubes and growth of NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays, an effective supercapacitor material and OER catalyst. The three-dimensional fibrous eggshell membrane frameworks with carbon nanotubes offer efficient pathways for charge transport, and the macropores between adjacent fibers are fully accessible for electrolytes and bubble evolution. As a supercapacitor, the eggshell membrane/carbon nanotube/NiCo2O4 electrode shows high specific capacitances at current densities from 1 to 20 A g−1, with excellent capacitance retention (>90%) at 10 A g−1 for over 10000 cycles. When employed as an OER catalyst, this eggshell membrane-based electrode exhibits an OER onset potential of 1.53 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a stable catalytic current density of 20 mA cm−2 at 1.65 V vs. the RHE.
Introduction
Natural biological materials with three-dimensional (3D) diverse and unique structures, such as leaves,1 hemps,2 celluloses,3 hairs4 and crab shells,5 enable substantial inspiration for the development of electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies. The 3D complex architectures of these biological materials endow them with strong adaptability and specific functionality to external physical and chemical stimuli.6 Among them, the eggshell membrane (ESM) represents one common source extensively available from daily waste, while also having a unique 3D grid-like fibrous organic framework, abundant macropores, and flexibility.7 These naturally designed 3D interwoven fibrous frameworks and pores serve as functional supports for the breathing and growing environment of embryos. In addition, the protein fibers can provide functional groups to reduce the metal ions into the nanoparticles in situ,8 or serve nitrogen and oxygen atoms as natural resources for elemental doping to enhance the electronic conductivity.9
The applications of ESMs have previously been focused on biotemplates for growth of metal nanoparticles such as Au and Ag,10,11 sorbents for heavy metal ions or organic dyes,12,13 and biosensors.14 Recently, there have been several exciting studies using ESMs as electronic materials for energy applications.9,15,16 For example, after coating with sucrose and carbonizing, ESMs were used as counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), in which the hierarchically porous structured carbonized ESMs effectively facilitated the charge-transfer process, exhibiting an enhanced open-circuit voltage and a photoconversion efficiency comparable to DSSCs with Pt counter electrodes.15 Carbonized ESMs have also been shown as electrode materials for Li–S batteries,16 or electric double-layer capacitor electrodes,9 with resistances of one order of magnitude lower than commercial activated carbon, allowing for a higher specific capacitance. Nonetheless, several significant challenges still exist for ESM-based electrodes. First, the conductivity of the carbonized ESMs, even pre-coated with sucrose or mixed with a conductive paint, is still suboptimal, resulting in a sharp decrease of the energy storage capacities even at a medium current density of 1 A g−1 for supercapacitors.9 Second, the intrinsic specific surface area of the carbonized ESMs is reported in the range of 20–200 m2 g−1, which is lower than those of other nanoscale carbon materials, such as mesoporous carbon,17,18 carbon nanotubes19–21 and graphene,22–24 thus limiting their capability of surface electrochemical reactions. Third, previous reports have predominantly used ESMs in the ground powder form coated onto another current collector, such as glassy carbon discs9 or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO),15 which hinders the potential of developing light-weight energy devices. More importantly, the 3D long-range architecture of the original interwoven fibrous structures and macropores are not maintained in powder form, thus reducing the structural uniqueness of this biological template for efficient electron and ion transport.
Herein, we developed a freestanding 3D carbonized ESM composite coated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and NiCo2O4 nanowires (NWs), designated as ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4, as a superior candidate for supercapacitors and for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. The unique 3D fibrous framework of the carbonized ESM with macropores provides a large surface area for the CNT loading and NiCo2O4 growth, enabling efficient material-electrolyte contact, catalytic activity and bubble evolution. The low loading amount of the CNTs on the 3D ESM framework can effectively enhance its charge transport capability, leading to a high rate capability for supercapacitive energy storage and excellent OER current density. The hydrothermally grown crystalline NiCo2O4 NWs allow for large surface areas as the main electrochemically reactive sites for charge storage and OER activity. Furthermore, this freestanding composite can directly serve as an electrode and waive the need for additional current collectors or adhesive reagents, thus suggesting a highly attractive electrode candidate for light-weighted energy device applications. As proofs-of-concept, the freestanding ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 NW composite electrodes showed superior capacitance and cycling stability as supercapacitors, and low onset potential and high current density as OER catalysts.
Experimental
Preparation of ESM/CNT and ESM
Pristine ESMs were obtained from etching off the hard shell of eggshells by 1 M HCl, followed by rinsing thoroughly with deionized (DI) water and isopropanol alcohol (IPA), respectively. 1 mg of CNTs pre-grafted with –COOH (Beijing Boyu Technology Ltd, China) was dispersed in 40 mL ethanol to form a dispersion mixture. An ESM was immersed into the dispersion under ultrasonic treatment for 20 min. After that, the ESM/CNT was carbonized in nitrogen at 800 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 1 °C min−1. The mass of the whole ESM coupled with the CNTs was ∼155 mg, which dropped to ∼46.5 mg after carbonization. Pure carbonized ESM substrates were prepared in a similar method, but without the addition of CNTs.
Growth of NiCo2O4 NWs on the ESM/CNT and ESM
In a typical process, 2 mmol Ni(NO3)·6H2O, 4 mmol Co(NO3)·6H2O and 24 mmol urea were dissolved into 40 mL of DI water and 40 mL ethanol to form a transparent pink solution. The solution was then transferred to a capped bottle. After putting a piece of ESM/CNT or ESM into the solution, the bottle was then capped and heated to 85 °C in an oven for 6 h. Afterwards, the ESM was taken out and rinsed with DI water thoroughly, dried at 60 °C, and then annealed in air at 250 °C for 2 h, with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. NiCo2O4 NWs grown on Ni foams or CNT buckypaper (Nanjing Jicang Nanotechnology Ltd, China) were also prepared with the same conditions for comparison, in which the Ni foams were cleaned by immersion in 3 M HCl for 15 min before use.
Electrochemical measurements of supercapacitors
Electrochemical measurements were carried out with a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument, USA) in a three-electrode system using 6 M KOH as the electrolyte, and NiCo2O4 NWs grown on the ESM/CNT, ESM, Ni foam or CNT buckypaper were used as the working electrodes. The working electrodes of ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4, ESM/NiCo2O4 and CNT/NiCo2O4 were prepared by connection with a Cu wire by soldering with silver paste and epoxy resin adhesive. Pt foil and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The specific capacitance was calculated from the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves according to the equation: C = It/ΔV, where C (F g−1) is the specific capacitance, I (A g−1) represents the discharge current density, t (s) is the discharge time and ΔV is the potential drop during discharge.25 The electrochemical impedance tests were carried out with a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz using a perturbation amplitude of 5 mV.
OER catalytic measurements
The OER tests were performed with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D, CH Instrument, USA). Pt foil and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 1 M KOH solution was used as the electrolyte. All potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale and the current density was standardized to a geometrical surface area. The catalytic performance was measured by linear sweeping from 1 to 2 V (vs. RHE) with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Tafel slopes were calculated based on the following equation: η = blogj, where η is the onset potential, j is the current density, and b is the Tafel slope.26
Results and discussion
Process for the synthesis of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 composite
The synthesis of the freestanding ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 NWs involves three main steps (Fig. 1 and Experimental section). First, a complete, freestanding ESM is obtained by acid etching off the surrounding hard eggshell. Second, the ESM is incubated in a diluted ethanol solution of CNTs with sonication, followed by high-temperature calcination in an argon atmosphere to remove water and the organic molecules of the ESM, resulting in an ESM/CNT composite. Finally, NiCo2O4 NW arrays are hydrothermally synthesized on the ESM/CNT substrate to obtain the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 composite, in which these three main components form a layered, interwoven framework for efficient electron transport, while the pores between the adjacent NiCo2O4 NWs and ESM fibers provide pathways for electrolyte access and bubble release.

Structure and composition characterizations
The photographs of the freestanding ESM and ESM/CNT composites are shown in Fig. 2a and b. After its release from the eggshell, the ESM can still maintain a well-preserved morphology, while the size and volume are much smaller than the original eggshell. After calcination, the size of the ESM/CNT composite further shrinks to one-third of that before calcination, accompanied with a mass loss of ∼70%, indicating the removal of water and organic molecules and shrinking of the fibrous frameworks. Nonetheless, the freestanding morphology can still be well maintained, and can also be tailored into arbitrary shapes, such as truncated cylinders or rectangles (Fig. 2b). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the freestanding pristine ESM has a 3D grid-like structure, with a total membrane thickness of ∼12 μm and a fibrous skeleton diameter of 1–2 μm (Fig. 2c and S1a, ESI†). After loading with CNTs and calcination, the ESM/CNT composite exhibits a similar but much rougher 3D framework, where the surface of the ESM fibers are coated by a layer of CNTs (Fig. 2d and e). Further growth of the NiCo2O4 leads to the formation of 1D NW arrays, which are uniformly covered on the surface of the skeleton of the ESM/CNT composite (Fig. 2f). The length and diameter of the NiCo2O4 NWs are about 1 μm and 20–30 nm, respectively (Fig. 2g). For comparison, NiCo2O4 NWs grown on pure ESM, Ni foam and CNT buckypaper substrates (denoted as ESM/NiCo2O4, Ni foam/NiCo2O4 and CNT/NiCo2O4, respectively) under similar hydrothermal conditions are also displayed (Fig. S1b and c, ESI†), which present similar NW morphologies compared to that of the freestanding ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 composite. Nonetheless, the mass loadings of the NiCo2O4 NWs grown on ESM or ESM/CNT substrates are substantially larger (>10 times) than that grown on the Ni foams of similar volumes, which are attributed to the much larger pore size and smaller surface area of the Ni foams (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that the NiCo2O4 NWs are composed of polycrystalline nanoparticles, with an average size of 10–20 nm (Fig. 3a and b). The lattice fringes of 0.24 and 0.20 nm correspond to the (311) and (400) crystal planes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 and the ESM/CNT composites further confirm the formation of the NiCo2O4 phase (Fig. 3c). Six diffraction peaks at 18.9°, 31.1°, 36.6°, 44.6°, 59.1° and 64.9° are well indexed to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) planes of the spinel NiCo2O4 crystalline structure (PDF card No. 20-0781), respectively. No other peaks are observed, indicating high purity of the product. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms that the atomic ratio of Ni and Co is 1:2 (Fig. S2, ESI†), which is in good accord with the XRD results. Nitrogen sorption measurement shows that the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 present a type-IV shape with a hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of mesopores ranging from 4 to 20 nm (Fig. 3d and inset). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 composite is calculated as 264.7 m2 g−1, which is much larger than that of the pure calcinated ESM (∼167 m2 g−1, Fig. S3, ESI†).

Supercapacitor application
The capability of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 composite for the use as a supercapacitor was first investigated. Cycle voltammetry (CV) measurements carried out in a three-electrode cell (Experimental section) show that the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 composite exhibits several distinct Faradic peaks in the potential range of −0.2–0.6 V in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 4a). The redox peaks arise from Faradaic redox reactions, which are associated with the conversion between M–O and M–O–OH (M represents Ni or Co).25,27 CV measurements of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 and Ni foam/NiCo2O4 (i.e., NiCo2O4 directly grown on the carbonized ESM/CNT or Ni foam, respectively) show similar peak positions, while the current density of the ESM/NiCo2O4 sample is much lower than the other three samples, suggesting that the surface coating of the CNTs can substantially enhance the conductivity of the ESMs, to be comparable with Ni foams. A series of CV curves measured on the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 composite with different scan rates from 5 to 60 mV s−1 are also displayed (Fig. 4b). As the sweep rate increases, the positions of the redox peaks shift from −0.04 to 0.06 V for cathodic half cycles and 0.28 to 0.42 V for anodic half cycles. The peak current densities follow a linear dependence on the square-root of the sweep rates (Fig. S4, ESI†), indicating that the main electrochemical process is limited by the diffusion-controlled kinetics.28,29

Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 were then conducted between 0 and 0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), with the current densities varied from 1 to 20 A g−1 (Fig. 4c). The charge–discharge curves show typical symmetric features at all current densities, suggesting a high coulombic efficiency and low polarization of the electrode.28 A plateau at 0.25 V on the charging branch and another plateau at 0.20 V at the discharging branch are observed, consistent with the CV curves and previous literature.27,30 The capacitances and rate capabilities of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4, ESM/NiCo2O4, Ni foam/NiCo2O4 and CNT/NiCo2O4 composites are plotted with different current densities for comparison (Fig. 4d). It is worth mentioning that the calculation of specific capacitance is based on the mass of active NiCo2O4 NW material, due to the negligible contribution of the three substrates (Fig. S5, ESI†). At a low current density of 1 A g−1, the specific capacitances of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4, ESM/NiCo2O4 Ni foam/NiCo2O4 and CNT/NiCo2O4 electrodes are 942, 888, 820 and 866 F g−1, respectively, which are comparable to each other (Fig. 4d). A sharp decrease of the capacitance is observed for the ESM/NiCo2O4 composite, which drops to 638 and 50 F g−1 at current densities of 2 and 20 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 4d, blue curve). In contrast, the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 and Ni foam/NiCo2O4 composites show a slow decrease of their specific capacitances with an increase of the current density, and capacitances are retained at 653 and 404 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, corresponding to 69% and 48% of their values at 1 A g−1 current density, respectively (Fig. 4d, red and black curves). The CNT/NiCo2O4 sample presents a comparable specific capacitance at current densities lower than 8 A g−1, but drops sharply to a low value of 182 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, indicating the inferiority of the CNT buckypaper as a current collector compared to the metallic Ni foam and the 3D interwoven porous ESM/CNT structures. Furthermore, the porous 3D fibrous structured ESM/CNT substrate shows a better performance even compared to that of the 3D Ni metal foam at the same current density, suggesting a synergetic effect between the metal oxide and ESM/CNT substrate that is similar to previous reports on carbon-coated metal oxides.31 These results indicate that the CNT incorporation enables a more efficient charge transport on the ESM fibrous framework, and further suggest that the 3D architecture realized by the unique, dense 3D fibrous frameworks with abundant macropores is beneficial for both the electrolyte penetration and efficient surface ion insertion, especially at high current densities.
The cycling stability of the freestanding ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrode is further investigated by the galvanostatic method at a current density of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 4e). A high stable capacitance of 675 F g−1 is obtained after 10000 repeated charge–discharge cycles, corresponding to a 90% retention of its initial value. The coulombic efficiency for each cycle is over 94%, suggesting its high reversibility. It should be noted that the freestanding ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrode has much less weight compared to Ni foam with similar volume, which can be substantially attractive in high power and energy density supercapacitor applications. For instance, when considering the whole mass of the fabricated electrodes (the mass of the substrates for loading the same mass of 1 mg of active NiCo2O4 is 16 and 37 mg for ESM/CNT and Ni foam, respectively), the freestanding ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrode presents a specific capacitance of 38 F g−1 at 10 A g−1, which is almost 3 times higher than that of the Ni foam/NiCo2O4 electrode under the same conditions (Fig. S6, ESI†). Moreover, the Ragone plot of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrode shows that with the increase of the power density from 0.24 to 4.8 kW kg−1, the energy density changes from 26.5 to 18.4 Wh kg−1. With slow and fast charge–discharge rates, an energy density of 4.8 kW kg−1 and a high power density of 26.5 Wh kg−1 are achieved, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). These results confirm the advantages of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 composite with both light-weight and high loading efficiency of the electroactive materials.
The ion and electron transport performances of these electrodes are further characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Nyquist plots obtained from EIS are exhibited, and fitted with an equivalent circuit (Fig. 4f and S8, ESI†). Among the fitted parameters, Rs represents the resistance between the electrolyte and the internal resistance of the electrode.32 Both the ESM/NiCo2O4 and CNT/NiCo2O4 electrodes present larger Rs values of 15 and 11.3 Ω. In comparison, the Rs values of the Ni foam/NiCo2O4 and the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrodes are 0.7 and 2.6 Ω, respectively, indicating that the CNT incorporation enhances the electrolyte penetration through the whole ESM framework. Another significant fitted parameter is Rct (charge transfer resistance), which describes the rate of the redox reactions at the interfaces of the electrode and the electrolyte.32 Compared to the ESM/NiCo2O4 electrode with a Rct of 1.55 Ω, the Rct values of the Ni foam/NiCo2O4 and the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrodes are 0.2 and 0.44 Ω respectively, indicating efficient charge transport and redox reactions at the electrode and electrolyte interfaces.
OER performance
Moreover, as the freestanding ESM/CNT substrate possesses a unique 3D interwoven fibrous structure, dense catalyst loading, and excellent electrochemical activity with the surface-grown NiCo2O4 NWs, it also enables the use of a promising catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Linear scan voltammogram measurements were conducted in a three-electrode configuration in 1 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 5a and Experimental section). Comparative studies were carried out for the ESM, ESM/CNT and Ni foam substrates, as well as their corresponding composites with surface-grown NiCo2O4 NWs (Fig. 5b and S9, ESI†). The ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrode exhibits the smallest onset potential of 1.54 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) among these electrodes (∼1.57 V for the Ni foam/NiCo2O4 and CNT/NiCo2O4 and 1.59 V for the ESM/NiCo2O4). This onset potential corresponds to a low overpotential of 310 mV, comparable to the previously reported porous N-doped graphene/NiCo2O4 hybrid based electrode (∼310 mV overpotential),26 indicating the capability of using the freestanding ESM/CNT substrate for the loading of OER catalysts. Moreover, the catalytic current density of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrode is ∼20 mA cm−2 at 1.65 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to that of the Ni foam/NiCo2O4 (18.5 mA cm−2) and much larger than the ESM/NiCo2O4 and CNT/NiCo2O4 electrodes (5.8 and 11.5 mA cm−2, respectively). The Tafel slope of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrode is calculated to be 158 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5c), much lower than those of the ESM/NiCo2O4 (273 mV dec−1), Ni foam/NiCo2O4 (242 mV dec−1) and the CNT/NiCo2O4 (194 mV dec−1) electrodes, suggesting more favorable kinetics of the electrochemical reactions on the 3D freestanding ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrode with interwoven fibrous and porous frameworks. The current density retention is about 92.5% after 10 hours of continuous OER testing at 1.65 V vs. the RHE (Fig. 5d), revealing the excellent electrochemical stability of the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 electrode.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a freestanding, 3D interwoven carbon fibrous framework with abundant porosity and excellent conductivity, which is obtained from daily waste eggshell membranes. The ESMs, after coating with CNTs and carbonization, can serve as light-weight, excellent current collectors for loading of the electroactive NiCo2O4 NWs for both supercapacitors and OER catalysts. Specifically, the ESM/CNT/NiCo2O4 NW composite electrode exhibits attractive features, including a large surface area, high specific capacitance and superior cycling stability for supercapacitors, and low onset potential and fast kinetics for OER catalysis. Moreover, the versatile ESM/CNT composite is synthesized by facile procedures and using low-cost daily waste as starting materials, which can not only release environmental pressures but also inspire more opportunities for the development of new electrochemical materials for energy storage and catalytic conversion applications.
