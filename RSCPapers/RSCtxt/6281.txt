Three types of ZnO-NWAs were grown using a multi-batch process, continuous flow injection (CFI) process, and NH3-assisted CFI process. ZnO-NWAs grown by the CFI process are suitable as photoanodes of DSSCs because of their strong optical and structural properties. In addition, the transit time of ZnO-NWAs grown using an NH3-assisted CFI process was determined to be approximately 0.11 ms. In previous studies, the transit time and electron recombination lifetime were used to determine the collection efficiency (ηCC). For effective improvement of ηCC, a short transit time is needed. However, the transit time is significantly dependent on the photoanode thickness (or length) of ZnO-NWAs. To address this issue, a short (approximately 2.5 μm) ZnO-NWA photoanode was fabricated using the batch process. When analyzing the transport properties, the transit time was found to have decreased from 0.57 ms to 40 μs when the thickness of the ZnO-NWA photoanode was reduced from 10 to 2.5 μm, although they had similar diffusion coefficients (approximately 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 s−1). The diffusion coefficient better demonstrates the electron transport properties of photoanodes. The diffusion coefficient of ZnO-NWAs fabricated using an NH3-assisted CFI process was 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1. This is currently the highest value of ZnO-NWA photoanodes. A 25 μm ZnO-NWA was fabricated using the NH3-assisted CFI process as a photoanode of a DSSC, and the conversion efficiency was 3.92%. Compared with previous studies using long ZnO-NWAs DSSCs, the conversion efficiency of this study was effectively improved. The dye-loading amount increases with the length of ZnO-NWA photoanodes because of the high absorption area. However, the diffusion coefficient must be increased simultaneously to maintain the same collection efficiency.1. IntroductionO'Regan and Gratzel's 1991 report on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that combined high areas of nanoparticle photoelectrodes with a redox shuttle (iodide/triiodide) constituted a remarkable performance and design breakthrough. The most promising variants were characterized by monochromatic incident photo-to-current efficiencies (IPCE).1,2 IPCE = LHE(λ)ηinjηCC(1)The IPCE is a collective measure of the efficiencies (η) of three key cell processes: photons are harvested by dye molecules, and electron–hole pairs are generated. Subsequently, the electrons are injected into the conduction band of the photoelectrodes, diffused throughout the photoelectrodes, and are then collected in an anode charge collector. Although photon harvesting by adsorbed dye molecules is determined by the surface area of photoelectrodes, diffusion is the major mechanism for electron transport through the nanoparticle film, and multiple trapping/detrapping events occurring within grain boundaries result in slower electron transport rates.3,4 Because electrons in the photoelectrode would be lost by recombination with oxidized dyes or I3− in the electrolyte, the electron transit time for diffusion through the photoelectrode to the collection electrode should be much faster than the electron lifetime to achieve an efficient DSSC. The electron collection efficiency (ηCC) is determined by the electron transport properties inside the photoelectrode. Assuming that injected electrons are the sum of electrons collected on collection electrodes and electrons lost by recombination, and the rate constants for these processes are independent of each other, ηCC is given by (2)where JSC, Jinj, and Jrec are the short-circuit current density, the electron injection current density, and the recombination current density, respectively; τd is the electron transit time, and τn is the electron recombination lifetime. Eqn (2) may improve the collection efficiency, and electrons may be transported inside the photoelectrodes with short transit times and a long lifetime.Various transparent metal-oxide semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2 have become the most common photoelectrodes for sensitized solar cells. Compared to TiO2, ZnO has similar electrochemical and optical properties and may be obtained by simpler (and less expensive) preparative routes.5,6 In addition, the diffusion constant quantity in macroscopic ZnO single crystals may be calculated from the electron mobility of 200 cm2 V−1 s−1 (300 K) to be approximately 5.2 cm2 s−1.7 For ZnO nanoparticles film, Meulenkamp et al. reported the diffusion constants between 2.5 × 10−3 and 2.5 × 10−5 cm2 s−1.8 When electrons diffuse through the sintered nanoparticle film by a series of interparticle hopping steps, they undergo between 103 to 106 hops before reaching the collection electrode.9 Electrons within 1D nanowires or nanorods are highly mobile. Wu et al. recently reported that the electron transit time of ZnO nanowire array (ZnO-NWA) DSSCs approached 47 μs, which is shorter than the electron transit time inside TiO2 nanoparticle photoelectrodes (approximately 1–10 ms).10Because of the superior transport properties of ZnO-NWA photoelectrodes, researchers have proposed many methods to grow high aspect ratio ZnO-NWAs as photoelectrodes to provide high dye adsorption surface areas. Law et al. proposed a solution-based seeded process to grow a sufficiently dense array of long and oriented ZnO-NWAs as photoelectrodes, and to investigate the performance of DSSCs. A long ZnO-NWA may increase dye adsorption while maintaining efficient carrier collection.11 To boost the aspect ratio of ZnO-NWA, a cationic polyelectrolyte, polyethylenimine (PEI), was used to hinder the lateral growth of the nanowires in solution while maintaining a relatively high nanowire density. The longest ZnO-NWA of 20–25 μm was presented, and the conversion efficiency of solar cells constructed with this photoelectrode was 1.2–1.5%. Baxter et al. used a multiple refresh hydrothermal method for growing long ZnO-NWAs.12 Because the reactant concentrations and precursor supersaturation decreased with reaction time through a batch-type hydrothermal process, a multiple refresh method for the precursor solution was used to increase the length of the ZnO-NWA. However, the efficiency of solar cells was lower, at approximately 0.3%. Xu et al. recently proposed moderately reducing the degree of supersaturation of the hydrothermal solution for long ZnO-NWA photoelectrodes. They introduced ammonium hydroxide and PEI to the system. Ammonium hydroxide may form complexes of ammonium hydroxide-zinc ions (Zn(NH3)n2+, n = 1, 2, 3, or 4) and continuously supplies Zn2+ while lowering the degree of supersaturation of the reaction system. Avoiding a high concentration of ammonium hydroxide is required. PEI was used to further suppress the homogeneous nucleation process. The ZnO nanowire arrays of 35 μm as the photoelectrodes of solar cells had a conversion efficiency of approximately 2.1%.13Using high aspect ratio ZnO-NWA as photoanodes may provide high dye adsorption areas, where electrons may be transported rapidly towards the collection electrode. However, the conversion efficiencies remain low. This study proposes a convenient method to synthesize long ZnO-NWAs as photoelectrodes. Additionally, charge transport properties such as electron transient times, lifetimes, and diffusion coefficients of ZnO-NWAs were subsequently investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The influence of charge transport properties of the long ZnO-NWAs on the performance of DSSCs has been discussed.2. Experimental2.1 Synthesis of ZnO nanowire array photoelectrodesIn this study, there are three types of ZnO-NWAs prepared as photoelectrodes of solar cells to consider the influence of transport properties on the performance of solar cells. (1) Multi-batch process: ZnO-NWAs were synthesized on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate with seed layer. The seed layer on ITO glass substrate was prepared using a drop-coating method in a 0.5 mM ethanol solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, 99.5%, Merck). Multiple drop-coating was needed for a dense seed layer on the ITO glass substrate. The dense seed layer was annealed at 500 °C in air for 60 min to form a ZnO nanocrystalline layer. ZnO-NWAs were grown on the seed layer using a hydrothermal method in a 0.02 M aqueous solution of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4, HMTA, ACROS) at 90 °C for 4 h. Because nanowire growth slowed after this period, substrate was repeatedly introduced to the fresh solution in order to obtain long ZnO-NWAs (total reaction time of up to 24 h). The resulting ZnO nanowire arrays were rinsed with DI-water to remove any residual organics. (2) Continuous flow injection (CFI) process: the seed layer preparation method was the same as for the multi-batch process. In this method, 0.02 M Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and HMTA aqueous solutions were prepared separately at room temperature. Peristaltic pumps were used to deliver each of the room temperature aqueous precursors into the mixer, and the mixed solution was subsequently added to the reaction chamber through 3 mm ID MASTERFLEX silicone tubing (Platinum). The pumping flow rates were controlled at 2.0 mL min−1. The substrate faced downwards in the reactor and the CFI process was maintained for 24 h. The resulting ZnO-NWAs were rinsed with DI-water to remove any residual organics. The CFI process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. (3) Ammonia assisted continuous flow injection (NH3-assisted CFI) process: for controlling the supersaturation of the CFI process, a small amount of ammonia was added to adjust the pH value to around 10.8. The other growth conditions are the same as the CFI process. All of the as-grown ZnO-NWAs were annealed further in air at 200 °C for 30 min before dye loading. Fig. 1  Schematic figure of continuous flow injection (CFI) apparatus. Reservoir A and reservoir B are aqueous solutions of zinc acetate dihydrate and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), respectively. 2.2 ZnO nanowire arrays solar cell constructionZnO-NWAs dye-sensitized solar cells were prepared by adsorbing cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bistetrabutylammonium (N719) dye onto the nanowire surfaces. The photoanodes were annealed to 200 °C before immersing into 0.1 mM ethanolic dye solution for 45 min at 75 °C for all ZnO based photoanodes to avoid dye aggregation. The dye was purchased from Solaronix S. A. and was used without further purification. The counter electrode was an F:SnO2 substrate with a Pt layer deposited by sputtering. The electrodes were separated by a 60 μm polypropylene spacer and pressed together with binder clips. Electrolyte was introduced between the electrodes by capillary forces. The electrolyte consisted of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN). The active electrode area was typically 0.25 cm2. Before current density–voltage measurement, masking is required to avoid optical artifacts in the conducting glass used as top electrode, which inflate the photocurrent resulting in overestimating of the conversion efficiencies.3. InstrumentationThe morphologies of the ZnO-NWAs were obtained using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-4700, 15 KV). A Micro-Raman (μ-Raman) spectroscope (BWII-UniRam) with a 532 nm diode laser and a micro-photoluminescence (μ-PL) system with a quasi-continuous wave Ne–Cu laser (248 nm, 1–20 Hz) were integrated by Protrustech Corporation Limited. An Andor iDus CCD with 1024 × 128 pixels was used to capture the μ-Raman and μ-PL signals. The photocurrent density (J) and photovoltage (V) of the cell were measured with ZnO-NWA photoelectrodes having an area of 0.25 cm2 under AM 1.5 G simulation sunlight which was produced by a 150 W Class A Solar Simulator (Model 92250A, Oriel) with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The incident light intensity was calibrated by a standard crystalline silicon solar cell (Oriel reference cell, 91550V). A power source meter (Keithley 2400) was used to measure the response of the solar cells. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra have been measured using an AUTOLAB PGSTAT 302N potentiostat with frequency response analyzer (FRA) module operating in two-electrode configuration. Measurements have been carried out under the illumination of AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2 at the applied bias of open-circuit voltage (VOC). The AC single was used with an amplitude of 50 mV and frequency range from 0.5 Hz to 100 kHz. Zview equivalent circuit modeling software was used to fit the data by using a built-in extended element (DX type 11-Bisquert #2), which allows for transmission line modeling.4. Results and discussionThree types of ZnO-NWA photoanodes were fabricated under three growth conditions using two different processes: the multi-batch process and the CFI process. The growth conditions of ZnO-NWAs are shown in Table 1. Three types of ZnO-NWAs were prepared using (A1) Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and HMTA without an additional reagent using the multi-batch process, (A2) by using the CFI process, and (A3) by using Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and HMTA and using the NH3-assisted CFI process. (A4) A short length of ZnO-NWA was prepared through the batch process and was used as the control experiment in this work. The morphologies of ZnO-NWAs are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d). Well-aligned ZnO-NWAs with a diameter between 50 and 100 nm were formed on the ITO substrate. The lengths of all ZnO-NWAs were controlled to approximately ±10 μm after a 24 h growth period. In addition, the ZnO-NWAs which were grown on ITO through the batch and CFI processes, exhibit a density of approximately 109 cm−2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). SEM analysis showed that the morphologies of ZnO-NWAs grown using the multi-batch and CFI processes were similar.

To understand the differences among A1, A2, and A3, room temperature microphotoluminescence (μ-PL) spectra were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The μ-PL spectra of A1–A3 are shown by a UV peak at 378 nm and an orange-red emission centered at 620 nm. The UV peak is attributed to radiative excitonic recombination,14 and the orange-red emission is attributed to radiative transitions involving the defect-related energy levels located in the band gap.15,16 Previous research assumed that the orange-red emission involved interstitial oxygen ions (Oi), which are found in ZnO grown by the hydrothermal method.17 For the multi-batch process, the ZnO-NWAs exhibited a strong and broad orange-red emission, and the PL intensity ratio of UV emissions to visible emissions was low, which indicated the presence of a high density of defects in the ZnO-NWAs. In contrast to the multi-batch process, the visible band emission of ZnO-NWAs grown by the CFI process was suppressed. The PL intensity ratio of the UV emission to the visible emission was higher than that of ZnO-NWAs grown by multi-batch processes. The intensity ratio of the UV-visible emissions revealed the optical qualities of the ZnO-NWAs. The intensity of the visible band emission of ZnO-NWAs grown by the NH3-assisted CFI process was observed to be lower than ZnO-NWAs grown by the CFI process. To fundamentally understand thermal and electrical properties, precise knowledge of the vibrational modes of the crystal, which are related to the mechanical properties, is required. The vibrational properties of ZnO-NWAs, analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy (μ-Raman), are shown in Fig. 3(b). In Fig. 3(b), no significant differences in E1(TO), A1(TO), 2E2(M), and E2(H) mode frequencies were observed among A1, A2, and A3. With the E2(H) peak normalized, the integrated intensity of the A1(LO)/E1(LO) mode of ZnO-NWAs prepared by the multi-batch process (A1) was higher than that prepared by the CFI process (A2), as shown in Fig. 3(b). This peak was attributed to a defect-induced band, which was reported to be markedly dependent on oxygen stoichiometry.17,18 For ZnO-NWAs grown using the NH3-assisted CFI process (A3), the μ-Raman spectrum is different from (A1) and (A2). From a previous Raman analysis, N-doped ZnO thin film revealed distinct additional modes at 275 cm−1, 510 cm−1, 582 cm−1, and 643 cm−1.19,20 These new peaks are attributed to nitrogen local vibrational modes (LVMs).21 Fig. 3  (a) Micro-PL spectra of A1–A3 under the excitation of a quasi-cw Ne–Cu laser at 248 nm and (b) Raman spectra of A1–A3. The arrows indicate the nitrogen related local vibrational modes (LVMs). The three types of ZnO-NWAs were employed as photoanodes of DSSCs. The performances of these DSSCs (A1–A3) were measured under 1 Sun AM 1.5 simulated sunlight. The photocurrent density–voltage characteristics of DSSCs (A1–A3) are shown in Fig. 4(a). The photovoltaic parameters of these cells are shown in Table 2. Among the three cells, their efficiency (η) is in the order of A3 (η = 2.41%) > A2 (η = 1.84%) > A1 (η = 1.62%). To realize the influencing factor on the DSSC performances of A1–A3, electron transport properties were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS measurements were conducted under 1 Sun AM 1.5 simulated sunlight. Fig. 4(b) shows the Nyquist plots of the impedance data of A1–A3 under illumination at the applied bias of VOC. Bisquert et al. analyzed the charge-transfer resistance at various interfaces in DSSCs.22–24 Accordingly, an equivalent circuit representing ZnO-NWA DSSCs is shown in Fig. 4(c), and the results are the solid lines shown in Fig. 4(b). In this circuit, the electron transport and recombination characteristics of ZnO-NWAs are interpreted using the transmission line model.22,25 (3) Fig. 4  (a) Current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of ZnO-NWA DSSCs of A1–A4; (b) Nyquist plots of the impedance data of ZnO-NWA DSSCs of A1–A4.

The charge-transfer process related to the reaction of the electrons with the I3− ions at the ZnO-NWA–electrolyte interface connects these two channels. If L is the length of the ZnO-NWA photoanode, the electron transport resistance in the ZnO-NWAs is Rt (=rtL), and the interfacial charge recombination resistance is Rct (=rct/L). The chemical capacitance Cμ (=cμL) reflects the change of electron density upon a small variation of the chemical potential. From the fitting data, the evolution of parameters, such as the electron transit time (τd = RtCμ), the electron recombination lifetime (τn = RctCμ), the electron diffusion coefficient (Dn = L2/τd), and the effective diffusion length [Ln = (Dnτn)1/2], may be calculated. These transport properties of ZnO-NWA DSSCs are determined from the impedance analyses listed in Table 2.As shown in Table 2, the electron recombination lifetimes of A1–A3 are similar (approximately 10 ms). However, the transit times of A1–A3 are relatively different (A1: 0.57 ms; A2: 0.23 ms; A3: 0.11 ms). From the definition of collection efficiency (ηCC) from eqn (2), the ηCC of DSSCs is known to be improved for short transit times if the recombination lifetimes are similar. This study fixed the length of three types of ZnO-NWAs to study the performance and transport properties of DSSCs. The analysis of transport properties showed that the ZnO-NWA fabricated using the CFI process (A2) is more suitable as a photoanode of DSSCs because of the short transit time for electron transport. The optical and structural qualities of the ZnO-NWAs grown using the CFI process were previously ascertained to be superior to those grown using the multi-batch process.17 This was because the zinc species rapidly decreased to a low concentration and caused deficiencies in the zinc precursor during growth of the ZnO-NWAs by the multi-batch process. In contrast, the zinc species were maintained at a stable concentration level to continuously supply the growth of ZnO-NWAs in the CFI process. The ZnO-NWAs fabricated using the CFI process maintained excellent optical and structural qualities for the photoanodes of DSSCs.The ZnO-NWA photoanodes fabricated using the NH3-assisted CFI process (A3) have the shortest transit time of the three types of ZnO-NWA photoanodes. Analyses by μ-PL and μ-Raman showed that the spectra of A3 are different from the others. A detailed study for this type of ZnO-NWAs is needed. What is known is that this type of ZnO-NWA is suitable as a photoanode of DSSCs. Wu et al. recently proposed that ZnO-NWAs have a fast transit time of approximately 47 μs.10 In comparison, the transit time of A3 is longer (0.11 ms vs. 47 μs). This value is known to be related to the length of ZnO-NWAs. If the length of ZnO-NWAs was reduced, the transit time would also be reduced. A short ZnO-NWA of approximately 2.5 μm was employed as photoanode of DSSCs (A4) to study the transport properties by EIS. The results are shown in Table 2. The transit time was observed to have decreased from 0.57 ms to 40 μs when the length of ZnO-NWA photoanode was reduced from 10 to 2.5 μm. The value of transit time is significantly dependent on the length of ZnO-NWAs. However, the diffusion coefficients are intrinsic properties of photoanodes. For example, the photoanodes of A1 and A4 were both fabricated using batch processes. The length of ZnO-NWAs and the values of diffusion coefficients are similar when using an identical fabrication method (Dn of A1 = 1.56 × 10−3 cm2 s−1vs. Dn of A4 = 1.54 × 10−3 cm2 s−1). The diffusion coefficient (Dn) better demonstrates the electron transport properties of photoanodes. In addition, the mobility of the ZnO nanowire was reported at approximately 1–5 cm2 V−1 s−1.11 Using the Einstein relation, D = kBTμ/e, the diffusion coefficient of the ZnO nanowire is approximately 5 × 10−2 to 5 × 10−1 cm2 s−1. In this study, the diffusion coefficient of ZnO-NWAs fabricated using the NH3-assisted CFI process achieved 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1. This value is now the highest for ZnO-NWAs.Many researchers have proposed various growth methods to fabricate long ZnO-NWAs as photoanodes of DSSCs, to increase dye absorption areas. However, the performances of these DSSCs are lacking.11,12,26,27 Hwang et al. prepared well-aligned ZnO-NWAs with a length of more than 40 μm by using a polyethyleneimine-assisted preheating hydrothermal method. The maximum conversion efficiency was 1.3% in their study. Increasing the thickness of ZnO-NWAs may effectively increase the dye-loading amount; however, the collection efficiency of DSSCs would be influenced by the length of ZnO-NWAs if the diffusion coefficient could not be improved simultaneously. To increase the conversion efficiency of ZnO-NWA DSSCs by increasing the length of ZnO-NWA photoanodes, the diffusion coefficient of ZnO-NWAs must be improved simultaneously. In this work, 10 μm length of ZnO-NWAs was fabricated using the CFI process and the NH3-assisted CFI process. The conversion efficiency of DSSCs using ZnO-NWAs fabricated using the NH3-assisted CFI process is higher than that fabricated using the CFI process because of the high diffusion coefficient. The ZnO-NWAs of 25 μm were fabricated using the NH3-assisted CFI process. By using these ZnO-NWAs as photoanodes of DSSCs, the conversion efficiency of DSSCs achieved 3.92% without any surface modifications (Fig. 5). EIS analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†) shows that the transit time increased from 0.11 to 0.78 ms when the length of the ZnO-NWAs increased from 10 to 25 μm. The diffusion coefficient of ZnO-NWAs with 25 μm length is similar to that with 10 μm length because the same growth method is used. For ZnO-NWA photoanodes, abundant electron interfacial recombinations occur in the Ru complex dye-sensitized ZnO-based photoanode DSSC because of the high surface trap density in the ZnO photoanodes after this type of dye adsorption.28,29 If a suitable sensitizer is employed for ZnO-based DSSCs, the conversion efficiency may be further improved.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, long ZnO-NWAs were fabricated using the multi-batch and CFI processes. ZnO-NWAs fabricated using the CFI process are suitable for photoanodes of DSSCs because of high optical and structural properties. In addition, ZnO-NWAs fabricated using the NH3-assisted CFI process effectively improve the transit time (0.11 ms). However, the transit time is significantly dependent on the thickness of the photoanode. The transit time may be reduced from 0.57 ms to 40 μs when the length of the ZnO-NWA decreases from 10 to 2.5 μm. The diffusion coefficient is more meaningful to demonstrate the transport properties of photoanodes. The diffusion coefficient of ZnO-NWAs is 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1, which is the current highest value for ZnO-NWAs. By using the NH3-assisted CFI process to fabricate ZnO-NWA photoanodes with 25 μm length, the conversion efficiency of DSSCs reached 3.92% with N719 dye. Compared to previous studies with long ZnO-NWA DSSCs, the conversion efficiency of this study was effectively improved. The dye-loading amount increases with the length of ZnO-NWA photoanodes because of a higher absorption area. However, the diffusion coefficient must be increased simultaneously to maintain the same collection efficiency.We are grateful for the financial support provided by the National Science Council under Contract no.
