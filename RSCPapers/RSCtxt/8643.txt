    , Accepted 21st April 2022First published on 27th April 2022AbstractNon-fused-ring electron acceptors (NFRAs) have drawn strong interest in organic solar cells (OSCs) resulting from their cheapness and efficacy. In order to solve the disadvantage of relatively low device performances caused by their poor planarity, non-covalent bonds are introduced to form a conformational lock in the molecule, thereby reducing the molecular twist and improving planarity. Considering that the terminal groups are the key to providing the main electron transport channel, and the large electrostatic potential (ESP) difference between the donor and acceptor can contribute to effective exciton dissociation, we designed and synthesized the NFREA molecules, O-IC2F and O-IC for OSCs. When paired with D18 as the donor to form OSCs, it was found that the PCE of D18/O-IC based devices was close to 0, while the D18/O-IC2F based device had a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.20%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 14.70 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 V and FF of 51.03%. The photoelectric processes demonstrate that these two devices have similar exciton generation, exciton transfer and charge collection processes. However, the D18/O-IC2F based device exhibits more efficient exciton dissociation, a lower degree of trap-assisted recombination and higher electron mobility in the blend films than the D18/O-IC based one. This demonstrates that F atoms in the terminal group of NFRAs promote exciton dissociation, elevate the electron transfer rate and mobility, increase the charge separation rate, and decrease the charge recombination.
Introduction
OSC materials have made great progress due to their lightness, flexibility, ease of energy level adjustment and so on.1–5 The materials used as electron acceptors have also developed from early fullerenes to the current non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) materials.6–11 They commonly adopt a ladder-type acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecular structure as a donor core, and the fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have achieved a PCE of 20%.12–23 Although a large number of FREAs have been developed, their fused-ring structures lead to an increase in the number of steps for their synthesis and purification, resulting in a dramatic increase in the cost of materials.24–27 Therefore, it is strongly desired to develop new cheap and effective acceptor materials to realize efficient and low-cost OSCs.
Under these considerations, reducing the use of fused rings in molecular skeletons is a simple and feasible scheme. Thus, the research on NFRAs is rapidly gaining momentum.25,26 Typically, the device performance of NFAs is inferior due to the poor planarity of the molecular structure. Intramolecular non-covalent bonds are introduced to improve the planar properties of molecules. Adjacent aromatic rings are linked by single bonds, and the solid-state locked conformation can be maintained through intramolecular non-covalent interactions between adjacent aromatic rings (such as O⋯H, S⋯O, etc.). In solution, non-covalent interactions are not sufficient to lock the coplanar conformation, thus enabling twisting between adjacent aromatic rings and improving solubility. Moreover, since coplanarity between aromatic rings is easily achieved through non-covalent interactions compared with through covalent bridges in fused ring structures, the synthesis process would be greatly simplified.28–32 And in the past two years, many related studies have been reported successively.33–35 Furthermore, the energy in the near-infrared region (700–3000 nm) accounts for over half of the total energy of sunlight. To enhance light harvesting in the near-infrared (NIR) region, both strong electron-donating units and electron-withdrawing units are introduced to promote the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).36,37 Considering that the end groups are the key to providing the main electron transport channel, which determines the electron transport properties of OSCs, and the large ESP difference between the donor and acceptor can contribute to effective exciton dissociation, we adopted different terminal groups for modification of the molecules.38–42
The report of Chen's group reveals that NFRAs with a rotatable conformation in solution can be constrained to a planar and stackable conformation in the condensed states, resulting in the presence of intramolecular O–H interactions in the core and steric hindrance in the terminal. Therefore, we used 1,4-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzene in the centre of the skeleton to form intramolecular O–H bonding. The difference was that we used 4-(2-butyloctyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b] pyrrole (TP), which is more electron-rich than thiophene, to connect with end-capping groups to achieve a stronger ICT, so that the resulting NFREA molecules can obtain a more red-shifted absorption spectrum.
Ultimately, we designed and synthesized novel simple NFREA molecules, O-IC2F and O-IC (Fig. 2(b)). Through the measurement of variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance, we verified the existence of intramolecular non-covalent bonds.1 Then we measured the photoelectrical properties and OSC performances of these two NFREAs. Their film absorption spectra showed broad absorption ranging from 400 to 850 nm and their absorption boundary values are 830 nm and 815 nm, respectively, with low bandgaps of 1.49 and 1.52 eV successively. Considering the complementarity of the absorption spectra and matching of energy levels, the polymeric donor D18 was selected to construct the OSC devices with the two NFREA acceptors. It was found that the PCE of the D18/O-IC based device is close to zero, while the D18/O-IC2F based one has a PCE of 7.20%, with a Jsc of 14.70 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.96 V and FF of 51.03%. The photoelectric processes demonstrate that these two devices have similar exciton generation, exciton transfer and charge collection processes. However, the D18/O-IC2F based device exhibits more efficient exciton dissociation, a lower degree of trap-assisted recombination, and higher electron mobility in the blend films than the D18/O-IC based one.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The structures of O-IC2F and O-IC are shown in Fig. 2(b), and the synthetic routes are displayed in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was obtained from 1,4-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzene and the organotin reagent of TP by the Still coupling reaction. Then compound 1 underwent a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction using dry DMF and POCl3 to give the aldehyde compound 2, followed by end-capping with the reaction of Knoevenagel condensation to get O-IC2F and O-IC. The detailed synthetic procedure is provided in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. S6–S14 (ESI†), the two molecular structures were characterized by Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-fight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Since they are not only non-fused-ring molecular structures but also have multiple long alkyl chains, they are easily soluble in conventional organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform (CF), toluene (TOL), o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and so on, at room temperature. Moreover, the steric hindrance of the alkyl chain could effectively prevent excessive aggregation while retaining an intramolecular charge transport channel.

We believed that there possibly exist both O–S and O–H interactions in the core. Therefore, in order to determine the molecular conformations of the above two NFREAs, we first identified the effect of interactions on Ha–f by 2D 13C–1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1(a) and (b)), and then measured the presence of O–H bonding (Fig. 1(c)). As shown in Fig. 1(c), the chemical shifts of alkyl pyrrole proton (Ha) and thiophene proton (Hb) in O-IC (in d4-dichlorobenzene) gradually move respectively from 9.11 and 7.58 ppm to 9.04 and 7.54 ppm with elevating temperatures from 306 K to 396 K. We also studied the molecular conformation calculated by DFT simulation based on B3LYP/6-31g(d,p). As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the hydrogen bonding is also supported from the calculated distances of Ha–O (2.06 Å) and Hb–O (2.21 Å) that are both shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radius for H and O atoms.1 Meanwhile, the chemical shifts of Hc (on the benzene core) and Hd (on the alkene) slightly increase respectively from 7.20 and 8.42 ppm to 7.29 and 8.49 ppm with increasing temperature, which may result from the cleavage of the Ha–O and Hb–O bonds so as to reduce the electronic density around the Hc or Hd nucleus. Although the rotation of the single bond would make Hc and Hd produce the steric effect, they are not enough to affect the increase in their chemical shifts. Through analysis of the above phenomena, we can draw a conclusion that there exists intramolecular interactions of Ha–O and Hb–O which lead to this conformation of the O-IC molecule (Fig. 1(a)).

We measured the UV-vis absorption spectrum of O-IC2F and O-IC. Their normalized absorption spectra in chloroform (CF) (Fig. 2(c)) and in neat films (Fig. 2(d)) are shown. The maximum absorption peaks in CF are located at 697 nm and 682 nm respectively, and in the film are 780 nm and 760 nm respectively. In contrast, the absorption spectra in the film red-shift substantially, implying the occurrence of aggregation by molecular framework π–π interactions in the solid state. Their absorption onsets in film are 830 nm and 815 nm, respectively, which reach the near-infrared region, resulting in the gradual growth of the corresponding optical band gap (Eoptg) from the diminishing electron-deficient nature of the terminal group. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 1, the energy levels of these two NFREAs are estimated from cyclic voltammetry (CV). And the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of these two NFREAs are estimated to be −5.56/−3.77 eV and −5.50/−3.66 eV, respectively (Fig. 2(e)).

Photovoltaic properties
As shown in Fig. 2(d), D18 has a complementary absorption spectrum and appropriate energy levels (Fig. 2(e)) to these two NFREAs. Thus we employed the polymer D18 as the donor and each of these two NFREAs respectively to form the active layer in the OSCs with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINN/Ag. All the OSC devices were additive-free single-solvents of CF processing, which could be feasible for scale-up manufacturing. The current density versus voltage (J−V) characteristic curves were measured under AM 1.5G irradiation with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The D18/O-IC based devices give a low PCE of 0.27%, with a Voc of 1.03 V, Jsc of 0.70 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.38. However, the D18/O-IC2F based device demonstrates a notably high PCE of 7.20%, with a Voc of 0.96 V, Jsc of 14.70 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.51. And as shown in Fig. 3(b) the EQE of the cell device based on D18/O-IC2F was performed by Stanford Systems Model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and 500 W xenon lamp, and then a calibrated silicon detector was used to determine the absolute photosensitivity at different wavelengths. But the EQE of the D18/O-IC based device is difficult to measure because its current is too weak. The calculated integrated current densities are 14.32 mA cm−2 for the D18/O-IC2F based device, which is consistent with the JSC obtained from the J–V measurements. In addition, we also surveyed these two acceptors matching the other donor material PCE10, and the device efficiency based on PCE10/O-IC and PCE10/O-IC2F is only 3.53% and 2.22%, respectively. The detailed device performances are listed in Table S1 (ESI†), and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is well known that the operation principle of the OSCs consists of five steps: exciton generation, exciton transfer, exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge collection.35 The exciton generation efficiency affects the Jsc and is closely related to the absorption coefficient. It is observed that these two blend films show similar absorption coefficients (Fig. 5(a)), suggesting that they generate a comparable number of excitons upon absorbing photons. Thus this process is not responsible for the huge difference in Jsc. Moreover, the charge collection process depends on the energy level matching between the active layer and the interface layer. Therefore, the apparent difference in Jsc should be credited to the other two processes, while the remaining two processes are not only related to the material properties but also to the morphology of the active layer.

Morphology characterizations
We then investigated the morphologies of the active layers by atomic force microscopy (AFM), with tapping mode under ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, the root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) values of these two active layers based on D18/O-IC and D18/O-IC2F are 1.30 and 1.53 nm respectively, indicating that all the blend films have smooth surfaces. And in the phase images, there are nearly no differences, and uniform fibrous structures are observed, implying nanoscale phase separation in the blend films. Moreover, the morphologies of these blend films should be mainly controlled by the polymeric donor due to a self-aggregating effect.16,36 Therefore, the morphology may not be the cause of the large performance differences among the two devices, and we would investigate the other two processes in depth.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiment may provide valuable information about the exciton dissociation process in the blend films of OSCs.43,44 The PL spectra of D18, O-IC2F, O-IC and the blend films are shown in Fig. 5(b) (excited at 480 nm) and Fig. 5(c) (excited at 680 nm). When exciting at 480 nm, the emission from D18 can barely be observed for the blend films, indicating that efficient electron transfer occurs. When exciting at 680 nm, the blend films exhibit PL-quenching efficiencies of 90% for D18/O-IC2F and 93% for D18/O-IC, suggesting that the exciton transfer in these two blend films are very effective. Then we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) to investigate the process of exciton dissociation and charge collection.45Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the light and dark current densities, respectively. Veff = V0 − V, where V represents the applied voltage and V0 denotes the compensation voltage when Jph = 0. The exciton dissociation probability is defined as Pdiss. Pdiss = Jph/Jsat. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the Jph of D18/O-IC based devices show a strong field-dependence property across a large bias range and cannot fully be saturated even at a high Veff. In contrast, the Jph of the D18/O-IC2F based device saturates at a low Veff. The Pdiss of the D18/O-IC2F based device is 90%, indicating an effective exciton dissociation. This Pdiss is 18% for the D18/O-IC based devices, indicating that most of the generated excitons are deactivated before they are separated into free carriers, which explains their lower Jsc and FF.

(d) Characteristics of the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jphvs. Veff). The extracted plots of Jsc (e) and Voc (f) versus light intensity for the optimized devices. 
The dependence of Voc and Jsc on the light intensity (P) was measured to investigate the charge recombination in OSCs.46,47 As shown in Fig. 5(e), the calculated values of slope are 1.04 and 1.49 kT q−1 respectively for D18/O-IC2F and D18/O-IC based devices. The 1 kT q−1 slope suggests that bimolecular recombination is the primary mechanism. Conversely, a slope of 2 kT q−1 indicates that trap-assisted recombination is the dominating mechanism. Thus trap-assisted recombination is not the main process in the D18/O-IC2F based device, while trap states show a bigger trend in another D18/O-IC device. This should be attributed to the reduced carrier density due to the low Pdiss. And from the formula of Jsc ∝ Ps, the power law component s implies the extent of bimolecular recombination. The closer the value of s is to the limit 1, the smaller the degree of bimolecular recombination in the device is. As shown in Fig. 5(f), the s values of the D18/O-IC2F and D18/O-IC based devices are 0.93 and 0.88, respectively. The decrease of the s value implies the increase of bimolecular recombination in the devices. Thus the trap-assisted recombination plays an important role in D18/O-IC based devices.
The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to investigate the charge transport process in the OSCs with the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/Au for hole mobility (μe) and ITO/ZnO/Active layer/Al for electron mobility (μh).48–59 The J1/2–V curves of the devices were demonstrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The μe of O-IC2F and O-IC is calculated to be 2.64 × 10−4 and 1.92 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. Obviously the μe of O-IC2F is higher than that of O-IC, which may be due to the effect of the F atom on the terminal group. Wang et al. reported that the electrostatically driven F–π interaction can play a key role in increasing the intermolecular interactions and reducing the distance between the terminal groups, thereby enhancing the electron mobility.50–55 According to the above analysis, the low Jsc of D18/O-IC based devices is mostly because of the inefficient exciton dissociation, larger degree of trap-assisted recombination and the lower electron mobility in the blend films. Compared with H atoms, the F atom in the terminal group has stronger electronegativity, which helps to form a stronger intermolecular electric field (IEF) to assist the exciton dissociation. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the ESP of the two acceptors were compared, and it was observed that their terminal groups were all positively charged, meaning that they were all receptive to electrons.56–59 The molecular conformation of the two acceptors was simulated by B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) (Fig. S5, ESI†). Compared with the conformation of the two molecules, it was found that they were significantly different. The O-IC2F conformation has better planarity, which is conducive to the formation of a π–π stack meaning an efficient charge transport channel. The dihedral angle formed by alkoxy benzene and TP in the O-IC molecular skeleton center is 29.45°, which is larger than that of O-IC2F (22.64°). In addition, the dihedral angle formed by the terminal groups of the two molecules and TP is 1.35° and 1.23° respectively, and the O-IC2F is also smaller. This shows that the terminal groups containing F atoms easily form π–π stacking and construct efficient charge-transport channels.
Conclusion
In summary, we designed and synthesized two new Vis-NIR absorbing NFREAs (O-IC2F and O-IC). When paired with the polymeric donor D18 to fabricate the OSCs, it was found that the PCE of the devices based on the two acceptor materials showed completely different results, with the OSC based on D18/O-IC2F and D18/O-IC being 7.20% and 0.27% respectively. Through the comparative analysis of the five processes of the two OSC devices, we found that the D18/O-IC2F-based device exhibited more efficient exciton dissociation, a lower degree of trap-assisted recombination and higher electron mobility in the blend films. In addition, this work also demonstrates that the F atom in the terminal group of NFREAs promotes exciton dissociation, elevates the electron transfer rate and mobility, increases the charge separation rate, and decreases the charge recombination rate. Furthermore, from the huge different performance of D18/O-IC and D18/O-IC2F based devices, it can be found that even if the energy level matches, the appropriate driving force of the donor/acceptor combination cannot ensure the expected performance of the devices. Therefore, further exploration is needed in the matching of receptors to meet the device performance expectation.
