    , Accepted 15th March 2017First published on 15th March 2017AbstractA mesoporous 3D marigold flower-like indium sulfide (In2S3) microstructure grafted with nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets was synthesised from fish scale biowaste using a simple, scalable, and cost-effective method. The as-obtained composite exhibited a larger surface area (307 m2 g−1) than pristine InS (57 m2 g−1). As the anode in a lithium ion battery, the synthesised composite and pristine materials retained capacities of about 751 and 397 mA h g−1, respectively, after 100 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1. Furthermore, the composite material delivered capacities in the range 1260–297 mA h g−1 when the current density was varied from 0.025 to 10.0 A g−1. The impressive electrochemical performance of the composite material is associated with the synergetic effect of porous carbon nanosheets in alleviating volume expansion and enhancing reversibility, allowing practical application in lithium ion batteries.
Introduction
Increasing global energy demand and the exhaustion of fossil fuels has inspired researchers to investigate alternative sources for energy storage and utilisation. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs), which have high reversibility and rate performance, have been considered as propitious energy storage systems for a wide variety of applications.1 Significant research effort has been focused on new electrode materials, as the overall electrochemical performance of a system is mainly determined by the intrinsic properties of its electrode material. Graphite, the commercial anode material in LIBs, has limited usage in high energy applications due to its low theoretical capacity and slow lithium ion diffusion kinetics.2,3 Few studies have focused on the utilisation of graphite as an intercalating cathode in rechargeable dual-ion batteries.4,5
A wide variety of conversion and alloying-type materials with high theoretical capacities have been studied in LIBs.6–9 Metal chalcogenides have been extensively investigated in many fields, including LIBs, photocatalysis, sensors, solar cells, and optical devices.10–12 Among various conventional semiconductor materials (group III–VI), indium sulfide has attracted great attention because of its high reversible capacity and environmental friendliness. Unfortunately, in comparison with intercalation materials, conversion and alloying-type anodes suffer from severe volumetric changes upon cycling, leading to pulverisation, loss of electrical conductivity, poor cycling, and rapid capacity decay. Much effort have been made to mitigate these issues, including size reductions, increased surface areas, and carbon coating.13–15 Conductive carbon-based composite materials, such as graphene or reduced graphene oxide (rGO), act as a buffer matrix that helps alleviate volume expansion and conductivity loss, thus facilitating favourable kinetics.14,16–18 The unique sheet-like morphology and high conductivity of the above carbon materials provide excellent reinforcement during lithium ion shuttling, resulting in improved electrochemical performance. However, the synthesis of graphene/rGO has many disadvantages, including high energy requirements and the use of toxic chemicals.
Partially graphitised porous carbon doped with nitrogen atoms is a fascinating material because of its versatile applications in the fields of energy, catalysis, sensors, and memory-storage devices.19–22 Furthermore, the conductive porous carbon framework can enhance the cycling stability, rate capability, and stress caused by volume changes.23 The partial replacement of carbon atoms with nitrogen induces extrinsic defects that lead to enhanced conductivity, which facilitates strong interactions between Li ions. Recently, our group reported the electrochemical performance of N-doped porous carbon nanosheets derived from a cheap and naturally abundant fish scale precursor.20 The synthesis of a value-added product from such a bio-waste material is attractive because of its low cost, ease of availability, and amenability to commercialisation.
In the present study, we extend the application of N-doped porous carbon nanosheets as conductive additives for indium sulfide (InS) anode materials. The composite material (PCInS) has been synthesised using simple wet ball milling and the resultant material exhibits a large surface area, robust integration, and high conductivity. As expected, such a hybrid structure can compromise volume expansion during cycling processes, which provides a large lithium ion storage ability, reduced pathway for ion transport, and improved rate capability. The composite material exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a reversible capacity of ∼755 mA h g−1 (0.5 A g−1) and ∼242 mA h g−1 (10.0 A g−1).
Results and discussion
Physical characterisation
The crystal structure of the synthesised material was characterised by XRD analysis. Fig. 1a shows typical XRD patterns of synthesised pristine InS and composite PCInS. All diffraction peaks were indexed to the cubic phase of β-In2S3, α = 10.74 Å (JCPDS card no. 03-065-0459), without any impurity phase.24–26 The strong and sharp diffraction pattern suggested that the as-synthesised material was highly crystalline in nature and no obvious difference in peak position was observed after preparing the composite/coating with porous carbon. Fig. 1b shows the typical Raman spectra of Ins, PCInS composite, and N-doped porous carbon derived from fish scale (FSHC). A small broad peak observed at 300 cm−1 corresponded to vibration modes of β-In2S3.12 For the PCInS composite, two additional characteristic bands at 1340 and 1590 cm−1 were observed, corresponding to disordered-induced D and graphitic G bands of carbon, respectively, which confirmed the presence of porous carbon in the PCInS composite.

X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) measurements were carried out to study the surface composition of the synthesised material. The typical XPS survey spectrum of the composite material (Fig. S1a, ESI†) clearly indicated the presence of In, S, C, and O (O signal from oxygen adsorbed on the synthesised porous carbon material). The high intensity peak observed at 285.3 eV corresponded to the C 1s atom, providing clear evidence for the successful incorporation of FSHC into the nanocomposite, while this peak was absent in the pristine material (Fig. S1b and c, ESI†). The bonding environment was deconvoluted using a Gaussian fitting program, with the results shown in Fig. 1c and d. The deconvoluted peak of the sulfur spectrum resulted in two different binding energies at 162.7 eV for S 2p1/2 and 161.5 eV for S 2p3/2. These binding energies were consistent with sulfur in the sulfide state.18,27,28 The regional spectrum of indium revealed a pair of symmetrical peaks at 444.8 and 452.3 eV, corresponding to In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2, respectively. Additionally, the spin orbital separation between the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 peaks (7.2 eV), and the S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 peaks (1.2 eV), confirmed the presence of In3+ and S2− in the final product.29
The surface morphology of the material was investigated using different electron microscopy techniques. Fig. 2a depicts a uniform flower-like structure with an average size of 400–450 nm, composed of numerous intercrossed thin nanosheets. The inset of Fig. 2a shows the same picture at higher magnification. The In/S atomic ratio was 2:3, as confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (Fig. S1d, ESI†), which corresponded with the stoichiometric ratio of In2S3. EDX mapping images of the three elements (In, S, and C) revealed the homogeneous distribution of elements in the whole architecture of the composite (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. 2b–f depict the FE-SEM, TEM, and HR-TEM images of the synthesised microstructure. The HR-TEM images, depicted in Fig. 2d, show interplanar distances of 0.328 nm and 0.38 nm, which correspond with the {311} and {220} planes of cubic In2S3 respectively. Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) image (Fig. 2d, inset) proved that the material was highly crystalline in nature. Fig. 2e and f depict the HR-TEM images of PCInS, clearly showing that the graphene-like porous carbon nanosheets completely wrapped the synthesised microflower. Moreover, the porous structure existing in the carbon nanosheets facilitated easy electrolyte access and a reduced pathway for lithium ion diffusion. Fig. S3a (ESI†) shows the marigold flower-like pristine InS. Upon milling the flowers, the petals disintegrated and became individually embedded in the porous carbon nanosheets (Fig. S3b and c, ESI†). The HR-TEM image also confirmed robust integration between porous carbon and the synthesised PCInS sample (Fig. S3d–f, ESI†).

To investigate porosity and surface area, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded for both pristine and PCInS composite materials (Fig. S4a and b respectively, ESI†). Both samples showed type IV adsorption, where the specific surface area and pore volume of pristine InS were 57 m2 g−1 and 0.57 cm3 g−1, respectively, as calculated using the BET equation and BJH method. However, the specific surface area had increased to 307 m2 g−1 upon coating with porous carbon (FSHC), while the pore volume of the composite material had decreased to 0.5 cm3 g−1, which confirmed that the pore was filled with indium sulfide nanosheets during the ball milling process. The pore size distribution was in the range 3–60 nm, confirming the presence of mesopores and macropores in the composite material (Fig. S4, ESI†). The large specific surface area present in the PCInS composite helped to increase contact between the electrolyte and active mass, leading to easy electrolyte access and fast ion diffusion.18
Electrochemical performance as LIB anode material
Electrochemical performance and lithium ion storage capability were evaluated for both pristine microflower-like InS and PCInS composite using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling, respectively. Fig. 3a and c depict the first ten consecutive cyclic voltammograms of PCInS and InS, cycled between 2.5 and 0.005 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. There was no obvious difference observed between the super P and porous carbon-coated samples, indicating similar types of electrochemical reactions on both electrodes. Compared with pristine InS, the PCInS composite exhibited an excellent redox peak due to the large surface area and high conductivity, leading to a reduced ion transport pathway. Remarkably, the CV curve of the first cycle was different from subsequent cycles, particularly during discharge. The obtained CV curves were similar to those presented in an earlier report.17,18,30,31 The strong reduction peak observed at 1.14 V corresponded to the irreversible reduction of In2S3 to metallic In, along with the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and Li2S.28 Furthermore, three additional peaks observed at around 0.65, 0.36, and 0.28 V confirmed that indium metal underwent a multistep alloying process with lithium, and intercalation into additional sites. Corresponding oxidation peaks were also observed at 0.7, 1.1, and 1.5 V in the CV profile. From the second cycle onwards, the peak intensity decreased, with peaks almost overlapping, indicating a stable multistep reversible alloying and dealloying process in LixIn.
 Fig. 3  (a and c) CV curves (ten consecutive cycles) at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 and (b and d) obtained cycling profile at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 for PCInS composite and pristine InS material, respectively. 

Fig. 3b and d depict galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling profiles recorded from 100 cycles of the PCInS composite and pristine InS cycled between 2.5 to 0.005 V at a current density of 500 mA g−1, respectively. Fig. S5a and b (ESI†) show the selected cycles (1st, 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, and 100th) of PCInS and pristine InS materials, respectively. Fig. S5c (ESI†) shows the real-time application of the half-cell containing the PCInS composite anode. The steady state cycling performance of the composite and pristine materials is shown in Fig. 4a and c, respectively. After the formation cycle, the composite material delivered discharge and charge capacities of about 747 and 728 mA h g−1, respectively, with 97% Coulombic efficiency. During the initial discharge process, the material exhibited a slight capacity decay to reach 731 mA h g−1 within ten cycles and maintained a steady state. Interestingly, after 30 cycles, the capacity slowly increased to 780 mA h g−1.
 Fig. 4  (a and c) Steady-state cycling at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and (b and d) rate capability study of PCInS composite and pristine InS, respectively. 
The low discharge capacity over the first few cycles might be attributed to either partial trapping or irreversible deposition of lithium ions at pores present in the carbon and the InS moieties. The trapped lithium ions were released gradually with continued cycling. In contrast, the wrapped carbon nanosheets prevented the agglomeration of indium nanoparticles into bulk, obtained during the initial reduction of In2S3. The composite material maintained a stable discharge capacity for the recorded 100 cycles, with Coulombic efficiency above 97%, indicating the virtuous reversibility of Li+ during the shuttling process. These results might be associated with favourable charge-transfer kinetics and enhanced activity induced by N-doped porous carbon coating.32 Fig. S6a (ESI†) shows the charge–discharge profile of the formation cycle for PCInS electrode at a current density of 25 mA g−1. The discharge curve of the first cycle was up to 2109 mA h g−1, while the first charging capacity was only 1312 mA h g−1 with 62% initial Coulombic efficiency. The initial high discharge capacity and low Coulombic efficiency could be ascribed to irreversible formation of the SEI film over the composite electrode and In2S3 reduction. Owing to the high specific surface area, an excessive interface existing between the electrolyte and active material also contributed to the high irreversible capacity. Interestingly, in accordance with CV results, two voltage plateaus were observed at ∼1.36 and ∼1.13 V, corresponding to SEI formation and InS reduction, respectively.
To validate the high rate application, the cell was subjected to a rate capability test using different current densities, from 0.025 to 10 A g−1 (Fig. 4b and d). The PCInS composite (Fig. 4b) material delivered a reversible discharge capacity of about 1260 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.025 A g−1, which subsequently decreased to 1126, 994, 881, 647, 431, 297, and 253 mA h g−1 upon increasing the current density to 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 10.0 A g−1, respectively. Interestingly, when the current density was changed back to 0.1, 0.25, and 0.75 A g−1, the reversible discharge capacity of the same cell was restored to 950, 871, and 783 mA h g−1, respectively, indicating very stable cycling performance. The steady state cycling performance of pristine InS obtained at a current density of 500 mA g−1 is shown in Fig. 4c. After the formation cycles, the pristine material delivered an initial reversible capacity of 456 mA h g−1 with 97% Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the discharge capacity rapidly decreased upon cycling, achieving 397 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle with 87% capacity retention. The capacity decay in the pristine material could be associated with the formation of a thick polymeric gel of decomposed electrolyte, which was catalysed by the initial reduction product (Li2S). This layer prevented further lithium ion uptake and led to poor cycling stability.33 Fig. S6b (ESI†) depicts the formation cycle for pristine InS cycled between 2.5 to 0.005 V at a current density of 25 mA g−1. During the formation cycles, the pristine InS delivered a high discharge capacity of about 1453 mA h g−1 with a corresponding charging capacity of 775 mA h g−1. The initial low Coulombic efficiency might be attributed to the irreversible capacity loss, including electrolyte decomposition and SEI formation over the electrode surface. To investigate the rate capability of pristine InS, the cell was tested with different current densities, from 0.025 to 4.0 A g−1, as presented in Fig. 4d. As the current density was gradually increased from 0.025 to 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 A g−1, the corresponding average reversible capacity decreased from 713 to 632, 579, 483, 413, 290, 221, and 125 mA h g−1, respectively, along with the related Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, when the current density was changed back to 0.1, 0.25, and 0.75 A g−1, the discharge capacity returned to 540, 465, and 365 mA h g−1, respectively. The electrochemical performances of PCInS and pristine InS were recorded at high current density across the voltage range 2.5–0.005 V (Fig. S7, ESI†). The cycling profiles at different current densities, from 0.025 to 4.0 A g−1, and steady-state cycling performance obtained at high current densities (1.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 10.0 A g−1) for PCInS and pristine InS are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). PCInS delivered discharge capacities of about 645, 422, 300, and 238 mA h g−1. After performing 100 cycles at the respective current densities, the PCInS delivered reversible capacities of 652, 407, 276, and 241 mA h g−1. Similarly, pristine InS delivered 297, 222 and 141 mA h g−1, and reversible capacities after 100 cycles of 293, 214, and 127 mA h g−1 at current densities of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 A g−1, respectively (Fig. S7d, ESI†). Compared with pristine InS, the composite material exhibited a higher discharge capacity and good cycling stability, along with a 15% capacity contribution.
High rate charge–discharge and rate capability properties are important for practical applications to batteries in high energy devices. The very high capacity and excellent cycling performance of PCInS composite made it a promising anode material for LIBs. To our knowledge, the PCInS composite material synthesised in the present work exhibits better lithium ion storage and rate performance than other reported InS composite materials (Table 1).

An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study was carried out for both systems before and after cycling, and the resultant Nyquist plot with fitting is shown in Fig. 5. EIS measurements were carried out under open-circuit conditions and fitted using ZMAN 2.2 fitting software. A Randles equivalent circuit had been created, which consisted of various circuit elements.

The spectra were composed of partially overlapped depressed semi-circles in the high to medium frequency range, followed by a low frequency inclined line. Rs is the resistance of the electrolyte, Rf and Rct are the surface film (SEI) and charge-transfer resistance at the electrode surface, respectively, while W is the Warburg impedance, which is related to the solid-state diffusion of lithium ions at low frequencies. Fig. 5a and b depict the PCInS composite and pristine electrode materials before cycling, while the inset illustrates the situation after cycling. The Rs value has reduced to 3.7 from 7.1 Ω. Similarly, the Rct was 11.4, down from 124.3 Ω. For pristine InS, the Rs and Rct values reduced from 13 and 126 to 6.4 and 17 Ω, respectively. Fig. S8a and b (ESI†) show impedance data before and after cycling for the nanocomposite and pristine materials, clearly showing that the formed SEI was stable in nature. A considerable shift in Rct was observed in both cases after long cycling (100 cycles at different current rates, including high and low current densities).
Experimental
Synthesis of In2S3 microflowers
All chemicals were of analytical grade, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (purity >99.9%), and used without further purification. For the synthesis of indium sulfide microflowers, indium chloride was chosen as indium source and 2-aminothiophenol (2-ATP) as the sulfur source, and the material was synthesised according to a literature procedure.22 In a typical synthetic process, InCl3 (1.0 mM) was dissolved in Millipore water (40 mL) and ATP (3.0 mM) was dissolved in absolute ethanol (10 mL). These two solutions were combined slowly over 30 min with constant stirring and the resultant colloidal solution was sonicated for 15 min. The above solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 160 °C for 12 h. The resultant product was filtered, washed with alcohol and Millipore water several times, and dried at 100 °C under vacuum.
Preparation of composite
Fish scale-derived hierarchical carbon (FSHC) containing nitrogen was used as the conductive additive in the preparation of the porous carbon–indium sulfide composite. The synthesis and characterisation of nitrogen-doped FSHC has been reported in our earlier work,19 in which the composite was prepared with a 75:15:10 ratio (active material/carbon additive/binder). The required amount of synthesised indium sulfide was ground with homogenised porous carbon using acetone for 1 h and ball milled for 5 h. This material was denoted as PCInS. In a similar procedure, conducting carbon (super P) was used instead of porous carbon to obtain InS.
Material characterisation
Powder XRD patterns were recorded with a PANalytical X'pert PRO X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation. The surface morphology of the material was characterised by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Gemini, Zeiss), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Tecnai 20 G2, FEI) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, FEI) with a CCD imaging system. The specific surface area was evaluated at 77 K (AutosorbiQ, Quantachrome Instruments) using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory. The total surface area was calculated using multipoint BET based on the isotherm. The cumulative pore volume and pore size distribution were derived from the adsorption branch of the isotherm based on non-local density functional theory (NLDFT), assuming slit-pore geometry. XPS analysis was carried out using a MULTILAB 2000 Base X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with monochromatic Mg Kα as an excitation source and C 1s (284.6 eV) as the reference binding energy.
Electrochemical evaluation
The electrochemical behaviour of N-doped porous-carbon-integrated indium sulfide was evaluated using a CR-2032 type coin-cell, with Li metal acting as both the counter and reference electrode. The electrode was prepared by mixing the carbon-coated active materials with polyvinylidine difluoride (PVdF) binder. N-Methyl-pyrrolidin-2-one (NMP) was used to prepare the slurry, which was then coated over degreased copper foil. The coating was dried at 120 °C under vacuum, cut into the required dimensions, and stored in an argon-filled glovebox (MBRAUN UNILAB) with moisture and oxygen levels maintained below 1 ppm. The cell was fabricated using a polypropylene separator with active material loading in the range 0.7–0.8 mg cm−2. Electrochemical characterisation was carried out using an Autolab electrochemical workstation (GPES, PGSTAT 302N) and charge/discharge lifecycles were measured using a WonAtech (WBCS3000S) automatic charge/discharge life testing system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a Frequency Response Analyser (FRA, Autolab PGSTAT 302N) for the coin cell with a small AC perturbation pulse of 5 mV and frequency ranges between 100 kHz and 5 mHz. All electrochemical studies were performed with the CR-2032-type coin cell under quasi-equilibrated conditions.
Conclusions
In summary, a viable method for the preparation of nitrogen-incorporated biowaste-derived porous carbon nanosheets integrated with indium sulfide microflowers by wet ball milling was demonstrated. The obtained composite material exhibited a larger surface area, higher electrical conductivity, and superior electrochemical performance than pristine InS. The rational design of such a composite material mitigated severe volume expansion, which occurs during cycling, and retains a high discharge capacity, even at different current densities. When evaluated as the anode material in a LIB, the PCInS composite exhibited high specific discharge capacities of ∼751 and 241 mA h g−1 at current densities of 5.0 and 10.0 A g−1, respectively, after 100 cycles. These results demonstrate the advantages of nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets integrated with indium sulfide, and this composite material should be considered as a promising anode material for high-performance LIBs.
