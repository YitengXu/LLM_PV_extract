    , Accepted 2nd November 2015First published on 3rd November 2015AbstractMaterials with good thermoelectric (TE) properties such as Bi2Te3 and SnTe have recently come to be known as topological insulators (TIs). It is fundamentally interesting to explore if other materials with non-trivial electronic topology may also exhibit good TE properties. In this work, we use first-principles density functional theoretical calculations to determine and analyze the electronic thermoelectric properties (Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (σ) and thermoelectric power factor (P)) of topological insulators (β-As2Te3, BiTeCl, and PbTe), a topological Dirac semimetal (Na3Bi) and a Weyl semimetal (TaAs) and semimetallic YPtBi, belonging to different symmetry and topological classes. We find that the multiple sub-band structure, the small band gap of topological insulators, and their vicinity to a metallic state associated with an electronic topological transition (ETT) are responsible for their superior TE performance. In addition, sensitivity of their electronic structure to strain makes their thermoelectric properties highly tunable. We predict that TaAs is a promising TE for experimental exploration, and propose that the thermoelectric modulators based on TIs such as SnTe and PbTe will be more efficient under mechanical load.
I Introduction
In recent years, thermoelectric (TE) materials have been a subject of significant research activity,1,2 as they convert wasted energy in the form of heat into electricity, and provide an environment friendly all-solid state alternative to cooling technologies like refrigeration.4–6 Thermoelectric power generators have also been used for a long time in space missions.7 The Seebeck coefficient (S), a measure of the thermoelectric property, relates an electrical potential difference created from a temperature gradient in a TE material. Materials with large S can be versatile and robust for waste-heat recovery from various scenarios such as automobile exhaust systems, industrial furnaces, gas pipes etc. Recently, efficient conversion of solar energy to electrical energy has also been demonstrated using the thermoelectric Seebeck effect.2
The thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) is defined as ZT = σS2T/κ = PT/κ, where σ is the electrical conductivity, κ is the thermal conductivity and P(=σS2) is the thermoelectric power factor. Unlike many other important functionalities like piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity or multiferroicity, thermoelectricity is not restricted by any symmetry of a material. However, materials with efficient thermoelectric conversion ability are hard to engineer due to conflicting requirements like low thermal conductivity (κ) and high electrical conductivity (σ), and also competing factors such as carrier concentration and effective mass, which are evident in the simple expressions of S and σ, valid for metals and degenerate semiconductors,1 (1)and (2)where kB, T, n, and τ are the Boltzmann constant, temperature, carrier concentration and relaxation time respectively. m* is the density-of-states effective mass given by m* = Nv2/3mb*, where mb* is the average band effective mass of a single valley given by mb* = (mxmymz)1/3 and Nv is the valley degeneracy.3mx, my and mz are components of the effective mass tensor along the three principle directions for an anisotropic material. While both S and σ occur in the numerator of the expression for ZT, they show opposite trends with effective mass and carrier concentration. Moreover, in metals the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity (κele) is also linked to σ via the Wiedemann–Franz law8 and the effective mass of the charge carriers.
The dependence of S and σ on the density of states (DOS) at Fermi energy (EF) is also, to a certain extent, conflicting. The dependence of S on the local DOS at the Fermi level is captured by the Mott expression which, in general, holds for metals,9 but it is also applicable for semiconductors for which the Fermi level lies within a narrow region inside the density of states, where it increases locally.10 (3)where energy dependent conductivity σ(ε), which is generally known as the transport distribution function (see eqn (7) for a more general definition) is given by, σ(ε) = D(ε)f0(ε)eμ(ε) = n(ε)eμ(ε),(4)where D(ε), f0(ε), and μ(ε) denote energy dependent DOS, Fermi–Dirac distribution function and charge carrier mobility, respectively, and n(ε) = D(ε)f0(ε) denotes the carrier concentration. From eqn (3), we see that a large S can be achieved by increasing , which in turn is caused by a local enhancement of D(ε).11
Recently, materials with good thermoelectric properties, such as Bi2Te3 and PbTe, have also been discovered to exhibit non-trivial electronic topology at ambient12,13 and/or applied pressures.14 Materials with nontrivial electronic topology are novel quantum states of matter which exhibit exotic and robust conducting surface states as a consequence of nontrivial topology of the electronic structure in their bulk form. It appears that materials exhibiting a non-trivial electronic topology or high thermoelectric figure of merit often comprise heavy elements and possess small band gaps.15 Heavy atoms have low frequencies of vibration that result in a low lattice thermal conductivity essential for a high thermoelectric figure of merit. They also exhibit large spin–orbit coupling necessary for certain nontrivial topological materials. In addition, topological insulators (TIs) often have a small electronic band gap as they lie in the vicinity of a strain dependent electronic topological transition (ETT). This helps in tuning the intrinsic carrier concentration to optimize the thermoelectric power factor. ETT in a material involves a transformation from a topologically trivial to topologically nontrivial phase. It involves a change in the overall topology of the occupied bands of a material characterized by topological invariants like Z2 indices or Chern number.
Other features of electronic dispersion of a topologically non-trivial material may also be used favorably to enhance the thermoelectric efficiency.16–20 For example the electronic structure of SnTe, which is a topological crystalline insulator (TCI), exhibits a heavy hole band near its light hole valence band maximum (VBM). Energies of the light and heavy hole bands can be brought closer (a phenomenon known as band convergence3) through alloying,18,19 to optimize carrier mobility and enhance thermopower (S). Furthermore, the ZT of TIs is strongly size dependent,20 taking values greater than 1 in the nanoscale regime where the metallic surface states become more relevant to electric conduction. Clearly, the electronic structure of topologically nontrivial materials seems to have a great potential for efficient thermoelectric transport, and they may possess a high P even in the semi-metallic or small band gap regime. Here, we focus on the determination of P of materials belonging to different classes of nontrivial topology, and uncover the correlation between the two.
We use semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory within a constant scattering time approximation to calculate the transport properties S, σ and P. As EF is tunable by doping, we calculate S, σ and P of the compounds over a wide energy window (∼1.6 eV) straddling the undoped EF. Our calculations suggest that a high ZT in typical TE materials such as Bi2Te3 does not arise just from the strongly dispersing valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) edges associated with the TI phase, but similar to ordinary band insulators (BIs), the TE properties of TIs too depend strongly on their density of states close (typically within ∼0.5 eV) to the Fermi level. Due to the vicinity to an ETT induced by strain, the TE properties of TIs (or corresponding BIs) are quite sensitive to strain. We demonstrate this for β-As2Te3, where applied strain not only closes the band gap but also aids in the band convergence to increase P by a factor of 3. Our calculations reveal that PbTe exhibits better TE performance in its TCI phase than in its BI phase. Contrary to naive expectations, our calculations also indicate that n-doped TaAs could be a promising thermoelectric with a high power factor.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we give a brief introduction to materials with different topologically nontrivial features, chosen in this work. In Section III, we provide computational details which include (a) the method used in the determination of electronic structure using first-principles calculations (Section IIIA), and (b) a technique used to estimate the electronic transport properties based on the semi-classical Boltzmann theory (Section IIIB). We present our results in Section IV and discuss them in Section V, followed by a conclusion in Section VI.
II Materials with nontrivial electronic topology
Nontrivial electronic topology of a material often arises from the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) that is strong relative to crystal field splitting (e.g. Z2 topological insulator13), which results in the reordering or interchange of valence and conduction bands of distinct symmetries in a phenomenon known as band inversion. Certain crystallographic symmetries give rise to nontrivial topological phases in which symmetry protected linearly dispersing valence and conduction bands cross in the electronic structure of a bulk material (e.g. Dirac semimetal,21,22 Weyl semimetal23), and gapless conducting states appear on its surface.24 Depending on the dispersion of electronic bands near the Fermi level or gap of the bulk, surface states and their origin, we consider here six categories of topologically nontrivial materials: (a) Z2 TI (centrosymmetric), (b) Z2 TI (non-centrosymmetric), (c) TCI, (d) topological semimetal, (e) Dirac semimetal and (f) Weyl semimetal, and identify the correlation between their electronic topology and thermoelectric performance, if any.
A Z2 TI exhibits a non-zero band gap in its bulk electronic structure, and gapless surface states with linearly dispersing bands forming a Dirac cone (or in odd numbers) that typically falls in the bulk band gap, which are protected by time reversal symmetry. In the TCI class of materials, crystal symmetry and field play more significant roles than time reversal symmetry and SOC.24 For example, SnTe (a TCI) has a mirror symmetry in its crystal structure,25 due to which it exhibits even number of band inversions (as a function strain or pressure which modifies the relative strength of hybridization and crystal field splitting) in the electronic structure of its bulk. The robust surface states in this class of materials are protected by the mirror symmetry. In topological semimetals, the VBM and the CBM touch each other to give a semimetallic state, and the dispersion of bands is often quadratic at the touching point. In this class, the electronic structure possesses an inverted band order (as in HgTe) of the VBM and the CBM compared to their band insulator counterpart (as in CdTe).26 Materials with C3, C4 or C6 uniaxial rotational symmetries can host Dirac semimetallic states.27 In a Dirac semimetal, a pair of doubly degenerate and linearly dispersing bands of different symmetries cross each other giving rise to a robust Dirac cone in their bulk electronic structure. In materials with broken spatial inversion or time reversal symmetries, the doubly degenerate bands split and become two non-degenerate bands due to SOC. Despite these broken symmetries, if the non-degenerate bands make robust linear crossing, the material is a Weyl semimetal in which the point of crossing is doubly degenerate and is called a Weyl node.
We choose six materials belonging to six different categories as mentioned earlier and summarize their structural features in Fig. 1. Amongst the materials studied here, β-As2Te3 has a rhomobohedral crystal structure with space group Rm (No. 166), which becomes a Z2 TI as a function of uniaxial stress (σzz > 1.77 GPa).28 PbTe, which has a rocksalt structure with space group Fmm (No. 225) undergoes an electronic topological transition under hydrostatic pressure (P) and becomes a TCI (for P > 4 GPa).14 Na3Bi, with space group P63/mmc (No. 194), is a Dirac semimetal in its native state,22 BiTeCl with space group P63mc (No. 186) is a large bandgap non-centrosymmetric Z2 TI,29 and YPtBi having a half-Heusler structure with space group F3m (No. 216) is a topological semimetal with a vanishing gap.30 The non-centrosymmetric TaAs crystal with space group I41md (No. 109) is a Weyl semimetal23 at ambient pressure. Amongst these compounds, to the best of our knowledge, thermoelectric properties of only β-As2Te3 and PbTe have been investigated,3,10,31 albeit in their ambient pressure band insulating phases. Here, we determine the transport properties of β-As2Te3 and PbTe in both the BI and TI phases and those of other compounds in their topologically nontrivial phases. The thermoelectric performance of the electronically nontrivial topological phases of β-As2Te3, PbTe, BiTeCl, YPtBi, Na3Bi and TaAs is assessed by comparing their power factors with that of band insulating PbTe which is an established high ZT TE.

III Computational methods
A First-principles density functional theory calculations
We employ a full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FPLAPW) based method as implemented in the WIEN2k code32 to determine the electronic structure and properties of all the materials presented here. To obtain the total energy and eigenvalues of the electrons in a solid using the FPLAPW method, we use a basis set achieved by dividing the unit cell into non-overlapping spheres centered around each atom and the interstitial regions. The plane wave basis set is used to represent wave functions inside the interstitial region, which is augmented by the atomic-like wave function inside the spherical region around each atom. We use Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof parametrization33 of the exchange correlation energy functional derived within a gradient generalized approximation.34 Truncation of the plane wave expansion of electronic wave functions inside the interstitial region is specified by Rmt × Kmax, where Rmt is the radius of the smallest atomic sphere (muffin-tin) and Kmax is the plane wave cut-off vector. Charge density cut-off is specified by Gmax. The cut-off values for the wave functions and charge density are summarized in Table 1. In all the calculations, we have included spin–orbit coupling through the second variational procedure,35,36 and the electronic structure (see Fig. 2) of each of the materials is determined at the lattice constants (see Table 1) by including the SOC in the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian.
Table 1 Structural parameters and cutoffs defining basis sets used in WIEN2k density functional theory (DFT) calculations of six materials that exhibit electronic structure with nontrivial topology. We use experimental lattice constants of all the compounds except for β-As2Te3 and PbTe which are trivial insulators at ambient pressure (marked with * in the table). We use lattice constants of β-As2Te3 and PbTe obtained with uniaxial strain εzz = −0.0737 and isotropic strain (εh) = −0.0138 respectively. Eg is the smallest band gap, the values of Rmt, Kmax and Gmax are used in defining the basis sets, and NI is the number of inequivalent k-points in irreducible wedge of the Brillouin zone (IBZ) of each of the materials when the full Brillouin zone is sampled with 40000 k-points

 Fig. 2  Dependence of density-of-states (DOS), electrical conductivity (σ/τ), Seebeck coefficient (S), and power factor (S2σ/τ) on Fermi level at different temperatures. Units for DOS, σ/τ, S, and S2σ/τ are the number of states per eV per unit cell, 1017 Ω−1 cm−1 s−1, μV K−1 and 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1 respectively. Type-I, type-II and type-III peaks are marked, respectively, with I, II and III either just above or below each peak in the power factor vs. Fermi energy (EF) graphs. The results for three different temperatures 300 K, 400 K and 500 K are indicated with black (solid line), blue (dashed line) and red (dash dotted line) colors respectively. 
B Semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory
We use the density functional theory (DFT)-based electronic structure within a semi-classical Boltzmann theory under a constant scattering time approximation as implemented in the BoltzTraP code,39 and calculate the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and power factor of the six materials described earlier (also see Fig. 1) as a function of Fermi energy (EF) and temperature (T). Electrical conductivity (σαβ) and Seebeck coefficient (Sαβ) which are tensor quantities are obtained using11,40 (5)and (6)where α and β are Cartesian indices, and Ω and f0 are the volume of the unit cell and the Fermi–Dirac distribution function of the carriers respectively. Central to these relations is the transport distribution function (Σαβ), (7)where k and i are the wave vector and the band index, respectively, N in the total number of k-points used in sampling the Brillouin zone, τ is the relaxation time, and  is the group velocity. The derivative of energy εi,k is determined by the BoltzTraP code through Fourier expansion of band energies (i,k) using the star functions of the space group symmetry:39 and , where R is a direct lattice vector, {∧} are the n point group symmetry operations, and cRi are the expansion coefficients. The point group symmetries and space group of each of the six materials are summarized in Fig. 1.
Band energies are determined on a dense mesh (40000) of k-points for sampling the Brillouin zone for each of the materials. The actual calculation uses the symmetry and k-points only in the irreducible wedge of the corresponding Brillouin zone (see the last column of Table 1). To achieve a better fit between i(k) and εi,k, the original grid of k-points was interpolated onto a k-mesh five times as dense. We calculate the transport properties using strained lattice constants37,38 for β-As2Te3 and PbTe (at which they become TI and TCI respectively), and experimental lattice constants for Na3Bi, BiTeCl, YPtBi, and TaAs (see Table 1). The limits of the integration in the evaluation of σ and S (see eqn (5) and (6)) span an interval EF − 0.5 Ry to EF + 0.5 Ry. As the relaxation time (τ) is an undetermined quantity in our simulations, quantities which depend on the τ (electrical conductivity and power factor) are reported by scaling them with τ (i.e. σ/τ and S2σ/τ).
IV Results
We determined the transport properties namely σ/τ, S, and P (see Fig. 2) within a rigid band approximation (RBA) in which the electronic structure is assumed to be unchanged with doping. This approximation is reasonably good for low doping concentrations and is commonly used for the theoretical study of TE materials.39–44 Materials with good thermoelectric properties typically require one type (p- or n-type) of majority carrier. Comparable concentrations of p- and n-type carriers in a material lead to bipolar effects, and cause a low ZT at high temperatures. Hence, semiconductors are typically doped to optimize the carrier concentration and maximize the thermoelectric efficiency.1 The effects of doping concentration are thus determined essentially through the corresponding changes in the Fermi energy. To this end, we show the dependence of density of states (DOS) on energy and that of S, σ/τ, and S2σ/τ on the Fermi level (EF), keeping EF of the undoped compounds fixed at 0 eV. A positive EF signifies n-type doping, while a negative EF means p-type doping. The type of doping is also reflected in the sign of the Seebeck coefficient (S). Generally, S peaks at small doping levels and approaches values close to zero at large concentrations. Electrical conductivity (σ/τ) depends directly on the DOS, thus the behavior of σ(EF) and DOS (D(ε)) are very similar.
The TE power factor P(=S2σ/τ) is noticeably large and exhibits multiple peaks in the energy window chosen. We classify these peaks into three categories (type-I, type-II and type-III) based on their origin and assess their relevance to applications by their proximity to the undoped Fermi level (see Table 2). The type-I peak occurs for doping concentrations where D(ε) (and correspondingly σ(ε)) is large (see eqn (3)). The maximum of the peaks in the power factor of the materials studied here is invariably (except for strained38 PbTe) in the type-I peak. In most cases, the type-II peak in P occurs in the vicinity of the peak in S which is caused by a sharp energy dependence of D(ε) (i.e. large ), and occurs close to the undoped EF (for example, in YPtBi). Though these peaks are smaller in magnitude, they are more relevant to applications as they correspond to modest doping. The type-III peak in P as a function of Fermi energy appears when maxima in both  and S are close to each other, and arise as a convolution of type-I and type-II peaks. In the constant scattering time approximation, electronic conductivity increases with temperature (as the effects of temperature dependent scattering with time are neglected). Thus, it follows from eqn (1), (3) and (6) that P, σ/τ and S of topological nontrivial materials (either with a finite gap or a vanishing gap) show similar behavior to that of a semiconductor with temperature, though the required doping levels for maximal P depend only slightly on temperature. We now discuss the transport properties of each of the six compounds in detail. Here, we determine the direct implications of electronic structure of these materials to their thermoelectric power rather than comparing their thermoelectric performance, as the relaxation time (τ) varies from one material to another.
Table 2 Different types of peaks which appear in the power factor (P) of materials with their positions along the Fermi level (Epeak) marked with Roman numerals I, II, and III for type-I, type-II and type-III peaks respectively. Negative and positive values of the Epeak mean n- and p-type doping. Local maximum in power factor (Pmax) is given for each of the materials at 300 K in units of 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1

A Band and topological insulators
Strained37 β-As2Te3 has an electronic structure with a vanishing band gap (see Fig. 3a). As a result, it has nonzero DOS throughout the energy window chosen (see Fig. 2a). Furthermore, its DOS is symmetric about the Fermi level. As a result, we find that its power factor is also roughly symmetrical, exhibiting two peaks (type-I and type-II) for the n-type doping and two peaks (type-I and type-II) for the p-type doping (see Fig. 2a). A maximum power factor of 57 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1 is observed for p-type doping at EF = −0.44 eV (see Table 2). In contrast, the maximum power factor of unstrained β-As2Te3 (see Fig. 4b) is relatively weaker (∼40 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1) occurring in the n-type region. The peaks in the p-doped region of unstrained β-As2Te3 are about 2.5 times weaker than those of strained β-As2Te3, showing the tunability of thermoelectric properties with strain, as is the tunability of electronic topology.
 Fig. 3  Electronic structure of the bulk of the six materials under consideration calculated with spin–orbit coupling along the high symmetry directions of their Brillouin zones. Electronic structures for all these materials are calculated at their experimental lattice constants except for β-As2Te3 and PbTe for which their native states have trivial electronic topology (see Table 1). 
 Fig. 4  Electronic structure, density of states (DOS) and transport properties (S, σ/τ, P) of unstrained β-As2Te3 (a and b) and strained (εh = 0.02, aBI = 6.567 Å, Eg = 0.11 eV) PbTe (c and d). aBI is the lattice constant of the band insulating phase of PbTe. In b and d type-I, type-II and type-III peaks in the power factors (P) are marked, respectively, with Roman numerals I, II, and III. The results for three different temperatures 300 K, 400 K and 500 K are indicated with black (solid line), blue (dashed line) and red (dash dotted line) colors, respectively, in b and d. 
The electronic structure of PbTe at the experimental lattice constant (see Fig. S1, ESI†) exhibits a zero band gap, which is far from its experimentally observed band gap of 0.3–0.4 eV. DFT calculations are known to generally underestimate the electronic band gap (Eg), and this is further complicated here by the fact that the gap depends on strain. An Eg is central to the TE properties of a material, we calculate the electronic structure of PbTe at applied isotropic strain εh = 0.02 and εh = −0.0138 (strain is applied with respect to the experimental lattice constant, aexp). At εh = 0.02, PbTe is a band insulator (lattice constants; aBI) with a band gap of 0.11 eV (see Fig. 4c) and at εh = −0.01, PbTe is in the TCI phase (lattice constant; aTCI) with Eg = 0.1 eV (see Fig. 3c). Remarkably, the dependence of power factor on doping concentrations is quite similar at both the lattice constants (see Fig. 2c and 4d). While P exhibits no peaks for n-type doping (see Fig. 2c and 4d), we find two peaks when the Fermi level enters the VB. As can be expected for PbTe, the peaks have high power factors with rather similar strengths (70–90 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1) for both the band and topological insulating phases. We find that the only type-II peak occurs around EF = −0.18 eV (see Table 2), and therefore this is more relevant to achieving high performance TE experimentally. We also find that this peak is marginally stronger for the topological insulating phase (∼77 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1) than for the band insulating phase (∼72 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1), while their band gaps are similar. On applying larger compressive strains (εh = −0.014), the band gap of PbTe widens further to 0.23 eV (see Fig. S2, ESI†) leading to an enhancement in the type-II peak to ∼90 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1 with a large Seebeck coefficient, S (see ESI,† Fig. S3). This is rather interesting as the band gap of PbTe for εh = −0.014 is closer to the one observed experimentally, which is more appropriate to enhance the ZT of compounds with electronic structure similar to that of SnTe.18,19
BiTeCl is a large band gap (Eg = 0.5 eV) material (see Fig. 3b). Its conductivity is essentially zero for Fermi energy lying within the band gap (see Fig. 2b). Moreover, its DOS also grows very gradually on entering the VB and CB edges. It exhibits four peaks in its power factor, similar to β-As2Te3, with both n-type and p-type doping regions having both type-I and type-II peaks (see Fig. 2b). Among all the peaks, a maximum P (type-I) of 8 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1 appears at EF = 0.72 eV in the n-doped region (see Table 2). The low value of P in BiTeCl practically rules out its use for any thermoelectric applications.
B Topological, Dirac and Weyl semimetals
Na3Bi exhibits two types of peaks (type-I and type-II) in its power factor as a function of EF. A maximum power factor (type-I peak) of 10 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1 occurs at EF = 0.94 eV (see Table 2) for the n-doped region, while in the p-doped region it exhibits a type-II peak with a maximum power factor of 7.5 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1 (see Table 2). Unlike strained β-As2Te3, the variation in its DOS with energy is rather weak, thereby leading to a relatively small S and P.
YPtBi is a zero band gap material and its DOS increases rather sharply at EF = 0.44 eV due to the lowest conduction band which is flat (see Fig. 3d). However, due to its low S and σ, its thermoelectric power is rather small, with both type-I and type-II peaks in the n-doped region (see Fig. 2d). YPtBi belongs to the class of group IIIB-(Ni, Pd, Pt) type half-Heusler (HH) alloys,40 which, based on their n-type power factors, are expected to perform better as a thermoelectric material than the widely studied group IVB-Ni type HHs.45–48 The maximum power factor (type-I peak) of YPtBi is 18 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1, close to the maximum n-type power factors among HHs (LaPdBi with P of 25 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1).40 Unlike other materials studied here, the S of YPtBi increases with temperature, which could favor its use in high temperature thermoelectric transport applications.
TaAs has a very small band gap (0.032 eV), and it exhibits only a single type-III peak (maximum power factor of 53 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1) in the power factor. This peak in P occurs at a low concentration of n-type doping around EF = 0.085 eV. This single large peak arises from the coincidence of the maxima of S and . The maximum of P of this compound is similar in magnitude to the maximum P of β-As2Te3 (i.e. 57 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1). Hence, we predict that TaAs, whose TE properties are yet to be explored experimentally, could be a high performance TE material.
V Discussion
A Multiple band extrema and sub-band structure
Both strongly dispersing and dispersion-less flat electronic bands play different roles in enhancing the TE properties.49 For example, flat bands increase the DOS and contain high effective mass charge carriers suitable for a large thermopower S (see eqn (1)), whereas bands with high curvature on the other hand contain light charge carriers favorable for electronic conductivity (see eqn (2)). Amongst the compounds considered here, only YPtBi and TaAs contain transition metal (d-type valence electrons) atoms. Except for YPtBi however, bands of all other compounds are rather strongly dispersing (see Fig. 3). Despite this fact, we find a strong contrast in the TE properties of these compounds. For example, among Na3Bi and strained38 β-As2Te3 with zero band gaps, Na3Bi is a poor thermoelectric (see Fig. 2e), while strained β-As2Te3 (see Fig. 2a) exhibits a high P for both p- and n-type doping (see Table 2). To understand this, we compare the electronic structure of the two compounds (see Fig. 3a & e). We notice that the electronic structure of strained β-As2Te3 exhibits numerous extrema (peaks) in its electronic bands close to the Fermi level other than its VBM and CBM (see Fig. 3a). For example, it has valence band extrema (VBE) lying along the Γ–Z–F–Γ–L paths. These VBE are within 0.3 eV below the Fermi level and enhance the DOS. These VBE also favor electronic conductivity as they contain light hole carriers, thereby enhancing P in both ways. Undoped Na3Bi does not exhibit VBE or conduction band extrema (CBE) (see Fig. 3e) around the Fermi level (within ∼1 eV), and is a relatively poorer TE.
Due to rather similar dispersion of electronic bands of most compounds studied here (except YPtBi), we identify the presence of these features of extrema in the electronic structure as the criterion for large power factor in topologically non-trivial materials. This manifests quite clearly in the electronic structure of PbTe and TaAs (see Fig. 3c and f) which exhibit significant P for only one type of doping (see Fig. 2c and f). This is due to the striking difference in the DOS of the VB and the CB (see Fig. 2c and f) of these compounds. Similar to strained β-As2Te3 (see Fig. 3a), TaAs exhibits CBE along Σ1–Z and Γ–X, and VBE along N–Σ1–Z, which enhance the DOS. Moreover, closely spaced peaks in the spin-split bands of TaAs along Σ–N–Σ1 around the Fermi level could be controlled favorably towards band convergence, which can enhance the TE performance. Similarly, PbTe exhibits VBE along W–Γ–X which gives rise to a sharp increase in its DOS (see Fig. 2c) of its VB. The power factor of YPtBi also exhibits moderate values only for n-type doping (see Table 2), due to the large DOS of its CB however arising from a relatively flat d band just above the undoped Fermi level (see Fig. 3d). Thus, electronic bands of topologically non-trivial materials are usually strongly dispersing, and large values of P are observable mostly when the band structure has other VBE/CBE (or peaks) lying close (within 0.5 eV) to the VBM/CBM.
B Tunability with strain: ETT and convergence of bands
The thermoelectric power factors of TIs and TCIs are found to be quite sensitive to strain. On applying large enough compressive strains (εh = −0.014), thermoelectric power of PbTe increases from 72 → (see Fig. 4d) to 90 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1 (see Fig. S3, ESI†) due to the widening of the band gap from 0.11 eV (see Fig. 4c) to 0.23 eV (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Our estimates of Eg at the experimental lattice constants of PbTe is 0 eV which is far from its experimental value, implying that the actual strain required to obtain larger band gaps in the TCI phase of PbTe might be a bit larger than the one estimated here (εh = −0.014). However, our results suggest a robust mechanism for enhancement of P in topologically nontrivial materials in general. Due to the phenomenon of band inversion, the CB and the VB can be inverted and the band gap of bulk TIs and TCIs can be closed and reopened with application of pressure or strain. This provides a unique way of controlling Eg of those materials which is central to their TE properties. Eg of a material undergoing an ETT can be increased upon application of appropriate compressive stresses, irrespective of whether they are in their BI or TI phases. Compressive stresses on TE modulators, which are typically flat devices, can be achieved readily by applying a mechanical load, which is much more practical than the application of shear or tensile stresses. A small Eg is a primary concern in materials such as SnTe (Eg = 0.18 eV at 300 K) which otherwise have a suitable electronic structure for TE applications. As PbTe is in the vicinity of an ETT, its Eg can be tuned by applying external stresses. Thus, we argue that TE devices based on small Eg TIs/TCIs can operate more efficiently under mechanical load.
The change in Eg of β-As2Te3 with strain (see Fig. 3a and 4a) results in considerable changes in its transport properties. While the maximum Seebeck coefficient (Smax) in strained β-As2Te3 (see Fig. 2a) decreases by 45% compared to Smax of unstrained β-As2Te3 (see Fig. 4b), its electrical conductivity (σ) increases by a factor of ∼3. While P in the n-doped region remains similar, it increases by a factor of ∼3 for p-type doping on application of uniaxial strain which shifts the maximum of the peaks in P from the n-doped to p-doped region. This asymmetric increase in P is attributed to the stronger energy dependence of DOS of the VB of strained β-As2Te3. The origin of this enhanced DOS of strained β-As2Te3 lies in the convergence of valence bands induced by strain. The VBE-like features along the Z–F–Γ paths of ambient β-As2Te3 converge into a smaller energy range on application of strain (εzz = −0.07), thereby increasing the DOS near the VBM. As discussed above, strained β-As2Te3 also exhibits additional VBEs along Γ–Z–F–Γ–L, and exhibits superior thermoelectric properties. Experimentally synthesized β-As2Te3 doped with Sn, however, are intrinsically hole doped because of native defects and shows a maximum ZT of 0.65 at 423 K.31 On the other hand, our calculations suggest that the asymmetric increase in P favoring p-type doping on application of uniaxial stress could increase the ZT of β-As2Te3 significantly.
Our analysis of TE performance of topologically non-trivial bulk phases of the materials does not include the effects of their conducting surface states. Secondly, the stress induced band convergence observed in β-As2Te3 may not be unique only to topological insulators. Thus, it would be interesting to identify conditions under which the topological non-trivial phase of a material (e.g. a TI) could outperform the corresponding trivial phase (e.g. a BI) of the same compound. Based on our results, we believe that the TE performance of a TI phase is better than that of its BI phase due to the association of its electronic structure features with band inversion (see Fig. 5 for a schematic of band edges associated with BI and TI phases). Band inversion in a TI phase leads to extra sharp edges in the DOS of its VB and CB, in addition to the VBM and the CBM resulting in a higher DOS of the light carrier bands. This is one of the recipes for attaining high power factors in bulk TIs.
 Fig. 5  Schematic picture of band inversion between the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM). Band insulator and topological insulator are denoted BI and TI respectively. Due to band inversion, in the TI phase, the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level is higher than that of band insulator. 
Thus, not all materials with nontrivial electronic topology exhibit superior thermoelectric performance. Indeed, a Dirac semi-metal with a vanishing gap may not exhibit high electrical conductivity or Seebeck coefficient. We do demonstrate that a topological insulating state of the same compound has better thermoelectric properties than its normal insulating state. Since the nontrivial electronic topology is characterized essentially by a quantized invariant, it is not quite possible to connect such an integer (electronic topology) to thermoelectric properties in a simple way. Instead, we connect the two by identifying the mechanisms of high thermoelectric performance in terms of features of electronic structure that are seen in topological materials. Most materials with nontrivial electronic topology exhibit electronic topological transitions (ETT) induced by strain or pressure.14,51 A typical ETT between trivial and nontrivial topological insulators involves band inversion or the reversal of the sign of the effective masses. This results in multiple extrema in the valence and conduction bands giving an asymmetry to the nature of valence and conduction bands. Secondly, the sensitivity of electronic structure of these materials to strain (or electron–phonon coupling) is responsible for the tunability of the band extrema and hence the thermoelectric properties through “band convergence”.3
Amongst the new materials investigated here, the maximum power factor of n-doped TaAs (see Fig. 2f) is similar (53 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1) to that of good TE materials studied recently like β-As2Te331 (which has a maximum power factor of 57 × 1014 μW cm−1 K−2 s−1, see Table 2). The electronic band gap of TaAs can be increased through suitable alloying which may enhance its TE power factor considerably. Furthermore, due to the heavy atomic masses of Ta and As and low frequencies of vibration, a low lattice conductivity is also expected, which would increase the ZT of TaAs. Since the spin–orbit coupling is often responsible for nontrivial electronic topology, many of the compounds with nontrivial topology involve heavy elements, and hence have low elastic moduli and thermal conductivity which add to their thermoelectric efficiency.
VI Summary
Our theoretical analysis of thermoelectric properties of topologically non-trivial materials reveals that (a) topological insulators with small band gaps are excellent TEs, while Dirac semimetals may not be quite so, (b) while topological semimetals exhibit relatively poorer TE power, a Weyl semimetal shows good TE power factor. We identify two mechanisms: (i) band inversion at an electronic topological transition results in many local extrema in the valence and conduction bands, enhancing the density of electronic states and its asymmetry near the Fermi level to give enhanced conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, and (ii) energies of the extrema in the VB and the CB can be controlled with external strain facilitating band convergence,3 which is key to TE properties. Thus, the power factor exhibits multiple peaks (type-I, type-II and type-III) as a function of Fermi energy or doping, which can be tuned with strain. We demonstrated that the band convergence in p-type β-As2Te3 with −7% strain enhances its power factor by a factor of 3. Similar effects found in PbTe suggest that TE modulators based on such TIs could operate more efficiently under weak stress. Among the topological and band insulating states of a compound with the same band gap, TE performance of the TI state is superior. Finally, we predict that TaAs, a Weyl semimetal, is a promising TE and should be explored experimentally.

β-As2Te3 is a band insulator but it undergoes electronic topological transition at εzz = −0.05. So here, we are calculating the transport properties at εzz = −0.07 where β-As2Te3 is in the topological insulating state.
PbTe is a band insulator at ambient pressure. According to our first-principles calculation, at the experimental lattice constant (aexp = 6.4384 Å50), PbTe exhibits zero band gap (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). To compare the thermoelectric performance of the band insulating and topological crystalline insulating phases, we increased the lattice constant isotropically by 2% and decreased it by 1%, respectively, with respect to aexp. With these values of strains, both the TI and BI phases have comparable band gaps of 0.1 and 0.11 eV respectively. We also calculate the electronic structure and transport properties of PbTe with −1.4% hydrostatic strain, where it has a band gap of 0.23 eV. The results corresponding to −1.4% isotropic strain are given in Fig. S3 of the ESI†.
