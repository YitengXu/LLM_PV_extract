    , Accepted 17th April 2014First published on 17th April 2014AbstractAtomic-scale percolation phenomena of electric and thermal conductivity were found in digenite CuxS. Copper ions are randomly located between the closely packed sulphur ions and jump to another position via unoccupied interstices. Near the percolation threshold value (fc ∼ 0.3) in the conductive region, a 60% enhancement of ZT value can be obtained. This indicates that the percolation phenomena can provide a new strategy to optimize the properties of thermoelectric materials, especially for quasi disordered materials.
Thermoelectric materials1,2 have an important role in solving the global sustainable energy problem to ensure longer energy autonomy, and significantly reduce fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions.3,4 The challenges focus on developing new materials with higher figure of merit, ZT, values and low cost.5 The leading materials are mainly based on bismuth telluride6 or lead telluride,7 which have high ZT value and are suitable for power generation applications or refrigeration. However, tellurium is extremely scarce in the Earth's crust, and tellurium and lead are toxic to human beings. There is an urgent demand to develop nontoxic, inexpensive alternative materials without using rare elements.8–10 CuxS has been studied for potential application as a p-type semiconductor in solar energy materials with high efficiency.11 Recently, this compound was found to have good thermoelectric properties, which has made chalcogenides become a new hot spot as low cost and environmentally friendly thermoelectric compounds (for example, Bi2S3,12 CuFeS2,13 CuSnS,14 and BiCuSeO (ref. 15)).
In order to improve the efficiency of thermal and electrical conversion, it is necessary to pursue higher ZT values. Until now, three strategies have been successfully adopted to realize higher ZT values: (i) band engineering with resonant doping; (ii) the electronic density of states' distortion; and (iii) the reduction of lattice thermal conductivity via increased phonon scattering in nanostructured materials. Percolation theory has been intensively employed to improve the physical properties of heterogeneous materials. According to this theory, there are dramatic changes in the transport properties when minor phase particles form a percolating network in the micro/nanometer scale in composites of two or more phases with totally different physical properties.16 Some inorganic/organic thermoelectric nanocomposite materials were fabricated in order to obtain lower thermal conductivity and higher ZT value near the critical condition of percolation.17,18 However, the interfaces between the two phases weakened its effect. In this paper, steady atomic-scale percolation was found in digenite CuxS compounds with single phase at high temperature (150 °C). The unoccupied copper lattice interstices behave as the minor percolating phase and an obvious enhancement of ZT values was obtained near the percolation threshold.
For CuxS, there exist various mineral forms in which the locations of Cu atoms in the S lattice are not well identified and their position changes as a function of x. Meanwhile the phase transformation of CuxS phases is very sensitive to applied pressure during specimen preparation.19 Of the copper rich compositions, the experimentally proved stable structures of CuxS at room temperature are chalcocite (Cu2S), djurleite (Cu1.94S), digenite (Cu1.8S), and anilite (Cu1.75S). At higher temperature, the four sulfides are structurally disordered superionic conductors.20 At room temperature, as shown in Fig. 1(a), CuxS (1.75 > x > 1) is a mixture of anilite and covellite phases (CuS); Cu1.75S should have the anilite structure, which is naturally a p-type semiconductor due to the Cu vacancies.11 CuxS (1.87 > x > 1.75) should be the digenite phase. Morimoto et al.21 observed that the digenite-type solid solution is metastable at room temperature and decomposes into mixtures of anilite and djurleite below 72 °C. Wei S. et al. used the density functional theory method to prove that anilite is the most stable structure when x > 1. There are a few reports about the synthesis of anilite Cu1.75S. Simonescu et al. prepared anilite Cu1.75S nanocrystallites by hydrolytic decomposition of the filtrate,22 and there were only three XRD peaks at 2theta values of 26, 32 and 45° which belong to the digenite structure. In our work, all of the CuxS (x from 1.7 to 1.9, this ratio is from the starting mixed composition) samples sintered from ball milled powders have a similar crystal structure, which can be perfectly indexed to the digenite phase (R3m (166) space group, PDF card #47-1748), as shown in Fig. 1(b). It indicates that the digenite structure can be more stable than anilite when obtained by mechanical alloying. This may be explained by the high impact force19 generated between the milling balls during the ball milling process making the digenite structure more stable. (However, higher force leads to the appearance of Cu1.96S, as seen in Fig. S1 in the ESI.‡) Meanwhile, the high cooling rate after the ball milling process may also improve the stability of the digenite structure.

For CuxS (1.8 ≥ x ≥ 1.7), the low temperature digenite (which is confirmed by Fig. 1(b)) can transform into high temperature digenite at ∼100 °C. For CuxS (x ≥ 1.8), this phase transition is consistent with Fig. 1(a).19 According to the fitting of the XRD data based on the information of PDF 47-1748 (digenite), Cu1.7S and Cu1.75S have similar lattice parameters (a = b = 3.9238, c = 48.137 for Cu1.7S; a = b = 3.921, c = 48.132 for Cu1.75S), which indicates that the addition of more copper ions into the lattice does not obviously affect the lattice constants. For Cu1.8S, most peaks also do not move obviously, comparable with Cu1.7S and Cu1.75S. However, some peaks (i.e. ∼29° for (107)) shift to the right. The lattice constants are a = b = 3.8707 and c = 48.209. This illustrates that further addition of the copper ions increases the c axis and simultaneously decreases the a and b axes of the unit cell. In the following section, the thermoelectric properties at higher temperature are discussed based on the high temperature digenite phase, in which sulphur ions are hexagonally close-packed (R3m at room temperature) and copper ions are located in the interstices between the sulphur ions.
Liu H. L.23 reported that the liquid-like behavior of copper ions in Cu2−xSe leads to enhanced ZT values. Miller T. A. et al.20 have demonstrated that the same phenomena should lead to similar transport properties for Cu2−-xS (above 150–200 °C). Copper ions are randomly distributed in the interstices of the sulphur anions. The compounds exhibit fast-ion conduction with liquid-like mobility,20 and the conduction of copper ions is produced by their jumping to unoccupied interstices. The copper vacancies (i.e. unoccupied interstices) can be regarded as the conductive media in a percolation system. In one sulphur hexagonal unit cell (6-CuxS), there are 6 sulphur atoms and 18 interstices. In a simple rigid model, the content of the conductive minor phase (fV) can be calculated as (18 − 6x)/24. The conductivity of the system near the metal–insulator transition can be described by the percolation equations with power laws (σ ∝ (fc − fV)−s for fV < fc, and σ ∝ ( fV − fc)t for fV > fc, where fV is the volumetric fraction of the conductive second phase, fc is the percolation threshold, t is the critical exponent in the conducting region, and s is the critical exponent in the insulating region). Due to the limit of the composition ratios studied and the focus on thermoelectric properties, we only consider the t value in the conducting region, as shown in Fig. 2.24 For most semiconductors, phonons are the main energy carriers for heat conduction, and there are many models to describe the percolation of thermal conductivity, such as Monte Carlo simulations,25 Fourier's law,26 or a simplified random walk model.27
 Fig. 2  Dependence of the resistivity and lattice thermal conductivity of CuxS on the unoccupied interstice fraction fV = (18 − 6x)/24 at 200 °C. 
The fits of the conductivity data give fc = 0.3 (x = 1.8) for electrical conductivity, and fc = 0.31 (x = 1.75) for lattice thermal conductivity, which are higher than the values (0.29) predicted by theory.28 Considering similar thresholds for electric conductivity (electric scattering) and thermal conductivity (phonon scattering), the maximum ZT value should appear near fc ∼ 0.3.

Fig. 3(a) shows the temperature-dependent resistivity data of CuxS. The electrical resistivity is determined competitively by the carrier concentration and mobility as described by the equation, 1/ρ = pqμp, where ρ, p, q and μp are the electrical resistivity, the hole concentration, the electron charge, and the carrier mobility, respectively. In the temperature dependent resistivity curve, there is a minimum at different temperatures, which indicates a phase transition from low temperature digenite to high temperature digenite.29 At higher temperature, the resistivity of compounds increases with increasing temperature due to the boost of the ions' thermal vibration due to the nature of ionic conductivity. The compounds with high temperature digenite structure exhibit fast-ion conduction and the carrier concentration (Cu+ and Cu2+) decreases with increasing copper content.
 Fig. 3  The temperature dependence of: (a) resistivity; (b) Seebeck coefficient; and (c) power factor for CuxS. 

Fig. 3(b) shows the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient. The Seebeck coefficient of Cu1.7S is about 10 μV K−1 at room temperature, and then decreases with temperature (the value is near zero at 200 °C). With increasing temperature, the Seebeck coefficient of Cu1.75S increases from 10 to 45 μV K−1 between room temperature and 350 °C. This is because the boost of the ions' thermal vibration decreases the carrier mobility. Cu1.75S, Cu1.8S and Cu1.85S have a similar dependence of the Seebeck coefficient with temperature. In these CuxS compositions, Cu ions work as charge carriers via Cu vacancies. With increasing x, the effective charge carrier density decreases due to a lower content of Cu vacancies. Meanwhile, the average distance between Cu vacancies also increases, which results in the charge mobility decrease due to the longer distance for Cu ions to jump. As a result, Cu1.85S has a higher Seebeck coefficient. For Cu1.7S, the Seebeck coefficient is much lower, and between 100 °C and 250 °C this value is near zero. In this temperature range, the second phase, CuS, may appear and significantly diminish the Seebeck effect according to Fig. 1(a). As shown in Fig. 3(c), at 350 °C, Cu1.75S, Cu1.8S and Cu1.85S have similar power factors of between 450 and 500 μW mK−2. In contrast, Cu1.7S has a much lower power factor, below 100 μW mK−2, because it has the lowest Seebeck coefficient in the CuxS system.

Fig. 4(a) shows the specific heat of Cu1.8S. There is a maximum peak at ∼100 °C, which indicates the phase transition from a low temperature digenite phase to a high temperature digenite phase, and this is consistent with the resistivity data (Fig. 3(a)). The reduction of the specific heat with temperature can be explained by local atomic jumping and rearrangement of liquid-like copper ions.23 The electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity complies with the Wiedemann–Franz (WF) law (kel = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number, taken to be 1.5 × 10−8 W Ω K−2).5 As shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), Cu1.7S and Cu1.75S have a similar thermal conductivity (k and klatt). For phonon scattering, the percolation threshold, fc, is ∼0.31. With increasing copper content, more interstitial sites are occupied by Cu ions, and Cu1.8S and Cu1.85S have a much lower lattice thermal conductivity (∼1–2 W mK−1), which indicates that the phonons are scattered by copper ions. As a result, Cu1.85S has a lower lattice thermal conductivity, and has the highest ZT value of 0.11 at 350 °C as shown in Fig. 4(d).

Conclusions
Thermoelectric CuxS (x = 1.7, 1.75, 1.8 and 1.85) with stable digenite phase was prepared via mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering. In these non-stoichiometric compounds, the percolation phenomena of the electrical and lattice thermal conductivities with fc ∼ 0.3 were found to be due to the disordered distribution of copper vacancies in the interstices of closely packed sulphur ions. Near the threshold of electric conductivity (fc ∼ 0.3, i.e. Cu1.85S), a ZT value of ∼0.11 at 350 °C was achieved. The enhancement (60%) produced by percolation can also be used in other disordered materials to optimize their thermoelectric properties.
