    , Accepted 17th July 2019First published on 17th July 2019AbstractGlobal warming has been a serious concern worldwide. Greenhouse gases like CO2 majorly contribute to the rise in average global temperature. Attempts have been made to reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere. However, carbon capture alone was not found to be commercially viable. Various other green and cost-effective methods to convert CO2 into more useful products have been researched. CO2 methanation was found to be one such vital reaction of converting CO2 to useful fuel, like methane, using different catalysts. In this paper, this vital reaction has been reviewed comprehensively. Studies conducted with respect to materials that have proven catalysts such as Ni, synthesised by impregnation, to be the most suitable, where use of promotors (like Si and Ce) and supports (like zeolites, ceria and MOFs), high pressures, low humidity and optimum temperatures have led to increased selectivity, have been presented. The different reactors/contactors that have been used in this process at various scales, their design parameters, process conditions, performance, and limitations have been discussed which have shown the use of annular fixed bed reactors to be the most favourable. The different mechanisms proposed for the reaction, involving various intermediates, mainly carbenes and formates, and problems incurred in low temperature operation and finding of an appropriate support and promotor have been presented. Thermo-kinetic modelling studies on this reaction have also been presented and discussed. Every section has been summarized in the form of a table. The recent advances as well as future challenges and prospects of the above-said aspects of CO2 methanation have also been cited. Recent advances suggest methods of electrocatalytic reduction potentially employing Cu based compounds and perovskite oxides as catalysts, bio-electrocatalytic reduction using microbes as catalysts, and photocatalytic reduction using noble or critical metals including Ni and TiO2 as catalysts and graphene as a support, for the conversion of carbon dioxide to methane.
1. Introduction
CO2 emission is a major cause of concern in the present-day world as it leads to global warming. This is bound to continue for the next few decades as fossil fuels would remain the major source of power generation, leading to enhanced CO2 emissions. The present statistics have shown that global warming, that is already alarming, leading to undesired effects on the environment like continuous increase in temperature, sea level, and the occurrence of storms and floods, is only expected to escalate soon. Studies have suggested that 35.7 Gt of CO2 would be released into the environment by the year 2040, which is far worse than what planet earth can sustain.1 Our reviews and technical articles, on different aspects of carbon capture as a potential solution to global warming by greenhouse gases, especially CO2, have been reported.2–5 In these reports, the developmental trends of various technical options of carbon capture viz., absorption, adsorption, membrane separation, chemical looping combustion, etc. along with prospects and challenges, were presented. Stability and capture enhancement using coal fly ash doped sorbents during high-temperature carbon capture, along with kinetics of carbonation and calcination, were reported.6,7 We have also reported the role of CO2 methanation on the kinetics of CO oxidation using a Cu/Co3O4 catalyst system.8
Hence, the focus of researchers has slowly shifted from carbon capture alone to ways of converting CO2 into economically useful forms, like the topic of the current study, CO2 methanation. It has become a popular method as it serves a dual purpose of converting environmentally harmful CO2 into useful product methane, which is a very prominent source of energy, thereby reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. CH4 is one of the energy vectors that could be used to store energy, and is only next to H2 in its calorific value.
Another major reason why CO2 methanation gained recognition was the need to shift to renewable sources of energy from fossil fuels. Earth's fossil fuel reserves are limited in quantity and as the demand of fuel increases, the sources are only getting depleted. Though several renewable energy resources are being tapped, such as wind energy, tidal energy, solar energy, etc., they mostly suffer from lower energy efficiencies and, hence, low economic viabilities. Thus, there is a strong need for clean energy sources that are not only efficient but also have lower carbon footprint.1 Conversion of CO2 into methane, as a process, involves the usage of electrical energy. CH4 has lower cost than H2 and higher density, which allows easy handling and large-scale transport. The major difficulty is in the hydrogenation of CO2, which requires an 8-electron transfer mechanism, that is relatively difficult to perform on CO2, vis-à-vis CO, leading to a competition between the two species for methanation to occur.9
Sabatier reaction was the oldest and the first methanation reaction to have been developed and is still used to develop the reactor and thermodynamic models.10 The power-to-gas concept has been used in several models to study the methanation mechanism, select the contactors, critically analyse factors influencing the efficiency of the process and its integration with different types of carbon capture units.11,12 Several methods have been developed to increase selectivity towards CO2 methanation. Several catalysts played a critical role in enhancing selectivity towards CO2 that has been discussed at length in the following sections. Apart from the catalysts employed, supports and promotors have also helped significantly, like in the case of Ni-based catalysts in further enhancing the selectivity.13
According to the reaction thermodynamics studied so far, the reaction is favoured when T < 873K.14 The factors like length of contactor, space–time, and reactant concentration were found to affect the temperature profile, which in turn depicted the overall performance of the model. Thus, a careful selection of parameters was highly imperative to get the desired results, as has been reported by several studies.
This review gives a comprehensive analysis of the developmental trends in CO2 methanation along with future challenges and prospects. Various factors like different mechanisms proposed, catalysts developed, contactors used, thermodynamic and kinetic models have been considered for the study. In the catalysts section, the composition, synthesis protocols, operating conditions, performance, promotors and supports used have been considered. In the reactor section, the scale, nature of reactor, critical design and process parameters, performance along with merits and demerits have been taken for analysis. For modelling studies, the main governing equation, assumptions taken, results of the model along with its limitations have been compared. Every section has been summarized in the form of a table for getting a glimpse of all vital aspects.
2. Methanation reaction and material aspects
2.1 Methanation mechanism
CO2 methanation reaction is a very important reaction converting CO2 to useful CH4. Different mechanisms have been proposed for the reaction, forming various reaction intermediates with several controlling factors. The reaction mechanism is a step by step sequence of elementary reactions to achieve the overall reaction. A mechanism should account for the transition states, the activated complexes formed and the various stoichiometric factors. Intermediates have a short life span to form the product (or other intermediates). FTIR results were used to determine the mechanisms experimentally. This technique was used to determine an IR spectrum of absorption or emission of a solid, liquid or gas by acquiring data across a wide spectral range by considering a beam of various frequencies, and estimating the amount that was absorbed by the sample and the corresponding wavelength, specific to the intermediate proposed to be formed. Another technique used was DRIFTS, which in addition to the above, takes into account the diffused reflection, which gets produced due to the sample's rough surface and helps in obtaining various properties like refractive index and reflectivity, using the sample collected by a paraboloid mirror. In the FTIR test, 2350 cm−1, 2040 cm−1, 2945 cm−1, and 2845 cm−1 correspond to CO2(g), CH4 and formate species (intermediates) respectively, which were used to validate a mechanism. While the band at approximately 1300 cm−1 corresponds to inorganic carboxylate, the bands between 1300–1420 cm−1 correspond to carbonates bidentate species, originating from CO2 adsorption on ceria.15

(A) Formates as intermediates. 
One of the widely used mechanisms of CO2 methanation was with formate species as intermediates due to the formation of vacant oxygen sites. The mechanism can be explained by the following sub reactions. H2 + 2M* → 2HM*(1) HM* + O* → OH* + M*(2) (3) OCO* + OH* → OCOOH* + O*(4) OCOOH* + H2 → OCOH* + H2O(5) OCOH* + H2 → OCOOH* + O*(6) (7) (8) (9) OCOH* + O* → OCO* + OH*(10) OCOOH* + OH* → OCO* + H2O(11) OCO* → CO + O*(12)


(B) Hydrogen and formates as intermediates on alumina and Ni based catalysts. 
In this mechanism, the first step was the formation of the hydrogen intermediate provided by the support metal, followed by the process of chemisorption, leading to the formation of surface hydroxyl and bidentate carbonate intermediates and finally the formation of the formate intermediate, which acts as the rate determining step (RDS). The methoxy form was then obtained, that finally terminated the reaction with the formation of carbon monoxide. Good catalytic activity was exhibited with mixed oxygen sites playing crucial role.16
Path 1 A-D-OHCO2/H2 → A-DH2-OCCOH*(13) A-DH2-OCCOH*H2 → TS → CH4 + A-D(14)
Path 2 A-DO* → A-DH2-OCO* → A-DH2-OCOH* → CH4 + A-D(15)where A = Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and D = Ni.


(C) Mono- and bidentates as intermediates on alumina and Ni based catalysts. 
In the case of alumina as a catalyst, monodentate and bidentate intermediates were formed. Hydrogenation of bidentate formate was found to be the RDS. No CO2 was adsorbed due to strong basic sites and it was found to be ineffective at high temperatures. This mechanism can be written as below A-D-OHCO2/H2 → A-DH2-OCCOH*(16) A-DH2-OCCOH*H2 → TS → CH4 + A-D(17)where A = Al2O3 and D = Ni.


(D) Carbenes as intermediates on ceria-based catalysts. 
One of the most commonly used catalysts in CO2 methanation was ceria (CeO2), generally with transition metals such as Ni and Rh as supports for providing hydrogen atoms. Ceria led to the bulk formation of oxygen vacancies resulting in oxidation and surface hydrogenation reactions. H2 and CO2 adsorption occurred in a dissociative way to form hydrogen atoms, CO and oxygen atoms. Further dissociation of adsorbed carbon and carbene intermediates yielded CH4 and atomic oxygen to form H2O. The structure of ceria also played an important role and the product could change if it acted as nano-cubes (NC) or nano-rods (NR). With ceria as catalyst and Rh as support, generation of Ce3+ was seen along with surface hydroxyl and oxygen vacancies, which led to formate and eventually resulted in methanol production. On hydrogenation, the required methane was formed.16,17 This mechanism is shown below Ce(IV)–O → Ce(III)(18) Ce(III) + CO2 → Cads. [Adsorbed Carbon](19) Rh + H2 → RhH2(20) RhH2 + Cads. → CH4(21)
Jaquemin et al.,18 conducted experimental studies to verify whether Al2O3 could be used as a catalyst at low temperatures. It was found to be feasible, but any possible mechanism could not be concluded. It was believed that the first step could be chemisorption followed by a CO dissociation step, finally leading to reaction with hydrogen. This was very important as, generally, methanation was only done at very high temperatures. However, methanation at low temperatures could be frequently used in the industries for enhanced energy efficiencies. Adsorption could be improved by catalyst reduction as carbon dioxide oxidizes the catalysts. As it is purely inorganic, it could be done at low temperatures with ease.


(E) Formates as intermediates on ceria-based catalysts. 
Another mechanism with ceria-based catalysts was proposed for CO2 methanation, mostly for low activation temperatures. Formate dissociation to methanol was found to be the RDS as shown below. The intrinsic structure–activity correlation for various catalysts were also reported.19 (22) (23) OCOOH* → CH3OH(24) CH3OH → CH4(25)


(F) Carbenes and hydrogen as intermediates on transition metal catalysts. 
Transition metals can also be used as catalysts, though the drawback was CO formation, which acted as a major inhibitor at the expense of high methane selectivity. Different types of surface intermediates along with carbene and atomic hydrogen were formed. Carbon hydrogenation was found to be the RDS, especially at high temperature, while CO dissociation was so at low T (525–575 K). The mechanism using these transition metals can be given as follows20 H2 + 2* → 2H*(26) CO2 + 2* → CO* + O*(27) CO* → CO + O*(28) CO* + O* → C* + O*(29) C* + H* → CH* +*(30) (31) (32) (33) (34) O* + H* → OH* + H*(35) OH* + H* → H2O* + *(36) (37)
Several mechanisms have been developed as discussed above. The purpose of all these mechanisms was to provide the best alternative method with which methanation should be performed in the industries. Several conditions were also studied, such as mechanisms under conditions of low as well as high temperatures. Mechanisms under low temperatures were scanty due to higher energy requirements of the process.16,17 Almost all mechanisms involved the formation of either carbene or formate intermediates on catalytic surfaces such as ceria, Ni, Rh, etc. which help in reducing the activation energy of the process. All the mechanisms involved several steps. Several challenges were encountered; the major challenge being the development of a catalyst able to perform methanation at relatively low temperatures to economize the process, while yet another challenge was to find an appropriate support, as well as a proper promotor.20 The prospects for methanation mechanisms are to find an appropriate mechanism with Al2O3 as the main catalyst, as well as to find other mechanisms with materials such as zeolites, whose utility as catalysts for methanation is still being developed. Several new combinations of metals and promotors can be developed, especially the combination of Ni–Ce–Zr, Ni–Pd, Ni–Pt, and other such combinations and their efficiency be increased to make the process of methanation more economic as well as effective.

2.2 Materials
The methanation process was one of the methods used to convert harmful carbon emissions into useful methane, which could be used to store electric power generated from renewable sources of energy, such as wind turbines, though it had a lower calorific value as compared to hydrogen. The methanation of CO2 to CH4 was a difficult process in comparison to CO methanation due to an 8-electron reduction process that had to be accomplished to convert CO2 to CH4 and, thus, extensive control was necessary over reaction conditions. The current trend is to use a metal catalyst mounted on a metal oxide to accomplish this herculean task.21 The main challenges in this process were to increase the selectivity towards CO2, suppressing the formation of CO and, hence, CO methanation. Several techniques have been employed to enhance the selectivity by deploying effective promotors, catalysts, and appropriate process control.22
The process of methanation has become a necessity as it focuses on reducing environmental pollution. The syngas reaction has received wide attention as it converts a pollutant to a useful source of energy.23 Mesoporosity was very crucial for the catalysts that are used for the process as it was found to help prevent metal sintering and increased the selectivity.24 This section focuses on the various catalysts used in CO2 methanation, their performance, and the necessary process conditions to achieve the desired results.
Ni and Ru were two of the most studied and used transition metals for the process of methanation. Ru, in particular, had high stability, more selectivity and also had very high activity towards the methanation process, but it was fairly expensive as compared to Ni.25 The instability due to nickel was addressed by using promotors that prevent metal sintering due to interaction with CO2.6–28 Promotors such as Pd, Pt, and Rh were added to Ni, which then showed higher selectivity towards CO2 methanation. This was attributed to higher H2 adsorption and activation shown by these metals compared to simply Ni with Pd, showing the highest activity followed closely by Pt.28 Thus, adding promotors was found to play a significant role in the performance of the catalyst.
In most of the cases, the temperature at which a catalyst was developed played a key role in its performance. In a reported study, focused on understanding the effects of T and P effect on catalyst structure, an increase in P was found to increase the number of active sites, which also increased the catalytic activity. But the increase in T, though led to an increase in the decomposition of ATTM to MoS2, reduced the free active sites. Thus, the increase in temperature is a trade-off, with ideal conditions being T = 350 °C.29 The humidity also was found to play a major role in determining the percentage conversion that could be achieved in the methanation reaction. High levels of humidity were found to inhibit the water gas shift reaction by covering/blocking the catalytic surface, thereby reducing the ability of the catalyst to support methanation.30 Regarding the role of the CO2/H2 ratio, it was found that using excess hydrogen increased the degree of completion of the reaction.
Zeolites such as H-BETA, Na-BETA, ZSM-5, and MCM-41 were commonly used as supports to the metals to promote the selectivity in the reaction. Encapsulation was also found to have a positive influence in the creation of intra-particle voids and mesoporous nature, that would lead to better catalyst dispersion and, thus, higher activity. Characterization tools such as XRD, BET, CO2-TPD, H2-TPR, and XPS were used to analyse the properties of the supports, the crystallinity of the structure and its affinity to absorb CO2 and H2.31 The supports provided the catalyst with the required structural stability as well as the high surface area necessary for the process. More surface area implied more amount of free catalyst available for methanation and thus high selectivity.32 Various supports were also embedded with promotors, such as La, that helped improve the activity of the catalyst by inhibiting sintering as well as C deposition on the catalytic surface.33 In the case of SiO2, the use of Na promotor increased the activity of the catalyst as stated above.34 Quaternary disc-shaped catalysts have also been developed, by which larger amounts of NiO could move on the surface and thus the availability of free Ni increased, increasing methanation conversion.35 Besides supports, the extent of catalyst loading played a critical role in enhancing the selectivity. For SiO2, it was reported that 10–20 wt% gave the best performance w.r.t selectivity while Ni at 10 wt% with SiO2 as support had maximum impact on the reaction due to more active catalyst sites and available surface area.36,37 Materials such as La, Fe, Co, etc., when used as promotors, increased the activity of Ni by breaking the NiO bonds and thus increasing the overall available free Ni2+ ions for achieving high catalytic ability.38 Certain modifiers such as alumina also were found to increase the selectivity towards methanation by increasing the basicity of the adsorption active sites and formation of stable lanthanide-aluminate state during catalyst pre-treatment.39 Several metals, when co-precipitated with Ni, also showed high catalytic conversion towards methanation, which could be attributed to the synergistic effects between the metal (e.g. Fe, Co, La, Zr, Cu) and Ni in the co-precipitate.40,41 Several continuous steady-state reactions have also been developed in recent times. The reactors, thus, developed could run for 3–4 days and also produce consistently high yields of products. A 70% conversion has been obtained in the case of the tubular reactor for Ni supported by MgO4.2 The use of nanoparticles and nanosheets embedded with Ni led to better conversions due to the spontaneous formation of thin NiO layer and formation of free electrons, and adding promotors proved beneficial in methanation.43–45
Materials such as Rh and Ru have also been tested for methanation, though a high conversion was not obtained. Rh had low selectivity towards methanation at high temperatures,46 but loading the material on SiO2 was found to improve conversions, besides achieving 100% selectivity towards CO2 methanation.47 Ru especially exhibited low selectivity at high temperatures, and with H spill over, even conversions dropped.48 Ru conversion was observed to increase by the addition of alkali, which absorbed CO at higher temperatures and, thus, promoted methanation.49 Zeolites were also studied with unpromoted catalysts, showing very low selectivity towards CO2 methanation, which needs special attention by the researchers to develop novel synthesis protocols that could produce zeolites with desired structural attributes. But by adding promotors like Si and Ce, zeolites were reported to give higher yields.50,51
It was reported that supports such as ceria initially inhibited activity towards methanation, but over time, due to structural stability and reconstruction of hexagonal Ni nano crystallites to quasi-spherical particles, the stability, and activity increased.35 Thus, we could understand that ceria was one of the best catalysts supports promoting methanation, especially at lower temperatures with larger surface area.33,51 The stability could also be enhanced by adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which acted as a chelating agent.52 Other supports like TiO2–Al2O3–ZrO2 were attempted and it was found that TiO2 was very inefficient as catalyst support, while due to layered double hydroxide, Al2O3 showed good tendency to bond with other elements. It was also observed that silica gave higher conversion rates despite having a very low S.A.53 Interestingly, it was noticed that supports were not needed while using a mixture of Ni–Ce–Zr oxides or something similar, as each one of them could interchange the roles of catalyst and support. This was useful as it increased the number of oxygen sites54 which could also be achieved by the application of heat and light.55
The catalysts were usually prepared by the method of impregnation. The nature of the impregnation technique employed was found to influence the efficiency of the catalyst. In the impregnation of Ni/ZrO2 on CNT's, co-impregnation led to lower activity than sequential impregnation, which could be attributed to the fact that sequential impregnation leads to NiO nanoparticles that get deposited next to ZrO2 particles, increasing the Ni–ZrO2 extent and, thus, increased activity. One of the most common techniques used was of incipient wetness impregnation.56–59 This worked due to a capillary action and in this method, the active metal precursor was dissolved in aqueous solution, like nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate Ni (NO3)2·6H2O in case of nickel. Then, the metal-containing solution was added to the support, where the catalyst was affixed, containing the same pore volume as the volume of the solution. Two other commonly used synthesis methods were one-pot synthesis method, where a reactant was subjected to multiple surface activities within a single reactor, which led to improved efficiency and yield56,60 and sol–gel method in which a colloidal sol was formed leading to the formation of a gel-like diphasic system, containing both liquid and solid phases, which have wide ranges. The volume fraction of particles (or particle density) might have been so low that a significant amount of fluid might have to be removed initially for the gel-like properties to be recognized. There were chances of phase transformation.55,61,62 It was found that when plasma was added through a dielectric barrier discharge, various catalytic properties like the surface area (S.A.) and the anti-sintering properties were enhanced.63,64 Many unique, novel techniques could be used to increase precipitation, like using high-frequency ultrasound waves or by adding compounds like hydro calcites.54,65 Thermal decomposition was also reported for catalyst synthesis, with no supports, where direct heating provided sufficient energy for the process to complete.65 It was also found that the performance of a transition metal oxide supports could be improved by doping with other transition metals.66
Recent reviews have compared the ability and working of catalysts synthesized by several methods, for example, the catalysts prepared by dielectric barrier discharge plasma method were found to be better than those prepared by calcination methods.67 All these methods depict various ways in which a catalyst could be moulded to show higher selectivity towards methanation and also to provide better yields. In recent studies, MOFs also were reported to be used as supports in CO2 methanation with great success. These are compounds consisting of metal ions, coordinated to organic ligands to form one-, two-, or three-dimensional structures. They were found to be very efficient due to their tendency to form Lewis acids and the presence of pores, which increase the surface area and, thus, the catalytic activity. One of the commonly used MOFs was UiO-66 made up of [ZrO4(OH)4] clusters with 1,4-benzodicarboxylic acid struts.68 Similarly, olivine, a commonly found magnesium iron silicate ore was also used. It tends to react highly with carbon dioxide and was found naturally.69 Even piezoelectric compounds like barium zirconate were used and were found to be of good use due to their ability to accumulate electric charge under the application of any kind of mechanical stress.59
Few studies were also reported using gold nanoparticles as a catalyst. Though they exhibited good selectivity, due to very poor conversion rates and the high cost, they were not commercially viable.70
The following plot (Fig. 1) gives a comparison of the materials discussed above.
 Fig. 1  Plot of conversion performance against material. 
From the graph, it can be inferred that the highest conversion was observed for Co, which was due to the high affinity of Co to undergo reduction as compared to any other material. Ni followed closely, as it showed structural instability when un-promoted and needed promotors to be able to perform methanation. The highest percentage conversion obtained in the case of Ni was due to the technique of reflux, which allowed constant surface area by which the amount of Ni required was reduced drastically (5.1 wt%) with extremely high conversion rates.39 The low performance of Fe could be attributed to carbon deposition on the surface of the catalyst.23 Zeolites showed higher conversion due to the higher surface area as well as a highly porous structure68 but only in the presence of suitable promotors like Ni.25,67 Rh showed the lowest conversion amongst all the materials with very poor selectivity towards CO2.46 To conclude, Ni was the best catalyst for the CO2 methanation process with much better performance that could be achieved by adding suitable promotors and modifiers.

3. Reactors/contactors
Reactors play a critical role in conducting an exothermic reaction like CO2 methanation to achieve desired results like conversion, yield and selectivity with high energy efficiency. The performance of the overall reactor–contactor system was influenced by the nature of coolants and heat exchangers used, besides providing stage-wise contact as well as steady and unsteady state working conditions.101 The importance of heat exchangers could be understood from the exothermicity of the reaction attaining temperatures as high as 8000 °C, which needed effective controls by using appropriate coolants, thermocouples, controlled gas flow rates and inserts. Stage wise and tubular contactors were commonly used to enable efficient heat transfer and to control flow rates. The following section focuses on different contactors used in the methanation process, their critical design and process parameters, scale and performance along with future challenges and prospects.
Among various contactors, fixed bed reactors were the most widely used. Fixed bed single-pass reactors were assumed to work at isothermal conditions which were verified by the usage of the sampling capillary or thermography techniques,102,103 which were also responsible for disrupting the flow regimes inside the reactor. The most interesting study was found to be the bioremediation of CO2 to methane. The process involved a ceramic membrane bioreactor at thermophilic conditions. The membrane technology used here enabled the efficient transfer of hydrogen from gas to liquid phase for bio methanation to occur. H2 had high selectivity towards the bacterial growth and the archaea developed were hydrogen trophic. A very high H2 utilization was observed in this method which was very efficient for proper utilisation of reactants.104 The fixed bed reactor system had different temperature zones necessitating the usage of thermocouples positioned in each zone. Catalysts to be used were embedded into the fixed bed and allowed to carry out the reaction under controlled flow rates of CO2 and H2. Studies have revealed that most of the bulk product contained CH4 and CO, and the steady-state conditions were achieved by allowing variation of the main reactor chamber by ±0.8%.105
Numerous studies have been reported on the extensive use of modelling techniques, such as MATLAB, to compare the experimental as well as theoretical values for various type of reactors. The modelling process involves solving complex material and energy balances to develop a kinetic model to be able to achieve comparable results. This particular study used discretization by setting a discretization step to 1 mm and assumed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Around 86% efficiency was obtained by the model.106 Modelling studies were also done on plate type reactor using COMSOL Multiphysics version 5.2 to generate a 1D model, followed by Ansys to extend it to a 3D configuration, but at high computational costs. The design assumed fixed wall temperature and inclusion of a steel matrix in the mesh structure to account for axial heat conduction of metal. The 1D model was used to examine the efficiency of the stage design, whereas the 3D model gave an overall design structure, considering the influence of the relevant parameters on its performance. The model, thus, developed was in good agreement with the original reactor performance and worked efficiently.107 In another study, which focussed on simulating 1D fixed-bed reactor model with recirculation, it was observed that this system allowed a range of partial and full loading operating conditions. In the case of product re-circulation, the product-gas helped to cool down the reactor. Also, maintaining a proper recycle ratio allowed higher methane yield besides lower start-up time of the reactor.108 Modelling studies were also conducted on the electrochemical process using fuel cells. The cells facilitated the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methane and store it in the form of reusable energy. The cells worked as a continuous operating system on stacking together, and could be of great use in near future.109 Certain reactors used a full loop system for the methanation process, in which the height of the inventory was kept low so that the catalyst particles, assumed to be spherical, did not succumb to pressure, neglecting cohesive and lift forces. The increased recycle ratio reduced the catalyst residence time and led to effective removal of heat, thus, avoiding the formation of hotspots.110 Most of these reactors worked on the power-to-gas model, which had 8% lower investment costs with relatively higher product formation. A study was focused on dynamic modelling of fixed bed reactor, in which the dynamic conditions were simulated using transient variations in inlet gas temperatures, cooling temperatures, and pressures. Any abrupt behaviour was attributed to sudden temperature changes as per the model results.111 A 2D heterogeneous multiscale, multiphysics model was also developed to understand the fixed bed reactor system in CO2 methanation. This model neglected wall effects by assuming constant wall temperatures as well as ignoring the variation in local porosity. COMSOL Multiphysics was used to solve the complex mass and energy balance equations.112 Thus, it could be ascertained that several models, which were developed, showed a vivid variety with several software, used to run these simulations to generate the desired results. In most of the cases, the simulation results were in agreement with experimental ones with very high accuracy and speed.
A comparison among several types of reactors used for methanation led to the following observations – the conversion obtained in case of annular fixed bed reactors was extremely high, compared to milli-structured fixed bed reactors or metallic foam reactors. The annular fixed bed reactor worked best at a dilution factor of 3 to give about 95% conversion when similar catalysts were used in all three reactors. Though dilution resulted in additional costs for gas separation, high reactor volumes led to high-pressure drops, and were, thus, not recommended. The milli-structured reactor had high space–time yield as well as high productivity due to lower reactor volumes. The metallic foam reactor showed poor methane conversion.112 Though reactors played a very significant role in the process of methanation, a few drawbacks were encountered. Firstly, the accuracy of the simulated models was found to be close to 80–90% of the actual result obtained on experimentation. This anomaly arose due to the usage of multiple approximations used in the formulation of the model. Assumptions such as constant wall temperature, amount of total heat transfer, simplification of reaction rates etc., led to discrepancies between the actual and simulated data. Also, most of the models worked well on a small scale, though their capability to work on a larger scale was yet to be established. While the use of a fixed bed reactor was found to be prominent, other types of reactors have not been explored as much. This could be attributed to the ease of catalyst deployment, efficient process control and simple construction in case of this reactor. Further research could be focused on increasing the efficiency of these reactor models with all its complexity at different scales.
The Table 2 below, illustrates various reactors used in CO2 methanation process with critical design parameters, scale, performance, merits and demerits along with their challenges and prospects.

4. Thermo-kinetic aspects
The process of methanation was being considered widely for use in industries for the prospect of energy generation. To do so, several kinetic pathways were developed and tested, and the best pathway for methanation was described. Along with the description of the kinetics of the process, the thermodynamic properties of the widely used Sabatier reaction (CO2 + 4H2CH4 + 2H2O (298 K, −165 kJ mol−1)) were discussed in various researches at great length. The following section describes the thermo-kinetic properties of methanation. Methane is one of the most common greenhouse gases, with coal mines contributing significantly towards its generation. Almost 60% of methane comes from coal mines.113 The conversion of CO2 into CH4, thus, came as a reliable method to store energy.
In most studies, a pseudo-steady-state hypothesis was assumed for the RDS from the mechanistic aspect. Two most common adsorption–desorption models viz., Langmuir Hinshelwood and Hugen Watson (LHHW) model were employed to understand the intrinsic kinetics of the catalytic reaction.114–117 The advantage was that it helped to obtain relatively less variance among the data sets, but at the expense of large intervals. This was the essence of Bartlett's law. The power law model simply took in the proportionality constant of concentrations into consideration. One of the main process parameters was temperature, whose optimal range was found to be 200–400 °C. By further increasing the temperature, CO2 conversion decreased due to thermodynamic equilibrium. The pressure was found to positively influence the conversion, selectivity and the rate with an optimal range of 1–7 atm. Increased GHSV space velocities were found to decrease conversions by decreasing the contact times for the reaction to occur.119 Increasing the H2/CO2 inlet ratio increased conversion and selectivity. This showed that the H2 feed content played a fundamental role, both on the adsorbed CO2 and CO dissociation mechanisms and on the removal of OH ad-species from the catalyst surface. On increasing the adsorbed water content, the selectivity remained constant while conversion decreased.115
The thermodynamics of the reaction plays a major role in the design and development of reactors and processes to generate methane from CO2. Several reaction pathways were proposed to generate methane, be it the power-to-gas method or Sabatier method, or in situ methanation by generating hydrogen. All these methods were needed to be simulated well in advance, incorporating all the conditions that might arise when the reaction proceeds. Power-to-gas method arose as one of the most sought after and discussed methods, especially in Europe.9 Relations have been developed to simplify the complexity of the equation and to develop better models.118 The Sabatier reaction considered several sources of CO2, be it syngas production, flue gases, etc.11,12 The power-to-gas method involved usage of electricity to convert H2O to H2 using proton exchange membrane technique, which was very commonly used amongst the electrolysis techniques available. The energy efficiency of the process was found to be about 57.4%.
Studies on the effect of reactor length, inlet velocity, cycle time on the yield of methane revealed that as length increased, the product yield decreased. It had an only marginal effect on the maximum temperature that could be achieved in the reactor. Increase in the methane concentration in the feed and its velocity was found to increase the reactor temperature significantly and, hence, controlled reactant velocities should be maintained. The high-temperature zone narrowed when cycle time was increased.119 The modelling of the reactor and the running of simulations were done using MATLAB software in one of the studies. Equations were solved using equilibrium solver-Cantera. Database GRI-Mech 3.0 was used to perform equilibrium calculations. To provide data to the model, a biomass gasifier was used. Such simulations could predict probable final temperature values as well as temperature profiles that could be observed in reactors. Such studies enabled to establish the conditions and develop a reactor model based on these calculations for the optimal working of the reactor.115
Thus, it could be ascertained that thermodynamic modelling of the reactor played a crucial role in pilot plant development. A properly developed model could provide accurate results and better conversions. For example, using RSM-BBD model, accurately setting the reactor parameters and performing the simulation gave results extremely close to those found by experimental analysis.119 The kinetic factors, such as temperature and pressure, affected the methanation process to the extent of favouring it, or if not controlled properly, could inhibit the reaction, and decreasing the conversion. Thus, these parameters need to be controlled properly to get higher conversion. The Table 3 below, gives an overview of various kinetic models used to understand CO2 methanation in terms of governing equation, rate-determining step, assumptions, nature of catalyst employed in the reaction as well as merits and demerits.

5. Recent advances in CO2 reduction to methane
5.1 Electro-catalytic reduction
Electrochemical reduction, a mode of CO2 conversion to renewable carbonaceous fuels like methane through clean and economical processes, has been gaining wide attention by the researchers worldwide. This not only addresses global warming by reducing CO2 emissions, but also solves growing energy needs. Zhang et al.,133 had reviewed the progress and perspectives of this topic. The electro-catalysts employed in this process were classified as metal–organic complexes, metals, metal alloys, inorganic metal compounds and carbon-based metal-free nanomaterials. It has been reported that Cu based alloys and Cu oxides, despite suffering with poor selectivity and activity degradation,134 were commonly employed as successful electrocatalysts in methane generation, as they were not only economical but also exhibit high activities and faradaic efficiencies.135–137 Bicarbonates of sodium and potassium at different concentrations were commonly used electrolytes along with these Cu based catalysts. Different morphologies of Cu nanocrystals like nanowires, nanocubes, nanopillars foils, etc. were employed for these reactions. Among these, Cu nanopillars, loaded on glassy carbon, were found to give faradaic efficiency of 80% for methane which was four times that of Cu foils.138 It has been found that oxidation of the metals like Cu proved to enhance its activity and selectivity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Besides oxidation, surface morphologies and local pH gradients also played an important role in this reaction.139 The performance of ruthenium, which was perceived to be the best catalyst for CO2 methanation, was found to be low under electrochemical conditions.140 Theoretical studies using DFT showed that graphene supported Ru–porphyrins could enhance the stability and selectivity in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to methane through the formation of CO intermediate, that was more favoured thermodynamically. The results were found to depend on applied potential and reaction conditions.141 Also, oxygen-plasma treated aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets with Cu nanoparticles electro-deposited on them gave higher efficiencies of CO2 reduction to CH4, when compared to other products like CO and C2H4. 3D morphology of Cu growth on CNT sheets was found to play a critical role in the yield and selectivity achieved. They were also flexible, stackable in multilayers, reusable, much lighter than metals and scalable for large scale energy and environmental applications.142 Baturina et al.,143 also had studied CO2 electroreduction to hydrocarbons on carbon-supported copper nanoparticles. The ratio of C2H4/CH4 faradaic efficiencies was found to be a function of particle size, with higher ratios observed for smaller particles as the under-coordinated sites like corners, edges, defects increased with decreasing size of nanoparticles. For potentials more negative than −1.6 V, CH4 generation was found to dominate over C2H4 due to hydrogen spill over. Density functional theory combined with the Poisson–Boltzmann implicit model was used for screen promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to C1 hydrocarbons. It was found that single atom alloys (SAA) i.e., gold or silver in combination with isolated single atoms M, (M = Cu, Ni, Pd, Co, Rh and Ir) were the most promising in producing C1 hydrocarbons. It followed a two-step mechanism where in the first step, CO2 was reduced to CO, which was then captured by M to further reduce to C1 hydrocarbons.144 Schlager et al.,145 developed a novel method of employing microorganisms for C2 reduction to methane. In this bio-electrocatalytic reduction, methanogenic microbes were used along with the direct injection of electrons and gaseous CO2. The results were found to depend upon the applied potential and environmental conditions with faradaic efficiencies of 22%. This bio-electrocatalytic route with microorganisms was promising as they required mild operating conditions, besides being capable of self-generation, and hence, could be used for long term applications. To increase selectivity towards methane in CO2 reduction to 100% and conversion rate to 80%, plasma-catalytic dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) process was developed where operating temperatures were reduced from 350 °C to room temperature to 150 °C. This required high voltage pulses for a few nanoseconds, adsorption of CO2 in bent configuration and polarization of catalyst. The plasma was found to help in the activation of the reactant and desorption of water, besides reducing the operating temperature.146 NCZ (Ni with supports of zirconia and ceria) catalysts were the most commonly employed materials for these studies under plasma conditions and these would affect the reaction mechanism of methanation.147,148 As mentioned before, Cu, being the most common catalyst in electrochemical reduction, it was found that the size of Cu nanoparticles in gas phase CO2 electroreduction was found to be highly critical in achieving the desired productivity, efficiency and selectivity to hydrocarbons like CH4 and C2H4, with smaller particles of the order of 25 nm, favouring the latter.149
It was found, from the reported studies on electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, that while metals such as Pb, Sn, Pd, Bi, and Pt promoted the formation of formic acid/formats, Cu based electrodes favoured production of methane, ethylene and CO.150 Martinez et al.,151 found that Pb/CNT catalysts, obtained by using supercritical fluids, were excellent in CO2 reduction, especially formic acid followed by methane and methanol. Effects of various parameters like current density, temperature, CO2 flow rate and anolyte concentrations were studied on the above-said reaction. Increase in current density in the range of 8–24 mA cm−2 was found to improve selectivity towards methane. Deployment of supercritical fluids was found to be more effective as they possessed solvent properties similar to liquids while transport properties similar to gases, besides being environmentally friendly. Moreover, their properties could be tuned by modifying the operating conditions of temperature and pressure.152,153 Some studies were conducted on an atomic level design of the electrocatalyst. Theoretical studies, using multiple oxygen-vacancies bound single atomic Cu-substituted CeO2, revealed that electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane could be achieved with a faradaic efficiency of 58% which indicated strong capabilities of rational design of electrocatalyst active centres for boosting activity and selectivity.154 This high selectivity towards methane could be attributed to atomic dispersion of electrocatalytic Cu sites and the surrounded multiple Vo's, besides the positive role played by CeO2 framework. Higher oxophilicity, measured by the binding energy Oads, was found to enhance the selectivity towards methane than methanol using Cu-substituted CeO2.155 Some studies have recently been reported on modifying Cu with polymers to enhance faradaic efficiencies towards different products like methane, ethylene, formats etc. It was reported that Cu modified with polypyrrole at 20 bar pressure and drop-casting with glycine favoured CH4, that with polyacrylamide favoured ethylene and Cu with others like polyaniline, polysulfide and poly(4-vinyl) pyridine favoured formate.156,157 A significant increase in the faradaic efficiencies of more than 80% towards methane could be achieved using an electrocatalytic system comprising of ultrathin MoTe2 layers and an ionic liquid electrolyte similar to some of the best Cu based catalysts.158 These studies opened a new window towards the design of other transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to valuable fuels with high faradaic efficiencies and stability. This could be due to unique properties exhibited by TMDs in terms of large surface area, abundant low-coordinated surface atoms and good mechanical stability.159 DFT calculations showed that higher electrical conductivity would impart MoTe2 with fast electron transfer and ion diffusion rates, resulting in catalytic improvement of CO2 reduction.160 Very recently, it was reported that graphitic carbon nitride-C3N4/doped graphene-XG had a very positive influence on the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane through the impact of interfacial electron transfer. This could be achieved at a much lower overpotential of 0.45 V, among the lowest reported using any other metallic electro catalysts.161 Hence, future research should be directed towards the search of more metal-free nanostructured materials with variable chemical compositions and adjustable electronic properties.
Of late, perovskite oxides have been employed successfully in energy applications. Highly efficient and robust cation ordered perovskite oxides have been employed as a bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable zinc–air batteries due to their inherent catalytic activity and structural flexibility, besides favourable kinetics and electrical conductivity.162 A bifunctional composite catalyst based on perovskite oxides has been successfully employed for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions by Kim et al.,163 in water splitting, under alkaline conditions. The perovskite skeleton was modified by nano-sized transition metals and hollow carbon nanofibers. This hetero architecture fabrication strategy opened new avenues for a broad range of advanced catalyst design. Perovskite oxides have great potential due to their low cost, earth-abundant constituents, high intrinsic catalytic activity, compositional flexibility and other advantages.164,165 Electrochemical water splitting has attracted wide attention of the researchers due to low energy consumption and high purity products. Kwak et al.,166 found a synergistic interaction of perovskite oxides and N-doped graphene in various reactions like oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution. These novel catalysts based on this combination could find applications in clean energy technologies like water-splitting and metal–air batteries. From the studies reported above, we understand the great potential of electrocatalysts in different clean energy applications, including CO2 reduction to methane and other hydrocarbons.
5.2 Photocatalytic reduction of CO2
Besides the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane and other hydrocarbons, photocatalytic reduction using conventional catalysts like noble or critical metals was also gaining prominence as a tool to solve energy and environmental issues. Photoconversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons has been a challenging option due to the complex multielectron transfer processes involved, need to achieve higher selectivity by understanding the mechanisms and inherent potential for back-reactions. The critical influencing factors in this process include surface architecture, charge transport properties of the photocatalyst, energy band levels along with the availability of active sites for the reaction to progress.167 As most of the solar energy is in the visible region, the photocatalyst should be responsive in this range. TiO2 nanoparticles, sensitized with platinum nanoparticles, were found to be a highly efficient and stable catalyst for the photoconversion of CO2 to methane (80.3 μmol g−1 h−1) in a flow-through photoreactor. With graphene sheet wrapped around the blue titania nanoparticles and with Pt sensitization, the yield of ethane also was found to increase along with that of methane.168,169 It was also observed by Huang et al.,169 that Al-reduced conductive black titania with crystalline core–amorphous shell structure with numerous surface oxygen vacancies, was highly efficient in reducing CO2 to methane with a space–time yield of 14.3 μmol g−1 h−1 and 74% selectivity, besides excellent photostability. It was found that Ni nanoparticles (NPs), supported by defective graphene, was very successful in the photo-assisted reduction of CO2 with H2, giving a methane yield of 642 μmol g−1 h−1 and a quantum yield of 1.98% at 200 °C. When compared to this catalytic system, Ni-NPs supported by silica-alumina or NiO-NPs gave significantly lower methane yields.170 The possible advantages of using graphene sheets with hexagonal arrangement could be high electric and thermal conductivity, larger specific surface area and strong interaction with support metal, thereby enhancing its and activity and efficiency.171,172 The photoconversion of CO2 to various products involved radical chain reactions with electrons and holes between photocatalyst and the reactants, generally controlled by reactor configuration, nature of photocatalyst and reducing agents, besides other process parameters like temperature, pH, CO2 pressure, nature of co-catalysts and dopants. Size, morphology and doping were also found to be critical in photoconversion under UV and visible light irradiation.173 The reduction reaction could follow three pathways viz., formaldehyde pathway, carbine pathway and glyoxal pathway depending on the binding mode of CO2 to the semiconductor surface.174 Besides TiO2, which was a very commonly employed photocatalyst, few other materials that were reported to produce methane predominantly as reduced product were Pd–TiO2 assisted by Nafion layer in the form of nanoplates; Ti-MCM 41 and 48 with Ti loading in mesoporous form; MMT with CdS assistance in pillar form; c-NaNbO3 with Pt loading in nanoribbon form; WO3 crystals, Zn-MMS, Zn2SnO4 assisted by Pt/RuO2 in the form of nanoplates and ZnSO4.175–178 Park et al.,179 developed a novel approach of hydridation of Pd cocatalysts into β-phase PdH0.43, which led to giant enhancement of CO2 to CH4 from a mere 3.2% to 63.6%. This hydridation played a dual role in suppressing H2 production, thereby facilitating the conversion of CO intermediate to CH4 and also promoted electron trapping on the cocatalysts, improving the charge separation. These studies gave new insights into the photocatalytic mechanisms and introduced new opportunities for a novel approach towards the design of the catalyst materials.179,180 Various nanoparticles based on TiO2 were developed for enhanced CH4 production from CO2. 1D/2D TiO2/MoS2 hybrid nanostructures and Pt@Ag–TiO2 nanocomposites were developed for enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In the former case, XPS and DFT calculations showed that besides intimate interaction between TiO2 and MoS2, hybridization led to increased optical absorption and CO2 adsorption and, thereby, superior photocatalytic activity. In the latter case of using Pt@Ag–TiO2 catalysts, it was found that deposition of Ag shell increased CO2 reduction efficiency and suppressed H2 generation. A maximum CH4 production rate of 160.3 μmol g−1 h−1 with a CO2 reduction selectivity of 87.9% were achieved.181,182 Among all the metal cocatalysts, Pt, with large work function, is the best candidates for trapping electrons and, hence, Pt decorated TiO2 nanofilms exhibit CO2 conversion efficiencies ten times that of pure TiO2, but with poor light absorption capabilities which could be accomplished by using Ag or Au along with Pt.183,184 As conversion of CO2 to CH4 by accepting electrons competed with water splitting to produce H2, bifunctional co-catalysts with proper structure were needed to be designed to have both conversion and selectivity.185 Also, Bi2S3–TiO2 double-layered dense films were found to enhance the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 (35.2 μmol g−1 L−1) due to effective charge separation. These double-layered film promoted separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thereby accelerating the CO2 reduction process and enhancing the catalytic performance.186 It was interesting to note that by using fluorination, the reduction potential of TiO2−x could be modulated for efficient and selective CH4 generation from CO2 photoreduction. Due to this, the CH4 yield was increased 13 times from 0.125 to 1.63 μmol g−1 h−1 with selectivity improvement from 25.7 to 85.8%, which could be attributed to the built-in electric field by fluorination. This was a metal-free strategy for the selective CH4 generation from CO2 photoreduction.187 Sulphur doping at various levels on TiO2 nanoparticles via sonothermal method, along with different bases like K2CO3, Na2CO3, NaOH, KOH and catalyst amounts were found to play a positive role in promoting the production of CH4 through photoreduction of CO2 in the range of UV and visible irradiation. Sulphur doping was found to increase the catalyst surface conductivity, charge transfer rate and the rate of photocatalytic reactions. CH4 production was found to be higher in visible light (846.5 μmol g−1) with TEOA as a sacrificial donor in an acetonitrile–water mixture, while it was 167.6 μmol g−1 without TEOA. Under UV-A irradiation, CH4 yield was only 6.25 μmol g−1 under basic conditions of KOH.188 Amorphous TiO2, with carbon doping, using citric acid assisted sol–gel method also proved to be an efficient catalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with high selectivity towards methane. This could be attributed to the mesoporous structure with high surface area and narrow band-gap of 2.1 eV which were crucial for solar light harvesting and absorption/activation of CO2 for energy transformation.189 Comparative studies of Cu and Pt doping on TiO2 proved that the former achieved higher selectivity towards CH4.190 A novel new nanocomposite material, comprising of reduced graphene oxide-supported rhodium nanoparticles (rGO-RhNP) has been successfully examined for photoreduction of CO2 with H2. It was observed that at optimal Rh loading of 18 wt%, the highest CH4 production rate (814.4 μmol CH4 gRh−1 h−1 at 175 °C) and quantum efficiency of 2.55% were exhibited.191 It was also reported recently, that WO3·0.33H2O, via Mo doping, has proved to enhance the selectivity of CO2 photoreduction towards methane, along with yield enhancement by 5 times i.e., 5.3 μmol g−1 h−1 due to enhanced water oxidation, proton supply, and electron insertion.192 A novel hollow-hierarchical structured Bi2WO6, with enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4, was developed, that gave CH4 yield of 2.6 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 8 times higher than that of bulk Bi2WO6. Hence, achieving a hierarchical structure played a positive role in selectivity enhancement.193 Carbon dots, belonging to the category of metal-free nanomaterials, were found to possess unique properties like optoelectronic properties such as broadband absorption, blue fluorescence emissions, low photo-bleaching, reliable chemical inertness, favourable photoinduced electron transfer properties, and available surface chemistry.193–198 Li and co workers employed them first in photocatalysis, where the efficiency further improved by graphitization and nitrogen doping.199 Liu et al.,200 used the graphitized and nitrogen-doped carbon dots successfully for improving methane electronic selectivity in photo-induced CO2 reduction to 74.8% along with an increased activity. In a recent study, it was reported that photo deposited Pt nanoparticles on carbon-doped titania (Pt/C–TiO2) were found to be successfully employed in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to form methane and other products like H2 and CO. A nominal loading of 0.88 wt% was sufficient to generate reasonably good results.201 Fe–N–Ti@xSBA nanocomposites were also deployed recently in the photoconversion of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels with a methane production rate of 38.72 μmol g−1 h−1 along with a small amount of methanol. The superior activity of composites could be attributed to better dispersion of the Fe–N–TiO2 particles, the formation of heterojunction, effective charge transfer and enhanced absorption capacity. The experimental data were fitted with a kinetic model based on Sips theory, with an affinity coefficient for CO2 of 142.47 bar.202 Single-atom silver–manganese catalysts were also employed for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to form CH4via artificial photosynthesis. The results obtained through single-atom catalysts were compared with Ag supported manganese oxides (Ag/HMO) and the activity of the former was found to be 1.53 times higher than that of the latter.203 From all these studies on photocatalytic CO2 reduction, it could be understood that increasing attention is being put on this process to solve energy and environmental issues. The efforts have been directed in developing novel and effective photocatalysts, compatible supports and dopants, synthesis protocols and the reactor configurations to achieve the maximum activity, selectivity, and stability.
5.3 Comparison of different methanation routes
Conventional catalytic methanation reaction, also popularly referred to as Sabatier reaction is a reversible exothermic reaction between two stable molecules viz., CO2 and H2 forming one molecule of methane and two of water. Lots of metal catalysts have been reported based on Ni, Cu, Co, Ru, Rh along with supports like metal oxides. The temperature and CO2/H2 ratio are critical factors that would influence methane selectivity with larger values of these parameters proven to be counterproductive. Two different mechanisms were proposed for this reaction viz., with and without the formation of CO intermediate. In the former pathway, CO is formed by reverse water gas shift reaction followed by its reaction with H2 to form methane (CO methanation). In the second pathway, CO2 is converted to methane in a single step. The first pathway is predominant than the later. Mechanism is found to be controlled by the factors like temperature, pressure, nature of catalyst and support, particle size etc. Various mechanisms in detail with different intermediates were presented in the preceding sections.
The electro-catalytic reduction of CO2 to carbonaceous fuels like methane has been receiving wide attention by researchers in the fields of electrochemistry and inorganic chemistry as this method would facilitate a sustainable low temperature redox cycle for energy conversion and storage. But this technology could not be commercialized due to the factors like high over potentials, lower faradaic efficiencies and poor selectivities which in turn are due to inappropriate adsorption energies of the reaction intermediates and competition between CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions. Hence it requires the development of novel and effective catalyst systems based on alloys and the use of optimal pH, temperature and nonaqueous electrolytes. As per the mechanism, the conversion of CO2 to methane that involves multiple electron–proton transfer can be represented by the reactionCO2 + 8(H+ + e−) ↔ CH4 + 2H2O
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon products like methane that involves abundantly available solar energy is gaining momentum. But this is challenging as most of the photocatalysts suffer from low energy conversion efficiency, uncontrollable selectivity, instability and high competition between hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction reactions in the presence of water. Hence there is a strong need to develop efficient photocatalyst systems that exhibit high activity and selectivity. Photocatalysis has three major steps viz., solar light harvesting, charge separation and transportation and surface reactions (CO2 with photogenerated electrons). The last step is under major focus as it is not that widely studied as the first two factors and it controls the reaction rate, selectivity and the reaction pathways. In terms of mechanism, it follows the above reaction that contains proton–coupled electron transfer process, which bypasses the formation of intermediate that requires very negative equilibrium potential of −1.9 V vis-à-vis that of the above said reaction of −0.24 V. Some factors responsible for the low energy conversion efficiencies of photoconversion systems highly stable and chemically inert nature of CO2, need of high overpotentials and very low solubility of CO2 in water (0.033 mol L−1). The maximization of adsorption and activation of CO2 is very critical in promoting photocatalytic reduction which could be achieved by increasing in surface area through necessary structural and morphological changes in fabrication stage, introduction of surface defects like oxygen and sulphur vacancies, using suitable co-catalysts and addition of surface basic sites. Selectivity towards the desired hydrocarbon product could be enhanced by proper control of pH of the electrolyte, external bias, surface functional groups etc. which would influence in turn influence kinetics, reaction mechanism and the pathways.
From the above analysis, it can be understood that there needs to be microlevel investigations on the reaction mechanisms, rate limiting steps, correlations between various steps in the mechanism and the conversion efficiency and selectivity. Novel catalyst systems need to be developed using cost effective and sophisticated synthesis protocols with effective control of desired attributes which would demand the need of in-line characterization tools. Among the three different technologies of forming methane from CO2, the photocatalytic reduction has a great potential to be explored as it requires solar energy which is unlimited. But it requires to overcome the inherent challenges of low efficiency, selectivity and stability. This is not impossible if a focussed efforts were made by a team of photochemists, inorganic chemists, reactor design, energy integration and scale-up experts.
6. Conclusions
Methanation of CO2 is an extensively studied reaction, owing to its importance in converting the pollution causing carbon dioxide to useful methane, a fuel. Hence this reaction is very vital as it addresses both environmental and energy needs. From this review, following observations could be made
1. Various mechanisms were proposed, comprising of different intermediates. The most commonly encountered mechanism was the one with hydrogen and formates as intermediates on alumina and Ni based catalysts.
2. Several catalysts were studied for the purpose on increasing yield and selectivity for the reaction. The studies involved using catalysts on structural supports such as Ce, silica and zeolites, that prevented the deterioration of the catalyst over prolonged usage, along with providing higher efficiencies. Of all the catalysts tested, the highest efficiency was found to be that of Co. However, it is expensive.
3. Alternately, Ni turned out to provide similar efficiencies at a much lower price and, thus, became the most researched catalyst, combined with several supports and promotors such as Pd, Pt, Rh to achieve better selectivity towards methanation.
4. The latest trends in this field are to use zeolites as catalysts and calculate their efficiencies upon doping with other materials such as Ni, Pd, Pt, etc.
5. The choice of reactors was also significant. Most studies were focused on fixed-bed reactors, as these provide stability to the catalyst as well as proper contact for methanation to occur. Relevant models were developed to study the influence of reactors on methanation, using software such as MATLAB, COMSOL, etc., which led to accurate observations, much close to those calculated experimentally.
Future challenges
• The development of better and sturdier Ni catalysts, with a better combination with zeolite is sought after, for greater efficiencies.
• Increasing efficiencies of other catalysts based on zeolites could also be a breakthrough as zeolites are sturdier materials and can work efficiently continuously for days.
• The process of modelling reactors could also be enhanced by improving the calculations concerning heat transfer profiles and relaxing the assumptions in reaction rates and those of constant wall temperatures, resulting in increased accuracy and much better estimates of the actual reactor system. Thus, there is still scope for improvement in the field of methanation and, thereby, reduction of global warming.
• Atomic level modelling studies need to be done for effective design of catalysts in various applications including electro- and photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
• More focus needs to be given to develop catalysts based on perovskites, graphenes, nanomaterials to enhance the yield, conversion and selectivity of methane besides conventional materials based on metal and alloys.
• Reactor configurations need to be developed by considering the aspects process intensification and energy integration.
• Novel, simple and cost-effective synthesis protocols with efficient control on the desired properties viz., size, shape, surface area etc. need to be developed using online characterization tools.
