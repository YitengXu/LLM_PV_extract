The HTM comprises a random copolymer (RCP), which is characterized using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, space-charge-limited current, and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering. The RCP-based perovskite solar cell exhibits the highest efficiency (17.3%) in the absence of dopants [lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and tert-butylpyridine]. The observed efficiency is attributed to a deep HOMO energy level and high hole mobility. In addition, the long-term stability of the device is dramatically improved by avoiding deliquescent or hygroscopic dopants and by introducing a hydrophobic polymer layer. RCP devices maintain their initial efficiency for over 1400 h at 75% humidity, whereas devices made of HTMs with additives fail after 900 h.

Broader context
Perovskite hybrid solar cells have recently been the subject of extensive investigation. The hole transport layer plays a particularly important role in transporting holes and preventing direct contact with moisture in the air. However, hole transport materials (HTMs) require deliquescent and hygroscopic dopants, which are detrimental to device lifetimes due to their low hole mobilities. In this study, we develop RCP, a dopant-free polymeric HTM. RCP exhibits high hole mobility (3.09 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) without any dopants, promoting efficient charge transport to the counter electrodes. Empirically, the highest efficiency achieved was 17.3% in a planar perovskite solar cell; this result was highly reproducible. The hydrophobic RCP layer coated on the perovskite layer functioned as a moisture barrier, preventing direct contact between the perovskite and moisture in the air. The long-term stability of devices was dramatically improved at various humidity levels. At a humidity of 75%, the device maintained its initial efficiency for 1400 h. Our newly developed polymeric HTM guarantees both efficiency and stability in perovskite solar cells, boosting research in this area.

Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites (ABX3, A = organic cation, B = metal cation, and X = halide) are promising materials for highly efficient solar cells.1–5 They have outstanding light-harvesting properties, a high absorption coefficient, and ambipolar characteristics including high charge mobility (approximately 101 cm2 V−1 s−1), and a long carrier diffusion length (approximately 100–1000 nm).6–9 Various types of structures have been investigated, including mesoscopic,10,11 mesosuperstructures,12 planar,13–15 and inverted planar.16–18 In general, a bilayer of the perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) is sandwiched between a working electrode, such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), and a counter electrode, such as gold (Au) or silver (Ag). Numerous studies have been carried out on the device physics of perovskite solar cells and reported high power conversion efficiencies.19–25 Perovskites with various compositions have been developed by fabrication methods such as sequential deposition,26 one-step spin coating,27 solvent engineering,28 vapor deposition,29 and vapor-assisted solution processing.13 The highest certified efficiency of over 20% was recently reported for a solar cell based on formamidinium lead iodide, which was fabricated by an intramolecular exchange process.30 Devices with compact layers such as zinc oxide (ZnO),31 tin oxide (SnO2),32,33 tungsten oxide (WOx),34 and quantum dots35 have been reported. Among them, a SnO2 compact layer exhibited a high reproducibility and an efficiency (17.21%) comparable to that of a conventional titanium oxide (TiO2) layer. In most reports, triarylamine-based materials such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) and polytriarylamine (PTAA) were incorporated into devices along with dopants.
The fabrication of a uniform and pinhole-free perovskite layer is an essential prerequisite for highly efficient solar cells.36–38 Hole transport materials (HTMs) must be further developed to achieve high power conversion efficiency and stability in perovskite solar cells. The HOMO energy level of the HTM must be higher than that of the perovskite at the interface in order to achieve effective hole transfer from perovskite to the HTL (case 1 in Fig. 1a). Hole mobility in the HTL must be reasonably high; however, most HTMs including spiro-MeOTAD and PTAA exhibit a low hole mobility (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) in their pristine forms (case 2 in Fig. 1b) even though the HOMO energy level of the HTM is well optimized. This results in slower hole transport in the HTL and decreased efficiency. Hence, most HTMs are doped with additives such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and tert-butylpyridine (tBP), resulting in increased hole mobility (case 3 in Fig. 1a).39 This strategy has been largely adopted for highly efficient solar cells based on spiro-MeOTAD, PTAA, and similar new HTMs.40–47 The dopants used with these HTMs are deliquescent and hygroscopic; they degrade the perovskite film as well as the organic HTL, diminishing the stability of the device.48 HTMs with high hole mobility must be developed to overcome this challenge. The next generation of HTMs should have not only an appropriately tuned HOMO energy level but also high hole mobility (e.g., ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) in the absence of dopants (so-called dopant-free HTMs). Despite substantial research efforts, few dopant-free HTMs have been reported: a tetrathiafulvalene derivative,49 an acene derivative,50 spiro-type small molecules,51 and donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated small molecules.52,53 The best efficiency (16.1%) was reported for the additive-free, D–A conjugated small molecules.53 Quite recently, Trux-OMeTAD (composed of a truxene-core with arylamine terminals) exhibited 18.6% efficiency in an inverted planar structure.54 Dopant-free polymeric HTMs have been studied less frequently; they exhibit efficiencies around 12% or less.55,56
 Fig. 1  (a) Four scenarios for the HTL in a perovskite solar cell: case (1) the HOMO energy level is too deep, case (2) the hole mobility is low, case (3) the hole mobility is improved with dopants, and case (4) the HTL is ideal. (b) The chemical structure of RCP is composed of P-OR and P-R. 
Device efficiency could be significantly improved using a thinner HTL, which resulted in a shorter pathway.57 For example, a PTAA layer around 100 nm thick completely covered a rough perovskite layer,30,36 whereas a layer thickness of over 200 nm is generally required for spiro-MeOTAD or small-molecule HTMs to obtain highly efficient perovskite solar cells.58,59 This suggests that an ideal HTL can be realized using a thin layer of polymeric HTM with a suitable HOMO energy level and high hole mobility (case 4 in Fig. 1a).
Previously, we reported the development of new polymers including D–A conducting polymers for optoelectronics applications. Our work rigorously studied energy transfer phenomena, energy conversion efficiency, and long-term stability in dye-sensitized solar cells and organic solar cells.60–67 The advantages of D–A type conducting polymers include their superior and tunable optical and electrical properties such as energy levels, low bandgap, high mobility and good film formability.68 We recently reported that a D–A conducting polymer that contained a diketopyrrolopyrrole moiety exhibited better stability than spiro-MeOTAD in perovskite solar cells due to the hydrophobicity of the polymer.69 We also demonstrated how the physical and electronic properties of D–A conducting polymers could be tuned for their application to perovskite solar cells.70
Herein, we report a novel D–A polymeric HTM based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5:b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) (Fig. 1b). BDT is the most commonly used moiety due to its high coplanarity, which enhances π–π stacking, thereby facilitating charge transport.71,72 On the other hand, a BT moiety, one of the strongest electron acceptors, can lower the HOMO energy level in D–A conducting polymers.71 A good candidate for a dopant-free HTM should exhibit high hole mobility and a slightly higher HOMO energy level than the perovskite (Fig. 1a). We first focused on P-OR; its reported hole mobility was high (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).73 However, P-OR had a deep HOMO energy level (−5.51 eV) compared to that of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV). To increase the HOMO energy level up to −5.43 eV, we combined P-OR with P-R, which had nearly the same structure and a higher HOMO energy level.74 The random copolymer (RCP) formed by combining these polymers was expected to have high hole mobility and a favorable HOMO energy level (Fig. 1b). A device with the configuration of FTO/SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/RCP/Au produced the highest efficiency in this study (17.3%) without any dopants; it demonstrated outstanding stability, functioning for more than 1400 h at 75% humidity. These metrics are far superior to those of spiro-MeOTAD devices (15.3%; 0% after 900 h).
Results and discussion
The general synthesis and purification procedures for P-OR, P-R, and RCP are fully described in the Experimental section. Each polymer was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). All polymers had similar molecular weights and exhibited mostly amorphous characteristics [see the ESI,† for NMR (Fig. S1), GPC (Fig. S2), DSC (Fig. S3), and AFM (Fig. S4) data]. The properties of the polymers were characterized by UV-vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry (CV), space-charge-limited current (SCLC), and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2a for films of P-OR, P-R, and RCP. (See Fig. S5 (ESI†) for the UV-vis absorption spectra of P-OR, P-R, and RCP in chlorobenzene.) The corresponding data (λmax, λedge, optical bandgap, and energy levels) are listed in Table 1. CV was used to analyze the electrochemical properties of the polymers. The oxidation potentials of each polymer is shown in Fig. 2b, and the HOMO energy levels are calculated to be −5.51, −5.40, and −5.41 eV for P-OR, P-R, and RCP, respectively. As expected, the energy level of RCP was slightly higher than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV) because the characteristics of P-OR and P-R were properly combined in RCP.

Mobility measurements of pristine P-OR, P-R, and RCP were performed using the SCLC method with the following diode structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Au for hole-only devices, and the results were fitted to an SCLC model. The charge carrier mobilities were calculated using the SCLC model (Fig. 2c);75 the mobilities of P-R and P-OR were 0.65 × 10−3 and 1.85 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, similar to the reported values for analogous polymers in which the alkyl substituents were slightly different.73 The hole mobility of RCP was 3.09 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was even greater than that of P-OR. The addition of LiTFSI (2 mM) and t-BP (0.07 mM) to the polymers increased their hole mobilities to 0.78 × 10−3 (P-R), 2.38 × 10−3 (P-OR), and 3.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (RCP) (Fig. S6, ESI†). These increases were not larger because the polymers inherently exhibited high hole mobilities, in contrast to triarylamine-based HTMs. Along with the increase in hole mobility, effective carrier density in each polymer was also increased when dopants were incorporated (Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†). To investigate the origin of the high hole mobility observed in RCP, we performed GIWAXS measurements on the polymers (Fig. 2d and e). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles (Fig. 2d) of all polymers showed a π–π stacking peak (010) along the out-of-plane direction and a lamellar peak (100) along the in-plane direction. This indicated that all the polymers have the face-on orientation on the UV-ozone-treated, polar, silicon substrate. The RCP film exhibited stronger peaks than the P-OR and P-R in both directions due to a more strongly directed face-on orientation, as shown in Fig. 2e. These results explained why the hole mobility of RCP was even greater than that of P-R and P-OR. We tuned the HOMO energy levels of the polymers to that of the perovskite (Fig. 3a). The engineered HOMO energy level and high hole mobility of RCP were designed to work as a dopant-free HTM.

We fabricated perovskite solar cells in various configurations (Table S2, ESI†); the optimum was a planar device in the configuration FTO/SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au (Fig. 3b and c, Fig. S8, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation for devices made with each HTM (Table 2). Devices with P-OR and P-R exhibited low efficiencies irrespective of the presence of dopants (ADDs: 2 mM LiTFSI and 0.07 mM tBP) as shown in Fig. 4a. These low efficiencies were ascribed to too deep HOMO energy levels or low hole mobility. In contrast, the perovskite solar cell with RCP exhibited high efficiency with and without ADDs. The device without dopants achieved 17.3% efficiency with a 1.08 V open circuit voltage (VOC), a 21.9 mA cm−2 short circuit current (JSC), and a 75.0% fill factor (FF); the performance was similar in the presence of ADDs. The measured efficiency (17.3%) is the highest value reported for a conventional planar device. In the case of spiro-MeOTAD devices, ADDs were necessary to reach an efficiency comparable to that of the RCP device (Fig. 4b). The fabricated device showed hysteresis, which has been observed in other planar perovskite solar cells (Fig. 4c and Table S3, ESI†).28,32,76 The JSC value was confirmed by measuring the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), as shown in Fig. 4d. The RCP device exhibited a statistically higher VOC and FF, but lower JSC than the spiro-MeOTAD device with ADDs (Fig. S9, ESI†).

(e) Steady state photoluminescence (PL) and (f) transient PL decays in 3 samples. 
The higher VOC was attributed to the deep HOMO energy level of RCP. The higher FF was one of the advantages when using a polymer as a HTM: small molecules spin coated onto the perovskite layer formed a flat layer that did not make contact along the rough perovskite surface, whereas polymers intimately contacted the rough perovskite surface (Fig. S10, ESI†). Consequently, polymers increased charge collection related to the FF by forming a thin layer along the perovskite layer. The difference in JSC values was attributed to a slightly higher hole mobility of spiro-MeOTAD with ADDs than that of RCP.57
To investigate the ability of RCP to extract holes, we measured steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) decay. We prepared 3 samples: glass/CH3NH3PbI3, glass/CH3NH3PbI3/RCP, and glass/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD with ADDs. The perovskite exhibited a strong PL peak near 760 nm, as shown in Fig. 4e, and PL was largely quenched when RCP or spiro-MeOTAD with ADDs was coated onto the perovskite, meaning that the holes were largely extracted into the HTM. From the transient PL decays (Fig. 4f), the lifetimes of holes were calculated: 30.3 ns for glass/CH3NH3PbI3, 4.7 ns for glass/CH3NH3PbI3/RCP, and 5.3 ns for glass/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD with ADDs. RCP reduced the lifetime of holes more significantly than spiro-MeOTAD, which meant that RCP extracted holes more efficiently. The results from steady-state and transient PL decays confirmed that RCP was a good HTM; it exhibited the highest efficiency in perovskite solar cells of all the HTMs tested.

LiTFSI and tBP have generally been used to increase the conductivity and mobility of HTMs.39 However, LiTFSI absorbs moisture in the air, which degrades the perovskite.48,77 LiTFSI saturates from H2O in the air after just 2.5 h at humidities of 60% and 35% (Fig. S11, ESI†). When a small quantity of LiTFSI was scattered on the perovskite film, the black perovskite turned into yellow lead iodide as LiTFSI absorbed the moisture in the air (Fig. S11, ESI†). tBP also affected the perovskite. The absorption spectra of the perovskite decreased as higher concentrations (0, 2, and 10 vol%) of tBP were added to the perovskite film; finally, tBP completely washed off the perovskite (Fig. S12, ESI†). These phenomena were observed by AFM and scanning electron microscopy (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†). The rms roughness value of the film decreased rapidly as the ratio of tBP increased, indicating that tBP washed off the rough perovskite surface. It is likely that tBP degraded the perovskite by forming a [PbI2·tBP] coordinated complex.78 Alternately, iodine may have reacted with the tBP to form an iodopyridinate complex.79 Though a small amount of dopants is used in perovskite solar cells, they can have a bad influence on the perovskite, degrade perovskite, and finally shorten the device lifetime. From these phenomena, high stability of a device is expected to be obtained by avoiding deliquescent and hygroscopic ADDs.
Finally, the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells without encapsulation was tested at low and high humidities: 25% and 75%. At 25% humidity, the efficiency of the RCP device was nearly constant over 1400 h, whereas the spiro-MeOTAD device with ADDs exhibited a slightly decreased efficiency (Fig. 5a and Fig. S15, ESI†). The RCP device exhibited greater stability due to its hydrophobicity (Fig. S16, ESI†). At 75% humidity, the trends of different HTMs were more distinct (Fig. 5b, c, and Fig. S17, ESI†). The efficiency of the spiro-MeOTAD device decreased rapidly after 400 h and vanished after 900 h. The weak resistance of this device to moisture was attributed to the dopants and the low hydrophobicity of spiro-MeOTAD. The RCP device exhibited much greater stability, although the efficiency decreased rapidly after 900 h when ADDs were used. The RCP device was remarkably stable and maintained its initial efficiency for 1400 h; this was attributed to its lack of deliquescent or hygroscopic ADDs and its hydrophobicity. These results demonstrated the deleterious effects of ADDs on the perovskite. Images of the perovskite solar cells with RCP, RCP with ADDs, and spiro-MeOTAD with ADDs are shown in Fig. 5d. At 75% humidity, the moisture in the air slowly penetrated into the perovskite layer and decomposed it into yellow PbI2. When ADDs were incorporated into the HTM, yellow PbI2 appeared more quickly; the perovskite was decomposed completely in the spiro-MeOTAD device with ADDs after 900 h. These results demonstrate that ADDs significantly decrease the stability of perovskite solar cells and that polymer acts as a more effective moisture barrier than a small molecule.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported a dopant-free polymeric HTM, RCP, which is used to produce highly efficient perovskite solar cells with long-term stability. RCP is based on BDT and BT; it exhibits a deep HOMO energy level (−5.41 eV) and high hole mobility (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) in the absence of dopants (LiTFSI and tBP). This results from the combination of P-OR, which has high hole mobility, with P-R, which has a reasonably deep HOMO energy level. These superior electronic properties make it possible to fabricate dopant-free devices with high efficiencies. The measured efficiency (17.3%) is the highest reported for dopant-free HTMs in conventional planar devices. In addition, the long-term stability of devices is significantly improved by introducing a hydrophobic RCP and avoiding deliquescent and hygroscopic dopants. RCP devices maintained their initial efficiency for more than 1400 h at humidities of 25% and 75%. These results suggest a broad strategy for developing efficient HTMs. This demonstration of the detrimental effects of additives on devices is expected to accelerate the study of dopant-free HTMs.

Broader context
Perovskite hybrid solar cells have recently been the subject of extensive investigation. The hole transport layer plays a particularly important role in transporting holes and preventing direct contact with moisture in the air. However, hole transport materials (HTMs) require deliquescent and hygroscopic dopants, which are detrimental to device lifetimes due to their low hole mobilities. In this study, we develop RCP, a dopant-free polymeric HTM. RCP exhibits high hole mobility (3.09 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) without any dopants, promoting efficient charge transport to the counter electrodes. Empirically, the highest efficiency achieved was 17.3% in a planar perovskite solar cell; this result was highly reproducible. The hydrophobic RCP layer coated on the perovskite layer functioned as a moisture barrier, preventing direct contact between the perovskite and moisture in the air. The long-term stability of devices was dramatically improved at various humidity levels. At a humidity of 75%, the device maintained its initial efficiency for 1400 h. Our newly developed polymeric HTM guarantees both efficiency and stability in perovskite solar cells, boosting research in this area.
