    , Accepted 18th February 2021First published on 19th February 2021AbstractIn this study, we have designed and synthesized a novel ZnO@CuO core–shell heterojunction photoanode modified with cocatalyst ZnFe-layered double hydroxides (ZnFe-LDH). As expected, the deposition of CuO enhances light harvesting and shortens the diffusion distance for charge transfer. The ZnO@CuO heterojunction also enhances charge separation and suppresses recombination. Furthermore, modification with cocatalyst ZnFe-LDH facilitates photogenerated hole transport and accelerates the surface oxidation reaction kinetics. On account of the synergistic effect of the core–shell heterojunction in ZnO@CuO with cocatalyst ZnFe-LDH, this photoanode exhibits an optimal photocurrent density of 2.08 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is about 5.3 times that of the pristine ZnO photoanode. Therefore, the construction of ZnO@CuO core–shell nanorod arrays coupled with cocatalyst ZnFe-LDH provides an effective and novel route for designing low-cost and high-efficiency photoelectrodes.
1. Introduction
In the past few decades, excessive consumption of fossil fuels has exacerbated environmental problems and the energy crisis.1–3 Thus, it is urgent to explore clean and renewable alternative energy sources.4 It is well known that hydrogen energy is considered as one of the most promising clean energy sources due to its high combustion value, no carbon emission and sustainable nature.5,6 Among the various technologies for hydrogen production, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has received growing attention as a technology with the potential to realize large-scale solar hydrogen production.7 Since the pioneering work by Honda and co-workers in 1972, various semiconductor materials have been employed as photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting, including TiO2, CaBi6O10, BiVO4, g-C3N4, WO3 and ZnO.8–14 Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) has attracted widespread attention owing to its facile synthesis, low cost and natural abundance.15 Despite these properties, the practical application of ZnO photoanodes is severely restrained in PEC water splitting because of their limited light response range, the serious recombination of electron–hole pairs and the slow kinetics at the interface.16–18
It is well established that nanostructure design is an effective approach to enhance the PEC performance of photoelectrodes.19 So far, various nanostructures of ZnO have been developed as photoanodes for PEC water splitting. In particular, one-dimensional (1D) semiconductors including nanowires, nanotubes and nanorods (NRs) possess a lower defect density, larger specific surface area, and shorter diffusion length compared to the bulk and particle materials, which could boost the charge transfer, thus exhibiting excellent PEC water splitting performance.20,21 Hence the development of vertically well-arranged ZnO nanorod arrays with a large surface area is of great importance for effectively improving the PEC performance.
Furthermore, constructing heterojunctions by sensitizing ZnO with a narrow bandgap semiconductor is an effective approach to broaden the visible light absorption range and promote charge separation. Particularly, 1D core–shell heterostructures have aroused widespread attention in PEC water splitting owing to their numerous advantages.22 Among various semiconductors with a narrow bandgap, CuO is a suitable candidate to sensitize ZnO owing to its relatively narrow bandgap (ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 eV), easy synthesis procedures, non-toxicity and matching band edge positions with ZnO.23 In our previous work, we have synthesized a CuO modifier through a simple electrochemical deposition method and found that the size of the CuO modifier can be controlled by adjusting the electrochemical deposition time.24 Hence, it is believed that the deposition of the CuO modifier on the ZnO NR array could lead to a superior water splitting performance due to the synergistic effect of the ZnO@CuO heterojunction.
It is well known that decorating a water oxidation cocatalyst (such as cobalt–phosphate (Co–Pi), FeOOH, NiOOH, etc.) on photoanodes has been proved to be an effective approach to lower the water oxidation overpotential and facilitate the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation at the cocatalyst/semiconductor interface. For instance, Liu et al. have prepared 1D SnO2/BiVO4 nanostructures decorated with a Co–Pi cocatalyst and achieved an improved photocurrent density of 2.63 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.25 Wang et al. have applied NiCoFeP as the water oxidation cocatalyst in GaN:ZnO photoanodes, demonstrating significantly accelerated carrier separation and injection at the photoanode–electrolyte interface.26 Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted increasing interest since the presence of LDHs can facilitate the carrier transport to accelerate the water oxidation process.27,28 Zhang et al. have reported that the direct preparation of metal hydroxide electrocatalysts for the OER is more desirable since others (such as pure phase metal sulfides, nitrides, and phosphides) are time consuming and technically challenging.
Based on the above-mentioned issues, we have designed and synthesized a novel ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH ternary composite photoelectrode for PEC water splitting in this study. The CuO modifier is uniformly deposited on the surface of ZnO NR arrays by a simple electrochemical deposition method. The presence of the CuO modifier not only broadens the visible light absorption range of ZnO NRs, but also forms a heterojunction with ZnO to accelerate the carrier separation. Furthermore, ZnFe-LDH as the cocatalyst further accelerates the surface water oxidation reaction kinetics. Therefore, the obtained ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH ternary photoanode exhibits significantly enhanced PEC performance in water splitting. It is expected that this design of combining the core–shell heterojunction structure with an LDH cocatalyst could provide a new prospect for the preparation of photoelectrodes with high quality in PEC water splitting.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of ZnO NRs
ZnO NRs were prepared through the dip-coating method and aqueous bath deposition.15 Before the deposition of the ZnO seed layer, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, isopropanol and absolute ethanol for 15 min, respectively. Firstly, the ZnO seed layers were deposited on FTO substrates by a dip-coating method and the precursor solution was composed of 0.3 M zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), 0.3 M ethylene glycol monomethylether (CH3OCH2CH2OH) and a certain amount of ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH). Afterwards, the FTO substrates coated with the precursor were annealed at 200 °C for 30 min and at 400 °C for 60 min to obtain ZnO seed layers. Finally, the seed layers were placed in an aqueous solution containing 0.05 M zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and 0.05 M hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) and heated in a water bath at 90 °C for 4 h. ZnO NRs were obtained by washing the samples with deionized water and then drying in air.
2.2. Deposition of a CuO thin layer
The CuO thin layer was deposited on ZnO NRs by the electrodeposition method in a three-electrode system.24 Typically, 0.48 M copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) and 3 M lactic acid (C3H6O3) were dissolved in deionized water. Then, the NaOH aqueous solution was slowly added dropwise to the mixed solution to adjust the pH until 10. The Cu2O thin layer was electrodeposited at a potential of −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl over 40 s and the solution was maintained at 35 °C. After drying at room temperature, the as-prepared Cu2O was transformed into CuO by annealing at 500 °C for 1 h. The chemical reaction equations in the CuO deposition process are as follows:24 Cu[C3H6O3]2 + e− → Cu[C3H6O3] + [C3H5O3]−(1) 2Cu[C3H6O3]2 + 2OH− → Cu2O + H2O + 2[C3H5O3]−(2) Cu2O → CuO (annealing)(3)
2.3 Deposition of a ZnFe-LDH layer
The ZnFe-LDH co-catalyst was prepared by the photoassisted electrodeposition method as shown in a previous report.29 In a typical procedure, 0.11 M zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and 0.15 M ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O) were dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water under magnetic stirring to obtain the electrolyte. The electrodeposition was carried out in a three-electrode system. Subsequently, the as-obtained samples were electrodeposited under a cathodic bias of −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 90 s. After deposition, the samples were subjected to spontaneous oxidation in air that leads to the conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+, thereby forming the ZnFe-LDH layer.
2.4 Characterization
The morphology of the obtained samples was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-4800I) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, AZtec from Oxford) was used to characterize the chemical composition of the samples. The crystalline structures of the samples were obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku-D/max-2500, Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV, 150 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI system with an Al-Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The optical properties of the samples were analyzed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance analysis using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis, DU-8B). The PEC performance was investigated in a three-electrode cell with a photoanode (as-prepared samples), a cathode (Pt plate), a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode) and an electrolyte (0.5 M NaSO4 aqueous solution). In order to investigate the cycling stability of ZnO@CuO/LDH photoanodes, we have recorded 10 photocurrent density values during the 1000 continuous cycle operation process (1 point per 100 cycles). A xenon lamp (CHFXM500, 100 mW cm−2) was used as the light source. The potentials measured by the Ag/AgCl electrode were transformed into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential through the following equation:30,31 ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.1976 V(4)
3. Results and discussion
The preparation process of the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Firstly, a uniform ZnO seed layer was coated on the FTO transparent conductive glass substrate by the sol–gel method, which could provide nucleation sites for the growth of ZnO NRs.32 Thereupon, ZnO NRs were grown directly on the seed layer via aqueous bath deposition. After that, a CuO thin layer was electrodeposited on ZnO NRs from an alkaline solution of copper sulfate stabilized by lactic acid. According to previous reports, the loading amount and average size of the CuO thin layer would increase with the electrodeposition time.24 Whereas, if the electrodeposition time is too long, the gaps between ZnO NRs would be filled with the CuO modifier, which is not conducive to the carrier transport. Moreover, excessive deposition time would cause the crystal structure of ZnO NRs to be damaged due to its intolerance to the alkaline environment.33 Finally, the ZnFe-LDH co-catalyst was deposited onto the top surface of ZnO@CuO NRs by the photoassisted electrodeposition method. After the entire electrodeposition process was completed, the as-prepared sample was placed in air to promote the self-oxidation of ZnFe2+-LDH to ZnFe3+-LDH.

The typical crystallinity and crystalline phase of pristine ZnO NRs, ZnO@CuO NRs, and ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanodes were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, as shown in Fig. 2. For bare ZnO NRs, the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.8°, 34.4°, 36.2°, 47.5°, 56.6° and 62.9° can be observed corresponding to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110) and (103) crystal planes of zincite ZnO with a hexagonal structure (JCPDS No. 79-0206), respectively.34 The diffraction pattern of the sample deposited with the CuO modifier displays new peaks at 2θ = 35.5°, 38.7° and 48.7°, attributed to the (002), (111) and (02) crystal planes of monoclinic phase CuO (JCPDS No. 80-1917), respectively.24 After modification with the ZnFe-LDH cocatalyst, the new appeared diffraction peak at 2θ = 10.6° was well consistent with the (003) plane of ZnFe-LDH, indicating the successful growth of ZnFe-LDH on ZnO@CuO NRs.29 The XRD results demonstrate that the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite electrode has been successfully synthesized.

The microstructures and surface morphologies of ZnO NRs, ZnO@CuO NRs, and ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanodes were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown in Fig. 3a, the as-prepared ZnO nanostructure exhibits a uniform rod-like morphology (average diameter of ∼90 nm) and these nanorods are evenly distributed on the surface of the FTO substrate. The high-magnification SEM image clearly displays a smooth nanorod array with diameters of 60–110 nm. The cross-sectional SEM image shows that these nanorods tend to be vertically oriented and cover the entire FTO substrate (Fig. 3d). As can be seen from Fig. 3b, the surface of ZnO NRs (average diameter of ∼120 nm) becomes rough due to the deposition of the fine CuO modifier. Furthermore, compared with the bare ZnO NRs, the diameters of ZnO@CuO NRs were increased (the statistical diameter images of ZnO and CuO @ZnO are shown in Fig. 3a and b), which indicates that a thin layer of CuO was coated on the surface of ZnO NRs. This is consistent with the observation from the cross-sectional SEM image of ZnO@CuO NRs as shown in Fig. 3e. The SEM images of ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH in Fig. 3c and f show that the top surface of ZnO@CuO NRs has been completely covered by ZnFe-LDH nanosheets. As a result, this three-dimensional sheet-shaped structure would not only provide a large number of reaction sites, but also benefit the transfer of photogenerated carriers during PEC water oxidation, which originates from the improved contact area and reduced carrier transfer distance (i.e. shorten its path).28,29

Fig. 4 shows the corresponding EDS elemental mapping images of the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode, including the elements Zn, O, Cu and Fe. As shown in Fig. 4, the elements Zn, Cu and Fe are distributed evenly in the as-prepared sample. Meanwhile, the EDS spectrum and the elemental contents are shown in Fig. S1.† It can be seen that the atomic ratio of Zn, Cu and Fe in the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode is 36.14%, 7.71% and 6.14%, respectively. All of the elements of ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH were observed in the as-prepared sample. Both the elemental mapping distribution in Fig. 4 and the EDS spectra in Fig. S1† are fully consistent with the elemental composition of ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH. Therefore, the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH photoanode is fabricated successfully. Fig. 5a displays a typical low-magnification TEM image of the as-prepared ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite structure. It can be seen that the composite structure possesses a 1D core–shell structure, in which ZnO nanorods as the core are enwrapped by a CuO thin layer to form the core–shell architecture. Fig. 5b shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode interface. The lattice fringes from different regions present interplanar spacings of 0.260, 0.253 and 0.753 nm, which can be indexed to the (002), (002) and (003) planes of ZnO, CuO and ZnFe-LDH, respectively. The SEM and TEM analyses further prove that the ZnO (core)/CuO (shell)/ZnFe-LDH composite has been successfully prepared.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to determine the surface electronic state characteristics of the Zn, Cu, Fe and O elements in the as-prepared ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode. The images in Fig. 6 show the high-resolution Zn 2p, Cu 2p, Fe 2p and O 1s XPS spectra of ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH. In Fig. 6a, the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks are observed at the binding energies of 1021.7 eV and 1044.9 eV, demonstrating the presence of Zn.35 As shown in Fig. 6b, the two robust peaks at around 934.4 eV and 954.2 eV could be indexed to the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 of CuO, respectively.36 Moreover, the presence of satellite peaks at higher binding energies further indicates the formation of the pure CuO phase.37 In Fig. 6c, the peaks located at binding energies of 710.7 eV and 724.3 eV could be assigned to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, demonstrating the presence of Fe3+ in the as-prepared ZnFe-LDH.38Fig. 6d shows the deconvolution of the O 1s spectrum; the peaks located at 529.8 eV and 531.3 eV could be assigned to the O2− and OH− species, respectively.

Before investigating the PEC performance, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to study the light absorption features of ZnO NRs, ZnO@CuO NRs, and ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 7, the absorption edge of bare ZnO NRs is about 385 nm, which indicates that only photons in the ultraviolet range can be absorbed by ZnO NRs. As we all know, the narrow absorption region relative to the overall solar spectrum severely limits the photoelectric conversion efficiency of ZnO NRs in PEC water splitting. Therefore, it is important to broaden the visible light absorption range of ZnO photoelectrodes. As expected, after depositing another narrow band-gap light absorbing CuO modifier, the ZnO NRs exhibit a significant increase in visible light absorption. The ZnO@CuO NRs show a red shift of the absorption edge by 130 nm compared with the pristine ZnO NRs. Furthermore, the absorption edge of the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode is red shifted to nearly 535 nm.

Subsequently, the photoelectrocatalytic activities of ZnO NRs, ZnO@CuO NRs and ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanodes were estimated by a series of PEC measurements. Fig. 8a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of the as-obtained samples, and it can be noted that all the samples present positive photocurrent, indicating the intrinsic n-type characteristic of the ZnO NRs. At an applied potential of 1.23 V (vs. RHE), the pristine ZnO NRs generate a low photocurrent density of 0.39 mA cm−2. After decorating with the CuO modifier, the ZnO@CuO NRs reached an improved photocurrent density of 1.31 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Evidently, the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode yields a higher photocurrent density of approximately 2.08 mA cm−2, which is 5.3 times that of the bare ZnO NRs at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The higher photocurrent density of ZnO@CuO NRs is attributed to the significant enhancement of light absorption in the visible light region and the promotion of the photogenerated carrier separation and transport. Moreover, the onset potential of ZnO@CuO and ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH photoanodes shows excellent negative shifts of about 36 mV and 85 mV, which were mainly due to the accelerated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics at the interface between the semiconductor and electrolyte.
 Fig. 8  Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (a), the calculated applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) curves (b), photocurrent density–time (J–t) curves measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE under chopped light illumination (c) and stability curves measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE under simulated sunlight illumination for 2 h (d) of ZnO NRs, ZnO@CuO NRs and the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite. 
It is well known that applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) is an indirect measurement and IPCE is a direct measurement of the solar to hydrogen efficiency. Firstly, the ABPE was used to quantitatively evaluate the PEC performance of the as-obtained photoanodes and is calculated by the following formula:39,40 ABPE = J × (1.23 − ERHE)/Plight × 100%(5)where J, ERHE and Plight represent the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2), the applied external bias versus RHE (V) and the incident illumination power density (100 mW cm−2), respectively. As shown in Fig. 8b, the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode achieves the champion conversion efficiency of 0.47% at 0.84 V vs. RHE, which is obviously higher than that of bare ZnO NRs (0.06%) and ZnO@CuO NRs (0.22%), indicating that the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH photoanode has the best carrier separation and transport efficiency. Additionally, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) is of great importance to assess the conversion efficiency of photoanodes, as shown in Fig. S2.† The values of IPCE are obtained using the following equation:41 IPCE = φJλ/(λPλ)(6)where φ is equal to 1240, λ represents the monochromatic light wavelength (nm), Jλ represents the photocurrent density at the corresponding wavelength and Pλ represents the respective power density of monochromatic light (mW cm−2). It can be observed that the pure ZnO photoanode merely exhibits light response in the wavelength range below 390 nm. Nevertheless, the modification of CuO and ZnFe-LDH broadens the absorption spectrum of ZnO NRs to the visible light region due to their sensitization effect, which contributes to the generation and injection of photoinduced carriers. This is consistent with the observation from the UV–vis absorption spectra. The maximum IPCE of ZnO@CuO NRs and ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH photoanodes are about 36% and 56%, respectively, while the corresponding value over the bare ZnO NRs is only 15%. This enhancement means that the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers are more effective in ZnO@CuO NRs and ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH photoanodes than that in pristine ZnO NRs.
Photocurrent density–time (J–t) curves were recorded to investigate the photocurrent response of the as-prepared photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 8c, the J–t curves were measured at a constant bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE under intermittent illumination. When the light is turned on and off, the photocurrent density of all photoanodes rises and falls rapidly, which indicates that all photoanodes exhibit a rapid response to illumination. Under illumination, the photocurrent densities of ZnO@CuO NRs and ZnO@CuO/LDH photoanodes are significantly improved compared to that of bare ZnO, which is consistent with the LSV results. Normally, the photoanodes will generate positive photocurrent transient spikes when the light is turned on, which indicates the accumulation of holes at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.42 Notably, ZnO@CuO NRs and ZnO@CuO/LDH photoanodes present more rectangular photocurrent responses, demonstrating a significant suppression of the carrier recombination.43 To investigate the stability of the as-prepared photoanodes, the photocurrent density of the samples was measured at potentiostatic 1.23 V vs. RHE under continuous illumination for 2 h. In Fig. 8d, the photocurrent density of ZnO NRs decays rapidly in the initial 1200 s, and the photocurrent density drops to 0.16 mA cm−2 (about 41% of the initial photocurrent density) after testing for 2 h. In the same duration, the ZnO@CuO NRs and ZnO@CuO/LDH photoanodes retain 90% and 95% of their initial photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively, providing solid evidence of the improvement in photostability with the modification of CuO and ZnFe-LDH. Furthermore, the cycling stability curve of ZnO@CuO/LDH photoanodes is shown in Fig. S3.† It can be seen that ZnO@CuO/LDH photoanodes exhibit excellent cycling stability; specifically, this photoanode maintained 97% of the initial current density value after 1000 cycles. These advantages mainly originate from the electrostatic field at the heterojunction of ZnO@CuO NRs and restrain the recombination of electron–hole pairs and the presence of ZnFe-LDH accelerates the extraction of photoinduced carriers.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to evaluate the charge transfer resistance kinetics of photoanodes. It is well known that the semicircle radius (correspond to the large semicircle in Fig. 9) in the low frequency region reflects the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the photoanode and electrolyte, and the semicircle radius (corresponding to the small semicircle in Fig. 9) in the high frequency region reflects the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the counter electrode and electrolyte.44–47 In other words, the smaller semicircle radius in the Nyquist plots indicates the lower charge transfer resistance. As presented in Fig. 9, the semicircle radii of all photoanodes are listed in the following order: ZnO > ZnO@CuO > ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH. The semicircle radius of ZnO@CuO NRs is much smaller than that of bare ZnO NRs, which indicates effective charge separation of the ZnO@CuO NRs. This is mainly because the favorable band alignment at the interfaces between ZnO and CuO is conducive to the extraction of photoinduced carriers. The ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode exhibits the smallest semicircle radius, which corresponds to the lowest charge transfer impedance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This means that the modification with both CuO and ZnFe-LDH will lead to a better co-catalytic effect than the pristine one, further proving the synergistic promotion effect of CuO and ZnFe-LDH in PEC water splitting.

To sum up, the carrier separation and transport performance was enhanced significantly in the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode than that of the pristine ZnO photoanode. The improvement of photon utilization efficiency and carrier separation/transport was demonstrated in all of the LSV, ABPE and EIS curves in this study. Herein, on the basis of the above experimental results and their analysis, we have drawn the schematic diagram of internal photoinduced electron–hole pair separation and transport process as in Fig. 10. It was obvious that the p–n heterojunction was constructed when the p-type CuO shell was coated on the n-type ZnO core. Meanwhile, both the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) levels of CuO are higher than those of ZnO.48,49 Therefore, the gradient energy band alignment between ZnO and CuO is favorable for fast carrier separation and transport in the ZnO@CuO based photoanode. Furthermore, the cocatalyst ZnFe-LDH serves as a hole transport layer, which effectively drives the photogenerated holes to the surface for participating in the water oxidation reaction. As a result, the introduction of the ZnO@CuO heterojunction and ZnFe-LDH cocatalyst effectively accelerates the separation/transport of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and promotes the water oxidation kinetics.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we fabricated the ZnO@CuO NR array core–shell photoanode by depositing a CuO thin layer on ZnO NR arrays. The introduction of CuO can not only broaden the light absorption range of the ZnO photoanode, but also form a core–shell heterojunction with ZnO NR arrays, which could significantly improve the light harvesting efficiency, shorten the diffusion distance for the charge transfer and inhibit the recombination of electron–hole pairs, thus resulting in markedly enhanced PEC performance. Subsequently, the OER cocatalyst ZnFe-LDH was deposited on the ZnO@CuO heterojunction surface to further promote the hole transfer and accelerate the water oxidation reaction kinetics. As a result of the synergistic effect of the core–shell heterojunction in ZnO@CuO NRs and cocatalyst ZnFe-LDH, the ZnO@CuO/ZnFe-LDH composite photoanode yields an optimal photocurrent density of 2.08 mA cm−2 and a photostability of 95% over 2 h at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of pristine ZnO NRs.
