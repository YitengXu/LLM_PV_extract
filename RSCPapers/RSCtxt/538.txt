    First published on 14th April 2022AbstractThermo-photo catalysis, which is the catalysis with the participation of both thermal and photo energies, not only reduces the large energy consumption of thermal catalysis but also addresses the low efficiency of photocatalysis. As a whole greater than the sum of its parts, thermo-photo catalysis has been proven as an effective and promising technology to drive chemical reactions. In this review, we first clarify the definition (beyond photo-thermal catalysis and plasmonic catalysis), classification, and principles of thermo-photo catalysis and then reveal its superiority over individual thermal catalysis and photocatalysis. After elucidating the design principles and strategies toward highly efficient thermo-photo catalytic systems, an ample discussion on the synergetic effects of thermal and photo energies is provided from two perspectives, namely, the promotion of photocatalysis by thermal energy and the promotion of thermal catalysis by photo energy. Subsequently, state-of-the-art techniques applied to explore thermo-photo catalytic mechanisms are reviewed, followed by a summary on the broad applications of thermo-photo catalysis and its energy management toward industrialization. In the end, current challenges and potential research directions related to thermo-photo catalysis are outlined.

1. Introduction
Although catalysis widely exists in nature in the form of digestion, fermentation, and some other enzymatic processes, artificial catalysis did not emerge until the early 1800s.1 Faraday was the first to explore the heterogenous catalytic reaction and indicate the zone of adsorbed material as the catalytic reaction region (Fig. 1).1 Afterwards, a number of efforts were made in both theoretical construction and experimental exploration of heterogenous (thermal) catalysis.2,3 Until 1911, Eibner found the illumination of ZnO led to the bleaching of Prussian blue pigment, which marks the birth of a new type of heterogeneous catalysis driven by photo energy – photocatalysis.4,5 Later, in 1972, Fujishima and Honda discovered that ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation of a cell consisting of a TiO2 photoanode and a Pt counter electrode could achieve H2 production from water.6 Thanks to these pioneering works, both thermal catalysis and photocatalysis have attracted broad research interests to drive reactions for producing chemicals and fuels.7–10 However, typically, thermal catalysis suffers from large energy consumption and low catalytic selectivity, while photocatalysis demonstrates poor catalytic efficiency and limited solar energy conversion.9,11,12 This dilemma inspired the exploration of synergetic catalytic processes with the participation of both thermal and photo energies.

Since 1990s, some researchers utilized photo-to-thermal conversion to increase reaction temperature and thus the catalytic efficiency.13–15 These catalytic processes in which the only role of light irradiation is to provide thermal energy are named photo-thermal catalysis, which inherently belongs to thermal catalysis despite the apparent dependence on photo energy.16,17 Later, in 2011, Linic and co-workers explored the catalytic reactions over plasmonic nanostructures of Ag under illumination at high temperatures as a new catalysis category entitled plasmonic catalysis.18 Plasmonic catalysis is based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and driven by hot charge carriers and/or thermal energy, while quantifying their respective contributions remains as a challenge.19,20
Distinctively, in 2015, Hu's group revealed the intrinsic contradiction of visible-light photocatalysis on the band gap of catalysts, namely, the visible light absorption requires a smaller band gap, whereas a larger band gap is necessary to obtain a sufficient potential energy as a driving force for photocatalytic reaction.21 To solve this critical issue, Hu pioneered the strategy of utilizing kinetic energy to compensate insufficient potential energy for driving a reaction in visible-light photocatalysis. Consequently, his group experimentally demonstrated that the introduction of thermal energy (i.e., kinetic energy) into photocatalytic system realized highly efficient visible-light driven thermo-photo catalytic H2 production from water.21 Since then, a rapid and exciting development in thermo-photo catalysis has been witnessed with an emphasis on catalyst design and catalytic performance enhancement. So far, thermo-photo catalysis, as a whole greater than the sum of its parts (individual thermal catalysis and photocatalysis), has been applied in a wide range of chemical processes such as CO2 reduction,22–26 CH4 oxidation,27–33 CO conversion,34–38 H2 production,21,39–42 N2 fixation,43–46 pollutant degradation,47–51 and organic synthesis,52–56 showing high activity, tuneable selectivity, and excellent stability under mild conditions at low cost, owing to the synergetic effects of thermal and photo energies (Fig. 2).

Currently, most research works and published reviews are focused on the resulting catalytic performance while the underlying synergetic mechanism remains confusing.11,57–59 Therefore, it is of vital importance to provide an insightful review revealing the synergetic effects of thermal and photo energies, which would act as a valuable guideline for designing highly efficient catalytic processes. Here, different from previous reviews which are focused on a subgroup of thermo-photo catalysis like photo-thermal catalysis15,57,60 and plasmonic catalysis19,20,61,62 or limited to specific chemical reactions,11,58,63,64 we will (1) clearly define and classify thermo-photo catalysis, (2) reveal the superiority of thermo-photo catalysis over individual thermal catalysis and photocatalysis, (3) elucidate design principles and strategies for building a highly efficient thermo-photo catalytic system, (4) provide an up-to-date understanding on the synergetic roles of thermal and photo energies from the perspective of “How does thermal energy promote photocatalysis?” and “How does light irradiation accelerate thermal catalysis?”, (5) comprehensively discuss current techniques used to explore thermo-photo catalytic mechanisms, (6) highlight the broad applications of thermo-photo catalysis, (7) propose energy-related considerations and strategies for scaling up thermo-photo catalytic processes, and finally (8) outline current challenges and potential future research directions associated with thermo-photo catalysis.
2. What is thermo-photo catalysis?
Despite the booming development and wide application of thermo-photo catalysis, some key questions remain to be answered, such as “What is thermo-photo catalysis?” and “What are the advantages of thermo-photo catalysis?”. In this section, the confusing term of thermo-photo catalysis will be defined together with a clear classification based on the catalytic principles. Furthermore, the superiority of thermo-photo catalysis over individual thermal catalysis and photocatalysis will be revealed.
2.1. Definition of thermo-photo catalysis
Here, we provide a broad and clear definition for thermo-photo catalysis. Namely, it is the catalysis with the participation of both thermal and photo energies in which thermal energy promotes photocatalysis and/or photo energy accelerates thermal catalysis. Thermal energy that elevates the temperature of catalyst surface above room temperature (∼25 °C) can be either supplied by external heat sources or induced by light irradiation, while photo energy is generally provided by lamps on laboratory scale but expected for the direct utilization of sunlight. Moreover, it should be clarified that thermo-photo catalysis is distinct from the generally claimed photo-thermal catalysis that relies on light-induced temperature rise to realize desirable thermal catalytic performance.15,60 In other words, photo-thermal catalysis is just a small part of the thermo-photo catalysis that covers all aspects associated with the synergies of thermal and photo energies in catalysis.
2.2. Classification of thermo-photo catalysis
After elucidating the concept of thermo-photo catalysis, it is even more important to classify thermo-photo catalysis accurately and reasonably. Herein, based on catalytic principles, thermo-photo catalysis is classified into three categories, namely, thermo-assisted photocatalysis, photo-promoted thermal catalysis, and thermo-photo co-catalysis, which will be discussed in detail in the following parts.

2.2.1. Thermo-assisted photocatalysis. 
Thermo-assisted photocatalysis represents the catalytic process mainly driven by photo-generated charge carriers over the (photo)catalyst with thermal energy playing certain stimulative roles. In this case, the supply of thermal energy alone to reach the same reaction temperature results in a negligible catalytic efficiency. The basic steps of thermo-assisted photocatalysis are identical to those of traditional photocatalysis (Fig. 3a). Namely, when photons whose energies are equal to or larger than the band gap of the catalyst are absorbed, electrons located at the top of valence band are excited to conduction band, with holes left in valence band (step I). As-generated electrons and holes are expected to migrate to catalyst surface (step II) to drive the reduction and oxidation semi-reactions of adsorbed reactants, respectively (step III), while the recombination of some electrons and holes is generally unavoidable.9,65 The effective separation and migration of charge carriers are the key for a highly efficient thermo-assisted photocatalytic process.
 Fig. 3  Catalytic principle and pathway of thermo-photo catalysis. (a) Thermo-assisted photocatalysis. (b) Photo-promoted thermal catalysis. (c) Photo-thermal effect induced by recombination of charge carriers over semiconductor catalysts. (d) Photo-thermal effect and hot carrier generation induced by the decay of plasmons over plasmonic metal catalysts. 
The thermodynamic requirements for thermo-assisted photocatalysis are the same as those for traditional photocatalysis. Namely, the redox potential of reduction semi-reaction is below conduction band minimum, while the redox potential of oxidation semi-reaction is above valence band maximum.66 Since there is no requirement on the relative positions of redox potentials of semi-reactions, both thermodynamically downhill (ΔG < 0) and uphill (ΔG > 0) reactions can proceed, showing its superiority over thermal catalytic processes.
The roles of thermal energy in thermo-assisted photocatalysis can be clearly outlined according to the above-discussed basic steps and thermodynamic requirements. On the one hand, from the perspective of basic steps, the introduction of thermal energy can facilitate the migration of charge carriers, accelerate mass transfer, enhance kinetic driving force, and promote the dissociation of reactant molecules.21 On the other hand, in terms of thermodynamics, adjusting reaction temperature can help to tune the redox potentials of semi-reactions and broaden the application range for narrow-band-gap semiconductors.33,67 In addition, thermal input can contribute to the structural control of catalysts. These aspects will be thoroughly discussed in Section 4.


2.2.2. Photo-promoted thermal catalysis. 
As the counterpart of thermo-assisted photocatalysis, photo-promoted thermal catalysis is predominantly driven by thermal energy or hot carriers with photons acting as a promoter (Fig. 4). In this case, the catalyst with light absorption characteristics shows an evident thermal catalytic efficiency for thermodynamically downhill (ΔG < 0) reactions. Similar to traditional thermal catalysis, photo-promoted thermal catalysis generally undergoes five steps (Fig. 3b), namely, adsorption of reactants (step I), activation of chemical bonds (step II), generation of intermediate species (step III), transformation of intermediates to final products (step IV), and desorption of product molecules (step V), among which the generation of intermediate species is typically the rate-limiting step which is directly related to the surface properties of catalysts.11 As one of the promotion effects of photo energy, light irradiation can dynamically adjust the catalyst structure to retain adequate active sites.24,52
 Fig. 4  Energy diagram for (a) thermal catalysis and (b) thermo-photo catalysis over plasmonic metal catalysts. Here, an endothermic dissociation reaction is shown as an example, while the enthalpy change can be negative as well. 
The widely investigated photo-thermal catalysis and plasmonic catalysis are two subgroups of photo-promoted thermal catalysis. Photo-thermal catalysis depends on the light-induced temperature rise owing to the direct vibration absorption of far infrared (IR) light and indirect non-radiative relaxation.68,69 Non-radiative relaxation occurs via either Auger recombination or Shockley–Read–Hall recombination, leading to the dissipation of excessive energy in the form of lattice vibrations (namely, phonons), rendering it the main contributor to heat generation in semiconductor catalysts (Fig. 3c).60 In this light, to allow favourable excitation and recombination of charge carriers, dark catalysts with narrow band gaps are desired.
While, for plasmonic metal catalysts with LSPR effect (induced by the consistent frequencies of photons with the natural oscillation of surface electrons), hot charge carriers are resulted under illumination along with local heat (Fig. 3d).19 These hot charge carriers are generated via non-radiative decay through intra-band s-to-s transitions or inter-band d-to-s transitions under the intense electric field on metal surface.19,61,70 As-generated hot electrons can promote both bond activation (step II) and intermediate transformation (step IV) via transient electronic excitations with an evident decrease in activation energy and thus the lower requirement on reaction temperature (Fig. 4b).19,71 The promotion effects of photo energy on thermal catalysis will be further elucidated in Section 5.


2.2.3. Thermo-photo co-catalysis. 
Thermo-photo co-catalysis is a unique synergetic process in which heat and light can respectively drive the thermal catalytic and photocatalytic reactions. In this case, both thermal catalysis and photocatalysis demonstrate decent catalytic efficiencies, while the co-catalytic efficiency is higher than the sum of individual thermal and photo catalytic efficiencies. Here, both the above catalytic pathways illustrated in Fig. 3a and b are present. Moreover, the synergetic effects between thermal and photo energies are similar to those in thermo-assisted photocatalysis and photo-promoted thermal catalysis.

2.3. Superiority of thermo-photo catalysis over individual thermal catalysis and photocatalysis
Thermo-photo catalysis, as a whole greater than the sum of its parts (thermal catalysis and photocatalysis), has shown a number of advantages in terms of apparent catalytic performance such as improved activity, selectivity, and stability, as well as mild reaction condition and thus a low cost. In this subsection, the superiority of thermo-photo catalysis over individual thermal catalysis and photocatalysis will be revealed respectively.

2.3.1. Compared with thermal catalysis. 
The most critical issue of thermal catalysis is the harsh reaction condition such as high temperature and high pressure which can cause noticeable energy consumption and some safety issues. Moreover, the generation of some byproducts such as coke that results in the loss of catalytic selectivity and the deterioration of catalyst lifetime is generally unavoidable in thermal catalytic processes.32,72 Furthermore, it is hard to retain active sites at high temperatures especially for the oxidation reactions (generally with O2) over metal catalysts and reduction reactions (generally with H2) over metal oxide catalysts.52 The inclusion of photo energy which leads to a novel thermo-photo catalytic process can well address these issues.
Firstly, compared with thermal catalysis, thermo-photo catalysis demonstrates higher catalytic efficiencies at lower temperatures. For example, while dry reforming of CH4 typically requires a high temperature of 800–900 °C, visible light irradiation over Pt/black TiO2 catalyst realized highly efficient production of H2 (71 mmol h−1 g−1) at a low temperature down to 550 °C, in great contrast to those in dark (0 and 50 mmol h−1 g−1 at 550 °C and 700 °C, respectively).33 Similar improvements have been demonstrated in a wide range of thermal catalytic reactions such as steam reforming of CH4, partial oxidation of CH4, CO2 hydrogenation, water splitting, etc. as summarized in Table 1. Furthermore, the power required to shine the light is lower than that required to heat the reactor, so the overall energy consumption can be reduced by introducing photo energy and lowering thermal input for thermal catalytic systems.34,73,74

Secondly, the introduction of photo energy can tune the catalytic selectivity toward some products which cannot be attained in traditional thermal catalysis.36,56,75,76 Most representatively, while thermal catalytic alkyne hydroamination at 30–100 °C over Au–Co/ZrO2 catalyst led to very low selectivities toward imine (below 10%), thermo-photo catalysis in the same temperature range showed high selectivities surpassing 90% owing to photo-induced intramolecular electronic transitions.56 Similar phenomena have also been observed in preferential CO oxidation in H2 streams,36,77 CO2 hydrogenation,76 propylene epoxidation,52etc.
Thirdly, catalytic stability is enhanced under light irradiation as the generation of some undesirable byproducts such as coke is avoided,30,32,78–80 and the surface structure of catalyst is dynamically adjusted.52,81 For instance, while thermal catalytic dry reforming of CH4 over MgO/Pt/Zn–CeO2 catalyst showed a ∼80% decay in 20 hours, thermo-photo catalysis demonstrated an excellent stability at higher conversions.81
Fourthly, thermo-photo catalysis can be freed from tedious pre-treatment processes for catalysts, thus being much more convenient and cost-effective. Since metals perform as active sites in many catalytic processes, a reduction pre-treatment with H2 at high temperatures is generally required.82–85 While, in situ photo-induced reduction of catalysts with a fast start-up in a few seconds has been demonstrated in thermo-photo catalytic steam reforming of CH3OH over Cu–Zn–Ti oxide catalyst, which successfully eliminated the pre-reduction procedure.82
Fifthly, thermo-photo catalysis enables the instantaneous control of reactions. Typically, the highest catalytic efficiency can be obtained within a few minutes upon turning on the light and the efficiency can drop to zero right after turning off the light.36,73,86 While, for traditional thermal reactors, the instantaneous temperature control is almost impossible especially for the cooling process which leads to a long tail of catalytic efficiency due to the residual heat.


2.3.2. Compared with photocatalysis. 
Photocatalysis is a promising technology relying on the inexhaustible solar energy. However, it generally suffers from poor catalytic activity and limited utilization of visible light, resulting in low energy conversion efficiencies which are much below the industrial requirement.87,88 Moreover, the catalyst might get deactivated due to the generation of some undesirable byproducts.89 The introduction of thermal energy into photocatalytic systems is an effective strategy to enhance catalytic efficiency, promote the utilization of visible light, tune product selectivity, and extend catalyst lifetime.
Firstly, thermo-photo catalysis can lead to a significantly enhanced catalytic activity compared with room-temperature photocatalysis (Table 1) due to the improved reaction kinetics.21,28,39,40,90 Impressively, both the H2 evolution rate and apparent quantum efficiency were found to be enhanced by three orders of magnitude in thermo-photo catalytic water splitting over Rh/black TiO2 catalyst.40 Moreover, very recently, an unprecedentedly high CH3CH2OOH yield of 5.6 mmol h−1 g−1 was achieved in visible-light driven thermo-photo catalytic partial oxidation of C2H6 over Au/WO3 catalyst, which is 6 times higher than that at room temperature.90
Secondly, the introduction of thermal energy enables the effective utilization of visible light in photocatalytic processes.21,22,28,39,40,90 In 2015, Hu and co-workers first revealed the intrinsic issue in visible-light photocatalysis and demonstrated their design of thermo-photo catalysis for enhancing the contribution of visible light to H2 production from 0 to ∼85% of the entire solar spectrum.21 Besides, the absolute H2 yield under visible light was enhanced from 0 to 497 mmol h−1 g−1. The underlying mechanism will be further discussed in Section 4.1.
Thirdly, thermo-photo catalysis allows the regulation on product selectivity by tuning temperature.91,92 In thermo-photo catalytic water-free alcohol reforming, a low temperature was found favourable for oxidative coupling to form ester while a high temperature induced a high selectivity toward aldehyde since its fast desorption inhibited the further conversion.91
Fourthly, the catalytic durability of thermo-photo catalysis is much better than that of traditional photocatalysis due to the suppressed formation or promoted conversion of poisonous byproducts. This is especially important for catalytic oxidation of aromatic compounds such as benzene and toluene, in which the severe deposition of refractory carbonaceous intermediates on catalysts occurring during photocatalysis is inhibited in the thermo-photo catalytic process.89,93,94
Fifthly, the desorption of products from the catalyst surface is generally difficult in photocatalytic processes, which can be addressed by introducing thermal energy. This inhibits the over-reaction of reactants such as the over-oxidation of CH4 into CO2 due to the timely desorption of the desired mildly oxidized oxygenates.28,95 More importantly, this realizes the efficient refresh of active sites for subsequent adsorption of reactants.

3. How to design a highly efficient thermo-photo catalytic system?
Thermo-photo catalysis has demonstrated its advantages in a wide range of reactions, whereas there are a few guidelines on the design of thermo-photo catalytic systems. The present section will elucidate the design principles and strategies for building a highly efficient thermo-photo catalytic system with an emphasis on energy utilization and mass transfer. The design of a catalyst is guided by its function and its rational placement can further enhance the catalytic efficiency. The reactor design is mainly based on the heat source, namely, either photo-converted heat or external heat. An elaborate design on the catalyst, catalyst placement, and catalytic reactor together leads to an excellent catalytic performance.
3.1. Catalyst design
Catalyst is the core of a thermo-photo catalytic system. In the following part, we will first reveal the general and specific principles for designing efficient thermo-photo catalysts, and then discuss the strategies to acquire the desirable properties of the designed semiconductor-based and metal-based catalysts. Furthermore, the up-to-date design of synergetic catalysts will be outlined, which is expected to open a new door to catalyst design and fabrication.

3.1.1. Design principles. 
There are some general principles applicable to all categories of thermo-photo catalysis, while some catalytic processes may follow some specific principles. Generally, strong light absorption across the full solar light spectrum, sufficient accessible active sites, low cost, and high natural abundance are desired for an ideal catalyst for thermo-photo catalysis.
Firstly, strong light absorption across the entire solar irradiation spectrum is expected for efficient generation of charge carriers and/or local heat over the catalyst. In the solar irradiation spectrum, UV light accounts for only 3%, while visible and IR lights constitute 44% and 53%, respectively.137,138 However, most of the semiconductor-based catalysts exploited so far (such as TiO2 and ZnO) only absorb UV light, which greatly limits their practical application.139 Besides, the main light absorption of plasmonic catalysts is limited to certain wavelengths.70 Therefore, broadening light absorption especially in the visible and IR regions deserves a high priority for catalyst design.
Secondly, the designed catalyst should possess sufficient catalytically active sites which are accessible for reactants. Generally, the catalytic efficiency is determined by the number of active sites and the activity of each site.40 While the activity of each site depends on the structure and intrinsic properties of the catalytic material, the number of active sites can be tuned by adjusting the surface area of catalysts and the dispersion of active sites.15,40 Moreover, the active sites should properly interact with reactant molecules for the sequential adsorption, activation, and reaction.73,100 It is worth mentioning that ultra-strong interaction and excessive occupation are not desired and may even deteriorate the catalytic activity.55,77 Furthermore, the products should be quickly desorbed from the catalyst surface to avoid their further conversion and refresh the active sites.
Thirdly, from the perspective of large-scale application, catalysts should have low cost and high natural abundance. Currently, however, most of excellent catalytic performances are attained with noble metals such as Pt, Au, Ag, Pd, Rh, and Ru.21,22,40 These noble metals act as light absorber, electron trapper, or reactant adsorber, whereas their high cost and scarcity present huge obstacles to industrial application. Hence, it is crucial to exploit inexpensive noble-metal-free catalysts with Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Al, etc. playing the similar roles.16,39,140
Besides above-discussed general principles for catalyst design, there are three important design principles applicable for specific catalysis types. For semiconductor-based photocatalysis, the thermodynamic requirements on the relative positions of catalyst energy bands to the redox potentials of desirable semi-reactions must be met (Fig. 3a).66 Moreover, one can control catalytic selectivity by inhibiting the generation of undesirable products based on the thermodynamic design.28,90
For charge-carrier-mediated catalysis involving either photo carriers or hot carriers, the efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers should be ensured.63,141 This principle is opposite to that of thermal-energy-driven (photo-thermal) catalysis. In this case, only when charge carriers are effectively separated and transferred to catalyst surface to contact reactant molecules can the reaction take place.98 Moreover, for multi-component catalysts, energetically favourable band alignment and fast interfacial electron transfer are required.125,141
For photo-thermal catalysis, efficient photo-to-thermal conversion and subsequent heat transfer are desired. After charge excitation by photons, the photon energy should be effectively converted into thermal energy via the recombination of charge carriers instead of being reflected or re-emitted radiatively.60 Moreover, the catalyst should possess an appropriate thermal conductivity to ensure the efficient heat transfer from the catalyst to adsorbed reactant molecules, but limit the heat loss to surrounding environment.25,142


3.1.2. Semiconductor-based catalysts. 
Semiconductor-based catalysts are widely used for thermo-assisted photocatalysis and thermo-photo co-catalysis through photo-induced charge excitation across the band gap. Based on the design principles revealed above, defect engineering is considered as an effective strategy for fabricating a highly efficient semiconductor-based catalyst, which not only enhances light harvesting for the generation of charge carriers and/or efficient photo-to-thermal conversion,109,143–145 but also promotes the adsorption of reactants.94,144,146 However, charge recombination at deep-level defects would hamper the catalytic activity, which can be addressed by creating some shallow-level defects and thermally activating the trapped electrons to migrate out of deep-level defects via shallow-level defects.147 Furthermore, non-metal doping may play a synergetic role with defect engineering by extending light absorption and lowering the energy for defect formation.148
Moreover, semiconductors are usually loaded with some metal nanoparticles, to enhance light absorption, extend charge lifetime, and provide more active sites.22,39 While, when plasmonic metals are loaded onto the semiconductor, the electron transfer direction can be controlled by light irradiation.149,150 When photon energy is large enough to drive charge excitation in the semiconductor, electrons would be injected from the conduction band of the semiconductor to the loaded metal. In this case, the metal serves as a cocatalyst to promote the transfer and separation of charge carriers. While, if photon energy is below the band gap of semiconductor but is capable of exciting electrons in the metal to overcome the Schottky barrier, a plasmon-mediated electron transfer from the metal to the semiconductor occurs.


3.1.3. Metal-based catalysts. 
Metal-based catalysts are generally applied for plasmonic catalysis. The size and morphology of metal nanostructures can affect the electromagnetic field enhancement, hot carrier generation, and catalyst surface temperature under light irradiation, thus influencing the thermo-photo catalytic performance.151,152 Compared with spherical nanoparticles, nanoparticles with sharp features (such as nanocubes and nanocones) typically show a stronger light absorption due to the lightning rod effect153 and reduced radiative damping,154 which further contributes to stronger local electromagnetic field enhancement and more favourable generation of hot carriers.155,156 While, the size effect is more complex, as a smaller size is beneficial to display high energies and maximize surface active sites but in the meantime causes a blue shift of the resonant frequency and a poor charge separation due to spatial confinement.157,158
Thermal conductivity is another important consideration for designing metal-based catalysts. Decreasing the size of metals would create a high density of grain boundaries and enhance phonon scattering, thus reducing the thermal conductivity.159 Besides, increasing the surface roughness of metals would decrease phonon velocity, which can also reduce the thermal conductivity.160 However, there is a trade-off between efficient heat transfer to reactants and heat loss to surrounding, which is hard to be addressed by tuning the thermal conductivity of catalysts. Instead, heat insulation with a shell or framework material can effectively address this issue by reducing the heat loss to the surrounding.25,142 The design of core@shell structured catalysts is highlighted, where the shell not only performs as an insulation layer to slow heat conduction but also acts as a trapper of IR light radiated from the hot core via absorption and scattering.25 Furthermore, the outer shell may also protect inner metal nanoparticles from thermal expansion and sintering at high temperatures, thus enhancing the catalytic stability.25
Moreover, it is noted that hydrogenating metal catalysts can promote the reactions involving protons such as CO2 reduction by water.26 This is because the hydrogenated metal (M–H) can perform as an electron–proton-transfer mediator, in which the electron and proton in M–H can be released under light irradiation (M–H → M + H+ + e−) and then induce the reduction reaction (e.g., 2H+ + 2e− + CO2 → CO + H2O). While, the re-hydrogenation of the catalyst is needed for its reuse.26
Furthermore, the formation of bimetallic antenna-reactor catalysts by coupling the plasmonic and catalytic functions in a hybrid material effectively extends plasmonic catalysis to materials other than noble metals.161 Typically, in the hybrid material, a metal performs as the concentrator for photo energy (named as plasmonic metal or antenna) and then the energy is directed to the other more active metal (named as catalytic metal or reactor) via energetic charge carriers.36,53,71,162 Tuning the composition, size, and shape of the plasmonic antenna can realize an independent control on the optical property of the complex, while the composition and surface structure of the catalytic metal determine the affinity for adsorbates and affect the overall reactivity of the complex.163 Nevertheless, there is a balance among the light absorption in plasmonic metal, local field enhancement at catalytic metal, and collective scattering of photons out of the complex, to reach the optimal catalytic performance.164


3.1.4. Synergetic catalysts. 
Combing multiple components which play different roles is an effective approach to develop highly efficient thermo-photo catalysts. Firstly, a thermal catalyst can be coupled with a photocatalyst, in which the charge carriers generated in the photocatalyst under illumination can be transferred to the thermal catalyst to promote its thermal catalytic activity.165,166 In this case, the synergetic effect occurs at the interface between the thermal catalyst and photocatalyst.167 Secondly, a photocatalyst which is responsible for photo-induced redox reactions can be coupled with a photo-thermal material for heat supply. This allows the effective utilization of full-spectrum solar light since the former mainly relies on high-energy photons while the latter is set apart for the utilization of low-energy photons.95,106,110,168 Thirdly, a thermal catalyst can be loaded on a photo-thermal support which shows an excellent light absorption property and thus increases the catalyst temperature for an improved catalytic performance.32,55,169 The above-discussed bimetallic antenna-reactor catalyst is a representative of this type of synergetic catalysts.

3.2. How to place catalyst?
Though having received less attention, thermo-photo catalytic performance is highly dependent on the placement method of catalysts. In general, the catalyst can be suspended in a certain liquid, compacted into a catalyst bed, or coated on a substrate. In this subsection, we will present the placement principles and analyse each kind of placement method with an emphasis on the state-of-the-art substrates developed for coating catalysts.

3.2.1. Placement principles. 
Firstly, a rational placement of catalysts should ensure the efficient adsorption of reactants and desorption of products. Namely, the surface active sites of the catalyst should be adequately exposed to reactants, and meanwhile the products can be fast desorbed from catalyst surface to regenerate the active sites.95,170 Only with the guaranteed mass transfer can the catalytic reaction proceed efficiently.
Secondly, all the catalyst particles can easily access thermal and photo energies with high energy absorption and conversion rates. To meet this requirement, the heat transfer distance and light penetration depth should be carefully considered.44,171,172 Moreover, photons are expected to be absorbed to excite charge carriers instead of being scattered or reflected.21,107


3.2.2. Catalyst suspension. 
If the catalytic process involves liquid-phase substances at the operating condition (temperature and pressure), catalyst particles are generally suspended in liquid under continuous stirring.21,29,173 The liquid substance can be either reactants or additional inert solvents, and continuous stirring is essential to achieve fast mass transfer as well as sufficient and uniform exposure of catalyst particles to thermal and photo energies.
The suitability of catalyst suspension for a catalytic reaction mainly depends on the phase of reactants. Namely, if all the reactants are in (mutually soluble) liquid phase such as water splitting (below 100 °C), the suspension system is favoured. While, if some reactants are in gas phase such as CO2 reduction by water, the suspension system would limit the accessibility of the catalyst toward gas reactants unless these gas reactants possess high solubilities in the liquid.170,173,174
While, the influence of the product phase on catalytic efficiency is not significant since the stirred catalyst suspension is advantageous for cleaning active sites, especially for the removal of soluble products from catalyst surface to the liquid solvent.28,95,173 For example, in partial oxidation of CH4, water suppressed the accessibility of CH4 but promoted the desorption of liquid oxygenates, leading to an overall enhancement in catalytic efficiency.28,173 This implies that the rate-limiting mass transfer step should be clarified before considering building a catalyst suspension system.


3.2.3. Catalyst bed. 
For gas-phase reactions conducted in flow reactors, catalyst particles are generally compacted into a catalyst bed. The gas flow goes through the whole catalyst bed with light irradiation along or perpendicular to the gas flow direction.30,44,175 The gas-phase catalyst-bed system generally demonstrates efficient molecular adsorption and desorption. However, it is noted that the penetration depth of incident photons is below 100 μm, so not all the catalyst particles share the same opportunity to access photons especially in thick catalyst beds.44,171,172 Namely, the short penetration depth may cause the “waste” of catalysts. While, the combination with photo-thermal effect would result in temperature gradients throughout the catalyst bed, which might be favourable for the generation of unstable products (see Section 5.1 for details).44 Even putting photo-thermal effect aside, the temperature of catalyst beds may still be non-uniform as affected by the heating mode, position of thermocouples, and thermal conductivity of gases, which should be taken into account when analysing the relation between the temperature and catalytic activity.


3.2.4. Catalyst coated on a substrate. 
On top of the traditional catalyst suspension and catalyst bed, catalyst particles can be coated on a substrate. While general substrates just support and disperse catalyst particles, some novel substrates including light-absorption substrates, light-diffuse-reflection substrates, and omnidirectional substrates have been developed, which can increase catalyst temperature, enhance incident light utilization, and prepare thermo-photo catalysis for practical application, respectively. These substrates and their unique functions will be elucidated in the following part.
3.2.4.1. General substrates. 
General substrates refer to the substrates without specific functions except for supporting catalyst particles and suppressing their agglomeration, such as glass fibre, glass slide, etc.169,176,177 Coating catalyst particles onto a general substrate allows the convenient collection and reuse of catalysts compared with catalyst suspensions, and moreover, enhances the dispersion and reduces the required amount of catalyst particles compared with catalyst beds. Substrates coated with catalysts can be applied for catalytic systems of all phases.
3.2.4.2. Light-absorption (dark) substrates. 
Light-absorption substrates are exploited to convert photo energy into thermal energy to heat loaded catalyst particles, so they can also be regarded as photo-thermal substrates. These substrates generally have a dark or even black appearance with a broad light absorption across the entire solar spectrum. The explored light-absorption substrates range from synthetic materials such as black silicon,102,107,178 Fe3Si aerogel,179 and Cr film,180 to biomass such as surface-charred wood.41,181
Furthermore, photo-thermal substrate can be coupled with a pyroelectric substrate, which allows the generation of pyroelectric field around the catalyst.182 As-induced pyroelectric field can guide the migration direction of photo-generated charge carriers, thus promoting their separation, extending their lifetime, and achieving high catalytic efficiencies.183
3.2.4.3. Light-diffuse-reflection substrates. 
The employment of light-diffuse-reflection substrates contributes to the redirection of incident light, thus promoting light utilization (Fig. 5a).21,107 This concept was first demonstrated by Hu and co-workers by creating a light-diffuse-reflection SiO2 substrate with a surface roughness of 0.078 μm and a light scattering coefficient of 385 cm2 g−1, which enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency by 100 times compared with the catalyst suspension system.21 Such improvement was owed to the remarkably increased light absorbance of the catalyst for surface-diffuse-reflected lights as supported by UV-visible spectra (Fig. 5b). Besides SiO2, filter paper with rough surface also exhibits a strong light diffuse reflection, making it a cheap and convenient substrate for photocatalysis. While, filter paper can only be applied under mild conditions but SiO2 with a high chemical and mechanical stability can be applied under harsher conditions.21,22,27,33,39,40,82

Besides, some well aligned architectures have been explored as light-diffuse-reflection substrates. The vertically aligned Si nanowires showed an enhanced light harvesting with reflectance below ∼3% across the entire solar spectrum.107,184,185 Here, the even distribution of catalyst particles on substrate plays a key role for efficient light scattering and internal reflections within the long nanowire arrays (Fig. 5c).107 In addition, inverse opal photonic crystal (Fig. 5d) also acts as a promising substrate due to the coupling of incident light into resonant photonic modes which increases the light propagation length through the material.102,178 While, opaline photonic crystal support comprised of silica spheres (Fig. 5e) showed a much poorer light harvesting.178
3.2.4.4. Omnidirectional (spherical) substrates. 
Planar substrates are the most widely used so far, whereas they cannot absorb all rays as long as it is not at the perpendicular incidence. From the perspective of practical application based on sunlight irradiation, since the solar azimuth and elevation angles keep changing throughout the day, the photon density acquired by planar substrates from sun remains low.186 In contrast, the development of spherical omnidirectional substrates can address this issue with a hemispherical surface facing sunlight all day long regardless of incident angles (Fig. 5f).112

3.3. Design of thermo-photo catalytic reactor
Designing and building an appropriate reactor for the target catalytic reaction is of vital importance to achieve a satisfying catalytic performance. Depending on the heat source, thermo-photo catalytic reactors can be divided into two groups, namely, reactors with light-induced local heating and reactors with external global heating. Here, the general design principles of thermo-photo catalytic reactors will be revealed first, followed by discussion on these two groups of reactors.

3.3.1. Design principles. 
The first consideration for reactor design is the heat source, namely, either photo-converted heat or external heat, followed by consideration on the operation mode, namely, either batch mode or flow mode. While, no matter which type of thermo-photo catalytic reactor is needed, the following design principles should be complied.
Firstly, light can shine on all catalyst particles. This requires a rational design on the direction and intensity of incident light. Moreover, the window used for closed reaction systems should demonstrate a high light transmittance, and the quartz glass has been considered as an ideal window material.21,90 The reactants and products should not accumulate on the window to supress light transmission.
Secondly, an efficient thermal transfer inside the reactor and an excellent thermal insulation against outer environment are desired. These two aspects contribute to high energy utilization and conversion efficiencies, which reduce energy consumption and thereby the cost of running the system.187,188
Thirdly, no safety issues exist when running the catalytic reactor. The safety issues might be resulted by the high temperature, high pressure, high-intensity illumination, gas leakage, mechanical damage, etc. Therefore, a prudent reactor design and safety precautions are indispensable.


3.3.2. Reactors with light-induced local heating. 
Some of thermo-photo catalytic reactors rely on light-induced local heating over the catalyst and/or substrate without any external resistive heating sources. These reactors are also called photo-thermal reactors. For these reactors, the primary design considerations are the reactor geometry for maximizing incident light flux and the highly efficient internal heat deposition.187,189–191
Typical photo-thermal batch reactor and flow reactor are illustrated in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, respectively. The inside catalyst placement is not shown, which can refer to Section 3.2. The photo-thermal batch reactor only has one port for initial gas feeding and sampling at a certain time interval (Fig. 6a). While, in photo-thermal flow reactor, feed gases enter the reactor from one end and then pass through the catalyst under light irradiation to the other end (Fig. 6b). Moreover, for practical application, collectors can be designed to concentrate lights toward the reactor to amplify the heat intensity (Fig. 6c).74,192,193

3.3.3. Reactors with external global heating. 
Distinct from above photo-thermal reactors, some thermo-photo catalytic reactors are equipped with external heating devices (such as electric furnaces). In contrast to the local heating in photo-thermal reactors which is only for the catalyst, the external heating devices typically provide the global heating for both catalyst and reactants, thus enhancing the catalytic activity.34 While, a few devices provide single-plane heating, which may result in the temperature gradient for thick catalyst beds.44,175
The typical externally heated batch reactor and flow reactor are illustrated in Fig. 6d and Fig. 6e, respectively. The only difference from above photo-thermal reactors is the outer electric heater.30,73 In addition, the externally heated thermo-photo catalytic flow reactor can be easily built by modifying a traditional tube furnace.21,40 As shown in Fig. 6f, this is achieved by creating a hole in the furnace wall and using a quartz tube to allow light transmission.

4. How does thermal energy promote photocatalysis?
While a number of efforts have been made to get excellent thermo-photo catalytic performance, the synergetic effects of thermal and photo energies remain confusing, and a systematic analysis and evaluation of current works is still lacking. To make it clear, the following two sections will be respectively focused on “How does thermal energy promote photocatalysis?” and “How does light irradiation accelerate thermal catalysis?” to reveal the synergetic roles of thermal and photo energies.
In the present section, a deep and comprehensive understanding on the approaches that introducing thermal energy promotes the photocatalytic process will be provided based on principles and some specific examples of thermo-assisted photocatalysis and thermo-photo co-catalysis. This will cover the enhancement in kinetic driving force for effective utilization of visible light, controllable redox potentials, facilitated migration of charge carriers, accelerated mass transfer, promoted dissociation of reactants, as well as adjustable catalyst structure.
4.1. Enhancing the kinetic driving force of reactants
How to effectively utilize visible and IR lights for photocatalytic processes has been a puzzle for almost half a century. A great number of research efforts have been made in developing photocatalysts with visible light absorption,12,194,195 whereas it was found that light absorption cannot guarantee its effective utilization for catalytic conversion.12,39,40 Groundbreakingly, in 2015, Hu's group revealed the intrinsic conflict of visible-light photocatalysis and introduced thermal energy to enhance the kinetic driving force of reactants to effectively address this issue, realizing highly efficient visible-light driven H2 production from water.21
As shown in Fig. 7a, when UV light is absorbed, electrons would be excited from the valence band to the conduction band of black TiO2 catalyst to reduce protons into H2, and meanwhile, sacrificial CH3OH is oxidized. In this case, the driving force for electron donation from CH3OH (energy difference between the redox potential of CH2O/CH3OH and valence band maximum) is 2.78 eV. In contrast, when visible or near-IR light is absorbed, electrons can only be excited from the Ti3+ mid-gap state due to the low photon energy, to drive the same reaction. Here, the driving force of CH3OH oxidation (energy difference between the redox potential of CH2O/CH3OH and Ti3+ level) is just 0.88 eV, much smaller than that under UV light. The insufficient oxidation driving force is the main cause of the negligible H2 production rate and quantum efficiency under visible light irradiation (Fig. 7b). This reflects the intrinsic conflict in photocatalysis which cannot be addressed by tuning the band structure of photocatalysts. Namely, while a narrow band gap is beneficial for visible light absorption, a wide band gap is desired to provide sufficient driving force.

Instead of adjusting the band structure, Hu and co-workers introduced thermal energy into the photocatalytic system to increase the kinetic energy of CH3OH molecules.21 This, as kinetic driving force, compensates the insufficient potential driving force, allowing electron donation from CH3OH to Ti3+ level and thus stimulating the whole reaction. Consequently, photo-induced H2 production rate and quantum efficiency in visible range were enhanced by several orders of magnitude (Fig. 7c). Although black TiO2 with a mid-gap state is used as an example here, the compensation effect of kinetic driving force of reactants to the potential driving force of corresponding semi-reactions is applicable for all semiconductor-based catalysts with narrow band gaps such as WO3.28,90 The effective utilization of visible light for highly efficient photocatalysis with thermal input has been demonstrated in a series of reactions over varied catalysts.22,27,28,33,39,40,90
On top of effectively utilizing visible light, elevating temperature shows a universal advantage for activating reactant molecules. This is due to the increased population of adsorbates in excited vibrational states based on Bose–Einstein distribution, which generally leads to an enhanced reaction rate.26,95,196 Moreover, since heat can be provided via photo-to-thermal conversion with visible and IR lights, the full-spectrum light utilization for different functions can be achieved. Namely, heat resulting from visible and IR light absorption on metals or defective metal oxides activates reactants and thus promotes the photocatalytic process driven by charge excitation with UV light absorption over the semiconductor.95,106,145,168,197
4.2. Tuning the redox potential of semi-reactions
Photocatalysis requires a favourable band alignment for both thermodynamics and kinetics, namely, appropriate relative positions of redox potentials for semi-reactions to the energy bands of catalyst.21,33,39,40 The redox potential of semi-reactions is dependent on temperature, whereas in most cases the temperature effect is neglected. According to Nernst equation and thermochemical (Born–Haber) cycle, the redox potential of H+/H2 at temperature T can be calculated viaeqn (1).33,67 (1)where ΔGf, n, and F represent Gibbs free energy change of formation, number of electron equivalents, and Faraday constant, respectively. Then, the redox potential of the semi-reaction of interest can be calculated according to Gibbs free energy change of reaction ΔGr(T) (eqn (2)). (2)
For example, to obtain the redox potential of O2/H2O, ΔGr(T) for the reaction between H2 and O2 to form H2O needs to be calculated.
The temperature control on redox potentials was first utilized by Hu and co-workers for dry reforming of CH4, owing to which the favourable thermodynamics and kinetics were achieved.33 As shown in Fig. 8a, at room temperature, the redox potential of CO2/CO (−0.526 V vs. SHE) is more negative than conduction band minimum (−0.500 V vs. SHE), indicating that the reduction of CO2 into CO is thermodynamically impossible. While, elevating temperature can shift this redox potential to more positive values as −0.477 V at 150 °C and −0.162 V at 600 °C. This not only enables a thermodynamically favourable reaction, but also enhances the driving force (defined in Section 4.1) for CO2 reduction to 0.338 V at 600 °C. In the meantime, the driving force for CH4 oxidation through electron donation to Ti3+ mid-gap state is enhanced from 0.480 V at room temperature to 0.877 V at 600 °C. Owing to the favourable redox potentials and enhanced kinetic energy of reactants, H2 and CO yields were significantly increased at high temperatures above 300 °C under both simulated sunlight and visible light irradiation (inset of Fig. 8a).

Copyright (2021) Elsevier. 
In addition to dry reforming of CH4 (Fig. 8b), redox potentials of NH3 synthesis (Fig. 8c) and water splitting (Fig. 8d) have also been calculated.67 It is clear that all the redox potentials are highly dependent on temperature, with variations up to ∼1 V from room temperature to 1200 °C. Moreover, the reversal of thermodynamic favourability occurs at a certain temperature for dry reforming of CH4 and NH3 synthesis.
Furthermore, it is noted that elevating temperature would lead to a slight decrease in the band gap of semiconductors due to the increased interatomic spacings, while such an effect is not as noticeable as that on redox potentials.27 The thermal contribution to band gap reduction is believed proportional to temperature change (ΔT) multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (k = 8.617 × 10−5 eV K−1) (eqn (3)). ΔEgap = k × ΔT(3)
Therefore, even a 1000 K temperature rise can only reduce the band gap by ∼0.086 eV. While, reactants may induce more intense chemical alteration of catalysts at high temperatures such as catalyst reduction by H2, which may further narrow the band gap.119
4.3. Facilitating the migration of charge carriers
By gaining energy from heating, the energy level of charge carriers is further raised, thus being more active than those only excited by illumination.196,198 Meanwhile, the migration of charge carriers toward either charge separation or charge recombination is facilitated.147,199 The facilitated charge separation promotes charge-carrier-mediated catalytic processes, while the facilitated charge recombination is beneficial for thermal-energy-driven catalytic processes. The overall effect, which is generally determined by the structure and properties of catalysts as well as the specific temperature, can be evaluated by collecting time-resolved photoluminescence spectra at elevated temperatures46 or carrying out transient photovoltage measurements or in situ photoconductivity tests.114,200,201

Fig. 9a shows that increased temperature prolonged the exciton lifetime of Fe/MoS2 catalyst, which can be directly correlated to its catalytic activity for N2 fixation (Fig. 9b).46 Transient photovoltage measurement is another technology to reveal the carrier lifetime, based on which a higher temperature was found to increase the lifetime of photo-generated carriers over TiO2, thus enhancing H2 production.201 Furthermore, a significant increase in photoconductivity upon elevating temperature to 125 °C revealed the increased number of active charge carriers by heating Pt/g-C3N4 catalyst, while further heating to 150 °C would promote charge recombination and thus lower photoconductivity (Fig. 9c). The order of photocurrents at different temperatures (I125°C > I150°C > I100°C > IRT) is consistent with the CH4 yields in thermo-photo catalytic CO2 reduction (Fig. 9d).114

Furthermore, the current–voltage (I–V) curve obtained from current atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) and the contact potential difference between tip and sample measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) could illustrate the mobility of charge carriers.202 While the former is based on conductivity, the latter implies electron transfer toward catalyst surface for reactions.98 As an example, KPFM measurements revealed the facilitated escape of electrons from the surface of SnSe/ZnIn2S4 catalyst by 808 nm light irradiation to elevate temperature by 9.5 °C, which was responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic performance.98
4.4. Accelerating mass transfer
Mass transfer rate is directly correlated to temperature, namely, a higher temperature generally leads to a faster mass transfer. For thermo-photo catalysis, three aspects of mass transfer are involved, including the diffusion of reactants and products through liquid or gas media, adsorption onto and desorption from catalyst surface, and transfer of intermediate species across catalyst surface.28,90,170
The diffusion coefficient in liquid phase (DL) can be calculated via Stokes–Einstein equation (eqn (4)). (4)where T, ψ, M, μ, and V denote temperature, solute–solvent interaction factor, molecular weight of solvent, viscosity of solvent, and molar volume of solute at boiling point, respectively. It is noted that diffusion coefficient DL increases with temperature, indicating accelerated mass transfer. While, the diffusion coefficient in gas phase (DG) is acquired based on Chapman–Enskog theory (eqn (5)). (5)in which T, M1, M2, P, σ, and Ω represent temperature, molecular weight of solute gas, molecular weight of solvent gas, pressure of the system, average collision diameter, and temperature-dependent collision integral, respectively. Here, diffusion coefficient DG also increases with temperature. The solute gas would experience friction resistance in adjacent interlayers due to its relative motion with environmental particles.203
When the temperature is sufficient to drive the liquid-to-gas phase transition, the diffusion coefficient can undergo a significant change as the result of different interfacial friction resistances. Taking the diffusion of H2 in water as an example, the liquid-phase diffusion coefficient DL at 100 °C is 5.03 ×10−5, while in steam phase, the diffusion coefficient DG is as large as 2.65 × 10−3 at the same temperature.41 The 53-time enhancement in diffusion coefficient implies the facilitated mass transfer by converting traditional solid–liquid–gas three-phase catalytic system (Fig. 10a) to a solid–gas two-phase one (Fig. 10b) by raising temperature.41,181 Such effect is very important for the transfer of insoluble gaseous reactants toward catalyst surface, such as the diffusion of CH4 through water to catalyst for its partial oxidation.28,29,95

Copyright (2020) American Chemical Society. 
In addition to the diffusion in liquid or gas media, the transfer of species on catalyst surface is another key factor determining catalytic efficiency.97,146,204 The transferred species is typically the mediator for oxidation and reduction semi-reactions, such as proton transfer in CO2 reduction by water.26,146,205 Namely, protons produced in the oxidation semi-reaction (2H2O → 4e− + 4H+ + O2) can be transferred to electron-rich reduction sites to form water (2H+ + 2e− + CO2 → CO + H2O). It is clear that electron transfer and proton transfer are synchronous while proton transfer is the rate-limiting step with a time scale of hundreds of microseconds, in contrast to a few picoseconds for electron transfer.146 The introduction of thermal energy is an effective strategy to promote proton transfer, which benefits multiple proton/electron coupling, thus enhancing the overall reaction rate.205
Besides, the desorption of products would also be facilitated by temperature rise. The timely removal of products allows the refresh of active sites, thus promoting catalytic activity and stability.101,197,206 This has been demonstrated in a probe reaction of CO2 hydrogenation with water as a byproduct.103,206 As shown in Fig. 10c, a small amount of water (5 or 10 μL, much below that of ∼1.4 mL formed in CO2 hydrogenation) could significantly decrease CH4 production rate at all temperatures, indicating that water formed during reaction would inhibit subsequent CO2 hydrogenation due to its strong adsorption on catalyst.103 Nevertheless, it is evident that an increase in temperature, especially after surpassing the threshold temperature of 100 °C (boiling point of water), favoured water desorption, and therefore, enhanced CH4 evolution.103,207 Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the heat that drives product desorption can be provided not only via electric furnaces or photo-to-thermal conversion but also through the exothermic reaction itself.163 As an example, the heat generated by dissociative adsorption of N2O is larger than the desorption energy of O2, leading to promoted O2 desorption and self-sustained thermo-photo catalytic N2O decomposition.163
Furthermore, the temperature adjustment enables selectivity control based on the competition between thermal desorption of primary product and secondary photochemical reaction.91,92 As shown in Fig. 10d, the selectivity of photocatalytic reforming of isobutanol over TiO2(110) highly depended on surface temperature.92 Isobutanal was the primary product formed with the assistance of photo-generated holes and dominated at room temperature where its thermal desorption was fast (Fig. 10e). While, propane was formed at a lower temperature of 240 K due to the slow thermal desorption of isobutanal that allowed its subsequential photo-oxidation (Fig. 10f). Similar phenomenon has also been observed in photocatalytic reforming of CH3OH into HCHO and HCOOCH3.91 These works highlight the capability of tuning temperature to regulate photocatalytic selectivity.
4.5. Promoting the dissociation of reactants
Elevating temperature is an effective strategy to promote the dissociation of reactant molecules such as H2,101,106,208 CO,105 and H2O42 on catalyst surface, allowing a much easier initiation of reactions.26,42 This is especially important for overall water splitting that relies on the ionic dissociation of H2O into H+ and OH− for H2 evolution and O2 evolution, respectively. While the water ionization constant (Kw) at room temperature is as small as 1 × 10−14, it can be enhanced by three orders of magnitude by raising temperature, showing a peak at ∼270°C.209 Such trend is consistent with the temperature-dependent thermo-photo catalytic water splitting efficiency over Au/N-doped TiO2/MgO catalyst, where the highest H2 production rate was obtained at 270°C.42 Here, the increased H+ and OH− ions not only promoted the reaction by providing more reacting species, but also created a local electric field on catalyst surface that can attract counter-charged carriers so as to suppress their recombination.
4.6. Adjusting catalyst structure
Catalyst structure can be adjusted by thermal input, in which thermal expansion is the most commonly observed. Besides, the change in crystal phase and size distribution of supported nanoparticles may occur upon temperature rise.189 Moreover, reactants may induce more intense chemical change of catalysts at high temperatures.119,210 However, so far, only a few efforts have been made to correlate the catalyst structure at high temperatures to thermo-photo catalytic activity, which requires the use of advanced in situ structure characterization equipment. Very recently, by means of variable-temperature synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, an anisotropic linear thermal expansion was observed in pristine P25 TiO2 (denoted as P0) and N-doped P25 TiO2 (denoted as P3) at high temperatures.211 Namely, as shown in Fig. 11a, linear thermal expansion coefficients for both a-axis and c-axis of the anatase phase in P0 and P3 showed abnormal extremums at 200°C. This anisotropic linear thermal expansion was ascribed to the structural reorganization of TiO2 resulted by the formation of oxygen vacancies above 200°C, which could be correlated to catalytic activities with a clear onset at 200°C for P3, N-doped anatase TiO2 (A3), and N-doped rutile (R3) (Fig. 11b).

5. How does light irradiation accelerate thermal catalysis?
As the counterpart of last section, this section will reveal the approaches that light irradiation accelerates thermal catalysis, including elevating temperature, generating photo carriers and hot carriers, directly exciting adsorbates or adsorbate-catalyst bonds, dynamically controlling elementary step energetics, and modifying active sites. Some important examples for each aspect will be discussed with insights.
5.1. Elevating temperature
Light irradiation can induce the direct local heating on dark semiconductors and plasmonic metals, elevating temperature up to hundreds of degrees Celsius.38,140,169,212–215 For semiconductors, the heating effect is owed to direct vibration absorption of far IR light and indirect non-radiative relaxation of electron–hole pairs (Fig. 3c),68,69,145 and the latter makes the dominant contribution by dissipating excessive energy through lattice vibrations.60,105,106 For plasmonic metals, the non-radiative decay of surface plasmons would induce the local heating of metal lattice due to electron–phonon scattering (Fig. 3d).15,19,123,216 In addition, thermal vibration of molecules may also lead to photo-to-thermal conversion, which is applicable for carbonaceous and polymeric catalysts owing to their abundant conjugated π bonds.63,217
The heat resulting from light irradiation is desired to be efficiently transferred from catalyst to adsorbates to drive catalytic reactions. The thermal equilibrium between the catalyst and adsorbates can be reached within a few picoseconds as evidenced by transient absorption spectroscopy.218 While, the heat loss to surrounding caused by black-body radiation, thermal conduction, and thermal convection should be suppressed.25 The effect of light irradiation on catalyst temperature is generally evaluated using thermocouple or IR thermal imager, while the existence of local hot spots cannot be excluded due to the limited resolution of these techniques.219 To identify if such temperature rise contributes to improved catalytic performance, further comparison with that at the same temperature in dark is needed.16,34,172
Herein, it is worth mentioning that local heating induced by light irradiation is different from global heating provided by electric furnace.34,219 Namely, in global heating, the temperatures of reactants and catalyst are almost the same, while in photo-induced local heating, the temperature of reactants is much lower than that of catalyst before their contact.34 Based on the collision theory, thermal catalytic process strongly depends on the effective collision between reactants and catalyst surface, which is directly related to temperature.220 Therefore, the temperature of reactants plays an important role for overall catalytic performance. This was demonstrated in thermo-photo catalytic synthesis of CH3OH from syngas, with a 3.3-time enhancement in CH3OH yield by elevating reactant temperature from 93 to 260 °C at a fixed catalyst temperature of 350 °C.34
Furthermore, while global heating results in a relatively uniform temperature for entire catalysts (the temperature of catalyst surface may be lower due to the cooling effect of gas flow), light irradiation leads to an evident vertical temperature gradient throughout catalysts especially for thick catalyst beds at high light intensities, since the penetration depth of incident photons is below 100 μm.44,171,172 A new parameter named equivalent temperature (Te) can describe the overall reactivity of thermal reactions in both thermal catalysis and thermo-photo catalysis, which is defined as99 (6)in which Ea, R, T1, and T2 are apparent activation barrier, universal gas constant, and temperatures of the top and bottom of the catalyst bed (Fig. 12a), respectively. Ea is obtained from temperature-dependent thermal catalytic activities. The derived Te is correlated to the effective thermal reaction rate contributed by the heater, lamp, and the exothermic reaction itself.

More importantly, the negative temperature gradient induced by light irradiation can perform as a thermodynamic pump to modulate the global equilibrium and resolve the conflicts in catalysis.44 In the presence of temperature gradient, molecules tend to move from high-temperature zones to low-temperature zones due to thermophoretic force.221 Therefore, under light irradiation, molecules would penetrate from catalyst surface to inner parts. As long as the thermophoretic force aligns with the direction of gas flow (such as that in Fig. 12a), the yield can be enhanced since the product is effectively drawn away from hot region to avoid its decomposition. Namely, a greater top temperature (T1) ensures a high reaction rate, while a smaller bottom temperature (T2) helps to maintain a high yield. This has been demonstrated for NH3 synthesis over Ru–Cs/MgO catalyst, in which the NH3 synthesis rate at the same Te of 333 °C was enhanced by 36% and 192% under light irradiation at 2.0 W cm−2 (ΔT = −39 °C) and 4.7 W cm−2 (ΔT = −184 °C), respectively, in comparison with that in dark (ΔT = +58 °C) (Fig. 12b).44 In this case, the rate-limiting step of N2 dissociation is favoured in the irradiated hotter region while as-produced NH3 is preserved in the dark cooler region.
In addition to controlling the vertical temperature gradient, light irradiation may also induce lateral temperature variations on catalyst surface with an elaborate design on catalyst composition, which can break the theoretical thermal equilibrium limit.43 The most common strategy is to couple a LSPR metal and a substance with a poor thermal conductivity which provide the heating zone and cooling zone, respectively. The local temperature difference in nanostructured catalysts can be measured by temperature-programmed Fourier-transform infrared (TP-FTIR) spectroscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) mapping with certain molecular temperature probes such as adonitol and phenyl isocyanide.43,222,223 Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is another powerful tool for local temperature monitoring based on thermal vibration of atoms illustrated by the Debye–Waller factor change.105,106,224
Again, using NH3 synthesis as an example, a local temperature difference of 137 °C between hotter Fe and cooler hydrogenated TiO2 (TiO2−xHy) under light irradiation contributed to a high NH3 yield (1939 ppm) which is 3.5 times of the thermal catalytic result at the same apparent temperature of 495 °C (560 ppm).43 Furthermore, Fig. 12c illustrates a surpassed thermodynamic equilibrium limit at 495 °C (1249 ppm < 1939 ppm). Taking local temperature differences into account, two new thermodynamic equilibriums at the temperatures of Fe and TiO2−xHy can be plotted. The Fe-solo catalysis showed a reduced thermodynamic limit, while a new working-in-tandem pathway prominently enhanced the limit to 3294 ppm, by which the experimental result (1939 ppm) can be regarded thermodynamically favourable.
5.2. Forming photo carriers
When semiconductor-based catalysts (such as TiO2, SrTiO3, and CeO2) are applied for thermal catalysis, introducing light irradiation can induce the generation of photo carriers as long as the photon energy is not smaller than the catalyst band gap. As-generated photo carriers can activate reactant molecules either directly or indirectly. Direct activation represents the direct reaction between photo carriers (either holes or electrons) and reactants, which has been demonstrated for H2,22 O2,132,133 CO,35,129 CO2,75,225 CH4,31,119 H2O,226 NO,134–136etc.
As a typical example for direct activation, O2 adsorbed on Pd sites of PdOx/CeO2 catalyst could accept photo-generated electrons to form active ˙O2− under illumination (eqn (7)), which then oxidized CO with CO2 and O− as byproducts (Fig. 13a).129 Meanwhile, photo-generated holes would be transferred to PdO and activate the adsorbed CO which then consumed O− or active lattice O atom to produce CO2. Such a mechanism was supported by active species scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. However, in dark, the only pathway was through the reaction between CO adsorbed on PdO and lattice O atoms (Fig. 13b). As a result, CO conversion at 80 °C was greatly enhanced from 25% to 100% by light irradiation. Similar activation has also been demonstrated in CH4 oxidation,133 C3H8 oxidation,132 oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde,227etc. O2 + e− → ˙O2−(7) H2O + h+ → ˙OH + H+(8) CH4 + ˙OH → ˙CH3 + H2(9)

Moreover, photo carriers may activate molecules indirectly via the production of free radicals such as ˙OH (eqn (8)) and ˙O2− (eqn (7)).28,90,228 ˙OH and ˙O2−, as the typical reactive oxygen species (ROS), are more active and oxidative than the precursory H2O and O2.93,229 Here, just as traditional photocatalysis, thermodynamic requirement on the relative band position to redox potential must be satisfied for forming free radicals.28,90,93 As-generated free radicals may react with inert molecules to achieve their activation and dissociation. Most importantly, the electrophilic ˙OH is able to abstract H atoms from CH4 (eqn (9)), which significantly reduces the required thermal input for the dissociation of C–H bonds.28
Besides, photo carriers may accelerate the formation of some intermediate species, thus promoting overall reaction.124,175,210 This is generally demonstrated using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to compare two cases with and without illumination. As shown in Fig. 13c, the generation of formate with characteristic DRIFTS peaks at 1300–1580 cm−1 was promoted by light irradiation over Cu–Zn–Zr oxide catalyst in steam reforming of CH3OH at 200 °C.124 The promoted production of intermediate formate was believed as the main contributor to the 3.2-time enhancement in H2 production shown in Fig. 13d.
Furthermore, photo carriers could enable the conversion of some poisonous species adsorbed on catalyst, which eliminates their negative effects or even makes them active species.48,132,230 For example, water, as both the product and inhibiter of thermal catalytic decomposition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to its competitive adsorption with O2 on active sites, can combine with photo-generated holes to generate ˙OH (eqn (8)) for accelerating VOC decomposition under illumination.48Via this way, an efficient catalytic loop with positive feedback is built.
5.3. Generating hot carriers
When photons resonantly oscillate with free electrons in metal nanoparticles, LSPR is established, which confines photo energy near metal surface in the form of elevated electric fields.231 The stored energy in LSPR field is dissipated via either non-radiative decay or radiative photon scattering within a few femtoseconds.19 The non-radiative decay leads to the generation of hot carriers through intra-band s-to-s transitions or inter-band d-to-s transitions accompanied with a (phonon) temperature increase of metal nanoparticles (Fig. 3d).61,70,232 To identify the contribution of hot carriers from photo-thermal effect, a control experiment at the same temperature in dark is required.32,53 More details about the fundamental aspects of LSPR have been clearly presented in previous reviews,19,20,61,233–236 and here we will mainly focus on the catalysis-related principles and discoveries.
Hot carriers generated via the decay of localized surface plasmons are typically more energetic than the carriers produced via direct photoexcitation (photo carriers).237,238 Moreover, the photo-electronic current induced by hot carriers tracks the surface plasmon resonance absorption spectrum and shows a super-linear dependence on light intensity, which can be directly correlated to catalytic activity.239,240 Namely, as-generated hot carriers may undergo multiplication, leading to an apparent quantum efficiency exceeding 100% at large light intensities.238 Moreover, it should be noted that besides metal itself, adsorbed reactants also affect light absorption and thereby generation of hot carriers, which has been evidenced by comparing the in situ UV-visible spectrum of metal after adsorption and quantum efficiencies at varied wavelengths.73
As-generated hot carriers possess certain mobility due to their high energies.237,241 The transfer proceeds in an ultrafast timescale (<50fs) right after Landau damping and before electron thermalization.242 Adsorbed reactant molecules can significantly change the charge flow within the excited plasmonic system, as a high-rate direct resonant flow from metal to adsorbate which bypasses the conventional charge excitation and thermalization occurring in metal nanoparticles and leads to a greater yield of extracted hot carriers.243 Hot carriers would be injected into the unoccupied or partially occupied molecular orbitals of adsorbate molecule, forming a transient negative ion that subsequently undergoes bond breaking.18,163,244 This mechanism can well describe the activation and dissociation of small molecules such as H2,162,245,246 O2,18 N2,45,247 CH4,248 and CO2.171,177,249 This addresses the issue of difficult activation of nonpolar molecules in thermal catalysis.70,250 Moreover, the presence of hole scavengers such as ethanol would promote multiple electron harvesting, thus enabling reactions involving multi-electron and multi-proton transformation.251 Nevertheless, since photon absorption mainly stimulates electronic transitions within bulk metal, wavelength dependences of competing reactions are similar, so the catalytic selectivity is hard to be controlled by varying excitation wavelength.77
Moreover, hot carriers can be transferred between metals or from metal to support. The electron transfer between metals relies on the d bands at Fermi level that enable the direct momentum-conserved inter-band excitation in visible range,36 while the electron transfer from metal to support occurs as long as the conduction band of support is lower than the electronic excitation state in metal, which leads to the formation of a Schottky junction.234,252,253 The electron transfer direction is opposite to that of traditional photocatalysis over metal-semiconductor composites.175,254,255 As a result, an electron-deficient state is left at metal surface, which is promising to promote bond activation at low temperatures.122 This could be elucidated in thermo-photo catalytic CH4 steam reforming system. Namely, according to the transient absorption spectra (Fig. 14a), electron injection from Rh into TiO2 in Rh/TiO2 catalyst occurred within 250 fs, while such an injection was inhibited in Rh/SiO2 and Rh/ZrO2 catalysts due to the high conduction bands of SiO2 and ZrO2.122 As shown in Fig. 14b, the resulting electron-deficient Rhδ+ site at Rh surface showed a great advantage to accept σ electrons of CH4 and facilitated the cleavage of C–H bonds, while the electrons transferred to TiO2 could deposit their energy into the antibonding orbital of water and induced its reduction into H2.122,256

Furthermore, as-generated hot carriers may change the rate-limiting step in the whole reaction, promote the conversion of intermediate species, and accelerate the desorption of final products (by electronically exciting adsorbed species).23,32,76,86,125,257–259 It is highlighted that the surface coverage of catalyst can be dynamically controlled by hot carriers. Though the adsorption of reactants is necessary, their excessive occupation of active sites is undesirable, which affects reaction energetics.55,77 The generation of hot carriers can mitigate the energy penalty for cleaning active sites, thus reducing apparent activation barrier in comparison to that of thermal catalysis.55 Besides catalytic activity, hot carriers may enhance catalytic selectivity and stability as well, by adjusting the kinetics for bond activation and product desorption from catalyst surface.32,76,130,248
5.4. Directly exciting adsorbates or adsorbate–catalyst bonds
Besides the catalyst-mediated photoexcitation of charge carriers which then react with reactants (Fig. 14c) as discussed in the last two sections, there are two more direct photoexcitation mechanisms, which are the direct photoexcitation with intramolecular HOMO–LUMO transitions in weakly chemisorbed systems (Fig. 14d) and the direct photoexcitation of hybridized catalyst-adsorbate bonds in strongly chemisorbed systems (Fig. 14e).56,77,260–262 The direct and indirect mechanisms can be distinguished by comparing the measured wavelength-resolved quantum efficiencies with the simulated characteristics of metals based on finite-difference time-domain simulations.263 Simulated characteristics include surface electric field enhancement for direct photoexcitation and hot carrier density for indirect photoexcitation. Here, mechanistic distinction is essential for developing highly efficient plasmon-mediated catalytic processes due to the different optimization considerations on electromagnetic field strength either at the surface (direct) or inside (indirect) the nanostructure.263,264
The intramolecular HOMO–LUMO transition of reactant molecule leads to an increased polarizability and thereby its response to plasmonic field gradient, which enhances its adsorption on catalyst and may further tune catalytic selectivity.56,262,265 Namely, species with a stronger light absorption to transform into excited state may experience a stronger plasmon-based force of attraction, which adds up to general van der Waals force to overcome its Brownian motion, showing a greater coverage on catalyst surface and thus being converted more favourably.
More attention has been paid to the direct photoexcitation of catalyst–adsorbate bonds since a strong chemisorption is required for most chemical reactions. In this case, the electronic transition occurs between the hybridized bonding and antibonding states which are formed via charge donation from adsorbate or back-donation from the d states of metal.266 This allows a much more efficient utilization of photons with low energies, extending light response from UV to visible and even near-IR regions.260 More importantly, such a direct adsorbate-specific mechanism enables the selectivity control of catalytic reactions. This has been demonstrated for preferential CO oxidation in a H2-rich atmosphere. Namely, the selective photon-induced activation of Pt–CO bonds on Pt/Al2O3 catalyst could significantly enhance CO2 selectivity from 44% to 81% at 170 °C.77 While, further increasing the temperature would lower the selectivity due to the favoured production of thermodynamically stable products. Therefore, the selectivity control by direct excitation of adsorbate–catalyst bonds suffers a balance between providing a high temperature for low-intensity photon fluxes to show a significant impact on activity and maintaining a low temperature to keep the kinetic control of selectivity.
5.5. Dynamically controlling elementary step energetics
Periodic oscillation of elementary step energetics on catalysts is promising to realize higher activity and selectivity than those with static energetics.267,268 Thanks to the capability of light to modify the energetics of elementary steps, pulsed illumination enables surface oscillation between two adsorbate binding energies and thereby two rate-limiting steps at frequencies in resonance with reaction kinetics, which leads to an enhancement in catalytic performance.126,269 Using CH3OH decomposition over Pt/SiO2 catalyst as a probe reaction, the oscillation between a reactive surface limited by active site availability in dark (due to the strong bonding of CO to Pt) and a clean surface limited by activation of reactants (CH3OH) under light irradiation (Fig. 15a) contributed to a steady-state rate surpassing either static conditions (Fig. 15b).126

5.6. Modifying active sites
Light irradiation can modify active sites for thermal catalysis via either persistent adjustment or transient induction.52,82 In the former case, light irradiation is regarded as a pre-treatment or regeneration technique for catalysts, while in the latter case, photo energy must be provided all the time during reaction to maintain catalytically active sites, which will be respectively discussed in the following part.
The pre-treatment and regeneration of catalysts to provide sufficient active sites by light irradiation are mainly dependent on the redox abilities of photo-generated electrons and holes over semiconductor-based catalysts.82,230,270 When metals or low-valence metal oxides (especially for non-noble metals with multiple valence states) act as active sites, a reduction pre-treatment process with H2 is generally required.83,84 As long as the reduction potential of metal oxide is below its conduction band minimum, the in situ photo-reduction of metal oxide by photo-generated electrons would occur.40,82,85 This has been demonstrated on Cu–Zn–Ti oxide catalyst for steam reforming of CH3OH.82 Namely, photo-generated electrons in ZnO and TiO2 tended to accumulate on the conduction band of CuO to induce its reduction into Cu2O (Fig. 16a). After in situ photo-activation of the catalyst, light can be turned off with only a slight decrease in H2 production rate (Fig. 16b) due to the contribution of photo carriers to the redox reaction (Fig. 16a).

Copyright (2013) American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
In contrast, in some cases, high-valence metal ions are responsible for high catalytic activities, so in situ photo-oxidation by holes plays an important role.230 For example, thermal catalytic oxidation that benefits from high-valence metal oxide catalysts with sufficient lattice oxygen may lose activity due to the reduction of surface metal ions such as Mn4+/Mn3+ to Mn2+ and Ce4+ to Ce3+, while the deactivated catalyst can be regenerated (re-oxidized) by light irradiation.230
The duration of illumination treatment would affect catalyst structure and thereby catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 16c, pre-treatment of Pt/TiO2 catalyst with UV light up to 30 min led to the injection of photo-generated electrons from TiO2 to Pt, which facilitated the migration of subsurface oxygen and dissociation of O2 molecule, thus increasing activated oxygen on catalyst surface.149 However, light irradiation beyond 30 min resulted in partial oxidation of Pt because the overcrowded activated oxygen on Pt surface was forced into subsurface sites. Consequently, the optimal catalytic performance for HCOOH oxidation was obtained with 30 min illumination pre-treatment. This is also applicable for other noble metal deposits such as Au and Pd. Moreover, a pre-treatment (or post-treatment before next cycle) by illumination was also reported to be able to create defects (such as oxygen vacancies) in catalyst271 and remove carbon-containing species from catalyst surface,270 which enhanced the accessibility of active sites to reactant molecules, thus promoting catalytic activity up to 7 times.
In addition to persistent adjustment, the real-time control of catalytically active sites (transient induction) by light irradiation is even more attractive, which enables some impossible thermal catalytic reactions. Most importantly, light irradiation is able to maintain metallic active sites under an oxidative atmosphere for oxidation reactions.52,132 As reported by Linic's group, visible-light driven photoexcitation of LSPR of Cu contributed to the reduction of surface Cu2O into metallic Cu, thus realizing highly efficient and selective epoxidation of propylene.52 This was demonstrated by the in situ UV-visible spectra collected at 200 °C, where the illuminated catalyst showed an evident excitation corresponding to metallic Cu, in great contrast to that of the catalyst in dark (Fig. 16d). Besides, the spectrum under illumination of <500 nm light showed no excitation for metallic Cu (Fig. 16e), suggesting the key role of LSPR of Cu with a characteristic absorption at ∼565 nm.
Another role of light irradiation is to dynamically control the redox properties of metal oxide catalysts (such as CeO2 and Cu2O).24,81,213,272 Namely, photo-generated electrons can induce the reduction of metal ions to form lower-valence metal ions and oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial for reactions with oxygen vacancies as adsorption and catalytically active sites (such as CO2 conversion), ensuring an excellent catalytic stability in long-term operation.81,135,136,225,273 Moreover, in recent studies, it was found that light irradiation could help to reinstate the balance among Cu, Cu+, and Cu2+ in Cu-based catalysts, thus maintaining a high catalytic efficiency for CO2 hydrogenation.24,274 On top of metal oxides, the controllable decoration of oxygen on the surface of metal carbide and metal nitride catalysts by light irradiation can also improve catalytic activity and selectivity.37,275
Moreover, photo-activation of surface lattice oxygen in metal oxide catalysts can significantly promote thermal catalytic oxidation reactions that follow Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) pathway: adsorbed molecules are oxidized by surface lattice oxygen, and then the remaining oxygen vacancies are replenished by O2.89,276–280 The former step is the rate-limiting one, which indicates the vital importance of activating lattice oxygen.281,282 The combination of temperature-programmed reduction (TPR, with H2 or CO) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD, with O2) techniques in dark and under illumination can demonstrate the effect of light on lattice oxygen of catalysts.131,283,284 As shown in Fig. 17a, the first H2 reduction peak of LaMnO3 catalyst showed an evident shift to low temperature with an increased H2 consumption upon illumination, indicating improved lattice oxygen reducibility and increased amount of active lattice oxygen.283 O2-TPD measurements (Fig. 17b) further confirmed the light-promoted generation of active oxygen according to the considerable increase in desorbed oxygen amount under illumination. Such photo-activation has been widely observed with a positive effect on thermo-photo catalytic decomposition of VOCs.131,276,283

6. How to explore thermo-photo catalytic mechanism?
The catalytic process involving both thermal and photo energies is rather complicated. The exploration of thermo-photo catalytic mechanism will provide more insights into reaction control. This section will comprehensively discuss the state-of-the-art approaches used to explore catalytic mechanisms of thermo-photo catalytic processes, including activation barrier determination, isotope labelling experiments, photoelectrochemical measurements, some advanced in situ or operando characterization technologies, and emerging embedded correlated wavefunction calculations.
6.1. Activation barrier determination
Activation barrier for a reaction is recognized as the sum of activation barrier of the rate-limiting step, enthalpy of steps producing species involved in the rate-limiting step, and enthalpy for the desorption of reaction intermediates from active sites.285 By measuring reaction rates at a range of temperatures and preparing Arrhenius (lnk − 1/T) plot, apparent activation barrier (Ea) can be obtained based on Arrhenius equation (eqn (10) and (11)). (10) (11)in which k, R, T, and A are rate constant, universal gas constant, surface temperature of catalyst, and a constant. The comparison of activation barriers of thermal catalytic process and thermo-photo catalytic process reveals the primary reaction enhancement mechanism. Namely, if two activation barriers are almost the same, the primary reaction enhancement is due to photo-thermal heating.163 The determination of reaction orders in these two cases can further confirm this mechanism since the identical reaction orders indicate the same rate-limiting step.55
While, the difference in thermal catalytic activation barrier and thermo-photo catalytic activation barrier implies a more complex reaction enhancement mechanism due to the mediation of charge carriers, modification of active sites, etc.40,55,86,122,132 For plasmonic catalysis, a concept of light-dependent activation barrier was introduced by Halas and co-workers, which enabled the quantification of hot carrier and thermal contributions in a unified picture.86 Firstly, the reaction rates over a range of catalyst surface temperatures at certain light wavelengths (λ) and intensities (I) were measured. Subsequently, based on photo-induced reaction rates (by subtracting thermal catalytic reaction rates), activation barrier Ea(λ, I) was obtained according to Arrhenius equation. As shown in Fig. 18a, the 3D contour map of Ea(λ, I) for NH3 decomposition over Cu–Ru/MgO–Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated that (1) the wavelength dependence was similar for all intensities and (2) the decreasing trend of Ea with increasing intensity applied for all wavelengths. At 550 nm (corresponding to the LSPR frequency) and 4 W cm−2, Ea reached the minimum of ∼0.27 eV.86 Here, since Ea(λ, I) was determined by measuring catalyst surface temperature, the contribution of hot carriers could be clearly distinguished from that of photo-thermal heating. Moreover, this allowed us to predict the catalytic performance under varied conditions.

6.2. Isotope labelling experiments
Using isotope-labelled reactants to conduct catalytic experiments and analysing products via mass spectrometry is an effective approach to identify origins of products, which further implies reaction pathway.28,29,39,40,90 Hu's group first used deuterated water (D2O) and methanol (CD3OD, CH3OD, and CD3OH) to explore the pathways of photocatalytic and thermo-photo catalytic water splitting in the presence of sacrificial methanol over Rh/black TiO2 catalyst.40 It was surprisingly found that ∼60% of H2 was generated from methanol rather than water in room-temperature photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 18b), in great contrast to the “true” water splitting with ∼90% of evolved H2 originated from water in thermo-photo catalysis (Fig. 18c). This is because protons produced in methanol oxidation could be reduced to H2 by photo-generated electrons at room temperature (Fig. 18d), while at elevated temperatures, water molecules instead of protons became the dominant active species being reduced due to the phase transition of water (Fig. 18e). Furthermore, solid isotope evidence revealed that while thermo-photo catalysis led to water splitting with methanol as the sacrificial electron donor, thermal catalysis (at 260 °C) resulted in methanol decomposition (Fig. 18f).39 Besides, this methodology has also contributed to elucidating more complex reaction mechanisms such as partial oxidation of CH428,29 and C2H6.90
In addition to identifying origins of products to outline reaction pathway, analysing kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is another approach to clarify catalytic mechanism.18,240 KIE can be calculated viaeqn (12). (12)where rnormal and risotope-labelled are steady-state reaction rates with normal and isotope-labelled reactants, respectively. The electron-mediated process and thermal-energy-driven process can be distinguished as the former generally shows a higher KIE than the latter.122,125 This is ascribed to the larger acceleration and higher vibrational energy in the lighter isotope when an equivalent force is used, which contributes to a higher reaction rate.286Via comparing KIEs of thermal catalysis and thermo-photo catalysis, the role of light is implied.18,40
Other than reactants, labelling catalyst with isotopes has also been exploited, which helps to reveal the function of catalyst.30 For example, thermo-photo catalytic dry reforming of CH4 over 18O-doped Rh/SrTiO3 catalyst led to the generation of C18O. Combined with the stoichiometric ratio of produced syngas, oxygen species in catalyst was proposed to perform as the mediator to react with carbon species from partial oxidation of CH4 followed by being recovered with CO2.
6.3. Photoelectrochemical measurements
In general, photocurrents obtained from photoelectrochemical measurements at varied temperatures with and without light irradiation could imply the amounts of active charge carriers under varied test conditions, which might be well correlated to catalytic activities.114 On top of the traditional application, a new strategy has been developed to quantify the contributions of plasmon-induced temperature rise and energetic charge carriers to catalytic reactions.239 As shown in Fig. 19a, the plasmonic working electrode in a three-electrode electrochemical cell was illuminated by chopped light. The hot-carrier-induced photocurrent responded immediately upon illumination and reached the peak in several milliseconds (2 in Fig. 19b), while the thermal diffusion equilibrium with surrounding took a few seconds (3 in Fig. 19b). When light was turned off, photo-electronic current disappeared rapidly while thermal energy dissipated much more slowly (4 in Fig. 19b). Thus, as shown in Fig. 19c, the photocurrent curve could be divided into a rapid-response photo-electronic current region (0.05s) and a slow-response photo-thermal current region (10s), realizing the quantitative disentanglement of photo-electronic and photo-thermal effects.

6.4. Optically coupled scanning probe microscopy
The optically coupled scanning probe microscopy, mainly referring to Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) here, can provide valuable information for charge transfer and reaction kinetics with a high spatial resolution.98,168,262,287 The contact potential difference (CPD) between tip and sample measured by KPFM illustrates the mobility of charge carriers toward catalyst surface.98,168,202 As shown in Fig. 20a, over plasmonic catalysts, visible-near IR irradiation would cause a significant increase in CPD, while UV irradiation showed a little change compared with that in dark.168 This is because hot electrons formed under visible-near IR light could increase the number of free electrons, which led to an upward shift of Fermi level and a decreased work function. In contrast, over semiconductor catalysts, UV irradiation resulted in an obvious CPD increase while visible-near IR irradiation showed a comparable value with that in dark (Fig. 20b). This is owed to the accumulation of photo-generated holes on catalyst surface with photo-generated electrons being grounded by Pt substrate.

Besides, synchronous illumination STM has also been exploited to induce and map out surface reactions.262 As shown in Fig. 20c, the Ag tip could create localized plasmons under illumination, which drove the reaction. As-generated products were then analysed via topographic STM images. More attractively, such an advanced technology enabled the accurate quantification of single-molecule reaction rate since tunnelling current (It) is highly sensitive to the distance between tip and sample (Fig. 20d). Namely, a sudden drop in the time-dependent It curve under illumination (Fig. 20e) reflected the change in d from d1 to d2 due to molecular dissociation as suggested in Fig. 20d. The dissociation rate could be further determined by the inverse of reaction time (tR in Fig. 20e).
6.5. Environmental transmission electron microscopy
The environmental transmission electron microscope (E-TEM) that allows for simultaneous optical excitation (Fig. 21a) enables real-time visualization of thermo-photo catalytic reactions and reveals the correlation of chemical activity to catalyst structure.258,288 Dionne and co-workers characterized the dehydrogenation reaction based on the phase transformation of Pd from H-rich β phase to H-poor α phase (Fig. 21b), which was accompanied with lattice constant contraction and plasmon resonance red shift captured by selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), respectively.258,288 As a result, light irradiation was found to enhance the reaction rate by 10 times, enable reaction nucleation at the edges rather than corners of Pd nanocubes, and open a new reaction pathway.258 Furthermore, in a more recent work on crossed-bar Au–Pd antenna–reactor system (Fig. 21c), light irradiation was found to endow new catalytic sites on the flat middle faces of Pd nanorod besides its sharp tips.288

6.6. 
          In situ infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy

In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) is a widely applied technology to identify reaction intermediates based on molecular vibrations.124,132,210,289 Typically, the in situ DRIFTS spectra of thermal catalysis and thermo-photo catalysis are comparatively analysed to depict the distinct reaction pathways. On top of traditional in situ DRIFTS, a new technique coupling steady-state isotopic kinetic analysis (SSITKA) and DRIFTS was developed very recently.23 This was achieved by collecting the DRIFTS spectrum under reacting atmosphere (such as 12CO2) and then switching into an atmosphere containing isotope-labelled reactants (such as 13CO2) and collecting another DRIFTS spectrum (Fig. 22a). The vibration frequencies of isotope-labelled species are typically lower than those of unlabelled ones. SSITKA-DRIFTS spectrum was obtained by subtracting the former general spectrum from the latter isotope-labelled spectrum. Such a technique demonstrates three advantages. Firstly, the interference from adsorbed spectator species and byproducts (such as water) on catalyst surface can be excluded. Secondly, the species that is actively exchanged or converted during reaction can be easily identified. Thirdly, the photo-enhancement effect can be captured based on the clearly resolved populations of intermediate species.

Though less applied than in situ DRIFTS, operando ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to characterize the optical properties of catalyst under reaction condition.52,73 On the one hand, it allows us to determine the band gap of catalyst in real space.73 On the other hand, it helps to identify the catalytically active species as well as its behaviours under varied conditions (Fig. 16d and 16e).52
6.7. Synchronous illumination X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
Synchronous illumination X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SI-XPS) is exploited to study the separation and transfer behaviours of photo-generated charge carriers which directly affect the thermo-photo catalytic efficiency.290–292 As shown in Fig. 22b, XPS measurement under synchronous light irradiation can detect the peak shift caused by electron density change of elements in excited states. Since the valence band and conduction band of semiconductors are composed of spin orbits of various elements, charge excitation can be truly recorded in XPS spectra of multiple elements (Fig. 22c). Namely, an increased (or decreased) binding energy under illumination indicates that this element tends to lose (or accept) electrons, while unchanged binding energies for all elements reveal the rapid recombination of charge carriers.290 When light is turned off, the recombination of charge carriers occurs, so all the binding energies should shift to their original positions.
6.8. Gas-adjustable electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a robust technology to detect unpaired electrons, suggesting the existence of electrons, holes, free radicals, etc.146,273 EPR spectra collected under reactant gases can further imply the identity and role of active species.30,132 Namely, if the EPR signal for the active species diminishes upon introducing a certain gas, the active species should actively react with this gas. As shown in Fig. 22d, light irradiation in air led to the generation of paramagnetic ˙O2− (gxx = 2.002, gyy = 2.010, gzz = 2.026), while the signals for ˙O2− were considerably weakened once C3H8 was introduced. Moreover, this process was reversible with and without illumination, further confirming the key role of ˙O2− for C3H8 oxidation.132
6.9. Embedded correlated wavefunction calculations
In spite of the wide application of plane-wave density functional theory (PW-DFT) for simulating heterogeneous catalytic reactions, it cannot yield accurate excited-state potential energy surfaces for metal nanostructures, thus unable to properly explain the kinetics of thermo-photo catalytic reactions.293,294 In contrast, embedded correlated wavefunction (ECW) theory, with the recovery of interactions between cluster and its extended environment with an optimized PW-DFT level embedding potential, enables the proper treatment of local excited states, providing quantitatively reliable predictions for both ground-state and excited-state reaction kinetics.55,293–295 The accuracy of ECW theory has been evidenced in various catalytic systems by comparing with experimentally obtained reaction barriers, reaction orders, and rate-limiting steps, so it is considered as the most robust calculation method for treating highly correlated local electronic structures by far.294,295
7. Applications of thermo-photo catalysis
Thermo-photo catalysis has been applied in a wide range of chemical processes with excellent catalytic efficiencies, such as CO2 reduction, CH4 oxidation, CO conversion, H2 production, N2 fixation, pollutant degradation, and organic synthesis (Table 1). Here, instead of presenting the details of each catalytic process, we will make a brief discussion on these processes from a big picture and show some representative works.
7.1. CO2 reduction
The reduction of the greenhouse gas CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels such as CO, CH4, and CH3OH has been considered as one of the most attractive strategies for sustainable development.63,194 Due to the high energy of CO bonds (750 kJ mol−1), thermal catalytic CO2 reduction suffers from high energy cost (up to ∼1000 °C) and uncontrollable product selectivity, while photocatalytic CO2 reduction typically shows low conversions.11,57 In recent years, thermo-photo catalysis has emerged as an effective solution for efficient CO2 reduction with H2,22,100,107,296 H2O,26,112,297 or CH4.30,32,33 These reactions are also known as CO2 hydrogenation, artificial photosynthesis, and CO2 reforming, respectively. Taking CO2 hydrogenation as an example, a high CH4 yield of 20 mmol h−1 g−1 was acquired over Ru/black TiO2 catalyst at 200 °C under simulated sunlight irradiation at only 100 mW cm−2, which is several times larger than those obtained from individual thermal catalysis and photocatalysis.22 Furthermore, photo-activation of formate adsorbate (HCO2*) was demonstrated to contribute to an eight-fold enhancement in CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 over NiOx/La2O3@TiO2 catalyst at 200 °C and 390 mW cm−2 illumination.23
7.2. CH4 oxidation
CH4 is another primary greenhouse gas and also the main constituent of natural gas with an ultra-high chemical stability due to its tetrahedral structure and strong C–H bonds (439 kJ mol−1).63 The activation and conversion of CH4 into H2, CO, C2+ hydrocarbons, high-value oxygenates, etc., are highly desired but remain as a huge challenge. While, thermo-photo catalysis, which can not only overcome the high dissociation barrier of CH4 in traditional thermal catalysis but also increase the low activity in photocatalysis, has been demonstrated efficient for steam reforming of CH4,27,122 (oxidative) coupling of CH4,31 partial oxidation of CH4,28,29,95 and dry reforming of CH4,30,32,33 under mild conditions. Among these reactions, thermo-photo catalytic partial oxidation of CH4 into high-value oxygenates such as CH3OH and HCOOH is booming very recently, in which the photo-induced reactive oxygen species such as ˙OH and ˙O2− play a crucial role for oxidation while thermal energy helps to activate reactants and promotes the desorption of oxygenates to regenerate active sites.28,29,95,298 Representatively, visible-light driven thermo-photo catalytic partial oxidation of CH4 over Pt/WO3 catalyst at 150 °C led to an enhancement in CH4 conversion by 4.6 and 14.7 times with regards to photocatalysis and thermal catalysis, respectively.28
7.3. CO conversion
Besides CO2 and CH4, CO is also an important C1 molecule, whose conversion has been greatly enhanced by coupling thermal catalysis and photocatalysis.141 Current applications of thermo-photo catalytic CO conversion range from CO oxidation by O2,36,129,130 H2O,35,299 or NO,134–136 to Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.34,37,38,300,301 Thermo-photo catalytic CO oxidation by O2 is developed to treat low-concentration CO in buildings and in H2 streams for fuel cells, while CO oxidation by NO to form non-toxic CO2 and N2 realizes the concurrent removal of two primary pollutants from vehicles and stationary power plants.141 Moreover, CO oxidation by H2O, which is also named water–gas shift reaction, provides a sustainable approach for simultaneous CO removal and H2 production.35,299 For instance, under focused sunlight irradiation, CuOx/Al2O3 catalyst delivered an excellent thermo-photo catalytic activity with 95% CO conversion and 439 mmol h−1 g−1 H2 production, owing to the synergetic photo-thermal catalysis and photocatalysis.35 Furthermore, thermo-photo catalytic Fischer–Tropsch synthesis from CO and H2 is even more intriguing toward efficient production of alkanes,38,300 alkenes,37,38,300,301 and oxygenates,34 with controllable selectivities. While, most of these Fischer–Tropsch processes relied on photo-thermal effect and showed similar CO conversion and product distribution to those in dark reaction at the same temperature.37,38,301
7.4. H2 production
H2, with a high heating value of 286 kJ mol−1, holds a great promise as the alternative to fossil fuels.87 On top of above-mentioned dry/steam reforming of CH4 and water–gas shift reaction, water splitting is believed as the cleanest route for H2 production. However, photocatalytic water splitting shows a poor visible light utilization and a low energy conversion efficiency far below the industrial requirement (10%).39,87 In 2015, Hu and co-workers designed and demonstrated a thermo-photo co-catalytic process which could overcome these obstacles with a high H2 evolution rate of 688 mmol h−1 g−1 over Pt/black TiO2 catalyst at 280 °C under simulated sunlight irradiation.21 Afterwards, a number of efforts have been made to broaden the range of catalysts applied for H2 production from water.39,40,62,64,96,145,302 In addition, H2 may also be produced via thermo-photo catalytic NH3 decomposition86 and thermo-photo catalytic NH3BH3 dehydrogenation.259,303 The dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 is highlighted owing to its high gravimetric H2 capacity (1 NH3BH3 → 3 H2). Under concentrated sunlight irradiation (1000 mW cm−2), the H2 evolution rate from NH3BH3 dehydrogenation over Pt/TiN catalyst was enhanced by 11 times with a turnover frequency of 346 mol H2 mol−1 Pt min−1 due to the synergetic effects of collective heating and plasmonic hot electrons.259
7.5. N2 fixation
N2 fixation is another important application of thermo-photo catalysis, which can be conducted under mild conditions, in contrast to traditional operations at high temperatures (300–500 °C) and pressures (150–250 bar) due to the rate-limiting N2 activation caused by the huge NN bond energy (945 kJ mol−1).204 In most cases, N2 is fixed with H2 as the well-known Haber–Bosch reaction,43,44,204 while N2 fixation with H2O has also been reported.45,46 The traditional N2 fixation suffers a conflict between the reaction rate and NH3 yield because a high temperature leads to a high reaction rate but causes the decomposition of NH3. While, as discussed in Section 5.1, the controllable temperature gradient in thermo-photo catalysis that provides both hot zones and cold zones allows the realization of high reaction rate and high NH3 yield in the meantime (Fig. 12b).43,44 The utilization of H2O to fix N2 is more promising due to the reduced energy consumption and carbon emission.46 Representatively, a thermo-photo catalytic process over Fe/MoS2 catalyst demonstrated an impressive NH3 yield of 2.1 mmol h−1 g−1 at 270 °C under visible light irradiation, in great contrast to the negligible yields in individual thermal catalytic and photocatalytic processes (Fig. 9b).46
7.6. Pollutant degradation
Thermo-photo catalysis has also been applied in environmental remediation as a sustainably efficient technology to degrade organic pollutants, including VOCs in air and aqueous pollutants in water.50,281 The earliest work on thermo-photo catalytic VOC decomposition might be dated back to 2010 when Li and co-workers coated TiO2 catalyst onto the UV lamp surface for simultaneous supplies of thermal and photo energies, realizing a much higher removal efficiency of benzene (100%) than those of thermal catalysis (16%) and photocatalysis (48%).49 Other VOCs having been decomposed via thermo-photo catalysis include formaldehyde,47 ethyl acetate,131 isopropanol,167n-hexane,94 cyclohexane,94 toluene,47,48,283 xylene,47,48 styrene,94etc. For these gas pollutants, thermo-photo catalysis generally demonstrates a much more efficient mineralization toward CO2 than individual thermal catalysis and photocatalysis. Besides, thermo-photo catalytic degradation of aqueous pollutants such as methyl blue,50,51 methyl orange,304 rhodamine B,305 4-nitrophenol,306,307 tetracycline,308 oxytetracycline,309 and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride,310 has been reported with high degradation efficiencies mainly attributed to the promoted photocatalysis by thermal energy. As an example, visible-light driven thermo-photo catalytic degradation of methyl blue over Mn3O4/MnCO3 catalyst at 80 °C showed a high degradation efficiency of 89% in contrast to 5% in thermal catalysis and 16% in photocatalysis.51
7.7. Organic synthesis
Besides above applications in energy and environment, thermo-photo catalysis has also been utilized for organic synthesis. Most of organic reactions are basically thermal catalytic processes affected by reaction temperature, in which light irradiation plays some auxiliary roles.311 The superiority of thermo-photo catalysis has been demonstrated in ethylene epoxidation,18,52 Suzuki coupling,53,54 alkyne hydroamination,56 hydrodefluorination,55 cyclocondensation,312etc. For instance, plasmon-driven Suzuki coupling reaction between bromobenzene and m-tolylboronic acid over Au–Pd catalyst was reported with joint contributions by hot carriers and photo-to-thermal conversion, giving a high yield of 99% under 809 nm laser illumination in just one hour, much larger than that of 55% in thermal catalysis at the same temperature (62 °C).53 The introduced photo energy not only enhances the yield in a short period but also allows the selectivity control toward desirable products.53,54,56,262,265 The selectivity control by light irradiation has been evidenced in alkyne hydroamination toward imine over Au–Co/ZrO2 catalyst56 and ethylene epoxidation over metallic Cu52 as discussed in Sections 5.4 and 5.6, respectively.
8. Energy management for scaling up thermo-photo catalytic processes
Currently, most of thermo-photo catalytic processes are still at the laboratory stage on relatively small scales except for a few processes such as pollutant degradation and dry reforming of CH4.313 Even so, since the ultimate goal of academic studies is to move toward industrial application, here we propose some important considerations for scaling up thermo-photo catalytic processes, including (1) solar energy utilization, (2) thermal energy supply, (3) energy conversion efficiency, (4) scalable production of equipment, (5) cost effectiveness, (6) system life span, and (7) carbon tax. Moreover, some non-technical factors such as supply chain partnership, labour force optimization, consumer behaviour, and public policy, are also important for commercial adoption.314 Due to the close relationship between thermo-photo catalytic system and traditional thermal catalytic system, the scale-up technologies for thermal catalytic processes can be used for reference. The major difference between them is the incorporation of light, so in this section we will place an emphasis on energy management in thermo-photo catalytic processes.
8.1. Solar energy utilization
Although photo energy is generally provided by lamps at laboratory stage, the direct utilization of sunlight is expected for scalable application. However, the number of hours in a day during which natural sunlight can be utilized to drive reactions is limited and highly dependent on weather. Besides, solar azimuth and elevation angles are varying all the time, while the maximum light absorption is achieved only at perpendicular incidence.186 Moreover, the intensity of natural sunlight (∼100 mW cm−2) is much lower than those employed in laboratories (up to 20000 mW cm−2).23,25,31,32,86 This reveals the urgency of boosting solar energy collection and utilization.
Concentrators can be used to collect solar energy and increase light intensity.74,192,193 The concentration ratios of up-to-date concentrators range from 30–100 for parabolic trough concentrators to 5000–10000 corresponding to double-concentration systems.192 Among these, parabolic trough concentrator (Fig. 6c) is considered as the most competitive one for scalable application of thermo-photo catalysis due to its easy construction as well as the high flexibility to expand light absorption area and thus the scale of systems.180,193,313,315
Moreover, the development of omnidirectional reactors or substrates can enhance the utilization of solar energy by addressing the issue of changing solar azimuth and elevation angles.112 Omnidirectional reactors or substrates generally exhibit a 3D spherical geometry, which not only guarantees solar absorption with one light-facing hemisphere but also keeps the other hemisphere to acquire energy from warmer environment by thermal convection and radiation (Fig. 5f). This outperforms the widely applied mechanical tracking infrastructures which require both high capital investment and large energy consumption to achieve accurate and continuous angle manipulation.316
Furthermore, since the continuous direct utilization of sunlight throughout a day for thermo-photo catalysis is impossible, the conversion of solar energy into electric energy in the daytime which is then used to power the lamp to provide illumination at night can be applied. The solar-to-electricity conversion can be achieved via three main technologies including thermal, photovoltaic, and hybrid thermal photovoltaic, all of which have been well established and can be directly employed.317,318
8.2. Thermal energy supply
Thermal energy is typically supplied by electric furnaces, leading to a considerable energy consumption. Using renewable photo energy to supply both photons and required heat is considered as an effective solution. Photo-thermal effect has been widely applied for catalysts and substrates which results in local heating,34,109,163 while the recent development of “solar furnaces” enables the global heating just as electric furnaces do.42,46 In solar furnaces, highly concentrated solar radiation can heat the light-absorption reactor, which leads to a high temperature up to 2300 °C, thus showing a great promise for scalable application of solar-driven thermo-photo catalysis.319 Distinctively, aiming at directly utilizing weak sunlight, IR light absorber may be coated on the reactor to avoid IR radiation and thus heat dissipation.320
Except utilizing solar power, coupling an endothermic process with an exothermic process can be an alternative solution, where the heat required for endothermic process can be provided by heat released in exothermic process. Water splitting is a representative endothermic reaction for H2 production, which can be coupled with exothermic processes for H2 utilization.42 Coupling water splitting with N2 fixation enables the transition from current natural-gas-based Haber–Bosch process to a carbon-free and energy-efficient practice for NH3 synthesis. Furthermore, combining water spitting and CO2 methanation sparks a novel carbon-recycle technology for energy and environment.42
9. Conclusions and outlook
In conclusion, the synergetic effects of thermal and photo energies render thermo-photo catalysis efficient to promote activity, control selectivity, and enhance stability of catalysts in a wide range of chemical processes under mild conditions. On the one hand, thermal energy promotes photocatalysis by (1) enhancing the kinetic driving force of reactants, (2) tuning the redox potentials of semi-reactions, (3) facilitating the migration of charge carriers, (4) accelerating mass transfer, (5) promoting the dissociation of reactants, and (6) adjusting catalyst structure. On the other hand, photo energy accelerates thermal catalysis via (1) elevating temperature, (2) forming photo carriers, (3) generating hot carriers, (4) directly exciting adsorbates or adsorbate-catalyst bonds, (5) dynamically controlling elementary step energetics, and (6) modifying active sites. These synergetic effects perform as a valuable guideline for designing, applying, and scaling up thermo-photo catalytic processes, in which the efficient energy conversion and mass transfer should always be primary considerations.
In spite of the exciting progress in last few years, there remains seven challenges and concerns that deserve more attention in future research. Firstly, it is hard to accurately measure catalyst temperature under light irradiation, which might be resulted by non-uniform illumination, emissivity of catalysts, placement of thermocouples, limited resolution of temperature detectors, etc.219,313 Without accurate temperature, one cannot discriminate photo-thermal and photo-electronic (via photo carriers or hot carriers) contributions in thermo-photo catalysis because photo-thermal contribution is derived from a control experiment at the “same” temperature in dark. While, typically, the “same” temperature is reached under external global heating, which is different from photo-thermal heating that exhibits a localized inhomogeneous temperature distribution. Namely, based on current techniques, we can hardly quantify the photo-thermal and photo-electronic contributions. This inspires the exploration of direct temperature measurement technologies at active sites.321–323 It is also an opportunity since a precise thermal definition would allow the utilization of temperature gradients to achieve high reaction rate and high yield of unstable products in the meantime.43,44
Secondly, so far, with most research attention paid to catalyst design and the resulting catalytic performance, the underlying reaction pathway and synergetic effects of thermal and photo energies in thermo-photo catalysis remain confusing. In many works, the mechanism was not discussed or was briefly mentioned without solid evidence, which severely limits subsequent improvement and development. Therefore, it is highly expected that every publication regarding thermo-photo catalysis can provide the answer to the question “Why does thermo-photo catalysis outperform individual thermal catalysis and photocatalysis?” for the specific case with strong experimental and/or theoretical evidence.
Thirdly, energy conversion efficiency should be further improved to push the industrialization process forward, especially for thermo-photo catalytic CO2 reduction.11,63 It is worth noting that energy conversion efficiency is calculated based on Gibbs free energy change of reaction rather than enthalpy change as used in some reports. To promote energy conversion, the catalyst should demonstrate a strong light absorption across entire solar irradiation spectrum. Moreover, an efficient thermal transfer inside reactor and an excellent thermal insulation against outer environment should be ensured. It is also suggested that future works can present the power consumption in thermo-photo catalysis and compare it with that in thermal catalysis at the same productivity.34,73
Fourthly, the investigation in long-term stability of catalysts under thermo-photo catalytic conditions is lacking. Currently, most stability tests are carried out within several hours, which cannot prove the robustness of catalysts and is not sufficient for scale-up toward practical application. Moreover, the spent catalysts are poorly characterized, so the recyclability of catalysts cannot be evaluated. Therefore, long-term test for hundreds of hours and comprehensive characterizations of the catalysts after test are desired in the forthcoming work. Besides, the development of in situ synchronous illumination characterization technologies should be boosted to reveal the structural change of catalysts in real time which allows a thorough analysis of the relationship among catalyst structure, chemical activity, and reaction pathway.
Fifthly, although the use of noble-metal-based catalysts contributes to excellent thermo-photo catalytic performance, their high cost and scarcity hamper their industrial application. The exploitation of low-cost naturally-abundant catalysts (such as Fe-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, and Al-based catalysts) that can replace noble metals to serve as light absorber, electron trapper, and/or molecular adsorber, is a matter of urgency. In addition to widely employed metal and metal oxide catalysts, carbides, nitrides, chalcogenides, and pnictogenides might be promising alternatives for thermo-photo catalysis owing to their broad light absorption.37,169,289,324,325
Sixthly, the transient behaviours of catalysts and reactants upon introducing or removing light irradiation are less investigated. One of the advantages of thermo-photo catalysis is the instantaneous control of reactions that cannot be achieved in traditional thermal catalysis. After identifying light-induced transient behaviours, novel thermo-photo catalytic processes under controlled periodic illumination can be designed, which can realize the dynamic control of elementary step energetics on catalyst surface for improved catalytic activity and selectivity.126,269
Last but not the least, the standardized experimental design and data presentation are lacking. Setting standards not only benefits the reproduction of reported experimental results but also contributes to a fair comparison among the catalytic performances from different laboratories. Currently, thermo-photo catalytic efficiencies are reported in a variety of ways, while it is recommended to be presented in the unit of μmol h−1 gcat−1 or mmol h−1 gcat−1 with light intensity for rational comparison.
Although thermo-photo catalysis is currently at the laboratory stage, its bright future for practical application is ahead with a clear mechanism understanding and an elaborate system design. Furthermore, this review which focuses on the synergetic roles of thermal and photo energies in catalysis should inspire more efforts into other synergetic catalytic processes in the presence of two or more energies such as thermal, photo, electric, magnetic, ultrasonic, microwave, and mechanical energies.
