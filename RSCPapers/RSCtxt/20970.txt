    , Accepted 2nd March 2017First published on 2nd March 2017AbstractSr2ScF7:Ln3+ (Ln = Ce, Tb, Eu, Sm, Dy, Er, Tm, Ho and Yb) nanocrystals were firstly synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal route without employing any surfactants. The shape and size of the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals could be readily tuned from nanorods with 120 nm length and 50 nm width to nanoparticles with a uniform diameter of 15 nm by doping 30% Ln3+ with a larger ionic radius. Furthermore, the influence of pH values, F− sources and different surfactants on the sizes and morphologies (including nanorods, quadrangular microplates, cubes and polyhedrons) of the as-prepared products was systematically investigated and the possible formation mechanism for the products has been proposed. The XRD, SEM, EDS, PL analysis and decay lifetimes were used to characterize the products. For DC photoluminescence, the Sr2ScF7:Ln3+ nanocrystals show the characteristic f–f transitions with emission colors of bluish violet (Ce3+, Tm3+), green (Tb3+, Er3+, Ho3+), blue (Dy3+) and orange (Eu3+, Sm3+) respectively. Under single wavelength 980 nm excitation, the blue UC emissions of Sr2ScF7:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals at 474 nm due to the 1G4 → 3H6 transition of Tm3+, the green UC emissions of Sr2ScF7:Er3+ nanocrystals at 522/544 nm assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions and the red UC emissions of Sr2ScF7:Yb3+,Er3+ at 660 nm from 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ were observed. Based on the generation of red, green, and blue emissions, the Sr2ScF7:Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals could produce multicolor, particularly in the white region (0.320, 0.330) by controlling the doping concentration of Tm3+ in the Sr2ScF7:Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals. Controlling the doping concentration of Tm3+ is an effective way of modulating the luminescence properties of Sr2ScF7:Ln3+ by controlling its size and morphology. The as-synthesized phosphors might be potentially applied in the fields of color displays, light, photonics and biological imaging.
Introduction
On account of the wide range of applications in fluorescent probes, white light emitting diodes (WLEDs), solid state lasers, solar cells and many other areas,1–4 inorganic materials based on rare earth (RE) ions including oxides, fluorides, molybdates and vanadates have attracted a lot of attention.5–8 Among these inorganic materials, RE-based fluorides represent a promising fluorescent host matrix because of the merits of the relatively low lattice phonon energy, high chemical stability and long-lived luminescence.6,9–12 Therefore, much effort has recently been put into the synthesis of both Y3+- and Ln3+ (La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+, Yb3+, and Lu3+)-based fluorides with controlled crystalline phases, shapes and sizes.12–16 However, Sc3+-based fluorides as the phosphor matrix have largely been neglected.17–27 Scandium, as a rare-earth element, is found at the very top of group IIIB in the periodic table and sits at the very beginning of the transition-metal series. In comparison with the optical properties of Y3+/Ln3+-based fluorides, Sc3+-based fluorides have superior chemical and optical properties due to their distinct atomic electron configuration and much smaller ion radius.17 As we all know, the UC emission characteristic is mainly dependent on the crystal field and the RE3+–RE3+ distance in the host lattices. Sc3+-based fluorides have more excellent UC luminescence properties than Y3+/Ln3+-based fluorides due to a much shorter Sc3+–Sc3+ distance in Sc3+-based fluorides compared to that in Y3+/Ln3+-based fluorides. So, Sc3+-based fluorides produce closer Er3+–Yb3+ cation pairs, which are more effective for energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ and advantageous for the upconversion red emission of Er3+ ions.17,28 Recently, Yu's group reported that Sc3+ is doped in NaYF4 to improve the UC luminescence intensity28 and Huang's group demonstrated that Sc3+-based fluorides exhibit strong emission with a large red to green ratio when codoped with Yb3+/Er.17 In the family of Sc3+-based fluorides, except for the report of NaxScF3+x, M2NaScF6 (M = K, Rb, Cs), NaScF4, Na3ScF6, KSc2F7 and K2NaScF6,17–27 studies of the synthesis and up/down-conversion (UC/DC) luminescence properties (especially UC white light) of Sr2ScF7 have not been reported to date.
Up to now, RE-based fluorides with a controlled phase, morphology and chemical composition have been prepared through several approaches.29–32 Among these methods, thermal decomposition, high temperature coprecipitation and hydro(solvo)-thermal synthesis are nowadays the three most common routes.12 LaF3, LiYF4, NaYF4, NaGdF4, NaLuF4, BaYF5 and NaxScF3+x have been fabricated by thermal decomposition.17,33–38 Although high-quality RE-based fluorides can be realized using the method, it requires very toxic fluorinated and oxy-fluorinated carbon species, which always raises some safety concerns.12,17,18 Compared to a thermal decomposition method, high-temperature coprecipitation is favorable for the synthesis of fluorides such as LiYF4, NaYF4, NaGdF4, NaTbF4, NaLuF4, KGdF4 and NaScF4.39–42 But, it has some drawbacks including complicated experimental conditions, tedious procedures and high reaction temperatures.12 As a result, hydro(solvo)-thermal synthesis is more suitable for the preparation of highly crystalline fluoride nanomaterials under relatively mild conditions.12,22 For all we know, organic additives/surfactants play a critical role in a typical hydro(solvo)-thermal synthesis procedure to modify the crystallographic phase, size and morphology of the nanomaterials.43–46 However, the complete removal of residual organic additives/surfactants was very difficult by rinsing or post-calcination. For phosphors, they would further act as luminescence quenching centers and thus reduce the phosphors' luminescence properties.47 For nanomaterials, their low solubility in aqueous solution leads to poor applications in the biological field. Moreover, some are even toxic.47,48 To our knowledge, a simplified method is important for the synthesis of luminescent materials, such as lanthanide luminescent nanoparticles29,32 and films.49 Thus, it is of significant importance to find a new way to simplify the synthetic process of RE-based fluorides. In comparison with previous reports on RE-based fluorides, we develop a novel one-step route without any surfactant for the preparation of Sr2ScF7 with diverse tunable shapes, simultaneously, this method has some advantages of low cost, environmental friendliness, safety and potential for large-scale production.
At present, Ln3+-doping is one of the most effective approaches to alter the crystallographic phase, size, morphology and electronic configuration of the nanomaterials.23,50–53 Liu and co-workers reported the conversion of NaYF4 nanomaterials by a novel Gd3+-doping approach.53 Zhu and co-workers reported a novel route by doping rare-earth ions (RE3+) with large ionic radii (such as La3+, Ce3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Yb3+ and Lu3+) for the aspect ratio modification of KSc2F7 nanocrystals (NCs).23 Furthermore, Ln3+-doped fluoride nanocrystals have aroused fast growing interest on the basis of their superior physicochemical features such as low toxicity, large antenna-generated Stokes and/or anti-Stokes shifts, high resistance to photobleaching and narrow emission bands as compared to conventional molecular probes like organic dyes.12–17 So, these materials can be applied for diagnostics, biological assays and medical imaging.54–58 Yb3+ ions have a much larger NIR (980 nm) absorption cross-section which are often co-doped as excellent sensitizers along with Er3+ and Ho3+ to yield strong red and green UC emissions, or together with Tm3+ for blue UC emissions. On the other hand, it is well-known that UC white light has a wide range of applications in displays and backlights, and is an alternative to general lighting because it is compact, power-rich, inexpensive and can also be obtained easily commercially. By doping Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions into host materials, a combination of RGB emissions can be obtained in a single inorganic phosphor, which is one of the most effective methods for achieving UC white light.59–62 However, there have been no reports on white UC light in Ln3+-doped Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals to date.
Herein, we first report the controlled synthesis of Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals by a novel Ln3+-doping hydrothermal method without any surfactants. Meantime, the morphologies (nanorods, quadrangular microplates, cubes and polygons) and sizes of the Sr2ScF7 nano/microcrystals could be easily adjusted by changing the F− sources and pH values. Meanwhile, an additional surfactant also has a significant impact on the morphology and size of the products. A possible mechanism for the formation of Sr2ScF7 nano/microcrystals was proposed. The results indicate that Ln3+-doped Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals can exhibit multicolor and controllable DC/UC emissions. Moreover, under 980 nm excitation, bright UC white light is obtained first in the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals by adjusting the tri-doped concentration of Yb3+/Er3+/Tm3+. Furthermore, we study the effect of the size/morphology on the luminescence properties.
Experimental section
Materials
RE2O3 (RE = Sc, Yb, Er, Tm, Ho, Eu, Sm, La, Lu and Dy) (99.99%), CeO2 (99.99%) and Tb4O7 (99.99%) were acquired from Goring High-tech Material Corporation Limited. Strontium chloride (SrCl2·6H2O), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), potassium fluoride (KF), sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4), trisodium citrate dehydrate (Ci3+), hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O), and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (China) and used without further purification. RE2Cl3 (RE = Sc, Yb, Er, Tm, Ho, Ce, Eu, Tb, Sm, La, Lu and Dy) were prepared by dissolving the corresponding rare earth oxides in dilute HCl and then evaporating the excess HCl.
Synthesis
In a typical synthesis process of the Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ nanocrystals, 2 mmol SrCl2, 1 mmol ScCl3, a certain amount of YbCl3 and ErCl3 were dissolved in 30 ml deionized water to form a transparent solution under strong magnetic stirring at room temperature for 15 minutes. Subsequently, 8 mmol NH4F was added dropwise into the above solution under vigorous stirring, and a white colloidal solution was formed. Then, the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 7 by adding NH3·H2O solution drop by drop. After additional agitation for 30 min, the obtained white colloidal solution was transferred into a 50 ml polytetrafluoroethylene autoclave (filled up to 80% of its total volume) which was sealed and maintained at 220 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the final samples were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and dried in air at 60 °C. Meantime, the synthesis of the other Sr2ScF7 nano/microcrystals was similar to the above procedure.
Characterization
The crystal structures and phase purities were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) performed on a Purkinje General Instrument MSALXD3 using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) at a scanning rate of 10° min−1 in the 2θ range from 23° to 60°, 20 mA, 36 kV. The morphology and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) spectrum of the samples were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, XL30, Philips) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The DC fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The UC fluorescence spectra were obtained using a 980 nm laser with MDL-N-980-8W as the excitation source and detected using a LS 55 (PerkinElmer) from 400 to 750 nm. The decay lifetimes were measured using FLS980 (Edinburgh Instrument). All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Structure and phase
Sr2ScF7 has been found to be in the pure monoclinic phase with space group P21/c (#14) (a = 5.450 Å, b = 12.190 Å, c = 8.236 Å and Z = 4). The detailed crystallographic data and structural parameters of the Sr2ScF7 crystals are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The structure of the Sr2ScF7 crystals and the sites of Sr2+ and Sc3+ polyhedrons are presented in Fig. 1A. The Sr2+ cation occupies a 9-coordination environment, and nine coordinated fluorine atoms surround it to form a single capped-square antiprism. Each Sc3+ cation is coordinated by its nearest seven fluorine atoms to form an irregular enneahedron in which the Sc3+ crystallographic sites can serve as symcenters for dopant ions (Ln3+). 7-fold Sc3+ and 9-fold Sr2+ join by sharing edges and vertices, respectively. Sc3+ were commonly considered to be replaced by Ln3+ based on their similar valence and ionic radii (Sc3+: CN = 7, r = 0.87 Å); Ln3+, (Ln = Lu, Yb, Tm, Dy, Tb, Eu, Sm, La; CN = 7, r = 0.92–1.1 Å). The EDS in Fig. 1B suggests that the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals synthesized by a hydrothermal method without any surfactant consists of only Sr, Sc and F elements with the corresponding ratio of 2.1:1:6.9, which is very close to the stoichiometric value.

Fig. 1C shows the XRD patterns of pure Sr2ScF7 and Sr2ScF7:30%Ln3+. All the diffraction peaks can be assigned to a pure monoclinic Sr2ScF7 phase, which coincides well with the Standards Card (JCPDS no. 28-1251). No extra diffraction peaks are observed, indicating that the high purity and crystallinity of the products are obtained and Ln3+ (Ln = Lu, Yb, Tm, Dy, Tb, Eu, Sm, La) are completely dissolved in the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals. The XRD peaks obviously shift toward a low 2θ direction with a larger ionic radius of the doping Ln3+ (r = 0.92–1.1 Å) compared to that of Sc3+ (r = 0.87 Å) owing to lattice expansion.22,63 It is worth noting that the addition of Ln3+ into Sr2ScF7 causes some differences in diffraction peaks of (121), (130), (240) and (162) because of the doping of Ln3+ with a larger ionic radius. Upon increasing the Ln3+ radius from 0.92 Å to 1.1 Å, the peak intensity of (130) becomes stronger than that of (121), which suggests the preferential orientation growth along the (130) direction to some degree. Interestingly, it is also observed that the diffraction peaks of (240) and (162) tend to be broadened upon increasing the radius of Ln3+, suggesting that the larger-sized dopants are preferred to form smaller nanocrystals.12
Morphology
More importantly, Ln3+ doping with a larger radius not only affects the diffraction peaks of the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals, but also plays an important role in their morphology. The SEM images of the undoped and doped with 30% Ln3+ (Ln = Lu, Yb, Tm, Dy, Tb, Eu, Sm and La) Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the SEM results, Table S2 (ESI†) shows the effect of the Ln3+ doping on the length and width of the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals. Without deliberately adding Ln3+, the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals are relatively uniform and monodisperse nanorods with 120 nm in length and 50 nm in width as shown in the SEM image (Fig. 2A). However, in the presence of 30% Ln3+ dopant ions, the size and shape of the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals are remarkably modified. As shown in Fig. 2B, the Lu3+-doped Sr2ScF7 product is still composed of monodisperse nanorods but with a decrease in size (80 nm in length and 40 nm in width). When lanthanide dopants from Lu3+ to La3+ with the radius from 0.92 Å to 1.1 Å were introduced into the crystal lattice of the Sr2ScF7 crystals, the morphology of the product is obviously changed and composed of spherically shaped nanoparticles with a uniform diameter (from 50 nm to 15 nm). As a result, the size of the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals decreases monotonously with increasing Ln3+ ionic radius, which is also in agreement with the results obtained from the XRD analysis shown in Fig. 1C. The size evolution of the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals can be partly attributed to the fact that the dopants with a larger ionic radius could decelerate the anisotropic crystalline growth. In the case of substitution of Sc3+ by Ln3+ with a larger radius, the electron charge density on the surface of the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals increases. The change in electron charge density on the surface of nanocrystals can substantially slow the diffusion of negatively charged F− ions to the surface because of an increase in charge repulsion, which results in a tunable reduction of the Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals.12,13,63–65

It was found that the pH values and F− sources of the initial reaction solutions have a large impact on the morphologies and sizes of the Sr2ScF7 crystals. The SEM images of the Sr2ScF7 crystals (S1–S3) prepared at different pH with NH4F as the F− source are shown in Fig. 3A–C. It is obvious that the nanorods obtained at pH = 2 with an average size of 90 nm in length are smaller than that obtained at pH = 7 (110 nm in length). Upon further increasing the pH to 10 (S3), the morphology and size of the products vary greatly as shown in Fig. 3C. The product is composed of an irregular polyhedron with a diameter of 18 µm and some nanorods are present on its surface. If NH4F was replaced by NaF as the F− source, the SEM images of the as-prepared products (S4–S6) at different pH values (2, 7, 10) are shown in Fig. 3D–F. As can be seen, all the products consist of a large amount of nanorods whereas the length of the products increases remarkably from 120 nm to 1.5 µm and the width increases from 40 nm to 80 nm. Fig. 3G–I illustrate the SEM images of the Sr2ScF7 crystals obtained at different pH with NaBF4 as the F− source. When the starting pH = 2 (S7), uniform, homogeneous and well-shaped cubes with sizes of about 1 µm were formed, as displayed in Fig. 3G. It is noteworthy that there is a hole in the center of the cube. As the pH value increased to 7 (S8), not only cubes but also plenty of quadrangular microplates (5 µm in size) were obtained as shown in Fig. 3H. Upon further increasing the pH value to 10 (S9), the obtained products were mainly composed of anomalous polyhedrons and a small number of cubes (Fig. 3I). The main reasons for this phenomenon is that: firstly, the equilibrium between the chemical potential and the rate of ionic migration could be affected by the pH value in the initial solution,66 then the nucleation rate could be changed, usually, as the pH increases, the slower nucleation rate will result in a crystal with a large size.28 In the case of Sr2ScF7, the nucleation rate is strongly dependent on the competition of OH− and F−. With the increase of OH−, the chelation between OH− and Sc3+ (Sr2+) takes place, which will inhibit the precipitation of F− and Sc3+ (Sr2+) to some extent, thus decreasing the nucleation rate and resulting in larger crystals. Secondly, the F− source in the Sr2ScF7 system (other reaction parameters remain constant) has a great influence on the formation of different crystal structures and morphologies. In particular, when NaBF4 is used as the F− source, BF4− is slowly hydrolyzed to release BO33− and F− ions, which will affect the rate of crystal nucleation and crystal growth.67 In addition, at the early stage of the reactions, owing to the strong interactions of the cations (NH4+ and Na+) and the anions (OH−, BO33−, and F−), these cations can be selectively adsorbed on different surfaces of the initial crystal nucleus, and then influence the corresponding surface energy.68 Finally, various morphologies and sizes of the Sr2ScF7 crystals can be obtained. The formation and morphological evolution of the Sr2ScF7 crystals are controlled by varying the pH values and F− sources as illustrated in Scheme 1. In conclusion, size- and morphology-controlled Sr2ScF7 nano-/microcrystals can be effectively synthesized by a simple surfactant-free hydrothermal method.

To obtain well-defined crystals with uniform morphology for UC/DC luminescence, a series of experiments with different surfactants in the Sr2ScF7 system under the same conditions were carried out. The typical XRD patterns and SEM images of the Sr2ScF7 crystals are given in Fig. 4. As displayed in Fig. 4A, all the peaks can be ascribed to the pure monoclinic Sr2ScF7 phase (JCPDS no. 28-1251) and no diffraction peaks of any other phases are detected. It is clear that the diffraction peaks of the Sr2ScF7 crystals prepared with different surfactants from Ci3+ to SDBS become narrower and sharper, indicating the increase of the products' size. Notably, the relative peak intensity of (022) for the products with SDBS is visibly enhanced, implying that the prismatic structures of the Sr2ScF7 crystals grow preferentially along the (022) direction. As displayed in Fig. 4B, uniformly distributed Sr2ScF7 nanorods (S10) with a diameter of about 30 nm and a length of 110 nm were obtained in the presence of Ci3+. Irregular polyhedrons (S11) with sizes in the range of 3–8 µm can be observed in Fig. 4C when CTAB was used as a surfactant. Whereas, when a SDBS assisted hydrothermal process was carried out Sr2ScF7 crystals (S12) composed of numerous prismatic structures (7 µm in width, 15 µm in length) were obtained. It can be found that the size of the Sr2ScF7 crystals becomes larger along with the change in surfactants from Ci3+ to SDBS, which is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 4A). The reasons for this phenomenon are as follows: on one hand, Ci3+, CTAB and SDBS are regarded as excellent chelating agents that slow down the nucleation and subsequent further aggregation of the nanoparticles,69,70 therefore, the Sr2ScF7 crystals produced with surfactants are larger than that produced without surfactants (Fig. 1A); on the other hand, various surfactants selectively adsorb on the specific crystal facets of Sr2ScF7 owing to their different coordination modes and specific molecular complementarity, which directly affect the anisotropic growth of the crystals, resulting in the different morphologies and sizes of nano/microcrystals.71 The corresponding growth process can be explained as in Scheme 1.

Photoluminescence properties
Our experimental results and previous investigations both indicate that Sr2ScF7 is an excellent host for the luminescence of various optically active lanthanide ions just like the same type of Sr2YF7.6 Therefore, we mainly focus on the DC/UC luminescence properties of Ce, Tb, Eu, Sm, Dy, Er, Ho, Tm single-doped, Yb/Er, Yb/Tm co-doped and Yb/Er/Tm tri-doped Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals (S2).

DC photoluminescence. 
The performance of phosphors is easily influenced by the doping concentration of the luminescent center.72 With increasing concentration of doped Ln3+, the distance of the luminescent center becomes short enough to bring about concentration quenching of Ln3+. So, it is very important to find the optimum doping concentration. The results have been discussed in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
The photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra of Sr2ScF7:6%Ce3+ phosphors are shown in Fig. 5A. At 351 nm, it is observed that the excitation spectrum consists of a broad and strong band with a maximum at 294 nm and a weaker band at 259 nm, which is attributed to the split in transitions from the 2F5/2 ground state of Ce3+ to the excited Ce3+ 5d states. Upon excitation at 294 nm, the emission spectrum of Sr2ScF7:6%Ce3+ phosphors displays a palpable peak centered at 351 nm, which corresponds to the transitions from the lowest excited 5d state to the 4f ground state. The excitation and emission spectra of Sr2ScF7:12%Tb3+ phosphors are presented in Fig. 5B. The excitation spectrum of Sr2ScF7:12%Tb3+ monitored with 546 nm emission (Tb3+: 5D4 → 7F5) consists of a strong band from 200 to 400 nm with a maximum at 222 nm and a weak band at 265 nm, which correspond to the spin-allowed (7F6 → 7DJ) transition and the spin-forbidden (7F6 → 9DJ) transition of 4f8–4f75d1, respectively.67 Upon excitation into the 4f8–4f75d1 transition at 222 nm, the emission spectrum exhibits four lines centered at 489, 546, 586 and 624 nm, originating from transitions from the 5D4 excited state to the 7FJ(J=6,5,4,3) ground states of Tb3+. The most prominent emission peak which is attributed to the 5D4 → 7F5 transition of Tb3+ is located at 546 nm. Fig. 5C shows the PL excitation and emission spectra of the Sr2ScF7:9%Eu3+ phosphors. At a wavelength of 594 nm, it is observed that the excitation spectrum is composed of many sharp peaks with a band maximum at 394 nm, which are ascribed to the typical intraconfigurational f–f transitions of the Eu3+ ions. They are due to 328 nm (7F0 → 5H6), 362 nm (7F0 → 5D4), 381 nm (7F0 → 5G2), 394 nm (7F0 → 5L6) and 465 nm (7F0 → 5D2), respectively. Under 394 nm excitation, the emissions of Eu3+ are located at 565 nm (5D0 → 7F0), 594 nm (5D0 → 7F1), 619 nm (5D0 → 7F2), 650 nm (5D0 → 7F3) and 698 nm (5D0 → 7F4), respectively. The strongest emission centered at 594 nm belongs to the 5D0 → 7F1 magnetic dipole transition, suggesting that the Eu3+ ions are embedded in the symmetric environment according to the Judd–Ofelt theory.7 It is noteworthy that Sr2ScF7:1%Dy3+ phosphors show a blue luminescence (Fig. 5E). In the emission spectrum, two main peaks at 482 nm (4F9/2 → 6H15/2, magnetic dipole) in the blue region and at 577 nm (4F9/2 → 6H13/2, electric dipole) in the yellow region are observed. Among them, the 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 transition is dominant because Dy3+ is located at a symmetrical local site in the Sr2ScF7 host lattices, just like Eu3+5D0 → 7F1 in the Sr2ScF7 host (Fig. 5C). Detailed assignment of luminescence properties is listed in Table S3 (ESI†). All the doped lanthanide ions (Ln3+) show their characteristic transitions within the 4fn electron configuration in the Sr2ScF7 host lattice with emission colors of bluish violet (Ce3+, Tm3+), green (Tb3+, Er3+, Ho3+), blue (Dy3+) and orange (Eu3+, Sm3+), respectively. The corresponding CIE chromaticity diagram is presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

UC photoluminescence. 

Fig. 6A displays the UC photoluminescence emission spectra of Sr2ScF7:x%Yb3+,1%Er3+ nanocrystals with variable Yb3+ concentrations from 0 mol% to 10 mol%. It is found that the intensity of green emission (IG) decreased while the intensity of red emission (IR) enhanced with an increase of the doping concentration of Yb3+. Fig. 6B gives the intensity ratios of IG and IR to the total integrated intensity I(G+R) in the range of 400–750 nm, respectively, which intuitively reflect the change in IG and IR with the varied concentration of Yb3+ ions. Fig. 6C shows the CIE chromaticity coordinates of Sr2ScF7:x%Yb3+,1%Er3+ nanocrystals. When the Yb3+ concentration changes from 0% to 10%, the corresponding chromaticity coordinates (x, y) systematically alter from (0.290, 0.670) to (0.398, 0.377) and the corresponding color points gradually alter from green to red. A similar result is also observed for other Yb3+ and Er3+ codoped fluoride nanocrystals.6,9,73 This phenomenon is due to relatively fewer Er3+ remaining in the green-emitting levels of 2H11/2/4S3/2 and more Er3+ ions remaining in the red-emitting level of 4F9/2 (Fig. 9). On one hand, the interatomic Yb3+–Er3+ distance in the Sr2ScF7 host lattice would decrease with an increase of the concentration of Yb3+ ions, which will lead to two energy-back-transfer processes from Er3+ to Yb3+. The energy back-transfer (BET1) of 4S3/2(Er3+) + 2F7/2(Yb3+) → 4I13/2(Er3+) + 2F5/2(Yb3+) should subsequently reduce the population in excited levels of 4S3/2 (2H11/2), resulting in the decrease of green emission (2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2). At the same time, the energy transfer leads to the saturation of the 4I13/2(Er3+) state, and then the excited Yb3+ ions transfer energy to Er3+ ions through the energy transfer process 2F5/2(Yb3+) + 4I13/2(Er3+) → 2F7/2(Yb3+) + 4F9/2(Er3+), which can directly increase the number of electrons in the 4F9/2 level, resulting in the enhancement of red emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2).73 Furthermore, the photoluminescence decay curves of the Er3+4S3/2 → 4I15/2 emission level (λex = 980 nm, λem = 544 nm) were also measured to confirm the existence of BET1. Fig. 10A presents the representative decay curves of Er3+ which are all well fitted into a single exponential function as I(t) = I0exp(−t/τ) (τ is the corresponding lifetime). Clearly, when 10% Yb3+ was introduced, the lifetimes of Er3+ (544 nm) decrease from 85.7 µs to 67.9 µs, which is strong evidence for BET1 from Er3+ to Yb3+ in the Sr2ScF7 host. In addition, the energy back-transfer (BET2) process of 4F7/2(Er3+) + 2F7/2(Yb3+) → 4I11/2(Er3+) + 2F5/2(Yb3+) should suppress the number of electrons in the excited 4F7/2(Er3+) level at higher concentrations of Yb3+. This leads to a smaller population of the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 green-emitting levels and the decrease of the green emission intensity.74 On the other hand, the number of electrons in the 4F9/2 red-emitting level increases directly while the number of electrons in 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 green-emitting levels reduces indirectly by the cross relaxation (4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2) in Er3+.4 A detailed explanation is shown in Fig. 9.

Fig. 7 displays the UC photoluminescence emission spectra (400–750nm) of Sr2ScF7:Ln3+ nanocrystals under 980 nm excitation. The UC photoluminescence emission spectra of Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,2%Tm3+ (Fig. 7a) show blue emission mainly located at 474 nm which is attributed to the 1G4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions. Although a red UC photoluminescence due to the 1G4 → 3F4 transition of Tm3+ appears in the Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,2%Tm3+ nanocrystals, it is too weak to be considered in this work. Yb3+ plays an important role in the blue emission spectra of Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,2%Tm3+ nanocrystals, because we cannot detect pronounced UC blue emission in Tm3+ single doped Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals. The UC photoluminescence emission spectra of Sr2ScF7:1%Er3+ (Fig. 7b) show strong green emission at 522 nm and 544 nm which are ascribed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively, and a quite weak band at 660 nm which is assigned to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+. However, it can be observed that the UC emission color changes markedly from green to red when Yb3+ ions were codoped with Er3+ into the Sr2ScF7 host lattice. Compared to the UC photoluminescence emission spectra of Sr2ScF7:1%Er3+ nanocrystals, the UC photoluminescence emission spectra of Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ (Fig. 7c) show strong red emission at 660 nm which is attributed to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+. The chromaticity coordinates of the Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,2%Tm3+, Sr2ScF7:1%Er3+ and Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ nanocrystals are (0.13, 0.13), (0.29, 0.67) and (0.40, 0.38) respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†), which can be confirmed by the corresponding luminescence photographs under 980 nm excitation (insets in Fig. 7).

Based on the above analysis, we speculate that it is possible to produce white UC photoluminescence by adding an appropriate ratio of Yb3+/Er3+/Tm3+ into Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals. To prove our conjecture, a series of Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+,y%Tm3+ nanocrystals doped with different Tm3+ concentrations (y = 0.1–2) have been synthesized. The UC photoluminescence emission spectra of these samples are presented in Fig. 8A. It can be found that the UC photoluminescence emission spectra of Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+,y%Tm3+ nanocrystals are composed of blue emission at 474 nm due to 1G4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+, green emission at 522 nm and 544 nm arising from the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ and red emission at 660 nm originating in the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+. It is noteworthy that the shape of the UC band at 650 nm arising from the transition 1G4 → 3H4 of Tm3+ in Fig. 7a is consistent with that of Er3+ in Fig. 7c. So, the contribution of Tm3+ to the red UC photoluminescence emission band in Fig. 8A can be neglected owing to the following two reasons:74,75 one part is that the red emission band intensity in Fig. 7a is much lower than that of the blue emission band; another part is that the shape of the red band in Fig. 8A is exactly the same as that of Er3+ ions in Fig. 7c. It is also clearly observed that the blue emission is relatively enhanced upon increasing the concentration of Tm3+ from 0.1% to 2%. Additionally, in Fig. 8B, the corresponding CIE chromaticity coordinates of Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+,y%Tm3+ nanocrystals vary from the yellow region (0.365, 0.415) to the white region (0.316, 0.322) by altering the Tm3+ concentration. Furthermore, when y = 1, ideal white UC photoluminescence in Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+,1%Tm3+ nanocrystals with chromaticity coordinates of (0.320, 0.330) is obtained here for the first time and the corresponding luminescence photograph is also shown in Fig. 8A for direct comparison.

It is well known that codoping not only increases the efficiency of the PL, but also brings out UC photoluminescence between the donor and acceptor ions.74 Yb3+ was often chosen as a sensitizer in Yb3+–Er3+, Yb3+–Tm3+-codoped and Yb3+–Er3+–Tm3+ tridoped systems due to a much longer excited state lifetime and a larger absorption cross section at around 980 nm. The latter leads to energy transfer between the Yb3+ emission 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 and the Er3+ absorption 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 or the Tm3+ absorption 3H5 → 3H6.75 The energy level diagrams of the Yb3+, Er3+ and Tm3+ ions as well as the proposed UC emission processes of Er3+ and Tm3+ are illustrated in Fig. 9. Previous literature studies have reported the mechanism of the UC green emission of Er3+.73–76 The absorption transition between the ground state of 4I15/2 and the excited level 4I11/2 (GSA) of Er3+ matches well with the energy from 980 nm excitation. In the absence of Yb3+, Sr2ScF7:1%Er3+ nanocrystals emit green emission and the details are given below: firstly, under excitation at 980 nm, the photons are mostly absorbed by Er3+ from its ground state (4I15/2) to the excited energy level (4I11/2), and then, the excited electrons jump from the 4I11/2 to the 4F7/2 level (ESA). Subsequently the energy in the 4F7/2 level can transfer to 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels via nonradiative relaxation. Finally, the energy in these levels returns to the ground state, emitting the most strong green emissions at 522 nm and 544 nm of Er3+ (2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2) as well as very weak red emission at 660 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2). For red emission of the Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ nanocrystals, the mechanism of UC emission mainly comes from two sides: one main part is that the two-photon energy transfer (ET) from the excited Yb3+ to Er3+ due to a much larger absorption cross section and concentration of Yb3+ than that of Er3+; and a small part is from Er3+ ground/excited state absorption (GSA/ESA). At first, the electrons in the ground state (2F7/2) of Yb3+are excited into its 2F5/2 level by 980 nm excitation, then the energy transfers from an excited Yb3+ to Er3+(4I11/2), and a second Yb3+ ion transfers its energy again. These two steps result in electron transfer from the 4I11/2 level to a highly excited 4F7/2 state of Er3+. At last, electrons at the 4F7/2 state populate its 2H11/2/4S3/2, and 4F9/2 states via relaxation and other energy transfer processes, and then return to its 4F9/2 ground state, engendering the emissions at 660 nm corresponding to 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (most strong) and at 522/544 nm corresponding to 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (weak). The detailed explanation can be seen in the above paragraph (Fig. 6). For blue emission of the Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,2%Tm3+ nanocrystals, the UC photoluminescence of Tm3+ comes from energy transfer processes from Yb3+ to Tm3+ due to the three-photon process. The reason for this phenomenon is that Tm3+ has no ground or excited state absorption (GSA or ESA) that matches the 980 nm photon. First, under 980 nm excitation, the photons can be absorbed by 2F5/2 states in Yb3+, and then the nonresonant ET from Yb3+ to Tm3+ takes place to transfer the energy to the 3H5 level in Tm3+. And finally, the photons relax rapidly to the 3F4 level by nonradiative multiphonon decay. A second nonresonant ET from Yb3+ to Tm3+ can populate higher 3F2 and 3F3 energetic states from 3F4 of Tm3+, and subsequently relax to the 3H4 level of Tm3+ by multiphonon decay. A third ET finally populates the 1G4 level, and then the strong blue emission at 474 nm (1G4 → 3H6) and weak red emission at 650 nm (1G4 → 3F4) occur.75,76
According to previous literature,73–75,77 some other ET processes might occur between Er3+ and Tm3+ in the complex tri-doped Sr2Sc2F7 system besides the main ET processes between Yb3+ and Er3+/Tm3+. The nearly resonant cross relaxation processes of 1G4(Tm3+) + 4I15/2(Er3+) → 3F4(Tm3+) + 4F9/2(Er3+) and 3H4(Tm3+) + 4I13/2(Er3+) → 3H6(Tm3+) + 4S3/2(Er3+) are illustrated in Fig. 9. This two energy-transfer behavior in the Yb3+–Er3+–Tm3+ tridoped Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals can be confirmed by the decay curve behaviors of the 1G4 → 3H6 and 3H4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10B and Fig. S4 (ESI†). The luminescence decay curves of Tm3+ in Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Tm3+ and Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+,1%Tm3+ can be well fitted by the single exponential function I(t) = I0exp(−t/τ). Obviously, we can observe that the decay time of Tm3+ in the Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+,1%Tm3+ nanocrystals is shorter than that in Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Tm3+ nanocrystals, which is strong evidence for the ET from Tm3+ to Er3+ in the Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+,1%Tm3+ nanocrystals. In addition, the ET from Tm3+ to Er3+ is another reason why the contribution of Tm3+ ions to the red UC emission in Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+,1%Tm3+ nanocrystals (Fig. 8A) can be neglected.

Morphology/size-dependent luminescence properties
To investigate the influence of morphology/size on the luminescence properties, the photoluminescence emission spectra of the Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ (A) and Sr2ScF7:5%Eu3+ (B) samples with various morphologies are presented in Fig. 11, respectively.
 Fig. 11  The photoluminescence emission spectra of the Sr2ScF7:10%Yb3+,1%Er3+ (A) and Sr2ScF7:5%Eu3+ (B) samples with various morphologies. 
Under 980 nm laser excitation (Fig. 11A), three UC emission peaks at 522, 544 and 660 nm are assigned to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+, respectively. However, the intensity ratio of red to green emission (Rr/g) decreases as the morphologies of the samples change from nanorods (Rr/g = 5.14 for S2) to polyhedrons (Rr/g = 0.88 for S11) and further to the prismatic structures (Rr/g = 0.58 for S12). As the size of the samples increases from S2 to S12 (Fig. 3B and 4C, D), the surface-to-volume ratio of the samples decreases. Furthermore, surface defect- and ligand-induced quenching of UC luminescence becomes more important, which modifies the relative population among various excited states through phonon-assisted nonradiative relaxations.77,78 Upon excitation of Eu3+ at 394 nm (Fig. 11B), all the emission spectra (594 nm and 619 nm) of the Sr2ScF7:5%Eu3+ samples are similar in shape except for the relative intensities. Apparently, the relative emission intensity of S12 is higher than that of others (S2 and S11) due to the different morphologies/sizes. In general, the defects of crystal surfaces can lead to nonradiative recombination between electrons and holes, which will reduce the luminescence intensity.7,46,67 The surface-to-volume ratio of the samples decreases along with increase of the size, which reduces defects on their crystal surfaces. Therefore, the sample (S12, Fig. 4D) with the largest size shows high luminescence intensity. In conclusion, the control of the size/morphology of a crystal is another effective way to modulate the luminescence properties of Sr2ScF7.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized Sr2ScF7:Ln3+ (Ln = Ce, Tb, Eu, Sm, Dy, Er, Tm, Ho and Yb) nanocrystals by a one-step hydrothermal route without employing any surfactants. Doping Ln3+ with a large ionic radius was beneficial for forming ultrasmall nanoparticles, which provided a novel method for controlling the shape and size of other analogous nanocrystals. Multiform Sr2ScF7 nano-/microcrystals including nanorods, quadrangular microplates, cubes and polyhedrons were synthesized by altering the pH values, F− sources and surfactants. The possible formation mechanisms for the ultimate shape evolutions from nanorods to other morphologies (quadrangular microplates, cubes and polyhedrons) have been presented in detail. The Sr2ScF7:Ln3+ (Ln = Ce, Tb, Eu, Sm, Dy, Er, Tm and Ho) nanocrystals showed the characteristic f–f transitions of Ln3+ with emission colors of bluish violet (Ce3+, Tm3+), green (Tb3+, Er3+, Ho3+), blue (Dy3+) and orange (Eu3+, Sm3+) respectively. Under 980 nm excitation, blue, green and red UC photoluminescence was achieved in the Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm) doped Sr2ScF7 nanocrystals, which were attributed to the 1G4 → 3H6 transition of Tm3+, the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ and the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ respectively. The ideal white UC photoluminescence in the Sr2ScF7:Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals with chromaticity coordinates of (0.320, 0.330) is firstly obtained. The ET processes of Yb3+ → Er3+, Yb3+ → Tm3+ and Tm3+ → Er3+ worked simultaneously originating from two- or three-photon UC processes. The values of Rr/g and the emission intensity were sensitive to the morphology/size of Sr2ScF7, so we can modulate the luminescence properties by changing its morphology/size. Because of their simple production process, low toxicity, superior stability, small dimensions, rich luminescence color and ease of mass production, these materials can be widely applied in the areas of color displays, light, photonics and biological imaging.
