    , Accepted 10th June 2021First published on 10th June 2021AbstractIt has been a consensus that the exciton binding energies in two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites is closely correlated with the number of layers. However, the detailed recombination dynamics of excitons and free carriers in these 2D perovskites are still highly controversial. Using transient spectroscopic techniques, carrier dynamics of 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites are investigated at both room and low temperatures. We confirmed that 2D perovskites of (BA)2PbI4, with the number of [PbX6]4− layers n = 1, exhibit clearly exciton characteristic properties. Meanwhile, (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10, n = 2 and 3, exhibit free carrier behaviour, which is inconsistent with their binding energies of more than 100 meV. Such anomalous exciton and free carrier behaviours are attributed to the effective exciton in-plane transport and dissociation by the edge state. This investigation provides novel insights into exciton and charge carrier dynamics of 2D perovskites as well as the influence of edge states.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites have attracted intensive interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and have been proposed as promising semiconductor candidate materials for solar cells and light emitters.1–6 2D RP perovskites are generally described using the formula (RNH3)2An−1MnX3n+1, where RNH3 is a long chain organic ligand (i.e. phenylethylammonium (PEA), and butylammonium (BA)); A is an organic cation (i.e. methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+)); M is a divalent metal cation (i.e. Pb, Sn); X is a halide anion and n is the number of [MX6]4− inorganic layers.7 In the typical 2D RP perovskite structure, the inorganic layers were separated by the organic ligand and the adjacent perovskites slabs have half-a-unit-cell offset as shown in Fig. 1a. Compared to their 3D counterpart, 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites exhibit higher stability and a more tunable electronic structure. The long and hydrophobic alkyl chains of the organic ligands protect the inorganic layers from moisture-induced decomposition, while van der Waals force interactions between the alkyl chains of the adjacent layer provide superior air stability.8,9 Therefore, 2D/3D hybrid structures are utilized as an interface layer in perovskite solar cells for improving the stability and carrier transport to overcome the drawback of 3D perovskite solar cell.10–13 Besides, the electronic properties of 2D RP perovskites can be tuned by adjusting the number of inorganic layers or changing the organic ligand to meet the different application requirements.14,15

Among the optoelectronic properties, the exact nature of the photogenerated carriers, i.e., exciton or free carrier, is a major topic in 2D RP perovskites as it is closely related to many practical applications.16–21 On the one hand, for solar cell and photodetector applications, a low exciton binding energy is favorable because it leads to effective separation of photogenerated carriers and improves charge extraction efficiency. On the other hand, for light emitting applications, efficient radiative recombination is desirable, which requires a large exciton binding energy, as the free charge carriers can be easily quenched by defects and thus lead to reduced quantum efficiency. Compared to their 3D counterparts, the exciton binding energies of 2D RP perovskites are significantly higher due to quantum confinement and dielectric effect.7,22,23 The binding energy can be tuned by adjusting the number of [PbX6]4− layers n in 2D perovskites. As n increases, the binding energy decreases because of the decreased quantum confinement. The binding energies of 2D perovskites have been extensively investigated and consistently estimated to be at a level of a few hundred meV.24 Dyksik et al. used optical spectroscopy under high magnetic fields, determined the binding energy of PEA2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 is 265 meV, 162 meV, and 78 meV for n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.25 Blancon et al.22 used a theoretical model to calculate the binding energies of BA2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 to be 467 meV, 245 meV, 169 meV, and 136 meV for n = 1 to n = 4, respectively. They also directly measured the binding energy of BA2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1via optical experiments, where the binding energy for n = 1 to n = 5 was 467 meV, 251 meV, 177 meV, 157 meV, and 125 meV, respectively. Gélvez-Rueda et al.26 used microwave conductivity to obtain the binding energy of BA2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 of around 370 meV, 170 meV, 120 meV, and 80 meV for n = 1 to n = 4, respectively. In principle, it is expected that at room temperature exciton is the dominant carrier species in the 2D BA2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 with small n, while free carriers can be dominant for 2D with fairly large n and 3D MAPbI3 (n = ∞). Blancon et al.22 predicted that the carrier behaviour changes from exciton to free carrier when the number of layers n increases from 1 to over 20 at room temperature. Controversially, Marongiu et al.16 pointed out that according to Saha equation, the transition from exciton to free carrier would occur for n = 2 with the excitation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm, even though the binding energy was as large as 200 meV. The different hypotheses for exciton and free carrier in 2D perovskites have been extensively investigated.26–29 To date, the nature of the photogenerated carriers in 2D perovskites still remains elusive.
Here we investigate the exciton and free carrier behaviours in RP halide perovskites using excitation intensity dependent time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) at room and low temperatures (20 K). We confirm that (BA)2PbI4 (n = 1) shows clearly exciton properties while (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (n = 2) and (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) demonstrate free carrier properties even though the binding energy is as large as hundreds of meV. Our experiments clearly indicate binding energy is not a dominant evaluation for their exciton-free carrier behaviour. Instead, highly efficient carrier transport and exciton dissociation by the edge state is ascribed to be the major mechanism. This article also provides novel insights for interpreting the relation between carrier properties and the edge state by studying carrier dynamics at room and low temperatures.
Result and discussion
The samples used in this investigation include (BA)2PbI4 (n = 1), (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (n = 2), and BA2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) RP perovskite platelets. The details of the 2D perovskite single crystal growth are listed in the ESI.†14 The 2D perovskite platelets were obtained by cleaving the bulk crystals using the well-known Scotch tape method30 (the details are listed in the ESI†) under the protection of nitrogen. The typical microscopic picture of the exfoliated samples is presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The thicknesses of the platelets randomly distribute in the range of a few hundreds of nanometers and the average size of the exfoliated microplate is about 15 μm. The exfoliated (BA)2PbI4, (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and BA2(MA)2Pb3I10 platelets are denoted as n = 1, n = 2 and n = 3 respectively, and their chemical structures are as shown in Fig. 1a. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra located at 530 nm, 590 nm, and 630 nm correspond to n = 1, n = 2, and n = 3, respectively (Fig. 1b), which are consistent with the previous reports.14,31 The PL peak displays a redshift with increasing n, indicating that the quantum and dielectric confinement effect of the samples decreases gradually.32,33 Besides, the PL shape gradually becomes more asymmetric with increasing n and exhibits a shoulder in the longer-wavelength. Generally, such asymmetry in 2D perovskites originates from phonon-assisted defects34 and surface defect states.35,36 Another possible reason is that the PL signal at the longer wavelength originates from the larger n phase, which indicates that the samples are multi-phase. In this situation, the PL pattern will exhibit multiple PL peaks.37 But as shown in Fig. 1b, all the samples have one PL peak and there is only a minor PL intensity in the slightly longer wavelength rather than a peak signal, indicating that the asymmetric PL peak is the result of the defect states34–36 and the sample is pure phase,14,37 without other unexpected n phases. The femtosecond transient absorption (TA) results also support this conclusion. If the perovskite sample is multiple phase, the TA spectrum will exhibit multiple ground state bleaching (GSB) peaks.15,38–40 As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the TA spectra of all samples only exhibit one GSB peak, implying that the samples are free from other subphases. To further confirm the phase purity of the samples, XRD characterization was performed. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the main diffraction peaks of the samples match with the previously reported single crystals.14,41 Based on the above discussion, a conclusion can be drawn that the all the samples used in this study are pure phase.
To explore the carrier dynamics of 2D perovskites, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was carried out on three samples excited using 400 nm fs laser (details in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the transient variation of optical density (ΔOD) is detected as a function of both probe wavelength and time delay between pump and probe, where ΔOD is defined as the optical density variation between pump excitation and without pump, it indicates the absorption difference in the time delay between pump and probe. In each TA figure, the GSB peak can obviously be observed as a bandgap (negative peak) at 523 nm, 579 nm and 616 nm for n = 1 to 3, respectively. The redshift of the GSB peak with n increases indicates the decreased quantum and dielectric confinement effect in the sample, which is consistent with the PL spectra in Fig. 1. In addition to the bleaching peak, a positive peak is observed for each sample, located in the blue side of the bleaching peak, which is ascribed to the excited state absorption (ESA).42,43 It should be noted that the width of the ESA peak increases from n = 1 to n = 3, which is ascribed to the result of the carrier characteristics become more free-carrier-like due to the decreased quantum confinement effect.43 To obtain further insight, the TA decay curves at the GSB and ESA peaks are quantitatively analyzed for each sample by fitting with bi-exponential functions, . The example of the fitting is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). With the increasing number of layers from n = 1 to n = 3, the decay time significantly increases, from 25, to 160 to 555 ps. With the increasing number of layers, the mass of the inorganic layers increases and the electron–phonon coupling reduces due to decreased frequency of the acoustic phonon oscillation and phonon velocity.44,45 In principle, the ESA signal in the TA spectrum originates from the absorption from an excited state to a higher excited state.46 It is interesting to note that the time constants of the ESA and GSB peaks are roughly close for each of n = 1, 2, and 3, which may suggest that these ESA signals are ascribed to the transition from the bottom of the conduction band to the higher excited state.

It is well known that the photogenerated carriers, either excitons or free carriers, usually exhibit different dependence on excitation power density.47,48 To explore the free carrier and exciton dynamics of 2D perovskites, the excitation intensity dependent time-resolved PL measurements were performed for exfoliated 2D perovskite samples. As shown in Fig. 3, the PL decay curves were obtained using the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique with the excitation of a 405 nm pulse laser at different excitation fluences.
 Fig. 3  Excitation fluence dependent PL decay curves of n = 1 (a), n = 2 (b) and n = 3 (c) at room temperature. 
For n = 1, the PL decay curves (Fig. 3a) exhibit weak intensity dependence. In principle, the intrinsic electron–hole recombination and their lifetimes are determined by the wavefunction overlapping of electron and hole. With increasing layer number n, the quantum and dielectric confinement decreases. Therefore, the 2D RP perovskite with n = 1 exhibits a much faster recombination rate than those for large n; and that for n = 2 has a faster recombination time than that for n = 3,49 as shown in Fig. 3. To quantitatively analyze the carrier dynamics, the PL decay curves are fitted by a bi-exponential function . A fast and a slow component are extracted (Table S2, ESI†). With increasing excitation fluence, the time constants of both fast and slow components remain approximately constant, while the weight of the slow decay component increases slightly, which implies a strong characteristic of exciton carrier dynamics,48 as detailed later. The increased weight of the slow component can be ascribed to the stronger interaction between the bright and dark excited states with the increased excitation intensity.50–52 It is noteworthy that the dark exciton state is different from the defect trapping state because the dark exciton can return to the bright exciton without energy loss and the existence of dark exciton will not affect the excitation intensity dependence of the PL decay curves observed in TRPL measurements.50,52
In contrast to the case of n = 1, the PL decay curves of n = 2 (Fig. 3b) demonstrate strong excitation intensity dependence. At low excitation fluence (15 mW cm−2), the PL decay curve exhibits a dominant fast decay component, which indicates that carrier recombination is dominated by defect trapping, similar to that previously observed in 3D perovskites.53–55 With increasing fluence (up to 150 mW cm−2), the weight of the fast component decreases, therefore a slower overall PL decay is observed. Further increasing the fluence to 500 mW cm−2, the PL decay gets faster. A similar tendency of increasing fluence has been reported in 3D perovskites, e.g., MAPbI3,53,56 CsPbBr357 and other 3D perovskites,58–60 and this is attributed to the free charge carriers in which the competition between the defect trapping and bimolecular recombination determines the dynamics.54,55,61 At the low excitation regime (15 mW cm−2), defect trapping dominates the fast decay component of the PL decay curve. With increasing excitation intensity, the weight of the defect trapping decreases as the weight of bimolecular radiative recombination increases and defect trapping decreases due to the saturation effect,53 resulting in smoother PL decay curves. At high excitation (500 mW cm−2), the dynamics is dominated by bimolecular radiative recombination, which leads to a faster PL decay.
Similarly, the PL decay curves at n = 3 (Fig. 3c) show a strong excitation intensity dependence, and the PL decay variation tendency with fluence resembles that of n = 2: at low excitation fluence a significant overall fast PL decay is observed, while PL lifetime increases with the increase of the excitation intensity at the low excitation intensity regime, followed by a decrease at the high excitation intensity regime.
It is worth noting that for each sample there exists defect trapping with limited density. With increasing excitation intensity and photogenerated carrier density, the availability of defect states decreases due to the filling saturation. At the low excitation regime, defect trapping is the dominant decay pathway. With increasing excitation intensity, the defect state is filled and the decay pathway becomes dominated by direct band-to-band recombination. In the case of n = 1, a very strong electron–hole interaction results in a very short recombination lifetime that may be as short as the defect trapping time. With increasing carrier density, there is no significant change in the lifetime of TRPL although saturation occurs. Since, for the cases of n = 2, and 3, which have significantly longer recombination lifetimes, their lifetime will have a noticeable change with the increased excitation density.
To explore the impact of the thermal energy on the dynamics of photogenerated carriers, we perform time-resolved PL measurements at a low temperature of 20 K. At such a low temperature, carrier-phonon coupling and defect trapping are highly suppressed because the thermal energy is as small as 1.8 meV. As shown in Fig. 4, at low temperature each sample exhibits a slower PL decay than that at the room temperature, although keeping a similar intensity-dependence tendency to that at the room temperature.
 Fig. 4  TRPL decay curves of n = 1 at different temperatures with 15 mW cm−2 excitation intensity (a), the slower decay time under 20 K indicates the reduced defect trapping density; TRPL spectra of n = 1 (b), n = 2 (c) and n = 3 (d) with different excitation intensities at 20 K. 
For n = 1, at low temperature the intensity dependence of PL decay is similar to that at room temperature, that is, weak excitation intensity dependence. It should be noted that at the highest excitation fluence of 500 mW cm−2, a faster decay component is observed (Fig. 4b), which can be ascribed to the contribution of Auger recombination. Due to the suppressed defect trapping and thus a higher temporal carrier density, Auger scattering can play an nonnegligible role. The weight of Auger recombination increases and therefore a fast component of Auger recombination is observed at the highest excitation fluence.27 For n = 2 and n = 3, the intensity dependence tendency of PL decay curves with increasing excitation fluence is the same as that at room temperature. Based on their different intensity dependent behaviours, the 2D RP perovksite of n = 1 has exciton characteristic properties and those of n = 2, 3 show free carrier characteristic properties.
To quantitatively analyze the carrier dynamics, the PL decay curves at room and low temperature were fitted by a bi-exponential function and the effective lifetime τeff = (A1τ1 + A2τ2)/(A1 + A2) of all samples was extracted (Fig. S4, ESI†). For n = 1, τeff at room temperature increases slightly with the increase of excitation intensity, indicating that the density of defect trapping is gradually decreased and no Auger recombination occurs. In contrast, τeff at low temperature shows an obvious decrease at high excitation intensity (500 mW cm−2), which indicates that Auger recombination occurs under high excitation intensity. For n = 2 and n = 3, at the low excitation regime τeff increases with increasing excitation intensity, due to the decreased weight of defect trapping53,62 while at high excitation fluence, τeff becomes shorter than that at low fluence, which indicates the increased contribution of bimolecular and/or Auger recombination.
The observed excitation intensity dependent dynamics of PL lifetime can be interpreted by the rate equation, which has been widely used to study the PL lifetime of perovskites.53,63–65 For the exciton dominant case, the rate equation can be (1)where n = n(t) is the density of the exciton, and C1, C2 and C3 are the coefficients of Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) nonradiative recombination, exciton radiative recombination and Auger recombination, respectively. Both defect trapping and exciton recombination are linearly proportional to the density of excitons. With increasing excitation fluence, PL decay time does not exhibit significant difference because of their linear relationship with exciton density and comparable lifetimes. When the exciton density is very high, Auger recombination may become a significant decay pathway, which results in the faster decay component. This is why we can only observe Auger effect at low temperatures with relatively low defect trapping at the highest excitation intensity (Fig. 4b).
For the case of the free carrier dominant, the rate equation can be expressed as (2)where n = n(t) is the density of the charge carrier taking into the balanced effective mass of electron and hole in perovskites; A, B and C are the coefficients of SRH, bimolecular and Auger recombinations, respectively. Therefore, the terms correspond to the defect trapping, bimolecular radiative recombination, and Auger recombination, respectively.
It can be noted that the rate equation is not suitable for interpreting the PL behaviour at the low excitation regime because it does not take into account the effect of defect saturation. Instead of the rate equation, we simulate the PL decay curves using bi-exponential decay by reducing the weight of the fast component. It should be noted that bimolecular recombination is quadratically proportional to carrier density; defect trapping is linearly proportional to the carrier density together with defect filling saturation. With increasing excitation density, the weight of bimolecular recombination significantly increases, therefore a decreased weight of defect trapping is expected and the PL decay becomes slower as shown in Fig. 5a. While at the high excitation regime, bimolecular recombination dominates the PL decay curve. A simulation of the tendency of PL decay curves according to rate eqn (2) is displayed in Fig. 5b. With increasing carrier density, enhanced bimolecular recombination and the Auger effect can result in faster PL decay. At both room and low temperatures we observe the faster component of PL decay in n = 2 and n = 3, which indicates the dynamics of free carriers.

The behaviour of exciton or free carrier is essentially determined by their binding energy. In a general semiconductor system, thermal energy is the major mechanism for exciton dissociation. However, for 2D RP perovskites of both n = 2 and n = 3, the binding energy of hundreds of meV22 is much larger than the thermal energy at a room temperature of 26 meV. Therefore, thermal energy induced dissociation can be excluded from the possible mechanisms of exciton dissociation. We propose that the edge state effect is the dominant exciton dissociation pathways, as elucidated in Fig. 6 for n = 1 and n ≥ 2, respectively.
 Fig. 6  The schematic of different carrier dynamics between n = 1 (a) and n ≥ 2 (b). The green area represents the edge state. 
The excitons are photogenerated in 2D RP perovskites upon photon absorption, following by an efficient exciton transport to the edge. For the case of n = 1, the exciton cannot dissociate into free carriers due to lack of the edge state; the exciton behaviour is observed. For n = 2 and n = 3, the photogenerated excitons will quickly diffuse to the edge of the crystal and efficiently dissociate into free electron and hole through the edge state; and therefore they exhibit the behaviour of free carriers.
It has been reported that the edge of 2D RP perovskites exhibits an extraordinarily large carrier density and conductivity,66 and the excitons can dissociate into free carriers through the edge of 2D perovskite crystal with n ≥ 2.31,67 However, the edge effect does not apply to 2D perovskites with n = 1 due to no small orientable A-site organic cations. The recent density functional theory simulation points out that the low energy edge state is the result of the internal electric field.68 For n ≥ 2, the crystal structure is more favorable to be a stable non-centrosymmetric structure, in which the neighboring A-site organic cations point in the same direction parallel to the [PbX6]4− layers, create finite dipole moments, leading to in-plane internal electric fields. These internal electric fields will narrow the bandgap of the edge and facilitate the separation of the exciton into free carrier. Due to the lack of MA cations in the n = 1 crystal structure, the internal electric field is absent in n = 1 and the bandgap at the edge keeps the same as bulk. Thus n = 1 exhibits no edge state effect and the excitons do not dissociated into free carriers.
Moreover, efficient in-plane exciton diffusion has been demonstrated in 2D RP perovskites.18,69–71 The exciton diffusion constant is found to increase with quantum-well thickness, while the exciton–exciton annihilation rate decreases, leading to long-range exciton diffusion.70 Besides, photon recycling has been demonstrated to be the dominant energy transport pathway in halide perovskites, enabling the exciton to have an efficient transport within the 2D RP halide perovskites.72 As a result, the photogenerated excitons in 2D RP perovksites can transport efficiently from the interior to the edge region and dissociate into free carrier by the edge states.
Conclusions
In summary, the different carrier dynamics in 2D RP perovskites with n = 1, n = 2, and n = 3 are investigated using excitation intensity dependent TRPL at room and low temperatures. The 2D RP perovskite with n = 1 exhibits exciton dominant carrier dynamics while the samples of n = 2 and n = 3 exhibit free carrier dominant behaviour. The thermal energy driven exciton dissociation is excluded for the pathway of exciton dissociation. Instead, the edge state induced exciton dissociation is attributed to be the mechanism. Although the binding energy is much larger than thermal energy at room temperature for small n (with n ≥ 2), they exhibit free carrier dominant behaviour similar to their 3D counterparts. Therefore they are generally suitable for solar cells and detectors, and as 2D/3D interface layers for improving conversion efficiency and stability of solar cells.
