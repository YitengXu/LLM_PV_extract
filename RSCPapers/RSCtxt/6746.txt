    , Accepted 16th July 2014First published on 16th July 2014AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as very promising third generation solar cells. Porphyrins are promising candidates as highly efficient sensitizers for DSSCs because of their superior light-harvesting ability in the visible region and their mimicking of photosynthesis. This paper focuses on the structure modification of porphyrin dyes for efficient DSSCs, which was based on a rational design using density functional theory (DFT) before the experiment. We synthesized and fully characterized four porphyrin dyes, named ZLD13, ZLD14, ZLD15 and ZLD16. On one hand, we used 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid to replace 4-ethynylbenzoic acid as the electron-withdrawing anchoring group for the first time. Property studies indicate that the aggregation of porphyrin molecules can be sufficiently suppressed via this modification. On the other hand, 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety, which has been proved to be a electron donor group for triarylamine dyes in our previous reports, was introduced to porphyrin dyes, and energy conversion efficiencies (η) were improved by 76% (ZLD15 vs. ZLD13). After the two modifications, the energy conversion efficiency (η) of ZLD16 is comparable with an N719-based reference cell under the same conditions. Enhancement of photovoltaic performances from ZLD13 to ZLD16 is partly due to the decreased dark current and charge recombination rate.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently under intense academic and industrial investigation due to their low-cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiency.1 During the process of photon-to-current conversion in a DSSC device, the photosensitizer plays a key role in determining the solar cell's performance.2 Porphyrin sensitizers have drawn great interest because of their excellent light-harvesting function and mimicking of photosynthesis.3 Moreover, recent developments on porphyrin-based solar cells exhibit a promising advance with the progress curve showing a feature of exponential rise.4,5
Recently, a porphyrin ring with 4-ethynylbenzoic acid at its meso position has been demonstrated as an excellent platform for high efficiency DSSCs.5 In 2009, Diau et al. initially found that introducing bulky tert-butyl groups into phenyl groups increased the energy conversion efficiency (η) from 2.5% to 3.29%.5 In 2010, Bessho et al. added bis(4-hexylphenyl)amine to the porphyrin ring and increased the efficiency to 11%.6 In 2011, Yella et al. further replaced the tert-butyl groups by long alkoxy groups, and a record efficiency of 12.3% was achieved.7
Although porphyrin-sensitized solar cells have obtained high efficiency now, there is still plenty of room for us to achieve the theoretically highest efficiency. One drawback of porphyrins for DSSCs is that their planar molecules often arrange in an orderly fashion and close together on the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide film, therefore leading to dye aggregation.8 When 4-ethynylbenzoic acid was introduced into the porphyrin ring at its meso position (ZLD13, Scheme 1), the porphyrin ring would be located in the central axis of the electron acceptor. Then, the molecules would arrange in an orderly fashion and aggregate on the semiconductor surface. Dye aggregation would inevitably lead to the reduction of electron injection efficiency and energy conversion efficiency, therefore, it is significant for us to avoid unfavorable dye aggregation in DSSCs through the optimization of the molecular structure of the dye.

Herein, we report a novel electron-withdrawing anchoring group named 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid for porphyrin-sensitized solar cells. Different from 4-ethynylbenzoic acid, when 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid was introduced into the porphyrin ring, the porphyrin ring would depart from the central axis of the electron acceptor, and thus, the ordered arrangement of dye molecules would be destroyed and aggregation would be suppressed. On the basis of theoretical calculation, we first synthesized two fundamental porphyrin dyes, ZLD13 and ZLD14, containing 4-ethynylbenzoic acid and 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid as the electron-withdrawing anchoring groups, respectively. Photovoltaic performance tests further supported our design idea. The energy conversion efficiency (η) of ZLD14 is 5% higher than the efficiency of ZLD13.
Recently, we developed a new kind of electronic donor moiety named the 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety and demonstrated that using suitable heterocyclic groups to modify the structures of triarylamine units may improve their electron donating ability.9 On the basis of theoretical calculation, we found the electron donating ability of 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety may be favorable to enhance the performance of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells. Then, we introduced the 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety into porphyrin dyes ZLD13 and ZLD14, and obtained two new porphyrin dyes ZLD15 and ZLD16.10
ZLD13, ZLD14, ZLD15 and ZLD16 were employed as sensitizers in DSSCs. In order to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the four dyes objectively, we employed N719 as the reference dye and manufactured the reference cell. Then, the photovoltaic performances of the devices under irradiation of AM 1.5G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) were investigated in detail.
Photovoltaic tests demonstrate that a higher performance of DSSCs can be achieved after introducing a 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid or 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety into the porphyrin ring (ZLD14 and ZLD15) compared to dye ZLD13. When 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid and 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety were simultaneously introduced into the porphyrin ring (ZLD16), the DSSCs' performance was enhanced further. To explain the results, a series of properties (such as dark current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) were investigated, placing special emphasis on the energetics and charge transfer processes at the dye/titania/electrolyte interface.
2. Results and discussion
Design and synthesis
The design of the dyes is directed by theoretical calculations within the framework of DFT. The ground states of dyes were optimized by DFT with the 6-31G(d) basis sets for light elements and the LANL2DZ effective core potentials for Zn and Ti atoms. The vertical excitation energies of the low-lying states were then calculated using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). All the calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program.11 To test the influence of the density functional, we adopted M062X, CAM-B3LYP, B3LYP and wB97 to simulate the UV-vis absorption spectrum of ZLD13 (Fig. S1, ESI†). Further, dye ZLD13 was synthesized and its experimental UV-vis absorption spectrum was recorded to validate the calculation results. Four different functionals gave qualitatively coincident results with the experiments, and among them, the UV-vis absorption spectrum simulated by B3LYP is rather close to experimental data. Therefore, B3LYP was selected in the following calculations of other dyes, ZLD14–ZLD16.
The calculated UV-vis absorption spectra of ZLD13–ZLD16 are shown in Fig. 1a. The absorption spectra exhibit a red-shifted trend from ZLD13 to ZLD16, which indicates the improvement of light-harvesting ability from ZLD13 to ZLD16.
 Fig. 1  (a) Simulated UV-vis absorption spectra of ZLD13–ZLD16 using TDDFT with B3LYP functional. (b) Assignment of absorption peaks (ZLD13, for example). 
According to the B3LYP calculation results, absorption peaks of dyes in the 400 to 500 nm and 520 to 660 nm ranges can be mainly assigned to the transition of HOMO − 1 → LUMO + 1 and HOMO → LUMO, respectively (taking ZLD13 for example in Fig. 1b).
As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), both the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of ZLD13 (or ZLD14) are mainly π and π* orbitals, respectively, which hover over the porphyrin ring and aromatic acid group. HOMOs of ZLD15 and ZLD16 are almost populated over the whole conjugated system, while the LUMOs of ZLD15 and ZLD16 are just delocalized in the porphyrin ring and the aromatic acid group. Charge-transfer transition can be observed from the HOMO to the LUMO of ZLD15 (or ZLD16).
B3LYP calculation shows that the HOMO–LUMO gaps (ΔE) of ZLD13 (2.52 eV), ZLD14 (2.45 eV), ZLD15 (2.43 eV) and ZLD16 (2.30 eV) reveal a trend of gradual decrease (Table S2, ESI†), which is consistent with the calculated UV-vis absorption spectra of ZLD14–ZLD16 in Fig. 1a.
When a binuclear titanium model, [Ti2O2(OH)2(H2O)4]2+,12 was used to mimic the TiO2 nanoparticles, ZLD13–ZLD16 connecting the models were named as ZLD13-Ti–ZLD16-Ti. It was found that two carboxylic oxygen atoms bind to two neighboring Ti atoms (Table 1). Like before, the HOMOs of ZLD13-Ti and ZLD14-Ti are located at the porphyrin ring and the aromatic acid group, whereas the LUMO of ZLD13-Ti is populated in the binuclear titanium cluster, and the LUMO of ZLD14-Ti partly transfers to the titanium model. The HOMOs of ZLD15-Ti and ZLD16-Ti mainly are populated in the 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety, while the LUMO of ZLD15-Ti is populated in the binuclear titanium cluster, and the LUMOs of ZLD16-Ti are delocalized over the porphyrin ring and the titanium model. A strong coupling between porphyrin dyes ZLD13–ZLD16 and TiO2 nanoparticles, and an obvious charge-transfer transition can be observed from the HOMO to the LUMO of all the four dyes after anchored on TiO2.

Therefore, the red shift of the UV-vis absorption spectra and the evident charge separation and charge migration all suggest that the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells would be improved when a 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid or 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety was introduced into ZLD13. We synthesized the dyes ZLD14-ZLD16, and the experimental details are shown in the ESI.†
Electronic absorption spectroscopy
Absorption spectra of these four porphyrin dyes measured in chloroform are shown in Fig. 2a, and Table 2 lists the corresponding spectral properties. All four porphyrins exhibit maxima in the 400 to 500 nm and 520 to 660 nm ranges, corresponding to the Soret and Q bands, respectively.3a,7 Absorption peaks (λmax) for ZLD13 in CHCl3 are at about 442 nm (ε = 168 × 103 M−1 cm−1) in the Soret band, 565 nm (ε = 7.1 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and 619 nm (ε = 8.6 × 103 M−1 cm−1) in the Q band. After replacing the electron-withdrawing anchoring group with the 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic moiety (ZLD14), the absorption peaks are red-shifted, due to the enhanced electron attracting ability. After introducing the 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety (ZLD15), the absorption peaks are also red-shifted, which can be attributed to the enhanced electron donating ability. When the above two design policies are both applied (ZLD16), the absorption peaks are red-shifted further. The shifting trend of ZLD13–ZLD16's absorption peaks is consistent with the theoretical calculation result as shown in Fig. 1a.

Fig. 2b shows the absorbance profiles of the dyes anchoring on TiO2 nanoparticle film. A slight broadening of the absorption spectra of dyes after anchoring on TiO2 is reasonable and might be due to dye–TiO2 interactions, dye–dye interactions, or both of them on the TiO2 surface.13,14
Electrochemical studies
Quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves (Eox and Ered in Table S3†) were recorded for dyes ZLD13, ZLD14, ZLD15 and ZLD16 in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S2†).
The zero-zero excitation energy (E0–0) estimated from the absorption onset and the ground-state oxidation potential (Eox) were used to calculate the excited-state oxidation potential (E*ox). On one hand, the deduced E*ox values of ZLD13–ZLD16 are more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),15 indicating that the electron injection process should be energetically favorable. On the other hand, the ground-state oxidation potentials (Eox in Table S3†) of these four dyes are more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (0.4 V vs. NHE),15 suggesting that the oxidized dyes should be able to accept electrons from I− thermodynamically for effective dye regeneration. Consequently, all four dyes have enough thermodynamic driving forces for efficient DSSCs using a nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode and an I−/I3− electrolyte (Fig. 3).

The experimental values of the four dyes' band-gaps reveal a trend of gradual decrease [ZLD14 (1.938 V) > ZLD13 (1.911 V) > ZLD15 (1.893 V) > ZLd16 (1.877 V)], which is consistent with theoretical calculation results.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
These four dyes were used to manufacture dye-sensitized solar cells. The devices employed FTO glass anchored dye-loaded TiO2 nanoparticle film as the positive electrode,16 platinum-coated glass as the counter electrode,16 and a solution of 0.6 M DMII, 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M GuNCS in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15) as the electrolyte.17 Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves for the DSSCs were recorded under irradiation of AM 1.5G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and presented in Fig. 4.18 The exact results are summarized in Table 3.

Among the fabricated PSSCs, the energy conversion efficiency (η) of N719 reaches the maximum value of 7.43%. The energy conversion efficiency (η) of ZLD14 (4.20%) is 4.5% higher than that of ZLD13 (4.02%) because of the enhancement of Jsc values from ZLD13 to ZLD14. Both the Voc and Jsc of ZLD15 are significantly greater than those of ZLD13, leading to 76% enhancement of the overall power conversion efficiency for the two devices (7.08% vs. 4.02%). Enhancement of Jsc values from ZLD15 to ZLD16 results in the further improvement of energy conversion efficiency. ZLD16 reaches the energy conversion efficiency (η) of 7.37%, which is comparable with N719. The above results directly demonstrate that the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin dye can be improved after introducing a 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety, or replacing the electron-withdrawing anchoring group with the 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic moiety.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data of these dyes was collected and presented in Fig. 5. The IPCE curves of the four porphyrin dyes have similar profiles. IPCE values of ZLD16 exceed 60% from 410 to 520 nm, with a maximum value (83.0%) at 440 nm. The IPCE curves of ZLD13–ZLD15 are lower and narrower than that of ZLD16 with different degrees. The estimated Jsc values from IPCE data are 7.48, 8.07, 12.5, and 13.27 mA cm−2 for ZLD13, ZLD14, ZLD15, and ZLD16, respectively, which is consistent with the trend of Jsc values in Table 3.

Dye loading experiments have been conducted to correlate to device performance. According to Beer–Lambert law and the molar extinction coefficient of each dye (Table 3), dye adsorbed amounts for ZLD14 (2.3 × 10−7 mol cm−2) and ZLD16 (2.8 × 10−7 mol cm−2) are less than that for ZLD13 (3.1 × 10−7 mol cm−2) and ZLD15 (3.8 × 10−7 mol cm−2), respectively, which may be attributed to destroying the ordered arrangement of dye molecules after replacing 4-ethynylbenzoic acid (within ZLD13 and ZLD15) with 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid (within ZLD14 and ZLD16) as the electron acceptor. Destroying the ordered arrangement of dye molecules is advantageous for the suppression of charge recombination in DSSCs, which is consistent with the following electrochemical impedance study.
Dark current of DSSCs
In addition to the absorption band, dark current or regeneration rate may also affect the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.19 To elucidate the factors affecting the performance of the cells, the dark currents of the fabricated DSSCs were checked (Fig. 6). The dark current of the cell of ZLD14 is slightly higher than ZLD13, which is consistent with the Voc values listed in Table 3. Meanwhile, the DSSCs of ZLD15 and ZLD16 exhibited significantly higher dark currents compared with ZLD13 and ZLD14, which is also consistent with the photovoltaic performances listed in Table 3. These results indicate that dark current is an important factor to affect the photovoltaic performance of these DSSCs.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) is a powerful tool to characterize the important interfacial charge transfer processes in DSSCs.20 Electrochemical impedance spectra were collected for each cell under illumination of AM 1.5G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and under dark. Two semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots, which are assigned to the charge transfer at Pt/electrolyte interface (left peaks) and dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface (right peaks).20c–f The results generated from the EIS experiments have been summarized in Table 4.

Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of DSSCs, tested under AM 1.5G full sunlight, are shown in Fig. 7 and S3 of the ESI,† respectively. The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) on the TiO2 surface, which is related to the charge recombination rate between the injected electron and the electron acceptor (I3−) in the electrolyte,20d,20e is estimated by the large semicircle width. A large Rrec means a small charge recombination rate and vice versa. The Rrec values of ZLD13–ZLD16 increase in the order of ZLD14 < ZLD13 < ZLD15 < ZLd16, which is consistent with the Voc values listed in Table 3. These EIS results indicate that charge recombination is another important factor to affect the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs here.

Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of DSSCs tested under dark are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 of the ESI,† respectively. The intermediate frequency semicircle in the electrochemical impedance spectra represents the charge transfer phenomena between the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface under dark. Efficient suppression of the dark current leads to a larger semicircle. The resistance towards the dark current (the size of the semicircle) also increases in the order of ZLD14 < ZLD13 < ZLD15 < ZLD16. Therefore, the aforementioned arguments on dark current were supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) studies carried out in the dark.
3. Conclusions
In this paper, we adopt two moieties, namely 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine and 5-ethynylthiophene-2-carboxylic acid, as electron push–pull moieties of a porphyrin sensitizer for the first time on the basis of theoretical calculation. Four porphyrin dyes, named ZLD13, ZLD14, ZLD15 and ZLD16, were synthesized and fully characterized. After introducing one of the above moieties to the fundamental dye ZLD13, the energy conversion efficiencies (η) are improved in different degrees, demonstrating the effectiveness of our structure modification methods. When two moieties were both introduced, η is further enhanced (ZLD16), which is comparable with an N719-based reference cell under the same conditions. Enhancement of photovoltaic performances from ZLD13 to ZLD16 is partly due to the decreased dark current and charge recombination rate.
