    , Accepted 29th June 2020First published on 30th June 2020AbstractHerein, we report a multifunctional device with an integrated energy-desalination-smart electrochromic display in one single cell. Specifically, a novel chemically assisted electrochromic desalination set-up was demonstrated using a Prussian blue cathode and an anode comprising Ag or a redox polymer film in salt water without any external electrical energy usage.
The everlasting requirement for clean energy and fresh water propels researchers to develop new concepts and technologies that can sustain the daily life of human beings in an environmentally safe manner.1,2 Moreover, the construction of integrated devices and the introduction of new functionalities into existing smart devices attracts vast research interest for developing future energy and environmental technologies.3,4 For example, electrochromic displays and energy storage functions have been integrated into one smart energy storage device with a high discharge capacity by Zhao et al.5 Moreover, desalination batteries with energy-saving, environmentally friendly and cost-effective attributes6,7 have recently been developed. Although there has been considerable progress in the fields of effective energy storage, electrochromic displays, and desalination, integrating them into one single device is very challenging and has not been reported till date.
In recent years, stimulated (light and chemical) reactions have been investigated for energy storage devices, self-powered devices, and electrochromic displays for smart device construction.5,8 To develop a cost-effective, reusable, and low-energy consumption system for the desalination of sea/brackish water, researchers adopted desalination batteries and capacitive deionization, which is a simple electrochemical concept.9,10 Unlike commercially available techniques such as reverse osmosis and thermal distillation methods, the above mentioned electrochemical methods are superior in terms of cost, energy efficiency, and salt removal capacity.11–13 Recently, James et al. has developed a redox polymer as a Cl− storage electrode for constructing a desalination battery, which uses electrical energy to desalinate seawater.14 Moreover, an Ag electrode was demonstrated to be an effective Cl− storage electrode by Pasta et al.6 In this work, because of their ability to remove excess salt, low cost, and chemically oxidizable nature, the above Cl− storage electrodes were investigated as potential candidates for application as anode materials in a desalination battery. Herein, we describe a proof-of-concept study and the practical implementation of a multi-functional smart device with three functions, namely, energy storage, desalination, and smart electrochromic display. This H2O2 stimulated electrochromic desalination battery was constituted with a chemically oxidizable chloride ion storage electrode, silver or a redox polymer ([Fe(II)(CN)6]4− immobilized polysilsesquioxane), and an electrochromic material (PB-modified electrode (PB|ITO) for sodium ion storage). Recently, the open-framework structured PB electrode has been extensively used in constructing electrochromic devices for various applications such as electrochromic battery displays, energy-efficient smart windows, self-powered devices, human readable batteries, and biosensors.15,16 Among them, electrochromic batteries are an emerging technology with multiple functionalities for energy-efficient display constructions.16–18 Herein, this electrochromic display (PB|ITO) has been integrated into an energy storage and salt water desalination device in an individual platform. Moreover, as indicated in Scheme 1, this device could be categorized as a novel “reverse dual-ion battery” in which anions are reversibly stored in the anode and cations are stored in the cathode.19
 Scheme 1  Mechanistic illustration of chemically-assisted electrochromic desalination battery. 
Chemically assisted electrochromic energy storage and the desalination of salt water are demonstrated in Scheme 1. The device comprised of an electrochromic material, a Prussian blue modified ITO as the cathode, and Ag or a redox polymer (PSQ-[Fe(II)(CN)6]4−) film as the anode in 0.6 M NaCl and H2O2. Herein, H2O2 served as an oxidizing agent to convert Ag to Ag+ or [Fe(II)(CN)6]4− in PSQ to [Fe(III)(CN)6]3−. This generates electrons that flow through the external circuit to reduce Prussian blue (PB) into Prussian white (PW), which is accompanied by a color change from blue to colorless. During this desalination process, Cl− gets inserted into the redox polymer film through the ion-pair formation or reacts with Ag to form AgCl on the Ag foil surface as a charging process; however, Na+ intercalates into the bulk Prussian blue cathode as a discharge process. Next, salination was used to drain the energy from the device in different electrolyte, where the de-insertion of ions from the electrode was achieved. During this salination process, the cathode was recharged by the conversion of PW to PB. However, the redox polymer was discharged by the transition from [Fe(III)(CN)6]3− to [Fe(II)(CN)6]4− or AgCl was discharged back to Ag.
This chemically assisted (H2O2) charging/desalination process is superior to other chemically/current-assisted charging processes because of its low cost, non-toxicity, and environmentally friendly nature. For example, Na2S2O8 and NaClO4/HClO4-assisted rechargeable batteries8,20 generate SO42− and Cl− ions; however, our device produces only H2O during the charging process.
As shown in Fig. 1A, the oxidation of [Fe(II)(CN)6]4− to [Fe(III)(CN)6]3− or Ag to Ag+ by H2O2 was spontaneous due to the large potential difference between H2O2/H2O (+1.77 V vs. SHE) and [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− (+0.356 V vs. SHE) or Ag/Ag+ (+0.799 V vs. NHE). However, the reduction of PB to PW by H2O2 was not desired even though H2O2 can act as a reducing agent. This potential difference enabled our proposed scheme in a single compartment cell without the requirement for a counter reaction such as water oxidation. The overall desalination and salination reactions are shown below,

Prior to assembling the device, the anode (Ag/redox polymer) and cathode (Prussian blue) were individually subjected to spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization. First, the redox polymer (PSQ-[Fe(II)(CN)6]4−) was synthesized using different monomers21 [Experimental section in ESI†]. FTIR analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†) showed a strong stretching of the –Si–O–Si– linkage at 1127 cm−1, thus confirming the formation of amine-functionalized PSQ. The synthesized polymer was then modified on a carbon cloth (CC) by dipping CC in the PSQ aqueous solution. After that, the PSQ-modified CC was electrochemically cycled in acidified KNO3 containing K3[Fe(CN)6] to immobilize the redox couple and [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− was integrated into the PSQ film. The continuous increase in the magnitude of the peak current in Fig. S2 (ESI†) demonstrates the successful immobilization of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− onto the PSQ film. After careful cleaning, cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 1B) of the aforementioned [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− incorporated PSQ-modified CC, was performed in a 0.6 M NaCl (the sea water concentration) both with (blue line) and without (black line) HCl. Fig. 1B shows that the kinetics of the redox process was comparatively faster in the acidified salt solution compared to the salt solution alone. However, the formal potential (E0′ = Epa + Epc/2) of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− only slightly changed after adding HCl. The electrochemical charge compensation process during the redox reaction can be described22 as follows: during oxidation, an ion-pair complex was formed between Cl− and the oxidized redox polymer on the electrode surface. This ion-pair complex then dissociated because of electroreduction with the expulsion of Cl− from the electrode surface to the electrolyte.
The most interesting aspect of this study is the use of H2O2 as an alternate to electrical energy to realize the desalination/charging process. To confirm this, 100 mM of H2O2 was added to a 0.6 M NaCl containing the redox polymer (PSQ-[Fe(II)(CN)6]4−) for 5 min. Subsequently, H2O2-treated redox polymer film was transferred into a 0.1 M KNO3 (after washing with deionized water). A Mg rod was placed in the same solution to perform the spontaneous reduction of the ion-pair complex, which was formed during the oxidation process.14 The driving force for the electron transfer from Mg (Mg/Mg2+ = −2.37 V) to the oxidized (desalinated) redox polymer (Fe2+/Fe3+ = 0.35 V) was the large work function difference (2.72 V) between the electrodes The formation of a white precipitate (AgCl) after adding 50 mM of silver nitrate into the above mentioned solution confirmed the effective oxidation (desalination/charge) of the redox polymer film by H2O2 with the inclusion of Cl− on the electrode surface (Fig. S3, ESI†). Furthermore, a significant change in the conductivity of the 0.1 M KNO3 after the discharge/salination treatment confirmed the effective removal of Cl− ions from the salt water during the H2O2-assisted charging process. The conductivity increased ∼1000-fold after the salination process and the salt removal capacity was 550 mg L−1 (applied charge (Q) = 66 mC and surface coverage = Q/nFA = 6.7 × 10−7 mol cm−2, A = 1 cm2). This value was maintained for up to 10 continuous cycles, as shown in Fig. 1C. Moreover, a new peak appeared in the UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 1D) at 420 nm after adding H2O2 to K4[Fe(II)(CN)6], thus confirming the facile transition of [Fe(II)(CN)6]4− to [Fe(III)(CN)6]3− by H2O2.
Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the open circuit potential (OCP) of the redox polymer in a 0.6 M NaCl with 0.1 M H2O2 and 0.01 M HCl. The slow increase in OCP upon H2O2 addition indicated the sluggish kinetics of [Fe(II)(CN)6]4− oxidation in neutral NaCl. This reaction could then be accelerated by adding 10 mM HCl into the above solution, which was confirmed by a rapid increase in the OCP values from 240 mV to 500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl within 3.5 min. In the absence of H2O2, the OCP value of the redox polymer film in acidified NaCl increased by only 60 mV compared to that of 0.6 M NaCl (Fig. S5, ESI†). Hence, fast chemical charging of the redox polymer film was achieved by enhancing the chemical kinetics in an acidic medium. Although, the redox polymer could be self-charged by oxygen in the air, as shown in Fig. 1A, the complete conversion of [Fe(II)(CN)6]4− to [Fe(III)(CN)6]3− in the redox polymer was extremely slow (almost 1 day). This can be explained by the energy level diagram (Fig. 1A), which shows that the redox potential difference between [Fe(III)(CN)6]3−/[Fe(II)(CN)6]4− and O2/O2− was much smaller than that of [Fe(III)(CN)6]3−/[Fe(II)(CN)6]4− and H2O2/H2O. In the other case, the Ag electrode was subjected to chemically-assisted Cl− storage for constructing an electrochromic desalination battery. Fig. 2A shows the XRD pattern of chemically oxidized Ag foil in the presence of NaCl. The new peaks at 2θ values of 28.0°, 32.3°, and 46.3° (JCPDS file: 31-1238) are attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of AgCl, thus confirming the chemically assisted conversion of Ag to AgCl in the presence of a Cl−-containing medium, as shown in eqn (2).
 Fig. 2  (A) XRD pattern of Ag foil after H2O2 treatment in a 0.6 M NaCl; and (B) cyclic voltammogram of PB|ITO in a 0.6 M NaCl at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
The appearance of chloride peaks in the EDX spectra (Fig. S6, ESI†) strongly support the formation of AgCl on the Ag foil assisted by H2O2 in NaCl, which is consistent with the XRD result. The OCP measurement of the Ag foil in a 0.6 M NaCl confirmed the oxidation of Ag to Ag+ by H2O2 (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Next, the cathode was prepared by the electrodeposition of a PB film on a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, which is verified by Fig. S8 (ESI†). The cyclic voltammogram of PB|ITO in a 0.6 M NaCl (Fig. 2B) displayed two pairs of redox peaks related to PB/PW at a formal potential of 130 mV and Berlin green/PB at a higher potential, which is in good agreement with previous reports.8 The de-coloration and coloration of PB|ITO were accompanied by Na+ insertion and expulsion, respectively.
Finally, a novel electrochromic display device in a single cell was constructed using two different systems, i.e., (1) Prussian blue//redox polymer in acidified 0.6 M NaCl and (2) Prussian blue//Ag in 0.6 NaCl. Herein, the acidification of system 1 enhanced the kinetics of the chemically-assisted charging process, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Both the anode and cathode were more stable in acidic media than in neutral solutions. In Fig. S9A (ESI†), the cyclic voltammograms of system 1 (grey trace) and system II (blue trace) show two pairs of redox peaks, demonstrating the reversible shuttling of ions across the electrode/solution interface. From Fig. S10 (ESI†), the OCP value of PB|ITO (0.78 V vs. Ag/AgCl) was considerably higher than that of the H2O2-oxidized Ag electrode (0.04 V) and H2O2-oxidized redox polymer (0.50 V). This potential difference was the driving force for reducing PB to PW by H2O2-oxidized Ag or the redox polymer through an external circuit. Furthermore, both semi-circle and Warburg patterns appeared in the Nyquist plot for Systems 1 and 2 (Fig. S11, ESI†), indicating the facile transition of ions across the interface.
To confirm the proposed mechanism of the chemically assisted electrochromic desalination battery, a 0.1 M H2O2 was added to a cell containing PB|ITO and redox polymer|CC in an acidified 0.6 M NaCl (system 1) or a cell with PB|ITO and an Ag electrode in a neutral 0.6 M NaCl (system 2). Suddenly, the color of the Prussian blue film faded after the addition of an appropriate amount of H2O2 in both systems, indicating the rapid reduction/discharging of PB to PW by the electrons generated from the anode. The time taken for the PB electrode of the PB//Ag system to color bleach was 9.6 s and for the PB//redoxpolymer system was 79.45 s. PW was then converted back to PB (intense color) after the excess addition of H2O2 to the cells of both systems, which is supported by the large potential difference between PW/PB (−0.43 V vs. SHE) and H2O2/H2O (+1.776 V vs. SHE). As shown in Fig. S9B (ESI†), the OCP value increased to 30 mV for system 1 because of the electrochemical cell reaction. However, the addition of excess H2O2 decreased the OCP value of the cell because of the chemical oxidation of PW to PB by H2O2. For system 2, the OCP value changed by ∼170 mV after adding 100 mM H2O2, while the excess addition of H2O2 decreased the OCP value. These observations confirmed that an appropriate amount of H2O2 could initially oxidize/charge the redox polymer or Ag with chloride ion storage and the discharge/reduction of PB to PW occurred simultaneously with sodium ion storage at the cathode.
The discharging profiles of the different chemically assisted electrochromic desalination batteries are shown in Fig. S9C (ESI†) for comparison. The discharge capacities of system 1 (2.28 μA h cm−2) and system 2 (2.25 μA h cm−2) were almost identical to each other, although they were charged by either H2O2 or an electrical current, demonstrating that the discharge capacity was mostly dependent on the cathode material. Finally, the color change observed for the PB|ITO cathode after the H2O2-assisted desalination of systems 1 and 2 was monitored by transmittance spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S9D (ESI†), the transmittance value of PB|ITO increased by 30% following the H2O2-assisted desalination process, which was attributed to the discharge of the cathodes in both systems. After salination (Fig. S13, ESI†), the transmittance value of PB|ITO recovered to >95% of the initial value, which confirmed that the proposed design could be used as an effective electrochromic display to monitor the desalination process.
In summary, we present a proof-of-concept study on a new electrochemical device that integrates chemically assisted desalination, an electrochromic display, and energy storage into one single system. This concept will be applicable when electrical energy is not accessible for charging/discharging and can be extended to other electrode materials such as bismuth or polypyrrole in a desalination battery system. Moreover, additional improvements in the design and optimization of electrode materials and oxidation/reduction agents may increase the salt removal efficiency to achieve a high energy output. Furthermore, the novel design of this electrochromic desalination battery will direct a new path for developing desalination technology with minimal energy consumption and cost.
