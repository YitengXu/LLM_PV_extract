1. Introduction
Lately, there has been a great deal of interest in nanostructured copper oxide (CuxO) semiconductors. This interest in nanostructured CuxO is fuelled due to their remarkable physical and chemical properties as well as exciting prospects for a variety of applications.1,2
Nanostructured copper oxides are relatively abundant in nature,3 and a wide range of information is now available for their synthesis. Nanostructured CuxO can be grown using different synthesis techniques, including vapour and liquid phase deposition processes, in which a variety of nanomorphologies can be obtained.
Nanostructured copper oxides are exceptionally versatile and offer unique characteristics in many applications. CuxO nanomaterials have been used as colouring agents for the production of Roman mosaic glasses and antique ceramics for thousands of years.4,5 Nanosized CuxO has been widely utilized as a fungicide6,7 and in anti-fouling paints8,9 due to its biocidal capability. With the advent of nanotechnology, CuxO has shown a great impact in numerous research fields including optics, sensors, tribology, superconductors, electrochemistry and electronics.10–14
The most common crystal phases of CuxO are: (a) CuO also known as copper(II) oxide or cupric oxide where the mineral is known as tenorite, (b) Cu2O also known as copper(I) oxide or cuprous oxide with the mineral name of cuprite, and (c) Cu4O3 with the mineral name of paramelaconite.1,2,15,16
In this feature article, we present a general, yet complete, review of nanostructured CuxO. The present review is distinguishable from other reviews,1,17 which have a focus on one type of CuxO (generally CuO or Cu2O), while this review endeavors to thoroughly discuss three types of CuxO, including CuO, Cu2O and Cu4O3. The organization of this review is as follows: firstly, we discuss the fundamental chemical and physical properties of nanostructured CuxO and then we summarize the different methods of synthesis that have been reported. Finally we present a selection of interesting applications that exploit CuxO and illustrate the enhancements made possible by using the nanostructured form of this material.
2. Fundamental properties
In this section, the fundamental properties such as crystal structures, electronic band structures, optical and electrical as well as transport properties of nanostructured CuxO are discussed. This section also describes the effect of doping or the presence of impurities on the properties of nanostructured CuxO.
2.1 Crystal structure
CuO has a black colour and crystallizes in the monoclinic centered Bravais lattice in the space group of C2/c. The crystallographic properties of CuO are tabulated in Table 1.2,15,16,18 The copper atom is coordinated to four coplanar oxygen atoms situated at the corners of a rectangular parallelogram, which forms chains by sharing edges. The oxygen atom is coordinated to four copper atoms situated at the corners of a distorted tetrahedron. The chains traverse the structure in the [110] and [10] directions. The two types of chains alternate in the [001] direction and each type is stacked in the [010] direction with a separation between the chains of about 2.7 Å.16,18,19Fig. 1a demonstrates the crystal structure of CuO.

Cu2O is the second stable phase of copper-oxide compounds which is reddish in colour. Cu2O has a cubic structure (space group, oh4or Pnm) with a lattice constant of 4.2696 Å. Each Cu atom in the unit cell is coordinated by two oxygen atoms.19 The crystallographic properties of CuO are tabulated in Table 1.2,15,16,18Fig. 1b demonstrates the crystal structure of Cu2O.
The third stable phase of copper-oxide with an atomic ratio of 1.33 is Cu4O3.20 Cu4O3 is a mixture of Cu(I)/Cu(II) oxide. The local coordination environments of Cu(I) and Cu(II) are similar to the ones found in Cu2O and CuO.21 This less studied compound of the CuxO family was first discovered in 1870 as a mineral in the Copper Queen mine (Arizona, US).2 Cu4O3 belongs to the tetragonal structure (space group, I41/amd) with a lattice constant of a = 5.837 Å and c = 9.932 Å.21Fig. 1c demonstrates the crystal structure of Cu4O3. From the crystal structure, one can observe that there are two types of copper ions which are Cu+ and Cu2+. The Cu+ ion has two oxygen atoms as nearest neighbours forming collinear bonds of length 1.87 Å which is similar to cuprite (Cu2O ∼ 1.85 Å). Similarly, the Cu2+ ion is surrounded by four oxygen atoms with bond lengths and angles being very close to those observed in tenorite (CuO).18,19,21 The crystallographic properties of Cu4O3 are tabulated in Table 1.2,21,22
2.2 Electronic band structure
The reported band gap (Eg) values for CuO, which is a p-type semiconductor, are generally in the range of 1.2 to 2.16 eV.1,23–27 This wide range is attributed to several factors, including interpretation of the nature of the gap (i.e. direct or indirect), annealing treatment, grain dimensions, morphology and doping.1,25,28–30 According to the Tauc relationship, for photon energies (E) greater than the band gap energy, the light absorption can be approximated using:31 αE = αo(E − Eg)η(1)where α is the absorption coefficient, αo is a constant, Eg is the band gap energy and η is an exponent that depends on the type of transition involved. The value of η is  or 2 for direct or indirect transitions, respectively. Rakhshani et al. have reported detailed studies of band gap determination of RF sputtered CuO films.23 They found that their CuO films exhibited an indirect transition with a band gap of 1.21 eV. In contrast, Pierson et al., while reporting the same deposition technique (RF sputtering), determined that their CuO films exhibited a direct band gap with a value of 1.71 eV.32 The different values of Eg were due to different models ((αE)2 or ) being used to determine the band gap value. The other significant factor that contributes to the variation of band gap values of CuO films is related to the heat treatment.29,30 Izaki et al. demonstrated that annealing electrodeposited CuO films altered the Eg value.29 They reported a reduction of 7.5% in Eg after annealing the as-deposited CuO at 773 K. They suggested that the changes in the composition, grain size and lattice constant were induced by the annealing process, altering the CuO band gap.29
In nanostructured CuO, the band gap generally increases with reducing crystallite dimensions.1,33 Experimentally, this is often observed as a blue shift of the optical absorption band-edge when the nanostructure dimensions are reduced. The blue shift can be attributed to the quantum confinement (QC) effect.1,34,35 The strong QC effect occurs when the size of the crystal is reduced much smaller than the Bohr radius for the material (≈6.6 nm for CuO).1 This causes direct changes to the electron wavefunctions and hence significantly alters the Eg. A weak QC effect occurs when the crystal size is larger than the Bohr radius. This causes indirect perturbation of the electron wavefunction due to Coulomb effects and results in more subtle changes in the band gap energy.34,35 In a recent study conducted by Rehman et al., different scales of CuO nanoparticles were reported, where the crystallite dimension is controlled by annealing.33 The crystallite dimensions obtained ranged from 11 nm (T = 250 °C) to 20 nm (T = 600 °C). They reported a reduction of 7% in direct Eg with an increase of crystallite dimensions.33 In addition, it has been reported that the band gap values of nanostructured CuO can be tuned via engineering the morphology36–38 as well as doping.39–42
Cu2O is also a p-type semiconductor material due to the presence of copper vacancies.2,43 It is a direct band gap material with Eg > 2.1 eV. However the band gap can be tuned via engineering the grain dimensions.24,28,30,44,45 This observation is widely attributed to the QC effect in smaller grains, causing a blue shift in the band gap.34,35,46 In a recent study conducted by Poulopoulos et al.,46 on Cu2O thin films with thicknesses ranging from 0.75 to 5.4 nm the Eg value increased significantly from ∼2.6 eV (5.4 nm film thickness) to ∼3.8 eV (0.75 nm film thickness) due to QC effects. In addition, Balamurugan et al.45 and Chang Y et al.44 also reported on the observation of QC effects in Cu2O. They further studied the effect of temperature45 and annealing duration44 on manipulating the crystallite sizes and hence altering the band gap of Cu2O.
Similar to CuO, the optical band gap of Cu4O3 has also been reported with a wide range of values from 1.34 to 2.47 eV which can also be attributed to the interpretation of the type of band gap and whether direct or indirect transitions are allowed.20,32,47,48
A good comparison between the electronic properties of the three types of CuxO is presented via the band structure density functional theory (DFT) calculations by Heinemann et al. (Fig. 2i).19Fig. 2ii illustrates the Brillouin zones with special high symmetry k points of the three copper oxide compounds, which were used for the band structure DFT calculations.19

2.3 Optical properties
The optical behaviour of CuxO films have been experimentally studied, in particular the complex dielectric function (ε(E) = ε1(E) + iε2(E)) was determined via spectroscopic ellipsometry.2,49,50 For comparison, the imaginary part (ε2) of the dielectric function for CuO, Cu2O and Cu4O3 is shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) with Gaussian fitting marked with numbers 1 to 7. For Cu2O the peaks originate from the various band gaps corresponding to 2.59 eV (1), 2.71 eV (2),… 5.24 eV (7).2 The difference in energy between these two first peaks is attributed to the spin–orbit splitting energy of ∼0.12 eV for Cu2O.49 The absence of any sharp peaks for the CuO (ε2) spectrum is due to low symmetry of this crystal. Similarly no sharp peak is seen for Cu4O3 for energies of less than 3.7 eV.

There are many reports regarding the absorption coefficient α (E) and normal-incidence reflectivity R(E) of CuxO films in optical ranges.2,49–51 Cu2O is expected to have an essentially full Cu 3d shell with a direct forbidden band gap of 2.17 eV in the bulk, which can only absorb light up to the visible region. In contrast, CuO has an open 3d shell with a direct band gap (1.2 eV in bulk) of charge-transfer type, which can absorb light up to the near infrared (IR) region.1,15,27 A detailed analysis of the absorption coefficient obtained on bulk and thin film Cu2O can be found in the report by Malerba et al.51 Additionally, Rehman et al. and Borgohain et al. reported the optical absorption properties of CuO and Cu2O nanoparticles of different sizes, respectively.33,52 A comparative study of optical absorption between nanoparticles and near-monodisperse nanospheres of Cu2O has been reported by Zhang et al.53 They found that the nanospheres of Cu2O have a wide absorption peak at 520 nm while Cu2O nanoparticles have an absorption edge at 550 nm.53
Mayer et al. have reported that CuO is nonluminescent.2 This is despite a few reports demonstrating the photoluminescence (PL) of CuO films, however the purity of such films is questionable (the presence of Cu2O is a possibility). Nevertheless, Zhang et al. reported a detailed analysis of the PL properties of CuO nanostructures. They found that the PL properties of nanostructured CuO can be controlled via altering their shape, dimension and morphology.1 The QC effect and the specific surface effect are the two most reported mechanisms which can result in the blue shift and red shift of the PL peak, respectively.1,54 On the other hand, Cu2O shows a weak PL effect due to the fact that optical transitions require parity change, which does not exist between the energetically highest valence band and lowest conduction band of the Cu2O direct transition band.2 In bulk Cu2O, there are three peaks or shoulders that can be assigned to doubly charged oxygen vacancies (Vo2+) at 1.72 eV (720 nm), singly charged oxygen vacancies (Vcu1+) at 1.53 eV (810 nm) and copper vacancies (Vcu) at 1.35 eV (920 nm).2 In nanostructured Cu2O, these peaks and shoulders can be tuned via shape, dimension and morphology alterations as observed by Shi et al.55,56
2.4 Vibrational properties
The lattice dynamics of CuxO materials have been studied using IR, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy.57–61 These studies provided insight into the nature of the electron phonon interaction and the negative thermal expansion (NTE) in CuxO. These methods also provided information about spin-phonon interaction and size dependent electron phonon scattering.61 Debbichi et al. reported an extensive study of vibrational properties of CuxO via Raman spectroscopy where they clearly distinguished the different types of vibrational modes either by Raman or IR spectroscopy.61 Recently, Shih et al. have reported studies on the size effects of spin-phonon coupling in in-plane CuO nanowires.62 They employed low-temperature Raman spectroscopy for probing the local atomic vibrations of nanowires. They found that the spin-phonon mode varies with the size of the CuO nanowires due to the increase in the strength of the spin-phonon coupling.62
The IR spectroscopy modes are associated with the relative motion of both copper and oxygen atoms which consist of asymmetric Cu–O stretching and asymmetric O–Cu–O bending modes. In contrast, Raman active modes only involve the relative motion of oxygen atoms.63Fig. 4 shows Raman spectra of CuxO with calculated frequencies of Raman active vibrational modes.61 The symmetries of the zone-center modes are given by the following representations:2,61 ΓCu2O = A2u + Eu + 3T1u + T2u + T2g(2) ΓCuO = Ag + 2Bg + 4Au + 5Bu(3) ΓCu4O3 = 3Eg + A1g + 2B1g + 9Eu + 6A2u + 5B2u + 2B1u + 2A1u(4)

2.5 Electrical properties
The electrical conductivity and hole density of p-type Cu2O films vary with copper vacancy density, which act as shallow acceptors.2 Similarly in CuO, copper deficiencies account for the intrinsic p-type semiconducting behaviour.64 Suda et al. and Young et al. have studied the effect of temperature on electrical conductivity of CuO and Cu2O films, respectively (Fig. 5(a) and (b)).65,66 They have shown that an increase in temperature increases the conductivity of CuO and Cu2O due to an increase in the hole concentration.65 Similar findings were also reported by Gopalakrishna et al.67 using Hall effect studies. They revealed a significant increase in conductivity, mobility and carrier concentration of nanocrystalline CuO after annealing.67 Apart from temperature, electrical properties of CuxO also relied on grain dimensions, grain boundary, film thickness, specific phase and dopants.1–3,68–72 Shao et al. reported an electrical conductivity of individual single CuO nanowires grown by thermal oxidation.69 The electrical transport measurement has shown that the CuO nanowire has a conductivity of 7.8 × 10−4 (Ω cm)−1.69 Additionally, Liao et al. reported that individual Cu2O nanowires have a high mobility of >95 cm2 V−1 s−1.70 It is possible to tune the electrical properties (resistivity, carrier concentration and mobility) of CuxO by changing the stoichiometry and crystallinity of the CuxO films during the deposition process. Deposition parameters, such as pH of the solution in electrodeposition and hydrothermal methods and ion pressure and concentration in RF sputtering techniques, significantly contribute to changes in stoichiometry and crystallinity.73–75

2.6 Thermal properties
A limited number of studies have been carried out on the thermal properties of pristine copper oxide films. However, great interest has been shown for the development of nanoparticles of CuxO suspensions in fluids (nanofluids) due to the significant enhancement of thermal conductivity that they grant to the fluid in which they are suspended.76–79 The relatively high thermal conductivity of CuO (76.5 W mK−1)78 makes it an excellent candidate for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of refrigeration and air conditioning systems.80,81 In contrast, Cu2O has a rather low thermal conductivity of the order of 4.5 W mK−1.82,83 It has been shown that the thermal conductivity enhancement of both CuO and Cu2O nanofluids corresponds to an increased particle volume fraction and temperature.84–87
The variations in the Seebeck coefficient (S) of CuO and Cu2O as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (c) for which both oxides show decreasing trends. It has been shown that at 500 K, CuO and Cu2O exhibit a maximum value of 200 μV K−1 and 1050 μV K−1, respectively.65,66
The presence of a wide gap in the phonon spectra between low frequency (due to acoustic and optical phonon modes that involve the motion of Cu atoms) and high frequency (due to the optical modes of oxygen vibrations) bands are reflected in the temperature dependence of heat capacity.88 The calculated and experimental heat capacities (Cp) of CuO and Cu2O as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. (5d) and (e).88–93 As seen from the figure, the shape of Cpvs. temperature curves for both CuO (for temperatures below 800 K) and Cu2O (for temperatures below 500 K) are accurately accounted for by the calculations that employ the quasi-harmonic approximation.88
2.7 Magnetic properties and superconductivity
The copper–oxygen covalent bond is the prominent factor governing the properties of high transition temperature (High-Tc) superconducting CuxO compounds.94 Both CuO and Cu4O3 have an antiferromagnetic ground state. For CuO the antiferromagnetic unit cell has twice the size of the primitive unit cell of the crystal.19 In the case of Cu4O3, it was suggested that the antiferromagnetic unit cell doubles the crystallographic unit cell in all three special directions.19,95–97 Bulk CuO is antiferromagnetic with Néel temperatures from 213 K to 230 K.1,98,99 The CuO antiferromagnetic transition takes place in two stages: near 230 K it leads to incommensurate antiferromagnetic order and near 213 K by a first order transition to a commensurate antiferromagnetic order.94 As mentioned in Section 2.1, the copper atom of CuO is surrounded by four coplanar oxygen atoms, resulting in two sets of one dimensional Cu–O chains. The magnetic interaction due to super exchange leads to antiferromagnetic order in the Cu–O–Cu chains along the [10] direction with a bond angle of 146°.94 Magnetic properties of nanostructured CuO significantly rely on their grain dimensions, morphology as well as anisotropy of the nanostructures.1 A diameter of 10 nm is the critical size for CuO nanoparticles to show ferromagnetic behaviour.1,100–102 Interestingly, there are reports regarding room-temperature ferromagnetism of pure CuO nanostructures.1,103–105 The room-temperature ferromagnetism is due to oxygen vacancies at the surface/or interface of the nanoparticles.1,105
A neutron diffraction study revealed that Cu4O3 undergoes a magnetic phase transition below 42.3 K leading to a pyrochlore lattice.95,96 The amplitude of the magnetic moment carried by Cu2+ is ∼0.46 μβ which indicates the strong covalent character of the Cu–O bonds and the presence of strong fluctuations even at low temperatures.95
Compounds made of Cu and O are the base of a famous class of high-Tc superconductors.94 Superconductivity in these materials is observed when they are strongly doped away from their ideal stoichiometry. It has been shown that spatial changes in carrier density and the superconducting gap produce local inhomogeneity, which strongly affects their superconductivity.106
High-Tc was first discovered by Bednorz and Müller in 1986 using Cu and O compounds such as La2CuO4 doped with Ba.107 A few months later it was found that doping the same material with Sr raised the superconducting critical temperature to nearly 40 K.107 Recently, the performance of high-Tc copper and oxygen based materials was further enhanced with the inclusion of extra oxygen atoms as mobile “holes” into the copper oxide planes as illustrated in the Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and YBa2Cu3O6+x systems.106,108 Apart from providing charge carriers, the role of oxygen dopants is still debatable and being investigated.106,108–110
2.8 Doping
It is possible to modify the chemical and physical properties of CuxO through doping. It has been shown that doping has the capability to alter the conduction type of Cu2O (from p to n). Based on the valencies of Cu and O, which are +1 and −2 in Cu2O, some n-type dopants including group VII elements such as halogens (O sites) (and possibly group II elements (Cu sites)) allow this transition to occur.111 The typical reported halogen dopants include fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) which can be intercalated into the structure of Cu2O during the synthesis process.111–114 Theoretically, F is the best match for O given the similarity in the size; however, CuF is soluble in water.111 Recently, Scanlon et al. have demonstrated that intrinsic n-type defects or defect complexes in Cu2O created during an electrodeposition process cannot be the source of any n-type behaviour.75 They have suggested that the n-type conduction is due to an inversion layer which was attributed to a shallow donor level being formed during the electrodeposition process or due to external impurities (dopants).75
Generally, the hole density of native p-type CuxO films is poor, uncontrollable and sensitive to the preparation methods and experimental conditions. It has been reported that nitrogen (N) and silicon (Si) doped Cu2O via a RF sputtering process can significantly reduce such instabilities.115–118 These dopants were found to act as acceptors, which are incorporated into the oxygen lattice without converting the conduction type of Cu2O.117,118 To further stabilize the films Ishizuka et al. and Okamoto et al. investigated the effect of passivation using hydrogen (H) and crown-ether cyanide of the N doped Cu2O films.115,119 The improvement after the treatment indicates that hole traps are passivated by cyanide or protons. These hole traps are generally due to oxygen vacancies or dangling bonds of Cu.115
For solar cell applications, the intrinsic photoconductivity of Cu2O can be limited by minority charge carrier recombination caused by native defects acting as trap states. Isseroff et al. used first principles DFT calculations to study these trap states and demonstrated that substitutional cation doping reduces the recombination effect.43 They found that split vacancies are the source of trap states that inhibit the minority carrier diffusion in Cu2O. Dopants such as lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) prevent the formation of the split vacancies for a single cation vacancy which resulted in an electronic structure that exhibited no trap states within the band gap.43
3. Nanostructured CuxO synthesis
Many different approaches for the synthesis of nanostructured CuxO have been implemented using both vapour and liquid-phase-based methods. In this section, we present the most common synthesis methods and describe how they can be employed for engineering and tuning the morphologies and properties of CuxO.
3.1 Vapour phase synthesis
Vapour phase synthesis methods can be divided into two different categories: (i) physical vapour deposition (PVD) and (ii) chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The main difference between them is the process they employ, in which PVD uses physical forces to deposit films, while CVD uses chemical processes.

3.1.1 PVD methods. 
Many of the common PVD synthesis techniques such as RF sputtering, direct current (DC) sputtering, thermal evaporation, thermal oxidation, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulse vapour deposition (PLD) and electron beam epitaxy (EBE) have been used for the deposition of nanostructured CuxO. A PVD process is purely physical, starting with either CuxO or Cu as the source material in the form of a solid target or powder, which is evaporated or sputtered with the application of ion bombardment, thermal heating, electron beam impingement or laser irradiation.
3.1.1.1 Sputtering. 
Amongst the PVD techniques, sputtering has, thus far, been the most common technique to synthesize thin film CuxO due to the ease of control over the deposition parameters. The as-synthesized films usually exhibit a nanometer-sized tightly packed columnar structure.120–125 Sputtering is a process in which atoms are ejected from a solid target material by bombarding it with energetic particles. It offers a high degree of control over a film's crystallinity and stoichiometry. The crystallinity, grain dimension and stoichiometry of the copper oxide films can be controlled by varying the sputtering parameters such as applied power, oxygen flow rate, oxygen partial pressure and concentration as well as annealing temperature.32,120–122,124–128 For example, Chu et al. reported crystallite sizes of Cu2O thin films varying from 16.8 to 8.8 nm when oxygen partial pressures increased from 1.1 × 10−3 to 1.8 × 10−3 Torr. This indicated that the higher the oxygen partial pressure, the smaller the crystallite size in the nano-crystalline Cu2O thin films.120 In contrast, Elfadill et al. reported that the crystallite size of CuO increased from 12 to 24 nm as the oxygen pressure increased.125
Generally in an oxygen rich sputtering chamber, at relatively low sputtering powers, only a small number of Cu atoms are sputtered, which effectively react with oxygen in the plasma, resulting in the deposition of films with high oxygen content such as CuO films. Conversely, Cu2O films are formed at high sputtering powers, due to a large number of sputtered Cu atoms.122,126 However, relatively high sputtering powers can also adversely affect the stoichiometry of the films, resulting in the presence of unreacted metallic copper and undesirable stoichiometric ratios between copper and oxygen.122
Although Cu4O3 was discovered during the late 1870s, the synthesis of single phase Cu4O3 thin films has rarely been reported. Pierson et al. and Richthofen et al. have successfully demonstrated the synthesis of single CuO, Cu2O and Cu4O3 phases by varying the oxygen flow rate using a reactive magnetron sputtering technique.32,128 They used a Cu target with the RF power maintained at 600 W. It was suggested that conductive Cu-rich copper oxide (Cu4O3) thin films tend to form at an oxygen flow rate R(O2) < 30%, whereas insulator O-rich copper oxide (CuO) thin films tend to form at R(O2) ≥ 30%.129 This is in contrast to the work of Blobaum et al. who also successfully synthesized Cu4O3 films via sputtering, but with a CuO target and at a lower sputtering power of 200 W.127
3.1.1.2 Thermal evaporation. 
Deposition of CuxO films using thermal evaporation is achieved by vaporizing a source material of Cu or CuxO (in either powder or condensed form) using heat either in a vacuum or in a controlled gaseous environment at a low pressure.25,45,130–133 The vaporized Cu or CuxO that emanates from the material source interacts with the gas molecules in the environment of the deposition chamber before condensing onto a substrate. Processing parameters such as evaporation temperature, substrate temperature, substrate type, gas environment and pressure all play important roles in achieving the desirable CuxO thin films.25,131,134 It has been reported that the as-synthesized CuxO films from these methods are usually compact thin films, which are textured by nanocrystallites (25–30 nm).25,45,132,133
3.1.1.3 Thermal oxidation. 
Thermal oxidation techniques offer a simple, convenient and fast method to synthesize nanostructured CuxO with various morphologies including nanowires, nanoribbons and nanorods.135–139 In this method nanostructured CuxO is directly grown on the surface of a Cu substrate.137,138,140 Thermal oxidation is performed by simply heating a Cu substrate to a high temperature (typically between 200 and 800 °C) in an oxygen rich environment.135,137,138,141–143 Generally, the morphology and stoichiometry of the CuxO can be controlled by tuning the deposition parameters. For instance, the diameter and density of CuxO nanowires can be altered by changing the oxidation temperature.144 However, very high oxidation temperatures (>900 °C) are not suitable for nanowire formation as CuxO nanostructures can be fused together, as observed by Huang et al.145 Valladares et al. have studied the effect of oxidation temperature in altering the stoichiometry of the CuxO films. They have observed that pure Cu2O films are obtained at 200 °C, whereas CuO films are obtained above 300 °C.143
Unfortunately, mechanical adhesion between the as-deposited nanostructured CuxO and the substrates synthesized by the thermal oxidation method is very weak.143,146–149 Cracking and flaking of the CuxO films or even exfoliation from the substrates poses a big challenge which severely affects the properties and practical applications of the nanostructured CuxO. Several methods have been proposed to alleviate the cracking and flaking problem including pre-deposition of a ZnO layer on copper foil,150 synthesis of CuO nanowires on other foreign substrates such as silicon147,151 or glass152 and synthesis of CuO nanowires on porous substrates such as the porous copper substrate149 or nickel foam148 as shown in Fig. 6. Zhang et al. have successfully demonstrated non-cracked and flaked CuO nanowires synthesized on porous copper substrates. The porous substrates managed to reduce thermal stress during the oxidation process and as a result eliminate cracking and flaking issues.149

3.1.1.4 Other PVD methods. 
Apart from the aforementioned vapour phase methods, PLD153–157 and EBE158–161 deposition techniques are the other alternatives available for synthesizing CuxO films. It has been reported that the as-synthesized CuxO from these methods are usually compact thin films, which are textured by nanocrystallites (10–800 nm). The dimensions of the crystallites are significantly affected by the oxygen pressure and substrate temperature which were identified as being the two most important parameters.154,155

3.2 CVD methods
CVD processes have become the popular deposition techniques owing to their inherent flexibility and potential to tailor the CuxO phase composition by simply varying the operating conditions and precursors. Many forms of CVD have been used for depositing different CuxO stoichiometries, including atmospheric pressure CVD,13,162,163 aerosol assisted CVD,164–167 and plasma assisted CVD.168 Such films are typically of a compact structure, consisting of micro- or nanometer-sized grains.
Generally, precursors such as bis-(2,4-pentanedionato) copper(II) or Cu(acac)2 (acac = acetylacetonate) are used due to their high sublimation rate (activation energy of 105.6 kJ mol−1) and low sublimation temperature between 140 and 190 °C.162 Valtierra et al. have demonstrated the synthesis of nanostructured Cu4O3 and CuO thin films with a crystallite size of 6.5 to 8.4 nm on fiberglass substrates using Cu(acac)2 as a precursor and oxygen as a carrier-reactant gas via atmospheric pressure CVD.162 The deposition temperature of CuO and Cu4O3 was recorded as 315 °C and 345 °C, respectively. In addition, thin films of Cu2O have also been synthesized on fiberglass substrates using a similar technique and precursors by Ortiz et al. at a deposition temperature of 320 °C.163
However, precursors such as Cu(acac)2, Cu(dpm)2 (dpm = dipivaloylmethanate) and Cu(hfa)2 (hfa = hexafluoroacetylacetonate) may present drawbacks in terms of poor thermal characteristics, reduced shelf life, halide incorporation or instability upon prolonged utilization due to aging phenomena.169 Therefore, a second generation of adducts of the type M(hfa)2·tetramethylethylenediamine(TMEDA) (M = Cu(I) or Cu(II)) have been successfully adopted as alternative precursors.169 They have favourable properties in terms of improved long-term stability and volatility with respect to conventional β-diketonate.13,169 Barreca et al. were the first group to successfully demonstrate the deposition of nanostructured CuO and Cu2O using the Cu(hfa)2 adduct with TMEDA via CVD.169 They successfully demonstrated morphological evolution from continuous films to 1D hyperbranched nanostructures.169
Spray pyrolysis is a typical aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition, which is utilized in the glass industry and in solar cell production to deliver film coatings of various thicknesses.34 This method has the benefit of forming large-scale thin films by using a simple apparatus that can lead to increased productivity. Moreover, the film thickness and stoichiometry are easy to control and the resulting films are generally dense.165,166 During film deposition, the precursor's solution is pumped to an atomizer, and then sprayed onto heated substrates. Subsequently the droplets undergo evaporation, solute condensation and thermal decomposition, which results in film formation.34 The composition of these thin films is highly dependent on the solvent, morphology of the substrate as well as the deposition temperatures.164,170
CuxO films generated by the spray pyrolysis method are generally produced from copper acetate or copper nitrate as precursors dissolved in alcohol based solutions such as ethanol, propanol or methanol.164,166,170,171 Alcohols are used to increase the wettability of the sprayed solution on the substrate and to improve the homogeneity of the deposited films.165 It has been reported that CuxO nanostructures are formed with the addition of glucose or sucrose to the solution.165,167 These sugars are used as reducing agents in the precipitation of the CuxO nanostructures.165 Waser et al. demonstrated synthesis of CuO nanoparticles via flame spray pyrolysis with various diameters from 6 to 50 nm by varying the precursor solution and the oxygen flow rate.172
Apart from CuO and Cu2O films, Cu4O3 films can also be obtained via spray pyrolysis techniques. Albores et al. have successfully demonstrated the deposition of Cu4O3 films on ZnO nanorods.170 The formation of Cu4O3 films is a gradual process. Initially, the possible lattice matching of ZnO and CuO promotes the growth of CuO. In the presence of methanol, at elevated temperatures, the Cu2+ in CuO is reduced to Cu1+ forming Cu2O as:170 CH3OH(g) + 6CuO → 3Cu2O + CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)(5)
Then at these elevated temperatures, the solid reaction between CuO and Cu2O results in paramelaconite phase formation which can be described by:170 2CuO + Cu2O → Cu4O3(6)
3.3 Liquid phase synthesis
Liquid phase techniques include methods such as electrodeposition, hydrothermal/solvothermal and sol–gel. These methods are generally chosen due to their low capital cost and better control of the material's morphology in comparison to vapour phase deposition techniques as well as the deposition at relatively low temperatures, which is crucial for low-heat-tolerant substrates. Among a variety of liquid phase synthesis methods, hydrothermal/solvothermal and chemical precipitation techniques have been widely used to synthesize CuxO nanostructures.

3.3.1 Electrodeposition. 
Electrodeposition is a process in which metal ions in an electrolyte are reduced at a conducting electrode under potential control. The process uses electrical current to reduce Cu2+ ions from an aqueous solution. The electrolyte generally contains a mixture of a Cu salt such as copper sulphate, copper acetate or copper nitrate and a chelating agent such as lactic acid, ammonium nitrate, amino acids or tartaric acids.29,173–177 The deposition is carried out in an alkaline environment with the addition of sodium hydroxide or ammonia to control the pH level. The electrodeposition technique is commonly used for depositing CuO and Cu2O films.3,29,173–175,177–180 Such films are typically of a compact structure, consisting of micro- or nanometer-sized grains. The stoichiometry of the electrodeposited films is very much dependent on the type of the chelating agent and applied potential used during the electrodeposition process. Generally, CuO films are obtained upon the application of a positive voltage/current bias, where oxidation of Cu is expected and this process is well known as anodic electrodeposition. Inversely, Cu2O films are deposited at a negative bias, in which the reduction process occurs (cathodic electrodeposition).173,174,181
Synthesis of CuO films via anodic electrodeposition in an alkaline solution containing copper(II) nitrate, ammonium nitrate and ammonia has been reported by Izaki et al. at +0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl.174 Sasano et al. demonstrated that CuO films formed by applying potential pulses are more crystalline than the ones deposited using a constant potential.176 The mechanism for the electrodeposition of CuO films is outlined in eqn (7)–(10). The reaction starts via electrolysis of water to generate oxygen and protons (reaction (7)). Consequently, these protons react with ammonia Cu(II) complexes to yield free Cu(II) ions in the vicinity of a substrate's surface (reaction (8)). The free Cu(II) ions are then hydrolyzed to form CuO films on the substrate (reactions (9) and (10)).174,181 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−(7) Cu(NH3)42+ + 4H+ → Cu2+ + 4NH4+(8) Cu2+ + 2OH− → Cu(OH)2(9) Cu(OH)2 → CuO + H2O(10)
Similarly, syntheses of Cu2O films have been reported via cathodic electrodeposition using an alkaline aqueous solution containing copper(II) sulphate or copper(II) acetate and lactic acid as the chelating agent.10,173,175,179,180,182 Zoolfakar et al. have demonstrated the electrodeposition of Cu2O films onto ZnO for forming heterojunction solar cells.173 The electrodeposition process was carried out at −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Cu2O was formed according to the following electrochemical reaction.175 2Cu2+ + 2e− + 2OH− → Cu2O + H2O(11)
Apart from depositing thin films of CuxO, electrodeposition techniques have been used to synthesize various morphologies of nanostructured CuO and Cu2O including leaf-like,183 nanospindles,184 nanocubes,185 nanorod186 and cauliflower-like.187 Interestingly, Siegfried and Choi have demonstrated a new level of tuning and engineering the morphology of Cu2O crystals via the electrodeposition technique.188,189 They manipulated deposition parameters such as potential and current to engineer Cu2O crystals as illustrated in Fig. 7.189

3.3.2 Hydrothermal and solvothermal. 
Hydrothermal and solvothermal processes are facile and cost-effective deposition techniques. They have the capability of producing nanostructured CuxO of different morphologies including nanodendrites,190 nanowires,71 nanorings,191 nanorods,192–195 nanoribbons,191,194 nanotubes,192 microspheres194,196 and macrowhiskers.197 (Fig. 8).

The synthesis of nanostructured CuxO has been hydrothermally achieved using various precursors such as copper(II) chloride, copper(II) acetate or copper(II) sulphate. Generally, a lower concentration of Cu(OH)42− precursors favours tubular formation, whereas a higher concentration leads to rodlike morphologies.192,194 In most cases, the hydrothermal synthesis of CuxO starts with the preparation of a solution that contains copper salts, sodium hydroxide and solvents, typically deionized water. Such a solution is then kept at an elevated temperature (100–300 °C) for a certain period of time, allowing the nucleation and growth of CuxO crystallites.
Solvothermal methods are almost identical to hydrothermal methods except that organic solvents are used instead of water.198,199 In comparison with the hydrothermal method, the solvothermal method exhibits many advantages such as easier morphological control, free foreign anions and macroscopic quantity.200,201 Recent reports have shown that the high-aspect-ratio of CuxO nanostructures can be synthesized via solvothermal methods.202–205 Zhao et al. have demonstrated a facile method to synthesize pure polycrystalline Cu4O3 microspheres using copper(II) nitrate as the precursor in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide and ethanol.201 They have successfully manipulated the CuO/Cu2O stoichiometry ratio to generate Cu4O3 films with the reaction of (2CuO + Cu2O → Cu4O3) in a closed system.201


3.3.3 Solution-based chemical precipitation methods. 
In most cases, the chemical precipitation synthesis of CuO nanoparticles starts with the preparation of a solution that contains copper salts, sodium hydroxide and solvents, typically deionized water. In order to avoid agglomeration of the CuO nanoparticles, an external energy such as ultrasonic or high pressure needs to be applied during the synthesis process. Zhu et al. prepared highly dispersed CuO nanoparticles of 6 nm with various morphologies including spherical, ellipsoidal and needle-shaped CuO.206 Wu et al. prepared CuO nanoparticles with different sizes and morphologies in organic solvents such as dimethylacetamide (DMAC).207 They found that the nucleation and growth kinetics of CuO nanoparticles can be tuned by varying the processing parameters including the volume ratio of DMAC and water, increasing the temperature of the solution and the molar ratio of Cu2+ and OH−.207 Apart from nanoparticles, chemical precipitation synthesis has commonly been used to synthesize different morphologies of CuO including nanowires,208–210 nanoribbons,211 flower-like,212,213 hierarchical nanochains214 and nanosheets.215,216 A recent comprehensive review on nanostructured CuO via the solution-based chemical precipitation technique is found elsewhere.1
There are many reports of synthesis of nanostructured Cu2O via chemical precipitation.53,217–224 Gou et al. demonstrated a synthesis of highly uniform and monodisperse Cu2O nanocubes. The process involved the use of sodium ascorbate to reduce Cu(II) salts in water, in the presence of a surfactant and NaOH. The nanocube dimensions were tuned by varying the concentration of the surfactant.217 Zhang et al. reported synthesis of monodisperse Cu2O and CuO nanospheres. It has also been shown that by modulating the concentration of solvent, the diameter, crystallization and monodispersity of Cu2O nanospheres can be kinetically controlled.53 Interestingly, various groups have reported a facile method for the synthesis of Cu2O nanocrystals with systematic shape evolution (Fig. 9).220–223 Recently, Susman et al. demonstrated precise morphology control of Cu2O nanocrystals covering the entire range of morphologies from complete cubes, via the intermediate morphologies truncated octahedral, cuboctahedra and truncated cubes, to complete octahedral.220 The highly effective morphology control is attributed to competitive adsorption of hydroxide and citrate anions on the [100] and [111] planes of the growing crystallite.220

3.3.4 Other film formation methods. 
A sol–gel process involves the formation of a colloidal solution (sol) from selected chemicals that acts as a precursor for an integrated network (gel) of either discrete particles or connected networks. During gelation (aging process), various forms of hydrolysis and polycondensation processes can take place. Film deposition is generally carried out during the gelation process via dip-coating, spin coating or drop-casting onto the substrates. Armelao et al. have reported CuxO thin films via sol–gel synthesis, using ethanolic solutions of copper(II) acetate.225 Films were obtained by dip-coating at room temperature in air and were subsequently heat-treated at different temperatures (100–900 °C) in oxidizing (air), inert (N2) or reducing (4% H2 in N2) atmospheres to observe different crystalline phases of CuxO as a function of the annealing conditions with an average crystallite size lower than 20 nm.225 Ray has also reported a similar technique, however he experimented with methanolic solutions of cupric chloride.226 Under atmospheric heat-treatment conditions, Armelao et al. have only managed to observe the CuO phase with 900 °C annealing, while Ray has successfully demonstrated the deposition of CuO and Cu2O at 360 °C and 400–500 °C, respectively.225,226
Templating is a modification of the sol–gel synthesis technique and can be very effective for the preparation of CuxO nanowires.141 Nanostructured CuxO is deposited onto porous templates such as anodic alumina membranes and polycarbonate membranes.227–229 Generally, templates are used for assisting the growth of the CuxO by controlling the diameters, lengths and densities of the nanowires.227 At the end of the deposition process, the templates must be removed either by chemical reactions229 or a selective burn-away at high temperatures.230 Consequently, this procedure may prolong the process as well as degrade the quality of the CuxO.141

4. Applications of CuxO
CuxO has been employed for a variety of applications ranging from optical devices to high thermal conductivity systems. In this section, some of the most common applications of CuxO materials are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the enhancements that can be achieved by exploiting the nanostructured forms of CuxO.
4.1 Solar cells and light emitting diodes
CuxO films are possible candidates for developing different types of optical devices, including solar cells based on dye-sensitized and heterojunction architectures as well as organic light emitting diodes.
The quest and need for a clean and economical energy source have increased interest in the development of solar applications. Amongst various metal oxide materials for solar energy applications, Cu2O has attracted increasing interest due to its theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18% and an absorption coefficient higher than single crystalline Si.173,231
As described previously CuxO is an intrinsically p-type material. However, self-compensation problems and dopant solubility have inhibited the synthesis of n-type CuxO to produce efficient homojunctions for photovoltaic applications.3,72,232 Therefore, heterojunction architectures have been employed with other n-type semiconductors such as ZnO,10,173,175 CdO,233 TiO2,234–236 Ga2O3 (ref. 237) and GaN.2 Amongst the aforementioned n-type semiconductors, ZnO has been found to be the most stable and exhibit relatively low lattice mismatch of 7.6% between the (002) ZnO and (111) Cu2O phases.3,175,177 Despite the predicted PCE value of 18%, in practice the ZnO–Cu2O solar systems have yet to reach high efficiencies.3,10,238 To date, the highest efficiency ever reported for bilayer ZnO–Cu2O heterojunction solar cells has been 3.83%.239 This is due to the fact that theoretically their intrinsic electronic band structures do not permit an open circuit voltage larger than 0.7 V.238 To date, the largest ever short circuit current that has been reported by Zoolfakar et al. using electrodeposited ZnO and Cu2O films was 12.7 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10).173

Apart from heterojunction cells, CuxO has also been widely used in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) technology. CuO is commonly used as a blocking layer that prevents recombination reactions by forming a potential barrier between the anode and the electrolyte which enhances the PCE of the device.240–243 Yet in other experiments, the use of Cu2O at the photoanode of a DSSC was found to decrease the overall PCE.244 This is due to the dissociation of CuxO in liquid-based electrolytes, inducing numerous extrinsic defects that increase carrier recombination, resulting in photovoltaic performance degradation.244
CuxO has also been used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).134,245 In order to construct efficient OLEDs, it is important to optimize the carrier injection ability at the interface of the active layer and anode materials. The CuxO films are commonly used as hole injection layers (HILs) to lower the hole injection barrier.134,246,247 Kim et al. have reported the advantage of using a mixed stoichiometry of CuO and Cu2O for increasing the performance of OLEDs as illustrated in Fig. 11.134 Mixed stoichiometry of CuxO contains high density of defects such as oxygen vacancies or unbonded oxygen atoms, which act as an extra energy state within the energy gap of the CuxO layer. Interestingly, when the energy levels of these gap states are aligned with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the hole transporting layer, no potential barrier is produced at the anode interfaces, which can lead to an increase in the hole injection efficiency.134

4.2 Photo-catalytic applications
CuxO is a promising photo-catalyst that is used in many chemical processes, such as organic contamination degradation and water splitting under visible-light irradiation owing to their small band gap and low cost.13,248–255 Under illumination, CuxO produces electron/hole pairs that can generate hydroxyl radicals (˙HO) from water. This radical is capable of mineralizing most organic molecules.250 For water splitting applications, the majority charge carriers of the CuxO (holes) oxidize water to oxygen gas (O2), while the photo-generated minority charge carriers (electrons) reduce water to hydrogen gas (H2).248,254,255 Significantly, the CuxO conduction band is more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2, which allows sunlight to produce H2 from water.253
Unfortunately, the general photo-instability of CuxO greatly hinders its direct application in photo-catalysis.248,256 To overcome this photo-instability effect, CuxO is typically coupled with other semiconductors to form heterojunctions and it has been reported that TiO2 is one of the best candidates for this purpose.256,257 Additionally, nanostructuring of CuxO can also significantly improve overall stability.256 Fortunately, the large surface area to volume ratio, which is provided by nanostructuring, significantly increases the effective surface area available for photo-catalytic reactions.249,250,252
It has also been reported that the photo-catalytic production rate of H2 can be significantly improved in the presence of alcohol, which provides suitable electron donors (also known as sacrificial agent/reagent).258–260 Barreca et al. have successfully demonstrated excellent performance of Cu2O photo-catalysis for generating H2 in the presence of methanol.13 They have suggested that methanol inhibits electron–hole recombination and acts partially as a hydrogen source.13 However, efficient photo-catalytic activity of CuO for H2 production has not been reported. This is despite the fact that the band gap of CuO is 1.2 eV, which makes CuO an efficient material to absorb sunlight. However, the position of the conduction band level limits its activity. Therefore, introducing a sacrificial agent is crucial to enable it to be used as a photo-catalyst. For example, Yao et al. have reported that CuO exhibits high photo-catalytic activity in oxalic acid solutions.253 Oxalic acid, which is a common pollutant in industrial wastewater, is a strong reductive agent and acts as an electron donor.261,262
4.3 Antimicrobial applications
The antimicrobial properties of CuxO, in particular CuO, have attracted growing research interest. Nanostructured CuxO commonly offers a strong degree of chemical and physical stability. Most bacterial cells have cellular membranes that contain pores in the nanometer range. CuxO, with dimensions less than 20 nm, have shown antibacterial properties.11,263 The antimicrobial activity of CuO has been attributed to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as ˙O2−, ˙HO2, ˙OH and H2O2 which can also occur without exposure to any visible light owing to the small band gap of CuO.264,265 The generated ROS interact with outer cell walls to generate free radicals. The radicals penetrate into the inner cell membranes which lead to the disruption of the internal contents of the cell.264,265 The effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent appears to be related to the nature of the cell wall structures.263,265–267S. aureus is composed of multiple layers of peptidoglycan with numerous pores, which are suggested to be more susceptible to intracellular transductions. In contrast, the cell walls of E. coli are relatively thin, mainly consisting of peptidoglycan and outer layers of lipopolysaccharide, lipoprotein and phospholipids, which are less prone to being attacked by CuO nanoparticles. As a result, nanostructured CuO has a higher antimicrobial activity against S. aureus than E. coli.263,264
It has been demonstrated that nanostructured CuO antimicrobial activity can be enhanced by exposing it to light.11,264,268–270 As described in Section 4.2, light irradiation generates excited electron–hole pairs in the CuO and deactivation of the bacteria is possible via a photo-catalytic process.11,268 Akhavan et al. have reported an improvement of 22% of CuO antibacterial activity under illumination.11
4.4 Electrochemical applications
The electrochemical properties of nanostructured CuxO as electrodes for lithium ion batteries (LIB) have also been of growing research interest. CuxO has many attractive advantages over conventional materials including high theoretical capacity (>600 and >350 mA h g−1 for CuO and Cu2O, respectively) and low cost.271–273 One of the major issues with the use of CuxO in LIBs is its large volume variation during the Li+ ion insertion/extraction processes, which leads to severe mechanical strains and a rapid decay in capacity.271 Recently, there have been various reports demonstrating LIBs with high reversible capacity and cycling stability by synthesising CuxO/graphene nanocomposites.271,274,275 Mai et al. reported an excellent reversible capacity of 583.5 mA h g−1 with high cycling stability by incorporating CuO nanoparticles (∼30 nm) onto graphene sheets (Fig. 12a). The graphene sheets serve as a conductive network for fast electron transfer as well as buffered spaces to accommodate the CuO volume expansion/contraction during the Li+ insertion/extraction process.274

Nanostructuring CuxO into hollow nano/microstructures such as spheres, cubes or urchin-like structures increases its LIB performance.201,275–277 For example, Park et al. have successfully demonstrated that hollow CuO urchin-like nanoparticles possess a charge capacity above 560 mA h g−1 (Fig. 12b).276 Wei et al. have discussed and listed three main advantages of hollow structures as anode materials for LIBs.277 Zhou et al. have reported excellent LIB performance by integrating hollow nanostructures of CuO with graphene.275 The composites exhibited a durable lifetime with reversible capacities as large as 640 mA h g−1 (Fig. 12c).275
4.5 Electrochromic devices
Nanostructured Cu2O electrochromic based systems, such as smart windows and optical displays, have been studied since the 1990s.130 It has been found that Cu2O exhibits cathodic electrochromism, being transparent under visible illumination in their oxidized state and almost black when switched to their reduced state in the presence of an electrolyte containing positive ions such as H+, Li+ and Na+.130,278–281 Generally, it has been found that the electrochromic process corresponds to the conversion of Cu2O (transparent) to CuO (black) in a reversible reduction–oxidation process (redox).278,281 To date, the best coloration efficiency obtained by Cu2O nanostructures has been up to 37 cm2 C−1, which is only one-fourth of the best of those made from nanoporous WO3 (141.5 cm2 C−1).278,282 Unfortunately, nanostructured Cu2O requires high coloration voltage and shows poor stability,279 and further work should be carried out to solve such important issues.
4.6 Sensing applications
CuxO offers great potential for the development of highly sensitive, yet low cost sensors. This includes optical, gas and bio sensors. Photodetectors are important devices that can be used in various applications, including thermal imaging systems, free-space communications, navigator aids and ozone-layer monitoring.283,284 Among the semiconductor materials, CuxO has proven to be an attractive material for making photodetectors due to its relatively low band gap and remarkable optoelectronic properties.70,284–287
Sahoo et al. have demonstrated excellent performance of the photodetector based on Cu2O nanowires.285 They adopted the metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) technique for photon sensing under dark and illumination conditions. Fig. 13(a)–(d) illustrated SEM micrographs of four such MSM devices with channel lengths (i.e. spacing between the electrodes) of 210, 260, 580 and 720 nm, respectively.285 They observed that the channel length significantly influenced the photocurrent and the bias dependence of the photo-to-dark-current ratio (Fig. 13(e)–(h)).285 Liao et al. reported the photoconductivity of Cu2O nanowires measured under dark and blue (488 nm) laser illumination and the conductance of nanowires increased from 0.7 to 4.3 μS under illumination. Remarkably, the photoconductivity response time was less than three seconds with good reversibility and stability.70 CuO has also been extensively used in photodetector applications under visible and IR illumination (due to its relatively low band gap).284,286–288 Recent comprehensive reviews on the usage of CuO in photodetection are found elsewhere.1

The scale bars are 100 nm. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements are carried out at dark and under illumination conditions for all four samples.

CuxO also offers a great possibility for developing highly sensitive semiconductor-based gas sensors. The sensing properties of CuxO can be improved by decreasing its size to nanoscale dimensions (comparable to twice of the Debye length) and by adding appropriate dopants.126,289 Catalytic nanoparticles such as Pd,290 Pt,291 Ag292 and Au291,293,294 attached to the CuxO surface further increase its sensitivity, mainly due to spill-over effects.289 CuxO thin films have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive towards various gas species including C2H5OH,14,126,294–298 CO,296,299,300 NO2 (ref. 14 and 300) and H2S53,290,301 (Fig. 14).

The ability to tune the shape and dimensions of CuxO thereby creating superior chemical and physical properties can be exploited for chemosensors and biosensors. They also show unique surface chemistry, thermal and electrical properties and a high surface-to-volume ratio which enhance the sensitivity and response of electrochemical sensors.302
CuxO has been used as a working electrode in electrochemical based biosensors including glucose sensors.303 Most electrochemical glucose sensors involve the use of the enzyme glucose oxidase. However, the greatest drawback of enzymatic sensors is their lack of stability due to the intrinsic nature of enzymes.304,305 Development of non-enzymatic sensors, using CuxO as the working electrode, has been reported.305–307 Though non-enzymatic sensors are, by design, quite selective, CuO-based glucose sensors have fast response times, possess a high degree of repeatability and are extremely stable.303
4.7 Tribology and heat transfer applications
A large number of studies have reported that adding metal oxides such as CuxO in the form of nanoparticles to lubricants is an effective means to reduce wear and friction.12,80,308–310 The friction-reduction and anti-wear behaviours are dependent on the characteristics of the nanoparticles including size (mostly in the range of 2–120 nm), morphology and concentration.12 The colloidal effect, rolling friction effect, third body generation with nanomaterials and protective thin film formation mechanism have been proposed to justify the role of nanomaterials' anti-wear and friction-reduction properties.80
Wu et al. have compared the tribological properties of two lubricating oils (API-SF engine oil and Base oil) with CuO, TiO2 and diamond nanoparticles used as additives. They found that CuO suspensions showed the highest reduction of the friction coefficient (due to viscosity and rolling effect) and the worn scar depth (owing to reduction of shearing stress) as compared to standard oils without nanoparticles.12 The shapes of nanoparticles such as spheres, rods, sheets and wires play crucial roles in tribology in monitoring the friction and anti-wear properties. Recently, Gausian et al. have revealed that lubricity enhancement is attributed to the synergistic effect of uninterrupted supplies of CuO nanorods under contact surfaces and their rolling mechanism.80
In addition to the enhancement of tribological properties, nanofluids with dispersed CuxO nanoparticles have great potential for improving heat transfer especially in improving the efficiency of chillers, refrigerators and air-conditioners.81,310,311 Many studies have reported that mixtures with suspended CuO nanoparticles have higher thermal conductivity than the conventional host fluid.81 This is due to the thermal conductivity of CuO (76.5 W mK−1 which is much higher than ethylene glycol that has a value of 0.26 W mK−1). Lee et al. have compared the thermal conductivity of CuO and Al2O3 nanoparticles suspended in ethylene glycol and found that the thermal conductivity of the CuO suspensions is 7% higher than the Al2O3 system.312
4.8 Field emission applications
The field emission (FE) properties of CuxO are far less reported than other oxide materials such as ZnO, SnO2 and In2O3. Due to its relatively narrow band gap, nanostructured CuxO offers an attractive alternative to serve as a FE emitter.313–315 In a FE system the emitting capability is believed to be highly dependent on both the properties of the material and configuration of the cathode.34 It is known that materials with higher aspect ratios and sharp edges generally produce higher FE currents.55,313,315 Zhu et al. have reported FE measurements of CuO nanowire films with a low turn-on field of 3.5–4.5 V μm−1. They obtained a large current density of 0.45 mA cm−2 at an applied electric field of 7 V μm−1.314 Nanostructured Cu2O also exhibits relatively high FE performance. Shi et al. have demonstrated Cu2O micro-porous cubes with a low turn-on field of 3.1 V μm−1. They showed a high current density of 1 mA cm−2 at an applied electric field of 11 V μm−1.55 It has also been reported that Cu2O can be coupled with other metal oxides such as ZnO or TiO2 to enhance its FE performance (Fig. 15).315–317 This enhanced FE is attributed to the alteration in electron affinity of CuxO by the other metal oxides forming a nano-heterojunction.317 Additionally, the presence of the heterojunctions promotes charge separation, where the electrons move to ZnO or TiO2 and the holes move to Cu2O, which reduces the recombination of electron–hole pairs.317

4.9 Other applications
Nanostructured CuxO has also been reported for many applications other than those presented in Sections 4.1 to 4.8. Of note, nanostructured CuO has been used in ceramic resistors318 and supercapacitors.319,320 Nanostructured Cu2O has also been incorporated in memristors,321–323 heterogeneous catalysis,324–328 anti-fouling329–331 and thin-film transistors.2,332,333 Of course, there are other applications for which CuxO has been used, but these are beyond the scope of this review paper.
5. Conclusions and future outlook
In this article, we have presented a comprehensive review of nanostructured CuxO focusing on their properties, preparation, processing and device applications. An overview of the material properties, including crystal structures, electronic band structures, optical, vibrational, electrical, thermal and magnetic as well as superconductivity were presented. The effect of doping on the band gap and the enhancement in electrical properties was also detailed. Though much effort has been channeled in producing n-type CuxO, the reproducibility and quality issues of the generated films are still questionable. This is potentially due to strong self-compensation effects and dopant solubility issues when n-type dopants are involved. Clearly, these issues must be overcome before high efficiency photovoltaic devices, based on homojunction Cu2O devices, will be realized.
Numerous synthesis techniques were reviewed, focusing on methods that produce nanostructured CuxO. Different synthesis techniques provide flexibility within the constraints of any particular application needs. Therefore, it is essential that exploration of nanostructure CuxO synthesis continues and more innovative and low-cost routes are found in order to improve the future of the nanostructured CuxO and its many applications.
Additionally, we have discussed the major applications of nanostructured CuxO in optics, sensing, tribology, refrigeration, electrochemistry, photocatalysis, high-Tc superconductivity, electrochromics and antimicrobial devices. Due to the versatility of nanostructured CuxO, many more applications can be explored and are yet to be investigated.
To date, the majority of work in the area of CuxO has been devoted to CuO and Cu2O, whilst the number of reports on Cu4O3 are significantly lower. Despite the fact that there is a very limited number of reports available, the authors believe that the study of nanostructured Cu4O3 might provide possible new material insights and unique opportunities for incorporation into a wide-range of applications. Like other copper oxides, nanostructured Cu4O3 has the potential to be used in tribology and heat transfer applications as well as antimicrobial devices. As with the other copper oxide structures, the potential gains from developing a low-cost, nanostructured material, like Cu4O3 for any of these applications are extremely enticing and expected to be explored.
