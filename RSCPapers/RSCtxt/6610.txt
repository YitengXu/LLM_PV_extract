    , Accepted 30th July 2016First published on 1st August 2016AbstractThe stability of perovskite in humid environments is one of the biggest obstacles for its potential applications in light harvesting and electroluminescent displays. Understanding the detailed degradation mechanism of MAGeI3 in moisture is a critical way to explore the practicability of MAGeI3 perovskite. In this study, we report a quantitative and systematic investigation of MAGeI3 degradation processes by exploring the effects of H2O molecules on the structural and electronic properties of the most stable MAGeI3(101) surface under various simulated environmental conditions with different water coverage based on first-principles calculations. The results show that H2O molecules can easily diffuse into the inner side of the perovskite and gradually corrode the structure as the number of H2O molecules increases. As a result of the interactions between perovskite and H2O molecules, a hydrated intermediate will be generated as the first step in the degradation mechanism; the perovskite will further decompose to HI and GeI2. In terms of one MAGeI3 molecule, it will be dissociated completely to GeI2 as a result of hydrolysis reactions with a minimum of 4H2O molecules. In addition, the degradation of the perovskite will also affect the electronic structure, causing a decrease in optical absorption across the visible region of the spectrum and a distinct deformation change in the crystal structure of the material. These findings further illustrate the degradation of the hydrolysis process of MAGeI3 perovskite in humid environments, which should be helpful to inspire experimentalists to take action to prolong the lifetimes of perovskite solar cells to achieve high conversion efficiency in their applications.
1 Introduction
Over the past few years, the rapid increase in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has attracted great attention from scientists. Perovskites have emerged as promising potential materials in the photovoltaics industry due to their special properties, such as relatively low and tunable band gaps,1 excellent charge transport properties,2,3 and limited charge recombination for cell fabrication.1,4–7 To date, the highest efficiency of PSCs certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has reached 22.1%, which is comparable with that of thin-film solar cells containing copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), with 22.3%, and CdTe, with 22.1%.8 PSCs, with their features of simple manufacturing methods, low temperature processing and low cost, are superior to current commercial photovoltaic products.
In spite of the great improvements in the power conversion efficiency and fabrication techniques of PSCs over the past few years,9,10 one of the most important issues for the application of PSCs is long-term stability.11–17 Recent studies show that PSCs exhibit gradual degradation of their performance with time in humid atmosphere, resulting in short lifetimes and instability, which may hinder their practical electroluminescence applications.13,18,19 Previous reports have also pointed out that the efficiency of MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) solar cells will decrease by more than 50% after exposure to air for periods of 1 to 2 days.16,20,21 Recently, Christian's investigation showed that the decay of the absorbance of MAPbI3 film varied according to different relative humidity ratios; 25% relative humidity decays the film to half of its original value in 57 days, and 40% relative humidity in only 26 days.13,22 Seok and co-workers showed that at 55% humidity, MAPbI3 decomposed remarkably, with a color change from dark brown to yellow.12,16 Based on the above degradative results, several different degradation mechanisms have been proposed. Niu et al. have reported the that MAPbI3 can directly decompose to MAI and PbI2 components in water-containing atmosphere, and MAI will continue to decompose to CH3NH2 gas and HI.23–25 Yang et al. pointed out that MAPbI3 film will first form a hydrated intermediate, MAPbI3·H2O, and then decompose to a new hydrated intermediate, (MA)4PbI6·2H2O, and PbI2 in a high humidity atmosphere.13,25–27 However, Frost et al. indicated that when MAPbI3 film is exposed to a humid environment, the film will engender a [(MA+)n−1(PbI3)n][H2O+] intermediate and release CH3NH2 gas at the same time; then, the intermediate decomposes to HI, PbI2, [(MA+)PbI3]n−1 and H2O, breaking down the perovskite structures.11,28 Zhao et al. considered that MAPbI3 will first combine with H2O to form a hydrated intermediate, MAPbI3·H2O, which agrees well with Yang's work; however, Zhao proposed that MAPbI3·H2O will directly decompose to PbI2, MAI and H2O without the generation of the intermediate (MA)4PbI6·2H2O. Moreover, he pointed out19 that MAI can hardly further decompose to CH3NH2 and HI, which is different from Niu's result.23 In addition, Kim and Park indicated that increasing the relative humidity can lead to a decrease in the perovskite crystal size.29 The degradation of perovskite leads to a decrease in its efficiency, which restricts the outdoor applications of PSCs.12 The above investigations show that PSCs are very sensitive to moisture in the environment. Due to humidity degradation, Grätzel has made a suggestion that PSCs should be fabricated under controlled atmosphere conditions with humidity less than 1%.10,30
The effects of humid atmosphere on PSCs result in the degradation of their performance.13,15,16 To improve the stability of these devices, numerous groups have fabricated PSCs in dry environments to protect the perovskite film from water attachment.22 In this respect, Snaith et al. have recently reported that using P3HT/SWNTs-PMMA as the hole transport material (HTM) covering the top of perovskite films can effectively improve the stability of devices by reducing the contact opportunity of the perovskite film with water.31 They also indicated that substituting the MA+ cation with a C6H5(CH2)2NH3 group can also improve the device stability.32 A number of studies have found that replacing the spiro-OMeTAD HTM with inorganic HTM can also improve the stability of devices in humid conditions;13,14,33,34 Yang et al. employed carbon layer materials as HTMs to resist humid atmosphere and improve device stability, and they obtained a 12.3% efficiency.33 Some other groups have also indicated that CuI and NiOx inorganic HTM can also enhance device stability by controlling the water permeation.13,14,34 On the other hand, Niu and co-workers improved device stability by utilizing Al2O3 as the interfacial layer.23 Seok found that by adding Br to MAPbI3, a mixed halide perovskite can also be helpful to prevent the perovskite from degrading to HI.16 In addition to the abovementioned strategies, water-barrier layers, such as carbon-based electrodes, poly(methylmethacrylate), and oligothiophene derivatives have been applied to the fabrication of PSCs for the purpose of suppressing the degradation of perovskite.21,31,35–37
The above reports have demonstrated that the effect of water plays a crucial role in the performance of the widely used MAPbI3 solar cells. However, MAGeI3 perovskite has been less investigated than MAPbI3, although MAGeI3 shows comparable photovoltaic properties.38–40 Some arguments suggest that MAGeI3 is less stable than MAPbI3 when exposed to air.41–43 To date, the intrinsic mechanism of the interaction of MAGeI3 with H2O is still unknown. In this work, we studied the degradation process of lead-free MAGeI3 perovskite carefully in a humid environment. This work offers a description of the degradation mechanism under H2O molecule attack at the atomic level. We also provide detailed insight into the behavioral changes in MAGeI3 structural deformation, electronic properties and optical absorption when MAGeI3 comes in contact with increasing numbers of H2O molecules by first-principle calculations.
2 Computational details
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the projected augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the VASP package.44–46 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional47 combined with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) have been employed for structural and electronic calculations. In this work, the non-local vdW-DF method proposed by Dion et al. has been carried out in our systems to better describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions of the investigated perovskite systems.48–50 In this approach, the exchange correlation energy takes the form of the sum of EGGAx, ELDAc and Enlc. Here, the exchange energy EGGAx uses the optimized optB86b GGA functional;50ELDAc is the LDA functional for the correction energy, and Enlc is the nonlocal energy term, which can be obtained by using a relatively simple double space integration to approximately account for the nonlocal electron correlation effects. Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) relativistic correction has also been taken into account for the electronic and optical calculations. A 500 eV energy cutoff was employed to ensure an accuracy of 1 meV per atom for the energy. During the optimization, all the structures were allowed to relax, and the convergence criterion for the electronic self-consistent loop was set to 1.0 × 10−5 eV. The Ge 3d4s4p, I 5s5p, C 2s2p, N 2s2p and H 1s states were considered for valence configurations. Monkhorst–Pack grids of 4 × 4 × 1 were used for the structural optimization; k-point sampling with an 8 × 8 × 1 grid was employed for the electronic and optical properties.
H2O molecules were placed on the MAGeI3(101) surface one by one to explore the degradation mechanism at the surface. The adsorption energy evaluated for the surface interacting with different numbers of H2O molecules is defined as: (1)where EN×H2O/MAGeI3(101), EH2O and EMAGeI3(101) are the adsorption system energy, the energy of one H2O molecule and the energy of the clean MAGeI3(101) surface, respectively. N represents the number of adsorbed H2O molecules.
The optical properties were evaluated by the dielectric function ε(ω) and absorption spectra A(ω). The two parameters are calculated with the following equations: ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω)(2) A(ω) = 1 − e−α(ω)Δz(3)where Δz is the size of the unit cell. The real part ε1(ω) can be obtained from the imaginary part ε2(ω) with the Kramer–Kronig relation. ε2(ω) can be obtained from the summation over empty states.38,51,52
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Surface structure characterization
A range of stoichiometric surfaces for the trigonal R3m phase of MAGeI3 perovskite with low Miller indices, including the (001), (010), (011), (100), (101), (110), and (111) surfaces, was constructed to identify the most stable surface. The surfaces were constructed using a periodical slab of one-layer thickness, including 36 atoms, with a 40 Å vacuum layer in the z direction. To build stable MAGeI3 surface models, we firstly needed to ensure that the models were all stoichiometric, with the same chemical formula of MAGeI3 as the bulk; secondly, the numbers of broken bonds at the truncated surface should be minimized to lower the corresponding energies.
The stability of the different stoichiometric surfaces can be evaluated by their corresponding surface energies. The surface energies can be obtained by the following equation:53,54 (4)where γ is the surface energy, Gslab is the Gibbs free energy of the constructed slab, Gunit is the average Gibbs free energy per formulary unit of the trigonal MAGeI3 perovskite in the bulk phase, and n is the number of MAGeI3 units in each supercell of the slab. Considering the symmetry, each slab has two identical surfaces, and the single surface area is defined as A. The entropic and pV contributions have slight impacts on the free energy change of the condensed-phase species; therefore, the Gibbs free energies can be approximately calculated by the total energies (E) obtained from the DFT calculations. The surface energy γ can be expressed as follows:53–57 (5)It should be noted that the total energies of the different surface slabs are calculated strictly at zero temperature. The calculated surface energies of the different surface slabs by eqn (5) are shown in Table S1 of the ESI,† and the variation trend is shown in Fig. 1. It is clear to see that the (101) surface has the lowest surface energy, which means that the (101) surface of the trigonal MAGeI3 perovskite is the most stable low Miller index surface. Also, the (101) surface maintains the main framework of the bulk perovskite. Additionally, this surface can be terminated with MA+ cation or the GeI2 structure; the MA+ terminated surface is found to be more stable, with a lower energy. Next, we used the MA+ terminated (101) surface to describe the interactions between the surface and H2O molecules to explore its degradation reactions.

3.2 MAGeI3(101) surface/H2O interactions and degradation reactions
To obtain a visual description of the possible adsorption and diffusion positions of H2O molecules on/in the MAGeI3(101) surface, the simulated perovskite model was constructed with a periodical slab with a three-layer-thick MAGeI3(101) surface. A 2 × 2 supercell with a 40 Å vacuum layer was built along the z direction to prevent interactions with the adjacent supercells. The colored regions shown in Fig. 2 are labeled as regions O, F and S from top to bottom, respectively. Region O represents the H2O molecules adsorbed on the surface of MAGeI3, region F represents H2O molecules located at the upper area of the first layer, and region S is the location where H2O molecules can permeate the inorganic framework into the down side of the first layer. To better describe the adsorption system, we defined the structures as MN based on the adsorption position and number of H2O molecules, where M is the region (O/F/S) where the H2O molecules are located and N is the number of H2O molecules in the corresponding region. For example, the structure shown in Fig. 2 is labeled as O1F1S1.

The O1 structure with one H2O molecule adsorbed on the (101) surface was first investigated. The optimized geometry is shown in Fig. 3(b). The adsorption energy of the O1 structure is about −0.1 eV; the H2O molecule is adsorbed at 2.25 Å above the top I atom of the surface, with the H atoms pointing to the nearest I atom. The interaction between the perovskite and the H2O molecule occurs through the hydrogen bond connected with O–(H2O) and H of the nearest MA+ cation; the corresponding hydrogen bond length is 1.66 Å. These data indicate that the hydrogen bond is the vinculum for the interaction between the perovskite and water molecules.

As the number of H2O molecules increases, the adsorption energies decrease from −0.1 eV to −0.27 eV, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†); the variation of the adsorption energies as a function of N is drawn in Fig. 3(a). For the structures from one H2O to 6 H2O molecules, the variation of the corresponding adsorption energy shows a downward trend, as shown in Fig. 3(a); this is because the H2O molecules are evenly scattered on the (101) surface with low coverage, and when the number of H2O molecules increases to 6, the structure has the lowest adsorption energy, which indicates that the optimal number of the adsorbed H2O molecules on the (1 × 1) surface is 6. When N increases from 1 to 6, the interaction between the surface and the H2O molecules mostly consists of the hydrogen bonds between MA+ cation and H2O molecules. The hydrogen bond strength increases with increasing number of hydrogen bonds, which also facilitates the aggregation of water molecules up to its greatest adsorption limit per unit. When N surpasses 6, the adsorption energies are higher than that of the structure with 6 H2O molecules; it can be interpreted that when N is greater than 6, the H2O molecules will aggregate, forming water clusters in the located region by strong intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions, such as the O7 and O9 structures shown in Fig. 3(b). For N from 7 to 9, with the formation of the water clusters, the strength of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds will increase with increasing numbers of H2O in the clusters; this lowers the hydrogen bond strength between the H2O molecules and the MA+ cation of the perovskite, leading to an increase of the corresponding adsorption energies.
To explore the possibility of diffusion of the H2O molecule from the surface to the inner side of the perovskite, the process by which one H2O molecule diffuses from region O to the first layer of the perovskite was firstly investigated; the energy diagram is shown in Fig. 4. Here, two diffusion processes are considered. The first diffusion process is used to investigate whether a single H2O molecule can pass through region O to region F. As the results show in Fig. 4, the energy of F1 is −0.22 eV, implying F1 is more stable than O1 (the energy of O1 has been adjusted to 0 eV). The energies of O1 and F1 indicate that the H2O molecule is more inclined to stay in region F than in region O. The transition state TS1, with an energy of 0.09 eV, shows that the barrier for the diffusion of an H2O molecule from O1 to F1 is very small, which means that the H2O molecule can easily infiltrate into the first layer of the perovskite. This can be ascribed to the large interstitial space of the perovskite cage, as there is only one MA+ cation in each cage with a large space remaining. Thus, the H2O molecule can easily penetrate into the perovskite cage, conquering the weak resistance from MA+ cation. When the H2O molecule infiltrates into region F, it also has a small effect on the structure of the perovskite. This is because the MA+ cation closest to the H2O molecule has changed its orientation from the original, with a slant angle, to a vertical direction, while the positions of the other atoms basically remain the same.
 Fig. 4  Energy diagram for different states in the water diffusion processes from O1 to F1 and from F1 to S1. TS1 and TS2 are the transition states generated in the two diffusion processes, respectively. The inset images are the corresponding state structures. The energy of the O1 structure has been adjusted to zero. 
Since water can easily pass through region O to region F, next we investigated the possibility of the H2O molecule to diffuse through region F to region S. The energy diagram is shown in Fig. 4. In this diffusion process, the transition state TS2 shows an energy barrier of 0.43 eV, which is higher than that of the TS1 state. This means that the H2O molecule encounters stronger resistance to cross through region F to region S than from region O to region F. Relatively speaking, this resistance barrier is still not strong enough, which indicates that it is not difficult for the H2O molecule to pass into the inner side of the perovskite. Compared with F1, S1 has a lower energy of 0.27 eV, which means that the H2O molecule can remain in region S stably; the 0.27 eV energy difference provides a driving force to pull the H2O molecule into the inner side of the perovskite. The difference in the diffusion barriers from O to F and from F to S is due to the existence of the GeI2 inorganic framework in the F to S diffusion process, which is the major obstruction that the H2O molecule needs to overcome. For the diffusion process from O to F, the H2O molecule only has a space battle with MA+ cation, while in the F to S diffusion process, the H2O molecule also has an additional mission to overcome the interception of the GeI2 inorganic framework, which increases the difficulty of the water diffusion. When the H2O molecule remains in region S, there is a slight difference between the structures of S1 and F1. For F1, one MA+ cation in region F has changed its orientation, while in S1, the twisted MA+ cation in the F1 structure has recovered to its original direction in the O1 structure, as shown in Fig. 4. In addition, the MA+ cation closest to the H2O molecule in region S also has an orientation change, with a more steeply tilted angle than the one in both the O1 and F1 structures. The above analysis indicates that the H2O molecule has a remarkable effect on the surface structure of MAGeI3 perovskite.
Since one H2O molecule can easily diffuse into the inner side of the perovskite, as shown in Fig. 4, we further explored the effects on the surface with high coverage of H2O molecules. We placed the H2O molecules the same way as shown in Fig. 3(b), one by one, on region F until the number of H2O molecules reached 9. To predict which region the H2O molecules would be more inclined to stay in, the relative energies (Er) between the two systems with the same H2O molecules in region O and F were calculated. The relative energies are defined as: Er(N) = EF(N) − EO(N)(6)where EF and EO are the adsorbed energies of the systems with the H2O molecules remaining in region F and region O, respectively. With increasing N, the corresponding Er values are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The variation trend of Er with increasing number of H2O molecules is shown in Fig. 5(a). The values of Er are negative when the number of H2O molecules is less than 6 (N < 6), which indicates that H2O molecules with a coverage no greater than 6 can easily diffuse into the first layer of the perovskite with lower energy than in region O.
 Fig. 5  (a) The relative energy Er variation trend with increasing number of H2O molecules remaining between regions O and F. The values in the pink region are negative, indicating that the corresponding H2O molecules in region F have a more stable structure than in region O. (b) The optimized structures of typical systems with F2, F3, F6 and F7. 
As the number of H2O molecules increases in region F, the deformation of the perovskite surface is aggravated under the attack of the H2O molecules. Some typical structures with the attack of H2O molecules are shown in Fig. 5(b). The deformation is reflected in the movement of the MA+ cation and the destruction of Ge–I bonds. For the H2O molecules in region F, the perovskite surface begins to break down Ge–I bonds when three H2O molecules are aggregated. From the F3 structure shown in Fig. 5(b), we can see that two I atoms with the outermost symmetric positions deviate their original positions ∼2 Å away from the surface; one MA+ cation has moved out of surface farther than the I atoms. Moreover, three kinds of strong H–I hydrogen bonds exist simultaneously; the first kind is between the isolated I atoms and the neighboring H of MA+ cation, the second kind exists between the outmost H2O molecule and the exposed I atoms, and the third kind is between the H2O molecule entering the inner side of the first layer and the I atom exposed at the equatorial direction of the first layer. When the number of H2O molecules increases to 6, the deformation of the surface is more severe in the F3 structure; the O atom of H2O molecules strongly bonds to the exposed Ge atom, forming a Ge–O bond. Moreover, some of the Ge–I bonds connecting the first and the second layers of the perovskite are broken by the pulling effect of the water cluster on the first layer. The deformation of the surface is caused by the formation of hydrogen bonds and Ge–O bonds and the fracture of Ge–I bonds; the movement of MA+ cation and I atoms also accelerates the damage to the structure, leading to instability of the structure; therefore, its Er, shown in Fig. 5(a), has a positive value. When N increases to 7, the structure of F7 suffers the most serious destruction, and most of the Ge–I bonds in region F are destroyed; this is because the H2O molecules have taken over the interstitial space, driving the MA+ cations away from the surface. The interactions between the hydrogen atoms and the surrounding I atoms as well as the hydrogen bond interactions existing in the water clusters also have an effect on the second layer of the perovskite, resulting in the deformation of the inorganic framework and the movement of the MA+ cations in the second layer. The destroyed surface of F7 has the least stable structure, which is why it has the maximum Er value, as shown in Fig. 5(a).
The above analyses indicate that the exposed perovskite surface can be degraded by humid air; here, we propose the possible degradation mechanism for MAGeI3 perovskite under humidity exposure, and the decomposition pathways are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5(b), F2 retains an undamaged geometry; when N increases to 3, the structure begins to degrade under water attack, so the first reaction for the degradation of perovskite under humid atmosphere is to form a hydrate of MAGeI3 (reaction (i)): nMAGeI3 + NH2O → (MAGeI3)n·NH2O → (MA)4GeI6·2H2O(i)In this reaction process, the clean MAGeI3 surface can combine with H2O molecules, forming a hydrated phase of (MAGeI3)n·NH2O, (N ≤ 2) and acting as an intermediate in the decomposition pathway of MAGeI3 perovskite. A hydrate intermediate, (MA)4PbI6·2H2O, has been reported in MAPbI3 perovskite by Christian13 and Kelly26 during humidity investigations; meanwhile, Vincent58 and Christians13et al. have also confirmed the existence of (MA)4PbI6·2H2O hydrate with XRD experiments. Therefore, we speculate that there exists a possibility for the formation of (MA⋯H2O⋯MA)24+ dimers in the hydration process, combining with the isolated GeI64− octahedra to form an intermediate of (MA)4GeI6·2H2O hydrated phase. As Leguy mentioned in his work, the formation of (MA)4PbI6·2H2O is a reversible reaction.59 We also think that reaction (i) is a reversible process, where (MA)4GeI6·2H2O can transform into MAGeI3 in air with low water coverage.
At this moment, with one more H2O molecule to be adsorbed, the perovskite surface will continue to degrade with the release of CH3NH2 gas, as shown in the geometry of the abovementioned F3 structure in Fig. 5(b), and this process can be regarded as reaction (ii): (MAGeI3)n·NH2O + H2O → (MA)n−1(GeI3)n·(H2O)m(H3O+) + CH3NH2 ↑(ii) When the perovskite is exposed to humid air, more H2O molecules will be adsorbed and aggregated together to form water clusters, pulling the outmost I atoms away from the surface by strong hydrogen interactions, as in the F6 and F7 structures given by Fig. 5(b). The new hydrate generated in reaction (ii) will continue to degrade with the release of I atom in the form of HI; therefore, reaction (iii) can be expressed as: (MA)n−1(GeI3)n·(H2O)m(H3O+) + H2O → HI + GeI2 + (MAGeI3)n−1·m′H2O(iii)In humid atmosphere, the continuous adsorption of H2O molecules will continue the release of CH3NH2 gas, resulting in the decomposition of the perovskite surface with the duplication of reactions (ii) and (iii).
To precisely depict the above degradation mechanism, here we take one MAGeI3 molecule as an example to describe its decomposition pathway under continuous water attack; the schematic is shown in Fig. 6. From the F2 structure given by Fig. 5(b), we speculate that when two H2O molecules are adsorbed on the surface of one MAGeI3 molecule (Fig. 6, species A), the H atom of the H2O molecules will firstly bond with two I atoms of the MAGeI3 molecule by hydrogen bond interactions, forming a perovskite hydrate (species B). Observing the F3 structure (Fig. 5(b)), we find that the third H2O molecule actually attacks the MA+ cation (species C) and captures the H atom of the NH3 group, forming the hydrated cation H3O+, which occupies the position of the original MA+, forming a new hydrate (species D); the CH3NH2 gas is then released. When the fourth H2O molecule reacts with species D, species D is completely decomposed to GeI2 (species E). The above analyses indicate that with a minimum of 4H2O molecules, MAGeI3 is dissociated completely from one MAGeI3 molecule to GeI2 as a result of hydrolysis reactions.
 Fig. 6  The decomposition pathway for one MAGeI3 molecule under water attack. 
It is worth noting that our degradation mechanism is different from the mechanisms mentioned above;11,12,14,19,26,27 two different hydrated intermediates are generated in the composition pathway, which is different from the conclusions of Frost and Yang. The hydrated intermediates will decompose to CH3NH2 gas, HI and GeI2, which is not consistent with Niu and Zhao's viewpoints. Notably, our new degradation mechanism is of great significance for understanding the decomposition of MAGeI3 perovskite.
Based on the abovementioned degradation mechanism, we further explored the possibility of diffusion to the inner side of the first layer under the situation of surface decomposition with relatively high water coverage. The typical model is selected as F4, and the purpose is to explore whether one of the four H2O molecules can diffuse into the inner side of the perovskite from region F to region S. As shown in Fig. 7, in this process, the energy barrier is about 0.76 eV, which is higher than the barriers shown in the diffusion processes from O1 to F1 (0.09 eV) and from F1 to S1 (0.21 eV). This high energy barrier indicates that the H2O molecule must overcome more difficulties in the diffusion process. Firstly, the hydrogen bond interaction from the water cluster on the surface will impede the diffusion of H2O molecules into region S. Secondly, the distortion of Ge–I bonds in the equatorial direction also increases the difficulty of the diffusion. Furthermore, the structure F3S1, shown in Fig. 7, has 0.09 eV less energy than F4, which means that H2O molecules can diffuse from region F to region S during surface decomposition, resulting in a more stable geometry. For the F3S1 structure, the geometry undergoes some additional deformation in region S compared with the F4 and TS3 structures, as exhibited in Fig. 7. In the F3S1 structure, the Ge–I bonds in region S slant to the left, which is different from the F4 structure, where the same bonds slant to the right; additionally, one MA+ cation in region S rotates in the equatorial direction. These results indicate that H2O molecules can not only affect the geometry deformation in region F, but also have a destructive effect on the inner side of the perovskite. Our analysis also illustrates that the H2O molecules can corrode the internal structure of the perovskite once the perovskite surface has decomposed under humid atmosphere.

3.3 Impact of H2O on the electronic and optical structure of the MAGeI3(101) surface
Because H2O molecules have a great effect on the deformation of the geometric structures, it is necessary to determine what impact the H2O molecules will have on the electronic properties of the perovskite. To explore this impact, two kinds of slabs with different coverages were chosen for comparison with the clean MAGeI3(101) surface. As shown in Fig. 8(b), one kind is a slab with low water coverage, and the typical structures are O1, F1 and S1. The other kind is a decomposed slab with relatively high coverage, such as the O4, F4 and F3S1 structures, as shown in Fig. 8(c).
 Fig. 8  (a) Calculated band structure in Z to Γ to F of the Brillouin zone and density of states (DOS) for the clean perovskite (101) surface. (b) Band structures in Z to Γ to F of the Brillouin zone and densities of states (DOS) for the O1, F1, and S1 structures. (c) Band structures in Z to Γ to F of the Brillouin zone and densities of states (DOS) for the O4, F4 and F3S1 structures. The band gaps (eV) of each configuration are labeled with red data in each band structure, calculated at the Γ point. The dashed lines in the DOS structures stand for the Fermi level. The black curves in the DOS structures represent the TDOS of the corresponding structures. The blue, green and red curves are the PDOS of Ge, I and O (oxygen) atoms in the corresponding structures, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. 8(a), the calculated band and the density of states (DOS) structures show a band gap of 1.701 eV for the clean (101) surface. However, when one H2O molecule is adsorbed on the surface, the electronic structure undergoes large changes. Specifically, the band gaps of O1 and F1 increase to 2.04 eV, which are 0.339 eV higher than that of the clean (101) surface. Additionally, the two slabs show similar total DOS (TDOS) and projected DOS (PDOS) structures. This is because both the oxygen atoms have similar orbital contributions to the corresponding PDOS at the same energy level in the valence bands, with weak contributions to the conduction bands. However, there are still some differences between the electronic properties of O1 and F1, as shown in Fig. 8(b). On the one hand, the difference is reflected in the fluctuation of the energy bands, as shown in their band structures in Z to Γ to F in the Brillouin zone; on the other hand, the orbital contributions of Ge and I atoms to the valence and conduction bands, as exhibited in the PDOS, are also different, with different peak intensities, as shown in Fig. 8(b). These results indicate that for O1 and F1, the H2O molecule at low coverage will have an approximately equal impact on the band gaps; however, the H2O molecule will affect the orbital contribution strengths of Ge and I atoms to both the valence and conduction bands. When the H2O molecule is adsorbed in region S, the electronic properties are quite different from those of the clean surface and the O1 and F1 structures. For S1, in its PDOS structure, the energy level of the oxygen-orbital contribution appears to have an upward trend, and the band edges of both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) move to the Fermi level. This phenomenon indicates that the H2O molecule in the inner side of the perovskite will have a great effect on the electronic properties of the perovskite due to the strong internal hydrogen bond interactions. Therefore, S1 has a low band gap, with a value of 1.665 eV. The above analysis also illustrates that the position where the H2O molecule remains is an important factor to determine the electronic nature of perovskite at low water coverage.
Because one H2O molecule has a great effect on the electronic structure of the perovskite, we further investigated the impact that water at a relatively high coverage will have on the electronic properties of the decomposed surface. The typical models shown in Fig. 8(c) were chosen to investigate the band and DOS structures. Compared with O1 (Fig. 8(b)), O4 shows a lower band gap of 1.672 eV, which is also lower than that of the clean (101) surface; this is derived from the large deformation of O4 geometry. In addition, the oxygen-orbital contribution in O4 has increased strength and a wider energy range in the valence bands. When the four H2O molecules spread in region F, the band gap increases to 2.003 eV, which is also lower than that of F1. For F3S1, with one H2O molecule diffusing into region S, the band gap increases to 2.39 eV; the wide band gap means that it is not beneficial for the decomposed perovskite to act as a light absorber.
All the above analyses indicate that the H2O molecules will not only have great impacts on the structure deformation, but also on the electronic properties. The corroded structures show large band gaps, which are related to the structure distortion, and the breaking of Ge–I bonds will give rise to an increase in the band gap.60,61 Perovskite is known as a good light absorber with high efficiency, which is due to its appropriate band gap, while the embedded H2O molecule can disrupt the structure of the perovskite and increase the band gap, which may be one of the reasons for the decrease in its efficiency.
The SOC effect has also been taken into account for the electronic properties of the water-containing systems. The band gaps of the perovskites with different water coverage under different calculation methods are shown in Table 1. It is known that SOC will reduce the band gap by inducing a large splitting of the first degenerated conduction levels, while the results under the PBE-SOC method shown in Table 1 are slightly lower than those of the PBE results. Δ is the reduction of band gaps between the PBE and PBE-SOC methods, and its value is no greater than 0.18 eV. This result indicates that SOC has a weak effect on the electronic properties. The small reduction Δ derives from the weak SOC strength of Ge atom, which has been interpreted in our previous work.38

An additional advantage of perovskite is its wide and strong optical absorption ability in the UV-Vis. spectral region, where incident photons can be absorbed to promote the generation of electron–hole pairs. To investigate the effect of H2O molecules on the optical properties of perovskite with different water coverage, the same kinds of slabs used to investigate the electronic properties were adopted. The calculated optical spectra for O1, F1, S1, O4, F4, F3S1 and the clean (101) surface are shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Optical absorption spectra of typical structures adsorbed with different H2O molecules and in different positions. (a) Typical structures with one H2O molecule in different regions of O1, F1, and S1 compared with the clean (101) surface. (b) Typical structures with four H2O molecules of O4, F4, F3S1 compared with the clean (101) surface. 
In Fig. 9(a), the clean (101) surface has a strong absorption in the range of 180 to 250 nm and a weak absorption in the range of 300 to 500 nm. For O1, there is a strong absorption in the range of 170 to 200 nm, and the absorption intensity in the range of 300 to 500 nm is stronger than that of the clean (101) surface, which can be ascribed to the absorption effect of the H2O molecule. When the water diffuses into region F, the absorption intensity of the F1 structure is quite close to the clean surface. For S1, the absorption intensity shows a slight decrease compared with those of F1 and the clean surface, which can be ascribed to the fact that the interaction between the H2O molecule and the perovskite is rather weak; the structure does not suffer an obvious change after the water absorption. When the surface is exposed at a relatively high water coverage, as exhibited in Fig. 9(b), the O4, F4, and F3S1 structures show a stronger absorption intensity around 200 nm than O1, F1, S1 and the clean surface, which also supports the conclusion that the H2O molecules have a strong absorption in the range of 170 to 200 nm, and the increased intensity originates from the hydrogen bond interactions of the water cluster. In the region of 300 to 500 nm, as displayed in Fig. 9(b), the absorption intensities of the four slabs are in the order of O4 > the clean surface > F4 ≈ F3S1, which suggests that once the surface has experienced severe deformation and decomposition, the optical absorption of the perovskite will be greatly affected by water attack to reduce its absorption ability.
We also considered the SOC effect on the optical properties of the above systems; the corresponding absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). As can be observed from the two figures, the curves under the PBE-SOC method approximately overlap with the curves under the PBE method. According to this result, we may draw the conclusion that SOC has a rather weak effect on the optical properties of water-containing perovskites.
4 Conclusions
To explore the degradation mechanism of MAGeI3 perovskite under humidity exposure, the interactions between H2O molecules and the most stable MAGeI3(101) surface are investigated by first-principle calculations. The results reveal that the H2O molecule can easily diffuse from the surface into the inner side of the perovskite at low water coverage by breaking through the barriers of the GeI2 inorganic framework and overcoming the resistance of MA+ cation. When the perovskite is exposed at relatively high water coverage, the H2O molecules can corrode the internal structure of the perovskite by breaking down the Ge–I bonds. It is worth noting that the stability of the perovskite will decrease greatly with increasing number of H2O molecules. Furthermore, the adsorbed H2O molecules have a great impact on the electronic properties of the perovskite by pushing and pulling the band edges of CBM and VBM. More importantly, the deformation and decomposition of perovskite incorporated with H2O molecules also lead to a loss in optical absorbance across the visible spectrum, which is also related to the corresponding enlarged band gap.
Owing to the strong hydrogen bond interaction between the H2O molecules and MA+ cation as well as the I atoms on the first layer of the perovskite, a reasonable decomposition mechanism for MAGeI3 perovskite under humid atmosphere is proposed. Firstly, we put forward that a related hydrate compound can act as an intermediate in the decomposition pathway of MAGeI3 perovskite. Next, with the continuous adsorption of H2O molecules, the hydrate perovskite will decompose to GeI2, HI and CH3NH2 gas, thus disrupting the geometry of the perovskite. In terms of one MAGeI3 molecule, it is dissociated completely, as a result of hydrolysis reactions, from one MAGeI3 molecule to GeI2 with a minimum of 4H2O molecules.
The decomposition processes and degradation mechanism in a humid environment become clearer with our work; we believe this will be helpful to understand the corresponding experimental results for the problem of instability in moisture. We also expect that our investigation will inspire experimentalists to deep insights for possible solutions to avoid this degradation in their applications.
