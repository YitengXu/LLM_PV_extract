    , Accepted 12th November 2019First published on 12th November 2019AbstractArtificial photosynthesis is a promising strategy for converting carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuels through solar energy as it is clean, economical and environmentally friendly. Herein, we developed a selective and stable photocatalyst for CO2 photocatalytic reduction into C2H6 through a multi-electron transfer pathway without the external sacrificial regents. The core component of this composite catalyst was extracted from a silkworm excrement and modified to make chlorophyll Cu (Chl-Cu), which contained a porphyrin structure as an antenna for light absorption and a Cu cation as an active centre. We found that C2 hydrocarbons such as C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 tended to generate on chlorophyll-a/graphene. After substituting Mg2+ with Cu2+ cations in the centre of the porphyrin and modifying with graphene, only C2H6 was detected in the 18 hours reaction. This photocatalyst presented an outstanding activity and selectivity for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) with a C2H6 yield rate at 68.23 μmol m−2 h−1 under visible light irradiation and an apparent quantum efficiency of 1.26% at 420 nm. In this system, the porphyrin rings were excited to produce electron–hole pairs by light. The photo-induced holes oxidized water to produce oxygen while graphene worked as an adsorption centre and electron acceptor for the CO2 reduction.
1. Introduction
Synthesizing chemicals from CO2 by a photocatalytic process is a promising clean strategy for solar energy conversion into renewable and nonpolluting chemicals and fuels. However, at the same time, it remains a great and fascinating challenge to both scientists and engineers to realize practical and large-scale applications. Considering the increasing demand of energy and the environmental crisis, recycling CO2 into an easily transportable hydrocarbon fuel is beneficial to reduce the emission of CO2 and also partly meet the energy requirements in the current hydrocarbon-based fuel infrastructure.1 Since the first report in 1979,3 CO2 photoreduction as an artificial photosynthesis method has rapidly increased in the last decade, during which, many kinds of photocatalysts have been developed such as transition metal coordination compounds,2,4–6 organic or inorganic semiconductors,7–10 metal–organic frameworks (MOF),11,12,13–15 perovskite structure compounds,16–18 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks,19,20 and hybrid photocatalysts.21–23 These photocatalysts have been used in many works to receive high conversion rates and selectivity for the CO2 conversion.
Multi-carbon (Cx) chemicals are basic materials for the chemical industry. Many catalytic processes henceforth have been developed to convert single-carbon products (C1) into Cx compounds as a potential substitution for ever-decreasing petroleum resources as industrial chemicals.24–26 The photo-reduced products of CO2 are mainly composed of CH4, CO, CH3OH, and other C1 molecules rather than Cx compounds. If CO2 could be reduced directly into a Cx compound, the two separate catalytic processes, the reduction to one carbon compound and the further Cx conversion, can be effectively combined. These types of photocatalytic reactions are significant from the perspective of both energy and the environment. In some earlier works,27–30 the generation of Cx compounds was reported in the conversion of CO2 through artificial photosynthesis. In those studies, however, the Cx compounds were only by-products with a low selectivity, whereas the various C1 compounds remained as the main products. How can more Cx compounds be obtained by a photo-reduction strategy? Based on the analyses of dynamics, the Cx generation process should be a multi-electron transfer process, along with H2O oxidation.31,32 In addition, if catalysts can fix CO2 and the transient product firmly, the multi-electron transfer process will be promoted to improve Cx generation.
It was reported that porphyrins are efficient photocatalysts for CO2RR, which not only work as a light absorption center to generate electron–hole pairs but also simultaneously serve as a catalytic center for multi-electron CO2RR.6,12,33,34 Moreover, in our earlier work, we found that some porphyrins were decent molecular catalysts and exhibited a good selectivity for Cx products.34 Unlike nanoparticle catalysts that have an uncontrolled catalytic active center due to a great deal of surface defects, porphyrins are well-known single molecular catalysts that show a relatively good selectivity. Chlorophyll a (Chl-a), the most abundant kind of porphyrin in nature, exists in most plant cells and is the most important material in the natural photosynthesis to fix CO2 into polysaccharides in plants. Nevertheless, the de-magging reaction in acidic condition would take place on Chl-a after being separated from the plants. Luckily, it has been widely recognized that the stability of Chl-a can be enhanced through modification by copper. More importantly, Cu is a very efficient element for the CO2 conversion. It has always been used in CO2 electroreduction for decades and is a good catalyst for C2 hydrocarbon generation.35,36 Compared with inorganic catalytic materials, the electronic structure of organic molecules is relatively simple, which means less surface states and more definite active center. Based on the above analyses, it is feasible to achieve a highly selective and stable photocatalytic CO2RR by preparing Cu replaced Chl-a (Chl-Cu) photocatalysts.
In this work, Chl-a was extracted from a silkworm excrement and selected to combine with graphene as an effective photocatalyst (g-Chl-a) for CO2RR. Through a series of tests, three kinds of C2 products, namely, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 were produced with a relatively low selectivity and stability. Furthermore, in order to improve the selectivity and stability, copper acetate was used to prepare Chl-Cu (C55H72O5N4Cu). After the substitution of central Mg2+ in Chl-a by Cu2+ cations, g-Chl-Cu showed a greatly enhanced selectivity and stability for the sole C2H6 evolution with a production rate of 68.23 μmol m−2 h−1. The highly selective and stable photocatalytic CO2 reduction into C2H6 resulted from the synergetic effect between graphene and Chl-Cu, which acted as an oxidation and reduction center, respectively.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Reagent
Copper acetate, nitric acid (65 wt%), sulfuric acid (98 wt%), NH4NO3, chlorosulfonic acid (97 wt%), H2O2 (27.5 wt%), Na2SO4, ethanol, acetone, and 1, 2 dichloroethane were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. All of the above mentioned reagents were analytical grade, and used as purchased. The aqueous solutions were prepared with de-ionized water from a Millipore system (>18 MΩ cm).
2.2 Preparation of chlorophyll Cu (Chl-Cu)
A silkworm excrement (500 g) was soaked in ethanol with ultrasonic treatment to extract the chlorophyll (Chl-a) into ethanol. Then, the mixture was filtered and concentrated to get the chlorophyll paste. In order to substitute the Mg2+ by Cu2+, the chlorophyll paste was dissolved in an acetone solution of copper acetate (1 mol L−1) and stirred for 12 hours. After adding water and allowing to stand for 15 minutes, the organic phase was collected, and this procedure was repeated 3 times to remove the excess copper acetate. Through further purification by column chromatography, a deep green Chl-Cu was obtained.
2.3 Preparation of graphene modified Chl-Cu (g-Chl-Cu) photocatalyst films
The graphene sheet (GS) was prepared using the method in our previous work with the details described in the ESI.†34 Herein, a convenient film preparation method involving mist spray was applied. Typically, Chl-Cu (60 mg) was dissolved in a 100 mL solution (0.2 mg mL−1) of GS suspended in 1, 2 dichloroethane (DCE). Through a spray lance, the dispersion was ejected onto a 10 cm × 20 cm substrate (quartz or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film) held at 100 °C and driven by N2 at a certain pressure (0.4 MPa). Finally, in order to dispel the adsorbed solvent molecules, the prepared g-Chl-Cu films were dried in a 100 °C vacuum oven for 2 h.
2.4 Electrochemical measurement of the photocatalysts
The 1, 2 dichloroethane solution of the photocatalysts was dropped on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for modification and naturally dried at room temperature. A 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (20 mL) was filled in a Pyrex electrolytic cell and purged with Ar. A Ag|AgCl electrode and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Impedance measurements were recorded with frequencies of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000 Hz using a CHI660 electrochemical workstation to investigate the approximative conduction band of the Chl-Cu by a Mott–Schottky plot.
2.5 Experiment of photocatalysis
A double-faced photocatalytic film on 200 cm2 PET was placed in a one liter quartz chamber, which had valves on the gas circuit for gas feeding and evacuation as shown in Fig. S1.† This chamber was fixed on an on-line vacuum system, which possessed a vacuometer. This on-line vacuum system was connected to a gas chromatography (GC) system by a sample line. The total volume of the chamber and vacuum system was 1455 cm3. The photographs of this reaction system are shown in Fig. S1a & b.† The film with catalyst was loaded into the chamber, and then the chamber was sealed and evacuated before the injection of the reactant gas. An airflow of 99.99% pure CO2 passed through a de-ionized water container and entered the reaction chamber finally. In order to clear away the air as thoroughly as possible, these procedures for CO2 pumping and evacuation were repeated several times. The relative humidity of the CO2 and H2O gas mixture was controlled at 85%, while the pressure in this vacuum system was controlled at 98 kPa, less than atmospheric pressure. All photocatalytic CO2RR experiments were carried out under the irradiation of a solar simulator with a filter to cut off the ultraviolet light below 400 nm. The power density of light was 100 mW cm−2 as tested by an optical power meter (FZ-A, Perfectlight, Beijing China). The equilibrium temperature of the samples was about 45 °C (±5 °C) under the cooling of circulating water. Therefore, the product formation rates were not obviously influenced by temperature. The chamber was wrapped with aluminum foil to use the light more effectively. After a period of irridiation, 5 mL of the gaseous sample was transferred into the GC system through a negative pressure sampling system. Then, the sample passed through a valve block in the GC system and was injected into three kinds of GC columns with a flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) in parallel.
3. Results and discussion
After the purification of Chl-a was tested by a UV-Vis spectrum, the Soret band was at 426 nm and the Q band was at 661 nm, which was consistent with the standard UV-Vis of Chl-a. When the Mg2+ in the porphyrin was changed by Cu2+ to form Chl-Cu, the Soret band shifted to 414 nm, simultaneously, and the Q band shifted to 646 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a. It deserves to be mentioned that the intensity ratio of the Soret band to Q band for Chl-a is 1.4, while that of Chl-Cu increased to 2.3. The substitution of the central cation resulted in a stronger light absorption, which is beneficial to photocatalysis.

The Mott–Schottky plot for Chl-Cu was measured at pH = 7.0 (in Fig. 1b) to roughly confirm the band structure. The slope of the plots are positive, indicating that Chl-Cu is an n-type semiconductor.37,38 It means that in Chl-Cu, photo-generated electrons can be transferred from the porphyrin group to other attached molecules or materials, while holes remain in the porphyrin group to oxidize the adsorbed molecules (H2O). The ECB of Chl-Cu was −0.81 V vs. Ag|AgCl (−0.61 V vs. NHE) at pH = 7.0 (Fig. 1b) approximately; the energy gap of Chl-Cu was approximately measured to be 2.66 eV through UV-Vis measurements. Therefore, the EVB could be approximated to 1.85 V vs. Ag|AgCl (2.05 V vs. NHE). The redox potential of CO2/C2H6 was calculated from the Nernst equation and the Gibbs free energy of reaction, which was −0.50 V vs. Ag|AgCl (−0.30 V vs. NHE) at pH = 7.0. Comparing the energy bands of Chl-Cu with the redox couples of O2/H2O,1,9 it can be theoretically stated that holes on the valence band can oxidize H2O to O2, while electrons on the conduction band of Chl-Cu can reduce CO2 to low valence products (can be seen in Fig. 2a), indicating that photocatalysis can happen on Chl-Cu. Accordingly, the transfer of excitons from the chlorophyll antenna to the adsorbed CO2 molecules were proposed in the following route (Fig. 2b): (i) electrons were excited from the valence band into the conduction band of Chl-Cu by light, (ii) the generated electrons were transferred to the conduction band of graphene, (iii) the H2O molecules that adsorbed on the porphyrin group were oxidized to O2, and (iv) the transferred electrons reacted with the CO2 molecules adsorbed on graphene.

Because the specific surface area of the porphyrins in the solid state was small, graphene was used to interact with Chl-a and Chl-Cu as the catalyst carrier to form g-Chl-a and g-Chl-Cu, respectively.39,40 Moreover, graphene is an excellent CO2 adsorbent with a theoretical maximum uptake of 37.93 wt%.41 The conventional methods used to make GS by the reduction of graphene oxide (RGO) were not effective in producing defect free GS as the defects that already existed in RGO would be left behind in the end product of graphene. A trap level would be introduced into the band gap of graphene by the defects, which will be the traps for electron diffusion.22 Therefore, we developed a method to prepare graphene with a few defects and a high conductivity to achieve a high electron transfer efficiency. The details of the preparation are described in the ESI.†
For inspecting the quality of the prepared GS, a sequence of characterizations was performed (Fig. 3). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were employed to roughly assess the exfoliation state of GS (Fig. 3a), which clearly showed that the layers of the flakes decreased significantly in comparison to graphite (Fig. S2†). This confirmed that GS was successfully prepared by the proposed exfoliation method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were effective measures to confirm the number of layers. In Fig. 3b, from the high-resolution TEM image, we can see only a few layers in GS. In the corresponding SAED analysis (Fig. 3c), a comparison of the intensity of the diffraction spots from the planes (1−210) and (0−110) confirmed the number of graphene layers, which was a bi-layer. This was due to the intensity ratio of I(0−110)/I(1−210) being approximately 1/2.42 Furthermore, the SEM and TEM images are listed in the ESI (Fig. S2†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to inspect the chemical composition of the graphene sheets as shown in Fig. 3d. The oxygen ratio of the as-prepared graphene was 3.1%, suggesting that the exfoliation procedure introduced only a spot of oxygen. This was further confirmed by the C 1s XPS spectrum in the insert of Fig. 3d, where only a single peak associated with graphitic carbon around 284.5 eV was observed. Therefore, we concluded that this preparation procedure directly exfoliated graphite into GS without any oxidization processes.

The Raman spectrum is shown in Fig. 3e, where the 2D band (∼2700 cm−1) and G band (∼1580 cm−1) were obviously visible in the sample spectrum. Meanwhile, the D band (∼1350 cm−1) showed a weak signal, which was attributed to edge effects.43 The intensity of the D peak in the prepared GS was very different from the peak in RGO according to the literature, demonstrating that the preparation procedure used in this work did not introduce any epoxides covalently bonded and other significant structural defects into the basal plane.44 In the Raman spectrum of GS, the number of the graphene nanosheet layers was ascertained by the 2D peak.43 The as-prepared GS was a few-layer graphene (FLG) with a thickness of less than 5 base layers on the peak position and profile.43
After incorporating the previously prepared Chl-Cu with GS, the g-Chl-Cu photocatalyst film was made and inspected by SEM as shown in Fig. 4a and b. It was observed from Fig. 4a that the photocatalyst emerged as an incompact film that was favorable for light absorbance and gas adsorption. From the enlarged image in Fig. 4b, Chl-Cu attached on GS well and displayed a relatively homogeneous dispersion as marked in red circles. In order to examine the distribution of Chl-Cu on GS more visually, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping was performed as shown in Fig. 4c–h. The carbon element represents the graphene and carbon-containing group in Chl-Cu, and the N element and the Cu element represent the position of the central ring of the porphyrin in Chl-Cu. From Fig. 4, it can be better demonstrated that Chl-Cu attached on GS in a relatively homogeneous dispersion.

The as-prepared photocatalyst films (g-Chl-Cu or g-Chl-a) were placed in an enclosed quartz chamber to carry out this gas-solid photocatalysis. The samples were analyzed using a gas chromatography system equipped with three kinds of GC columns, one FID and two TCDs. The FID and column enabled the separation and detection of most hydrocarbons (HCOOH, CH3OH, C2H5OH, C2H2, C2H4, CxHy, etc.). The TCDs were used for the measurement of the carbon oxides and hydrogen. Standard samples of all potential products were used to identify the calibrations. The standard samples (1 mL) exhibited a steady retention time and peak area, from which the unknown samples were analyzed by these criterions qualitatively and quantitatively.
g-Chl-a was employed in the contrast experiments. After irradiation in CO2 and H2O vapor, the signals for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 were detected (Fig. 5a). The amount of product generation versus time during the photocatalytic reactions are provided in Fig. 5b, where the amount of C2H6 reached as high as 511.2 μmol m−2 after an 18 hours reaction. The average generation rates were calculated to be 4.06, 4.71, and 28.4 μmol m−2 h−1 for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, respectively (Fig. 5c). Though the yield of C2H2 and C2H4 were also detected, it is worth noting that the catalytic products of g-Chl-a were all C2 hydrocarbons, which meant that the porphyrin molecule in this structure was very beneficial for C2 production. Additionally, g-Chl-a was not stable in this system since the high concentration of CO2 led to a reaction of chlorophyll de-magnesium with the color changing from green to yellow after several days of the reaction. Therefore, g-Chl-a was not the optimal photocatalyst in this system and needs improvement.

In order to improve the catalyst properties, the Mg2+ in the center of the porphyrin molecule was substituted by Cu2+. The modified g-Chl-Cu as a photocatalyst exhibited excellent selectivity and activity for CO2RR with only C2H6 detected in the GC spectrum (Fig. 6e). The inverted peak corresponded to the un-reacted H2O. Fig. 6a also shows the yield for the hydrocarbons on the g-Chl-Cu photocatalysts. It was obvious that the average production rate of C2H6 was 68.23 μmol m−2 h−1. Our photocatalysts were superior to the earlier studies regarding the production where primarily nanoparticles were used (3.5–8.2 μmol m−2 h−1).22 Hydrogen was not detected in the GC spectrum, indicating that the amount of evolved H2 from water reduction was in trace amounts or it was not produced at all, perhaps due to the hydrophobic property of graphene. CH4 signals, the target product in some earlier studies, was not detected either (Fig. 6e). Other potential products as the reactive intermediates of CH4 such as CH2O (can be detected by TC detectors) and CH3OH, were not detected either. This exceptional result suggested that the photocatalytic process described in this work had an outstanding selectivity for C2H6. Furthermore, we measured the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of CO2RR on the basis of the ferrioxalate actinometer method. The AQE of the g-Chl-Cu samples reached 1.26% at 420 nm and the C2H6 yield was 0.77‰ after 18 hours of irradiation.

(f) 13CO2 isotope experiment for C2H6 analyzed by GC-MS. 
To confirm whether the products were generated through catalysis or decomposition of the photocatalyst itself, a series of control experiments were performed. The photocatalyst film was either irradiated in an enclosed chamber with a N2 or O2 atmosphere or was heated to 50 °C in a CO2 atmosphere chamber without light irradiation. No hydrocarbons were detected (Fig. 6a) in all of the experimental conditions after the 18 h reaction, indicating that g-Chl-Cu was very stable under light irradiation and the products were indeed from the photocatalysis. For the purpose of a deeper investigation, determining recycling times for the photocatalytic reactions is a good method to evaluate the stability of the as-prepared photocatalysts (Fig. 6b). No obvious deterioration in the catalytic activity was observed after 5 times, also manifesting the high stability of the g-Chl-Cu photocatalysts. Therefore, the UV-Vis tests used for the g-Chl-Cu photocatalyst film after the photocatalytic reaction proved the stability of the photocatalyst once again (Fig. S4†).
A control experiment was performed on Chl-Cu to investigate the role of graphene alone. As shown in Fig. 6a, no products were detected. As reported, porphyrins as the light absorber and photocatalyst have to contain donors to enhance the charge separation and transfer in a liquid homogeneous reaction.2,45 Therefore, in the absence of graphene sheets as a CO2 adsorbent and excellent electron transfer mediator, the photoreduction is difficult to occur. Additionally, as reported in literature, conjugated structure materials such as Nafion, thiophene derivatives, and g-CxNy all showed positive effects on promoting electron transfer, stabilizing the products in the transition states, as well as facilitating the generation of Cx organics either in electrocatalysis or photocatalysis.2,46,47
When the dosage of Chl-Cu was changed in the photocatalyst, the photocatalytic performance varied (Fig. 6c). When graphene was held at a constant amount of 20 mg, the amount of product increased with the increase in grams of Chl-Cu from 0 to 60 mg. This was ascribed to the increased photo-generated electron–hole pairs and active centers. However, when the amount of Chl-Cu exceeded 60 mg, the photocatalytic activity reversely decreased, which was ascribed to the agglomeration of Chl-Cu and the block in electron transfer to graphene. This proved the importance of graphene in this system once again from another perspective. Moreover, the CO2 sorption tests directly revealed the role of graphene on CO2 capture. The maximum CO2 uptake of g-Chl-Cu was ca. 37.5 cm3 g−1 at 25 °C as shown in Fig. S5,† with a high BET surface area of 75.9 m2 g−1. However, the Chl-Cu powder showed a maximum uptake of ca. 2 cm3 g−1 CO2 and a 1.5 m2 g−1 BET surface area (Fig. S6†). Concentration of O2 in the reaction chamber was observed to increase after photocatalytic reaction through the molecular sieve column and TCD in GC. The O2 to C2H6 ratio was close to the expected 3.5:1 stoichiometry after the 18-hour reaction (Fig. 6d). This confirmed that the water oxidation reaction also occurred on the photocatalyst, which consumed the photo-induced holes to realize sacrificial regent-free CO2RR. Furthermore, a 13CO2 isotope experiment was employed to directly confirm that the carbon source of the C2H6 product was from the CO2 molecules. Only 13C2H6 was detected when 13CO2 and H2O were the reactants (Fig. 6f), thus confirming that C2H6 originated from the CO2 molecules.
The three factors that in general influenced the photocatalytic process were light absorption, charge carrier separation, and catalysis on the surface. In our system, all three aspects were taken into account during the design of the photocatalysts. Chl-Cu was active in the visible light absorption, which enhanced the CO2 conversion to a certain extent. Graphene with less defects not only worked as an electron acceptor, but also provided a large surface area for the Chl-Cu distribution and CO2 capture as shown in Fig. S5 and S6.† Therefore, a decent photocatalytic performance resulted from all three aspects due to the synergistic effect between the two components (Chl-Cu and graphene). At first, the special structure of the porphyrin molecule (big π electron structure) in this composite system combined with GS by a π–π effect, which ensured a fast electron transfer from the porphyrin to graphene. Simultaneously, the central cations (Cu2+ and Mg2+) easily adsorbed the H2O molecules for water oxidation compared to the CO2 molecules as confirmed by our earlier work.34 Secondly, because Chl-Cu is an n-type semiconductor with suitable energy levels, the photogenerated electrons were transferred out while the holes were confined. This process was demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and steady-state PL spectra.48–52 The Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 7a & b revealed that after the Chl-Cu composite with graphene, g-Chl-Cu had a ten-fold resistance reduction in the equivalent circuit, which suggested that a lower charge-transfer resistance from Chl-Cu to graphene permitted a fast separation and transport of the photoexcited charges. On the other hand, the PL quenching of the composite was visible in the steady-state PL spectra (Fig. 7c). In this case, it indicated that an electron-transfer pathway from Chl-Cu to graphene was formed in a nonradiative quenching manner. Furthermore, the photocurrent tests on Chl-Cu and g-Chl-Cu explained this electron-transfer phenomenon more intuitively (in Fig. 7d). Before being composited with graphene, Chl-Cu showed a weak photocurrent signal. On the contrary, the signal intensity of g-Chl-Cu increased nearly ten-fold. Consequently, under light irradiation, the photoinduced electrons tended to transfer to graphene due to the relatively low energy barrier, which subsequently reacted with the adsorbed CO2 molecules on the graphene plane. In this case, this composite photocatalyst presented a decent productive rate and high selectivity.

C–C coupling into Cx from CO2 was a crucial reaction in the energy regeneration of CO2. Some research studies proposed a potential mechanism for the CO2 electroreduction. Some reports that supported this C–C coupling process complied with certain procedures of the Fischer–Tropsch catalysis (CO + H2 → CxHyOz).53–55 In this work, the photocatalysis was regarded as two processes, a light absorption process to generate electrons and an electrocatalytic process to use the excited electrons. Therefore, in this paper, the principle of CO2 electroreduction was borrowed to construct a possible reaction mechanism for transforming CO2 into a C2 hydrocarbon by the photocatalytic process. It was widely accepted that the production of C2H6 has two feasible base mechanisms. One pathway is through a COH intermediate, in which CO2 is reduced to –CH3 on the catalyst surface and then coupled to C2H656–58 as shown in Fig. S7.† The other mechanism is via the reduction of CO/CO2 dimer on the catalyst to ethylene and further hydrogenation to C2H6.27,58 However, the first mechanism is not suitable for our catalytic system for two reasons. First, it was confirmed that this process was not a one-electron reduction of CO2 because a formed CO2˙− by one electron is very disadvantageous (the first step shown in Fig. S7,† circled in a red square). The reduction potential of −2.14 V vs. SCE is much higher than the photovoltage of Chl-Cu (or Chl-a). The structural change from linear CO2 to bent CO2˙− at least requires an overpotential of 0.1–0.6 V in the rapid reduction procedure due to the kinetic restrictions.2 Secondly, the intermediate products in the first mechanism route are mainly CO and formic acid. The final product is mainly methane besides the ethane formed by the –CH3 coupling. However, in our experiment, no CO and methane were detected, suggesting that this mechanism was not suitable. Therefore, using the CO/CO2 coupling pathway, the proton-assisted multiple-electron transfer was a more favorable and alternative pathway to reduce CO2.46,53,54,59,60 The reaction result for g-Chl-a as a photocatalyst (a small amount of C2H2 and C2H4 were produced) was consistent with this mechanism because C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and C2H5OH were always present in the products on some metal or metal oxide catalyst through the CO/CO2 coupling pathway.59,60
In this artificial photosynthesis system, water acted as the electron donor (2H2O → 2H+ + H2O2 + 2e−; H2O2 → 2H+ + O2 + 2e−; H2O2 → H2O + O2; 2H2O → 4H+ + O2 + 4e−) and provided electrons. It also served as the main source of protons for the following CO2 reduction. In addition, water and CO2 suffered from competitive adsorption on the porphyrin center, which was mentioned in our previous results.34 Water has a larger binding energy and shorter bond length, thus showing a greater competitive advantage in combining with the central cation in porphyrin. Therefore, the H2O oxidation reaction occurred ahead of the reduction of CO2. In this case, this multi-electron reaction (H2O oxidization) was the rate-limiting step. Then, it provided multi-electrons and multi-protons for the subsequent reduction in one effort. Multi-protons are beneficial to decrease the reduction potential of CO2.46,59 Multi-electrons are in favor of C–C coupling.54,55 Accordingly, a drawing of the possible mechanism was provided by Amatore et al. The first steps maybe the formation of oxalate through the self-coupling of CO2 in the presence of multi-electrons and multi-protons.27 The generation of oxalate is a critical step in transforming CO2 to C2 compounds, the details of which can be seen in Fig. 8. The second step is the conversion of C2H2 from oxalate through a series of processes: dehydration of a vicinal diol, tautomerization of a ketone/enol, and dehydration of an enol. The last step is the reduction of C2H2 to C2H6 by a series of hydrogenation reactions.61–65 All of the intermediates were in the delocalized electronic structure as shown in the steps in Fig. 8. The intermediates were attached on the GS surface via a π–π non-covalent bond, which received the electrons uninterruptedly until they were reduced to C2H6. In addition, the electrostatic interaction, polarization effect, and charge dispersion effect strengthened the interaction of the intermediates and graphene,66,67 which further increased the stability of the intermediates.46,55 The reason why Chl-Cu showed a higher selectivity than Chl-a was attributable to the potential changes in the photogenerated electrons after Cu2+ substitution.54

4. Conclusions
In summary, converting CO2 to chemicals via a photocatalytic method can effectively reserve the solar energy in chemicals. Moreover, the possibility that CO2 can be photoreduced to Cx compounds by artificial photosynthesis will be of great significance in the future. In this work, the product of C2H6 showed a considerable amount by visible light irradiation. The presented photocatalyst demonstrated a high selectivity as well. The selectivity of the CO2 conversion to one product was only enhanced through controlling the electron transfer path by effectively combining the properties of Chl-Cu and graphene in this photocatalyst. The improved selectivity was obtained by coupling the component materials, which had proper structures and special physicochemical properties. A possible and rational reaction mechanism was proposed to interpret the multi-electron pathway, which provided a more efficient and selective photocatalytic CO2RR.
