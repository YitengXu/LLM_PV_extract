1. Introduction
Solar-driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) is a novel and efficient method to produce fresh water. Solar energy is utilized to heat a photothermal conversion material located at the air–water interface and localized heat collection is realized to generate steam, thereby reducing the energy loss, while increasing the energy conversion efficiency. SDIE has aroused great interest from researchers due to its advantages of green environmental protection, low cost and adjustable scale.1–3 In recent years, increasing types of photothermal materials (PMs) have been designed based on interfacial evaporation, mainly including natural products,4–10 polymers,11–15 carbon materials,16–21 and semiconductors.22–27 Besides, the functions of the developed PMs are becoming increasingly comprehensive, mainly covering long-term salt resistance,6,28–32 self-cleaning33–37 and collaborative power generation.38–44 Collaborative power generation occurs due to the upward flow of water caused by solar-driven PMs, creating concentration and temperature differences between the interface and the water body, thus generating electricity and water vapor simultaneously. Through continuous and in-depth research, SDIE technology has developed rapidly. These enormous efforts and considerable results may help solve the problem of freshwater shortage and wastewater purification and recycling for coastal residents in the near future. Nevertheless, the distance and cost of transporting seawater hinder the application of solar desalination technology in inland. Therefore, the direct conversion of wastewater into clean water may be an alternative way for inland residents to access fresh water. However, due to the problems of complex processes, high cost, and secondary pollution of existing wastewater treatment technology, it is notable to achieve the efficient and deep purification of wastewater using SDIE technology. Different from seawater purification, wastewater generally has the characteristics of complex composition, high pollutant concentration, strong biological toxicity, refractory degradation, and inevitably contains complex biological and chemical components, increasing the difficulty of its purification.
At present, many scholars have carried out research on water treatment using SDIE technology, mainly on the purification of simulated wastewater, and achieved some breakthrough results. These achievements are expected to replace complex wastewater treatment facilities, realize water recycling, and help better address the increasingly urgent freshwater shortages facing humanity. In the conventional seawater desalination process, PMs are mainly design to possess three basic properties, as follows: (1) excellent light-harvesting performance to absorb solar radiation in the full optical frequency range and convert it into heat. (2) Good pore performance, which can transport moisture quickly. (3) Ultra-low heat conduction, which can effectively reduce the energy loss caused by heat diffusion into water. Thermal management is essential to the performance of the SDIE. Optimized thermal management enhances the evaporation performance of SDIE by inducing more heat from the surrounding environment;45 furthermore, cold evaporation reduces the enthalpy of phase change, and the evaporation rate can be further increased with the aid of an atmospheric water collector.46,47
However, despite the continuous expansion of the application scope of solar-driven interface evaporation technology, it is still challenging to effectively prevent the degradation of PMs in complex and changeable water environments, especially when evaporating high-concentration saline wastewater or strong acid/alkali solutions. These challenges are mainly reflected by two aspects, as follows: (1) peeling of the light-absorbing layer. The light absorption layer of PMs is mainly obtained by dipping, adsorption, deposition, and chemical bonding. However, in a complex water environment, it is difficult for this layer to remain stable during long-term use and it easily falls off, which will affect the light-absorption efficiency and lead to the reduction of the photothermal conversion efficiency. (2) Corrosion of water transport channels. The water transport layer of PMs usually has a developed pore structure. However, seawater and sewage contain various acid and alkali salts. Thus, long-term immersion will lead to the collapse of the pore structure, decline in mechanical strength, reduction in water transmission speed, and lack of water supply, resulting in the precipitation of salts. The precipitated salt can block the steam overflow and water supply channels, and even cover the light absorption layer, seriously affecting the evaporation efficiency (EE). Therefore, enhancing the robustness and purification properties of PMs in complex water environment is a crucial breakthrough to expand the application field of SDIE technology. Herein, based on the analysis of the characteristics of PMs in water treatment applications, we discuss the purification effect of interfacial evaporation technology on different pollutants and summarize the practical development of SDIE, providing theoretical guidance and technical support for SDIE to achieve efficient water treatment.
2. Function of PMs of SDIE for water treatment
During their practical application, PMs are affected by the water medium environment. Thus, the preparation of robust PMs with excellent performance is very important for their practical applications. Specifically, robust PMs should exhibit salt resistance, acid and alkali resistance, bacteriostasis, algae inhibition, etc.
2.1 Salt-resistant PMs
During interfacial evaporation, salt tends to crystallize and block the channels and even accumulates on the surface of PMs, blocking sunlight and reducing the photothermal conversion efficiency. The salt resistance of PMs is not only the major obstacle in the application of solar desalination, but also the bottleneck for the development of SDIE technology. Thus, to overcome the salt deposition problem of PMs, researchers are focused on the development of salt-resistant PMs. At present, the main methods researchers use to solve the problem of salt deposition in photothermal materials are as follows: ① vertical multilayer channels: in the case of vertical macroporous materials, salt can be exchanged and refluxed in their channels, which can effectively solve the problem of salt crystallization in these materials (Fig. 1a). ② Janus structure: due to the hydrophobicity of the surface, the salt ions in solution cannot enter or pass through the material, thus achieving a salt-resistance effect (Fig. 1b). ③ Control of water transport with the assistance of an external force to enable edge-preferential crystallization and salt collection with the assistance of gravity.48 These strategies have been proven to be effective methods to solve the problem of salt resistance. Obviously, the improvement in salt resistance in these methods is mainly realized by salt reflux and externally assisted removal of salt crystals.
 Fig. 1  Reflux deposition of salt in evaporation system. (a) Salt convection in low tortuosity multi-channel PMs. (b) Salt convection in double-layer PMs. 
However, to solve the problem of salt crystallization, SDIE still has two common problems, as follows:
(1) Efficient PMs of SDIE depend on the synergy of light absorption, pore properties, thermal insulation and other factors, but the influence of these properties on the salt-resistance stability of PMs is still unclear. In particular, parameters such as pore size, curvature and porosity have an important impact on the design of salt-resistant PMs. Therefore, further in-depth and systematic analysis of the interaction mechanism between the pore properties of PMs and the law of salt crystallization is still an urgent problem to be solved in the field of SDIE.
(2) Changing the pore properties of materials cannot fundamentally solve the salt resistance problem of PMs because with the evaporation of water, the salt does not separate from the evaporation system. With the accumulation of salt, crystallization will gradually occur, which is a major challenge in the long-term salt resistance of PMs. Therefore, the further development of solar interface evaporators with long-term salt resistance is still a bottleneck problem to be solved in this direction.
2.2 Acid- and alkaline-resistant PMs
PMs are affected by the water medium environment, such as concentration, temperature, temperature change, stress change, and action cycles. On the one hand, in the absorption medium solution, soluble substances may be dissolved; on the other hand, the physical and chemical collapse of the pores will deform the structure of PMs and collapse their pores, resulting in a decline in the photothermal conversion performance. To continuously expand the application field of interfacial evaporation PMs, it is particularly important to optimize their acid- and alkali-resistance. Due to the inherent chemical stability of PMs, they can maintain stable properties even in strong acidic and alkaline environments. For instance, Pt3Ni–S-deposited polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) films exhibited stable evaporation properties in strong acidic and alkaline solutions, which was attributed to the excellent acid and alkali resistance of PTFE and Pt3Ni–S nanowires.49
Ying et al.50 prepared a flexible, floating and efficient SDIE device with a layered structure (NiCoxSy-PANI@GF). Under 1 kW m−2 irradiation (the solar radiation intensity not specially marked below is 1 kW m−2 irradiation by default), the evaporation rate (ER) of NiCoxSy-PANI@GF was 1.30 kg m−2 h−1. After soaking in acid (pH = 1) and alkaline (pH = 14) solution for 1 week, the material still maintained structural stability without any corrosion. The pH of the collected purified water meets the drinking water standard. Zhang et al.51 prepared a hydrophobic porous carbon nanofiber (HPCNF) membrane. In acidic (pH = 3) and alkaline (pH = 12) brine, the ER of the HPCNF was maintained at 1.42–1.43 kg m−2 h−1, which was almost the same as that in seawater (1.43 kg m−2 h−1). More importantly, the absorber had excellent corrosion and salt rejection properties, allowing it to remain stable over time and under a variety of complex conditions. Wei et al.52 designed a stable and effective solar evaporator with natural sugar cane as the raw material using sulfuric acid hydrothermal reaction to dehydrate sucrose into carbon particles. The ER of the sulfuric acid hydrothermal-carbonized sugarcane (SHCSC) was 2.32 kg m−2 h−1. In 1 M H2SO4 or NaOH wastewater, the ER of SHCSC was maintained at 2.2 kg m−2 h−1. Xu et al.53 reported the preparation of self-healing hydrophilic porous photothermal membranes (PU20/CB0.5/NaCl5 membranes), which exhibited an ER of 1.68 kg m−2 h−1. After soaking in 1 wt% CH3COOH (pH = 2.8) and 1 wt% Na2CO3 (pH = 11.7) solution for 10 days, the porous structure of the material was stable. This proved that the film has excellent corrosion resistance. Even more exciting, Bai et al.54 prepared PMs with super hydrophilic properties using commercial black sponges (NBS). The ERs of NBS were 2.22, 2.53 and 2.72 kg m−2 h−1 in 1 M NaOH, 0.5 M H2SO4 and seawater. NBS set the record for the highest ER of highly corrosive solutions. Therefore, superhydrophilic sponge has great potential for industrial applications related to the utilization of solar energy in water evaporation in different complex environments.
Acid- and alkaline-resistant PMs have great industrial application potential in interfacial evaporation and water purification in complex environments. More basic test data for acid- and alkali-resistant PMs are shown in Table S1.†
2.3 Bacteriostasis and algal inhibition PMs
In the evaporation process, the interface temperature of PMs is generally 30–40 °C, which provides favorable conditions for the growth of bacteria and algae. In this humid and warm environment, the biological pollution and corrosion of PMs are common and inevitable, especially in natural water (reservoirs, salt lakes, rivers, sewage pools, etc.).
The accumulation of various organisms (bacteria, fungi, algae, plants, etc.) causes the deformation of the structure of PMs, which ultimately shortens the service life of SDIE. Therefore, the growth and adhesion of bacteria and algae must be prevented during water purification. Researchers mainly used Escherichia coli,55–67Staphylococcus aureus,56–58,61,62,64,65,68Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus stearothermophilus67 and natural water bacterial colonies to test the bacteriostasis of PMs. Diatom and filamentous algae were used to test the algae inhibition of PMs (Table S2†). To enable PMs to have bacteriostasis and algae inhibition effects, researchers have developed many innovative design ideas and methods.

2.3.1 Steam sterilization. 
High-temperature steam sterilization not only can destroy bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms, but also has a lethal effect on spores and spores. Thus, researchers used the high-temperature steam from SDIE for effective sterilization.60,69–72 Zhang et al.69 proposed a new steam sterilization method through interface evaporation, which does not require complex system design to withstand high steam pressure. In this system, a reduced GO/polytetrafluoroethylene composite film acted as the photothermal conversion medium, which could produce steam higher than 120 °C to achieve the sterilization effect (Fig. 2a).

Wu et al.71 reported the preparation of a vertically oriented graphene nanosheet and porous graphene aerogel (VG/GA) material to achieve an ultrafast solar thermal response (169.7 °C temperature rise within 1 s). VG/GA was tested for medical sterilization based on the thermal localization design, and it was found that the generated high-temperature steam could successfully inactivate the standard commercial biological indicators. Zhu's team72 developed a low-cost steam sterilization system using SDIE. The ER of the SDIE system was 1.21 kg m−2 h−1. The spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (CC09) were applied as biological indicators, and the log removal efficiency (LRE) for all the target bacteria was close to 8, which is higher than the widely accepted medical device sterilization requirement of LRE = 6.


2.3.2 Oxidative stress sterilization. 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause oxidative damage to bacterial cells or denature biomolecules in bacteria, thereby repressing bacterial proliferation and growth. PMs can generate ROS by themselves58,64 or induce ROS production under photocatalysis,73,74 and then enhance antibacterial properties by stimulating oxidative stress on bacterial surfaces.75 For instance,74 AIE luminescent agents were introduced in the designed evaporator, which easily and continuously generated ROS under sunlight, and thus the evaporator could inhibit the adhesion and proliferation of microorganisms on the nanofibers, thereby achieving a good antibacterial effect (Fig. 2b). The authors utilized SDIE to purify wastewater containing 4 types of bacteria (MRSA, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. coli). No bacterial propagation was observed in condensed water, and the ER was 3.6 kg m−2 h−1, indicating that the evaporator achieved both efficient SDIE and antibacterial pollution effects. This design is currently a classic among the high-efficiency evaporators with an antibacterial effect.


2.3.3 Cationic fixed sterilization. 
Under neutral conditions, the surface of bacteria is generally negatively charged. These negatively charged bacteria are attracted to cations on materials, which can suppress their activities, inhibit their energy supply, and ultimately kill them. Wang et al.76 synthesized a cationic chitosan derivative HACC, whose cationic groups were electrostatically attracted by the negatively charged components on the bacterial surface (cell wall and outer cell membrane). The electrostatic interactions led to hydrolysis of the peptidoglycans in the cell wall, which in turn result in the leakage of intracellular components (Fig. 2c), preventing microbial spread on its surface. Peng et al.62 developed cationic photothermal hydrogels (CPS). The cationic N+ in the CPS interacted with the negative charges on the surface of bacteria, inactivating the cell membrane. The bacterial surface was damaged to varying degrees, and almost all the Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were killed. Li et al.73 deposited polyethyleneimine (PEI)-grafted MoS2 porous nanoflowers on a hydrophilic mixed cellulose ester substrate to construct a photothermal film, which could be utilized for interfacial evaporation. MoS2 could generate ROS, which caused thermal damage to bacteria. MoS2 still exhibited a photothermal synergistic antibacterial effect even at a lower solar illumination (1 sun) intensity. Simultaneously, the cations in PEI could replace the calcium and magnesium ions and attract negative charges on the bacterial surface, resulting in a loss in bacterial membrane integrity and bacterial death.


2.3.4 Metal ion contact reaction sterilization. 
Metal ion sterilization is the most common method employed for the sterilization of inorganic bacteriostatic agents. Metal ions penetrate the cell membrane of bacteria and react with the amino groups on their proteins. The active center of cell synthase is composed of amino, hydroxyl and other functional groups. After binding with metal ions, the structure of the active center of the protein is destroyed, killing microorganisms or causing them to lose their fission reproduction ability. Among the metal ions, Ag+ has the strongest antibacterial activity, which can kill bacteria or disable their ability to reproduce by destroying their DNA or proteins.59,64–66,77,78 Li et al.77 formed an SDIE with a photocatalytic effect by loading Ag+ on pumice stones. In addition, Ag+ could effectively suppress the reproduction of E. coli. In particular, the PMs could also repress the growth of algae in water and improve the water environment (Fig. 2d).


2.3.5 Other bacteriostatic methods. 
The rough sharp edges of MXene nanosheets cause physical stress and damage to bacterial membranes (Fig. 2e).56 When 2D MXene nanosheets contact bacteria, they can penetrate the bacterial cell membrane due to their exposed sharp edges.66 During evaporation, bacteria are filtered and left in the water. Even super high numbers of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus of 106 could be completely retained when passing through the equipment.57 During the evaporation process, S. aureus cannot pass through the filter membrane and CZTSe, which is likely filtered and retained in the water.68 Through solar-driven interfacial evaporative distillation, the retention rate of E. coli can reach more than 99.9% even at an ultra-high number of 106.63

2.4 Inactivation of viruses and parasites by PMs
The inactivation principle and effect of solar-driven interfacial evaporation on viruses and parasites is similar to that for bacteria. In comparison with traditional and complex processing technologies, solar-driven interface evaporation technology displays outstanding advantages, such as low cost, convenience, and good performance, and can be applied to areas with harsh living conditions and poor sanitary environments.
The Janus membrane designed by Zhao et al.55 had low thermal conductivity and high thermal diffusivity, and pollutants (such as organic dyes, heavy metal ions and pathogens) were almost completely eliminated after purification. Because of its advantages in water purification, this membrane can potentially be used to obtain clean water in underdeveloped areas. Based on this study, Saleque et al.79 proposed a low-cost sterilization PM (MWCNT-HfTe2@Cu) with broadband solar absorption. The steam temperature generated by MWCNT-HfTe2@Cu in a confined space could reach 77.9 °C. While heat inactivates a variety of bacteria, it also inactivates viruses (adenovirus 5, coxsackievirus B4, coxsackievirus B5, echovirus 6, echovirus 6, and poliovirus 1) and parasites commonly found in medical devices. The steam temperature at 660 s and 1180 s increased to 99 °C and 132 °C under 1.5 kW m−2, respectively. In addition, the disinfection system could be utilized at night or on cloudy days by simply adding 300 W photovoltaic panels and 200 Ah 12 V lead–acid batteries. These conclusions provide a solid theoretical basis for the application and promotion of SDIE technology for water treatment.
In the field of water treatment, the PMs applied in natural water purification should not pollute the water itself. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the toxicity, chemical stability, structural stability and other issues of the material itself. PMs need to maintain an efficient ER, while adapting to the water environment, which is an urgent bottleneck that needs to be overcome for the promotion and application of SDIE technology.
3. Removal of the pollutants from water by SDIE
SDIE technology can effectively remove pollutants in water. Water pollutants can cause a deterioration of water quality, biological communities in water, and water sediment quality. Herein, pollutants are classified from the perspective of environmental chemistry, and the research progress of SDIE technology in the removal of target pollutants is introduced (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagram of the removal of the main pollutants from wastewater by SDIE. 
3.1 Ionic wastewater
A large amount of ionic wastewater is produced in the chemical industry, metallurgy, and mineral mining and processing. SDIE uses local high-temperature to make water evaporate rapidly into steam, realizing the separation of water and salt to obtain clean fresh water. After comparative analysis from the perspectives of desalination efficiency, energy consumption, process cost, and scope of application, it was unveiled that SDIE technology is pollution-free, safe, stable and reliable and does not consume conventional energy, indicating that it has unique application advantages. Thus, the use of SDIE to purify ion-containing wastewater is increasing, and the purification methods and effects are constantly being optimized and improved. According to the different target pollutants to be purified, the existing research results are summarized in Table 1.

3.1.1 Conventional metal ions. 
The conventional metal ions mainly include K+, Ca2+, Na+, and Mg2+, which are the most basic cations that need to be removed in SDIE using PMs and are basic factors to be investigated for water purification by PMs (Fig. 4a). In the various reports in the literature, the removal of conventional metal ions by PMs mainly relies on solar-driven interfacial evaporation–condensation. The removal efficiency of this method for conventional metal ions can reach more than 99.9%, and the purified water meets the various drinking water standards. However, in the process of purifying conventional metal ions, the problem of the crystal accumulation of salts needs to be considered.

3.1.2 Heavy metal ions. 
The rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental problems, especially water pollution, becoming increasingly serious. Heavy metal pollution is one of the most crucial factors causing water pollution, mainly referring to the pollution caused by ionic heavy metals and their chemical compounds. Heavy metal ions in water can accumulate in animals through enrichment in the food chain, thereby causing persistent harm to humans at the top of the food chain and inducing a variety of diseases. Accordingly, exploring the removal of heavy metals in water is an effective means to ensure water safety and improve the reuse of water resources. With the development of SDIE technology, an increasing number of studies have been conducted on the removal of heavy metal ions in wastewater applying solar evaporators. The purification of heavy metal ions using PMs mainly relies on solar energy-driven interface evaporation–condensation, adsorption and their synergistic effect. For the evaporation–condensation process to remove heavy metal ions, the main mechanism is that, compared with water, heavy metal ions are difficult to evaporate, and thus the heavy metals are trapped in the water and photothermal materials upon evaporation.49 In the case of adsorption, the chemical properties of the material itself and its unique microstructure provide adsorption sites for adsorption. In the literature, most reports focused on the removal of six elements including Cr3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ in water. The SDIE test data for removal of the heavy metals are shown in Table S3.†
Ming et al.70 designed a floating GO/MXene aerogel (GMA) with an ER of 1.27 kg m−2 h−1, and the independent interface solar evaporator based on GMA-3 was proven to be able to conduct overall multi-functional purification of wastewater contaminated by inorganic ions, organic dyes, bacteria and oil substances for all-round water remediation. The removal efficiency of 7 types of ions (Mn6+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Fe2+) reached 99.9%. Xu et al.95 designed a flexible carbon cloth nanocomposite (CC-BPHPLS), which exhibited an ER of 1.42 kg m−2 h−1. CC-BPHPLS was revealed to exhibit an interception rate for 7 types of ions including Cr3+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Ag+, Pb2+, Cu2+ and Pd2+ in heavy metal-contaminated water of close to 100% after solar thermal evaporation and collection.
Huang et al.100 demonstrated a multi-functional carbon hybrid aerogel (CHA) as an SDIE, which exhibited an ER of 2.1 kg m−2 h−1. More importantly, CHA possessed a strong adsorption and retention effect, which could effectively purify various pollutant ion concentrations and cause a decrease in 12 types of ions (Fe3+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Al3+, Se2+, Mn2+, Sn4+, V5+ and Li+) by 3 orders of magnitude. The synergistic vaporization and adsorption by CHA is the current application example of SDIE technology. Guo et al.85 construct a type of hybrid hydrogel SDIE (HHEs), where the ER of HHEs could reach 3.2 kg m−2 h−1. The hydroxyl groups in HHEs formed hydrogen bonds and chelate bonds, which could effectively remove 11 types of common heavy metal ions (Fig. 4b). The remarkable purification capacity of HHEs shows great potential in various practical applications.
Li et al.6 reported the preparation of biomass aerogels (C-CSMCA and C-CSOMCA) with low-curvature pore structures using an ionic liquid-assisted arrangement of oxidized microcrystalline and microcrystal cellulose for SDIE. The maximum ER of these biomass aerogels was 1.44 kg m−2 h−1. More importantly, only 0.1 g of the sample was put in 20 mL mixed heavy metal solution (Cu2+, Cr6+, Zn2+: 400 mg L−1) and stirred for 12 h, playing a prominent role in removing heavy metals. The carboxyl groups in oxidized microcrystalline cellulose have significant removal effects on heavy metals and dyes; meanwhile, the layered pores of C-CSOMCA provide adsorption sites.


3.1.3 Inorganic anions. 
Generally, a variety of inorganic anions exist in industrial wastewater, which can affect the generation of carboxyl radicals in the process of water treatment, thereby affecting the treatment effect. Besides, some inorganic anions cause diseases in humans. For instance, excessive fluoride in the body can cause dental fluorosis, bone fluorosis and other diseases. Therefore, it is important to discuss the removal efficiency of inorganic anions in sewage in practical applications.
Chen et al.153 used the East China Sea as the water source, and the concentrations of the Cl−, Br−, NO3−, SO42− anions in freshwater collected by interfacial evaporation were prominently reduced to 0.032–3.56 mg L−1. Yang et al.152 and Li et al.128 conducted a desalination experiment on seawater from the East China Sea, where the concentration of various anions was reduced to less than 1.0 mg L−1 after desalination.
Using water from the Yellow Sea of China, many researchers have applied SDIE to conduct purification tests for different anions. Dong et al.148 removed 99.9% of Cl− and SO42− ions in seawater from the Yellow Sea. Zhu et al.143 used carbonized white radish for seawater desalination and measured the ion concentration before and after desalination. It was displayed that the concentration of anions (Cl−, SO42−, NO3−, Br−, and F−) was remarkably reduced by several orders of magnitude (Fig. 4c).
In addition, Sun et al.150 used multi-walled CNT and titanium dioxide by conventional photothermal coating for SDIE. The ER of Mcnt-TiO2 was 2.48 kg m−2 h−1 under sunlight. The evaporation test was carried out using seawater from Bohai Sea in China, and the content of Cl− and Br− measured after evaporation met the standard of seawater desalination. Pham et al.149 fabricated a bioinspired PM by sputtering copper layers on plant leaves, finding that its EE was 83.7% and ER was 1.45 kg m−2 h−1. Then, desalination experiments were carried out on seawater from the Vietnam Sea, and it was determined that the concentration of anions (Cl−, SO42−, and NO3−) was reduced by more than 99.99% after purification. Anions such as F−, Br−, NO3−, and SO42− in the condensed water obtained by Kong et al.147 using a GM aerogel as the PM were almost completely removed.

3.2 Dye wastewater
Dye wastewater generally has chemical stability and anti-degradation properties, which reduce the transparency of water, thereby affecting the photosynthesis in aquatic plants and resulting in a reduction in dissolved oxygen in the water. In addition, dyes can be extremely harmful to water and aquatic organisms after being discharged into water and have carcinogenic or teratogenic effects on animals and humans.
Organic dye removal methods include evaporative retention, photocatalytic degradation, catalytic reduction and adsorption. Among the methods for the treatment of dye wastewater, the adsorption method, which is simple, efficient, low-cost, and suitable for the removal of most dyes, is the most studied method. With the progression of SDIE technology, the coupling effect of SDIE adsorption can effectively improve the treatment effect on dye wastewater. The relevant experimental data for the removal of dyes by SDIE are summarized in Table 2.

3.3 Volatile organic compound (VOS) wastewater
Wastewater containing VOCs is usually toxic and harmful to humans. When using SDIE to purify wastewater containing VOCs, due to the photothermal conversion effect, the interfacial temperature of water rises locally, and VOCs are easily transferred to the distillate water during evaporation, affecting the water purification effect. Therefore, it is difficult to purify VOC-containing wastewater by SDIE.
Ma et al.213 designed a PM (ZSG) with high Fenton catalytic activity. The high Fenton catalytic activity of ZSG promoted the generation of –OH, which degrades substances such as phenol of volatile organic solvents in situ, thereby helping to obtain clean fresh water. The ER of ZSG reached 1.53 kg m−2 h−1.
Qi et al.214 prepared a polypyrrole membrane with a micro-pyramid structure (MPS-PPy) via template-assisted electropolymerization (Fig. 5a). The membrane had a selective permeation function for water and volatile organic compounds and could intercept 90% of volatile organic compounds during the evaporation process, which was practically applied in the Songhua River. Deng et al.215 developed a dual-function microreactor for simultaneous SDIE and VOC removal. The ER of the microreactor was 37.0 kg m−2 h−1 and the EE was 91.2% under 25.5 kW m−2. With phenol, quinolones and aniline as probe pollutants, the VOC removal rate reached 80.9% after evaporation for 40 min (Fig. 5b).

Yan et al.216 designed a reduced GR/PPy mixed aerogel. The π–π interaction in GR/PPy not only gave the aerogels abundant channels, but also achieved a high efficiency for the removal of VOC (Fig. 5c). The removal efficiency of GR/PPy for phenol reached 94.8%, achieving high photodegradation and ultra-high evaporation capacity, which could simultaneously produce fresh water and purify complex wastewater. Song et al.217 designed a flexible membrane with dual-scale porous and photothermal–photocatalytic for VOS in sewage. The two-scale porous structure of the membrane was composed of interconnected and zigzagging micron-scale pores formed by the aggregation of nano-scale pores. Consequently, the membrane could provide more photocatalytic reaction sites (mainly through its mesopores) and longer tortuous channels (mainly through micrometer-sized pores), consistently intercepting VOCs in situ (Fig. 5d). The results proved that the residual phenol in the distilled water was less than 5%.
3.4 Oily wastewater
Oily wastewater mainly comes from the petroleum, chemical, steel and other industrial sectors as well as domestic sewage, and its mass concentration is generally 5000–10000 mg L−1. Oil stains are mainly present in water in the form of suspended, dissolved, dispersed, emulsified and oil–solid substances. Suspended oil in oily wastewater can generally be removed by gravity separation. Dissolved oil can be separated by organic matter in water. However, the finely dispersed and emulsified oil in the colloidal state, which have a small particle size and stable state, are difficult to separate. Considering the different states of oily wastewater, researchers have mainly focused on the regulation of oil absorption or oleophobic properties of PMs, as well as the structure of materials, realizing the effective purification of oily wastewater in different states under the synergistic action of solar energy.

3.4.1 Hydrophilic and oleophobic SDIE. 
Hydrophilic and oleophobic SDIE has great advantages in the treatment of oily wastewater with the potential of practical application in both seawater and oil–water. For the treatment of oily wastewater, the hydrophilic and oleophobic SDIE can effectively separate oil–water mixtures by blocking the absorption of oil based on its inherent superhydrophilicity.70,218 Wu et al.219 prepared a PM with hydrophilic and oleophobic properties in both air and water to realize an oil-resistant SDIE. This system achieved a stable solar EE of more than 85% in pure water or oily sewage (Fig. 6a and b).

He et al.220 designed and fabricated a novel multilayer nanostructured solar steam generator with a polydopamine-coated carbon nanotube/polyurethane nanofiber membrane, which achieved an ER of 1.44 kg m−2 h−1. This material was highly resistant to oil pollution, and its SDIE performance also remained stable in oil–polluted water (Fig. 6c and d). This PM is more suitable for the actual purification of oil–polluted water.
Xia et al.221 designed and fabricated novel solar thermal materials (O-WF-HNTs) from low-cost wood fibers (WF) and natural clay halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) with hydrophilic and oleophobic properties. These materials were utilized to purify sewage containing n-hexadecane, and it was revealed that their conversion efficiency was as high as 79%, indicating that they can also be utilized in oily water or sewage. Their research group also prepared a superhydrophilic and oleophobic porous structure by carbonizing a mixture of paper towel and basalt fiber for oil repellent modification (O-BFT), resulting in an oleophobic PM capable of efficiently generating solar steam (Fig. 6e). The unique design of O-BFT allowed this material to produce gas efficiently in oily wastewater, expanding its application in practical SDIE.222
The preparation of a CuxS-based SDIE was reported by Huang et al.,192 where biphasic CuxS composite nanorods were assembled and engineered into a 3D layered structural foam (Fig. 6f). The prepared CuxS/Cu foam (SCF) evaporator showed a high ER (1.73 kg m−2 h−1) in an oil-in-water emulsion, exhibiting a good oil–water purification performance.
He et al.223 revealed that TA and Fe3+ can efficiently convert wood into a PM (wood–TA–Fe3+) and be applied for SDIE. Water purification treatment was carried out in bio-oil and crude-oil water emulsion. It was displayed that the EE of the material was almost the same as that in pure water, and the oil droplets in the water did not reduce the superhydrophilic performance of the PM (Fig. 6g).


3.4.2 SDIE accelerates adsorption. 
During the photothermal conversion by SDIE, with an increase in temperature and the escape of steam, water molecules will flow faster due to the differences in pressure and promote the adsorption of pollutants. The high temperature caused by photothermal conversion provides power for the diffusion of pollution particles and further strengthens the water purification capacity.
Zhang et al.224in situ crystallized MoS2 nanocrystals on a melamine-derived carbon framework, which restricted the shrinkage of the material during the carbonization process, leading to a foam with large 3D pores. The foam had excellent practical applications, including photothermal installations with selective oil absorption and water leakage resistance. Similarly, Wang et al.225 modified melamine sponge with GO and AgNO3 to obtain PM (rGO/AgNPs-MS) with hydrophobicity and high porosity, which showed a high EE (86.8%) and ER (1.21 kg m−2 h−1). rGO/AgNPs-MS not only had good adsorption capacity for organic solvents and low-viscosity crude oil, but could also absorb solar energy to heat heavy crude oil in situ, reduce its viscosity, improve its fluidity, and achieve a high adsorption capacity (68 g g−1) for heavy crude oil.
Xiao et al.226 obtained superhydrophobic/superoleophilic fabric, which was a salt-resistant composite for interfacial evaporation. It exhibited an ER of 1.526 kg m−2 h−1 and could separate oil from polluted seawater before desalination. Based on this, Chao et al.227 proposed a novel compressible wood sponge adsorbent material with an rGO coating and hydrophobic layer decoration. The material increased the temperature of crude oil to 88 °C within 100 s. The viscosity of crude oil was effectively reduced. Simultaneously, it showed an excellent separation and adsorption performance for oil spills, and helped to collect 50 mL of crude oil within 20 min, demonstrating its potential for practically treating marine oil spills (Fig. 6h). It is very significant to collect and recycle high-viscosity crude oil in an environmentally friendly way for water treatment.


3.4.3 Other SDIE for oily wastewater. 
Wei et al.228 fabricated a Janus hollow fiber membrane (HFM) as a novel SDIE, which exhibited an ER of 3.5 kg m−2 h−1 in an oil-in-water emulsion and the retention rate of the oil–water mixture reached 99%. Wu et al.229 prepared covalently cross-linked CNF-based aerogels (Si–CNF). The aerogel exhibited an unusual superhydrophilic property under oil, with a separation efficiency of 99.6%. Besides, its excellent resistance to oil pollution caused it to possess high cycle stability and reusability, with its ER reaching 1.83 kg m−2 h−1. This mechanically tough and versatile aerogel is expected to provide an opportunity for the design and development of water-based cellulose materials.
Wang et al.230 developed an SDIE inspired by the transpiration of plants. This SDIE had a purification efficiency of 99.7% for various oily wastewater, achieving the purpose of producing fresh water in one step from oily seawater, acid and alkali corrosion oily wastewater (Fig. 6i). Qi et al.231 prepared carbon fibers based on silk and wove them together with cotton (CBS/cotton) to obtain composite fabrics. As indicated by their results, the material could be applied in oil-in-water emulsion to get clean distilled water through evaporation. The ER of the CBS/cotton SDIE in oil-in-water emulsion reached 2.0 kg m−2 h−1. Inspired by the scales of the baboon snake in West Africa, Liu et al.232 prepared snake-scale-like porous carbon (BSPC) from zinc oxide-carbonized polycarbonate waste materials. The ER and EE of BSPC were 1.58 kg m−2 h−1 and 91%, respectively. This material could also be utilized to evaporate oil–water emulsion to collect oil-free water.

3.5 Pesticide residue wastewater
Pesticide residue wastewater is more difficult to treat than other impurities. These pesticides flow into rivers due to agricultural irrigation, polluting local water and directly threatening the safety of the water supply. Qiao et al.183 synthesized Ag+ nanoparticle-modified carbon cloth (ANCC), which exhibited an ER and EE of about 1.36 kg m−2 h−1 and 92.82%, respectively. Through interfacial evaporation, ANCC could effectively remove pesticide residues such as atrazine and metronidazole in sewage. Huang et al.100 used a multi-functional carbon aerogel (CHA) to purify three types of pesticide residues containing omethoate, dimethoate and sulfur phosphorus by evaporation inhibition of low boiling point contaminants (Fig. 7a and b). The concentrations of the three pesticides decreased from 17.4, 11.4, and 15.3 mg kg−1 to 0.03, 0.02 and 0.03 mg kg−1, respectively. These studies show that SDIE technology can effectively purify pesticide residue wastewater, and thus has a promising application prospect in the future.

3.6 Eutrophic water
At present, the eutrophication of water is becoming increasingly serious. Algal blooms and red tides occur frequently, resulting in the deterioration of water quality and serious damage to aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, the purification of eutrophic water has become a paramount problem to solve urgently.
Wang et al.233 developed an SDIE that could coordinate steam and power generation using red mud, with an ER of 2.185 kg m−2 h−1. This SDIE was applied for the treatment of seriously eutrophicated water, and it was revealed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) decreased from 250 mg L−1 to 0 mg L−1 and the ammonia nitrogen content decreased from 70–100 ppm to 2 ppm (Fig. 7c). It was proven that this design could prominently reduce the COD and ammonia nitrogen in water and has a good purification ability for eutrophic water.
Wang et al.234 developed a multifunctional cobalt-containing perovskite PM (La0.7Sr0.3CoO3) for efficient evaporation and energy saving regeneration. The ER of La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 reached 1.74 kg m−2 h−1. Then, high-concentration algal water samples were introduced for photothermal evaporation measurements. After being contaminated by algae, the EE of the contaminated PMs was gradually reduced. For the regeneration of the material, it was calcined in air at 470 °C for 1 h, and the ER of the regenerated material reached 1.63 kg m−2 h−1. In conclusion, La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 sheets have good thermal stability and regeneration ability, and thus have crucial practical application significance in algae-polluted water.
3.7 Radioactive wastewater
After the accident of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, the treatment of radioactive wastewater has been the focus of researchers. The main methods to treat radioactive wastewater include inert curing, adsorption, magnetic-molecular method, evaporation concentration, biological treatment and zero-valent iron percolation reaction wall technology. Among them, the evaporation concentration method is the most widely applied. Nevertheless, the problems of corrosion, high operation cost and energy consumption in the traditional evaporation concentration method restrict its further application. Alternatively, SDIE not only retains the advantages of the traditional evaporation concentration method, but also avoids its disadvantages.
Yu et al.235 demonstrated a 3D porous structure sponge as a SDIE, and its ER reached 1.60 kg m−2 h−1. Furthermore, artificial radioactive wastewater was purified using this design, and the results showed that the concentrations of Sr, Cs and U could be reduced from 1 g L−1 to 0.265, 2.459 and 1.585 μg L−1, respectively. It was indicated that this SDIE can effectively purify radioactive wastewater and enrich a variety of radionuclides. The purification mechanism can be attributed to the evaporative deposition, adsorption of –OH in konjac glucomannan and weaker reduction of U(VI) by thermoelectrons.
The combination of solar steam and ocean uranium extraction can simultaneously obtain enough fresh water and nuclear raw material from the ocean to overcome the crisis of water resource and energy, respectively, which has huge potential for development. Wu et al.236 designed and prepared a bifunctional graphene aerogel by combining waxberry tannin with a graphene aerogel to achieve an efficient ER (1.80 kg m−2 h−1). The results showed the synergistic effect between the generation of solar steam and extraction of uranium from the ocean. The increase in temperature during SDIE accelerated the diffusion rate of UO22+, thereby accelerating the adsorption rate of uranium and enabling its extraction from seawater (230.10 mg g−1 within 6 h) (Fig. 7d). Meanwhile, the adsorption process of UO22+ hardly affects the solar vapor production. The unique bifunctional design of this material can open up a new avenue for harnessing abundant marine resources.
At present, the treatment of radioactive wastewater by SDIE mainly depends on the adsorption performance of the material itself to radioactive elements. However, there are many problems in its practical application. For instance, the other metal ions in seawater interfere with the adsorption of uranium ions, especially ions with similar properties (such as vanadium). Therefore, achieving the single enrichment of radioactive elements is challenging. In addition, there is a synergistic effect between SDIE and radioactive element adsorption materials, but there is still a lack of quantitative analysis and systematic research on this synergistic effect.
3.8 Medical wastewater
At present, antibiotics have been detected in the natural water environment in many parts of the world. Antibiotic medical wastewater can cause disorder in the ecosystem, and thus attracted great attention from researchers. The treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics is imminent.
Yin et al.195 synthesized Co3S4 hollow nanoparticles with an excellent photothermal effect and woven them with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) by electrospinning technology to generate a bilayer membrane (Co3S4HP) for solar interfacial evaporators, which exhibited an ER of 1.26 kg m−2 h−1. Co3S4HP was then used as an activator for the PMS degradation of tetracycline. The means of degradation is mainly the removal of tetracycline by the use of Co3S4HP/PAN as a filter membrane. In the presence of Co3S4HP, the degradation rate of 30 mL tetracycline (concentration of 20 mg L−1) reached 93.7% within 20 min. After the cyclic degradation experiments, the degradation efficiency of the membrane remained at 88.5%. As confirmed by these findings, PMs have broad application prospects in desalination and the removal of antibiotic-contaminated wastewater. Wang et al.237 proposed a ternary nanophotocatalyst hybridized plasmonic three-dimensional wood carbon (Pt/Au/TiO2 NPs) for interfacial evaporation to synergistically degrade tetracycline. The photothermal effect boosted the evaporation process of interfacial vapor, accelerated the diffusion of target pollutants to the suspended composites, and further improved the efficiency and photodegradation rate of tetracycline. The photodegradation rate of tetracycline reached 94% at 40 mg L−1. Kim et al.238 developed porous rGO-based composite spheres and demonstrated that the floating ball composite could achieve an energy conversion EE of 74% and effectively evaporate water, which could effectively remove organic pollutants (RhB, tetracycline, bisphenol A and 1-naphthylamine) from water by photochemical reaction and inhibit the formation of harmful chemical substances. Sun et al.239 uniformly attached a solvent-free synthetic tungsten carbide/carbon nanocomposite to cotton cloth as a solar-absorbing material. It was found that the membrane also had the function of purifying tetracycline.
Chen et al.153 designed and fabricated a novel MoS2-based composite evaporator (MSE). MSE could degrade nitrobenzene, carbamazepine, naproxen and other organic pollutants. The removal process of organic pollutants is mainly based on adsorption, and photocatalysis plays a certain auxiliary role. Besides, during 23 use cycles in 210 days, its ER did not decline. It was indicated that MSE has excellent stability and durability and has potential use in water treatment for poor or remote areas.
A visible light-responsive self-assembled composite membrane was prepared by Dong et al.240 With ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CIP), levofloxacin hydrochloride and sulfamethoxazole (80 mL, 10 mg L−1) as target pollutants, the degradation rate of CIP reached 94.31% within 120 min under 0.5 sun. In actual water samples such as tap, Yellow River and Wei River water, the removal of CIP still had an obvious effect. Therefore, this SDIE is expected to be applied in the purification and removal of antibiotics in water in practical water samples (Fig. 7e).
In recent years, research on SDIE in the field of antibiotic sewage purification is increasing, but it is still in the exploratory stage. Thus, in-depth systematic research is needed prior to its large-scale application.
3.9 Other sewage
In addition to effectively purifying the above-mentioned pollutants, SDIE can also be employed to purify wastewater containing various organic pollutants, suspended solids, fertilizers, etc.
The aforementioned153 MoS2 novel composite evaporator (MSE) was also utilized to remove total organic compounds (TOC) in seawater, and the results revealed that the TOC could be reduced from 9.60 to 3.77 mg L−1. It should be noted that although the TOC decreased prominently, organic compounds were still present in the purified fresh water. Besides, MSE could simultaneously remove organic pollutants such as tryptophan and humic acid. Wang et al.212 prepared MXene/carbon nanotube/cotton fabric via hierarchical assembly for the purification of textile wastewater. Its ER reached 1.35 kg m−2 h−1, while that of textile wastewater was 1.16 kg m−2 h−1. This evaporator showed high absorption capacity during evaporation. The authors selected fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (AEO), aniline and urea as model pollutants, and further explored the decontamination performance of the composite fabrics. The initial TOC concentrations of AEO, aniline and urea were 489.4, 523.7 and 536.5 μg L−1, while that of condensed fresh water after solar evaporation decreased to 139.1, 42.7, and 36.5 μg L−1, respectively, indicating that the material has good reusability and long-term stability, and has potential application value. Zhai et al.241 prepared biochar cake (BC) from biomass waste and coated the surface of carbonized fiber with granular and flake magnesium oxide (MgO) to improve its hydrophilicity. The concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), TOC, total carbon (TC) and inorganic carbon (IC) in wastewater decreased from 2937.01, 1263.06, 1354.02 and 90.96 mg L−1 to 17.52, 34.33, 46.94 and 10.91 mg L−1, respectively. Furthermore, the method for its preparation is simple and low cost, which can be applied for the treatment of dye wastewater on a large scale, and also provide an economic and effective management strategy for waste biomass.
4. Application and research progress of SDIE in practical water treatment
In the actual water treatment process, the water is not only polluted by one type, but by many types of pollutants simultaneously. Besides, all types of pollutants affect each other, and decomposition, combination and biological precipitation are constantly occurring, making the application of PMs challenging. Thus, the durability and reusability of PMs play a crucial role in the actual water treatment process and determine their effectiveness. Therefore, PMs should have the property of maintaining stable performance after multiple cycles, in addition to reusability in the wastewater treatment process. Hou et al.245 used chemically treated carbonized wood as a photothermal material, which served as both a solar absorber and a heavy metal ion adsorbent. The material had excellent reusability when used as an adsorbent, with only a slight decrease in adsorption capacity for Pb2+ after four cycles. Ma et al.49 reported that the evaporation rate of a Pt3Ni–S-deposited Teflon membrane remained essentially stable for 10 cycles under acidic and alkaline conditions, and the structure of the sample did not change significantly after cycling, indicating that the material has excellent durability in harsh environments. The Cu@CuO/CG-aero Janus membranes prepared by Zhao et al.246 exhibited an efficient purification performance for wastewater by solar energy, and the results of using the modified membranes to treat wastewater continuously for 6 days showed almost uniform evaporation per day and no fouling, indicating their long-lasting durability. Li et al.247 prepared a SiO2/MXene/poly(tetrafluoroethylene) Janus membrane with a removal rate of 99.9% for heavy metal ions and dye contaminants. The temperature change trend was basically the same for various cycles in the cyclic heating-cooling test, which indicated that it has excellent physical and mechanical properties, making it stable and reusable. In previous research, most of the PMs that were cycled several times in simulated seawater or pure water could maintain relatively stable evaporation rates. Some PMs have been tested for durability and reusability in other complex water volumes such as highly concentrated salt water, acidic and alkaline solutions, and heavy metal ion wastewater, but this is not sufficient, and the reusability of PMs needs to be further explored.
To expand the application of SDIE technology in water treatment, researchers have carried out application tests on industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and consequently proposed many exciting ideas. For example, can SDIE technology purify shale gas backflow and produced water? Xie et al.242 analyzed this problem. Although no specific PMs were designed, and no specific experimental analysis was carried out, the results of their technical and economic analysis displayed that even in the Sichuan Basin with low solar intensity and high water volume of shale gas flowback and produced water, solar energy was sufficient to achieve zero liquid discharge with lower capital cost than that of traditional membrane-based and thermal-based systems (Fig. 8a and b). Zhang et al.122 developed an efficient Janus hydrogel photothermal membrane (Janus hydrogel-1), which exhibited an ER of 1.45 kg m−2 h−1. This PM could remove inorganic and organic components in kitchen and laundry sewage by SDIE, and thus has great potential in domestic sewage treatment (Fig. 8c).

Yu et al.175 constructed a new three-dimensional layered SDIE (3DHG) using a hydrophilic carbon mat, and its ER reached 1.56 kg m−2 h−1. In addition, 3DHG was also utilized for the purification of industrial printing and dyeing wastewater. As displayed by the results, in dye 1, the pH, ionic conductivity, ammonia nitrogen and COD of the condensate collected by 3DHG reached the level 4 standard of surface water. In dye 2, the condensed water collected by 3DHG reached the level 3 standard of surface water, indicating that it has excellent performance in the treatment of industrial printing and dyeing wastewater. After 7 days of wastewater testing, the minimum ER was 1.45 kg m−2 h−1. Higgins et al.204 applied carbon fiber fabric as a PM to reduce the organic pollutants in the initial sample of industrial wastewater from 14800 ppm to 1940 ppm, and the removal rate of organic pollutants reached about 87% (Fig. 8d).
Yang et al.152 reported a polymer wastewater collector based on a defective polysilicon activated carbon (DPAC) for SDIE. The ER of domestic sewage and industrial sewage by DPAC reached 1.37 and 1.28 kg m−2 h−1 and the corresponding EE was 91.8% and 85.8% (Fig. 8e and f), respectively. Irshad et al.75 designed a self-floating evaporation system with photodegradation ability. This system had a significant effect on the purification of Shahu Lake was, with an ER of 1.68 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 8g and h). On sunny days, the daily purified water could reach 13.60 kg m−2.
Previous research results proved that SDIE technology has a good application prospect in practical water treatment. However, thus far, the cases of its application in the field of water treatment are rare (Table 3). Thus, can be concluded that SDIE technology still has a long way to go from theoretical research to commercial promotion.

5. Conclusion and outlook
Under the consideration of both the energy shortage and environmental protection, the use of solar energy to produce clean water is of great significance for the sustainable development of society. With the development of urbanization and industrialization, the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater is increasing. At present, an important factor in the unsatisfactory promotion of sewage treatment is the high cost of wastewater treatment equipment. Thus, to achieve the sustainable development of society, low energy consumption, low cost, low pollution wastewater treatment technology has become an inevitable demand. In many experiments, SDIE has been proven to possess the green and clean properties of efficient evaporation water production capacity and almost zero pollution emissions, showing great potential in sewage treatment. At present, the research on SDIE in the field of water treatment is increasing, which has become promising technology to solve the shortage of freshwater resources. However, the performance of SDIE is still not satisfactory in practical applications. Thus, to improve the application effect of SDIE in the field of water treatment, the following aspects can be optimized.
5.1 Design optimization of solar interfacial evaporator

5.1.1 Development of robust PMs to enhance the cyclic stability of high-efficiency SDIE. 
In the design of practical PMs to achieve the efficient and deep purification of wastewater, there are still many bottleneck problems to be solved. Firstly, they should be salt tolerant. The pore size, curvature and porosity of PMs have an important influence on the design of salt-resistant PMs. Therefore, it is still necessary to study the constitutive relationship between the pore properties of PMs and the salt crystallization law to regulate the preparation of PMs with salt resistance. Secondly, they should have physical and chemical stability, especially in acid and alkaline pollutants. Under the action of high light energy, photochemical oxidation should be avoided because it results in the decomposition of the materials. Finally, they should be resistant to biodegradation. After soaking in water for a long time, PMs easily breed bacteria and algae, causing secondary pollution to water bodies. Therefore, it is very important for the practical application of SDIG to develop PMs with multiple functions such as salt resistance, corrosion resistance, bacteriostasis and algal inhibition.


5.1.2 The thermal management system of SDIE should be optimized to increase freshwater production. 
In previous studies, the thermal management of SDIE was mainly designed in terms of high light absorption and low thermal conductivity of PMs. However, SDIE is affected by the stronger heat radiation outdoors, which weakens the condensation effect of steam, making it difficult to collect condensed water during the process of purifying water outdoors by SDIE. The condensation hood of SDIE is mainly utilized to collect steam. The steam attached to the condensing hood flows downward by gravity and is collected. Nevertheless, as the steam in the evaporator continues to increase, the incidence of sunlight will be affected to a certain extent, combined with the influence of the saturated humidity inside the evaporator, resulting in a huge difference between the actual evaporation and the amount of condensed water collected. Although some strategies have been proposed to enhance the thermal management, they are far from sufficient, and thus further optimization of the evaporator is necessary.


5.1.3 The organic combination of light-heat-wind-electricity is required for SDIE to effectively solve the impact of the intermittent solar energy and uneven solar radiation intensity on the sewage treatment effect. 
The efficiency of solar interfacial evaporation is closely connected with the intensity of incident light. Most of the existing research is conducted under high concentration conditions, but it is of great significance for the promotion and application of SDIE technology to improve the performance of SDIE under non-concentration conditions. Considering the intermittent characteristic of solar radiation, energy storage components should be added in the evaporation system to facilitate the continuous evaporation process. The synergistic effect of light–heat–wind–electricity is expected to effectively improve the photothermal conversion efficiency under non-concentration conditions.

5.2 Treatment of residual pollutants on SDIE and recycling of resources
Given that the environmental protection constraint is increasing worldwide, the treatment of residual pollutants after interfacial evaporation and resource recovery and utilization will become a crucial research topic in the future. After the interfacial evaporation treatment of sewage, the pollutants in it are concentrated, and thus the residual pollutants need to be further treated. On the one hand, the efficiency of pollutant removal can be synergistically enhanced by improving the photocatalytic and adsorption properties of PMs. On the other hand, useful substances in pollutants can be recovered by migrating the carrier, that is, the synchronization of evaporating water at the solar interface and the recovery of scarce resources can be achieved.
5.3 Promotion of industrial application of SDIE
With the advent of the era of industrialization, the scalability, cost, and benefit of solar-driven interfacial evaporation technology have become paramount factors that affect its competitiveness. In previous studies, more attention was paid to the evaporation performance of water, but there were few cases of extended implementation, and even fewer cases of cost analysis. Simultaneously, due to the complexity and variability of the wastewater environment, the wide range of wastewater types treated by SDIE and the achievement of more excellent treatment results deserve further exploration. Therefore, in future research and development, a systematic analysis method on the industry of evaporating and purifying water with solar interface should be developed, while further considering economic benefits, thus evaluating the potential of this technology for large-scale application.
