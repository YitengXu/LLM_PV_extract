    , Accepted 22nd June 2020First published on 22nd June 2020AbstractApplications of lead halide perovskites in solar cells and photo- and ionising radiation detectors are based on effective charge carrier generation and transport. The perovskites exhibit large carrier recombination lifetimes and diffusion coefficients leading to exceptionally long carrier diffusion lengths for solution processed materials. However, carrier density dependences of these parameters are not very well established. Therefore, in this work, we have used non-destructive optical techniques such as time-resolved differential absorption, time-resolved photoluminescence and light induced transient gratings (LITG) for the simultaneous determination of carrier density dependent recombination and diffusion rates as well as diffusion length in MAPbI3 and MAPBr3 crystals in a wide range of excitation densities upon single and two photon injections. At low carrier densities, recombination processes on bulk and surface traps were found to be dominant providing 1–2 μs lifetime, and 6 × 103; ∼30 cm s−1 surface recombination velocities in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 crystals, respectively. For higher carrier densities, an enhancement in carrier recombination rate as well as an increase in carrier diffusivity is observed. We related the lifetime reduction with excitation to the bimolecular and Auger recombination processes with B0 = 1.0 (4) × 10−10 cm3 s−1 and C = 1.5 (1.2) × 10−29 cm6 s−1 coefficients in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively. The LITG measurements provide a direct increase in the carrier density dependent diffusion coefficient from 1.35 to 3 cm2 s−1 in MAPbI3 and from 0.45 cm2 s−1 to 1.7 cm2 s−1 in MAPbBr3 due to the carrier plasma degeneracy and saturation of localized states. A high carrier density related diffusion length drop from 10 to 0.1 μm in the 1016–1019 cm−3 carrier density range was observed.
1. Introduction
Recently, methylammonium lead halide bulk perovskite crystals were grown using a cost-effective inverse temperature crystallization method involving a supersaturated solution.1–3 The crystals were applied for narrowband perovskite single-crystal photodetectors controlled by surface-charge recombination,4 self-biased photodetectors,5,6 field effect transistors3 and two photon autocorrelators.7 Moreover, perovskite crystals were effectively applied for ionising radiation detection8–12 due to their higher radiation hardness in comparison to silicon carbide.13 This feature favours the applications of perovskite solar cells and detectors in a radioactive space environment.14,15
The application of perovskites in solar cells and photo- and ionizing radiation detectors is based on effective charge carrier generation and transport. The latter is characterized by carrier recombination (surface, bulk, bimolecular, and Auger) and their mobility or diffusivity. The cumulative impact of these parameters is described by diffusion length which is known to achieve in perovskites values exceeding those of silicon.16–18 Perovskite bulk crystals provide a good model system due to the presence of less structural defects, and reduced surface recombination which is typically present for grained thin-film layers. Surface recombination and diffusion coefficients in perovskite crystals were recently studied via time-resolved differential reflectivity,19–22 pump–probe microscopy21 and photoluminescence imaging microscopy,22 while lifetime excitation dependences were investigated by THz photoconductivity.23–25 Nevertheless, excitation dependent carrier transport in perovskite bulk crystals is still under debate and needs additional research for clarification. Special emphasis should be paid to the dependence of the recombination and diffusivity parameters on the surface and localised states, including intrinsic disorder induced by organic cation rotation in the cubic–tetragonal MAPbX3 lattice. A detailed analysis of the recombination and diffusion parameters in a wide range of excitation intensities will promote the understanding of optoelectronic device operation at variable injected carrier densities.
In this work, we applied various non-destructive optical techniques such as time-resolved differential transmittance (DT), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and light induced transient gratings (LITG) for the determination of a carrier density dependent diffusion coefficient, recombination lifetime and diffusion length in MAPbI3 and MAPBr3 crystals. Bulk, bimolecular, Auger and surface recombination coefficients were determined in a wide 1016–3 × 1019 cm−3 carrier density range implementing one- (1P) and two- (2P) photon excitation regimes. Complementing lifetime and diffusivity data, diffusion length excitation dependences were determined. Moreover, free carrier absorption cross sections and bimolecular recombination saturation parameters were obtained.
2. Samples
The studied crystals were grown using an inverse temperature crystallization method.1 Reagents MAI, PbI2, MABr, PbBr2, anhydrous γ-butyrolactone and dimethylformamide were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Perovskite precursor 0.8 g ml−1 solutions of MAPbI3 in γ-butyrolactone and MAPbBr3 in dimethylformamide were prepared. MAPbI3 crystals were grown for ∼5 hours in sealed bottles placed in an oil bath with 110 °C growth temperature, while MAPbBr3 crystals were grown for ∼3 hours in sealed bottles placed in a water bath with 70 °C growth temperature. The largest crystals (∼3 mm × 3 mm) were removed from the solution, rinsed and polished to d = 0.81 mm (MAPbI3) and d = 0.57 mm (MAPbBr3) thicknesses for experiments (see the inset in Fig. 1). The polished sample transmission was ∼60% (OD = 0.2) in the transparency range, minimizing the impact of scattering and beam distortions to the measurements.

Bulk, bimolecular, Auger and surface recombination coefficients were determined in the 1016–3 × 1019 cm−3 carrier density range by performing time-resolved photoluminescence, differential transmittance and light induced transient grating measurements. A more detailed description of the experimental setups and excited carrier density determination details are provided in the Experimental methods section. One- (1P) and two- (2P) photon excitation regimes were implemented. For the 1P excitation of TRPL in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 samples we used wavelengths of 480 nm and 680 nm, respectively, while for 2P excitation, wavelengths of 1053 and 900 nm were used. In LITG and DT measurements 1P/2P excitation was performed at 527/1053 nm, while probing was done at 1053/1064 nm, respectively. The determination of absorption coefficients at 2P excitation and excitation dependences of the measured signals is provided in Section 5.
3. Results
In this section we consider carrier relaxation dynamics in highly excited perovskite crystals obtained through optical nondestructive probes. The obtained complementary data enable distinguishing the dominant relaxation mechanisms, establishing the values of the main recombination parameters in a wide range of excitation intensities. Furthermore, in Section 4, the obtained carrier density dependences will be supported by the modelling of the excitation dependent carrier lifetime, diffusivity and diffusion length.
3.1. Photoluminescence spectra
In Fig. 1 we compare the PL spectra obtained at 1P and 2P excitations in the studied MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 crystals. The PL spectra originate from electron–hole plasma radiative recombination.26,27 The impact of sub-bandgap defect radiative recombination was found to be negligible in these spectra, indicating the good quality of our crystals and their polished surfaces. The FWHM of PL spectra at 1P excitations are 81 meV and 88 meV for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively, which well agrees with the observed 85 meV in the literature.28 A wider PL spectrum in MAPbBr3 can be related to a stronger impact of localised and indirect states due to the Rashba effect.29–31 The 2P excitation spectra red-shift with respect to that at 1P excitation due to reabsorption.32 Fitting the 2P spectra to the 1P spectra red-wing, photon recycling factors32–34 of fR = Integral(PL1P)/Integral(PL2P) = 9 and 26 were obtained for MAPbI3 and MAPBr3, respectively. A similar photon recycling factor of 21 was determined in MAPbBr3.35 The photon recycling effect is weaker in MAPbI3 due to its lower absorption coefficient near the absorption edge.26
The excitation dependent PL spectra in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 crystals are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. The spectra shapes and maxima positions weakly depend on the excitation which is typical for electron–hole plasma radiative recombination.34–38 At 1P excitations the PL peak (at 2.34 eV) shift with excitation to lower energies is observed due to bandgap renormalization by electron–hole plasma (ΔEG ∼ −ΔN1/3), while weak broadening appears due to plasma degeneracy and the consequent Burstein–Moss shift (ΔEG ∼ ΔN2/3).38,39 At 2P excitations, the PL peak shifts to lower energies (at 2.22 eV) due to reabsorption. At low 2P excitations an observed blueshift to higher energies is related to the localized state filling (see the Discussion section for details), while at higher excitations some bandgap renormalization related redshifts are also evident. The PL spectral shapes almost do not change during the PL transient, as reported similarly in ref. 39, indicating the weak impact of the carrier traps.

Peak signal (t = 0) excitation dependences for TRPL (c) and PL peak positions (d); solid lines are fitting curves obtained using eqn (1) and (3). The excitation intensity interval in (a and b) is indicated on the plot and corresponds to the I0 values in (c).

Peak signal (t = 0) excitation dependences for PL (c) and PL peak positions (d); solid lines are fitting curves obtained using eqn (1) and (3). Excitation intensity I0 interval in (a and b) is indicated on the plot and corresponds to the values in (c). 
In Fig. 2c and 3c we show peak PL intensities (at t = 0), which reflect a change in the radiative recombination rate with excited carrier density. The PL peak intensity vs. 1P excitation intensity changes the slope from 1.9 to 1.1. A low excitation slope value close to 2.0 confirms an electron–hole plasma emission mechanism24,25 (excitons would show a linear slope instead). At high excitations, a diminishing slope reflects the reduction of B with excitation26 as excited carrier density instantly after excitation in the latter case is linearly dependent on the excitation intensity (at t = 0), PL ∼ ΔNPL ∼ I0. The corresponding peak PL intensity relation with the carrier density is: PL1P(ΔNPL, t = 0) ∼ B(ΔNPL)ΔNPL2.(1)
Here the carrier density dependent bimolecular radiative recombination coefficient B(ΔN) is given by the relation:26 (2)where Nb represents the material-specific carrier density when B(ΔN) becomes half of the low injection B0.26 Fitting the data in Fig. 2c and 3c to eqn (1) and (2) results inNb = (6 ± 1) × 1018 (MAPbI3), (7 ± 1) × 1018 (MAPbBr3). Latter values well coincide with the corresponding theoretical ones of 7.0 × 1018 and 6.7 × 1018 cm−3.26 A theoretical Nb value is slightly larger in MAPbI3 due to the higher density of states used in the calculations.26
By fitting the PL intensity vs 2P excitation (Fig. 2c and 3c, right curves), simplified equations were derived including spatial averaging over Gaussian excitation beam shape with squared carrier density. (3)
The second factor in the equations reflects the appearance of the inhomogeneous 2P excitation profile over the sample depth at high excitations, leading to PL slope reduction towards 2.0, while at low excitations the factor can be expanded in series to provide PL2P(ΔNPL) ∼ B(ΔNPL)ΔNPL2d/2 ∼ I04 at t = 0. The latter 4.0 slope was observed experimentally when we used low excitation fluencies, indicating that two photon absorption is dominant at low excitations, while linear trap absorption does not take place. Note, that at 2P excitation ΔNPL ∼ I02. Two-photon factor b and carrier density determination details are described in Section 5.
3.2. PL transients
The excitation dependent PL transients for 1P and 2P excitations in the studied samples are shown in Fig. 4. It is evident that the relaxation becomes faster with the increase of excitation intensity. The latter is typically due to bimolecular and Auger recombination processes which were previously observed in lead halide perovskite layers.26,39 Nonlinear decay shape at low excitations as shown in Fig. 4a and c is due to the considerable surface recombination impact at 1P excitation. The corresponding initial lifetime fits to the transients are provided in Fig. 8. Exponential transient tails (Fig. 4b and d) in our samples indicate that the samples are free of dopants or effective charge separation defects as compared to those reported in ref. 40. The absence of slow tails indicates a low concentration of traps in our crystals (<1016 cm−3).
 Fig. 4  Excitation density dependent TRPL transients: in MAPbI3 at 1P 680 nm excitation (a) and at 2P 1054 nm excitation (b); in MAPbBr3 at 1P 480 nm excitation (c) and at 2P 900 nm excitation (d). The corresponding fitted initial lifetime values and excitation fluences are provided in the plots. In (a and c) a dashed line shows a 43 ps response function. In (d) the dashed lowest curve represents a 1P transient at 0.024 mJ cm−2 excitation and longer delays; insets show initial transient parts of the 2P curves. Solid lines are numeric fits to the curves as described in the next section. 
3.3. Differential transmittance transients
Differential transmittance transients can provide a straightforward way for the determination of the carrier lifetime due to DT signal linear dependence on the excited carrier density, DT ∼ ΔN (see Section 5). We used probe wavelength with energy below the bandgap of the studied crystals, thus free carrier absorption dominated the signal (if the probe is set near the bandgap, the bleaching signal would be dominant39). In Fig. 5 we show excitation dependent DT transients in the studied crystals using a probe wavelength of 1064 nm. The measured transients directly provide slow carrier lifetimes. Lifetimes are similar for both crystals and are similar to the values determined in 1P TRPL transient tails of the same technology crystals: 570 ns (MAPI3) and 300 ns (MAPBr3)1. The exponential transient tails and the low excitation initial parts of the transients exhibit similar lifetimes (Fig. 5), indicating that at lowest excitations nonradiative recombination on point defects is dominant, while at higher excitations nonlinear recombination evolves. The determined slow DT lifetimes are two times longer than the TRPL ones (Fig. 4), 2τPL = τ, as confirmed by the relationship PL ∼ ΔN2 ∼ exp(−t/τPL) = exp(−2t/τ). Therefore, the 2P excitation and free carrier absorption probing of the carrier recombination is the most reliable way to determine bulk trap related lifetimes. The DT lifetimes in comparison to ones determined by other methods are summarized in Fig. 8 and Table 1.

3.4. LITG transients
The LITG method allows one to determine diffusivity and its excitation dependence.26,39 We have recently shown that two diffusion regimes, (1) multitrapping and (2) band-like, can be present in perovskites.26 The first one indicates the considerable impact of localizing traps hindering carrier diffusion, while the second one is determined by filling the energy band by carriers, leading to their degeneracy which enhances carrier diffusivity and electron–hole scattering, which further reduces the diffusivity.21 Diffusion coefficient dependence on carrier density is important for the determination of the carrier density-dependent diffusion length in the studied perovskite crystals.
The LITG technique details are described in Section 5 and ref. 24 and 38. Briefly, for LITG the excitation beam was split by a diffractive optical element (a permanent diffraction grating with a fixed period), and two diffracted beams (first orders), intersecting at an angle Θ, created an interference pattern with a period Λ ≈ λpump/2sin(Θ/2) in the sample.41 The light-induced spatial modulation of carrier density ΔN ∝ (1 + cos (2πx/Λ)) was monitored by the diffraction of a probe beam at wavelength λprobe = 1053 nm. The probe beam diffraction efficiency DE and its transient are governed by the refractive index modulation Δn by the carrier density ΔN, and Δn(x,z,t) ∼ ΔN(x,z,t) integrated over the sample depth d gives the diffraction efficiency DE(t) ∼ ΔN2(t) × exp(−2t/τG) relation to the grating decay time τG: (4)here t is the probe beam delay time, τD = Λ2/4π2D is the grating diffusive erasure time, τ is the recombination lifetime, and d is the sample thickness. By measuring the grating decay rates 1/τG at different Λ, we determined D and fast components of τ according to eqn (4).
The corresponding LITG transients in MAPbBr3 at different grating periods are shown in Fig. 6. Similar transients were observed in MAPbI3. The transients in the 1P case (Fig. 6a) are nonlinear due to the impact of nonlinear and surface recombination, while in the 2P case (Fig. 6b) the latter impact is very weak and grating diffusive decay 1/τD, according to the relation (4), dominates, 1/τG ≈ 1/τD. The grating decay rates vs. an inverse grating period are shown in the inset of Fig. 6a. Latter 1/τG ∼ 1/Λ2 linear dependences provide a diffusion coefficient as a function of excitation, which is further analyzed in Section 4.

Carrier density ranges from 1.5 × 1018 to 4 × 1019 cm−3 in the 1P case and from 1016 to 4 × 1018 cm−3 in the 2P case. The inset in (a) shows the excitation dependent 1/τGvs. 1/Λ2 plot in the 1P regime. 
4. Discussion
4.1. Excitation dependent carrier recombination lifetime
The modeling of TRPL kinetics as shown in Fig. 4 with the determined diffusion and recombination parameters and their dependence on the excitation allowed us to analyze the impact of surface recombination velocity S and carrier in-depth redistribution, which plays an essential role when 1P excitation generates carriers near the surface. A numerical solution of the continuity equation was obtained by applying the boundary condition D δΔN(0,t)/δz = SΔN(0,t) at the front surface (z = 0):42 (5)where G(z,t) is the carrier generation rate by a short laser pulse.43 Here, τbulk is the recombination lifetime on bulk traps, B is the radiative bimolecular recombination coefficient, and C is the Auger coefficient. The photoluminescence transient was calculated by the following equation:43 (6)
Here αR being the reabsorption coefficient at the PL emission peak derived from ref. 26 is 0.5 × 104 cm−1 and 104 cm−1 for iodide and bromide, respectively. Excitation dependent D (see Fig. 9a) was used in the calculations.
The initial 1P TRPL transient part led to an impact of the fast surface lifetime τS = 1.4 ns (1/τ1PPL = 1/τbulk + 1/τS) in bromide and 1.1 ns in iodide (see Fig. 4a and c). The latter is explained by reabsorption, surface recombination and carrier in-depth diffusion (see modeled time-dependent near-surface ΔN(z,t) profiles in Fig. 7). The fast τS was modeled (see initial transient parts shown in Fig. 4a and c) with surface recombination velocities of S = (6 ± 2) × 103 cm s−1 (MAPbI3), and S = (30 ± 20) cm s−1 (MAPbBr3). The corresponding 8 ns and 35 ns decay times in the 1P PL transient tails in the iodide and bromide samples were also fitted with the same S values (see the lowest curve in Fig. 4b). MAPbI3 shows worse unprotected surface quality due to its fast destruction by moisture.44 Therefore, in MAPbI3 faster transient is dominated by larger S and D values (1.35 cm2 s−1vs. 0.45 cm2 s−1 in bromide). In comparison, similar S = 2.8 × 103 cm s−1 and D = 1.9 cm2 s−1 in the MAPbI3 crystal,19 and S = 3.4 × 103 cm s−1 and D = 0.27 cm2 s−1 in MAPbBr3 crystal20 values were determined by transient reflectance spectroscopy modelling.

In Fig. 8 we show the lifetime excitation dependences by the combination of results obtained using different methods. Below we provide corresponding eqn (7), which is a simplified version of eqn (5), to fit the initial 1/e lifetimes determined by different techniques at one and two photon excitations. (7)
 Fig. 8  Carrier density dependent 1/e lifetimes at different excitation regimes using applied determination techniques in MAPbI3 (a), and MAPbBr3 (b) crystals. The solid curves are fits according to eqn (7). 
Here, factor γ(ΔN) accounts for the TRPL lifetime τPL relation to the carrier lifetime τ: τPL = τ/γ(ΔN), which is defined by PL signal dependence on excitation PL ∼ ΔNγ(ΔN) (see Fig. 2 and 3c). γ(ΔN) was obtained by differentiating the PL(t) = B(ΔN(t)) × ΔN(t)2 relation with time t and calculating instantaneous PL lifetime τPL = −PL(t)/(dPL(t)/dt). At low excitations τPL = τ/2, while at high excitations τPL = τ due to radiative lifetime saturation to a constant value.45 Similarly, for the case of free carrier absorption (FCA): DT ∼ ΔN and τDT = −ΔN(t)/(dΔN(t)/dt). For LITG, the lifetime relation, τLITG = τ, is already included in eqn (4). Here fr is the previously described photon recycling factor due to reabsorption (fr = 9 and 26 for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively).
Using eqn (7) in Fig. 8 we determined in MAPbI3: τbulk = 1000 ns (PL), 1100 ns (DT), B0 = 1 × 10−10 cm3 s−1, and C = 1.5 × 10−29 cm6 s−1; in MAPbBr3: τbulk = 1400 ns (PL), 1700 ns (DT), B0 = 6 × 10−10 cm3 s−1, and C = 1.2 × 10−29 cm6 s−1. The τbulk lifetime inhomogeneity in the sample can explain slightly different values, obtained using different techniques. Jointly with determined Nb values, the saturated radiative PL lifetime is τradsat = 1/B0Nb = 1.4 ns and 0.4 ns for iodide and bromide, respectively. The latter indicates that in iodide perovskites PL quantum efficiency would be lower at high excitations due to quite similar Auger coefficients. This explains the much larger PL efficiencies in bromide perovskites up to 90% vs. 40% in iodide ones.46 At bulk 2P excitations τradsat lifetimes will be enhanced by photon recycling32 to 12.6 ns and 10.4 ns, respectively, diminishing the radiative recombination impact to total carrier recombination rate (see eqn (7)).
In lead halide perovskites interstitial Pb is regarded as a nonradiative recombination trap with a σh = 4 × 10−17 cm2 (MAPbBr3) hole capture cross section.70 Electron capture to the traps is much faster, therefore the Shockley Reed Hall (SRH) lifetime τSRH ∼ τh + τe, (τh and τe are hole and electron lifetimes, respectively) can be described by a simplified relation τSRH ∼ τh = 1/(σhvthhNT).73 Here vthh = (3kT/mh)1/2 = 2.6 × 107 cm s−1 is the hole thermal velocity, and NT is the trap density. Using the observed τbulk = 1.0–1.5 μs nonradiative lifetimes, we obtain trap densities of <1.0 × 1015 cm−3, being an order of magnitude lower than the used excitations, therefore our results should not be affected by carrier trapping.
Our determined B values in MAPbI3 are smaller than those reported for iodide perovskites B = (0.5–2.2) × 10−9 cm3 s−1,47 2.8 × 10−10 cm3 s−148 or 9.4 × 10−10 cm3 s−1.49 The bromide value is similar to that provided in the literature, B = 5 × 10−10 cm3 s−1.26,40 The discrepancy in iodide perovskites can be attributed to the influence of carrier trapping. Indeed, the reported lifetime in ref. 47 was in the microsecond order, while the mobility was below 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, suggesting that the dynamics of trapped carriers has been measured.47 In such a case, the delocalization/detrapping of carriers results in abrupt lifetime shortening and can thus provide an overestimated value of B. These arguments are further supported by the results of Stranks et al. who obtained Brad = 1.3 × 10−10 cm3 s−1 in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx by accounting for carrier trapping at defect states.50 Investigated crystals in our work are rather free of traps as evidenced by large diffusion coefficients, thus exhibiting only radiative B = Brad coefficient.
Bimolecular radiative recombination coefficient values Brad can be numerically calculated using the Roosbroeck and Shockley model with the equation:51 (8)using the fit of determined absorption coefficients near bandgap α(E)52 with parameter α′(E) = 0.6, 1.6 × 105 cm−126 and bandgaps Eg = 1.60 and 2.29 eV. A refractive index at the PL emission peak was ng = 2.2, 2.4 according to ref. 53; the effective masses used (me, mh in m0) were: 0.188 and 0.223 (MAPbI3); 0.25 and 0.15 (MAPbBr3).54 Our calculations using eqn (8) provided values Brad = 1.4; 7 × 10−10 cm3 s−1, being close to the experimental ones. A similar theoretical value of ∼1 × 10−10 cm3 s−1 in MAPbI3 was determined by using first principles.29
The determined Auger coefficients are rather large and dominate lifetime reduction with carrier density under high excitation. The values are similar to the value reported in ref. 55: 2.3 × 10−29 cm6 s−1 but different from the value reported in ref. 48: (2–4) × 10−28 cm6 s−1. Latter discrepancy can be due to Auger coefficient dependence on the crystalline structure.56,57 The determined values do not substantially change with perovskite bandgaps (1.6–2.29 eV), indicating that they are of phonon-assisted Auger recombination origin.56,58
4.2. Excitation dependent diffusion coefficient and diffusion length
We demonstrated in our previous work the existence of two distinct carrier diffusion regimes in perovskite films. In the films of high compositional quality, diffusion is governed by a band-like transport of free carriers. The diffusivity is high (0.28–0.7 cm2 s−1) in these samples, even at low carrier density, and further increases with excitation due to carrier degeneracy. The opposite scenario was observed in disordered nanocrystalline perovskite layers, where diffusion is governed by the hopping transport of localized carriers. The diffusion coefficient in the latter layers is small (0.01–0.04 cm2 s−1 at low densities) and increases with excitation due to local state filling and carrier delocalization.26 The control of diffusivity can also be achieved by molecular additives.39 In the present work we extended experiments on bulk crystals, where grain boundary effects are absent and the simultaneous application of 1P and 2P excitations allows us to obtain a much wider non-equilibrium carrier density range.
Recently, in mixed cation MAxCs1−xPbBr3 perovskites, the enhancement of diffusivity was observed due to the suppression of organic cation rotation by cubic–tetragonal transition.54 The latter was explained by localization state density reduction as in the tetragonal lattice (MAPbI3 case) MA cations are locked by tetrahedral tilting, while in the cubic one they can rotate and induce bandgap fluctuations.30,31 The slightly broader PL spectra in MAPbBr3 (Fig. 3) can also be explained by the impact of these localizing states.57 Moreover, a two times drop in hole mobility vs. temperature was observed in ref. 59 when the tetragonal MAPbBr3 phase transited to cubic MAPbBr3. Therefore, it can be supposed that cation rotation-induced localization states should be strongly influencing diffusion in MAPbBr3 crystals.
In Fig. 9 we show the measured diffusion coefficient and diffusion length carrier density dependences. MAPbBr3 shows considerably lower diffusion coefficients (Dmeas = 1.35 and 0.45 cm2 s−1 in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively), due to the impact of localized states. The obtained Dmeas values are in line with mobility determined in the samples, produced with the same method1, with 67.2 and 24 cm2 V−1 s−1 hole mobilities in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively. The latter values would provide according to the Einstein relationship (D = μkBT/e) D values of 1.74 cm2 s−1 and 0.62 cm2 s−1, being both 1.5 times larger than those in our LITG experiment. This 1.5 factor can be explained by the approximately two times smaller electron mobility in perovskites60 and ambipolar diffusion coefficient relation Da = 2DeDh/(De + Dh). In comparison, Hill et al.21 determined similar ambipolar nondegenerate Da = 1.3 ± 0.2 cm2 s−1 values in MAPbI3 microdomains via pump–probe microscopy, while in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 microplates ambipolar Da values were 1.65 cm2 s−1 and 0.88 cm2 s−1, respectively, as determined via photoluminescence imaging microscopy.22 Meanwhile, FAPbBr3 crystals, differing only by organic cations, exhibit much larger 62 cm2 V−1 s−161 mobility (D ∼ 1.1 cm2 s−1) due to the much smaller FA cation dipole moment with respect to MA and thus resulting in a weaker band modulation of 22 meV.62
 Fig. 9  Diffusion coefficient (a) and diffusion length (b) carrier density dependences. In (a) POPS, and EHS scattering mechanisms in MAPbI3 are provided according to ref. 26. Low excitation Da = 1.4, 1.0 cm2 s−1 and Fdel = 0.9, 0.43 values at ΔN = 1016 cm−3 were used for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively; in MAPbBr3 POPS and EHS mobilities were 1.4 times lower than in MAPbI3. In (b) LD was calculated using 2P and 1P recombination coefficients, disregarding the surface recombination impact. 
Furthermore, we perform the modelling of the excitation-dependent diffusivity. The dashed lines in Fig. 9a indicate respective mechanisms of dominant intrinsic polar optical phonon (POPS) and electron–hole scattering (EHS) mechanisms.63 Dotted lines correspond to the carrier delocalization factor Fdel, describing a delocalized carrier density ratio to the total carrier density in MAPbBr3.57 According to our previous report39 we included in the diffusivity modelling the bandgap modulation by cation rotations. The measured diffusivity Dmeas relation to ambipolar diffusivity Da (1/Da = 1/DPOPS + 1/DEHS) is expressed as Dmeas = Fdel × Da(ΔN), and can be calculated by using an equation: (9)
Here f(x) is the Fermi distribution function; xF = EF/kBT, xa= Ea/kBT, and x = E/kBT are the normalized Fermi level, localization energy and carrier thermal energy, respectively. Fermi level (EF) position was calculated according to the Nilsson approximation64 with the respective density of states ∼2.5 × 1018 cm−3.26 Calculations provided activation energy values of Ea = 8 and 35.3 meV in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively. Similar values can be found in the literature: MAPbI3 – 11 meV;65 MAPbBr3 – 35 meV66 and 40 meV.62 The latter Ea value is much lower than 60–80 meV in nanocrystal perovskites,39,57 plausibly due to additional grain boundary impact to localization. The phonon-limited diffusivities (Da = 1.4 and 1.0 cm2 s−1 in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively), used in the calculations, are rather similar in both crystals. Recently, it was shown that repeated crystallization can improve the hole mobility values in MAPbBr3 from 0.9 to 55 cm2 V−1 s−167 by reducing localization states.30,31,39 The highest 55 cm2 V−1 s−1 mobility would lead to a phonon-limited ambipolar value Da = 1.0 cm2 s−1, close to the one used in our model. Also, similar Da = 1.0 cm2 s−1 was observed using the LITG technique26 in MAPbBr3 layers grown by nanocrystalline sublimation.
Due to the large bimolecular radiative coefficients, photon diffusion can impact measured diffusion coefficient excitation dependences. According to the equations reported in ref. 32, and the already mentioned absorption coefficient photon energy dependence near the bandgap, the equation for the recycled photon diffusion was obtained: (10)
Here xg = Eg/kBT is the dimensionless bandgap. An integral ratio on the right-hand side of the equation is 0.985 (MAPbI3) and 0.99 (MAPbBr3), respectively. We obtained the maximum value of DR = 0.06, 0.04 cm2 s−1 in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 (corresponding saturated radiative lifetime values τradsat = 1.4, 0.4 ns were used). Therefore, DR < D in our experiments, and the impact of photon diffusion on our results can be neglected. At high excitation absorption bleaching appears, therefore near-bandgap absorption reduces. However, radiative emission from the higher degenerate energy states is also strongly suppressed (by lower optical mode density exp(−hω/kBT)). Therefore, the observed PL intensity becomes linear upon excitation with constant radiative lifetime τradsat = B0Nb (Fig. 2 and 3c). Meanwhile, in thin layers at high excitations amplified spontaneous emission appears, when the radiative lifetime reduces to a picosecond range,26 and consequently radiative efficiency increases up to 100%.37 The studied crystals are thick enough, wherein optical modes do not effectively overlap with the excited carrier density profile at one photon excitation, therefore ASE was not observed. At high excitations dominant PL emission is obtained from the near-bandgap states, having small absorption due to degeneracy and large photon mode density.
The diffusion length LD of charge carriers is a key parameter describing the efficiency of an optoelectronic device. LD is determined by a product of carrier lifetime τ and diffusion coefficient (diffusivity) D: LD = (τ × D)1/2. Curves 1 and 2 in Fig. 9b correspond to the diffusion length in the bulk sample and in a thin layer, respectively (surface impact was not taken into account in the LD calculations). Diffusion length reduction with excitation is dominated by lifetime reduction due to Auger recombination, while the observed kink of LD dependence in the 1018–1019 cm−3 carrier density range is due to an abrupt increase in diffusivity due to the degeneration of the carrier system (Fig. 9a). In Table 1 we summarize the determined carrier transport parameters. They enable the prediction of carrier diffusivity length in a wide range of carrier density, which can be useful for engineering the concentrated photovoltaic cells, lasers and LEDs for up to 1019 cm−3 injected carrier densities.
5. Experimental methods
5.1. Time resolved techniques: TRPL, DT, and LITG
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed in a standard back-scattering geometry using a Hamamatsu streak camera and an Acton monochromator. For excitation, the tunable wavelength pulses from an Orpheus (Light Conversion) optical parametric amplifier (OPA) were used. The OPA was pumped by PHAROS (Light Conversion) laser, operating at a repetition rate of 10 kHz. Excitation-dependent TRPL measurements were carried out using different pump wavelengths, so that the pump photon energy exceeded the bandgap at one photon (1P) excitation and was below the bandgap for the two photon (2P) case. Excitation spot diameters were determined at 1/e intensity using the knife edge method. Excitation energy was measured using a 200–1100 nm range Ophir silicon PD300-UV sensor with a Compact Juno USB Interface. The sample was placed in the beam focus of 30 cm lens to provide a homogeneous intensity distribution over a relatively thin sample. Excitation from OPA provided a spot diameter of 240/130 μm at 680/480 nm (1P regime for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively) and 75/80 μm at 1053/900 nm (2P regime for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively). The excitation wavelength was selected to provide larger excitation quantum energy slightly above the bandgap when the absorption coefficients are weakly dependent on the wavelength, but energy of one or two photons under 1P or 2P excitation conditions is not too high to induce heating or degradation processes in the crystals. Diffusion length is smaller, more than 10 times the excitation spot diameter, thus the impact of carrier diffusion to the TRPL transient can be neglected.
LITG and DT measurements were performed using the Nd:YLF laser operating at a repetition rate of 10 Hz and a pulse duration of 13.7 ps. Delays shorter than 3 ns were obtained using optical delay lines for 1053 nm probe delays, while slow transients were obtained using electronically delayed pulses obtained from the Nd:YAG laser, synchronized with the Nd:YLF laser. Slow DT transients were measured with a time resolution of 10 ns (electronic delays of 1064 nm 10 ns Nd:YAG pulses68). The excitation beam diameter was 620 μm at 1P (527 nm, second harmonic of Nd:YLF), and the probe beam diameter was 140 μm (1053/1064 nm). The diameter of the 2P pump at 1053 nm was 370 μm. A smaller probe with a diameter of 140 μm was used for both LITG and DT to monitor the homogeneous central part of the excitation spot.
5.2. Calibration of the measured signals and the determination of carrier density
The slow component of the carrier lifetime was measured via differential transmittance (DT) caused by the free carrier absorption. Carriers were generated by 2P excitation, and the maximum DT signal at t = 0 for the probe beam (at 1053 nm) is described by the relation:43 (11)
Here σeh is the free carrier absorption cross section at the probe wavelength, and ΔN02 is the carrier density under 2P excitation: ΔN02 = bI02/2hν. The factor 43 describes a decrease of the pump beam intensity I(z) during its propagation in the crystal (here τl is the excitation pulse full width at 1/e intensity). These models allowed us to calculate an average carrier density upon 2P generation. For lifetime measurements (single 2P beam excitation) it was equal to ΔNav,FCA = ΔN02(1 + bdI0/2)/(1 + bdI0). For LITG measurements (two 2P beam excitation), the ΔNav value was larger by a factor of 1.5 because of the non-sinusoidal profile of light-induced transient grating under TPA excitation conditions.43 For 2P TRPL the average carrier density is ΔNPL = ΔNav,FCA/2.
The pump beam penetration depth δ under 1P excitation δ = α1P−1 is determined by the absorption coefficient α1P. The carrier density near the surface was calculated to be ΔN01P = α1PI0/hν, where I0 = (1 − R)Iinc is the excitation energy density in the sample (in mJ cm−2), R is the reflection coefficient, Iinc is the incident excitation density, and hν is the photon energy. The average over-depth carrier density is ΔN = ΔN01P/2.69 For photoluminescence the average carrier density is ΔNPL = ΔN01P/4.
The pump absorption for MAPbI3 at 1P excitation is α(680 nm) = 2.4–2.5 × 104 cm−126,70 for the 1P excitation of MAPbBr3α(480 nm) = α(527 nm) = 6 × 104 cm−1.20,26 The pulse durations were measured by autocorrelation (see Fig. 10). The determined pulse durations at 1053 nm and 1/e width were τl = 13.7 ± 0.5 ps and 161 ± 10 fs for Nd:YLF and OPA respectively. The pulse duration at 900 nm from OPA was determined to be 152 ± 10 fs. The fitting of sample transmissions upon excitation (see Fig. 10) provided two-photon absorption coefficients β = 31 ± 5 cm GW−1 (MAPbI3) and β = 1.4 ± 0.2 cm GW−1 (MAPbBr3) for 1053 nm and 13.7 ps pulses. The latter value is much lower for MAPbBr3 as two 1053 nm photons less exceed the bandgap in MAPbBr3 than in MAPbI3 and are thus absorbed weakly. For excitation from OPA the values in MAPbBr3 were β = 13 ± 2 cm GW−1 (900 nm) and β = 1.7 ± 0.5 cm GW−1 (1053 nm). The sample normalized transmission dependence on excitation fluence I0 was fitted by equation IT(I0)/IT(0) = ln(1 + bdI0)/(bdI0). The factor 43 describes a decrease of the pump beam intensity I(z) during its propagation in the crystal (here τl is the excitation pulse full width at 1/e intensity).
 Fig. 10  Transmission of the samples under 2P excitations. Solid lines show fits for the bromide sample, while the dashed line shows the fit for the iodide sample. Normalized autocorrelation SHG pulses (see the inset) fitted with Gaussian function exp(−2(t/τ1/e)2) provided excitation pulse durations at 1053 nm (τ1/e = τl = 161 ± 5 fs and 13.7 ± 0.3 ps). Pulse duration at 900 nm was determined to be 152 ± 10 fs. Note that low excitation sample transmissions were normalized to unity for clarity. 
In Fig. 11 we show excitation dependences of DT and LITG peak signals. At low excitations LITG signals exhibit slope values of 2 and 4 for 1P and 2P excitation conditions, respectively, as these signals are proportional to the carrier density squared. FCA exhibits slopes 1 and 2, as a signal is directly proportional to the carrier density. On the other hand, at high excitations slope values reduce in the 2P case due to the saturation of absorption (see eqn (11)). The free carrier absorption cross section values, σeh = 1.6 × 10−17 cm2 (MAPbI3) and σeh = 1.1 × 10−17 cm2 (MAPbBr3), were obtained according to eqn (11). Similar values were observed in Si (0.4 × 10−17 cm2), SiC (1.0 × 10−17 cm2), and GaN (2.5 × 10−17 cm2) at 1053 nm.43,71,72 The latter can be explained by relatively similar effective carrier masses in different semiconductors.

Slope values in the log–log plot are indicated by numbers (dashed lines). In (a) the solid lines are fitting curves obtained using eqn (11). In (b) the 2P curve was horizontally shifted 10 times for clarity. 
6. Conclusions
We applied TRPL, DT and LITG techniques at one and two photon excitations in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 crystals for the in-depth investigation of carrier density dependent recombination, diffusion and diffusion length. Peak PL and DT signals provided bimolecular recombination coefficients B0 = 1.0; 6 × 10−10 cm3 s−1 and free carrier pair absorption cross sections 1.6; 1.1 × 10−17 cm2 in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively. At one photon excitations the impact of surface recombination provided surface recombination velocities S = 6 × 103; ∼30 cm s−1 in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively. The very low surface recombination velocity in MAPbBr3 is comparable to passivated Si surfaces, indicating an advantage of bromide perovskites for optoelectronic devices. It was also modeled out that one photon TRPL transients are fast due to excited carrier in-depth diffusion leading to carrier density dilution and reabsorption. At two photon excitation and low carrier densities long trap-assisted lifetime was observed in the crystals (1400–1700 ns and 1000–1100 ns), while at high carrier densities lifetime reduced due to indirect Auger recombination with C = 1.5, 1.2 × 10−29 cm6 s−1 coefficients in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, respectively. Meanwhile, the LITG measurements provided an increase in the carrier density dependent ambipolar diffusion coefficient from 1.35 to 3 cm2 s−1 in MAPbI3 and from 0.45 cm2 s−1 to 1.7 cm2 s−1 in MAPbBr3 due to degeneracy and localized state saturation. The observed differences in the impact of localized states for tetragonal MAPbI3 and cubic MAPbBr3 crystals, indicate that cation rotation-induced intrinsic localization states are strongly diminishing diffusion in MAPbBr3 crystals. Diffusion length reduction with excitation from 10 μm to 0.1 μm was observed on excitation, being dominated by a recombination rate increase in the 1016–4 × 1019 cm−3 carrier density interval. These results are important for devices, working at high carrier densities, such as radiation detectors, high power LEDs, lasers etc.

 	Fig. 1  PL spectra at one-photon (1P, 480 nm) and two-photon (2P, 900 nm) excitations at 1017 cm−3 excited carrier density in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3. Dotted lines represent 2P spectra, fitted to the red wing of the 1P spectra. The inset shows the photo of the crystals.	 

 	Fig. 2  Excitation dependent PL spectra of MAPbI3 at 1P (680 nm) excitation (a) and at 2P (1053 nm) excitation (b). Peak signal (t = 0) excitation dependences for TRPL (c) and PL peak positions (d); solid lines are fitting curves obtained using eqn (1) and (3). The excitation intensity interval in (a and b) is indicated on the plot and corresponds to the I0 values in (c).	 

 	Fig. 3  Excitation dependent PL spectra of MAPbBr3 at 1P (480 nm) excitation (a) and at 2P (900 nm) excitation (b). Peak signal (t = 0) excitation dependences for PL (c) and PL peak positions (d); solid lines are fitting curves obtained using eqn (1) and (3). Excitation intensity I0 interval in (a and b) is indicated on the plot and corresponds to the values in (c).

 	Fig. 4  Excitation density dependent TRPL transients: in MAPbI3 at 1P 680 nm excitation (a) and at 2P 1054 nm excitation (b); in MAPbBr3 at 1P 480 nm excitation (c) and at 2P 900 nm excitation (d). The corresponding fitted initial lifetime values and excitation fluences are provided in the plots. In (a and c) a dashed line shows a 43 ps response function. In (d) the dashed lowest curve represents a 1P transient at 0.024 mJ cm−2 excitation and longer delays; insets show initial transient parts of the 2P curves. Solid lines are numeric fits to the curves as described in the next section.	 

 	Fig. 5  Excitation dependent DT transient curves in MAPbI3 (a) and MAPbBr3 (b). Two-photon excitation at 1053 nm was used. Straight lines are exponential fits.

 	Fig. 10  Transmission of the samples under 2P excitations. Solid lines show fits for the bromide sample, while the dashed line shows the fit for the iodide sample. Normalized autocorrelation SHG pulses (see the inset) fitted with Gaussian function exp(−2(t/τ1/e)2) provided excitation pulse durations at 1053 nm (τ1/e = τl = 161 ± 5 fs and 13.7 ± 0.3 ps). Pulse duration at 900 nm was determined to be 152 ± 10 fs. Note that low excitation sample transmissions were normalized to unity for clarity.
