    AbstractHydrogen was successfully produced under visible light irradiation in a tin porphyrin (SnP)-sensitized TiO2 system in the wide pH range (pH 3–11) although SnP hardly adsorbs on TiO2. The number of H2 produced in the SnP/TiO2 system after 9 h irradiation corresponds to the turnover number of 410. The apparent photonic efficiency for H2 evolution was estimated to be 35% with the monochromatic radiation of 550 ± 10 nm. The photochemical production of hydrogen is mediated through the formation of the π-radical anion (SnP˙−) that subsequently transfers electron to TiO2. The photogenerated SnP˙− was monitored by transient absorption spectroscopy and its lifetime is long enough to survive the slow diffusion from the solution bulk to the TiO2 surface, which makes the adsorption of SnP on TiO2 not required for hydrogen production. This is clearly contrasted with the common ruthenium complex-sensitized TiO2 system where the adsorption of the sensitizer complex is essentially required and the hydrogen production is limited to the acidic condition where the adsorption of the sensitizers on TiO2 is allowed. The photocatalytic activity of SnP was mainly attributed to the Q-band (500–650 nm), not to the Soret band (420–430 nm) of which absorption intensity is much higher.

Broader context
Photochemical production of hydrogen is being intensively investigated as a means of storing solar energy as a chemical fuel. Dye-sensitized semiconductor oxides (e.g., TiO2) have been frequently studied for this purpose. The efficient visible light sensitization requires a strong chemical binding between the semiconductor surface and the sensitizer molecule. Many sensitizers such as Ru-complexes, Zn-porphyrins and Pt-complexes have been fixed on the surface of TiO2 through chemical anchoring groups (e.g., carboxylate). However, such chemical anchoring bond can be made only in a specific pH range and not inherently stable in an aquatic environment. This study reports an efficient tin porphyrin (SnP)-sensitized TiO2 system for hydrogen production under visible light in which the adsorption of the sensitizer on TiO2 is not needed and the H2 production is active over a wide range of pH 3–11. The apparent photonic efficiency for H2 evolution in SnP/TiO2 system was estimated to be 35% at 550 nm. Being less expensive, less toxic, and consisting of a more abundant element unlike the Ru-based sensitizers, SnP can be utilized as a practical sensitizer for solar chemical conversion.

1. Introduction
The photochemical production of hydrogen is being intensively investigated as a means of storing solar energy as a chemical fuel.1–3 Efficient utilization of visible photon energy is of paramount importance since the majority of solar energy is concentrated in the visible region. The light harvesting process is initiated by the absorption of the visible light using semiconductors, organometallic complexes, or organic dyes and subsequently followed by the charge-pair separation and transfer to initiate redox reactions. Dye-sensitized semiconductor oxides (e.g., TiO2) have been frequently studied for this purpose.4–8 The efficient visible light sensitization requires a strong chemical binding between the semiconductor surface and the sensitizer molecule in order to maximize the electronic coupling between the excited sensitizer orbital and the semiconductor conduction band (CB) with inhibiting the fluorescent decay of the excited sensitizer. Many sensitizers such as Ru-complexes, Zn-porphyrins and Pt-complexes have been fixed on the surface of TiO2 through chemical anchoring groups (e.g., carboxylate, phosphonate, and catechol linkage).7–9 However, such chemical anchoring bond can be made only in a specific pH range and not inherently stable in an aquatic environment.4,7
Metalloporphyrins, the synthetic structural analogue of chlorophyll in plant photosynthesis, have been widely investigated for their photochemical activity in various applications such as environmental photocatalysis, hydrogen production, and solar cell.10,11 The porphyrin ring in metalloporphyrins is the redox center in which the electrochemical potential is sensitively influenced by the kind of central metal ions. Among a series of metalloporphyrins, tin(IV)-porphyrin has a strong oxidative capacity (porphyrin ring reduced easily) owing to the high charge on Sn(IV)12,13 and the excited tin-porphyrin exhibits a high activity for the photooxidation of organic compounds under visible light. Tin-porphyrin derivatives have been also applied for H2 production. For example, tin-tetraphenylporphyrin (SnIITPP) complex in micellar and PVC films using 2-mercaptoethanol (as an electron donor) has produced H2 in the presence of colloidal Pt but the efficiency was low with the maximum of 30 turnovers in 30 h of irradiation.14 Tin porphyrins can be also self-assembled into nanotubes which are photocatalytic and can reduce aqueous metal complexes (Au(I) and Pt(II)) in the presence of light and electron donors.15
This study reports an efficient porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 system for hydrogen production under visible light. A water-soluble tin-porphyrin was used as a visible light sensitizer of TiO2 nanoparticles. The photochemical production of hydrogen in the tin-porphyrin/TiO2 system was investigated by changing various experimental conditions and compared with that of the ruthenium bipyridyl complexes/TiO2 systems. Unlike the conventional ruthenium complex-sensitized system, the adsorption of the tin-porphyrin on TiO2 is not needed and the H2 production is active over a wide pH range.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and chemicals
TiO2 powder (Hombikat UV-100), an anatase with a BET surface area of 350 m2 g−1 and the primary particle size of ∼16 nm, was used as a base material. As for laser flash photolysis, optically transparent TiO2 sol was prepared and used instead of Hombikat TiO2 since the turbidity of the Hombikat suspension hindered the measurement of transient absorption. The transparent TiO2 sol was synthesized according to the literature method.16 Chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O) (Aldrich), methanol (Aldrich), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Aldrich) were used as received. HClO4 and NaOH solutions were used for the pH adjustment of aqueous suspensions. Deionized water used was ultrapure (18 MΩ cm) and was prepared by a Barnstead purification system.
2.2. Synthesis and characterization of SnP photosensitizer
Water-soluble tin-porphyrin [SnIV(OH2)2TPyHP]6+ (TPyP: 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrinato, see Scheme 1 for structure) was synthesized according to our previous study11 and used as the sensitizer in this study. This sensitizer is abbreviated as SnP throughout the manuscript. trans-Dihydroxo[5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrinato]tin(IV), SnIV(OH)2(TPyP),17 (385.0 mg, 0.50 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of 1% nitric acid aqueous solution and acetone (50 mL) was layered over for slow diffusion. After the solution was allowed to stand for 3 days, crystals were obtained by filtration. Yield: 92%. 1H NMR (200 MHz, D2O) δ 9.88 (s, 8H, Hpyrrole), 9.49 (d, J 2.2 Hz, 8H, Hpy-α), 9.26 (d, J 4.1 Hz, 8H, Hpy-β). UV-vis (H2O, nm): λmax 407, 519, 550, 590. MS (ESI): m/z 129.1 [M/6+ requires 129.36]. Elemental analysis calculated for C40H32N14O20Sn: C, 41.87; H, 2.81; N, 17.09. Found: C, 41.53; H, 2.78; N, 16.91%.

The ruthenium complexes, Ru-bipyridyl (Ru(bpy)32+) and Ru-bipyridyl with hexacarboxylates (Ru(dcbpy)3), were also employed to compare with SnP as a sensitizer. Tris(2,2-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) chloride (Ru(bpy)3Cl2) (Aldrich) was used as received and tris(4,4-dicarboxy-2,2-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) chloride (Ru(dcbpy)3Cl2) was prepared according to the previous method.18
Platinum was loaded onto TiO2 nanoparticles using a photo-deposition method.19 The platinization was carried out in an aqueous suspension of TiO2 (0.5 g L−1) in the presence of methanol (electron donor, 1.25 M) and chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, 2.57 µM) under UV irradiation for 30 min (with a 200 W mercury lamp). After irradiation, the platinized catalysts (TiO2/Pt) were filtered and washed with distilled water. A typical Pt loading was estimated to be ca. 0.5 wt% by determining the amount of unused chloroplatinic acid after photodeposition. Platinum sol was prepared according to the reported procedure.20
2.3. Photochemical reactions and analysis
TiO2/Pt powder was dispersed in distilled water (1.5 g L−1) under sonication, and then the photosensitizers (SnP, Ru(dcbpy)3, or Ru(bpy)32+) were added. The typical concentration of the sensitizer added to the suspension was 50 µM. EDTA (10 mM) was used as the sacrificial electron donor. The reactor with the catalyst suspension was sparged with N2 for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen prior to irradiation. The adsorption of the sensitizer on TiO2 was measured as a function of the sensitizer concentration. The amount of the sensitizer adsorbed on TiO2 was calculated from the absorbance difference (ΔA) between the initial sensitizer solution and the filtered solution of the sensitizer-adsorbed TiO2 suspension. At pH 3, Ru(dcbpy)3 molecules were quantitatively adsorbed on TiO2: the absorption and emission spectra of the filtrate (through a 0.45 µm PTFE filter) showed no sign of sensitizers.
A 300 W Xe arc lamp (Oriel) combined with a 10 cm IR water filter and a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm for visible light irradiation) was used as a light source, and then the filtered light was focused onto a reactor (total vol. 50 mL, filled with 30 mL solution) with a quartz window. The aqueous solution containing Pt/TiO2, sensitizer (50 µM) and EDTA (10 mM) was deaerated by N2 sparging. The production of H2 under irradiation was monitored using a gas chromatograph (HP6890A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 5 Å molecular sieve column. Duplicate experiments were carried out under identical conditions to confirm the reproducibility. To determine the apparent photonic efficiency (APE) of hydrogen production, the light from the Xe lamp was filtered through an Oriel monochromator (centered at λ = 550 ± 10 nm which overlaps with the major absorption band of SnP). The incident photon flux (mW cm−2) was measured using a power meter (Newport 1830-C) and converted into an incident photon intensity (Iin: 8.3 × 10−7 Einstein cm−3 h−1) assuming the monochromatic wavelength of 550 nm. APE is defined as: APE(%) = (2PH2/Iin) × 100 where PH2 (mol cm−3 h−1) represents the rate of hydrogen production.
2.4. Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the SnP/TiO2 system were investigated with a TiO2 electrode immersed in the solution of SnP. The TiO2 electrodes were prepared as described elsewhere.21 The photoelectrochemical cell was cylindrical and had a working electrode (TiO2), a reference saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and a counter electrode (graphite rod). The electrolyte used was 10 mM EDTA at pH 5. The photoelectrochemical response was measured by a potentiostat (EG&G, Model 263A) that was connected to a computer.
2.5. Laser flash photolysis
The laser flash photolysis measurements with transmission detection were performed with the use of the second harmonic generation (532 nm, 10 mJ per pulse, 5 ns FWHM) from a Q-switched Nd3+:YAG laser (Continuum, Surelite II-10) for the excitation operated with temporal control by a delay generator (Stanford Research Systems, DG535). The transmitted probe light was focused on a monochromator (Nikon G250). The output of the monochromator was monitored using a silicon avalanche photodiode detector (Hamamatsu Photonics, S5343). The transient signals were recorded by a digitizer (Tektronix, TDS 580D). A multichannel analyzer system (Hamamatsu Photonics, C5967) was used for the measurement of the transient absorption spectra. To avoid any damage to the sample solution by the probe light, a suitable cutoff filter was used in front of the sample. The reported signals were the averages of 2–5 events. Sample solutions were equilibrated with ambient air to make the photocatalytic reaction reversible.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Activity of SnP-sensitized TiO2/Pt
SnP was compared with two ruthenium bipyridyl complexes, RuII(bpy)32+ and RuII(dcbpy)3 (with three pairs of dicarboxylate groups) for their activity of H2 production in the sensitized TiO2 system. Ruthenium complexes should be adsorbed on TiO2 in order to inject electron into TiO2 CB upon photoexcitation. Therefore, RuII(bpy)32+ that does not adsorb on TiO2 at all produces negligible amount of H2 while RuII(dcbpy)3 that can be anchored on TiO2 through the carboxylate linkage shows a marked activity for H2 production (see Fig. 1). On the other hand, SnP/TiO2 system which shows a negligible adsorption of SnP on TiO2 is as active as RuII(dcbpy)3-anchored TiO2 in the hydrogen production (Fig. 1b). The number of H2 produced in the SnP/TiO2 system after 9 h irradiation corresponds to the turnover number of 410. APE for H2 evolution in SnP/TiO2 system was estimated to be 35% with the monochromatic radiation of λ = 550 ± 10 nm (other conditions identical to those of Fig. 1). Since the APE value is uncorrected for reflection and scattering losses and the optical density of sensitizers, it represents the lower limit of the quantum yield of the hydrogen production (Φ = 2PH2/Iabs) in the present system. No hydrogen was produced in the absence of EDTA (electron donor: ED), TiO2 or Pt loading on TiO2. The H2 production rates rapidly increased with increasing the concentration of each component, then were saturated at around [EDTA] = 10 mM, [Pt/TiO2] = 1.5 g L−1, and Pt loading of 0.5 wt% (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 compares the effect of the sensitizer concentration on the sensitizing efficiency for both the photocurrent and the hydrogen production. The concentration-dependent profile of photocurrent is very similar to that of hydrogen production with the maximum observed around [SnP] = 50 µM. Therefore, the concentration of SnP was fixed at 50 µM throughout this study.

3.2. pH effect and photochemistry of SnP
The pH dependence of the sensitized H2 production in SnP/TiO2 is also very different from that of Ru(dcbpy)3/TiO2 system, as shown in Fig. 4. Since the adsorption of Ru(dcbpy)3 on TiO2 is favored only in the acidic region,4,7 the production of H2 in the Ru(dcbpy)3/TiO2 system is also limited in the acidic pH region and negligible at pH > 6. On the other hand, the H2 production in SnP/TiO2 exhibits the photoactivity over a wide range of pH although SnP does not adsorb on TiO2. This behavior is also clearly different from the homogeneous SnP/Pt-sol system where the photoactivity is negligible in the acidic region.
 Fig. 4  The initial (1 h) H2 production rate in Ru(dcbpy)3/Pt–TiO2, SnP/Pt-sol and SnP/Pt–TiO2 suspensions as a function of pH. The experimental conditions were [TiO2] = 1.5 g L−1 (with 0.5 wt% Pt), [SnP] = [Ru(dcbpy)32+] = 50 µM, [EDTA] = 10 mM, λ > 420 nm, and initially N2-saturated. 
The photochemical production of hydrogen with SnP should be closely related with the fate of the π-radical anion (SnP˙−) that is generated from the reaction (eqn (1)) between the excited triplet state of SnP (a strong oxidizing agent) and electron donors (EDTA in this case). The subsequent electron transfer from SnP˙− to TiO2 leads to the production of hydrogen (eqn (2) and (3)). The electrons injected into TiO2 could be obtained as photocurrent when a TiO2 electrode was immersed in SnP/EDTA solution (see Fig. 3). On the other hand, the direct electron transfer from SnP˙− to Pt may provide an alternative pathway of H2 production (eqn (4)). Fig. 4 (the case of SnP/Pt-sol) shows that this path is negligible at the acidic region but becomes significant only at pH > 8. 3SnP* + ED → SnP˙− + ED˙+(1) SnP˙− + TiO2 → SnP + TiO2(e−)(2) TiO2(e−) + H+ (Pt) → ½H2(3) SnP˙− + Pt → SnP + Pt(e−)(4)
In the absence of TiO2 or other electron acceptor, the π-radical anion is unstable against the disproportionation, which leads to the formation of protonated π-dianions: phlorin (reversibly protonated π-dianion, eqn (5)) and chlorin (irreversibly protonated π-dianion, eqn (6)).3,12,22 The phlorin has protons attached on the meso position and the chlorin on the pyrrole position by breaking the conjugation of π electrons in the porphyrin ring. The phlorin can be reoxidized reversibly to the parent porphyrin in the presence of dioxygen whereas the chlorin cannot.3,12,22 In the absence of oxygen, Pt catalyst can regenerate the porphyrin from phlorin by generating H2 (eqn (7)). Therefore, H2 can be produced through either the phlorin path (eqn (5) and (7)) or the π-radical anion path (eqn (2)and (3) in the presence of TiO2). SnP˙− + SnP˙− + 2H+ → SnP + SnPH2(phlorin)(5) SnP˙− + SnP˙− + 2H+ → SnP + SnPH2(chlorin)(6) SnPH2(phlorin) + Pt → SnP + ½H2(7)
The pH-dependent production of H2 in the SnP systems (shown in Fig. 4) should be related with the pH-dependent reaction of SnP. Fig. 5 shows the change in the optical absorption spectra of SnP solution (with EDTA) during the visible light irradiation at pH 5 and 9. The solution was continuously N2-purged during the irradiation and then exposed to air after irradiation. The absorption spectra were immediately changed upon irradiation and the spectral change was markedly different between pH 5 and 9. The appearance of the broad absorption band centered around 810–840 nm is ascribed to the two-electron reduction products (phlorin and chlorin)12,22 and its intensity rapidly decreased when air was introduced. Although the spectral restoration at pH 9 was nearly complete, the spectrum at pH 5 was not restored to the original spectrum of SnP and the absorption bands around 454 nm and 815 nm remained even after air exposure. This indicates that some SnP sensitizers were irreversibly changed at pH 5 and the remaining bands at 454 nm and 815 nm are similar to those of the chlorin form.12,22 Since chlorin is the irreversible product of the photochemical transformation of SnP, its preferable formation at the acidic pH explains why the production of H2 in SnP/Pt-sol system is negligible in the acidic region. In the presence of Pt/TiO2, however, SnP˙− is rapidly reoxidized by TiO2 (eqn (2)) and hardly accumulated in the solution with minimizing the disproportionation reaction (i.e., formation of the inactive chlorin). As a result, H2 can be produced through the π-radical anion path (eqn (2) and (3)) even in the acidic pH range where the chlorin formation would be favored otherwise. Therefore, SnP/TiO2 system has the advantage of a wide working pH range whereas SnP/Pt-sol and Ru(dcbpy)3/TiO2 systems are active only in the basic and acidic pH, respectively. Incidentally, the formation of chlorin does not seem to be completely inhibited even in the presence of Pt/TiO2 since the hydrogen production activity was reduced at higher concentration of SnP in the SnP/TiO2 system (see Fig. 3). The accumulation of SnP˙− at higher SnP concentration may enhance the formation of the inactive chlorin through the bimolecular path (eqn (6)).
 Fig. 5  Evolution of the optical absorption spectra of SnP solution during the time course of visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) at (a) pH 5 and (b) pH 9. The irradiation was carried out in the presence of EDTA (10 mM) under continuous N2-sparging. Upon subsequent exposure to air, the spectrum at pH 5 remained irreversibly changed whereas that at pH 9 was returned to the original state. 
3.3. Electron transfer dynamics in SnP-sensitized TiO2
The markedly different behaviors between Ru- and Sn-complexes should be ascribed to the different properties of the excited states. Free excited Ru-dyes rapidly decay to the ground state (<10 ns).23 In Ru(dcbpy)3/TiO2 system where the dye molecule is chemically anchored on the surface, however, the electron injection from the excited dye to TiO2 CB is so fast (<10 ps) that the fluorescent decay is completely inhibited.24 For the efficient electron injection, the excited orbitals of Ru-dye should be strongly coupled with Ti-3d orbitals through the chemical bond. After the fast electron injection, a slow regeneration of dye is followed through the electron transfer between the dye cation and ED (µs–ms time region).23,25 Therefore, the dye anchoring onto the surface of TiO2 is an essential requirement for the visible light sensitization with Ru-complexes. On the other hand, the free excited SnP is first reduced by ED owing to the strong oxidation power.12,13 The high charge on Sn(IV) makes the SnP ring highly electrophilic compared to other metalloporphyrins. Therefore, the excited state of SnP (3SnP*) favors the formation of the SnP π-radical anion (SnP˙−) which is relatively stable and long-lived.22 The electron transfer dynamics and the lifetime of SnP˙− were measured using transient absorption spectroscopy.

Fig. 6a shows the transient absorption spectra observed at 30 µs after the 532 nm laser flash in SnP, SnP/EDTA, and SnP/EDTA/TiO2 systems. The colloidal TiO2 used in these measurements was not platinized in order to focus on the electron transfer between SnP˙− and TiO2 (not Pt). The transient absorption band with a maximum around 680 nm was obtained with the excited SnP in the presence of EDTA as an ED. The absorption band centered at 680 nm is assigned to SnP˙− as previously reported in a pulse radiolysis study of SnP in the presence of 2-propanol.22 The transient absorption band disappeared in the presence of TiO2 colloid as an electron acceptor (EA), which indicates the electron transfer from SnP˙− to TiO2 (eqn (2)). Fig. 6b shows the normalized time traces observed at 680 nm. The excited SnP alone decays within 10 µs but the presence of EDTA markedly inhibits the decay profile, which indicates the appearance of the long-lived SnP˙− that persists for minutes. Adding TiO2 along with EDTA, however, significantly accelerated the absorbance decay. The absorption band of SnP˙− disappears in the presence of TiO2 mostly within <30 µs (see Fig. 6b) although SnP is not bound onto TiO2 surface. The appearance of SnP˙− is enhanced with increasing [EDTA] as shown in Fig. 6c. (8) (9) (10) (11)
 Fig. 6  (a) The transient absorption spectra observed at 30 µs and (b) normalized time traces observed at 680 nm after the laser flash photolysis (532 nm) of SnP, SnP/EDTA, and SnP/EDTA/TiO2. (c) Time traces observed at 680 nm after the laser flash photolysis (532 nm) of SnP/EDTA with various EDTA concentrations. The experimental conditions were [SnP] = 50 µM, [EDTA] = 5 mM, [colloidal TiO2 (without Pt)] = 1.17 g L−1 (15 mM), pH = 3, and air equilibrated condition. The solid lines in (b) and (c) represent simulated curves based on eqn (12)–(14). 
According to eqn (8)–(11), we obtained the system of coupled linear first-order differential eqn (12)–(14) for the concentrations of 3SnP*, SnP˙−, and conduction band electrons in TiO2. The curves shown in Fig. 6b and 6c represent simulated curves based on eqn (12)–(14) and were obtained by numerically solving the equations by the Runge–Kutta method.26 The non-linear least-squares curve fitting yielded the following results: kq = 1.2 × 107 M−1 s−1, kO2 = 1.0 × 109 M−1 s−1, and ket = 5 × 106 M−1 s−1 (with fixed parameters of [3SnP*] = 20 µM, (3SnP*) = 4000 M−1 cm−1, (SnP˙−) = 12000 M−1 cm−1, (eCB−) = 1200 M−1 cm−1). (12) (13) (14)
3.4. Main active bands
The absorption spectrum of SnP has a series of visible absorption bands in the 400–650 nm region, which are ascribed to π → π* excitation of the porphyrin ring (Fig. 7). To identify the photocatalytically active band, the visible light-sensitized H2 production in SnP/Pt-sol and SnP/Pt–TiO2 systems was tested by varying the irradiation wavelengths that were controlled by changing the cutoff filters. When the activation of the Soret band (420–430 nm) was blocked under the irradiation of λ > 495 nm, the H2 production was not reduced. This indicates that the Soret band is not responsible for the photocatalytic activity of SnP. However, when the Q-band (500–650 nm) was blocked under the irradiation of λ > 645 nm, the photocatalytic activity was almost completely quenched. This concludes that the photocatalytic activity of SnP is initiated mainly by the Q-band excitation. This result is similar to our previous data11 that the photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol or acid orange 7 with SnP was mainly attributed to the Q-band, not to the Soret band of which the absorption intensity is much higher (ca. 100 times).
 Fig. 7  Photocatalytic H2 production in SnP/Pt-sol and SnP/Pt–TiO2 under different irradiation wavelengths (controlled by a set of long-pass filters transmitting λ > 300, 420, 495, 550, or 645 nm). The absorption spectrum of SnP is compared with the transmittance profiles of the cutoff filters (shown by the dashed line). The spectrum of SnP is split into two regions: one (λ <470 nm) for Soret band with 0.5 µM SnP and the other (λ > 470 nm) for Q-bands with 50 µM SnP. The experimental conditions were [TiO2] = 1.5 g L−1 (with 0.5 wt% Pt), [SnP] = 50 µM, [EDTA] = 10 mM, pHi = 9 for SnP/Pt sol, pHi = 5 for SnP/Pt–TiO2, and initially N2-saturated. 
4. Conclusion
Hydrogen was successfully produced under visible light in SnP/TiO2 system in the wide pH range (pH 3–11) although SnP hardly adsorbs on TiO2. The lifetime of photogenerated SnP˙− is long enough to survive the slow diffusion from the solution bulk to the TiO2 surface, which makes the adsorption of SnP on TiO2 not required for hydrogen production. This is clearly contrasted with the common ruthenium complex-sensitized TiO2 system where the adsorption of the sensitizer complex is essentially required and the hydrogen production is limited to the acidic condition where the adsorption of the sensitizers on TiO2 is allowed. Being less expensive, less toxic, and consisting of a more abundant element unlike the Ru-based sensitizers, SnP can be developed and utilized as a practical sensitizer for solar chemical conversion.

Broader context
Photochemical production of hydrogen is being intensively investigated as a means of storing solar energy as a chemical fuel. Dye-sensitized semiconductor oxides (e.g., TiO2) have been frequently studied for this purpose. The efficient visible light sensitization requires a strong chemical binding between the semiconductor surface and the sensitizer molecule. Many sensitizers such as Ru-complexes, Zn-porphyrins and Pt-complexes have been fixed on the surface of TiO2 through chemical anchoring groups (e.g., carboxylate). However, such chemical anchoring bond can be made only in a specific pH range and not inherently stable in an aquatic environment. This study reports an efficient tin porphyrin (SnP)-sensitized TiO2 system for hydrogen production under visible light in which the adsorption of the sensitizer on TiO2 is not needed and the H2 production is active over a wide range of pH 3–11. The apparent photonic efficiency for H2 evolution in SnP/TiO2 system was estimated to be 35% at 550 nm. Being less expensive, less toxic, and consisting of a more abundant element unlike the Ru-based sensitizers, SnP can be utilized as a practical sensitizer for solar chemical conversion.
