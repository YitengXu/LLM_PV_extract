    , Accepted 6th November 2012First published on 8th November 2012AbstractOrdered mesoporous carbon–carbon nanotube (OMC–CNT) nanocomposites were prepared and used as catalyst supports for polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The OMC–CNT composites were synthesized via a nanocasting method that used ordered mesoporous silica as a template and Ni–phthalocyanine as a carbon source. For comparison, sucrose and phthalocyanine were used to generate two other OMCs, OMC(Suc) and OMC(Pc), respectively. All three carbons exhibited hexagonally ordered mesostructures and uniform mesopores. Among the three carbons the OMC–CNT nanocomposites showed the highest electrical conductivity, which was due to the nature of their graphitic framework as well as their lower interfacial resistance. The three carbons were then used as fuel cell catalyst supports. It was found that highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles (ca. ∼1.5 nm in size) could be dispersed on the OMCs via a simple impregnation–reduction method. The activity and kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), measured by the rotating ring-disk electrode technique revealed that the ORR over the Pt/OMC catalysts followed a four-electron pathway. Among the three Pt/OMC catalysts, the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst resulted in the highest ORR activity, and after an accelerated durability test the differences in the ORR activities of the three catalysts became more pronounced. In single cell tests, the Pt/OMC–CNT-based cathode showed a current density markedly greater than those of the other two cathodes after a high-voltage degradation test. These results were supported by the fact that the Pt/OMC–CNT-based cathode had the lowest resistance, which was probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results of the single cell tests as well as those of the EIS-based measurements indicate that the rigidly interconnected structure of the OMC–CNT as well as their highly conductive frameworks are concomitantly responsible for the OMC–CNT nanocomposites exhibiting higher current density and durability than the other two carbons.
1 Introduction
Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), including polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), are considered as promising power sources of alternative energy, due to their cleanliness and high efficiency, the reusability of exhaust heat, and the versatility for mobile, transportation, and stationary applications.1–4 However, the widespread use of PEFCs is critically impeded since they require expensive platinum-based catalysts. Furthermore, these catalysts exhibit sluggish kinetics for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and low long-term stability. To circumvent this situation, multi-dimensional efforts have been made over the last decade to develop cathode electrocatalysts for PEFCs that are more active and stable than the currently most prevalent carbon black-supported platinum (Pt/C) catalysts.5–12 One prominent direction of research has been the development of Pt–M (M = transition metals, such as Co, Ni, Cr, and Fe, to name a few) alloy and nanoparticles with a core–shell structure for use as catalysts.13–16 These catalysts generally show enhanced catalytic activity and stability while requiring less amounts of platinum.2–5,8,11,12 Another important approach has been to use novel nanostructured carbon supports,5–7,9–11 which have a synergistic effect on the activity and durability of Pt catalysts. These nanocarbons have included carbon nanofibers,17 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),9,18,19 ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs),20,21 macroporous carbons,22 and graphene.23,24
Among the above-mentioned nanostructured carbons, OMCs that are synthesized by “hard” nanocasting25,26 or by using micelles as templates27 have emerged as ubiquitous materials for energy conversion and storage devices, including fuel cells,20,21 solar cells,28,29 and batteries.30 For fuel cell applications, in particular, the OMCs have a range of advantageous characteristics: their large surface area enables high dispersion of supported metal nanoparticles while their highly interconnected, uniform mesopores allow for the efficient transport of fuels and by-products. Since Ryoo and co-workers first utilized these OMCs as fuel cell catalyst supports,21 a number of research groups including ours have made a great deal of progress in this area.23,24,31–50,51–71 Significant efforts have been made to maximize the catalytic activities of the OMC-based catalysts, and these efforts have included attempts to control the graphitic nature, pore sizes, and particle sizes of the OMCs as well as to modify functional groups present on their surfaces.
The use of OMCs as fuel cell catalysts, however, still poses a major challenge since these OMCs exhibit low durability.56 In fact, the durability of electrocatalysts, along with their low activity, is one of most critical factors preventing the practical application of fuel cell systems. The degradation of fuel cell catalysts occurs via several pathways. These include the dissolution of the Pt particles, the Ostwald ripening of the Pt particles, the corrosion of the carbon support, and the detachment and agglomeration of the Pt particles.72 The corrosion of the carbon support occurs because of the oxidation of carbon to carbon dioxide under the typical PEFC operation conditions. This carbon corrosion can potentially result in the weakening of the interaction between the carbon support and the Pt particles, thereby leading to the detachment and agglomeration of the Pt particles. Yet, in spite of the obvious importance of OMC-based catalysts, few studies have investigated the long-term durability of these catalysts, particularly in the single cell configuration.58,61
Recently, we reported a new type of porous carbon material, OMC–CNT nanocomposites, in which the primary particles of the OMCs are highly interconnected via CNTs.29 We demonstrated that these OMC–CNT nanocomposites could be used to make high-performance counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and that these counter electrodes could even rival the state-of-the-art Pt-thin-film electrodes.29 The structure of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites is such that it combines the advantages of both the carbon entities and should make them particularly attractive for use in high-performance fuel cell catalysts: the OMCs can provide a large surface area, mesoporosity and interconnected porous structure, whereas the CNTs can function as electrical connectors between adjacent OMC particles, thereby lowering the interfacial resistance.
In the present work, we report the use of OMC–CNT nanocomposites as highly conductive and durable fuel cell catalyst supports for the first time. The OMC–CNT nanocomposites were synthesized via a nanocasting method that used ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) particles as a template and Ni–phthalocyanine as a carbon source. For comparison, two OMCs with varying degrees of conductivity, OMC(Suc) and OMC(Pc), were also prepared using sucrose and phthalocyanine, respectively. All three carbons exhibited high surface areas, high pore volumes, and uniform mesopores. The conductivity measurements revealed that the OMC–CNT nanocomposites showed the highest conductivity, followed by the OMC(Pc) and the OMC(Suc). The three carbons were used as fuel cell catalyst supports, and they could readily support Pt nanoparticles with high dispersion (ca. ∼1.5 nm in size) that were generated via a simple impregnation–reduction method. The ORR activities and kinetics of the Pt/OMC catalysts were measured by the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The Koutecky–Levich analysis as well as the H2O2 yield calculation of the catalysts indicated that the ORR over the Pt/OMC catalysts followed a four-electron pathway. Among the three Pt/OMC catalysts, the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst showed activity that was superior to those of the Pt/OMC(Suc) and Pt/OMC(Pc) catalysts. This trend was even more pronounced after accelerated durability tests (ADTs), which were performed to test the durability of the catalysts. In single cell tests that are more relevant with respect to the practical applications, the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst showed a current density that was higher than those of the other two catalysts after a high-voltage degradation test. The half cell and single cell tests using the Pt/OMC catalysts indicated that the rigidly interconnected structure as well as highly conductive frameworks of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites were concomitantly responsible for their enhanced durability and single cell performance. We believe that this work provides unprecedented insights into the durability of the OMC-based catalysts under realistic, single cell operation conditions. In turn, these insights may help in establishing the guidelines for the design of high-performance PEFC electrocatalysts based on OMC supports.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of OMC supports and Pt/OMC catalysts
Hexagonally ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15 was synthesized following the previously described method, except the modification of hydrothermal temperature.73 8 g of Pluronic P123 (Mw = 5800, Aldrich), 251.4 g of deionized (DI) water, and 48.6 g of 35% HCl (35 wt%, Samchun) were added to a 500 mL polypropylene bottle, and the mixture was stirred at 35 °C. After the P123 had been completely dissolved, 17.0 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (98%, Aldrich) was added to the solution, and the solution was stirred again for 5 min and aged at 35 °C without stirring for 24 h. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 24 h. The resulting white precipitates were filtered and washed with DI water twice, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 1 d. Finally, the dried sample was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h in air.
The OMC–CNT nanocomposites were synthesized by a solid-state nanocasting method that used SBA-15 as the template and Ni–phthalocyanine (NiPc, Aldrich) as a precursor, respectively. 1.0 g of the calcined SBA-15 was mixed with 1.0 g of NiPc, and the mixture was ground for 10 min in a mortar and transferred to an alumina crucible. The mixture was then heated to 900 °C with a ramping rate of 2.5 °C min−1 and remained at this temperature for 3 h under an Ar flow. The resulting carbon–silica composite was then washed twice with hydrofluoric acid (J.T. Baker) at room temperature for 1 h to remove the SBA-15 template. Two CMK-3-type mesoporous carbons, CMK-3(Pc) and CMK-3(Suc) were synthesized using phthalocyanine (Pc, TCI) and sucrose (Daejung) as the carbon precursors, respectively. The CMK-3(Pc) was synthesized by the same solid-state method that was used for the OMC–CNT nanocomposites, while CMK-3(Suc) was prepared by using a previously reported method.74
The OMC-supported Pt catalysts were prepared via an incipient-wetness method. A half gram of the carbon support was mixed with 1.5 mL of acetone containing the Pt precursor, hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Aldrich).36 The amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O in the solution was adjusted to obtain 20 wt% Pt loading. After being dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight, the H2PtCl6·6H2O-impregnated OMC was heated in a H2 flow to 200 °C with a ramping rate of 0.6 °C min−1 and kept for 2 h at this temperature to reduce H2PtCl6·6H2O to Pt metal particles. The hydrogen adsorbed on the Pt particles was removed by heating the sample to 350 °C and keeping it at this temperature for 2 h under an Ar flow.
2.2 Characterization methods
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained with an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max 2500V/PC) equipped with a Cu Kα source at 40 kV and 200 mA. The morphologies of the samples were determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Quanta 200, FEI) operating at 18 kV. The internal pore structures of the samples were observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2100F, JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The porous structures of the samples were analyzed by a nitrogen adsorption experiment at −196 °C using a BEL BELSORP-Max system. The surface areas and pore size distributions of the samples were calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, respectively. The electrical resistivity and thickness of the carbons were measured using a powder resistivity measurement system (MCP-PD51, Mitsubishi chemical analytech Co. LTD.) at a progressively increasing pressure in the range from 2 to 20 kN. The electrical conductivities of the carbons were calculated using their electrical resistivities and thicknesses.
2.3 Electrochemical characterization of Pt/OMC catalysts
The electrochemical characterization of the catalysts was performed using an IviumStat electrochemical analyzer. The characterization experiments were performed at room temperature (25 °C) using a three-compartment electrochemical cell. A Pt-wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode were used. All potentials reported in this study are with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). A glassy carbon rotating disk electrode was used as the working electrode. This electrode was polished with a 1.0 μm alumina suspension and then with a 0.3 μm suspension in order to give it a mirror finish. 15 mg of the Pt/OMC catalyst was mixed with 0.1 mL of DI water, 1.048 mL of ethanol, and 0.038 mL of 5 wt% Nafion (in isopropanol, Aldrich). The resulting slurry was ultra-sonicated for 30 min to generate catalyst ink. A total of 3.0 μL of the ink was pipetted onto the glassy carbon electrode and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 5 min. Before the electrochemical measurements, the catalyst was cleaned by cycling the potential between 0 and 1.2 V at 100 mV s−1 for 50 cycles using a nitrogen-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed over voltages ranging from 0 to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 using the nitrogen-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. The RRDE measurements were used to determine the ORR activity in an oxygen-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte with linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) performed for voltages ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The accelerated durability test (ADT) was performed on the catalysts by cycling the electrode potential between 0.6 and 1.2 V at 50 mV s−1 for 2000 cycles.
2.4 PEMFC single cell test
The electrodes were prepared by a decal process. In order to fabricate the cathode, a slurry of the catalyst was prepared by mixing the Pt/OMC catalyst, deionized water, and 5 wt% Nafion solution. The amount of Nafion used in the solution was 35 wt% of the electrode. This slurry was ultra-sonicated for 30 min and then subjected to magnetic stirring for 30 min. The squeezing speed for the decal process for fabricating the cathode was 3 mm s−1, the temperature was 30 °C, and the height of the blade was 300 μm. After the decal process, the cathode was dried at room temperature overnight. The anode was prepared using commercial Pt/C (40 wt% Pt/C, HiSPEC 4000, Johnson Matthey), and the ionomer content was 27.5 wt%. The height of the blade was 100 μm and other parameters were the same as those for the fabrication of the cathode. After being dried, both the anode and the cathode were hot pressed with a membrane (NRE-212, DuPont Inc.) at 130 °C and 5 MPa for 4 min in order to fabricate the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). A single cell (Fuel Cell Technologies Co.) was assembled using the prepared MEAs, a gas diffusion layer (SGL Carbon Inc., Sigracet 10 BB), and a silicon fabric gasket (Taconic Co., Ltd.) and was used to evaluate the performance of the catalysts. Pt loading in the case of both the anode and the cathode was 0.4 mg cm−2. The electronic load (3311D, Prodigit) and mass flow controllers (3660, KOFLOC) were controlled and their performances were recorded using LabVIEW and the data acquisition system (National Instruments Co.), respectively. Fuel and air with a 100% relative humidity were supplied to the anode and cathode with stoichiometry of 1.5 and 2.0, respectively. The resistance of the single cell was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which was measured over frequencies ranging from 10 kHz to 0.1 Hz at a current density of 200 mA cm−2 with the amplitude of current being 142 mA. To evaluate the durability of the Pt/OMC catalysts, a high voltage (1.4 V) was applied to the single cell for 3 h, and the polarization curve was determined and EIS was performed again.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of OMC supports
OMC–CNT nanocomposites and two hexagonally ordered CMK-3-type OMCs with varying degrees of conductivity were synthesized and used as supports for PEFC cathode catalysts, and their catalytic activities and durabilities in half cell and single cell configurations were evaluated. The OMC(Suc) carbon was synthesized via the liquid-phase impregnation of sucrose while the OMC(Pc) carbon and the OMC–CNT nanocomposites were prepared by a solid-state method using Pc and NiPc, respectively.
The morphology and porous structure of the SBA-15 template as well as those of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites and the two OMCs were determined from their SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1 and 2). The SEM image of the SBA-15 template (Fig. 1(a)) shows sphere-like particles, with their diameter around 1 μm. It is noted that the obtained SBA-15 particles were sphere-like when the reaction mixture used to prepare SBA-15 was aged without being stirred at a low temperature (35 °C), whereas continuous stirring at 35 °C yielded elongated, fiber-like SBA-15 particles that were a few tens of micrometers in length.75 A TEM image of the SBA-15 particles (Fig. 2(a)) taken along the pores shows uniform mesopores with a diameter of 11 nm in a hexagonal arrangement. The SEM images of the OMC(Suc) and OMC(Pc) (Fig. 1(b) and (c)) show that the original shapes of the SBA-15 templates, which were sphere-like, were preserved after the replication process. The TEM images of these two carbons (Fig. 2(b) and (c)) clearly show a hexagonal array of uniform carbon nanorods, indicating that the pores and silica walls of the SBA-15 template were faithfully replicated into the carbon frameworks and pores of the OMCs, respectively. In the case of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites, the use of NiPc as a carbon source led to the generation of the sphere-like OMC particles as well as the CNTs, as demonstrated previously (Fig. 1(d) and 2(d–f)).29 The TEM image of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites (Fig. 2d) also reveals that the CNTs are connected to adjacent OMC particles. A closer observation of the interface between the OMC particles and the CNTs (Fig. 2(e) and (f)) showed that the terminal parts of the CNTs were embedded within the OMC frameworks. The formation of CNTs in the OMC–CNT nanocomposites can be attributed to the in situ generation of Ni particles during the high-temperature pyrolysis step. The TEM image of the carbon/SBA-15 composite formed using a NiPc precursor (Fig. S1†) shows the formation of Ni particles, which were subsequently etched away during the removal of the SBA-15 template by HF. Therefore, it is likely that the Ni particles served as catalysts for the formation of the multi-walled CNTs, as reported previously.76 The unique structure of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites would result in the lowering of the interfacial resistance, which, in turn, would lead to the efficient transport of electrons across the OMC particles.

The structural integrities and framework microstructures of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites and the two OMCs were determined by small- and wide-angle XRD patterns, respectively (Fig. 3). The small-angle XRD patterns of the three carbons show three diffraction lines below 2°. These correspond to the (100), (110), and (200) diffraction planes of hexagonal p6mm mesostructure. Among the three carbons, the OMC(Suc) had the smallest unit cell size (see Table 1). This was because the sucrose precursor underwent the highest degree of lattice contraction. The wide-angle XRD patterns of the three carbons were distinctively different, as revealed by the sharpness of the peak appearing between 20° and 30°, which manifested the degree of graphiticity. The sharpness of this peak increased gradually, and the peak for OMC(Suc) was the least sharp and that for the OMC–CNT nanocomposites the sharpest. The use of the aromatic precursors, Pc and NiPc, resulted in the carbon frameworks of the OMC(Pc) and OMC–CNT nanocomposites being more graphitic than that of the OMC(Suc), which used sucrose as the precursor. This was consistent with the results of a previous study.36 The fact that the peak for the OMC–CNT nanocomposites was the sharpest could be due to the highly graphitic walls of CNTs as well as graphitic frameworks of the OMC in the nanocomposites.

In order to determine the graphitic nature, the conductivities of the three carbons were measured using a four-probe method. The changes in the conductivities of the three carbons as a function of pressure are shown in Fig. 4, and the values of their conductivities at 20 kN are listed in Table 1. The results revealed that the OMC–CNT nanocomposites exhibited the highest conductivity (26.1 S cm−1), followed by the OMC(Pc) (18.3 S cm−1), and the OMC(Suc) (12.0 S cm−1). These results were consistent with those obtained from the wide-angle XRD patterns. The conductivities of the carbons would be affected by the resistance of their carbon frameworks as well as that of the interfaces between the OMC particles.35 The conductivity of the OMC(Pc) being higher than that of the OMC(Suc) is most likely due to the former being graphitic in nature, as revealed by their respective wide-angle XRD patterns.77 In the case of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites, it is likely that their interfacial resistance was lower than that of the two OMCs because the CNTs could interconnect the separated OMC particles, which would further increase the conductivity.

The porous structures of the OMCs were determined from their nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The three carbons had similar type IV isotherms, as reported previously (Fig. 5(a)).71 It is interesting to note that the isotherm of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites was similar to those of the OMCs as this indicated that the mesostructure of the OMCs in the nanocomposites was not significantly affected by the intrusion of the CNTs. The pore sizes of the carbons, determined from the adsorption branches of the isotherms, were similar and ranged from 4.9 to 5.5 nm. The BET surface areas and pore volumes of the carbons were 1264 m2 g−1 and 1.246 cm3 g−1, respectively, for OMC(Suc), 658 m2 g−1 and 1.193 cm3 g−1, respectively, for OMC(Pc), and 954 m2 g−1 and 1.056 cm3 g−1, respectively, for OMC–CNT nanocomposites.

Previously, alternative approaches towards composite structures composed of OMC and CNTs were reported.78,79 Pak and co-workers employed a physical mixture of OMS and CNT as a template to prepare OMC–CNT composites.78 Zhao and co-workers used a multi-step, sequential process to prepare OMC–CNT composites, which consists of (i) preparation of the carbon/OMS composite, (ii) deposition of a metal catalyst on the external surface of the carbon/OMS composite, (iii) growth of CNTs catalyzed by the metal catalyst, and (iv) the removal of the OMS template and catalyst to generate OMC–CNT composites. Compared to these previous works, our method for the preparation of OMC–CNT nanocomposites is simple in that the carbon/OMS and CNT structures could be generated simultaneously from a single precursor, NiPc. Furthermore, the CNTs in our OMC–CNT nanocomposites are rigidly embedded within the OMC frameworks and interconnect adjacent OMC particles, as confirmed by their SEM and TEM images. These structural features make the OMC–CNT nanocomposites as rigidly interconnected and highly conductive scaffolds, which should be advantageous for energy conversion and storage applications.
3.2 Preparation and characterization of Pt/OMC catalysts
The three carbons, the OMC(Suc), the OMC(Pc), and the OMC–CNT nanocomposites, were used as catalyst supports for Pt nanoparticles. The Pt/OMC catalysts were prepared via an impregnation of a Pt precursor, which was followed by hydrogen reduction. The nominal content of Pt was controlled to be 20 wt%. Fig. 6 shows TEM images of the Pt/OMC catalysts and the particle size distributions of the Pt nanoparticles in these catalysts. The TEM images clearly revealed that the Pt nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed on the carbon nanorods in all three Pt/OMC samples. In the case of the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst, the Pt nanoparticles were also formed on the CNTs, but the density of particles was rather low owing to the inert nature of the surfaces of the CNTs with respect to the anchoring Pt nanoparticles. The average sizes of the Pt nanoparticles, calculated using approximately 200 particles, were 1.3, 1.5, and 1.2 nm for the OMC(Suc), the OMC(Pc), and the OMC–CNT nanocomposites, respectively. The wide-angle XRD patterns of the Pt/OMC catalysts are displayed in Fig. 7. Each catalyst showed three broad peaks, around 40°, 66°, and 81°, respectively, which could be indexed to the (111), (200), and (222) planes of the face-centered-cubic structure of Pt. However, it was impossible to estimate the size of Pt nanoparticles because the peaks were too broad. It should be noted that Pt nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm in size could be generated via a simple incipient wetness-H2 reduction method. The extremely high dispersion achieved in the case of our catalysts could be ascribed to the large surface area of the OMCs as this provided numerous surface nucleation sites for the growth of the Pt nanoparticles. We had previously demonstrated that Pt nanoparticles of 3 nm in size could be supported on the OMC supports, even when the Pt loading was as high as 60 wt%.36,49 The structural integrities and porosities of the Pt/OMC catalysts were determined from their small-angle XRD patterns and nitrogen–adsorption isotherms. The small-angle XRD patterns of the Pt/OMCs (Fig. S2†) showed that the mesostructures of the OMC supports were retained even after the loading of the Pt nanoparticles. The nitrogen–adsorption isotherms of the Pt/OMC catalysts were type IV isotherms and similar to those of the original OMCs (Fig. S3†). The main difference in the isotherms of the Pt/OMC catalysts and those of the supports was the decrease in the amount of nitrogen adsorbed as a result of the Pt loading. The surface areas and pore volumes of the Pt/OMC catalysts ranged from 554 to 994 m2 g−1 and 0.96 to 1.02 cm3 g−1, respectively.

Therefore, the Pt/OMC catalysts could be prepared using three carbons with different degrees of graphitic ordering. It should be noted that the size of the supported Pt nanoparticle in all three Pt/OMC samples was similar and around 1.5 nm. This should enable one to study effects of the carbon supports exclusively without the effects of the other structural factors.
3.3 Electrochemical activities of Pt/OMC catalysts before and after the ADTs
The electrochemical properties of the Pt/OMC catalysts were investigated by CV and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for the ORR (Fig. 8 and 9). The CV and LSV measurements were made before and after the ADTs. The CV measurements of the Pt/OMC catalysts were made using N2-purged 0.1 M HClO4 solution over a scan range of 0.05 to 1.2 V (Fig. 8). The three Pt/OMC catalysts exhibited similar oxidation and reduction peaks, with the shapes of the peaks being slightly different. One distinctive difference was that the current in the Pt/OMC(Suc) catalyst in the double layer region was higher than those in the case of other two catalysts. This was due to its large BET surface area (see Table 1). Two hydrogen oxidation peaks, indicating the oxidative desorption of the adsorbed hydrogen, were observed between 0.05 and 0.4 V. In the reduction scan, the CV measurements showed a peak around 0.55–0.6 V. This peak corresponded to a reduction of surface oxide on Pt nanoparticles. It should be noted that the position of the peak representing the reduction of surface oxide was observed at a potential lower than that previously reported for supported Pt catalysts (between 0.6 and 0.7).2 This shift in the peak may be attributed to the fact that the Pt particles (ca. 1.5 nm in size) in our Pt/OMC catalysts were smaller than those in the other catalysts (ca. 3–4 nm), and oxygen species are more strongly adsorbed to smaller Pt particles.

Comparison of (c) specific activity and (d) mass activity of Pt/OMC catalysts. 
The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of Pt nanoparticles were estimated from the area of the anodic peak corresponding to the H desorption (between 0.04 and 0.4 V) after correcting for the double layer current by using the following equation: ECSA = QH/L × qH(1)where QH is the charge for the hydrogen desorption, L is the mass of Pt loaded on the electrode (μg cm−2), and qH is the charge required to oxidize a monolayer of H2 on Pt (0.210 mC cm−2). The ECSAs of Pt/OMC(Suc), Pt/OMC(Pc), and Pt/OMC–CNT catalysts were 110, 124, and 138 m2 g−1, respectively (see Table 2). In addition, the geometric surface areas (GSAs) of the Pt nanoparticles were calculated using their particle sizes, which were determined from their TEM images and the following equation: GSA = 6000/ρd(2)where ρ is the density of the platinum metal (21.4 × 106 g m−3) and d is the average diameter of the Pt nanoparticles (in nm) as determined from the TEM images. The GSAs of the Pt nanoparticles of the Pt/OMC(Suc), Pt/OMC(Pc), and Pt/OMC–CNT catalysts were found to be 216, 187, and 234 m2 g−1, respectively. A comparison of the ECSA and GSA values reveals that the ECSAs are lower than the GSAs, which can be attributed to the inability of protons to the buried regions of the interfaces between the carbon supports and the Pt nanoparticles. In addition, the blocking or anchoring of Nafion on the surfaces of the Pt nanoparticles may also limit the ability of protons to access these regions. On comparing the three OMC-supported catalysts, it was found that the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst had the highest ECSA. It was followed by the Pt/OMC(Pc) catalyst and finally the Pt/OMC(Suc) catalyst. It is worth noting that the Pt/OMC(Pc) catalyst had a higher ESCA value than the Pt/OMC(Suc) catalyst, whereas the Pt/OMC(Pc) catalyst showed a lower GSA than the Pt/OMC(Suc) catalyst. This opposite trend may be correlated with the higher micropore volume of the Pt/OMC(Suc) catalyst (see Table 1). More Pt nanoparticles will be buried in the micropores as the micropore volume increases.

The electrocatalytic activities of the Pt/OMC catalysts for the ORR were investigated by using an RRDE method. Fig. 9(a) shows LSV polarization plots of the Pt/OMC catalysts for the ORR, which were measured in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm at room temperature. The three Pt/OMC catalysts showed similar polarization curves; they exhibited the on-set potential at 0.96 V and a well-defined plateau corresponding to the diffusion-limiting current between 5.9 and 6.5 mA cm−2. The corresponding Tafel plots based on the kinetic current densities are shown in Fig. 9(b). The specific and mass activities of the Pt/OMC catalysts were calculated by normalizing the kinetic currents with the ECSAs and mass of the Pt nanoparticles, respectively (Fig. 9(c) and (d) and Table 2). Among the three Pt/OMC catalysts, the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst showed higher ORR activity than the two other catalysts in terms of both specific and mass activity. At 0.85 V (versus the RHE), the specific activity of the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst was 168 μA cmPt−2, whereas those of the Pt/OMC(Suc) and Pt/OMC(Pc) catalysts were 124 and 115 μA cmPt−2, respectively. These values were based on the averages of five different measurements over each sample. The standard deviations of specific activities were 5.75% for Pt/OMC–CNT, 5.04% for Pt/OMC(Pc), and 8.74% for Pt/OMC(Suc), respectively. Thus, the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst exhibited specific activity that was 26 to 31% higher than those of the two other catalysts. The mass activity of the Pt/OMC catalysts showed a similar trend as well. The Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst exhibited the highest mass activity (232 mA mgPt−1). It was followed by the Pt/OMC(Pc) (142 mA mgPt−1) and finally the Pt/OMC(Suc) catalyst (137 mA mgPt−1). Taking into account the similarity of the sizes of the Pt particles of the three Pt/OMC catalysts, the higher catalytic activity of the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst can be attributed to its higher conductivity than the other two catalysts. This would facilitate the electron transfer in the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst.
To further explore the kinetic aspects of the Pt/OMC catalysts for the ORR, their respective Koutecky–Levich plots were obtained from the electrode current densities at different rotating speeds. The Koutecky–Levich equation (eqn (3)) relates the inverse current densities with the inverse square root of the rotating speed as follows. (3) (4)where i is the experimentally determined current; ik the kinetic current; id the diffusion-limited current; n the number of electrons transferred; F the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1); A the geometric area of the electrode (0.126 cm2); CO2 the O2 concentration in the electrolyte (1.26 × 10−3 mol L−1); DO2 the diffusion coefficient of O2 in the HClO4 solution (1.93 × 10−5 cm2 s−1); and η the viscosity of the electrolyte (1.01 × 10−2 cm2 s−1). Fig. 10(a) shows the ORR activity of the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst for rotating speeds varying from 400 to 2500 rpm. The diffusion-limiting current densities increased proportionally with the rotating speed. At a rotating speed of 1600 rpm, the current density for the ORR was 6.5 mA cm−2, which is similar to the previous results obtained on a Pt/C supported catalyst using a 0.1 M HClO4 solution as the electrolyte at room temperature.2 This indicated that the diffusion resistance of the thin-film electrodes made of the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst was negligible. The Pt/OMC(Suc) and Pt/OMC(Pc) catalysts also exhibited similar changes in their current densities with the rotating speed. Fig. 10(b) shows the Koutecky–Levich plots of the three Pt/OMC catalysts at 0.7 V. The plots clearly show linear lines that are parallel to the theoretical line based on the four-electron transfer. The number of transferred electrons as calculated from the slopes of catalysts are 3.82, 3.81, and 3.98 for Pt/OMC(Suc), Pt/OMC(Pc), and Pt/OMC–CNT catalysts, respectively, implying that the ORRs by all three catalysts followed a direct four-electron transfer mechanism.

(c) H2O2 yields and (d) number of electrons transferred for the Pt/OMC catalysts, as determined from the ring currents during the ORR. 
The ORR kinetics of the catalysts was also investigated by measuring the ring currents (Fig. 10(c) and (d)). The H2O2 yields during the ORRs were calculated from the measured ring currents, and the number of electrons transferred could be calculated from the following equation as well. (5)Here, ID and IR are the disk and ring currents, respectively, and N is the ring collection efficiency. The H2O2 yields of all three catalysts were very low (below 2%), with the yield of the OMC–CNT catalyst being the lowest. Almost four electrons were transferred in the case of each catalyst. This result corroborated the results of the Koutecky–Levich analysis.
The durabilities of the Pt/OMC catalysts were explored by measuring the same electrochemical parameters (i.e., those determined by the CVs and the LSV for the ORR) after the ADTs. The ADTs of the catalysts were performed by cycling the electrode potential between 0.6 and 1.2 V at 50 mV s−1 for 2000 cycles. The repeated cycling at the voltage of up to 1.2 V should have significantly degraded the thin-film catalysts via several pathways. The values of electrochemical parameters of the three catalysts after the ADTs are shown with dotted lines and open circles in Fig. 8–10. The catalysts are denoted as Pt/OMC(suc)_a, Pt/OMC(Pc)_a, and Pt/OMC–CNT_a. The CVs of all three Pt/OMC catalysts after the ADT (Fig. 8) showed a significant decrease in the current density, including the areas corresponding to the hydrogen desorption. The ECSAs of the Pt/OMC(suc), Pt/OMC(Pc), and Pt/OMC–CNT catalysts after the ADTs were 12, 19, and 16 m2 g−1, respectively (Table 2). This drastic decrease in the ECSA value could be due to a number of factors, including the Ostwald ripening of the Pt nanoparticles and the loss of the Pt nanoparticles owing to their detachment from the OMC supports. The LSV measurements of the ORR activity after the ADT (Fig. 9) showed a shift of the half-wave potential to a lower voltage as well as a decrease in the ORR activity. On comparing the results of the measurements of the three catalysts, the differences in voltages corresponding to the half-wave potential before and after the ADTs were 70 mV for Pt/OMC(Suc), 54 mV for Pt/OMC(Pc), and 53 mV for Pt/OMC–CNT. These results indicated that the durability of the Pt/OMC–CNT and Pt/OMC(Pc) catalysts was greater than that of the Pt/OMC(Suc) catalyst. The differences in the specific and mass activities of the Pt/OMC catalysts became even more pronounced after the ADTs (Fig. 9(c) and (d) and Table 2). The Koutecky–Levich plots along with H2O2 yield calculations (Fig. 10) indicated that even after the ADTs of the Pt/OMC catalysts, the ORR still proceeded via a four-electron transfer mechanism.
3.4 PEMFC single cell test and EIS characterization of catalysts
The activities and durabilities of Pt/OMC catalysts were investigated further in a single cell configuration, as this configuration can provide deeper insights into the practical applicability of the Pt/OMC catalysts. MEAs using the Pt/OMCs as cathode catalysts were fabricated for this purpose. Since the same commercial Pt/C catalyst was used as the anode in all the MEAs used, any differences in PEMFC performances could be attributed solely to the ORR activity at the cathode. The polarization curves for the PEMFCs in the single cell configuration were determined at 70 °C using H2 and air as the fuel and oxidant, respectively (Fig. 11 and Table 2). The open circuit voltages of the single cells were similar for all three Pt/OMC catalysts and were around 0.9 V. This was consistent with the results of the ORR activity measurements using a half cell configuration. The three MEAs showed similar current and power densities with only marginal differences: the Pt/OMC(Pc)-based MEA showed the highest values, followed by the Pt/OMC–CNT-based MEA and the Pt/OMC(Suc)-based MEA. We believe that at an initial stage of single cell tests the difference in the structure of OMC-based supports had no significant effect in the PEMFC performances. The current density at 0.6 V and maximum power density in the case of the Pt/OMC(Pc) catalyst were 610 mA cm−2 and 400 mW cm−2, 560 mA cm−2 and 360 mW cm−2 for the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst, and 490 mA cm−2 and 340 mW cm−2 for the Pt/OMC(Suc) catalyst.

The durabilities of the Pt/OMC catalyst-based PEMFCs were investigated by determining the single cell polarization curves after the application of a high voltage (1.4 V) for 3 h in order to degrade the catalysts. A significant corrosion of carbons occurs at 1.4 V, and hence the fast comparison of the durability of the single cells is possible under this condition. After the high-voltage degradation tests, a clear difference in the polarization curves of the MEAs could be observed (dashed lines in Fig. 11). The Pt/OMC–CNT-based MEA exhibited a current density at 0.6 V that was greater than those of the Pt/OMC(Pc)- and Pt/OMC(Suc)-based MEA by 50 to 115%. The current densities at 0.6 V and maximum power densities of the MEAs after the high-voltage degradation tests were 300 mA cm−2 and 220 mW cm−2 in the case of the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst, 200 mA cm−2 and 160 mW cm−2 for the Pt/OMC(Pc) catalyst, and 140 mA cm−2 and 100 mW cm−2 for the Pt/OMC(Suc) catalyst. It is likely that the markedly superior single cell current density of the Pt/OMC–CNT-based MEA was due to the unique structure of the OMC–CNT supports. In the OMC–CNT nanocomposites, the CNTs can function as rigid electrical connectors that could maintain the interconnection of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites under the harsh conditions of the high-voltage degradation test. Furthermore, the CNTs can lower the interfacial resistance between the OMC particles.
To further explore the origin of distinctively different single cell polarizations, electrochemical impedance spectra of the cells were obtained before and after the high-voltage degradation test. The Nyquist plots for the PEMFCs with the Pt/OMC cathodes are shown in Fig. 12, and their ohmic (Rs) and charge-transfer (Rct) resistance values are listed in Table 2. The ohmic and charge-transfer resistances of the three Pt/OMC cathodes before the durability tests were similar. This is indicated by the fact that the sizes of the half circles in the Nyquist plots are similar. After the high-voltage degradation tests, the Nyquist plots of the PEMFCs showed clear differences, with the plot of the Pt/OMC–CNT-based MEA having the smallest circle. The charge-transfer resistance of the Pt/OMC–CNT-based MEA was lower than those of the MEAs based on the Pt/OMC(Pc) and Pt/OMC(Suc) catalysts by a factor of 2. This difference can be directly correlated with the differences in the respective current densities of the catalysts as determined from their polarization curves. From these results, it is clearly shown that the conductivity of the carbon support system, including the conductivity of frameworks of carbon support as well as interfacial conductivity between the primary particles of carbon support, can significantly affect single cell performance of MEAs based on the carbon-supported catalysts.

4 Conclusions
In the present study, we systematically investigated the use of three OMC-based supports that exhibited varying degrees of conductivities (namely, OMC(Suc), OMC(Pc), and OMC–CNT nanocomposites) for applications in PEMFCs. In particular, we explored the use of OMC–CNT nanocomposites as a fuel cell catalyst support for the first time. The three OMC-based supports were prepared via a nanocasting strategy and showed large surface areas and pore volumes as well as well-developed mesoporosities. Among the three carbons, the OMC–CNT nanocomposites showed the highest conductivity, followed by OMC(Pc) and OMC(Suc). The three carbons could support highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles (1.5 nm). The ORR activities and kinetics of the Pt/OMC catalysts measured by the RRDE method revealed that the ORR activity of the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst was higher than those of the Pt/OMC(Suc) and Pt/OMC(Pc) catalysts. This trend was even more pronounced after the ADTs. In single cell tests, the Pt/OMC–CNT catalyst also showed a markedly superior current density to other two catalysts after the high-voltage degradation tests. We suppose that the rigidly interconnected structure and the highly conductive frameworks of the OMC–CNT nanocomposites are concomitantly responsible for its enhanced conductivity, activity, and durability. We believe that the results of this study provide unprecedented insights into the durability of the OMC-based catalysts under realistic, single cell operation conditions. These insights may, in turn, be used to establish the guidelines for the design of high performance PEFC electrocatalysts based on OMC supports.
It is worth noting that the hybridization of two different carbon-based building blocks has emerged recently as a novel strategy for enhancing the activity and durability of fuel cell catalysts. For instance, Huang and co-workers recently reported that the durability of a graphene oxide-supported Pt catalyst can be significantly improved through its hybridization with carbon black particles.80 Our OMC–CNT nanocomposites synergistically combine the advantages of the OMCs and CNTs, thereby showing enhanced activity and durability over the OMC-only supports. We believe that when considering the results of our previous study,29 wherein we reported the use of OMC–CNT nanocomposites for high performance counter electrodes for DSSCs, the results of this study demonstrate the versatility of OMC–CNT nanocomposites as general platform materials for energy conversion and storage devices. Hence, the use of OMC–CNT nanocomposites in a wider range of applications is envisaged.
