    , Accepted 1st June 2020First published on 1st June 2020AbstractNanosized semiconductors are potentially efficient photocatalysts because of the short migration distance of excited charge carriers to their surface and their high surface area, both of which positively influence catalytic activity. Although the observation that “nano beats bulk” has been reported for several oxide photocatalysts, very few studies have demonstrated a similar tendency in oxynitrides (including nitrogen-doped oxides) for overall water splitting. Here, we report a rare example of nanosized nitrogen/fluorine-codoped rutile TiO2 (nano-TiO2:N,F) as an O2-evolution photocatalyst in a visible-light-driven Z-scheme water-splitting system in combination with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and in the presence of redox mediator [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine). Utilization of nano-TiO2:N,F improved the activity of the Z-scheme system by a factor of 3–4 compared with bulk-sized TiO2:N,F (bulk-TiO2:N,F). The performance of the optimized nano-TiO2:N,F-based system was twice as high as that of the system constructed with previously reported tantalum/nitrogen-codoped rutile TiO2 under a cocatalyst-free condition and was comparable to that of a system based on a benchmark BiVO4 photocatalyst. Physicochemical analyses revealed that the high surface area and high density of reactive electrons in the nano-TiO2:N,F both contributed to its high photocatalytic activity.
Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting is gaining attention as a possible means to convert solar energy into chemical energy such as H2.1–7 Intensive efforts have been devoted to developing a photocatalytic material that functions under visible-light irradiation because approximately one-half of the solar spectrum is constituted by visible light. Among the investigated photocatalytic materials, narrow-bandgap mixed-anion compounds have attracted considerable attention.8 For example, oxynitrides have narrower bandgaps than the corresponding oxides because the N 2p states form a valence-band maximum above the O 2p valence band of oxides. Because certain oxynitrides exhibit high photocatalytic activity toward water oxidation under visible light,1,5 they are potential candidates not only for overall water splitting but also for CO2 fixation.9 Some tantalum-based oxynitrides show good activity for water reduction into H2, and are useful components in Z-scheme overall water splitting, in combination with a suitable O2-evolution photocatalyst and a redox couple.10–12
One of the possible strategies to improve photocatalytic activity is to reduce the feature size of the photocatalyst.2,3,13,14 For a semiconductor photocatalyst to drive the water-splitting reaction, photogenerated carriers must reach the surface of the particles to react with substrates. By reducing the feature size, carrier recombination can be reduced as a result of a shorter migration distance to the surface, resulting in greater photocatalytic activity. Although some nanosized oxynitride (and/or nitrogen-doped oxide) photocatalysts have been reported for the water oxidation half-reaction,15,16 their application to overall water splitting systems remains a challenge.
Typically, oxynitride photocatalysts are synthesized via high-temperature ammonolysis of the corresponding oxide under a flow of dry ammonia.1 This highly reductive atmosphere used in the nitridation process results in reduction of the materials, producing reduced metal species and/or anionic vacancies.5 In general, the thus-produced defects act as deep trapping states for photogenerated carriers, increasing the probability of charge recombination.17,18 Although decreasing the feature size of the oxide precursor promotes the incorporation of more nitrogen into the oxide lattice during nitridation,15,16 the oxynitride (and/or precursor oxide) particles are more susceptible to reduction, which might result in diminished photocatalytic activity. An exception is tantalum/nitrogen-codoped rutile TiO2 (TiO2:Ta,N) nanorods with lengths on the order of several hundreds of nanometres and diameters on the order of a few tens of nanometres. These nanorods can be synthesized using a combination of a solvothermal method (for the TiO2:Ta synthesis) and subsequent nitridation of TiO2:Ta with dry ammonia at 773 K.17,19 TiO2:Ta,N modified with a cocatalyst (e.g. RuO2 or IrO2) showed high water oxidation activity and could be used in the visible-light-driven Z-scheme overall water splitting reaction, in combination with Ru-loaded Rh-doped SrTiO3 (Ru/SrTiO3:Rh) as a H2-evolution photocatalyst in the presence of an Fe3+/2+ redox couple. In this case, however, a bulk counterpart could not be synthesized because of difficulty in doping both tantalum and nitrogen into bulk rutile TiO2.
Nitrogen/fluorine codoped TiO2 (TiO2:N,F), has been studied as another visible-light responsive photocatalyst for water splitting and environmental remediation.20,21 In this system, fluorine codoping was reported to enhance visible light absorption as a result of improved nitrogen incorporation. This can be explained in terms of charge compensation as substitution of two oxide anions with nitride and fluoride anions conserves total charge of the system (2O2− ↔ N3− + F−).22,23 Consequently, nitrogen/fluorine codoping reduces the concentration of defects, which acts as recombination centres for photoexcited carriers, compared to only-nitrogen-doped analogue.18,23 It has been also proposed that fluorine doping into TiO2 enhanced its photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation by suppressing recombination of excited carriers.24–26 While rutile TiO2:N,F has been shown to work as an O2 evolution photocatalyst in Z-scheme overall water splitting,18 the effect of TiO2:N,F particle size still remains unknown. Therefore, the “nano vs. bulk” debate related to oxynitride-type photocatalysts for overall water splitting remains unresolved.
In the present work, we show that rutile TiO2:N,F nanoparticles function as an O2-evolution photocatalyst for Z-scheme overall water splitting with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and a [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) redox mediator. Compared with the larger TiO2:N,F particles we previously reported,18 the nanosized TiO2:N,F outperforms the bulk analogue by a factor of 3–4 even in the absence of a cocatalyst. The nano-TiO2:N,F also exhibits twofold higher performance for Z-scheme water splitting compared with the unloaded TiO2:Ta,N nanorods under each optimal reaction condition. In the present paper, the key to synthesizing an efficient nano-TiO2:N,F photocatalyst is demonstrated.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of nano-TiO2:N,F
To obtain nanosized-TiO2:N,F (nano-TiO2:N,F), we mixed nanosized rutile TiO2 (nano-TiO2; Fig. S1†) with (NH4)2TiF6 as a fluorine source and heated the resultant mixture under flowing NH3 gas (100 mL min−1). Fig. 1A shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the nano-TiO2:N,F along with that of bulk-TiO2:N,F synthesized under optimized conditions. The diffraction patterns of both materials show only diffraction peaks attributable to rutile TiO2, confirming that both materials retained the rutile TiO2 structure without forming any impurity phase. The diffraction peaks of the nano-TiO2:N,F are broader and less intense than those of bulk-TiO2:N,F, strongly suggesting that the nano-TiO2:N,F particles are smaller than the bulk-TiO2:N,F particles. The existence of nitrogen and fluorine was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S2†) and combustion elemental analysis (Tables S1 and S2†). The electronic states of doped nitrogen and fluorine in the nano- and bulk-TiO2:N,F were similar, as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (see Fig. S3† and additional discussion). These results suggest that nitrogen and fluorine were codoped into the lattice of the synthesized materials (see Fig. S4† and additional discussion). The higher concentration of nitrogen and fluorine in nano-TiO2:N,F than in bulk-TiO2:N,F, as revealed by the elemental analysis, suggests enhanced nitrogen/fluorine codoping for nano-TiO2, which has a higher Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (85 m2 g−1) than bulk-TiO2 (6.6 m2 g−1).
 Fig. 1  (A) XRD patterns, (B) UV-vis DRS and (C) SEM images of nano- and bulk-TiO2:N,F synthesized under optimized conditions. The broken lines in (B) shows DRS of the corresponding precursors. There was no difference in the band gap of nano- and bulk-TiO2 used as precursors (ca. 3.1 eV). 

Fig. 1B shows UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of nano- and bulk-TiO2:N,F. Both materials show visible-light absorption at 400–550 nm in addition to the intrinsic band absorption of rutile TiO2 (<400 nm). The energy gaps of both materials were estimated to be ca. 2.3 eV on the basis of the onset wavelengths in the UV-vis DRS. This visible-light absorption is caused by nitrogen doping, which creates energy states just above the original valence band of rutile TiO2.22 Notably, the extent of visible-light absorption of these materials is similar. The absorption in the longer-wavelength region (>600 nm) was assigned to the electron delocalization by charge transfer type transition from Ti3+ to Ti4+.27 This was probably caused by the higher concentration of fluorine compared to nitrogen as observed in the elemental analysis (Tables S1 and S2†).23 This also results in greenish-yellow colour of the materials. The more pronounced absorption of nano-TiO2:N,F in this region than the bulk-TiO2:N,F suggests an enhanced reaction of nano-TiO2 with (NH4)2TiF6.18,20
The particle morphology of the as-synthesized nano-TiO2:N,F was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1C shows SEM images of both materials. The particle size of the synthesized nano-TiO2:N,F was approximately 80 nm, whereas that of the bulk-TiO2:N,F was approximately 200–300 nm. The particle-size difference between the two materials is apparent from the difference in peak widths in their XRD patterns (Fig. 1A). Because of its smaller particle size, the nano-TiO2:N,F exhibited a BET surface area (42 m2 g−1) approximately six times greater than that of the bulk-TiO2:N,F (6.6 m2 g−1). Upon nitridation of TiO2 to yield TiO2:N,F, the BET surface area of the nano-TiO2 was reduced by 50%, while that of the bulk-TiO2 remained unchanged. This indicates the occurrence of sintering of the nano-TiO2 particle during nitridation. In addition, EDS elemental mapping images show a uniform distribution of constituent elements in both materials, confirming uniform doping into the rutile TiO2 lattice, although the nitrogen signal cannot be distinguished from stronger titanium signal because of their overlap (Fig. S2†).
The flat-band potential of a semiconductor may exhibit a size effect.28 Mott–Schottky plots for nano- and bulk-TiO2:N,F indicate that the nano-TiO2:N,F exhibits a flat-band potential of ca. −0.2 V vs. NHE at pH 6.0, which is ∼0.1 V more positive than the flat-band potential of the bulk analogue (Fig. S5†). Therefore, the effect of particle size on the flat-band potential of TiO2:N,F was not substantial, at least in the present case.
Photocatalytic performance of nano-TiO2:N,F
The visible-light photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared nano-TiO2:N,F for O2 evolution was evaluated by constructing a visible-light Z-scheme system in combination with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+. Fig. 2A shows the time course of gas evolution from the Z-scheme system. The initial stage of the reaction included an induction period for O2 evolution because of the absence of [Co(bpy)3]3+ at this stage. After approximately 10 h of irradiation, the concentration of [Co(bpy)3]3+, which was produced by oxidation of [Co(bpy)3]2+ on Ru/SrTiO3:Rh, was sufficiently high to afford steady O2 evolution on nano-TiO2:N,F. Notably, although some nitrogen evolution, which we attributed to partial oxidation of N3− anion by the valence-band holes,22 was detected at the initial stage of the reaction, nitrogen evolution was negligible in the second run conducted after evacuation. This system worked for more than 40 h and turnover number to amount of Co in the system reached 15 (Fig. S6†). These results indicate that nano-TiO2:N,F functions as a stable O2-evolution photocatalyst in Z-scheme water splitting under visible light. Notably, when the nano-TiO2 was used instead, continuous gas evolution was not achieved (Fig. S7A†). This is probably because holes generated in O 2p orbitals possess higher oxidative power that can cause oxidative decomposition of the Co complex used as a redox mediator, as suggested previously.29
 Fig. 2  (A) Time courses of gas evolution from the visible-light Z-scheme water-splitting systems constructed using nano-TiO2:N,F and (B) steady-state gas evolution rates of the visible-light Z-scheme water-splitting systems constructed using the nano- and the bulk-TiO2:N,F synthesized under optimized conditions. The gas evolution rates of the Z-scheme system using BiVO4 as an O2-evolution photocatalyst are also shown for comparison. Reaction conditions: O2-evolution photocatalyst (TiO2:N,F or BiVO4), 50 mg; Ru/SrTiO3:Rh, 25 mg; 0.5 mM Co(bpy)3SO4 aq. 140 mL. Light source: 300 W Xe lamp fitted with CM-1 mirror and an L42 cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm). 

Fig. 2B compares the gas evolution rates of the visible-light Z-scheme systems constructed using nano- and bulk-TiO2:N,F. The Z-scheme activity of the system with the nano-TiO2:N,F was three to four times greater than that of the system constructed with the bulk-TiO2:N,F. In addition, it was six times higher than the rate previously reported for bulk-TiO2:N,F, which demonstrated ca. 0.02% solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency.18 Although nitridation of bulk-TiO2 to yield bulk-TiO2:N,F was possible at 673 K (Fig. S8 and S9†), the Z-scheme water-splitting activity using the as-synthesized bulk-TiO2:N,F was an order of magnitude lower than that recorded with nano-TiO2:N,F (Tables S1 and S2†). Notably, the nano-TiO2:N,F also outperformed the previously reported TiO2:Ta,N (without cocatalyst loading)19 by a factor of two. Its activity was comparable to that of the system with BiVO4, which is one of the most active O2-evolution photocatalysts used in visible-light Z-scheme water splitting (Fig. 2B and S7B†).
Reason for the high activity of nano-TiO2:N,F
The nano-TiO2:N,F demonstrated high photocatalytic activity as an O2-evolution photocatalyst in Z-scheme overall water splitting. As shown in Fig. 1C, the nano-TiO2:N,F exhibited a much smaller feature size and, thus, a higher specific surface area than the bulk-TiO2:N,F. Therefore, the increase in surface area of the nano-TiO2:N,F can be reasonably deduced to contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. Increasing the number of reaction sites as well as adsorption sites for the Co complexes, which originates from higher specific surface area, has a positive effect on photocatalytic activity.30 However, the ratio of the specific surface areas of the two materials (∼6) is larger than the ratio of their activities (3–4), implying that other underlying factor(s) influence the photocatalytic activity.
Direct observation of the behaviour of photogenerated charge carriers in an illuminated semiconductor by transient absorption spectroscopy is a straightforward approach to investigating the underlying cause of the different activities of semiconductor photocatalysts.31–35Fig. 3 shows transient absorption spectra of the nano- and bulk-TiO2:N,F excited at 420 nm, which includes excitations from both O 2p and N 2p states to the conduction band. The spectra of the nano-TiO2:N,F show a noticeable absorption at ∼19000 cm−1, which could be assigned to trapped holes on the basis of the previous results of rutile TiO2.36,37 The similar Δabsorbance at 19000 cm−1 for nano- and bulk-TiO2:N,F suggests that similar number of photogenerated carriers were present,28 which is reasonable considering the result of the similar visible light absorption properties and energy gaps of two materials (Fig. 1B). In addition, absorption at 16000–7000 cm−1, assignable to deeply trapped electrons, is apparent.17,18 The trap states have been reported to arise from the formation of anionic vacancies. Interestingly, the density of the mid-gap states was obviously lower in the bulk-TiO2:N,F than in the nano-TiO2:N,F. Since the majority of these trap states have been reported to exist at the surface,38 the higher intensity of the signals at 16000–7000 cm−1 should be due to the higher specific surface area of nano-TiO2:N,F, and also led to longer lifetime of the trapped electrons in nano-TiO2:N,F, as shown in Fig. 4. According to a previous report by Yamakata et al., deeply trapped electrons in rutile TiO2 elongate the lifetime of holes and promote multihole processes such as water oxidation.39 An elongated lifetime of holes was also confirmed in the present nano-TiO2:N,F (Fig. 4). Therefore, it may seem that the elongated lifetime of trapped electrons as well as holes had a positive impact on the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of nano-TiO2:N,F. This will be discussed later again.
 Fig. 3  Transient absorption spectra of nano- and bulk-TiO2:N,F synthesized under optimized conditions. The spectra were recorded under excitation with 420 nm laser pulses under a N2 atmosphere. Transmittance and reflectance were measured below and above 6000 cm−1, respectively. 
 Fig. 4  Time profiles of differential absorbance at 2000, 7000 and 18000 cm−1 for nano- and bulk-TiO2:N,F prepared under optimized conditions. Excitation wavelength: 420 nm (under a N2 atmosphere). 
From the time-dependent Δabsorbance at 2000 cm−1 (Fig. 4), the population of photogenerated free (and/or shallowly trapped) electrons in the nano-TiO2:N,F was also found to be higher than that in the bulk-TiO2:N,F. These high-energy electrons are usually more mobile and reactive than the deeply trapped electrons.31,36 Therefore, the higher density of free or shallowly trapped electrons in the nano-TiO2:N,F should contribute to the high activity. It should be noted that the bulk-TiO2:N,F synthesized at 673 K, which has closer N/F concentrations to nano-TiO2:N,F (Tables S1 and S2†), showed much weaker Δabsorbance at 2000 cm−1 (Fig. S10†). This again confirms the important role of the mobile electrons in enhancing the activity of nano-TiO2:N,F, rather than the N/F concentrations.
The importance of the photogenerated charge carrier dynamics of nano-TiO2:N,F to the photocatalytic activity was also demonstrated using nano-TiO2:N,F synthesized under different conditions (see XRD and UV-vis DRS data in Fig. S11†). We observed different performances of the Z-scheme overall water splitting using different nano-TiO2:N,F materials, with the highest activity obtained at 100 mL min−1 (Table S2†), even though these nano-TiO2:N,F materials exhibited similar specific surface areas of (41–45 m2 g−1) and almost identical morphologies, as shown in Fig. S12.† In the transient absorption spectra (Fig. S13†), increasing the NH3 flow rate resulted in more pronounced absorption at larger wavenumbers (>5000 cm−1). The absorbance from free and/or shallowly trapped electrons in nano-TiO2:N,F increased as the NH3 flow rate was increased from 30 to 100 mL min−1, then decreased dramatically when the NH3 flow rate was increased further to 300 mL min−1 (Fig. S14†). This trend is in qualitative agreement with that observed in photocatalytic activity. Notably, even though the 300 mL min−1 specimen exhibited a relatively high density of mid-gap states compared with the other specimens, its activity was three times higher than that of the optimized bulk-TiO2:N,F. This result indicates that higher activities of nano-TiO2:N,F were associated with their higher specific surface areas.
However, nano-TiO2:N,F synthesized under 300 mL min−1 NH3 flow, which showed lower activity than an analogue synthesized under the 100 mL min−1 condition, had longer lifetimes of the trapped electrons (at 7000 cm−1) and holes (at 18000 cm−1), as shown in Fig. S14.† This indicates that the elongated lifetime of trapped electrons and holes was not a critical factor for the higher photocatalytic activity of nano-TiO2:N,F. This is reasonable considering the redox potential of [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ used as the redox mediator, which is +0.32 V vs. NHE at pH 7.29 Assuming that the conduction band minimum (CBM) of TiO2:N,F is located at 0.2 V negative of the flat-band potential obtained in Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S5†),18,40 the difference between the CBM and the redox potential of [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ is about 0.7 V. This suggests that only electrons trapped at 5600 cm−1 or lower energies below CBM can reduce [Co(bpy)3]3+ to drive the reaction. In other words, most of the deeply trapped electrons cannot reduce the redox mediator, and thus corresponding number of holes cannot drive water oxidation.
The increase in anionic vacancies at higher NH3 flow rates is attributable to the volatilization of fluorine. The fluorine doping occurs in conjunction with the thermal decomposition of (NH4)2TiF6. However, the fluorine doping into the TiO2 lattice and volatilization of fluorine are competing processes. For example, (NH4)2TiF6 is known to sublimate at approximately 650 K.20 If the NH3 flow rate is too high, the vapour of (NH4)2TiF6 and the decomposition product can be pushed downstream before reacting with TiO2. A decrease in the fluorine content in the nano-TiO2:N,F sample prepared at an NH3 flow rate of 300 mL min−1 was detected by elemental analysis (Table S2†). This result strongly suggests that the increase in the NH3 flow rate caused the formation of the anionic vacancies as a result of the decrease in the amount of the fluorine source. In addition, the increase in the nitrogen supply may have enhanced O2−/N3− exchange and hindered the reaction responsible for introducing fluorine from (NH4)2TiF6 into the TiO2 lattice.
Conclusions
By using nano-TiO2 as a precursor, we developed TiO2:N,F with high activity in visible-light Z-scheme water splitting. The Z-scheme system with nano-TiO2:N,F (with no cocatalyst loading) as an O2-evolution photocatalyst showed approximately three to four times greater activity than an analogous system based on bulk-TiO2:N,F. The activity of the Z-scheme system is comparable to that of the system with BiVO4, a benchmark O2-evolution photocatalyst used in visible-light Z-scheme systems. The high activity of the nano-TiO2:N,F is attributable to its high specific surface area (i.e. small feature size) and high concentration of mobile electrons.
Implicitly, visible-light-responsive doped photocatalysts have been developed using highly active metal oxide photocatalysts as host materials, as exemplified by SrTiO3, that show very high photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting under bandgap photoexcitation.41,42 However, nano-TiO2 used as the precursor oxide in the present study has previously been shown to be inactive toward overall water splitting due to its low efficiency for water oxidation reaction at the surface.43 Nano-TiO2:N,F is thus an example of a material that exhibits the opposite trend observed in metal oxide photocatalysts. The results of the present study suggest that the nitrogen/fluorine doping strategy may revive “dead” oxide host materials to produce efficient, new mixed-anion photocatalysts for visible-light water splitting.

General characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a MiniFlex600 (Rigaku) powder diffractometer. UV-vis DRS were obtained using a V-670 (JASCO) spectrometer equipped with an integration sphere. BET surface areas were measured using a BELSORP mini (MicrotracBEL) at liquid-N2 temperature (77 K). The surface morphology was observed by SEM instrument (SU9000, Hitachi) equipped with an EDS apparatus (EDAX, TEAM™ EDS System). Amounts of nitrogen and fluorine were determined using combustion elemental analysis (MICRO CORDER JM10, J-SCIENCE; HSU-20+ICS-1100, Yanaco) in the Suzukakedai Materials Analysis Division, Technical Department, Tokyo Institute of Technology. Surface electronic states were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (JEOL-JPS-9010MC; Mg Kα anode). The obtained spectra were calibrated by C 1s (285.0 eV) of adventitious carbon. Mott–Schottky measurements as well as electrode preparation were conducted according to the previously described methods.18
Preparation of TiO2:N,F
TiO2:N,F was prepared by a previously reported method18 with some modifications. JRC-TIO-6 (nano-TiO2) and (NH4)2TiF6 were mixed in an agate mortar and a pestle with a molar ratio of 95:5 unless otherwise stated. The resulting mixture was loaded onto a Ni plate and set at the centre of an alumina tube reactor to prevent contamination from Al2O3.20 After air was purged from the reactor with dry NH3, the reactor was heated at 673 K (ramp: 10 K min−1) for 15 h under a dry NH3 flow (flow rate: 30–300 mL min−1). For convenience, the materials synthesized from nano-TiO2 are denoted as nano-TiO2:N,F.
For comparison, rutile TiO2 particles provided by Wako Pure Chemicals (bulk-TiO2) was also used as the precursor. The bulk-TiO2:N,F was synthesized in a similar manner as the nano-TiO2:N,F by heating a mixture of bulk-TiO2 and (NH4)2TiF6 (85:15 by mole) at 773 K for 1 h under flowing NH3 (flow rate: 30 mL min−1). The synthesis conditions of bulk-TiO2:N,F were optimized with respect to the photocatalytic activity; the results are included in the ESI (Fig. S8, S9 and Table S1†).
Preparation of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh
SrTiO3:Rh was synthesized via a hydrothermal method using Sr(OH)2·8H2O, anatase TiO2 and Rh(NO3)3 as precursors according to a previously reported procedure.17 The Ru cocatalyst (0.7 wt%) was deposited using a photodeposition method detailed elsewhere.44
Preparation of BiVO4
BiVO4 with monoclinic scheelite structure was prepared using a previously reported liquid–solid-phase reaction with some modifications.45,46 Bi2O3 (5 mmol) and V2O5 (5 mmol) were dispersed in 0.75 M HNO3 aqueous solution and stirred for 69 h. The obtained powder was collected by centrifugation, washed with water and dried at 343 K.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted using a homemade spectrometer described previously.47 TiO2:N,F samples were fixed onto a CaF2 plate at a density of 1.5 mg cm−2 and placed in an IR cell for measurements. The samples were photoexcited using 420 nm pulses from an Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Surelite I with Surelite OPO; duration, 6 ns; power, 5 mJ; repetition rate, 5–0.1 Hz), and transient absorptions in the visible to mid-IR region were measured under a N2 atmosphere. The time resolution of this spectrometer was limited to 1–2 ms by the bandwidth of the amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR560, 1 MHz).
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions were conducted in a Pyrex top-irradiation-type reaction vessel connected to a closed circulation system. In the reaction vessel, 50 mg of O2-evolution photocatalyst (TiO2:N,F or BiVO4) and 25 mg of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh was dispersed in 140 mL of 0.5 mM Co(bpy)3SO4 aqueous solution. The cobalt complex was synthesized according to a previously reported method.29 The system was evacuated several times to remove air, and then a small amount of Ar gas was introduced prior to irradiation. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as a light source, and light was irradiated through a water filter and an L42 cutoff filter in combination with CM-1 cold mirror. Turnover numbers as to the Co mediator in the system was calculated using fallowing equation:  where nH2, nO2 and nCo are the amount of evolved H2, evolved O2 and Co species in the system, respectively.
