    , Accepted 19th September 2016First published on 19th September 2016AbstractBand structure engineering in a MoS2/PbI2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure under an external electric field (Efield) is investigated using density functional theory (DFT). It is demonstrated that the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure has a type-II heterojunction with a direct bandgap, and thus the lowest energy electron–hole pairs are spatially separated. Meanwhile, the band structure could be effectively modulated under an Efield and the bandgap shows linear variations with the Efield, indicating a giant Stark effect. This gets further support from the band edges of MoS2 and PbI2 in the heterostructure. Moreover, the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure experiences transitions from type-II to type-I and then to type-II under various Efields. Our calculated results pave the way for experimental research and provide a new perspective for the application of the vdW heterostructure in electronic and optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Since monolayer graphite was successfully isolated via mechanical exfoliation,1 great attention has been paid to the two dimensional (2D) research field, and as a result, lots of other atomically thin 2D materials, such as TMDs and h-BN, have been widely studied due to their extraordinary fundamental physical properties.2–4 Single-layer MoS2 could also be interesting as a semiconducting analogue of graphene, which has a high photoluminescence quantum yield on the order of ∼4 × 10−3.5 It was reported that the monolayer MoS2 is a direct gap semiconductor with a band gap of about 1.8 eV.6 The single-layer MoS2 based field-effect transistors exhibit an excellent current on/off ratio of 108, and the application of monolayer MoS2 in integrated circuits and logic operations has already been realized.7 Other features such as the absence of dangling bonds and thermal stability up to 1100 °C make MoS2 interesting for nanoelectronic applications.
Most recently, a facile way was found for the successful growth of freestanding single crystals of PbI2 in experiment.8,9 PbI2 is a wide bandgap (about 2.5 eV) lamellar semiconductor with a high density of 6.16 g cm−3 which leads to high photo-stopping power for ionizing radiation, and a melting point of 402 °C.10 Furthermore, the material has been considered as a good candidate for thin film transistors and can play the role of a precursor for the organic PbI2 perovskites employed in highly efficient hybrid solar cells.11–16 Among different stacking orders of an individual 2D PbI2 layer, 2H form is the most stable structure when the crystals are synthesized at room temperature. The monolayer PbI2 nanosheet shows a buckled honeycomb structure, in which one layer of lead atoms is sandwiched between two layers of iodine atoms. Although various forms of PbI2 have been studied experimentally, such as clusters, thin films and multivalent nanotubes,17–20 there are few theoretical research studies on the PbI2 monolayer. The structure, stability, and electronic and optical properties of the PbI2 monolayer were investigated theoretically recently.21
As an emerging research area, assembly of the isolated atomic configurations layer-by-layer into heterostructures (often called “van der Waals heterostructures”) in a precisely controlled sequence is an exciting research field. The heterostructure has attracted intensive research efforts due to their remarkable electronic or optoelectronic properties22–25 and potential applications as lasers, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, high-electron-mobility transistors, and so on.26,27 Since the weak vdW interlayer coupling is used, the lattice-matching requirement is relaxed. Thus, a huge number of combinations can be designed and explored.28,29 In 2010, Dean et al. introduced the first atomically thin 2D heterostructures, in which graphene was placed on the top of h-BN layers.30 The vdW heterostructures have been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically which are mainly formed by graphene, black phosphorus and TMDs; for example, the vertical integration of multi-heterostructures of layered materials for the fabrication of a new generation of vertical field-effect transistors (VFETs) with a room temperature on/off ratio >103 and a high current density of up to 5000 A cm−2.31 Also, MoS2 and WS2 comprise a vertically-stacked heterostructure through the CVD method and the material reveals diode-like behavior with clear current rectification, confirming the formation of high-quality heterointerfaces.32 The DFT calculation on the structural and electronic properties of the p-type black-P/n-type blue-P vdW heterostructure is performed to supply theoretical guidance to apply in nano- and opto-electronics.33
Modulating the electronic structure in a well-controlled manner is crucial for applications in nanodevices. To achieve tunable band structures of the 2D materials, the widely used electronic engineering strategy is the application of an external electric field.23,24,34,35 Therefore, an external perpendicular Efield was used to modify the electronic properties of the vdW heterostructure. Although the electronic properties of graphene/BN, graphene/TMDs, and TMDs/TMD heterostructures36–38 have been studied, few reports focus on the bandgap tuning of the heterobilayers using an external electric field. Also, there is no literature regarding the vdW heterostructures formed by PbI2.
In this article, we aim to investigate the electronic structure tuning in the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure. An Efield was used along the z direction as an efficient method to tune the electronic properties. Accordingly, the corresponding projected band structures, band edges, band alignments as well as charge transfer with and without an Efield were calculated. A bandgap function is used to explore the linear variation with the electric field. The present results are beneficial to supply theoretical guidance on efficiently synthesizing MoS2/PbI2 devices for use in future nano- and optoelectronics.
2. Computational methods
All the DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.39,40 The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method was applied to describe electron–ion interactions.41,42 The exchange–correlation potentials were described through the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) formalism.42 The heterobilayer is built by 3 × 3 cells of MoS2 and 2 × 2 cells of PbI2. A plane wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 440 eV and a 5 × 5 × 1 k-point grid determined by a fine grid of gamma-centered Monkhorst–Pack method43 in the Brillouin zone were found to give good converged results. Gaussian smearing was used to determine the partial occupancies for each orbital with the smearing width of 0.05 eV by convergence test. The atomic structures were relaxed using a conjugate gradient algorithm as implemented in the VASP code until the forces on all unconstrained atoms were smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. Additionally, spin–orbital-coupling44 is expected to be a significant influence on the heavy atoms, therefore, it was considered in all calculations. A vacuum region of 20 Å along the z direction was used to separate the two heterostructures in order to avoid spurious interactions due to the nonlocal nature of the correlation energy.45 The zero damping DFT-D3 method of Gimme46 is used to account for the long range vdW interaction between monolayers MoS2 and PbI2. All of the structural figures and charge density drawings are produced using the VESTA package.47
The binding energy (Eb) of the MoS2/PbI2 bilayer was calculated to determine the interaction between MoS2 and PbI2 layers which is defined asEb = (EMoS2/PbI2 − EMoS2 − EPbI2)/n,where EMoS2/PbI2, EMoS2 and EPbI2 represent the total energy of the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure, and MoS2 and PbI2 monolayers, respectively, and n is the number of [MoS2] unit cells in the supercell.
The averaged difference electron density of the heterostructure along the z direction is defined as:  where ρMoS2/PbI2(x,y,z), ρMoS2(x,y,z) and ρPbI2(x,y,z) are the charge density at the (x,y,z) point in the MoS2/PbI2 bilayer, and MoS2 and PbI2 monolayers, respectively. Therefore, positive values indicate charge accumulation at the position, and negative values mean the charge depletion.
What is more, an external field will exert influence on transferring charges in the heterostructure. The integrated charge density difference with an Efield along the z direction is determined as  where  and  are the charge density at the (x,y,z) point in the heterobilayer of the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure with and without an Efield.
3. Results and discussion
The lattice constants of monolayers MoS2 and PbI2 are optimized, which are, respectively, obtained as 3.16 Å and 4.67 Å, and are in agreement with experimental values and other DFT values as well.21,36 The properties of monolayers MoS2 and PbI2 are very sensitive to in-plane strains.21,48,49 To minimize the lattice mismatch between the stacking blocks, the supercell of this heterostructure is built by 3 × 3 of MoS2 cells and 2 × 2 of PbI2 cells, whose overall mismatch in both MoS2 and PbI2 lattices is less than 1.5%. The top (upper and below panels) and side views of the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure are presented in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The thicknesses of monolayers and the distance between MoS2 and PbI2 single-layers are, respectively, marked with h and d as shown in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 1(c) presents the Brillouin zone of the hexagonal cell with high symmetry k-points labeled.

(d–f) Top(upper panel) and cross views of C-type stacking, S-type stacking and M-type stacking, respectively. In all of this text, the colors of the molybdenum (Mo), sulfur (S), lead (Pb) and iodine (I) atoms are identified by pink-purple, yellow, gray and purple colors, respectively. 
With different stacking conformations, the monolayers MoS2 and PbI2 can form three different heterobilayers which are, respectively, depicted in Fig. 1(d)–(f) which are separately named as C-type, S-type and M-type. The stacking polytypisms can transform into one another by horizontal lay sliding. The optimized structural parameters and the binding energies are given in Table 1. Among the different heterostructures considered here, the most stable heterobilayer is M-type stacking (from Table 1). So, we only discuss the situation of M-type in the following. The interlayer distance between monolayers MoS2 and PbI2 is 3.531 Å which is much larger than the sum of the covalent radii of S and I atoms, indicating that two building blocks are beyond the bonding range. The binding energy of the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure is negligible with a value of −0.234 eV per unit, which has the same magnitude as other vdW crystals,50–52 demonstrating that the weak van der Waals interaction has effects on the heterostructure of MoS2/PbI2.

The band structures of monolayers as well as the projected band structure of the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c). The MoS2 monolayer shows a finite direct band gap of 1.66 eV, while the PbI2 monolayer possesses an indirect bandgap of 1.85 eV, agreeing well with other results.21,25 As shown in Fig. 2(a), the smallest bandgap of the MoS2 monolayer appears at the high symmetry points of point K in the Brillouin zone. For the PbI2 monolayer, the conduction band minimum (CBM) is located at the Γ point, while the valance band maximum (VBM) is located in the K–Γ direction as shown in Fig. 2(b). In the projected band structure of the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterobilayer (Fig. 2(c)), the bands plotted in blue and red indicate the bands dominated by MoS2 and PbI2, respectively. Obviously, the CBM and the VBM of the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure are localized on PbI2 and MoS2, respectively. Therefore, a type-II band alignment of the vdW heterostructure with a direct bandgap of 1.28 eV is formed at the MoS2/PbI2 interface which will spontaneously separate the free electrons and holes, enabling the high efficiency optoelectronics and solar energy conversion. The electronic structure of the PbI2 monolayer is well preserved. Additionally, due to the interlayer vdW interaction, the projected band structure of MoS2 in the heterostructure changes to an indirect bandgap compared to the monolayer.48 Band offsets of the heterostructures are given in Fig. 2(b) for comparison with the band structure. It is clear that the VBM and the CBM are, respectively, localized on MoS2 and PbI2, demonstrating that the type-II heterostructure was formed.

(d) Band alignments of monolayer MoS2, monolayer PbI2 and the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure. Relevant electronic parameters are also given in the figure. The blue dotted lines are the Fermi level. The vacuum level is taken as a reference. 
Meanwhile, the work function (W = EVac. − EF, where EVac. and EF are the vacuum level (EVac.) and the Fermi level (EF), respectively) and the band alignment are shown in Fig. 2(b). The work function of the MoS2/PbI2 heterobilayer is a little larger than the monolayer MoS2, and 0.25 eV smaller than PbI2.
When applied to nano-electronic devices, the system is always subjected to an Efield to tune its electronic properties. So an external electric field perpendicular to the heterobilayer is used in the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure. The direction of the Efield from the PbI2 layer to MoS2 is taken as the positive direction. Evolution of the bandgap of the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure as a function of the applied Efield is shown in Fig. 3(b). The bandgap is continuously tuned under the Efield, eventually achieving a semiconductor–metal transition in critical fields. The bandgap varies linearly with the Efield indicating a giant Stark effect. It is almost linearly reduced with the strength of the Efield reducing to zero bandgap at the Efield of about 0.18 V Å−1 by the positive direction. When the system is subjected to a negative Efield, the biggest bandgap reaching up to 1.64 eV appears at an Efield of about 0.07 V Å−1. This is due to the presence of intrinsic spontaneous electric polarization which is opposite to the Efield and has a superimposing effect on it. The bandgap firstly increases until −0.07 eV, but then, it decreases linearly and eventually turns metallic at about −0.30 V Å−1.
 Fig. 3  (a and b) The evolution of the bandgap and band edge, respectively, in the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure as a function of the Efield. CBMMoS2(PbI2) and VBMMoS2(PbI2) are the CBM and the VBM of MoS2(PbI2) in the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure. 
To gain a further insight, band edges dominated by MoS2 and PbI2 under various Efields are calculated and shown in Fig. 3(b). The CBM and the VBM of MoS2(PbI2) of the MoS2/PbI2 heterobilayer are denoted CBMMoS2(PbI2) and VBMMoS2(PbI2), respectively. Both the CBM and the VBM of MoS2 increase linearly with the Efield, while the CBM and the VBM of PbI2 show a linear decline. The Efield exerts little influence on the respective bandgaps of MoS2 and PbI2. The bandgap of the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure gives the same variation trend as observed in Fig. 3(a). Additionally, the band alignment changes from type-II to type-I heterojunction separated by the Efield by about −0.06 V Å−1 and then from type-I to type-II by about −0.08 V Å−1, resulting in different spatial distributions of the lowest energy electrons and holes.
Similar evidence is also obtained from the band alignment of the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure under various Efields, as seen in Fig. 4. The quasi-Fermi level of MoS2(PbI2) in the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterobilayer is represented by Ef-MoS2(PbI2). The conduction band offset of the heterostructure without an Efield is denoted as VD. V = Efield × d is the external electric potential, which leads to the divergence of the quasi-Fermi levels. d is the interlayer distance, which is a constant in this system. When the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure is subjected to a negative Efield, the bandgap varies with the Efield in the following function:  
 Fig. 4  (a–d) The band alignments and partial charge densities from the CBM and the VBM under different Efields. The isosurfaces of band decomposed charge density are, respectively, −0.15 V Å−1 (the CBM is located at M and the VBM is between K and Γ), −0.07 V Å−1 (the CBM is at M and the VBM at Γ), 0 V Å−1 (the CBM and the VBM are all at Γ) and 0.15 V Å−1 (the CBM and the VBM are all at Γ). All isosurfaces of this text are set to 0.004 e Å−3. 
The maximum bandgap is obtained when the Efield ranges from −0.06 V Å−1 to −0.08 V Å−1.Eg = Eg(MoS2) ≈ 1.63 eV.
In the case of the Efield greater than 0.08 V Å−1 in the negative direction, the bandgap linearly decreases as the function:Eg = Eg(MoS2) − e × (Efield − 0.08) d.
The partial charge densities of the heterostructure from the CBM and the VBM under different Efields are calculated and summarized in Fig. 4. When the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterobilayer is subjected to a negative Efield greater than 0.08 V Å−1, it is clearly shown that the partial charge density from the CBM is dominated by Mo and S atoms and the VBM comes mainly from the PbI2 layer, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Both the CBM and the VBM of the heterobilayer, when the Efield ranges from −0.06 V Å−1 to −0.08 V Å−1, are completely composed of the MoS2 layer (Fig. 4(b)) indicating a type-I heterojunction. The band alignment changes to type-II with the negative Efield less than 0.06 V Å−1 and the positive Efield. In this Efield range, the charge density of the VBM comes from Pb atoms as well as the VBM from Mo atoms. Briefly, the Efield can result in modulation of the bandgap and band offsets.
The difference between the integrated charge density monolayer of the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure without an Efield (Fig. 5(a)) was calculated to make it clear how an Efield modulates the electronic properties of the system. The vertical blue short dash line means the intermediate position for the interface of the monolayers. The positions of S, Mo, Pb and I atomic layers are marked as yellow, pink-purple, gray and purple short dotted lines, respectively. The numbers of transferred electrons were obtained through integrating the charge density. Obviously, there is a small amount of electrons (about 1.1807 × 10−3|e|) transferring from PbI2 to the MoS2 layer, further indicating a weak interlayer coupling between the MoS2 layer and the PbI2 layer. As a result, an intrinsic electric field is induced with its direction pointing from the PbI2 layer to the MoS2 layer corresponding to the previous text.

(b and c) The integrated charge density difference in the heterobilayer under various Efields, respectively. The blue vertical dashed line denotes the intermediate position of the two monolayers. 
What is more, an external electric field will exert influence on the charge transfer of the heterostructure. To shed more light on the influence of the Efield, the integrated charge densities under different Efields were calculated and are shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c). The charge redistribution is mainly on the surface of MoS2 and PbI2 layers regardless of the strength and direction of the Efield. The positive charges (holes) tend to transfer from the PbI2 layer to the MoS2 layer and negative charges (electrons) transfer from the MoS2 layer to the PbI2 layer in the case of a negative Efield, and a positive Efield leads to the opposite direction charge and hole transfer. Also, the amount of transferring electrons increases with the strength of the applied Efield, no matter what the direction of the Efield is. More charge transfer between MoS2 and PbI2 layers suggests a stronger interlayer interaction, leading to the shift of band edges.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the band structure of the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure under an Efield has well-controlled electronic properties. The most stable M-type stacking heterobilayer is a direct bandgap with an intrinsic type-II band alignment. The spatial separation of the lowest energy electron–hole pairs can be realized and make MoS2/PbI2 a good candidate for application in optoelectronics. The electronic structure can be effectively modulated under an Efield. The bandgap is continuously tuned with the Efield, eventually achieving a semiconductor–metal transition in critical fields. It is clear that the bandgap varies linearly with the Efield indicating a giant Stark effect. The variation of band edges and the quasi-Fermi level has the same evidence on the bandgap variation. Additionally, the band alignment changes from type-II to type-I heterojunction separated by the Efield by about 0.06 V Å−1 and then from type-I to type-II by about 0.08 V Å−1, resulting in different spatial distributions of the lowest energy electrons and holes. The amount of charge transfer also increases with the strength of the applied Efield. According to our results, the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure will present abundant opportunities for application in future nano- and opto-electronic devices.

 	Fig. 2  (a–c) Band structures of monolayer MoS2, monolayer PbI2 and the MoS2/PbI2 heterobilayer. The Fermi level is set to zero. (d) Band alignments of monolayer MoS2, monolayer PbI2 and the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure. Relevant electronic parameters are also given in the figure. The blue dotted lines are the Fermi level. The vacuum level is taken as a reference.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a and b) The evolution of the bandgap and band edge, respectively, in the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure as a function of the Efield. CBMMoS2(PbI2) and VBMMoS2(PbI2) are the CBM and the VBM of MoS2(PbI2) in the MoS2/PbI2 vdW heterostructure.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 4  (a–d) The band alignments and partial charge densities from the CBM and the VBM under different Efields. The isosurfaces of band decomposed charge density are, respectively, −0.15 V Å−1 (the CBM is located at M and the VBM is between K and Γ), −0.07 V Å−1 (the CBM is at M and the VBM at Γ), 0 V Å−1 (the CBM and the VBM are all at Γ) and 0.15 V Å−1 (the CBM and the VBM are all at Γ). All isosurfaces of this text are set to 0.004 e Å−3.	 
Eg = Eg(MoS2) ≈ 1.63 eV.
Eg = Eg(MoS2) − e × (Efield − 0.08) d.

 	Fig. 5  (a) The averaged difference electron density of the MoS2/PbI2 heterostructure along the z direction. (b and c) The integrated charge density difference in the heterobilayer under various Efields, respectively. The blue vertical dashed line denotes the intermediate position of the two monolayers.
