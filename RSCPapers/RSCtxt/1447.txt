    , Accepted 22nd July 2021First published on 22nd July 2021AbstractThe incorporation of plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs) into the multilayered architecture of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been a recurrent strategy to enhance the performance of photovoltaic devices from the early development of this technology. However, the specific photophysical interactions between the metal NPs and the hybrid halide perovskites are still not completely understood. Herein, we investigate the influence of Au NPs on the photoluminescence (PL) signal of a thin layer of the CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid perovskite. Core–shell Au@SiO2 NPs with a tunable thickness of the SiO2 shell were used to adjust the interaction distance between the plasmonic NPs and the perovskite layer. Complete quenching of the PL signal in the presence of the Au NPs is measured together with the gradual recovery of the PL intensity at a thicker thickness of the SiO2 shell. A nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET) model is employed to reasonably fit the experimental quenching efficiency. Thus, the energy transfer deactivation is revealed as a detrimental process occurring in the PSCs since it funnels the photon energy into the non-active excited state of the Au NPs. This work indicates that tuning the distance between the plasmonic NPs and the perovskite materials by a silica shell may be a simple and straightforward strategy for further improving the efficiency of PSCs.
Introduction
The advent of hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites as absorber materials in solar devices has caused an incredible impact on the field of materials science in the last few years.1,2 The extraordinary optoelectronic properties and ease of preparation of the halide perovskites have encouraged their implementation in several applications, for example, light-emitting devices,3,4 photodetectors,5,6 lasing7,8 and photocatalysis.9,10 Additionally, the hybrid perovskites have been combined with other advanced materials to enhance their optoelectronic features or to develop innovative applications.11 Thus, two-dimensional hybrid perovskites have been merged with chiral organic molecules to develop spintronics and quantum computing12 or with graphene aiming at improving the stability and performance of photodetectors and photocatalysts.13 In particular, one of the first approaches to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was to incorporate core–shell gold–SiO2 nanoparticles into the perovskite layer.14
Plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) are characterized by the resonance between the oscillation of the surface electrons and the coherent electromagnetic radiation, namely the so-called plasmonic effect.15 Plasmonic NPs exhibit strong UV-visible optical absorption and far-field light scattering which are strongly dependent on the size and shape of the NPs.16 Thus, the incorporation of plasmonic metal NPs in PSCs may improve the light harvesting in these devices and therefore facilitate the reduction of the amount of toxic Pb atoms in the solar cells.17,18 However, the published articles typically report minor improvements in the device performance when core–shell Au or Ag NPs are incorporated into the active layer or hole transporting layers of PSCs.19–21 Moreover, although enhancement of light absorption is the dominant explanation employed in organic solar cells (OSCs) for the increased performance, other different mechanisms have been proposed in PSCs to account for the improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) associated with a higher short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc).22–25 A reduction of the exciton binding energy (Eb) with a concomitant increase in the generation of free charge carriers has been suggested to explain the performance increase in PSCs with Au@SiO2 NPs added to the photoactive layer.14,26 A novel photon recycling scheme involving faster radiative decay of the excitons together with reabsorption of the emitted light has been proposed to account for an almost 20% increase of the PCE value in PSCs with Ag@TiO2 NPs in the active layer.20
Despite the reported improvement in the performance of PSCs by using plasmonic NPs, there is certain evidence pointing out that plasmonic NPs might also interact with the hybrid perovskites via charge recombination or exciton quenching.24 In particular, it is described in the literature that the incorporation of plasmonic NPs may yield a decrease of the photoluminescence (PL) which is not easily explained by the light harvesting mechanism.14,19,27 Different tentative mechanisms have been proposed to account for exciton quenching even though they are not well understood and require additional experimental investigations.
In this article, we explore the dependence of the PL intensity of a thin film of the archetypal CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) hybrid perovskite on the spacing to Au NPs using different thicknesses of SiO2 in the core–shell Au@SiO2 NPs. The interactions between the perovskite layer and the Au NP layer were non-specific, i.e., the perovskite layer was built on top of the Au NP layer. There were no specific or directed chemical interactions between the silica surface and the growing perovskite layer. The steady-state absorption spectrum of a thin film of plasmonic Au NPs displays a red tail overlapping with the PL spectrum of the MAPbI3 perovskite. This fact suggests the activation of an energy transfer process that might explain the PL quenching observed in many PSCs. Thus, the quenching efficiency measured for different thicknesses of the SiO2 shell in the Au NPs is simulated with a nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET) model, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.
The reported studies on hybrid perovskites/metal NP composites display PL quenching dependent on the metal employed in the NPs, nature of the shell and position of the metal NPs in the multilayered structure of the PSCs.20,27,28 In this study, we have deposited both materials as homogeneous thin layers on top of each other to fine control the distance between the Au NPs and the MAPbI3 perovskite. Scheme 1 displays the arrangement of the two layers with the plasmonic metal NPs deposited on top of a glass substrate through a spray pyrolysis method and a 100 nm thick layer of the MAPbI3 perovskite prepared using the spin-coating method lying on the NP film. The low thickness of the MAPbI3 layer and the penetration of the MAPbI3 in the NP layer guarantees that the majority of the photoinduced excitons or electron–hole carriers generated in the perovskite may diffuse to interact with the metal NPs before charge recombination since the carrier diffusion lengths are larger (LD ≈ 100 nm).29

Fig. 1 presents the UV-vis absorption spectra of the Au NPs in DMF solution and those deposited as a thin layer before adding the MAPbI3 perovskite film. The UV-vis absorption spectra in solution and in thin layers display the characteristic plasmon peak centered at 525 nm related to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of 20 nm diameter Au NPs. We do not observe any additional significant absorption signal in the thin layers due to potential plasmon coupling of the adjacent NPs, indicating reduced or no aggregation of the NPs.30,31Fig. 1 also shows the PL spectrum of a film of the MAPbI3 hybrid perovskite with a typical PL peak centered at 765 nm (see Fig. S5† for the XRD pattern). The low energy region of the absorption spectrum of the Au NPs (700–800 nm) overlaps with the PL signal of the MAPbI3 perovskite which might enable a surface energy transfer mechanism as the process responsible for non-radiative recombination of the excited charge carriers. A high quenching efficiency has been previously reported for CdTe quantum dots (QDs) with different sizes assembled in close proximity to Au NPs.32 The shift of the PL of the CdTe QDs with different sizes modifies the overlapping with the absorption of the Au NPs but the quenching efficiency was very high in all cases.32

Core–shell Au@SiO2 NPs with a tunable thickness of the optically inert SiO2 shell were synthesized by using the Stöber method to examine the dynamics of the photophysical deactivation process in the MAPbI3 perovskite at a controlled distance to the Au NPs (see further details of the synthesis in the ESI, Fig. S1–S3†).33–35Fig. 2 shows the representative TEM images of the core–shell Au@SiO2 NPs where a clear rise in the SiO2 thickness is observed upon increasing the duration of the Stöber growth. Fig. S6† shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of all core–shell Au@SiO2 NPs in bulk DMF solution where a small red-shift of the maximum of the absorption peak is detected upon increasing the thickness of the SiO2 shell. This shift is ascribed to the modification of the local dielectric environment by the SiO2 shell.36 Fig. S7† shows the UV-vis absorption spectra for thin films of Au@SiO2 NPs deposited using the spray pyrolysis method. A small shift of the absorption maximum to the red side is also observed in the films with a thinner layer of SiO2. With a thicker layer of the SiO2 shell, the absorption spectra are very similar to those in solution. The shift in the absorption signal might be ascribed to the weak plasmon coupling in aggregated Au@SiO2 NPs at lower values of SiO2 thickness. After the characterization of the SiO2 layer, the Au@SiO2 NPs are deposited on a glass substrate via the spray pyrolysis method. Fig. S8† shows the SEM images of layers of Au NPs prepared from three different concentrations of the initial Au NP solution. In all three SEM images, the Au NPs are homogeneously distributed throughout the substrate but upon increasing the concentration of the Au NP solution, the distance between the Au NPs is shorter occupying the wide majority of the area of the substrate. Thus, the separation in the last two samples (most concentrated ones) is on average about 50 nm which is smaller than the charge carrier diffusion length in the MAPbI3 perovskite. Fig. S8† also shows the elemental analysis of Au for the three SEM images revealing the regular distribution of the Au element throughout the substrate.

Once the distance between the Au NPs and the MAPbI3 layers is finely controlled through the SiO2 shell, the changes in the PL intensity of the MAPbI3 perovskite were studied. Photographs of the resulting layers of the Au@SiO2 NP/MAPbI3 composite can be observed in Fig. S4.†Fig. 3 shows the PL spectra of MAPbI3 perovskite films deposited on top of Au@SiO2 NP layers with different SiO2 thicknesses. The PL spectrum of the sample prepared using bare Au NPs exhibits intense quenching with 98% reduction of the PL signal with respect to the reference MAPbI3 film without plasmonic NPs. It is worth noting that no changes in the shape and position of the PL peak were observed. The high quenching efficiency is clear evidence of the strong interaction between the plasmonic NPs and the perovskite film which might be attributed to the electronic recombination at the surface of the Au NPs or energy transfer to the metal NPs. Moreover, the plasmonic near-field of metal NPs may also impact the exciton dissociation by, for example, reducing the exciton binding energy.14 Remarkably, in the samples with the Au@SiO2 NPs, the PL signal is gradually recovered when increasing the thickness of the SiO2 shell with full recovery at ∼43 nm separation between both materials imposed by the SiO2 shell. The long distance at which this non-radiative mechanism still operates, and the clear distance-dependence of the PL quenching is strong evidence for a nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET) process where the dipole–surface interactions are active at longer distances (1–30 nm).37 Since the thickness of the SiO2 layer was tuned to control the distance between the surface of the Au NPs and the perovskite material, the effect of the surface plasmon resonance from the Au NPs is completely neglected after reaching a given value of thickness, indicating no interaction between the Au NPs and the MAPbI3 perovskite. Thus, no field enhancement after a certain SiO2 thickness was found. Additionally, the notable quenching of the PL signal at moderate distances excludes an electron recombination process as the mechanism responsible for the PL quenching. Indeed, the isolating and photoinert layer of SiO2 around the Au NPs hampers the existence of electronic coupling between both active materials.

We have also measured the time constants (τ) related to the decay of the PL signal of the MAPbI3 perovskite. Table S1† includes the average values calculated by using a triexponential function to fit the experimental data. Following the same tendency observed in the steady-state PL spectra, the time constant is significantly shorter in the samples with bare Au NPs with respect to the reference MAPbI3 hybrid perovskite. Moreover, longer time constants are gradually obtained when increasing the thickness of the SiO2 shell in the Au@SiO2 NPs. The radiative and non-radiative rate constants (krad and knrad) for each sample can be calculated using the measured time constants and the PL quantum yield using the following equations: (1) (2)

Fig. 4A displays the obtained values of krad with minor changes throughout all samples while knrad decreases upon growing the thickness of the SiO2 shell. Thus, the impact of the surface plasmon of the Au NPs on the MAPbI3 perovskite is demonstrated to occur through a non-radiative mechanism, as the previously mentioned NSET process.37

The krad and knrad are calculated using eqn (1) and (2). The solid lines in the figure are only a guide to the eye. (B) Experimental data of the quenching efficiency obtained from PL spectra in Fig. 3 (red squares) and fit of the data using the CPS-Kuhn (dark blue) and Förster (light blue) model for Au NPs with a radius of 10 nm (blue line). 
To prove the operation of the NSET mechanism in the non-radiative deactivation of the MAPbI3 perovskite in the presence of the Au@SiO2 NPs, the experimental PL quenching efficiency is modeled by using a theoretical inverse four power distance dependence between the perovskite excitons and the Au NP surface (eqn (3)) as stated in the CPS-Kuhn model.38,39 (3)where d is the separation between the MAPbI3 perovskite and the Au NPs defined by the thickness of the SiO2 shell and d0 is the distance at which the probability of non-radiative quenching of the MAPbI3 perovskite leads to 50% lowering of the PL intensity. The parameters defining the value of d0 are described using CPS-Kuhn theory applied to thin films accounting for the size-dependent electronic properties of the Au NPs (eqn (4)). (4)
The d0 value incorporates the donor (MAPbI3) and acceptor (Au NPs) terms that determine the extension of the energy transfer mechanism: λ is the emission wavelength maximum of the MAPbI3 (775 nm), ΦPL is the PL quantum yield of the MAPbI3 (0.03), A is the absorptivity of the Au NP layers, nr is the refractive index of the metal (0.52), ε2 is the complex dielectric function of the metal, ε1 is the solvent dielectric (air), nm is the index of refraction (air) and α is the orientation of the MAPbI3 to the metal plasmon vector (0.116). The ε2 and A values are calculated according to the CPS-Kuhn model to account for their dependence on the size of the Au NPs.37,40

Fig. 4B shows the fit of the experimental values of the quenching efficiency at different thicknesses of the SiO2 shell using the NSET model. An overall good agreement of the data with the fit is observed although the model underestimates the quenching at a large thickness of the SiO2 shell (40–45 nm). The mismatch of the NSET model at long distances might be attributed to a parallel deactivation mechanism. To assess whether the alternative Förster energy transfer process may operate in the observed PL quenching, the Förster radius (R0) is calculated using eqn (5).32 (5)where κ2 is the orientation factor of the dipoles (2/3 for randomly oriented dipoles), ΦPL is the PL quantum yield of the MAPbI3 (0.03), n is the refractive index of the medium and  is the spectral overlap of the normalized PL of the MAPbI3, IPL(λ), and the Au NP extinction coefficient spectrum, εAu NP(λ). Eqn (3) is also employed to calculate the quenching efficiency but the distance dependence is to the power of 6 instead of 4 of the NSET model. Fig. 4B shows the dependence on SiO2 thickness where an overall poorer fit is obtained compared to the NSET model. This result indicates that the nanometal surface energy transfer is likely the working mechanism to account for the PL quenching observed in the PSCs. However, it is not completely rejected that the Förster energy transfer process may be a minor deactivation process for the quenching of the photoluminescence of the MAPbI3 perovskite. Nevertheless, the surface energy transfer process has been widely investigated as a deactivation mechanism in fluorescence molecules/Au NPs with applications in biophysics of molecular chemistry. The validity of the NSET model for the hybrid perovskites extends the range of operation of this mechanism and open the way for further investigations in this field.
Conclusions
In summary, by constructing a series of core–shell Au@SiO2 NPs with a tunable thickness of the optically inert SiO2 shell, the influence of the plasmonic field on the photophysical properties of MAPbI3 perovskite thin films has been carefully determined. The PL intensity is entirely quenched in the presence of Au NPs but it gradually recovers its initial intensity upon increasing the thickness of the SiO2 shell. The radiative rate constant is calculated to remain invariable for all samples while the non-radiative rate constant decreases at a thicker SiO2 thickness. A nanometal surface energy transfer process is proved to be responsible for the non-radiative PL quenching of the MAPbI3 hybrid perovskite. The enhanced absorption in PSCs due to the light scattering of the Au NPs is a well-established effect that should prevail over the energy transfer reaction to optimize the performance. Our outcomes reveal the importance of the SiO2 shell to prevent the detrimental energy transfer process in PSCs decorated with Au NPs.29
