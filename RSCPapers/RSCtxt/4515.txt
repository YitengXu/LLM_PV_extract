    , Accepted 20th December 2019First published on 7th January 2020AbstractHigh-performance hybrid graphene photodetectors were prepared with endohedral fullerenes deposited on graphene using electrophoretic methods for the first time. Endohedral Sc3N@C80, which acts as an electron acceptor, was used and the ensuing electronic and optoelectronic properties were measured. Another endohedral fullerene, La@C82, was also adsorbed on graphene, which acts as an electron donor. Upon optical illumination, for the Sc3N@C80–graphene hybrid, the photoinduced free holes are injected into graphene, increasing the hole carrier concentration in graphene, while the photoexcited electrons remain in Sc3N@C80; this leads to a high photoresponsivity  of ∼109 A W−1, detectivity D of ∼1015 Jones, and external quantum efficiency EQE ∼ 109 % for the Sc3N@C80–graphene hybrid. This  is ∼10 times higher compared to other reports of quantum dot-graphene and few layer MoS2–graphene heterostructures. Similarly, for the La@C82–graphene hybrid,  ∼ 108 A W−1, D ∼ 1014 Jones, and EQE ∼ 106 % were achieved, with electrons being injected into graphene. The exceptional performance gains achieved with both types of hybrid structures confirms the potential of endohedrals to dope graphene for high performance optoelectronic devices using a facile and scalable fabrication process.
1. Introduction
Graphene, with its excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties, is a material of immense technological importance.1–3 In particular, its extremely high carrier mobility of ∼200000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and potential for ballistic transport4 provide opportunities for high-speed field-effect transistors (FETs),5 compared with silicon-based FETs.6 For its use in light detection, Sun et al.4 demonstrated the first ultrafast graphene photodetector in 2010 with extremely high operational bandwidth that resulted from its outstanding electronic properties and gapless nature. However, the responsivity  of pristine graphene photodetectors is limited to ∼10−3 A W−1 due to its poor light absorption cross-section in active regions, short photon-generated carrier lifetimes which range in the tens of picoseconds, and the absence of a gain mechanism.7 To overcome these challenges and enhance optical absorption, integrating semiconducting light absorbers with graphene is a viable approach for realizing high-performance graphene-based photodetectors, in which the fast exciton recombination is also minimized. Although the improvement in  is substantial, the performance is still not sufficient for light detection at low-intensity illumination (in the pW range), but Roy et al.8 reported a MoS2–graphene hybrid photodetector which yielded  ∼ 108A W−1 at low-intensities, down to the pW regime. After this, reports were published in rapid succession on highly sensitive photodetectors or photo-memory devices produced by hybridizing two-dimensional (2D) materials.9
For nanocarbon-based hybrids, photodetection using combinations of fullerenes (C60)–graphene,10–17 C60–nanoribbons,13 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC)–graphene,18–20 TMDC–C60,14 C60–hexagonal boron nitride,11,21,22 superatomic crystals (C60 and metal chalcogenides crystals),23 fluorographene,24 iron chloride (FeCl3)–graphene25 have been reported. C60 and its derivatives, e.g., [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) have long been employed in solar cells because of their excellent electron-accepting abilities.26 Endohedral fullerenes can be divided into two main groups. The first include compounds that contain atoms of non-metals or simple molecules (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, helium, xenon, etc.). The second group includes endohedral fullerenes which encapsulate metal ions or metal-containing clusters.27,28 The discovery of endohedral cluster fullerenes in 1999 signalled a significant turning point in fullerene research, favoured by the high synthetic yields achieved and the interest in their fundamental chemical and electronic properties.27
For exploring the interactions with graphene, we selected a cluster endohedral fullerene, Sc3N@C80, denoted as END1 here, and monometallic endohedral fullerene, La@C82, denoted as END2 here, based on their electron-accepting and electron-donating abilities, respectively.28 The END1 is very stable under ambient conditions and can be produced in high yields.29–31 Similar to C60, END1 has also been used as an electron-acceptor in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to enhance power conversion efficiencies.32–34 Recently, Xu et al.35 reported the first successful and facile preparation of micron-sized hexagonal single crystalline END1 rods using the liquid–liquid interfacial precipitation (LLIP) method for photo-electrochemical applications, which clearly demonstrates its efficient charge carrier transport properties and confirms its potential for photoelectric conversion.
The END2 in this work is also produced by the carbon arc method but the yield is far lower.36 END2 features a large anionic π surface and an open-shell structure. Importantly, in comparison to the C60 absorption spectrum with peaks between the ∼400–700 nm range37 and the END1 absorption spectrum between ∼450–680 nm,38 the broad absorption of END2 from ∼600–1100 nm clearly highlights its enhanced optical absorption well into the infra-red regime.39 While bonding and dynamics of metal atoms inside the endohedral cages have been examined in the past, END2 has received comparatively little attention owing largely to its lower production yields.40,41
Despite the potential advantage of endohedrals in OPV, their integration in graphene-based devices remains essentially unexplored. Herein, for the first time, we report the combination of zero-dimensional (0D) END1 and END2 with 2D graphene to yield hybrid systems, where charge transfer processes result in the emergence of interesting optoelectronic properties. The Raman shift in the G- and 2D-modes of the hybrids relative to bare graphene, confirms that hole-doping is occurring in graphene with END1, while electron-doping occurs with END2. From our analysis we conclude that charge transfer and consequent photocurrent Iph generation contribute to a high  of ∼109 A W−1 and ∼108 A W−1 in the END1–graphene and END2–graphene, respectively, over wavelengths λ of 400 to 1100 nm. The  for END1–graphene reported in this work is ∼10 times higher compared to the MoS2–graphene heterostructure photodetectors with  ∼ 108 A W−1 reported previously.8
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Graphene–Sc3N@C80 hybrid
The electrophoretic deposition technique was used to deposit ∼1 mg mL−1 END1 in ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) on top of the graphene membrane and the device was vacuum annealed for ∼24 hours at ∼180 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). Insights into the structural morphology of END1 agglomerated on top of the graphene membrane was obtained using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The influence of annealing on the optical characteristics of the device has not been evaluated presently, but will be interesting to pursue for a future study. The bare graphene thickness was ∼24 nm measured using AFM indicating the presence of multi-layer graphene (MLG), as shown by the height profile scan in the inset of Fig. S2(e)–(i) (ESI†). Fig. S2(f)(i) and (ii) (ESI†) illustrate the clusters of bare END1 in the form of islands exhibiting a peak height of ∼3.6 nm and diameter ∼50 nm. On the other hand, Fig. S2(g)(i)–(ii) (ESI†) reveals clustering of END1 on the graphene surface with a peak height of ∼9–20 nm and cluster diameter ∼200–350 nm.
The bare END1, bare graphene, and END1–graphene hybrid assemblies were further characterized using Raman spectroscopy, as well as temperature T dependent Raman, which is a non-invasive characterization technique used for inferring the structural and electronic properties of materials.42Fig. 1(a) shows the Raman spectra of END1–graphene hybrid at room T which is compared to bare graphene, while the inset shows the Raman spectra of the bare END1 with a central peak at 1203 cm−1 and a relative normalized peak intensity IEND1 ∼ 1 a.u. This peak is blue-shifted Δω(+) by ∼50 cm−1 for the END1–graphene Raman hybrid (with relative normalized peak intensity for IEND1 ∼ 0.4 a.u., as shown) and is attributed to the van der Waals interaction between END1 and the graphene membrane.30Fig. 1(b) and (c) show the magnified G- and 2D-bands of END1–graphene relative to bare graphene, respectively, at room T. The Δω(+) shift for the G-band and 2D-band were measured to be ∼5 cm−1 and ∼10 cm−1, respectively. The Δω(+) shift for the G- and the 2D-band for END1–graphene observed here is similar to the Δω(+) shift for the G- and the 2D-band for C60–graphene hybrids reported by Jnawali et al.10 The Δω(+) shift is attributed to C60 causing p-type doping in graphene that has been confirmed using THz-time domain spectroscopy.10 Thus, from the Δω(+) shift for the G-band and 2D-band of END1–graphene, it can be inferred that END1 also induces p-doping in graphene. This assertion is in alignment with the oxidation potential of END1 which is ∼0.59 mV, measured using cyclic voltammetry, implying that END1 is a p-type dopant.39 Besides using Raman Spectroscopy to deduce doping effects, three terminal devices with back gating can also allow for the verification of doping on a future study.
 Fig. 1  (a) Raman spectra of END1–graphene hybrid and bare graphene at room T. Inset shows the Raman spectra of the bare END1 film. The peak at ∼1203 cm−1 in the inset is the tangential mode of END1 with a relative normalized peak intensity IEND1 ∼ 1 a.u. This peak is blue-shifted Δω(+) by ∼50 cm−1 in the END1–graphene Raman spectra, as shown (with relative normalized peak intensity for IEND1 ∼ 0.4 a.u.) and is attributed to the van der Waals interaction between the END1 and the graphene membrane. The mechanically exfoliated graphene membranes show an intense tangential mode G-band at ∼1580 cm−1 and a 2D-band at ∼2714 cm−1. (b) and (c) are the magnified G- and 2D-band peaks, respectively, for graphene and END1–graphene. The G-peak of graphene experiences a Δω(+) shift of ∼5 cm−1 and for the 2D-peak the Δω(+) shift is ∼10 cm−1 which is due to the p-type doping induced in graphene by END1. (d) Variation of the G- and 2D-band with T in the END1–graphene hybrid (top) and bare graphene (bottom). Its clear that a red-shift Δω[T](−) is seen in both cases for the G- and 2D-bands as T increases. (e) Linear fit (dotted red lines) showing the extracted χG for the G-band, and (f) χ2D for the 2D-band in END1–graphene. Insets in (e) and (f) show the respective values for bare graphene. In this case χG < χ2D (∼0.01818 cm−1 K−1 ≲ 0.02366 cm−1 K−1 for bare graphene and ∼0.0124 cm−1 K−1 ≲ 0.0241 cm−1 K−1 for END1–graphene). 
The T-dependent Raman spectra of graphene and of the END1–graphene hybrid were measured from T ∼ 298 K to ∼873 K and the data are plotted in Fig. 1(d). The G-band peak position experienced a red shift with temperature, where a Δω[T](−) shift of ∼14 cm−1 (∼1580 cm−1 at T ∼ 298 K to ∼1566 cm−1 at T ∼ 873 K) for bare graphene (bottom plot of Fig. 1(d)) was observed as T increased from ∼298 K to ∼873 K. A similar Δω[T](−) shift of ∼23 cm−1 (∼1586 cm−1 at T ∼ 298 K to ∼1563 cm−1 at T ∼ 873 K) was also observed for the END1–graphene hybrid (top plot of Fig. 1(d)) as T increases. The G-band shift towards lower frequencies is attributed to optical phonon softening as T increases given that the G-band is intimately associated with optical phonons which are very sensitive to carrier density.43 Similarly, the 2D-band peak experiences a Δω[T](−) shift of ∼14 cm−1 for bare graphene (∼2701 cm−1 at T ∼ 298 K to ∼2683 cm−1 at T ∼ 873 K) (bottom of Fig. 1(d)), and the END1–graphene hybrid also underwent a Δω[T](−) shift of ∼16 cm−1 (∼2714 cm−1 at T ∼ 298 K to ∼2698 cm−1 at T ∼ 873 K) (top plot of Fig. 1(d)). Incidentally, the 2D-band is sensitive to changes in the electronic band structure such as that arising from strain, which in this case would imply temperature-induced strain changes for the bare graphene and for the END1–graphene hybrid.44
The Raman shifts of the G-band and 2D-band as a function T were further analysed by extracting the fitting parameters when the data are fit to ω = ω0 + χT; here ω0 is the extrapolated peak position at 0 K, and χ is the first-order T-coefficient. From the linear fit for the G-band and the 2D-band for END1–graphene shown in Fig. 1(e) and (f), respectively, the first-order T coefficients for bare graphene were calculated to be χG ∼ 0.01818 cm−1 K−1 and χ2D ∼ 0.02366 cm−1 K−1 (insets in Fig. 1(e) and (f)). Equivalently, the T-coefficients for the END1–graphene hybrid were χG ∼ 0.0124 cm−1 K−1 and χ2D ∼ 0.0241 cm−1 K−1. In our case χG < χ2D (∼0.01818 cm−1 K−1 ≲ 0.02366 cm−1 K−1 for graphene, and ∼0.0124 cm−1 K−1 ≲ 0.0241 cm−1 K−1 for END1–graphene) which is consistent with a previous report by Tian et al.43 who determined χG ∼ 0.01496 cm−1 K−1 < χ2D ∼ 0.02484 cm−1 K−1 for graphene, and explained this result on the basis of the “self-energy” contribution from the G-band.
The I–V measurements of the END1–graphene hybrid were conducted in a vacuum probe stage at a pressure of ∼10−6Torr, where T was controlled from ∼5.8K to 298K using a closed-cycle He refrigerator and the results were compared to those of bare END1 and bare graphene, as shown in Fig. 2(a). At T ∼ 298 K, the transport current I is ∼20 times higher for END1–graphene relative to bare graphene and bare END1, as the data in Fig. 2(a) reveal. In Fig. 2(b), the I increased from ∼12 mA at T ∼ 5.8 K to ∼24 mA at T ∼ 298 K for V ∼ 1 V for the END1–graphene hybrid, while in Fig. 2(c), the I increases from ∼0.38 mA at T ∼ 5.8 K to ∼0.8 mA at T ∼ 298 K for bare graphene at V ∼ 1 V. Similarly, in the inset of Fig. 2(c) for bare END1, I increases from ∼0.5 mA at T ∼ 5.8 K to ∼2.1 mA at T ∼ 298 K. These data clearly show that the device resistance R for the bare END1, bare graphene, and END1–graphene hybrid decreases as T increases and that the adsorption of END1 results in modulation of the electronic transport in graphene. The dependence of R with T is further delineated by the data in Fig. 2(d), where the inset shows the R–T Characteristic of bare graphene, bare END1 and the END1–graphene hybrid. An inverse correlation of R with T is evident for all three cases, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(d) with some nonlinearities present. Defects in bare graphene may be responsible for the inverse T-dependence of R which has been previously reported,45 and in the case of END1–graphene may also arise from the p-type doping induced.46 Additionally, for bare END1 as T increases, the charge carriers in END1 have a higher likelihood of overcoming the potential barrier and thus decreasing R.33 Liu et al.47 used the Efros–Shklovskii model to calculate the activation energy Ea of few-layer graphene interconnects, but the fit encompassed significant uncertainty for T from ∼5–340 K. Therefore, in our analysis we consider two distinct regions shown in Fig. 2(d) from T ∼ 65–298 K (Region I), and from T ∼ 5.8–60 K (Region II), where the data are fit to the Arrhenius model48 denoted by eqn (1) below, (1)Here R(T) is the resistance at T, R0 is the resistance at T = ∞ and is referred to as the pre-exponent, Ea is the thermal activation energy, and k is the Boltzmann constant. Eqn (1) is rewritten as, (2)where a linear relationship is expected between the ln[R(T)] versus T plot. As noted, two regions were used to plot ln[R(T)] as a function of 1000/T, shown in Fig. 2(d) where Ea is deduced from the slope of this fit. Table 1 summarizes the Ea values tabulated for Region I (∼65–298 K) and Region II (∼5.8–60 K), along with the r2 values where r is the correlation coefficient, for bare graphene, bare END1, and the END1–graphene hybrid. For Region I, Ea was tabulated to be ∼0.73 meV for bare graphene, ∼0.54 meV for bare END1, and ∼0.43 meV for END1–graphene. Similarly, for Region II, Ea ∼ 0.94 meV for bare graphene, ∼0.76 meV for bare END1, and ∼0.61 meV for END1–graphene were determined. We believe the physical origin of the different activation energies comes from two mechanisms that maybe operative. The first is likely due to a thermally activated hopping mechanism related to defects in the underlying graphene, which is dominant at the lower temperatures (Region II) with the larger activation energies. The defects in the underlying graphene in our END1–Graphene hybrid are likely to contribute to Region II's larger activation energy, and hence larger resistance, where dopants maybe largely frozen out. In the higher temperature regime (Region I), the dopants have a higher likelihood for getting activated due to increased thermal energies which would result in an increase in charge carrier density, conductivity, reduced resistance and hence lower activation energy, as noted in Table 1 by the activation energy values we have tabulated. The Ea values for the hybrid structures are lower by ∼41% and ∼35% for both Region I and Region II, respectively, when compared to bare graphene. This reduction in Ea is consistent with the p-type doping induced in graphene as a result of interactions with END1, and is also inferred from the Δω[T](−) shift of the Raman spectrum (Fig. 1(a)).

The END1–graphene and bare END1 devices were exposed to a white light source to initiate the optoelectronic transport measurements of these devices under vacuum. The Iph was extracted from the measurements done in the dark (i.e. Idark) and in the presence of light (i.e. Ilight) where Iph = Ilight − Idark. Under illumination, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the Ilight values were ∼10 times higher for the hybrid (∼25.15 mA at 0.5 V) compared to the bare END1 (inset) where Ilight ∼ 2.5 mA at 0.5 V at room T. We note here that our devices are based on a two-terminal device architecture where the photoconductive mechanism (no gate voltage applied) is operative, unlike in prior work8,12,24,49–51 that relied on an external gate voltage applied, based on a three-terminal device architecture. Fig. 3(b) shows the time-dependent Iph measurements of bare END1, bare graphene, and the END1–graphene hybrid at ∼1 V (where Ilight ∼ 26.43 mA and Idark ∼ 25.20 mA for END1–graphene, and Ilight ∼ 2.82 mA and Idark ∼ 2.07 mA for END1). The cycles in yellow refer to the ON-state of the light pulses, while the OFF-cycles (no color) represent the absence of light. A photoresponse was not detectable in our bare graphene device, as the Iph was below the pico-amp range (secondary y-axis). As reported earlier, in graphene, a short photon-generated carrier lifetime persists on the scale of picoseconds, and the ON/OFF ratio is also quite poor.8Fig. 3(c) shows the response of the photocurrent over a single ON-pulse, where the rise time τr and decay time τd for bare END1 and END1–graphene are measured. The τr and τd are among the figures of merit that are important to gauge the photodetector response. The τr is measured from ∼10% of the noise floor and ∼90% of the peak signal value. Similarly, τd was computed from ∼90% to 10% of the maximum and minimum signal intensities, respectively.52 These values were τr ∼ 1.8 ms and τd ∼ 2.7 ms for the END1–graphene hybrid, and for bare END1, τr ∼ 2.6 ms and τd ∼ 3.1 ms. The response time for our END1–graphene hybrid is significantly lower compared to PbS QDs–graphene hybrids (τr ∼ 10 ms and τd ∼ 20 ms)49 and Bi2Te3–graphene hybrids (τr ∼ 8.7 ms)51 as photodetectors reported previously.
 Fig. 3  (a) The I–V response of END1–graphene and bare END1 (inset) in the dark and illuminated states where a white light source was used for illumination in vacuum at room T. (b) The Iph was extracted from the measurements done in the absence and presence of light over multiple ON (yellow) and OFF (no color) cycles (where, Ilight ∼ 26.43 mA and Idark ∼ 25.20 mA for END1–graphene, and Ilight ∼ 2.82 mA and Idark ∼ 2.07 mA for END1) at ∼ 1 V. The bare graphene device yields a nondiscernable photoresponse, as shown by the secondary y-axis. (c) A magnified single ON-cycle pulse, where the τr and τd were calculated. Left and right insets list the values of τr and τd for bare END1 and END1–graphene, respectively. (d) Schematic representation of the band diagram for graphene and END1 at equilibrium (top) and under illumination (bottom) illustrating the hole transfer from END1 to graphene. The EF of graphene experiences a downward shift by ∼119 meV. 
The  for END1–graphene and bare END1 was calculated using , where P is the incoming power, and the values were determined to be ∼4 × 109 A W−1 and 2 × 108 A W−1 at ∼1 V and P ∼ 3.3 pW at room T, respectively, with an incoming light power density (calibrated using the Thorlabs optical power meter PM100D) ∼3 mW cm−2. Fig. 3(d) shows the band diagram illustrating the charge transport between the END1–graphene interface at equilibrium (top of Fig. 3(d)) and upon illumination (bottom of Fig. 3(d)). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (LUMO) of END1 is ∼−4.6 eV, while the HOMO level is ∼−5.7 eV.53 Upon illumination, the incident photons excite ground-state electrons of END1 into excited states. Electron–hole pairs are then formed at the END1–graphene interface and photogenerated holes are efficiently injected into the graphene; thus, END1 is a p-type dopant with graphene which is also consistent with the high oxidation potential of END1 ∼ 0.59 mV.39 This leads to an increase in the hole carrier density as the hole population in graphene increases,10 as shown schematically in Fig. 3(d). The injection of holes leads to the downward shift in EF in graphene,54 and to electron injection into END1, where charge neutrality is maintained in the hybrid. Flores et al. reported that hole-doping in exfoliated graphene using various process treatments shifts EF, and EF and carrier concentration (N) at room T are determined from the shift in the Raman peak positions using eqn (3) and (4) below,55 (3) (4)Position (G-band) refers to the peak position of the G-band which occurs at 1585 cm−1 for the hybrid (from Fig. 1(b)), νF = 1.09 × 106 m s−1 is the Fermi velocity and ℏ is the modified Planck's constant (i.e. ℏ = h/2π, where h = 6.626 × 10−34 J s). From our Raman data in Fig. 1(b), we calculated a value for EF ∼ 119 meV and accordingly N ∼ 8.5 × 1011 cm−2 at ∼298 K. The results are also consistent with the observed Δω(+) shift for the G-band in Fig. 1(b), which is attributed to hole-doping in graphene, and in turn induces the downward shift in EF in graphene.56
To further explore the photodetector response, a tunable laser source, the Fianium LLFT Contrast (NKT Photonics), was used for optical excitation, and wavelength λ was increased in ∼100nm increments from 400–1100 nm. Fig. 4(a)–(d) show the comparative evaluation of Iph, , detectivity D, and external quantum efficiency EQE of the END1–graphene hybrid and bare END1 (insets) as a function of λ over T ranging from ∼5.8 K to 298 K. The Iph and  for END1–graphene hybrids were found to be ∼0.6 mA and just below ∼5 × 109 A W−1 at λ ∼ 400 nm, while the bare END1 devices (insets of Fig. 4(a) and (b)) show an Iph ∼ 0.12 mA and  ∼ 2 × 108 A W−1, respectively. A decrease in both parameters is seen for λ ≳ 850 nm over the temperatures tested. Moreover, D and EQE in Fig. 4(c) and (d) were calculated using , where Idark = 25.2 mA, A = 708.46 μm2 and , where e = 1.6 × 10−19 C is the electronic charge. The D and EQE of END1–graphene hybrids were calculated to be ∼9.6 × 1015 Jones and ∼109 % at T ∼ 298 K, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d), respectively. The D and EQE of the bare END1 (insets of Fig. 4(c) and (d)) were measured to be ∼1012 Jones and ∼106 % at T ∼ 298 K at λ ∼ 400 nm. Again, both parameters decrease for λ ≳ 850 nm over the temperatures tested. It is notable that END1 and END1–graphene show an increase in photoresponse for hν ≳ 1.64 eV (i.e. λ ≤ 850 nm), which demonstrates that the photoinduced carriers are only generated for λ below this value, where the carriers have sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier. The values of Iph, , D, and EQE are indeed enhanced significantly through the interaction of END1 with graphene compared to the bare END1 system. Additionally, the D and EQE are comparable to the previously reported values for graphene-perovskite (MAPbI3) devices (D ∼ 1015 Jones and EQE ∼ 108 %).50
 Fig. 4  (a)–(d) Comparative analysis of the T-dependent Iph, , D, and EQE of END1–graphene, and bare END1 (insets) from λ ∼ 400–1100 nm at various T. (a) For λ ∼ 400 nm, the device shows high Iph (∼ 0.6 mA) and (b) high  (approaching 5 × 109 A W−1) for END1–graphene at T ∼ 298 K and Iph and  start to decrease for λ ≳ 850 nm. This decrease is due to the fact that an efficient photoconductance appears in the END1 film at hν ≳ 1.64 eV (i.e. λ ≳ 850 nm). The (c) D and (d) EQE of END1–graphene hybrids were calculated to be ∼9.6 × 1015 Jones and ∼109 % at ∼298 K at λ ∼ 400 nm, respectively. A similar trend was observed for the bare END1 (insets of (a)-(d)) from λ ∼ 400–800 nm. At λ ∼ 400 nm, the Iph and  for bare END1 were ∼0.12 mA and ∼2 × 108 A W−1, and D and EQE for END1 were ∼2.8 × 1012 Jones and ∼106 % at T ∼ 298 K. 
2.2 Graphene–La@C82 hybrid
To delve further into the graphene–endohedral hybrid interaction, we conducted experiments with another endohedral fullerene, La@C82 denoted as END2 here, that was deposited on top of the graphene. The same methodology was used to deposit END2, as discussed in Section 2.1 for END1. Before the preparation of the END2–graphene hybrid devices, initial measurements were conducted on the bare END2 as shown by the electrophoretic deposition data depicted for END2 in Fig. S3, ESI† and to also measure the intrinsic conductance of these endohedrals. Further, AFM was used to determine the agglomeration of END2 on top of the graphene membrane (Fig. S4, ESI†). The bare graphene thickness was ∼12.8 nm measured using AFM indicating MLG. The cluster arrangement for END2 on graphene is seen in Fig. S4(b)(i) and (ii) (ESI†).
The END2–graphene hybrid was further characterized using Raman Spectroscopy, where Fig. 5(a) shows the Raman spectra of the END2–graphene hybrid and the bare graphene at room T; the inset in Fig. 5(a) shows the Raman spectra of the bare END2 film. The peaks at ∼672 cm−1, ∼692 cm−1, ∼753 cm−1, and ∼792 cm−1 in the inset represent the intrinsic internal vibrational modes of END2.39 The G-peak of graphene experiences a Δω(−) shift of ∼6 cm−1 (from ∼1580 cm−1 to ∼1574 cm−1) as shown in the magnified plot of Fig. 5(b), while the 2D-peak undergoes a Δω(−) shift of ∼12 cm−1 (from ∼2704 cm−1 to ∼2692 cm−1) illustrated in Fig. 5(c). In the END2–graphene hybrid, a peak at ∼789 cm−1 (with relative normalized peak intensity for IEND2 ∼ 0.04 a.u.) is seen, which for the bare END2 film occurs at 792 cm−1. This shift arises from the van der Waals interaction between END2 and graphene. The La atom has three valence electrons in its outermost shell and has a strong tendency to donate electrons.40 Also, from the Raman red shift of Δω(−) for the G- and the 2D-band, we infer that END2 induces n-type doping in graphene, which is in alignment with the oxidation potential for END2 that is discussed in more detail below.
 Fig. 5  (a) Raman spectra of END2–graphene and bare graphene. Inset shows the Raman spectrum for the bare END2 film. The peaks at ∼672, 692, 753, and 792 cm−1 represent the internal vibrational modes of END2. In the END2–graphene hybrid, the main 792 cm−1 peak for END2 shifts to ∼789 cm−1 and is attributed to the van der Waals interaction between END2 and graphene. (b) The G-band of graphene experiences a Δω(−) shift of ∼6 cm−1 and (c) the 2D-band red-shifts by ∼12 cm−1. From the Δω(−) shift for the G- and the 2D-band it can be inferred that END2 induces n-type doping in graphene. (d) The I–V Characteristics of the END2–graphene hybrid, bare END2, and bare graphene where transport is enhanced for the END2–graphene hybrid device. (e) The I–V of the END2–graphene hybrid and bare END2 (inset) in the dark and illuminated states for a white light source at room T. (f) Pulsed ON (yellow) and OFF (no color) cycles showing the photoresponse for the three cases at 1 V bias (where, Ilight ∼ 16.15 mA and Idark ∼ 15.80 mA for END2–graphene, and Ilight ∼ 0.61 mA and Idark ∼ 0.38 mA for END2). (g) A magnified single ON-cycle pulse, where the τr and τd were calculated. Left and right insets show the values of τr and τd for bare END2 and END2–graphene hybrid, respectively. (h) Schematic representation of the energy band diagram for graphene and END2 at equilibrium (top), and under illumination (bottom) illustrating the electron transfer from END2 to graphene, inducing the n-type character in graphene. 
Electrical measurements of the END2–graphene hybrid were compared to bare graphene and bare END2 at room T, as shown in Fig. 5(d). The Idark values were twice as high for the END2–graphene hybrid relative to bare END2. The hybrid also shows enhancement in optoelectronic transport properties when illuminated with a white light source as shown by the data in Fig. 5(e). The time-dependent Iph of the END2–graphene hybrid was also measured as shown in Fig. 5(f) for 1 V bias, and the results were compared with bare graphene and the bare END2. The END2–graphene hybrid exhibited the highest Iph, while a negligible photoresponse resulted from the bare graphene device (secondary axis of Fig. 5(f)); here Ilight ∼ 16.15 mA and Idark ∼ 15.80 mA for END2–graphene at 1 V, and Ilight ∼ 0.61 mA and Idark ∼ 0.38 mA for END2 at ∼1 V. Also, τr and τd of END2–graphene were measured in a similar fashion as for END1, where τr ∼ 2.9 ms and τd ∼ 3.2 ms for the END2–graphene hybrid, and τr ∼ 3.4 ms and τd ∼ 4.5 ms for bare END2, as illustrated in Fig. 5(g). The  values of the END2–graphene hybrid and bare END2 were measured to be ∼2.8 × 108 A W−1 and ∼6 × 107 A W−1, respectively, at room T. The band diagram was also postulated to explain the behaviour of the hybrid at equilibrium and under illumination, as shown schematically in Fig. 5(h) at equilibrium (top) and under illumination (bottom). Upon illumination, light is absorbed by END2 and photo-generated carriers are created. Since a La atom has three valence electrons present in its shell and donates its electrons to the carbon cage, the LUMO level of END2 is lowered to ∼−3.9 eV compared to END1.57 Thus, due to the electron-donating nature of La, n-type doping of graphene is observed.58 Moreover, the oxidation potential of END2 is found to be ∼0.07 mV,40 and given its low value, this again implies that END2 is a relatively good electron-donor, which is also consistent with the Raman shift (red-shifted) observed in Fig. 5(b) and (c) for n-type doping in graphene. Doping effects can also be verified through back gating measurements on a future study. Since La@C82 induces n-doping in graphene, eqn (3) (applied for p-type doping in graphene)55 is not applicable in order to calculate the magnitude of the EF shift.
Similar to the measurements conducted using END1, the END2–graphene hybrid device was further exposed to a wide range of λ's from ∼400–1100 nm using a tunable laser source, as shown by the data for Iph, , D, and EQE, in Fig. 6(a)–(d), respectively. The Iph, in Fig. 6(a) was indeed higher for the END2–graphene hybrid device compared to bare END2, and an  of ∼108 A W−1 was measured for the END2–graphene hybrid compared to ∼107 A W−1 for bare END2, as shown in Fig. 6(b). What is distinctly clear from the data in Fig. 6 is the broad absorption occurring for the END2–graphene hybrid over the entire ∼400–1100 spectral range, which is in contrast to the data obtained for the END1–graphene hybrid, where absorption decreased for λ ≳ 850 nm. This is due to the fact that END2 shows broad absorption bands over the entire visible and near-IR regions, which was another unique reason for us to study the dynamics of this particular endohedral with graphene in a device platform.59

The devices were photo responsive with  ∼ 108 A W−1 for the END2–graphene hybrid and ∼107 A W−1 for END2. The promising broadband optical absorption response with END2 is attributed to the fact that END2 shows broad absorption bands over the entire visible and near-IR regime. From the data in (c) and (d), the D and EQE of the hybrid device was found to be ∼1014 Jones and ∼106 %, respectively. 
The D and EQE of the END2–graphene hybrid device were calculated to be ∼1014 Jones and ∼106 %, respectively. We have compared our results with other graphene-based hybrid materials,8,49–51 as shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d), and summarized in Table 2. It should be noted that the best  ∼ 109 A W−1 reported here for END1–graphene fabricated in this study is ∼10 times higher compared to previous MoS2–graphene based photodetector8 where an  ∼ 108 A W−1 was reported for λ ∼ 400–1100 nm. Our work clearly sets the stage for opening up avenues for a new class of endohedral-fullerene doped 2D–graphene hybrids to enable high performance optoelectronic devices in the future.

From the figures of merit, it is clear that the results reported here show the END1 and END2 graphene based hybrids enable exceptional performance improvements when compared to the prior literature.

3. Conclusion
In summary, in this work photodetectors based on graphene–endohedral fullerenes were fabricated and characterized. From the Raman spectra analyses, confirmation of charge transfer processes occurring between the endohedral fullerenes and graphene is evident. The Δω(+) shift for the case of the END1–graphene hybrid and Δω(−) shift in the END2–graphene hybrid confirms that graphene acts as an electron donor in the former case, and as an electron acceptor in the latter case. Both END1–graphene and END2–graphene hybrid devices display a strong photoresponse under optical illumination. The photoinduced free holes (or electrons) are injected into graphene with END1 (or END2) which leads to high  and D for the hybrids. The , D, and EQE of the END1–graphene hybrid reached values exceeding ∼109 A W−1, ∼1015 Jones, and ∼109 %, respectively. Similarly, the END2–graphene hybrid exhibited values for , D, and EQE of ∼108 A W−1, ∼1014 Jones, and ∼106 %, respectively. Moreover, the optoelectronic response of the END2–graphene hybrids showed a broadband response well into the IR up to 1100 nm, unlike the END1–graphene hybrids where the photoresponse decreased for λ ≳ 850 nm. To the best of our knowledge, our results represent the first approach towards the fabrication of an endohedral fullerene–graphene-based photodetectors, which does not require a complicated fabrication process and yields the highest reported values for photodetector device figures of merit. The excellent performance of our endohedral-fullerene graphene hybrid photodetectors is exceptional and is bound to pave the way for a new class of hybrid 0D–2D graphene-based photonic devices in the future for imaging, surveillance and defense-related applications.
4. Methods
4.1 Materials
A 10 × 10 × 1 mm HOPG crystal from SPI Supplies Grade SPI-1 was mechanically exfoliated on top of a SiO2/Si substrate using residue-free blue tac tape from Semiconductor Corp resulting in a few layer graphene (FLG) membrane. The procedure for exfoliation adopted was similar to that described by Saenz et al.60 A suspension of endohedral END1 (Sc3N@C80) (LUNA LnW-0920, END1 Trinetasphere, ≳95%) at different concentrations in ∼1 mL of o-DCB was electrophoretically deposited on the graphene membrane. Endohedral END2 (La@C82) was prepared using a Krätschmer–Huffman arc discharge generator and purified using HPLC after extracting the soot with toluene as previously described.28,59
4.2 Characterization
Optical absorption spectroscopy was conducted using a CARY 5000 spectrophotometer in quartz cuvettes with ∼0.3 mL volumetric capacity. The SEM imaging was carried out with a Hitachi S-4800. For AFM, the images were acquired using a Veeco Microscope at ambient air conditions (relative humidity ∼30%) with k ∼ 0.3 N m−1 for the silicon tip (provided by Ted Pella Inc.) in contact mode. The Raman data was gathered using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution, where the excitation λ used was ∼532 nm.
4.3 Device fabrication and measurements
The devices were fabricated using a photolithography process for metal contact patterning on a ∼270 nm SiO2/Si substrate. The electrodes were patterned on a graphene membrane using a Karl Suss MJB3 mask aligner.60 Then, ∼10 nm of Ti and ∼100 nm of Au were deposited using an e-beam evaporator, followed by metal lift-off. The electronic and optoelectronic device characterization was conducted using a Lakeshore CRX-4K cryogenic probe stage with T control from ∼5.8 K to 298 K and a low noise semiconductor parameter analyzer, the Keysight B1500A was used for the low-noise electronic transport measurements. The photoresponse was measured at room T by illuminating the device with a broadband light source (LEDR/4 type illuminator) which has a color T of ∼6500 K. The tunable spectral measurements from T ∼ 5.8 K to ∼298 K were conducted using a tunable laser source, the Fianium LLFT Contrast from NKT Photonics. Both the broadband and narrow-band sources were calibrated using the Thorlabs optical power meter PM100D.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Raman spectra of END1–graphene hybrid and bare graphene at room T. Inset shows the Raman spectra of the bare END1 film. The peak at ∼1203 cm−1 in the inset is the tangential mode of END1 with a relative normalized peak intensity IEND1 ∼ 1 a.u. This peak is blue-shifted Δω(+) by ∼50 cm−1 in the END1–graphene Raman spectra, as shown (with relative normalized peak intensity for IEND1 ∼ 0.4 a.u.) and is attributed to the van der Waals interaction between the END1 and the graphene membrane. The mechanically exfoliated graphene membranes show an intense tangential mode G-band at ∼1580 cm−1 and a 2D-band at ∼2714 cm−1. (b) and (c) are the magnified G- and 2D-band peaks, respectively, for graphene and END1–graphene. The G-peak of graphene experiences a Δω(+) shift of ∼5 cm−1 and for the 2D-peak the Δω(+) shift is ∼10 cm−1 which is due to the p-type doping induced in graphene by END1. (d) Variation of the G- and 2D-band with T in the END1–graphene hybrid (top) and bare graphene (bottom). Its clear that a red-shift Δω[T](−) is seen in both cases for the G- and 2D-bands as T increases. (e) Linear fit (dotted red lines) showing the extracted χG for the G-band, and (f) χ2D for the 2D-band in END1–graphene. Insets in (e) and (f) show the respective values for bare graphene. In this case χG < χ2D (∼0.01818 cm−1 K−1 ≲ 0.02366 cm−1 K−1 for bare graphene and ∼0.0124 cm−1 K−1 ≲ 0.0241 cm−1 K−1 for END1–graphene).

 	Fig. 2  The I–V of (a) END1–graphene, bare END1, and bare graphene at T ∼ 298 K. The I–V of (b) END1–graphene, (c) bare graphene, and END1 (inset) over various temperatures. (d) Logarithmic plot of ln[R(T)] as a function of 1000/T. Two regions were used to plot ln[R(T)] as a function of 1000/T, namely Region I (65–298 K) and Region II (5.8–60 K), showing the linear fit of the data (solid red lines). The inset shows a non-linear R versus T plot for bare graphene, bare END1, and END1–graphene. The Ea values were extracted from this fit and the results are summarized in Table 2.

 	Fig. 3  (a) The I–V response of END1–graphene and bare END1 (inset) in the dark and illuminated states where a white light source was used for illumination in vacuum at room T. (b) The Iph was extracted from the measurements done in the absence and presence of light over multiple ON (yellow) and OFF (no color) cycles (where, Ilight ∼ 26.43 mA and Idark ∼ 25.20 mA for END1–graphene, and Ilight ∼ 2.82 mA and Idark ∼ 2.07 mA for END1) at ∼ 1 V. The bare graphene device yields a nondiscernable photoresponse, as shown by the secondary y-axis. (c) A magnified single ON-cycle pulse, where the τr and τd were calculated. Left and right insets list the values of τr and τd for bare END1 and END1–graphene, respectively. (d) Schematic representation of the band diagram for graphene and END1 at equilibrium (top) and under illumination (bottom) illustrating the hole transfer from END1 to graphene. The EF of graphene experiences a downward shift by ∼119 meV.

 	Fig. 4  (a)–(d) Comparative analysis of the T-dependent Iph, , D, and EQE of END1–graphene, and bare END1 (insets) from λ ∼ 400–1100 nm at various T. (a) For λ ∼ 400 nm, the device shows high Iph (∼ 0.6 mA) and (b) high  (approaching 5 × 109 A W−1) for END1–graphene at T ∼ 298 K and Iph and  start to decrease for λ ≳ 850 nm. This decrease is due to the fact that an efficient photoconductance appears in the END1 film at hν ≳ 1.64 eV (i.e. λ ≳ 850 nm). The (c) D and (d) EQE of END1–graphene hybrids were calculated to be ∼9.6 × 1015 Jones and ∼109 % at ∼298 K at λ ∼ 400 nm, respectively. A similar trend was observed for the bare END1 (insets of (a)-(d)) from λ ∼ 400–800 nm. At λ ∼ 400 nm, the Iph and  for bare END1 were ∼0.12 mA and ∼2 × 108 A W−1, and D and EQE for END1 were ∼2.8 × 1012 Jones and ∼106 % at T ∼ 298 K.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Raman spectra of END2–graphene and bare graphene. Inset shows the Raman spectrum for the bare END2 film. The peaks at ∼672, 692, 753, and 792 cm−1 represent the internal vibrational modes of END2. In the END2–graphene hybrid, the main 792 cm−1 peak for END2 shifts to ∼789 cm−1 and is attributed to the van der Waals interaction between END2 and graphene. (b) The G-band of graphene experiences a Δω(−) shift of ∼6 cm−1 and (c) the 2D-band red-shifts by ∼12 cm−1. From the Δω(−) shift for the G- and the 2D-band it can be inferred that END2 induces n-type doping in graphene. (d) The I–V Characteristics of the END2–graphene hybrid, bare END2, and bare graphene where transport is enhanced for the END2–graphene hybrid device. (e) The I–V of the END2–graphene hybrid and bare END2 (inset) in the dark and illuminated states for a white light source at room T. (f) Pulsed ON (yellow) and OFF (no color) cycles showing the photoresponse for the three cases at 1 V bias (where, Ilight ∼ 16.15 mA and Idark ∼ 15.80 mA for END2–graphene, and Ilight ∼ 0.61 mA and Idark ∼ 0.38 mA for END2). (g) A magnified single ON-cycle pulse, where the τr and τd were calculated. Left and right insets show the values of τr and τd for bare END2 and END2–graphene hybrid, respectively. (h) Schematic representation of the energy band diagram for graphene and END2 at equilibrium (top), and under illumination (bottom) illustrating the electron transfer from END2 to graphene, inducing the n-type character in graphene.	 

 	Fig. 6  The (a) Iph, (b) , (c) D, and (d) EQE of the END2–graphene hybrid and the bare END2 from λ ∼ 400–1100 nm at room T. The devices were photo responsive with  ∼ 108 A W−1 for the END2–graphene hybrid and ∼107 A W−1 for END2. The promising broadband optical absorption response with END2 is attributed to the fact that END2 shows broad absorption bands over the entire visible and near-IR regime. From the data in (c) and (d), the D and EQE of the hybrid device was found to be ∼1014 Jones and ∼106 %, respectively.
