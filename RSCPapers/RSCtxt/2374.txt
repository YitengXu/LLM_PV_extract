    , Accepted 11th July 2016First published on 20th July 2016AbstractWO3 nano-grassblades (NGs) were successfully synthesized on a fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) substrate by a two-step hydrothermal method, which involves a nanoseed-generating step and a nano-grassblade-growth step using urea as the morphology-controlling agent. The influence of the seeding procedure on the morphology of the obtained WO3 nanostructure was systematically investigated. The synthesized WO3 NGs were revealed to have a single crystalline structure with a large aspect ratio and perpendicular alignment on FTO substrates. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting properties of the annealed WO3 NGs were performed in 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer solution (pH 7), exhibiting an onset potential of ca. −0.1 V vs. SCE and a maximum photocurrent density of 1.2 mA cm−2 under 1.5 G illumination. Growth time-dependent PEC activity and specific surface area data confirm that the efficient PEC activity of WO3 NGs is attributed to their high specific surface area, which is beneficial in enlarging the WO3/solution interface for water oxidation. This two-step hydrothermal growth technique demonstrates a unique advantage in ensuring firm adhesion of the WO3 film to the FTO substrate and offers a novel route for improving the performance of PEC water splitting devices.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductors as light-harvesting materials is a potential technology for converting solar energy into chemical energy.1–4 Solar powered water splitting is considered as one of the most promising methods to solve the energy and environmental problems of human society.5–8 Solar powered water splitting, also known as artificial photosynthesis, is efficient for solar-to-fuel conversion that must operate for two half-cell reactions, which include the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in the storage of solar energy in the chemical bonds of H2 and O2.9 However, the OER is a bottleneck step in the development of solar energy conversion devices as it involves multiple bond rearrangements between two molecules, which requires a four-electron oxidation coupled to the removal of four protons to form O2.10 Therefore, the OER is a challenge to acheiving artificial photosynthesis for solar energy conversion. Generally, a sacrificial agent is usually introduced to remove the photo-generated electron for charge separation in the study of OER via direct overall solar water splitting. This will result in some negative influences that would increase the complexity and the cost of the photocatalytic system. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using a photovoltaic cell is an approach mimicking photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy, allowing each of the two half-cell reactions to be optimized independently due to spatially separated photogenerated electron/hole pairs.10–12 Since the report of Fujishima and Honda,13 tremendous efforts have been made to develop new materials and approaches for solar water splitting using PEC cells. Among various photoanode materials, WO3 has been considered to be a robust candidate14–23 due to the highly positive position of its valence band edge (ca. 3.0 V vs. NHE), which provides sufficient overpotential for photogenerated holes to oxidize water to O2. Additionally, as one of the promising photoanode materials, WO3 also has the following advantages:24 (i) good electron transport properties, (ii) high chemical and photochemical stability especially in acid solutions, and (iii) moderate hole diffusion length. These advantages indicate that WO3 is a promising photoanode material for PEC water splitting.
The tailored morphology of semiconductor materials can provide beneficial effects to their PEC activity, as it gives a unique possibility to control the direction and path of the charge carriers.25 In this regard, conducting architecture control has been identified as an increasingly important strategy to improve the PEC activity of photocatalytic materials for driving water splitting. Nanostructured materials have high specific surface areas, highly ordered orientation structures and a single charge transfer path for rapid separation of electron–hole pairs; thus the design of nanomaterials provides an effective way to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency.12,26,27
Nanostructured WO3 photoanodes are favorable for PEC application as they offer direct electrical pathways for photogenerated charges while achieving superior charge separation with reduced grain boundaries.22 Recently, WO3 nanostructures have been synthesized by different methods, including solvothermal,22,23,28 sol-gel,29–31 atomic layer deposition,32 anodization,14,33–35 sputtering,36 chemical vapour deposition,37,38 and hydrothermal methods.39–43 The hydrothermal technique has been widely used to prepare the WO3 nanostructure as it is easy to control, convenient and low-cost, which needs neither rigorous procedure nor sophisticated equipment. Generally, a nanoseed layer of WO3 was deposited on a FTO substrate using a spin-coating procedure before the growth of WO3 nanostructures.40 Unfortunately, the spin-coated seed layer usually suffers from heterogeneous size and morphology which results in uneven growth of the WO3 nanostructure. Furthermore, the resulting WO3 film usually has poor mechanical stability with weak adhesion to the substrates,24 which is detrimental to PEC activity because of poor electron contact at the interfaces. In order to solve this problem, the preparation method should be improved to construct nanostructured WO3 photoanodes. Additionally, the preparation of WO3 nanorods or nanowires on the FTO substrate, which are favorable for PEC application due to their more fluent direct electrical pathways, is still a challenge because of their weak adhesion to the substrate, not to mention the high aspect ratio WO3 grassblade-like structure. Therefore, it is highly desirable to prepare high-aspect ratio WO3 nanostructures with good adhesion for effective photochemical water splitting.
Herein, we report a two-step hydrothermal method to fabricate WO3 NG arrays on a FTO substrate using urea as a morphology-controlling agent. A WO3 nanoseed layer was deposited using the hydrothermal method to initiate the growth of NGs. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a direct hydrothermal technology is used as a seed-depositing method to obtain a more uniform seed layer and, as a consequence, a more uniform and mechanically stable WO3 nanostructure. WO3 NGs with excellent adherence and mechanical stability on FTO substrates show superior PEC water splitting activity. We believe that the following factors of the WO3 NGs are responsible for the high PEC activity: (1) the NGs have excellent adherence and mechanical stability, which are beneficial to charge transfer and migration. (2) The high aspect ratio NGs suppress electron–hole recombination due to the confined direction and path for the charge carriers. (3) The grassblade-like structures have a larger specific surface area, which provides more active interfaces between semiconductors and solution for oxidizing water to O2.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of WO3 NGs
WO3 NGs were prepared on FTO substrates (8 Ω sq−1, transparency 80%, Asahi Glass, Japan) by a two-step hydrothermal method. The first step was a nanoseed-generating step in which the FTO substrates were immersed in aqueous solution prepared by dissolving H2WO4 (0.313 g) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (0.125 g) in 30 wt% H2O2 (10 mL). Then the hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 250 °C for 1 h. The resulting WO3 nanoseed-modified FTO substrates were rinsed with copious water for the second step.
The second step allowed for the growth of nanoseeds to form WO3 NGs, using H2WO4 aqueous solution (0.1 mol L−1) as the precursor. The H2WO4 aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving 6.25 g of H2WO4 powder in 40 mL of 30% H2O2 at 95 °C in an oil bath with stirring for 30 min, and then distilled water was added to give 250 mL of the H2WO4 aqueous solution. Afterwards, H2WO4 (3 mL, 0.1 mol L−1), oxalic acid (0.1 g), hydrochloric acid (3 mL, 6 mol L−1), distilled water (1 mL), and acetonitrile (18 mL) were transferred to a reaction autoclave. 0.1 g of urea was then added to the reaction solution to control the morphology of the WO3 product. In a typical procedure, the nanoseed-modified FTO substrates were put into the autoclave with the temperature raised to 180 °C for 2 h, and the reaction time was altered in control experiments to investigate its influence on the PEC properties of the products. The resulting WO3 NG photoanode was rinsed with copious water and annealed at 550 °C for 2 h in air. The fabrication process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.

2.2 Characterization
The morphology of the WO3 NGs was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) measurements were performed using a field emission JEM-2100F microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The crystal structure of the WO3 NGs was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku, rint2000 advance theta–2theta powder diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation in the range of 2θ = 20–80°. The absorption spectrum of the WO3 NGs on FTO was identified using a UV-3600 UV-vis spectrometer. The specific surface areas of the WO3 films were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (BET, Autosorb iQ, Quantachrome Instruments, USA) with nitrogen as adsorption gas at 77.35 K. The FTO substrates with WO3 NGs were placed in a test tube and degassed for 6 h at 300 °C under vacuum (p < 10−4 Pa). The specific surface areas of the catalysts were calculated based on BET interpretation of the adsorption curves at p/p0 = 0.1–0.25, where p and p0 are the equilibrium vapor pressure and the saturation vapor pressure of N2 at 77.35 K respectively. A cross-sectional area of 0.162 nm2 was assumed for the N2 molecule. Before the BET measurements, the FTO substrates were cut into small pieces to fit in the test tube. The total mass of each sample (including the WO3 film and FTO substrate) was measured on a balance. After the BET measurements, the WO3 films grown on FTO substrates were dissolved in KOH solution, and the mass of the FTO substrate was measured. The mass of the WO3 film, which was used to calculate the specific area for each sample, was obtained by comparing the mass before and after dissolution of WO3.
2.3 PEC measurements
PEC measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell with a CHI660A work station (CH Instruments Co.) using a 500 W xenon lamp (CHF-XM-500, Beijing Trusttech Co., Ltd) as the light source. The distance between the lamp and the WO3 photoanode was 12.5 cm, and the maximum incident light intensity on the electrode surface was 100 mW cm−2 (1.5 G), which was measured using a radiometer (FZ-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University). The surface area exposed to the electrolyte was fixed at 0.245 cm2. The PEC measurements were performed in 0.1 mol L−1 KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer solution (pH 7.0) using platinum foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Current density–potential (J–V) measurements were conducted with a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 between −0.2 V and 1.2 V vs. SCE. The chopped curves of J–V measurements were recorded with a potential sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 under chopped illumination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed at a bias potential of 0.2 V vs. SCE using a 20 mV amplitude perturbation with the frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.
2.4 Detection of oxygen evolution
Oxygen evolution was detected quantitatively using a fluorescence-based oxygen sensor (NeoFox, Ocean Optics FOSPOR-R, SN#1217096). A gas-tight three-compartment photoelectrochemical cell with each electrode in one compartment was used. The incident light was projected to the WO3 NG electrode through a quartz window, and the light intensity on the electrode surface was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2. A constant bias potential of 1.0 V vs. SCE was applied to the WO3 NGs in 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 4) buffer solution. The effective irradiation surface area on the working electrode was 2.0 cm2. The probe of the oxygen sensor was sealed in the headspace of the working electrode compartment via a rubber stopper. The O2 concentration was continuously recorded at intervals of 20 s throughout the experiment. The probe was calibrated using two points (high purity N2, 0% O2, and air, 20.9% O2). Prior to the measurement, the photoelectrochemical cell was purged with high purity N2 for 1 h to remove O2 both in the solution and in the gas phase, and then the system was sealed and left static for 10 min to examine leakage.
3. Results and discussion
Recently, a great number of investigations have showed that WO3 nanostructures could be controllably prepared in the presence of capping agents using a hydrothermal approach.40,43,44 Herein we synthesized WO3 NGs on FTO substrates by a two-step hydrothermal method using urea as a morphology-controlling agent. Fig. 2a and b show the SEM images of the WO3 NGs prepared by the two-step hydrothermal approach. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that the WO3 nanoparticles possess a grassblade-like structure and are assembled vertically on the surface of the FTO substrate. The WO3 NGs grow densely and uniformly on the FTO substrate and protrude from the substrate, providing a continuous porous film with a large surface area per unit FTO area. The SEM image with higher magnification indicates that the NGs have an average width of 100 nm and a thickness of ca. 10 nm (Fig. 2b). To estimate the length of the WO3 NGs, the WO3 film was removed from the FTO substrate using an electrically conductive adhesive tape for SEM characterization. The result shows that the length of the WO3 NGs is 2–3 μm (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The growth density, morphology and size of WO3 NGs remain almost unchanged after the annealing at 550 °C for 2 h (Fig. 2c and d), but the NGs tend to get rougher surfaces with a small amount of pulmonary cavitations, which may further enlarge the surface area of the WO3 NGs. The results imply that the microstructure of WO3 NGs is well sustained after the heat treatment.

TEM was used to characterize the crystal structure of the WO3 NGs before and after annealing, and the results are presented in Fig. 3. As shown in a typical HRTEM image of an unannealed WO3 NG (Fig. 3a), clear lattice fringes can be identified, and the lattice spacing along the longitudinal direction is 0.365 nm that corresponds to the (200) plane of hexagonal WO3, indicating that the unannealed WO3 NG grows along the [200] direction. The corresponding SAED pattern reveals that the NG has a single-crystalline structure with a [200] orientation (Fig. 3b). After thermal annealing, however, the lattice spacing along the axis of the WO3 NG changes to 0.375 nm (Fig. 3c), implying that the conversion of the atom arrangement has occurred. As is proposed in previous works,22 the crystal structure of WO3 will transform from hexagonal to monoclinic after annealing in air; hence, the new lattice spacing is assigned to the (020) plane of monoclinic WO3, implying the conversion of preferential orientation. The single-crystalline nature of WO3 NGs is conserved with a [020] orientation (Fig. 3d). This transformation in crystal structure is confirmed by the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4. The unannealed WO3 NGs exhibit a hexagonal structure (JCPDS 85-2459). After annealing at 550 °C for 2 h, all of the peaks can be indexed to the monoclinic phase of WO3 (JCPDS 83-951), indicating that monoclinic WO3 NGs are obtained. In addition, both the (200) peak of the unannealed WO3 and the (020) peak of the annealed one gain maximum intensity among all the peaks in their corresponding pattern, demonstrating the different preferential orientations in WO3 NGs before and after annealing. Considering the vertical alignment of WO3 NGs on FTO substrates, this result is in good agreement with the HRTEM images and SAED patterns in Fig. 3 since these planes, which are perpendicular to the incident X-ray, are mostly irradiated.

To investigate the influence of the seed-generating step on the growth of WO3 NGs, two more preparation strategies were adopted: (1) bare FTO substrates were replaced with the nanoseed-modified FTO, which was the product of the first hydrothermal step of the standard route; (2) WO3 nanoseeds were spin-coated onto FTO according to the previous literature,40 and these FTOs were used as the substrate for our second hydrothermal step. The SEM images and digital photographs of the relative products are displayed in Fig. 5 for comparison. When WO3 is directly grown on bare FTO (Fig. 5a), the resulting WO3 film exhibits poor adhesion to the substrate (Fig. 5d). In the SEM images shown in Fig. 5g and h, it can be clearly observed that the growth density of WO3 decreases significantly. In addition, unlike the grassblade-like structure, the WO3 nanoparticles obtain a rod-like structure. This result provides direct evidence that the seed-generating step is crucial for densely growing WO3 NGs on FTO substrate with good mechanical stability, which is very important for PEC water splitting. The reason is that the nanoseeds fixed on the FTO can serve as stable growth sites for WO3 and firmly connect WO3 NGs to the substrate.

Digital photographs of WO3 films grown on bare FTO (d), spin-coated seed modified FTO (e) and hydrothermally generated seed modified FTO (f). SEM images of WO3 films grown on bare FTO (g, h) and spin-coated seed modified FTO (i, j). 
After the spin-coating method is applied to pre-treat the FTO, numerous seeds with broad size distribution are dispersed on the surface of FTO substrate (Fig. 5b); the mechanical stability of the final WO3 film is improved but a large area of delamination is still visible (Fig. 5e). As shown in Fig. 5i and j, the resulting WO3 nanoparticles are grassblade-like, but numerous cracks are recognizable on the WO3 film. As a consequence, the spin-coated seed layer is not qualified for acquiring a mechanically stable WO3 nanostructure due to its poor size monodispersity. Based on these observations, a direct hydrothermal method for pre-generating seeds layer was introduced. As can be seen from Fig. 5c, a WO3 seed layer is uniformly grown on the FTO substrate after this step, and the nanoseeds have a narrower size distribution. Compared to the other two strategies, hydrothermally grown nanoseeds yield a better WO3 NG structure (Fig. 2) and photoanodes with fewer defects (Fig. 5g), which is more favorable for PEC water splitting due to the more effective electrical contact between the WO3 NGs and the substrates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a direct hydrothermal technology is used as a seed-depositing method to obtain a more uniform seed layer and, as a consequence, more uniform and mechanically stable WO3 NGs. This approach of fabricating WO3 photoanodes may suggest a new strategy for fabricating semiconductor photoanodes with a well-defined microstructure and reliable mechanical stability.
To determine the optimum growth time for the synthesis of WO3 NGs on the FTO substrate, the influence of the growth time on the morphology of the WO3 films under our second hydrothermal step was primarily investigated. Fig. 6 shows typical SEM images of WO3 films grown after different periods of time; it can be seen that both the morphology and the orientation of the obtained WO3 nanostructures have experienced an obvious transformation with elongating time. Fig. 6a exhibits the SEM image of the sample grown for 1 h, and at this stage, square flakes with a length distribution of from 200 to 500 nm and a thickness ranging from 80 to 120 nm are the dominant morphology. When the growth time reaches 2 h, WO3 grassblade-like structures are produced as shown in Fig. 2. The increase in growth density and decrease in size may endow a larger specific area compared with the sample grown for 1 h, and thus is favorable for PEC OER. Further increasing to 4 h brings no obvious change in the morphology of WO3 NGs but simply narrows the tips of the grassblades (Fig. 6b). With the extension of growth time to 6 h, a flower-like structure consisting of sharp-ended nanoparticles is obtained as shown in Fig. 6c. After 8 h of reaction, all of the grassblades are transformed into bundles of nanowires and topple down to the surface of the FTO substrate (Fig. 6d). This structure is unfavorable for PEC application because the parallel alignment of nanowires leads to the breaking of their 3-dimensional nanostructure, which will result in a significant decline in specific area. Therefore it provides neither enough light absorbing sites nor sufficient nanoparticles/electrolyte interfaces where water oxidation reaction proceeds. We believe this growth time-dependent morphology evolution of the WO3 nanostructure originates from the competition between crystal growth and dissolution of WO3 nanoparticles.24,45 At the early stage of growth, the crystal growth process plays a leading role because of the supersaturation of the precursor solution, and large particles are formed because of the fast growth rate of WO3; then with the increasing time, the growth rate decreases due to the consumption of the precursor, while the dissolution of WO3 nanoparticles begins and a dynamic balance between these two competitive processes is established. In this way the total reaction is well controlled, providing an opportunity for finely shaping the WO3 nanoparticles. If the growth time is sufficiently long, the crystal growth rate will be slower than the dissolution rate and the dissolution process becomes the dominant one; thus the WO3 nanostructure previously built will be broken, and the morphology and orientation are significantly altered.

It is known that the morphology and orientation of nanoparticles are inevitably accompanied by the crystalline planes being exposed on the external surface; hence the percentage of the crystalline planes exposed on WO3 films may also be affected by the growth time. Fig. 7 displays the XRD patterns of annealed WO3 films with different growth times. All the patterns agree well with the standard data of monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS 83-951), including the (002), (200) and (020) peaks at 2θ = 23.2°, 23.8° and 24.6°. It is worth noting that the intensity ratios of (020) to (002) and (020) to (200) keep increasing with the elongating time before 6 h, which is in accordance with the perpendicular growth of WO3 NGs. However, the ratios then decline sharply for the 8 h sample. This is possibly attributed to the toppling down of the WO3 nanoparticles. In monoclinic crystals, both the (002) and the (200) planes are perpendicular to the (020) planes. After WO3 nanocrystals are toppled down, the (020) planes, which are previously perpendicular to the incidence X-ray, become parallel to the X-ray and thus are less irradiated. As a result, the intensity of the (020) peak declines sharply. Fig. 7 also shows that strong FTO peaks can be observed in the 1 and 8 h samples. This is because the obtained WO3 films after both 1 and 8 h of growth cannot fully cover the FTO surface, as indicated by the SEM images shown in Fig. 6a and d.

To investigate the light absorbing properties of the WO3 films with different growth times followed by annealing, UV-vis spectroscopy was adopted, and Fig. 8a shows the recorded spectra. We find that the absorption edges of all the films are located at ca. 450 nm, corresponding to a band gap energy of ca. 2.7 eV, which is in conformity with previous results.20 Meanwhile, based on the Tauc plots converted from the UV-vis spectra46 (Fig. 8b), the band gap energies of these WO3 films are estimated to be 2.7–2.8 eV. It can be inferred from the phenomena above that all of the WO3 films have similar light absorbance in the UV-vis range, and therefore growth time has little effect on the light absorbing property of WO3 films.

The PEC water splitting performance of WO3 NG photoanodes was characterized and Fig. 9 presents the results. Fig. 9a depicts the current density–potential (J–V) curves of the annealed WO3 NG photoanodes both in the dark and under illumination. The WO3 NG photoanode exhibits negligible dark current densities in the whole range of potential scan; once the photoanode is accessible to visible illumination, a significant improvement in current density is observed. The photocurrent rises at ca. −0.1 V vs. SCE and then keeps increasing dramatically until saturation beyond 0.6 V vs. SCE. The noisy segment at high potential implies copious oxygen evolution at the photoanode surface. The photocurrent onset potential gives expression to the PEC overpotential for OER, while the photocurrent density reflects the reaction rate of water oxidation at the WO3 NG/electrolyte interface by photogenerated holes. In comparison with previous works,22,23,47 the present onset potential value (−0.1 V vs. SCE) is satisfying for WO3 photoanodes in neutral conditions. The saturated photocurrent density is ca. 1.2 mA cm−2, which is comparable to previously reported values.22,23,29 The low onset potential and considerable photocurrent density indicates that the WO3 NGs are highly active toward OER under illumination.

(c) Equivalent circuit for fitting the EIS spectra. CPE stands for constant potential element. The potential sweep rate in the J–V curves was 50 mV s−1 and the applied potential for the Nyquist plots was 0.2 V vs. SCE. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the interfacial charge transfer on the WO3 NG photoanode in the dark and under illumination at an applied potential of 0.2 V vs. SCE, and the results are shown in Fig. 9b. The WO3 NGs exhibit two impedance semicircles under both conditions, and the spectra were fitted using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 9c. The impedance of the CPE (Z) is given by the following equation: 1/Z = Q(jω)n(1)where Q is the inverse of the impedance at ω = 1 rad s−1, j is an imaginary number, ω stands for the angular frequency and n is the CPE exponent. The values of the elements in the equivalent circuit are shown in Table S1.†
The semicircle at high frequency reflects the contact resistance at the FTO/WO3 interface, while the one at low frequency is attributed to the charge transfer at the WO3/electrolyte interface. As the EIS data were collected at an oxygen-evolving potential (0.2 V vs. SCE), the diameter of the low frequency semicircle reflects the reaction rate of the OER. The low frequency semicircle of the WO3 NGs becomes significantly smaller under illumination, indicating the rapid transfer and exhausting of the photogenerated holes for water oxidation.
As mentioned above, the growth time of WO3 photoanodes influences significantly their morphology, orientation and exposed crystalline planes, which are important factors affecting the PEC activity of the resulting photoanodes. In order to build a quantitative relationship between the growth time and the PEC activity of WO3 photoanodes, the J–V curves of the WO3 photoanodes with different growth times under repeated dark/illumination cycles were recorded. As shown in Fig. 10a, all the photoanodes exhibit instant responses to the dark/illumination changing with similar onset potentials of photocurrent, but the maximum photocurrent density varies among the photoanodes. This value first rises and then declines with increasing growth time, reaching a maximum of ca. 1.2 mA cm−2 at 2 h. The photocurrent densities for the 1 h, 4 h, 6 h and 8 h samples were only 75%, 50%, 42% and 33% of the value obtained on the 2 h sample, respectively. Considering the role of growth time on the morphology, orientation and crystalline planes of WO3 films, we suppose the growth time-dependent PEC activity originates from the difference in the surface area of the WO3 nanostructures, since the samples have little distinction in light absorbance. To prove this hypothesis, the surface areas of these WO3 films were determined through the BET method. The BET result reveals a similar trend to the maximum photocurrent density data, with the highest value of 163.0 m2 g−1 also at 2 h. When the growth time was shorter than 2 h or longer than 6 h, the BET specific area of WO3 films was much lower than 100 m2 g−1. These results confirm our hypothesis and provide solid evidence that the largest specific surface area of the WO3 NGs grown for 2 h is responsible for the highest PEC activity; this is because the largest surface area of the WO3 NGs endows them the most active sites for light absorption and the largest WO3/solution interface area for water oxidation.

The long-term stability of the photocatalysts is an important issue for industrial application; thus, in order to investigate the stability of annealed WO3 NG photoanodes, the current densities as a function of time at different constant applied potentials under chopped illumination were measured. Fig. 11a shows the variation of current density–time (J–t) curves in a 0.1 M KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer solution (pH 7). At the applied potential of 0.2 V vs. SCE, the photocurrent demonstrates no observable decay, indicating the high photostability at low overpotential. However, the photocurrent density experiences a gradual decline, losing 74% and 80% of its initial value at 0.5 V and 1.0 V vs. SCE, respectively. This means that the long-term stability of WO3 NG photoanodes seriously deteriorates at higher potential. The reason is that a reaction that competes with water oxidation, i.e. photocorrosion of WO3 by the photogenerated holes, is also accelerated at higher applied potential, leading to the formation of tungsten peroxo species which are inactive in PEC oxygen evolution. With the increasing time, the accumulation and surface deactivation effect of the newly formed tungsten peroxide reduces the active sites for PEC water splitting and speeds up the loss of photoactivity.47 Previous reports indicated a slighter photocorrosion in an electrolyte with a pH less than 4,23 which could alleviate the dissolution and the formation of peroxo species for WO3 photoanodes. Based on this point, the photostability of WO3 NGs photoanodes were measured in a 0.1 M KH2PO4 solution (pH 4) under chopped illumination as a comparison. As shown in Fig. 11b, the photocurrents remain approximately stable over long periods of time at 0.2 and 0.5 V vs. SCE. This indicates that the acidic solution effectively suppresses the formation of peroxo species and dissolution of WO3, hence photocorrosion is hindered in this way.

To intuitionistically demonstrate the PEC activity of the WO3 NG photoanode toward OER, a gas-tight PEC cell was adopted to detect and monitor the evolution of oxygen at a bias of 1.0 V vs. SCE in KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer solution (pH 4). As indicated in Fig. 12, O2 evolution can be observed under illumination, and there is an obvious delay of ca. 900 s before the onset of the O2 signal. We believe this is due to the whole cell being degased with N2, and the solution has to be saturated with O2 before the generated O2 diffuses to the gas phase and reaches the oxygen sensor, which was placed in the headspace of the cell. After the initial lag, the detected O2 production rate agrees well with the theoretical one, which was calculated by integrating the photocurrent and assuming that the photocurrent arises from the OER. The result above provides solid evidence that the PEC OER contributes most to the photocurrent, confirming the WO3 NGs to be an efficient photoanode for PEC OER.

4. Conclusions
For the first time, we adopted a novel two-step hydrothermal method to synthesize WO3 NGs with a high aspect ratio single crystalline structure on FTO substrates, using urea as a morphology-controlling agent, followed by annealing to transform the products to the monoclinic phase. The influence of a nanoseed-generating method on the morphology, appearance and mechanical stability of the photoanode were systematically investigated. The results show that a nanoseed-generating step prior to the growth is essential to obtain uniform WO3 NG films on FTO substrates with reliable adhesion, and producing nanoseeds by the hydrothermal route is more favorable than that by spin-coating. Additionally, the growth time under the second hydrothermal step has obvious effects on the morphology, orientation and exposed crystalline planes of the resulting WO3 nanostructures but little effect on their light absorbing properties. The influence of growth time was reflected in the PEC performances, and the photoanodes grown for 2 h demonstrate the highest activity under 1.5 G illumination, with the onset potential of ca. −0.1 V vs. SCE and the maximum photocurrent density of ca. 1.2 mA cm−2. The variation of specific surface area is responsible for the differences in PEC performance among the photoanodes. Although the long-term photostability of WO3 NGs is far from satisfactory in neutral solution, it can be significantly improved in acidic medium. The photocurrent originates mainly from O2 evolution. The present results demonstrate that the high aspect ratio structure is beneficial in offering more WO3/solution interfaces for water oxidation. This work shows the superiority of the two-step hydrothermal growth technique with a direct pre-generated seed layer for good adhesion with the FTO substrate, offering promising opportunities for constructing semiconductor photoanodes and enhancing the activity of PEC water-splitting devices.
