    , Accepted 13th November 2019First published on 6th December 2019AbstractHydrophilicity greatly limits the application of ZnO in catalysis, sensing, energy conversion and other applications. There is an extremely urgent need to prepare superhydrophobic ZnO. In this study, a novel superhydrophobic ZnO flower-like nanostructure with petals 10 μm in length and 2 μm in width was obtained by a combination of hydrothermal and single dip-coating methods on nickel foam. Porous flower-like ZnO nanostructures were synthesized on the nickel foam substrate by an economical hydrothermal method combined with subsequent calcinations. The rough surface caused by acid treatment and the cross-growth of the petals increased the stability of the flower-like ZnO and the binding force between the ZnO layer and the nickel wire. Decomposition of the ZnO precursor released CO2 and H2O, leaving uniform holes in the ZnO petals. After hydrophobic treatment with PFAS, the contact angle was 154° and the sliding angle was approximately 2°, indicating that the surface changed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic. The superhydrophobic surface could withstand a temperature of 350 °C in an air atmosphere, indicating that the superhydrophobic surface has good thermal stability. The ZnO flower-like nanostructure can be potentially used in microwave absorption, electrochemical sensing, heterogeneous catalysis and lithium-metal batteries. This work provides a new method for the practical fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces.
1. Introduction
Transition metal oxides with unique physical and chemical properties play an important role in catalysis, sensing, energy conversion and other applications.1–5 Catalan et al.6 summarized the basic physics and unresolved aspects of BiFeO3 and emphasized its application prospects in spintronics and memory devices. With the vigorous development of nanotechnology, people have realized that in addition to the constituent elements of nanomaterials, their micro- and nanostructures (particle size, hollow and porous structure, etc.) also have a significant effect on the function of the materials.7–12 Zheng et al.13 emphasized that hierarchical architecture could provide numerous accessible electroactive sites for redox reactions, shorten the diffusion distance of Li ions during the reaction, and accommodate volume expansion during cycling and thus improve the performance of LIBs. Therefore, the physical and chemical properties of transition metal oxide materials can be improved by precise design and regulation of their crystal plane structure and other microstructures.
ZnO is one of the most widely used transition metal oxides in our daily lives. For example, ZnO tetrapod materials can be used as nanoelectronic/optoelectronic sensing devices, multifunctional composites/coatings, novel biomedical engineering materials, versatile energy harvesting candidates and unique structures for applications in chemistry, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food, agriculture, engineering technologies, and many others.14 To date, various morphologies and sizes of nano-ZnO, including one-dimensional ZnO,15 two-dimensional ZnO (ref. 16) and three-dimensional ZnO,17 have been prepared by the methods of chemical vapor deposition,18 microwave irradiation, electrochemical synthesis, atomic layer deposition (ALD)19 and hydrothermal synthesis. Liu et al.20 integrated ZnO-NW arrays onto Si micropyramids as an effective antireflection coating for improving the energy-conversion efficiency. However, the hydrophilic ZnO-NW arrays could adsorb and accumulate dust, which blocks the incident light and reduces the power output, and superhydrophobicity must be developed to reduce dust accumulation on the solar-cell surface. Superhydrophobic nano-ZnO on various substrates has been reported in recent years.21–24 Recently, Banik et al.25 achieved self-cleaning behavior on the growing ZnO nanorod surface by a hydrothermal technique on a sputtered ZnO seed layer using a monolayer colloidal mask as a template. However, most of the nano-ZnO was prepared on sheet materials without pores, which greatly hindered its application. If nano-ZnO is prepared on a 3D porous substrate, such as nickel foam and porous ceramic, the porosity and surface area of the ZnO/substrate will be greatly increased and its properties will be further improved.
Nickel foam is one of the most attractive 3D porous materials for use as an electronic and catalytic substrate due to its high specific surface area, open-pore structure, mechanical strength and low cost.26 Various morphologies of species, such as nanowires,27 nanoneedles,28 nanosheets29,30 and core–shell nanostructures,31 have been prepared on the surface of nickel foam. Recently, Liu et al.32 reported the use of Co0.75Ni0.25Se/NF, which was formed by two-step growth of metallic cobalt–nickel selenide nanorods on porous nickel foam, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, and this catalyst showed good performance. However, due to the poor adhesion of the final species on the nickel foam, Ni or NiO was introduced to improve the stability of species on the surface of the nickel foam.33–35 In addition, the porosity of the nickel foam prevented active components from entering the channel, leading to the slow coverage of the coatings and thus affecting the performance of the coatings.
In this work, porous flower-like ZnO was directly synthesized on a nickel foam substrate by an economical hydrothermal method combined with subsequent calcinations. The influence of the nickel wire roughness on the distribution of ZnO on the surface of the nickel foam was investigated. The effects of hydrothermal treatment time on the morphology of the ZnO were also studied. The surface morphology, surface area, hydrophobic properties and hydrophobic stability after hydrophobic modification with PFAS were studied in detail. This work provides a possibility for the application of ZnO in a porous hydrophobic environment and provides a new method for the practical fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All the chemicals, zinc nitrate hexahydrate (AR, Guangzhou), hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) (AR, Guangzhou), oxalate monohydrate (AR, Tianjin), trichloromethane (AR, Shanghai), PFAS (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane) (96%, Shanghai), hexane (AR, Tianjin) and ethanol (AR, Tianjin), were used as purchased without purification.
2.2 Pretreatment of nickel foam
Sliced nickel foam with a size of 25 mm × 25 mm × 5 mm and pore density of 110 ppi was used as the substrate for the growth of ZnO nanostructures. First, the sliced nickel foam was completely soaked in 0.1 M NaOH or HNO3 solution at 80 °C for 1 h to remove oil stains and oxides from the surface. Then, it was cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with acetone and deionized water to remove impurities until the cleaning water was neutral. Finally, the sliced nickel foam was dried overnight at 60 °C in a vacuum drying oven and subjected to the growth of the ZnO precursor.
2.3 Growth of ZnO nanostructures
ZnO porous multilayer flower-like structures were fabricated via a hydrothermal and decomposition process. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) were dissolved in 40 ml of distilled water. Then, oxalic acid (H2C2O4) was added to the solution, and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min to make it clear, resulting in a synthesis solution with a molar composition of 1 Zn2+:2 HMT:0.1 H2C2O4:278 H2O. The synthesis solution was transferred to a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel reactor with the pretreated substrates placed vertically inside; the reactor was heated to 90 °C and maintained for several hours after the reactor was sealed and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The substrates were washed with ethanol and water several times and the ZnO precursors growing on the nickel foam substrates were obtained after the substrates were dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
The ZnO precursors were placed in a muffle furnace and the temperature was ramped to 400 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1 and then kept at this temperature for 2 h. After the furnace cooled to room temperature, the nickel foam substrate turned yellow and the porous crystalline ZnO nanostructures were obtained.
Five types of ZnO nanostructures were synthesized. The ZnO synthesized by 4 h of hydrothermal treatment on nickel foam pretreated with NaOH was named M0. The ZnO synthesized by 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h and 4 h of hydrothermal treatment on nickel foam pretreated with HNO3 were named M1, M2, M3 and M4, respectively.
2.4 Hydrophobic treatment of ZnO nanostructures
A 1 wt% PFAS solution was prepared by dispersing PFAS in hexane under vigorous stirring for 30 min at room temperature. The hydrophobic treatment was performed by a single dipping method.36 The PFAS solution was transferred to a sealed Teflon-lined reactor, and then nickel foams with ZnO nanostructures were added and kept at room temperature for 24 h. Afterwards, the nickel foams were rinsed with trichloromethane and distilled water several times. Finally, the nickel foams were dried at 120 °C for 12 h and the hydrophobic surface was obtained.
The samples M1, M2, M3 and M4 were denoted as MH1, MH2, MH3 and MH4, respectively, after hydrophobic treatment.
2.5 Photocatalytic performance
The photocatalytic activity was studied with the decomposition of methylene blue under simulated sunlight irradiation.37 The solar simulator had a 300 W Xe lamp. Then, 1.0 mg of catalyst was added to 3.0 mL methylene blue solution (optical density of 1.0). The UV-vis absorption spectrum of methylene blue was monitored at 664 nm over time after the photocatalytic reaction started. The contribution of adsorption was removed after stirring the samples in the dark for 30 min before the photocatalytic reaction.
2.6 Characterization of ZnO nanostructures
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by a Bruker D8 ADVANCE instrument using CuKα radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA to examine the structure of ZnO and its precursor.
The morphology and microstructure of ZnO were studied using a Nova NanoSEM230 operating at 10 kV (SEM) and a JEM-3010 operating at 200 kV (TEM). The powders deposited on the nickel foam were separated from the nickel foam and dispersed in ethanol solution to produce a ZnO suspension. The suspension was dropped on a copper mesh with a carbon film, and this copper mesh was used for TEM testing after drying.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed using a Varian 3100 spectrometer with the samples diluted in KBr (spectroscopy grade). FT-IR spectra were collected using 50 scans in the region of 4000–400 cm−1 at a resolution of 2 cm−1. The UV-visible reflectance spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis spectrometer.
The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded on an AUTOSORB-1C apparatus at 77 K after the samples were annealed at 200 °C for 6 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was calculated by using the desorption data.
Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out with a Diamond 6300 apparatus at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a flow of air. Meanwhile, the gases produced during the heating were introduced into the mass spectrometry for testing.
The surface hydrophobicity was measured by a contact angle measuring instrument (SDC-100). To reduce errors, five samples under the same conditions were tested, and the average values of the five samples were taken. The total volume of the water droplet used in this paper was 8 μL.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The structure and morphology of ZnO nanostructures
To determine the structure of the powders deposited on the nickel foam, the samples are characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of the powder without calcination (Fig. 1a) is consistent with the JCPDS file #19-1472, indicating that the powder without calcination is ZnC2O4·Zn(OH)2, a typical precursor salt of ZnO. After calcination at 400 °C for 2 h, both M0 and M4 (Fig. 1c and d) show the typical diffraction peaks of the ZnO wurtzite structure (JCPDS file #36-1451) in addition to those of Ni (marked by the symbol ●), indicating that the ZnC2O4·Zn(OH)2 precursor is completely decomposed into ZnO. The peak intensity of ZnO for M4 is considerably higher than that for M0, indicating that the ZnO layer is more compact or thicker over M4 than over M0.

Fig. 2 shows the effects of pretreatment of the nickel foam substrate on ZnO morphology. The surface morphology of the nickel wire in the nickel foam substrate is obviously different after different pretreatments. The nickel wire has a smooth surface when the nickel foam is pretreated with NaOH (Fig. 2a). While it has many homogeneous burr-like protuberances after nickel foam pretreatment with HNO3, the surface has uniform roughness (Fig. 2b). The role of the alkali is to remove the oily and dense oxide film from the surface of the nickel wire, while the acid can also react with nickel to destroy the surface morphology of the nickel wire, making the surface rough. The top view shows that a layer of flower-like ZnO is grown on the surface of nickel wire in the nickel foam substrate for both M0 and M4 after hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent calcination. Flower-like ZnO clusters are piled on the surface of the alkaline-treated nickel foam and there is a large gap between them (Fig. 2c and e). However, the ZnO nanostructure grows evenly without obvious gaps on the surface of the acid-treated nickel foam (Fig. 2d and f). The cross-sectional views indicate that a ZnO layer has grown over the nickel wire in the nickel foam, forming a two-layer structure for both samples. The thickness of the ZnO layer in M0 is approximately 6 μm and that of M4 is approximately 10 μm, indicating that the ZnO petal length of M4 is longer than that of M0. There is a clear crack between the ZnO layer and the substrate in M0 (Fig. 2g), indicating a weak binding force between the substrate and the ZnO layer. In contrast, the ZnO layer is tightly bound to the rough surface in M4 (Fig. 2h), indicating that the rough surface treated by acid is beneficial to the growth of the ZnO layer. This result is caused by the different pretreatments that change the morphology of the nickel wire in the nickel foam. The substrate treated with acid has a much rougher surface than that treated with alkaline, leading to the ZnO precursor being easier to deposit on the surface of the nickel wire and thus promoting the growth of the ZnO layer. In addition, the rough surface increases the contact area between the substrate and the ZnO, leading to a stronger binding force between the ZnO layer and the substrate. Accordingly, the substrate treated with HNO3 is more advantageous to the growth of the ZnO layer.

Fig. 3 shows the effect of hydrothermal treatment time on the morphology of the ZnO nanostructure. When the nickel foam is hydrothermally treated for 0.5 h, ZnO is evenly laid on the surface of the nickel wire in a network with a thickness of approximately 1.8 μm (Fig. 3a and b). With the increase in the hydrothermal treatment time, ZnO grows with a vertical bias on the grid to form a sheet structure, and the thickness of the ZnO layer increases gradually. The stability of the ZnO layer on the surface of the nickel wire is enhanced by the intersection of the ZnO sheets. The ZnO sheets grow in both lateral and vertical directions; however, the growth rate of the ZnO sheets along the direction perpendicular to the surface of the nickel foam is much faster than that in other directions, which eventually leads to an increase in the length of the ZnO sheets. With the increase in the length of the ZnO, the thickness of the ZnO layer gradually increases to 7.6 μm (Fig. 3f). When the hydrothermal treatment time increases to 4 h, the growth rate of ZnO sheets decreases, and concentrated growth occurs in the middle of the sheets, ultimately forming the petal morphology. The diameters of the petals range from 1 μm to 2 μm, and their surfaces are smooth (Fig. 4b). It should be noted that there are many holes in the petals of the ZnO nanostructure. To explore the specific structure of holes, we perform a detailed study of the petal morphology.

Fig. 4 shows the structure and morphology of the ZnO nanostructure in M4. The morphology of ZnO is similar to that of its precursor, indicating that high temperature does not destroy the three-dimensional structure of the precursor (Fig. 4bvs. a). There are no holes on the surface of the precursor (Fig. 4a). However, after calcination, holes are evenly distributed at the top and bottom of the petals (Fig. 4b and c). Fig. 4d shows that the flower-like ZnO has clear lattice fringes and the lattice spacing is 0.28 nm, which agrees with the (100) crystal planes of hexagonal ZnO.38,39 These results are consistent with the XRD results.

Fig. 5a shows the TG-MS curves of the powders separated from M4 before calcination. The TG analysis shows a two-step weight loss. The first weight loss step at temperatures below 260 °C is attributed to the release of CO2 from the thermal decomposition of the precursor. The second weight loss occurs in the temperature range from 260 °C to 350 °C, which is assigned to the release of crystalline water, hydroxyl moieties and CO2 from the thermal decomposition of the precursor. When the temperature is higher than 450 °C, the weight of the powder will not be reduced and the corresponding signals of H2O and CO2 disappear. The DTA results present endothermic and exothermic peaks corresponding to the weight loss stages and the signal intensity of CO2 and H2O. Accordingly, conversion from the ZnC2O4·Zn(OH)2 precursor to ZnO with increasing temperature can be described by the following equation (eqn (1)). During the conversion process, the release of gases (H2O and CO2) leads to the formation of a porous structure.40Fig. 5b shows the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of ZnO separated from M4, and the inset shows the corresponding pore size distribution of ZnO. As shown, there is hardly any adsorption in the relative pressure range of 0–0.9 P/P0 for nickel foam, and the adsorption and desorption isotherms almost coincide, indicating that almost no micropores and mesopores are present on the nickel foam. The isotherm of ZnO shows a curve with a distinct H3-type hysteresis loop, which is ascribed to the presence of mesoporous structures in the ZnO. The surface area of the ZnO is calculated to be 38.14 m2 g−1. Furthermore, the pore size distribution shows that the pore sizes are mainly concentrated below 10 nm, which is attributed to the mesoporous channels. 2ZnC2O4·Zn(OH)2 + O2 → 4ZnO + 4CO2 + 2H2O(1)

3.2 Hydrophobic properties of ZnO nanostructures

Fig. 6 shows SEM images of the ZnO nanostructure after hydrophobic treatment and the inset shows the corresponding water contact angles (WCAs). After hydrophobicity modification, the morphology of the ZnO nanostructure on the surface of the nickel wire hardly changes. That is, the surface becomes rougher and more uniform with increasing hydrothermal treatment time. The surface also changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic for all the surfaces, and the contact angles of all the samples are greater than 120°, indicating that the hydrophobicity of the surface is the result of the interaction of the rough flower-like ZnO and the low-surface-energy fluoride.41 However, there are some differences in the water contact angles of those surfaces. The water contact angle increases from 132° for MH1 to 154° for MH4. The water sliding angle of the MH4 is approximately 2°, indicating that the surface of MH4 exhibits superhydrophobic properties. To evaluate the mechanical strength of the superhydrophobic surface of MH4, a pencil hardness test is performed as reported elsewhere.42 The pencil is tilted 45° to the surface while applying a force of 7.5 N. After the 3H pencil hardness test, although some of the ZnO petals are broken, the ZnO layer is not damaged, indicating that the ZnO layer can withstand the 3H pencil hardness test. However, some scratches appear after the 4H pencil hardness test, indicating that hardness greater than that of the 4H pencils can cause damage to the ZnO layer.
 Fig. 6  SEM images of the ZnO nanostructure after hydrophobic treatment. (a) MH1; (b) MH2; (c) MH3; (d) MH4. 
To explore the thermal stability of the superhydrophobicity of MH4, MH4 is calcined for 2 h at different temperatures in an air atmosphere, and the changes in the contact angle are investigated, as shown in Fig. 7. The contact angles fluctuate to a certain extent, but they are greater than 150° after calcination at 200–350 °C for 2 h, indicating that the hydrophobicity is well preserved. When the calcination temperature is up to 400 °C, the contact angle drops to <12° and the hydrophobicity of the surface disappears. From the TG curve, one can see that there is little weight loss before 350 °C. Some residual solvents, water or low-boiling-point substances volatilize from the hydrophobic surface, which may lead to the fluctuation of the contact angle in the temperature range from 50 °C to 350 °C. However, the structure and chemical composition of the surface do not change in this temperature range, causing no change in hydrophobicity. When the temperature is greater than 350 °C, the MH4 sample experiences a significant weight loss, indicating the decomposition of the organic groups. Due to the decomposition of the organic groups at high temperature and the formation of –OH during the cooling process43,44 the MH4 sample changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Accordingly, the superhydrophobic surface can withstand a temperature of 350 °C in an air atmosphere.

Fig. 8 shows the FT-IR spectra of MH4. PFAS is composed of a long hydrophobic fluorinated chain (–CFx) and a hydrophilic silicon end (Si-OR), while the hydrophilic ZnO presents a large number of –OH groups. When M4 is added to a PFAS solution, Si-OR groups react with the –OH on the ZnO surfaces to form a self-assembled film.45 The hydrophobic fluorinated chains are exposed outside to repel water. After hydrophobic treatment, absorption peaks at around 1240, 1210 and 1150 are detected assigned to the C–F stretching vibration of the –CF2 and –CF3 moieties of the PFAS molecules in MH4.46 However, when MH4 is calcined at 400 °C for 2 h, the absorption peaks assigned to the C–F stretching vibration disappear, indicating the decomposition of the organic groups at high temperatures. These results are consistent with the contact angle and TG analysis results.

The hydrophilic flower-like ZnO layer has displayed long-wavelength adsorption and photocatalytic performance (Fig. S1 and S2†), while the thermal stability, isotropic crystal symmetry and superhydrophobic flower-like ZnO layer are potentially good materials for microwave absorption by inducing heterogeneous atoms in them.47,48 Furthermore, the even distribution of holes at the ZnO petals is expected to improve the sensitivity and efficiency of ZnO-based electrochemical sensors and heterogeneous catalysts49 and regulate lithium deposition for lithium-metal batteries.50
4. Conclusion
In this work, novel superhydrophobic ZnO flower-like nanostructures with petals 10 μm in length and 2 μm in width were obtained by a combination of hydrothermal and single dip-coating methods. The ZnO flower-like nanostructure grew on the nickel wire surface in the acid-treated nickel foam with holes evenly distributed on the petals. After hydrophobic treatment with PFAS, the contact angle was 154° with a sliding angle of approximately 2°, indicating that the surface has superhydrophobic properties. The superhydrophobic surface could withstand a temperature of 350 °C in an air atmosphere. The superhydrophobic surface has great application prospects in the fields of microwave absorption, heterogeneous catalysis, lithium-metal batteries, etc. This work provides a new method for practical fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces.
