    , Accepted 15th July 2021First published on 23rd July 2021AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their exotic properties. Semiconducting p-type 2D crystals are crucial to the construction of versatile p–n junction-based nanoelectronic devices, and promising future optoelectronic applications. Herein, we reported the growth of high-quality p-type silicon telluride (Si2Te3) single crystals using the chemical vapor transport (CVT) technique. Few layered Si2Te3 nanosheets were obtained by mechanical exfoliation and used to fabricate a phototransistor device under a rigid silicon substrate. The Si2Te3 nanosheet-based transistor exhibits an outstanding device performance, such as a high photoresponsivity of approximately 1396 A W−1 and a larger specific detectivity of approximately 2.52 × 1012 Jones at a wavelength of 633 nm. The values obtained using the Si2Te3 single crystal are remarkably superior to those obtained for the other chalcogenide 2D crystals, such as Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3. In addition, the normalized gain value of approximately 2.74 × 10−4 V−1 cm2 achieved using this field-effect transistor (FET) device is several orders higher than those of the other 2D single crystal-based FET devices. Our results suggest that the Si2Te3 single crystal could be a benchmark candidate for the integration of prospective p–n junction circuits and photo-sensing applications.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of graphene, two-dimensional (2D) materials have received a tremendous amount of interest owing to their exceptional physical properties, such as the distinct electronic structure, high electrical mobility, high thermal conductivity, large surface area, mechanical stiffness, and transparency.1,2 In the bulk form, these materials are layer-by-layer stacked through weak van der Waals interactions and strong covalent bonding. By applying an external mechanical force, the weakly interacting layers can be easily peeled giving mono-layered to few-layered thicknesses.3,4 Although graphene exhibits unique transport properties,5,6 the zero bandgap nature leads to limitations in the optoelectronic properties,7,8 there are plenty of 2D materials with suitable bandgaps that can be explored for optoelectronic applications. Among these, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show characteristic transport properties like those of graphene.9–12 In addition, these materials exhibit unique electronic structures that span metals to semiconductors for potential uses in optoelectronic applications, particularly in photodetectors, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and random lasers.13–16 However, TMD-based materials lack natural p-type behavior, and hence the possibility of forming a p–n junction using 2D crystals is restricted in confined materials. The p–n intersection is an essential building block for many functional devices, therefore it is necessary to explore novel p-type based 2D semiconducting materials.17,18
Among numerous 2D crystals, only a few materials, such as black phosphorous,19 germanium sulfide,20 and gallium selenide,21 exhibit natural p-type behaviors. In a recent discovery, it was observed that silicon telluride (Si2Te3) possesses p-type behavior. Moreover, Si2Te3 exhibits unique physical properties, such as both indirect (1.85 eV) and direct (2.2 eV) optical band gaps, a large defect density (∼1017 cm−3), and prominent photoluminescence between 640–850 nm with a high quantum yield.22,23 It is well known that silicon resulted in an extraordinary revolution in semiconductor technology owing to its dominant properties. Furthermore, Si offers a strong base for many classes of materials with outstanding performances, thus, it acts as a strong backbone in modern technologies.24,25 These properties have inspired us to investigate the electronic and optoelectronic properties of the silicon-chalcogenide material Si2Te3, for use in applications such as transistors and photodetectors. The phototransistor performance of the high-quality Si2Te3 single crystal has not been reported to date, to the best of our knowledge.
Phototransistor devices are used to transform light signals into electrical signals, they are a fundamental component in the modern miniaturized electronic industry. These devices are essential to the capture, identification, and visualization of optical signals.26–28 They can be used to detect light of various sub-bands, such as ultraviolet, visible, and infrared rays with diverse applications in daily life, industrial, military, and agricultural applications. Ultraviolet detection can be used for monitoring the environment, and in the space and defense sectors, whereas visible light detection is used in video imaging, displays, optoelectronic storage, and industrial safety. Infrared detection applications are focused on night vision, remote control, and satellite remote sensing. Based on the 2D semiconducting materials, several photodetection devices have been explored to detect a wide spectral range of light from ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths. However, these devices suffer from severe drawbacks, such as instability, poor photoresponse, low on/off ratios, structural disorders, and defects. Therefore, there is an increasing demand to construct photo devices based on novel materials that are needed to enable high-performance-based photodetection to improve the functionality and commercialization of photodetectors.
There are few reports on the synthesis of 2D Si2Te3 materials in nanoplates and nanoribbons in a range of thicknesses from 50 to 1000 nm and a length of approximately 10 μm using standard vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) methods.22,23,29 Most of these methods for the growth of 2D Si2Te3 often lead to the formation of impurity phases, such as Te and SiTe2, owing to the high vapor pressure of the chalcogenides, which in turn cause large structural imperfections in the crystal lattices. It has been widely proved that the chemical vapor transport (CVT) technique can be used to grow high vapor pressure compounds because it facilitates a thermodynamically favored vapor phase reaction in the presence of an appropriate transporting agent. In this work, for the first time, we attempted to grow high-quality phase pure 2D Si2Te3 single crystals using the CVT method for the exfoliation of defect-free phase pure large area nanosheets. The high-quality few-layered nanosheets obtained from the exfoliation of CVT-grown Si2Te3 single crystals show excellent optoelectronic properties through the Si2Te3 field-effect transistor device (FET), in which the few-layered Si2Te3 nanosheets were used as a conducting channel. The carrier mobility of the exfoliated few-layered Si2Te3-FET was calculated and found to be approximately 1.03 V−1 cm2 s−1 with p-type behavior and an on/off ratio of 103. The few-layered Si2Te3 exhibits a high photoresponsivity of approximately 394 A W−1 under the illumination of 6 nW at a 633 nm wavelength. The obtained photoresponsivity is higher compared with similar families of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3.
Moreover, the photo responsivity was enhanced further to 1396 A W−1 by supplying a gate voltage at −40 V. In addition, the specific detectivity (D*) and normalized gain were estimated and found to be approximatey 2.52 × 1012 Jones and 2.74 × 10−4 V−1 cm2, respectively. The obtained D* is almost equivalent to the commercial silicon photodiodes. The figures-of-merit obtained from the FET device demonstrate that few-layered Si2Te3 nanosheets are noteworthy potential candidates for device applications, mainly for the construction of phototransistors with a high photoresponse and multipurpose optoelectronics applications based on an amalgamation of p–n junctions.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Crystal growth and characterization

Fig. 1a shows a schematic diagram of the CVT technique30 used to grow high-quality bulk Si2Te3 single crystals. The crystal growth was carried out in a horizontal two-zone muffle furnace. The CVT reaction was conducted in a quartz ampoule of 100 cm and an outer/inner diameter of 12/10 cm. A stoichiometric quantity of the silicon and tellurium powders was ground and mixed well with the high vapor pressure transporting agent iodine. The precursor materials were loaded into the quartz ampoule and sealed at a pressure of approximately 10−5 torr. One end of the quartz tube containing the precursor material was kept in the hot furnace zone to maintain the temperature gradient. The reacting materials were heated to a high temperature of 900 °C, and the other end of the tube was maintained at a lower temperature of 850 °C. During the CVT growth process, the powder materials started to vaporize and react in the vapor state. They moved into the lower temperature area of the tube with a high vapor pressure transporting agent and finally deposited as bulk single-crystalline materials. After a growth period of 15 d, the shiny Si2Te3 single crystals were collected. The as-grown millimeter-sized Si2Te3 single crystals obtained using the CVT growth technique are shown on the right side of Fig. 1a.

(b) Three-dimensional view of the crystal structure of Si2Te3. (c) XRD diffraction pattern of the Si2Te3 single-crystal revealing the preferred growth oriented along the c-axis. (d) Single crystallinity diffraction pattern of the Si2Te3 crystal, the inset shows the HR-TEM image with clear lattice fringes. (e) SEM image revealing the layered nature of the Si2Te3 single crystals. 
The Si2Te3 single-crystal belongs to the trigonal crystal structure. Fig. 1b illustrates the architecture of Si2Te3, in which Si pairs are distributed among four equivalent orientations inside octahedral vacancies of a hexagonal close-packed Te lattice. The adjacent layers of these building blocks are bonded via weak van der Waals interactions, which in turn offer the best possibility for micromechanical exfoliation towards the monolayer or few-layered nanosheets of Si2Te3. The crystal structure and phase purity of the as-grown Si2Te3 single crystal were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The observed XRD pattern for the Si2Te3 single-crystal (Fig. 1c) matches that of the trigonal crystal structure with the space group P1c (JCPDF 00-022-1323). The complete absence of additional peaks corresponding to the secondary/impurity phase in the XRD pattern confirms the phase purity of the material. The repeated Miller planes corresponding to (00l) diffraction peaks reveal the single crystallinity and the preferred growth orientation along the c-axis. The single crystallinity of the as-grown Si2Te3 crystal was further confirmed using a selected area diffraction (SAED) pattern with bright diffraction spots, as shown in Fig. 1d. The inset shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images, and the interplanar distance estimated from the HR-TEM image for the Si2Te3 single crystal is approximately 0.37 nm. The surface morphological and elemental distribution were identified using field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy-dispersive-ray spectroscopy (EDAX). From the FE-SEM image, the stacking of the Si2Te3 layers in the 2D crystal was observed. The EDAX spectrum (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) and the elemental mapping (Fig. S2 in the ESI†) confirms the presence of silicon (Si) and telluride (Te) elements.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also performed to examine the chemical state and elemental composition. Fig. 2a displays the typical XPS spectra of the as-grown Si2Te3 crystal,31 in which three solid peaks were observed at binding energies around 102.95, 572. 5, and 582.9 eV. The peak at 102.95 eV corresponds to Si 2p, and the peaks at 572. 5 and 582.9 eV are linked to the binding energies of Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2. The Te 3d shows a slight shift towards the lower binding energies by −0.5 eV compared to the pure Te at 573 eV owing to the chemical bonding between the Te and Si elements. The absorbance and photoluminescence were measured and are revealed in Fig. 2b and c. A solid spectral absorption on the bulk Si2Te3 crystal was observed from the near-infrared to the visible regions with a high absorption behavior, especially in the visible area, which shows that the Si2Te3 crystal is a strong photo absorbing material. Fig. 2c shows the photoluminescence spectrum and the wavelength of the emission maxima 665 nm correspond to a bandgap value of 1.86 eV, which agrees well with the reported bandgap of the bulk Si2Te3 compound.29,32 The PL spectrum with an extended wavelength range from 500–900 nm reveals the defect emissions associated with the band edge emission and these are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

2.2. Electronic and optoelectronic characterization
The electrical characteristics of the exfoliated few-layered Si2Te3 nanosheets were revealed by fabricating FET devices. Using the standard scotch tape process, the few-layered Si2Te3 nanosheets were transferred on a Si wafer and the top surface was covered by a dielectric SiO2 layer with a thickness of 300 nm. The thickness of the exfoliated few-layered Si2Te3 nanosheet was found to be approximately 15 nm using atomic force microscopy (Fig. S4, ESI†). Then, Cr/Au (5/70 nm) electrodes were deposited at both ends of the Si2Te3 nanosheets using the typical lithographic procedure33,34 as illustrated in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b shows the optical and SEM images of the as-fabricated Si2Te3-FET device. The source-drain current versus the source-drain voltage (Ids–Vds) of the few-layered Si2Te3-FET (Fig. 3c) was measured at room temperature under ambient conditions with varying gate voltages ranging from 0 to −60 V. At a higher negative gate voltage (Vg), the Ids–Vds curve increases gradually, revealing the Si2Te3 crystals have an apparent p-type behavior. The source-drain current versus back-gate voltage (Ids–Vg) curve (Fig. 3d) measured at Vds = 10 V further confirms the p-type nature of the Si2Te3. The electron mobility (μe) of the few-layered Si2Te3-FETwas calculated by the mobility equation of μe = L/W (ε0εr/d)Vds (dIds/dVg), in which L is the channel length, W is the channel width, ε0 is 8.85 × 10−12 Fm−1, εr is 3.9 for SiO2, d is the thickness of SiO2 (300 nm), Vds is the drain voltage 10 V, and dIds/dVg is the transconductance from the Ids–Vg curve.35,36 From the equation, the calculated μe of our Si2Te3-FET device was observed to be approximately 1.03 V−1 cm2 s−1, and the on/off ratio was about 103 (Fig. S5, ESI†), which is comparable to other 2D materials. The presence of trap states between the Si2Te3 and the SiO2 dielectric layer plays a prominent role in the charge carrier mobility. Reducing these trap states at the interface using a polymer coating enhances the mobility of the device.37,38

We further studied the Si2Te3-FET device performance for photocurrent generation using an illuminating laser with a wavelength of 633 nm at room temperature, the schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 4a. Photocurrent generation is an important figure of merit for good photo-detecting devices. The Ids–Vds measurements in the dark and in the presence of various laser powers are presented in Fig. 4b. Upon laser illumination, the Ids–Vds current increases dramatically compared to dark conditions owing to the outstanding photoresponse behavior of the Si2Te3 crystals. Furthermore, the photo-generated current progressively increased as the laser power intensities increased from 6 to 68 nW. Fig. 4b shows that the generated photocurrent (Iph) was extracted by deducting the Ids obtained in the dark and light (Iph = Ilight − Idark). The Iphversus incident power was plotted in Fig. 4c, in which the photocurrent rises sub-linearly following a power law of Iph ≈ P0.95. Photoresponsivity (Rλ) is one of the essential qualities necessary for photo devices, and is defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power of incident light power and is expressed as Rλ = ΔIλ/(PλS) = [[etα/(hν)]·(τl/τt)], in which ΔIλ is the generated photocurrent, Pλ is the incident light power, S is the illuminated area, α is absorption coefficient, t is the thickness of the channel material at incident photon energy (hν), and τl/τt is the ratio of the lifetime of minority carriers (τl) to the transit time of the majority carriers (τt).39,40 From the above equation, the calculated Rλ of Si2Te3-FET is estimated to be approximately 394 A W−1 at 6 nW as a function of Vds = 10 V and Vg = 0 V, which is greater than the recently reported Si2Te341 photodetector and the other compounds in the chalcogenides, such as Bi2Te3,42 Sb2Te3,43 and the other 2D crystals44–46 (Table S1, ESI†). This high Rλ for Si2Te3-FET can be attributed to the exceptional absorption nature of Si2Te3 in an extensive spectrum range from the near-infrared to the visible region, along with the fast and productive separation of photocarriers in the spatial 2D crystals of the Si2Te3 nanosheets with delayed recombination of the electron–hole, thus allowing a highly proficient photoresponsive conversion.47

(b) The Ids–Vds curve at different laser power intensities (6, 17, 33, and 68 nm). (c) Photocurrent (Iph) plotted as a function of the incident laser power (P) measured at Vds = 10 V and Vg = 0 V. (d) Photo responsivity of the few-layered Si2Te3 photodetector under various laser intensities at a wavelength of 633 nm. 
Furthermore, the Rλ was significantly improved by applying the back gate voltage. Fig. 5a depicts the Ids curve of Si2Te3-FET as a function of various gate voltage ranges from −40 V to 40 V under dark and illuminated conditions. At a wavelength of 633 nm and illumination value of 2 μW, the current at −40 V is almost 2.5 times larger than that in the dark, and the corresponding Iphversus Vg curve is displayed in Fig. S6 of the ESI.† From the photo curve, the Rλ was further estimated under different Vg values (−40 V to 40 V); it reached the maximum responsivity of approximately 1396 A W−1 at 10 V of Vds and −40 V of Vg (Fig. 5b). The mechanism behind this high value of Rλ is illustrated in Fig. 5c. Firstly, the Ids remains higher when the Vg is greater than the threshold voltage (Vth) owing to the Fermi level band shifting upwards. The high measured current under illumination (laser On) generates more electron–hole pairs for the valence-to-conduction band transition. Excessive electrons and holes can be swept towards the source-drain electrodes via the electric field in the channel; this results in a significant photocurrent enhancement. Secondly, the Ids remains low when the Vg is less than the threshold voltage (Vth), owing to the downward shift of the Fermi level band.48 When the laser is switched Off, the Ids is much smaller than when the laser is On owing to the reduced carrier electron and hole pairs being swept between the electrode and the conducting channel during electric field supply. We have also measured the wavelength dependence on responsivity by varying the wavelengths from 900 to 400 nm at a power intensity of approximately 60 nW, Vds = 10 V, and Vg = −40 V. The responsivity was found to increase with the increasing wavelength (Fig. S7 in the ESI†), which is well consistent with the optical absorption results of Si2Te3.

(b) Photo responsivity of the fe-layered Si2Te3 photodetector under various Vg from −0 to +40 V at Vds = 10 V. (c) Energy band diagram at the greatest and lowest threshold voltages in the presence and absence of light illumination. 
Finally, the critical parameters of photodetection, such as the specific detectivity, normalized gain, and response time, were projected. Specific detectivity is typically estimated using the formula D* = (S·Δf)1/2/NEP, in which S and Δf are the active area of the photodetector and the electrical bandwidth, respectively, and NEP denotes the noise equivalent power. The NEP signifies the minimum optical power at which a photodetector can distinguish a signal from noise. The above equation can be represented as D* = RλS1/2/(2eIdark)1/2, in which Rλ, S, e, and Idark are the photoresponsivity at a lower NEP value, effective area, elementary charge, and dark current, respectively.49,50 Based on the above equation, the calculated D* is approximately 2.52 × 1012 Jones at Vg = −40 V and Vds = 10 V (Fig. 6a), which are better than and similar to, respectively, the recently reported 2D materials51–53 (Table S1, ESI†) and almost equal to commercial Si54 and InGaAs photodetectors.55 The normalized gain (Γn) is obtained from the products of η, τ, and μ and is written as Γn =ητμ, in which η is the quantum efficiency, τ is the carrier lifetime, and μ is the carrier mobility.56 The gain (Γ) is defined as the number of photocarriers in circulation between the electrodes before it recombines. Hence, it is denoted as the ratio of the carrier lifetime to the transit time (τt) and is written as:56 Γ = τ/τt = τμV/l2(1)
 Fig. 6  (a) D* of the few-layered Si2Te3 photodetector was investigated as a function of the excitation wavelength at P = 2 μW, Vg = 0 V, and Vds = 10 V. (b) The normalized gain of Si2Te3 was estimated as 2.74 × 10−4 V−1 cm2. Time-resolved photoresponse of the Si2Te3 photodetector (c). The single ON–OFF cycle of illumination at λ = 633 nm and the rising time, estimated as 50 ms. (d) The photoswitching stability of the Si2Te3 photodetector in response to a train of continuous ON–OFF illumination. 
In which, V is the bias voltage, and L is the channel length of the device. Γ has a linear relationship with Rλ and Iph, therefore the Γ can also be estimated using: Γ = (E/e) (R/η) = E/e (Iph/pη)(2)
In which, E is the photon energy, and e is the elementary charge, using eqn (1) and (2), the Γn can be rewritten as Γn = (E/e) (Iph/p) (l2/V), from this relationship, the calculated value of Γn can be obtained as 2.74 × 10−4 V−1 cm2 (Fig. 6b). This value is two orders higher than the monolayer MoS213 and UCNP-graphene photodetectors57 (Table S1, ESI†). The real-time measurements (Ids–t) were performed to evaluate the response speed and the switching stability of the Si2Te3-FET. The Ids–t curve was recorded by illuminating the Si2Te3 device with a 633 nm wavelength. Fig. 6c shows the rapid rise in the current when the light is switched ON and the sudden drop when the light is turned OFF. From this Ids–t curve, the response speed of Si2Te3-FET was found to be approximately 50 ms. The ON–OFF illumination was performed continuously for 300 s (Fig. 6d). The reproducible ON–OFF curve and long-term stability without any degradation during long lasting laser illumination confirm our Si2Te3 photodetector device is robust.
3. Conclusions
A silicon-based chalcogenide class of two-dimensional p-type Si2Te3 single crystals has been successfully grown using the CVT method using iodine as a transporting agent. The Si2Te3 single-crystal reveals the good crystallinity and phase purity and promises excellent optoelectronic properties. The FET device fabricated with few-layered Si2Te3 nanosheets obtained using mechanical exfoliation showed an outstanding performance, with a high photoresponsivity (∼1396 A W−1), large specific detectivity (∼2.52 × 1012 Jones), and a high order of normalized gain (2.74 × 10−4 V−1 cm2). These values are relatively more prominent compared to other 2D single crystals-based FET devices. The p-type semiconducting nature with the exceptional photoresponse of the Si2Te3 single crystals could significantly impact the field of optoelectronics and play a vital role in the integration of p–n junction-based devices for light detection applications.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Mechanical exfoliation and device fabrication
The as-grown Si2Te3 single crystal was exfoliated into few-layered nanosheets using the standard Scotch tape exfoliation process. The exfoliated nanoflakes were moved onto the silicon substrate and coated with a 300 nm thick silicon dioxide dielectric layer. A thin TEM grid was used to construct the source/drain (S/D) electrodes on the edges of the transferred nanosheets. Then, 70 nm of gold (Au) with a 5 nm bonding layer of chromium was deposited using a thermal evaporator under 10−6 Torr vacuum conditions. After device fabrication, post-annealing at 200 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere was carried out for 1 h.
4.2. Characterizations
XRD analyses were carried out using a Bruker D2 PHASER (CuKα radiation). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI, Nova 200) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL, JEM-2100F) were used to examine the morphology and crystallinity of the Si2Te3 single crystal. A V-770 UV-Visible/NIR spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorption spectrum of the Si2Te3 single crystals. The Ids–Vds curves were measured using a source meter (Keithley, 2636A), with an optical system including a He–Ne laser, power meter (Ophir, Nova II), and bandpass filters.
