    , Accepted 3rd December 2012First published on 4th December 2012AbstractIn this paper, well-defined and regular-shaped Na3ScF6 nanocrystals (NCs) have been synthesized in high boiling organic solvents 1-octadecene (ODE) and oleic acid (OA), via the thermal decomposition of rare-earth oleate precursors. It is found that highly uniform monoclinic Na3ScF6 NCs with narrow size distribution have been obtained, which can easily be dispersed in cyclohexane solvent to form transparent colloid solutions. Upon 980 laser diode (LD) excitation, the relative up-conversion (UC) emission intensities of different colors in Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ doped Na3ScF6 can be tuned by altering the Yb3+ doping concentration, resulting in the tunable multicolor in a wide range. On the basis of the emission spectra and the plot of luminescence intensity to pump power, the UC mechanisms of the co-doped Na3ScF6 NCs were investigated in detail. Moreover, the UC emission intensities can be significantly improved by coating a layer of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ shell on Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ cores with respect to that of pure Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ core NCs. Furthermore, transparent and UC luminescent NCs/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites with regular dimensions were also fabricated by an in situ polymerization route. Uniform NCs with a wide variation of luminescence colors will show potential applications in diverse fields.
1. Introduction
Recently, up-conversion (UC) phosphors with high photo-stability, high detection sensitivity and reduced instrument cost have become a research hot spot1–9 due to their wide applications in the fields of solid-state lasers,10,11 display technology,12 solar cells,13 optical telecommunications,14 and especially in the biomedical field.15–24 Different from the down-conversion phosphors which emit low energy fluorescence upon excitation by high energy light, up-conversion phosphors can emit a higher energy photon when absorbing two or more lower energy excitation photons through a sequential adsorption and energy transfer process.25 For biomedical applications, the use of lower energy light is associated with several significant advantages such as negligible photodamage to living organisms, weak autofluorescence background and high penetration depths of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation in tissues.26–32 In particular, UC phosphors have much superior optical stability to organic dyes and the used rare-earth elements show remarkably lower toxicity than the semiconductor elements of QDs (50% lethal dosage is approximately a thousand times higher than that of QDs), while the up-conversion fluorescence is much stronger than that of QDs.33,34 These merits endow such phosphors with high promise as bioprobes and in biolabeling.
Among UC hosts, rare-earth fluorides possess some distinct advantages over conventional oxide hosts due to their intrinsic low cutoff phonon energies, which can efficiently decrease non-radiative relaxation, thus leading to high luminescent efficiency and long lifetimes.35,36 Hence, rare-earth based fluorides have been widely employed as hosts for the synthesis of lanthanide-doped UC phosphors. However, different from the extensive reports on the synthesis and applications of Ln (Ln = Y, La–Lu) based MLnF4 (M = Li, Na and K) fluorides with diverse luminescence, shape and dimension,1–9 little attention has been paid on the fabrication of scandium-based fluorides (MxScF3+x) NCs, which have a unique atomic electron configuration and a much smaller ionic radius than those of Ln3+.37,38 Moreover, it is well known that the UC emission efficiency is usually sensitive to the crystal field and the distance between rare-earth ions in the host lattices.39,40 Therefore, the development of synthesis and applications of rare-earth doped MxScF3+x NCs with tunable colors and UC emissions should be highly promising.
Herein, we propose a thermo-decomposition method for the synthesis of highly uniform and well-defined Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped sodium scandium fluoride NCs and systematically investigated the UC emission properties by altering the Yb3+ concentration. Oleic acid (OA) and octadecene (ODE) were chosen as the capping solvent and reaction medium to control the size and dispersity of the as-synthesized NCs. By studying the relative intensities of different colors in Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ doped Na3ScF6 with different Yb3+ concentrations, the required amount of Yb3+ to obtain different intensive light in the Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ doped crystals can be designed. The UC mechanisms in the co-doped Na3ScF6 samples were also studied in detail based on the emission spectra and the plot of luminescence intensity to pump power. Coating of fluoride layer on the surface of as-obtained NCs is employed to improve the UC emission intensities.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Rare-earth (RE) oxides (Sc2O3, Yb2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Ho2O3, 99.99%), sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ethanol, sodium oleate and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were purchased from Sinapharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China) and used as received without further purification. Oleic acid (OA) was obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). 1-Octadecene (ODE) was purchased from Acros Organics. RECl3 (RE = Sc, Yb, Er, Tm and Ho) were prepared by dissolving the corresponding rare-earth oxides in hydrochloric acid at elevated temperature and then evaporating the solvent in vacuum.
2.2. Synthesis of rare-earth oleate complexes
RE oleate complexes were prepared by a modified procedure.41 In a typical procedure for the synthesis of the scandium oleate complex, 20 mmol of scandium chloride (ScCl3) and 60 mmol of sodium oleate were dissolved in a mixed solvent comprised of 40 mL of ethanol, 30 mL of distilled water and 70 mL of hexane. The resulting solution was added into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask with a reflux condenser and then heated to 70 °C and kept at this temperature for 4 h. Then the reaction mixture was transferred into a separatory funnel. The upper organic layer was separated and washed three times using 30 mL of distilled water. After being washed, the scandium oleate complex was produced in a waxy solid form by evaporating off the remaining hexane. Ytterbium oleate, erbium oleate, thulium oleate and holmium oleate complexes were synthesized in the same way.
2.3. Synthesis of Na3ScF6:Yb3+,Ln3+ NCs
The Na3ScF6:Yb3+,Ln3+ NCs were synthesized by a modified process according to our previous work.42 Typically, 1 mmol RE(oleate)3 (Sc3+/Yb3+/Ln3+ = 77/20/3, Ln3+ = Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+) and 0.21 g NaF (5 mmol, F−/RE3+ molar ratio was kept at 5 unless stated otherwise) were first added to the solvent containing 15 mL OA and 15 mL ODE, then degassed under vacuum for 30 min and finally heated rapidly to 280 °C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h under vigorous magnetic stirring in the presence of nitrogen. Subsequently, the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and the NCs were precipitated by the addition of ethanol and isolated via centrifugation.
2.4. Synthesis of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+@Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ core–shell NCs
Briefly, 1 mmol RE(oleate)3 (Sc3+/Yb3+/Ln3+ = 77/20/3, Ln = Er, Tm, Ho) and 0.5 mmol NaF were added to a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask containing 15 mL OA and 15 mL ODE. Thereafter, 0.5 mmol Na3ScF6:Yb3+,Ln3+ NCs in 6 mL cyclohexane was added to the above solution. After the removal of cyclohexane, the solution was cooled to room temperature and degassed in vacuum for 30 min. The solution was then heated to 320 °C under vigorous stirring in N2 flow for 0.5 h and then naturally cooled down to room temperature. The obtained core/shell NCs were precipitated by addition of 15 mL ethanol, collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol several times and finally re-dispersed in cyclohexane. The final product was designated as Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+@Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+.
2.5. Preparation of NCs/PDMS composite materials
Typically, a 10:1:0.5 (vol:vol:vol) mixture of SYLGARD 184 silicone elastomer, the curing agent (Dow Corning Corp.) and a cyclohexane solution containing luminescent NCs (1 wt%) were thoroughly mixed in a glass container and aged overnight before heat treatment at 80 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, a solid monolith of NCs/PDMS composites was obtained. The composites containing different types of NCs are flexible and can be cut into rectangular samples.
2.6. Characterization
X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Rigaku TTR III diffractometer at a scanning rate of 10° min−1 in the 2θ range from 10 to 80°, with graphite monochromated Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. Images were acquired digitally on a Gatan multiple CCD camera. UC emission spectra were obtained using a 980 nm LD Module (K98D08M-30W, China) as the excitation source and detected by a R955 (HAMAMATSU) from 400–900 nm. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
Phase and morphology

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized Na3ScF6:Yb3+,Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm, Ho) and the standard data of monoclinic Na3ScF6 (JCPDS no. 20-1153) for comparison. It can be seen that the peak positions and relative intensities of the three samples match well with the standard monoclinic Na3ScF6. The slight shift to lower 2θ degree should be due to the doped RE ions with higher ionic radius. In addition, no other phases related with the doped rare-earth ions can be detected, demonstrating the successful and uniform doping of Yb3+/Ln3+ ions into the Na3ScF6 host lattices. The lattice parameters (calculated from MDI Jade 5.0) of a = 5.677, b = 5.794, c = 8.13 Å for Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Er3+, a = 5.637, b = 5.803, c = 8.13 Å for Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Tm3+ and a = 5.59, b = 5.782, c = 8.15 Å for Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ho3+ are close to their corresponding standard data, confirming the phase purity of the samples. Moreover, the broad diffraction peaks reveals the nanosized nature of as-synthesized NCs, which was used to calculate the average crystallite sizes by the Scherrer formula, D = 0.89λ/βcos θ, where D is the average grain size, λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15405 nm) and θ and β are the diffraction angle and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), respectively. The corresponding average crystallite sizes are calculated to be 26.9, 23.2 and 18.7 nm, respectively, for Ln = Er, Tm, Ho. Compositional analysis of the NCs using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the presence of Na, Sc, F, Yb and Er elements in the Na3ScF6:Yb3+,Er3+ NCs (Fig. 2) and the atomic ratio of Na/Sc/F/Yb/Er is determined to be 2.93/0.78/6.02/0.19/0.03, which is close to the theoretical atomic ratio (3/0.77/6/0.2/0.03). Similarly, Na, Sc, F, Yb and Tm (Ho) are also detected and the corresponding atomic ratios are essentially identical to the theoretical ratios in Na3ScF6:Yb3+,Tm3+ (Ho3+) NCs.

TEM images of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Er3+, Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Tm3+ and Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ho3+ NCs are shown in Fig. 3A, D and G, respectively. It can be seen that all the samples consist of uniform cubic nanoplates with good dispersity and narrow size distribution. The respective mean diameter is determined to be 28 nm for Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Er3+ (Fig. 3B), 24 nm for Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Tm3+ (Fig. 2E) and 19 nm for Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ho3+ (Fig. 3H), which are well consistent with the average sizes calculated from XRD patterns. The HRTEM image shows that these NCs have well-defined shapes and highly crystalline nature. In Fig. 3C, F and I for Na3ScF6:Yb3+:Ln3+ (Er, Tm and Ho), the distance between the adjacent lattice fringes is determined to be 0.29 nm, agreeing well with the d112 spacing of monoclinic Na3ScF6. This is also supported by the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 3C, F and I), which shows the diffraction spots of the (112) planes of Na3ScF6 and reveals the single-crystalline nature of the sample.

UC luminescence properties
Recently, rare-earth (RE) fluorides (NaREF4 or REF3) have been extensively employed as host lattices for various optical lanthanide ions (Eu3+, Tb3+, Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+) to generate DC and UC luminescence.1–9,43–46 Nevertheless, investigations on the UC luminescence properties of scandium fluorides are rarely reported, especially multicolor emission generation from Yb3+/Ln3+ co-doped Na3ScF6 with different Yb3+ ion concentrations has not been studied so far. Here we discuss the UC luminescence properties of Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped Na3ScF6 NCs. By adjusting the Yb3+ concentration, we can precisely manipulate the relative emission intensities of different emission colors.
It is well known that, when sensitized by Yb3+, Er3+ can emit intensive UC light in the green and red wavelength range under NIR LD light. Fig. 4A shows the UC emission spectra of Na3ScF6:x%Yb3+,3%Er3+ with Yb3+ concentrations of 10–30%. Obviously, all the Na3ScF6:Yb3+,Er3+ samples emit the characteristic Er3+ transitions centered at 521 (2H11/2 → 4I15/2), 541 (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and 655 (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) nm.47–53 It can also be observed that the increasing rate of the red emissions is larger than the green emissions, leading to a rise of the red-to-green intensity ratio, which is depicted in Fig. 4B. As shown, the peak area ratio of the red region (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) to the green region (2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) increases from 1.42 to 2.8 with the increase of Yb3+ concentration. The corresponding UC luminescence photographs under 980 nm LD irradiation are shown in Fig. 4C. It is apparent that the output colors change from yellow–green (10%) to bright yellow (30%), which can be ascribed to the different intensities of the green and red emission bands in the four samples. The change of output colors can be due to fewer Er3+ ions at the green-emitting levels of 2H11/2/4S3/2 with more Er3+ ions at the red-emitting level of 4F9/2. When more Yb3+ ions are doped into the Na3ScF6 host, the energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ leads to the saturation of the 4I13/2 (Er3+) state and then the excited Yb3+ ions transfer their energy to Er3+ ions through the energy-transfer process 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I13/2 (Er3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 4F9/2 (Er3+), which can directly populate the 4F9/2 level, resulting in the enhancement of red emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2). In order to deeply study the involved UC mechanism in Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Er3+, the excitation power-dependent UC green and red emissions were studied. It is well known that the output UC luminescent intensity (IUC) is proportional to the infrared excitation power (IIR) as IUC ∝ IIRn, where n is the absorbed photon numbers per emitted visible photon and its value is obtained from the slope of the fitted line of the plot of log(IUC) vs. log(IIR). As shown in Fig. 4D, the slopes of the linear fits of log(IUC) vs. log(IIR) for the green and red emissions in Na3ScF6:20Yb3+,3%Er3+ sample are 1.52 and 1.94, respectively. The results indicate that two photons are involved to produce the green and red UC emissions, which is well consistent with the previous reports of other Yb3+/Er3+ doped fluorides. On the basis of the result, the proposed UC energy transfer process in Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Er3+ under 980 nm LD excitation is depicted in Fig. 4E. We can see that the green and red emissions all require a two-photon process to populate the 2H11/2/4S3/2 or 4F9/2 level.

(The black solid arrows, straight and curly dotted arrows and the colored solid arrows represent the excitation, the non-radiative decay and energy transfer and the up-converted radiative emission process, respectively.) 
The UC luminescence properties of Yb3+/Tm3+ or Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped Na3ScF6 with different Yb3+ concentration were also investigated, as shown in Fig. 5. From the UC emission spectra of Na3ScF6:x%Yb3+,3%Tm3+ (x = 10, 15, 20 and 30), we can see two strong blue emission bands centered at 452 and 480 nm and one weak red emission band at 649 nm (Fig. 5A), which can correspondingly be assigned to the 1D2 → 3F4, 1G4 → 3H6 and 1G4 → 3F4 transitions of Tm3+ ions,54–56 respectively. The red 1G4 → 3F4 emission is very weak compared to the blue emission which may be due to the concentration quenching effect.57 Thus, the changing tendency for the red emission with the increase of Yb3+ concentration is not obvious. However, it should be noted that the blue 1D2 → 3F4 emission in the Er3+/Tm3+ doped Na3ScF6 is quite clear and strong compared to that in other systems, which may result in the enhanced blue emission of our Na3ScF6:Yb3+,Tm3+ samples. Fig. 5B shows the UC luminescence spectra of Na3ScF6:x%Yb3+,3%Ho3+ (x = 10, 15, 20 and 30). As shown, a strong broad emission band centered at around 538 nm and a relatively weak emission band at 648 nm can be observed, which can be associated with the 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+ ions. Different from Na3ScF6:x%Yb3+,3%Er3+ NCs, the relative peak area ratios in the two systems do not change obviously when adjusting the Yb3+ concentration. The corresponding photographs of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Tm3+ and Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ho3+ NCs under 980 nm LD excitation are shown in Fig. 4C, from which we can see that the output colors of the Na3ScF6:x%Yb3+,3%Tm3+ NCs also exhibit little change (Fig. 5C, top). As for the Na3ScF6:x%Yb3+,3%Ho3+ NCs in Fig. 5C (bottom), the output color for the four samples gradually changes from green to yellow–green. In Fig. 5D, the peak area ratio of the blue-to-red region in Na3ScF6:x%Yb3+,3%Tm3+ is increased from 5.8 to 6.7, while the green-to-red region increases from 1.6 to 2.3 in Na3ScF6:x%Yb3+,3%Ho3+ with the increase of Yb3+ concentration. The pump power dependence of the blue, green and red up-converted emissions in Na3ScF6:20%Yb3+,3%Tm3+ and Na3ScF6:20%Yb3+,3%Ho3+ NCs under 980 nm LD excitation are shown in Fig. 5E. As shown, the respective slope of the linear fits for the blue and red emissions in Na3ScF6:20Yb3+,3%Tm3+ sample are 2.96 and 1.98, indicating three and two photons are involved in the energy transition and the slopes for the green and red emissions in Na3ScF6:20%Yb3+/3%Ho3+ are 1.96 and 1.73, suggesting a two-photon process. The proposed UC mechanism in the Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ doped Na3ScF6 is presented in Fig. 5F. Obviously, the blue and red emissions in Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Tm3+ require three and two photons, respectively, while the green and red emissions in Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ho3+ all involve a two-photon energy transfer process. Based on the above analysis, we can see that the UC photoluminescence color of Na3ScF6:Yb/Er, Na3ScF6:Yb/Tm and Na3ScF6:Yb/Ho can be tuned from green–yellow to yellow, from blue to purple and from green to yellow by simply adjusting the relative doping concentrations of the Yb3+ ions. The results can be confirmed by the corresponding CIE chromaticity diagram (Fig. 6), deriving from the corresponding CIE chromaticity coordinates (x, y) (Table 1). This result indicates that the as-obtained NCs show merits of multicolor emissions in the visible region when excited with 980 nm LD excitation, which might find potential applications in diverse fields.

Because of the small particle size and good dispersibility in non-polar solvents, Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ NCs can be well dispersed in PDMS monoliths to form solid and transparent composites. Photographs of PDMS samples containing Na3ScF6:Yb/Er, Na3ScF6:Yb/Tm and Na3ScF6:Yb/Ho NCs under daylight and 980 nm NIR irradiation in the dark are shown in Fig. 7. We can see that all the samples are transparent under daylight and exhibit obvious apparently green–yellow, blue and green luminescence under 980 nm NIR irradiation, suggesting the good dispersion of NCs in PDMS monoliths. The results reveal that the as-obtained UC luminescent NCs can be made into transparent solid luminescent materials by dispersing of NCs into a monolayer, which may thus show potential applications in antiforgery technology.

Core–shell structured NCs

Fig. 8 shows TEM images and the UC emission spectra of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ and Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+@Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm and Ho) under 980 LD excitation, respectively. It is observed that the core–shell NCs basically maintain the core shape with good dispersion and a slight increase of particle size, which may be caused by the coating layers. Notably, the coating of a fluoride layer on the surface of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ cores can significantly enhance the PL intensity. The integrated emission intensity of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Er3+@Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Er3+ is increased by about 4.3 times than that of pure Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Er3+ NCs. For Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Tm3+@Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Tm3+, the corresponding increase is about 1.9 times, while the emission intensity of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ho3+@Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ho3+ is increased by almost 9 times. Different from the enhanced emission arising from the elimination of non-radiative centers on the crystal surface by the shielding effect of the fluoride shell without dopants,51,58–60 the increased intensities of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+@Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ crystals should be due to the increased ratio of volume to surface area by making the crystal larger.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, well-defined and regular-shaped Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm and Ho) NCs were successfully synthesized via the thermo-decomposition of corresponding lanthanide oleate precursors at high temperature for the first time. The UC luminescence properties of lanthanide-ion doped Na3ScF6 NCs were well studied under 980 nm LD excitation. The emission colors can be precisely tuned in a wide range by simply adjusting the Yb3+ doping concentration. More importantly, the coating a fluoride layer on the surface of Na3ScF6:Yb3+/Ln3+ NCs can significantly enhance the PL luminescent intensity due to the increase of volume to surface ratio by making the crystal larger. This study provided a general route for the development of highly efficient luminescent UC phosphors in a broad color range, which may show potential in biomedical and display applications. Furthermore, coating of protective layers to enhance the UC luminescence intensities also paves an effective way to obtain highly bright UC emissions.
