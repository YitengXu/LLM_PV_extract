    , Accepted 4th January 2023First published on 5th January 2023AbstractTwo small molecule (SM) donors, named CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR, have been constructed by introducing selenophenes and chlorine atoms simultaneously into the conventional benzodithiophene–terthiophene–rhodanine architecture. In comparison with the non-chlorinated and thiophene based counterpart, the new SM donors exhibit a red-shifted absorption band, lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, stronger intermolecular packing and higher molecular crystallinity. When combined with non-fullerene molecule FO-2Cl, the optimized all-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) based on CBTSeEHR give a moderate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.30%. Notably, CBTSeHR based devices achieve an outstanding performance of 12.10% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.881 V, short-circuit current densities (Jsc) of 18.76 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.732, benefiting from the deep HOMO level, good light-harvesting ability and favorable morphology in the active layer. These findings provide an effective strategy to develop the medium band-gap SM donors for high-performance ASM-OSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn great attention owing to their excellent advantages of flexibility, being lightweight, low cost and achieving large-area fabrication, etc.1–8 In recent years, OSCs have made tremendous progress, with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19% for single-junction devices and 20% for tandem devices,9–14 as a result of the continuous exploration of photoactive materials and device optimization. To be precise, the highest performances have mainly been achieved for the polymer based OSCs due to the interpenetrating network and favorable domain sizes in the active layer, as a benefit of the long conjugated backbone and efficient pre-aggregation of the polymer.15–21 By contrast, all-small-molecule OSCs (ASM-OSCs) exhibit lower efficiencies than those of their polymer counterparts.22–30 In view of the outstanding advantages of small molecule (SM) materials, such as easy purification, well-defined chemical structures and less batch-to-batch variation, ASM-OSCs have shown great potential for commercialization.31–34 Along with the emergence of excellent non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, the performance ASM-OSCs has been enhanced significantly. Recently, high PCEs over 17% were achieved, showing the bright prospects of ASM-OSCs.35–37 Nevertheless, compared with high-performance NFAs,38 the development of SM donors still lags behind, which restricts performance improvements for ASM-OSCs. Among the varieties of SM donors reported previously, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type molecules, such as oligothiophene or benzodithiophene (BDT) based donors, have shown great success in ASM-OSCs.39–44 In particular, the BDT unit has been widely used as the central building block in the development of various SM donors, owing to its excellent charge transfer properties and easy modification. For example, BTR, a well-known SM donor with thiophene-substituted BDT as the central unit, as developed by Jones et al.,45 shows high PCEs exceeding 11% for BTR:Y6 based devices.46,47 By replacing the thiophene substituent of BTR with alkylthiobenzene, the SM donor B1 exhibits superior efficiencies of over 14% when combined with Y-series NFAs.48,49 However, these devices generally yield low open-circuit voltage (Voc) values owing to the higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the SM donors. It has been demonstrated that the introduction of halogen atoms onto the BDT unit can downshift the HOMO energy level effectively, thus contributing to a high Voc for the ASM-OSC device. Meanwhile, the halogen atom has a significant impact on the molecular crystalline properties, which could modulate the morphology in the active layer.50–53 A series of SM donors based on halogenated BDT, including BTR-Cl,28 BSFTR,40 and so on, have been developed and used in ASM-OSC devices, which show efficient photovoltaic performances.
Very recently, we reported a chlorinated SM donor, BTEHR-CT (Fig. 1a),54 which exhibits a lower HOMO level of −5.56 eV compared with the non-chlorinated donor DR3TBDTT (−5.02 eV) as shown in Fig. 1b,55 leading to a high Voc of 0.946 V when blended with the NFA F-2Cl. However, the narrow light absorption range of 300–670 nm is unfavorable for light harvesting and the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is enhanced when blended with narrow band-gap NFAs. To cover such shortcomings, in this work, we designed and synthesized two chlorinated and selenophene-containing BDT based SM donors, namely CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR (Fig. 1a), taking alkylrhodanine as the terminal groups. Compared with the thiophene based analogue (BTEHR-CT), the introduction of the selenophene endows the new SM donors with a broader and red-shifted absorption band, improving the light-harvesting ability. In addition, the new SM donors exhibit deep HOMO levels and enhance the molecular packing and crystallinity due to the existence of the chlorine atoms on the BDT unit. When blended with the NFA molecule FO-2Cl, the optimized ASM-OSC device based on CBTSeEHR gives a moderate PCE of 9.30%. Notably, the optimal CBTSeHR based device achieves an outstanding performance of 12.10% with a high Voc of 0.881 V, a Jsc of 18.76 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.732, demonstrating an effective means of achieving high-efficiency ASM-OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
The SM donors, CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR, were prepared via Stille coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reaction according to the synthetic route illustrated in Scheme S1 (ESI†), and the detailed procedures are presented in the ESI.† The chemical structures of the intermediates and final products were fully characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass or high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR have good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, etc., which is beneficial for the preparation of solution processed OSCs. In addition, the structural ordering in SM neat films was investigated using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) and 1D line-cuts taken along the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions. As shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), both SM neat films exhibit a preferred edge-on oriented π–π stacking from the strong (100) diffraction peaks at ∼0.30 Å−1 in the OOP direction and the (010) diffraction peaks at ∼1.75 Å−1 in the IP direction. From Fig. S1b (ESI†), the π–π stacking distances of 3.55 and 3.71 Å for CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR, respectively, could be estimated, indicating the stronger intermolecular packing in the CBTSeHR neat film. Furthermore, the crystalline correlation length (CCL) values for π–π (010) stacking in the IP direction could be calculated on basis of the Scherrer equation: CCL = 2πK/FWHM, where K is the shape factor (K = 0.9). The CCL value for CBTSeHR was estimated as 54.9 Å, which is larger than that of CBTSeEHR (50.5 Å), demonstrating the higher molecular crystallinity and more ordered stacking in the CBTSeHR solid film.
2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two SM donors in both dilute solutions and thin films were measured to investigate the optical properties. From the Fig. 1c, it was seen that both SM donors display almost overlapping absorption, ranging from 300 to 640 nm in chloroform solution. In the solid film, by contrast, a broadened absorption with maximum absorption peaks (λmax) at ∼580 nm could be observed, which are red-shifted by ∼22 nm in comparison with that of the thiophene based analogue BTEHR-CT, indicating the good light-harvesting ability of the new donors. The optical band-gap (Eoptg) estimated from the absorption onset of the CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR films is 1.76 and 1.78 eV, respectively. In addition, a stronger shoulder peak at 631 nm for the CBTSeHR film suggests the stronger intermolecular interaction and the higher crystallinity of CBTSeHR compared with CBTSeEHR, as proven by the results of 2D GIWAXS experiments. The electrochemical behavior of the new molecules was investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments. The reduction and oxidation potentials estimated on the basis of the CV curves in Fig. S2 (ESI†) are, respectively, −1.18 V and 0.67 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) for CBTSeHR, and −1.19 V and 0.65 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) for CBTSeEHR. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the HOMO energy levels were calculated, as shown in Fig. 1b, according to the equation ELUMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetre) and EHOMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetox). The deep HOMO levels, resulting from the electron-withdrawing group on the BDT unit, could enable ASM-OSCs based on the two SM donors to gain high Voc values when blended with suitable NFA materials. The detailed optical and electrochemical parameters of CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR are listed in Table 1.

2.3 Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the selenophene based SM donors, ASM-OSC devices with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al were fabricated. The active layer was spin-coated from a chloroform solution of mixed materials in which FO-2Cl was chosen as the electron acceptor in consideration of the matched energy levels, good complementary absorption and, in particular, its excellent performance reported previously. As seen in Fig. 2a, the as-cast devices exhibited a poor performance with low PCEs of ∼2% for both SM donors in spite of the high Voc of ∼0.93 V. After optimization using thermal annealing (TA) treatment, however, the photovoltaic performance increased sharply. Notably, with a TA treatment of 140 °C for 5 min and with a donor/acceptor weight ratio (D/A, w/w) of 1:1.2, the optimal ASM-OSC device based on CBTSeHR achieves an outstanding PCE of 12.10% with enhanced photovoltaic parameters for Jsc (18.76 mA cm−2) and FF (0.732). Nevertheless, a D/A ratio of 1:1.1 and a slightly lower TA temperature of 135 °C are more favorable for the CBTSeEHR based device, which shows a moderate PCE of 9.30%. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the ASM-OSC devices are shown in Fig. 2a, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2 and Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). As shown in Table 2, the devices based on the thiophene counterpart (BTEHR-CT) exhibited a champion PCE of 11.13% using F-2Cl as the electron acceptor in our previous work.54 However, the optimal BTEHR-CT:FO-2Cl based device gives a lower PCE of 10.84%, mainly due to the decreased Voc and FF (Fig. S3, ESI†). By contrast, CBTSeHR demonstrates the advantage of improving the photovoltaic performance, which indicates that the introduction of selenophene and the modulated molecular crystallinity via the length of the side chain is an effective strategy for the design of high-efficiency SM donors.

The Jsc values of the two new SM donors based devices exhibit a large gap, which is consistent with the results of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra as illustrated in Fig. 2b. The optimized CBTSeHR based ASM-OSC shows stronger photo-to-current responses than that of the CBTSeEHR device in the range of 400–800 nm and with a maximum EQE value of 73.3% at 550 nm, indicating more efficient exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection in the CBTSeHR:FO-2Cl blends. From integration of the EQE curves, the Jsc values for the optimized CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR devices are calculated as 18.37 and 14.97 mA cm−2, respectively, which show a small mismatch of about 2% with the Jsc values derived from the J–V curves.
2.4 Exciton generation, dissociation and recombination
To further explore the exciton dissociation and extraction process in the blend films of the optimized devices, the photocurrent (Jph, where Jph = JL − JD) versus the effective applied voltage (Veff, where Veff = V0 − Va) was measured, where JL, JD, V0 and Va are the light current density, the dark current density, the voltage at Jph = 0 and the applied voltage, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2c, the higher saturation current density (Jsat) for the CBTSeHR based device demonstrates the more efficient photon harvesting and exciton dissociation. In addition, the Jph/Jsat values could be calculated as 94.2% and 76.7% under the short-circuit and maximal output power conditions, respectively, for the optimized CBTSeHR based device, and as 91.1% and 70.8% for CBTSeEHR counterpart, which reveals more efficient exciton generation, dissociation and charge extraction in the CBTSeHR:FO-2Cl film, thus contributing to the enhancement of the Jsc and FF data. Moreover, the charge recombination properties were investigated using the formula of Jsc ∝ Pα, where P refers to the light intensity and α is the exponential factor. The fitted slopes (α) in Fig. 2d are calculated to be 0.973 and 0.950 for the CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR based devices, respectively, suggesting less bimolecular recombination in the active layer of CBTSeHR:FO-2Cl.
To further investigate the charge recombination and transport properties in the active layer, the electron and hole mobilities (μe and μh, respectively) were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. As depicted in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the electron and hole mobilities for the CBTSeEHR based device were estimated as μe = 1.83 × 10−4 V−1 s−1 and μh = 1.01 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 with a μe/μh ratio of 1.81. By contrast, for the CBTSeHR counterpart, the μe and μh values increased to 2.90 × 10−4 V−1 s−1 and 3.64 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the μe/μh ratio decreased to 1.26. The enhanced and more balanced charge transport contributes to less charge recombination in the CBTSeHR:FO-2Cl blend, which facilitates obtaining the higher Jsc and FF values as discussed above.
2.5 Morphology characterization
The morphologies of the blend films were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. From Fig. 3c, it can be observed that the topographical image of the optimized CBTSeEHR:FO-2Cl film displays a smooth morphology with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.21 nm. By contrast, the CBTSeHR based film shows a rougher surface morphology with RMS = 1.69 nm, revealing the improved intermolecular interaction and aggregation in the CBTSeHR:FO-2Cl blend, which is consistent with the morphology features in the TEM image as shown in Fig. 3b. Evidently, the CBTSeHR based blend exhibits a clear phase separation morphology and fiber-like structures, which contribute to the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, and thus the enhancement of Jsc and FF. As for the CBTSeEHR counterpart, there is no clear nanofiber-like interpenetrating network or defined domains, which could lead to the inferior photovoltaic performance as discussed previously.

Furthermore, the molecular packing in the blend films was studied using 2D GIWAXS technology. As displayed in Fig. 4a, the 2D GIWAXS pattern of CBTSeHR:FO-2Cl shows both edge-on and face-on oriented molecular packing, suggesting that the parallel and vertical charge transport channels exist simultaneously. This phenomenon is also reflected in the line-cut profiles along the IP and OOP directions in Fig. 4c, which are beneficial for more favorable charge transfer in the active layer, thus achieving high Jsc values for the ASM-OSC devices.56,57 Nevertheless, there is no clear (010) diffraction peak in the 2D GIWAXS pattern or line-cut profile for the CBTSeEHR:FO-2Cl film, revealing the poor molecular ordering, which is adverse for exciton dissociation and charge transport inside the blend. In general, the more favorable morphology and molecular packing in the optimized CBTSeHR:FO-2Cl blend enable the ASM-OSC devices to achieve an excellent performance.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we developed two new chlorinated and selenophene-containing BDT based SM donors (CBTSeHR and CBTSeEHR), with alkylrhodanine as the end groups. In comparison with the thiophene counterpart, both SM donors exhibit red-shifted and broadened absorption, demonstrating their good light-harvesting ability. Moreover, the incorporation of chlorine atoms endows the two SM donors with low-lying HOMO energy levels. Neat films of the SM donors exhibit a preferred edge-on oriented π–π stacking, and CBTSeHR displays stronger intermolecular packing and a higher molecular crystallinity than CBTSeEHR. When blended with the NFA molecule FO-2Cl, the optimized ASM-OSC device based on CBTSeEHR gives a moderate PCE of 9.30%. In striking contrast, the optimal CBTSeHR based device achieves an outstanding performance of 12.10% with a high Voc of 0.881 V, a Jsc of 18.76 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.732, benefiting from the deep HOMO levels, favorable morphology and ordered molecular packing in the active layer. In general, these findings provide an effective strategy for the design of SM donors with a red-shifted and broadened absorption that contributes to capturing light when blended with narrow band-gap NFA molecules, thus obtaining an efficient photovoltaic performance.
