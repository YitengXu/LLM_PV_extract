, Accepted 16th September 2014First published on 16th September 2014AbstractA microwave-assisted method was developed to synthesize novel single-crystalline CuClSe2 microribbons (MRs) in high yield. Their phase transformation and stability to thermal irradiation were systematically studied. The single CuClSe2 MR-based device showed a favorable photosensitivity and long-term environmental stability. This implies good prospects for CuClSe2 MRs in low-cost and high-performance photodetectors for practical use.
Ternary Cu-VII–VI semiconductors, copper halogen selenides, show great promise as active absorbers in photovoltaic devices and photodetectors.1,2 Compared with traditional semiconductors (e.g., GaAs, CdTe) and quaternary copper chalcogenides (e.g., CuInxGa1−xSe2, Cu2ZnSnS4),3–5 copper halogen selenides have the advantages of low-cost, high-efficiency, and easy preparation, which meet well with the current requirement for active materials for the development of solar cells. As one type of copper halogen selenides, CuClSe2 (copper chloride selenide), has been certified as a potential alternative with large absorption coefficients used as absorber layer.1 To date, CuClSe2 has been prepared by various methods, such as hydrothermal, chemical transport and solid-state reaction.6,7 Despite these efforts, the synthesis of well-defined CuClSe2 micro/nanostructures has been largely overlooked. On the other hand, except the thermal and optical properties of CuClSe2 thin film,1 the physicochemical properties of CuClSe2 micro/nanostructures especially the photo-response property have been not investigated yet. Therefore, the preliminary explorations of CuClSe2 micro/nanostructures are extremely valuable for their practical application in the future.
Herein, we report on a high-yield synthesis of novel single-crystalline CuClSe2 microribbons (MRs) via a facile microwave-assisted method. The CuClSe2 MRs were fully investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Moreover, the CuClSe2 MRs underwent a phase transformation at selected temperature, that is, thermally-decomposing into CuO in air and Cu2O in N2. The prototype device based on a single CuClSe2 MR displayed a favorable response to visible light and long-term environmental stability. This indicates a brightening prospect of CuClSe2 MRs in light detection and signal magnification for the development of low-cost and high-performance photodetectors.
In a typical process, 5 mL benzyl alcohol (analytical reagent), 8.8 mg selenium dioxide (SeO2, spectroscopic reagent), and 17 mg copper chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O, analytical reagent) were mixed in a 10 mL microwave vial and capped. The mixture solution was magnetically stirred at room temperature overnight, and the vial was transferred into the microwave system (2.45 GHz, 300 W, Discover S-Class, CEM) and heated at 160 °C for 30 min. When the reaction was completed, the suspension changed color from pale-green to reddish-brown, implying the formation of CuClSe2 MRs. The final products were centrifuged and washed with excess ethanol. For further characterization, the as-prepared CuClSe2 MRs were re-dispersed in ethanol. Fig. 1 shows an XRD pattern of the as-prepared CuClSe2 MRs, where all the peaks can be well indexed to the monoclinic phase of CuClSe2 (a = 7.735 Å; b = 4.665 Å; c = 30.89 Å; JCPDS no. 23-0202). Moreover, the intensity of (006) peak is much stronger than that of (−301) peak compared with that from JCPDS, indicating that the as-prepared CuClSe2 MRs has a preferential orientation perpendicular to the (006) plane. This is in good agreement with the intrinsic crystal feature of CuClSe2 as the larger lattice parameter (30.89 Å) can lead to the slow crystal growth along the c axis due to weak interaction between the (001) planes.

Fig. 2a shows a typical SEM image of the as-prepared CuClSe2 MRs, most of which exhibit a ribbon-like morphology and some MRs are cross-linked to form the clusters. The average width of CuClSe2 MRs ranges from several to tens of micrometers and the length is up to hundreds of micrometers. The TEM images in Fig. 2b–c reveal that the large-sized MRs have a distinct curly fringe and wrinkled surfaces throughout the entire length. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Fig. 2d) and corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern acquired from a single MR (inset in Fig. 2d) indicate that the CuClSe2 MRs are single crystals with the [010] growth direction. The interplanar d-spacings of 0.464 nm and 0.24 nm correspond to the (010) and (2010) planes of monoclinic CuClSe2 phase, respectively. Besides, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS, Fig. S1, ESI†) and mapping analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†) of an individual MR confirm the existence of three elements of Cu, Cl and Se, which have an intrinsic 1:1:2 stoichiometry and are evenly distributed along the microribbon, revealing the homogeneous purity of the as-prepared CuClSe2 MRs.

To explore the optical properties of CuClSe2 MRs, the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded. The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3a) of CuClSe2 MR film shows a wide absorption band in visible region. Besides, the fluorescence spectrum (Fig. 3b) of CuClSe2 MRs exhibits two emission peaks at 550 and 645 nm under the excitation of 435 nm. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) has been employed to investigate the band gap of as-prepared CuClSe2 MRs, which is an important physical parameter for semiconductor nanomaterials and their potential application. As shown in Fig. 3c, the onset of absorption for CuClSe2 MRs starts near 840 nm. By applying Kubelka–Munk transformation,8,9 a plot of [F(R)hν]1/2 versus energy yields an indirect band gap of 1.4 eV while a plot of [F(R)hν]2 versus energy yields a direct band gap of 1.75 eV (Fig. 3d). Obviously, as an indirect bandgap semiconductor, the experimental band gap for CuClSe2 MRs is close to the ideal energy band gap (1.5 eV) of the materials for photovoltaic conversion, indicating its potential application in photo-electric devices.

Furthermore, the phase transformation of CuClSe2 MRs was investigated by the XRD patterns and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S3a,† the TGA curve underwent an obvious weight loss above 250 °C, revealing the inferior thermal stability of CuClSe2. The large mass decrease mainly resulted from the decomposition of CuClSe2 MRs and the volatilization of Se at selected temperature.1 According to the XRD pattern in Fig. S3b–c,† original CuClSe2 MRs were thermally-decomposed into CuO in air and Cu2O in N2, which was likely due to different degrees of oxidation at higher temperature.
The photoresponse characteristics of CuClSe2 MRs were investigated by fabricating an individual CuClSe2 MR-based photodetector. Fig. 4a shows a schematic diagram of CuClSe2 MR resting across the interdigital Au electrodes under light illumination. The interdigitated Au electrodes with 4 fingers (finger dimensions: width 20 μm, length 200 μm, interfinger spacing 20 μm) were fabricated on SiO2/Si substrates by lithography. Current–voltage characteristics of devices were recorded with Keithley 4200 SCS and SUSS PM8 probe station in a clean and shielded box at room temperature. A Xenon lamp was used as the white light source for the photocurrent measurements. As expected, the device based on individual CuClSe2 MR exhibited favorable photoresponse characteristics as shown in Fig. 4b. The current light intensity was 5.5 mW cm−2 and the applied voltage is +10 V. With the light irradiation on and off, the current dramatically increased by ∼6 times, from 2.5 pA (OFF state, dark condition) to 15 pA (ON state, light illumination). The higher switching “ON/OFF” ratio could reach up to more than 10 while the light intensity was 14.4 mW cm−2 and the applied voltage was fixed (Fig. S4, ESI†). Note that all the photocurrents under different light densities were not stable and gradually increased with cycling, which was likely due to the fact that a large number of grain boundaries and various traps inside single MR.10,11 Further, the high photosensitivity of the device based on individual CuClSe2 MR was further confirmed by photocurrent measurements at different incident light densities. As the intensity of incident light increased, the photocurrent remarkably raised accordingly (Fig. 4c), which can be attributed to the change in photo-generated carriers at different incident light densities. It was clearly observed that the current of the present photodetector exhibited a strong linear dependence on light intensity (Fig. 4d), demonstrating that the single CuClSe2 MR based photodetector worked under the photoconductive effect.12 Meanwhile, the response and the recovery times can usually be examined to evaluate the speed of ON/OFF switching processes, which are defined as the time of beginning from turning on the light (t = 0 s) to reach the 90% values of the maximum current and recover to the 10% values of the maximum current, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, 0.5 s of the response and 2 s of the recovery times can be obtained, and the response and the recovery time remained the same for 10 cycles, ensuring the favorable photosensitivity and photoresponse stability of the current photodetector. It was also noted that the fitting of decay edge required two straight lines of different slopes while the rising edge was fitted by one straight line, and the slow decay of the photocurrent after switching off the light also suggested a typical trap releasing current.13

In view of practical application, the environmental stability of the photodetectors should also be highly valued. Fig. 5 shows the typical I–V and photoresponse curve of the same CuClSe2 MR-based device stored for 30 days at ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. 5a, the typical I–V curves at different light densities were almost the same as the original one after 30 days, and the almost same photoresponse performance also revealed excellent and long-term environmental stability of current photodetector (Fig. 5b). Therefore, the favorable photoresponse performance and excellent environmental stability demonstrate the ability of single CuClSe2 MR-based device in light detection and signal magnification for the development of photoelectric integration with low cost and high performance.

More importantly, the current synthetic method is applicable to other copper halogen selenides. When the precursor CuCl2·2H2O was replaced with CuBr2, novel micro/nanostructures of copper bromine selenide can be successfully prepared. As shown in Fig. S6,† the copper bromine selenides have the same large-sized and ribbon-like morphology as CuClSe2, and the corresponding HR-TEM and FFT images confirm that the microribbons are also single-crystalline.
In summary, single-crystalline CuClSe2 MRs were synthesized in high yield by a facile microwave-assisted method. The phase transition of CuClSe2 MRs at selected temperatures (>250 °C) revealed their inferior stability to thermal radiation. Moreover, the photoresponse characteristics of CuClSe2 MRs are investigated and the single CuClSe2 MR-based device displays a favorable photosensitivity to light intensity and long-term environmental stability, indicating that CuClSe2 MRs are promising candidates for low-cost and high-performance photodetectors. Besides, the current method is also applicable to the synthesis of other copper halogen selenides.
