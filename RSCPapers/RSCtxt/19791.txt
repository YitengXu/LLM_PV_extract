    , Accepted 28th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractThis article reports the synthesis of two polymers of donor–acceptor1–donor–acceptor2 (D–A1–D–A2) architecture employing the direct heteroarylation poly-condensation reaction. Both the first polymer (PAQTDPP) and the second polymer (PAQBTDPP) comprise anthraquinone (AQ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the acceptor1 and acceptor2 components. In contrast, where PAQTDPP incorporates thiophene as the donor, PAQBTDPP incorporates the bithiophene moiety as the donor. Later, two n–n inorganic/organic nano-heterostructures (NHs)—N-TiO2/PAQTDPP and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP—were fabricated using nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanorods (N-TiO2 NRs) and PAQTDPP and PAQBTDPP polymers on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate. The N-TiO2/PAQTDPP and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH materials were utilized as the photoanodes for visible light photoelectrochemical water splitting. At 1.23 VRHE, the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.157 mA cm−2, 0.504 mA cm−2, and 0.397 mA cm−2 (@10 mV s−1), respectively, in a 0.5 M aq. Na2SO4 electrolyte. The inorganic/organic nano-hybrid photoanodes also exhibited cathodically shifted water oxidation onset potential compared to the N-TiO2 NR electrode. The augmented photoelectrochemical performances of the inorganic/organic nano-hybrid materials are attributable to the absorption capability of a broader spectrum of visible light by the polymers, suitable band alignment between the inorganic and organic components of the heterojunction, and better and faster-photogenerated charge carrier separation and transportation.
1 Introduction
Donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) and donor–acceptor1–donor–acceptor2 (D–A1–D–A2) type polymers as organic electronic materials have greatly shaped the realm of organic electronics. Polymers of these architectures have been widely applied in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaic devices, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and memristors.1–3 Generally, polymers are synthesized through either Ni(II) or Pd(0) catalysis reactions.4–6 Among these reactions, the Stille polycondensation6 is the most widely used because of its high functional group tolerance, simplicity, and controlled nature. Nevertheless, the Stille polycondensation involves expensive, sensitive, and toxic organometallic reagents as precursors. Moreover, the polycondensation reaction involves more intermediate steps and produces hazardous by-products, limiting the scale-up process and raising serious environmental and sustainability issues. The presence of metallic contaminants in the polymers can act as carrier traps, affecting the device performance.7–9 However, recently, catalytic dehydrogenative cross-coupling of heteroarenes with aryl halides is emerging as an improved and relatively green alternative to the conventional cross-coupling reactions,10–12 producing polymers with fewer amounts of metal impurities.13 In comparison, employing the direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) technique, different polymers with a higher molecular weight, better regioregularity, and high yield have been synthesized by different research groups.12–15
In this context, we have synthesized two anthraquinone (AQ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based D–A1–D–A2 type copolymers through the direct heteroarylation poly-condensation reaction. The structure of the polymers is shown in Scheme 1. In polymer 1 (PAQTDPP), thiophene serves as the donor moiety (D), while anthraquinone and DPP serve as the first acceptor (A1) and the second acceptor (A2) moieties, respectively. In contrast, in polymer 2 (PAQBTDPP), the bithiophene moiety acts as the donor, and like polymer 1, anthraquinone and DPP serve as the acceptor 1 and acceptor 2, respectively. It is worth mentioning that DPP has been a successful molecule in organic electronics because of its easy accessibility, high thermal stability, robustness, absorption and emission, and high excited-state lifetime.16,17 Anthraquinone-based systems also hold enormous promise as organic semiconducting materials due to their easy accessibility, high electronegativity, and chemical and thermal stability.2

Hydrogen is highly regarded as one of the next-generation fuels to cope with the ever-increasing energy demand and propel economic growth in a sustainable and eco-friendly way.18,19 Photoelectrochemical water splitting is considered one of the best and environmentally benign processes to produce hydrogen using solar light.20–22 Lately, inorganic/organic hybrid materials have been emerging as potential candidates for photoanodes and photocathodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells.23,24 Several researchers have reported functional oxide-based inorganic/organic nano-hybrid electrode materials for PEC water splitting such as Ti3+/TiO2/P1,2 Ti3+/TiO2/P2,2 ZnO/P3HT,25 TiO2/polyheptazine,26 TiO2/branched polyethyleneimine/MoS2,27 ZnO/PC71BM,28 boron-doped TiO2/NDIEHTh@Au-Pd,29 TiO2/Au/polythiophene,30 WO3/polypyrrole:Ru4POM,31etc. Organic semiconductors owing to their customizable optoelectronic properties, large-scale synthesis, and solution processability, have caught much attention.23 A variety of organic semiconducting materials could easily be synthesized by different molecular engineering techniques. In inorganic/organic nano-heterostructures (NHs), the organic semiconductors could provide high carrier concentration and mobility and absorb a wider bandwidth of visible light.32
In this backdrop, we have coupled D–A1–D–A2 type polymer 1 (PAQTDPP) and polymer 2 (PAQBTDPP)—synthesized by the direct arylation poly-condensation reaction—with nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanorods (N-TiO2 NRs) by a facile spin-coating technique to fabricate N-TiO2/PAQTDPP and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs, respectively. TiO2 nanorods have been prepared by a solvothermal route on a FTO-coated glass substrate, and nitrogen doping has been achieved in a facile wet-chemical route. Nitrogen doping in TiO2 nanorods is done to improve light absorption and enhance the carrier density in TiO2.33,34 The rod-like structure of N-TiO2, apart from providing a strong mechanical strength to the NHs, could also facilitate faster transport of the photogenerated electrons towards the rear contact from the hetero-interface. Finally, we have explored nano-hybrid materials as the photoanode for visible light water oxidation and found the results quite satisfactory compared to other recently reported inorganic/organic hybrid photoanodes.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis of monomers and polymers
The synthesis of compound 2 was previously reported.2 However, the synthesis process involved an excess of the costly reagents, which produced more by-products while the yield was only ∼60%. As an alternative to it, the reaction has been carried out differently. The di-alkoxy (2) compound was stirred in acetic acid at room temperature (RT) in the presence of 2 equiv. of NIS and 2 equiv. of strong protic acid (Table 1). Unlike the previous method, it takes place without stoichiometric iodic acid and iodine and produces fewer by-products. It is observed that trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (TfOH) and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) give the highest yields of 98% and 96%, while other acids do not give a reasonably good yield. Only p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) gives ∼60% yield of compound 2. It is observed that strong acid (pKa < 0) catalyzes the reaction efficiently in acetic acid. The acidic medium stabilizes the transition state involving iodonium ions which can attack the anthraquinone ring. It is also observed that a stoichiometric amount of acid is necessary to generate a stoichiometric amount of iodonium ions. If TfOH is added in a catalytic amount, then the reaction does not proceed well. Moreover, the reaction does not take place in non-acidic organic solvents like CHCl3 because it cannot stabilize strongly ionic intermediates. This finding indicates that a more polar and ionizing medium like acetic acid is essential to stabilize the reaction intermediate.

The polymer PAQTDPP (P1) was synthesized through DArP using Pd-catalyst/cocatalyst Pd2dba3/P(o-MeOPh)3, additive PivOH and base Cs2CO3, in toluene under reflux for 24 h from compounds 2 and 3 in 92% yield (number average molecular weight Mn = 22.24 kDa, dispersity Đ = 1.36). When TMEDA is used as an additive, Mn slightly increases to 23.06 kDa (with dispersity of 1.54). In the conventional Stille cross-coupling polymerization, the reaction takes 72 h to complete, while the yield and molecular weight (Mn = 9.4, Đ = 1.18) are significantly lower (62%) than those of the polymer synthesized through the DArP method. This observation establishes DArP to be superior to the conventional ones. Afterward, compound 2 was converted to 4 through the typical Suzuki cross-coupling procedure using Pd(PPh3)4 in a THF/H2O mixture with an 85% yield. Subsequently, 4 was converted to 5 through bromination with NBS in chloroform. The polymer PAQBTDPP (P2) was also synthesized from compound 3 and compound 5 through the DArP method described for P1.
The molecular weight of the polymer in THF was determined by GPC, where PMMA is used as the standard. It is observed that the polymerization takes place in a controlled way, and the number average molecular weight ranges from 10–22 kDa with a low dispersity (Table 2).35

2.2 Thermal properties
Thermal stability is essential for the practical application of different organic electronic materials. The thermal stability of the polymers was studied using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S2(a)†). The decomposition temperature (Td) is defined as the temperature at which a polymer loses 5% of its initial mass. Both the polymers—PAQTDPP and PAQBTDPP—showed good thermal stability, substantiated by their high Td. The PAQTDPP polymer exhibited a Td of 241 °C, while the PAQBTDPP polymer showed a Td of 329 °C. These results indicate that the latter polymer has better stability towards heat than the former, which can be ascribed to the structural rigidity of the latter polymer. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram (Fig. S2(b)†) does not show any obvious transition, which indicates that the polymers are stable in a wide range of temperatures.
2.3 Structural order
Single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out to confirm the position of iodine in compound 2 (whether it is ortho or para)36 and its packing pattern in the solid state. For this purpose, thin needle-like crystals of compound 2 were obtained by the slow evaporation method from an ethanol/DCM solvent mixture (6:4), and a suitable crystal was chosen for X-ray diffraction. The ORTEP (Oak Ridge Thermal–Ellipsoid Plot) diagram of compound 2 is shown in Fig. 1(a). Crystallographic data and structure refinement parameters are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† The molecule crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Fdd2. Substitution of iodine and the n-BuO group at C1 and C4 positions of the anthraquinone ring induces 1,3-interaction between the oxygen atom and iodine and between the oxygen atom and n-BuO group of the anthraquinone moiety. To minimize this interaction, the carbonyl carbon atoms (C7, C7) of the middle quinone ring deviate from the middle C5-C6-C6-C5 plane by 26.4° (Fig. 1(b)). Similarly, the fused benzene rings at the terminal positions also deviate from the middle C5-C6-C6-C5 plane by 11.3° (Fig. 1(c)) to minimize these interactions via this stable geometry in the solid-state.

2.4 Morphology and crystallography
The micrographs obtained from a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) reveal the columnar structure of N-TiO2 NRs grown on the FTO substrate (Fig. 2(a)). The average width of the nanorods is ∼100 nm. The top-view FESEM micrographs of N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs (Fig. 2(b)) and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs (Fig. 2(c)) lay bare some discernible change in the morphology that occurs after the fabrication of inorganic/organic NHs.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to probe the surface of the materials. Fig. 2(d), (e), and (f) portray the AFM topographs of the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH samples. The root mean square roughness (RMS Sq) values were obtained for the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH samples, for analyzing the corresponding AFM topographs using Gwyddion. The RMS Sq values of the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH samples are 29.84 nm, 35.90 nm, and 50.60 nm, respectively. The RMS Sq values indicate an increase in the roughness after polymer deposition on the top of N-TiO2 NRs, and the PAQBTDPP polymer roughens the surface the most. Furthermore, all the samples show negative skewness (Ssk) values.

Fig. 2(g) exhibits the XRD patterns of the pristine TiO2 NR, N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH samples. The presence of the R(110), R(101), and R(310) peaks in each XRD pattern confirms the rutile phase of TiO2 (ICDD reference code: 01-071-0650) in each sample. The F(101), F(200), F(211), F(220), F(310), and F(301) XRD peaks arise from SnO2 present in FTO (ICDD reference code: 01-088-0287). No new XRD peak evolves in N-TiO2 or in NH samples. Nitrogen doping in the TiO2 lattice shifts the relevant XRD peaks towards a lower 2θ angle compared to pristine TiO2 owing to the larger crystal ionic radius of the N3− ion than O2−.34Fig. 2(h) depicts significant left-shifts that occur for the R(110) and R(101) peaks in N-doped TiO2 NRs compared to the pristine TiO2 NRs—substantiating the nitrogen doping in the TiO2 matrix.
2.5 UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra
The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of N-TiO2 NRs, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs are delineated in Fig. 3(a). The N-doped TiO2 NR sample does not exhibit any considerable absorbance in the visible light region. However, the visible light absorbance substantially increases after the formation of the NHs—which could be attributed to the visible light absorptivity of the two polymers as evidenced from the absorption spectra of the two polymer thin films on the FTO substrate (Fig. 3(b)). For estimating the bandgaps of the thin film materials, Kubelka–Munk plots are used. The Kubelka–Munk plots have been obtained for the polymer thin films assuming the polymer semiconductors as direct bandgap materials. Both polymers mainly exhibit two bandgaps—owing to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and π–π* transition. For example, the PAQTDPP polymer thin film exhibits two bandgaps of 2.97 eV and 1.93 eV (Fig. 3(c) bottom panel), while the PAQBTDPP polymer thin film depicts bandgaps of 2.92 eV and 1.77 eV (Fig. 3(c) top panel). The slightly lower bandgap of PAQBTDPP could be attributed to the higher order of conjugation due to the extra thiophene in the structure. The Kubelka–Munk plot of N-TiO2 NRs (Fig. 3(d)) reveals that the bandgap of the nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanorods is 3.09 eV. The plot also depicts a mid-bandgap of 2.44 eV—which is created due to nitrogen doping in the TiO2 lattice. The Kubelka–Munk plots of the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs are shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f), respectively, which show almost the same bandgaps of the nano-hybrid materials.

2.6 XPS analyses
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is one of the best techniques to analyze the elements constituting a material. Here, all the XPS data have been calibrated against the adventitious carbon 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The high-resolution curve-fitted XPS spectrum of Ti 2p (Fig. 4(a)) obtained from the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs reveals six peaks. The peaks positioned at 458.90 eV and 464.60 eV represent the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 states of the Ti 2p doublet related to the +4-oxidation state of titanium in TiO2.37,38 The presence of the Ti 2p small doublet with the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks centered at 457.0 eV and 462.51 eV, respectively, endorses the presence of the +3-oxidation state of titanium in nitrogen-doped TiO2.37 The +3-oxidation state of titanium is achieved by nitrogen doping.33 It is known that the Ti3+ states in TiO2 are regarded as the oxygen vacancy associates.31 The peaks located at 454.90 eV and 460.68 eV could be correlated with the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 states of nonstoichiometric titanium nitride (TiNy).37 Moreover, the 460.68 eV peak could also be associated with defective titanium oxide (TiO2−x).37 As a consequence of nitrogen doping, some oxygens in the TiO2 matrix get substituted by nitrogen, resulting in oxygen vacancies.33 The area under the curve calculation reveals that the oxygen vacancy-related Ti3+ 2p doublet contributes nearly 12.31% of the total area under the six curves. In comparison, the total area under the TiNx related peaks contributes around 10.30%.

On deconvolution, the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectrum produces three peaks centered at 530.11 eV, 532.28 eV, and 533.18 eV, respectively (Fig. 4(b)). The 530.11 eV peak could be associated with the lattice oxygen (OL) in the N-doped TiO2 matrix. The most intense peak at 532.28 eV originates from oxygen in the carbonyl groups (CO, oxygen attached to carbon by sp2 hybridization) present in the polymer.2 Moreover, the oxygen vacancies (Vo), generated by nitrogen doping, also contribute to this 532.40 eV peak.2 The low-intensity 533.18 eV peak could be attributed to the alkoxy (C–O–R) groups present in the polymer.2
The deconvoluted high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s (Fig. 4(c)) produces five peaks at 283.97 eV, 284.8 eV, 285.68 eV, 286.46 eV, and 287.90 eV. The peak at 283.97 eV could be attributed to sp2 hybridized carbon (CC).39 The 284.8 eV peak is regarded as the signature of adventitious carbon. However, this peak also signifies sp3 hybridized benzenic carbon (C–C) in the polymer.40 The peak centered at 285.68 eV is attributable to thiophene carbon involved in the C–S bond.2 The 286.46 eV binding energy peak could be correlated with carbon involved in the C–O–C bond41 and bond with pyrrolic nitrogen (specifically, the C–N+ bond of pyrrole polarons).42 The remaining 287.90 eV peak could be associated with the CO bonds.41
The high-resolution deconvoluted N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 4(d)) consists of three prominent peaks, positioned at 396.01 eV, 400.03 eV, and 401.14 eV. The 396.01 eV peak typically corresponds to the substitutional nitrogen dopants in the Ti–N bonds, while the 400.03 eV peak could be ascribed to the nitrogen molecule incorporated into the TiO2 matrix by interstitial doping.43,44 The high-intensity 400.03 eV peak also bears the signature of pyrrolic nitrogen present in DPP.45 The 401.14 eV peak could be attributed to X-ray oxidized charged nitrogen.2
The deconvoluted high-resolution XPS spectrum of the S 2p state (Fig. 4(e)) depicts one spin-orbit doublet with the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 related peaks positioned at 164.1 eV and 165.4 eV, respectively, representing neutral thiophene sulfur. Additionally, a low-intensity peak at 169.2 eV can also be observed from the deconvoluted S 2p XPS spectrum. This peak generally indicates a low level of oxidized sulfur, which probably occurred due to the exposure of the sample to the laboratory atmosphere.2
2.7 Photoelectrochemical performances

Fig. 5(a) depicts the current density vs. potential (J–V) plots of the three photoelectrodes under dark, and visible light illumination conditions, obtained by performing linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at 10 mV s−1 scan rate in 0.5 M aq. Na2SO4 electrolyte. It can easily be observed that the photocurrent densities (Jph) considerably increase after the inorganic/organic nano-heterojunction formation. At 1.23 VRHE, the recorded Jph values are 0.157 mA cm−2, 0.504 mA cm−2, and 0.397 mA cm−2 for the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoelectrodes, respectively. These results imply nearly 221% and 153% increments in the Jph values for the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs, respectively, compared to the N-TiO2 NRs at 1.23 VRHE. Fig. 5(c) exhibits the J–V plot under chopped visible light illumination, which substantiates the fast and reproducible photosensitivity of the photoelectrodes. It could be observed from Fig. 5(a) and (c) that both of the NH photoanodes produce a distinct reduction hump. The reduction peak appearing only under visible light illumination could be attributed to the consumption of the photogenerated electrons by one of the constituent moieties (probably AQ) in the polymers.

Na2SO4 electrolyte) under dark and visible light illumination conditions (a) vs. RHE and (b) vs. the Ag/AgCl scale (c) J–V plot under chopped visible light illumination. (d) Photoconversion efficiency vs. potential plots of the three photoelectrodes. 
The water oxidation onset potential (Vonset) could be defined as the potential at which the extrapolation of the maximum-slope part of Jph intersects the dark current density (Jdark).46 The water oxidation onset potential might be visualized as that minimum voltage, which is additionally needed despite the energy of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs to initiate the water oxidation reaction. From Fig. S15,† it could be found that the Vonset potentials of N-TiO2 NRs, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs are 0.68 VRHE, 0.45 VRHE, and 0.47 VRHE, respectively. Clear cathodic shifts in the water oxidation onset potential could be observed for the inorganic/organic NH electrodes compared to the N-TiO2 NR electrode. The N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs exhibit a slightly lower Vonset value than the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH electrode. This could be related to the difference in the chemical composition of PAQTDPP and PAQBTDPP, which ultimately results in a bit better surface charge transport behavior in N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs.
For a three-electrode system, the half-cell photoconversion efficiency (η%) is widely considered to measure the solar conversion efficiency of the PEC cell, and eqn (1) defines the photoconversion efficiency. (1)Here, Jph is the photocurrent density, VRHE is the applied potential in the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale, and Pin is the intensity of the light used (100 mW cm−2 in our case). Fig. 5(d) depicts the photoconversion efficiency values at different applied potentials for all three electrodes. The maximum photoconversion efficiency value obtained for the N-TiO2 NRs, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs is ∼0.04% (at 0.91 VRHE), 0.19% (at 0.73 VRHE), and 0.12% (at 0.94 VRHE), respectively. The performances of these inorganic/organic NH photoanodes have been compared with those of other recently reported inorganic/organic hybrid photoanodes shown in Table S5† in the ESI, and the performances of these N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes are quite impressive.
Apart from the half-cell photoconversion efficiency, the ideal regenerative cell efficiency47 (ηIRC%) could also be determined to shed some light on the efficiency of a three-electrode electrochemical cell. A photoelectrochemical cell might be treated as the analog of the solid-state photovoltaic cell, and therefore, ηIRC% could be calculated in the same fashion as the solar cells using eqn (2). However, the first-quadrant Jph–VRHE plot within the 0 V to 1.229 V window is considered for the ideal regenerative cell efficiency, unlike the fourth-quadrant J–V plot of solar cells. The photocurrent density at 1.229 VRHE is denoted as J(E(O2/H2O)). (2)
In eqn (2), Vmp and Jmp respectively represent the potential and photocurrent density, corresponding to Pmax, which represents the power (density) at the maximum power (density) point. As already mentioned, Pin is the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2). If the potential corresponding to the zero-photocurrent density (point A in Fig. 6(a)) is subtracted from 1.229 V, then V0 is obtained (AD or BC straight line in Fig. 6(a)). The ratio of Pmax to the product of V0 and J(E(O2/H2O))) (i.e., the area of the ABCD rectangle in Fig. 6(a)) could define the fill-factor (FF). The estimated ηIRC values for the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes are 0.038%, 0.181%, and 0.129%, respectively (Fig. 6(b)). Interestingly, these values are close to the pertaining maximum photoconversion efficiencies reported earlier. The estimated fill-factors for the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes are 0.297, 0.324, and 0.296, respectively.

The shaded areas under each curve represent the maximum power density Pmax, which is obtained by multiplying Vmp and Jmp. Vmp and Jmp for the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs are marked in this figure. 
Linear sweep voltammetry is often performed in the presence of an aqueous electrolyte containing a hole scavenger such as Na2SO3 to investigate the surface injection efficiency (ηinjection) of the photoanodes. Owing to the lower activation energy and faster oxidation kinetics of SO32− ions than water, ηinjection is assumed to be 100% for SO32− species.48 To probe the surface injection efficiency of the three photoanodes, here, we have performed the LSV measurement in an aqueous electrolyte containing 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 0.5 M Na2SO3 (pH 9.85). Fig. 7(a) depicts the LSV plots of the three electrodes under dark and visible light illumination conditions. It is evident from Fig. 7(a) and 5(b) that the Jph value increases for each of the photoanodes in the presence of the hole scavenger. Precisely speaking, at 1 VAg/AgCl, in the presence of a mixed salt electrolyte, N-TiO2 NRs, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs produce a Jph of 0.36 mA cm−2, 0.70 mA cm−2, and 0.59 mA cm−2, respectively. However in the presence of only 0.5 M aq. Na2SO4 solution at 1 VAg/AgCl, these photoelectrodes produce a current density of 0.164 mA cm−2, 0.553 mA cm−2, and 0.43 mA cm−2, respectively.

(b) Surface injection efficiency vs. potential plots of the three electrodes. 
It should be noted that unlike the Jph curves shown in Fig. 5(b), the Jph curves obtained using the mixed salt electrolyte do not produce any significant reduction wave (Fig. 7(a)).
The surface injection efficiency (ηinjection) is defined as the ratio between the photocurrent densities recorded in the presence of only 0.5 M aq. Na2SO4 electrolyte  and in the presence of the hole scavenging electrolyte , i.e., (3)
The injection efficiencies of the photoelectrodes at different applied potentials could be visualized in Fig. 7(b). It is worth mentioning here that as the pH values of the two electrolytes are different, the Jph values in different electrolytes do not map to the same potential in the RHE scale. This is why the potential is taken against the Ag/AgCl reference as shown in Fig. 7(b). From the ηinjectionvs. potential plot, it could easily be recognized that the surface injection efficiencies are better for the NH electrodes throughout the potential window. The maximum ηinjection for N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH, and N-TiO2 NR photoelectrodes attain ∼86%, 72%, and 60%, respectively.

Fig. 8 shows the current density vs. time (J–t) plots of the three electrodes under 60 s visible light illumination at different applied potentials, revealing the good photo-switching activities of the electrodes. Keeping consistency with the photocurrent density values depicted in the LSV plot (Fig. 5(a)), the photo-switching measurements also lay bare a similar trend. The N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH photoelectrode produces the maximum photocurrent density under light illumination at different applied potentials, followed by the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH and N-TiO2 NR photoanodes.

Here, 0.637 VAg/AgCl = 1.23 VRHE at pH 6.7 (d) J–t plots of the two NH electrodes obtained from the photo-switching measurements at 0.5 VAg/AgCl under 1 h long uninterrupted visible light illumination. 
The J–t plots of the inorganic/organic nano-hybrid photoelectrodes, obtained under 1 h long visible light illumination at 0.5 VAg/AgCl (Fig. 8(d)), reveal good photostability of the nano-hybrid electrodes.
The photoelectrochemically generated solar fuels, i.e., hydrogen and oxygen, were collected using the inverted-burette technique (Fig. S1†).38 Photoelectrochemically generated hydrogen was collected from the Pt wire cathode, and oxygen was collected from the NH photoanode in two separate photo-switching experiments at 0.5 VAg/AgCl by the inverted-burette technique. Fig. 9(a) and (b) depict the quantity of collected gas versus time plots of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, for the nano-hybrid electrodes. The amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gases collected for the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs after 1 h were 6.25 μmol cm−2 and 3.21 μmol cm−2, respectively. The amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gases collected from the photoelectrochemical setup involving N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs, were 4.46 μmol cm−2 and 2.23 μmol cm−2, respectively. The faradaic efficiency (FE) for the photoelectrochemical gas evolution reaction can be calculated using the following equation (eqn (4)): (4)Here, qth is the amount of theoretically predicted gas, J is the current density (in A cm−2), t is the time (in s), z is the number of electrons involved (which is 2 for H2 and 4 for O2), and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1). As a result, the faradaic efficiencies for the hydrogen gas evolution reaction for the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs are 87.5% and 83.33%, respectively, after 1 h. In photoelectrochemical oxygen production, the calculated faradaic efficiencies after 1 h for the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs are 90% and 83%, respectively.

The impedance-potential measurement was performed at 1 kHz to obtain the Mott–Schottky plot. The Mott–Schottky equation is given as follows: (5)Here, Cs represents the depletion layer or the space charge layer capacitance, e is the electronic charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), εr is the relative permittivity of the electrode material, and ε0 is the free space permittivity. Nd is the donor density, A is the active geometrical area of the electrode, V is the applied potential, Vfb is the flat-band potential, and kT/e is the temperature-dependent correction term—involving the Boltzmann constant (k, k = 1.3806 × 10−23 JK−1), temperature (T) in the Kelvin scale, and electronic charge. The donor density Nd can be obtained from eqn (6) by differentiating eqn (5) with respect to V. It can easily be comprehended that the donor density is inversely proportional to the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot. (6)

Fig. 10(a) depicts the Mott–Schottky plots of the three photoelectrodes. The positive slopes of the respective depletion region of three photoelectrodes establish the n-type behavior of the electrode materials. It could be observed from the Mott–Schottky plots that the slope of the depletion region is maximum for the N-TiO2 NR photoelectrode, and the slope decreases considerably after the formation of the NHs. The N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH photoelectrode produces the lowest slope—predicting the highest carrier density among the three electrodes. The estimated flat-band potentials of N-TiO2 NRs, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs are 0.128 VRHE, 0.077 VRHE, and 0.115 VRHE, respectively—revealing cathodic shifts in the flat band potentials of the NH electrodes compared to that of the N-TiO2 NR electrode. The cathodic shift in the flat band potential is generally attributed to the augmented donor density, and adsorbed anions at the surface states.2,49 Moreover, the cathodically shifted flat-band potential increases the extent of the band bending Δϕsc and widens the depletion layer width29,50—resulting in an overall enhancement in the PEC water splitting process. The Mott–Schottky plots of the two polymers coated on FTO substrate (Fig. S17†) reveal their n-type nature, and the flat-band potentials of PAQTDPP and PAQBTDPP are −0.068 VRHE and 0.026 VRHE, respectively.

(b) Nyquist plots of the three photoanodes, obtained by performing an AC impedance experiment at 0 VAg/AgCl under visible light illumination using 0.5 M aq. Na2SO4 electrolyte. Equivalent circuits of (c) N-TiO2 NR (d) N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes. 

Fig. 10(b) shows the Nyquist plots of the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes, obtained by performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, AC impedance study) under visible light illumination at 0 VAg/AgCl with an AC perturbation of 5 mV. The EIS data analyses give the equivalent circuits of N-TiO2 NR (Fig. 10(c)) and N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes (Fig. 10(d)). Here, Rs, Rbulk, and Rct represent the equivalent series resistance, bulk resistance, and surface charge-transfer resistance, respectively. The bulk resistance is the resistance of the ion-conducting path that develops in the material. CPE is the constant phase element, and ZW is the Warburg element. The Rs value of the N-TiO2 NR photoanode is found to be 14.47 Ω cm2, whereas the Rs values of the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes are found to be 9.14 Ω cm2 and 9.35 Ω cm2, respectively. From these values, a clear reduction in the equivalent series resistance could easily be noticed after the formation of the nano-heterostructure, and the value of the equivalent series resistance of the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH photoanode is slightly lower than that of the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanode. The estimated values of the bulk resistance for the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes are 311.35 Ω cm2, 172.6 Ω cm2, and 356 Ω cm2, respectively. The Rbulk might be viewed as the pore resistance, which is the resistance of the ion-conducting path that develops in the material.29 The higher value of Rbulk in the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanode than N-TiO2 might indicate a decrease in the ion-conducting channels after coating the N-TiO2 NRs with the PAQBTDPP polymer. However, the bulk resistance value is considerably low for the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, which suggests that the PAQTDPP polymer coating does not reduce the number of ion-conducting channels, most probably due to its favorable general properties such as surface tension/viscosity. The estimated surface charge-transfer resistance values of the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes are 2046.9 Ω cm2, 505.18 Ω cm2, and 591.83 Ω cm2, respectively—manifesting a discernible difference in the overall surface charge-transfer process of the three electrodes. Compared to the N-TiO2 NRs, the charge-transfer resistance significantly drops after the formation of the NHs. Additionally, it could also be seen that the charge-transfer resistance assumes a lower value in the case of N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs than in the case of the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanode. The lower charge-transfer resistance in the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs gives rise to a higher photocurrent, as has been already evidenced from the LSV plots.
In a different model suitable to study the frequency response of the real and imaginary parts of the impedance, the real part of the impedance Z′(ω) and the imaginary part of the impedance Z′′(ω) are expressed using the following equation (eqn (7)):51 (7)where ω is the angular frequency, Rg, Rgb, Cg, and Cgb are the grain resistance, grain boundary resistance, grain capacitance, and grain boundary capacitance, respectively. The expressions shown in eqn (7) could be obtained by analyzing the circuit in which the parallel combination of Rg and Cg is in series with the parallel combination of Rgb and Cgb.
The room temperature Z′ vs. frequency plots of the N-TiO2 NRs, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs are given in Fig. S16 (a).† It could be seen that for all the samples, with the increase in the frequency, the Z′ value decreases and finally becomes frequency independent. This incident happens because of the presence of space charge polarization. At higher frequencies, the carriers at the grain boundary easily overcome the barrier, resulting in an improvement in the conductivity. The −Z′′ vs. frequency plots (Fig. S16(b)†) show that with the increase in the frequency, −Z′′ for each sample increases, attains a maximum , and then decreases and finally becomes frequency independent. Compared to the N-TiO2 NRs, the respective  value of the NHs shifts towards a higher frequency. The intense  peak and its position at a lower frequency could be correlated with the higher grain resistance, grain capacitance, grain boundary resistance, and grain boundary capacitance in N-TiO2 NRs (using eqn (7)). After the formation of the NHs, the values of all these elements decrease significantly.

Fig. 11(a) shows the change in the open-circuit potential under ‘light on’ and ‘light off’ conditions for each nano-hybrid electrode. Fig. 11(a) shows that whenever visible light is shone on the NH electrodes, the corresponding open circuit potential plunges and tries to obtain a saturation value during this ‘light on’ period. However, after discontinuing the light illumination, the open-circuit potential starts increasing and finally tends to saturate, which happens owing to the recombination of the photogenerated carriers.
 Fig. 11  (a) Open circuit potential (Voc) vs. time plots under chopped visible light illumination for the two NH electrodes. (b) Calculated carrier lifetime vs. the open circuit potential of the two NH electrodes. (c) Schematics of the probable band alignment, photogeneration, separation, and migration of the charge carriers for PEC water splitting by the inorganic/organic NHs. 
The open-circuit potential (Voc) is a potential at which the net exchange current across the semiconductor-electrolyte junction (SCLJ) becomes zero. Under the open-circuit conditions, the Fermi level of the semiconductor aligns with the redox potential of the electrolyte, making the net current flow across the SCLJ zero. The higher Voc value (less negative) in the dark might be correlated with the higher electron density of the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs than that of N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs.2 On illuminating a photoanode, the quasi-Fermi level of holes gets positioned near the valence band of the photoanode material at the SCLJ. The open-circuit potential becomes more negative compared to that under the dark conditions to restrain the photogenerated hole flow from the photoanode towards the electrolyte—resulting in a zero net current flow.2 ΔVoc is the difference between the Voc values under the dark and illumination conditions, and it reports on the photovoltage.52 The average ΔVoc values of the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs are 0.156 V and 0.164 V, respectively. Therefore, it is seen that the photovoltage is slightly higher in the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs compared to that of its counterpart.
The electron lifetime (τn) could be estimated using eqn (8) from the transient of Voc after switching the light off.27 (8)

Fig. 11(b) delineates the electron lifetime profiles of the two nano-hybrid electrodes over a window of the open-circuit potential. From Fig. 11(b), it could be presumed that the electron lifetime is slightly greater in the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH electrode. Therefore, although the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH electrode produces a slightly larger ΔVoc than that of the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH electrode, the former electrode offers shorter electron lifetime than the latter.

Fig. 11(c) depicts the probable band alignment between N-TiO2 and the polymer (applicable for PAQTDPP and PAQBTDPP). The flat-band potentials of n-type N-TiO2, PAQTDPP, and PAQBTDPP polymers suggest that the conduction band minima (or LUMO) of both polymers should position above that of N-TiO2 (as shown in Fig. 11(c)), which along with the respective bandgap values of the materials, indicate the formation of the type-II n–n heterojunction between N-TiO2 and the polymers. Under visible light illumination, photogenerated electron–hole (e–h) pairs are produced. The electrons owing to the favorable band alignment, move towards N-TiO2. Here, the heterojunction plays a crucial role in dissociating the photogenerated e–h pair into its constituents.53 From N-TiO2 NRs, the electrons move to the FTO substrate, and finally, through the external circuit, the electrons reach the Pt wire (cathode) and take part in hydrogen generation. On the other hand, the photogenerated holes move towards the SCLJ and participate in the water oxidation reaction (as delineated in Fig. 11(c)).

2.7.1 PEC performance in the light of PL studies. 
The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the three electrodes and the TRPL spectra of the two polymers could also guide us in understanding the difference in the photoelectrochemical performances of the three electrodes. Fig. 12(a) depicts the room temperature solid-state PL of the N-TiO2 NRs, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs (excitation wavelength λex = 325 nm). It could be observed from Fig. 12(a) that the PL intensity is maximum for the N-TiO2 NR electrode, and it decreases moderately for the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs. However, a significant decrease in the PL intensity could be evidenced in the case of the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs. The Gaussian peak-fitted PL spectra of the three materials—N-TiO2 NRs, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs—are shown in Fig. S18† in ESI. On deconvolution, the PL spectrum of N-TiO2 NRs shows six peaks centered at 360 nm, 404 nm, 440 nm, 467 nm, 488 nm, and 500 nm, respectively. The 360 nm PL peak could originate from the phonon-assisted indirect bandgap emission in N-TiO2.29 The 404 nm peak could be assigned to strong excitonic emission,29 whereas the 440 nm emission peak could be correlated with the self-trapped excitons.29 The emission peak centered at 467 nm could be attributed to oxygen vacancy-related defect states.29 The PL peaks located at 488 nm and 500 nm are attributed to different surface states associated with oxygen vacancies.34 Now, for the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs, the last-mentioned three peaks are positioned at 468 nm, 484 nm, and 509 nm. However for the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs, the oxygen vacancy and surface defect-related peaks are located at 466 nm, 489 nm, 507 nm, and 531 nm. The sum of each full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the surface state-related emission peak for N-TiO2 NRs (488 nm and 500 nm) is 118.77 nm. In comparison, the sum of each FWHM of peaks related to surface defects for N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs (484 nm, 509 nm) is 72.07 nm. For N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs, the sum of FWHMs of such peaks (489 nm, 507 nm, and 531 nm) is 77.91 nm (see Table S6†). This comparative FWHM study indicates an extensive dominance of surface state-related recombination in the N-TiO2 NRs. Such a dominance significantly reduces after the formation of the inorganic/organic heterostructure. However, the slightly lower FWHM-sum for the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs than N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs could be one of the reasons for the better photoelectrochemical performance of the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH photoelectrode. The lower FWHM value suggests a lesser amount of surface recombination of the photogenerated carriers.

The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of PAQTDPP and PAQBTDPP polymers are shown in Fig. 12(b). Each TRPL spectrum has been fitted in the triple exponential decay function (eqn (9)), where A and Bi are constants, and τi is the lifetime. (9)
The average lifetime (τav) is calculated using eqn (10). (10)
The τ1, τ2, and τ3 values for the PAQTDPP polymer are 0.44 ns, 0.91 ns, and 3.68 ns, respectively, with an average lifetime of 0.886 ns. In contrast, for the PAQBTDPP polymer, the τ1, τ2, and τ3 values are 0.74 ns, 0.93 ns, and 5.06 ns, respectively, and the average lifetime is 0.824 ns (see Table S7†). The slightly larger average lifetime in the PAQTDPP polymer could give an edge over the PAQBTDPP polymer. It is anticipated that after the formation of the NHs, the photogenerated electrons in PAQTDPP get a bit higher time to relocate before they recombine, resulting in an augmented PEC performance. An average lifetime of 0.19 ns for N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs and 0.16 ns for N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs—calculated from the corresponding TRPL spectra (Fig. 12(c))—also justifies this assumption.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized two anthraquinone and diketopyrrolopyrrole-based π-conjugated copolymers—PAQTDPP and PAQBTDPP—of D–A1–D–A2 architecture by the direct arylation polycondensation technique. In the PAQTDPP polymer, thiophene serves as the donor moiety. In contrast, bithiophene serves as the donor component in the PAQBTDPP polymer. The polymers are thermally stable, absorb the visible light spectrum, and are soluble in different organic solvents. We have fabricated two n–n inorganic/organic nano-heterostructures—N-TiO2/PAQTDPP and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP—by spin-coating. We have explored the visible light photoelectrochemical properties of the inorganic/organic hybrid materials as the photoanode in the PEC cell. We have found that the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH photoelectrode and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoelectrode exhibit photocurrent densities of 0.504 mA cm−2 and 0.397 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which are 221% and 153% higher than that shown by the N-TiO2 NR photoelectrode, respectively. Each inorganic/organic NH photoanode also registers a significant cathodic shift in the corresponding water oxidation onset potential compared to the N-TiO2 NRs. Moreover, after 1 h of visible light illumination, the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes produced 3.21 μmol cm−2 and 2.23 μmol cm−2 oxygen gas, respectively, at 0.5 VAg/AgCl. Under the same conditions, the quantities of collected hydrogen gas at the Pt wire for the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NHs and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NHs were 6.25 μmol cm−2 and 4.46 μmol cm−2, respectively. The amelioration in the overall photoelectrochemical performances showcased by the NH electrodes is attributable to the better visible light absorbance, expedited delocalization of the photogenerated charge carriers at the heterointerface, and faster charge transportation from the organic polymers via the N-TiO2 NRs. However, the overall PEC performances of the N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH photoelectrode is slightly better than that of its counterpart—the N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoelectrode—which could be ascribed to the higher order of dominance of the surface defects in the later mentioned NHs photoelectrode.
