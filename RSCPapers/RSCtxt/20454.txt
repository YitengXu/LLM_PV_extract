Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have attracted considerable interest for use in the next generation of renewable energy technology because of their tunable material properties, simple fabrication process and the potential of low-cost, large-scale production of flexible devices.1 Low-bandgap conjugated polymers have been studied intensively in recent years with the aim of matching a greater part of the solar spectrum and hence harvesting the maximum photon flux, thus producing high efficiencies of over 6–7%.2–5 Straightforward ways to reduce the bandgap are raising the HOMO level, lowering the LUMO level, or doing both simultaneously. However, a lot of the reported low-bandgap polymers suffer from low efficiency in photovoltaics, because raising the HOMO level to broaden absorption coverage will reduce the polymer bandgap and result in a loss of Voc.6,7 The ability to control the HOMO level of a conjugated polymer while maintaining its bandgap is critically important for producing highly efficient solar cells by minimizing wasted energy and maximizing the Voc.
Herein, we show that the simple approach of changing the side chain density of the electron donors makes it possible to access a range of Voc values. Because the alkyl side chain in a conjugated polymer is an electron-donating group,8 one effective way to limit this electron-donating effect is to insert unsubstituted thiophene groups into the polymer backbone and hence decrease the number of alkyl chains in the polymers. One good example is the investigation by the Yang group of the photovoltaic properties of poly[3-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophene] (P3HDTTT) and their comparison with those of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).9 They found that due to the reduced number of the alkyl chains in P3HDTTT, the Voc of the P3HDTTT/PCBM-based device reached 0.8 V, which is ∼0.2 V higher than the P3HT/PCBM-based device. However, as P3HDTTT contained a different molecular structure from that of P3HT, i.e., a (2-hexyldecyl) solubilizing group, the direct effect of the inserted thiophene ring on the resulting Voc of the system was not found.
Recently, poly[3-(4-n-octyl)phenylthiophene] (POPT) has been shown to exhibit very promising optical and electronic features in organic solar cells due to its red-shifted light absorption and a lower-lying HOMO level than that of P3HT.10,11 The synthetic simplicity and tunability of POPT makes these materials very attractive for the exploration of structure–property relationships in organic photovoltaics.
Here, we present a series of new POPT derivatives POPT, poly[3-(4-n-octyl)phenyl-5,2′,5′,2″-terthiophene] (POPTT) and poly[3-(4-n-octyl)phenyl-5,2′,5′,2″,5″,2‴-quaterthiophene] (POPQT) that include different numbers of thiophene groups added to their conjugated backbone and thus retain different side chain densities (Fig. 1). The novel multithiophene-containing polymers were prepared by a palladium catalyzed Stille coupling (POPTT: Mn = 14 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.4; POPQT: Mn = 6.2 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.5). For comparison, POPT was also synthesized (Mn = 16 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.1). All synthetic details are described in the ESI† (Schemes S1–S5).
 Fig. 1  The chemical structures of the POPT, POPTT and POPQT having different alkyl chain densities for the electron donors. 
To investigate the effects of the side chain density on the optical and electrical properties of the POPT, POPTT and POPQT polymers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV-visible absorption measurements were performed (Table 1). From the onset of the thin-film optical absorption spectra of the polymers, the optical bandgaps for POPT, POPTT and POPQT were estimated at about 1.76, 1.93 and 1.97 eV, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). From the onset of oxidation potential, the HOMO levels of POPT, POPTT and POPQT were determined at −5.34, −5.43 and −5.49 eV, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). As the number of thiophenes in the repeating unit of the polymers was increased, the HOMO value decreased, thus reducing the offset between the HOMO of the polymer and the HOMO of PCBM. And the LUMO levels of POPT, POPTT and POPQT were estimated at −3.58, −3.50 and −3.52 eV, respectively, from the HOMO level and the optical bandgap of each polymer.

The effects of the side chain density on the crystalline structure of the polymers were investigated by examining POPT, POPTT and POPQT polymersvia grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. In all three samples, the diffraction peaks were strongest in the out-of-plane direction (qz), indicating that the polymer films had a well-organized structure with lamellar conjugated polymer stacks oriented along the perpendicular axis of the substrate. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the (200) and (300) peaks in POPT were clearly observed, indicating that the distance between adjacent POPT chains was 2.8 nm. This number agrees well with previous findings.12 The peak at q ≈ 1.6 Å−1 indicates a π–π stacking distance of 0.39 nm between POPT chains, a value similar to that of P3HT. The GIWAXS pattern in Fig. 2(b) revealed that the lattice spacing of POPTT with two added thiophene groups was largely unchanged. The (100) peak could not be found due to the overlap with the beam stop reflection, but the (200), (300), (400), and (500) peaks were clearly observed at q = 0.43, 0.65, 0.87, and 1.07 Å−1, respectively, indicating that the distance between adjacent POPTT moieties was 2.9 nm. In addition, the π–π stacking distance at q ≈ 1.6 Å−1 (0.39 nm) of POPTT was observed to be the same as that of POPT. In contrast, POPQT polymers had very different lattice spacing. The (100) peak of POPQT was found at 1.8 nm, showing that another added thiophene in POPQT induced a significant decrease in the domain spacing compared to POPTT. In addition, the π–π stacking of POPQT was shifted to q ≈ 1.5 Å−1, which corresponds to 0.415 nm. We think that the side-chain density of POPQT, having only one n-octylphenyl thiophene unit for every three thiophenes, is low enough to accommodate the n-octylphenyl side chains belonging to adjacent layers and allows side-chain interdigitation. The interdigitated n-octylphenyl side chains induced the slight increase in the π–π stacking of POPQT, which may be due to the twisting of the phenyl ring. It has been reported that polymers with substantial interdigitation such as poly[5,5′-bis(3-dodecyl-2-thienyl)-2,2′-bithiophene)] (PQT) and poly[2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PBTTT) show a three-dimensional registry, which also enhances lateral ordering because the closely packed, interdigitated side chains help to preserve the structure by interlocking adjacent layers.13,14 However, without side-chain interdigitation, there exists no strong mechanism to preserve the registry between adjacent polymer chains, as exemplified by P3HT.14 Therefore, we note that highly ordered mixed index peaks were only found in the GIWAXS pattern of POPQT. In Fig. 2(c), the patterns of POPQT clearly showed higher-order mixed-index peaks along the out-of-plane direction at the qxy ≈ 1.2 Å−1 plane, confirming three-dimensional ordering and providing further evidence of side-chain interdigitation. In contrast, there were no highly ordered mixed index peaks in the GIWAXS patterns of POPT and POPTT. The dramatic changes in GIWAXS patterns among POPT, POPTT and POPQT indicated that the density of side chains, through its effect on side-chain interdigitation, correlates to the maximum extent of three-dimensional order and device performance. In this regard, hole mobility in the polymers was measured by space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurement, using a device with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Au structure. The hole mobility of POPTT was determined to be 5.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. In contrast, POPQT exhibit a much higher hole mobility of 5.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S4, ESI†). We believe that one of the reasons for the much higher hole mobility of POPQT compared to POPTT could be caused by this enhancement of their three-dimensional order through side-chain interdigitation.

To elucidate the relationship between the molecular structure and device function, the fabrication and performance of bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells based on blends of these polymers with PCBM (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al) are also described (Fig. 3). Table 2 summarizes the device characteristics of the polymer solar cells (POPT, POPTT and POPQT). The device thicknesses of three different polymers at the optimized condition were almost the same (100–120 nm). A LiF layer was introduced as the intermediate layer to enhance the electrical contact between the active layer and the Al anode, resulting in higher Voc and Jsc. The BHJ devices consisting of POPT:PC61BM, POPTT:PC61BM and POPQT:PC61BM showed increased Voc values of 0.56, 0.63 and 0.75 V, respectively, resulting in the highest power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.77% for the POPQT/PCBM device (Voc = 0.75 V, Jsc = 7.69 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.48). And, the best solar cells of POPTT/PCBM and POPQT/PCBM were obtained using a 1∶3 ratio of polymer to PCBM, whereas the performance of the POPT/PCBM device was optimized using a 1∶1 ratio of POPT to PCBM. We think that such difference in the optimal blend ratio is due to the fullerene intercalation as the lower alkyl chain density in the polymers can enable them to accommodate the fullerenes between the alkyl chains.15 The efficiency of BHJ devices can be further improved by replacing the acceptor PC61BM with PC71BM, which has the stronger light absorption in the visible region16 (Fig. S5, ESI†). The BHJ device consisting of POPQT:PC71BM (1∶3, w/w) showed a PCE of 3.44%.

An energy-band diagram of the polymers used in our study and PCBM demonstrates that the HOMO level of POPQT is located closer to that of PCBM compared to POPT and POPTT (Fig. 3(b)). It is well-known that the Voc is mainly determined by the difference between the LUMO of the electron acceptor and the HOMO of the electron donor, although other factors such as device morphology and charge mobility make minor contributions to the Voc.17 Therefore, the change in HOMO levels among POPT, POPTT and POPQT as illustrated in the energy-band diagram clearly explains their different Voc values.
To gain insight into the operation of these BHJ solar cells, the morphology of the BHJ layer (polymer:PC61BM) was investigated by tapping-mode AFM measurements (Fig. S6, ESI†). Both POPTT:PCBM and POPQT:PCBM films display relatively well-mixed morphologies at the 20–30 nm length scale. However, we note that the structure of the POPQT:PCBM blend shows a finer morphology, having a smaller domain size and a smoother surface than that of POPTT:PCBM (the RMS surface roughness of POPQT:PCBM was 0.9 nm whereas that of POPTT:PCBM was 2.3 nm). The finer morphology in the POPQT:PCBM blend allows for more interfacial areas for exciton dissociation and ensures better electrical contact between the active layer and the electrodes. And the morphology of polymer:fullerene blends is under further investigation by 2D GIXRD to confirm the possibility of the fullerene intercalation.
In conclusion, we developed a series of novel POPT derivatives (POPT, POPTT and POPQT) with different side-chain densities and investigated the effects of molecular structure on BHJ solar cell performance. It was found that decrease in the side chain density reduced their LUMO and HOMO levels. As a result of lower HOMO levels, BHJ devices consisting of POPT:PCBM, POPTT:PCBM and POPQT:PCBM showed increased Voc values of 0.56, 0.63 and 0.75 V, respectively. In addition, GIWAXS studies revealed that the decrease in the side-chain density of the conjugated polymers allowed for side-chain interdigitation and promoted a three-dimensional packing structure in POPQT. The enhanced charge mobility in POPQT films and the morphological enhancement of POPQT:PCBM blends had synergistic effects on the Jsc and FF of the POPQT:PCBM device, thus yielding better overall photovoltaic performance. Our simple approach of tuning the side chain density in the conjugated polymers provides a model system for investigating the effects on the LUMO and HOMO levels of polymers and suggests a design rule for higher Voc and better device performance.
