    , Accepted 25th February 2019First published on 26th February 2019AbstractThe influence of the vapor transport deposition (VTD) conditions of tin sulfide (SnS) on the formation of secondary phases, preferred orientation, and solar cell performance is investigated in this study. It is concluded that 600 °C is the optimal growth temperature for the formation of pure SnS absorbers. When the growth temperature was 550 °C, the formation of secondary Sn2S3 and SnS2 phases was detected by Raman analysis. When the growth temperature was 625 °C, a noticeable change in morphology was observed with the plate-shaped grains aligned vertically to the substrate, which is detrimental to solar cell performance. The duration of growth also affected the morphology of the SnS absorber. Thin absorbers exhibited strong (120) preferred orientation. With increased duration of growth, (101) and (111) orientations increased. Such a variation in preferred orientation influenced the SnS/CdS solar cell’s performance. When the absorber thickness was as thin as ∼0.7 μm, the cell was prone to shunting and severe series resistance. When the absorber was as thick as ∼3.0 μm, physical shunting prevailed, worsening the performance of the cell. The highest efficiency of 3.93% with good cell-to-cell uniformity was achieved when the absorber thickness was ∼1.2 μm. The good stability of the best device was also confirmed under continuous illumination and damp-heat conditions for 100 h.
1. Introduction
Over the past several years, earth-abundant and inexpensive binary metal chalcogenides have attracted growing attention as alternatives to conventional Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and CdTe as light absorbers in thin-film solar cells (TFSCs).1 Representative materials include Sb2Se3, Sb2S3, and tin sulfide (SnS).2–5 A favorable bandgap between 1.1 and 1.5 eV and a high absorption coefficient of over 104 cm−1 make them promising next-generation absorbers. However, the highest power-conversion efficiency (η) reported so far is 7.6% for Sb2Se3,6 7.5% for Sb2S3,7 and 4.36% for SnS,8 which are far below the theoretical values of ∼30% expected from the bandgap of these materials.
For potential large-scale deployment of TFSCs,9 SnS has an advantage over Sb2Se3 and Sb2S3 considering the ten-fold abundance of Sn over Sb in the Earth's crust.10 In order to obtain large-grain and phase-pure monosulfide films, various methods have been adopted, such as chemical bath deposition (CBD),11 electrodeposition,12 mechanochemical techniques,13 atomic layer deposition (ALD),14 pulsed chemical vapor deposition,8,15 sputtering,16 thermal evaporation,17,18 and vapor transport deposition (VTD).19,20
Since the first meaningful report of 1.3% for SnS/CdS TFSCs in 2006 by Reddy et al.,11 much effort has been put into further improving solar cell efficiency. Although there is some merit to the SnS absorber as a non-toxic and earth-abundant absorber, its efficiency reached a maximum of 4.36%, which was achieved by Sinsermsuksakul et al. in 2014 using a SnS/SnO2/Zn(O,S):N configuration.8
Moreover, most research groups have difficulty achieving an efficiency of over 2%. Several factors can be blamed for the frequently observed low efficiency of SnS TFSCs. The incorporation of secondary phases such as Sn2S3 or SnS2 can limit efficiency, because Sn exhibits an oxidation state of +2 and +4. Sn2S3 and SnS2 are n-type materials, and when they are present in p-type SnS thin films, the devices show poor efficiency due to increased recombination. Therefore, in order to develop highly efficient SnS TFSCs, forming a single-phase SnS thin film is a prerequisite. Moreover, the insufficient minority carrier lifetime of SnS (<100 ps) and the unfavorable conduction band offset (CBO) with n-type buffer may be other reasons for the limited cell efficiency.8,15,21,22
More fundamentally, further attention should be given to the fact that SnS is a non-cubic material unlike CIGS or CdTe,23 crystallizing in an orthorhombic structure (JCPDS no. 39-0354, a = 4.3291 Å, b = 11.1923 Å, c = 3.9838 Å). It easily leads to the formation of layered features. Therefore, controlling the morphology of the SnS absorber to obtain dense and pinhole-free grains is crucial. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the growth of cube-like SnS with micron-sized grains using the VTD method is possible by appropriately adjusting the growth pressure.19 Also, we achieved an efficiency of 2.984% using the SnS/CdS heterojunction, which is the highest efficiency ever reported so far among CdS-buffer-based SnS TFSCs.
Here, we investigate the influence of growth temperature and duration of SnS grown by VTD on the final film's morphology, preferred orientation, and the formation of secondary phases. Finally, we correlate them with device performance. Results show that a relatively low growth temperature of 550 °C led to the formation of secondary Sn2S3 and SnS2 phases, as revealed by Raman spectroscopy. When the growth temperature was 625 °C, SnS grains with a plate-like shape prevailed. A growth temperature of 600 °C was the optimal temperature for facilitating the formation of large grains while maintaining the cube-like shape, similar to CIGS or CdTe.
Furthermore, we discovered that growth duration greatly affects the preferred orientation of the SnS absorbers grown at 600 °C; as the growth duration was increased from 2 min (∼0.7 μm) to 30 min (∼3.0 μm), a gradual increase in (101) and (111) orientations was noted, accompanied by a slight drop in (120) and (021) orientations. In addition, the influence of the variation in preferred orientation of the absorber due to different absorber thicknesses was investigated by assessing the performance of SnS/CdS TFSCs. The highest efficiency of 3.93% with good uniformity between cells was achieved when the absorber thickness was ∼1.2 μm. The stability of this device under continuous illumination and damp-heat conditions was also monitored for 100 h. When the absorber was too thin (∼0.7 μm or less), poor fill factor (FF) limited the cell’s performance. When the absorber was as thick as ∼3.0 μm, overall worsening of cell parameters was observed again. Our results suggest the importance of proper control of growth temperature for obtaining phase-pure SnS, and also the importance of absorber thickness in achieving highly efficient SnS TFSCs with good stability.
2. Experimental details
VTD of SnS was performed in a conventional one-zone furnace. SnS source powder (0.3 g, 5 N) was loaded in the middle of the heating zone (200 mm), and a substrate was placed at the end of the zone. After pumping, the pressure inside the chamber was maintained at 1.4 torr. The furnace was then heated to the target temperature, i.e., 550–625 °C, for 45 min, and this temperature was maintained for 15 min unless otherwise noted. The actual temperature of the substrate was in the range of ∼480–555 °C based on the temperature ranges measured previously.19 The furnace was cooled naturally to room temperature. More information on the detailed growth of SnS by VTD and solar cell performance corresponding to growth pressure can be found elsewhere.19
The morphologies and thicknesses of the grown absorbers were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Jeol, JSM-7500F). Surface morphologies were also investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM, PSIA, XE-100). Phase identification was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, X'Pert Pro MPD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å) in Gonio scan mode. Raman spectroscopy (Tokyo Instruments, Nanofinder FLEX-G) was used to investigate the existence of secondary phases near the films' surface. The chemical bonding states of Sn in SnS were investigated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos, AXIS-Nova Ultra DLD).
Substrate-type solar cells were fabricated on Mo-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates. Conventional CBD–CdS was used as a buffer layer, and the estimated thickness of CdS was ∼45–50 nm. Subsequently, intrinsic ZnO and Al-doped ZnO layers were formed by radio frequency (RF) sputtering. A patterned top contact was made with 20 nm Ni/1.65 μm Ag using an e-beam evaporator (World vacuum, HVE-500A). After finalizing the SLG/Mo/SnS/CdS/i-ZnO/Al-doped ZnO/Ni/Ag structure, cell isolation was performed by mechanical scribing (nominal area of 0.20 cm2). A total of 12 cells were made from each sample.
Device performance was assessed using a solar simulator with AM1.5G (San-ei Electric, XES-301S, 100 mW cm−2) as an illumination source with a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. Diode quality was assessed by measuring the current density versus voltage (J–V) under dark conditions using an HP4145B SourceMeter.
Stability of the best-performing cells was estimated under continuous exposure to a light source (1 sun, McScience Inc., Xe160) and damp-heat (85 °C, 85% relative humidity) conditions, respectively. The cell performance was recorded at appropriate time intervals; 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 h. Data under light illumination were collected throughout the continuous 100 h exposure to the light source without any interruption. On the other hand, the sample for the damp-heat test was relocated from the chamber to the solar simulator for each J–V measurement. Damp-heat conditions were controlled using a hotplate (IKA, RCT-Digital) inside a humid chamber (Woojin Tech ENG, WJ-THC-503). The stability test was performed without any encapsulation.
3. Results and discussion
First, we compared the growth behavior of SnS absorbers at various growth temperatures from 550 to 625 °C at a fixed growth duration of 15 min. The morphologies and film thicknesses were monitored by SEM, as shown in Fig. 1. At the lowest temperature of 550 °C, the smallest grains were observed, as shown in Fig. 1(a). As the growth temperature increased to 575 and 600 °C, it was confirmed that larger grains developed. A significant change is evident in the SnS grown at 625 °C (Fig. 1(d)). More plate-shaped SnS grains with vertical alignment are formed, which resemble the equilibrium SnS crystal shape.24 However, this is accompanied by a large amount of open voids on the top surface. As shown in Fig. 1(e)–(h), the final thickness of SnS absorbers gradually increases with increasing growth temperature, from ∼0.4 to 4 μm.

In order to identify the phase purity of the grown SnS absorbers, XRD analysis was carried out, as depicted in Fig. 2(a). Here, the main peaks ranging from 10° to 35° were selected to check for any existence of secondary phases. Initially, no obvious peaks of Sn2S3 or SnS2 were observed, except for orthorhombic SnS. When the SnS film formed at 550 °C, the overall intensity of the peaks was observed to be low, but clearly demonstrated the formation of SnS. The low intensity could be due to the thickness of SnS being only ∼0.4 μm. Strong orthorhombic SnS peaks were obtained for SnS absorbers grown at and above 575 °C. As the deposition temperature increased, it was noted that a preference for (101) and (111) orientations prevailed, while the preference for (120) and (021) declined, especially for the absorber grown at 625 °C. In order to estimate the change in preferred orientation more quantitatively, a texture coefficient, TC(hkl), was calculated, and is summarized in Fig. 2(b). Here, TC(hkl) is defined as follows:25  where I(hkl) is the intensity of the diffraction peak, I0(hkl) is the relative intensity of the powder diffraction peak, and N is the total number of reflections. The TC ranges from 1, for a film with completely random orientation, to N for a film with a single orientation. From the calculated TC, it was confirmed that growth temperature plays a critical role in changing the preferred orientation of the final SnS absorbers. At 550 °C, it was evident that (110), (120), and (021) orientations dominated over (101) and (111) orientations. As the growth temperature increased to 575 and 600 °C, a slight decrease in TC(120) and TC(021) was noted, while TC(101) and TC(111) gradually increased. Finally, dramatic increases in TC(101) and TC(111), especially TC(101), were observed with low values of TC(120) and TC(021).

(b) Calculated TC(hkl) based on the XRD spectra. 
As the growth temperature increases, the mobility of SnS adatoms on a growing surface is enhanced.19 It is inferred that SnS absorbers minimize the total surface energy by forming more (101) than (120) surface orientations with increasing growth temperature. Stevanović et al. calculated the surface energy of orthorhombic SnS for −3 ≤ h, k, l ≤ 3 using density functional theory and the GW method.24 From the calculation, (120) and (111) orientations are reported to have the second and third lowest surface energies, which were ∼24 and ∼25 meV Å−2, respectively. The surface energy of (101) orientations, ∼27 meV Å−2, is slightly larger than that of (120). This means that the evolution of (101) planes at higher growth temperature will not decrease the total surface energy. This contradiction can be understood from the actual surface morphology of the SnS grown at 625 °C (Fig. 1(d)). Plate-shaped SnS grains tend to prevail at 625 °C, which exposes more of the basal plane of the large area plates. Such a basal plane should be the (040) plane, considering it is at right angles to the (101) plane. From the calculation, the surface energy of the (040) plane, 9.6 meV Å−2, has the lowest value among the calculated 49 surfaces.24 Therefore, it can now be understood that SnS tends to have more preferred (101) orientations when it is grown under thermodynamically favorable conditions, i.e., higher growth temperature, with more (040) planes exposed vertically.
The phase of the SnS absorbers grown at different growth temperatures was further investigated by Raman analysis, as shown in Fig. 3. The observed Raman peaks at 40, 51, 94, 165, 186, 214, 223, and 290 cm−1 correspond to the reported peaks of orthorhombic SnS.26 Interestingly, slightly different peaks were observed for the absorber grown at 550 °C. The peak at 60 cm−1 can be assigned either to Sn2S3 (ref. 27) or π-SnS (cubic phase SnS).28 In addition, undoubtedly, the observed Raman peaks at 302 and 313 cm−1 correspond to Sn2S3 and SnS2 phases.18,27 Therefore, it is concluded that the SnS absorber grown at 550 °C contains a small portion of secondary phases, although it is not detectable by normal XRD analysis (Fig. 2(a)). In the case of 575 °C-grown absorber, no obvious peak at ∼302 cm−1 was observed, while the peak at 60 cm−1 remained. For both absorbers grown at 600 and 625 °C, only the characteristic peaks for orthorhombic SnS were observed. Based on this Raman analysis combined with the XRD result of Fig. 2, it is believed that 600–625 °C is the optimal and safest temperature range for the growth of phase-pure SnS. Meanwhile, the development of large voids due to increased exposure of the (040) planes, i.e., the (101) preferred orientation, is detrimental to the efficiency of the fabricated TFSCs.19 Therefore, we fixed the growth temperature of the SnS absorber at 600 °C for further study on the thickness effect of SnS on solar cell performance.

To investigate the effect of SnS absorber thickness, we varied the growth duration of SnS from 2 to 40 min at a fixed growth temperature of 600 °C. Fig. 4(a)–(d) show the surface morphologies of SnS absorbers grown for 2, 10, 20, and 30 min, respectively. It can be seen that the SnS grain size increases with an increase in the growth duration. Moreover, longer growth duration leads to the development of plate-shaped SnS grains with marked roughness as revealed by AFM (Fig. S1†). This can be seen more clearly in the surface SEM image for SnS grown for 40 min (Fig. S2†). XRD measurements corroborate this observation, as will be discussed later. Also, more voids were observed for the SnS absorber grown for longer duration. The variation in thickness due to variation in growth duration measured by cross-sectional SEM was in the range of ∼0.7–4.0 μm (Fig. S3†).

Based on a linear fitting of the estimated thickness (Fig. 4(e)), a nearly constant growth rate of 0.08 μm min−1 was obtained for our current VTD setup. It should be mentioned that SnS growth was initiated during the ramp-up time of 45 min from room temperature to the target temperature of 600 °C, and its thickness (y-intercept) was estimated to be ∼0.6 μm by extrapolation.
XRD was used to investigate the detailed evolution of SnS grains and preferred orientation, as shown in Fig. 5(a). Also, TCs for the main peaks were calculated and are summarized in Fig. 5(b). Notably, the (120) preferred orientation is the strongest for the SnS absorber grown for the shortest duration of 2 min. As the SnS films become thicker, TCs for (110), (101), and (111) increase, while those for (120) and (021) slightly decrease. Similar to the case of increased growth temperature of SnS (Fig. 2(b)), a gradual increase in TC for (101) and (111) can be observed, although (120) is still the most-preferred orientation. No secondary peaks except for orthorhombic SnS were observed from Raman analysis as well (Fig. S4†). XPS was also used to confirm that the dominant Sn species in SnS is Sn2+ (Fig. S5†).

The effect of gradual change in SnS orientation as a function of its thickness was further investigated by fabricating SnS/CdS TFSCs. Fig. 6(a) shows the J–V characteristics of the four fabricated devices under light, which shows the best efficiency for each sample with different SnS thicknesses. Fig. 6(b) shows the plots of all the device parameters of all 12 cells for each sample, including Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), FF, and η, respectively (see Fig. S6 for all original J–V curves and Table S1† for detailed device parameters). In the case of the 2 min SnS/CdS TFSC shown in Fig. 6(a), Jsc is as high as 17.6 mA cm−2, however, both low Voc (0.207 V) and FF (0.269) led to an inferior η of 0.98%. Such low Voc and FF may have originated from high series resistance as well as poor shunting properties of the sample (Fig. S7†), considering a relatively thin SnS absorber of ∼0.7 μm with high thickness irregularity. When the growth duration increases to 10 min, a dramatic improvement in the device performance is noted: the device exhibits improved Voc (0.342 V), FF (0.580), and Jsc (19.8 mA cm−2). The highest efficiency is 3.93%, which is the highest efficiency among CdS-based SnS TFSCs reported so far.18,19 In the case of the 20 min SnS cell, the Jsc of the device remains at 20.0 mA cm−2. However, the decrease in Voc (0.299 V) and FF (0.546) led to a decreased efficiency of 3.26%. Finally, when the growth duration further increases to 30 min, more drops in both Voc (0.287 V) and FF (0.429) are noticeable. Due to the overall deterioration of the cell parameters including Jsc (18.8 mA cm−2), the efficiency finally drops to 2.31%.

Here, the cells with the highest efficiency for each sample are selected. (b) Performance parameters for all 12 cells of each sample depending on different growth durations of SnS: Voc, Jsc, FF, and η. Average values for each sample are plotted with dots. (c) J–V characteristics under dark conditions. (d) The extracted diode parameters are shunt conductance under dark conditions (GS), series resistance under dark conditions (RS), ideality factor (A), and dark saturation current density (J0). 
The cell-to-cell deviation can be seen clearly in Fig. 6(b). In the case of the 2 min TFSC, a poor Voc with large variation can be noted. The cells suffer from a poor FF of less than 0.3. As the duration of absorber growth increases to 10 min, a clear improvement in the uniformity of Voc can be observed. Here, FF appears to show the opposite trend, but it is misleading since all the 2 min TFSCs have poor FF close to 0.25. As the duration of absorber growth increases to 20 min, similar cell-to-cell uniformity for FF holds, while a slight improvement in the uniformity of Voc is noticed. In the case of the 30 min SnS TFSC, the deviation between the fabricated cells increases again, especially for Voc and FF. Meanwhile, similar deviation in Jsc is observed for each sample.
Based on the assessment of the best performance of each device (Fig. 6(a)) as well as cell-to-cell uniformity (Fig. 6(b)), it can now be concluded that a growth duration of 10 min, which corresponds to an absorber thickness of ∼1.2 μm, is the optimal duration in this study. If the thickness of the absorber is too thin (∼0.7 μm) or too thick (∼3.0 μm), the devices suffer from poor performance as well as non-uniformity issues.
One interesting parameter that attracted our attention is the trend of Voc as a function of SnS thickness. The highest Voc for the 10 min device gradually decreases as the SnS gets thicker (over 20 min). In order to understand the origin of this observation, we checked the J–V characteristics under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 6(c). Following the procedure of Hegedus et al.,29 the diode parameters such as shunt conductance under dark conditions (GS), series resistance under dark conditions (RS), ideality factor (A), and dark saturation current density (J0) were extracted and are summarized in Fig. 6(d). Our main focus was on the reverse bias region. The charge transport of all four devices in reverse bias follows linear ohmic behavior, which accounts for the shunt current due to pinholes and/or grain boundaries in the absorber.30 First, a dramatic improvement in reverse current density from 2 min to 10 min devices is noted, which is approximately over one order of magnitude. As the thickness of absorbers increases from ∼1.2 (10 min) to ∼2.1 (20 min) and finally to ∼3.0 μm (30 min), it is reasonable to expect better shunt properties. Such an improvement in shunt properties leads to an increase in Voc of TFSCs.19,31,32 In contrast, the reverse shunt current density increases sharply as the growth duration increases from 10 min to longer time. As the SnS becomes thicker, surface roughening occurs due to the formation of plate-like large grains aligned vertically, as confirmed by SEM (Fig. 4) and XRD (Fig. 5) analyses. As discussed previously for the effect of growth temperature, the increased (101) and (111) orientations with large grains expose more (040) planes vertically. Such a morphological change leads to increased shunt leakage in the cells, as confirmed from J–V characteristics under dark conditions (Fig. 6(c)). This observation indicates that pinholes or highly-conducting extended grain boundaries are likely responsible for the gradual drop in Voc and FF.
Moreover, it can also be inferred that the actual junction areas for (101), (111), and (040) SnS grains with n-type CdS will increase for the thicker SnS absorber. According to the calculation of Stevanović et al.,24 the conduction band minima, i.e., electron affinities, for (120) and (021) planes in SnS are located at ∼4.4 and ∼4.6 eV from the vacuum level, respectively. In contrast, the affinities for (101), (111), and (040) planes are ∼4.1, ∼4.0, and ∼3.8 eV, respectively, and they are all smaller than those for (120) and (021) planes. Considering the reported affinity of ∼4.5 eV for CdS,33 the thicker SnS absorbers would make a larger cliff-type interface on average with the CdS buffer layer, i.e., a larger negative CBO. In order to explain this experimentally, we used XPS to measure and calculate the actual CBO between SnS/CdS interfaces, where absorbers were grown for 2 and 30 min.34 These samples were selected since they are expected to show the largest differences. The CBO was calculated to be −0.20 and −0.25 eV for 2 min SnS/CdS and 30 min SnS/CdS, respectively (Fig. S8–S10†). Indeed, a larger negative CBO was obtained for the thicker SnS. However, considering the accuracy and resolution of XPS measurements for the calculation of CBO, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn at this point. The mixture of various SnS surfaces with large spatial fluctuations will obviously weaken the actual CBO difference during measurement. Also, it cannot be ruled out that the thinner SnS absorber would have larger concentrations of photogenerated carriers, which causes more splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels and would lead to the observed higher Voc.35
Finally, the working stability under continuous illumination and damp-heat conditions was investigated for the best cell in this study. As summarized in Fig. 7, the efficiency drops down to 70–80% of the original efficiency for both conditions. Then, it gradually recovers its original value after the duration of 100 h. The decreased efficiency at the initial stage was more attributed to the decrease in Voc compared to Jsc (Fig. S11†). This result also suggests the good stability of the fabricated SnS/CdS TFSCs under working conditions.

4. Conclusions
The influence of growth temperature and duration on SnS absorbers grown by VTD was investigated. A low growth temperature of 550 °C led to the inclusion of detrimental secondary phases such as Sn2S3 and SnS2, as revealed by Raman analysis. A too-high growth temperature of 625 °C facilitated the crystal growth of SnS, but it exposed a large number of open voids. 600 °C was revealed to be the optimal temperature. When the growth duration was varied from 2 to 30 min, a gradual change in morphology was observed. For the thinner film, the SnS absorber maintained the strong (120) preferred orientation. As the absorber became thicker, more (101) and (111) grains developed. Such a variation in preferred orientation could explain the gradual decrease in Voc with thicker SnS absorbers. A too thin absorber grown for 2 min suffered from strong shunting and severe series resistance of the device. Also, the cell with a thick SnS absorber (30 min) suffered from overall worsening, especially in Voc and FF. This was ascribed to the increased shunting due to large voids as well as potentially unfavorable band offset. The highest efficiency of 3.93% with good cell-to-cell uniformity was achieved with a moderately thick SnS absorber of ∼1.2 μm, which corresponds to the duration of 10 min. Good stability of the fabricated cell was also confirmed under continuous illumination and damp-heat conditions. Our results emphasize the importance of controlling the morphology of SnS absorbers for realizing highly efficient SnS TFSCs.
