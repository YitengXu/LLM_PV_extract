    , Accepted 26th October 2020First published on 29th October 2020AbstractNew isomeric sensitizers containing an imine–carbene (IC)-based ancillary ligand, isomers IC101 and IC102, were designed for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These ruthenium complexes were synthesized and isolated using simple purification methods. The DSSCs sensitized with IC101 and IC102 exhibited overall conversion efficiencies of 6.32% and 6.59%, respectively. Although these two isomers gave similar device output, reduction in the power conversion efficiency (5.52%) was observed when the cell was fabricated using a 1:1 mixture of both sensitizers. The results highlight the importance of isomeric purity of the sensitizing complexes to gain high performance DSSCs.
Introduction
Various forms of energy, which can be produced from natural resources such as wind, solar and hydrothermal, are in great demand for their green and clean output. Among them, solar energy in its abundant form is deemed to fulfil the planet's increasing need for energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the important technologies developed to harness energy from sunlight and are popular for their inexpensive and environmentally friendly production.1–14 In their first report, O’Regan and Grätzel modeled the DSSC design using ruthenium(II) polypyridine complexes as sensitizing dyes and achieved breakthrough efficiencies, thus starting a new avenue in solar technologies.15–21 Since then, the solar energy field has witnessed several variant modifications based on inorganic complexes,22–28 metal-free organic structures29,30 and zinc porphyrins as sensitizers,31–36 all with the aim to trend DSSC technology towards commercialization. Apart from these alternations, perovskite solar cells have also emerged as another new potential method to convert light energy into electric energy.37,38 The ruthenium(II) polypyridine complexes such as N3,39,40N719,26,41 and black dyes23,27 were considered as the parent dyes and have shown good power conversion efficiencies. Improvements in the molecular designs with the focus to enhance absorptivity and long-term stability have surfaced the dyes, which can convert sun-to-electricity more efficiently.42–49 Most of these designs utilized the structure of the bipyridyl or polypyridyl cores of the ruthenium complexes.50–53 The sensitizers containing anionic organometallic bonds known as cyclometalated dyes were also constructed.54–56 These dyes offered good stability and unprecedented control of the frontier molecular orbitals.
In our pioneering work, we have developed a high-efficiency ruthenium dye bearing a carbene ligand, which gave a new platform for the engineering of the ligands constituted with organometallic bonds.57–60 We also develop the first heteroleptic pyridylimine ancillary ligand-based ruthenium(II) complexes as sensitizers for DSSCs, which presented another alternative approach to engineering new sensitizing dyes.61 In continuation of altering the design, we combine our previous findings and design a new imine–carbene (IC) ancillary ligand to synthesise ruthenium isomeric complexes. The IC ligand-based complexes are already well known for their use as efficient catalyst candidates and it will be interesting to explore their sensitizing properties in DSSCs.62,63 According to the literature report,64 different isomers of ruthenium complexes affect the device performance differently. With the use of an IC-based ligand, we could successfully synthesise two ruthenium complexes as isomers (IC101 and IC102, Fig. 1). The two sensitizers are constituted by similar chemical structures but differ in the molecular arrangement around the central ruthenium metal. Unlike some other isomers of ruthenium complexes,64,65 isomers of IC-based ruthenium complexes are comparatively easy to separate. Herein, we wish to report the complete photophysical and the structure–efficiency relationship studies of these isomers, as individuals (IC101 and IC102) and as an isomeric mixture (IC101 + IC102), on their corresponding DSSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic protocol toward the ruthenium(II) imine–carbene complexes IC101 and IC102 are shown in Scheme 1, while the detailed synthetic procedures are provided in the experimental section. Synthesis of isomers (IC101 and IC102) was started with first synthesizing their corresponding esters. Compound 166 was reacted with (Z)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)benzimidoyl chloride (2) to afford an imidazole salt. The salt was then treated with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 in the presence of silver(I) oxide (Ag2O) in CH2Cl2 followed by 4,4′-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine in 1,2-dichloroethane and then with KSCN in a solution of H2O/DMF at 80 °C. The reaction resulted in column separable esters 3a and 3b in a 1:1 isomeric ratio (overall 30% yield). Hydrolysis of the ester 3a was carried out using NaOH to produce the sensitizer IC101 (95% yield), whereas hydrolysis of ester 3b was performed using LiOH to get the sensitizer IC102 (91% yield).

Optical properties

Fig. 2 shows absorption spectra of IC101 and IC102 in CH3CN/t-BuOH solutions (a) and on films (b). The corresponding data are listed in Table 1. The sensitizer IC101 showed one broad band ranging from 350 to 700 nm. The absorption spectrum of the IC102 sensitizer is slightly blue shifted when compared to that of IC101 but appeared as two bands centred around 403 nm and 522 nm. These two bands can be ascribed to intra-ligand π–π* transitions with some contribution from the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) band and MLCT transition, respectively.57,58,61 The molar extension coefficient (ε) of higher energy band of the dye IC102 (403 nm, ε = 0.83 × 104 M−1 cm−1) is larger, while the ε of the MLCT band (522 nm, ε = 0.58 × 104 M−1 cm−1) is similar when compared to that of the IC101 sensitizer (520 nm, ε = 0.55 × 104 M−1 cm−1). The difference in the absorption profiles of IC101 and IC102 indicates that the electronic transitions of these isomers have been affected by the arrangement of IC ligand around the central metal. The visible spectrum of the IC101 sensitizer adsorbed onto the TiO2 film appeared as a single peak (486 nm) and slightly blue shifted instead of the broad band observed when measured in solution. For the absorption spectrum of the sensitizer IC102 on the film, a similar phenomenon was detected as in solution with little blue shifts (401 nm and 493 nm) in the absorption peaks. To study the effect of isomeric impurities on the electronic transitions, we measure absorption of the TiO2 film (Fig. 2b) incorporated by the 1:1 mixture of both isomers (IC101 + IC102). The film absorption spectrum of IC101 + IC102 showed lower absorption compared to those of both IC101 and IC102 sensitizers. Unlike IC101 dye, the visible spectrum of IC101 + IC102 showed two distinct bands contributed from intra ligand π–π* transitions and MLCT transition. The higher energy band appeared at around 400 nm with lower absorption than that of IC102. The MLCT band can be seen at 500 nm, which is lower in absorption compared to IC101 but higher than that of the IC102 dye.

Electrochemical studies
The electron transfer process in the DSSC largely depends on energy levels, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), of the sensitizer. These parameters can be calculated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the respective dye. The photooxidized dye regeneration could be achieved effectively if the location of the HOMO energy level is sufficiently positive, while the efficient electron injection could be attained if the LUMO energy level well matched to the TiO2 conduction band edge. The oxidation potentials of IC101 and IC102 were determined to be 0.25 and 0.36 eV, respectively (Table 1). The higher oxidation value of IC102 sensitizer indicates that its HOMO energy level is stabilized more than that of IC101. The HOMO energy level of the sensitizer IC101 appeared at 5.05 eV, whereas IC102 showed a much lower HOMO energy level (5.16 eV) than that of IC101. The LUMOs of the two isomers IC101 and IC102 exhibited a similar behaviour and the calculated energy gaps were found to be 1.60 eV and 1.67 eV, respectively. The LUMO values indicate that the electron injection from the excited dye into the TiO2 conduction band is slightly better for the IC102 sensitizer than that of the IC101 dye. Nevertheless, the energy levels of both the sensitizers are energetically favorable for electron injection and dye regeneration.
In order to gain better insight on the electronic structure of IC-based sensitizers, we performed DFT calculations of IC101 and IC102. The obtained frontier orbitals are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The HOMO, HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 of both the dyes (IC101 and IC102) feature significant contributions from the NCS ligands. The electrons on the LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 of IC101 and IC102 are localized homogeneously on the 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid 2,2′-bipyridine anchoring ligand. The DFT computed HOMO–LUMO energy gap of IC101 (1.42 eV) is lower than that of IC102 (1.55 eV) by 0.13 eV. These values are in excellent agreement with those obtained from CV.
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the efficiency performance of the new IC-based sensitizers, the photovoltaic properties of the solar cells anchored with the IC101 and IC102 dyes were measured under simulated AM 1.5 solar illumination. Also, to evaluate the effect of isomeric impurity on the overall cell performance, the device was fabricated using a mixture of both (IC101 + IC102) with an equal ratio. For efficiency comparison, a device performance of the standard N719 dye was also studied under the same conditions. All the corresponding data, the short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc), open-circuit voltages (Voc), fill factors (FFs), and overall power conversion efficiencies (η) of these devices, are summarised in Table 2. The photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) curves measured under forward scan and IPCEs of DSSCs with the IC101, IC102, IC101 + IC102 and N719 sensitizers are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The IC101-based DSSC gave a Jsc of 14.06 mA cm2, Voc of 0.680 V, FF of 0.661, and η of 6.31%. Its isomer dye IC102 displaced similar Voc (0.680 V) with little higher Jsc (15.36 mA cm2), as a result of slightly higher η (6.59%). The cell based on IC101 + IC102 exhibited a Jsc of 13.07 mA cm2, Voc of 0.660 V, FF of 0.639, and η of 5.51%. Usually, the Jsc value reflects the dye adsorption, whereas Voc their aggregation on the surface of TiO2. The reduction in the Jsc and Voc and thus the efficiency of the DSSC anchored with mixed isomers (IC101 + IC102) compared to that of each isomer (IC101 or IC102) indicates the presence of some aggregation. The IPCE spectra of DSSCs sensitized with IC101, IC102, IC101 + IC102, and N719 were also measured and are shown in Fig. 3b. All these IPCE curves exhibited common broad characteristics that covered almost the entire visible spectrum (from 350 to 750 nm). The IPCE maxima for these dyes were found in the order of N719 > IC102 > IC101 ∼ IC101 + IC102. The IPCE maximum of newly synthesized sensitizer IC101 reached to 56% at 525 nm, and showed a performance of over 50% in the range from 435 to 595 nm. Its isomer IC102 showed increased absorption, reaching up to 65% at 525 nm, and showed a performance over 60% in the range from 415 nm to 560 nm. The higher IPCE of IC102 when compared to its isomer IC101 suggests that there might be slightly more electron donation to the conduction band of the TiO2 film upon photoexcitation. The IPCE of the mixture of these isomers IC101 + IC102 showed similar absorption to that of IC101 with the maximum reaching 57% at 515 nm. Our results suggest that having the isomeric purity of sensitizing complexes is an important factor that contributes to the overall efficiencies of DSSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the current article demonstrates the first successful design of IC-based ruthenium sensitizers and their application in DSSC. Using the new IC-ligand, two isomers of ruthenium sensitizers can be easily isolated with inexpensive purification techniques. The DSSC incorporated with one of the isomers exhibited respectable 6.59% overall conversion efficiency. Comparative studies of their photovoltaic parameters, as individuals and an isomeric mixture, emphasized the importance of the purity of complexes towards obtaining high performance DSSCs. The IC-ligand holds good promises towards building efficient sensitizers and further fine tuning could give enhancement in the efficiency and long-term stability. All the possible structural integrations in their design are currently under progress.
Experimental
Synthesis of esters 3a and 3b
Compound 1 (236.90 mg, 1.22 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of the iminoyl chloride 2 (290.05 mg, 1.19 mmol) in dry THF (5.95 mL) over a period of 5 min. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 67 h, during which the product was slowly precipitated as a yellow-white solid. After removal of the solvent by filtration the crude product was washed with dry THF (3 × 15 mL) and dried under reduced pressure. After dissolving the crude compound (416 mg, 0.952 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (9.52 mL), Ag2O (110 mg, 0.48 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature in the dark for 4 h. After completion, MeOH (5 mL) was added and the solution was filtered through Celite. To the filtrate, [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (292 mg, 0.476 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was diluted with MeOH (10 mL) and filtrated through Celite. The solution was then evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained solid was mixed with 4,4′-dimethoxy-carbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine (242 mg, 0.89 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (50 mL) and the reaction was maintained overnight at 80 °C. After completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to get a crude compound, which was dried and used for the next step. The crude compound and potassium thiocyanate (864.90 mg, 8.90 mmol) were dissolved in H2O/DMF (9:1, 49.45 mL) and heated at 85 °C for 8 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the solvent was evaporated. The resulting solid was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (50 mL), filtered and the organic phase was washed with H2O (3 × 50 mL), dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated. The residue was purified through column chromatography on silica (EtOAc/CH2Cl2 = 1/19, v/v) and then recrystallized (ether/CH2Cl2) to afford 3a as deep-red crystals (424 mg, 39%) and 3b as a deep black solid (118.94 mg, 11%).
