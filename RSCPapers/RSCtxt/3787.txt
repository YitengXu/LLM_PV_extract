    , Accepted 16th May 2022First published on 19th May 2022AbstractThe fulfilment of simultaneous hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in acidic conditions is one of the challenges facing the production of green hydrogen. Herein, robust electrocatalysts using a heterostructure of Ni-sulphide (NiS, NiS2 and Ni3S2) and -selenide (NiSe) supported on Ni-foam (NF) have been developed via the simple single-step thermal diffusion of S and Se. Among the various prepared hierarchical structures, Ni3S2@NiSe/NF shows the best catalytic activity for the HER, with low overpotentials of 103 and 289 mV at current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. It shows a promising Tafel slope of 74.2 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 for the HER. The same structure also shows remarkable OER activity in acidic conditions, with an overpotential of 0.26 V (vs. RHE) at 50 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 68.9 mV dec−1. The density functional theory (DFT)-based approach reveals that the Ni3S2@NiSe heterointerface exhibits a very low adsorption free energy for hydrogen at the cathode and strong electron localization across its interface, which facilitates the charge-transfer kinetics at the anode to improve the sluggish OER rate. In addition, its excellent HER performance results from the strong hybridization of the Ni d orbitals with the S and Se p orbitals, destabilizing their antibonding characteristics.
1. Introduction
Green hydrogen has emerged as one of the best alternative fuels according to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) to mitigate global climatic problems arising from the predominant consumption of fossil fuels.1,2 There are two common methods for producing hydrogen fuel, viz. steam–methane reforming (‘grey’ hydrogen carbon footprint) and electrolysis of water (‘blue’ or ‘green’ hydrogen, using non-renewable or renewable electrical energy, respectively). Water electrolysers generally operate at 1.8–2.0 V, which is larger than the theoretical value of 1.23 V due to the associated thermodynamically uphill reaction. An electrocatalyst assists in reducing the thermodynamic barrier (as the overpotential or additional potential required above 1.23 V) of either the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Alternatively, the use of a bifunctional electrocatalyst can simultaneously reduce the overpotential of the HER and OER to perform overall water splitting. The benchmark electrocatalysts for the HER and OER are mainly noble or precious metals and their compounds, such as Pt, Ir, IrO2, and RuO2. This hinders the implementation of hydrogen as a fuel on the industrial scale.3–10 Between these two half-reactions, the OER process at the anode suffers from sluggish charge-transfer kinetics. This is due to the involvement of a four-step electron transfer process, resulting in a high overpotential.11 This reaction is enhanced in an acidic environment; however, most OER catalysts are unstable in such corrosive environments.12 Moreover, the HER rate in alkaline environment is much slower than that in acidic environments due to the poor conductivity of hydroxide ions (<200 S cm2 mol−1) compared to that of hydronium ions (≥350 S cm2 mol−1).13 Therefore, the search for versatile bifunctional electrocatalysts that work either in acidic or alkaline media with equitable performance is a challenge for the scientific community. Among the various pH-specific electrolysers, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers, which work in acidic conditions, offer additional advantages over alkaline systems such as lower ohmic losses, higher efficiency, higher purity of H2, simpler system design, higher current density at lower applied potential and faster response to initiate the reactions.14 To date, a limited number of bifunctional electrocatalysts that are suitable for acidic media have been reported.15 Most of them are based on precious metals, such as IrS/IrRu,16 IrW,17 Ir-nanoparticles,18 Ir-nanowires,19 and IrNi.20 Conversely, first-row transition metals such as Mo, Fe, Co, and Ni and their oxides, chalcogenides (sulphides/selenides), and phosphides are potential substitutes for noble metals due to their low cost and intrinsic activities. Although a majority of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts have been developed using MoS2 and its microstructural variants, their catalytic activity is usually limited to only the metallic 1T form and they have poor electrical conductivity in their 2H and non-crystalline forms.21 In contrast, the sulphides and selenides of nickel occurring in mineral forms (such as heazlewoodite Ni3S2) exhibit superior metallic conductivity due to the existence of a Ni–Ni network in their structure and the high density of states of d-electrons in their upper valence band.22 Recently, various nickel-based materials have been reported as multifunctional catalysts for the HER and OER; however, their catalytic activity and durability still need to be improved. Nickel chalcogenides with various phases possess a unique oxidation state, which enhances their electrocatalytic performance because of the multiple valences of nickel atoms and lower electronegativity difference between nickel (1.91 eV) and sulphur (2.58 eV). Moreover, sulphur- and selenium-based compounds are said to deliver the best catalytic efficiency owing to their low resistivity, small bandgap and higher degree of covalency in the metal–anion bonds.23 Nickel sulphides (NiS, NiS2 and Ni3S2) have been widely considered as OER electrocatalysts, but their HER performance is not up to the mark. For this reason, nickel sulphides as a single system cannot exhibit bifunctional activity.24 However, selenides of nickel have been found to exhibit both HER and OER activity.25–27 A heterointerface, which is a coupled interface between two dissimilar crystal structures with a limited spatial extent, often provides better charge-transfer characteristics compared to its bulk counterparts.28 In addition, hierarchical heterostructures, such as those grown on a conductive support, offer the extra advantage of modulating the electronic structure of covalently bonded atoms at the interface, which directly affect the electron localization and subsequently the bonding/anti-bonding characteristics of the adsorbed hydrogen. Furthermore, growing an electrocatalyst directly on a Ni-foam conductor results in unique features such as light weight, high catalytic loading and geometric surface area, high porosity (high diffusivity for electrolytes), intrinsic strength and good electrical properties.29–32 Zhao et al. showed that Ni3N and Ni3S2 heterostructures grown in situ on Ni-foam interfaces facilitated electron transfer for optimized electrocatalytic water splitting.33 Xin et al. hydrothermally synthesized an NiSe/Ni3Se2@NF heterostructure for the alkaline HER, requiring an overpotential of just 336 mV to achieve an ultrahigh current density of 1250 mA cm−2.34 However, the industrial application of any bifunctional electrocatalyst demands high exchange current densities in both the HER and OER regimes.
Herein, we report various heterointerfaces of nickel sulphides and selenides supported by Ni-foam (NF) that have been developed by a simple co-sulfurization/selenization (co-SS) route. The developed heterostructure of Ni3S2@NiSe/NF exhibits highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for overall water electrolysis in an acidic medium and holds promise for achieving industrial-scale current density and scalability. The changes in the oxidation states, composition and kinematics have been investigated in detail. The source of the improved electron transfer properties across the heterointerfaces and the corresponding enhanced hydrogen adsorption–desorption mechanisms have been explained using density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Nickel (Ni)-foam (50 ppi, 2 mm thickness), sulphur powder and selenium pellets (<4 mm, ≥99.99% trace metal basis) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Bangalore, India. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium tetrahydridoborate (NaBH4) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) were purchased from Merck, Mumbai, India. All chemicals were used without further purification. Deionized water (DI water) with a resistivity of more than 18 MΩ cm was obtained from a Milli-DI® Water Purification System.
2.2. Synthesis of Ni3S2@NiSe/NF by sulfurization and selenization
A schematic of the sulfurization and selenization process on Ni-foam at different temperatures using the rapid thermal processing (RTP) unit from Advanced Process Technology Pvt. Ltd (India) is shown in Fig. 1a and the co-sulfurization and selenization (co-SS) temperature profile used in the process is shown in Fig. 1b. The Ni-foam was sulfurized and selenized at different temperatures of 400 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C for 15 min with a 10 min ramp in a closed-space diffusion environment in the presence of elemental sulphur (S) and selenium pellets (Se). In a typical synthesis, as-received Ni-foam (1 cm × 0.5 cm) was immersed in 6 M HCl for 10 min to remove any formed oxide layers on its surface due to air oxidization, followed by ultrasonic cleaning in DI water and acetone. The cleaned Ni-foam was dried in a stream of Ar gas and loaded immediately in the RTP system. 1 g S/Se powder was placed in a quartz boat in the upstream position. Then, the diffusion space was evacuated and purged 3 times with ultrapure Ar to remove any remaining O2. The co-SS process was performed under closed-space conditions in the presence of Ar with a partial pressure of 0.1 mbar and the heating profile is shown in Fig. 1b. The dwell time for all cases was 15 min and the samples were allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. Then, the samples were removed from the furnace below 60 °C and stored in a vacuum desiccator. The samples synthesized at the diffusion temperatures of 400 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C are denoted as NX400C, NX500C and NX600C, respectively.

2.3. Characterization

2.3.1. Structure and morphology. 
The surface morphology of the electrode samples was investigated using FE-SEM (Zeiss, model ULTRA) with 5.0 kV acceleration voltage. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to study the chemical composition of the as-prepared electrode with a Cu-Kα source (λ = 1.5418 Å). The Raman spectra were recorded using a confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw, UK, model inVia) with a 532 nm laser of 2.5 mW power and 30 s exposure time. An ESCA+ Omicron Nano Technology X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray source was used to collect information on the chemical composition and valence states of the compounds. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) were carried out on a TEM instrument (Tecnai, G2 20 S-TWIN, FEI, at 200 kV). The ratio of elemental fractions in the catalyst electrode was determined by wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) spectroscopy using a WD-XRF instrument (Panalytical, model Axios Max).


2.3.2. Electrochemical measurements. 
All the electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature using a potentiostat–galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research, Ametek India, model PARSTAT) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte in a standard three-electrode electrochemical setup. An Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M saturated KCl) and graphite electrode (6 mm dia.) were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The as-prepared electrodes were used directly as working electrodes without any binder. The catalyst loading on the Ni-foam was determined by considering the weight difference on the electrode before and after the sulfurization/selenization process, which was determined to be ca. 1.16 mg cm−2 for NX600C. The solutions were degassed by purging highly pure Ar gas for 30 min before each measurement. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 from 0 to −0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl for the HER and 0 to 1.2 V versus Ag/AgCl for the OER to obtain the polarization curves. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out by applying a 0.2 V vs. RHE overpotential and an amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. All the potentials reported herein were iR corrected according to ohmic losses and converted to RHE by the Nernst equation, as follows: E = E0Ag/AgCl + 0.059 × pH(1)
The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) measurements were carried out via cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different scan rates in the range of 20–100 mV s−1 in the non-faradaic voltage range of −0 to −0.25 V vs. RHE. Additionally, the turnover frequency (TOF) per surface active site was calculated for the HER and OER according to the theory, as provided in the ESI† (Section S1).

2.4. Computational details
The Atomistic Tool Kit (ATK) from Virtual Nanolab® was used as the computation platform to explain the electrocatalytic generation of hydrogen by the supported transition metal dichalcogenide edges in the context of density functional theory (DFT). The ATK package uses a semiempirical approach based on the extended Huckel method (EHM). This is a non-orthogonal tight-binding (non-OTB) method based on a semi-empirical approach, which is better suited for estimating the electronic structure of covalently bonded crystals forming heterostructures and is computationally less expensive than the more rigorous GW-approximation. EHM, in contrast to OTB, was applied to specific atomic-orbital-like basis functions, which were utilised to create the matrix elements S and H, namely the overlap matrix and the Hamiltonian, correspondingly, where only the diagonal matrix members were altered. The onsite energy was calculated according to the following expressions, assuming that the Hamiltonian depends linearly on the overlap function.35Hii = Eii    
Here, i and j refer to two atomic orbitals and Sij is the overlap matrix between the orbital basis functions ϕi and ϕj, respectively. KEHM is a parameter usually set at 1.75 for molecules and 2.3 for solids.36 The supercells of NiSe, Ni3S2, NiS, NiS2 and the Ni3S2@NiSe interface were created and their projected densities of states (PDOS) were determined on the strain-relaxed optimized structures. The supercell of Ni3S2 consists of a rhombohedral unit cell with lattice constants of a = b = c = 4.060 Å, whereas the NiSe supercell consists of rhombohedral unit cells with lattice constants of a = b = c = 5.880 Å. The PDOS for all cases were determined on the set of 7 × 7 × 7 optimized Monkhorst-Pack k-points.37 The density mesh cut-off energy was 105 Hartree, and the Fermi level was set at 0 eV in all calculations.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphologies and structure
The rapid thermal process (RTP) used in the co-sulfurization/selenization (co-SS) process offers the special advantage of precise control of the S/(S + Se) ratio, and has been previously used in the development of CIGS and CZTS solar cell materials.38,39 By varying the dwell temperature, distinct sulphide, selenide and sulpho-selenide phases with different morphologies have been previously reported in solar cell materials40 and this strategy has been found to be useful in the present study. The RTP-assisted co-SS process adapted on the Ni-foam affords three types of structures with specific morphologies, as evident from the XRD and FE-SEM analyses. Fig. 2 shows the topographical FE-SEM images of the NiS/NF (a/d), NiS2/NF (b/e) and NI3S2@NiSe/NF (c/f) heterointerface electrodes fabricated via co-sulfurization/selenization at 400 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C, respectively. At low magnification, the bare Ni-foam shows a porous 3D network, which is well maintained after sulfurization and selenization. However, at a higher magnification, the bare Ni-foam exhibits a very smooth surface decorated with grains of Ni (Fig. S1†). Sulfurization and selenization of the bare Ni-foam at different temperatures results in different morphologies and compositions. At 400 °C, the smooth structure of the Ni-foam is transformed into the bead-like structure of NiS due to sulphur vapour possibly being trapped inside the beads. At a higher temperature (500 °C), the sulphur vapour starts to get released, resulting in an increase in the sulphur content and enhanced roughness of the Ni-foam. Further, at an even higher temperature (600 °C), the formation of a heterostructure takes place due to the kinematics of sulphur and selenium, forming a porous channel-like morphology of Ni3S2 over truncated sheets of NiSe. At a lower temperature, the diffusion of selenium vapour on Ni-foam is not significant compared to that of sulphur vapour, which is because of the higher sublimation temperature of selenium compared to that of sulphur (boiling point of sulphur ∼444 °C and selenium ∼685 °C, and sulphur sublimates between 95 and 118 °C). Moreover, the electron affinity of sulphur is greater than that of selenium (2.07 eV). Thus, at lower temperatures, the sulphur vapour reacts with the Ni-foam and results in the formation of nickel sulphide. The cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the heterointerface electrodes are shown in Fig. S2.† The interfaces were observed to be sharp, without any substantial nonuniformity in all the samples. The elemental analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) colour mapping further confirmed the presence of the elements Ni, S and Se with a small fraction of O, as shown in Fig. 2g1–4. The extremely porous and rough surface quality enhances the contact between the electrolyte and active materials, which facilitates the diffusion of ions in the process.

Fig. 2h1–3 shows the TEM images of the best-performing bifunctional electrocatalyst NX600C at both low and high magnifications. Fig. 2h2 clearly shows the crystal planes of Ni3S2 and NiSe, indicating the proposed heterostructure formation in the configuration of Ni3S2@NiSe/NF. The inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) pattern taken at different segments further confirms the presence of the (021) and (003) crystal planes with a d-spacing of 2.62 and 2.37 Å, respectively. This is in good agreement with their respective XRD patterns with reference to the JCPDS files [JCPDS No.: 65-3325, 65-3425 and 18-0887]. The presence of comparable d-spacing values for the (003) crystal plane of Ni3S2 and the (021) plane of NiSe supports the existence of the desired heterointerfaces. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, as seen in Fig. 2h4, further confirms the trigonal crystal structures of Ni3S2 and NiSe.
The crystal structures and phases of the developed systems were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 3a. All the samples were highly crystalline, as evident from the sharp characteristic peaks. As shown in Fig. 3a, the peaks at 2θ = 45.0° and 51.9° are the characteristic peaks of Ni-foam, corresponding to the planes (111) and (200). The peaks at 2θ = 30.1°, 34.6°, 45.9°, 53.5°, 61° and 71° are ascribed to the (100), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (004) diffraction planes of NiS, (JCPDS No.: 02-1280), respectively, for NX400C. The peaks at 2θ = 31.6°, 35.4°, 38.8°, 45.8°, 53.2°, 56.7°, 59°, 61.1° and 71.3° are ascribed to the (200), (210), (211), (220), (311), (222), (023), (321) and (331) diffraction planes of NiS2 (JCPDS No.: 65-3325), corresponding to NX500C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3a. For the NX600C sample, the peaks at 2θ = 34.4°, 43.6°, 58.5°, 61° and 70.9° correspond to the (021), (102), (103), (201) and (004) diffraction planes of NiSe (JCPDS 65-3425 and JCPDS 18-0887), while the peaks at 2θ = 37.5° and 56.1° correspond to the (003) and (300) diffraction planes of Ni3S2 (JCPDS No.: 44-1418).
The crystallinity and phase purity of the electrocatalysts were further studied with the help of Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3b. The Raman spectrum of NX600C shows the characteristic peaks at 236, 254 and 346 cm−1, which correspond to the stretching vibration modes of the Se–Se bonds in NiSe2, the Tg mode and Ni3S2 principal vibration modes.41,42 The low intensity of the Raman peaks of Ni3S2 is because of its low coverage over the NiSe layer. For NX500C, the peaks were obtained at 268, 398 and 475 cm−1, which correspond to the NiS2-Tg mode, NiS-A1 mode and NiS2-Ag modes.42,43 Additionally, NX400C shows peaks at 268, 389 and 472 cm−1, which are attributed to NiS, NiS and Ni-foam, respectively. At a higher diffusion temperature, the peaks from Ni-foam were absent, indicating that its whole surface was covered with sulphide and selenides.
3.2. Composition from XPS
The XPS survey spectra are shown in Fig. 4a, S3a and b† for NX600C, NX400C and NX500C, respectively. They clearly depict high counts from Ni, S and Se. The C 1s and O 1s signals originate from the carbon tape and surface oxidation of the samples due to air exposure and oxygen-containing functional groups in the C-matrix, respectively.44 As shown in the high-resolution XPS spectra of NX400C and NX500C (Fig. S4a and b,† respectively), they both exhibit peaks corresponding to Ni 2p and S 2p, and weak peaks from Se. The peaks located at 853.1 and 873.5 eV with their satellites at 860.6 and 880 eV are attributed to core-level Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively. This reveals that Ni exists in the +2 and +4 oxidation states in both NX400C and NX500C.45 Both samples show the presence of a peak at 55.5 eV; however, none of them reveals the doublet structure of Se 3d5/2/3d3/2 (corresponding binding energies of 54.1 and 0.8 eV higher, respectively). This peak mainly originates from the unreacted Se impurities on the surface of the structure.46 In contrast, distinct doublet peaks were found for S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 at 162.5 and 163.8 eV, respectively, confirming the formation of sulphides. This observation confirms that at a lower diffusion temperature, selenides do not form over the Ni-foam. For NX600C, deconvolution of its high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 4d) produces two strong peaks at 856.2 and 873.3 eV, which may be ascribed to core-level Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, confirming the presence of a trivalent state of Ni in Ni3S2.47 These two intense peaks demonstrate that Ni3+ is dominant. However, Ni 2p1/2 also shows a peak at a lower binding energy of 853.2 eV, indicating the existence of the divalent state of Ni in Ni3S2. Moreover, the energy difference of 17.6 eV between Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 corresponds to the co-existence of the Ni2+ and Ni3+ oxidation states in Ni3S2 according to the literature.48 The same minor peak of 853.2 eV is characteristic for NiSe, the intensity of which is low for NiSe formed under the Ni3S2 layer. The weak peaks at 861 eV and 879 eV correspond to the satellites of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2.49 The binding energy difference between Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 of 17.65 eV proves the presence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ simultaneously in the hybrid heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 4e, the strong doublet peaks at 160.9 and 162.76 eV represent S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, which are attributed to the Ni–S bonds in Ni3S2. Some of the edge-terminated sulphurs easily form C–S–C bonds with the carbon tape used, which leads to an additional peak at 164.84 eV. The weak peak at 169 eV corresponds to the satellite peak of S 2p,50 whereas the other peak at the higher binding energy of 169 eV originates from the sulphur–oxygen bonds. The presence of Se is detected in all the samples, as shown in the Se 3d spectra (Fig. S4a, b† and 4f). The existence of doublet peaks for Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 at 54.63 and 55.51 eV, respectively (binding energy difference of 0.88 eV), confirms that Se is present in the (−2) oxidation state, confirming the formation of NiSe in NX600C. Similar to the SeOx sample, the other two peaks located at 58.66 and 59.61 eV may be attributed to the surface oxidation of the Se-forming moieties.27 The elemental composition, as determined by WD-XRF measurement (summarized in Table S1†), further confirms the above-mentioned observations of structure and chemical composition.
3.3. Electrocatalytic activity
A hybrid porous electrocatalyst with high conductivity and a large number of active sites, combined with a 3D porous architecture, is predicted to exhibit good HER performance with a low overpotential, low Tafel slope, long-term durability and high exchange current density.51 The electrocatalytic HER performance of the 3D hierarchical interfaces developed herein was evaluated using a typical three-electrode system in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Fig. 5a shows the set of LSV curves recorded for various electrocatalysts at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Sample NX600C shows remarkable HER performance with low overpotentials (ηov) of 0.103 and 0.29 V at current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively, with an onset potential of 39 mV, which were much lower than those of the other two samples. NX500C and NX400C showed ηov = 0.24 and 0.28 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm−2. At a current density of 50 mA cm−2, these samples show ηov = 0.367 and 0.381 V, respectively. Moreover, to achieve an industrially significant current density of 100 mA cm−2, the required overpotential was just 0.34 V for the Ni3S2@NiSe/NF heterostructure, while it was 0.41 and 0.42 V for NX500C and NX400C, respectively. The low overpotential and high current density associated with the Ni3S2@NiSe/NF heterostructure result from the synergistic effect of fast charge transfer at the interface (discussed below) and porous channel structure of Ni3S2, which create additional active sites.
 Fig. 5  Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) characteristics: (a) polarization curves recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (arrow indicates an industrially significant current density), (b) Tafel plots, (c) double-layer capacitance (Cdl) for the evolution of the ECSA, and (d) hydrogen evolution turnover frequency (TOF) per surface site vs. overpotential for the different catalysts. (e) Nyquist plots with the equivalent circuit fit for NX600C and (f) stability plot for NX600C at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. 
The Tafel slope is one of the performance indicators of an electrocatalyst, and it was used to calculate the kinetic parameters of electrocatalytic activity in the HER investigation. A small Tafel slope correlates with an increased rate of HER, according to the Tafel equation: η = a + blog|j|(2)where η represents the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, and j is the current density.52,53Fig. 5b shows the Tafel plots for all the samples. Samples NX500C and NX400C show Tafel slopes of 77.6 and 119 mV dec−1, respectively. However, the lowest Tafel slope of 74.2 mV dec−1 is observed for the NX600C sample, which appears to be promising and comparable to that of Pt (38.7 mV dec−1). The low onset and overpotentials at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 and the low Tafel slope of the Ni3S2@NiSe/NF heterostructure may be attributed to the unique morphology and metallic NiSe on the 3D porous network, leading to abundant active sites, which will be discussed in detail in the subsequent paragraph.54–56
In order to obtain a better understanding of the available active sites for the HER on the heterointerface in contact with the electrolyte, the electrochemically effective surface area (ECSA) proportional to the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was derived from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and further used to obtain the HER turnover frequency (TOF).57,58 The recorded CV at different scan rates was used to estimate the effective Cdl of all the catalysts in the non-faradaic voltage range (excluding any redox activity). Fig. 5c shows the plot of |Δj| = 0.15 V vs. RHE at different scan rates for all the samples. NX600C shows the highest Cdl of 42 mF cm−2, followed by 11 and 16 mF cm−2 for NX400C and NX500C, respectively. The estimated TOF for H2 generation was plotted against the overpotential, as shown in Fig. 5d. NX600C shows the largest TOF of 3.7 s−1 at an overpotential of 0.17 V. This is comparable to that of the good-quality HER electrocatalysts reported in the literature.50
The charge-transfer kinetics of the heterointerfaces was further investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).59 In the electrochemical measurements, not just the charge organization or the redox reaction but the diffusion of electrolytes as well has a remarkable influence on the overall charge-transfer characteristics. The Nyquist plots of the measured complex impedance Z′′(ω) versus Z′(ω) for all the samples are shown in Fig. 5e (inset shows the proposed equivalent circuit). The corresponding fit parameters are listed in Table 1. The semicircle at the high-frequency region corresponds to the series resistance (Rs) originating from the bulk and electrolyte. The semicircle obtained in the high-frequency range is the combined result of the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and constant phase element (CPE) provided by any charge depletion across the inhomogeneity of the electrolyte–electrode interface.60,61 The semicircle in the low-frequency range also corresponds to the Nernst diffusion impedance of the coupled electrolyte. As can be seen in Fig. 2c, the prominent increase in the two semicircular features with an increase in temperature clearly indicates the formation and evolution of a layered heterostructure at higher temperatures.62 Further, a low value of Rs is observed for all the samples, which indicates easy charge separation in the electrode and electrolyte. Moreover, the low Rct values obtained for the NX600C sample, corresponding to the Ni3S2@NiSe/NF heterostructure, indicate its better charge-transfer ability and superior electrocatalytic activity.

The Bode amplitude (Z vs. frequency) and phase (ϕ vs. frequency) plots are shown in Fig. S5,† which provide a better understanding of the inhomogeneity associated with the nanostructured electrode contact. The high-frequency maximum of the phase angle indicates inhomogeneous surface layers, whereas the low-frequency maximum corresponds to the ideal kinetic behaviour (phase angle close to 90° indicates an ideal capacitor).63 In other words, the low-frequency maximum in the Bode phase plot originates from the interfaces and diffusion around the contacts, whereas the high-frequency maximum is contributed by individual grains, and any intermediate peak corresponds to the grain boundaries. As seen, the interface of NX600C with the Ni-foam and electrolyte significantly contributed to the Bode phase plot, where the maximum appears at f ∼ 1 Hz. In contrast, for NX400C and NX500C, the contribution comes mostly from their grains, and the interface to electrode or electrolyte charge transfer is not as significant as in NX600C.
The stability of electrocatalysts is another important aspect for their commercial application in long-duration operations. As shown in Fig. 5f, the stability of NX600C was tested in 0.5 M H2SO4 for 36 h at an overpotential of 103 mV. Fig. S8a† shows the LSV curve of NX600C after the HER stability test, and it can be observed that there is a slight degradation in the current density by about 1% after 36 h. Additionally, the interface and nanostructure still existed after the stability test of 36 h, as can be seen from the TEM and EDX elemental mapping images (Fig. S8b–d†), which indicates their excellent HER stability. The XPS spectra were further obtained to identify the oxidation states of NX600C after the HER stability test. As shown in Fig. S8e,† the peak positions of Ni 2p3/2 did not show any shift in binding energy compared with the original sample. An additional peak at 870.52 eV, corresponding to the +2 oxidation of Ni 2p1/2, is now clearly visible, which is possibly because of the amount of surface oxygen reduced after the long stability test in the acidic medium. This has been further confirmed from the S 2p and Se 3d spectra. The S 2p spectra show the same binding energy, corresponding to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, compared to the initial spectra, with no additional oxygen impurity. Similarly, the Se 3d spectra do not show any peaks corresponding to SeOx after the stability test; however, the broadening of the Se 3d spectra shows the slight contribution of oxygen in the spectra.
Further, the electrocatalyst also shows very good morphological stability after long-term exposure, as shown in Fig. S6.† This shows that the electrode does not suffer from any corrosion or leaching of the heterointerfaces from the Ni-foam.
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often restricted by the interdependence of the adsorption energies of the reaction intermediates, multi-electron process and surface reactivity of the electrocatalyst. This affects the degrees of freedom available for optimizing the catalysts and is responsible for its extraordinarily slow surface kinetics.64–66 For instance, the OER with a Pt electrode is about 10 times slower compared to the HER. Thus, OER catalysis is a major impediment in the conversion of electricity into fuel.67,68 Accordingly, the hybrid heterostructure of Ni3S2@NiSe/NF in our current study holds great potential to overcome the slow kinetics of the OER. The polarization curves for the OER of all the electrodes recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte are shown in Fig. 6a.
 Fig. 6  Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) characteristics: (a) polarization curves recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (arrow indicates an industrially significant current density), (b) Tafel plots, (c) stability plot for the 600C sample at a current density of −10 mA cm−2 and (d) oxygen evolution turnover frequency (TOF) per surface site for the different samples. 
The NX600C sample exhibits the best OER performance, which is characterized by overpotentials (ηov) of 0.26 and 0.307 V (vs. RHE) at current densities of 50 mA cm−2 and the industrially significant 100 mA cm−2, respectively. These values are much lower than those of NX400C and NX500C (ηov = 0.48 and 0.378 V vs. RHE, respectively) at 100 mA cm−2. The high current density hump between 1.15–1.7 V vs. RHE for NX400C and NX500C before the onset of the OER may be attributed to the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+.69 The observed current density for the OER at the applied potential appears to be much higher compared to the best-in-class OER catalysts tested in acidic conditions according to the literature. In a detailed review discussion, Reier et al. mention that a good-performing heterogeneous OER catalyst in acidic media must have the capability to accept the four electrons generated by the oxidation of water and swiftly transfer them through the catalyst/electrolyte interface.14 The heterointerfaces demonstrated herein are probably responsible for such an electron transfer, which will be discussed further in the following section.
Further, Fig. 6b shows the Tafel plots from the anodic scan. As seen, the NX600C heterostructure shows the lowest Tafel slope of 68.9 mV dec−1, while the other two catalysts show higher values of 126.6 mV dec−1 and 165 mV dec−1, corresponding to NX500C and NX400C. The low Tafel slope for OER catalysis shows the superior feature of the heterostructure in acidic conditions as well. Moreover, the stability of the NX600C heterostructure was tested at an anodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 for a duration of 36 h, where no substantial change was observed in the current density, as shown in Fig. 6c. Fig. S9a† shows the LSV curve of NX600C after the OER stability test, where it has been observed that there is a slight degradation in the current density by about 2–3% after 36 h. As seen in case of the HER, the interface and nanostructure remained unaltered here as well, as can be seen from the TEM and EDX mapping images (Fig. S9b–d†), indicating their excellent stability for the OER as well. The XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. S9e† taken after the stability test indicate that the Ni 2p3/2 peaks remain almost unchanged when compared with those of the original sample. As before, an additional peak at 870.52 eV corresponding to the +2 oxidation of Ni 2p1/2 appears, which again is likely because of the amount of surface oxygen. The S 2p spectra show the same binding energy corresponding to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 as compared to the initial spectra, with no other additional oxygen impurity, as before. Similarly, the Se 3d spectra also do not show any peaks corresponding to SeOx after the stability test.
In addition, Fig. 6d shows the TOF plot per unit area for O2 evolution, obtained using a similar methodology to that mentioned above. The TOF value for NX600C was estimated to be 4.56 s−1 at an applied overpotential of 0.27 V (vs. RHE), which was greater than that of the other samples. The observed TOF is comparable or better than that of other reported OER electrocatalysts suitable for acidic environments.70

3.4. Hydrogen adsorption–desorption mechanism by density functional theory
Mechanistic insight into the thermodynamics of the HER and OER with the free energy changes in the reactions was obtained via the density functional theory (DFT) approach. This approach also provides a clear understanding of the hydrogen bonding and antibonding mechanisms relevant to a given type of interface. Previous studies have shown that the change in the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (H* ads) on the electrocatalyst surface can be influenced by the electronic structure of the strong interface underneath it.72,76 Thus, employing DFT analysis of the effect of the Ni 3d orbitals from Ni3S2 and NiSe on the anti-bonding S, the Se 3p density of states was evaluated in detail.
The DFT-based projected densities of states (PDOS) of the different structures of Ni3S2, NiSe and the NiSe@Ni3S2 interface using the semi-empirical extended Huckel method (EHM) are shown in Fig. 7a–c, where the calculations are based in the hybridized bonding orbitals. The valence bands of Ni3S2 and NiSe are highly populated by the 3d electrons of Ni near the Fermi level (EF = 0 eV). It is found that their d band centres are located at ca. 1.32 eV and 1.44 eV, respectively, below the EF. According to the ligand field theory, the Ni d-orbitals of trigonal Ni3S2 and NiSe should split into both degenerate and non-degenerate orbital manifolds, as listed in Table 377,78

In order to understand the molecular bonding and anti-bonding states that are responsible for the catalytic activities, the molecular energy levels were calculated in primitive cells of Ni3S2, NiSe and a cluster of (NiSe1−xSx, x < 1)2, which can form at the NiSe@Ni3S2 interface and is designated to the above-mentioned orbital manifolds, as shown in Fig. 7g. According to the partial DOS, p–d hybridization was evident in all cases and conformed with previously reported 4d metal chalcogenides.78 In the case of the Se of NiSe and S of Ni3S2 with Ni-foam, the antibonding (σ*) orbitals are away from the Fermi level (0.6–1.0 eV above EF), keeping them almost unfilled and stable. When the heterostructure of NiSe@Ni3S2 evolves at a higher temperature of synthesis, the two phases start forming covalent bonds at the interface, as shown by the dashed line in Fig. 7f. This bond formation results in the coupling of the Ni 3d orbital with the S 3p and Se 4p orbitals (the d-shell of Se is full, with the configuration of [Ar]3d104s2p4).3 This p–d hybridization causes the antibonding (σ*) orbitals to move down to the Fermi level. As depicted in Fig. 7g, the newly formed antibonding orbitals, which are now quite close to the Fermi level, are partially occupied, destabilizing it and enhancing the catalytic activity in case of the NiSe@Ni3S2 interfaces. This destabilizing effect has also been reported in other mixed transition metal sulphide systems such as Co–Ni–S reported by the Lee group79 and in clusters of Fe/Co/Ni sulphides by the Rodriguez group.80 Further, in the case of NiSe, the density of states is closer to the Fermi level as compared to that in the other structures, indicating the better metallic property of NiSe, which is mainly reflected in its electrical conductivity and catalytic activity. The electron localization function (FLF) calculated for the three types of interfaces, viz. Ni/NiS, Ni/NiS2 and NiSe/Ni3S2, is shown over the projected xy-plane in Fig. 7d–f. It is interesting to note that from the ELF colour map, a high degree of covalency is found between the S–Se bonds at the NiSe/Ni3S2 interface due to the aforementioned interfacial bonding. This is expected to improve the electron delocalization and transfer it to the electrolyte interface, as also indicated by the low electron density at the crystal spaces in Ni3S2.
In addition, according to previous studies, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH) is an accurate signifier for intrinsic HER activity, where the thermo-neutral condition (ΔGH = 0) corresponds to the optimal HER activity. In order to better predict the water splitting activity, the chemisorption of hydrogen over the active surface of Ni3S2, NiSe and the Ni3S2@NiSe hybrid heterostructure was studied using the calculated chemisorption free energy (ΔGH). A quarter hydrogen coverage (1/4th monolayer) was used to study the adsorption free energy of the substructures. The three crucial steps of hydrogen evolution, i.e., the Volmer, Heyrovsky and Tafel steps, can be depicted by the respective reaction coordinates, as shown in Fig. 8a. The Ni3S2@NiSe hybrid heterostructure shows the lowest Gibbs free energy of ΔGH = −0.0022 eV compared to those of the bare Ni3S2 structure (ΔGH = −0.0794 eV) and NiSe (ΔGH = +0.0975 eV), which is very close to the thermo-neutral value. This result signifies that the Ni3S2@NiSe hybrid interface will promote water dissociation, and H-intermediate formation will be enhanced subsequently. Thus, the reduction of adsorbed H* for the formation of an H2 molecule will transpire at −0.0022 eV on the heterostructure interface. Further, the positions of these three types of heterointerfaces are shown in the well-known volcano representation (log exchange current densities vs. H-binding free energies) in Fig. 8b and their values are presented in Table 4. The results show that the sulphide–selenide interface of Ni formed at 600 °C during the co-sulfurization/selenization process holds great promise as both an HER and OER electrocatalyst. In addition to the above-mentioned lab-scale performance, the Ni3S2@NiSe interface also bears great industrial potential due to its low HER overpotentials at the industrially required current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8c).

Finally, to understand the mechanism of the fast OER kinetics in the heterointerface-based electrode, the pH of the electrolyte was measured intermittently for 5 h during the stability test in addition to the above-mentioned stability tests. As shown in Fig. S7,† the pH of the solution did not change, even by 1% of the original value. According to the literature, the mechanism of the HER at the cathode surface in an acidic medium has three possible rate-limiting steps, following the protonation of water (H3O+) and formation of adsorbed hydrogen (H*):72 H3O+ + e− → H* + H2O (Volmer step)(3) H3O+ + e− + H* → H2 + H2O (Heyrovsky step)(4) H* + H* → H2 (Tafel step)(5)
The Tafel slopes corresponding to eqn (3)–(5) are 120, 40 and 30 mV dec−1. However, the electrocatalytic OER in an acidic medium can occur via various pathways according to J. Rossmeisl,84 where only the reaction stages involving charge transfer are directly affected by the applied potential. It has been predicted that the potential only plays a minor role. This is similar to a process in which oxygen molecules are produced by an enzyme surface-based associative mechanism on the anode HOO* intermediate. Direct oxygen atom recombination is not considered because of the high activation barrier for the formation of O2. 2H2O → HO* + H2O + H+ + e−(6) → O* + H2O + 2H+ + 2e−(7) → HOO* + 3H+ + 3e− → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−(8)
The constancy of the pH, as mentioned above, suggests that reactions (3)–(8) occur at the same rate. This suggests that the OER steps, which are inherently sluggish in nature, must have been accelerated by the electron transfer kinetics across the interface of NiSe and Ni3S2. As seen in the EL map, above the higher electron density at the NiSe/Ni3S2 interface compared to the bulk Ni3S2, a built in electric field, , directed towards the NiSe/Ni3S2 interface should be produced, as shown in Fig. 9. According to the free energy expression, ΔG = −nFE0, where n is the number of moles of electrons being transferred, F is the faradaic constant (96485C mol−1) and E0 is the cell potential for the reactions under the OER, which is proportional to , the effective value of ΔG becomes lower at the interface of Ni3S2/electrolyte, causing the rate of electron transfer from the electrolyte to the Ni3S2 lattice to increase.

Conclusions
In summary, a simple method of rapid thermal diffusion-based co-sulfurization and selenization has been adopted for the preparation of a heterostructure of Ni3S2@NiSe on Ni-foam. Its composition and morphology were controlled by the temperature of sulfurization and selenization. Further, its excellent performance as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in acidic media for the HER and OER has been demonstrated by its lower overpotential and Tafel slopes compared to those of its bulk counterparts reported in the literature. Further, the increased catalytic active sites with temperature have been shown with the help of ECSA and TOF analysis. Density functional theory reveals that Ni3S2 exhibits a very low adsorption free energy for hydrogen due to the upward shift in its Ni d-band centre towards the Fermi level due to the presence of the hybridised p-orbital of Se from the underlying NiSe resulting in superior H adsorption/desorption capability. The heterointerface largely facilitates better electron localization and faster charge transfer of the adsorbed charged species for overall water splitting.
