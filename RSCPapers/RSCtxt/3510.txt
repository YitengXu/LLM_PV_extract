    , Accepted 17th June 2022First published on 17th June 2022AbstractCs,Rh-codoped WO3 showed photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution from an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm, although the activities of nondoped, Rh-doped, and Cs-doped WO3 were negligible. The optimized WO3 codoped with Cs (5 mol%) and Rh (0.5 mol%) responded to visible light up to 600 nm. Moreover, the Cs,Rh-codoped WO3 was successfully applied as an O2-evolving photocatalyst for Z-schematic water splitting into H2 and O2 stoichiometrically with a H2-evolving photocatalyst and an Fe3+/2+ redox mediator under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm.
Introduction
Hydrogen production by solar water splitting using powder photocatalysts is a promising technology for solving energy, environmental, and resource issues. However, the photocatalyst must be responsive to visible light in a wide wavelength range to ensure efficient utilization of sunlight. Therefore, various visible-light-driven photocatalysts have been developed for water splitting systems.1–9

Z-schematic water splitting systems are useful to utilize photocatalysts with narrow band gaps (BGs). Powder-based Z-schematic water splitting systems are constructed with a H2-evolving photocatalyst, an O2-evolving photocatalyst, and a redox electron mediator, as shown in Fig. 1(a). We have also developed a photocatalysis–electrolysis hybrid system, which is one type of Z-schematic water splitting system, as shown in Fig. 1(b).10–13 In both systems, photogenerated electrons in the O2-evolving photocatalysts flow to the valence band of the H2-evolving photocatalyst or the electrolysis anode via an electron mediator. Therefore, it is important to develop a highly efficient photocatalyst for O2 evolution from an aqueous solution containing a redox mediator. An Fe3+/2+ redox has been utilized as an electron mediator for various Z-schematic water splitting systems because of its numerous advantages such as low cost, stability, and absence of side reactions.14–17 We reported that an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution was better for O2 evolution than other aqueous solutions containing Fe3+/2+ ions.18 However, the variety of metal oxides with narrow BGs is very limited. Cs–WO3 (BG 2.7 eV),10,18 BiVO4 (BG 2.4 eV),12 and WO3-loaded TiO2:Cr,Sb (EG 2.1–2.2 eV, denoted as WO3/TiO2:Cr,Sb)19 show high photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution from an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution under visible light irradiation. Moreover, only WO3/TiO2:Cr,Sb can respond up to 600 nm. Therefore, it is significant to develop a novel photocatalyst that produces O2 from the aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution using visible light in a wide wavelength range.

WO3 is a representative O2-evolving photocatalyst for Z-schematic water splitting under visible light irradiation.16 Pt–WO3 was the first photocatalyst to be used as an O2-evolving photocatalyst for Z-schematic water splitting under visible light irradiation.20 Since then, WO3 has been applied to various Z-schematic water splitting systems.16 We have also reported the use of Cs–WO3,21–23 which shows high photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution from an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution under visible light irradiation.18 However, Cs–WO3 responds to light up to 450 nm, indicating an utilization of only about 8% of the solar light irradiation. Therefore, the responsive wavelength of the WO3 photocatalyst should be expanded so as to efficiently utilize sunlight.
Rh doping is a useful method for expanding the responsive wavelength of a photocatalyst. In this method, Rh forms impurity levels in the band gap of the host material, resulting in the generation of a new narrow energy gap. SrTiO3:Rh,24 SrTiO3:Rh,Sb,25,26 NaNbO3:Rh,Ba,17 TiO2:Rh,Sb,27 K2LaNb3O15:Rh,28 and AgLi1/3Ti2/3O2:Rh,Sb29 (denoted as (host material):(dopant)) are reported as visible-light-driven photocatalysts. SrTiO3:Rh is a representative H2-evolving photocatalyst for Z-schematic water splitting under visible light irradiation.16,17 IrOx-loaded SrTiO3:Rh,Sb can split water under visible light irradiation.26 Nevertheless, WO3 has never been doped with Rh. Therefore, WO3 is expected to be doped with Rh to expand its responsive wavelength. In addition, the codoping method was also investigated because the codopant affects the photocatalytic activity.24–27,30–33 Cs was selected as the codopant because it is effective in improving the photocatalytic activity of WO3.10,18
In the present study, we doped Rh with/without Cs into WO3 so as to expand the responsive wavelength and investigated the photocatalytic properties of the obtained Rh-doped samples. Additionally, it was found that WO3:Cs,Rh can be applied as an O2-evolving photocatalyst to Z-schematic water splitting under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm by the combination with Ru-loaded SrTiO3:Rh as a H2-evolving photocatalyst.
Experimental
Preparation of photocatalysts
Rh(x%)-doped and Cs,Rh(x%)-codoped WO3 (denoted as WO3:Rh(x) and WO3:Cs,Rh(x), respectively) were synthesized by a solid-state reaction using WO3 (Kojundo Chemical; 99.99%), Rh2O3 (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical; 98.0–102.0%), and 1 mol L−1 of an aqueous CsCl solution, as the starting materials. CsCl solution was prepared by dissolving Cs2CO3 (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical; 95.0–102.0%) and chloric acid (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical; 35–37%) in pure water. The starting materials were mixed with ethanol in an alumina mortar at a ratio of Cs:W:Rh = (0.05 or 0):1 − x:x. The mixture was dried at room temperature, after which the dried mixture was calcined in air at 1073–1373 K for 5 h in an alumina crucible. TiO2:Rh(0.5),Sb(1.0), TiO2:Cr(2.3),Sb(3.45), WO3/TiO2:Cr(2.3),Sb(3.45), NaNbO3:Rh(1.0),Ba(2.0), SrTiO3:Rh(1.0),Sb(2.0), and SrTiO3:Ru(0.3),Sb(0.45) were also synthesized by a solid-state reaction so as to compare their photocatalytic activity with that of WO3:Cs,Rh, according to previous reports.17,19,25–27,30,31
Ru(0.7 wt%)-loaded SrTiO3 doped with Rh(1%) (denoted as Ru/SrTiO3:Rh) as a H2-evolving photocatalyst for Z-schematic water splitting was prepared according to a previous report.34 SrTiO3:Rh was synthesized by a solid-state reaction using SrCO3 (Kanto Chemical; 99.9%), TiO2 (Kojundo Chemical; 99.9%), and Rh2O3, as the starting materials. The starting materials were mixed in an alumina mortar with ethanol at a ratio of Sr:Ti:Rh = 1.07:0.99:0.01. The mixture was calcined in air at 1273 K for 10 h after precalcination at 1173 K for 1 h and grinding. The Ru(0.7 wt%) cocatalyst was loaded by a photodeposition method in 10 vol% of an aqueous methanol solution. SrTiO3:Rh powder in the amount of 0.2 g was suspended in 300 mL of the aqueous methanol solution in which RuCl3·nH2O (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical; 99.9%) had been dissolved. The SrTiO3:Rh suspended solution was irradiated for 3 h using a 300 W Xe-arc lamp (PerkinElmer Cermax-PE300BF) with a long-pass filter (HOYA L42).
Characterization
The obtained samples were studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical; EMPYREAN). Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured using UV-Vis-NIR spectrometers (JASCO; V-760 or V570) with integration spheres and were converted from the reflectance to absorbance mode by the Kubelka–Munk method. The surface area was determined by a BET measurement (BEL JAPAN; Belsorp mini II). Dispersion of Rh and Cs in WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI Regulus 8230) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL; JEM-ARM200F) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The elemental composition of the surface of WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ULVAC; XPS-1800).
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a gas-closed circulation system. Side- and top-irradiation reaction cells made of Pyrex were used for O2-evolution and Z-schematic water splitting, respectively. Photocatalyst powder was suspended in an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution in the reaction cells. The pH values of the reactant solutions were adjusted with perchloric acid (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical; 70–72%). A 300 W Xe arc lamp with a long-pass filter (HOYA; L38, L42 Y46, Y48, Y50, O56, O58, or R60 labeled with a cut-off wavelength) was used as the light source. The cut-off wavelengths are determined by the manufacturer (HOYA) as the wavelength showing 50% of the transmittance. For example, the cut-off wavelength of the L42 filter is 420 nm, meaning that the transmittance at 420 nm is 50%. Thus, the incident light was denoted with the cut-off wavelength for convenience (e.g. “L42: λ > 420 nm” or “wavelength longer than 420 nm”). Amounts of evolved H2 and O2 gases were determined with a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU; GC-8A, MS-5A, Ar carrier gas, TCD). The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for photocatalytic O2 evolution from an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution was measured using a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Asahi Spectra; MAX-303) with a band-pass filter (Asahi Spectra; BP520). The photon flux of the monochromatic light was measured with a silicon diode head (HIOKI; 9742) connected to an optical power meter (HIOKI; 3664). The AQY was calculated using the following equation: (1)

Z-schematic water splitting was carried out also under simulated sunlight (SAN-EI ELECTRIC; XES-40S3-TT) irradiation. The solar to hydrogen energy conversion efficiency (STH) was calculated using the following equation: (2)
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of WO3, WO3:Rh(0.5), WO3:Cs, and WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) synthesized at 1273 K. The absorption threshold (470 nm) of WO3:Cs was almost identical to that of WO3. WO3:Rh(0.5) exhibited an absorption plateau in a wavelength region longer than the absorption edge of WO3 (>450 nm). On the other hand, WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) exhibited a new absorption band with an edge in a longer wavelength region (450–600 nm) than the absorption edges of WO3 and WO3:Cs, and the absorption plateau was hardly observed. This result suggests that a new narrow energy gap (EG) was generated in WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5).

Fig. 3 shows the time courses of O2 evolution over WO3, WO3:Rh(0.5), WO3:Cs, and WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) from an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm. WO3 and WO3:Cs did not produce O2 due to their inability to absorb light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm. WO3:Rh(0.5) hardly showed any photocatalytic activity, suggesting that most of Rh in WO3:Rh(0.5) might not work as an effective dopant in WO3. These results indicate that it is difficult to expand the responsive wavelength of WO3 by the simple doping of Rh. In contrast, WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) steadily produced O2, which is the first time that the responsive wavelength of WO3 has been expanded by doping for O2 evolution with a reversible redox mediator.

Photocatalyst: 0.4 g, reactant solution: 4 mmol L−1 Fe(ClO4)3 aq. (pH 2.1 adjusted with HClO4 aq., 300 mL), cell: side-irradiation cell made of Pyrex, light source: 300 W Xe-arc lamp with a long-pass filter (HOYA; Y50). 
The absorption plateau >450 nm in WO3:Rh(0.5) may be due to the reduction of W from hexavalent to pentavalent and/or tetravalent, and/or the aggregated deposition of Rh species on the surface of WO3. The W4f XPS spectra of WO3, WO3:Rh(0.5), WO3:Cs, and WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) were measured so as to clarify the oxidation numbers of W in the samples (Fig. S1†). The binding energies (35.4–35.5 eV) of W4f7/2 peaks for all the samples are similar to those for WO3 (35.8 eV) and CaWO4 (35.0 eV).35 The binding energies for W18O49 and WO2 containing tetravalent and/or pentavalent W were 34.3 and 32.8 eV, respectively.35 Additionally, the absorption plateau was hardly observed in the spectra of WO3 and WO3:Cs. Thus, hexavalent W in all the samples hardly reduced by calcination at a high temperature. An absorption plateau is often observed in photocatalysts loaded with cocatalysts on the surfaces.36–39 The SEM-EDS images of WO3:Rh and WO3:Cs,Rh were measured to clarify the characteristic difference between these two materials with and without Cs. Many aggregates of Rh species existed on the surfaces of the WO3 particles of WO3:Rh (Fig. S2†). Additionally, Rh3d peaks were hardly observed in the XPS measurements because of the local existence of large Rh aggregates. In contrast, Rh3d peaks were detected in the XPS measurements of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) and WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0). Additionally, Rh and Cs existed almost uniformly in many particles of WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0), and Rh aggregations were not observed (Fig. 4). These results suggest that Cs was necessary for Rh doping into the WO3 particles. The particles of WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) were observed in detail with TEM, as shown in Fig. 5. The sample particle was sliced to observe the TEM image clearly. The WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) particle possessed a thin layer (about 2 nm in thickness) on its surface similar to a core–shell structure, as in a previous report.18 The atomic array of crystals in the thin layer was different from that in the core. The lattice distance of the core was 3.77 Å, resulting in agreement with the d-value of the (020) plane of the monoclinic WO3 (ICSD 80056). WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) also showed the diffraction pattern of the monoclinic WO3 as a main phase in XRD (Fig. S3†). By TEM-EDX measurements, Cs was detected not in the core but in the thin layer (Fig. S4†). Rh was not detected anywhere because the amount of Rh doping was too low for EDX. However, the surface presence of Rh could be observed by XPS, and the measured atomic ratio of Rh and Cs to W was Rh:Cs:W = 1:2.5:1.4, suggesting that the presence of Rh and Cs at the surface was much higher than the prepared ratio (Rh:Cs:W = 1:5:99). It is noted again that Rh was not doped into the WO3 particles without Cs. Thus, it is surmised that the surface part of the WO3 particles was rearranged during the calcination process with Cs and Rh, and the thin shell of a mixed oxide such as RhWCsXWYOZ (denoted as RhCs-tungstate) was formed on the core of the monoclinic WO3. During SEM-EDX measurements, a few particles with a high concentration of Cs were occasionally observed (Fig. S5†). The ratio of Cs to W in the particles was about 0.25, resulting in rough agreement with the elemental composition of Cs0.287W0.95O3 (Cs/W = 0.3) as an impurity confirmed in the XRD pattern (Fig. S3†). The ratio of the number of particles with a high Cs concentration to that of the other particles was very low (<0.3%). Therefore, the particles with a high concentration of Cs do not seem to work mainly on the photocatalytic reaction.

The oxidation number (valence) of the dopant in a doping-type photocatalyst has a huge effect on its activity.24–27,30–33 In the case of Rh-doped photocatalysts, trivalent Rh is better than tetravalent Rh for O2 evolution.25–27 Therefore, WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) was measured with XPS so as to clarify the oxidation number of Rh in WO3:Cs,Rh. The binding energy (309.8 eV) of the Rh3d5/2 peak for WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) was similar to that (309.6 eV) reported for Rh2WO6 (Fig. S6†),40 indicating that Rh in WO3:Cs,Rh was trivalent. In addition, the absorption peak because of the d–d transition in the tetravalent Rh around 1000 nm was not observed (Fig. S7†). This result also suggests that trivalent Rh was doped into WO3:Cs,Rh.24
The activity of doping-type photocatalysts depends on the amount of the dopant.24,27,30,41,42 Therefore, we investigated the dependence of the activity for O2 evolution from an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution upon the amount of Rh doping. Both WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) and WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) showed the highest activity under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm (Fig. S8†). However, under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 420 nm, WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) showed a higher activity than WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0). The intensity of the absorption band at 450–600 nm for WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) was higher than that for WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) (Fig. S9†). Therefore, the activity (λ > 500 nm) of WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) was almost the same as that of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) although under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 420 nm, WO3:Cs,Rh(1.0) showed a lower activity than WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5). From these results, the optimum amount of Rh doping was determined as 0.5%.
We also investigated the dependence of the activity for O2 evolution under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm upon the calcination temperature of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) (Fig. S10†). WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) synthesized at 1273 K showed the highest activity for O2 evolution among the samples synthesized at 1073–1373 K. The temperature dependence of the activity was mainly due to the intensity of the absorption band because of the trivalent Rh at 450–600 nm (Fig. S11†). The absorption band at 450–600 nm clearly appeared when synthesized at 1173 and 1273 K. When synthesized at 1073 K, the intensity of the absorption band at 450–600 nm was low compared with that of the samples synthesized at 1173 and 1273 K. In addition, the intensity of the baseline absorption (λ > 600 nm) was higher than that of the others. The calcination temperature of 1073 K appeared to be insufficient for Rh doping into the particle. This result is reasonable because other visible-light-driven photocatalysts developed by doping with metal cations were also synthesized at 1273–1473 K.17,24–27,30–32,39,43 When synthesized at 1373 K, the intensity of the absorption band at 450–600 nm was lowest among all the samples. This is due to the vaporization of Cs, which positively affects both doping and activity. Only the sample synthesized at 1373 K showed much lower activity than the others even under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 420 nm. Therefore, the low activity of the sample synthesized at 1373 K was not only due to the absorption intensity but also the fundamental deterioration. Thus, the activity of the samples synthesized at 1173 and 1273 K was higher than that of the samples synthesized at 1073 and 1373 K. The optimum calcination temperature was determined as 1273 K.
The activity of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) synthesized at 1273 K was compared with that of previously reported doping-type photocatalysts (TiO2:Rh,Sb (EG 2.1 eV), TiO2:Cr,Sb (EG 2.2 eV), WO3/TiO2:Cr,Sb, NaNbO3:Rh,Ba(EG 2.5 eV), SrTiO3:Rh,Sb(EG 2.4 eV), and SrTiO3:Ru,Sb (EG 1.9 eV)), as shown in Fig. 6. WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) showed the highest activity among the non-modified samples under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 420 nm. Non-doped WO3 (BG 2.7 eV) can be photoexcited under visible light irradiation, while non-doped rutile-TiO2 (BG 3.0 eV), non-doped SrTiO3 (BG 3.2 eV), and non-doped NaNbO3 (BG 3.5 eV) cannot be photoexcited. Therefore, the electrons were photoexcited from both the valence band formed by the O2p orbitals and the impurity levels formed by the trivalent Rh in WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 420 nm. In contrast, the other photocatalysts can use only photoexcitation from the impurity levels. This is why the activity of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) was much higher than that of the other non-modified samples. Moreover, WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) completely reduced Fe(III) to Fe(II), suggesting that the oxidation of H2O to O2 was faster than that of Fe(II) to Fe(III) (backward reaction). Even under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm, WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) showed the highest activity among the non-modified samples. The AQY at 520 nm for O2 evolution over WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) was 0.2%. The AQY of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) was higher than the AQY (<0.05% at 520 nm) for O2 evolution over H2-reduced SrTiO3 doped with Ru, which is one of the doping-type metal oxide photocatalysts, from an aqueous AgNO3 solution.31 On the other hand, WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) showed a little lower initial activity than WO3/TiO2:Cr,Sb under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 420 nm. Additionally, WO3/TiO2:Cr,Sb much earlier finished reducing all Fe(III) ions to Fe(II) ions than WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5). This may be because the backward reaction from Fe(II) to Fe(III) faster proceeded on WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) than WO3/TiO2:Cr,Sb. Even under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm, the activity of WO3/TiO2:Cr,Sb was much higher than that of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5). WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) should possess the highest latent capacity for O2 evolution among all the non-modified samples because WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) showed the highest activity for O2 evolution among them. The activity of TiO2:Cr,Sb was especially low compared with that of WO3:Cs,Rh. Thus, the authors believe that the activity of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) will exceed that of WO3/TiO2:Cr,Sb by some surface modification or suitable treatment in the future.

Photocatalyst: 0.1–0.4 g, reactant solution: 4 mmol L−1 Fe(ClO4)3 aq. (pH2.1 adjusted with HClO4 aq., 300 mL), cell: side-irradiation cell made of Pyrex, light source: 300 W Xe-arc lamp with a long-pass filter (HOYA; L42 or Y50). The dashed line in (A) indicates the upper limitation amount of evolved O2 when Fe(III) was completely reduced to Fe(II). 
The wavelength dependence of O2 evolution over WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) synthesized at 1273 K from an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution was investigated, as shown in Fig. 7(A). WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) synthesized at 1273 K responded to visible light up to 600 nm, which WO3:Cs cannot absorb. Moreover, the onset wavelength of the activity agreed with that of the absorption spectrum of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5). This agreement indicates that the O2 evolution proceeds via photoexcitation from the impurity levels formed by the trivalent Rh in the thin shell of RhCs-tungstate, as shown in Fig. 7(B). SrTiO3:Rh,La for H2 evolution with a core–shell structure also shows photocatalytic activity using the absorption because of the impurity levels formed by Rh, although Rh was doped only into the surface of SrTiO3.44,45 Therefore, the thin shell of the RhCs-tungstate must work under the irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm. The potentials of the impurity levels formed by the trivalent Rh in TiO2:Rh,Sb,27 SrTiO3:Rh,Sb,25 and NaNbO3:Rh,Ba17 are +2.1, +2.1, and +2.0 V vs. RHE, respectively. In addition, the trivalent Rh in K2LaNb5O15:Rh is expected to form impurity levels at +2.2 V vs. RHE.28 Moreover, the band structure of SrTiO3:Rh,La44 with a core–shell structure was almost the same as that of SrTiO3:Rh,Sb25,26 without a core–shell structure. Thus, the trivalent Rh in WO3:Cs,Rh also seems to form impurity levels at +2.0 to +2.2 V vs. RHE. The EG of WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) was estimated to be 2.1 eV from its absorption edge (Fig. 2). Thus, the level of the conduction band minimum of the RhCs-tungstate shell was estimated to be around 0 V vs. RHE from the energy gap (2.1 eV). The level of the conduction band minimum of WO3 is reported to be at +0.3 V vs. RHE,46 which means that the photoexcited electrons in the WO3 core hardly migrated to the RhCs-tungstate shell. It is surmised that the photoexcited electrons in the WO3 core might have reacted at the sites where the layer of RhCs-tungstate shell was very thin or did not exist. Actually, the surface of the monoclinic WO3 was exposed at the corner of the particle, as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 5. Therefore, the sites where electrons photogenerated in the monoclinic WO3 can react definitely exist.

Fig. 8 shows the Z-schematic water splitting system using Ru/SrTiO3:Rh as a H2-evolving photocatalyst, WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) synthesized at 1273 K as an O2-evolving photocatalyst, and an Fe3+/2+ redox as the electron mediator under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm. An induction period to reach equilibrium between Fe(III) and Fe(II) was observed for the initial 5 h, because all the Fe ions in the reactant solution were Fe(III) at the beginning of the reaction, and then the O2 evolution rate was much higher than that of H2. Actually, an induction period was not observed without the Fe3+/2+ redox (interparticle electron transfer, Fig. S12†). After the induction period, H2 and O2 were steadily produced at a stoichiometric ratio (H2/O2 = 2) even after the evacuation of the gas phase for the second run. The water splitting activity with the Fe3+/2+ redox was much higher than that without the Fe3+/2+ redox, indicating that the Fe3+/2+ redox mediated the electron transfer from WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5) to Ru/SrTiO3:Rh. The water splitting proceeded even under simulated sunlight irradiation with 0.03% of the STH (Fig. S13†). Thus, we successfully established a new Z-schematic solar water splitting system responsive to visible light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm.

Photocatalyst: 50 mg each, reactant solution: 1 mmol L−1 Fe(ClO4)3 aq. (pH 2.3 adjusted with HClO4 aq., 200 mL), cell: top-irradiation cell made of Pyrex, light source: 300 W Xe-arc lamp with a long-pass filter (HOYA; Y50). 
Conclusions
We successfully expanded the responsive wavelength of the WO3 photocatalyst up to 600 nm by Rh doping. Trivalent Rh was successfully doped only when codoped with Cs. WO3:Cs,Rh had a core–shell structure: the core of monoclinic WO3 and the thin shell of RhCs-tungstate. WO3:Cs,Rh showed photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution from an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution under irradiation of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm although WO3, WO3:Rh, and WO3:Cs hardly showed any activity. The optimum amount of Rh and the calcination temperature were 0.5% and 1273 K, respectively. The optimized WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5%) synthesized at 1273 K gave 0.2% of the AQY at 520 nm for O2 evolution from an aqueous Fe(ClO4)3 solution and showed a higher activity under visible light irradiation than previously reported doping-type photocatalysts without modification. This might be due to the band structure of the optimized WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5%). The optimized WO3:Cs,Rh(0.5%) was successfully applied as an O2-evolving photocatalyst to Z-schematic water splitting by the combination with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh as a H2-evolving photocatalyst and an Fe3+/2+ redox as an electron mediator. Z-schematic water splitting proceeded even under simulated sunlight irradiation with 0.03% of the STH. Thus, we successfully constructed a novel Z-schematic solar water splitting system driven under irradiation of visible light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm.
