    , Accepted 14th June 2021First published on 14th June 2021AbstractWater pollution caused by oil has placed a significant burden on the ecosystem and human health. However, the present membranes suffer from a serious oil fouling issue during long-term oily wastewater remediation, which has limited their practical applications. Herein, inspired by the taro leaf, we develop a biomimetic nanofibrous membrane composed of BiOBr microspheres anchored on electroconductive SiO2/polyaniline (PANI) core–shell nanofibers. Due to the surface multiscale structures and hydrophilic matrix, the biomimetic membrane shows intriguing superhydrophilicity, underwater superoleophobicity, and low-oil-adhesion. Benefitting from the high porosity and sub-micrometer pores, the membrane exhibited superior capability for separating highly emulsified oil-in-water emulsions with a promising permeation flux of 6140 L m−2 h−1 and a high separation efficiency (total organic carbon content <5 mg L−1). Importantly, the presence of BiOBr/PANI heterojunction arrays with visible light catalytic activity and 3D PANI electroconductive networks effectively imparts desirable self-cleaning properties, maintaining a high flux recovery ratio >98%. The synthesis of such biomimetic nanomaterials may open up new avenues for developing high-performance separation materials for the purification of large volumes of wastewater.
Introduction
Emulsified oil in wastewater with a wide droplet size distribution ranging from several ten nanometers to a few microns is largely generated from industrial processes and our daily life, which may not only pose a huge threat to ecosystems but also become a kind of principal contaminant exacerbating the water scarcity.1–4 Various approaches, such as skimming, gas flotation, sedimentation, centrifugation, and membrane filtration, have been utilized to purify oily sewage.5,6 Among them, membrane-based filtration technology, functioning based on selective wettability and the size-sieving effect, has attracted a lot of attention due to its high efficiency, cost effectiveness, easy operation process, and low energy consumption. Despite the outstanding potential, the major problem associated with the traditional separation membranes is their ease of fouling because of oil adsorption and pore blockage, which leads to serious deterioration of permeation flux and loss of separation efficiency.7,8 Currently, considerable efforts have been dedicated to developing hydrophilic membranes with high hydration ability, such as hydrogel-based membranes and polyelectrolyte-based membranes,9–11 which realized promising oil-repellence, even for viscous oil. Unfortunately, these polymeric membranes easily swell in water, causing pore plugging and flux decline. Therefore, creating membranes that simultaneously possess a high yet stable permeation flux and good anti-fouling properties is highly needed.
For the development of desirable separation membranes, most studies have focused on integrating nanoscale semiconductors (e.g., TiO2,12–17 g-C3N4,18,19 β-FeOOH,20 and Bi2O2CO3 (ref. 21)) and their compounds with hydrophilic membranes to impart the self-cleaning ability. Despite the obtained performance improvement, without a favorable structure, the nano-sized photocatalysts tend to suffer from ease of dense aggregation and rapid photoelectron–hole recombination, thus greatly disfavoring the photocatalytic reaction. In nature, the taro leaf possesses robust superwettability and high-efficiency photosynthesis ability through the multiscale surface and chloroplast system, which is an optimized entity developed through the natural evolution over millions of years. Typically, the nanosheet-constructed microspheres of the leaf surface were responsible for the leaf's superwettability.22,23 And the chloroplast in the taro leaf as a photochemical convertor, in which the light-dependent thylakoids connected by electroconductive stroma lamellae, allows plants to effectively capture and convert solar energy into carbohydrates to power the biological life activity.24,25 Besides, researchers have revealed that the interconnected electroconductive networks provided by stroma lamellae could efficiently transport and separate photo-excited charges, which greatly accelerates the photochemical reactions in photosynthesis.26,27 Therefore, inspired by the taro leaf, assembling a membrane with a hierarchically structured surface and chloroplast-structured photocatalyst could endow it with a revivable feature for retaining high-flux emulsion separation; however, design of such membrane is extremely challenging.
Herein, we present a facile assembly strategy for creating highly water-permeable and self-cleaning nanofibrous membranes. The advantage of the design is that BiOBr nanosheet-constructed microspheres are threaded by 3D SiO2/PANI electroconductive nanofibers, thus endowing the membrane with a biomimetic multiscale surface and chloroplast-structured photochemical conversion system. The as-prepared membranes exhibit the integrated properties of a hierarchical structured surface, sub-micrometer pores, high porosity, superwettability, and low-oil-adhesion. More importantly, these biomimetic membranes can separate oil-in-water emulsions while maintaining high water flux, and show excellent visible light-induced self-cleaning ability. Consequently, our work on designing porous nanofibrous membranes offers ample opportunities to pursue the balance of antifouling properties and permeation flux for emulsion separation membranes, thus extending the lifespan of membranes during the long-term oily wastewater treatment.
Experimental methods
Materials
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98 wt%), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), aniline (ANI), ammonium persulfate (APS), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), potassium bromide (KBr), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), n-hexane, petroleum ether, and hexadecane were all ordered from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Soybean oil was obtained from the market. All reagents were used as received without further refinement.
Fabrication of a SiO2 nanofibrous membrane
The SiO2 nanofibrous membrane was prepared by a combination of electrospinning and high-temperature calcination. First, the silica sol was generated via hydrolysis and polycondensation by mixing TEOS, H2O, and H3PO4 at a molar ratio of 1:10:0.01, and stirring for 6 h. Then, 10 wt% PVA was dissolved in deionized water with constant stirring for 8 h. Afterwards, silica sol (10 g) was added into PVA solution (20 g) with stirring for 6 h. The electrospinning process was carried out with a high voltage of 17 kV, a feed rate of 1 mL h−1, and a tip-to-collector distance of 21 cm. The ambient temperature and relative humidity were controlled at 23 ± 2 °C and 43 ± 2%, respectively. After electrospinning, the SiO2 nanofibrous membrane was calcined at 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
Encapsulation of a PANI nanoshell on the SiO2 nanofibrous membrane
A PANI nanoshell was grown on the surface of individual SiO2 nanofibers through a chemical oxidation method. Briefly, the SiO2 nanofibrous membrane was immersed into a beaker with 1 g purified aniline and 33 mL 1 M HCl for 30 min so that the aniline monomers could adsorb onto the nanofiber surfaces. Then to the solution was added another solution containing oxidant APS (1 g) and HCl (8 mL, 1 M) with further stirring for 1 min. After that, the combined mixture was shaken for an additional 1 h at 35 °C. After the polymerization reaction, the as-prepared dark-green membrane was washed with deionized water to remove excess reagents and byproducts.
Synthesis of the heterostructured nanofibrous membrane
The SiO2/PANI/BiOBr heterostructured membrane was synthesized by a facile successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Briefly, the SiO2/PANI membrane was first immersed in 5 mM Bi(NO3)3·5H2O aqueous solution for 2 min to adsorb the Bi3+, and then rinsed with water for 30 s to remove excess Bi3+. Next, the membrane was immersed in 5 mM KBr aqueous solution for 2 min to react with Br-ions to generate BiOBr on the surface of SiO2/PANI nanofibers, followed by rinsing with water. After 1, 3, 6, and 9 SILAR cycles, the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membranes were obtained. For a comparative study, pure BiOBr powder was prepared through directly mixing Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and KBr solution, then rinsed and dried.
Preparation of oil-in-water emulsions
For oil-in-water surfactant-free emulsions (SFEs), oil (i.e., n-hexane, petroleum ether, hexadecane, and soybean oil) was mixed with water at a certain volume ratio (oil/water (v/v) = 1/9), and then the mixtures were sonicated for 30 min at a power of 560 W to produce milky emulsions. To prepare oil-in-water surfactant-stabilized emulsions (SSEs), SDS (0.2 mg mL−1) was first dissolved in water, then a certain amount of oil (oil/water (v/v) = 1/99) (i.e., n-hexane, petroleum ether, hexadecane, and soybean oil) was added. The mixture was sonicated under the same power for 30 min. All the surfactant-stabilized emulsions can stabilize for more than 10 days without obvious precipitation.
Emulsion separation experiments
The separation process of the emulsion through the membranes was carried out on dead-end filtration equipment. The as-prepared membranes were sandwiched between a glass reservoir and funnel base with a diameter of 20 mm. The freshly prepared emulsion was poured into a separation cell and separated under gravity. The flux of the membrane was determined by calculating the filtrate volume within 1 min. The heights of the emulsion column were adjusted to afford a constant gravitational pressure of 1 kPa during the separation process. The TOC contents in the collected filtrates were analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer. For every emulsion, at least three repetitions of the test were performed to acquire an average value.
The self-cleaning properties of the membrane were assessed via a four-stage filtration process. Pure water was first passed through the membrane under 1 kPa and the water flux was named as Jwater. Then 100 mL of oil-in-water SSE was separated by the membrane under 1 kPa and the relevant water flux was named as Joil. Next, the membrane was rinsed with water for 30 min, and the recovered pure water flux was named as Jrecovery-rinsing. Finally, the membrane was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp (Perfect-Light, PLS-SXE300/300UV, China) for 1 h, and the recovered purified water flux was named as Jrecovery-light irradiation. The flux recovery ratio (FRR) was calculated according to eqn (1). FRR = Jrecovery/Jwater(1)
Characterization
The morphology and EDS elemental mapping of the membranes were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SU-8010, Hitachi, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2010F, JEOL, Japan). The Sa of the membranes was determined on a laser confocal scanning microscope (LCSM) (OLS4100, Olympus, Japan). The porous structure of the membranes was examined using a capillary flow porometer (CFP-1100AI, PMI, America). The crystal phase structures were measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu radiation. The materials' surface electronic states were recorded on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Escalab 250Xi, Thermo Fisher, America). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the membranes were collected with an FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Fisher, America). The Raman spectra were collected using a Raman microscope system (LabRAM HR Evolution, Horiba, France) under a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained using a spectrophotometer (U-3900, Hitachi, Japan). The transient photocurrent response was evaluated using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI-660E, Chenhua, China). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (F-4600, Hitachi, Japan) using an excitation wavelength of 300 nm. The electroconductivity of the membranes was characterized using a four-point probe equipment (ST-2258, JG, China). The water contact angle (WCA) (3 μL), oil contact angle (3 μL), and underwater oil contact angle (UWOCA) (3 μL) were measured on a contact angle goniometer (SL 200B, Kino, America). The total organic carbon content in water was detected using a total organic carbon analyzer (Shimadzu, TOC-L, Japan).
Results and discussion
Design and fabrication of the separation membranes
We developed the separation membranes based on three principles: (i) the membranes should attain superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity as well as low-oil-adhesion properties, (ii) the membranes must possess submicron pores with high porosity to efficiently intercept the small oil droplets and guarantee rapid water permeation, and (iii) the membranes should photo-induce self-cleaning to degrade the oily contaminant for regeneration. Natural taro leaves display a hierarchical structure for superwettability and electroconductive networks for high-efficiency photosynthesis (Fig. 1a). Inspired by this, the first criterion was met by utilizing a taro leaf-like hierarchical surface structure, on which the high nitrogen- and oxygen-content materials were chosen to confer high surface energy. For the other two demands, we finely threaded nanosheet-constructed spherical semiconductors onto the electroconductive nanofibers, resulting in an interconnective network with a chloroplast-structured photochemical energy conversion system.

Fig. 1b displays the synthesis pathway. The fabrication began with the SiO2 nanofibrous membrane with flexibility obtained by sol–gel electrospinning (Fig. S1†). The representative SEM image of the SiO2 nanofibrous membrane showed a randomly aligned 3D nonwoven architecture with an average fiber diameter of 391 nm (Fig. 1c). During the in situ chemical oxidation of aniline, aniline monomers formed the cationic form in the acid solution and adsorbed on the SiO2 nanofiber surface by electrostatic attraction. After the oxidant ammonium persulfate was added to the system, a layer of PANI with a rough surface as a nanoshell was uniformly and densely coupled to individual SiO2 nanofibers (Fig. 1d). The diameter of the resulting SiO2/PANI core–shell nanofibers increased to 566 nm, illustrating the PANI coating layer with a thickness of ∼87 nm. Meanwhile, the obvious bonding structures formed among the adjacent fibers of the SiO2/PANI nanofibrous membrane (Fig. 1d, inset), owing to the in situ generation of the PANI nanoshell on the fiber surface. It should be noted that the bonding structures only appeared in the junctions of nanofibers without the formation of the dense polymeric film in the pores, thus maintaining the high porosity and good pore interconnectivity, which facilitated the mass transfer.28–30 Next, nanosheet-constructed BiOBr spheres were uniformly threaded by SiO2/PANI nanofibers through subsequent SILAR growth (Fig. 1e), exhibiting a remarkable hierarchical surface architecture and chloroplast series-wound structure of the taro leaf on the resulting SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane. And the diameter of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr nanofibers increased to ∼1.3 μm. Under high-magnification SEM observation, these BiOBr nanosheets with thicknesses of ∼16 nm avoided dense accumulation and formed numerous enclosed cells on the surface of SiO2/PANI/BiOBr nanofibers (Fig. 1f). Benefiting from the cavity in the BiOBr microsphere, the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane still showed a high porosity of ∼85%. In contrast, with a small number of SILAR cycles (e.g., 1 and 3 cycles), the nanosheets were sparsely distributed on the SiO2/PANI nanofibers without full coverage (Fig. S2a and b†). If BiOBr was in excess, the role of SiO2/PANI nanofibers as a template was weakened, which could be because excess Bi3+ and Br− ions may promote the nucleation and growth of additional spherical aggregations (Fig. S2c†). It was noted that without a PANI layer, few BiOBr nanoparticles were randomly distributed on the SiO2 nanofiber surfaces (Fig. S3†), which could be due to the poor coordination ability of the metal ions with the smooth SiO2 surface. Therefore, the PANI layer is critical to the formation of the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr nanofibrous membrane.
The 3D surface profile by LCSM revealed that the surface arithmetic average height (Sa) value of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane significantly increased with increasing number of SILAR cycles. And the maximum Sa value of 1.30 μm was achieved by the membrane with series-wound BiOBr spheres (membrane with 6 SILAR cycles), which could endow the membrane with robust superwettability according to Cassie's law (Fig. 1g). However, a reverse trend in Sa occurred as the number of SILAR cycles further increased to 9 because of the highly aggregated BiOBr spheres. Besides, the synergistic effect of PANI nanoshell and BiOBr nanosheet sharply decreased the pore size from 1.42 to 0.62 μm, indicating a great improvement of the pore structure (Fig. 1h), which could enhance the size-sieving effect of the resultant membrane. Moreover, the pristine SiO2 nanofibrous membrane suffered from extremely low conductivity, which sharply increased to greater than 10 mS cm−1 after being wrapped by the PANI nanoshell, indicating that the combination of intrinsic conductivity of PANI and the bonded PANI nanoshell is sufficient to create a 3D direct-charge transport highway. Upon being further assembled with a BiOBr nanosheet, the conductivity slightly decreased to 7 mS cm−1, which may be due to the low conductivity of semiconductor BiOBr. Photographs of bending the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr nanofibrous membrane demonstrated its excellent flexibility and bending recovery (Fig. 1i, inset), and it can withstand 200 bending cycles without losing much in electroconductivity (Fig. 1i). With the integrated properties of the hierarchical surface structure, small pore size, and conductive networks, the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane showed promising self-cleaning capability and demonstrated great potential in the filtration industry (Fig. 1j).
The TEM images revealed close adhesion between the fibrous SiO2 core and the PANI shell (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, it also confirmed an intimate connection between the BiOBr nanosheet and PANI, verifying that heterojunction arrays were successfully generated. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image focusing on the nanosheet exhibited lattice fringe spacings of 0.282, 0.354, and 0.229 nm corresponding to the (102), (101), and (112) planes of tetragonal BiOBr, which agreed with the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2b).31 The crystalline information of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane was further obtained by XRD (Fig. 2d). The peaks of the (101), (110), and (200) planes of tetragonal BiOBr (JCPDS No. 09-0393) were observed in the XRD spectra of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane, indicating that the phase and crystallinity of BiOBr were not changed after the SILAR growth.32 Besides, because both the SiO2 nanofiber and PANI powder may be amorphous, no other peaks appeared in the XRD spectra of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane. The corresponding X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental maps further revealed that the prepared SiO2/PANI/BiOBr nanofiber was composed of a SiO2 nanofibrous skeleton and PANI nanoshell, and the SiO2/PANI nanofiber connected BiOBr microspheres in series in an orderly manner (Fig. 2c).

The chemical states of pure BiOBr and the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane were compared by high-resolution XPS. Fig. 2e shows the Bi 4f spectrum of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane, in which the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 orbitals were situated at 159.6 and 164.9 eV, respectively. The Bi 4f spectrum of BiOBr presented two characteristic peaks at 159.3 and 164.6 eV, which belonged to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 orbitals, respectively.33 Compared with BiOBr, the Bi 4f peaks of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane exhibited an obvious shift, indicating strong interaction at the interface between PANI and BiOBr. As for the Br 3d spectrum (Fig. S4a†), the two peaks at 68.4 and 69.4 eV were attributed to the Br 3d5/2 and Br 3d3/2 orbitals of BiOBr powder, respectively.34 The Br 3d peaks also shift slightly toward higher binding energy after combination with PANI. Similarly, the O 1s spectrum of the pure BiOBr powder was deconvoluted into two peaks, that is, the first one at 530.0 eV was ascribed to the lattice oxygen (Bi–O), and the second one at 530.7 eV belonged to the surface hydroxyl group (–OH).35 It was evident that the peaks shifted to higher binding energy in the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane (Fig. S4b†). Moreover, compared with the Raman spectra of the SiO2/PANI membrane, the bands at about 1590 cm−1 (CC stretching vibration in quinonoid units), 1475 cm−1 (CN stretching vibration), 1218 cm−1 (C–N stretching vibration), and 1165 cm−1 (C–H bending vibration) all shifted to lower wavenumbers for the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane,36 reaffirming an interface interaction between PANI and BiOBr (Fig. 2f). Obviously, the heterojunction arrays were successfully formed between the thin PANI shell and BiOBr nanosheet, which could effectively facilitate the separation of photo-induced charges, thus enhancing photocatalytic performance. Besides, such strong interaction also ensured the stability of BiOBr on the PANI nanoshell during practical applications, thus protecting the active sites.
Surface wettability control
A highly selective wetting behavior for water and oil is considered as an important factor that influences the oil/water separation performance. Thus, the wettability of water and oil on the membranes was characterized comprehensively. The pristine SiO2 membrane displayed hydrophilic properties with a WCA of 0° and a spreading time of 5.418 s (Fig. 3a). After in situ polymerization of PANI, the hydrophilic properties of the membrane were improved, and the water droplet could spread on the SiO2/PANI membrane within 1 s, which was due to the roughening effect and abundant nitrogen functional groups of the PANI nanoshell. After threading BiOBr microspheres, the WCA further decreased to 12.8° and rapidly became 0° within only 0.258 s, suggesting an enhanced superhydrophilicity of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr nanofibrous membrane. Meanwhile, when an oil droplet came into contact with the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane, it immediately spread out achieving a contact angle of 0° within 0.394 s, indicating the prominent properties of the membrane for oil wetting (Fig. S5†). Interestingly, after the membranes were immersed in water, the oleophobicity was observed immediately (Fig. 3b). The particular wettability is mainly ascribed to the fact that the adhesion work of water for membranes (∼145.6 mN m−1) was much higher than that of oil (∼46.4 mN m−1) according to Young–Dupré's equation, and the infiltrated water in the membrane pores was hard to replace with oil (see details in the ESI†).37 The Cassie mode demonstrates that a hydrophobic solid surface can be improved to be superhydrophobic by being textured with multiscale roughness. For example, the polylactide (PLA)/glycerol (Gly) nanofibrous membrane with only one scale of texture possessed hydrophobicity with a WCA of 110°. After being roughened with alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) nanosheets by an immersion process, the resultant AKD-dipped PLA/Gly membrane with multiscale roughness showed superhydrophobic properties with WCA above 160°.38 Besides, the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film obtained an increased multiscale roughness by adjusting the size of micro-wrinkles. As a result, the rGO films showed an increased hydrophobicity, achieving a maximum WCA of 160°.39 This theory can also be applied to the underwater oil-repellent surface.40,41 As the number of SILAR cycles increased from 0 to 6, the UWOCAs of the membranes increased from 148° to 161°, which was attributed to the fact that the rough membrane surface could greatly reduce the contact area fraction of the oil droplet (Fig. 3b). However, upon further increasing the number of SILAR cycles to 9, the UWOCA decreased to 153°, which can be attributed to the decreased membrane roughness by highly aggregated BiOBr microspheres.

The ace stability of selective wettability is critical for membrane storage, regeneration, and its application under diverse conditions.42 As shown in Fig. 3c, the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane maintained outstanding superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity after 200 cycles of bending in air, water, ethanol, and liquid nitrogen (−196 °C). Meanwhile, 2 h of continuous stirring treatment demonstrated that the biomimetic membrane effectively withstood water shearing force. Besides, the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane also exhibited underwater superoleophobicity with all UWOCAs above 160° for various oils with different surface tensions and viscosities (e.g., petroleum ether, n-hexane, hexadecane, and soybean oil), confirming its universal underwater superoleophobic properties irrespective of the oil kinds (Fig. 3e).
In practical separation environments, membrane surfaces generally interact with oil under the promotion of water pressure, so the underwater dynamic oil wetting behavior of the membrane was examined to assess the underwater oil-repelling capability.43Fig. 3d (top) shows that an oil droplet was preloaded to approach and squeeze the SiO2/PANI membrane surface, and then it was lifted from the membrane. An obvious stretch can be observed in the receding process, indicating high oil adhesion properties of the SiO2/PANI membrane underwater. In comparison, when the deformed oil droplet detached from the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane, it retained the spherical shape underwater (Fig. 3d, bottom), suggesting low stickiness properties. This result demonstrated that the as-prepared biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane possessed better anti-adhesion properties to oil, which was conducive to its antifouling properties. In principle, the solid–liquid adhesive properties of the membrane surface were determined by the morphological structure and chemical components.23 In this experiment, the underwater oil adhesion properties are highly dependent on the surface micro/nanostructures due to the similar high-surface-energy chemical constituents of the membranes. The surface of the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane consisted of numerous nanoscale enclosed cells in the intersected BiOBr nanosheets, and water could be locked in the cells, forming a stable water layer on the membrane surface. When the biomimetic membrane bore the oil pressure, water in the enclosed cells could act as a soft and stretchy cushion to strongly reject the oil because the sealed water was difficult to compress (Fig. 3f, left).44 In contrast, oil could easily break through water among the PANI nanoparticles of the SiO2/PANI membrane without strong resistance, because the nanoparticles on fibers were an open structure in which water could not be held to offer a high oil-repellent force (Fig. 3f, right).45
Self-cleaning properties
As for oil/water separation, an ideal membrane should possess not only low-oil-adhesion properties but self-cleaning ability to maintain high separation performance during repeated and long-term usage. Fig. 4a shows that the UWOCA of the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr heterostructured membrane decreased from 160.6° to 138.6° after being fouled by oil, indicating the losing of underwater superoleophobic properties. And the contact angle hysteresis exhibited a high value of 15.2° (Fig. S6†). Interestingly, when the polluted biomimetic membrane underwent 1 h of visible light irradiation, it could achieve underwater superoleophobicity again. The contact angle hysteresis decreased to 2.8°. Notably, this process could be repeated 5 times without any change of superwettability (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the contaminated SiO2/PANI membrane could not exhibit underwater superoleophobicity after visible light irradiation (Fig. 4a). These results were well in line with the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 4c). The original SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane possessed no peaks in the range of 2800–3000 and at 1749 cm−1. After being polluted by soybean oil, some strong peaks arose at 2925, 2852, and 1749 cm−1 belonging to the –CH2– stretching vibration and –CO stretching vibration, respectively. Also, these characteristic peaks were completely removed after visible light irradiation for 1 h, indicating photo-induced decomposition of soybean oil by the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr heterostructured membrane.

(f) Proposed photocatalytic mechanism of the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr nanofibrous membrane. 
To gain insight into the mechanism of photo-induced oily contamination degradation, the light absorption ability of the as-prepared samples was investigated by UV-vis DRS (Fig. 4d). The optical absorption edge of BiOBr was at about 450 nm. Notably, the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane exhibited enhanced light absorption in the whole visible light spectrum, owing to the strong visible light absorption ability of the coupled PANI nanoshell.46 To further explain the photocatalytic performance of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr heterostructured membrane, the transient photocurrent spectra and PL spectra were recorded to explore the photoexcited charge transfer process. The photocurrent spectra revealed the synergetic performance of the light harvesting and photoexcited carrier separation. As shown in Fig. 4e, the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane exhibited the highest and most stable current response under visible light irradiation. This was attributed to the 3D PANI networks, which worked as a conductor in the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane to strongly shuttle the photo-induced charges, thus efficiently separating photo-generated electron and hole pairs. Notably, in dramatic contrast to the BiOBr powder, the photocurrent of the SiO2/PANI membrane showed a much higher value, which could also be ascribed to the fact that the 3D conductive framework of PANI could realize the rapid separation of photogenerated charges.47,48 From PL spectra, the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane presented the lowest PL intensity compared to that of the pure BiOBr powder and SiO2/PANI membrane (Fig. S7†), showing a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes because of the well-designed heterojunction arrays and PANI conducting networks, which was consistent with the photocurrent spectra.
We proposed a plausible mechanism for the organic contamination degradation by the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr heterostructured membrane (Fig. 4f and S8†). The SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane exhibited stable photocatalytic oil degradation performance, and its photocatalysis mechanism was analogous to the photosynthesis in taro leaves. The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place in the disk-like grana-stacked thylakoids, where photo-induced holes reacted with H2O to generate O2 in the photosystem with the generation of protons (H+). Meanwhile, the layer-like stroma lamellae linking the thylakoids act as H+/electron transport channels to capture CO2 for producing carbohydrates through the Calvin cycle (Fig. S9†). In the photocatalytic removal of organic matter, as the light-dependent reaction, the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr heterostructured membrane, in which spherical semiconductor BiOBr is threaded by SiO2/PANI electroconductive nanofibers, can be excited by visible light to generate electron–hole pairs in PANI and BiOBr. Then the interface between the PANI and BiOBr resulted in an oriented electron flow from the π*-orbital of PANI to the CB of BiOBr and a hole flow from the VB of BiOBr to the π-orbital of PANI. Meanwhile, the strong BiOBr/PANI interaction and 3D interconnected PANI electroconductive networks further facilitated the photo-induced hole transfer, which can greatly improve the separation of photo-carriers. As a result, the BiOBr microspheres, simulating thylakoids, utilized the remaining holes to react with H2O to produce ˙OH for oxidation of oily matter. And the PANI networks, emulating the stroma lamellae, utilized the transported holes to directly oxidize the organic contamination and also utilized the remaining electrons to trap O2 to form ˙O2− for the degradation of oily contamination.49,50
Emulsion separation performance
Through the combination of excellent selective wettability, low-oil-adhesion, and submicron pores, the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr nanofibrous membrane was able to achieve controllable treatment of oily wastewater. A range of oil-in-water emulsions in different types, including SFEs and SSEs, were purified under the gravity of ∼1 kPa. As for the separation of SFEs (Fig. 5a), the total organic carbon (TOC) contents in water were all below 20 mg L−1, and particularly with regard to n-hexane- and petroleum ether-in-water emulsions, the TOC contents were less than 5 mg L−1. Notably, the membrane exhibited surprisingly high water fluxes during the emulsion separation processes: 5156 L m−2 h−1 for n-hexane-in-water SFE, 6140 L m−2 h−1 for petroleum ether-in-water SFE, 3562 L m−2 h−1 for hexadecane-in-water SFE, and 1967 L m−2 h−1 for soybean oil-in-water SFE. The water fluxes for different emulsions differ sharply, which was caused by the difference in viscosities and oil droplet concentrations of the emulsions.51 Besides, although the separation processes were achieved at low driving pressure, the obtained water fluxes were higher than other reported membranes with similar rejection properties under external pressure.52–54

(c) Permeation fluxes of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane in water–emulsion–water–water four-stage filtration experiments. (d) The permeation fluxes and FRRs of representative membranes. 
As for the emulsion containing surfactant, it was more difficult to be separated compared with SFE because of its small droplet size and excellent stability. Here, four types of SSE consisting of n-hexane, petroleum ether, hexadecane, and soybean oil were taken as examples to evaluate the separation performance of the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane. The biomimetic membrane could achieve promising permeation fluxes of 1004, 824, 669, and 455 L m−2 h−1 for n-hexane-, petroleum ether-, hexadecane-, and soybean oil-in-water SSEs, respectively (Fig. 5b). The water fluxes for SSEs were in the range of 450–1100 L m−2 h−1, which were much smaller than those of SFEs. The reason was that the polar and aliphatic parts of the surfactants at the oil–water interface significantly increased the difficulty of oil demulsification by superwettable membranes. Notably, the water flux for the soybean oil-in-water SSE was the worst. Given that the separation was conducted under 1 kPa driving pressure, the transformed flux can be equivalent to 45500 L m−2 h−1 bar−1, which matched the previous studies with similar separation conditions (Table S1†).13,55–58 Such promising flux could be due to the high porosity and good pore connectivity of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane.59 And the TOC contents in water for all the SSEs were around 30 mg L−1. In comparison with the TOC contents in the filtrates of SFEs, the higher TOC contents obtained for SSEs may arise from the interference of dissolved surfactant molecules in the filtrates.52,60 The TOC contents were the sum of both oil and residual surfactant in the filtrates. The photos of the n-hexane based SFE and SSE and the filtrates are shown in Fig. S10.† After separation by the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane, the filtrates became totally transparent and clear, further confirming the high separation efficiency of the membrane. The results of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane for separating NaCl- and Sudan III-containing n-hexane-in-water emulsions are shown in Fig. S11.† Both the two feed solutions were non-transparent and became transparent after permeating through the membrane. The fluxes of the n-hexane-in-water emulsions with NaCl and Sudan III were 4912 and 4371 L m−2 h−1, respectively. The corresponding TOC contents in the collected filtrates were 2 and 12 mg L−1, respectively, indicating a high separation performance of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane for oil-in-water emulsions no matter what pollutants were present in the feed solution.
To evaluate the self-cleaning ability of the synthesized membranes, water fluxes during the four-stage filtration process were monitored, and the FRR was calculated (Fig. 5c). After the separation of 100 mL of soybean oil-in-water emulsion by the membranes, the water fluxes all declined because of the adhesion of oil droplets on the membrane surfaces. Then, hydraulic washing and light irradiation were performed to restore the fluxes of the polluted membranes. After washing, the corresponding FRRs of SiO2, SiO2/PANI, and SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membranes were 68.4%, 70.1%, and 76.9%, respectively. The FRR of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane is much higher than the corresponding FRRs of the other two membranes, indicating that the BiOBr sphere with enclosed cells can greatly improve the anti-oil-adhesion properties of the membrane, which was consistent with the previous experimental result. In contrast, after the oil-polluted membranes were irradiated under visible light for 1 h, the SiO2 and SiO2/PANI membranes gave nearly unchanged FRRs, while the FRR of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane significantly increased to 99.8%. Notably, in comparison with the clear filtrate of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane, the filtrates for SiO2 and SiO2/PANI membranes were cloudy (Fig. S12†). And TOC contents of the filtrates of SiO2 and SiO2/PANI membranes were 566.5 and 323.7 mg L−1, which were much higher than those of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane. These results further demonstrated the high separation performance of our biomimetic membrane. Also, we evaluated the photocatalytic stability and durability of the biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr heterostructured membrane. The flux of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane can be completely recovered during 10 cycles (Fig. S13a†), showing good recyclability. And the structural changes of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane after 10 cycles of photocatalytic process for oil degradation were also investigated. The SEM and TEM images of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane after 10 times repeated use are provided in Fig. S14.† From Fig. S14a,† we can see that the interpenetrating fiber networks and BiOBr microspheres in the membrane were well preserved without distinct damage, which was very close to what was observed for the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane before the photocatalysis in terms of membrane structure. Besides, under HRTEM observation (Fig. S14b†), the (101) and (102) planes of BiOBr can be seen without obvious distortions. In this sense, we can infer that there were very few changes in the structure and composition of the SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane under the operating conditions, indicating superior long-term durability. Meanwhile, some other oil-in-water emulsions were also utilized to assess the self-cleaning properties. After 1 h of light irradiation, the FRRs were all higher than 98% (Fig. S13b†), higher than those of previously reported photo-induced self-cleaning membranes.21,61 Considering the flux recovery ratios (>98%) and permeation fluxes (>450 L m−2 h−1) for the separation of SSEs (Fig. 5d), our biomimetic SiO2/PANI/BiOBr membrane achieved a better balance of antifouling properties and permeation flux than a range of state-of-the-art self-cleaning membranes,18,20,61,62 indicating a great potential for the practical emulsion separation application.
Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a taro leaf-inspired heterostructured nanofibrous membrane with visible light-driven self-cleaning ability for high-flux wastewater remediation. For the first time, the nanosheet-intersected surface structure and chloroplast-structured energy conversion system of the taro leaf were synchronously integrated into a nanofibrous membrane. Benefiting from the taro leaf-like multiscale structures and hydrophilic matrix, the biomimetic membrane demonstrated superb selective wettability for water and oil with low-oil-adhesion properties. By virtue of the integrated properties of submicron pore size, high porosity, and good channel interconnectivity, the as-prepared membrane can successfully separate various emulsified oil/water mixtures, and displays a high permeation flux (maximum of 6140 L m−2 h−1) and a promising separation efficiency (TOC content <5 mg L−1), which may match well with the requirements for separating real emulsions on a mass scale. Moreover, the 3D interconnected PANI nanoshell networks served as hole conducting pathways facilitating enhanced visible light-driven organic contamination removal. This work paves the way for developing next-generation membranes that need to retain high permeability and excellent self-cleaning properties in other environment-related applications such as clean-up of oil spills and distillation.
