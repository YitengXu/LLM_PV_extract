    , Accepted 16th January 2015First published on 23rd January 2015AbstractHydrolysis of biomass for the production of glucose was studied. Silicotungstic acid (HSiW) was deposited on graphene by an ultrasound-assisted procedure. The catalyst (HSiW/G) was characterized using a variety of physico-chemical methods. Homogeneous distribution of HSiW on the surface of graphene was demonstrated. The hydrolysis of glycogen was performed with a HSiW/G catalyst by hydrothermal treatment. The yield of glucose (66 wt%) obtained was about 8 times higher than that obtained with the same amount of bare HSiW. Stability of the HSiW/graphene even after 3 repeated uses was confirmed. The mechanism of the enhancement of catalytic activity was discussed in terms of a special interaction between the graphene support and HSiW and also the appearance of hydrophobic cavities on the surface of graphene. The formation of these cavities facilitates the anchoring of glycogen to the catalyst surface and promotes the attack of protons that leads to selective, rapid, and efficient hydrolysis.
Introduction
Current energy systems are based mainly on fossil resources such as coal, petroleum and natural gas. However, the rapid consumption of natural resources has prompted researchers on finding renewable energy sources to meet increasing demand.1
Biomass is a sustainable source of organic carbon, which is considered as part of the solution to producing biofuels and chemicals.2,3 Biomass is obtainable world-wide in the form of organic materials such as grass, wood, agricultural crops and glycogen.4 Biomass hydrolysis by enzymes is a common method for biofuel production, but it has low efficiency and high cost.5 Many studies have been done on the hydrolysis of biomass to glucose with mineral acids,1,4,6 but the large scale use of acids causes several problems such as reactor corrosion, further degradation of monomers, recovery of catalysts, and requires special treatment of the acid residue producing much waste.7
Solid acid catalysts have various advantages over liquid acid catalysts, such as: simple product separation, possible recycling, and less damage to the reactor.1 Heteropoly acids (HPAs) are a type of solid acid consisting of transition metal–oxygen anion clusters. HPAs have received much attention due to their fascinating architectures and excellent physicochemical properties, such as Brønsted acidity, high proton mobility and good stability. They dissolve in polar solvents and release H+, whose acidic strength is stronger than typical mineral acids like sulfuric acid.8,9
Lately, HPAs have been widely used as homogeneous catalysts for biomass conversion. Shimizu et al. reported HPAs (H3PW12O40, H4SiW12O40) and salts of metal cations (Mn+) and PW12O403− (M3/nPW12O40) for selective hydrolysis of cellobiose and cellulose to glucose in an aqueous phase.10 In that study the glucose yield after 24 h was in the following order: H3PW12O40 (53 wt%) > H4SiW12O40 (51 wt%) > HClO4 (42 wt%) > H2SO4 (29 wt%) > H3PO4 (12 wt%). This indicates that a stronger Brønsted acid is more favourable for the hydrolysis of a glycosidic bond.10 Juan et al. investigated the potential of H3PW12O40 for the hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose under hydrothermal conditions. A remarkably high yield of glucose (50.5%) and selectivity higher than 90% at 453 K were found after 2 h.11 Ogasawara et al. showed that a highly negatively charged polyanion (H5BW12O40) promoted efficient conversion of crystalline cellulose into water-soluble saccharides in concentrated aqueous solutions (82% total yield and 77% glucose yield, based on reacting cellulose with a 0.7 M H5BW12O40 solution).12 The heteropoly acids could be separated from the homogeneous solution and recycled by extraction with diethyl ether,11 but this process takes a long time, and the extraction is not complete. Some traces of the catalyst remain in the product.
Graphene has received much attention from researchers in the past few years due to its exceptional electronic, mechanical, and optical properties, high surface area, and biocompatibility. It is used in various applications including electrochemical, biosensors,13 transistors for nano-electronics,14 solar cells15etc. Because of its excellent adsorptive ability, graphene is also used as a support for heterogeneous catalysts. J. M. Yang et al. loaded platinum nanoparticles on sulfonated graphene and used it as a conductive polymer for fuel-cell applications.16 S. M. Choi et al. synthesized surface-functionalized graphene nanosheets (GNS) with 80 wt% Pt loading with a particle size of less than 3 nm. These Pt/GNS catalysts provided improved mass specific activity in alcohol electro-oxidation.17 Polyoxometalate–graphene composites were recently exploited for supercapacitor and electrocatalytic (nitrite electro-oxidation) applications.18,19
Graphene supported catalysts have also demonstrated high activity in biomass conversion.1,20 Supported solid acid catalysts on graphene oxide and on sulfonated graphene oxide nanosheets have been prepared by Wei et al.21 The experimental results indicated that the catalytic activity of the synthesized catalyst was superior to that of other solid acid catalysts and also better than that of H2SO4. They assigned the high activity of the catalyst to the formation of hydrophobic cavities on the graphene sheet containing oxygen groups on its surface. Kitano et al. reported on the enhancement of the hydrolysis of β-1,4-glucan on graphene-based amorphous carbon bearing SO3H, COOH, and OH groups. Their results suggested that the synergistic combination of high densities of the functional groups bonded to amorphous carbon causes the efficient hydrolysis of β-1,4-glucan including cellulose.22
Glycogen, a water soluble polysaccharide of glucose (Scheme 1), is a better feedstock for glucose production than lignocellulosic biomass as it needs no additional pre-treatment. The synthesis of glycogen from CO2 by photosynthesis and its subsequent hydrolysis to glucose with high selectivity make glycogen an abundant and renewable feedstock for the production of glucose.23 Even though animal remains are the only source of glycogen as of now, currently immense research is underway to produce glycogen from cyanobacteria whereas CO2 is used as feedstock for glycogen synthesis.24 Owing to such possibilities, strategies need to be developed for the effective conversion of glycogen to glucose, which was the objective of this study.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structure of glycogen, a rich and abundant source of glucose. 
The hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose is a critical step in the production of bioethanol and other value added chemicals. In the previous work Gedanken et al. converted glycogen to glucose with HCl and HPAs as a catalyst. The glucose yields obtained with HCl and HSiW catalysts were 62 and 63 wt%, respectively.4 However, the process was corrosive and the product separation after the hydrolysis was time consuming and involved organic solvents.4 We believe that the development of a new supported catalyst can overcome these disadvantages.
In this article we report on a new silicotungstic acid (HSiW) catalyst supported on graphene (HSiW/G). The catalyst preparation was performed by a sonochemical method which has been proven to be an effective technique for the synthesis of supported catalysts.25,26 The catalytic activity of HSiW/G was studied for the hydrolysis of glycogen. This supported catalyst could be easily separated from the reaction mixture. The physical and chemical properties of the catalysts were studied by the following methods: X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), N2 isothermal adsorption–desorption (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, BET), FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, and dynamic light scattering (DLS).
Results and discussion
Catalyst characterization
The morphology of the catalyst HSiW/G was studied by using HR-SEM (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  HR-SEM images of (a) commercial graphene and (b) graphene coated with HSiW using the sonochemical method. 
Sheets with layered structures were observed in the case of commercial graphene (Fig. 1a). The HSiW/G catalyst showed randomly oriented spherical particles of HSiW, in the range of 100–250 nm, on the graphene sheets (Fig. 1b). It could be seen that the original smooth surface of graphene was partly changed after deposition of HSiW, but the layered structure of graphene was not destroyed. The amount of HSiW on graphene was found to be 2.5 wt% by ICP analysis.
The influence of sonication on the morphology and size of HSiW was studied by TEM and DLS analysis. The TEM image indicated that after 1 h of sonication of HSiW in ethanol without graphene, spherical HSiW nanoparticles were formed with sizes in the range of 100–400 nm (Fig. 2(b)). After the same period (1 h) of regular stirring of HSiW in ethanol the spherical particles of a slightly larger size in the range of 200–500 nm were found (Fig. 2(a)). In addition to the large particles, very small particles were also observed in both treatments. The TEM results confirmed that the spherical nanoparticles on the surface of graphene shown in Fig. 1 were indeed HSiW.
 Fig. 2  TEM images of the HSiW after (a) 1 h stirring and (b) 1 h sonication. 
In addition to TEM, DLS analysis was also employed to measure the particle size of HSiW upon different treatments (Fig. 3). The results were in agreement with the TEM images. It was found that with an increase in the sonication time from 15 to 60 min the average particle size decreased from 380 to 340 nm. Jafari et al. made similar observations in the reduction of particle size of colloidal nanosilica from 170 to 60 nm as the sonication time is increased from 0.25 to 60 min.27 Such a reduction of particle size results in an improved catalytic performance of HSiW/G in the hydrolysis process.

The XRD patterns of the commercial graphene and HSiW/G catalyst are shown in Fig. S1.† A sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 28° indicating an interlayer distance of 0.335 nm is typical of graphene. The XRD results of HSiW/G are similar to those of graphene, which indicates that the HSiW adsorption process does not change the lattice constants of graphene.
The amount of HSiW on graphene (2.5 wt%) was analyzed by ICP. This loading of HSiW on the catalyst is too low to be detected by XRD. Even with the higher loadings of HSiW (10 wt%) in the HSiW/G, the XRD pattern did not change. This could be due to the amorphous nature of HSiW on graphene.
The textural properties of HSiW/G catalysts were studied by BET analysis (Table 1).

The BET specific surface area for HSiW supported on graphene with 2.5% loading reached 52 m2 g−1. The data in Table 1 show that the specific surface area of the HSiW/G catalysts is reduced by 30% as compared to the commercial graphene. The surface area of pure solid HSiW is only 1.8 m2 g−1. Thus, the deposition of HSiW on graphene with HSiW led to a better dispersion of active components onto the graphene surface. The pore size and pore volume of the HSiW/G are slightly small compared to the commercial graphene. This could be because of partial blocking of the small graphene pores (diameter ≈ 1.2 nm)28 with the HSiW Keggin (≈1.5 nm) units.
The FT-IR spectra of the bare graphene, HSiW and HSiW/G catalyst are shown in Fig. 4. As shown before by P. S. Wate et al.,29 the FT-IR spectra of graphene did not show any significant absorption peaks over the range of 400–2000 cm−1.
 Fig. 4  FT-IR spectra of graphene, HSiW/G and HSiW. 
The FT-IR spectrum of HSiW demonstrated four characteristic peaks at 1020, 982, 921, and 798 cm−1 that are assigned to the stretching modes of Si–O, WO, W–Oe–W, and W–Oc–W, respectively.30
In the spectrum of HSiW/G the peaks in the region of 1020–780 cm−1 are very weak and slightly shifted to lower wavelengths. This shift indicates a strong interaction between graphene and the catalyst, causing the weakening of the various bonds. A similar effect was observed by Chen et al.30 upon stabilization of HSiW by organic molecules. The FT-IR results clearly demonstrated the fact that HSiW was effectively deposited on graphene and its strong interaction with the support.
The Raman spectra of the bare graphene, HSiW and HSiW/G catalyst are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Raman spectrum of graphene in full range (a), and Raman spectra of graphene, HSiW and HSiW/G (b). Dashed blue lines are eye-guides. 
The most prominent features in the Raman spectra of graphene are the G-band appearing at 1587 cm−1 and the D-band appearing at 1353 cm−1 (Fig. 5a). The G-band represents the planar configuration sp2 bonded carbon that constitutes the graphene lattice. It is associated with the doubly degenerate (iTO and LO) phonon mode (E2g symmetry). The D-band corresponds to the disordered sample or to the edge of a graphene.31,32
The Raman spectroscopy technique was used extensively for observing the Keggin structure and also for proving its presence on the graphene.28,33,34 The Raman spectrum of commercial HSiW (Fig. 5b) showed the most intense bands at 1000 cm−1, 974 cm−1, 551 cm−1 and 224 cm−1 assigned to stretching of WO, bending of W–Oc–W, O–Si–O, and WO3 vibrations, respectively. These signals are typical of Keggin structure.28 In order to study the possible interaction between HSiW and the graphene support we focused on the Raman spectral domain of HSiW (Fig. 5b).
The Raman spectrum of HSiW/G is similar to that of the bare heteropoly acid. The spectrum showed peaks at 998 cm−1, 866 cm−1 and 218 cm−1 for the WO stretching, W–Oc–W bending mode, and WO3 bending, indicating the preservation of the Keggin structure of the HSiW on the surface of graphene. However, a shift in two bending modes is noticed. The W–O–W and WO3 modes decreased from 879 to 866 cm−1 and from 224 to 218 cm−1, respectively. Such a shift might be due to the strong interaction of HSiW with the graphene support, which correlates with the FT-IR result. A similar shift to lower wave-numbers was also observed in the Raman spectra of HSiW deposited on Al2O3 and SiO2.28,33,34
XRD, Raman and HR-SEM studies indicated that the graphene layers are not damaged during sonochemical synthesis of the HSiW/G catalyst. Based on the Raman results it could also be argued that the units of the HSiW were not destroyed during the deposition and they are well dispersed on the surface of graphene. The HSiW is homogeneously distributed on the surface of graphene and strongly anchored to the support. Even after the catalytic hydrolysis of glycogen, the bands corresponding to HSiW were observed in the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 4).
The sonochemical deposition of HSiW on the graphene substrate is presented in Scheme 2.

Our explanation of the ultrasound assisted coating is based on the phenomena of cavitation, formation, growth and implosive collapse of the acoustic bubbles in the liquids. The nanoparticles (NPs) of HSiW created in the liquid under ultrasound waves are thrown to the solid by microjets and shock waves, which are the after effects of the cavitation collapse.35,36 The speed and power of the microjets are extremely high (>500 m s−1), causing the strong anchoring of the NPs to the surface of the substrate. Low frequency ultrasound has diverse applications. Fang et al. utilized ultrasound for promoting a variety of crucial reactions (dewaxing, removal of impurities, particle size reduction, isolation of chemicals from biomass, delignification, fractionation, reduction of crystallinity and acceleration of saccharification and fermentation) involved in the conversion of biomass to biofuels.37 Shewale et al. utilized the potential of 20 kHz ultrasound for the particle size reduction of sorghum slurry from 302 to 115 μm (38%) which resulted in improved glucose yield. The particle size reduction was due to the disruption of the protein matrix and the amylose–lipid complexes surrounding the starch granules.38 Such physical effects that are due to acoustic cavitation were well documented.39
Glycogen hydrolysis under hydrothermal reaction conditions
The glycogen hydrolysis was carried out under hydrothermal conditions in an autoclave. 13C NMR spectra of the products obtained with three types of catalysts (bare HSiW, bare graphene and HSiW/G) are shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  
13C NMR spectra of hydrolyzate obtained with (a) bare graphene, (b) HSiW/G and (c) HSiW (reaction conditions: 0.1 g glycogen; 0.1 g catalyst; 2 mL water; 100 °C; 1 h). 
As suspected, no glycogen conversion was observed when only graphene was used as the catalyst (Fig. 6a). With HSiW, complete conversion of glycogen to glucose (60.3 (C6), 69.2 (C4), 72.4 (C2), 73.7 (C3), 75.3 (C5), 92 (C 1α) and 95.3 (C 1β)) was obtained (Fig. 6c). With the HSiW/G catalyst, in addition to glucose, some traces of unreacted glycogen (60.6, 69.4, 71.2, 71.6, 71.8, 73.4, 76.8, 99.6 ppm) were also noticed (Fig. 6b), indicating that the hydrolysis is not complete. This fact can be explained because of the low content of the HSiW in the catalyst. According to the ICP analysis, the content of HSiW in the HSiW/G catalyst was found to be 2.5 wt%. In other words, the amount of HSiW in the 0.1 g HSiW/G catalyst used for the hydrolysis reaction is 0.0025 g. It is interesting to note that even at such a low loading of the solid acid, the synthesized catalyst is effective for the hydrolysis of glycogen. In addition, under the reaction conditions used, the hydrolysis of glycogen was selective. No by-products such as hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), levulinic acid and formic acid were formed. When the hydrolysis of glycogen was previously performed with HCl in a microwave, these by-products were observed.4
For optimizing the glycogen hydrolysis process with HSiW/G and detailed study, the reaction was performed in a larger reaction batch of 20 mL at different reaction times, temperatures and wt/wt% ratio of catalyst and glycogen. The products obtained under various reaction conditions were analyzed by HPLC analysis, and the results are presented in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Glucose yield (wt%) from glycogen hydrolysis as a function of reaction time and temperature (reaction conditions: 1 g glycogen; 1 g HSiW/G catalyst; 20 mL water). 
A representative HPLC chromatogram recorded on the hydrolyzate obtained from the hydrolysis of glycogen is shown in Fig. S2.† The retention time was detected in control experiments with different amounts of glucose. The peak with a retention time of 12.3 min is attributed to glucose.
After 2 h at 120 °C no glucose was found. The absence of glucose at 120 °C in the series of experiments with a large batch (20 mL) compared to the formation of glucose at 100 °C with the small batch (2 mL) is, probably, due to the higher volume needing a longer time and higher temperature to obtain the appropriate pressure in the vessel compared to the one used with the small batch. When the reaction time was increased at the same temperature, the yield of glucose was 26 wt% (Fig. 7).
At 150 °C after 2 h the yield of glucose was 55 wt%. Prolonging the reaction time to 4 h increased the glucose yield to 66 wt%. It is clear that higher temperatures lead to higher product yields. As a result, the reaction time of 4 h at 150 °C was chosen to be the optimal conditions with the highest yield of glucose.
The weight ratio of the catalyst (HSiW/G) to glycogen was varied in the range 1–0.25. The yields of glucose generated from hydrolysis of glycogen with various amounts of catalyst are depicted in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Glucose yield from glycogen hydrolysis at different weight ratios of HSiW/G to glycogen (glycogen – 1 g; HSiW/G – 1, 0.5 and 0.25 g; time – 4 h; temperature – 150 °C). *Bare HSiW – 0.025 g (this corresponds to the amount of HSiW present in the HSiW/G catalyst at a ratio of HSiW/G to glycogen 1:1). 
It was observed that at a hydrolysis temperature of 150 °C for 4 h, the yield of glucose for all of the examined ratios of HSiW/G to glycogen (1:1; 0.5:1 and 0.25:1) was almost the same (65 wt%). When same amount of bare HSiW as that present in the supported catalyst (HSiW/G) was used as a catalyst, the glucose yield was dramatically low (8.2%). Thus, the bare HSiW is about 8 times less active than HSiW deposited on graphene. The increase of the catalytic activity of the supported HSiW compared to the bare HSiW could be due to the effective and uniform distribution of the heteropoly acid on the surface of graphene. Moreover, the HSiW/G catalyst has a larger specific surface area (52 m2 g−1) compared to bare HSiW (1.8 m2 g−1). The large surface area enables an effective contact between the uniformly distributed acid sites on the graphene surface and the glycogen that promotes the rapid, effective and efficient catalytic reaction.
The observed enhanced activity of HSiW/G could be due to the strong binding of the heteropoly anions to the aromatic π-cloud on the graphene surface (similar to π–π interactions) leading to higher accessibility of the protons for the cleavage of the glycosidic bond in glycogen. Kim et al. reported similar strong electrostatic interactions between polyoxometalate and rGO.18 In contrast, in the case of bare HSiW, the protons of the polyanion rotate freely in the reaction medium and are in constant motion. As a result, the probable interaction between the protons and the reactant (glycogen) is low, resulting in lower yields of glucose.
We have further evaluated the stability of HSiW/G in the hydrolysis of glycogen. After the first run under optimal hydrothermal conditions (1 g HSiW/G, 1 g glycogen, 20 mL water, 150 °C, 4 h) the HSiW/G was separated from the aqueous product mixture by centrifugation. The collected catalyst was dried under vacuum overnight and subsequently reused for the second and third runs under identical reaction conditions. The results as measured by HPLC analysis are presented in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Recyclability of the HSiW/G catalyst in the hydrolysis of glycogen (reaction conditions: 1 g of glycogen; 1 g of the solid acid catalyst; 20 mL of H2O; 150 °C; 4 h). The catalyst was recovered by 9000 rpm centrifugation for reuse. 
The glucose yield after three reaction cycles was still high (63.3 wt%) indicating that HSiW can be reused without loss in catalytic activity. Even after three repeated runs, the amount of HSiW on graphene was found to be 2.2 wt%. This indicates that the catalyst is not just a physical mixture but a supported system wherein the active component (HSiW) is strongly adhered to the support (graphene). The good catalyst stability could be due to the use of the sonochemical deposition method which leads to the strong adherence of HSiW to the support.40,41 The catalyst can serve also in a hydrothermal flow system, since the HSiW will not leach out easily.
It is difficult to explain the excellent catalytic activity of HSiW/G in the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond due only to the higher surface area and homogeneous deposition of HSiW on the graphene surface. Wei et al. attributed the excellent catalytic activity of sulfonated graphene oxide (sGO) in the hydrolysis of cellobiose and isoflavones to the interaction between the anions of the side chains of the catalyst and the reactants. In addition to hydrophilic groups, sGO has hydrophobic, flexible graphene sheets that can help to form hydrophobic cavities on the graphene surface. This adsorbent microregion has affinity for certain reactants.21
We suppose that the mechanism of interaction between HSiW/G and glycogen was similar to the one discussed in ref. 21. Namely, the hydrophobic graphene sheets of HSiW/G first provide hydrophobic cavities to the glycogen on the surface of the catalyst. Then the hydrophobic parts (carbon rings) of the glycogen are encapsulated by the graphene, and the hydrophilic parts (OH and O) form hydrogen bonds with the heteropoly acid on the graphene surface. In addition to the H+ and different metal–oxygen bonds, the heteropoly acid inherently contains water molecules within the crystal structure that contribute to the hydrophilic nature of the catalyst. A combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions on the catalyst surface leads to an increased concentration of glycogen on the catalyst surface and thereby contributes to the enhancement of hydrolysis rate and selectivity. Afterwards, the protons ionized from the catalyst support attack the glycosidic bond and catalyze the hydrolysis of glycogen. Finally, the glycosidic bond is broken owing to the hydrolysis of the reactant.
Therefore, the catalyst is prospective, selective, and efficient for biomass hydrolysis. Moreover, the usefulness of the catalyst was tested for the hydrolysis of cellulose under the optimal reaction conditions (4 h, 150 °C). A glucose yield value of 33 wt% was obtained, indicating the activity of the catalyst (HSiW/G) for cellulose hydrolysis. Therefore, the catalyst designed could be used for the hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass. Shimuzu et al. reported a glucose yield value of 15% in a H3PW12O40 catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis process under hydrothermal conditions (150 °C, 2 h). Moreover, prior to the hydrolysis process, the cellulose was pretreated for 48 h under ball milling.10 Tian et al. reported a glucose yield value of 50.5 wt% from the hydrolysis of cellulose in the presence of the H3P12O40 catalyst under hydrothermal conditions (180 °C; 3 h).11 A high glucose yield value of 75.6 wt% was reported by Li et al. from the hydrolysis of cellulose under microwave irradiation using conc. H3PW12O40 as the catalyst.42 The above comparison with the recent reports on cellulose hydrolysis clearly indicates the advantage of the current process being based on the use of a heterogeneous catalyst unlike the homogeneous nature of the catalyst reported.10,11,42 Even under modest hydrolysis conditions glucose yield values of 33 and 66 wt% were obtained from cellulose and glycogen, respectively, using the HSiW/G catalyst.
For comparing the effect of the catalyst preparation method on its activity, glycogen hydrolysis was also carried out under identical reaction conditions, using the HSiW/G catalyst prepared by the impregnation method. A glucose yield value of 40 wt% was observed relative to the value of 66 wt% that was obtained using the catalyst prepared by the sonochemical route. In addition, the hydrolyzate was found to be acidic (pH 1–2) in the case of impregnation based catalysts unlike the near neutral (pH 6) nature of the hydrolyzate generated using sonochemical based catalysts. This result indicates a strong interaction between the HSiW and graphene in the catalyst prepared by the sonochemical method.
Experimental
Materials
Tungstosilicic acid hydrate (H4SiW12O40·nH2O, HSiW, 99%), cellulose powder (Avicel® PH-101; ∼50 μm particle size) and glycogen from bovine liver were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St Louis, MO, USA). The graphene nanoplatelets (6–8 nm thick ×15 microns wide) were purchased from STREM chemicals, Newburyport, MA, USA. The chemicals were used without further purification.
Catalyst preparation
An ultrasound-assisted method was used to prepare the supported HSiW/G catalysts. Typically, the following procedure was followed: 2 g HSiW was first dissolved in 80 mL ethanol, followed by the addition of 2 g graphene. Owing to easy evaporation, ethanol is used as the solvent. The synthesis was performed in a glass beaker reactor of 120 mL volume. The mixture was sonochemically irradiated with 1 cm2 titanium horn immersed 1 cm into the solution for 1 h with an efficiency of 40% (amplitude) with no external cooling (Sonicator 20 kHz, Sonics & Materials, VCX-750). After 1 h the temperature of the reaction slurry was 60 °C. The product was then collected by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum overnight.
In addition to the sonochemical route, the conventional impregnation method was also used for the preparation of the HSiW/G catalyst. The catalyst preparation process in the conventional impregnation method comprises of dissolving 2 g HSiW in 80 mL ethanol, followed by the addition of 2 g graphene. The mixture was kept for 4 h of stirring. Then the solvent was evaporated using a water bath followed by drying of the catalyst under vacuum overnight. The catalysts prepared in the two aforementioned routes were compared in the glycogen hydrolysis reaction.
Catalyst characterization
The XRD analysis of the HSiW/G was performed on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα – 1.541 Å radiation. The morphology and texture of the HSiW on the graphene were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) JEOL JEM-1400 (120 kV) and high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), FEI Company TM MAGELLAN 500L (Holland). The particle size distribution of HSiW (dispersed in ethanol) was estimated by the DLS method using a Malvern Zetasizer Nanoseries device (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The amount of HSiW deposited on graphene by sonication was determined by the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) method on the ULTIMA JY 2501 instrument. Surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution were measured using a Nova 3200e Quantachrome analyzer. The surface area was calculated from the linear part of the BET plot. The pore size distribution was estimated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model with the Halsey equation, and the pore volume was measured at the P/P0 0.9947 signal point.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker Tensor 27). Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope equipped with a Leica DM2500 M analysis microscope (Leica Microsystems), sample focusing was done by a 50× (N.A. 0.75) lens. All the samples were irradiated by a 514 nm excitation wavelength with a constant power of ∼0.25 mW.
Glycogen hydrolysis reaction
For the glycogen hydrolysis process a stainless steel home-made autoclave of 50 mL volume was used. Typically, 1 g glycogen and 1 g catalyst were dispersed in 20 mL water and placed in the autoclave. The autoclave was then placed in a regular air oven for the hydrothermal treatment of glycogen. Reaction parameters such as time, temperature of heating, weight ratio of the catalyst and glycogen were varied to optimize the hydrolysis process. In addition to glycogen, cellulose was also tested as carbohydrate feedstock for glucose production.
The reusability of the catalyst was investigated. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated from the solution by centrifugation and dried under vacuum overnight. The catalyst was used for a second run without regeneration under identical hydrothermal reaction conditions. The process was repeated 3 times.
The progress of the glycogen hydrolysis reaction was monitored using 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis on a Bruker Avance DPX 300 instrument. D2O was used as the solvent.
The water soluble products of catalyzed hydrolysis reactions were analyzed by HPLC (Merck-Hitachi LaChrom System L-7000 equipped with L-7455 Diode Array Detector and Schambeck SFD RI 2000 Refractive Index Detector, Bad Honnef, Germany). Analyses were carried out using a 300 × 7.8 mm Rezex-ROA ion exclusion chromatography column (Torrance, CA, USA) equipped with a matching guard column. The mobile phase used was 0.005 N H2SO4 under isocratic elution for 45 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 at ambient temperature, with an injection volume of 10 μL. EZ Chrom Elite v. 3.1.7 software was used for data acquisition and processing, with the RI signal acquired using an external analog input. The content of the glucose in the hydrolyzate was calculated using a calibration curve obtained from a series of external glucose standards.
Conclusions
Polyoxometalate (HSiW) was deposited on the surface of graphene by the sonochemical method. Physico-chemical characterization of the HSiW/G catalyst was done using HR-SEM, TEM and XRD, which demonstrated a homogeneous distribution of HSiW on the surface of graphene supports. The catalytic performance of the synthesized catalyst was evaluated for the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of biomass to glucose. The following conclusions have been drawn: the catalytic activity of HSiW/G is significantly higher than that of the bare HSiW. The hydrolysis process with HSiW/G is selective, fast and green with a high yield of glucose (66 wt%). The sonochemical method provided strong anchoring of HSiW to graphene and high stability of the catalyst. The reuse of the HSiW/G catalyst in 3 cycles was demonstrated. The glucose yield after three reaction cycles was not altered significantly, showing that HSiW/G is a reusable, economically viable and green catalyst.
