    , Accepted 19th May 2017First published on 19th May 2017AbstractWater is often believed to be the leading killer of perovskite solar cells’ efficiency. However, recent experimental results show that perovskite solar cells have higher photoelectric conversion efficiency in a suitably moist environment. In this study, the relationship between the interstitial water molecule and the theoretical maximum efficiency of the perovskite absorber layer is discussed based on density functional theory calculations. Our calculated results show that an interstitial water molecule can enlarge the effective Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which is an empirical structural parameter for the structure of the perovskite material. The primitive MAPbI3 structure is not the ideal perovskite structure with the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency. Surprisingly, appropriate interstitial water molecules are beneficial to perovskite absorbers in terms of increasing photoelectric conversion efficiency. This can be attributed to the relatively larger effective Goldschmidt tolerance factor of the perovskite structure with an interstitial water molecule, which affects the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the perovskite structure. Our calculations indicate that the perovskite absorbers with a H2O:MAPbI3 ratio of 1/4–1/2 have a relatively higher photoelectric conversion efficiency. This study helps us understand the role of the interstitial molecule in the perovskite structure deeply, which is very useful in the design and optimization of the perovskite absorbers for high-efficiency perovskite cells.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites such as CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have attracted great attention as absorbers for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) solar cells.1–9 Japanese researchers made the first perovskite-based solar cells that converted just 3.8% of the energy from sunlight into electricity.10 Since then, the development of power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has been advancing faster than that of any other solar technology introduced prior to them.11–18 The PCE of perovskite solar cells can be greater than 20%,18 which is comparable to those of commercial silicon, GaAs and CdTe solar cells.19 However, there is no end to the demand for more efficient perovskite solar cells. More recently, a power conversion efficiency up to 21% was achieved.20,21
Among the various factors that can affect the stability of perovskite materials, crystal-structure transition is an important parameter, which has received less attention. Materials with ABX3 composition can adopt different crystal structures depending on the size and interaction of the A cation and the corner-sharing BX6 octahedra.22–25 The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is a reliable empirical index to predict which structure is preferentially formed.26 In general, materials with a tolerance factor of 0.9–1.0 have a cubic perovskite structure. Non-perovskite structures are formed when the tolerance factor is higher (>1) or lower (<0.71). Advancing perovskite solar cell technologies toward their maximum efficiency requires delicate control over the structural parameters. Recent experimental and theoretical results show that the perovskite (FA-Cs)PbI3 alloying absorbers with effective tolerance factors around 0.94–0.98 have the best device performance.27 Thus, tuning the effective tolerance factor is proposed as a potential design strategy to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of a perovskite structure.
It is well known that it is very easy for the water (H2O) molecule to leak into the perovskite structure and decrease the optical absorption peak.28,29 Interestingly, Zhou et al. reported that a MAPbI3−xClx film grown at 30% relative humidity in air exhibited enhanced optoelectronic properties compared to a film grown in a dry environment.2 In addition, Kelsey's experimental results also show that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the perovskite in a moist environment is larger than those in a dry environment.30 In general, the fabrication of most perovskite solar cells was conducted in air or solution at low temperatures, which would induce an interstitial H2O molecule in the perovskite structure. Thus, a deep understanding of the relationship between the interstitial H2O molecule and the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the perovskite structure is needed for designing high-efficiency solar cells.
In this study, first-principles calculations were carried out to systematically examine the correlation between the effective Goldschmidt tolerance factor and the theoretical maximum efficiency. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor of a primitive MAPbI3 perovskite structure is 0.92, whose structural parameter is not good enough to obtain a higher photoelectric conversion efficiency. Our calculation results show that the interstitial H2O molecules can seep into the perovskite MAPbI3 structure easily with a negative sorption energy. In addition, the H2O molecules tend to gather in the MAPbI3 structure with a lower concentration. Interestingly, interstitial H2O molecules permit higher effective tolerance factors for the perovskite structures. More importantly, the MA(H2O)xPbI3 perovskite structures, which have the highest theoretical maximum efficiency, have an appropriate effective tolerance factor with a suitable H2O:MAPbI3 ratio x. Our results can be used to explain the relatively higher photoelectric conversion efficiency at a suitable amount of moisture in lead halide perovskites. In addition, the relationship of the effective Goldschmidt tolerance factor and the theoretical maximum efficiency of the perovskite is very important in designing and optimizing perovskite absorbers for highly efficient perovskite cells.
2. Computational method
The first-principles calculations were performed by the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)31,32 to study the structure, energy and optical absorption. Projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials33 were used to account for the electron–ion interactions. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE functional34 was used to treat the exchange–correlation interaction between the electrons. In order to get the appropriate doping concentration, 2 × 2 × 1 MAPbI3 supercells were used in our calculation. The energy cut off was set to 500 eV and a 5 × 5 × 7 Monkhorst–Pack scheme was used to sample the Brillouin zone.35 The full geometry optimizations were carried out with convergence thresholds of 10−4 eV and 1 × 10−2 eV Å−1 for total energy and ionic force, respectively. It is well known that vdW interactions are crucial in the determination of the equilibrium configurations in the hybrid perovskite structure. Thus, the DFT-D3 approach was used to consider the effect of the vdW interaction.36
To investigate the ability of the H2O molecule to infiltrate MAPbI3, the sorption energy (Ea) is calculated. The sorption energy of the H2O molecule infiltration to MAPbI3 is defined as follows, Ea = (EMA(H2O)xPbI3 − EMAPbI3 − nEH2O)/n(1)where Ea, EMA(H2O)PbI3, EMAPbI3, EH2O, and n represent the sorption energy per H2O molecule, the total energy of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 supercell, the total energy of the primitive MAPbI3 supercell, the total energy of the single H2O molecule, and the number of interstitial H2O molecules, respectively. To investigate the effect of water, different ratios between water and MA are considered. Herein, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 interstitial H2O molecules infiltrating into the 16 MAPbI3 supercells corresponded to x ratios of 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1, respectively.
Among the various factors that could affect the stability of perovskite materials, crystal-structure transition is an important one that has received less attention. Materials with ABX3 composition can adapt different crystal structures depending on the size and interaction of the A cation and the corner-sharing BX6 octahedra. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor is calculated based on the ionic radius of the atoms using the following expression: .
The Goldschmidt tolerance factor26 (t) is the key index to predict the ABX3 perovskite structure. For MA(H2O)xPbI3 perovskite materials, the A, B, and X respond to the MA(H2O)x+, Pb2+, and I− compounds, respectively. The interstitial H2O in the vacancy of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structure will noticeably enlarge the effective size of the A-ion rA. Thus, the effective tolerance factor (teff) changes because of the interstitial H2O, which can affect the efficiency of the solar cells. The effective tolerance factor (teff) of the perovskite structure is calculated using a previously published approach.27,37 The weighted average of the atomic ratio of the two different cations is used to estimate the effective cation size. For a composition of MA(H2O)xPbI3 perovskite structure, reff = xrMA+(H2O) + (1 − x)rMA+(2) (3)where rMA+ is the radius of the MA+ cation, rMA+(H2O) is the radius of the complex of one MA+ cation and one H2O molecule, x is the ratio of the H2O molecule and MAPbI3 component, reff is the effective radius of the complex of one MA+ cation and H2O molecule, rPb2+ is the radius of the Pb2+ cation, and rI− is the radius of the I− anion.
3. Results and discussions
Before structure optimization of the H2O molecule infiltration into MAPbI3, the lattice constants of the tetragonal MAPbI3 unit cell were relaxed. The relaxed lattice constants, a = 8.72 Å and c = 12.92 Å, agreed well with the experimental results.38 Then, we fully optimized the H2O molecule infiltration to 2 × 2 × 1 MAPbI3 supercells. Several types of MA(H2O)xPbI3 structures with different x ratios were considered in this study. The 2 × 2 × 1 MAPbI3 supercells contained 16 MA components. In order to determine the effect of water, different ratios between water and MA are considered. Herein, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 interstitial H2O molecules infiltrated into the MAPbI3 supercells corresponded to x ratios of 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1, respectively. It was easy to obtain the geometry configuration of the MAPbI3 supercell with one interstitial H2O molecule (Fig. S1(a) in the ESI†). However, there were numerous types of geometry configurations for multiple H2O molecules infiltrated into the MAPbI3 supercells. To obtain reasonable configurations for several interstitial H2O molecules in the MAPbI3 supercells, we first calculated the total energies of 13 different types of MA(H2O)1/8PbI3 supercells with two interstitial H2O molecules. Based on the configuration of MA(H2O)1/8PbI3 structures with low total energies, we built the configurations for MAPbI3 supercells with more than three interstitial H2O molecules. Our sorption energy calculations demonstrate that the MA(H2O)1/4PbI3 supercell with four H2O molecules located on the same layer with a quadrangle planar molecular geometry is the most stable interstitial H2O configuration in the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structure, shown in Fig. 1.

The calculated sorption energy is −0.548, −0.550, −0.557, −0.562, −0.539, −0.433 and −0.435 eV for the 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and 1 H2O:MAPbI3 ratios, respectively. The sorption energy curve is plotted in Fig. 2 with a green dotted line. It is well known that the Jahn–Teller distortion results in a relatively higher total energy in the crystal structure. Thus, the lowest sorption energy appears in the MA(H2O)1/4PbI3 structure with symmetrical H2O distribution. The sorption energy calculation indicates that the H2O molecules tend to gather in the same layer of the MAPbI3 structure with a lower H2O:MAPbI3 ratio. All the considered sorption energies are smaller than zero, which means that the perovskite structure is unstable in a high humidity condition. In addition, the calculated band gaps of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 supercells are depicted in Fig. 2 (violet diamond line). According to the band gap curve, the value of the band gap increases with the increasing number of interstitial H2O molecules. The calculated band gap is 1.51, 1.53, 1.55, 1.56, 1.63, 1.75 and 1.92 eV for the 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1 H2O:MAPbI3 ratios, respectively. Compared to the 1.501 eV band gap of a primitive MAPbI3 supercell, the interstitial H2O molecule enhances the band gap of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 supercell. Angelis et al. (ref. 28) studied the surface-water interaction as well as the penetration of water into the framework by ab initio MD calculations. Angelis et al. reported a similar finding that water incorporation leads to an opening of the band-gap in tetragonal MAPbI3. In general, the band gap of the semiconductor plays a key role in optical absorption. Thus, it is necessary to investigate whether the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structure has some fascinating optical properties.

The application-oriented properties are crucial parameters for perovskite solar devices, particularly for the optical absorption properties and the theoretical maximum efficiency from their basic electronic structures. The optical absorption spectrum of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structures with different x ratios is shown in Fig. 3. The absorption peak of MA(H2O)xPbI3 with different x ratios 0, 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1 are located at 3.30, 3.15, 3.13, 3.09, 2.59, 2.98, and 3.07 eV, respectively. According to the semiconductor photonic energy E = ħω, the corresponding absorbing wavelength is 377, 394, 397, 403, 405, 480, 417, and 405 nm. In contrast to the primitive MAPbI3, the optical absorption peak of MA(H2O)xPbI3 shows a red-shift towards the visible light region over the x range of 0–1/2. However, the peak value of the optical absorption peak is reduced with increasing x ratio over the range of 0–1/2. It should be noted that the optical absorption spectrum of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structures itself cannot explain why MA(H2O)xPbI3 structures have the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency in the 0–1/2 H2O:MAPbI3 ratio. The optical absorption significantly reduces when more and more H2O molecules are inserted into the perovskite MAPbI3 structures, such as x = 3/4, or x = 1. The main reason should be that the enormous H2O molecules destroy the perovskite structures, which results in a sharp reduction of optical absorption, as discussed in previous studies.28,29
 Fig. 3  The calculated optical absorption spectra of the H2O molecule inserted into MAPbI3 with different H2O:MAPbI3 ratios. The black, red, green, blue, cyan, violet, and yellow lines represent the optical absorption spectra of the H2O molecule inserted into MAPbI3 with a H2O:MAPbI3 ratio of 0, 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1, respectively. 
In general, the effect of the optical absorption coefficient is not considered in the well-known Shockley–Queisser limit.39 The theoretical maximum efficiency depends on the thickness of the absorber layer.40,41 Yin et al.42,43 calculated the thickness-dependent maximum solar cell parameters of CH3NH3PbI3 based on the Fermi Golden rule. According to the Fermi Golden rule, the optical absorption of a photonic energy ℏω is directly correlated to , where 〈v|Ĥ|c〉 is the transition matrix from the states in the valence band (VB) to the states in the conduction band (CB) and the integration is over the whole reciprocal space. Using this approach, we have calculated the maximum efficiencies of some common light absorbers as a function of the thickness of the absorber layers, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The efficiency curves show that the MA(H2O)1/2PbI3 structure has the highest conversion efficiency (violet line), while the MA(H2O)1PbI3 structure has the lowest conversion efficiency (brown line) among all the considered structures. The MA(H2O)1/2PbI3 exhibits high theoretical maximum conversion efficiencies (beyond 30%) with a 3 μm absorber. In order to study the relationship between the theoretical maximum efficiencies and the effective Goldschmidt tolerance factor t, the maximum efficiencies of MA(H2O)xPbI3 with a 3 μm absorber and the corresponding effective t factors of MA(H2O)xPbI3 are plotted on one graph, as shown in Fig. 4(b). At low x ratios (x < 1/2), the maximum efficiency of MA(H2O)xPbI3 increases slowly with an increase in the interstitial H2O molecules. However, the maximum efficiency of MA(H2O)xPbI3 decreases rapidly when the x ratio is larger than 1/2. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is the key index for predicting the perovskite structure, which is closely related to the power conversion efficiencies. We note that the MA(H2O)1/2PbI3 structure has the highest maximum efficiency of 30.3% with a corresponding 0.99 effective tolerance factor. In addition, the maximum efficiency of the MA(H2O)1/4PbI3 structure also reaches 30.0% with a 0.95 effective tolerance factor. Based on our calculations, we can conclude that the effective tolerance factor of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structure affects the photoelectric conversion efficiency. For the primitive MAPbI3 structure, the tolerance factor is 0.92, which is not usually believed to be the best absorber layer for the perovskite solar cell.27 Interestingly, suitable interstitial H2O molecules can permit a higher effective tolerance factor and a resulting higher photoelectric conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the 1/4–1/2 H2O:MAPbI3 perovskite absorbers have the best device performance with effective tolerance factors around 0.95–0.99 (green shaded area), which agrees with previous theoretical and experimental results.27,44–46

The black, red, green, blue, cyan, violet, and yellow lines represent the maximum efficiencies of the H2O molecule inserted into MAPbI3 with H2O:MAPbI3 ratios of 0, 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1, respectively. (b) The calculated maximum efficiencies with a 3 μm absorber and the corresponding effective tolerance factor of the H2O molecule inserted into MAPbI3 with different H2O:MAPbI3 ratios. The blue and red lines represent the maximum efficiencies with a 3 μm absorber and the effective tolerance factors, respectively. 
To get a deeper understanding of the electronic properties of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structure, the total density of states (DOS) of four typical structures are plotted in Fig. 5(a). The results show that more the number of interstitial H2O molecules, larger are the electronic states at the upper valence bands (VBs), which means that the interstitial H2O molecules enhance the electronic states at the upper valence bands (VBs) in the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structure. To further explore the origin of the enhanced electronic states at the upper VBs, the partial density of states (PDOS) of I-5p, Pb-6s, and Pb-6p are plotted in Fig. 5(b), (c) and (d), respectively. The PDOS shows that the enhanced electronic states in the upper VBs are mainly contributed by the I 5p orbitals mixed with a small component of Pb 6s orbitals, while the lower parts of the conduction bands (CBs) of the lead halide perovskites are mainly derived from the unoccupied Pb 6p orbitals. In lead halide perovskites, the direct bandgap at the G point is due to the strong s–p and p–p coupling in Oh symmetry.42 With more I 5p electronic states at the upper VBs in the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structures, the strong s–p and p–p coupling push the lower parts of CBs to a higher energy level and result in a larger band gap. Thus, more the number of interstitial H2O molecules, larger is the band gap of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structures. The detailed band structures of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structures are shown in Fig. S2 (in the ESI†).

4. Conclusion
Based on density functional theory calculations, the correlation between the effective Goldschmidt tolerance factor and the theoretical maximum efficiency of the perovskite MAPbI3 structure are discussed. Interestingly, interstitial H2O molecules can seep into the perovskite MAPbI3 structure easily, and the MA(H2O)xPbI3 supercell with a H2O:MAPbI3 ratio of 1/4 has the lowest average H2O molecule sorption energy. This means that the H2O molecules tend to gather in the MAPbI3 structure with a lower concentration. More importantly, interstitial H2O molecules can permit higher effective tolerance factors in the perovskite MA(H2O)xPbI3 structure, and its theoretical maximum efficiency is higher than that of the primitive MAPbI3 perovskite structures at low x ratios. The MA(H2O)1/2PbI3 perovskite structures have the highest theoretical maximum efficiency with a 0.99 effective tolerance factor. Furthermore, the theoretical maximum efficiencies of perovskite absorbers with the H2O:MAPbI3 ratio of 1/4–1/2 are relatively high, corresponding to effective tolerance factors of around 0.95–0.99. The relation of the effective Goldschmidt tolerance factor and the theoretical maximum efficiency of the perovskite can be applied to the design and optimization of perovskite absorbers for highly efficient perovskite cells.

 	Fig. 1  (a) The top view and (b) the side view of the relaxed H2O molecular insert MA(H2O)1/4PbI3 structures. The silver, violet, blue, brown, pink, and red balls represent Pb, I, N, C, H, and O atoms, respectively. The red dashed circles are the positions of the interstitial H2O molecules.	 

 	Fig. 2  The relationship between band gap and formation energy for the H2O:MAPbI3 system with different ratios of MA and H2O.	 

 	Fig. 3  The calculated optical absorption spectra of the H2O molecule inserted into MAPbI3 with different H2O:MAPbI3 ratios. The black, red, green, blue, cyan, violet, and yellow lines represent the optical absorption spectra of the H2O molecule inserted into MAPbI3 with a H2O:MAPbI3 ratio of 0, 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) The calculated maximum efficiencies of the H2O molecule inserted into MAPbI3 with different H2O:MAPbI3 ratios. The black, red, green, blue, cyan, violet, and yellow lines represent the maximum efficiencies of the H2O molecule inserted into MAPbI3 with H2O:MAPbI3 ratios of 0, 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1, respectively. (b) The calculated maximum efficiencies with a 3 μm absorber and the corresponding effective tolerance factor of the H2O molecule inserted into MAPbI3 with different H2O:MAPbI3 ratios. The blue and red lines represent the maximum efficiencies with a 3 μm absorber and the effective tolerance factors, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) The total DOS, (b) I-5p DOS, (c) Pb-6s DOS, and (d) Pb-6p DOS of the H2O molecular insert MAPbI3 with four typical H2O:MAPbI3 ratios. The black, blue, violet, and yellow lines represent the DOS of the MA(H2O)xPbI3 structures with x values of 0, 1/4, 1/2, and 1, respectively.
