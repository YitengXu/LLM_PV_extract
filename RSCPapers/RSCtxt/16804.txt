    , Accepted 3rd July 2015First published on 23rd July 2015AbstractSupported Fe2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites are fabricated by an original vapor phase synthetic strategy, consisting of the initial growth of Fe2O3 nanosystems on fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates by plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition, followed by atomic layer deposition of TiO2 overlayers with variable thickness, and final thermal treatment in air. A thorough characterization of the target systems is carried out by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, field emission-scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. High purity nanomaterials characterized by the co-presence of Fe2O3 (hematite) and TiO2 (anatase), with an intimate Fe2O3–TiO2 contact, are successfully obtained. In addition, photocatalytic tests demonstrate that, whereas both single-phase oxides do not show appreciable activity, the composite systems are able to degrade methyl orange aqueous solutions under simulated solar light, and even visible light, with an efficiency directly dependent on TiO2 overlayer thickness. This finding opens attractive perspectives for eventual applications in wastewater treatment.
1 Introduction
Thanks to their ability to excite electrons to the conduction band, simultaneously generating holes in the valence band, metal oxide semiconductor nanomaterials can be used to drive different photocatalytic processes,1 such as degradation of organic pollutants, decontamination/disinfection processes, and production of solar fuels like hydrogen.2–12 In this regard, TiO2 (titania), a commonly used n-type semiconducting photocatalyst, has received widespread attention due to its relatively high efficiency, easy accessibility, low cost and chemical stability.7,13–17 Nevertheless, a major drawback of TiO2 is its wide band-gap (EG ≈ 3.2 eV),10,18–20 which can be activated only by UV photons, accounting for only ≈5% of solar spectrum energy.6,8,21–26 As a consequence, significant efforts have been devoted to the search for potential photocatalytic substitutes, based either on alternative systems or on modified titania, especially for the eventual use of solar radiation.5,20,27,28 In this regard, a proficient way to extend TiO2 absorption into the visible (vis) range concerns the fabrication of nanocomposite semiconductors,10,23,25,29 such as Fe2O3–TiO2. As a matter of fact, α-Fe2O3 (hematite; n-type), the most stable phase of iron(III) oxide under ambient conditions,26,30,31 enables efficient sunlight harvesting (EG ≈ 2.2 eV).30,32–34 Nevertheless, it tends to have short carrier diffusion lengths and facility to recombine electron–hole pairs, being thus ineffective in driving photocatalytic reactions.8,11,19,25,35,36 Interestingly, a tailored design of Fe2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites and control of the resulting n–n heterojunctions allows one to synergistically exploit the favorable properties of single-phase components, while minimizing the single oxide disadvantages. In particular, the development of Fe2O3–TiO2 nanostructures offers, in principle, a possible solution for the production of photocatalysts with improved charge transport properties and functional performances,2,20,36 even upon solar/vis illumination.4,37 So far, both iron-doped TiO29,17,18,20,23,38 and mixed Fe–Ti oxides2,7,10,16,24,36 have been used in a variety of photocatalytic degradation processes not only in the liquid phase,2,7,16,18,19,22,28,38 but also in the gas phase.6,19,39 All these studies have been devoted to powdered Fe2O3–TiO2 photocatalysts prepared through various routes. In a different way, interesting perspectives for property tailoring are, in principle, offered by supported oxide nanosystems, which have a lower tendency to sinter and/or deactivate upon operation5 and enable to avoid of inconvenient filtration processes for catalyst recovery,15,21 paving the way to on-site technological utilization.40 Nonetheless, few reports have so far been devoted to Fe–Ti–O photocatalysts prepared in the form of thin films/supported nanocomposites,5,6,21,35 and only some of the works on Fe2O3–TiO2 materials have involved the irradiation with vis/room light to trigger the target processes.7,9,15,20,21,24 As a consequence, the development of supported Fe2O3–TiO2 photocatalysts activated by solar/vis radiation is of great practical significance for a variety of real-world applications.
Herein, we report on an efficient and original strategy for the production of supported Fe2O3–TiO2 photocatalysts. Starting from a previous study on the surface functionalization of nanostructured Fe2O3 polymorphs for light-assisted applications,41 the protocol used in this work is based on the initial growth of α-Fe2O3 nanostructures on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD), followed by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2 films, in order to produce titania overlayers with tailored thickness.
In this contribution, the structural, morphological, optical and chemical features of the obtained nanocomposites are investigated by a multi-technique approach, and critically discussed as a function of the adopted synthesis conditions. Beyond the study of the system's chemico-physical properties, this paper reports on the functional behavior in the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) solutions triggered by solar/vis irradiation. To date, only a few works have been devoted to the photodecomposition of this dye by Fe2O3–TiO2 materials.9,20,21
2 Experimental section
Material synthesis
Fe2O3 depositions were carried out by means of a two-electrode custom-built radio frequency (RF) PE-CVD apparatus (ν = 13.56 MHz)42 on FTO-coated glass substrates (Aldrich, 735167-1EA; resistivity ≈7 Ω per square; lateral dimensions = 2.0 cm × 1.0 cm; FTO thickness ≈ 600 nm), which were subjected to an established cleaning procedure prior to each deposition.43,44 Electronic grade argon and oxygen were used as plasma sources. The iron precursor Fe(hfa)2TMEDA (hfa = 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedionate; TMEDA = N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine), synthesized according to the literature,45 was placed in an external glass vaporizer heated at 65 °C by means of an oil bath, and transported towards the deposition zone by an Ar flow (rate = 60 sccm). Two further auxiliary gas-lines were used to introduce Ar and O2 gases (flow rates = 15 and 20 sccm, respectively) directly into the reaction chamber. To avoid undesired condensation phenomena, the gas lines connecting the precursor reservoir and the reaction chamber were heated at 140 °C by means of external tapes. For all depositions, the inter-electrode distance, deposition time and RF-power were fixed at 6 cm, 1 h and 10 W, respectively. Based on the preliminary optimization experiments, growth processes were performed at a substrate temperature of 300 °C and a total pressure of 1.0 mbar.
The as-prepared Fe2O3 nanodeposits were subsequently functionalized with TiO2 overlayers via ALD, using Ti(OiPr)4 (OiPr = iso-propoxy; purity = 99.999%; Sigma-Aldrich®) and MilliQ water as precursors. Depositions were carried out at 150 °C using a continuous flow Beneq TFS 200 system operating at a total pressure of ≈1.4 mbar, with an average feeding pressure of 2.6 mbar. Ti(OiPr)4 and H2O reservoirs were heated at 90 and 25 °C, respectively, and injected into the reaction chamber using an electronic grade N2 flow (rate = 150 sccm). Each ALD cycle was composed of the subsequent four steps: i) Ti(OiPr)4 pulse, 300 ms; ii) purge, 1 s; iii) H2O pulse, 500 ms; iv) purge, 500 ms. After a series of preliminary experiments aimed at tailoring the thickness of the outermost TiO2 layers, in the present work, ALD depositions were carried out for 340 or 1450 cycles. Correspondingly, the samples with the lower (L) and higher (H) TiO2 overlayer thickness are labelled as Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) and Fe2O3–TiO2 (H), respectively. After an initial screening of the operating conditions, the use of thicker titania overlayers has been intentionally discarded in order to prevent the obtainment of too compact systems with reduced active area, a feature that could detrimentally affect the ultimate functional performances.
For comparison purposes, pure Fe2O3 and pure TiO2 samples (obtained with 1450 ALD cycles) were also prepared and subjected to photocatalytic tests.
After preparation, Fe2O3–TiO2 materials were subjected to ex situ annealing in order to attain thermal stabilization before functional tests. Thermal treatments were carried out in air at atmospheric pressure at 650 °C for 1 h, using a Carbolite HST 12/200 tubular furnace (heating rate = 20 °C min−1). After annealing, the samples were slowly cooled down to room temperature.
Chemico-physical characterization
The deposit mass was measured by using a Mettler Toledo XS105DU Microbalance. The mean weight of the active Fe2O3–TiO2 deposit was evaluated to be 0.20 ± 0.02 mg.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded at a fixed incidence angle of 1.0° with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Göbel mirror, using a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.54056 Å) powered at 40 kV and 40 mA.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were performed using an NT-MDT SPM Solver P47H-PRO instrument operating in tapping mode and in air. After plane fitting, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values were obtained from the height profile of 3 × 3 μm2 images according to the following relation: RMS roughness = [∑(zi − Z)2/n]1/2(1)where zi, Z and n represent the local height, the mean height and the number of data points, respectively.46
Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analyses were performed by means of a Zeiss SUPRA 40 VP apparatus equipped with an Oxford INCA x-sight X-ray detector for energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) investigation, operating at primary beam acceleration voltages between 10.0 and 20.0 kV.
Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) investigation was carried out on an IMS 4f mass spectrometer (Cameca®), with a Cs+ primary beam (voltage = 14.5 keV; current = 25 nA; stability = 0.2%) and negative secondary ion detection. An electron gun was used for charge compensation. Beam blanking mode and high mass resolution configuration were adopted. Signals were recorded by raster scanning over a 150 × 150 μm2 area and detecting secondary ions from a sub-region close to 10 × 10 μm2 in order to avoid crater effects.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and EDXS X-ray mapping experiments were carried out on a FEI Tecnai Osiris microscope, operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Super-X high solid angle energy-dispersive X-ray detector, as well as on a FEI Titan “cubed” microscope (acceleration voltage = 200 kV), equipped with an aberration corrector for the probe-forming lens and a Super-X high solid angle EDXS detector.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were run on a Perkin Elmer Φ 5600ci spectrometer, using a non-monochromatized AlKα excitation source (hν = 1486.6 eV), at working pressures lower than 10−8 mbar. Binding energy (BE) correction was performed by assigning to the adventitious C 1s signal a value of 284.8 eV. The analysis involved Shirley-type background subtraction and, whenever necessary, spectral decomposition by fitting with Gaussian–Lorentzian functions.47 Atomic percentages (at%) were calculated by peak integration using standard PHI V5.4A sensitivity factors.
The optical absorption spectra were collected in transmission mode at normal incidence by means of a Cary 50 spectrophotometer, using bare FTO glass as a reference. In all cases, the substrate contribution was subtracted.
The material's photocatalytic activity was tested in the degradation of MO aqueous solutions using a 20 mL Teflon photochemical reactor. In a typical experiment, FTO-supported Fe2O3–TiO2 catalysts were immersed in the dye solution (initial concentration = 7.6 × 10−6 M), which was preliminarily stirred in the dark for 30 min in order to reach the adsorption equilibrium. Correspondingly, the maximum decrease in the dye concentration was lower than 1% for all the investigated samples. Subsequently, irradiation was performed using a Solar Simulator (LOT-Oriel) equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp, filtered with an Atmospheric Edge filter to reduce the fraction of UV photons. The light intensity for simulated solar light experiments, estimated by radiometry, was 180 mW × cm−2. For experiments under sole vis irradiation, a 420 nm cut-off filter was used (AM-79765). At different time intervals, 2 mL of the aqueous suspension was withdrawn and analysed by a UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2450), to investigate the decomposition process. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by monitoring the relative intensity variation of the λ = 464 nm band as a function of time.20,21 The residual dye content (degradation efficiency) was calculated as A/A0 × 100,7,33 where A and A0 denote the absorbance values for the sample and control solutions, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
Material characterization
The system structure and phase composition were preliminarily investigated by XRD analyses. Irrespective of the synthesis conditions, the recorded patterns (Fig. S1, ESI†) evidenced the Bragg reflections of the rhombohedral hematite phase.48 For that with higher titania thickness, even some signals related to anatase TiO2 (ref. 49) were detected. No peaks from Fe–Ti–O mixed phases were observed, ruling out the formation of iron titanates in appreciable amounts and pointing out the co-presence of Fe2O3 and TiO2 in the developed materials.
The system morphology was preliminarily analyzed by AFM, which displayed a uniform topography with relatively rough surfaces (Fig. S2, ESI†). The images recorded on different sample areas enabled us to ascertain the surface homogeneity. The RMS roughness was estimated to be ≈15 nm for all the analyzed systems, irrespective of the adopted processing conditions.
The FE-SEM micrographs evidenced the presence of well interconnected globular aggregates (Fig. 1). In particular, cross-sectional micrographs revealed the formation of a double-layer structure, with the TiO2 overlayer uniformly covering the surface of the underlying Fe2O3 systems. A comparison of Fig. 1b and e showed that, upon increasing the ALD cycle number (see also Experimental section, 2), the TiO2 layer thickness increased from (25 ± 5) to (80 ± 10) nm. Concomitantly, the intimate contact between Fe2O3 and TiO2 was maintained. This observation was further supported by the analysis of the EDXS profiles (Fig. 1c and f). Besides TiO2 accumulation in the outermost nanodeposit layers, particularly pronounced for that with higher titania thickness, the analyses revealed the occurrence of Ti dispersion throughout the underlying Fe2O3 deposit. This phenomenon was further confirmed by in-depth compositional analyses carried out by SIMS (Fig. S3, ESI†). The specimens presented a homogeneous lateral composition, with no significant carbon contamination, and evidenced a more pronounced Ti enrichment for the specimen with the higher titania loading, along with an appreciable Fe2O3–TiO2 intermixing in both cases. This phenomenon, resulting from the synergy between the inherent porosity of Fe2O3 deposits and the typical conformal coverage enabled by ALD,41 points to a uniform coverage of Fe2O3 nanostructures by TiO2 even in the inner specimen regions, allowing thus a fine control over the resulting n–n oxide heterojunction. These features contributed to the improved Fe2O3–TiO2 photocatalytic behaviour with respect to that of bare Fe2O3 and TiO2, as discussed in detail below.

EDXS scans were performed along the lines marked in the cross-sectional views. Arrows indicate the direction of abscissa increase. 
Important information on the system nanostructure was provided by TEM analyses (Fig. 2). In particular, high resolution (HR)-TEM, HAADF-STEM and EDXS techniques were used to further characterize the target materials. Fig. 2a and b display the cross-sectional overview bright field (BF)-TEM images of samples Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) and (H), respectively. Fig. 2c and d combine the cross-sectional HAADF-STEM images of the specimens with the EDXS elemental maps for Ti, Fe, Sn and Si. Taken together, BF-TEM, HAADF-STEM and EDXS mapping data clearly demonstrated the glass/FTO/α-Fe2O3/TiO2 stacking of both samples. The Fe2O3/TiO2 interface is imaged in more detail for Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) in Fig. 2e. The Fourier transform (FT) pattern taken from the top layer confirmed the anatase crystal structure of the titania layer. Finally, a HAADF-STEM image of sample Fe2O3–TiO2 (H) is presented in Fig. 2f. The mass-thickness sensitive nature of the image highlights the porosity of the anatase top layer. The dark-contrast pores have an average diameter between 5 and 10 nm.

(f) HAADF-STEM image of the Fe2O3–TiO2 interface in sample Fe2O3–TiO2 (H). The dark-contrast structures in the anatase layer are voids. 
A deeper insight into the system's chemical composition and the element's oxidation state was attained by XPS surface analyses. The obtained data evidenced the presence of titanium and oxygen, whereas iron signals were detected only for that with lower TiO2 thickness, i.e. sample Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) (Fig. 3). In this case, the Ti surface molar fraction [XTi = Tiat% /(Tiat% + Feat%)] was evaluated to be 0.73, whereas in Fe2O3–TiO2 (H), no iron could be detected, in line with the conformal coverage of the underlying hematite by a thicker TiO2 layer.

The BEs of Fe2p3/2 (711.3 eV) and Ti2p3/2 (458.6 eV) photopeaks, along with their shapes, were in good agreement with the presence of Ti(IV)2,8,9,22,24 and Fe(III) oxides,5,21,25,26,34 free from other metal oxidation states. In line with the XRD results, this finding confirmed the co-presence of Fe2O3 and TiO2 maintaining their chemical identities. The O 1s signal (Fig. 3c) could be deconvoluted by means of two distinct contributing bands, related to lattice oxygen (I, BE = 529.9 eV) and surface adsorbed –OH species arising from atmospheric exposure (II, BE = 531.7 eV).5,22,30–32

Fig. 3d reports the optical absorption spectra of Fe2O3 and Fe2O3–TiO2 (H), evidencing the contribution of TiO2 overlayer at high photon energies (i.e., lower wavelengths). In particular, despite the fact that at wavelengths >550 nm the spectra were nearly indistinguishable, for lower wavelengths (<550 nm) an appreciable absorption increase took place. Taking into account that TiO2 optical absorption occurs only in the UV region (λ < 400 nm), the increased absorbance even in the vis range could be related to the formation of a Fe2O3–TiO2 n–n heterojunction, resulting in: a) a modification of the material's electronic structure; and b) an enhancement of charge carrier separation, yielding a non-negligible photocatalytic activity even upon vis light irradiation7,20 (see also below).
Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic activity of the target specimens was tested by MO decomposition as a function of illumination time. It is worth noting that the dye was not decomposed under irradiation only, thus confirming that its degradation was due to a photocatalytic process involving the target nanosystems. In this regard, representative results are proposed in Fig. 4. In particular, Fig. 4a reports the selected optical absorption spectra of a MO solution in the presence of Fe2O3–TiO2 (H), showing a progressive decrease in dye absorption upon increasing the irradiation time. The absence of new bands appearing during the process suggested a concomitant MO mineralization, with no accumulation of intermediate products. Fig. 4b displays the relative MO concentration as a function of illumination time in the presence of Fe2O3–TiO2 systems, bare Fe2O3 and bare TiO2 samples. In line with previous reports,7 the use of iron(III) oxide alone did not lead to a significant dye degradation. In a similar way, bare TiO2, able to absorb only a small portion of UV photons present in the simulated solar spectrum, led to a negligible MO conversion. Conversely, the curves pertaining to Fe2O3–TiO2 systems revealed a well evident progressive decay in the relative dye concentration upon irradiation, indicating that the use of Fe2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites, rather than the single oxides, is indeed crucial to drive the target photocatalytic processes. In particular, the decomposition efficiency increased with TiO2 loading, according to the following order: Fe2O3 ≈ TiO2 < Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) < Fe2O3–TiO2 (H). As can be observed in Fig. 4b, the latter sample was active even upon using sole vis illumination, though with a lower efficiency.

(b) Photocatalytic degradation of MO in the presence of bare Fe2O3, bare TiO2 and Fe2O3–TiO2 specimens under simulated solar irradiation. For comparison, the activity of Fe2O3–TiO2 (H) is also reported under sole visible illumination (vis). Simplified sketch of the mechanism for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity in Fe2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites under (c) vis and (d) UV illumination (VB = valence band; CB = conduction band). 
The performances of the present composite systems can be traced back to a synergistic Fe2O3/TiO2 interaction, since pure Fe2O3 and TiO2 presented very low degradation efficiencies. Remarkably, the formation of a Fe2O3/TiO2 heterojunction results in an improved charge separation which in turn has a direct beneficial effect on MO photodegradation.20 Previous works have evidenced a notable enhancement in the efficiency of Fe2O3–TiO2 heterojunctions by a combination of theoretical and experimental studies.2 The photocatalytic performances measured under simulated solar light can be understood by analyzing both the effects of vis and UV photons. In particular, vis light irradiation can promote electrons from the VB of Fe2O3 into its CB (Fig. 4c), whereas this phenomenon cannot occur in TiO2 due to its wider bad-gap. Despite that a large fraction of photoelectrons at low-energy levels could rapidly recombine, some photogenerated electrons promoted at higher energy levels in the CB of Fe2O3 can be subsequently transferred to the TiO2 CB, resulting in an improved charge separation. In this way, holes accumulated in the Fe2O3 VB can oxidize adsorbed MO species, as well as generate reactive OH˙ radicals that can further contribute to the decomposition of MO in solution,19 as evidenced by the activity of Fe2O3–TiO2 (H) under vis irradiation. In addition, adsorbed oxygen can be reduced by photogenerated electrons present in the CB of TiO2, leading to O2˙ radicals, which can further promote MO degradation. In a different way, UV light can induce electron–hole pair formation in TiO2 (Fig. 4d). In this case, the main effect is believed to be the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 CB to Fe2O3 CB. Under solar light, which comprises both UV and vis radiation, the two processes can synergistically occur, producing an increased photoactivity with respect to the case of pure vis light, as demonstrated by the presently discussed photocatalytic data.
In line with previous literature reports for similar processes,26 MO photodecomposition followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to dye concentration. From the fit of experimental curves recorded upon solar irradiation with a single exponential decay, apparent reaction rate constants could be calculated, yielding 0.7 × 10−3 and 3.2 × 10−3 min−1 for Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) and Fe2O3–TiO2 (H), respectively, whereas pure Fe2O3 and TiO2 demonstrated a negligible activity, as already observed.
The present performances, in particular that of the most active Fe2O3–TiO2 (H), are apparently slightly lower than those previously reported for MO degradation under vis light promoted by powdered Fe2O3–TiO2 systems.2,17,20 Nevertheless, the preparation route proposed in the present work enables the fabrication of nanocomposites characterized by a minimal amount of Fe2O3–TiO2 photocatalyst (≈0.2 mg), much lower than the typical ones for homologous powdered materials. Considering these aspects, and normalizing the system activity for the photocatalyst amount, the present materials stand as possible alternatives with respect to the homologous powdered systems, in spite of the higher surface area of the latter. It is also worth noticing that supported nanosystems, like the present ones, are attractive candidates for practical use since they are immobilized on a solid substrate, and do not suffer from leaching/sintering problems usually encountered in powdered materials.
4 Conclusions
In summary, a two-step process to develop Fe2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites on FTO substrates was demonstrated. After the initial PE-CVD growth of α-Fe2O3 nanostructures, functionalization with TiO2 was performed by ALD, followed by annealing in air. A multi-technique material characterization revealed the formation of high purity Fe2O3–TiO2 systems, in which the thickness of the titania overlayer could be conveniently adjusted as a function of the ALD cycle number. The uniform and conformal coverage of Fe2O3 nanostructures by TiO2, resulting in an intimate contact between the two oxides, was responsible for the material functional behavior in the photodegradation of MO aqueous solutions. The obtained data revealed an appreciable material activity both upon solar and vis light irradiation, due to an improved charge carrier separation at the Fe2O3–TiO2 interface. To the best of our knowledge, the use of Fe2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites obtained by a hybrid PE-CVD/ALD approach in similar photocatalytic applications has no literature precedent to date.
Overall, the results reported in this work pave the way to the development of supported photocatalysts for real-world applications in wastewater treatment. In this regard, future efforts to improve the overall material performance will require the concomitant optimization of Fe2O3 morphology, to obtain nanosystems endowed with higher porosity, and the possible use of higher TiO2 loadings. Further interesting research developments will involve the use of activated carbon filters (ACF) as supports with large surface area, which are of great interest for environmental remediation.21 In addition, attention will be devoted to the use of the target materials as anodes in photoelectrochemical cells aimed at water splitting triggered by solar irradiation. In this regard, detailed studies on the developed systems by Mott–Schottky analyses will also be performed, in order to attain further insights into the heterojunction properties.

 	Fig. 1  Plane-view and cross-sectional FE-SEM micrographs, along with EDXS line-scans, of Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) (a, b, c) and Fe2O3–TiO2 (H) (d, e, f) specimens supported on FTO substrates. EDXS scans were performed along the lines marked in the cross-sectional views. Arrows indicate the direction of abscissa increase.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a, b) Overview BF-TEM micrographs of samples Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) and (H). (c, d) HAADF-STEM images and EDXS chemical maps of samples Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) and (H). Color codes: Ti, orange; Fe, green; Sn, blue; Si, red. (e) HR-TEM image of sample Fe2O3–TiO2 (L). The FT patterns from regions 1 and 2 evidence the presence of α-Fe2O3 and anatase. (f) HAADF-STEM image of the Fe2O3–TiO2 interface in sample Fe2O3–TiO2 (H). The dark-contrast structures in the anatase layer are voids.	 

 	Fig. 3  Surface Fe2p (a), Ti2p (b) and O1s (c) photoelectron peaks for the Fe2O3–TiO2 (L) sample. (d) Optical absorption spectra of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3–TiO2 (H) specimens.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) UV–vis absorption spectra of MO aqueous solutions (7.6 × 10−6 M) as a function of irradiation time in the presence of Fe2O3–TiO2 (H). (b) Photocatalytic degradation of MO in the presence of bare Fe2O3, bare TiO2 and Fe2O3–TiO2 specimens under simulated solar irradiation. For comparison, the activity of Fe2O3–TiO2 (H) is also reported under sole visible illumination (vis). Simplified sketch of the mechanism for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity in Fe2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites under (c) vis and (d) UV illumination (VB = valence band; CB = conduction band).
