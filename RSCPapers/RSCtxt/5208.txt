    , Accepted 22nd May 2017First published on 23rd May 2017AbstractThe microstructure of a semiconductor is strongly associated with the semiconductor liquid junction (SCLJ) electric field, which drives charge separation and transfer. Here, we have explored the water-saturated ammonia nitriding of a Ta2O5 precursor, a thermodynamically favorable reaction, to synthesize and tune the microstructure of a TaON material in a wide temperature range of 850–1050 °C. We found that, with increasing temperature, the microstructure evolved from porous particles with profiles of the parent precursor, to dispersed sintering particles with large sizes and smooth surfaces, due to grain growth. Furthermore, bulk charge separation and transfer was shown to be dependent on the temperature-controlled microstructure evolution. As a result, when coupled with a loading of Co(OH)x as a cocatalyst, the TaON particles grew at 1000 °C with high crystallinity, smooth surfaces and less grain boundaries, yielding a highest water splitting photocurrent of 2.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE in 1 M NaOH under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2). Therefore, we believe that owing to the temperature-sensitive microstructure evolution, water-saturated ammonia nitriding may be a potential avenue for synthesizing high-quality oxynitride photocatalysts for effectively separating and transporting charges.
1. Introduction
Solar driven hydrogen production from water splitting in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells is an attractive technology being pursued to address energy and environmental issues.1,2 The PEC water splitting cell is composed of two half reactions: the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the cathode.3 Due to the four-electron transfer and high overpotential required for water oxidation, slow OER kinetics is a major challenge limiting the large-scale application of PEC devices.4,5 Hence, substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of ideal photoanode materials. These materials must exhibit good photostability to prevent photocorrosion, narrow bandgaps for harvesting more energy from sunlight, appropriate band edge positions that straddle the redox potential of water and efficient separation, collection and transportation of charges for chemical processes.6–10
Among numerous candidate materials for photoanodes, oxynitrides containing typical metal cations with a d0 electron configuration, such as TaON,11 LaMgxTa1−xO1+3xN2−3x,12 LaTiO2N,13 BaTaO2N14 and SrTaO2N,15 have attracted considerable interest, because they possess ideal bandgaps for visible light absorption and band edge positions for overall water splitting. In particular, β-TaON, which is the most stable polymorph of TaON, has a bandgap of about 2.5 eV, corresponding to visible light with wavelengths of up to 500 nm, and valence and conduction band positions at ca. +2.2 and −0.3 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode) at a pH of 0, respectively, making it theoretically capable of sustaining complete water splitting.16 Both theoretical calculations and experimental evidence have found that β-TaON exhibits better photochemical stability than its corresponding nitride, Ta3N5.17 More importantly, the charge carrier effective masses in β-TaON have been theoretically estimated to be 0.27 m0 for holes and 0.21 m0 for electrons (m0 is the free electron mass).18 This implies that the β-TaON material has a high carrier mobility. Indeed, after modification with IrO2 as a water oxidation cocatalyst, the photocurrent onset potential on the β-TaON photoanode has been observed to be as low as about 0 V vs. RHE, demonstrating its excellent ability for charge separation and transfer.11 The advantageous onset potential means that the β-TaON is potentially an ideal material for the assembly of efficient unassisted p/n PEC cells with photocathodes. However, the recently obtained saturated photocurrent is still far from the theoretical maximum (∼6.5 mA cm−2).19,20
Typically, β-TaON is synthesized by treating the oxide precursor β-Ta2O5 with flowing dry ammonia gas. In this route, TaON forms via the reaction Ta2O5 + 2NH3 → 2TaON + 3H2O. Thermodynamic calculations have revealed that dry ammonia facilitates the phase transformation from Ta2O5 to Ta3N5 and wet ammonia is more beneficial for stabilizing TaON.21 However, all existing TaON photoanodes have been prepared under dry ammonia with a low flow rate (typically, 20 mL min−1) at moderate temperatures (800–850 °C).19,22 Therefore, the unsatisfactory saturated photocurrent on the reported TaON photoanodes may result from the thermodynamically unfavorable synthesis conditions that induce low crystallinity. Usually, increasing the nitridation temperature or flux treatment can effectively improve the crystallinity of oxynitrides.23 Unfortunately, under flowing dry ammonia, increasing the nitridation temperature often results in higher defect densities in TaON. Furthermore, the molten salts used in flux treatment induce insufficient nitridation due to the solvent screening effect. Increasing the NH3 flow rate to overcome the screening effect leads to the product going beyond TaON to become Ta3N5.24 This means that it is thermodynamically difficult to diminish defects by improving the crystallinity of TaON under flowing dry ammonia. Abe's group achieved a record photocurrent (about 3.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE) on TaON particles with low-density pores and smooth surfaces, prepared using the Ta2O5 precursor with small particle sizes (average 200 nm), to improve the crystal growth kinetics of TaON.11 We can conclude from Abe's study that the TaON particles with smooth surfaces are beneficial for achieving higher PEC performance. This inspired us to explore thermodynamically and kinetically favorable routes to prepare high-quality TaON crystals for enhanced solar conversion.
Here, we tried to grow TaON crystals by nitriding the Ta2O5 precursor with flowing water-saturated ammonia gas, in which the sufficient water vapour enabled the nitridation to proceed at high temperatures and inhibited the formation of Ta3N5. We found that the grain size and surface microstructure of TaON crystals are sensitive to the nitridation temperature. By varying the nitridation temperature from 850 to 1050 °C, high-quality TaON crystals with smooth surfaces and ideal grain sizes were obtained at 1000 °C, which exhibited a high water splitting photocurrent of 2.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and a maximum half-cell solar-to-hydrogen (HC-STH) conversion efficiency of 0.7% at 0.7 VRHE. The high PEC performance was attributed to the fact that the high-temperature nitridation under the water-saturated atmosphere simultaneously adjusts the SCLJ and the crystallization of TaON crystals, thus suppressing surface and bulk carrier recombination.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of TaON photoanodes
Different TaON particles were prepared via the nitridation of Ta2O5 particles (99.99%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) in a tube furnace with a fused silica tube (50 mm diameter) at 850, 900, 950, 1000 and 1050 °C for 15 h. During the nitridation process, H2O vapor was introduced into the oven via a water-saturated flow of NH3 gas (500 mL min−1) and the temperature of the mixed gas flow was kept in the range of 35–40 °C. Then, the as-prepared TaON particles were deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate via electrophoretic deposition.25,26 Briefly, 70 mg of TaON particles and 20 mg iodine were dispersed in 50 mL acetone solution by sonication for 30 min. Then, two parallel FTO electrodes were immersed in the solution at a 10 mm distance, and a 15 V bias was applied between them for 5 min using a potentiostat. The coated area was 1 cm × 1 cm. Next, the post-necking treatment of the as-deposited electrode was performed by dropping 10 mM of methanolic TaCl5 solution (50 μL) onto it, followed by drying in air at 150 °C for 3 min. After repeating this process five times, the electrodes were heated under NH3 flow (500 mL min−1) at 470 °C for 30 min. The deposition of Co(OH)x onto the TaON photoanode was carried out by immersing the TaON photoanode into a Co(OH)x colloidal solution for 1 h, followed by washing with distilled water and naturally drying in air at room temperature (referred to as Co(OH)x/TaON). The colloidal Co(OH)x solution was prepared by adding 1 M NaOH (30 μL) into an aqueous solution containing 0.01 M CoCl2 (5 mL). The thickness of all the prepared Co(OH)x/TaON films on FTO substrates was well controlled and was observed by SEM to be ∼8 μm. The usage of Co(OH)x/TaON powders was determined by weighting to be ∼0.63 mg.
2.2 Sample characterization
The crystal structure of TaON was characterized using X-ray diffraction (Ultima III, Rigaku Corp., Japan) with Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) at a scan rate of 10° min−1. The morphologies of the TaON particles and photoanodes were observed with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI, USA) and a TEM (JEOL JEM 2100F), respectively. The surface chemical composition was measured using a K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Inc.). The binding energies were calibrated with respect to the residual C (1s) peak at 284.6 eV. The bulk composition was determined using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The optical properties of the TaON samples were studied using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflection spectroscopy, performed on a UV-vis spectrometer (UV-2500 PC, Shimadzu Corp., Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere. The powder samples were measured in the region of 800 to 300 nm in reflection mode at room temperature. A standard BaSO4 white plate was used for the baseline correction. The spectra were converted from reflection to absorption mode using the Kubelka–Munk function. The pore size distributions and specific surface areas of the samples were measured using nitrogen adsorption experiments at 77 K on a surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics TriStar USA), and were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods, respectively. Room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained by using a picosecond Ti:Sapphire laser (Mira HP, from Coherent) as the excitation source. The PL spectra were collected vertically from the surface using a 50× microscope objective and were sent through a 0.5 m spectrometer to a CCD camera.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
PEC performance was tested in a typical three-electrode configuration, consisting of the TaON photoanode as the working electrode, Pt foil as the counter electrode and saturated Ag|AgCl as the reference electrode. NaOH (1 M, pH 13.6) aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. A commercial oriel 92251A-1000 sunlight simulator (calibrated to AM 1.5G spectra at 100 mW m−2 using a standard Newport 91150 silicon cell) was employed as the light source (back-side illumination unless otherwise noted). The masked-off irradiated area was 0.28 cm2 and the photocurrent densities were normalized to 1 cm2. The recorded potential vs. Ag/AgCl (EAg/AgCl) was converted against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V + 0.059 pH). The columniform electrochemical cell consisted of double glazing glass with a water cooling system in its interlayer. Photoelectrochemical tests were performed at 293 K with the temperature controlled by cycling with cooling water. All PEC measurements were performed on at least three samples.
The relative electrochemical surface area was measured from capacitance measurements obtained using cyclic voltammetry between 0.65 VRHE and 0.9 VRHE in a 1 M NaOH solution in the dark. The scan rate was changed from 25 to 300 mV s−1. Under these conditions, all currents can be attributed to capacitive charging in this potential window, because there were no redox features. The Mott–Schottky curves were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (2273, Princeton Applied Research, AMETEK) by performing a potential scan in the anodic direction under a frequency of 1 kHz and an AC amplitude of 15 mV in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH 13.6).
The IPCE was calculated using the equation IPCE = 1240 × (Jlight − Jdark)/(λ × Plight), where Jlight and Jdark are the measured photocurrent and dark current densities (mA cm−2), respectively. λ is the wavelength of the incident light (nm) and Plight is the light intensity at the specific measurement wavelength (W m−2). The reaction was carried out under irradiation using a 500 W Xe lamp equipped with bandpass filters to provide monochromatic irradiation. The incident light intensity was measured using a photometer (Newport, 840-C, USA). The Faraday efficiency was tested in an airtight Ar flow system using online micro-gas chromatography (Agilent, 490 Micro GC). Before measurement, the system was purged with Ar for 30 min to remove the residual air. The oxygen and hydrogen evolution rates were analyzed during PEC water splitting with a time interval of 30 min. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the samples were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (Solartron 1260 + 1287) with a 10 mV amplitude perturbation and frequencies between 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz.
For sulfite oxidation, 0.1 M Na2SO3 was added to the NaOH aqueous solution (pH 13.6). The electron–hole separation yield (Øsep) was calculated from the current–potential curves under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight illumination using the equation JPEC = Jabs × Øsep × Øinj, where JPEC is the measured photocurrent density from water oxidation and Øinj is the charge injection yield. Jabs is the theoretical photocurrent of 6.5 mA cm−2, assuming complete absorption and 100% utilization of band gap photons of TaON. As sulfite oxidation proceeds with extremely fast oxidation kinetics, surface recombination is negligible and Øinj is close to 1. Therefore, Øsep is obtained by dividing JPEC by Jabs.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Temperature-dependent microstructure evolution
The TaON powders prepared by nitriding Ta2O5 under water-saturated NH3 flow (500 mL min−1) at 850, 900, 950, 1000 and 1050 °C for 15 h are referred to as TaON-850, TaON-900, TaON-950, TaON-1000 and TaON-1050, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1a) indicate that all these as-prepared samples are monoclinic β-TaON in the space group P21/c (14), and possess lattice parameters of a = 4.9581, b = 5.0267, c = 5.1752 Å and α = 90°, β = 99.64°, γ = 90° (JCPDS card no. 70-1193). This means that single-phase β-TaON was successfully obtained via the nitridation of Ta2O5 at various temperatures using water-saturated NH3. The time-dependent phase transformation study indicates that single-phase TaON formed after heating Ta2O5 at 1000 °C for 8 h, confirming the fast reaction kinetics of TaON crystal growth under water-saturated NH3 (Fig. S2, ESI†). The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (Fig. 1b) show that these as-prepared orange-yellow TaON samples (Fig. S1, ESI†) exhibit a similar main absorption band at 505–510 nm (2.43–2.45 eV) with a tail absorption of up to about 540 nm. The visible light response of TaON is attributable to electron transitions from the hybridized orbitals of N 2p with O 2p to empty Ta 5d orbitals.11 All the as-prepared samples exhibit a similar surface O/N ratio of about 1.9:1, as obtained from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†), and a comparable bulk O/N ratio of about 1.3:1 obtained from the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Table S1, ESI†). This indicates that an oxygen-rich layer formed on the surface of TaON. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the 0.5–3 nm thick oxygen-rich layer did not reveal the presence of a crystal lattice (Fig. S4, ESI†). This implies that the oxygen-rich layer is amorphous, probably originating from the oxidation of TaON by water under the water-saturated NH3 flow during cooling. The bulk O/N ratio of about 1.3:1 is slightly higher than the ideal O/N ratio in TaON, probably resulting from water oxidation under the water-saturated ammonia atmosphere. Recent experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations on TaON polymorphs have confirmed that the O/N ratio in β-TaON is tunable in a relatively wide composition region, indicating that oxygen-rich TaON is thermodynamically stable.27–29

The crystallinity of these as-prepared TaON samples was estimated based on the XRD data, by calculating the average primary grain size using the Scherrer equation D = Kλ/(βcosθ), where K is a dimensionless shape factor with a typical value of about 0.9, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), and θ is the Bragg angle. As shown in Fig. 1c, the primary grain size of TaON evidently increases with an increase in the nitridation temperature, implying that the microstructure of TaON strongly depends on the heating temperature. The temperature-dependent microstructure evolution was visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM. Obviously, the apparent particle size and shape of the Ta2O5 precursor (average 500 nm) are maintained after the phase transformation to TaON at heating temperatures below 900 °C (Fig. 2a–c). This suggests that the nitriding reaction-driven solid-state phase transformation from Ta2O5 to TaON is pseudomorphic and topotactic.30,31 In addition, it is clear that pores form in TaON particles prepared below 900 °C. This is because cell volume shrinkage occurred during pseudomorphic and topotactic phase transformation from orthorhombic Ta2O5 (unit cell volume 970.9 Å3) to monoclinic β-TaON (unit cell volume 127.4 Å3) by the exchange of 3O2− with 2N3−. The average pore diameter calculated from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method is 27.5 nm for TaON-850 and 35.4 nm for TaON-900. The BET measurements (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†) indicate that the specific surface area calculated from the linear part of the BET plot in the range of P/P0 = 0.05–0.15 is increased from 1.7 m2 g−1 for Ta2O5 to 5.7 m2 g−1 for TaON-850 and 5.9 m2 g−1 for TaON-900, due to the formation of a porous structure. The increased pore size of TaON-900 compared with that of TaON-850 implies that reconstruction of pores occurred due to the grain growth at higher temperature, as confirmed by Scherrer equation calculations. At 950 °C (Fig. 2d), the profile of the parent Ta2O5 has disappeared. The TaON product exhibits a smooth surface without obvious pores and decreased apparent particle size (average 300 nm). This means that the TaON particles formed at high temperatures do not inherit the profile of the parent Ta2O5. The decreased apparent particle size results from the partial decomposition of the parent particles during phase transformation, due to the increased intergranular stress from fast grain growth at elevated temperature. An obvious increase in apparent particle size was also observed at higher temperatures, such as for TaON-1000 and TaON-1050 (average 400 nm) (Fig. 2e and f), due to temperature-promoted particle sintering.32,33 Correspondingly, the BET specific surface area decreased from 5.6 m2 g−1 for TaON-950 to 4.7 m2 g−1 for TaON-1000 and 4.1 m2 g−1 for TaON-1050. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) measurements indicate that all the as-prepared TaON samples are single crystal (insets in Fig. 2). Furthermore, the SAED patterns gradually tend to present the diffraction pattern of a single crystal particle with increasing heating temperature, further confirming the grain growth and reduction of grain boundaries.

3.2 Effects of microstructure on PEC performance
To obtain the film photoanodes, the as-prepared TaON particles were deposited onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive substrates using an electrophoretic deposition technique.25,26 After post-necking treatment with TaCl5 and heating under NH3 flow, the as-prepared TaON photoanodes were evaluated for PEC water splitting. To achieve an accurate comparison, the thicknesses of all the deposited TaON films were controlled to be about 8 μm (Fig. S7, ESI†). Photocurrent–potential (J–V) measurements were performed in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH 13.6) under back-side illumination (from FTO) using AM 1.5G simulated sunlight irradiation (Fig. 3). Clearly, the photocurrents for all the TaON photoanodes prepared below 1000 °C, except for TaON-900, increased with increasing nitridation temperatures. The TaON-1000 photoanode exhibited the highest photocurrent density of up to about 1.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which was approximately 2.5 times greater than that for the TaON-850 (0.63 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE). Compared to the TaON-1000 photoanode, a slight photocurrent decrease was observed for the TaON-1050 photoanode. Among the photoanodes studied in this work, the TaON-900 photoanode exhibited the lowest PEC performance, with a photocurrent of 0.34 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. According to the above-mentioned results from the XRD, XPS and UV-vis absorption spectra, all the TaON materials obtained at different temperatures exhibited similar light absorption abilities and O/N ratios. Therefore, the differences in PEC performance may originate from the microstructure evolution, which is strongly related to charge separation and transfer.
 Fig. 3  Current–potential curves generated from front-side illumination (red) and back-side illumination (black) for (a) TaON-850, (b) TaON-900, (c) TaON-950, (d) TaON-1000 and (e) TaON-1050 photoanodes, measured in 1 M NaOH solution (pH = 13.6) under chopped AM 1.5G sunlight irradiation (scan rate: 30 mV s−1). (f) The charge separation efficiencies for the TaON photoanodes measured in 0.1 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight irradiation. 
The effects of microstructures on the PEC performance were explored by comparing the photocurrent generation under front-side irradiation (Jfront, semiconductor side) and back-side irradiation (Jback, FTO side) (Fig. 3). During front-side illumination, the electrons generated at the SCLJ travel through semiconductor layer to the FTO substrate and photogenerated holes are directly injected into the electrolyte, and vice versa for back-side illumination. Generally, Jfront/Jback < 1 and Jfront/Jback > 1 indicate a poor electron transport and poor hole transport, respectively.34,35 Obviously, for the TaON photoanodes composed of porous particles (TaON-850 and TaON-900), both the front- and back-side PEC did not follow the same J–V trend, exhibiting an evident increase in cathodic current under front-side illumination at low applied potentials. There is an obvious difference in charge transport: photogenerated electrons travel through the light penetration depth and the whole semiconductor layer to the FTO substrate under back- and front-side illumination, respectively. Therefore, the significant dependence of cathodic current on light irradiation direction indicates that the occurrence of the cathodic current is related to the behavior of the photogenerated electrons. Under front-side illumination, the separation and transport of electrons generated at SCLJ are sensitive to the microstructure of the semiconductor.36,37 Considering that the band bending across the semiconductor depletion region depends on the depletion width (W), we estimated the effective W of these as-prepared TaON photoanodes by using the equation , where ε is the dielectric constant (34 for TaON),38,39ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), Vox is the redox potential of water oxidation (1.23 VRHE), Vfb is the flat band potential of TaON (−0.03 VRHE determined by Mott–Schottky measurements), q is the electron charge (1.6 × 10−19), and ND is the donor concentration (3.26 − 6.28 × 1025 m−3 for these as-prepared TaON samples determined by Mott–Schottky measurements). For TaON-850, TaON-900, TaON-950, TaON-1000 and TaON-1050, the calculated W values are 8.69 nm, 7.99 nm, 9.99 nm, 11.59 nm and 12.06 nm, respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†), exhibiting a positive increase associated with crystal growth and flattening of the surfaces. For porous TaON, although the porous structure comprising small particles with good electrolyte permeability is beneficial for enlarging the SCLJ interface. However, due to the thin pore wall of about 20–50 nm, an obvious drawback is that the porous structure leads to a limited depletion region that induces weak band bending to extract electrons away from the SCLJ, thus increasing electron reduction and recombination at the SCLJ interface (Fig. 4a). Indeed, an enhanced cathodic current was observed when O2 was bubbled into the electrolyte. By bubbling N2 instead of O2, the cathodic current was suppressed (Fig. S9, ESI†). This further confirmed that in the porous structure, the directional electron extraction is unsatisfactory due to the weak driving force from weak band bending.
 Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of semiconductor liquid junction (SCLJ) interface, grain boundaries and charge transfer under front- and back-side irradiation for photoanodes composed of (a) TaON particles with porous structures (TaON-850 and TaON-900) and (b) TaON particles with smooth surfaces (TaON-950, TaON-1000 and TaON-1050). The white curves represent the grain boundaries and the white pore regions show the porous structure. 
In addition, all photoanodes, except for the facile electrolyte-permeable porous TaON-850 and TaON-900, exhibited a negligible cathodic current under back-side illumination. By increasing the synthesis temperature of TaON, the cathodic current gradually decreased and disappeared for TaON-1000. This implies that O2 reduction by photogenerated electrons was effectively avoided, probably resulting from the fact that the electrons were quickly transferred to FTO. As confirmed by SEM and the Scherrer equation, grain growth induces the formation of particles with sizes of 300–400 nm with smooth surfaces at temperatures above 900 °C. As shown in Fig. 4b, the larger particles with smooth surfaces exhibit larger SCLJ band bending to separate charge efficiently and electron diffusion is largely perpendicular to the SCLJ, thus suppressing the back reaction. Therefore, the suppressed O2 reduction can be attributed to increased band bending from the thickening of pore walls for TaON-900 and the formation of larger particles for the TaON samples obtained above 900 °C. In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. S10, ESI†) of all the TaON samples clearly show a wide PL peak from 600 to 800 nm centered at 700 nm, which corresponds to the recombination process from surface defects such as oxygen-related defects.40 All the samples prepared in our study exhibited nearly the same PL behavior, which may imply that the PL process is strongly associated with the surface O-rich layer, where the photogenerated charges recombine. The lack of obvious differences in surface recombination leads us to believe that the PEC performance of the TaON samples is dependent on their microstructure, which affects the SCLJ.
In addition to the SCLJ, the amorphous regions or grain boundaries which act as trap states also affect the charge transfer, and they must be filled with photogenerated carriers before a pronounced photocurrent response is observed. High-resolution TEM observations show that the thickness of the amorphous surface oxygen-rich layer decreased from 5 to 0.3 nm as the heating temperature increased from 850 to 1050 °C, due to larger particles having a more stable surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a sensitive tool to detect charge transfer at different interfaces. Nyquist plots of EIS are shown in ESI Fig. S11† and are fitted to the equivalent circuit model. A semicircle presents in the high frequency region (about from 10 kHz to 500 Hz) of the Nyquist plots, which can be assigned to the grain boundary resistance (RGB) and grain boundary capacitance (CGB) between TaON particles. The grain boundary resistance tends to decrease with the thinning of the amorphous layer, indicating that the amorphous layer is strongly related to the charge transfer. In addition, as the temperature increased, the decrease in the amount of grain boundaries contributed to the decrease in grain boundary carrier scattering. Noting that, an irregular grain boundary resistance increase was observed in TaON-900. Obviously, during the phase transformation from Ta2O5 to TaON, 900 °C is a critical temperature for keeping the apparent profile of parent Ta2O5. This means that a strong grain boundary stress formed at this temperature due to the increased grain growth rate, which would significantly increase the grain boundary carrier scattering. Above 900 °C, the grain boundary stress was released due to grain growth inducing the collapse of the apparent structure, thus decreasing the grain boundary carrier scattering.
To further check the bulk recombination losses, the charge separation efficiency (Øsep) was calculated by using the equation JNa2SO3/Jabs, where Jabs is the photocurrent density when completely converting the absorbed photons into current, and JNa2SO3 is the photocurrent density in the presence of Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger to completely suppress surface recombination without affecting the charge separation within the space charge layer of the electrode. Fig. 3f shows plots of Øsep determined in this way for all the studied TaON photoanodes during PEC water oxidation at various applied potentials. The obtained Øsep value increases gradually from ∼0.4 to 1.1 over this potential range, confirming that Na2SO3 can suppress surface recombination losses. The Øsep values are in good agreement with the PEC activity order of the TaON photoanodes, that is, TaON-900 < TaON-850 < TaON-1050 < TaON-950 < TaON-1000. The strong relation between Øsep and PEC activity further verifies the conclusion above that the bulk recombination losses are strongly dependent on the microstructure adjusting the SCLJ and the amount and state of the grain boundaries. It is interesting to understand the decrease in the PEC activity of TaON-1050. The TaON-1050 sample exhibited the lowest Øsep in the potential range of 0.4–0.6 VRHE, indicative of enhanced bulk recombination losses. This probably originates from the fact that there is an optimum synthetic condition involving a trade-off between particle size and crystal defects. In our case of using water-saturated ammonia, N-related defects may form at high temperature due to the strong oxidation ability of water. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was determined based on electrocapacitive measurements (Fig. S12, ESI†).41 Compared to TaON-1000, a 38% decrease in ECSA was observed for TaON-1050, indicating that the quality of the TaON crystal is temperature-dependent and 1000 °C seems to be an optimal synthetic temperature.
3.3 Co(OH)x modification for improving the IPCEs
Modifying the electrode surface with an appropriate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is an efficient route for improving the separation and injection of charge carriers and lowering OER overpotentials. Cobalt-based oxide, hydroxide and oxyhydroxide have been previously developed as oxygen-evolution electrocatalysts, due to their low cost and high performance. In previous reports,13,26 it has been well demonstrated that the modification of Ta-based nitrides with Co(OH)x is more efficient towards achieving a material for facilitating the PEC reaction. Here, to check the effectiveness of Co(OH)x for modifying Ta-based oxynitrides, Co(OH)x was loaded onto the TaON-1000 photoanode by using impregnation processing. As shown in Fig. S13, ESI,† the SEM image shows that the morphology of TaON-1000 is not substantially altered by the impregnation deposition method, with respect to Fig. 2e. The surfaces of the TaON-1000 particles are slightly more obscure, which is ascribed to the coverage of Co(OH)x. Indeed, the element mapping of cobalt reveals uniform Co(OH)x coverage on the surface of the TaON-1000 electrode. A TEM image (Fig. S13c, ESI†) shows that amorphous floccules were dispersed on the surface of TaON-1000. The Co 2p3/2 binding energy was measured at 780.8 eV and a Co 2p1/2–Co 2p3/2 splitting of 15.7 eV was obtained, confirming that the Co-containing coating on TaON is mainly in the form of Co(OH)2 (Fig. S13d, ESI†).42 As recorded in Fig. 5a, when modified with a Co(OH)x co-catalyst, the TaON-1000 sample gains a photocurrent of 2.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE in 1 M NaOH, which is approximately 1.5 times greater than bare TaON-1000 (1.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE), surpassing those of most previously reported TaON photoanodes determined using the same estimation method.20
 Fig. 5  (a) Current–potential curves over the TaON-1000 and TaON-1000/Co(OH)x photoanodes measured in 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH 13.6) under back-side Illumination of chopped AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. (b) IPCE dependence on the wavelength for the TaON-1000/Co(OH)x photoanode under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight at various applied potentials (1 M NaOH solution, pH 13.6). (c) HC-STH conversion efficiencies for the TaON-1000/Co(OH)x photoanode at different applied potentials. 
To study whether the water oxidation photocurrent is driven by light absorption of TaON, IPCE measurements were performed using monochromated light at various applied potentials (Fig. 5b). The onset wavelengths for the photocurrents agreed well with the light absorption edge of TaON. The IPCEs in the whole wavelength range increased significantly as the applied potential was increased from 0.6 to 1.23 VRHE. The IPCEs at 0.6 and 1.23 VRHE were ca. 2–13% and 15–30% at 500–350 nm, respectively. To verify the photocurrent value at 1.23 VRHE, the solar photocurrent was also calculated by integrating IPCEs with the standard solar spectrum following Grätzel's method.43 The integrated photocurrent was 2.15 mA cm−2 (Fig. S14, ESI†), confirming that the employed light source precisely simulated the AM 1.5G solar emission in the absorption wavelength range of the TaON electrode, and the IPCE values and photocurrent under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight are credible. The Faradaic efficiencies for the TaON-1000/Co(OH)x photoanode for H2 and O2 evolution at 0.7 VRHE were 94% and 87%, respectively, confirming that the photocurrent mainly originated from water splitting (Fig. S15a, ESI†).
The applied-bias-compensated half-cell solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (HC-STH) can be calculated using the equation η = [(1.23 − Vapp) × (Jlight − Jdark)/Plight] × 100%, where Vapp is the applied potential, Jdark and Jlight are the photocurrent density in the dark and under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight, respectively. Plight is the power density of AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2). The HC-STH of the TaON-1000/Co(OH)x photoanode was plotted as a function of applied potential, as shown in Fig. 5c. The maximum HC-STH conversion efficiency was calculated based on the photocurrent shown in Fig. 5a to be 0.7%. Furthermore, the maximum applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) in a two-electrode system (a TaON-1000/Co(OH)x working electrode and a Pt counter electrode) reached 0.62% (Fig. S16, ESI†), further demonstrating the excellent conductivity of the TaON-1000/Co(OH)x electrode. To assess the stability of the TaON-1000/Co(OH)x photoanode, chronoamperometry measurements were performed at 0.7 VRHE (Fig. S15b, ESI†). During 2 h of light irradiation, the photocurrent on the TaON-1000/Co(OH)x photoanode decreased gradually from the initial ∼1.3 mA cm−2 to ∼0.4 mA cm−2. XPS analysis of the TaON-1000/Co(OH)x electrode before and after photoirradiation for 2 h suggests that the N/Ta atomic ratio decreased significantly from 0.78 to 0.32 (Fig. S17, ESI†), indicating that the photocurrent of the TaON-1000/Co(OH)x photoanode decreased gradually with prolonged irradiation time, most likely due to the self-oxidation of surface N3− species by photogenerated holes. This evidence indicates that the hole extraction from the valence band of TaON by Co(OH)x is not as efficient as expected. There is a room to further improve the hole extraction efficiency by optimizing the loading of cocatalysts for achieving highly stable water splitting by TaON. Indeed, Abe et al. have recently suggested that the stability could be significantly improved by preloading homogeneously dispersed CoOx nanoparticles on a TaON surface to suppress self-oxidative deactivation.11
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated that water-saturated ammonia nitriding can be used to synthesize TaON materials in a wide temperature range of 850–1050 °C. This synthetic route is beneficial for obtaining high-quality TaON crystals with smooth surfaces and ideal grain sizes, which greatly contribute to a decrease in bulk recombination losses. The TaON photoanode obtained at 1000 °C exhibited a high water splitting photocurrent of 2.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and a HC-STH conversion efficiency of 0.7% at 0.7 VRHE when modified with a Co(OH)x co-catalyst. The high-quality TaON crystals produced via a thermodynamically favorable synthetic route allow room for further improving the photocurrent and photostability, as the co-catalyst can be optimized to accelerate water oxidation and the surface amorphous layer of TaON can be removed to reduce surface resistance. We believe that water-saturated ammonia nitriding may be extended to the synthesis of other robust oxynitride photocatalysts for efficient PEC water splitting.
