Due to the difficulties in experimentally investigating the transition kinetics, numerical simulation was performed. Surprising results were uncovered that the unstable α phase could be maintained in ambient conditions under compression, caused by the reduced Gibbs free energy of this phase. By analysing the transition rate, the detailed kinetic parameters have also been obtained, enabling us to construct a more complete phase map as a function of temperature and stress, offering a possible path towards stable high PCE perovskite solar devices, which opens an unprecedented avenue in perovskite solar cell research, and will hopefully be of intrinsic interest to the broad materials research community as well.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have attracted much attention due to their low cost and favourable light-absorbing properties, which enable their application in photovoltaics.1–3 Formamidinium lead iodide (CH5I3N2Pb or FAPbI3), in particular, shows the most promising power conversion efficiency (PCE).4–7 The PCE of perovskite solar cells based on this structure has been increased from 3.8% to 25.7% within a short period of time, opening a refreshing gate for renewable energy development.8–11
However, the desired phase of FAPbI3 (α-FAPbI3) is not stable in the air at room temperature, and spontaneously transforms into a high bandgap phase (δ-FAPbI3) within several minutes,12,13 placing a severe hindrance on commercialization. Even worse, other factors aggravate this problem, such as water moisture14–16 and residue tensile strain in the perovskite films.12,17–19 Much effort has been devoted to resolving the moisture problem, including doping,20,21 encapsulation,22 and interface engineering.23,24 Among the trials, an important step forward was achieved recently, when a stable hydrate phase of FAPbI3 was discovered,14 providing an effective solution to this problem, which leaves residue tensile strain as the only challenge remaining. The residue tensile strain generated during the annealing process accelerates the breakdown of the cubic structure of α-FAPbI3, which is attributed to the oversized FA ions located in the cubic center.18 The residue tensile strain promotes the driving force of the phase transition, which is originated from the expansion trend of the FA ions.17
In the meantime, in prior efforts to resolve this challenge, people have tried to reduce the stress by strain engineering methods,5,12,17,25 where a smaller A site ion was employed in the ABX3 structure of the perovskite.12 It was believed that a cation exchange reaction would occur to replace the FA ions. Unfortunately, the resulting lifetime was only increased to 1000 hours, far from enough for practical applications. Others have tried to characterize the distribution of the residue strain,17 where GIXRD and TEM were employed to evaluate the strain energy, and led to an increase of PCE performance instead of the lifespan. They also tried to apply a compressive stress of up to 60 GPa to the film,18,26 which led to a transformation from a semiconductor to a metal, increasing the electrical conductivity to a great extent, but with little influence on the grain growth.27 Nevertheless, a small lifetime enhancement was observed due to the application of uniaxial compression, which induced tension in the perpendicular direction,18 as done by the opposite action, the tensile residue strain. All of this shows that it is at least difficult, if not impossible, to study the true effect of compressive stress on the α-FAPbI3 structure, calling for an alternative approach to uncover the hidden behaviour.
It is therefore the purpose of this study to reveal the influence of compressive stress on α-FAPbI3 by a numerical simulation method, to avoid the interference of the lattice imperfections involved in experimental studies. Mechanical parameters were introduced to describe the connection among the unit cells,28 which enabled us to uncover the kinetic process of the phase transition. It was found that the stability of α-FAPbI3 can be enhanced up to 15 times under compression, which is attributed to the reduced Gibbs free energy of the α phase. Surprisingly, the α structure may even be completely stabilized when the pressure reaches 16 GPa, much lower than that suggested by the previous experimental attempt of uniaxial stress of 60 GPa.18,26 In addition, kinetic parameters of the phase transition have also been obtained by analysing the transition rate of α to δ phases, which allows us to construct a more complete phase map of the α and δ phases, both as a function of temperature and applied stress. Ideally, the findings will be of immediate interest to the wide perovskite research community.
2. Modelling
This work aims to reveal the kinetic process of the phase transition, instead of the thermodynamics discussed previously. As the phase transition is a collective phenomenon, beyond the dynamic description of the motion of PbI6 octahedra and FA ions within a perovskite unit cell, mere consideration on the molecular scale has not been successful. In the meantime, mechanical influence is normally manifested above the mesoscopic length scale. Therefore, in trying to fill the gap between intra-cell kinetics and the stress-energy manifestation, inter-unit cell interactions, instead of intra-unit cell motion, has been articulated here. The mechanical strain energy of each unit cell has been designated to determine the transition of each site, which provides a more general and all-inclusive approach, to include the multiple component description of a strain tensor, as little lifetime enhancement was observed by the application of uniaxial compression, which induces tension in the perpendicular direction. The simulation only needs to be executed in two dimensions, as the mechanical behaviours of the second and third lateral dimensions are usually identical. Thus, a two-dimensional lattice was employed throughout the simulation. The lattice size of the perovskite simulation has been conveniently chosen because various sample sizes have been investigated by the previous experimental works,29,30 where the results were found to be similar.
During the modelling, a unit cell in the perovskite is represented by a site in a lattice, and a kinetic time step by one iteration of all the sites. To unravel the influence of the transformed unit cells on the surroundings, the phase transition has to be considered for each cell, so that the influence of transformed sites on the surroundings can be examined. As shown in Scheme 1, the elements of I and Pb were shared by several neighbouring unit cells or sites, which will be affected by their surroundings, leading to the altered energy state for the unit cells. It is thus necessary to analyse the phase transition individually site by site, rather than the entire lattice as a whole. Compressive and tensile strains are modelled here, which are represented by Sm. A hydrostatic compressive force was introduced during the simulation to avoid the generation of tensile stress under uniaxial compression, which can be achieved experimentally by diamond anvil cell (DAC) apparatus.
 Scheme 1  Modelling process of the perovskite unit cell. 
The stress is thus introduced first by assigning an Sm value to each site. This can be manually altered to simulate the various levels of stress that have been introduced to the perovskite film. To facilitate the modelling, the stress has been expressed by the corresponding elastic energies, via Energy = (1/2) × Stress × Strain × (unit cell Volume), when 0.2 eV is equivalent to 16 GPa compressive stress, under a maximum strain of the perovskite structure of about 1.5%.31 The level of Sm must also be tuned artificially to uncover the critical compressive stress, above which the α phase can be stabilized. For example, the Sm value can be varied from −0.03 eV to −0.2 eV during the modelling. The negative sign indicates that it is against the transition. To eliminate the possible tension in the perpendicular direction, as found in the previous experimental attempt,18 compressive stress has been assumed, which is supposed to maximize the influence on the stability of the α phase.
For comparison, a positive Sm has also been employed to simulate the tensile stress, when it was randomly chosen between 0 and 0.1 eV, based on the information of the literature.17,26 When the phase transition is completed in one site, the corresponding Sm value will be set to zero, and left alone in the following time steps, as the resulting δ phase will be “detached” from the α unit cells, or α sites.19,32
In addition to the Sm, the variation of the hydrogen bonds needs to be considered during the phase transition, Thus, a binding energy (Bd) is introduced for each site or unit cell, which equals the total hydrogen bonding energy of −0.15 eV.33 The negative sign indicates again that it is opposing the phase transition. As the Pb and I elements are shared by several neighbouring unit cells, the Bd value of the surrounding sites will also be changed after a unit cell is transformed to the δ phase, which will relocate the Pb and I elements, reducing the number of hydrogen bonds in the surrounding unit cells. It is thus necessary to update the Bd value after each time step, or iteration. The Bd value of a transformed site will be reduced to zero, while that of the connected sites has to be re-calculated as the average of the total binding energy of these sites, similar to the calculation of the nearest neighbouring lattice points in a crystal.34 For example, in a 2D square lattice, the total number of connected unit cells is four (up, down, left, right). Thus, the Bd value of the untransformed site (x,y) can be given by:  
The values of Sm and Bd affect the Gibbs free energy of the α phase, and are effectively modifying the Ea (originally 0.7 eV35,36) to become Ea–Sm–Bd , to be compared to the triggering (Tr), which originated from the large FA ions, to decide if the transition happens. Ea represents the activation energy without stress, while  represents the activation energy when compressive/tensile stress is applied. Tr is the triggering energy of the phase transition originating from the large FA ions. The values of 0.7 eV was adopted following the literature35,36
To reduce the complexity and CPU time, a 2D lattice of 100 × 100 sites was constructed, as the 3 energies need to be assigned initially and then updated by the above analysis. Next, the value of Tr in each unit cell will be compared with  to determine whether the unit cell will undergo the phase transition. In the subsequent steps, the Bd and Sm will be readjusted according to the discussion above, followed again by the comparison of Tr with , which will be repeated 1000 times. The α phase is represented by the green dots and the δ phase by red dots. The number of green dots is also recorded after each iteration, which is related to the conversion rate of the phase transition, allowing for further thermodynamics and kinetics calculation.
3. Results and discussion
Following the simulation scheme, after the initial assignments of the 3 energies, the iteration proceeds by updating the Bd and Sm values, allowing us to model the kinetic process of the possible phase change. The influence of compressive stress on the stability of the α phase has been numerically modelled by a 2D lattice, and some surprising observations were made, all originating from the change of the thermodynamic state as described in the following diagrams.
With the green dots representing the α phase, the red dots the δ phase, and the iteration number the transition time, the results are best illustrated by the time evolution of the phase transition, as has been depicted by the snapshots of the whole lattice (Fig. 1), where three scenarios were compared, including tensile stress (1a), compressive stress (1b), and no stress (1c). Clearly, the compressive stress exhibits a great enhancement in the stability of the α phase. Under compression, over 9800 out of the total 10000 green dots remained after the first iteration, constituting a distinct difference from the mere 1315 under tension. In addition, around 30% of the α phase never converted to the δ phase under compressive stress. This result is explainable by the Newtonian Mechanics, where the external compressive stress counterbalances the internal expansion from oversized FA ions, which in turn alters the Gibbs free energy and activation energy, as shown in Fig. 1(d), during which the activation energy of the whole lattice in those 3 conditions was calculated based on the number of green dots by . Therefore, it is evident that the compressive stress is beneficial to the stability of the desired α phase, which has now been demonstrated by the modelling here. More importantly, it has also been reported that the compressive stress will reduce the bandgap and enhance the carrier conductivity,26 which is beneficial to the performance of PSC devices.

After the first iteration, the number of green dots is 1315; meanwhile, it is 83 after the second iteration, and 0 after the third iteration. (b) The simulation results of 1, 2, 100, and 1000 iterations after 0.03–0.2 eV compressive energy was applied. After the first iteration, the number of green dots is 9878; meanwhile, it is 9056 after the second iteration, and stabilized at 3001 after the 30th iteration. (c) The simulation results of 1, 2, 100, and 1000 iterations when no stress was applied. After the first iteration, the number of green dots is 5094; meanwhile, it is 1348 after the second iteration, and 0 after the third iteration. (d) The activation energy of α to δ phase transition under various strain energies, calculated by the transformation rate after the first iteration, which equals .35 The calculated activation energy under no stress was close to the literature value of 0.7 eV.14,35 
Although the α phase remains stable at temperatures above 160 °C,32,37 the temperature around 85 °C is more critical for the operation of solar cells,38 as the temperature of PSC devices would gradually increase to such a value during the operation. Therefore, the possible phase transition was modelled. The activation energy needs to be adjusted, using the equation given in the literature,35,39–41Ea = Ea0 + a1(T − T0) + a2(T − T0)2, which is equivalent to adding 0.02 eV to  in this case. As presented in Fig. 2(a)–(c), the external stress showed a similar effect on the stability of the α phase. The phase transition completed at the 4th iteration when tensile stress was applied, extending the lifetime by 30% compared to that at room temperature. Such a result proved the beneficial effect of temperature on the perovskite stability, as has been predicted by the phase map of FAPbI3.14 The iteration number needed for the completion of the phase transition under compression was also increased from 30 to 34. Therefore, the structural “lifetime” can be increased at 85 °C by the lowered Gibbs free energy of the α phase, as shown in Fig. 2(d), which will hopefully be of help to the experimental design.

Red dot = δ phase, green dot = α phase, and iteration number represents the transition time. After the first iteration, the number of green dots is 2538; meanwhile, it is 558 after the second iteration, and 0 after the 4th iteration.

(c) The simulation results of 1, 2, 100, and 1000 iterations when no stress was applied at 85 °C. After the first iteration, the number of green dots is 7001; meanwhile, it is 3302 after the second iteration, and 0 after the 4th iteration. (d) Schematic illustration of the altered kinetics states at 85 °C. 
To trace the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, we recorded the number of green dots, to represent the remaining α phase, from 1 to 100 iterations. After the curve fitting by Origin™, an exponentially decaying expression was obtained. There are 4 fitting parameters shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c), which are related to the thermodynamics and kinetics, as indicated in Fig. 3(d). The constant “a” symbolizes the initial transition rate of the α phase, which is determined by the combination of Sm, Bd, and Tr values. The larger “a” is, the more stable the α phase. As shown in Fig. 3(a), constant “a” equals 2976 under compression at room temperature, demonstrating a great initial stability. The constant “b” shows the level of residue stress, and is positive for compression, and negative for tension. When there is no stress applied, the “b” value becomes 0. The variable X represents the iteration number, which is the “lifetime” of the α phase. It will be reduced under compression, indicating a longer transition time. The constant “c” is a direct indication of the activation energy. A large “c” value will block the formation of the δ phase, extending the lifetime of the α phase. These parameters demonstrated the stability of the desirable α phase and revealed the activation energy of the phase transition under various stresses, leading to a new solution to stabilize the perovskite structure. Due to the favourable “a”, “b”, and “c” values under compression, the lifetime of the α phase can be enhanced up to 15 times. More importantly, around 30% of α remains stable in the air at room temperature under compression, indicating an altered Gibbs free energy for this structure. The simulated results can actually be confirmed by previous experimental observations,42,43 where the lifetime of the device was enhanced in moisture by more than 4 times when compressive stress was applied.
 Fig. 3  (a) The recorded green dots (α phase) as a function of iteration number. When compressive stress is applied, the number of green dots stabilized at 3001 after the 30th iteration, providing a novel scheme to keep the desired α phase at room temperature. (b) The recorded green dots (α phase) as a function of iteration number. When tensile stress is applied, the number of green dots is reduced to 0 after the second iteration. (c) The recorded green dots (α phase) as a function of iteration number. When no stress is applied, the number of green dots is reduced to 0 after the second iteration. (d) The physical significance of the constants “a”, “b”, and “c”. 
It is evident that compression is favourable for the stability of the α phase due to the reduced Gibbs free energy, which can be extended in the following to stabilize the α phase completely at room temperature. Thus, the value of the compressive stress was gradually increased from −0.03 up to −0.2 eV. It is shown in Fig. 4(a) that the Gibbs free energy of the α phase (Gα) will keep decreasing with a higher Sm value. Thus, the critical value of −0.2 eV (or 16 GPa) was found; at this point all green points remained, indicating no transition. The curve fitting showed an exponential increase in the reduction of the Gibbs free energy of the α phase. Summarizing all the findings, the phase map of FAPbI3, as a function of both temperature and applied stress, can be constructed, as shown in Fig. 4(b). It is now possible to obtain the stable α phase at room temperature following the prediction of the diagram.

The critical boundary was achieved at 0.2 eV, at which the Gibbs free energy of the α phase was reduced below that of the δ phase. The Gibbs free energy change was calculated by the method found in the literature.14,35 (b) The phase map of FAPbI3 as a function of temperature and applied stress.

4. Summary
In conclusion, we simulated the effect of compressive stress on the structural stability of α-FAPbI3, which demonstrated a reduced Gibbs free energy in such cases, resulting in the lifetime enhancement of the α phase by up to 15 times when the external compressive stress reached 2.4 GPa (−0.03 eV). When the stress increases, a critical value of 16 GPa (−0.2 eV) was found, above which the transition can be eliminated. Our discoveries could be verified experimentally by, e.g., the diamond anvil cell (DAC) apparatus, as has been previously accomplished.44 Such a method is able to introduce residue hydrostatic compressive stress in the perovskite film, effectively suppressing the transition of the α to δ phase. In addition, the bandgap of semiconductors can be reduced by pressure,45 which will alter the electronic properties, resulting in higher carrier concentrations, leading to a better PCE performance. All this enabled us to construct a more complete phase map of the temperature and applied stress, providing possible strategies for the research community to improve perovskite materials.

 	Fig. 1  (a) The simulation results of 1, 2, 100, and 1000 iterations after 0–0.1 eV tensile energy was applied. Red = δ phase, green = α phase, and iteration number represents the transition time. After the first iteration, the number of green dots is 1315; meanwhile, it is 83 after the second iteration, and 0 after the third iteration. (b) The simulation results of 1, 2, 100, and 1000 iterations after 0.03–0.2 eV compressive energy was applied. After the first iteration, the number of green dots is 9878; meanwhile, it is 9056 after the second iteration, and stabilized at 3001 after the 30th iteration. (c) The simulation results of 1, 2, 100, and 1000 iterations when no stress was applied. After the first iteration, the number of green dots is 5094; meanwhile, it is 1348 after the second iteration, and 0 after the third iteration. (d) The activation energy of α to δ phase transition under various strain energies, calculated by the transformation rate after the first iteration, which equals .35 The calculated activation energy under no stress was close to the literature value of 0.7 eV.14,35

The critical boundary was achieved at 0.2 eV, at which the Gibbs free energy of the α phase was reduced below that of the δ phase. The Gibbs free energy change was calculated by the method found in the literature.14,35 (b) The phase map of FAPbI3 as a function of temperature and applied stress. The α phase can be maintained at high temperature or under compression.
