    , Accepted 23rd January 2019First published on 6th February 2019AbstractNickel cobalt sulfide is widely applied to energy storage and electrocatalysis owing to its high electrical conductivity and multiple oxidation states. This study proposes NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 core–shell structures as energy storage materials and electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. A higher specific capacity of 2.22 mA h cm−2 (168.18 mA h g−1) at 10 mA cm−2 is obtained for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 electrode which is applied as the battery-type electrode in the battery supercapacitor hybrid, but a better electrocatalytic activity is achieved for the NiCo2S4 electrode with a smaller overpotential of 1.567 VRHE at 0.12 A cm−2 and a smaller Tafel slope of 86.1 mV dec−1. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is larger for NiCo2S4 due to the nanoparticle-assembled nanotube wall, whereas NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 shows higher electrical conductivity owing to the presence of molybdenum. Different performances in energy storage and electrocatalysis for NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 nanomaterials are caused by different potentials applied for driving the electrochemical reactions. This study for the first time proves that the trade-off between ECSA and electrical conductivity is important for designing nanomaterials applied in different electrochemical fields.
1. Introduction
Developing multi-functional materials is attractive for application in numerous electrochemical devices since the requirements for establishing efficient active materials are similar. By coupling the electrode with different active materials and the electrolyte with various components, diverse electrochemical devices with various functions could be assembled, such as sensors,1–3 batteries,4–6 supercapacitors,7–9 solar cells,10–12 photocatalytic degradation13,14 and photoelectrochemical cells.15–17 The electrode material for electrochemical devices requires excellent properties of transferring electrons and facilitating chemical reactions. Hence, high electrical conductivity, low charge recombination possibility, large active surface area and an efficient charge-transfer path are intensively pursued for fabricating highly effective electrode materials. These requirements can be met by suitable material selection and rational morphology design.
Recently, cobaltites (with the chemical formula MCo2O4; M = Mn, Ni, Zn, Cu, Mg, etc.) have been reported as one of the fascinating materials applied to energy storage devices and electrocatalysis, due to their multiple oxidation states and capabilities of facilitating more electrochemical reactions.18,19 Among all these oxides, spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) is one of the most promising materials with electrical conductivity 2 times higher than those for nickel oxide and cobalt oxide.20,21 The existence of binary nickel and cobalt ions is expected to facilitate richer redox reactions than those facilitated by their single counterparts.22 Oxygen can be substituted by sulfur to further enhance the electrical conductivity of nickel cobaltite. Nickel cobalt sulfide has drawn much attention because of its much smaller optical band gap energy and much higher electrical conductivity compared to those of NiCo2O4. Nickel cobalt sulfide with high electrical conductivity and bimetallic nature for possessing abundant oxidation states has been intensively applied to electrochemical devices, such as the battery-type material for energy storage23,24 and the electrocatalyst for accelerating water splitting.25,26 Wang et al. reported nickel cobalt sulfide nanoparticles on graphene for energy storage.23 Zhang et al. deposited a nickel cobalt sulfide nanosheet array on graphene foam for energy storage.24 Jiang et al. synthesized NiCo2S4 double-shelled hollow spheres as the electrocatalyst for the HER.25 Irshad et al. prepared a nickel cobalt sulfide film as the electrocatalyst for the HER.26 To further improve the electrochemical performance of nickel cobalt sulfide, fabricating composites with other semiconductors is one of the effective strategies.27 Combining other semiconductors can not only facilitate higher electrical conductivity and extra redox reactions but also provide opportunities to design well-defined morphologies with an efficient charge-transfer path and large active surface area. Cheng et al. synthesized a NiCo2S4@NiCo2O4 nanocolumn array for energy storage.27 Beka et al. fabricated a NiCo2S4 nanotube/CoxNi(3−x)S2 nanosheet core–shell structure for energy storage.28 Recently non-noble metal electrocatalysts such as metal oxides,29,30 metal hydroxides,31,32 metal-nitrogen/carbon,33 metal carbide,34 metal sulfide35 and metal–organic complexes36 have been widely reported as alternatives for Pt-based electrocatalysts, because noble Pt is noble and not stable in the environment containing CO and CH3OH.37 The active sites of electrocatalysts are important for influencing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances.38 Liu et al. prepared quaternary (NiFe)PS3 nanosheets as ultra-effective OER catalysts. The (NiFe)PS3 nanosheets show an OER activity with an overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm−2. It was found that only unsaturated Fe and Ni atoms located on the (010) plane of (NiFe)PS3 are active for the OER.39 Huang et al. synthesized rapidly cationic defect and anion dual-regulated CoAl layered double hydroxides as OER catalysts. The synergistic effect of Al3+ vacancies and S2− regulation promotes the exposure of active Co sites, resulting in an amorphous and porous surface for improving the OER performance.40 Sun et al. loaded MoS2 electrocatalysts onto the Co3O4 nanosheet array to catalyze the HER with a low onset potential of 76 mV, which was attributed to the increased active sites and the electronic interactions between MoS2 and Co3O4.41
On the other hand, as for the morphology design, the one-dimensional structure is able to facilitate efficient charge transfer and enhance the electrochemical performance for active materials.42–44 Caverning the middle of nanorods to fabricate nanotubes is more effective to enhance the surface area for facilitating more electrochemical reactions.45–47 However, the nanotube structure was rarely fabricated as the active material for electrochemical devices, especially for the electrocatalysts toward water splitting. Except for the difficulty in synthesizing well-defined nanotube structures, the other probable reason may be the risk of active materials peeling off from the substrate when gases are generated from the middle of nanotubes during the water splitting process. Therefore, it is worth designing an efficient nanotube structure with good adhesion on the substrate and to investigate the feasibility of the nanotube structure as the electrode material for energy storage and water splitting applications.
In this study, a nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4) nanotube array was fabricated on Ni foam using a hydrothermal reaction and coupled with evenly grown nickel molybdenum oxide (NiMoO4) nanosheets on the outer surface of the nanotubes for fabricating a nanotube/nanosheet core–shell structure, for application in energy storage and electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution. It should be noted that the NiCo2S4 core was converted to nickel cobalt oxysulfide (NiCo2OxSy) after carrying out the hydrothermal synthesis for fabricating the NiMoO4 shell. Due to the well-defined nanotube/nanosheet core–shell structure as well as the suitable combination of NiCo2OxSy and NiMoO4, the battery-type electrode with the NiCo2OxSy/NiMoO4 shows a very high areal capacitance of 17.75 F cm−2 (1345 F g−1) corresponding to a capacity of 2.22 mA h cm−2 (168.18 mA h g−1) at 10 mA cm−2. The battery supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) with the NiCo2OxSy/NiMoO4 positive electrode also achieved a maximum energy density of 5.28 W h kg−1 at a power density of 329 W kg−1 and a CF retention of 100% after 2000 charging/discharging cycles. However, a better electrocatalytic activity was attained for the NiCo2S4 electrode, which presented a smaller overpotential of 1.553 V vs. RHE at a current density of 0.12 A cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 86.1 mV dec−1 for electrocatalysis toward oxygen evolution. The reaction time-dependent morphology and the electrochemically active area were also carefully investigated in this work to fully understand the growth and the design of these promising NiCo2S4 nanotube and NiCo2OxSy/NiMoO4 core–shell structures.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
All the reagents used in the experiment were directly used without further purification. Nickel foam (NF, 94 PPI) was purchased from Innovation Materials Co., Ltd, Taiwan. Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (C19H42BrN, CTAB, 99%), sodium molybdate(VI) dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O, 99%), and anhydrous sodium sulfide (Na2S, 90%) were bought from Acros. Nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 98%) and Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%) were obtained from Alfa. Urea (CH4N2O, 99%) was obtained from Showa. Potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85%) was purchased from Echo Chemical Co. Ltd.
2.2. Synthesis of a NiCo2S4 nanotube array on nickel foam (NiCo2S4 NTA/NF)
Prior to the synthesis, the Ni foam was cleaned by sonication in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water (DIW) in sequence for 2, 10, and 10 min. The pre-treated Ni foam was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C overnight. In a typical synthesis, 5 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2.5 mmol NiCl2·6H2O, 2 mmol CTAB, and 9 mmol urea were dissolved into 35 mL DIW to form a transparent pink solution. Then 15 mL of the above solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with two pieces of the pre-treated Ni foam immersed into the solution. The autoclave was sealed tightly, maintained at 120 °C for 6 h, and then cooled down by immersing it into tap water at room temperature for about 25 min. After the hydrothermal synthesis, the Ni foam loaded with the nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide nanowire array (Ni–Co LDH NWA/NF) was carefully rinsed with DIW and 95% ethanol in sequence several times. Prior to synthesizing NiCo2S4, the Ni–Co LDH NWA was first transformed to the NiCo2O4 NWA via calcining the Ni–Co LDH NWA in air at 400 °C for 3 h with a gradual heating pattern. Subsequently, the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF was obtained through a simple and facile hydrothermal synthesis based on the Kirkendall effect. Typically, two Ni foams loaded with the NiCo2O4 NWA were placed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a solution containing 15 mL of 0.1 M sodium sulfide, and the autoclave was sealed tightly and maintained at 120 °C for 6 h. After the hydrothermal synthesis, the Ni foam loaded with the NiCo2S4 NTA (NiCo2S4 NTA/NF) was carefully rinsed several times with DIW and 95% ethanol in sequence.
2.3. Synthesis of a nickel cobalt oxysulfide nanotube/nickel molybdenum oxide nanosheet array on nickel foam (NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF)
The NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF was prepared by a hydrothermal route, followed by a calcination process. The NiCo2S4 NTA/NF was put into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a 15 mL solution containing 0.21 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.21 mmol Na2MoO4·2H2O. The autoclave was sealed tightly and maintained at 100 °C for 4 h. After the hydrothermal synthesis, the as-obtained sample was carefully rinsed with DIW and 95% ethanol in sequence several times. The as-obtained sample was calcined at 400 °C for 2 h.
2.4. Assembly of the battery supercapacitor hybrid (BSH)
The BSH was fabricated by assembling the activated carbon negative electrode and the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF positive electrode. The activated carbon electrode was prepared as follows. A paste containing 10% binder (poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), Scientific Polymer Products, INC), 10% acetylene carbon black (CB, 99.9900%) and 80% charcoal activated carbon (Showa) was dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, 99%). The doctor-blade method was used to coat the as-prepared paste on the Ni foam to fabricate the activated carbon electrode. The electrolyte used for assembling the BSH is 2 M KOH solution. The electrode separator is filter paper soaked in the electrolyte for 30 min before being used. The charge of both electrodes for assembling the BSH should be carefully balanced by controlling the mass of the active materials in both electrodes. The mass should be balanced according to eqn (1). (1)where m is the mass of active materials, I is the discharge current for positive (+) and negative (−) electrodes, and t is the discharge time for positive (+) and negative (−) electrodes.
2.5. Materials and electrochemical characterization
The morphologies of Ni–Co LDH NWA/NF, NiCo2S4 NTA/NF, and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF are examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI, Oregon, USA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1230, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was used to examine the inner morphology of NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 nanostructures. The composition of metal oxides was analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). The composition and phase for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded in the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) at SP8 in the Japan 12B2 Taiwan beam line. The electron storage ring was operated at 8.0 GeV and a current of around 100 MA was used. The one-dimensional powder diffraction profile was obtained through GSAS II integrating a cake-type pattern program. The diffraction angles are calibrated using the Bragg positions of the CeO2 standard. The resistance of the sample was measured using a 4-point probe sheet resistivity measurement device (LRS4-TG, Keithlink Technology, Taiwan). The electrochemical performance of single electrodes was evaluated using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 204, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands) in a three-electrode system. The as-prepared electrodes, a Pt sheet and a Ag/AgCl electrode are applied as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential was calculated using eqn (2). E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.05916 × 14 + 0.199(2)
The electrocapacitive performance of the BSH was also measured using the same potentiostat/galvanostat. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 204, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands) equipped with an FRA2 module, in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at the open-circuit potential.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and composition characterization
The morphology of the nanomaterial is of the greatest importance for determining the energy storage and electrocatalytic capabilities. To synthesize a well-defined NiCo2S4 nanotube array on Ni foam, the nanomaterials formed during the whole synthesis process need to be carefully examined.
It was reported that during the two-step hydrothermal synthesis, the morphology of the NiCo2S4 array was almost determined by the Ni–Co LDH array,48 which is the first product formed in the synthesis process. Hence the morphology of the Ni–Co LDH grown on NF should be carefully designed at the first step. The Ni–Co LDH was synthesized by performing a hydrothermal process for 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours, and the corresponding SEM images are shown in Fig. S1(a)–(d) in the ESI,† respectively. For the Ni–Co LDH prepared by performing a hydrothermal process for 2 hours, a nanosheet structure was obtained with several nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface. When increasing the time of the hydrothermal synthesis to 3 hours, the Ni–Co LDH nanosheet structure started to dissolve and the edge of nanosheets became rugged. The dissolution kept proceeding with increasing hydrothermal synthesis time, and the Ni–Co LDH re-formed to be soft nanowires with a thin top and a wide bottom when the hydrothermal synthesis time reached 4 hours. A solid nanowire structure with a uniform diameter of around 150 nm was obtained for the Ni–Co LDH prepared by performing a hydrothermal process for 6 hours. The well-dispersed nanoparticles are found to have uniformly grown on the surface of the solid nanowires. This nanoparticle-coated nanowire array is expected to be very promising for application in the electrochemical device, since an efficient one-dimensional charge-transfer route can be achieved by the nanowire and larger active surface area can be attained by the nanoparticles on the surface. Therefore, the Ni–Co LDH NWA fabricated by performing a hydrothermal process for 6 hours was used as the basic structure for further growing the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF.
In a typical synthesis process, the Ni–Co LDH NWA/NF should be further calcined to form the NiCo2O4 NWA/NF, which would be transferred to the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF using another hydrothermal synthesis. However, the NiCo2S4 NWA/NF could also be obtained by the direct vulcanization of Ni–Co LDH NWA/NF, as reported in the previous literature.49 Hence, it is interesting to investigate the necessity of the calcination process for transforming the Ni–Co LDH NWA/NF to the NiCo2O4 NWA/NF prior to carrying out vulcanization for synthesizing the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF. Fig. S2(a) and (b) in the ESI† respectively show the low-magnification and high-magnification SEM images for the NiCo2S4/NF synthesized by direct vulcanization of the Ni–Co LDH NWA/NF. This means that there is no NiCo2O4 NWA formed in the whole synthesis process. To fairly discuss the necessity of the calcination process for synthesizing the NiCo2O4 NWA/NF, the NiCo2S4/NF fabricated by the vulcanization of the NiCo2O4 NWA/NF is shown in Fig. 1(a) for comparison. The NiCo2S4/NF synthesized without the calcination process (Fig. S2(a)†) presents a hexagonal nanotube structure with a very smooth surface. However, the NiCo2S4/NF synthesized with the calcination process for forming NiCo2O4 NWA/NF as the intermediate shows a nanoparticle-assembled wall for the nanotube array. The nanoparticle-assembled wall is inferred to have larger active surface area for facilitating more redox reactions with the electrolyte. Therefore, the calcination process is thus considered to be necessary for fabricating efficient electrochemical materials.

The NiMoO4 nanosheet shell was further grown on the NiCo2S4 NTA core by using hydrothermal synthesis and the post-calcination process to fabricate NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF. The top-view and the side-view SEM images of NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF are respectively shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c). The NiCo2S4 shows the pure nanotube structure with a diameter of around 150 nm, and several well-dispersed nanoparticles were grown on the surface. A similar diameter was obtained for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4, which presents a sheet-on-tube structure with the growth direction vertical to the substrate. To more clearly analyze the structure of NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4, the TEM images of NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 are shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e), respectively. The TEM image of NiCo2S4 clearly shows a nanotube structure with an inner diameter of around 60 nm and an outer diameter of around 150 nm. It is surprisingly found that the well-dispersed nanoparticles on the surface of nanotubes observed from the SEM image (Fig. 1(a)) is not the accurate description for the morphology of NiCo2S4. Instead, the nanoparticles were assembled to construct the wall of nanotubes instead of growing on the surface of nanotubes. On the other hand, the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 presents large nanosheets grown on the nanotube. The outer diameter of the nanotube core is around 60 nm, while the width of the nanosheet shell is around 50 nm. By adding the diameter of the core and the two-fold width of the shell, the outer diameter for the NiCo2S4@NiMoO4 is around 160 nm. The diameters of about 150 and 60 nm were respectively obtained for the pure NiCo2S4 nanotube and the nanotube core of the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4. It is surprising to find that the diameters of the nanotube core for the pure NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 are quite different. Moreover, the inner diameter for the pure NiCo2S4 nanotube and the core diameter of NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 are quite similar, as indicated using red dotted lines in the figures. It is inferred that NiMoO4 is not simply grown on the NiCo2S4 core in the hydrothermal synthesis. Instead, the nanoparticle-assembled wall of the NiCo2S4 nanotube is probably dissolved during the hydrothermal synthesis. A simple growth process is to merely deposit the NiMoO4 nanosheets on the surface of the core. However, a more complex growth process was proposed that the NiMoO4 nanosheets could be grown from the middle of the NiCo2S4 nanotube using the dissolved NiCo2S4 nanoparticles along with the Ni and Mo precursors to form the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 core–shell structure. This possible growth process is preferable for the strong adhesion between the core and the shell. The core–shell structure with excellent connection between the core and the shell is promising as the electrochemical material, which could survive repeated ion intercalation and deintercalation and even in the gas generation process.
The composition of the nanostructures was further examined using XRD patterns. Fig. 2(a)–(d) show the XRD patterns for Ni–Co LDH NWA/NF, NiCo2O4 NWA/NF, NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF, respectively. The strong peaks at the 2θ values of 44.3° and 51.6° in all the XRD patterns are indexed to the Ni foam substrate. The XRD pattern for the Ni–Co LDH NWA/NF partially fits that of Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS 14-0117)50 and Co(OH)2 (JCPDS 02-0925),51 suggesting the double hydroxide nature. Only a few of the peaks are corresponding to the standard pattern for nickel cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate (Ni6.10Co2.90(OH)18.27(CO3)1.315·6.7H2O, JCPDS 33-0429).52 The XRD pattern for the NiCo2O4 NWA/NF shows nearly a perfect match to the standard pattern for NiCo2O4 (JCPDS 20-0781).53 Few of the peaks at the 2θ values of 43.2° and 62.8° suggest the formation of NiO (JCPDS 02-1216).54 The XRD patterns of NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4, NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4 all show the peaks for NiO (Fig. S3†). Hence, it is inferred that NiO was formed during the synthesis process. However, there is almost no contribution from NiO to the electrochemical performance of the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 and NiCo2S4 electrodes.55 Also, due to the use of the Ni foam substrate or the incomplete conversion from hydroxide to oxide, the signals for Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS 14-0117) were also observed in the XRD pattern for NiCo2O4. The NiCo2S4 NTA/NF presents a highly similar XRD pattern to NiCo2S4 (JCPDS 20-0782)56 with the 2θ values of 16.2°, 26.6°, 31.4°, 38.1°, 47.3°, 50.4°, 54.9° and 62.4°. Extra peaks corresponding to Co9S8 (JCPDS 86-2273)57 with the 2θ values of 15.2°, 17.6° and 44.6° were also obtained. Co9S8 is inferred to be obtained from the cobalt hydroxide, which is probably formed in the first step of the hydrothermal synthesis. However, the peaks indexed to NiCo2S4 cannot be observed in the XRD pattern for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF, probably owing to the overlapped shell which largely reduced the signal of the NiCo2S4 core or due to the core composition change in the last step of the hydrothermal synthesis. The peaks corresponding to the NiMoO4 pattern (JCPDS 12-0348)58 were found at the 2θ values of 17.4°, 20.3° and 45.8°. The relatively small intensity of the peaks for NiMoO4 may be due to the low concentration of the molybdenum precursor used in the last step of the hydrothermal synthesis. Interestingly, peaks corresponding to the pattern of CoMoO4 (JCPDS 25-1434)59 were observed at the 2θ values of 16.2°, 20.2°, 43.1°, 45.8° and 62.6°. The formation of CoMoO4 may be caused by the similar atomic radius of cobalt and nickel. The molybdenum ions could not only combine with the nickel ions released from the core but also form metal compounds with the cobalt ions in low coordination. There are still unclear peaks existing in the XRD pattern for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF. This suggests that there could be several compounds composed of nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, sulfide and oxide existing in the material of NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF in different ratios.

On the other hand, the XPS spectra of NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 were obtained to analyze the composition and the atomic valence states of nanostructures. Fig. S4(a)–(e)† show the full survey region, Ni 2p, Co 2p, O 1s and S 2p spectra for NiCo2S4, respectively. The Ni, Co, S and O elements were observed in the full survey region spectrum. The Ni 2p spectrum presents two spin–orbit doublets and two satellite peaks after the doublets, indicating the existence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ in the NiCo2S4 sample. Similarly, the Co 2p spectrum shows two spin–orbit doublets and two satellite peaks after the doublets, implying the presence of Co2+ and Co3+ in the NiCo2S4 sample. The S 2p spectrum shows one doublet and a satellite peak after the doublet. The 2p3/2 orbital corresponding to the metal–sulfur bond and the 2p1/2 orbital corresponding to the sulfide with low coordination were obtained in the doublet, suggesting the successful formation of metal sulfides such as nickel cobalt sulfide and slight cobalt sulfide. The O 2p spectrum also presents one doublet with one peak corresponding to the metal–oxygen bond at lower binding energy and the oxygen at the surface (O2−) at higher binding energy.60 Although the NiCo2S4 was obtained from the vulcanization of NiCo2O4, the conversion of oxide to sulfide is hard to complete. The metal-oxide binding suggests the incomplete conversion of oxide to sulfide. According to the results of the XRD patterns and the XPS spectra, it is indicated that the form of nickel cobalt sulfide is NiCo2S4. On the other hand, the survey region, Ni 2p, Co 2p, O 1s, S 2p, and Mo 3d spectra for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(f), respectively. The Ni, Co, Mo, S and O elements were observed in the survey region spectrum. Similar results to those for the NiCo2S4 sample were observed in the Ni 2p and Co 2p spectra, suggesting the formation of Ni2+, Ni3+, Co2+ and Co3+ in NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4. In addition, the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 orbitals in the Mo 3d spectrum were perfectly fitted, which indicates the existence of Mo6+ and the successful synthesis of molybdenum compounds.60 An interesting phenomenon was observed in the S 2p spectrum. Compared to the S 2p spectrum for NiCo2S4, the peak corresponding to the metal–sulfur bond is vanished and there is only one broad peak existing in the S 2p spectrum for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4. The broad peak can be fitted to two peaks located at 531.4 and 532.7 eV, respectively. These two peaks were corresponding to sulfate and sulfite.61,62 It is inferred that sulfide could be converted to sulfate or sulfite during the calcination process in air. Hence the composition of the core is inferred to be changed after the calcination process for synthesizing NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4. A similar result was also observed in the previous literature.63 The O 1s spectrum of NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 can be similarly fitted to two peaks located at 531.4 and 532.7 eV, respectively. The peak at 531.4 eV stems from the bond between oxygen and sulfur,61 while the peak at 532.7 eV corresponds to the bond between the metal and oxygen.64 The results suggest that the metal does not directly bind to sulfur but to oxygen. Hence the composition of the core in the core–shell structure is inferred to be NiCo2OxSy, as indicated above by using other analyses.

To more distinctly describe the process for synthesizing NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF, the whole synthesis process is illustrated in Scheme 1 , including the first step of fabricating the Ni–Co LDH NWA/NF using hydrothermal synthesis, the second step of making the NiCo2O4 NWA/NF using the calcination process, and the third step of forming the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF using hydrothermal synthesis.

3.2. Electrochemical analysis of NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF as the battery-type electrode for battery supercapacitor hybrids
First, NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF were applied in the energy storage device. The electrochemical performance of the battery-type electrode was analyzed using the CV and GC/D curves. Fig. 4(a) shows the CV curves for NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF. The CV curves for both electrodes show only one couple of redox peaks, which is attributed to the redox reactions of Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+.65 The redox peaks may overlap to form single reduction and oxidation peaks since the redox reactions of Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+ occur at similar potentials. On the other hand, it was well reported that the main function of molybdenum is to enhance the electrical conductivity of the nanomaterial.66,67 This statement can also be supposedly verified by observing the redox peaks in the CV curves for NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF. The redox peaks are located at similar potentials for NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF, even though the compositions for both electrodes are different; that is, the latter has one extra element of molybdenum. This phenomenon indicates the limited influence of molybdenum on the redox behavior and further suggests that the influence of molybdenum may lie on improving the electrical conductivity. Similar results were also observed in our previous work.68 Much higher redox currents and larger integral area were obtained for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF, suggesting its better energy storage ability. The CF value can be calculated using eqn (3).69 (3)where I is the current density in A cm−2,  is the integral area of the CV curve, ν is the scan rate in mV s−1, ΔV is the potential window in volts, and A is the active area of the electroactive material in cm2. A higher CF value of 15.78 F cm−2 (1195 F g−1) corresponding to a capacity of 3.07 mA h cm−2 (232.58 mA h g−1) was obtained for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF, compared to those for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF with a CF value of 8.35 F cm−2 (632.58 F g−1) corresponding to a capacity of 1.62 mA h cm−2 (122.73 mA h g−1). Furthermore, the GC/D curves were applied to examine the electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF, as shown in Fig. 4(b). A couple of plateaus were observed in the GC/D curves for both electrodes, suggesting the redox reactions of Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+.46 Similarly, the plateaus were located at similar potentials, indicating the limited influence of the extra molybdenum on the redox behavior of NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF. A longer discharging time was observed for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF, again suggesting its better energy storage ability. The CF value can be calculated based on eqn (4).70 (4)where I is the current density in A cm−2, Δt is the discharge time in seconds, A is the active area of the electroactive material in cm2, and ΔV is the potential window in volts. The CF values of 10.42 F cm−2 (789.4 F g−1) and 17.75 F cm−2 (1345 F g−1) corresponding to the capacities of 1.30 mA h cm−2 (98.49 mA h g−1) and 2.22 mA h cm−2 (168.18 mA h g−1) were respectively found for NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF. The CF value for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF is impressive compared to the values reported in the previous literature.71,72 The outstanding performance of the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF is probably owing to the following reasons. First, the three-dimensional Ni foam provides a preferable framework for the growth of nickel cobalt oxysulfide and nickel molybdenum oxide. Second, the hollow nanotube structure provides very large surface area for facilitating redox reactions with the electrolyte. Third, the direct growth of NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 on NF could eliminate the use of binders and also enhance the contact between the nanomaterial and the substrate.73 Most importantly, the presence of molybdenum could enhance the electrical conductivity and accelerate the electrochemical reactions.66,67

Next, the high-rate charge/discharge capacity of NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF was examined by measuring the CV curves at different scan rates, as shown in Fig. S5(a) and (b) in the ESI,† respectively. The peak separation in the CV curves increases with increasing scan rates applied for the measurement. This is a common electrochemical phenomenon caused by the internal resistance.74 It is worth mentioning that the CV curves for NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF measured at scan rates higher than 30 mV s−1 present horizontal lines in the high potential region, which is caused by the detection limit of the potentiostat device. This phenomenon indicates very high current and excellent electrochemical performance for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF. Also, all the CV plots show nearly no distortion at different scan rates, suggesting excellent high-rate charge/discharge capacity for both cases. In addition, the GC/D curves for NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF were measured at different current densities to examine the high-rate charge/discharge capacity, as shown in Fig. S5(c) and (d) in the ESI,† respectively. Obvious plateaus are observed in the GC/D curves at different current densities for both cases. The charge/discharge time in the GC/D curves decreases when higher current densities are applied for the measurement. This is a common electrochemical phenomenon caused by insufficient time for ion diffusion at high current densities.75 The CF values for NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF calculated using the GC/D curves at different current densities are shown in Table S1 in the ESI† for comparison. To more clearly examine the high-rate charge/discharge capacity, the relation between the areal capacitance and the current density for NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF is shown in Fig. 4(c). The CF retentions of 62.3% and 43.0% are respectively found for NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF when the current density applied for the measurement increases from 10 to 50 mA cm−2. This result suggests excellent high-rate charge/discharge capacity for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF owing to its preferable morphology and element composition. Compared with other studies, this result shows much higher specific capacitance and much better rate capability.76
To more carefully analyze the electrochemical properties of NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF, the EIS technique was applied to estimate the charge transfer resistance of the system. The Nyquist plots for the NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes are shown in Fig. 4(d), along with the equivalent circuit for fitting the resistance data. The shapes of the Nyquist curves are similar for both cases. The curve is composed of a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region. The slope of the straight line in the low frequency region is larger than 1, indicating a typical capacitive material property which can also be observed for other multiple metallic oxides.77 The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrodes can be estimated from the semicircle in the high frequency region. The Rct values of 0.38 and 0.24 Ω were respectively obtained for the NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes. The smaller Rct value for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode is primarily owing to the presence of molybdenum for enhancing the electrical conductivity of the electrode and accelerating the redox reactions in the system. In addition, the electrical conductivity for NiCo2S4 was evaluated by measuring the sheet resistance of the sample. A point probe sheet resistance measurement device was used to measure the resistance of the NiCo2S4/NF electrode. Two samples were measured four times each. The resistance is shown in Table S2† for reference.
To improve the applicability of the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode, the BSH was assembled using a commercial activated carbon electrode as the negative electrode and the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode as the positive electrode. Fig. 5(a) shows the CV curves for the negative and positive electrodes. The potential window for the activated carbon negative electrode ranges from −1.0 to −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, while the potential window for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF positive electrode is between −0.1 and 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Therefore, a potential window of 1.6 V was first tested for evaluating the suitable potential window for the BSH. Fig. 5(b) shows the CV curves for the BSH measured using the potential windows of 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 V. The current density increases in the high potential region when the potential window of 1.7 V was applied for measuring the CV curve. Hence, the potential window of 1.6 V was chosen for measurements of the BSH. In turn, the CV curves with the potential window of 1.6 V were measured using different scan rates, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The CV curves present similar shapes at different scan rates, and even at high scan rates of 40 and 50 mV s−1 there is no distortion observed, suggesting excellent high-rate capacity for the BSH. On the other hand, the GC/D curves were measured using the potential windows of 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 V, as shown in Fig. 5(d), while various current densities were also applied for measuring the GC/D curves with the potential window of 1.6 V, as shown in Fig. 5(e). A larger IR drop was obtained in the GC/D curves measured at higher current densities, owing to the insufficient time for uniform charge arrangement and to the incompletion of faradaic reactions. Other than the IR drops, the shape of the GC/D curves remained highly symmetric at different current densities, indicating the excellent high-rate charge/discharge capacity of this BSH. On the other hand, the energy and power densities are two of the most important indexes for evaluating the energy storage ability. The relation between the energy density and the power density was evaluated using the Ragone plot, as shown in Fig. 5(f). The energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated respectively based on eqn (5) and (6).78 (5) (6)where C is the specific capacitance, V is the potential window and t is the discharge time. It is found that the energy density can reach a maximum value of 5.28 W h kg−1 at a power density of 329 W kg−1, and even at a maximum power density of 2308 W kg−1 the energy density still remained at 1.21 W h kg−1. Last but not least, charge/discharge cycling stability is also important for an efficient energy storage device. To evaluate the cycling stability of the BSH, the GC/D curves were measured repeatedly at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 for 2000 cycles. The first and last four GC/D curves for the BSH in the 2000 cycle repeated charge/discharge process are shown in Fig. 5(g). It is found that the curves remained highly symmetric even at the last four cycles. The CF retention and the coulombic efficiency in relation to the cycle number are also shown in Fig. 5(h) to more clearly evaluate the cycling stability of the BSH. A CF retention of 100% was achieved for the BSH after 2000 repeated charge/discharge cycles, and a coulombic efficiency of higher than 90% was attained in the whole cycling process. These results suggest the excellent cycling stability for the BSH composed of the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF positive electrode.

Table 1 lists the preparation and electrochemical parameters for the NiCo2S4-based electrodes applied to the energy storage devices in comparison to the previous literature. It is found that not only is the synthesis method used in this work cheaper and more convenient than those applied in the previous literature but also the specific capacitance is the highest for the NiCo2OxSy electrode reported in this work compared to those achieved in the previous literature.

3.3. Electrochemical analysis of NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF in electrocatalysis
Second, the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF were applied in electrocatalysis toward the OER. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes were measured to evaluate their electrocatalytic activity toward the OER, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The LSV curves of NiCo2S4/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF were IR-corrected using the Rct value obtained in the EIS measurement carried out in 1 M KOH electrolyte. At potentials larger than 1.55 V vs. RHE, the current density for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode is higher than that for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode. Also, as observed in the figure, the overpotentials of 1.553 and 1.567 V vs. RHE were obtained at a current density of 0.12 A cm−2 (9.09 A g−1) for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes, respectively. It is found that the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode can present not only a higher current density but also smaller overpotential to achieve 0.12 A cm−2 (9.09 A g−1), compared to those for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode. The results suggest the better electrocatalytic activity of the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF. Moreover, the Tafel plots for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes were obtained from the LSV curves as shown in Fig. 6(b). The Tafel slopes of 86.1 and 99.7 mV dec−1 were obtained for NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes, respectively. The smaller Tafel slope for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode again indicates its better electrocatalytic activity toward the OER.

The result for the electrocatalytic application is opposite to that for the energy storage application. That is, the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode shows better electrocatalytic activity toward the OER than the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode, while a better energy storage capability was obtained for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode compared to that for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode. It is interesting to investigate the difference between the requirements for an efficient electrocatalyst and energy storage material. Hence, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was analysed. The ECSA was estimated by using the CV measurements in the potential region without faradaic reactions. The CV curves for NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes measured at the potential window from 0.625 to 0.825 V vs. RHE using different scan rates are shown in Fig. S6(a) and (b) in the ESI,† respectively. There is no redox peak in the curves, suggesting a suitable potential window for estimating the ECSA. The square shape of the CV curves suggests the simple capacitance contributed from the electrical double layer (Cdl). Subsequently the difference between the oxidation current (ia) and the reduction current (ic) at a potential of 0.725 V vs. RHE was plotted as a function of the scan rate. Fig. S6(c) and (d) in the ESI† respectively show the relation of the difference between ia and ic and the scan rate for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes. The Cdl values of 5.70 F cm−2 (431.82 F g−1) and 4.92 F cm−2 (372.73 F g−1) were obtained for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes, respectively. It is surprising to find that the ECSA for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode is larger than that for the NiCo2S4@NiMoO4/NF electrode. This result is probably the reason for the better electrocatalytic activity of the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode. As observed in the TEM image, the NiMoO4 shell is not simply grown on the NiCo2S4 NTA core. Instead, the nanoparticle-assembled wall of the core was dissolved and a new nanomaterial was formed by using the dissolved chemicals and the molybdenum precursor in the hydrothermal solution. The nanoparticles possess larger surface area compared to that of the nanosheets. The NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode with the nanoparticle-assembled wall could probably present larger active surface area for contact with electrolytes, as found in ECSA analysis. Since the larger active surface area has been proved for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode, it is necessary to discuss the better energy storage ability of the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode. Other than the active surface area, the electrical conductivity and the intrinsic properties of the nanomaterial are also important factors influencing the electrocatalytic activity and the energy storage ability of the electrodes. It was reported that the addition of molybdenum in the metal compound is primary to enhance the electrical conductivity other than enhancing the redox reactions for energy storage. The NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode could possess better electrical conductivity than the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode. Hence, the trade-off between the ECSA and the electrical conductivity may be the primary cause for the different results on the electrocatalytic activity and the energy storage ability of the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrodes. Due to the larger potential applied for examining the electrocatalytic activity, the larger driving force may induce the reaction of more ions on the active area for facilitating the electrocatalytic reactions. Hence the extra portion of the active surface area for NiCo2S4 NTA/NF compared to that for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode could be efficiently used for electrocatalysis. However, the smaller potential applied to carry out the faradaic reactions for energy storage may induce the migration of less ions to the electrode. Hence the active surface area could not be fully utilized and the advantage of the active surface area for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode may play a less important role in energy storage than in electrocatalysis. Due to the less important role of the active surface area, the enhancement of the electrical conductivity for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode could thus become more dominant in electrochemical applications. This is probably the reason for the better energy storage ability of the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode. Also, there are more reports on the application of molybdenum for energy storage than for electrocatalysis. Hence the presence of molybdenum could be more preferable for energy storage materials, which is another probable reason for the better energy storage ability of the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4/NF electrode and the better electrocatalytic activity of the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode.
Moreover, the long-term stability of the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode was also evaluated by measuring the current density at 1.68 V vs. RHE for 10 hours in an electrolyte of 1 M KOH, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The LSV curves for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode measured before and after 10 hours of the chronopotentiometric measurement are shown in Fig. 6(d). A current density retention of 66.8% was attained for the NiCo2S4 NTA/NF electrode after a long-term test for 10 hours, and a decay occurred at potential larger than 1.3 V vs. RHE. The decay in the current density is probably due to the peeling-off of the active nanomaterial from the nickel foam substrate due to the severe generation of gases and especially to the escape of the gases from the inner of the nanotubes.

Table 2 lists the preparation and electrochemical parameters for the NiCo2S4-based electrodes applied as electrocatalysts in comparison to the previous literature. It is found that the Tafel slope for the optimized electrode in this work is competitive with those reported in the previous literature. The overpotential is hard to compare since the overpotential was reported at different currents. However, a smaller overpotential at a higher current was achieved for the NiCo2S4 electrode reported in this work compared to those for the certain electrodes reported in previous literature.

4. Conclusion
A NiCo2S4 NTA and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 core–shell hollow structures were successfully synthesized on Ni foam using hydrothermal synthesis coupled with calcination for application in energy storage and electrocatalysis for oxygen evolution. The hydrothermal synthesis for growing the NiMoO4 shell leads to the dissolution of the NiCo2S4 core. Therefore, the composition of core was changed to NiCo2OxSy and the original nanoparticle-assembled wall of the NiCo2S4 NTA turned into a nanosheet-assembled tube. The battery-type electrode with the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 core–shell hollow structure showed a higher areal capacitance of 17.75 F cm−2 (1345 F g−1) corresponding to a capacity of 2.22 mA h cm−2 (168.18 mA h g−1) at 10 mA cm−2 compared to that for the NiCo2S4 NTA electrode measured under the same conditions. The resulting battery supercapacitor hybrid achieved a maximum energy density of 5.28 W h kg−1 at a power density of 329 W kg−1 and a CF retention of 100% after 2000 charging/discharging cycles. On the other hand, the NiCo2S4 NTA electrode showed a smaller overpotential of 1.553 V vs. RHE at a current density of 0.12 A cm−2 (9.09 A g−1) and a smaller Tafel slope of 86.1 mV dec−1 for the electrocatalytic process toward the oxygen evolution reaction, compared to those for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 electrode. The results present different electrochemical activities toward energy storage and electrocatalysis for the NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 electrodes. It is inferred that the electrochemically active surface area and the electrical conductivity are important factors influencing the electrochemical performances, and the electrochemical applications at different potentials are found to prefer different designs of the nanomaterials.
