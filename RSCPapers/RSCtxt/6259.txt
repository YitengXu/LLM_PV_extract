The surfaces of ZnO nanowires immobilized on a conducting glass substrate were modified to form ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowire arrays through a reaction with an aqueous sodium selenite and hydrazine solution. ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowires with different morphologies were synthesized by varying solution concentrations and reaction times. The ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanoparticle heterostructures (ZS1) were synthesized by a dissolution–recrystallization mechanism. At longer reaction times and higher solution concentrations, the nanostructure arrays transformed into ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanosphere heterostructure arrays (ZS2) via Ostwald ripening. ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure arrays (ZS1 and ZS2) yielded higher photocurrents than the pristine ZnO nanowire arrays in a PEC water splitting test under AM 1.5G simulated solar light. The ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure array photoanodes exhibited absorption in the visible spectrum (<550 nm in wavelength) with a high incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) of up to 47% (ZS1) or 57% (ZS2) at 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photoanode yielded a relatively high photocurrent density of 1.67 mA cm−2 (ZS1) or 2.35 mA cm−2 (ZS2) at 0.3 V compared to the ZnO nanowire arrays (0.125 mA cm−2). Structural differences between ZS1 and ZS2 yielded different PEC performances. A comparison to ZS2 revealed that ZS1 exhibited a higher photocurrent density under a low applied potential (from −0.78 V to −0.07 V) and a lower photocurrent density under a high applied potential (above −0.07 V).
1. Introduction
The world's population and the demand for energy are increasing. Fossil fuels are in limited supply, and their combustion creates carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas. These conditions have driven interest in and progress toward the development of alternative energy technologies. In principle, fuels can be generated from abundant inexpensive small molecules, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.1 One of the most attractive energy conversion reactions is the solar splitting of water to produce oxygen and hydrogen, which have a high energy content per unit mass (120 J g−1, about three times that of gasoline) and a clean combustion by-product, water, when consumed during energy generation.2–4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive process due to its theoretical potential for achieving a high efficiency, >30%, its low cost, and its environmental friendliness.5
Metal oxide nanostructures are promising materials for solar energy conversion. They are highly stable, their small size is comparable to their carrier scattering length, they display strong absorption coefficients due to an increase of oscillator strength, and their synthetic routes are well-established. In particular, one-dimensional metal oxide nanostructures, such as nanowires, offer the added potential advantage of good charge transport over zero-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanoparticles.2,5,6 However, an “Achilles' heel” of most metal oxides with respect to their use in solar materials is that they do not absorb significantly in the visible region of the spectrum due to the deep valence band positions (O 2p orbitals). Because photo-excitation of a semiconductor proceeds through the absorption of light at an energy equal to or exceeding the band gap energy, most wide band gap metal oxides cannot efficiently capture solar energy. Visible light accounts for 44–47% of the solar energy spectrum, whereas UV light accounts for only 3–5%. Therefore, efficient use of visible light is an essential prerequisite for the efficient conversion of solar energy.
Zinc oxide (ZnO, space group = P63mc; a = 0.32495 nm, c = 0.52069 nm) is a useful oxide material for PEC processes and photocatalysis.7 It assumes a rich variety of nanostructures8–17 and provides an electron mobility (205–300 cm2 V s−1) that exceeds that of TiO2 (0.1–4 cm2 V s−1),18 thereby reducing electrical resistance and enhancing the electron transfer efficiency. ZnO has a wide band gap (Eg(bulk) = 3.37 eV at room temperature) and cannot absorb visible light. Thus, ZnO only makes use of 3–5% of the solar spectrum that reaches the earth. Several approaches have been developed in an effort to overcome this limitation.4 One approach involves introducing anionic non-metal dopants into the ZnO structures. Doping with C, S, or N was postulated to reduce the band gap in wide band gap metal oxides.19 ZnO doping has been tested with C or N.6,20,21 The introduction of a dopant into the ZnO crystal lattice produced an intermediate energy level in the band gap and reduced the absorption energy.20,22 However, incorporation of dopants also increased the number of carrier recombination centers, thereby reducing the PEC and photocatalytic activity.23,24 Semiconductor heterojunction formation can potentially simultaneously improve the optical absorption capacity while reducing the propensity for charge recombination.25,26 To extend photoconversion to the visible range, narrow band gap semiconductors have been coupled to ZnO nanostructures. ZnO/CdX (X = S, Se, or Te) heterostructures have been described for this purpose.27–31 Unfortunately, many cadmium compounds are carcinogenic, and cadmium metal itself presents a cancer risk. Zinc selenide (ZnSe) is a candidate for producing type II ZnO heterostructures because its band gap (2.67 eV) is narrower than that of ZnO, and its valence and conduction band alignment are staggered relative to those of ZnO. However, investigations of ZnO/ZnSe heterostructures have been sparse.32–35
Recently, our research groups reported a method for synthesizing three distinct type II three-dimensional (3D) ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure powders through solution-based surface modifications.32 The visible light photocatalytic activities of the 3D ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure powders were also examined. Here, we describe a method for synthesizing ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowire arrays for use in PEC water splitting. Surface modification of the ZnO nanowire arrays produced ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowire arrays. By varying the solution concentrations and the surface modification reaction times, ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowires with different morphologies could be synthesized. The light absorption properties, PEC water splitting performance using a solar simulator, and performance as a function of the light wavelength of these ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowire arrays were evaluated.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis of ZnO nanowire arrays (ZA)
All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Zinc acetate dihydrate (0.11 g, Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99%, Samchun) and 2 mL ammonia water (NH3, 28.0–30.0 wt%, Samchun) were added to 50 mL deionized (DI) water. The solution was transferred to a glass bottle. To prepare the substrate, a 30 nm thick ZnO seed layer was deposited onto a 1.25 × 1.5 cm2 fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by sputtering. The substrate was transferred into the solution and was leaned against the inner wall of the bottle. The ZnO seed layer side of the substrate was oriented downward. The substrate and solution-containing bottle were put into an oven and maintained at 95 °C for 6 h. After the reaction, the substrate was washed several times with DI water and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h (ZB). The substrate was annealed in a furnace (Lindberg, Blue M) at 500 °C for 2 h with Ar (ZA).
Synthesis of ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanoparticle heterostructure arrays (ZS1)
An aqueous solution containing 0.2 mM sodium selenite (Na2SeO3, 99%, Aldrich) and 0.075 M hydrazine monohydrate (N2H4·H2O, Samchun) was prepared at room temperature. The ZnO nanowire array substrate (prior to annealing, ZB) and the 25 mL solution were loaded into a microwave reactor (Discover SP, CEM Corporation). The microwave reactor automatically controlled reaction temperatures as programmed. The solution was heated to 140 °C. Once the reaction temperature reached 140 °C, the reactor was permitted to cool gradually to 80 °C. The substrate was washed several times with DI water and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The substrate was annealed at 500 °C for 2 h with Ar (ZS1).
Synthesis of ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanosphere heterostructure arrays (ZS2)
An aqueous solution containing 0.67 mM sodium selenite and 0.25 M hydrazine monohydrate was prepared at room temperature. The ZnO nanowire array substrate (prior to annealing, ZB) and the 25 mL solution were loaded into the microwave reactor. The solution was heated to 140 °C and was maintained at 140 °C for 10 min. The solution was then permitted to cool to 80 °C. The substrate was washed several times with DI water and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The substrate was annealed at 500 °C for 2 h with Ar (ZS2).
Characterization
The morphology, crystallinity, crystalline nature, chemical composition, and optical properties of the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JMS-7401F and Philips Electron Optics B. V. XL30S FEG, operated at 10 keV), X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD, Mac Science, M18XHF using Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15406 nm), high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM, Cs-corrected, JEOL JEM-2200FS with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer operated at 200 kV and an electron energy loss spectrometer (EELS)), elemental analysis (Analysennsysteme GmBH, Vario EL II), and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV2501PC). For TEM observations, the synthesized nanostructures were separated from the substrate by a knife and dispersed in ethanol using an ultrasonicator. Several drops of the ethanol dispersion were introduced onto a carbon-coated Cu grid and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
The PEC measurements were conducted using a standard three-electrode cell with a Ag/AgCl (3.0 M NaCl) reference electrode, a platinum foil as a counter electrode, and a potentiostat (Potentiostat/Galvanostat Model 263A EG&G Princeton Applied Research). The photoactivity was measured by connecting the fabricated film to a copper wire using silver paste, and the exposed FTO surface was then covered with epoxy resin. A mixture of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution was used to deliver the electrolyte and the sacrificial reagent to maintain the stability of ZnSe. The electrolyte had a pH of 12.5, and the solution potential was −0.74 V. The photocurrent–potential curve was recorded under a simulated solar spectrum generated by a solar simulator (Oriel 91160) with AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated with respect to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using a reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL), USA. The incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Hg lamp (450 W, Oriel) and a monochromator with a bandwidth of 5 nm. The IPCE was measured at 0.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show SEM images of ZA. The nanowires were aligned on the substrate. The average diameter of these nanowires was ∼70 nm, and the nanowires had smooth surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 1(c) and (d) display SEM images of ZS1. The general morphologies of these nanowires were similar to those of ZA (Fig. 1(c)), however, the nanowire surfaces were rougher (Fig. 1(c)). Nanoparticles formed on the nanowires. SEM images (Fig. 1(e) and (f)) of ZS2 show that spherical particles were attached to the nanowires. Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of the ZA, ZS1, and ZS2 samples. The XRD pattern of ZA (Fig. 2(a)) shows that all peaks except for the FTO peaks could be indexed as hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structures with calculated lattice constants of a = 0.3247 nm and c = 0.5208 nm. These lattice constants were consistent with previously reported data (JCPDS No. 36-1451). Because no diffraction peaks were observed in the XRD patterns, we concluded that pure hexagonal-phase ZnO nanowire arrays were fabricated. A relatively high intensity ZnO (002) peak indicated a high degree of alignment among the ZnO nanowires. Fig. 2(b) shows a XRD pattern of the ZS1 sample. The peak intensity was magnified ten times that of the ZA XRD pattern (Fig. 2(a)). In addition to the FTO and ZnO peaks, (111) and (220) peaks were observed for the cubic zinc blend ZnSe structure (JCPDS No. 37-1463). Fig. 2(c) shows an XRD peak of the ZS2 sample. The ZnO and FTO peaks were assigned similar to those of ZA and ZS1. The relative intensities of the ZnSe (111) and ZnSe (220) peaks increased, and a ZnSe (311) peak appeared.

Fig. 3(a) shows a TEM image of a ZS1 nanowire. As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 1(d)), nanoparticles were observed on the nanowire surface. A high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (Fig. 3(b)) of the area indicated by the circle in Fig. 3(a) shows that polycrystalline nanoparticles were attached to a single crystalline nanowire. The nanowire was single crystalline with a lattice spacing of 0.26 nm, which corresponded to the distance between the (002) planes in the hexagonal ZnO crystal lattice. The 0.33 nm lattice spacing of the nanoparticles corresponded to the distance between the (111) lattice planes of the cubic ZnSe crystal. The interfaces of ZnO/ZnSe heterostructures were clean. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3(c)) of the nanowire showed a rectangular arrangement of ZnO spots (001 spot and 010 spot) and ring-shape patterns corresponding to ZnSe 111, 220, and 331. The compositions of the 3D structures were investigated by EELS. Fig. 3(d) shows a TEM image of a nanowire. The EELS elemental maps demonstrated that Zn (Fig. 3(e)) and O (Fig. 3(f)) were distributed homogeneously within the core nanowire, and Zn (Fig. 3(e)) and Se (Fig. 3(g)) were distributed throughout the nanoparticles. Taken together, the SEM, XRD, TEM, and EELS data support that the ZS1 nanowire was composed of a single crystalline core ZnO nanowire decorated with polycrystalline ZnSe nanoparticles.

Fig. 4(a) shows a low-magnification TEM image of a ZS2 nanostructure. A nanosphere was attached to a nanowire. Fig. 4(b) shows a HR-TEM image of the interfacial area indicated by the circle in Fig. 4(a). The nanowire was single crystalline in nature, with an axis direction of [001] revealed by the lattice spacing of 0.52 nm, which corresponded to the interplanar separation of the (001) planes of a wurtzite ZnO phase. A polycrystalline nanosphere was attached to the nanowire. A lattice spacing of 0.33 nm in the polycrystalline nanosphere indicated the distance between the (111) planes of a cubic ZnSe phase. The SAED image (Fig. 4(c)) revealed a single crystalline ZnO spot pattern and a polycrystalline ZnSe ring pattern (111, 220, and 331). The nanowire/nanosphere interfaces were clean without noticeable contamination. An interfacial contamination or defect between ZnO and ZnSe was one of the main recombination sites for the photo-carriers. To reduce the interfacial defects, we annealed the anodes at 500 °C under inert atmosphere. The qualitative mapping using EELS demonstrated that Zn (Fig. 4(d)) and O (Fig. 4(e)) were distributed within the nanowire, and Zn (Fig. 4(d)) and Se (Fig. 4(f)) were distributed throughout the nanosphere. Therefore, the nanostructure of ZS2 was determined to comprise a single crystalline core ZnO nanowire and a polycrystalline ZnSe nanosphere.

The Zn source used to form ZnSe nanoparticles or nanospheres on the ZnO surfaces was the ZnO nanowires themselves. Under alkaline conditions in the presence of hydrazine, hydroxyl anions react with ZnO surfaces (local dissolution of ZnO), which releases Zn(OH)42− (reaction (1)). The concentration of Zn(OH)42− near the ZnO surfaces thereby locally increases. ZnOsurface + H2O + 2OH− → Zn(OH)2−4(1) SeO2−3 + N2H4 → Se + N2 + H2O + 2OH−(2) 3Se + 6OH− → 2Se2− + SeO2−3 + 3H2O(3) Se2− + Zn(OH)2−4 → ZnSe + 4OH−(4)The SeO32− ions in the reaction solution were reduced first by hydrazine to Se atoms or clusters as the reaction temperature increased (reaction (2)). Highly reactive Se atoms or clusters were then further reduced or disproportionated in the alkaline solution to generate Se2− ions (reaction (3)).36 The Se2− ions then reacted with Zn(OH)42− to form ZnSe by heterogeneous nucleation and growth on the ZnO surfaces and as-nucleated ZnSe nanocrystallites (reaction (4)).37,38 Thus, single-crystalline ZnO nanowire/polycrystalline ZnSe nanoparticle heterostructure arrays (ZS1) formed. The growth of ZnSe accompanied a decrease in the number density of the particles on the ZnO surfaces. The size of remained ZnSe nanostructure increased and the number density of ZnSe structures decreased as the reaction time progressed. This observation indicates that larger ZnSe nanostructures were growing upon sacrifices of smaller ones. When the reaction time was prolonged to 10 min at 140 °C, the nanostructure arrays were transformed into ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanosphere heterostructure arrays (ZS2) via this Ostwald ripening.39
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the nanostructure arrays (ZA, ZS1, and ZS2) are shown in Fig. 5. The spectra revealed significant differences in the optical absorption properties of the ZnO nanostructures and the ZnO/ZnSe heterostructures. The ZA showed broad strong absorptions in the ultraviolet region near the visible region, which were characteristic of the wide band gap ZnO semiconductor materials. However, the ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanoparticle heterostructure arrays (ZS1) showed some absorption in the visible region (<550 nm in wavelength) as well as in the ultraviolet region. The ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanoparticle heterostructure arrays (ZS2) absorbed more visible light than ZS1. These visible light absorption bands of the heterostructures (ZS1 and ZS2) between 400 nm and 550 nm were attributed to the visible light absorption of ZnSe nanostructures on the ZnO nanowires.
 Fig. 5  UV-vis absorption spectra of the ZnO nanowire arrays (ZA), ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanoparticle heterostructure arrays (ZS1), and ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanosphere heterostructure arrays (ZS2). 

Fig. 6 shows a set of linear sweep voltammograms measured from the nanostructure photoanodes (ZA, ZS1, or ZS2) in a 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution in the dark or under AM 1.5G simulated solar light illumination (light intensity: 1 sun or 100 mW cm−2). Linear sweep voltammetry is a common electrochemical technique for examining charge-carrier characteristics at a semiconductor/electrolyte interface.40 The photocurrent observed under light illumination is a direct measure of the rate of water splitting and reflects the number of charge carriers produced from the incident light and their subsequent participation in the water oxidation reaction on the photoanode or hydrogen ion reduction on the counter electrode.41 All photoanodes showed small dark current densities, on the order of 10−2 to 10−4 mA cm−2 from −0.8 to 0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The photoanodes showed a pronounced photoresponse under light illumination. ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure arrays (ZS1 and ZS2) exhibited significantly higher photocurrent compared to the pristine ZnO nanowire arrays (ZA). These results were attributed to the improved visible light absorption by the ZnSe nanostructures, as shown in the UV-vis absorption studies (Fig. 5), and a decrease in the probability of charge recombination by type II energy band alignment of ZnO and ZnSe (see the schematic band diagram (Fig. S1†) in the (ESI†)). ZS1 yielded a pronounced photocurrent that increased from −0.78 V and was characterized by a photocurrent density of 1.67 mA cm−2 at 0.3 V. The flat band potential of ZnSe was more negative than that of ZnO. Thus, when ZnO was coupled with ZnSe, the flat band potential of ZnO was shifted towards negative potentials. Thus, the onset potential became more negative, as seen in the ZS1 sample, than in the ZA sample (−0.47 V).42,43 ZS1 revealed relatively small polycrystalline ZnSe nanoparticles (∼10 nm) that were well-distributed on the surfaces of the ZnO nanorods. However, as shown in the electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) images of ZS2, most of the polycrystalline ZnSe nanoparticles were agglomerated to form relatively large spheres (300 nm in diameter) on the restricted area of the single crystalline ZnO nanowires. The ZnO structures were less effectively coupled to ZnSe on the ZS2, and the onset potential was not as extensively shifted toward negative values as that of ZS1. For the same reason, ZS1 showed a higher photocurrent density under a low applied potential (from −0.78 V to −0.07 V). A negative shift in the flat band potential led to the accumulation of electrons, which indicated a lower degree of carrier recombination. Under higher applied potentials (<0.07 V), the ZS2 sample yielded the highest relative PEC performance. For example, at 0.3 V, the photocurrent density of ZS2 was 2.35 mA cm−2, higher than that of ZA (0.125 mA cm−2) or ZS1 (1.67 mA cm−2). This was attributed to the fact that the ratio of ZnSe to ZnO was larger in ZS2 than in ZS1, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 5) and the TEM images (Fig. 3 and 4).
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent densities of ZnO nanowire arrays (ZA), ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanoparticle heterostructure arrays (ZS1), and ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanosphere heterostructure arrays (ZS2) measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light (1 sun) in an aqueous solution of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3. 
Incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were conducted to study the photoresponse of the nanowire array photoanodes as a function of the wavelength of incident light (Fig. 7). The IPCE is defined by the following equation: IPCE = [J × 1240]/[Pmonoλ](5)where J = photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Pmono = light power density (mW cm−2) at λ, and λ = wavelength of incident light (nm). A comparison of ZS1 and ZS2 to ZA showed that the IPCE was substantially enhanced in both the visible and UV regions due primarily to a higher absorption coefficient of the ZnSe nanostructures. The IPCE behavior followed the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5) qualitatively. The IPCEs of ZS1 and ZS2 were significantly greater than that of ZA under visible light illumination over the range 380–540 nm. A relatively low IPCE for the ZnO/ZnSe heterostructures in the UV light region (<360 nm) was attributed to substantial absorption of UV light by FTO and more UV than visible scattering.44 The IPCE of ZS2 at 0.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was better than that of ZS1, which was corroborated by the photocurrent density measurements shown in Fig. 6. The ZS2 sample exhibited a high IPCE of 48–57% in the range 380–440 nm, and some IPCE was observed beyond 460 nm. The IPCE dropped to a minimal level beyond 550 nm because the ZnO/ZnSe heterostructures could not absorb light beyond 550 nm, as shown in the UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure arrays. The IPCE of ZS1 followed a trend similar to that of ZS2.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we designed a method for synthesizing ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowire arrays for use in PEC water splitting. The surfaces of ZnO nanowires were modified to form ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowire arrays via simple solution-based reactions. ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowires with different morphologies were synthesized by varying the solution concentrations and the surface modification reaction times. ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanoparticle heterostructures (ZS1) were synthesized from a dissolution–recrystallization mechanism. As the reaction time progressed at higher solution concentrations, the nanostructure arrays transformed into ZnO nanowire/ZnSe nanosphere heterostructure arrays (ZS2) via Ostwald ripening. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure nanowire arrays exhibited absorption bands in the visible spectrum (<550 nm) as well as in the UV region. A PEC water splitting test showed that the ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure arrays (ZS1 and ZS2) yielded a significantly higher photocurrent than the pristine ZnO nanowire arrays. The visible light absorption properties of the ZnSe nanostructures and the type II band alignment between ZnO and ZnSe may have contributed to the enhanced PEC performance under simulated solar light. Structural differences between ZS1 and ZS2 resulted in different PEC performances. This simple surface modification method may potentially be extended to multi-component and/or more complex systems for solar energy conversion.
