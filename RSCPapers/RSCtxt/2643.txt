    , Accepted 27th October 2017First published on 31st October 2017AbstractA novel Ni-based 2,2′-bisdipyrrinato complex bearing peripheral benzoic acid groups (Ni-bisdpmCOOH) has been synthesized and characterized. Electrochemical investigations revealed a high energy LUMO level that, combined with its absorption properties extending up to the NIR region, is compatible with its use as a sensitizer in thermodynamically uphill photocatalytic reactions, such as proton and carbon dioxide photoreduction. A sensitized photo-anode was prepared by adsorbing Ni-bisdpmCOOH onto a TiO2 film, which showed an incident photon to current efficiency, measured at 0.62 V vs. RHE, extending up to the visible light region. This demonstrates that electronically excited Ni-bisdpmCOOH is effectively able to inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2, thus opening the way for effective TiO2 sensitization or MOF implementation of the molecule itself for energetic applications.
Introduction
While the most studied class of dyes based on the dipyrrin backbone is that of boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) characterized by high chemical and photochemical stability,1 several examples of luminescent dipyrrin metal complexes have also been recently reported,2e.g. dipyrrin complexes containing Rh(III),3 Cu(I),4 Pt(II),5 Ir(III)6 and Zn(II).7 For these systems, the rigidity of the bispyrrolic backbone as well as the steric hindrance of the peripheral aryl groups has been shown to affect their photophysical properties such as the fluorescence quantum yield and the excited state lifetime.2,6,7 The majority of these compounds are based on ligands with a single dipyrrin moiety functionalized by various groups at the pyrrolic and/or at the meso positions.
2,2′-Bis-dipyrrins comprising two dipyrrin fragments connected by a single C–C bond can be regarded as acyclic analogues of corroles.8 Even though this class of molecules has been described long ago,9 so far its use has been mostly limited to the preparation of helicate-type complexes.10 Although these systems have interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties with potential applications in several fields, a systematic and detailed investigation of such features is still lacking, with only a few reports published so far.11 Furthermore, the introduction of such species into more complex architectures and materials has, to the best of our knowledge, not been achieved.
In this contribution, we report on the synthesis of a novel Ni-based 2,2′-bisdipyrrin complex Ni-bisdpmCOOH (Scheme 1) bearing peripheral benzoic groups allowing potential grafting on metal oxide semiconductor surfaces, such as TiO2. Ni-bisdpmCOOH displays absorption properties extending up to the near infrared (NIR) region of the spectrum. The photophysical and electrochemical characterization of this complex evidenced a suitable positioning of its LUMO energy level with respect to the H+/H2 redox couple, which makes it a potential sensitizer for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Experimental details
Syntheses
All commercial chemicals were used as received from the suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, TCI Europe and Fluorochem) without further purification. Solvents were dried prior to use. The Ni-dpmCOOMe and Ni-bisdpmCOOMe complexes (see Scheme 1) and the free bisdpmCOOH ligand were prepared according to already reported procedures.10g,12

Complex Ni-bisdpmCOOH. 
Ni-bisdpmCOOMe (100.0 mg, 0.164 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of THF, NaOH 1.0 M and H2O (3/1/1, 25 mL total volume) and refluxed overnight. After cooling to room temperature (RT), the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the aqueous phase was acidified by the addition of a 1.0 M HCl solution down to pH 6.5. This caused the precipitation of Ni-bisdpmCOOH as a black powder which was recovered by filtration and the solid was washed with water and finally dried in air (69.6 mg, 72.5%). 1H-NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 8.09 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 5H), 7.69 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 5H), 6.83 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 6.74 (d, J = 4.4 Hz, 2H), 6.71 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 6.56 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 6.02 (s, 2H).13 ESI-MS: m/z = 581.37 [M − H+].


[5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrinato]-Ni(II) (NiTCPP). 
Step 1 consisted of the synthesis of [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-methoxycarboxyphenyl)porphyrin] (TCPPCOOMe). Pyrrole (3.0 mL, 0.043 mol) and methyl 4-formylbenzoate (6.9 g, 0.042 mol) were added to propionic acid (100 mL) in a 500 mL 3-necked flask and the solution was refluxed overnight in the dark. After cooling to RT, TCPPCOOMe precipitated as a microcrystalline dark powder. This solid was collected by vacuum filtration, first washed with propionic acid, then with water and finally dried in an oven at 80 °C. Yield = 2.5 g (17.5%). 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 8.82 (s, 8H), 8.45 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 8H), 8.29 (d, J = 8.25 Hz, 8H), 4.11 (s, 12H), −2.81 (bs, 2H).
For the synthesis of [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-methoxycarbonyl phenyl)porphyrinato]-Ni(II) (NiTCPPCOOMe) (step 2), a solution of TPPCOOMe (500.0 mg, 0.59 mmol) and NiCl2·6H2O (1.80 g, 7.57 mmol) in 60 mL of DMF was refluxed for 5 h. After cooling to RT, the addition of ca. 150 mL of water caused the precipitation of NiTCPPCOOMe as a dark powder. The solid was filtered, and subsequently washed with water and with 1.0 M HCl until the filtrate became colourless. The crystalline powder thus obtained (quantitative yield) was dried in an oven at 80 °C and directly used, without further purification, in the final step 3, yielding [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrinato]-Ni(II) (NiTCPP).
In step 3, NiTPPCOOMe (500 mg) was stirred in a mixture of THF and methanol (25 mL each), and a solution of NaOH (2.4 g, 60 mmol) in water (25 mL) was added. This mixture was refluxed overnight. After cooling to RT, THF and methanol were removed under vacuum and the volume was restored by the addition of water. The mixture was refluxed for ca. 30 min in order to obtain a homogeneous solution, which was acidified with 1.0 M HCl up to complete precipitation. The solid was then filtered, washed with water until the filtrate became colourless and dried in an oven at 80 °C.

Photoelectrode preparation
Photoanodes were prepared by depositing a commercial TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP, Solaronix) on a fluorine tin oxide (FTO) electrode through the so-called doctor-blade technique, followed by adsorption of Ni-bisdpmCOOH through electrostatic interaction between the carboxylic groups of the Ni complex and the –OH units on the TiO2 surface. In detail, the FTO electrode was covered with a scotch tape (3 M), thus obtaining a 0.25 cm2 exposed surface. A small amount of the TiO2 paste was spread onto the surface with the aid of a microscope slide. The scotch tape was then removed and the electrodes were kept at 70 °C for 1 h and finally annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. A few drops of a Ni-bisdpmCOOH solution in DMF (concentration ca. 10−3 M) were deposited on the so-obtained TiO2 – covered FTO electrodes and left to dry in air. The non-adsorbed dye was removed by washing with DMF and the absorption spectrum of the clean electrode was recorded. This procedure was repeated until no further increase in absorbance was detected. A total of 10 cycles were performed to attain the final, highest absorbance.
The TiO2 – covered FTO photoelectrodes modified with NiTCPP were obtained following an identical procedure, using a 0.5 mM solution of NiTCPP in DMF.
Structural and photo(electro)chemical characterization
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data were collected on a Bruker AVANCE 300 instrument (300 MHz) at RT. The chemical shift and coupling constant values are given in ppm and Hz, respectively.
ESI-MS analyses were performed using a LCQ Fleet ion trap mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionisation source and an ‘Ion Trap’ mass analyser. The sample was solubilized in methanol and traces of DMF were added in order to promote its solubility. The MS spectra were obtained by direct infusion of the sample solution under ionisation, ESI negative mode. Full-scan mass spectra were recorded in the 50–2000 mass/charge (m/z) range.
UV-Vis-NIR studies were performed on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 650 S spectrometer with a 2 nm resolution and a 200 nm min−1 scanning rate. UV-Vis-NIR reflectance was measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 spectrometer (spectra recorded in the reflection mode, using a 150 mm integrating sphere) with a resolution of 2 nm and a scanning rate of 200 nm min−1.
Cyclic voltammetry was performed in a conventional three-electrode cell using an Autolab PGSTAT 12 potentiostat (EcoChemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands), controlled by the NOVA (version 2.1) software. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode with a surface area of 0.071 cm2, a Pt wire was the counter electrode, with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.
The observed peak potential (Ep) was expressed with respect to the Fc+|Fc redox couple by subtracting the Fc+|Fc half-height peak value, calculated as Ep/2(Fc+|Fc) = (Ep,a(Fc+|Fc) + Ep,c(Fc+|Fc))/2, with Ep,a and Ep,c referring to the anodic and cathodic peaks, respectively. Moreover, Ep values were converted into the NHE scale by using the following equation: , where  is the potential value of the Fc+|Fc couple (4.8 V) and  is the potential of the H+/H2 couple (4.44 V), both referred to vacuum.
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a home-made 3-arm cell and the same potentiostat employed for cyclic voltammetry analysis, with the photoelectrode used as the working electrode (0.25 cm2 active surface), a Pt gauze as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) as the reference electrode. The photoelectrodes were tested under back side illumination (through the FTO/TiO2/Ni-bisdpmCOOH interface). The light source was an Oriel, Model 81172 Solar Simulator with different cut-off filters (420 and 550 nm). The power intensity of the unfiltered AM 1.5G light, measured by means of a Thorlabs PM200 power meter equipped with a S130VC power head with Si detector, was 100 W cm−2. A 0.5 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution buffered at pH 7 with potassium phosphate was used in photoelectrochemical measurements. The potential vs. Ag/AgCl was converted into the RHE scale using the following equation: , with  at 25 °C.
Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out using a 300 W Lot-Oriel Xe lamp equipped with a Lot-Oriel Omni-λ 150 monochromator and a Thorlabs SC10 automatic shutter. A 0.62 V bias vs. RHE was applied and the current was measured with a 20 nm step, within the 400–900 nm wavelength range. The incident light power was measured at each wavelength using the above-mentioned calibrated Thorlabs photodiode and power meter. The IPCE was calculated at each wavelength by the following equation:  where j is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and Pλ (nW cm−2) is the power of the monochromatic light at wavelength λ (nm).
The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) at each wavelength was calculated by combining the IPCE spectrum with the absorption (A) spectrum of the photoanode:  X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was measured on a BRUKER D8-Focus Bragg–Brentano X-ray Powder Diffractometer equipped with a Cu sealed tube (λ = 1.54178 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of Ni-bisdpmCOOH
The synthetic route to Ni-bisdpmCOOH is depicted in Scheme 1. The saponification of the Ni-bisdpmCOOMe complex was carried out as described by Brückner et al.,14 with a modification concerning the acidification step; indeed acid was added until a pH value of ca. 6 was achieved. Because of the poor solubility of the Ni-bisdpmCOOH complex, the 13C-NMR spectrum could not be recorded. The successful saponification of the ester groups was however confirmed by the absence of the methyl group signals in the upfield region of the 1H-NMR spectrum of the complex Ni-bisdpmCOOH (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). On the other hand, evidence of the retention of Ni in the coordinating environment of the molecule was provided by mass spectrometry analysis, which showed a peak at m/z = 581.37, corresponding to the desired [M − H+] structure.
Optical properties
The absorption spectrum of Ni-bisdpmCOOH, recorded in DMF (concentration of 2.92 × 10−5 M) is shown in Fig. 1, together with the absorption spectra of the Ni-dpmCOOMe and Ni-bisdpmCOOMe complexes, for comparison. Ni-bisdpmCOOH displays a maximum absorption peak at 416 nm, accompanied by less intense and broader peaks at 563, 770 and 846 nm. This absorption spectrum is similar to those previously reported for 2,2′-bisdipyrrin based species10,11 and is comparable to that of the starting Ni-bisdpmCOOMe complex. In contrast, Ni-dpmCOOMe shows an absorption edge at 570 nm with a strong absorption band peaking at 464 nm and shoulders at ca. 440 and 500 nm. The different absorption properties of Ni-bisdpmCOOH and Ni-bisdpmCOOMe complexes with respect to Ni-dpmCOOMe are clearly related to the increased conjugation and molecular rigidity ensured by the 2,2′-pyrrolic C–C bond. This difference is also evidenced by a comparison between the Ni coordination geometry in the two reported crystal structures.10g In fact, while Ni-dpmCOOMe shows a distorted tetrahedral geometry with an angle of ca. 56° between the two bipyrrolic moieties, in Ni-bisdpmCOOMe the same angle is ca. 23°, indicating a distorted square planar geometry.10g

Electrochemical characterization
The redox properties of the Ni-bisdpmCOOH complex were determined by cyclic voltammetry measurements in a DMF solution (3 × 10−4 M) containing 0.1 M tetra-N-butylammonium hexafluoro phosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte under an inert atmosphere, obtained by bubbling N2 in the solution for 10 min. The cyclic voltammetry curves obtained at different potential scanning rates are shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Anodic (positive potentials) and cathodic (negative potentials) scans of Ni-bisdpmCOOH around the first redox potentials, performed at different potential scanning rates. 
The shape of the curve in the anodic part (positive potentials) evidences an irreversible bi-electronic oxidation process at 0.382 V vs. Fc+|Fc for the Ni-bisdipyrrin metalloligand. Moreover, the shift of the anodic oxidation potential with the scan rate implies an electrochemically irreversible electron transfer. Differently, in the cathodic region (negative potentials), the complex displays a chemically and electrochemically reversible one-electron reduction at −1.21 V vs. Fc+|Fc. These electrochemical processes are assigned to ligand-centred electron transfer processes, by analogy with the redox properties already demonstrated for other similar Ni-bisdipyrrin complexes.11a Furthermore, with respect to a similar substituted Ni bisdipyrrin complex investigated by Bröring et al.,11b containing fully alkylated pyrrolic fragments, Ni-bisdpmCOOH displays a significant shift of both cathodic and anodic peaks towards more positive potentials. This effect can be related to the electron depletion induced by the absence of alkyl groups on the bisdipyrrin core,11b which usually behave as electron-donating groups.
On the basis of the oxidation and reduction peaks shown in Fig. 2, the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of Ni-bisdpmCOOH are located at 0.74 and −0.85 V vs. NHE, respectively, with a HOMO–LUMO gap of 1.59 eV, which is slightly lower than 1.62 eV calculated for the fully alkylated dipyrrin analogue.11b This difference can again be ascribed to the presence of alkyl chains, which make the bisdipyrrin complex investigated by Bröring et al.11b more electron rich, but less planar and conjugated than Ni-bisdpmCOOH. On the other hand, the presence of electron attracting carboxyl substituents on the phenyl rings of Ni-bisdpmCOOH should not affect its electronic properties, with the phenyl groups being twisted with respect to the bisdipyrrin core.10g
The cyclic voltammetry curves of nickel tetracarboxyphenyl porphyrin (NiTCPP), which was expressly synthesised in the present work to compare its properties with those of Ni-bisdpmCOOH, display, in the anodic part, a chemically reversible (at high scan rates) and electrochemically irreversible oxidation peak at 0.66 V vs. Fc+|Fc. In the cathodic part, NiTCPP shows a chemically reversible and electrochemically quasi-reversible reduction peak at −1.60 V vs. Fc+|Fc (see Fig. S2, ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are at 1.03 and −1.24 V vs. NHE, respectively (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Ni-bisdpmCOOH and NiTCPP. 
Interestingly, the LUMO positions of both Ni-bisdpmCOOH and NiTCPP are higher in energy with respect to both the TiO2 conduction band (CB) position (i.e. −0.16 V vs. NHE)15 and the H+/H2 reduction potential.16 Therefore, according to the relative energy level positions reported in Fig. 3, the electron injection from the LUMO of both photoexcited complexes into the TiO2 CB is allowed, which makes these systems potentially able to reduce protons from water into hydrogen under visible light irradiation.
Photoelectrochemical characterization
The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of TiO2-based electrodes with adsorbed Ni-bisdpmCOOH molecules are shown in Fig. 4. Each absorption profile is the difference between the spectrum of the electrode containing the adsorbed dye and that of the electrode containing only TiO2.
 Fig. 4  UV-vis absorption spectra of Ni-bisdpmCOOH adsorbed on a TiO2-covered electrode, recorded after each adsorption cycle. The absorption spectrum of bare TiO2 was always subtracted. 
A comparison between these spectra and those reported in Fig. 1 indicates that bisdpmCOOH adsorbed on TiO2 has an absorption spectrum almost identical to that of the free molecule in solution. The slight blue-shift of the main peak with a maximum at 416 nm could be a consequence of the subtracting procedure of the bare TiO2 spectrum, having a residual absorption tail up to 450 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the modified electrode was explored by means of different photoelectrochemical analyses. Fig. 5a shows the linear sweep voltammetry curves recorded with the Ni-bisdpmCOOH on the TiO2 electrode in the 0.22–0.62 V vs. RHE potential range, demonstrating the onset of photocurrent upon illumination with simulated solar irradiation with the 420 nm cut-off filter. The chronoamperometric curves recorded at 0.62 V vs. RHE shown in Fig. 5b clearly indicate the presence of photocurrent for the Ni-bisdpmCOOH – sensitized photoanode also when employing the 550 nm cut-off filter, while no photocurrent was detected with a bare TiO2 electrode even with the 420 nm filter. By comparison, Fig. 5b also shows that when a NiTCPP – sensitized TiO2 electrode was employed as a photoanode under the same conditions, a negligible photocurrent response was detected using the 420 nm cut-off filter, although this molecule absorbs in this spectral region, due to the intense Soret band and the single Q band centred at 532 nm (see Fig. S4, ESI†). The molecular structure and the adsorption conditions of the sensitizer may have a large impact on molecular packing, geometry and aggregation of porphyrin molecules onto the TiO2 surface, eventually affecting the photocurrent response.17 Given this, the photocurrent response of the Ni-bisdipyrrin molecule could be further increased by optimization of the adsorption conditions, thus achieving higher output values.
 Fig. 5  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry curves of Ni-bisdpmCOOH/TiO2 under irradiation with the 420 nm cut off filter and in the dark; (b) chronoamperometric analysis of the Ni-bisdpmCOOH/TiO2 photoanode employing the 420 nm (red thick line) and the 550 nm (black thick line) cut-off filters and of the NiTCPP/TiO2-based photoanode with the 420 nm cut-off filter (thin line); (c) IPCE and IQE curves obtained with the Ni-bisdpmCOOH/TiO2 electrode. 
The IPCE curve shown in Fig. 5c clearly demonstrates that Ni-bisdpmCOOH adsorbed on TiO2 is a rather good sensitizer and that electron injection from photoexcited Ni-bisdpmCOOH to the TiO2 conduction band may efficiently occur up to 620 nm. Moreover, the IQE curve is similar to the IPCE curve, due to the relatively high absorbance of Ni-bisdpmCOOH in the prepared photoanodes (see Fig. 4).
A possible way to avoid the dependence of the photocurrent performance on the adsorption conditions is to implement the Ni-bisdipyrrin molecule into a robust Metal Organic Framework (MOF) by taking advantage of its functionalization by peripheral carboxylic acid groups. In this way, the increased rigidity of the whole system could reduce the excited state distortion of the molecule, thus increasing the separation between the photogenerated electron–hole couples and the electron injection ability of the molecule, in a way similar to that observed with other doped MOF structures.18
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated in detail the photophysical and electrochemical properties of Ni-bisdpmCOOH as a representative example of an intriguing class of bisdipyrrin complexes and demonstrate its effective ability to act as a rather good sensitizer of TiO2-based photoanodes, enabling photocurrent production up to 620 nm irradiation. If successful doping of a stable MOF with this visible light sensitizer can be achieved, one may obtain a robust system for solar-into-chemical energy conversion applications. Research in this direction is currently under way in our laboratories.
