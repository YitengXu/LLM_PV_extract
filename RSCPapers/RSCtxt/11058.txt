    , Accepted 14th November 2022First published on 24th November 2022AbstractThe synthesis of fuels, fuel additives, commercial and potential products from platform molecules generated by the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising strategy toward the utilization of renewable feedstocks. Significant advances have been made on the various transformations (e.g., hydrogenation, oxidation, aldol condensation, rehydration, amination, polymerization, etherification and decarbonylation) of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). This review firstly gives an overview of these various transformations of HMF to produce a number of fuels and chemicals, wherein the fundamental aspects of reaction mechanisms, recent progress and challenges are highlighted. Different types of catalysts are also summarized and compared in tables. One objective is to comment on the synthesis of value-added commercial and potential chemicals (e.g., furan-based polyester platform 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF)). Another purpose of the review is to comment on fuels and fuel additives, including the gasoline blendstock 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), ethyl levulinate (EL), gamma-valerolactone (GVL), methylfuran (MF) and so on. These obtained chemicals could replace the products from petrochemical resources, reducing CO2 emissions.
1. Introduction
The fluctuating supply of costly fossil fuels and their environmental effects have forced society to search for more sustainable sources of energy such as hydroelectricity, wind, solar and biomass.1,2 Plant-derived biomass represents the only sustainable carbon neutral source with an abundance similar to petroleum-based sources.3,4 Plant biomass-based energy and chemicals not only provide local heat and power, but also give impetus to the local economy and increase the energy independence of communities using existing infrastructure (fuel processing, vehicles, CHP).5–7
Lignocellulosic biomass is the inedible portion of biomass and widely exists in the world. As shown in Fig. 1, it is composed of approximately 40–50% cellulose (glucose polymer with β-glycosidic bonds), 25–35% hemicelluloses (amorphous heteropolymer of C6 and C5 sugars), and 15–20% lignin (amorphous phenolic polymer).8 Cellulose and hemicellulose mainly include abundant glycosidic bonds,9 hydrogen bonds,10 and C–C and C–O bonds in the sugar ring. Lignin mainly contains α-O-4, β-O-4, 5–5, β-5, β–β, and β-1 bonds.11 While abundant and inexpensive, lignocellulosic biomass is difficult to fractionate and selective conversion strategies require pretreatment steps for the isolation of its components prior to hydrolysis to its monomeric sugars.12,13 Degraded glucose is a hexose sugar that is a widely existing monosaccharide in nature.12,14–17 As a viable substitute for petroleum, biomass-based chemicals (e.g., furanics) match the wide array of products derived from petroleum.18–20 Among various furanics, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is becoming increasingly important as a platform chemical. It is comprised of a furan ring system with an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group at the 2 and 5 positions.21–23 Many important compounds, including transportation fuels and plastics, are derived from non-renewable petroleum resources and increased demand has strained the global petroleum market.

HMF has been emphasized as one of the top value-added chemicals derived from biomass, being identified as a platform chemical generated in lignocellulosic biorefineries.25 HMF is produced from renewable agricultural sources such as food crop residues and wood wastes. HMF can be produced from the conversion of cellulose,26 which involves three steps: the hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose, isomerisation of glucose into fructose and dehydration of fructose into HMF.27,28 The commercial utility of HMF was first reported at the end of the 19th century, when Deng et al. reported its synthesis by heating inulin with oxalic acid solution under pressure.29–31 HMF has many reactive groups, namely, a formyl group, a hydroxyl group, furan ring and CC double bond. The formyl group could undergo oxidation, hydrogenation, ammonization, and decarbonylation reactions. The hydroxyl group could undergo oxidation, hydrogenation, aldol-condensation, polymerization, and etherification reactions. The furan ring and CC double bond could undergo a hydrogenation reaction. There are a number of potential pathways to transform HMF into fuels, fuel additives, commercial and potential products.32,33 This review is mainly divided into the following sections: the first section involves the family of products that initially involve reactions of the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups, the following section involves removal of the aldehyde group; and the other section describes the potential polymers and chemicals generated from HMF through polymerization. Fig. 2 outlines the fuels, fuel additives, commercial and potential products and their associated reactions that are described in this review. In this review, we firstly give a summary of the recent achievements to establish the mechanism of HMF formation from the catalytic transformation of lignocellulose and then concentrate on the upgrading of HMF to value-added chemicals and liquid fuels, namely furfural, levulinic acid (LA), GVL (gamma-valerolactone), FDCA (2,5-furandicarboxylic acid), DMF (2,5-dimethylfuran), 2-methylfuran (2-MF), FOL (furfuryl alcohol), hydrocarbons and so on (Fig. 2), by mainly focusing on the developments of efficient and selective catalytic systems and advanced reaction processes. Moreover, the catalytic system for each valuable product is summarized and commented upon. The existing issues and outlook for the HMF-based industry are also underlined.

2. Upgrading of HMF to fuels and value-added chemicals
With HMF as a building block, a large number of value-added chemicals and fuels, as shown in Fig. 2, such as LA, GVL, FDCA, FOL and diols, as well as transportation fuels (e.g., liquid alkanes, DMF and 2-MF), have been produced using various methods. Due to its low energy density and instability, HMF is not a promising candidate as a liquid fuel, but rather it is a potential intermediate for renewable chemicals.
2.1 Oxidation of HMF
Various value-added chemicals can be generated through HMF oxidation as shown in Fig. 3.34 Among these value-added chemicals, FDCA is viewed as a promising candidate for terephthalic acid (TA).35,36 TA has been widely used for the synthesis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is a high-demand plastic for package and synthetic fibers. As early as the 1970s, FDCA was used as a candidate for TA for polymer production, but high costs hinder its extensive application. Furthermore, it is still difficult for the TA-based polymer to replace the traditional polymer due to the difference in chemical properties.
 Fig. 3  HMF can be oxidized to many compounds that are obtained from petroleum sources. 

2.1.1 Oxidation mechanism. 
Four intermediates can be generated in the oxidation of HMF through five steps, as shown in Fig. 4. 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), an important acid–alcohol intermediate, can be formed through the oxidation of the aldehyde species in HMF to a carboxyl group. FDCA can be obtained through two oxidation pathways: alcohol oxidation and aldehyde oxidation. It is worth noting that alcohol oxidation is the determining step in the oxidation of HMF.37–39 2,5-Diformylfuran (DFF), a dialdehyde intermediate, is barely obtained in alkaline solution because of disproportionation of the aldehyde under basic conditions.40

The oxidation reaction mechanism of HMF has been investigated in depth. An Au based catalyst is often utilized with the assistance of NaOH for HMF oxidation. Prati et al. reported that polyols and sugars could also be oxidized over a gold catalyst in the presence of a base.42 Davis et al.41,43,44 revealed that NaOH could improve HMF oxidation. A diol can be formed from the aldehydic group of HMF through OH− nucleophilic addition and proton transfer from H2O, and then dehydrogenate to produce a carboxylic acid. Subsequently, two electrons are deposited on the surface of the metal and then the hydroxyl group is deprotonated to form a carbonyl group with the aid of a base to form RCHOOH*. Activation of the C–H bond by the hydroxide ions leads to the formation of RCOOH* through proton transfer. Finally, the carboxylic acid is desorbed from the metal surface (Fig. 5).

The 18O2 isotopic labelling experiment showed that the obtained HMFCA and FDCA did not contain 18O atoms. Some cases confirmed that H2O2 was detected in the aerobic reaction system. Peroxo species could be generated via H2O2 decomposition and then adsorbed on the metal surface to form OH* species and improve the HMF oxidation reaction. As an electron scavenger, O2 could interact with electrons from the catalyst's surface to obtain OH− ions.46 It has been proved that the dehydrogenation of alcohol is the rate-determining step for HMF oxidation. Therefore, HMFCA could be rapidly obtained from HMF within a short reaction time.


2.1.2 Selective oxidation of HMF to DFF. 
2,5-Diformylfuran (DFF) can be generated through the selective oxidation of the hydroxyl group in HMF.47–49 It has been used as an important block for the production of degradable resins, which can be extensively utilized as adhesives, foams, and containers.50 Cottier et al.51 reported that a yield 58% DFF from HMF could be obtained by using a DMSO–K2Cr2O7 catalytic complex at 100 °C. Furthermore, the HMF yield can be enhanced by 75% through ultrasonic irradiation. The use of an ionic liquid as a green solvent was also exploited in DFF generation. Mehdi et al.52 used (NH4)2[Ce(NO3)6] (CAN) in [EMIM][OTf] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethylsulfonate) to oxidize HMF into DFF. The roles of different oxidants in DFF formation were also studied. Cottier et al.53 discussed the oxidation of HMF using 4-substituted 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxide (TEMPO) and co-oxidants, Ca(ClO)2, which could provide an optimum DFF yield of 81%.
Some economically and environmentally friendly oxidants, such as oxygen or air, have been adopted for the conversion of HMF to DFF over metal-based catalysts. Partenheimer and Grushin55 observed DFF formation from the aerobic oxidation of HMF over Co/Mn/Zr/Br or Co/Mn/Br catalysts. Results revealed that Co/Mn/Zr/Br exhibited a better catalytic activity with a higher yield of DFF. Yang et al.54 reported 73% yield of DFF over the ZnFe1.65Ru0.35O4 catalyst and a possible pathway for HMF conversion into DFF over ZnFe1.65Ru0.35O4 was also proposed (Fig. 6). During the oxidation of HMF, a Ru–alkoxide intermediate was first formed, and then produced DFF through a β-hydride elimination. Carlini et al.56 used biphasic water/MIBK (methyl isobutyl ketone) systems or pure organic solvent for DFF generation over various heterogeneous catalysts. 10% conversion and DFF selectivity of 60–100% were achieved using water–MIBK biphasic solvents. Higher conversion, over 98%, was observed using only MIBK solvent but the selectivity of DFF decreased to 50%. Optimum catalytic activity with 84% conversion and 97% selectivity was shown using DMF as a solvent. Amarasekara et al.57 exploited NaClO as an oxidant to generate DFF from HMF at room temperature over Mn(III)–salen catalysts. MnO2 was also used for the synthesis of DFF from HMF in good yield.58

Recently, some researchers reported that Pt-based catalysts could promote HMF oxidation in the presence of air or O2.44 It has been reported that the use of metal oxides with different acid–base properties as supports is a good strategy for the regulation of the selective oxidation of HMF to DFF.59 Pt/SiO2 catalyst in neutral solution and Pt–ZrO2 in acidic solution could efficiently oxidize HMF to DFF with high yield under aerobic conditions.60 Taarning et al.61 reported that the oxidation of HMF over Au/TiO2 catalyst in MeOH could produce dimethyl furan-2,5-dicarboxylate (DFD) in excellent yield at 130 °C under basic conditions. Skowronski et al.62 proposed that DFF could also be obtained through the electrochemical oxidation of HMF using biphasic H2O–CH2Cl2 solvent in a divided cell equipped with a Pt anode. The type of electrolyte could greatly affect the yield of DFF, where Na2HPO4 as an electrolyte could generate an optimum DFF yield of 68%. Grushin et al.55 produced DFF in 63% yield in acetic acid solution over Co/Mn/Br catalyst at 75 °C in the presence of 70 bar air. Halliday et al. reported the aerobic oxidation of HMF to DFF in a yield of 45% over ion exchange resins.63 A fixed-bed reactor was also used for large scale DFF generation. Lilga et al.58 reported that Pt/SiO2 could efficiently produce DFF from HMF in a fixed-bed reactor under base-free conditions. About 70% selectivity of DFF with an HMF conversion of 60% were achieved at 150 psi air at 100 °C. It is worth noting that enhancing the LHSV (liquid hourly space velocity) could improve the selectivity of DFF and decease HMF conversion. Cu-based catalysts could also convert HMF into DFF in a continuous fixed-bed reactor under air atmosphere.64 Among these catalysts, Cu/SiO2 gave the highest DFF selectivity of 79.2% with more than 52.5% conversion of HMF. Table 1 lists some other catalysts for DFF formation from HMF.

In brief, some factors such as the type of catalyst, solvent, oxidant, and reaction pressure have been studied for DFF production. High O2 pressure and organic solvent could both achieve a high yield of DFF. Future studies will focus on the preparation of novel catalysts using air as an oxidant under ambient conditions to highly selectively generate DFF from HMF with low cost.


2.1.3 Selective oxidation of HMF to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA). 
HMFCA can be obtained from HMF over Ag-based catalysts under basic conditions.77,78 Gorbanev et al.79 revealed that HMFCA as an intermediate was formed during the aerobic oxidation of HMF over Au/TiO2 catalyst under basic conditions at room temperature. They studied the effects of base concentration and O2 pressure on HMFCA selectivity, and revealed that low pressure or low base concentration was beneficial for the generation of HMFCA. Casanova et al.80 also reported the production of HMFCA over an Au-based catalyst during the aerobic oxidation of HMF. 100% yield of HMFCA could be achieved at room temperature for 4 h. Recently, Davis et al.43 described 92–93% yield of HMFCA over Au/C and Au/TiO2 catalysts in a basic solution. Zhao et al.78 achieved 98% yield of HMFCA over Ag2O with H2O2 and a plausible mechanism for HMFCA formation from HMF is proposed in Fig. 7. Silver(I) could oxidize the carbonyl group of HMF to form an aldehyde cation radical and then the OH− anion (a nucleophilic species) attacks the obtained cation radical and undergoes a hydrogen shift to produce a diol intermediate. Dehydrogenation of the obtained diol was observed in the presence of OH− anion, followed by an electron shift, leading to the generation of a carboxylic acid. In addition, Len et al.81 also studied the energy states of the intermediates for the oxidation of HMF to HMFCA over Ag2O catalyst and proposed possible reaction pathways via comparing three different mechanistic routes by using DFT calculations. The results of the theoretical analysis showed that HMF might first lost an electron to form an intermediate and the formed carbocation was linked to a hydroxide ion (OH−). The C radical was then formed by breaking the C–H bond and transfer of the H radical to the radical oxygen. Then, HMFCA was produced by the sequential elimination of a proton (H+) and radical electron. Some catalytic systems have also been designed for the generation of HMFCA, as summarized in Table 2. Overall, basic conditions play an important role in the production HMFCA from HMF. Noble metal-based catalysts (Ag, Pd, Au etc.) have proved to be advantageous and effective in HMFCA formation. Moreover, some microbial cells, as catalysts, were exploited in HMF conversion to HMFCA under neutral conditions. Future studies will focus on the preparation of non-noble metal-based catalysts for HMFCA formation under base-free conditions.

2.1.4 Oxidation of HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). 
As an important diacid, FDCA is as a potential biorenewable candidate for preparing terephthalic acid to form biomass-based polymers, because FDCA has similar functional groups to terephthalic acid, which has been extensively exploited as a monomer in the production of some ester polymers (polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT)). Besides, FDCA is considered to be a promising building block for polymer synthesis in the future because of its environmentally friendly properties.94,95 Limited success has been realized in producing FDCA from fructose/glucose through direct synthesis.96
Vinke et al.97 prepared FDCA in excellent yield over Pt/Al2O3 in the presence of a base at 60 °C. Co/Mn/Br/Zr catalyst was also exploited for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to obtain FDCA in 61% yield.55 It has been proved that increasing catalyst concentration and reaction temperature could improve the yield of FDCA, but Zr doping of the Co/Mn/Br catalyst had no effect on the yield. Lew98 patented an oxidation method using a Pt/C catalyst in the presence of a base under 1 bar of O2 to produce FDCA in a high yield of 95%. Lilga et al.58 obtained FDCA in 98% yield through the aerobic oxidation of HMF over Pt–ZrO2 catalyst. Casanova et al.80 studied the effect of supports for Au-based catalysts on the yield of FDCA in basic solutions. The intermediate HMFCA could be generated during FDCA production from HMF, and it is very important for FDCA formation to further oxidize the obtained intermediate. A heterogeneous Au/TiO2 nanoparticle catalyst exhibited high performance (FDCA yield >99%) for HMF oxidation. The influence of base concentration and oxygen pressure on the yield of FDCA was also investigated. Nearly quantitative yield of FDCA was achieved under 10 bar O2 at 130 °C with a molar ratio of 4:1 NaOH to HMF. It was observed that a two-step reaction was adopted to inhibit FDCA degradation and improve the stability of the catalyst. The effect of the pH of the reaction system on FDCA synthesis over Pt-based catalysts was also examined by Lilga et al.58 An excellent yield of FDCA could be obtained over Pt/C and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts or using Na2CO3 as a base in the presence of air or O2, and Pt–ZrO2 catalyst led to 85% yield of FDCA under acidic conditions through the aerobic oxidation of HMF. Recently, Davis et al.99 found that Pt, Pd and Au catalysts could promote the aerobic oxidation of HMF to yield FDCA from a high pH solution.
Compared with Au/C and Au/Ti2O, Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity towards FDCA in 79% and 71% yield, respectively. 80% yield of FDCA could be achieved over Au catalysts under a high pressure of O2 and basic conditions for 24 h. Furthermore, Bao et al.100 prepared holey 2D Mn2O3 nanoflakes for the production of FDCA from HMF in excellent yield. A possible reaction pathway for the formation of FDCA from HMF using holey Mn2O3 nanoflakes is proposed (Fig. 8). Firstly, the aldehyde groups in HMF were attacked by OH− anion to generate a geminal diol under basic conditions, followed by the production of HMFCA through oxidative dehydrogenation over the Mn4+O2− active sites. Then, a metal–alkoxide intermediate was generated via the absorption of the –OH group onto Mn4+, followed by β-hydrogen elimination to generate 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA). Finally, the aldehydic group of FFCA can be transformed into a carboxyl group and thus form FDCA. The adsorbed O2 could oxidize the obtained Mn3+ to generate Mn4+, recycling the Mn sites in the catalyst. It is worth noting that porous supported catalysts with an encapsulation effect,101 and the metal alloy synergistic effect102 could improve FDCA selectivity. Recent catalytic systems exploited for the generation of FDCA are summarized and compared in Table 3.

A fixed-bed reactor was also applied in FDCA production from HMF.103 Some Pt-based catalysts were adopted to form FDCA under continuous-flow conditions. Lilga et al.58 revealed that Pt/ZrO2 catalyst could completely convert HMF into FDCA with an ultrahigh selectivity of 98% within 3 h in a neutral feed solution in a bench-scale fixed-bed reactor. Furthermore, Pt/ZrO2 catalyst had excellent stability and maintained its catalytic activity during an experiment lasting 2 weeks. The operating temperature is 100 °C using air as an oxidant with a LHSV of 3 h−1 and GHSV of 300 h−1. Pt on resin-support (Pt@Dowex) was also used in a home-made continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor for the generation of FDCA.104 A high FDCA yield of 99% was achieved at 120 °C in the presence of O2. The space–time yield of FDCA was 46 L−1 h−1. The catalyst retained excellent stability over 5 days without deactivation. Recently, a micropacked-bed reactor was developed and exploited to efficiently and rapidly produce FDCA over Au/CeO2 catalyst in the presence of O2 at 90 °C.105 A high FDCA selectivity of 90% with complete conversion of HMF were obtained within 41 s, which is 1–2 orders of magnitude faster that of traditional reactors. This could be attributed to the enhanced gas–liquid mass transfer efficiency.
A techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the production of FDCA from HMF using Pt/ZrO2 catalyst was also studied by Triebl et al. in 2013.106 In this system, HMF contributed 54% of the cost to generate FDCA and the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst constituted the majority of the start-up cost. Moreover, changing the oxygen source from air to pure oxygen resulted in a drop in the FDCA price from 3157 $ per t to 2458 $ per t. If FDCA was separated from the reaction system, the FDCA price will be increased to 3885 $ per t. When starch, glucose and fructose were used as feedstocks, the FDCA costs could be decreased (1990–2040 $ per t).107 Motagamwala et al.108 reported that a high concentration (15 wt%) of fructose could be converted into FDCA in γ-valerolactone (GVL)/H2O solvent system over a Pt/C catalyst. Due to the elimination of corrosive acids from the process, economic and environmental issues were improved. Their techno-economic model revealed that the FDCA production process was more economical compared with the terephthalic acid processes.
In summary, FDCA generation from HMF under basic conditions is very important. Some novel metal alloy catalysts have been applied in the reaction and exhibit excellent catalytic activity with high yield. Ionic liquids have been applied as solvents for FDCA formation and could avoid the use of a base. Future work will focus on the development of non-noble mental catalysts or a basic support to improve the production of FDCA under ecofriendly conditions.
Although much progress has been made in HMF oxidation, there are still many challenges to be overcome in achieving large-scale applications. Catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability, low cost, and recyclability need to be designed. More importantly, the catalyst production process should be simple and environmentally friendly, which increases the potential for industrial applications. In addition, studies on HMF oxidation should also pay attention to continuous flow reaction conditions to meet conventional industrial production needs.

2.2 Hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis
The selective hydrogenation (addition of hydrogen to an unsaturated double bond) and/or hydrogenolysis (cleavage of a single bond upon reaction with hydrogen) of HMF can take place at the aldehyde group and furan rings, generating various value-added chemicals as depicted in Fig. 9. Products from the selective hydrogenation of HMF can be grouped into two main categories: one is promising biofuels with high energy densities and octane numbers including DMF and DMTHF. Reducing the O-content of HMF via hydrogenolysis is the major aim of biofuel production. Another category is diol precursors of polymer production, such as 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) and 2,5-dihydroxymethyl-tetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF). For the synthesis of diols (e.g., DHMTHF), the hydrogenation of CO/C–C bonds needs to be promoted while excess hydrogenolysis of hydroxymethyl should be suppressed. Among them, DMF is particularly attractive due to its higher energy density (31.5 MJ L−1) than bioethanol. Besides, DHMF and DHMTHF are identified as important bio-based monomers for the synthesis of polyurethanes and polyesters.
 Fig. 9  A number of chemicals generated from the selective hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis of HMF. 

2.2.1 Reduction of the furan ring and/or formyl group. 
2,5-Bis(hydroxymethyl)furan could be prepared via reducing the formyl group of HMF and is an important platform chemical for polymer and polyurethane foam production.126 Different types of catalysts have been designed for the selective hydrogenation of HMF as shown in Fig. 10. For example, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was used for the production of 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan in high yield from HMF.127 Also, Ni, PtO2, and CoO were found to be effective for this transformation.128
 Fig. 10  Selective hydrogenation of HMF with different types of catalysts. 
Through directly using NaBH4 as a reducing reagent, HMF can be transformed into DHMF quite conveniently and efficiently.127 Enzyme catalysis has also been reported as a good method for the synthesis of DHMF from HMF. In the process of ethanol production by industrial yeast fermentation, the presence of HMF will slow down the fermentation progress due to the toxic effect of HMF on microorganisms. On the other hand, Liu developed new ethanologenic yeast strains with a tolerance to HMF for reducing HMF to DHMF.129 Supported Ru, Pd, and Pt catalysts were reported by Dumesic et al. for DHMTHF production from HMF hydrogenation, and the effects of the metal, support, acidity, and solvent on the catalytic activity were investigated in detail. Among them, Ru supported on high isoelectric point materials showed the highest catalytic performance, reaching DHMTHF yields of 88–91%.19 Furthermore, inexpensive potassium-doped Cu/Al2O3 catalysts were exploited for the highly efficient selective hydrogenation of HMF to DHMF in a fixed-bed reactor.130 The introduction of K modified the acid–base properties of the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst and the size of Cu particles to improve its hydrogenation activity. 1.5K–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst gave the highest yield 98.9% of BHMF under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1.0 h−1 at 120 °C and 2 MPa of H2. Xiang et al.131 reported that fructose could be converted into DHMF in one step with a yield of 48.2% over HY and HT-Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 in a fixed-bed reactor at 140 °C in the presence of H2. For heterogeneous catalysts, neutral or basic supported catalysts could improve the selectivity of DHMF because of the reduction of the CC double bond in the furan ring of HMF. The strong interaction between active metal species and the furan ring of HMF could promote the selective formation of DHMTHF. Table 4 lists some catalysts for the formation of DHMF and DHMTHF from HMF. In brief, some hydrogen sources such as alcohols and hydrogen have been applied for the formation of DHMF or DHMTHF through HMF hydrogenation. When hydrogen was used as a hydrogen source, high pressure and high temperature were indispensable for HMF hydrogenation. Future studies may focus more on the preparation of an alloy catalyst or support to decrease the reaction temperature under ambient pressure for the generation of DHMF or DHMTHF in high yield.

2.2.2 Reduction of formyl and hydroxyl groups. 
2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF) has attracted much attention because that it has a high energy density (31.5 MJ L−1), low volatility (bp = 92–94 °C) and is insoluble in water.146,147 These excellent properties mean DMF has great potential as a biofuel. DMF can be synthesized by reducing the formyl and hydroxyl groups of HMF. Therefore, the development of highly active catalysts for HMF conversion into DMF is conducive to promoting the development of biomass energy. In the reaction path for converting HMF into DMF, further hydrogenation reaction may be carried out through the intermediates of 5-methylfurfural and/or 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran. Hydrogen cleavage of C–O bonds can lead to low activity C–H bonds to replace oxygen-containing functional groups; this is an efficient deoxygenation pathway. Therefore, it is necessary to crack the C–O bond in the HMF molecule for the synthesis of deoxygenated biomass derivatives. Immense attention has been paid to preparing hydrogenolysis catalysts, e.g., CuCrO4, Cu/C, Cu-Ru/C and alloy catalysts. The CuCrO4 catalyst was used to hydrolyze pure HMF in 1-butanol at 220 °C, achieving 61% yield of DMF and 29% yield of 2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylfurfural. The Cu–Ru/C catalyst also has good HMF hydrogenolysis activity and can be used to replace CuCrO4. 71% yield of DMF and 4% yield of 2-methylfuran were obtained by using 3:1 Cu–Ru/C.148 Subsequently, Binder et al. achieved 49% yield of DMF by the hydrogenolysis of HMF from corn stover with the CuRu/C catalyst.149 Chidambaram and Bell reported the hydrogenation of HMF by using carbon supported transition metals. They found that the Pd/C catalyst had the best catalytic activity, leading to 47% HMF conversion and 16% DMF yield.150 Thananatthanachon and Rauchfuss et al. used Pd/C to produce DMF from fructose in formic acid.151 Fructose was first dehydrated to HMF in formic acid, and then heated at reflux in a THF mixture containing formic acid, H2SO4 and Pd/C to obtain 95% yield of DMF in 15 h. As shown in Fig. 11, HMF was first converted into DHMF through catalysis by Pd/C and formic acid, and 2-hydroxymethyl-5-methylfuran (HMMF) was generated as an intermediate. Finally, DMF was obtained by using Pd/C. Kim et al.152 used DFT calculations to investigate reasonable reaction pathways for the formation of DMF from HMF on the Pd–Cu alloy catalyst. The results showed that DHMF, MF and 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol were the reaction intermediates. Pd–Cu alloy exhibited a low energy barrier for H2 adsorption and the overall reaction, which promoted the production of DMF. Ru-based catalysts and an acidic support could improve the selective formation of DMF. Furthermore, more catalysts have been employed for the generation of DMF, as summarized in Table 5.

In order to prepare DMF from HMF on a large scale, fixed-bed reactors should be adopted for the reaction. Li et al.153 used an Fe-based catalyst for DMF generation from HMF in batch and continuous flow fixed-bed reactors. A high DMF selectivity of 86.2% with complete conversion of HMF was achieved at 240 °C. The Fe-based catalyst showed excellent stability, which was attributed to well-preserved active species and the pore structure. Non-noble bimetallic catalysts were also developed for use in DMF generation in a fixed-bed reactor.154 An excellent DMF yield of over 95% was achieved under relatively mild conditions: 130 °C over the carbon supported Ni–Co bimetallic catalyst.155 The Ni–Co bimetallic catalyst exhibited excellent stability and the catalytic activity did not decrease during 71 h on stream. Other Ni–Cu bimetallic catalysts were also utilized for DMF production in a fixed-bed reactor.156 A DMF yield of 70% with complete conversion of HMF was obtained over Ni–Cu/ZnO2 after 25 h on stream in a continuous fixed-bed reactor. Furthermore, with fructose as a raw material, DMF was also obtained through hydrogenation over combined HY zeolite and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor.131 The techno-economic analysis of processes for the production of DMF from fructose was carried out based on published results.157 The processing capacities were 300 tons per day of fructose and the operation period was 20 years. Cu–Ru/C catalyst was used in the DMF process. The minimum selling price for DMF was estimated at $7630 per kg. The most significant parameters for the DMF price are feedstock cost, catalyst cost, equipment costs and product yields.
In short, noble metal-based catalysts show higher DMF yield compared with non-noble metal-based catalysts. An organic solvent as the reaction medium displays good catalytic activity for the generation of DMF from HMF hydrogenation. Future studies will investigate in depth the role of solvent and structural modification of non-noble metal-based catalysts for DMF generation under mild reaction conditions with high yield.

2.3 Aldol condensation
Aldol condensation is another effective method to extend a carbon chain that proceeds from a substrate having both an enolizable α-H atom and a carbonyl group with a basic or an acidic catalyst. In the furfural molecule, if the saturation of the furan ring is not achieved by selective hydrogenation, the enolizable α-H atom cannot be formed, which leads to the inability of furfural, including furfural (FF), methyl furfural (MF) and HMF, to undergo self-aldol condensation.172 In addition, organic compounds with an enolizable α-H, such as acetone, hydroxyacetone (HA), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), homoethyllevulinate and decane-2-one, can be coupled with furfural, and a new C–C bond is formed after the cross-aldol reaction (Fig. 12).
 Fig. 12  Typical aldol condensation of various aldehydes and ketones. In order: aldehydes (a, HMF) and (A) straight ketones (b, acetone, 2-pentanone and 2-heptanone), (B) branched ketone (c, methyl isobutyl ketone), (C) cyclic ketones (d, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone and isophorone) and (D) chain ketones. 
By further hydrodeoxygenation, high-quality long-chain paraffinic fuels can be obtained. Alkanes (C9, C12, and C15) can be synthesized from HMF by aldol condensation with acetone followed by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (Fig. 13). These chain lengths are in the diesel carbon range and could be used directly in current automobile engines. However, this technology requires hydrogen, and unless H2 can be produced sustainably on a large scale this process may not be practical.
 Fig. 13  Aldol condensation with acetone followed by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis. 
Especially in alkaline medium, the catalytic effect of the catalyst on the cross-aldol condensation reaction can be promoted. Dumesic172 conducted research on aldol condensation using Mg–Zr-oxide in the aqueous phase, and realized the extension of the carbon chain of acetone. The results of this study did not reflect obvious selectivity, but showed that both self-aldol condensation and cross-aldol condensation occurred. In addition, this method cannot achieve the same type of effect on substances other than acetone, such as hexaenoic acid (HA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and glyceraldehyde. In Huber's complementary work,173 it was found that FF and acetone were cross-coupled in a 2:1 molar ratio under the catalysis of NaOH, achieving 97% overall yield of mono- and di-FFs. However, in the presence of only FF + HA (or DHA), coupling does not occur due to the formation of alkoxide anions. But this problem can be solved by adding 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), a neutral organic base catalyst, and a high-yield FF + HA (or DHA) cross-aldol condensation reaction product is obtained in the system. For the reaction mechanism shown, DBU first deprotonates methylene hydrogens in HA that are more acidic than methyl protons, resulting in enolates that can be stabilized through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding between protonated DBU and the aldehyde activates FF and facilitates nucleophilic attack of the aldehyde.
The cross-aldol condensation of furaldehydes and enolizable ketones can also be catalyzed by other types of organics. Under the catalysis of 5 mol% piperidine, after 20 h at room temperature, HMF and acetone in a molar ratio of 1:1 were cross-coupled to form a mixture of mono- and di-HMF products (Route 1 in Fig. 14). Adjusting the acetone content to 0.5 equiv. resulted in 73% yield of di-HMF. In addition, pyrrolidine and acetic acid can simultaneously catalyze cross-aldol condensation with high efficiency and better selectivity (Route 3 in Fig. 14). Studies have shown that after 12 h at room temperature, HMF was subjected to cross-aldol condensation with homoethyl levulinate and decan-2-one, respectively, and the yields of the products isolated were 93% and 70%.
 Fig. 14  Cross-aldol condensation of furaldehydes with enolizable ketones. 
A number of studies in the literature have reported high-yield aldol condensation on the aldehyde moiety of HMF. Dumesic studied the aldol condensation of HMF and acetone using biphasic THF/salt solutions as media and NaOH as a base catalyst. Studies have shown that when the equivalent ratio of HMF to acetone is 2:1, a higher yield of double aldol condensation products can be obtained.174 This product is considered a precursor to biodiesel because of its ability to produce C13 hydrocarbons when fully hydrogenolyzed. If the content of acetone in the system is increased to excess, the yield of a single aldol adduct will be improved. In Shantz's study, a solid secondary amine basic catalyst was used to investigate the aldol condensation of HMF and acetone in acetone solution. The results show that only a very slow reaction can proceed at 40 °C.
Dumesic et al. explored a new synthesis method for C9, C12 and C15 alkanes. The raw materials were HMF and acetone, and the route was two-step condensation/hydrogenation and dehydration.175 When the feeding ratio of HMF and acetone is 1:1, a C9 species is obtained by aldol condensation, and C9 alkanes are further generated by hydrogenation/dehydration. When the feeding ratio of HMF to acetone reaches 2:1, HMF will undergo a self-condensation reaction to produce longer carbon chains (C12 and C15 alkanes). While high yields of HMF from lignocellulosic feedstocks and hydrogen will be the economic determinant of this new route to alkane synthesis, this approach opens a new alternative to liquid alkane production where the feedstock is no longer defined as cellulose-derived glucose. The upgrading of HMF to alkanes by base-catalyzed aldol condensation has been extended to biphasic systems and solid bases. Dumesic et al.174 reported the study of a biphasic system that enabled continuous extraction of aldol condensation products from the aqueous phase to prevent further degradation. Shen et al.176 studied the aldol condensation of furfural and acetone catalyzed by several solid bases (MgO–ZrO2, NaY and nitrogen-substituted NaY). The results show that MgO–ZrO2 can achieve almost 100% selectivity at moderate conversion (about 50%) and is the most selective functional catalyst. In the work of Corma et al.177 and Yang et al.,178 a similar method of aldol condensation was used to obtain diesel fraction liquid alkanes from HMF or furfural. In conclusion, HMF has demonstrated its value as a multi-purpose platform compound from various aspects, and is of great significance in upgrading and conversion into various fuels and other high-value chemicals through aldol condensation.
2.4 Rehydration

2.4.1 Mechanism. 
In 1931, Teunissen conducted the first study on the kinetics of the dehydration of HMF (0.08 M) to formic acid (FA) and levulinic acid (LA) in 0.1–0.5 N acid under a protective atmosphere.180 Modelled with a first order approach, experimental data suggested a strong correlation between reaction rate and acid catalyst, among which oxalic acid gave the lowest reaction rate and hydroiodic acid the highest. Horvat's mechanism for HMF decomposition in the presence of acid is one of the most famous as shown in Fig. 15.179 During the rehydration of HMF, the side reaction to humins also easily occurs. Mckibbins et al.181 studied the first order kinetic model for the rehydration of HMF to LA at 160–220 °C in 0.025–0.4 N acid, and calculated that the activation energy of the reaction was 96.8 kJ mol−1. Baugh et al.182 catalyzed the decomposition of HMF with a mixture of butyric acid and phosphoric acid at 170–230 °C and pH values in the range of 1–4. Experimental data were modelled using a pseudo first order kinetic model and the activation energy of the reaction was calculated to be 55.9 kJ mol−1. Asghari et al.183 studied the decomposition of HMF catalyzed by HCl in subcritical water in a continuous tubular reactor at 210–270 °C, 4 MPa and initial pH of 1.8. They also found that the side reaction to humins would occur. By fitting a pseudo first order model, the activation energies of the main reaction to LA/FA and side reaction were calculated to be 94.1 kJ mol−1 and 121.5 kJ mol−1, respectively.

Luijkx et al.184 studied the non-catalytic conversion of HMF in sub-critical water. The experiments were conducted in a tubular flow reactor at 290–400 °C, 27.5 MPa, and residence time of 1–15 min. The results showed that the selectivity of 1,2,4-benzenetriol reached 46% when 50% HMF was decomposed. The activation energy was calculated to be 47.7 kJ mol−1 in the temperature range from 290 °C to 350 °C by using the pseudo first order kinetic model. Chuntanapum et al.185 studied the thermal decomposition of HMF in subcritical and supercritical water. The experiments were carried out in a continuous flow reactor at 175–450 °C, 25 MPa and 80–400 s. HMF would be broken down into liquid intermediates and then into gases such as CO2, CO and H2. In an analysis with a first-order serial reaction, the decomposition of HMF had Arrhenius characteristics and the activation energy was calculated to be 75.8 kJ mol−1.


2.4.2 Levulinic acid (LA). 
As an important platform compound, LA is widely used in the production of methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), GVL and other value-added chemicals due to its keto and carboxyl bifunctional groups (Fig. 16).186,187 Selective hydrogenation of LA to produce GVL over various catalysts is depicted in Table 6. Some homogeneous catalysts (Ru(acac)3, RuCl2(PPh3)) have been used for GVL formation from LA and exhibit excellent catalytic activity. Some heterogeneous catalysts (Ni-based metal oxides) also display a good GVL yield but at high temperature (above 220 °C). Future work will develop novel Ni-based catalysts on different supports for the selective hydrogenation of LA with good GVL yields under mild reaction conditions.

2.4.3 GVL. 
GVL is an important class of platform compound that has received extensive attention from researchers in the past few decades. Because of its unique physical and chemical properties and fuel properties, it is of great significance in chemical production. GVL is usually produced from lignocellulose, but also from C6 and C5 sugars. GVL has a high boiling point, low vapor pressure, excellent stability, and low toxicity, and can be used as a green solvent, especially for lignin for which it has good solubility. As a platform compound, GVL can be used to synthesize gasoline and diesel fuels (e.g., C8–C18 alkanes and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF)) and high-value chemicals (e.g., 1,4-pentanediol, methylpentanoic acid, ionic liquids) as shown in Fig. 17.52 Over the last a few decades, several researchers have developed different advanced methods for improving the synthesis of GVL from lignocellulosic biomass.196,197 In addition, GVL is also used as a gelling agent for lubricants, plasticizers and non-ionic surfactants.198

2.5 Amination
The reductive amination of HMF generally goes through two steps. The lone electron pair on the N atom of ammonia first attacks the aldehyde C in HMF, leading to a nucleophilic addition reaction, and then removes water molecules to form imine intermediates. The imine intermediate is hydrogenated and then reduced to form the HMF amination product under the action of the active sites of the catalyst. The generated 5-aminomethyl-2-furan methanol (AMF) can continue to react with HMF to produce the corresponding secondary amine, and AMF is more nucleophilic than ammonia and reacts more easily with HMF. Therefore, the side reaction between AMF and HMF will inevitably occur in the reaction system. Among them, the conversion of imine to amine is the main factor limiting the speed of the amination process. The reason why aldehydes and ketones are more active is that they contain double bonds, which react more easily with ammonia to form imines, which are then reduced by hydrogen to yield primary amines. However, usually the imine formed from a carbonyl and ammonia is not stable. On the contrary, it can continue to react with raw materials to produce a Schiff base, and then undergo hydrogenation to produce a secondary amine. Karve and coworkers developed a green and sustainable method for synthesizing metal–organic framework (MOF)/polymer composites in which metal nanoparticles were well dispersed. Pd was loaded on MOF/polymer composites and then used for the reductive amination of HMF under mild conditions, as compared in Table 7.199

In the presence of H2(g) in ethanol solvent, Xu and coworkers reported that dichlorobis Ru(DMP)2Cl2 complex could efficiently directly catalyze the reductive amination of biologically derived 5-HMF.200 Cukalovic and Stevens201 recently developed a method for synthesizing numerous 5-aminomethyl-2-furfuryl alcohols from HMF and aromatic or aliphatic primary amines in high yields. In situ reduction of the originally generated aldimines with NaBH4 was used to carry out the reaction. As a reaction medium, water and alcohols such as methanol and ethanol were utilized, coupled with traditional and microwave heating, which resulted in a quicker reaction rate than that at ambient temperature.
Yuan et al.202 used a two-stage reaction process to highly selectively synthesize biomass derived 2,5-bis(aminomethyl) furan by directly aminating 5-HMF with NH3 using a bifunctional catalyst. By adjusting the molar ratio of copper to nickel, copper showed high catalytic activity in the direct amination of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to prepare 2,5-bis(aminomethyl) furan in a yield of 85.9%. Komanoya203 proposed a step-by-step reductive amination approach, on Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst, by first carrying out the CO reductive amination reaction on HMF to obtain 5-hydroxymethylfurfurfuramine, and then generate 2,5-bis(aminomethyl)furan (BAMF) through the amination reaction of C–OH on a homogeneous Ru complex catalyst. Wei and coworkers studied the carboxy reductive amination of HMF, in which HMF could be efficiently converted into 5-hydroxymethylfurfurylamine (HMFA) with a RANEY® cobalt catalyst in a yield of up to 99.5%. BAMF can be synthesized from HMF at 160 °C in a yield of 82.3% under the action of RANEY® nickel catalyst.204
Zhu et al. developed a new method for the reductive amination of HMF using Au/TiO2 catalyst, H2O and CO as reductants. The approach could efficiently transform HMF under mild conditions to yield a series of amino alkyl furans, which play an important role in medicine and materials chemistry.205 Rafael et al. synthesized δ-lactone cyclopentene-2-ketone using HMF. Through activation of furfural and esterification of Meldrum acid, successive furan ring-opening–cyclization–esterification processes with secondary amines were developed.206 Zhang et al. used α-MnO2 as a catalyst to efficiently convert HMF into 2,5-bis(N-methyl-iminomethyl)furan (BMIF) under an air atmosphere, and then catalyzed the reduction of BMIF on Ru/C to obtain 2,5-bis(N-methyl-aminomethyl)furan (BMAF) in a yield of 96.1%.207 Pingen and coworkers converted HMF through a one-pot method for direct amination and reductive amination with ammonia to selectivity produce BAMF.208
2.6 Polymerization
Polymer synthesis using HMF as a monomeric precursor is one of the most well-known industrial processes and HMF has also been used for the total synthesis of furan-based natural products.20,210 Linear poly(silyl ether)s from HMF and dihydrosilanes in the presence of B(C6F5)3 and the heteroscorpionate zinc hydride complex LZnH were also successfully afforded, as shown in Fig. 18.209 The first step is the aldehyde hydrosilylation of HMF, and the subsequent dehydro-coupling reaction of the OH group determines the reaction rate. In the process, LZnH was activated by B(C6F5)3via extending the bond of Zn–H. At the same time, HMF would coordinate with the zinc cation in a limited configuration through aldehyde or hydroxyl groups, due to the induction of steric hindrance provided by the heteroscopionate ligand. Therefore, the formyl carbon atoms or hydroxyl proton would be rapidly attacked by the B(C6F5)3-H− anion generated in situ, which effectively avoided B(C6F5)3-activated silane species to mediate ring opening of the furan. Some articles have focused on the photochemical behaviour of HMF and its derivatives.211,212 Among them, FDCA is another DOE “Top 10” chemical, and can replace terephthalic acid to produce PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) analogues, both of which are currently obtained from xylene and represent a market size of 5 billion pounds per year.213,214 DMF, can serve as both a fuel215 and an intermediate for the production of biobased p-xylene (terephthalic acid precursor).216Fig. 19 shows a scheme for synthesis pathway to PET from biomass-based p-xylene and ethylene glycol.

Besides, FDCA and its derivatives are useful for preparing other polymers or resins,218 including polyamides,219 thermotropic polyesters,220 photodegraded polyesters,221 linear and cross-linked poly(ester amide),222 and poly(ester urethanes).223 For example, polyamides prepared by Mitiakoudis and Gandini from FDCA and aromatic diamine have a regular structure, high molecular weight and good thermal stability.224 The structures of a series of aromatic furan polyamides synthesized by direct polycondensation of FDCA and various aromatic diamines by Zhu and coworkers were amorphous. Otherwise, it was found that the polymer structure had an effect on the thermal and mechanical properties of the material.225 For a DFF-based polymer, DFF and aromatic diamines were condensed to obtain DFF-based porous organic frameworks (DPOF). TGA analysis determined the thermal stability of the polymer under a nitrogen atmosphere, up to 300 °C. The crystal and porous morphology of the polymers were affected by the geometry of the monomers. The results showed that the DPOF contained micropores and mesopores. The porous structure came from the limited space-efficient packing of polymers in the solid state due to the rigidity and contortion of the molecular structure. The specific surface area and pore volume of DPOF prepared from DFF and m-phenylenediamine (DFP) were 830 m2 g−1 and 2.10 cm3 g−1, respectively.226
HMF can also be used as a raw material to produce novel biomass-based vinyl polymers. As shown in Fig. 20, in a solid–liquid phase transfer process, HMF or its methylated derivative MMF could efficiently prepare its vinyl derivative227,228 through a Wittig reaction, followed by polymerization of bulk free radicals. Especially the MMF derived polymers showed good thermal stability.

2.7 Etherification
Recently, 5-(ethoxymethyl) furfural (EMF), a diesel fuel additive, can be produced through HMF etherification with ethanol.229 EMF as a fuel additive has promising properties: it has a high energy density,230 its production does not require hydrogenation, and its presence in the blend in a diesel engine has decreased fine particulate and SOx emissions.231 In addition, EMF has low toxicity issues since it has been exploited as a flavoring medium in the drinks industry.232 Ethyl levulinate (EL) is often produced during EMF synthesis as a byproduct. EL also can be used as a diesel oil addition agent.233
Different acid catalysts can efficiently convert HMF into EMF in good yield.39,234,235 Considering that the production of HMF from fructose is also conducted in the presence of acid catalysts, different research groups have studied the one-pot generation of EMF from fructose. For instance, Brown et al.236 used fructose as the feed with an ion-exchange resin as an acid catalyst to produce EMF, but the selectivity was low. Maneechakr et al. used green SO3H-CD carbon to produce EMF with 74% yield in mild conditions.237 Tang and co-workers238 conducted fructose transformation into EMF using a phosophotungstic acid catalyst; moreover, a cellulose-based sulfuric acid catalyst was exploited239 to produce EMF from fructose. Zhang et al.232 studied the performance of different solid and mineral acid catalysts along with the role of other parameters on the transformation of fructose or HMF into EMF, and proposed a possible reaction pathway. Kraus and Guney240 also prepared EMF from fructose in an acid functionalized ionic liquid. Although these groups have reported promising results, to make the EMF production process economically feasible, glucose should be used as the feed, since glucose is the most abundant C6 sugar produced via depolymerization of biomass carbohydrates with a much lower price compared to fructose. In this regard, some efforts have been made to generate EMF directly from glucose. Abu-Omar's group241 used glucose to produce EMF at high temperature (>130 °C) with AlCl3. Liu et al.242 conducted the same reaction under different conditions: a lower temperature (100 °C) and longer reaction time. Unfortunately, the reported EMF yields are low, less than 40 mol%. Riisager and co-workers243 used a sulfonic acid functionalized ionic liquid; however, glucose was converted into ethyl D-glucopyranoside in the IL medium. A completely different approach to EMF production was suggested by Mascal et al.244–246 In the first step, they converted C6 sugars or cellulose directly into 5-(chloromethyl) furfural (CMF). Then, in the presence of ethanol, the Cl atom of CMF was replaced by an ethoxy group to produce EMF and HCl. Despite high reported EMF yields, this method was not scaled up due to some concerns, such as the recyclability of the acid produced (HCl).247
A novel approach to synthesize EMF in high yield from biomass hydrolysate glucose was reported. This approach takes advantage of the previously described simultaneous-isomerization-and-reactive-extraction (SIRE) process followed by the back-extraction (BE) approach to transform glucose into concentrated fructose in an IL. Dehydration and etherification during the formation of EMF from HMF are conducted in the [EMIM]HSO4 medium in the presence of ethanol and an acid catalyst. Different reaction parameters have been investigated to establish optimum conditions.
It is observed that acid catalysts can convert HMF into the product dimeric ether.248 A yield as high as 44% of dimeric ether could be obtained using pTsOH.249 A similar result could also be achieved just using DMSO as a solvent without any acid catalyst, as shown in Fig. 21.250 Mou and co-workers reported that HMF reacted with ethyl chloroformate and sodium azide to form bisacylazide, which was applied in the production of polyurethanes.251 It was reported that HMF reacted with alcohols, such as methanol and ethylene glycol, to produce esters.170 HMF could react with dihydropyran to form tetrahydrofurfuryl ether in 72% yield by using pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate.252 Bell reported that HMF ethyl ether (81%) and ethyl levulinate (16%) were obtained during the reaction between HMF and EtOH using sulfuric acid as a catalyst. Etherification of furan dimethanol was also observed under similar reaction conditions.253 It is observed that some solid acid catalysts such as sulphated zirconia and mesoporous aluminasilicates could also catalyze the etherification reaction of HMF.254 Furthermore, a basic catalyst could also catalyze ether production from HMF. For example, silver salt promoted ether synthesis with a base or halogen scavenging agents.255
 Fig. 21  Pathway for the formation of dimeric ether from HMF. 
2.8 Catalytic decarbonylation of HMF
Catalytic decarbonylation of HMF has also been studied over different metal catalysts. The produced furfuryl alcohol (FOL) can be further upgraded to various fine chemicals.256 Leitner et al. reported that an Ir precursor plus triaryl- or trialkylphosphine ligands could effectively catalyze the decarbonylation of HMF to FOL.257 At low temperature (e.g., 110 °C), the conversion of HMF was less than 50% after 48 h in dioxane. When the reaction temperature increased to 220 °C, nearly full conversion was reached and the decomposition reaction mainly occurred. However, CO2-expanded dioxane would result in 99% conversion at 220 °C with close to 100% selectivity of FOL. Chatterjee et al. also found a high yield of FOL from HMF over Pd/Al2O3 in compressed CO2 as shown in Fig. 22.258 Furthermore, Mitra et al. studied the decarbonylation of HMF over Pd/C, whereas 95% FOL was formed in 20 h in dioxane at 120 °C.259 They found that decarbonylation reactions would be greatly affected by CO produced in the airtight reactor. Meng et al. investigated the product distribution over Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/C catalysts in 1,4-dioxane solvent.260 During the decarbonylation process, side reactions (e.g., hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation and etherification) also occurred.260 The hydroxymethyl group of HMF undergoes dehydrogenation; herein, the H2 produced would promote the hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis reactions. They also found that DMF and furfural could be formed by the elimination of the hydroxymethyl group of HMF through consecutive dehydrogenation and decarbonylation processes.

3. Conclusions and outlook
This review summarizes and compares the transformation of biomass-derived HMF through oxidation, hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, dehydration, aldol-condensation, amination, etherification, polymerization, and decarbonylation. The catalytic system and catalyst design are the deciding factors to achieve efficient conversion and selectivity for the desired products. Different types of catalysts for these transformations are summarized in tables and compared. Among those heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation, Au catalysts exhibited high oxidation activity for HMF, but faced easy deactivation in the presence of carboxylic acid groups of the oxidized product. For the hydrogenation reaction of HMF, Ru catalysts are the benchmark for the activation of the CO bond to form DMF. During the hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis of HMF, the acidic, basic, and neutral nature of the catalyst support also has a profound effect. The acidic property of the support would promote breaking of the C–O bond to influence the activity and product distribution. The basic property would enhance the oxidation rate and furan hydrogenation. Among various catalysts, nanostructured Pd catalysts prefer to hydrogenate CO and CC bonds as well as promote the hydrogenolysis of C–O bonds. Besides, Pd catalysts were also reported for furan ring opening and the decarbonylation of HMF (at high temperature); this was attributed to strong interactions between carbonyl C and the Pd surface. Ni catalysts also exhibited high performance for the hydrogenation of both CO and CC bonds of the furan ring. For amination and etherification, solvent effect is very important. Besides, protic solvents facilitate higher solubility of H2 gas compared to non-protic solvents, and hence, enhance the catalytic activity by increasing the interactions of H2 to the catalyst surface. Moreover, the morphology and dimensions of the catalyst also have a distinct effect on the catalytic performance. Whilst noble based catalysts displayed enhanced catalytic performance for HMF transformations, several non-noble metal (Fe, Ni, Co, and Cu) based heterogeneous catalysts have also been explored. Therefore, to meet global demand, Earth-abundant and less expensive metal-based catalytic systems are gaining tremendous scientific and industrial attention. Furthermore, studies revealed that various other reaction parameters, such as reaction temperature, pressure of gas used (H2, CO2 or O2), solvent nature (polar or non-polar), reductant (H2, formic acid or 2-propanol) or oxidant (like air, O2 or H2O2) had a substantial impact on the feasibility of diverse catalytic reactions.
Although significant progress has been achieved for the upgrading of HMF, some issues still remain: (1) The rational design of cost-effective high-performance catalysts with Earth abundance is highly desired. (2) One-step upgrading of HMF into the target products is highly desired, especially for a process without separation and purification of reaction intermediates. (3) The functional roles of the active sites in the catalyst are not entirely clear. It is necessary to unambiguously clarify the possible origins of different types of active sites both experimentally and theoretically, especially the effect of the appropriate ratio of different active sites on the activity or selectivity. (4) Theoretical calculations of materials, especially using DFT or simulation methods for transition metal based catalysts, can be helpful for estimating the adsorption and desorption capacity of the active site, free energy change of each catalytic step, etc., and also provide support for researchers in the screening of high-performance catalysts. (5) More efforts should focus on mechanistic insights and structure–activity relationships of the catalysts for selective upgrading. (6) Innovative protocols and in situ characterization techniques are on the rise, which may aid efforts to understand fundamental aspects of the transformation processes at the molecular level. For example, the photoelectrochemical oxidation of HMF may combine the advantages of photochemistry and electrochemistry to avoid the dependence on voltage for electrochemistry and an insufficient understanding of factors affecting the performance for photochemistry. Besides, in situ spectroscopy, such as in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy and sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, could thoroughly demonstrate the reaction pathway of HMF conversion to achieve the wider application of this reaction. The present review provides a survey of various fuels, fuel additives, commercial chemicals and potential chemicals obtained through the oxidation, hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, dehydration, aldol condensation, amination, etherification, polymerization, and decarbonylation of HMF. This review could be useful for the rational design of more efficient catalytic systems to selectively synthesize fine chemicals and fuels from biomass-derived compounds.
