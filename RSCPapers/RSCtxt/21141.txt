    , Accepted 8th August 2022First published on 10th August 2022AbstractOrganic phosphate nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, especially with the introduction of π-conjugated organic cations, have attracted attention due to their excellent performance and promising applications. Here, by combining the π-conjugated organic cationic 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine ((C6H9N2)+) with the inorganic moiety H2PO4−, a novel (C6H9N2)H2PO4 ((2-Ampy)H2PO4) crystal with a non-centrosymmetric structure has been grown by the slow evaporation method under the conditions of RT and ambient atmosphere. The data about the crystal structure, optical, thermal, photoluminescence and nonlinear optical properties were sufficiently studied. (2-Ampy)H2PO4 exhibits a high diffuse reflection with wide transparent range and appropriate thermal stability. Furthermore, an obvious photoluminescence characteristic was presented and displayed two emission peaks with positions at about 385 and 489 nm, while the average PL lifetime was 5.36 μs under the excitation of 300 nm. Importantly, SHG about 0.3× that of KDP is attributed to the hydrogen bond and π-conjugated cationic effects for (2-Ampy)H2PO4 crystal powder. By DFT calculations, the simulated band gap is about 3.84 eV, and the electronic states around the forbidden gap are largely determined by the combined effects of the (2-Ampy)+ and (H2PO4)− groups’ contribution to the optical features. All the above characteristics should be beneficial to the design and application of novel organic–inorganic hybrid phosphate NLO materials.
Introduction
In recent years, organic–inorganic hybrid multi-functional materials have drawn widespread attention originating from their excellent physical properties,1–4 such as optoelectronic, nonlinear optic, piezoelectric and ferroelectric performances.5–8 Particularly, nonlinear optical materials have become increasingly important along with the rapid development and application of laser technology.9,10 Importantly, nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals as a significant part of photo-electric functional materials have been widely used in the important fields of laser frequency conversion, electro-optic modulators, optical communication/storage, precision manufacturing and biological imaging.11–15 Due to the merits of ultraviolet communication, more novel NLO crystals are particularly urgently needed for the areas of safety detection (fire, atmospheric and energy), communication security and military technology.16–19
Currently, phosphate NLO crystals have got lots of attention and have become widespread, especially inorganic phosphate crystals such as KDP, KTP, LiCs2PO4, LiHgPO4 and K2ZnMoP2O10.20–24 However, the disadvantages of a relatively small microscopic second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility and low birefractive index have limited their applications in related fields. According to anionic group theory, π-conjugated anionic units, such as (CO3)2−, (BO3)3−, (NO3)−, possess desirable structural characteristics and have drawn widespread attention in exploring solar-blind NLO materials.25,26 In order to obtain a novel phosphate crystal, a similar strategy introducing π-conjugated cations with an amino group as the proton acceptor or donor27,28 is feasible and several excellent organic phosphate SHG crystals have been grown lately, such as (C5H6ON)(H2PO4), [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2·3H2O, [C(NH2)3]3PO4·2H2O and (C4H6N3)(H2PO3).29–32 From the results, it has been demonstrated that the existence of π-conjugated cations may generate a large second-order nonlinear susceptibility, high ultraviolet transmittance and appropriate optical anisotropy.33–35 A larger SHG response than for KDP crystals has been achieved for these organic–inorganic hybrid phosphate crystals; for instance, (C5H6ON)(H2PO4) and [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2·3H2O crystals have displayed SHG signals at 1064 nm about 3 and 3.8× that of KDP, respectively.29,30 In addition, π-conjugated cations replacing metal cations could be more beneficial to the UV cut-off edge.36,37 Hence, looking for new π-conjugated cations to combine with phosphoric acid contributes to exploring excellent nonlinear optical crystals.
Based on the above, the new π-conjugated cation 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine (2-Ampy), (C6H9N2)+, as the SHG active group has been discovered. Hence, we combine (C6H9N2)+ and H2PO4− groups to constitute (C6H9N2)H2PO4 with a non-centrosymmetric structure, and the colourless (2-Ampy)H2PO4 single crystal has been grown through the slow evaporation method under the conditions of room temperature (RT) and ambient atmosphere. In our work, the crystal structure, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, thermal properties, photoluminescence spectra and SHG properties were fully studied. The results have proved its thermal stability, obvious luminescence characteristics and SHG response. The above behaviors of the (2-Ampy)H2PO4 single crystal also show the multifunctional properties and provide guidance for further applications, particularly in the areas of photoelectric and frequency-doubled lasers.
Experimental
Synthesis
The reactants 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine (C6H8N2, 99%) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85%) were purchased from Aladdin and used without further purification. According to the stoichiometry, the reaction reagents of C6H8N2 (5 mmol) and H3PO4 were directly dissolved in deionized water (10 ml) in a 25 ml beaker on a magnetic stirrer, then placed in a dust-free environment. The single crystals of (2-Ampy)H2PO4 were grown by slow evaporation at room temperature (RT), and transparent single crystals with millimeter size were acquired after about one week.
Single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction
By selecting a high-quality single crystal of (2-Ampy)H2PO4, the single crystal structure data were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using a CCD detector with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å), while APEX3 software was applied for data integration at room temperature.38,39 Through Olex2 software,5 the structure was solved and refined by the Olex2.solve structure solution program and XL56 refinement package,29,40 respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the single crystal was measured with a Bruker-AXS D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer equipment with a Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54186 Å) radiation source operated at 40 kV/40 mA, and the measured data 2θ ranged from 5° to 60° at RT.
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 1050) equipped in the wavelength range from 190 to 1800 nm with a BaSO4 plate as the reference.
Thermal analyses
The thermogravimetric analyses including TGA and DSC were performed using a TGA/DSC1/1600HT analyzer (METTLER TOLEDO Instruments) over the temperature range of 25–800 °C. During the measuring process, the powder was placed in an Al2O3 crucible and heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 from RT to 800 °C in the atmosphere of nitrogen.
Photoluminescence spectra (PL)
The PL of (2-Ampy)H2PO4 single crystal was measured using an HORIBA Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a time-correlated single-photon counting system. Fluorescence lifetime was monitored at 300 nm excitation wavelength with an Edinburgh Instruments FLS-980.
Second harmonic generation (SHG)
Using the Kurtz–Perry method,41,42 the powder SHG responses were acquired using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm. The crystal samples of (2-Ampy)H2PO4 and KDP, as the reference, were ground and sieved into six distinct particle sizes of 38–55, 55–85, 85–105, 105–150, 150–200 and 200–250 μm. Then both the powder samples were pressed into a holder with two glass slides and a silica gel disk to measure the SHG signals.
Theoretical calculation descriptions
Based on the coordinates of the X-ray structure of (2-Ampy)H2PO4, the geometry optimization and the electronic structure calculations were carried out based on density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).43 The generalized gradient approximation in its Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof form (GGA-PBE)44 is used to describe the electron exchange and correlation potential with an energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis of 500 eV. The pseudopotentials were performed to simulate all constituent elements including C 2s22p2, H 1s1, N 2s22p3, O 2s22p4, P 3s23p3. Monkhorst–Pack k-points of 6 × 8 × 6 were used for sampling in the first Brillouin zone during geometry optimizations. All geometry structures are fully relaxed until energy and force are converged to 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively.

Fig. 1A is the overall crystal structure of the (2-Ampy)H2PO4 crystal viewed along the b axis, and an alternatively “intercalated” structure of (2-Ampy)+ cations and (H2PO4)− anions constitutes an integral system in the a–c plane. The results show that the arrangement stacked layer by layer along the a-axis is mainly interconnected through O–H⋯N and N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The layers of (PO4)3− tetrahedra are mainly constructed by the hydrogen bonding of different (H2PO4)− groups, while the layers of (2-Ampy)+ are formed by the hydrogen-bond interaction between (2-Ampy)+ and (H2PO4)− groups. This structural characteristic may be responsible for its nonlinear optical properties. As shown in Fig. 1B, the compound is mainly composed of the positively charged organic cation (2-Ampy)+ and the negatively charged inorganic anion (H2PO4)− by the hydrogen-bonding interaction. Via the interaction of hydrogen bonds, the groups of (H2PO4)− tetrahedra extend into a chain along the c-axis. The two (H2PO4)− tetrahedron chains are connecting with each other through the individual organic cations (2-Ampy)+ to form the layered structure (Fig. 1A), meanwhile the cationic groups of (2-Ampy)+ are fixed by the hydrogen bonds to construct a single layer. As seen from Fig. 1C, each (2-Ampy)+ organic cation connects to four (H2PO4)− anions and one (2-Ampy)+ ring by hydrogen bonds. For the hydrogen bonds, the N atom of the amino group (–NH2) mainly acts as the donor atom, while the heterocyclic N atom is the acceptor atom. Moreover, each (H2PO4)− anion links two (H2PO4)− anions and four (2-Ampy)+ rings as-shown in Fig. 1D. The O atom of hydroxyl (–OH) is the donor, and the O atom in the (H2PO4)− group is the acceptor atom. These hydrogen bonds (O3–H3A⋯O2, O1–H1⋯N1, N2–H2A⋯O4, N2–H2B⋯O4, N2–H2C⋯O2) vary from 2.546(3) Å to 2.771(3) Å, and the corresponding bond angles distribute from 144.9° to 173.9° (Table 2), meaning their bonding pressure is pretty high strength.

Phase purity and UV-vis-NIR optical property
To confirm the crystalline structure, the powder XRD pattern of the ground crystals (experimental) is shown in Fig. 2a which is in accordance with the single crystal XRD diffraction pattern (simulated), revealing the high phase purity of the as-grown (2-Ampy)H2PO4 crystal. The colorless and transparent single crystal of (2-Ampy)H2PO4 with millimeter size is shown in the inset photograph of Fig. 2b.

The UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum is shown in Fig. 2b, displaying a high diffuse reflection and a short cutoff edge wavelength about 284 nm. A wide transparent range is from 284 to 1000 nm for the (2-Ampy)H2PO4 single crystal. Using the Tauc method,5 the corresponding experimental optical band gap (Eg) is about 4.37 eV, as given in the inset of Fig. 2b. The relatively wide band gap also may exhibit a high laser damage threshold,30,45 and is beneficial to the application of the single crystal, especially for SHG devices.
Thermal property analysis

Fig. 3 shows the TG (red line) and DSC (blue line) curves. In the graphic, it is displayed that an endothermic peak is located at 195 °C in the DSC curve, and an obvious weight loss is observed to come on gradually in the simultaneous TG curve. This means that both melting and decomposition points are about 195 °C. In comparison to π-conjugated cation-containing phosphate crystals including 2APP (166 °C),31 GPO (100–190 °C)30 and 4HPP (180 °C),29 the introduction of the π-conjugated cation (2-Ampy)+ enhances the thermal stability. The weight loss in the range of 195–450 °C corresponds to the decomposition of (2-Ampy)+ and (H2PO4)− groups. It is worth mentioning that two small endothermic peaks are shown at around 450 to 500 °C. The weight loss in the range of 450–800 °C may be assigned to the decomposition of (PO4)3− groups.

Fluorescence analysis
For the ground powder from the (2-Ampy)H2PO4 crystal, the corresponding PL excitation (PLE) and PL spectrum at room temperature are shown in Fig. 4a. From the PL spectrum, it can be seen that the (2-Ampy)H2PO4 crystal exhibits two PL peaks at around 385 nm (purple light) and 489 nm (blue-green light) under the excitation wavelength of 300 nm, and the emission peaks are mainly attributed to σ–π*, π–π* and p–π* transitions.31,46 In particular, the emission centred at 385 nm is attributed to the groups of the (H2PO4)− tetrahedron, which is analogous to KDP and DKDP crystals.47 Nevertheless, another emission peak at 489 nm is mainly related to the organic cation (2-Ampy)+ due to no peaks for KDP or DKDP. Meanwhile, there is a broad PL emissions wavelength range from 325 nm to 650 nm, which may be associated with near-edge defect levels related to surface states. On the basis of the PL spectrum, Fig. 4b displays the color coordinates of the (2-Ampy)H2PO4 crystal, and the corresponding International Commission on Illumination (CIE) coordinates are about (0.173, 0.005) and (0.210, 0.285) which are located at around the violet and blue-green light regions, respectively.

For the emission, the time-resolved photoluminescence lifetime of the (2-Ampy)H2PO4 crystal is shown in Fig. 5. The PL decay curve has been fitted through the bi-exponential decay function; the corresponding faster and slower decay lifetimes (τ1 and τ2) are about 0.99 μs and 11.44 μs, respectively. The time τ1 is likely derived from the surface-site trap-assisted recombination, while τ2 may be attributable to the interior recombination of photo-excited electrons and holes. Furthermore, the average lifetime τavg = 5.36 μs is larger than that of the KDP crystal (about 4 ns)48 and has been calculated by the formula49 shown below:τavg = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)

SHG response
In view of the fact that the space group of the (2-Ampy)H2PO4 single crystal is Pca21 with a non-centrosymmetric structure, the power frequency doubling effect has been explored by the Kurtz–Perry method. The dependences of measurement signals on gain sizes with a range of 38–250 μm are displayed in Fig. 6 for (2-Ampy)H2PO4 and KDP crystal as a reference. From the results, the SHG efficiency for (2-Ampy)H2PO4 powder is about 0.3 times that of KDP, which may be mainly due to the interactions between the (2-Ampy)+ and (H2PO4)− groups containing hydrogen bond and π-conjugated cationic effects. Moreover, an obvious feature is that SHG responses gradually increase with the increase in the grain size, thereby demonstrating that (2-Ampy)H2PO4 is able to achieve phase matching when exposed to a 1064 nm laser.

Theoretical calculation analyses
The physical properties, particularly optical performances, are intimately associated with the electronic structure including the conduction band (CB), valence band (VB) and density of state (DOS). For better understanding of the relationships between electronic structure and properties, DFT has been performed for the calculation data and the corresponding results are displayed in Fig. 7. The electronic band structure in Fig. 7a reveals that (2-Ampy)H2PO4 has a direct band gap with a band gap value of about 3.84 eV, which basically coincides with the experimental result (4.37 eV). Meanwhile, the results of total and partial density of states (TDOS and PDOS) are shown in Fig. 7b. The PDOS data show that the VB ranging from −8 eV to −2.6 eV is mainly dominated by H_1s, C_2p, N_2p, O_2p and P_3p orbitals, while the valence band maximum (VBM) is exclusively occupied by H_1s, C_2p and N_2p of the (2-Ampy)+ cation together with O 2p of the (H2PO4)− anion. Furthermore, the conduction band minimum (CBM) is largely composed of C_2p and N_2p orbitals from the (2-Ampy)+ cation. The analysis above clarifies the compositions of the VBM and CBM for the band structure, which is intimately associated with the optical performance of a material. Hence, the electronic states near the forbidden gap are mainly influenced by the (2-Ampy)+ and (H2PO4)− groups, and this implies that the optical properties are mostly determined by the interactions of both parts.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel semi-organic phosphate NLO crystal, (2-Ampy)H2PO4, has been successfully grown by the slow evaporation method of aqueous solution in ambient air. Importantly, the π-conjugated cationic (C6H9N2)+ has proved to be a new SHG active unit. The alternating layered structure is determined by the interactions of strong hydrogen bonds between the (C6H9N2)+ and H2PO4− groups. The (2-Ampy)H2PO4 crystal exhibits a wide and high transmittance from the range of ultraviolet to near infrared. An obvious luminescence is observed, meanwhile two emission peaks at 385 and 489 nm are also displayed. Moreover, the SHG efficiency of the (2-Ampy)H2PO4 crystal is about 0.3 times that of KDP. The DFT calculations demonstrate that the interactions of the (2-Ampy)+ and (H2PO4)− groups affect the electronic states near the forbidden gap which is correlated with the optical properties of (2-Ampy)H2PO4. All results not only offer a new candidate for a new NLO crystal but also promote effective guidelines for the exploration of novel multifunctional materials including photoluminescence and nonlinear optics.
