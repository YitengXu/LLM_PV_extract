    , Accepted 20th May 2020First published on 20th May 2020AbstractA novel zwitterion named bethanechol chloride (BTCC) was introduced to simultaneously stabilize a Pb–I framework and passivate defects for efficient inverted perovskite solar cells. The BTCC-assisted device yielded an elevated power conversion efficiency of 20.45% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V.
In recent years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made remarkable progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE), with increases from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.2% in 2019.1,2 To progress towards commercial production of PSCs, solution-based processes can be utilized to prepare high-quality perovskite films, since the solution process is convenient and can be applied over a large area.3 However, recent studies have revealed that the solution-processed polycrystalline perovskite films have several orders of magnitude higher trap density than the single crystals, indicating high defect density at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) of the polycrystalline grains.4 These defects arise from low thermal stability or low formation energy of polycrystalline perovskite materials, which not only cause nonradiative charge-recombination losses both inside the perovskite bulk material and at the interfacial contacts, but also pose a major threat to the perovskite stability.5
To date, several additives have been developed to passivate defects for PSCs, such as polymers, nanoparticles, inorganic salts, MOF materials, graphene quantum dots, fullerene derivatives and so on.6–8 Concretely, Lewis base molecules, containing functional groups with nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), or sulfur (S) atoms, usually serve as electron donors to passivate positively charged under-coordinated Pb2+ defects.9 Fullerene and its derivatives are widely employed to not only serve as electron transporting materials, but also passivate under-coordinated halide defects or Pb–I antisite defects.10 Nevertheless, most of these molecules can only passivate one type of defect, either through coordination bonding or ionic bonding with charged defects. To address this issue, quaternary ammonium halides with zwitterionic structures, such as choline chloride and choline iodide, are exploited to simultaneously passivate positively and negatively charged defects.11 Recently, the application of the D-4-tert-butylphenylalanine (D4TBP) molecule, which contains carboxyl, amine, and 4-tert-butylphenyl functional groups, further highlights the importance of passivation for multiple types of defects.12
In this contribution, we adopted an alcohol-soluble zwitterionic molecule named bethanechol chloride (BTCC), which contains a quaternary ammonium cation and a chloride anion (Fig. 1a). Minute amounts of BTCC (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 wt%) mixed with organic salts (FAI, MABr and MACl) were dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) and spun-coated onto the PbI2 layer, resulting in BTCC-treated (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskite films (Fig. S1, ESI†). Our results showed that BTCC is potentially capable of stabilizing the Pb–I framework during film processing, together with the function of defect passivation. The champion device treated with 1% BTCC delivered the best PCE of 20.45% with a VOC as high as 1.14 V.

To analyse the electron density distribution in BTCC, we performed electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis using the density functional theory (DFT) method. As shown in Fig. 1b, the electron-deficient area (positive area) mainly distributes on the quaternary ammonium cation, allowing the quaternary ammonium cation to compensate for the loss of MA+. On the other hand, the chloride anion (Cl−) exhibits the highest electron density (negative area), which is expected to effectively passivate the halide anion (I−) vacancy defects. Meanwhile, the presence of an amino group (–NH2) tends to form hydrogen bonding with iodide ions (N–H⋯I).13,14 These findings support the notion that BTCC can not only stabilize the Pb–I framework of perovskite resulting in high-quality film fabrication and less defect formation, but also passivate the induced defects. The mechanisms of dual functions enabled by BTCC are shown in Fig. 1c and d. Unless stated otherwise, the following characterization are performed on the perovskite films treated with 1 wt% BTCC.
To investigate the interaction between BTCC and perovskite, we characterized pure BTCC and BTCC–PbI2 complex powder by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The peak of N–H stretch in the BTCC–PbI2 sample exhibits weakened vibration (Fig. 2a), which is owing to the hydrogen bonding between the amino group and I anions (N–H⋯I). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to detect the surface chemistry of perovskite films. For the BTCC-treated film, the increased quantities of O, C, and Cl elements confirm the presence of BTCC in the perovskite (Table S1, ESI†). Particularly, Fig. 2b shows the high-resolution spectra of Pb 4f within the full spectra. For the pristine film, in addition to the two main Pb 4f7/2 (138.3 eV) and Pb 4f5/2 (143.2 eV) peaks, two small shoulders on the lower binding energy side can be observed. These small peaks are attributed to the defects of under-coordinated Pb2+, which are caused by the evaporation of organic cations and halide anions and can be assigned to the metallic Pb cluster (Pb0).15 After the introduction of BTCC, these small peaks exhibit weakened intensity, confirming synergistic effects of BTCC molecules on restraining the loss of I− and passivating induced under-coordinated Pb2+ defects. The crystallinities of the perovskite films were explored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†). Compared with the pristine film, there is no additional diffraction peak for the BTCC-treated film, indicating that BTCC molecules are not embedded in the perovskite crystal lattice but possibly exist at the film surface and grain boundaries of perovskite.11 It is noteworthy that the PbI2 peak at 12.6° show higher intensity for the 10 wt% BTCC-treated perovskite film, since high concentration of BTCC will inhibit the reaction between organic salts and PbI2.16

Significant differences of perovskite films treated with various BTCC concentrations are presented in the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2c and Fig. S3, ESI†). First, the PL intensity is the strongest in the presence of 1% BTCC, demonstrating a superior passivation ability of 1% BTCC, while the PL intensity is remarkably quenched when the BTCC concentration reaches 4%. Second, the PL peak position was blue shifted from 781 nm to 777 nm after the introduction of 1% BTCC, which is also an indicator of good passivation with trap states.17 Next, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was carried out to illustrate the charge-recombination dynamics of perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 2d, PL decay curves are fitted to a biexponential rate law and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†).18 The pristine perovskite film shows an average PL lifetime of 33.69 ns, while the BTCC-treated film boosts the PL lifetime to 108.77 ns, suggesting that there is a lower defect density and less nonradiative recombination in BTCC-assisted films. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was utilized to build the corresponding energy-level diagrams of perovskite films (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). With the treatment of BTCC, the EVB shifts by 70 meV toward vacuum and EF shifts by a further 190 meV toward the conduction band minimum. This result indicates a more n-type nature of the BTCC-treated film, which can lead to a decrease in trap-assisted charge recombination.19,20
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were utilized to investigate the surface morphologies of the prepared perovskite films on PTAA-coated substrates. The top-view SEM images of (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x films with and without BTCC treatment are shown in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†). It can be observed with the additive of BTCC that the film has full coverage without pinholes and possesses more uniform grain size. This indicates that the BTCC molecules can bind to perovskite crystals and control perovskite grain growth.21 In addition, the water contact angles (CA) on top of the pristine and passivated perovskite films were 26.3° and 41.2°, respectively. The increased water CA is possibly due to the binding of BTCC with under-coordinated Pb2+ and reduced content of metallic Pb clusters on the perovskite surface. As shown in Fig. S6c and d (ESI†), the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the BTCC-treated film (10.5 nm) is smaller than that of the pristine film (12.4 nm). The smoother perovskite surface can contribute to the more uniform deposition of the C60 layer and thus facilitate the carrier extraction within the perovskite/C60 interface.22
To further investigate the influence of BTCC on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, we fabricated PSCs with a typical inverted structure (Fig. 3a). We first investigate the dependence of device performance on the BTCC concentration and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The significant increase of PCE is mainly attributed to the improvement of VOC, the average values of which are 1.04, 1.08, 1.13, 1.07, and 1.03 V for BTCC concentrations of 0–4 wt% (Fig. 3b). It is worth noting that when the BTCC concentration increases to 2 wt%, the PCE of devices begins to drop along with the decrease of VOC, current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), which is owing to the insulation induced by excess BTCC. As shown in Fig. 3c, an enhancement of PCE from 18.08% to 20.45% and a corresponding VOC increase from 1.05 V to 1.14 V are achieved for the BTCC-assisted devices. Furthermore, no obvious photocurrent hysteresis is observed for the champion device (Fig. S7, ESI†). The integrated JSC obtained from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices with and without BTCC (Fig. 3d) is calculated to be 22.15 mA cm−2 and 21.52 mA cm−2, which are consistent with the J–V results. The stabilized PCE of the champion BTCC-assisted device reaches 20.08% at a maximum power point (MPP), along with photocurrents of 20.50 mA cm−2 (MPP voltage = 0.98 V), which is also in agreement with the PCE recorded from the J–V measurements (Fig. S8, ESI†). Moreover, Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows that the PCE values of 25 devices are evenly distributed, indicating the reproducibility of the BTCC-assisted method. Furthermore, to highlight the passivation effect of BTCC on device performance, we compared the champion devices passivated by other typical zwitterions, which have been proved to passivate defects efficiently before, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. The champion PSCs passivated by choline chloride and choline iodide respectively exhibit a PCE of 19.79% and 19.11%, with a VOC of 1.11 V and 1.09 V. The difference mainly lies in the improvement of VOC with BTCC treatment. These results can be attributed to the additional function enabled by BTCC to stabilize the Pb–I framework, which can suppress the formation of defects during film fabrication. Besides, the incorporation of Cl has been reported to prolong the charge-recombination lifetime in perovskite.23,24

The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was also performed to evaluate the trap density of the device with and without BTCC treatment. Electron-only devices were prepared with a structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PC61BM/Ag to obtain dark current–voltage curves (Fig. 4a). At a low bias voltage, the current linearly increases with voltage. When the current increases with voltage nonlinearly, the kink point of the voltage is determined to be the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which can be used to calculate the trap density according to eqn (1):25 (1)where e is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the relative dielectric constant. The VTFL values of perovskite films prepared with and without BTCC are 0.97 V and 0.82 V, respectively. The corresponding electron trap densities are 2.29 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.94 × 1016 cm−3, respectively, indicating that trap states and charge-recombination can be efficiently suppressed by BTCC doping. The ideality factor (n) is based on the dependence of VOC with light intensity and is usually used to assess recombination mechanisms in PSCs (Fig. 4b). Previous studies suggested that n is related to trap-assisted recombination. n is calculated using eqn (2):26 (2)
 Fig. 4  (a) Dark current–voltage curves of electron-only devices with and without BTCC. (b) VOC as a function of light intensity from 10 to 100 mW cm−2. 
The n value of the device with BTCC is calculated to be 1.29 kT/q, while the n of the pristine device is 1.44 kT/q. This indicates that trap-assisted recombination can be efficiently reduced via BTCC treatment, which is in good agreement with the results of trap density measurements mentioned above.
Finally, we also detected the variations in PCE of the unencapsulated devices stored in ambient air with a relative humidity (RH) of 30–40% at room temperature (RT). As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the BTCC-assisted device retains approximately 82% of the initial efficiency after storage for 800 h, while the device without passivation only retains 61%. The results can be mainly attributed to the good hydrolytic stability of the BTCC-assisted perovskite film.
In summary, we introduced an alcohol-soluble zwitterionic molecule, BTCC, into the perovskite layer. Theoretical calculation and experimental studies confirmed that BTCC is capable of stabilizing the Pb–I framework through hydrogen bonding with iodide anions, together with the function of defect passivation owing to its zwitterionic structure. After the treatment of BTCC, the perovskite films exhibited reduced trap density, eliminated nonradiative charge-recombination, and prolonged carrier lifetime. Under these conditions, for the BTCC-assisted device, an elevated PCE of 20.45% was acquired with an improved VOC of 1.14 V. Moreover, the BTCC-treated perovskite film possessed enhanced moisture-resistance capability, resulting in improved long-term stability of PSCs.
