    , Accepted 12th June 2019First published on 13th June 2019AbstractWhile nonfullerene small-molecule solar cells (NF-SMSCs) have relatively inferior performance compared with nonfullerene polymer solar cells, their performance is improving. In this work, a weak crystalline molecular donor BSFTR, was designed and synthesized to achieve efficient NF-SMSCs. By blending with a strong crystalline acceptor NBDTP-Fout, BSFTR achieves a well-intermixed blending morphology, which favors the formation of efficient charge percolation pathways with suppressed recombination. The BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout device obtains a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 11.97% by achieving an efficient cathode interfacial layer (CIL)-free device that delivers an even higher PCE of 12.3%, which ranks among the top values for the reported NF-SMSCs. This work provides a simple solution for achieving high-performance NF-SMSCs by identifying the key factors for designing efficient, cost-saving, mass production-favorable CIL-free organic photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
In the decades following their development, tremendous achievements have been made in both the material design and device engineering of organic solar cells based on the nonfullerene acceptor (NF-OSCs).1–10 NF-OSCs continued to attract researchers' attention because of their advantages in synthetic variability, strong and controllable absorption, and less energy loss.11–16 Their classification depends on whether the constituent molecules are polymeric or not; thus, NF-OSCs are divided into polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs)17,18 and small-molecule solar cells (NF-SMSCs).19,20 Compared to polymers, small-molecule semiconductors suffer less from polydispersity, batch-to-batch variation, functionalization and purification difficulties, which are favored for large-area, roll-to-roll, or mass production. However, in contrast to the quick advance of NF-PSCs,21 NF-SMSCs lag because the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of NF-PSCs already exceeds 14%,22,23 while that for NF-SMSCs is still approximately 11%.24–26 Adverse factors, such as the lower viscosity of small molecules in solution state,27 aggravate the processing difficulty for such systems, which limits the achievement of efficient NF-SMSCs.
Among the methods for enhancing device performance, an effective strategy is the application of interfacial modification.28–30 Optimal interfacial condition not only reduces the resistance of devices, but also enhances the selectivity to charge carriers.31 However, the manipulation of interfacial materials may involve additional processing issues. For example, polar solvents such as methanol, ethanol, etc., are generally needed in processing interfacial materials.32–34 These polar solvents may decompose the blend morphology35 and cause device failure under extreme conditions. Due to the materials' low conductivity, delicate control over the thickness (usually <10 nm) of interfacial layers should be applied, which disfavors large-area production. In addition, adopting interfacial modification induces additional costs. According to an analysis of roll-to-roll device samples, the interfacial layers comprise approximately 5% of the total cost, as much as that for active layers.36 As a possible solution, fabricating solar cells without interfacial layers is attractive, as already reported for perovskite solar cell application. Kelly et al. fabricated the first compact layer-free bilayer perovskite solar cell achieving comparable PCE to that using a ZnO cathode interfacial layer (CIL).37 Zhang et al. noted that the high coverage of perovskite contributes to achieving efficient CIL-free devices.38 Recently, Hu et al. showed that the low electron-injection rate at the metal/active layer interface is a key reason limiting the performance of these devices, which can be remedied by improving the carrier lifetime.39 Despite this progress, efficient CIL-free devices were only achieved in perovskite solar cells with low exciton-binding energy and high charge-carrier mobility, which were considered to be two key prerequisites. Efficient CIL-free devices based on organic photovoltaic blends of relatively large exciton-binding energy and low charge-carrier mobility were rarely reported, and nor were detailed investigations conducted, despite their vital importance for both mechanism probes and developing real product.
Here, we demonstrate efficient CIL-free devices based on an all-small-molecule photovoltaic blend. Based on a small-molecular donor BDT3TR-SF26 reported previously, we synthesized a new molecular donor BSFTR for CIL-free device applications (Fig. 1). Compared with BDT3TR-SF, BSFTR is weakly crystalline, which induces a well-intermixed microstructure and contributes to high fill factor (FF). The device based on BSFTR donor and molecular acceptor NBDTP-Fout26 obtains a PCE of 11.97% when using a PDINO CIL. More interestingly, it obtains 12.26% by adopting a CIL-free device structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the peak value for binary single-junction NF-SMSCs. A combined analysis indicates that the favorable energy-level alignment at the active layer/Al-contacting interfaces and the formation of fine electrical contact at these interfaces were two key factors for achieving efficient CIL-free devices. This work provides the first demonstration of efficient CIL-free solar cells based on organic materials, which provide new perspectives for designing more-efficient, cost-saving, mass production-favorable solar cells.

2. Results and discussion
The new donor BSFTR was synthesized with synthetic details, as shown in Scheme 1 in the ESI.† Compounds 1 and 2 were reacted to achieve compound 3 as a red solid by still-coupling reaction in a yield of 50%. Afterwards, the Knoevenagel condensation reaction was executed between compounds 3 and 4. A metallic luster donor BSFTR was obtained in a yield of 90%. BSFTR dissolves well in common organic solvents, such as THF, CHCl3, CH2Cl2, toluene, and chlorobenzene. The target molecule was characterized in detail using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and mass spectrometry, which were summarized in the ESI.† Thermogravimetric analysis showed a decomposition temperature of 350 °C, which suggested the good thermal stability of BSFTR (Fig. S1†).
The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum was identified in solution and film states for BSFTR, BDT3TR-SF, and NBDTP-Fout, respectively. As shown in Fig. S2,† BSFTR redshifts were observed in both solution and film states compared with BDT3TR-SF. For BSFTR, the peak absorption appears at 516 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 1.8 × 105 M−1 cm−1. A 54 nm bathochromic shift with a shoulder peak appearing at 615 nm in its film absorption suggests an ordered package in a dense state. The optical bandgap was 1.83 eV, as calculated by the absorption edge of 685 nm, which displayed favorable complementary absorption with the NBDTP-Fout acceptor. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to explore the frontier orbital energy levels of BSFTR (Fig. S2 and Table S1†). The LUMO and HOMO energy levels were determined to be −3.19 eV and −5.28 eV, respectively, which were both similar to that of BNDT3TR-SF. The LUMO offset between BSFTR and NBDTP-Fout is approximately 0.8 eV, which guarantees a sufficient driving force for efficient exciton separation.
To investigate the effect of molecular donors on photovoltaic properties, bulk heterojunction solar cells with conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout/PDINO/Al were fabricated. With all photovoltaic blends processed in chloroform, the optimal performance of the device was achieved by varying the blending ratios of donor and acceptors, optimizing the solvent vapor annealing process as well as adjusting the thickness of active layers (Tables S2–S4†), which obtains a maximal PCE at 100 nm thick active layers in a blend ratio of 1:0.8 (w/w) with SVA treatment for 60 s. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves and relevant photovoltaic parameters of optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. For a brief comparison, devices based on BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout and BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blends were both fabricated using PDINO CIL. Comparatively, the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout device obtains a PCE of 11.97% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.796 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.00 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.32%, which was approximately 7% higher than that of the BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout device. The dramatic increase in FF accounts for the highest increase in PCE, which verified the effectiveness of crystallinity-tuning over molecular donor. Interestingly, the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout device delivers an even higher PCE of 12.26% with a Voc of 0.797 V, a Jsc of 21.69 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.71 when it adopts a CIL-free structure. This was the best of the NF-SMSCs according to our knowledge. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) shows that both all-small-molecule systems have broad photo responses in the range of 300–900 nm. The EQE values for the BSFTR-based device surpassed 70% in the range of 510–630 nm, and in the 700–810 nm range, the maximum value reached approximately 75%. The Jsc calculated from the EQE are 21.12 mA cm−2 for the BSFTR-based device, with an error <3% compared to that obtained by the J–V test.

The photocurrent (Jph) as a function of effective applied voltage (Veff) was examined to characterize the charge-extraction property.40Jph is given by Jlight–Jdark where Jlight and Jdark are current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff was defined as V0–Vapp, where V0 is the voltage under the Jph = 0 and Vapp is the applied voltage. The results were shown in Fig. 2c. Comparatively, the characteristic photocurrent reaches a saturation more rapidly for BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout than the BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout blend. Meanwhile, the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blend is less field-dependent at high Veff. Moreover, the exaction dissociation probability P(E,T) was calculated, defined as Jsc/Jsat. The BSFTR-based device owns a higher P(E,T) of 95.9% and 84.4% than the BDT3TR-SF-based device (90.2% and 72.8%) under short-circuit and maximum-power output conditions, respectively. The results suggest that charges were separated and extracted more efficiently in the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blend, which favors the high FF.
To probe the nongeminate recombination in both blends, the dependence of photocurrent (Jsc) to the light intensity (Plight) was analyzed. The relationship was described by Jsc ∝ Plightα.41 The α value closer to 1 indicates a weaker nongeminate recombination. As shown in Fig. 2d, the α is 0.99 for the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout device and it is 0.95 for the BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout device, which suggests reduced nongeminate recombination in the former. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to measure the charge-carrier mobility (Fig. S3†). The electron (ue) and hole mobility (uh) for BSFDT:NBDTP-Fout blend were determined to be 3.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while that of BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout blend were 0.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In addition, the smaller uh/ue value of the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blend (1.09) compared with that of BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout (1.54) indicates more-balanced charge transporting within the former film. The higher and more-balanced charge mobility in the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blend suggests more-favorable charge transport with suppressed recombination, which may result from its better morphology than in the BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout blend.
The morphology of different films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). As shown in Fig. S4,† the BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout film exhibits a distinctly aggregated surface with large irregular separated domains of root-mean-square roughness (Rq) approximately 5.21 nm, while the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout film shows well-interpenetrated networks with a Rq around 1.82 nm. The well-interpenetrating networks benefits the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the blends, which contribute to the high FF and Jsc. The optimized phase separation in the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blend is attributed to the change in crystallinity due to the structural variation of the donor.
To gain more insight on molecular packing and orientation within the blends, a GIWAXS measurement was performed. As shown in Fig. 3, both neat films of BDT3TR-SF and BSFTR exhibit strong (010) diffractions of π–π stacking along the in-plane (IP) direction together with distinct (h00) diffractions along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, which indicates both edge-on-preferable packing with respect to the substrate. Using the Scherrer equation,42 the calculated (010) π-stacking crystallite coherence lengths (CCL010) of BSFTR and BDT3TR-SF neat films are 4.1 nm and 4.5 nm, respectively, and the corresponding CCL100 values are 14.6 nm and 17.5 nm, respectively. These results suggest the relatively weaker crystallinity of BSFTR film. For the neat NBDTP-Fout acceptor, multiple diffractions are probed along both directions, which verifies the strong crystallinity and the formation of mixed edge-on and face-on arrangements, a so-called three-dimensional texture. Compared with BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout, the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blend shows more detailed diffraction peaks that are attributed to the acceptor crystals. The acceptor crystals keep their orderly stacking without broken lattice structures in the blends. The corresponding (010) π–π diffractions induced by each component in the blends were analyzed by multiple-peak fitting. In the two blends, the π-face-on CCL010 values for BSFTR (4.0 nm) and BDT3TR-SF (3.4 nm) donors remain similar, whereas the CCL010 values for NBDTP-Fout were different, i.e., 4.2 nm for the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blend and 6.3 nm for the BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout blend. The balanced CCL010 values of BSFTR donor and NBDTP-Fout acceptor in their blends correlate well with the finer phase separation observed by AFM and TEM. In addition, the coexistence of face-on and edge-on orientations relative to the substrate was observed for both blends, which suggests efficient carrier transporting through both parallel and vertical channels.43 Furthermore, we identified the proportion of π-face-on donor crystallite population via using Axy/(Axy + Az) for the (100)donor diffraction in the blend films, where the integrated areas within the azimuthal angle (χ) range of 0–45° and 135–180° (Axy) and 45–135° (Az) are defined as the corresponding fractions of face-on and edge-on crystallites, respectively. The calculated Axy/(Axy + Az) values are 0.25 and 0.15 for BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout and BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout, respectively, which suggests a larger amount of donor crystallites with π-face-on orientation in the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blend. It favors the hole transfer in vertical channels across the electrodes. The formation of a well-intermixed microstructure by structural modification of the donor contributes to the efficient charge transport and extraction, which produces high FF in the BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout system.

To probe the mechanism of achieved CIL-free solar cells we conducted a comparative study based on BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout and the other three organic photovoltaic blends, PBDB-T:NBDTP-Fout, BSFTR:IDIC and BSFTR:NBDT-Mout. Detailed photovoltaic parameters regarding their devices with or without CILs were summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 4a. The former three blends all show comparable photovoltaic performance between their CIL and CIL-free devices, while the last one exhibits a great difference, which suggests strong dependence to the molecular acceptors regarding the successful fabrication of efficient CIL-free devices. As known, the interfacial layers behave multiple functions on tuning the energy level alignment, defining electrodes' polarity, influencing the morphology/absorption of active layers and stabilizing the interface. Among such functions, the Fermi level alignment at the interface was most important because it not only affects the contacting resistance but also influences the formation of a static internal electric field, which was a prerequisite for efficient charge extraction. Considering the well-matched Fermi levels at the active layer/metal interface, additional interfacial layers may not be necessary. However, due to measurement difficulties, the quasi-Fermi levels of photo-induced electrons could hardly be determined, and we thus probed the interfacial character of organic materials using the LUMO levels of molecular acceptors instead. As shown in Fig. 4b, the NBDTP-Fout and IDIC acceptors show similar LUMO levels while that of NBDT-Mout are much uplifted, indicating the better-matched quasi-Fermi level of photo-induced electrons within molecular photovoltaic blends based on NBDTP-Fout and IDIC than on NBDT-Mout at the corresponding metal-contacting interfaces. Since the interfacial states between the active layers and Al electrodes are relevant with the blending condition within the bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics, the effect on energetics by the above contacting is considered to be morphology-dependent. In addition, the morphology-related electrical contact issue may also play a role. Fig. 4c shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the metal-semiconductor contacts. Both of the photoactive blends and pristine NBDTP-Fout deposited can form dense contacts without obvious pin-holes, voids, and other trap sites at their interfaces with the Al anode. Extracted from the J–V curves of optimal devices, the series resistance for the CIL-with and CIL-free solar cells are 15.34 and 15.94 Ω cm−2 respectively, which indicates both fine interfacial contacts. This fine metal–semiconductor contact provides another important prerequisite for achieving efficient CIL-free devices by maximally reducing the contacting barrier, which contributes to efficient charge transport and extraction at the active layer/electrode interface. As shown in Fig. 4d and e, the CIL-free devices based on BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout blend exhibit similar carrier lifetime and extraction rates to the normal devices, which provides strong evidence for their utility. More interestingly, the CIL-free devices show comparable long-term stability to the CIL-based devices (Fig. 4f), which is probably due to the device's good resistance to metal atom diffusion by its smooth surface with few defects. Thus, the successful fabrication of efficient CIL-free OSCs was mainly attributed to two factors, i.e., the formation of matched quasi-Fermi level of photo-induced electrons to the metal electrode and the formation of fine electrical contact at the active layer/electrode interface, which both contribute to realizing efficient charge extraction. Because of its advantages in efficiency, stability, and processing-simplicity, the CIL-free devices were believed to be of great potential for the further development of organic photovoltaics, especially mass production of commercial cells.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we achieved efficient CIL-free OSCs via tuning the charge extraction within devices through molecular engineering. A weak crystalline molecular donor BSFTR was designed and synthesized, which induced appropriate bi-continuous phase-separation morphology when it blended with a strong crystalline acceptor, NBDTP-Fout. The BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout film obtains a well-intermixed microstructure with generating efficient charge percolation pathways and suppressed recombination. In addition, due to favorable energetic alignment at the active layer/Al interfaces as well as the formation of fine electrical contact at such interfaces, efficient charge extraction can be achieved even without CILs, which deliver an optimal PCE of up to 12.26%, the best value obtained for a binary single-junction NF-SMSC to date. This work clarifies the key factors for achieving efficient CIL-free solar cells with providing new perspectives for designing more efficient, cost-cutting, and mass production-favorable OSCs.
