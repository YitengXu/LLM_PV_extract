    , Accepted 22nd May 2015First published on 27th May 2015AbstractTwo novel BODIPY (pyrromethene, PM) dyes containing N-ethyl carbazole at the meso position are synthesized and their photophysical properties in different solvents and the photochemical stabilities and laser performances in n-heptane are investigated. The n-heptane solution of the dyes was used as a gain medium in a constructed narrow band dye laser, pumped by a Q-switched (10 Hz) frequency-doubled (532 nm) Nd:YAG laser and the results gave enhanced photo stabilities and similar peak efficiencies of the synthesized dyes as compared to parent dye PM567. When substituted at the meso position with N-alkyl carbazole, photostability is found to be increased in comparison to PM567, and also when substituted at 2- and 6-positions with a benzyl group instead of an ethyl group along with N-ethyl carbazole at the meso position, the photo stability is further increased in n-heptane. A comprehensive study on structural, photophysical and electronic properties of dyes by means of DFT and TD-DFT in the solvents of various polarities has revealed remarkable characteristics of the BODIPY chromophore.
Introduction
The BODIPYs (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) are highly fluorescent dyes and can be used for diverse applications such as bio-labels,1 sensitizers in solar cells,2 fluorescent sensors,3–6 molecular photonic wires7 and electron transfer reagents.8 They exhibit low intersystem crossing (ISC) rates and often possess a triplet–triplet absorption coefficient about five times less than that of the rhodamine dyes over the laser spectral region,7,9–16 and hence are very useful in dye laser applications. These dyes exhibit good solubility in many organic solvents and even in methyl methacrylate (MMA) that is useful for solid-state dye laser applications.17–23 Two major inherent deficiencies of the BODIPY dyes are their small Stokes shift, known to be responsible for the ground state absorption loss leading to the reduced lasing efficiency of the PM dyes, and the fast degradation of dye molecules when used in alcohol media under lasing conditions. The problem has been addressed to some extent by carrying out modifications either at the meso (C8) position, C3, C5 center or at the boron atom of the pyrromethene moiety,24–28 particularly for widely used PM567 (refer Fig. 1 for the molecular structure of PM 567). As far as the high-average power laser applications of PM dyes are concerned, one needs to focus more on their sustainable operation and thus photochemical stability in addition to a high conversion efficiency. It is now well established that photodegradation of the PM dyes occurs primarily due to their photochemical reaction with in situ generated singlet oxygen (1O2).29–31 It was envisaged that the photostability and lasing properties of the PM dyes can be improved by suitable modifications of the substitution pattern on the PM core. Earlier, similar approaches have been adopted to synthesize a host of analogues of the most extensively used pyrromethene dye, PM567, by incorporating different substituents at C-8 and/or C-2 + C-6 positions (Fig. 1) of the PM moiety.9,31 Among these, PM650 (with CN at C-8) showed ∼50 times higher photostability than PM567.31 However, either the fluorescence quantum yield or Stokes shift of these analogues was too low to be used as laser dyes.9,28 In contrast, the effect of alteration of the alkyl substituent at the pyrrole rings (C2, C3, C5, C6 positions) was much less on photophysical properties of PM dyes.29 Conversely for photostability, it is now well established that the excited dye in its triplet state is mainly responsible for the in situ generation of reactive singlet oxygen (1O2). The involvement of the triplet excited state (T1) of the dye has been confirmed from their higher decomposition rates in the presence of benzophenone, a triplet sensitizer.32 Also under lasing conditions generated singlet oxygen (1O2) reacts at the C7′–C8 double bond of the dye molecule which produces an unstable peroxo compound leading to the breakdown of the PM chromophore.28,33,34 The enhanced photostability of the PM dyes in de-oxygenated dye solutions, and also in the presence of 1 wt% of singlet oxygen quenchers like Tin770, TBP, and DABCO confirmed the involvement of the singlet oxygen (1O2) in the degradation of the PM molecules thereby progressively decreasing the laser efficiency over a period of operating time.33 Therefore, the photostability of the PM dyes might be increased by reducing the generation of reactive 1O2 and/or reducing the rate of reaction of dyes with 1O2 in a dye–solvent environment.

It was felt that if one judiciously changes the substituents at C8 or C2 + C6, chances of getting enhanced photostability of the PM dyes will be more compared to the parent dye PM567. The primary aim of the present investigation was to develop a highly photostable congener of the PM567 laser dye by rational design and evaluate its photophysical, laser efficiency and photostability in comparison to the parent dye. It is a well-known fact that carbazole derivatives owing to their good electron donor capacity have been used in various photovoltaic, OLEDs, and photo sensitizer applications.35,36 Carbazole can be easily functionalized and its derivatives exhibit good absorption and emission properties, therefore, it has become popular among the chemists.37–42 Recently, there has been a report on the effect of the insertion of a carbazole group on the photophysical properties of the BODIPY dyes when there is no methyl groups at 1 and 7-positions of the PM core.43 We wanted to evaluate the effect of the N-ethyl carbazole at the meso position in the presence of 1 and 7-methyl groups on electrochemical, photophysical, laser and photostability characteristics of the PM dyes. The N-ethyl carbazole moiety at the meso position was expected to be oriented orthogonally in the presence of 1 and 7-methyl groups on the PM core and should not alter the photophysical properties of the PM dyes but may change the electronic properties to some extent as a result of charge transfer from electron rich N-ethyl carbazole to the electron deficient PM core. Also, it was envisaged that the change in ethyl to benzyl groups at 2 and 6-positions in combination of N-ethyl carbazole at C-8 of the PM core should further alter the electrochemical properties of the PM dye leaving photophysical properties unaltered. To this end, we have synthesized two new BODIPY dyes, dye 2, using N-ethyl carbazole aldehyde and kryptopyrrole, and dye 3, using N-ethyl carbazole aldehyde and benzyl pyrrole,44 compared their photophysical, lasing properties and photochemical stability with that of parent PM567 (dye 1), and rationalized the results in terms of their photophysical properties as well as TD-DFT computations using the functional B3LYP and the 6-31G(d) basis set. The molecular structures of the PM dyes 1, 2 and 3 are illustrated in Fig. 1.
Results and discussion
Photophysical characteristics
The measured photophysical parameters (longest wavelength absorption maxima (λabs), emission maxima (λem), quantum yield of fluorescence (ϕfl), and fluorescence life time (τ)) along with calculated radiative decay (kr) and non-radiative decay (knr) rates of the dyes 2 and 3 relative to those of the dye 1 in solvents of different polarities, inclusive of practically useful solvents such as ethanol and n-heptane, for high power dye lasers (see Lasing section), are presented in Table 1. The absorption and emission spectra of the new PM dyes 2 and 3 in various solvents are shown in Fig. S1–S4 (ESI†), respectively. For illustration, the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the dyes 1–3 in n-heptane are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. The PM dyes 1–3 in n-heptane had intense S0 → S1 absorption maxima centered at 518–523 nm, each with a smaller fwhm (full width at half maxima), 765–957 cm−1 in comparison to that of PM567. The wider fwhm of absorption and particularly of fluorescence spectra of the laser dyes are beneficial to provide higher laser wavelength coverage by a single dye.

 Fig. 2  Normalized longest wavelength absorption band of PM dyes 1–3 in n-heptane. 
 Fig. 3  Normalized emission spectra of dyes 1–3 in n-heptane, excitation wavelength was 490 nm. 
On the other hand in the case of BODIPY laser dyes, their small Stokes shift (10–15 nm) and broader fwhm of absorption and emission bands may give a larger extent of spectral overlap leading to the increase in the ground state absorption of the dye laser signal and thus a decreased dye laser efficiency. However, the change in solvent polarities had a weak influence on the fwhm and other important photophysical properties of the BODIPY chromophores, 2 and 3, Table 1 and Fig. S1–S4 (ESI†).
The shapes of the absorption spectra of dyes 2 and 3 were similar to that of dye 1, but the maxima were bathochromically shifted by 2–4 nm. Dyes 2 and 3 compared to dye 1 showed sharper absorption bands, the fwhm decreased from 957 cm−1 for dye 1 to 877 cm−1 and 823 cm−1 for dyes 2 and 3 in ethanol, respectively. Similarly in n-heptane there was a decrease in fwhm from 802 cm−1 for dye 1 to 777 cm−1 and 766 cm−1 for dyes 2 and 3, respectively, indicating the effect of N-ethyl carbazole at the meso position as well as substitution of benzyl groups at 2 and 6-positions of BODIPY fluorophores further making the absorption band more intense and sharper. Similarly there is a decrease in fwhm in the case of dye 3 but the effect of N-ethyl carbazole (dye 2) is more prominent compared to that of N-ethyl carbazole in combination with benzyl groups at 2 and 6-positions (dye 3). The sharpening of the absorption and fluorescence bands in the case of dyes 2 and 3 compared to dye 1 can be attributed to significantly higher polarizability of the dye chromophore due to the increased π electron density. The fluorescence spectra of dyes 2 and 3 were also identical throughout the series of various solvents and entirely consistent with fluorescence from the PM sub unit and are almost mirror images of the respective absorption spectra (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†) with a small Stokes shift (11–14 nm). This may be correlated with the minimum change in the geometry of the molecules in their excited state relative to that of the respective ground state. From this it can be seen that the substitution at the meso position has a very low or a negligible influence on the photophysics of the BODIPY chromophore. Dyes 2 and 3, relative to dye 1, showed similar fluorescence quantum yields (ϕfl), Table 1. Table 1 revealed that dye 2 gave comparable molar extinction coefficients (εmax) at their respective absorption maximum with that of dye 1 but dye 3 showed surprisingly enhanced molar extinction coefficients (εmax), almost double in n-heptane compared to that of dye 2, indicating the effect of substitution of benzyl groups at 2 and 6-positions of the BODIPY chromophore. We observed that dye 1 possessed highest fluorescence lifetime of 6.19 ns in ethanol followed by 6.03 ns in n-heptane but dyes 2 and 3 show decreased fluorescence lifetimes, 5.9 ns and 5.38 ns in ethanol and 5.32 ns and 4.99 ns in n-heptane, respectively. Correlations of photophysical characteristics and molecular structures of synthesized dyes are discussed in further detail in the Theoretical calculations section.
Laser characteristics
Among different solvents used in this study for understanding photophysical properties of PM dyes 1–3, we found that normally used ethanol and rarely used n-heptane are suitable for a high average power dye laser study. Both ethanol and n-heptane showed good photophysical properties (Table 1) such as high fluorescence yield (ϕfl) of the dyes 1–3 as well as low inflammability (b.p. 78 °C and 98 °C, respectively), viscosity (1 cp and 0.5 cp @ 20 °C, respectively) and toxicity, suitable for handling a large amount of flowing dye solution and maintaining a turbulent flow profile with a thinner boundary layer in the dye flow channel (typically 0.3 to 1 mm width) of such dye lasers. Interestingly, in comparison to ethanol, n-heptane has shown significantly higher photostability (Table 2) of the widely used laser dye 1 (PM567). Therefore, we have studied narrow band laser properties of the newly synthesized dyes 2–3 using n-heptane solvent as a gain medium in the Nd-YAG (532 nm) pumped dye laser.

The results of laser studies of PM dyes 1–3 in n-heptane are presented in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 4–6. The narrow band laser profiles of dyes 1–3 follow the pattern of their respective emission spectra (Fig. 3) showing a maximum lasing efficiency at particular wavelength (λL), characteristic of the dye (Table 2 and Fig. 4). The lasing efficiency values (η) of dyes 1–3 are 16.5%, 12.4% and 11.3%, respectively, and laser slope efficiency (ηs) values are 15.3%, 13.4% and 12.3%, respectively, at their respective laser maxima (Table 2 and Fig. 5). These results revealed that the N-ethyl carbazole moiety provided a slightly negative effect on lasing efficiency and the combination of N-ethyl carbazole at meso and benzyl groups at 2 and 6-positions is responsible for a further small decrease in lasing efficiency. The decrease in lasing efficiency in the case of dyes 2 and 3 could be accounted for the torsional motions of N-ethyl carbazole and flexible benzyl groups, contributing to the higher non-radiative decay (see Table 1, column 14) rates.

Photostability characteristics
The quantum yields of photodegradation (Φpd) or photostability (Φpd−1) data of the dyes 1–3, in air-equilibrated n-heptane solvent, were measured and calculated under non-lasing conditions (Table 2 and Fig. 6).
It is reported that irradiation with 532 nm led to the degradation of the PM dyes at the olefinic site (C7′C8) and produced non-fluorescent products,28 leaving shape of its absorption band (S0 → S1) unaltered while a gradual decrease in respective peak heights. Therefore, a decrease in concentration of dye molecules upon exposure to laser irradiation, calculated by measuring the reduction in optical density (OD) of the dye solution at λmax, gave the estimate of quantum yield of photodegradation (Φpd) of the dye in the respective solvent. Significantly, we have observed eighty two times enhancement in photostability of dye 1 in n-heptane compared to that in ethanol. Interestingly, the synthesized dyes 2–3 showed further enhanced photostabilities, compared with dye 1, in n-heptane (Table 2).
Dyes 2 and 3 showed two and four times, respectively, increase in the photostability compared to that of dye 1 in n-heptane (see Table 2 and Fig. 6) suggesting the positive effect of present modifications on the BODIPY dyes.
It is now well established that the in situ generated singlet oxygen (1O2) is mainly responsible for the breakdown of the PM dye structure as 1O2 adds at the C7′–C8 double bond and forms the peroxo compound. The remarkable enhancement in the photostability of the PM dyes in less polar solvent like n-heptane compared to highly polar solvent ethanol may be attributed to the lower reaction probability of the polar singlet oxygen (1O2) species with dye molecules in less polar media and vice versa. However, ability of generating 1O2 by PM dyes in a solvent environment may vary, which is discussed in the following section.
Generation of 1O2 by dyes
The capacity of generating 1O2 by each PM dye in n-heptane was determined by monitoring the dye-sensitized degradation kinetics of additive DPBF (1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran), which possesses high reactivity with 1O2. DPBF essentially traps the produced singlet oxygen (1O2) through its oxidation.45,46 The results of our study of generating 1O2 by n-heptane solutions of the dyes are shown in Fig. 7. Under the experimental conditions tungsten lamp radiation (λ > 495 nm, transmitted through a cut off filter) excited only the PM dye molecules to the S1 state. This in turn produced dye molecules in the triplet excited state (T1) depending on the intersystem crossing rate (kISC) of the dye–solvent system followed by the reaction of the triplet state (T1) dye with dissolved oxygen in a specific solvent to generate 1O2.
 Fig. 7  Absorption spectra of DPBF (50 μM) in the presence of the photo-excited dyes (5 μM each) in n-heptane: (A) dye 1; (B) dye 2 and (C) dye 3; after exposure time (0 to 10 min; recorded at 2 min interval) and (D) relative rate of 1O2 generation of dyes 1–3 in n-heptane, determined by measuring the time dependent decrease in OD of DPBF at its λmax (412 nm). 
The generated 1O2 species reacted mainly with the additive DPBF, since concentration of the DPBF was much higher as well as a faster rate of reaction of 1O2 with DPBF.45 It may be noted that the concentration of DPBF (50 μM) was taken ten times higher than that of the dye (5 μM). This is evident from Fig. 7 which showed no decrease in absorbance of the dye peak during the lamp exposure period. However, the absorbance of DPBF was observed to reduce gradually due to reaction with generated 1O2 by PM dyes (Fig. 7). The rate of DPBF consumption with exposure time corresponds to the relative efficiency of 1O2 generation by the particular dye solution. These results illustrated that dye 3 generated 1O2 at a smaller rate than dye 2 which in turn generated 1O2 at a smaller rate compared to dye 1 (Fig. 7). So the order of the rate of generation of 1O2 is dye 3 < dye 2 < dye 1, which follows the observed order of photostability of PM dyes 1–3 (dye 3 > dye 2 > dye 1) in n-heptane solvent (Table 2 and Fig. 6).
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry analysis of BODIPY dyes 1–3 showed a reversible peak in each case in the anodic portion of the cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 8), which was assigned to one-electron oxidation of the BODIPY unit. From Fig. 8 and Table 3, it can be seen that dyes 2 (E0ox = 1.007 V) and 3 (E0ox = 1.075 V) show higher oxidation potential than dye 1 (E0ox = 0.997 V), by 10 mV, and 78 mV, respectively. The above data suggest that the trend in probability of electron donation capacity of the dyes increases in the order dye 3 < dye 2 < dye 1, which also supports the observed trend of photo stabilities (dye 3 > dye 2 > dye 1) of dyes 1–3.

From larger oxidation potential of dye 3 relative to that of dyes 1 and 2 (Table 3), it can be concluded that the benzyl groups at 2 and 6-positions, though not in conjugation with the PM core, can play an important role in decreasing the electron density at the reaction site (C7′–C8 double bond), making dye 3 most stable compared to dye 2 followed by dye 1.
It may be noted that the HOMO of the PM dye and the LUMO of the singlet oxygen (1O2) are involved in the process of photo cleavage of the PM dyes.48 The energies of the HOMO and the LUMO and energy gaps, LUMO–HOMO, of the dyes 1–3 were determined from their oxidation and reduction potentials. It is apparent that the band gap energy and singlet oxygen generation capacity are directly proportional to each other.49
Dyes 2 and 3 have got almost a similar HOMO–LUMO band gap but dye 1 has a higher band gap compared to dyes 2 and 3, which indicates that dye 1 can produce more singlet oxygen compared to dyes 2 and 3. The results of 1O2 generation using dye sensitized DPBF and cyclic voltammetry experiments illustrated that dyes 2 and 3 have lower capacity to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) as well as lower reactivity with the generated 1O2 in comparison to dye 1. Dye 3 showed higher oxidation potential than dye 2, explaining enhanced photo stability of dye 3. Therefore, modifications at either meso or both at meso and 2 and 6-positions did not alter considerably the photophysical properties of congeners of PM567, but their electronic properties.
Theoretical interpretations
The BODIPY dyes 1–3 possess a compact chromophore with high molar extinction coefficients, which can be used to explore their electronic structures in various solvents by means of DFT and TD-DFT calculations using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. We have analyzed the absorption and emission characteristics of PM dyes 1–3 and correlated these with the observed laser and photostability properties.

Geometries in the ground state and lowest lying excited singlet and triplet states. 
Dyes 1–3 were optimized in their ground (S0) state, and lowest lying excited singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) states with the help of DFT and TD-DFT using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method for all the atoms in a vacuum and various organic solvents. For illustration, the results of geometry optimization of dyes 1–3 in n-heptane media are presented in Table 4 (please refer to Fig. 9 for atom numbering used to explain DFT and TD-DFT parameters). The BODIPY unit was found to be perfectly planar in optimized geometries (S0, S1 and T1) of dyes 1–3 with very little displacement (0.6–5.4 Å) of the boron atom revealing the effective overlap of p-orbitals. In both dyes 2 and 3, N-ethyl carbazole at the meso (C-8) position oriented orthogonally relative to the BODIPY framework with a little twist making an angle of 95.1° and 95.3°, respectively, in the S0 state.

 Fig. 9  Atom numbering system presented to explain the DFT and TD-DFT results for PM dyes 1–3. 
Further, in the excited state (S1) the N-ethyl carbazole turns out to be perfectly orthogonal with the BODIPY plane making a dihedral angle of 90.9 and 90.8°, respectively. These results signify that the N-ethyl carbazole moiety is not electronically coupled with the BODIPY plane in S0 and S1 states, and thus show a negligible influence on the photophysical properties (absorption and emission maxima) of dyes 2 and 3. The phenyl rings of 2 and 6-substituents in the case of dye 3 appear to make an angle of 36.2°, 34.4° and 37.5° in S0, S1 and T1 states, respectively. The shortening of the C8–C9 bond by 0.013 Å is observed in the case of both dyes 2 and 3 relative to that of dye 1 suggesting the intramolecular charge transfer from N-ethyl carbazole to the BODIPY core. Shortening of the C10–C11 bond is observed in the case of dye 3 by 0.013 Å relative to that of dye 2, supporting the alteration of the electronic properties of the BODIPY core as a result of incorporation of benzyl groups at 2 and 6-positions of the BODIPY core. There is a negligible change in the other geometrical parameters such as bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles etc. (Table 4) when molecules are excited from the S0 → S1 state leading to the emission of energy with minimum energy loss (small Stokes shift) which is characteristic of typical BODIPY dyes.50

Table 4 shows that the N-ethyl carbazole at the meso position in dyes 2 and 3, in the T1 state, is displaced from its perfectly orthogonal arrangement with the BODIPY core in the S1 state by 25.5° and 24.6°, respectively, allowing the p-orbital overlap between the two chromophores (N-ethyl carbazole and the BODIPY core) effective which may lead to the pronounced intramolecular charge transfer. Also further shortening of the C8–C9 bond in T1 of the dyes 2 and 3 relative to that of S1 is observed by 0.013 and 0.011 Å which may also increase the probability of charge transfer between N-ethyl carbazole and the BODIPY core. The rest of the geometry parameters like bond lengths, bond and dihedral angles are maintained in T1 similar to that of S1, except that the boron atom in dyes 2 and 3 is displaced more by 4.1° and 3.6° from its perfectly planar arrangement in S1. Both the processes in the T1 state of dyes 2 and 3, that is, rotation of N-ethyl carbazole from its orthogonal arrangement, leading to charge transfer and displacement of the boron atom from perfectly planer arrangement in the respective S1 state suggest that contribution of the non-radiative decay rate (knr) in the energy loss is more for dyes 2 and 3 relative to that of dye 1.


Mulliken charges. 
The analysis of Mulliken charge distribution over the atoms of the BODIPY chromophore, in solvent n-heptane (Table 5 and Fig. S5–S7, ESI†), did show a considerable variation in the electron densities at different atoms (C-2, C-7′, C-8, C-9, and C-10). Changing the C-8 methyl substituent to the N-ethyl carbazole (dye 2) led to a little increase in the electron density at C-7, but an abrupt decrease in the electron density at C-8 was observed which could be the reason for the decrease in the reactivity of dye 2 with the generated singlet oxygen (1O2). It may be noted that the addition of singlet oxygen (1O2) at the C7′–C8 double bond of the BODIPY chromophore initiates its photodegradation. Also dye 3, in which ethyl substituents at 2 and 6-positions of dye 1 changed to benzyl, showed the abrupt decrease in the electron density at C-2/C-6 and C-10 while the effect of N-ethyl carbazole at C-7′, C-8 and C-9 was similar. Therefore, though the phenyl rings in the benzyl group were not in direct conjugation with BODIPY chromophore, still could alter the electronic properties of the PM moiety such that its photostability increased. At the same time a decrease in the lasing efficiencies of dyes 2 and 3, compared to that of dye 1, could be explained by a sharp decrease in the electron densities at C-8 since the N-ethyl carbazole reduced the flow of electrons over the PM chromophore. Comparison of Mulliken charges in S0 and S1 states of dyes 2 and 3 revealed no or a negligible change in the electron densities over various atoms of the PM moiety (Table S1, ESI†).

TD-DFT excitations and emissions. 
Further the DFT and TD-DFT (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) method have been employed to get more understanding of the photophysical properties of the synthesized dyes and the results are summarized in Tables 6 and 7. The results suggested no or negligible influence of change in solvent polarity on the photophysical properties of the PM dyes (Table 7), which agree with our experimental observations. Table 7 revealed that the absorption maxima for the dyes 2 and 3 in all different solvents are centered at around 442–447 nm with about 15% deviation from the experimental values of the absorption maxima. In all the studied solvents the vertical excitations of dyes 2 and 3 were found to associate with the HOMO to LUMO (π to π*) transition while the oscillator strengths ranged from 0.54 to 0.69. For comparison we have performed the similar calculation for dye 1 also (Table 6) which showed its absorption maxima slightly blue shifted by about 2–6 nm compared to that of dyes 2 and 3. The TD-DFT also accounted for the enhanced εmax values of dye 3 showing its higher oscillator strengths of vertical excitation compared to that of dye 2 in all the studied solvents. In addition to the normal HOMO to LUMO transition for dyes 2 and 3 (443.4 and 445.1 nm, respectively), the S0 to S1 excitations mainly contributed by the HOMO−1 to LUMO transition and located at 447 nm and 456 nm, respectively, in n-heptane with negligible oscillator strengths (Fig. 10). These characteristic effects were originated from intramolecular charge transfer characters from the meso N-ethylcarbazole to BODIPY core. This intramolecular charge transfer may be responsible for their enhanced photostabilities compared to that of the dye 1 (the point of charge transfer is also explained later in section of Frontier molecular orbital energies).

 Fig. 10  The simulated (TD-DFT) absorption spectra of dyes 1–3 in n-heptane media; (A) dye 1; (B) dye 2; (C) dye 3 (where f represents Oscillator Strength) (Note: Markings with star (*) represents mentioned transition). 
The energy optimized structures of S1 were subjected again to the single point energy calculations using TD-DFT in order to get calculated emission spectra. Consistent with the experimental observations, the calculated emission spectra also suggested that there is no influence of change in solvent polarity, on the vertical emissions of dyes 2 and 3. The TD-DFT emission maxima for dye 2 in various solvents are centered at 449.8 nm to 550.8 nm with oscillator strength in the range 0.43–0.53. For highly polar solvents such as acetonitrile, DMF, DMSO, MeOH, EtOH, acetone, etc. the emissions for dye 2 were found to associate with LUMO to HOMO−1 transition. Conversely, in the case of solvents of lower polarities like ethyl acetate, chloroform, 1,4-dioxane and n-heptane, the emissions for dye 2 were found to associate with LUMO to HOMO. Similarly the TD-DFT emissions for dye 3 in various solvents are centered at 450.1 nm to 452.9 nm in various solvents with enhanced oscillator strengths (0.52–0.59) compared to dye 2 (Table 7). Consistent with the observation of low Stokes shifts in the range of 506 cm−1 to 360 cm−1 for dyes 2 and 3, TD-DFT also suggested smaller Stokes shifts of 367 to 250 cm−1. Thus, TD-DFT calculation also accounts for the experimentally observed lower Stokes shifts of dyes 2 and 3 (Table 7). In the case of ethyl acetate and chloroform solvents, dye 3, unlike dye 2, shows emissions associated with the LUMO to HOMO transitions.


The fluorescence quantum yields and comparison of radiative (kr) rate constants. 
The fluorescence quantum yield (ϕfl) from an S1 state to S0 state can be correlated with the radiative (kr) and non-radiative (knr) rate constants by following equation, (1)where τfl is fluorescence life time.
The fluorescence quantum yields (ϕfl) are affected by competition between kr and knr. Therefore, a small value of knr and a large value of kr are necessary for molecules to be more fluorescent.
The S1–T1 intersystem crossing rate (kISC) plays a crucial role in the emission process. Therefore, we focus on kISC to gain further insight into different kr of dyes 1–3 in heptane media. The calculated T1 energy parameters relative to that of S1 along with the experimental fluorescence quantum yields (ϕfl) and radiative (kr) and non-radiative (knr) rate constants in n-heptane media are presented in Table 8. A qualitative explanation of kISC can be accomplished as a function of energy separation between the singlet S1 and the closest triplet Tn,51,52 as kISC exponentially decreases as the singlet–triplet gap (ΔES1–Tn) increases.53,54

The minimum ΔES1–T1 favors the enhancement in kISC, leading to an increased kr thus the ϕfl. Table 8 shows that ΔES1–T1 is relatively smaller for dyes 2 and 3, 1.757 eV and 1.759 eV respectively, compared with dye 1 (2.257 eV), which accounts for the experimentally observed larger kr of dyes 2 and 3 (Table 8). Also from Table 8 it can be seen that the trend of ΔES1–T1 for dyes 1–3 (dye 1 > dye 3 > dye 2) agrees with the experimentally observed trend in kr, that is dye 2 > dye 3 > dye 1.
From the above discussion we can conclude that the dyes 1–3 show good ϕfl owing to its smaller knr. Though the dyes 2 and 3 possess larger kr compared to the dye 1, still dye 2 show similar ϕfl and dye 3 show lower ϕfl compared to that of the dye 1, which can be attributed to larger non-radiative (knr) rate constants of the dyes 2 and 3 compared to the dye 1 (Table 8).


Dipole moments. 
Electronic excitation of dye molecules produces redistribution of polarizable π-electrons due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), which causes the change in the dipole moment in the excited state. Knowledge on dipole moments of the dye molecule in the ground (So) and excited (S1, T1etc.) states is useful to extract parameters like molecular polarizability and to assess the electron density distribution in the S1 and T1 states. The calculated dipole moments of dye 1 in ethanol and n-heptane along with that of the dyes 2–3 in solvents of different polarities are summarized in Table 9 and Table S2 (ESI†). The TD-DFT calculations revealed a minimum change in dipole moments of the S0 and S1 states of dyes 2–3 in different solvents of various polarities, which support the experimentally observed weak solvatochromism. The calculated dipole moments of dyes 2–3, both in the ground (μ0) and the excited singlet (μ1) states, were larger compared to that of dye 1 (Table 9), proposing better polarizability of dyes 2 and 3. With a decrease in solvent polarity from DMSO to n-heptane, the dipole moments of the S0 and S1 states of dyes 2–3 were found to decrease (Table S2, ESI†) which suggested poor polarization of the PM dyes in less polar solvents like dioxane and heptane. The poor polarizability of the PM dyes in solvents of lower polarities compared to the solvents of higher polarities could be a reason for their enhanced photostability in n-heptane than that in ethanol. This may be associated with more uniform distribution of electronic charges over the PM core in the case of lower polarity solvents and thus reducing their probability of electron donation to the singlet oxygen (1O2) species.

Frontier molecular orbital energies. 
Energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), especially HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1, and their spatial distributions can give the idea about behavior of the dye molecules in terms of photophysical properties, lasing properties and photostabilities.
The contour plots of the HOMO−1, HOMO and LUMO of dyes 1–3 in n-heptane, calculated by the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, are shown in Fig. 11 and HOMO and LUMO energies and band gaps in ethanol and n-heptane and that of the dyes 2–3 in the solvents of different polarities are summarized in Table 9 and Table S2 (ESI†), respectively. Fig. 11 illustrates that in the HOMO−1 orbital of dye 1 the electron density is situated mainly on the BODIPY chromophore, away from C-7, C-7′ and C-8 and very little on B-4. In the case of the HOMO of dye 1, the electron density is localized again on the BODIPY core but completely away from N-3, N-3′ and B-4. However, the electron density is distributed almost uniformly over the whole chromophore for the LUMO of dye 1. This indicated that the HOMO of the PM dye can easily react with the singlet oxygen (1O2) because the C7′–C8 bond possesses maximum electron density in the HOMO compared to HOMO−1 and the LUMO. In the case of dyes 2 and 3, unlike dye 1, the electron density in HOMO−1 is localized only on the meso substituent (N-ethyl carbazole) which is transferred to the BODIPY core in the HOMO and the LUMO. This proposes charge transfer from the meso substituent to the BODIPY core. It may be noted that the C8–C9 bond length was found to be shorter by 0.013 Å in S0 as well as S1 states of dyes 2 and 3 compared to dye 1 (see the Geometrical parameter section), which also indicated the intramolecular charge transfer from the carbazole moiety to the PM core. The HOMO and LUMO of dyes 2 and 3 show similar results to that of dye 1, confirming the involvement of the HOMO of dye 2 and the dye 3 too in the reaction with singlet oxygen (1O2). From Tables 3, 9 and Fig. 11 it can be seen that TD-DFT analysis accounts correctly the HOMO–LUMO band gaps as it follows an observed trend in the cyclic voltammetry study. Dye 1 has a higher HOMO–LUMO band gap followed by dye 3 and then dye 2.
 Fig. 11  Frontier molecular orbitals of dyes 1–3 in n-heptane, calculated by the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory (the orbital diagrams are plotted with the contour value of 0.02 a.u.). 

Fig. 12 and 13 and Table S2 (ESI†) revealed that dye 3 shows more band gap (HOMO → LUMO) compared to dye 2 in different organic solvents. Among the series of studied solvents it is observed that for both dyes 2 and 3 there is a decrease in the band (HOMO–LUMO) gap from polar to non-polar solvents. But the band gap between HOMO−1 to HOMO is increased from polar to non-polar solvents which indicated that possibility of vertical emission from LUMO → HOMO−1 is less feasible in the case of the solvents of lower polarity (Table 9, Fig. 12 and 13). As the solvent polarity decreases from DMSO to n-heptane, the HOMO as well as the LUMO become higher in energy with little decrease in the band gap. But the energy of HOMO−1 is not much influenced by a change in the polarity resulting to an increase in the band gap (HOMO−1 to HOMO). Thus, the LUMO to HOMO−1 transition becomes less feasible with a decrease in solvent polarity.

Experimental section
General methods
Laser grade pyrromethene 567 (PM 567) was procured and used without any further purification. The purity of the dye was found to be >99%, as determined with spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. The chemicals and spectroscopic grade solvents were procured and used as such without further purifications unless otherwise mentioned. All the common chemicals were of analytical grade. The solvents were purified by standard procedures. All the reactions were monitored by TLC (thin-layer chromatography) with detection by UV light. The absorption spectra were recorded on a commercially procured UV/VIS spectrometer. The emission spectra of PM dyes were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer using a 10 mm cuvette with a 2.5 nm slit width at 490 nm excitation wavelength. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a FT/IR-4100 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer. HRMS analysis was done using a 6550 iFunnel QTOF LC/MS, 1290 infinity Binary pump. Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnegan mass spectrometer. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 11B NMR and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a 500 MHz instrument using TMS as an internal standard.
Synthesis
Two novel PM dyes 2 and 3 have been synthesized and their molecular structures are illustrated in Fig. 1 along with the structure of parent dye 1 (PM567). Dye 2 was synthesized by using N-ethyl carbazole aldehyde (4) and the well known kryptopyrrole (A) (Scheme 1). Also, dye 3 was synthesized using N-ethyl carbazole aldehyde (4) and pyrrole (8) (Scheme 2) and instead of DDQ, a milder oxidising agent, p-chloranil, was used in order to avoid the photocleavage of the C8–C9 bond. It is worth mentioning that the pyrrole (8) intermediate can be obtained as a pure solid easily in a few minutes from its corresponding salt of carboxylic acid (7) at room temperature after simple work up and can be stored in a refrigerator for a few weeks.

2,6-Diethyl-4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indecene (2). 
A stirred mixture of compound A (0.662 g, 5.37 mmol), 4 (0.3 g, 2.68 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (250 mL) was degassed using dry N2 for 5 min.

Photophysical studies
The absorption and emission spectra of the dyes in different solvents were measured using a 10 mm path length quartz cuvette. The relative fluorescence quantum yields (ϕfl) of dyes 2 and 3, using standard dye 1 as reference at 490 nm excitation wavelength, and their corresponding molar extinction coefficients (εmax) were determined. The fluorescence lifetimes of dyes 1–3 were determined by time resolved fluorescence measurements carried out using an LED-based time-correlated single photon-counting (TCSPC) spectrometer. The fluorescence decays were measured using a 390 nm LED (1 MHz) excitation source and a TBX4 detection module coupled to a PMT. Following de-convolution analysis of the fluorescence decays, the time resolution of the present setup was around 50 ps. All the measurements were carried out at ambient temperature (298 ± 1 K), maintained using a microprocessor based temperature controller.
Lasing studies
The lasing studies of dyes 1–3 in n-heptane were carried out by using a constructed narrow-band dye laser setup, transversely pumped by the second harmonic (at 532 nm) output of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at a repetition rate of 10 Hz with a pulse energy of around 7 mJ and a fwhm of 5–7 ns. All the laser data for the PM dyes in n-heptane were measured by using the same dye laser setup, which is schematically shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The dye laser was constructed with a grazing-incidence-grating (GIG) configuration (with a grating of 2400 lines mm−1) and a 25 × 4-prisms pre-expander. The tuning curve of each dye solution was obtained by scanning the wavelength of the dye laser through the gain profile of the dyes and measuring the wavelengths using a wavemeter (Angstrom WS-6) and average pump and dye laser powers using the power meter (OPHIR). To determine the pump laser threshold (LT) and slope efficiency (ηs) of each dye solution, the input pump energy was varied and the lasing output of each of the dye solution at the peak of the corresponding gain curve was determined and plotted as a function of pump energy.
Photostability study
The quantum yield of the photo degradation (Φpd) of the dyes is defined as the probability of the decomposition of the dye molecules by the absorbed pump photons. The photo stability (Φpd−1) is the inverse of the Φpd value. A known quantity of dye solution (2.5 mL) in a dye laser cuvette was exposed to a pump energy of 6.7–7.2 mJ at 532 nm for a set period of time. The concentration of the dye solution was chosen such that the pump beam was totally absorbed within the dye solution in the cuvette during the exposure of 3–4 h. The solution was constantly stirred with a teflon-coated magnetic stirrer to avoid local heating. The number of photodegraded dye molecules in the exposed volume of the dye solutions was quantitatively estimated from the absorbance at the corresponding λmax before and after photo exposure for a set period of time. The pump energy was measured periodically by the power meter. The reflection loss of the pump beam on incident surfaces of the dye cell was considered for calculating the absorbed cumulative pump photons.
Generation of 1O2 by dyes
The capacity of generating reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) molecules by photo excited dyes in n-heptane was comparatively determined by measuring the gradual reduction in peak absorbance of the 1O2 quencher DPBF, used as an additive, as a function of lamp exposure time. For this, 3 mL of air equilibrated solvent containing a mixture of DPBF (50 μM) and PM dye (5 μM) in a 10 mm path length quartz cell was irradiated at room temperature for a duration of 10 min using a 40 W tungsten lamp aided by a cut off (λ > 495 nm) filter. The lamp was driven by a voltage stabilized power supply. Thus solution of the dye and DPBF was irradiated by the visible light emitting wavelengths higher than 495 nm only. During this process, respective PM dye (λabs maxima 518–523 nm) was excited and 1O2 was generated, which reacted primarily with DPBF due to higher reactivity and concentration of the latter (10 times more than dye). The extent of a decrease in absorbance of DPBF in the irradiated dye solution as a function of lamp exposure time was a measure of the rate of generation of 1O2 by a particular PM dye solution. The progressive decrease in absorbance of DPBF was measured at its λabs maximum (412 nm) at various fixed intervals (2 min).
Electrochemical studies
Cyclic voltammetry was performed at 25 °C in deoxygenated acetonitrile containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 (tetra butyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate) and a dye concentration of 0.6–1 mM. The glassy carbon (2 mm diameter) was used as a working electrode, platinum wire as a counter electrode and standard calomel electrode as a reference electrode with ferrocene (1 mM) as an internal standard. The redox potentials were standardized with ferrocene (Fc) as the internal reference and referenced to SCE by taking E0 (Fc/Fc+) = +0.405 V versus SCE.
Computational details
All the computations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program package.56 The ground state (S0) geometry of the dyes was optimized using density functional theory (DFT)57 method. The first excited (S1) and triplet excited (T1) states were optimized using time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The functional used was B3LYP, (the B3LYP combines Becke's three parameter exchange functional (B3)58 with the nonlocal correlation functional by Lee, Yang and Parr (LYP)).59 The basis set used in both, DFT and TD-DFT methods for all the atoms was 6-31G(d). In order to verify whether the optimized structures have minimum energy, frequency computations were performed at the same level of theory. The vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths were obtained for the twenty lowest S0 → S1 transitions at the optimized ground state equilibrium geometries by using the Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) using the same hybrid functional and basis set.60–67 To obtain their minimum energy geometries (which correspond to the emissive state) the low-lying first singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states of the dyes were relaxed using the TD-DFT. The emission wavelengths and oscillator strengths were obtained for the ten lowest S1 → S0 transitions at the optimized excited state equilibrium geometries by using the TD-DFT with the same hybrid functional and basis set.67 The frequency computations were also carried out at the same level of theory on the optimised geometry of the first excited state of the dyes. All the computations in various solvents were carried out using the Self-Consistent Reaction Field (SCRF) under the Polarisable Continuum Model (PCM).68,69 The electronic absorption spectra, including wavelengths, oscillator strengths, and main configuration assignment, were systematically investigated using TD-DFT with the PCM model based on the optimized ground structures.
Conclusions
We have investigated the laser performances and photostabilities of the PM dyes including the commercial laser dye, PM567, and observed remarkably enhanced photostability of the PM dyes in n-heptane compared to that in ethanol for PM567. The two novel congeners showed good lasing efficiencies and increased photostability in n-heptane compared to PM567. The results of the cyclic voltammetry support the enhanced photostabilities of the new congeners compared to that of PM567. We have extensively studied the photophysical properties of the new PM dyes experimentally and structural, photophysical and electronic properties by means of DFT and TD-DFT in the solvents of various polarities. These findings will be helpful for the future design and synthesis of efficient and photostable BODIPY laser dyes.
