    , Accepted 13th May 2014First published on 13th May 2014AbstractThis work is the first report of using a deep eutectic solvent named Reline as a green electrolyte to electrodeposit CZTS films for photovoltaic applications. This is successfully achieved by co-electrodepositing Cu–Zn–Sn precursor thin films in Reline and sulfurizing the Cu–Zn–Sn precursors in a mixture of H2S and N2 at 550 °C for 1 h. The CZTS films are uniform and compact on a microscopic scale, which translates to a benign photoresponse of the CZTS solar cell. Photovoltaic devices were prepared from the films and an efficiency of 3.87% has been achieved. The device performance indicates that Reline is a viable green solvent for the electrodeposition of CZTS thin film solar cells in a low cost way.
Introduction
The problem of obtaining high quality electroplated coatings while eliminating the harm to the environment caused by electrolytes has received increasing attention in green electrochemical and environmental industries.1–3 Many efforts have been made to develop green electrolytes for application in electroplating. Some ionic liquids (ILs) have been increasingly used as green electrolytes to electroplate a range of metals, alloys and compound semiconductors over the past few decades, due to their wide electrochemical window, high ionic conductivity, high solvation capacity, negligible vapor pressure and excellent thermal, chemical and electrochemical stability.4–6 However, these ILs are generally too expensive to be used in large-scale commercial applications. Furthermore, many of them are sensitive to moisture and are even made from non-biodegradable components.5–7
Research has continued to seek low-cost and greener alternatives to these ILs that may overcome their limitations. Among these are deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which are a new type of ionic liquids made by mixing a quaternary ammonium salt and a metal salt, a hydrated salt or a simple hydrogen bond donor, such as an alcohol, amide or carboxylic acid, as a complexing agent. This mixing reduces the melting points of the DESs significantly compared to those of their original precursors. DESs not only possess the common advantages of ionic liquids, but also overcome some disadvantages inherent to conventional ILs. An example is the DES formed from choline chloride and urea (commercially named Reline).8 Reline has been shown to have interesting properties that are similar to those of ILs, including a wide electrochemical window, high conductivity, negligible volatility and other unusual solvent properties. But, unlike other ILs, Reline is air and water stable and is made from biodegradable components. Choline chloride is a common component of numerous household and industrial products, while urea is a familiar fertilizer. More importantly, its low cost materials and easy synthesis make Reline a good candidate for electroplating in mass production.
Here we report an electrodeposition process based on Reline to fabricate kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorber film, which is regarded as one of the most promising candidates for the next generation of commercial solar cells since it is a non-toxic material containing earth-abundant elements. To date, the best device efficiency of a CZTS thin film solar cell fabricated by an electrochemical approach in aqueous solution showed an efficiency of 8.0%.9 Compared with aqueous solutions, coatings electrodeposited using DESs have better mechanical properties due to negligible hydrogen embrittlement, which can be explained by their wide potential windows. In addition, the complexation of metals by ionic liquids offers the chance to avoid more highly toxic complexing agents in aqueous solutions, which may cause environmental pollution. C. P. Chan et al. reported a route to co-deposit a Cu–Zn–Sn alloy using the DES containing choline chloride and ethylene glycol (trade name: Ethaline), followed by post sulfurization to form CZTS films.10 However, the long-term electrochemical stability of Ethaline is poor due to electrolysis, and several toxic decomposition products of Ethaline, such as 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane and a range of chlorinated products like chloromethane, dichloromethane and chloroform, could be detected. There is also no further report on the photovoltaic performance of the CZTS films electrodeposited in Ethaline. To fabricate higher quality CZTS films in a greener way, we chose Reline as the solvent to electrodeposit the CZTS films. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the electrodeposition of CZTS using Reline. After some optimization of plating parameters and annealing processes, high quality, dense, smooth CZTS polycrystalline films are produced. The glass/Mo/CZTS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO structure of the CZTS solar cell is then completed, and the device performance is characterized.
Experimental
The ionic liquids were prepared by mixing choline chloride (Sigma 99%) and urea (Aldrich 98%) at a molar ratio of 1:2. Anhydrous chloride salts of CuCl2 (Alfar 99.9%), SnCl2 (Alfar 99.9%) and ZnCl2 (Alfar 99.9%) were sequentially dissolved in Reline using the following steps. First, 5 mmol CuCl2 was dissolved in the ionic liquid at room temperature, under constant magnetic stirring, forming a deep yellow liquid. Second, SnCl2 (20 mmol) was dropped into the ionic liquid containing copper chloride, a step which changed the liquid's color immediately, from deep yellow to transparent in a few seconds. Then, 20 mmol ZnCl2 was added to the transparent ionic liquid with no color change. Cyclic voltammetry tests were measured and amperometric i–t curves were recorded at 65 °C without stirring using a potentio station (TatriplateCP, MPC, France). The Cu–Zn–Sn precursors were co-electrodeposited at −1.2 V. A three-electrode system was used, with a 150 nm copper layer which was evaporated onto Mo coated soda lime glass as the working electrode, a platinum (Pt) gauze as the counter electrode and a Pt wire as the reference electrode. N2 (99.999%) was employed to purge the electrolyte before electrodeposition. The post-annealing treatments were conducted in a N2 + H2S atmosphere (5%) in order to form stoichiometric CZTS. The precursor films were heated up to 550 °C rapidly, held at this temperature for 1 hour and then cooled down to room temperature naturally in a rapid thermal process (RTP) furnace. The CZTS absorber films were then processed into photovoltaic devices by chemical bath deposition of CdS, sputtering of i-ZnO and Al:ZnO, and evaporation of the Ni/Al contact grid.
The morphologies and compositions of the prepared CZTS film were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S5200) and X-ray fluorescence (Fischer XDV-XDD). X-ray diffraction (Shimadzu) analysis was performed on a diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 8° min−1 under operating conditions of 30 kV and 40 mA. Raman spectra were recorded using microscopic confocal Raman spectrometry (Labram HR 800) with an excitation of 514 nm laser light. An active cell area of 0.1 cm2 was defined by mechanical scribing along the edge of the Ni/Al grid. J–V data and power conversion efficiencies were obtained at room temperature under AM 1.5G illumination (1000 W m−2) from a solar simulator, which was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell device.
Results and discussion
The chlorocomplex anions of Cu(II), Zn(II) and Sn(II) in Reline are believed to exist as CuCl42−, ZnCl3−, SnCl3− and Sn2Cl5−.11,12 The color of the chlorocomplex anion of Cu(II) was observed to be deep yellow in Reline, while other chlorocomplex anions of Sn(II), Zn(II), Cu(I) and Sn(IV) were colorless. When SnCl2 was added to the ionic liquid containing CuCl2, the color of the ionic liquid changed from deep yellow to transparent, as shown in Fig. 1b and c. This change is due to the fact that Sn2+ was oxidized to Sn4+ and Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+, corresponding to the following reaction:132Cu2+ + Sn2+ → 2Cu+ + Sn4+

The electrochemical properties of the constituent metal elements of the kesterite family in Reline were studied before the co-electrodeposition of the Cu–Zn–Sn precursor thin films. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a 3-electrode system composed of Pt foil as the working electrode, Pt gauze as the counter electrode, and Pt wire as the reference electrodes at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The CV measurements were conducted after the open circuit voltage of the electrochemical cell was stabilized. As shown in Fig. 1e, the potential window of Reline ranges from −1.25 V to +1.25 V. This result is in accord with a previous study by A. P. Abbott.14Fig. 1f shows that the reduction peak potentials for Cu(II), Sn(II) and Zn(II) at the studied concentration are −0.37, −0.68 and −1.2 V, respectively, while the anodic peak potentials are 0.02, −0.4 and −1.0 V, respectively. Fig. 1f also shows that the reduction potentials for Cu(II), Sn(II) and Zn(II) are −0.26, −0.58, −1.0 V, respectively. These peaks are not only in the electrochemically stable region of Reline, but they area also closer together in Reline than those in water, which are 0.34 V, −0.14 V, and −0.76 V for Cu(II), Sn(II) and Zn(II) ions, respectively, versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) in 1 M aqueous solution at 25 °C. The co-electrodeposition of the three metal elements in Reline tends to be easier without any other additives.

Fig. 2a and b present surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn precursor film and the sulfurized CZTS film. The electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn precursor film exhibits a granular surface morphology. The sulfurized CZTS film shows a flat and compact surface morphology free of pinholes and microcracks. The average grain size of the sulfurized CZTS film was estimated to be over 500 nm from the morphological studies (Fig. 2b). The XRD pattern (Fig. 2c) confirms that the co-deposited Cu–Zn–Sn precursor film contains mainly elemental Cu, Zn and Sn phases. According to JCPDS card no. 26-0575, the main diffraction peaks for the sulfurized CZTS film, apart from the peaks arising from the Mo-coated substrate, are assigned to the (112), (220) and (312) peaks at 28.51°, 47.36° and 56.17°, respectively, indicating that the CZTS film has a kesterite crystal structure with a preferred orientation of (112). The (112) peak is sharp and no extra peaks are found, indicating the good crystallinity and high level of phase purity of the sulfurized CZTS film. The Raman spectrum of the sulfurized CZTS film (Fig. 2d) also shows a single tetragonal CZTS phase with a strong peak at 338 cm−1 and three weak peaks at 254, 292 and 371 cm−1.15

The non-stoichiometry of compound semiconductors always correlates with their electrical properties. For high-efficiency CZTS solar cells, there is an empirical rule that the Cu:(Zn + Sn) and Zn:Sn atomic ratios should lie in the range of 0.75–1 and 1–1.25, respectively.16–19 XRF measurements (Table 1) indicate that the Cu:(Zn + Sn) and Zn:Sn ratios are 0.67 and 1.13, respectively, for the precursor films, and 0.77 and 1.21 for the sulfurized CZTS films. The Cu:(Zn + Sn) and Zn:Sn ratios of the CZTS films are slightly higher than those of the precursor film, which is attributed to the loss of Sn during sulfurization.20

Fig. 3 shows the J–V characteristics of the best-performing ionic-liquid electrodeposited CZTS solar cell. From this data, we derive a 3.87% conversion efficiency with a photocurrent of 15.6 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 512 mV and a fill factor of 0.48. From the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shown in Fig. 3 inset, the grain size of the CZTS film is comparable with the thickness of the CZTS film, which is considered to be beneficial for carrier transport.21

Fig. 4 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve for the ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterojunction solar cell. The EQE starts increasing slowly at 800 nm, which is related to the optical absorption of the CZTS absorber, reaches a maximum value of 68% at 535 nm, and then drops rapidly at about 400 nm due to the cut-off of the AZO window layer. The optical absorption coefficient, α, of the CZTS film has a close relationship with the EQE value of CZTS, according to the equation22,23 EQE = 1 − exp(αW), where W is the width of the space charge region. The incident photon energy (hν) and the optical bandgap energy (Eg) are related to the optical absorption coefficient α by applying the Tauc model, αhν = D(hν − Eg)n, where D is a constant and n is 1/2 for a direct transition.23,24 Some experimental results and calculations of the electronic band structure of CZTS have revealed a direct bandgap.25,26 Thus, by plotting (hν ln(1 − EQE))2 against hν (shown in the inset of Fig. 4) and by extrapolating the linear portion of the absorption edge to find the intercept with the energy axis, a band gap of 1.46 eV is obtained for the CZTS film, a result which is in good agreement with data reported elsewhere.27

The diode parameters of the shunt conductance G, the series resistance R, the ideality factor A, and the saturation current density Jo can be further extracted from the J–V curve shown. A shunt conductance G of 4.87 mS cm−2 is calculated from the derivative dV/dJ against V near Jsc after the J–V curve was smoothed to reduce some noise. The series resistance R = 1.92 Ω cm2, the ideality factor A = 3.2, and the saturation current density Jo = 6.8 × 10−2 mA cm−2 were further determined by using a set of plots (Fig. S2†) according to the diode equations.28 The high series resistance R may mainly derive from CZTS–Mo interface resistance and electrode resistance. In comparison to previously published results of high-efficiency CZTS devices,21,29 our ideality factors are also slightly higher. For the record IBM device, the diode ideality factor is as low as 1.3.21 Moreover, the saturation current densities of our device are two orders of magnitude higher than those of the IBM devices.29 The ideality factor A of our CZTS cell greatly affects the open circuit voltage and fill factor, and thus the efficiency. The ideality factor A can be associated with recombination mechanisms of CZTS devices. A value of A > 2 implies stronger SCR recombination, or that the tunneling enhanced interface recombination would be the dominant limiting factor.30 The high Jo value in our case also correlates with the high A value or high recombination losses. Therefore, further work should be done to decrease recombination losses and series resistance, thus resulting in a higher efficiency.
Conclusions
This work shows that Reline is a green and low cost electrolyte to electrodeposit Cu–Zn–Sn precursor thin films. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicate that the electrodeposition in Reline is much easier and is free of other complexing agents compared to conventional electrodeposition in aqueous solution, and offers the promise of a low-cost, mass-produced solar technology. Pure phase CZTS films with controlled composition and large grain size have been successfully obtained by sulfurizing the electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn precursor films. With this approach we have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 3.87%. The EQE curve indicates that the CZTS absorber has an optical band gap of 1.46 eV. Further improvements in conversion efficiency are expected by extending the absorption range by substituting S with Se, and by decreasing the recombination losses and series resistance of the solar cells.
