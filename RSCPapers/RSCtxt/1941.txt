    , Accepted 20th March 2021First published on 10th April 2021AbstractA series of carbon-doped solid solutions of ceria bismuth oxide (CBO) were prepared by a solid solution method. Highly porous solid solutions crystallized in a fluorite phase and C-doped samples exhibited an enhanced band-gap and reduced lattice cell constants. Their photocatalytic activity was observed in terms of H2 and O2 production via water splitting. The maximum hydrogen production was observed for a 6% C-doped solid solution in methanolic solution, i.e. 5413.10 mmol H2 g−1 h−1 under 300 W Xe light irradiation. The 6% C-doped solid solution released maximum O2 (193.80 μmol O2 h−1 g−1) and H2 (323.00 μmol H2 h−1 g−1) from pure water under exposure to real sunlight due to the highly ordered atomic arrangement, high porosity, high crystallinity, low oxygen vacancies, and high OH-group concentration in the lattice.
Introduction
Energy is instrumental for all the developments seen on Earth. Currently, we are satisfying our energy needs from carbonaceous fuels, which liberate greenhouse gases (GHGs) on their use. These GHGs are awful footprints of development on Mother Earth that can be diluted when carbonaceous fuel is replaced with carbon-free fuels. Therefore, we all are looking forward to the clean and renewable energy sources that can replace the present conventional fossil energy sources, as clean fuels or energy carriers. When we are thinking about carbon-free fuel, then hydrogen is the first name to come to mind, which can be produced by the breaking of water. Hydrogen is rated as the best available clean fuel and energy carrier on its merits, such as high energy density (142 kJ kg−1), high fuel efficiency (75%), heating value (52000 Btu per lb), and widest range of flammability (4–75%). In contrast to current hydrogen generation practices (steam reforming of methane), the uses of solar energy and zero-carbon fuel (water) with a suitable photocatalyst is an eco-benign way to generate hydrogen. A wide variety of photocatalytic materials are being tested for hydrogen generation via water splitting. Unfortunately, most of them have failed on one or more criteria: i.e. stability in water/light, cost, and efficiency (>10%). Oxide semiconductors are the prime class of photocatalysts (TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, BiVO4, etc.) that are utilized for water cleavage due to their low cost and good stability in water and sunlight. But most of the oxides are wide band-gap materials, which limits their light harvesting power to the UV region or to some extent up to the visible region of sunlight. There are many ways to engineer the band gap of oxides: i.e. changes in shape, size, and morphology, doping (transition/rare earth-metals or non-metals), making a solid solution, and many more. The most abundant rare-earth metal oxide (∼0.0046 wt% of the Earth's crust), cerium oxide1 is very useful for photocatalysis along with other applications, such as high-storage capacitors, buffering layers in conductors, fuel cells, sensors, UV blockers, optoelectronic devices, and many more.2–7 Due to the superb properties of ceria, i.e. matching crystal structure and high dielectric constant (ε = 26) than silicon,8 strong reducing power, long lifetime of charge carriers with respect to TiO2, higher oxygen mobility, and no phase transition (fluorite structure) observed by ion exchange from Ce4+ (ionic radius 0.097 nm) to Ce3+ (ionic radius 0.114 nm).9 Therefore, ceria has been selected for further modification by making its solid solution.10 Here, we take cerium oxide (Ce2O3Eg = 2.40 eV; CeO2Eg = 3.20 eV) and bismuth oxide (Eg = 2.89 eV) to make a solid solution, ceria bismuth oxide (CBO) and its carbon-doped versions, for this study. Semiconductor Bi2O3 (ionic radius of Bi3+ = 0.103 nm) is an appealing substance11 because of its excellent optical and electrical properties, such as wide band-gap (Eg = 2.85 eV), high refractive index (δBi2O3 = 2.90),12 high dielectric permittivity (εr = 190), nonlinearity (200 times greater than SiO2), good photoconductivity (1.0 S cm−1), remarkable photoluminescence,13 high polarisability of the cationic lattice, oxide ion mobility, and ultrafast optical transmission. There are a few outstanding examples of solid solutions which have been used for hydrogen production from water: ZnO:GaN14 (2.58–2.76 eV; 58 (H2) and 29 (O2) μmol h−1 under UV irradiation), Cd1−xZnxS (Eg = 2.20–3.12 eV; 16320 (H2) and 2007 (H2) μmol g−1 h−1 under UV and visible light, respectively),15 (Zn0.95Cu0.05)0.6Cd0.4S (4150.1 μmol H2 g−1 h−1),16 BiYWO6 (Eg = 2.71 eV, 12.3 H2 μmol and 5.6 O2 μmol, respectively),17 (CuGa1−yIny)1−xZn2xS2 (Eg = 1.4–1.9 eV),18 Pt–CeO2/g-C3N4 (0.83 mmol H2 h−1 g−1),19 CeO2−xFe2O3 (x = 0.026–0.214; 0.97–1.80 H2 cm3 g−1),20 Ce1−xLixO2−δ (x = 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.10, 4.79 H2 mL g−1 for 2.5% Li),21 AgTaO3–SrTiO3 (∼215.2 H2 μmol h−1 (λ ≥ 250 nm) and ∼5.8 H2 μmol h−1 (λ ≥ 400 nm) under illumination).22 Usually, the reactivity of hydrogen production of the solid solutions could be improved by doping due to reduction in band gap, as reported for C–SnO2 (46.72 H2 μmol h−1 g−1),23 P-doped ZnxCd1−xS (419 H2 μmol h−1 g−1),24 N0.12–Ce0.3Zr0.7O1.88 (19 H2 μmol and 101.7 H2 μmol under visible light (λ > 420 nm) and UV-Vis light (λ > 300 nm), respectively)25 and Pt/N-doped CdIn2O4 (117.24 μmol h−1)26 and many more systems. But it is not necessary, therefore, band-gap narrowing was adopted for the solid solution by doping carbon to harvest the visible light of the Sun. Non-metal (C, B, N, and P) doping introduces an extra valance band layer on top of the O 2p layers of the oxides, resulting in a decrease in band gap. But in our case carbon doping did not decrease the band gap due to the high porosity of the solid solutions (Scheme 1). An increase in porosity leads to an increase in the surface area and local electron concentration due to the quantum confinement effect,27 which causes an increase in the band gap. That resulted in an increase in the number of active sites at the surface that tends to enhance the photoinduced charge carrier separation.

Experimental section
Materials
All reagents (such as Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), Bi(NO3)5·5H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), urea (Sigma-Aldrich), methanol, etc.) were employed herein as received without further purification. A Millipore (Merck) water purification system was used to obtain deionized water (resistance of 18.2 MΩ) for all experimental usages.
Methods

Synthesis of CBO. 
We had synthesized the carbon-doped solid solution CeO2:Bi2O3 (C-doped CBO)28,29 the first time by using a combustion method,30 in which a unimolecular mixture of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (white; 0.8086 g) and Bi(NO3)5·5H2O (white; 1.0855 g) was fired in the presence of urea (2.00 g, acting as the fuel) at different synthesis temperatures i.e. 300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C for 8 h. The above reaction resulted in a porous yellow colored solid. A gradual increase in synthesis temperature up to 500 °C fixed the solid solution's color; afterwards a decrease in color fastness along with a phase change were observed with an increase in temperature (up to 900 °C), as depicted in Fig. S1(a).†


Synthesis of carbon-doped CBO. 
Carbon doping of CBO was done by mixing Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Bi(NO3)5·5H2O in a unimolecular mixture along with glucose in varying weight percentages (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10%) and fuel (urea) in twice the amount of the above mixture and the solid mixture was fired at a temperature of 300 °C for 8 h. The as-obtained fluffy yellow-colored compounds were well ground before being applied for characterization or for water splitting applications.


Synthesis of 5% Pt-loaded carbon-doped CBO. 
A solid solution of C-CBO (0.30 g) was mixed with hexahydrated chloroplatinic acid (0.0015 g) and 5 mL of distilled water in a Petri dish at 60 °C with continuous manual stirring until the sample was completely dried. Afterwards the sample was dried at 60 °C overnight before being used for water splitting.


Characterization and analysis. 
A scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL, JEM 2100) situated at MNIT, Jaipur, India, was used to take SEM images and the corresponding EDX profiles of the series of C-doped CBO solid solutions. High resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images were taken with an electron microscope (JEOL, JEM 2100F with an accelerating potential of 200 kV) at IIT Mumbai, India. An X-ray diffraction study of the synthesized systems was observed by using a diffractometer (Rikagu Ultima IV type II model, IIT Kanpur, India) in the range of 2θ = 5–60° with a 45 mA current supply. All investigations were made by using a copper target (CuKα radiation) and an ultrafast detector in reflection mode. The refinement of the XRD patterns was done using the software FullProf.2k (Version 6.10). A UV-Vis NIR spectrophotometer (bench-top Model, Perkin Elmer, Lambda 750, USA) situated at MNIT, Jaipur with double-beam and double-monochromatic provision was used for analyzing the bonding nature of the studied system. FTIR spectra of the samples were observed with an IR spectroscope (PerkinElmer, G-FTIR) at MNIT, Jaipur, India. A spectrofluorometer (Horiba, Jobin Yvon, Fluorolog-3) at IIT Mumbai, India was used to take steady-state PL emission spectra at 336 nm excitation.
An ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study was performed at MNIT, Jaipur for the core level Ce 4f XPS spectra (881, 883, 884, 889, 896, 898, 901, 903, 907 and 917 eV), Bi 3d XPS spectra (157, 158, 163, and 164 eV), C 1s XPS spectra (284 eV) and O 1s XPS spectra (532 eV), respectively. XPS spectra were observed with an ultrahigh vacuum (5 × 10−11 Torr) spectrophotometer (Omicron Multiprobe Surface Analysis System, Germany, Gmbh) at MNIT Jaipur, India by using an MgKα radiation source (with energy of 1253.6 eV) for XPS data acquisition. The binding energy calibration of the XPS spectrum was done by taking standard Au 4f7/2 emission of energy resolution of ≈0.9 eV FWHM on Au 4f7/2 with 20 eV pass energy. The XPS core level data was analyzed by performing carbon corrections (284.6 eV) with reference to the Fermi energy.


Photocatalytic hydrogen production. 
A powder of the solid solution (0.30 g) was stirred well in 120 mL of aqueous methanol (20% CH3OH of pH = 7.0) or in pure distilled water that was kept in a reaction cell (volume ∼150 mL, Pyrex glass) with a water jacket (to maintain the reaction temperature at 25 °C). The reaction cell was air sealed with a rubber septum and a plastic wire lock. The suspensions of solid solutions were purged with Ar gas for 1 h by keeping the cell pressure at 1 atmosphere to expel the air. Subsequently, the suspension was exposed to a 300 W Xe lamp (>420 nm, light intensity 1 × 1022 photons per hour Xe lamp-HX1, ISS-Model PE300UV) or real sunlight (time: 10.00 am to 4.00 pm from 25 January 2021 to 26 February 2021 at the University of Kota campus). Hydrogen and oxygen gases generated as a result of all photocatalytic reactions, were monitored for 3 h under 300 W Xe light and for 4 h for exposure to real sunlight. As it was produced, the hydrogen gas was collected over an inverted gas collection graduated bottle by displacement of water from a water fill. The gaseous products were subjected to testing with a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, TCD and a molecular sieve of 5 Å columns).

Results and discussion
Initially, the solid solution was prepared by firing a unimolecular mixture of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Bi(NO3)5·5H2O with a doubled amount of urea (taken as fuel) for 8 h by varying the temperature (300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C). The carbon-doped solid solutions (C-doped CBO) were prepared by varying the carbon amount (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%) in the combustion of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Bi(NO3)5·5H2O along with urea and glucose at 300 °C for 8 h. The mechanism for the formation of C-doped solid solutions (with their components CeO2/Ce2O3, and Bi2O3) is proposed on the basis of the experimental results (obtained from the XRD, SEM, EDX supported by SEM, and XPS analyses) as shown by eqn (1)–(8). Ce(NO3)3·6H2O(s) → Ce3+ + 3NO3− + 6H2O(1) Bi(NO3)5·5H2O(s) → Bi5+ +5NO3− + 5H2O(2) NH2CONH2 + H2O → 2NH3↑ + CO2↑(3) 2NH3↑ + H2O↑ → NH4+ + OH−(4) Ce3+ + 4OH− → Ce(OH)4 → CeO2 + 2H2O(5) 2CeO2 + H2↑ → Ce2O3 + H2O(6) 2Bi5+ +10OH− → 2Bi(OH)5 → Bi2O3 + 2H2O(7) 4Bi(OH)5 → 2Bi2O3 + 10H2O + 2O2↑(8)
Moreover, the following eqn (9) and (12) are responsible for the increasing amount of Ce2O3 and the formation of pure Bi in the compound by introducing carbon as the dopant to CBO. 4CeO2(s) + C(s) → 2Ce2O3(s) + CO2↑ (1.927 V, MP)(9) 2Bi2O3(s) + 3C(s) → 4Bi(s) + 3CO2↑ (+0.587 V, P)(10) 2Ce2O3(s) + 3C(s) → 4Ce(s) + 3CO2↑ (−2.128 V, LP)(11) C + O2 → CO2 + 94, 200 kcal mol−1 (−0.207 V, LP)(12)where, MP = most probable, P = probable, and LP = least probable reactions.
The FE-SEM study (Fig. S2(i) to (vi)†) of the solid solutions illustrated the surface morphology and corresponding EDX mapping (Fig. 1) profile used to detect their percentage elemental composition (Ce, Bi, O, and C). Elemental compositions of the solid solutions with their respective molecular formula are derived from EDX, and are given in Table 1.

Table 1 indicates the effect of increasing carbon-doping in the solid solution on the elemental proportion of cerium (increase) and bismuth (decrease) in the solid solution up to 6% carbon doping (with maximum Ce ∼63.35%, minimum oxygen ∼12.69% and maximum Ce3+ ∼14.10 %); after this both metal contents started to decrease. This happened because of carbon being positioned above hydrogen and both metals, i.e. Bi and Ce, in the chemical reactivity series. Therefore, carbon acts as a strong reducing agent in solid reactions. Due to its good reducing property at higher temperatures, carbon absorbs the surface oxygen of oxides and is desorbed as CO or CO2 gases (C/CO2E° = −0.207 V).31 Carbon might reduce CeO2 and Bi2O3 to Ce2O3 and Bi, respectively, and oxidize itself as CO/CO2, as illustrated by eqn (10) and (11). Experimental proof of increasing Ce3+ and decreasing Ce4+ ion concentrations and decreasing Bi3+ content with increasing C-content in the sample is also supported by the UV-Vis and XPS data (Tables S2 and S3†). The carbon doping supported a decrease in bismuth and oxygen concentrations with an increasing carbon percentage in the solid solution.
The particle size of the studied samples was estimated from the SEM images (Fig. S2†), and was found to be bigger than the particle size observed from XRD due to the high porosity of the samples. The surface morphology of the undoped sample appeared in the form of a cluster of needle-like structures (25.00 nm wide and 355.77 nm long) (looking like glass wool). Furthermore, the 2% carbon-doped CBO exhibited glass cotton-like structures with increased crystallinity and reduced particle size (312.50–453.12 nm with 23.80 nm wide × 500 nm long needle-like structures). Thereafter, thread-like structures (333.33 nm) along with cotton-like structures without holes on the surface were revealed for the 4% C-doped CBO. Whereas the 6% C-doped CBO samples exhibited some pits/holes on the catalytic surface of size ∼500 nm along with a layered structure of size 263.15–421.05 nm. A fused (or gelatinous) structure with holes and without needle/plate-like structures was found for 8% C-doped CBO and 10% C-doped CBO samples. An increase in carbon doping percentage initially increases the particle size (up to 6% C-doped CBO); then it decreases.
HRTEM images and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the solid solutions are shown in Fig. S3(I) to (VI).† The images showed that the solid solutions have crystalline and amorphous parts, which was further confirmed by their corresponding SAED patterns. The TEM images of the pure sample reflected solid solution particles of size (∼3–6 nm) enveloped by a solid gelatinous part (with voids/particle size ∼7–9 nm) of the solid solution without the presence of any 1D artefacts. Ring-SAED patterns were obtained for pure CBO due to the presence of the many crystallites in the system, but the C-doped CBO samples show ring and spot diffraction patterns together, which are associated with the polycrystalline and crystalline parts of the C-doped solid solutions. The 2% C-doped CBO samples contains around 6 × 36.25 nm (w × h) long thread-shaped crystals grown along the 111 plane (d spacing = 0.31 nm) and 25–48 nm sized porous particles of irregular shape along with the voids. The 6.5 × 62 nm (w × h) long thread-shaped structures of 42–58 nm sized particles with voids (∼7–9 nm) are found for the 4% C-doped CBO sample. Two-dimensional rectangular sheets, irregularly shaped particles (∼7 × 8 nm), and cone-rolls of square sheets with a high concentration of voids (∼7–9 nm) are observed for 6% C-doped CBO along with the spot diffraction patterns with regular square arrangements of spots. The 8% and 10% C-doped CBO samples exhibited rod and particle shaped features that were enveloped in gelatinous-type structures, resulting in ring and regularly arranged spot diffraction (regular interlayer distances = 1.90 nm and 0.65 nm, respectively) patterns. Moreover, the spot-SAED patterns of 2%, 4% and 6% C-doped CBO illustrated the presence of the distorted face-centered cubic phase with multiple orientations. The voids present in all studied samples are responsible for their porosity.
The XRD patterns were observed for the series of as-obtained solid solutions of CBO and their carbon-doped versions with 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% amounts of carbon doping (Fig. 2a and S1c and d†). Carbon doping did not change the phase of the samples, but a small red shift in diffraction patterns was observed due to the exchange of a big Bi atom (1.03 Å) with a carbon atom (0.70 Å) during solid solution formation. On careful observation, the 2θ diffraction peaks can be noticed at 28.35° (111), 32.85° (200), 47.14° (220), 55.92° (311), 58.65° (222), combined peaks (400), (331) and (420) and a hump between 75–80° and 87.672° (422) angles that matched well with the standard JCPDS card no. 34-0394 of cerium oxide (the fluorite type face-centered cubic structure of the space group of Fmm (225) with lattice parameters: a = b = c = 5.4201 Å at z = 4, density = 7.22 g cm−2). The small particle size of the pure CBO (synthesized at 300 °C) is associated with high porosity and broad diffraction peaks (Fig. 2a). Rietveld refinement of pristine CBO (Fig. 2b) and its carbon-doped versions (Fig. S4 and Table S1†) was done by using the software FullProf.2k (Version 6.10). The measured value of the cell constant (a) gradually decreases with an increasing amount of doped carbon that proves the doped carbon goes into the solid solution's lattice (Table S1†). The pure solid solution of CBO displayed the cell parameters a = 5.4486 (21) Å, z = 4, and volume = 161.75(11) Å3, with space group: Fm3m (number: 225) along with the refinement parameters (R-factors: Rp = 3.47, Rwp = 4.45, Rexp = 4.11 and χ2 = 1.17) in the acceptable range. The raw XRD data was used in the software Crystal 3.1 to exhibit the atomic positions of elements in the lattice, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2b and S4.† The crystallinity of the solid solutions was observed by using the following formula in eqn (13).32 Crt = (I111 − Iam) × 100/I111 (%)(13)where Crt = the relative crystallinity (as a percentage); I111 = the highest intensity of the (111) diffraction angle of the crystal lattice (arbitrary unit; au) and Iam = the scattering strength diffracted by the non-crystalline (amorphous) environment (arbitrary unit; au).

The observed profile (black solid line), calculated profiles (dotted red solid lines) and difference (blue solid line) between the observed value and the calculated value are shown. The short vertical marks represent Bragg diffractions. The lower curve is the difference plot. In the inset, the crystal structure of CBO-300 is displayed, where the green balls, blue balls, yellow balls, red balls, and sea-green balls represent Ce, Bi, O(0.296), O(0.25) and O(0.296) atoms, respectively. 
The X-ray profile was also used to determine the dislocation density (δ) of the sample using the following expression:33 (14)where broadening of the diffraction line, i.e. the full width at half its maximum intensity, is β (radian), Bragg's diffraction angle is θ (degree), lattice constant is a (nm), and particle size is D (nm). This variation in dislocation density is related to the enhanced order in the crystal structure.34

Table 2 reveals that the effect of carbon doping on the crystallinity of the studied samples was enhanced (from 82.85% to ∼95%) and the dislocation density decreased by ten times (from 0.139 to ∼0.011) and the particle size increased by more than four times (43.24 nm to 177.02 nm, calculated by the Scherrer formula). The parameters presented in Table 2 indicated the more regular arrangement in the carbon-doped samples over the undoped samples. The results also confirmed that the 6% C-doped CBO showed the minimum dislocation density, meaning the sample had a highly regular arrangement in comparison to the rest of the studied samples. Eqn (15) is used to determine the porosity of the systems by using the calculated XRD density (proposed by Smith and Vijn) and bulk density of pure CeO2 (7.22 g cm−2).35 (15)where XRD density , bulk density ρb = m/V, Mw = molecular weight, NA = Avogadro number, a = lattice constant, and n = number of lattice points of each unit cell.

UV-Vis spectra of the as-prepared solid solutions (i.e. CBO and C-doped CBO), shown in Fig. 3a and b, are used to calculate the band gap and to observe the effect of carbon doping on charge transfer. Porosity leads to a blue shift in the absorption edge of the carbon-doped solid solution in compared to the pure sample, as exhibited in Fig. 3a.36 The characteristic feature of the carbon-doped solid solutions, i.e. a considerable amount of porosity,37,38 might be inherited from the growth mechanism (from the evolution of the number of gaseous products, i.e. CO2, H2, NH3, etc., in the synthesis). A single UV-Vis spectral peak was found for all the studied samples, and it was Gaussian fitted and deconvoluted into four main peaks, positioned around: 200 nm, 259 nm, 318 nm, and 330–450 nm, as shown in Fig. 5Sa–f and Table S2.† The deconvoluted peak at 200.00 nm belongs to the Ce3+ ion. The peak around 259.00 nm is assigned to the carbonaceous interface that supports the charge transfer from O2− to ceria/bismuth ions,39 which is absent from the pure CBO solid solution. The peaks around 318.64 nm represent the Ce4+ state of ceria.39 Hence, the study supported the existence of the dual oxidation states (Ce3+ and Ce4+) of cerium. A strong peak between 330 and 450 nm (positioned at 449.15 nm) is attributed to an excitonic absorption and dedicated to the presence of the 3+ valency of bismuth.40–44 Pure CBO represents the three deconvoluted peaks at 200.00 nm (Ce3+), 318.64 nm (Ce4+), and 449.15 nm (Bi3+). The carbon doping of CBO replacement of the bigger ions (Ce3+ (0.114 nm)/Ce4+ (0.097 nm) and Bi3+ (0.103 nm)) with small carbon (0.70 nm) atoms causes the blue shift in the peaks. This charge transfer peak originated for the carbon-doped samples by employing the strong reducing capacity of the carbon in the lattice through an effective interface for producing Ce3+ and Bi from Ce4+ and Bi3+ ions through charge transfer, respectively.39 That creates the oxygen vacancies at the junction of two phases (Ce4+ → Ce3+, Bi3+ → Bi).45 The band at 259 nm is attributed to the charge transfer by transition from O2− to Ce4+.46 The reported band gap of the bulk ceria is 3.20 eV47,48 and the absorption coefficient is used to determine the band gap of the studied samples. However, the absorption coefficient, α(v), can be determined at the different wavelengths using the following relation (eqn (16)).49 (16)where λ is the wavelength and k is a wave vector. The effect of a change in α(v) on the wavelength (λ) is shown by eqn (16) and illustrated in Fig. 3b. The absorption coefficient (α(v)) and optical band gap energy (Eg) of the materials are related by the following Tauc eqn (17),50 α(v)hv = B(hv − Eg)r(17)where B is an energy-independent constant and r is a constant that is determined by the type of optical transition. The r can have different values, 1/3, 1/2, 2, and 3, corresponding to direct-forbidden, direct-allowed, indirect-allowed, and indirect-forbidden transitions, respectively.50 The band gaps of the series of carbon-doped solid solutions are calculated using Tauc's plot via direct inter-bands. The doped compounds showed a higher direct band gap (2.59–2.79 eV) than the parent compound (2.56 eV), as shown in Fig. 3b and Table S2.† The experimental indirect band-gap of the pure CBO sample is Eg = 2.56 eV (Fig. 3b) with respect to the band gap of bulk ceria (CeO2 (Eg = 3.20 eV)/Ce2O3 (2.40 eV)), and Bi2O3 (2.89 eV). On carbon doping, the band gap of the solid solutions is expected to decrease due to the placement of the higher valance band energy levels of C 2s electrons over the O 2p level of CBO. But in the present case the band gap of CBO increases with carbon doping due to the high porosity of the synthesized material.

The chemical bonding of the solid solutions can be studied by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 4). Four main FTIR spectral bands were observed for the solid solutions at wavenumbers (i) 3422–3430 cm−1 (physically adsorbed water on CeO2), (ii) 1560–1601 cm−1 (interfacial water) belonging to the water stretching and bending vibration modes of physically adsorbed water (O–H) molecules, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 4.51 The intensive FTIR band at (iii) 1384 cm−1 could be due to the formation of a carbonate ion, a result of the synthesis process being carried out in an ambient atmosphere with urea and glucose.52 (iv) One absorption band observed between the wavenumbers 530 cm−1 and 542 cm−1 belonged to the vibrations of Bi–O bands in the BiO6 octahedral unit53–55 and Ce–O(III) vibrations.56
 Fig. 4  FTIR spectra of the carbon-doped CBO solid solutions (with carbon doping of 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%). 
Besides the above main peaks a few very small-sized satellites peaks were also observed in the frequency ranges (i) 2922–2962 cm−1, (ii) 2852–2892 cm−1, (iii) 1120 cm−1 and 1042–1068 cm−1 and (iv) 846 cm−1. Adsorption was located in the range 3100−2500 cm−1 because of alcohol and carboxylic acid stretching. Very small bands at 2922–2962 cm−1 and 2852–2892 cm−1 were assigned to the in-phase and out-of-phase stretching of non-equivalent water molecules, respectively. The 1120 cm−1 band was attributed to the vibrational mode of OHad species (adsorbed on the surface of the solid solution and denoted as CBO–OHad).57–59 A band at 846 cm−1 was assigned to Bi–O vibration in BiO3 polyhedral units.60,61
The PL emission peaks observed at an excitation wavelength of 336 nm for the pristine and carbon-doped samples are shown in Fig. 5a to f and in Table 3. The three prominent PL emission deconvoluted peaks were positioned at 371–386 nm, 411 nm, 471–503 nm. The blue shift in the PL emission peaks of C-doped CBO solid solutions confirms the presence of carbon in the lattice of CBO. The Gaussian peak fit profiles of these solid solutions are presented in Fig. 5a–f. The emission peak present in the ultra-violet region at 371–386 nm is assigned to near-band-edge (NBE) excitonic emission. That percentage decreased up to 6% C-doped samples; then it increased. The violet/blue light emission peak centered at 411 nm may be due to charge transitions between the Ce 4f band and the O 2p valance band of the solid solution through the hopping of electrons from O 2p to Ce 4f and the major violet band may be ascribed to the V++ → Ce3+ 4f1 transitions.62 The percentage of this peak increased up to the 6% C-doped compound; then it started decreasing. The blue-green emissions are present at 490–520 nm (resulting from V+* → F+ transitions), attributed to dislocations or oxygen defects.63 Localization of the energy levels between the Ce 4f band and the O 2p band is due to defects, which could lead to wider emission bands.64 An oxygen vacancy, VO, can trap two electrons, and after trapping it is conventionally known as the F0 state. Subsequently, the F0 state (fully occupied state) can be converted into the F+ state (partially occupied state) by the loss of one electron and further converted to the F++ state (without any localized electrons, acting as an electron trap) by losing one more electron.65 The F+* and F0* states (close to the CB) are the excited states of the F0 and F+ states (close to the VB) and are empty states and located within the bandgap. The transition between the above oxygen vacancies caused the Stokes-shifted broad PL emission peak shown in Fig. 5g.66,67 The XPS study also hints at the presence of Ce4+–V0–Ce3+ or Ce4+–V0–Bi3+ defects.68 These defect states are prone to being accidental recombination sites for holes (due to Ce3+) and electrons (V0 sites).69 Such defects show a Stokes-shifted broad luminescence.67,70 Carbon incorporation in the solid solution may induce Ce4+ → Ce3+ conversion that might increase VO concentration at the surface and grain boundaries. They can work as trapping centers and nonradiative recombination centers, resulting in an increase in emission intensity.65,71 It was found that pristine CBO showed a prominent excitonic emission peak that got diluted with increasing carbon doping up to 6% and subsequently increased with increasing carbon content. Moreover, the minimum PL emission intensity of the 6% C-doped solid solution along with the highest 413.15 nm peak, in comparison to the rest of the studied samples, suggested the minimum rate of recombination process for the 6% C-doped solid solution that may facilitate higher hydrogen production activity for water splitting.

The core-level XPS survey spectra of Ce 3d, Bi 4f, O 1s, and C 1s were recorded and are shown Fig. S6,† where the binding energy scale of all the spectra was calibrated by taking the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as a ref. 72. Gaussian fitted core level XPS spectra of Ce 3d, Bi 4f, C1s, and O 1s were used to estimate the various electronic state contributions. Fig. 6a to f represent the Ce 3d core level XPS spectra of the solid solutions. The Ce 3d peaks for the samples display complex spectra due to the coexistence of multiple oxidation states of Ce ions and hybridization between the outer Ce 4f and O 2p states. The Ce 3d satellite structures derive mainly from the nonmetallic part/ligand to metal charge transfer transitions, i.e. coupled excitations of the O 2p to metal charge transfer type (O 2p → Ce 4f transitions). These spectra were characterized by the complex features that are related to the final occupation of states of the 4f level of Ce.73–76 Stoichiometric defects (x) related to the oxygen vacancies and their mobility on the oxide surface are of great importance for redox reactions of gases and metal oxides with multiple oxidation states, oxygen storage materials, and usage in catalytic gas exhaust after treatment, and were calculated by using the Ce 3d XPS study.

The Ce 3d spectrum comprised two multiplets, i.e. v and u, that correspond to the spin–orbit splitting core orbitals 3d5/2 and 3d3/2. The spin–orbit splitting energy for the respective solid solutions are: 17.32, 17.94, 18.03, 17.97, 18.86, and 18.86 eV. The splitting energies corresponding to the two main features with four peaks corresponding to the pairs of spin–orbit doublets that identified the Ce oxidation states Ce(III) and Ce(IV) were found to be in good agreement with the reported values.77–80 The Ce 3d states are labeled as ‘u’ and ‘v’ due to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 spin–orbit coupling states. The peaks labeled vo, v′, uo, and u′ belong to Ce3+ ions, whereas the peaks v, v′′, v′′′ u, u′′, and u′′′ are characteristic peaks of Ce4+ ions, and their respective positions are shown in Table S3.† The two spin–orbit doublet states for Ce3+ ions, i.e. the lowest binding energy states uo (vo) and the highest binding energy states u′ (v′), arise due to the hybridization of the Ce 4f levels with the O 2p states that results in electronic transitions Ce (3d9 4f2) – O (2p5) and Ce (3d9 4f1) – O (2p6), respectively. This leads to the formation of a partially reduced Ce3+ state due to inter-conversion from Ce4+, which creates oxygen vacancies. The transitions Ce (3d94f2) → O (2p4) and Ce (3d94f1) → O (2p5) lead to the lowest binding energy states: u (v) and u′′ (v′′).81 The Ce (3d) XPS spectrum represents the coexistence of both Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states for Ce ions, indicating that the surface of the sample is not fully oxidized. The highest binding energy peaks u′′′ (v′′′) are the result of electronic transition from Ce (3d94f0) to O (2p6) states. Table S3† summarizes the core level binding energy of Ce (3d) and the positions of the deconvoluted peaks of all solid solutions. The surface concentrations of Ce3+ and Ce4+ for all the samples have been calculated using the following eqn (18) and (19):82 (18) (19)where ACe3+ = vo + v′ + uo + u′ and ACe4+ = v + v′′ + v′′′ + u + u′′ + u′′′ are the sums of the areas of Gaussian peaks of various final states. The relative concentration of Ce3+ ions has been calculated from the [Ce3+]/[Ce4+] ratio (as shown in Table S3†). The variation in carbon doping regulates the concentration of Ce3+ ions in the CBO samples because carbon acts as a strong reducing agent at high temperature.31 Therefore, an increase in carbon content in the sample leads to a gradual increase in the concentration of Ce3+, formed by the reduction of Ce4+ ions, and a gradual decrease in Ce4+ ions was observed. The concentration of Ce4+ cations initially became highest for 2% C-doped CBO and then decreased with doping carbon content in 4% C-doped CBO and then these Ce3+ concentrations were found to increase continuously with the amount of carbon.
The XPS spectra (Fig. 7 and S7a–f†) of the Bi 4f state of the solid solutions, exhibit a typical doublet character corresponding to the Bi 4f7/2 (∼163.57 eV) and Bi 4f5/2 (∼158.29 eV) core level electrons with a spin–orbit splitting energy of about 5.37 eV between Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 peaks. That splitting energy causes further splitting of Bi 4f7/2 (Bi2O3 and Bi-metal) and Bi 4f5/2 peaks (Bi2O3 and Bi-metal) as doublets. The % Bi2O3 and % Bi metal amounts in solid solutions are illustrated in Table 4 and the deconvoluted Gaussian peaks of Bi 4f XPS spectra are exhibited in Fig. S4a–f.† The deconvolution of Bi 4f XPS spectra exhibits the presence of the two bismuth species, assigned to different binding energies, which match well with the reported values.83–86 The Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 peaks situated around the binding energies (pure CBO) of 157.49 and 163.41 eV are assigned to the Bi3+ state of Bi2O3.87 Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 peaks (pure CBO) located around 158.80 and 164.11 eV arise from the Bi0 (metal) contribution. The binding energies of the carbon-doped solid solutions fluctuate from the pure compound's Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 positions. However, compared to the pure sample, both 4f peaks show a red shift on increasing the carbon-doping content in solid solutions. This indicated the electron transfer from Bi to Ce atoms and strong interaction of Bi with the CeO2 host lattice. It is also suggested that some of the lattice oxygen atoms were replaced by carbon atoms. Thus, C doping led to a decrease in electron density on Bi due to the lower electronegativity of carbon compared to oxygen.88,89 However, the decrease in peak intensity observed with an increasing full width at half maximum [FWHM] with increasing carbon doping in the host matrix of CBO shows that after a certain limit (6% C doping) the incorporation of C atoms might not enter into the lattice and may go to other sites, like interstitials or on grain boundaries or be deposited on the surface.

The O 1s XPS core level deconvoluted spectra with three components are presented in Fig. 8a–f. The first component at ∼527.7–529.3 eV represents the O2− ions present in the solid solution lattice, termed lattice oxygen [OL]; the second peak at ∼529.3–530.6 eV appears to be due to the conversion of CeO2 into Ce2O3 that creates the oxygen vacancies [OV] in the lattice; and the third peak at ∼530.6–534.0 eV appeared to be due to the surface hydroxyl group.46Table 5 represents the relative OL, relative OV, and % OH values, estimated for the different solid solutions that confirms a relationship between the oxygen vacancies within the host lattice with the added proportion of carbon atoms. The concentration of Ce3+ and Ce4+ cations and the amount of oxygen vacancies are connected by the stoichiometric ratio x = [O]/[Ce] (Table S3†), which must have values of 1.5 for the Ce2O3 and 2 for the CeO2 samples. So the stoichiometric ratio of oxygen to Ce (Ce3+ and Ce4+) can be determined using the eqn (20):46 (20)where {Ce3+} and {Ce4+} represent the respective concentrations of both Ce cations that are calculated from the respective Ce 3d XPS spectra and EDX data. The calculated stoichiometric ratios and respective accounts of the oxygen valency of all samples are shown in Table S3.† The carbon-doped sample shows high oxygen vacancies in comparison to pure samples. The increase in carbon amount results in a decrease in the oxygen vacancies up to 6% C-doped CBO samples; then it starts increasing with further doping. A decrease in oxygen valencies was also found due to the incorporation of Bi3+ cations on the interstitial sites, or the grain boundaries. These oxygen vacancies are charge recombination centers on the catalytic surface. Therefore, minimum oxygen vacancies (in our case it is 6% C-doped CBO) tend to maximize the water splitting capacity of the sample.

The analysis of Ce 3d XPS core-level spectra also confirms the occurrence of oxygen vacancies in the host lattice. The oxygen vacancies in ceria can be determined by measuring Ce4+ and Ce3+ amounts, and an increased level of Ce3+ leads to enhanced visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity by narrowing the band gap of CeO2. The defects such as oxygen vacancies generated in ceria are governed by the ionic ratio of Ce4+ and Ce3+ species, which play a crucial role in its photocatalytic properties because these oxygen vacancies can be formed easily and removed rapidly.90,91
This proved that the introduction of oxygen vacancies in the host lattice takes place with the incorporation of carbon atoms. It might be possible that the carbon doping covered the sample with a thin layer of carbon and reduced the Ce ions (Ce4+ → Ce3+) and Bi ions (Bi3+ → Bi) by oxidizing the carbon into CO2 or CO.
Fig. S8† exhibits the XPS spectra of the C 1s of pure CBO and various C-doped CBO solid solutions. The XPS peak of C 1s can be deconvoluted into four components as Gaussian peaks, centered around the binding energy: 282.30, 284.60 285.61, and 289.28 eV, respectively, and their percentage components are exhibited in Table 6. The binding energy peak at 282.30 eV can ascribed to the formation of a Bi–C bond,92 indicating that the carbon substitutes for oxygen in the solid solution lattice. The peak located at 285 eV is usually assigned to elemental carbon. The peak located at 285.5 eV can be attributed to C–C bonds and identified as graphitic carbon.83 While the binding energy of 288.9 eV is associated with the carbonate/carboxyl C (O–CO) groups.93

Table 7 and Fig. 9a–g demonstrate the photoresponses (in terms of hydrogen generation) of 5% Pt-loaded pure CBO and Pt-loaded-carbon-doped CBO in 20% aqueous methanol (a hole scavenger, pH = 7) under 300 W Xe light exposure and in pure water under real sunlight irradiation, respectively. The methanol consumed the holes generated at the VB of the solid solution during illumination.94 Here, co-catalyst Pt was loaded onto the main photocatalyst (pure CBO or C-doped CBO) to enrich the active reduction sites on the catalytic surface by suppressing the recombination rate of the photo-carriers, i.e. photoelectrons and photo-holes. These photo-carriers are generated at the solid solution surface under exposure to Xe light/real sunlight, as generated electrons go to the electron-rich Pt site and holes move towards the bulk exposed surface of the pristine CBO/carbon-doped CBO solid solution.95 The H2/O2 generation capacity was estimated in an argon atmosphere via GC and is listed in Table 7. This exhibited a gradual increase in the water splitting capacity of the solid solution in terms of hydrogen generation with an increasing amount of carbon doping up to the 6% C-doped sample (5413.1 μmol H2 h−1 g−1) in 20% aqueous methanol. Afterwards the hydrogen generation capacity of the solid solutions starts to decrease. Moreover, we made a comparison of the hydrogen generation capacity (6315.0 μmol H2 h−1 g−1 with respect to the Xe light exposed un-doped sample with 3621.0 μmol H2 h−1 g−1 H2 generation) of the pure solid solution under real sunlight. An almost two-fold enhancement in hydrogen generation activity was observed on exposure to sunlight.

The 5% Pt-loaded C-doped CBO samples underwent overall water splitting of pure water under exposure to real sunlight (Table 7, Fig. 9a–f and S9a–f†) and generated H2 and O2 in lesser amounts in comparison to the Xe-light exposed samples in 20% aqueous methanol. Here, we also observed the same trend as under Xe light exposure for the C-doped CBO samples in favor of overall water splitting. A gradual increase in the amount of H2/O2 production was found with an increase in carbon doping up to the 6% C-doped CBO sample that showed maximum O2 (161.50 μmol O2 h−1 g−1) and H2 (323.00 μmol H2 h−1 g−1) production. Afterwards a decrease in water splitting products O2/H2 was observed for 8% C-doped and 10% C-doped CBO samples.
A few state-of-the-art porous systems used for hydrogen generation through water splitting under their experimental conditions are mentioned in Table S4.† This establishes the merit of our studied systems over other photocatalytic systems according to the criteria of their activity of H2/O2 production, cost, toxicity, and working conditions. Photocatalytic hydrogen is generated by the following proposed reaction (eqn (21)–(24)) path: Pt/C-doped CBO + hν → Pt/C-doped CBO (e− + h+)(21) (22) Pt/C-doped CBO (h+) +CH3OH + 6OH* → 5H2O + CO2(23) Pt/C-doped CBO (h+) + 4OH− → 2H2O + O2(24)
On comparing the results of the analyses with the hydrogen production rate of the pure and carbon-doped solid solutions, it is found that both results go hand in hand for good water splitting in the presence and absence of scavengers (methanol). The crystalline phase of the synthesized sample did not change with carbon doping. Furthermore, they acquired order in a lattice arrangement, which is at a maximum for the 6% C-doped sample with a minimum of lattice dislocation and high crystallinity (calculated by the XRD study). The porosity of the 6% C-doped CBO sample was found to be a maximum among all the studied samples, as confirmed by an increase in particle size on doping of the solid solution of CBO. Porosity leads to quantum confinement that leads to an increase in band gap and surface area. Surface morphology (sheet features, voids, and particles for the 6% C-doped sample) is a very decisive factor for controlling the hydrogen generation capacity through water splitting. A thread-shaped/layered morphology was found for the samples with 2% to 6% doping of carbon with voids and small particles. Small pits were found on the samples with carbon doping from 6% to 10%. Therefore, the surface of the 6% C-doped CBO possessed both layer-like and pit-like features with oxygen vacancies, which might catch the photo-holes for oxidation of water and work as a charge carrier recombination-suppressor. The as-produced competent interface enhanced the rate of water splitting. Furthermore, SEM supported EDX revealed the maximum composition (63.35%) of Ce in 6% C-doped solid solution with a maximum O/[Ce] ratio (Table S3†) and the maximum amount of Ce4+ (49.24% confirmed from XPS and EDX). That might support the charge transfer from O2− to Ce4+ (Ce4+ + e− → Ce3+) and O2− to Bi3+ (Bi3+ + 3e− → Bi), confirmed by UV-Vis, PL emission and FTIR studies that exhibited the dual oxidation states of Ce (Ce4+ and Ce3+) and Bi (Bi and Bi3+). The charge transfer bands being observed for the carbon-doped solid solutions not for the pure compound means carbon has an important role in the charge transfer process. It might be possible that the carbon provides the active sites (in the form of oxygen vacancies) for charge transfer. The percentage oxygen (decreases up to the 6% C-doped sample and afterward it increased for the 8% C-doped CBO and further decreased for 10% C-doped CBO) observed for the solid solutions are related to the oxygen vacancies and reciprocated the trend of hydrogen/oxygen generation properties of the samples. The minimum amount of oxygen (12.69%), which means a high number of oxygen vacancies (0.80) are present in the 6% C-doped CBO sample, led to the maximum hydrogen production. These oxygen vacancies offered the active sites for charge carriers (holes) to suppress the recombination. Therefore, lower oxygen vacancies in the solid solutions resulted in a higher hydrogen production rate. Furthermore, the recyclability of the studied samples was checked by using them twice more for water splitting (under exposure to real sunlight or Xe light) and their water splitting capacity was sustained without any major losses in activity (H2 production in Fig. 9a–g and O2 production in Fig. S9a–f).

Fig. 9h illustrates the mechanism of the electron transfer reaction for the photocatalytic water splitting process of pure and C-doped CBO solid solutions in a 20% methanol scavenger under 300 W Xe light source irradiation and pure water under exposure to real sunlight. When the sample was exposed to light, the electron jumped to the conduction band of C-doped CBO and travelled to the co-catalyst Pt site for generating hydrogen by reducing water and holes accumulated at the oxygen vacancy sites of the surface of the photocatalyst, which oxidized the water into oxygen or methanol into oxides of carbon/methane or formic acid/formaldehyde.

(g) Hourly monitored amount of hydrogen generation by pure CBO-and C-doped CBO solid solutions (300 mg) in 20% aqueous methanol, under exposure to a 300 W Xe light source for 3 h. (h) Schematic of the electron transfer mechanism for the photocatalytic water splitting process of pure and C-doped CBO solid solutions under Xe-light and real sunlight. 
Results obtained from the different analyses techniques are fully supported by the hydrogen production rates of the solid solutions. The effect of annealing duration and temperature, pH variation, light sources, surfactants, and change in dopant (non-metals: p-type boron and n-type phosphorus in place of carbon) are under observation.
Conclusion
In summary, we prepared a series of carbon-doped CBO solid solutions by firing the nitrates of cerium and bismuth with urea and glucose at a comparatively low temperature (300 °C) for 8 h. The gases evolved during the synthesis made the sample highly porous and added a quantum confinement character to solid solutions, resulting in an enhancement in band gap with an increase in doping percentage of carbon. In solid solutions, the ceria and bismuth present in dual oxidation states undergo charge transfer that leads to oxygen vacancies in solid solution. These oxygen vacancies provide the active states for holes and direct electrons to accumulate at the co-catalyst surface and suppress charge recombination, resulting in enhanced hydrogen and oxygen production. The photocatalytic activity was observed for the entire C-doped series in terms of H2 production using water splitting, and the maximum hydrogen production through water splitting was observed for a methanolic solution of co-catalyst Pt-loaded 6% C-doped solid solution: i.e. 5413.10 μmol H2 g−1 h−1 under Xe light irradiation. The co-catalyst Pt-loaded 6% C-doped solid solution exhibited the maximum O2 (161.50 μmol O2 h−1 g−1) and H2 (323.00 μmol H2 h−1 g−1) production from pure water under real sunlight. The 6% C-doped CBO exhibits the highest ability for hydrogen generation through water splitting.
