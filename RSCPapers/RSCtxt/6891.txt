    , Accepted 20th April 2022First published on 21st April 2022AbstractNear-infrared electron acceptors play an important role in organic solar cells (OSCs), in which they can usually be divided into fused and non-fused electron acceptors. In this work, we reported the first naphthobistriazole (NT) based non-fused electron acceptors for OSCs. The new acceptors contain NT unit as the central core, cyclopentadithiophene as π-bridge and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) as end groups. In addition, two or four fluorine (F) atoms were introduced into IC end groups to tune the physical and crystalline properties of the acceptors. The new acceptors were found to exhibit broad absorption spectra in the range of 300–900 nm and deep frontier energy levels when bearing F atoms. OSCs based on these acceptors provided PCEs of 6.19–10.79%, in which F based NT-acceptors showed higher PCEs due to the larger crystallite size, higher exciton dissociation efficiency, higher charge carrier mobilities and hence low charge recombination in solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) use bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layers based on physically mixed electron donor and acceptor to convert sunlight into electricity.1,2 With huge amount of organic semiconductors developed in recent years, in particular based on near-infared (NIR) electron acceptors with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) as the end group,3–10 OSCs have made rapid progress with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 19% in single-junction devices.11 Studies on the potential application of OSCs, such as those related to semitransparent OSCs,12,13 indoor photovoltaics,14–16 flexible devices17–21 and greenhouse effect,22 have also been reported. Therefore, OSCs have become promising tools in the fields of power generation and flexible electronic devices.
IC-based NIR acceptors usually have an “A–D–A” configuration, in which A represents IC and its derivatives, and D represents the aromatic core. In general, D cores can be divided into two categories: fused-ring cores, such as ITIC,3 Y6 and their derivatives,6,7,23 and non-fused cores.24 IC-acceptor based fused-ring cores represent the highest performance in OSCs due to the controlled microstructures via large conjugated backbones as well as large steric hindrance, but their high synthetic complexity enhances the cost toward manufacture. As an alternative, researchers have used non-fused cores as the D segment to construct electron acceptors, such as by using electron-rich phenyl,25–29 thienyl,30–33 benzodithiophene,34,35etc., and electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole,2,36–38 thienopyrroledione,39,40 benzotriazole,26 quinoxaline,41etc. In order to prevent strong aggregation, steric hindrance via branched side chains or large aromatic side units is usually introduced into the backbones. OSCs based on non-fused electron acceptors have provided PCEs over 15% with absorption extending to 900 nm and low voltage losses.32
It can be envisioned that, large π-conjugated backbones and steric hindrance are the two key factors to design fused and non-fused electron acceptors, since large π-conjugated backbones enable the acceptors to have NIR absorption and high electron mobilities, and steric hindrance is used to prevent strong aggregation. Based on these observations, herein, we introduced naphthobistriazole (NT) units into non-fused electron acceptors. The NT unit has been developed to design polymer donors, in which NT is a fused structure to enlarge conjugation and meanwhile two NH units at bistriazole can be attached with branched alkyl chains to prevent aggregation.42 In this work, three new non-fused electron acceptors were synthesized, based on NT as the core, cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as π-bridges and IC as end groups. In order to study the effect of fluorine (F) atoms on the microstructure and photovoltaic performance of OSCs, three IC derivatives without F atom, with a single F atom and with two F atoms were introduced into electron acceptors, yielding the acceptors NTCPD, NTCPD-2F and NTCPD-4F (Fig. 1). The results showed that NTCPD-4F as an electron acceptor had a large crystallite domain, red-shifted absorption and better phase separation in BHJ photoactive layers, resulting in the highest PCEs of 10.79% in solar cells.
2. Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization.
The synthetic routes of the NT-acceptors are shown in Scheme 1 and the detailed procedures are summarized in the ESI.† Starting from 1,2,5,6-tetrahydronaphthalene-1,2,5,6-tetraamine (M1), the NT-based compound M2 could be obtained via the NaNO2/CH3COOH agent, which was then used to perform alkylation and bromination to yield the compound M4. M4 was then reacted with the compound M543 with –CHO and –Sn(C4H9)3 functional groups to yield the key precursor M6via Stille cross-coupling reaction. NT-acceptors NTCPDT, NTCPDT-2F and NTCPDT-4F were then obtained via Knoevenagel condensation by using the compounds M6 and IC/F-IC/2F-IC. We introduced six 2-ethylhexyl side units into the acceptors, so that they exhibited excellent solubility in chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB). The chemical structures of NT-acceptors were confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy, as summarized in the ESI.† The thermal properties of the acceptors were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All three acceptors exhibit excellent thermal stability with the decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) above 370 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). No thermal transition was observed in the DSC curve (Fig. 2c), implying that the three acceptors have low crystalline tendency. Both the TGA and DSC results indicated that the number of fluorine atoms has a negligible influence on the thermal properties of these electron acceptors.

Optical absorption spectra of NT-acceptors in CF solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 2a and b. In CF solution, they exhibit absorption spectra in the range of 500–800 nm, while the thin films show red-shifted absorption with onset at ∼900 nm. This is a widely observed phenomenon in NIR electron acceptors, indicating their strong crystallization/aggregation in thin films. The maximum molar absorption coefficients are calculated to be 2.02 × 105 M−1 cm−1, 2.48 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 2.33 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for NTCPDT, NTCPDT-2F and NTCPDT-4F, respectively, indicating that the introduction of the F atom can slightly enhance the light absorption ability of these molecules. In thin films, two absorption peaks are observed, with 0–1 transition at ∼660 nm and 0–0 transition at ∼800 nm. With the increasing number of F atoms, NT-acceptors showed red-shifted absorption spectra, indicating the enhanced aggregation or better crystallinity in NTCPDT-2F and NTCPDT-4F.

(c) DSC heating and cooling traces (second cycle) at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 (exo. up). (d) Frontier energy levels determined by CV measurement. 
The frontier energy levels of NT-acceptors were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 2d, in which the energy levels of the donor polymer PBDB-T44 are also included. PBDB-T exhibited the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −5.24 eV and −3.44 eV, while the HOMO and LUMO levels of NTCPDT are −5.30 eV and −3.58 eV. The energy offset between PBDB-T and NTCPDT is 0.1–0.2 eV, ensuring enough driving force for exciton separation into free charges. When introducing F atoms into the acceptors, both HOMO and LUMO levels are down-shifted to −5.41 eV and −3.61 eV for NTCPDT-2F, and −5.58 eV and −3.65 eV for NTCPDT-4F. The optimized geometries of NTCPDT, NTCPDT-2F and NTCPDT-4F based on DFT (B3LYP/6-31G*) are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The dihedral angles in these molecules are small, indicating that all the three compounds have the planar conformation.
Organic solar cells
We then incorporated these NT-acceptors into OSCs by using the polymer PBDB-T as electron donor, in which the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:NT-acceptors/PFN-Br/Ag was used. The fabrication conditions for the photoactive layers, including solvent, additive, thermal annealing and thickness were carefully optimized, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1–S5 (ESI†). The optimized J–V curves and the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. In general, all the photoactive layers were fabricated from CF solution with 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) as the additive, and then were thermally annealed at 80 °C for 10 min before PFN-Br deposition.

As shown in Table 1, PBDB-T:NTCPDT based solar cells provided a PCE of 6.19% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.32 mA cm−2, a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.52. When introducing F-atoms into the acceptors, NTCPDT-2F based cells provided an enhanced PCE of 8.08% and NTCPDT-4F showed the best PCE of 10.79%, which is due to the enhanced Jsc and FF. Meanwhile, Vocs of F based NT-acceptors were decreased to 0.89 V and 0.86 V due to their down-shifted energy levels. Fig. 3b showed the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of solar cells. PBDB-T:NTCPDT-based device exhibited a broad photo response of 300–850 nm, while PBDB-T:NTCPDT-2F and PBDB-T:NTCPDT-4F-based devices showed the photo response of 300–880 nm with EQEs above 0.6. The higher EQEs indicated the efficient charge generation, corresponding to higher Jscs. The Jscs calculated form EQE spectrum agree well with the Jscs from J–V measurement with a mismatch within 5%.

Space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement was applied to study the hole and electron mobilities of the solar cells (Fig. 3c and d). The hole and electron mobilities of PBDB-T:NTCPDT based solar cells were 1.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. When introducing two F atoms into the terminal group, the hole and electron mobilities of PBDB-T:NTCPDT-2F blend were enhanced to 3.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Among three blends, the PBDB-T:NTCPDT-4F blend exhibited the highest hole and electron mobilities (5.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.70 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 1). Therefore, F atoms could enhance the charge carrier mobilities, which is responsible for the enhanced Jsc and FF in solar cells.
The photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) was measured to study the F atoms on charge generation and extraction properties (Fig. 4a). When Jph reached the saturated photocurrent it was denoted as Jsat. The exciton dissociation efficiency is determined to be P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat. As seen from Fig. 4a, under the conditions of short-circuit current, the three devices showed different trends of Jph–Veff curves. The Jph–Veff curve of PBDB-T:NTCPDT-based device did not reach the saturated photocurrent, indicating the bad exciton dissociation efficiency. The P(E,T) values of NTCPDT-2F and NTCPDT-4F-based devices were 90.3% and 95.6%, respectively. Therefore, F atoms can help the solar cells to improve the exciton dissociation efficiency.

Meanwhile, the dependence of the Voc and Jsc on the light intensity are measured to study the effect of fluorination on the charge recombination in OSCs (Fig. 4). Voc ∝ nkBT/q ln(Plight), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, and Plight is the incident light intensity. When the slope is close to 2kBT/q, monomolecular or trap assisted charge recombination is dominant. When the slope is close to kBT/q, the bimolecular charge recombination is dominant. The slopes of NTCPDT, NTCPDT-2F and NTCPDT-4F-based OSCs are 1.63 kBT/q, 1.59 kBT/q and 1.52 kBT/q, respectively. PBDB-T:NTCPDT-4F-based OSCs show the lowest slope, indicating the lowest monomolecular or trap assisted charge recombination under open-circuit conditions. The Jsc ∝ Pαlight (α ≤ 1), where α implies the extent of bimolecular charge recombination, was also studied (Fig. 4c). The α values of NTCPDT, NTCPDT-2F and NTCPDT-4F-based OSCs were 0.94, 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. The α value of PBDB-T:NTCPDT-4F-based OSCs was close to 1, indicating the effectively suppressed and negligible bimolecular charge recombination in the PBDB-T:NTCPDT-4F-based OSCs. The highest extraction probability would result in the highest Jsc and FF in NTCPDT-4F-based OSCs.
Studies of crystallinity and morphology
The morphology and crystalline properties of PBDB-T:NT-acceptor blends were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 5a–c) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement (Fig. 5d–g). The crystalline parameters are summarized in Table 2. AFM height images show that all the three blends exhibit a relatively uniform and smooth surface, in while the root mean square roughness (RMS) of NTCPDT, NTCPDT-2F and NTCPDT-4F-based blend films are 1.10 nm, 1.14 nm and 1.31 nm, respectively. In the AFM image of PBDB-T:NTCPDT-4F blends, small domains were observed, which may be due to the microphase separation between the donor and the acceptor.

From GIWAXS patterns in Fig. 5d–f, all three thin films exhibited the (100) and (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction, indicating the mixed orientation with both edge-on and face-on conjugated backbones. The coherence lengths (CLs) of the (100) and (010) peaks were then calculated, as shown in Table 2. PBDB-T:NTCPDT-4F blends provided enhanced CL values both for (100) and (010) peaks, corresponding to larger crystallite size. From the analysis above, we conclude that the NTCPDT-4F acceptor has longer CL and better charge transport in blends than the other acceptors, leading to improved charge dissociation, reduced charge recombination, and the best PCE in OSCs.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, three new NIR acceptors, NTCPDT, NTCPDT-2F and NTCPDT-4F based on the NT core with different amounts of fluorine atoms on the IC end groups, were successfully synthesized. The effect of fluorination on the morphology and photovoltaic performance was studied in detail. It was found that F atoms could provide red-shift absorption, deep energy levels, larger crystallite size and high hole mobilities. Therefore, NTCPDT-4F based solar cells provided the highest PCE of 10.79%, while NTCPDT based OSCs only showed a low PCE of 6.19%. These are the first NIR acceptors based on NT units, and will inspire more molecular design based on this building block.
