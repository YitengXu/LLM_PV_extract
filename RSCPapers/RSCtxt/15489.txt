The unique structure and properties of squaraine molecules has led to extensive research into their use as sensors. This feature article covers the most recent studies (2004–2009) in the development, characterization, and application of squaraine dye-based molecular sensors, self-assembly, and their use in polymeric materials and biological applications.Johnathan J.

Natural and synthetic dyes are commonly used to alter the color of a material, such as in the coloring of fabrics. The azo dyes, with their characteristic –NN– linkage, are a classic example of a functional moiety found in molecular dyes often used as coloring agents.One interesting group of organic molecules, which constitute a unique class of dyes, is the squaraine family of molecules. Squaraines have been used in applications such as optical recording,2,3 solar-energy conversion,4–7 electrophotography,8 nonlinear optics,9,10 photodynamic therapy,11,12 biochemical labeling,13 chromo/fluorogenic probes,14 pH responsive probes,15 cation,16,17 anion,18,19 and neutral molecule20 recognition, and self-assembled aggregates.21–23 Squaraine dyes were studied extensively by Law et al. in the 1980s and 90s. Law’s work covered numerous areas including synthesis, mechanisms, chemical, physical, and photophysical properties, electrochemistry, and supramolecular organization of both symmetrical and asymmetrical squaraine molecules.24,25 The squaraine dye backbone is a resonance stabilized, zwitterionic structure (1a–c, Scheme 1). Scheme 1  Resonance stabilized zwitterionic structure of the squaraine motif. Squaraine molecules are conjugated and can form a π-stacking interaction between an electron-rich region of one dye molecule and an electron-deficient region of a second dye molecule. The formation of supramolecular aggregates is a consequence of the π-stacking interactions that have been seen both in solution26 and in the solid state.17Strictly speaking, dyes are nonresponsive chemical species, their color is imparted as a consequence of the molecular properties. The systems that are described in this article should be truly classified as “indicators” since it is an environmental response that changes the optical properties of the molecular receptors. In accordance with earlier literature, these indicators will be referred to as squaraine dyes from here on.SynthesisThe properties of squaraine dyes have made them valuable as sensing motifs in supramolecular chemistry. Therefore, by modifying the structure of the molecule, it is possible to design a sensor that will function in specific media or exhibit enhanced selectivity and sensitivity for specific analytes. There are currently two broadly defined categories of structural variation in squaraine dyes; “symmetrical” dyes are formed when the substitutions are the same on either side of the cyclobutene ring and have C2v symmetry (compound 2, Scheme 2); and “asymmetric” dyes, which have different substitutions on either side of the 4-membered ring moiety (compound 3b, Scheme 3). Scheme 2  The backbone of a symmetrical squaraine dye by azeotropic distillation.  Scheme 3  One-pot synthesis of unsymmetrical squaraine dyes via the condensation reaction by azeotropic distillation. Symmetrical squaraine dyes are most commonly the products of the condensation reaction between 3,4-dihydroxycyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dione (squaric acid) and an aniline derivative (Scheme 2); however, benzothiazoles, phenols, pyrroles, and azulenes have also been used27 with yields up to 80%.The synthesis of the asymmetric squaraine dye is a little more challenging. The addition of two different aniline derivatives to squaric acid in a one-pot procedure, analogous to the synthesis of symmetrical squaraine molecules, often yields a mixture of three different compounds which are difficult to separate by column chromatography, for example, compounds 3a and 3c, Scheme 3. The asymmetric molecule 3b is formed in low yields (typically below 10%).The typical method for the synthesis of asymmetrical squaraine dyes requires the use of thionyl chloride to prepare 3,4-dichloro-cyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dione20,28,29 (4a), which is subsequently reacted with a single equivalent of an aniline derivative and immediately hydrolyzed to form the semisquaraine, for example, 4c (Scheme 4). Scheme 4  The current method for isolation of the semisquaraine. Compound 4a is reacted with N,N-dimethylaniline to yield compound 4b. An alternative procedure for the synthesis of 4a has been developed by Lunelli, allowing for the isolation of 3,4-dichloro-cyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dione through the reaction of squaric acid and oxalyl chloride in almost quantitative yields via the production and removal of HCl, CO, and CO2.30 The workup is easy since the byproducts are liberated as gases during the course of the reaction.Other synthetic approaches that have been utilized in the synthesis of squaraine molecules are the preparation and isolation of 3,4-dialkoxy-cyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dione precursors,31 allowing for seclusion of semisquaraine molecules.32 However, Jyothish et al. have shown that using less reactive donor functional groups, one can utilize the electronic effects of different groups in the synthesis of squaraine dyes. For example, Jyothish et al. showed that the use of electron-donating groups attached to the benzene moiety of a quinaldine salt yields only the semisquaraine (5a), while compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents, such as Br, I, CN and NO2, yield the symmetrical dyes, compound 5c, via the intermediate compound 5b (Scheme 5). Electron-donating groups reduce the acidity of the 2-methyl protons and hinder the formation of the enamine nucleophilic intermediate, which reduces the reactivity of the salt and does not allow the formation of the symmetrical squaraine dye. The opposite effect is observed when the substitution is an electron-withdrawing group; the acidity of the 2-methyl protons is increased, resulting in amplified reactivity of the intermediate and formation of the symmetrical dye. This elegant synthetic procedure provides valuable information on the type of moiety that can be incorporated into the squaraine molecule design.33 Scheme 5  The synthesis of semisquaraines and squaraine dyes through 3,4-dialkoxy-3cyclobutene-1,2-dione intermediates by a condensation reaction in benzene and n-butanol. Compound 5a: X = OH, OCH2CH3, Compound 5b: X′ = H, Br, I, NO2, CN. Optical propertiesThe physical properties of squaraine dye molecules have been extensively studied in the 1990s by Law et al.34–40 Typically, squaraine dyes exhibit a characteristically intense absorption band in the range of 640–850 nm41 and have molar extinction coefficients (ε) of ∼105 L mol−1 cm−1.42,43 The absorption peak occurs over a narrow to moderately wide (half-bandwidth) range of wavelengths. The combination of high molar extinction coefficients with narrow absorption bands gives the opportunity to apply squaraine dyes to very specific ranges of wavelength, while simultaneously using very low molar quantities, a desirable property especially when sensitivity is a focus in sensor design. Additionally, squaraine dyes are highly fluorescent, but they typically have small Stokes shifts, 20–30 nm (Fig. 1). Many of the squaraine dyes have moderate quantum yields, Φf = 0.30 in the 700–800 nm range.44–48 Fig. 1  Typical absorbance and fluorescence plot of squaraine dyes. CHCl3 2.5 × 10−7 mol dm−3, λEx = 635 nm (λEm = 645–800 nm). Recently Martínez-Máñez and Rurack et al. have carried out an extensive investigation on the photophysics, protonation and metal coordination behavior of seven squaraine dyes (6 to 12).49 In all cases it was shown that a colorimetric response was seen upon the addition of protons and metal ions (Ba2+, Hg2+, Fe2+, Pd2+, Cu2+), in which it was demonstrated that the nitrogen atoms in the aniline functionalities and the oxygen atoms in the C4O2 central ring bind Lewis acids. Upon the addition of one equivalent of H+ or metal ion, a blue shift in the absorbance spectra showed that binding had occurred at the aniline nitrogen. However, if coordination of the Lewis acid occurred at the C4O2 moiety, a red-shifted band was seen. With an excess of H+ or metal ions, coordination can occur through both nitrogen–oxygen atoms and/or both nitrogen–nitrogen coordinated complexes; this can be accounted for by the appearance of a broad band at 480 nm or bleaching, respectively.49 These observations lead Martínez-Máñez and Rurack et al. to rationalize exactly where the binding of the H+ or metal ions takes place in different squaraine molecules from spectral modulations by the appearance and/or disappearance of bands located at 640, 560, 670 and 480 nm, as well as bleaching in the visible region. Thus, the squaraine dyes act as colorimetric chemosensors. This has triggered an interest in the behavior of these molecules with intrinsic logic capability i.e., acting as molecular logic gates. A molecular squaraine with a particular characteristic property (input) can yield a colorimetric response (output), a system that has been studied by de Silva et al.50 Martínez-Máñez and Rurack et al. showed that squaraine dye 7 upon the addition of Hg2+ and H+ obeyed NOR, AND and XOR logic (Truth Table 1).

This is shown by Park et al., who demonstrated51,52 that by increasing the pH with the addition of NaOH a bathochromic shift (red shift) was observed. Depending if the chemical species existed as neutral (13a and b), monoanionic (13c), or dianionic (13d and e), the absorbance maxima progressively shifted to the red region as the pH increased (Fig. 2).51 Fig. 2  Absorbance of neutral and anionic forms of compounds 13a–e in DMF upon the addition of NaOH. The stilbenoid squaraines (14) are also pH responsive in that the addition of trifluoroacetic acid results in the complete disappearance of the infrared maximum (between 815 and 851 nm, depending on the solvent system) and the appearance of a new maximum at 670 nm. The addition of excess hydrogen ions results in the protonation of both the squaraine oxygen atom and the aminothiazoyl nitrogen atom, resulting in the complete disappearance of the NIR band and the appearance of a new absorbance maximum in the UV region.52  Structural modifications are also used to facilitate electronically induced absorbance shifts. The key is to significantly increase the overlap of the orbitals of the extended π-system through sterics, thereby facilitating the conjugation of the system.41 The increased overlap of the orbitals also allows the electrons on the nitrogen atoms and aryl substituents in the para position to delocalize across the system (15). This overlap and delocalization results in a shift of the absorbance maximum to longer wavelengths.41,42  Squaraine dyes are prone to form aggregates in a wide variety of solvents and media.23 This aggregation is dependent on solvent type, concentration, and pH.53 For example, the solvent polarity affects the zwitterionic structure, resulting in polarization of the squaraines, forming unusual aggregation structures. The dimer aggregates formed are classified as either J-type or H-type aggregates.54 This has been observed in both symmetric and asymmetric dyes.55 The two dimer structures form two different energy levels with J < H. The J-type dimer is a head-to-tail overlap stacked structure, while the H-type dimer is the result of parallel stacking. The formation of ‘H’ aggregates has been observed at low concentrations, and is frequently encountered in crystal structures.26,56 The crystal packing shows that each dye molecule is offset, such that the electron-deficient cyclobutane ring of one molecule is stacked between two electron-rich aniline derived rings at a distance of 3.67 Å (Fig. 3). Fig. 3  X-Ray crystal structure showing the crystal stacking (H aggregates) interactions between the electron-poor cyclobutadiene ring and the aromatic rings. π–π stacking = 3.67 Å. Host–guest recognitionIn a host–guest design strategy, the types of interactions are considered and then optimized to obtain a structure that will depend on all characteristics of both the host and guest. In its simplest form, host–guest recognition involves a binding or complexation event between two species, whereby the host structure itself is very stable, but complexation with a particular guest species enhances the stability of the system. In other situations, the host is unstable unless a guest is present. However, one must define which species is the host and which species is the guest. The host molecule is typically a large molecule or aggregate that has a sizeable cavity or can form a cavity upon a conformational change. The cavity must have suitable binding sites such as Lewis basic donor atoms or hydrogen bond donor atoms that will bind to the guest, which possesses a Lewis acidic metal cation or hydrogen bond acceptor. Guest species can range from small monoatomic cations or simple inorganic anions. However, this represents one end of the spectrum; at the other end, a host–guest system involves rather sophisticated molecular complexes, such as hormones, pheromones, or neurotransmitters, where difficulties arise in the distinction between the host and guest, and classifying such systems can be subjective. The following examples illustrate systems at the simpler end of the host–guest design spectrum. The squaraine dye acts as the host to detect Lewis acidic cations (the guest) forming a host–guest complex, but we also highlight some examples where the squaraine dye itself is also the guest.Metallic ion sensorsThe ability to detect metallic ions is important in biological, environmental, and industrial applications. Alkaline, alkaline earth, and transition metal ions are found in many areas of human physiology.57 In particular, Fe3+ has been shown to participate in the production of hydroxyl radicals in the body, which target G-DNA bases resulting in damage to the genetic code.Waste and pollution problems caused by heavy metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, silver, uranium/plutonium and zinc, are associated with all stages of materials processing, but the largest volumes of waste emissions are created by the beneficiation and smelting of ores and the combustion of coal.58 There are also significant quantities of transition metals released into the environment as a result of the processing of phosphate rock, the manufacture of cement, and the smelting of iron ore.58Ajayaghosh et al. reported the development of two sensors specific for Ca2+ and Mg2+. Depending on the structural composition of the sensor, signaling occurs through the formation of a 1 : 1 or 2 : 1 interaction of sensor to cation, by linking two squaraine units with different polyether linkages (for example, compound 16). In the presence of a metal ion, the two chromophores come into close proximity to induce a signal response by electronic transitions (exciton interaction) between the squaraine motifs. The two chromophores exhibit a 2 : 1 sandwich dimer binding Ca2+ (Fig. 4). However, the squaraine podand 16 is capable of wrapping around the smaller metal ions, such as Mg2+ (0.72 Å), to form a 1 : 1 folded dimer (confirmed by Job plot analysis). This is elegantly shown by the complexation of compound 16 with Mg2+ and Ca2+ forming a 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 host–guest complex, respectively (Fig. 4).59 Ajayaghosh et al. later extended the linker (polyether backbone) between two squaraine dyes that can wrap around a Ca2+ ion and the sensor was found to be reversible upon the addition of EDTA.60 Fig. 4  1 : 1 and 2 : 1 coordination of Mg2+ and Ca2+.

Metal ions also play a pivotal role in synthesis for drug development and are often used as catalysts.13,61–66 For example, palladium-containing salts represent some of the more useful facilitators of organic transformations and carry tight governmental restrictions on the levels of residual heavy metals in end products. The recommended dietary intake of palladium is approximately 0.02 ppm per day per person (assuming the average man is 87 kg and women is 75 kg) and the typical contamination level of palladium remaining in the organic phase after experimental workup ranges from 5 to 100 ppm.64 Therefore, there is an interest in the detection and removal of catalysts in chemical reactions. Anslyn et al. have developed a highly sensitive Pd2+ sensor (Scheme 6) based on the thiol-scavenging ability of the Pd2+ ion. The efficiency of this system rests on the nucleophilic nature of the conjugate base of ethane thiol in a basic solution. The EtS− ion executes a nucleophilic attack on the cyclobutene ring of the squaraine dye (17a) molecule resulting in a colorless compound (17b). Treatment of this compound with palladium salts causes a turn-on effect by the displacement of EtS−, resulting in the formation of Pd–SEt, allowing the return of color to the parent squaraine dye. This system gives visible detection, in organic media, of Pd2+ as low as 0.5 ppm and instrumental detection as low as 100 ppb, resulting in a highly desirable sensitivity for palladium.16 Scheme 6  Palladium sensor system for organic media. Detection limits of 0.5 ppm of Pd2+ were measured. The presence of Hg2+ in biological tissues is a significant threat to health. Studies have shown that mercury levels of 0.09 to 5 ppb can produce symptoms of mercury poisoning,67 and the FDA-recommended safe level of mercury in fish is 1 ppm.68 Ros-Lis et al.69 used the thiol-scavenging abilities of Hg2+ in aqueous media to develop a system that is sensitive to Hg2+ in concentrations as low as 2 ppb70 and selective for Hg2+, even in the presence of high concentrations (approaching 1 mM) of ions such as Pb2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+.69 This method also shows an applicable affinity for thiol-containing compounds in biological applications.19 Additionally, Martínez-Máñez and Rurack et al. have synthesized a Hg2+ sensor based on the dithia-dioxa-aza crown motif (18), Fig. 5. Fig. 5  Absorbance of compound (18) in 80 : 20 v/v H2O–acetonitrile in the presence of 5 equivalents of Hg2+ or Ag+. Reprinted “adapted” with permission from ref. 71. Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society. The use of this motif in conjunction with the squaraine scaffold allows for the detection of Hg2+, and also Ag+, in the presence of other thiophilic cations in aqueous applications at nanomolar concentrations71 through a colorimetric response. Avirah et al. developed a sensor (19) for Hg2+ based on the semisquaraine,72 which chelates the Hg2+ through the Lewis basic sites of the carbonyls. Upon chelation, the semisquaraine exhibits a fluorescent and colorimetric response (Fig. 6). The addition of Hg2+ resulted in the complete disappearance of the absorbance at 472 nm, leading to a visual color change from a deep yellow to a colorless solution. Similarly, the addition of 19.8 μM Hg2+ to compound 19 gave an eight-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity. This significant turn-“on” intensity led to the visual observation of the change in fluorescence (Fig. 6). Job plot and Benesi–Hildebrand analysis have shown 1 : 1 stoichiometry for the complex with a calculated association constant (Kass) of 4.0 × 104 M−1.72 Fig. 6  The relative fluorescence enhancement of compound 19 toward various metal ions (water–acetone 9 : 1 v/v). A fluorescence enhancement is seen with the addition of Hg2+ Reprinted “adapted” with permission from ref. 72. Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society. An asymmetric cationic squaraine dye, compound (20), developed by Basheer et al., exhibits binding of Hg2+ or Pb2+ in the presence of other metallic cations. While sensors do not typically function for multiple metals, the cationic sensor exhibits a different signaling peak for each ion, 549 nm for Pb2+ and 551 nm for Hg2+. In addition, the Job plot indicates a binding ratio other than 1 : 1 of sensor to cation. At micromolar concentrations, it is possible to visually detect the presence of Hg2+ with micromolar quantities of Cu2+ in solution. Higher quantities of Cu2+ (> 120 μM) resulted in a loss of color due to the oxidation of the dye (Fig. 7).73 Fig. 7  (a) The absorption change of compound 20 (12.9 × 10−6 M) upon the addition of Hg2+ (b) Job plot analysis of 20 and Hg2+ upon the addition of the cationic squaraine sensor. Ref. 73. Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society. Wallace et al. developed a squaraine-based sensor, compound (21), that exhibits an affinity for Fe3+ and Zn2+. The sensor shows a 2 : 1 Fe3+ to sensor chelation that occurs between the deprotonated hydroxyl group in the ortho position and the carbonyl of the cyclobutene ring (Fig. 8). The structure functions as an artificial siderophore (a pseudosiderand), or iron-chelating compound, modeled after the catechol motifs found in nature.74 By deprotonating the hydroxyl function, the planarity of the structure is broken, resulting in decreased overlap of the orbitals of the π system, causing the absorbance signal of the squaraine at 625 nm to be turned off. Upon binding Fe3+, the planarity is restored, and the signal at 625 nm is turned on. The sensor is highly specific for Fe3+ in the presence of other cations, because the ionic radius of the Fe3+ (0.65 Å) allows it to fit into the deprotonated pseudo-catechol structure. However, as the concentration increases, the sensor exhibits competing affinity for Fe3+ and Zn2+ (0.74 Å). The sensor retains an overall selectivity for Fe3+, but the competition becomes a factor to be considered.17 Fig. 8  Absorbance of compound (21) upon addition of various metal salts (1/2 equivalent) with selectivity noted for Fe3+. Competing affinity for Zn2+ becomes apparent. KBinding(1) (Fe3+) = 8.9 × 107 M−1, KBinding(2) (Fe3+) = 1.4 × 106 M−1, KBinding(1) (Zn2+) = 4.7 × 108 M−1, KBinding(2) (Zn2+) = 1.7 × 107 M−1.17 Reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry. Other examples of host–guest systems that utilize squaraine dyes are the squaraine-pseudorotaxane complexes75 in which the squaraine dye itself is the guest. A series of this type of host–guest complexes has been published by Smith et al., and they have been used as biochemical labels, for example, compound (22).76–79 Interestingly, Smith et al. showed that the macrocycle “protected” the electron-deficient four-membered cyclobutane ring from nucleophilic attack by the numerous nucleophilic species present in biological systems.  However, Martínez-Máñez et al. have taken advantage of the electron-deficient 4-membered ring in the development of chromogenic probes for the detection of anions, such as CN−, and biorelevant thiol-containing species.18,80 They further developed their system to take advantage of the reversible covalent bond to prepare an ‘off–on’ response, an approach extensively used by Mohr.81 As previously discussed above Anslyn et al. showed that nucleophilic attack of the anion towards the electron-deficient 4-membered ring turns off the color, which is regenerated with the addition of Pd2+ (Scheme 6).Chiu et al. have been interested in the differentiation between physiologically important K+ and Na+ ions, but distinguishing between the two ions can be very difficult due to chemical similarities. Chiu et al. synthesized a squaraine-pseudorotaxane (23), which showed a striking colorimetric response on the addition of Na+.22,82 The binding affinity for the Na+ complexed molecular cage (23) is reported to be 9600 M−1 in CDCl3–CD3CN (1 : 1 v/v), which is ten times greater than the anthraquinone structure (anthraquinone replaces the squaraine molecule in pseudorotaxane 23). A crystal structure elegantly shows that the squaraine unit has been encapsulated in the macrocycle, which is stabilized by the coordination of Na+, coordinated through the oxygen atoms on the C4O2 unit of the squaraine dye (Fig. 9).

Self-assemblySelf-assembly, in its most general sense, means the spontaneous association of two or more molecules or ions to create a larger, aggregate species through the formation of reversible (generally supramolecular) interactions. Relatively simple molecules with complementary functionalities may, under certain conditions, interact with one another to form significantly more complex supramolecular species, held together only by virtue of noncovalent interactions. The DNA double helix requires two complementary strands to become entwined via hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking in a self-assembly process. The strands ‘recognize’ each other and join together to form the most thermodynamically stable assembly product.Synthetic self-assembling systems rely upon the ability of the chemist to design molecules containing complementary functionalities, but who has no direct control over the assembly process. Ultimately the chemical system itself rearranges to the most thermodynamically stable product. Some of the most widely used interactions in synthetic self-assembly processes are hydrogen bonding, π-stacking interactions, metal–ligand coordination phenomena, as it has been shown that metals with well-defined coordination preferences may be coupled with rigid ligands to provide routes towards elaborate architectures.While self-assembled structures containing squaraine molecules are somewhat uncommon in the literature, there are a couple of noteworthy and elegant examples of squaraine dyes that have been developed by Ajayaghosh et al.21,83 One of the first systems examined involved the use of flexible squaraine dyes, whereby two squaraine units are linked together by flexible alkyl chains, and form preorganized supramolecular structures upon the complexation of Ca2+, forming a metallo supramolecular 1D array of H-aggregates (Fig. 10). This 1D array is supported by ESI-MS studies.84 Fig. 10  The proposed 1D structure of the H-aggregate supramolecular dimer with Ca2+. Reprinted with permission from reference 84. Copyright 2009 American Chemical Society. From this previous study, Ajayaghosh et al. recently reported the formation of hierarchical self-assembled structures under thermodynamic control from a 0D spherical structure to a 1D extended micellar structure.21 The formation of the structure was initially induced upon the binding of the Ca2+ ion, however incorporation of the catechol motif in the backbone of the molecular podand (compound 24) certainly aided the self-assembled helical fiber, as the 1D extended fiber failed to exist in the absence of the catechol group (compound 25). The dye molecules initially form the more kinetically favored spherical structure and slowly adopt the thermodynamically favored nonhelical fiber structures. The rearrangement of the structure is dependent on arene–arene interactions between the dye molecules. Without the aromatic components, the presence of the cations hinders the formation of the spherical and helical structures. The formation of these structures, which is accompanied by a hypsochromic effect (blue shift) on the absorbance, is sensitive to the structure of the dye molecule that composes the supramolecular structure (Fig. 11).21 Fig. 11  The formation of spherical and extended micellar structures upon the addition of Ca2+ that induces the self-assembly process.21 Reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry Polymeric squaraine materialsThe use of squaraine dyes in polymeric materials for electronic and photonic applications has recently been reviewed in by Ajayaghosh et al.42 Wu et al. reported the synthesis and characterization of poly(fluorene-alt-squaraine) via the condensation reaction of 9,9′-dioctylfluorene compounds and squaric acid. These polymers exhibit several novel features, including high yields (> 70%), high molecular weights (weight average 142700 and 254400 for 26a and 26b, respectively), polydispersities between 7.00 and 9.00, and the ability to be cast into a thin film. Compounds (26a) and (26b) have a broad, red-shifted absorption band between 500 and 1000 nm (Fig. 12).6 Fig. 12  The UV-vis-NIR of squaraine dyes 26a and 26b in toluene (A) and as a film and overlap with the solar spectrum (red line) (B). More common applications utilize the incorporation of a squaraine dye sensitizer into a commercial polymer matrix, such as in solar cells, which require the addition of a dye sensitizer to function; such sensitizers include polypyridyl complexes of ruthenium, which have been reported to have solar-energy-to-electricity conversions of up to 10.4%.85,86 A number of organic molecules, such as coumarin- and polyene-based dyes, have also been used but their solar-energy-to-electricity conversion has only been recorded as high as 7.7%.87–90 Therefore, the use of squaraine molecules as dye sensitizers is of interest. Squaraine dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have been shown to significantly enhance incident-photon-to-electron conversion (IPEC) and solar-to-electric power conversion, thus making them excellent candidates for dye sensitization applications.91 Alex et al. showed that asymmetric squaraine dyes exhibit significantly improved sensitization ability compared to the symmetric dyes. Symmetric dyes show a charge transfer towards the electron-deficient center of the molecule from the electron-rich oxygen atoms. The asymmetric squaraine dyes show a unidirectional charge transfer predicted by molecular orbital calculations.4 Li et al. improved the sensitization ability of the symmetric dyes by attaching carboxylic acid functional groups to the nitrogen atom of N,N-dialkylamino squaraine dyes, increasing the IPEC to >70%. The largest conversion comes from shorter carboxyl chains in combination with butyl substituents91 on the N,N-dialkylamino squaraine (27a–d) (Fig. 13).

A very recent example of a squaraine dye that has been used as the molecular panchromatic sensitizer in solar cells is compound 28, developed by Guldi, Pagani and Torres, who have prepared the first squaraine–phthalocyanine supramolecule.92 A single squaraine motif is bound between two Ru(II)phthalocyanine molecules. The optical absorption is shown to be the sum of the absorption of the individual components with large coverage in the visible region (550–850 nm). Even though both squaraines and phthalocyanines have been studied in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, this is the first example of a single squaraine–phthalocyanine that is being investigated in BHJ solar cells.  Biological applicationsSquaraine dyes have also been utilized as biological labels, thus squaraine dyes can act as a sensor motif for important biological and48 biomedical applications.28 Squaraine dyes have recently been shown to have applications as singlet oxygen generators for photodynamic therapy for oncological studies.65 Current research in squaraine dyes in biological systems has focused on the detection of albumins, which work well as protein models,93 and photodynamic therapy.11,94Protein labeling applications of squaraine dyes are typically modeled through studies in bovine serum albumin (BSA), human serum albumin (HSA), ovalbumin, and avidin (AVI).95 Suzuki and Yokoyama used compound (29) in studies with BSA and noted a color change from pink for the dye alone to a deep purple upon complexation with BSA (Fig. 14).93 Fig. 14  (a) The absorption spectra of 29 before and after the addition of BSA, increasing concentration from 0 to 500 μg mL−1 (b) visual color change. Reproduced with permission from reference 93. Copyright Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. The absorbance increases approximately 17 times after complexation. Optical responses, such as increased absorbance and fluorescence emission, are typical of squaraine dyes with BSA.93 In studies by Volkova et al. formation of the dye–BSA complex results in increased fluorescence emission by up to 190 times. The analogous dye–HSA and dye–ovalbumin complexes show similar, albeit reduced, increases of up to 24 times that of the dye alone. By making structural modifications, such as the addition of N-carboxyalkyl groups (30), the fluorescence emission of the dye–HSA and dye–ovalbumin complexes can be increased by up to 10 times and also result in a detectable response for dye–AVI complexes.95  Nakazumi et al. showed that the addition of a thiophene (31) or pyrene (32) spacer into a bis-squaraine dye, where n = 1, 2, or 3 (strictly speaking, compounds 31 and 32 are not squaraine dyes but squaraine derivatives), have also been shown to enhance the fluorescence emission upon binding to BSA and HSA.96  Three classes of squaraine dyes have been synthesized,11 compounds (33–35), that exhibit optical properties in the biologically active window of 700–900 nm.12 These dyes, particularly those heavily substituted with halogens,66,97 interact with molecular oxygen upon irradiation with light, 400–800 nm,65 and generate biologically active singlet oxygen species. The singlet oxygen species causes cytotoxic effects and DNA damage in cells. The benefit of using squaraine dyes for photodynamic therapeutic applications is that they only become active when exposed to light. Cytotoxicity stops when the source of light is removed.64 Cancerous cells show a high affinity for the dye molecules and are subsequently damaged by the singlet oxygen species generated upon irradiation,66,67 ultimately resulting in cellular death.63 Preliminary findings show reduction of tumor size by 80–90%.65  Conclusions and perspectivesAs described throughout this article, applications for squaraine dyes have ventured far beyond their use as a dye in material applications. These dyes exhibit great potential in the fields of host–guest recognition and self-assembled processes. Squaraine molecules show some very interesting properties as sensitizers, therapeutic agents, and in their use as sensors in both biological (aqueous phase) and other chemical applications (nonaqueous, materials chemistry).As reports of uses for squaraine molecules have become more prevalent in the literature, new applications and new questions about the properties of these molecules are arising that will provide future research opportunities. Squaraine indicators certainly have their limitations: low synthetic yields, limitations of synthetic products due to electronic factors, and insolubility in aqueous media, specifically if the squaraine molecule itself acts as the host. When the squaraine is the guest species, as in the examples of pseudorotaxanes, water solubility is significantly increased and this is particularly true for asymmetric dyes. Careful preparation of squaraine compounds is often required, as many squaraine receptors are susceptible to UV degradation and are often unstable over long periods of time. Nevertheless, the use of squaraine molecules over the last 30 years has drastically increased in particular their use in host–guest systems and self-assemble. This article has tried to highlight the most recent advances in the growing interest in squaraine chemistry.Note added in proofWhile the manuscript has been in press, Anslyn et al. have published a paper on pattern-based recognition using a single squaraine indicator.98 They have elegantly shown that five metals, Hg2+, Pd2+, Cu2+, Fe2+ and Ni2+, can be discriminated, when combining a squaraine derivative with five different thiols. The squaraine responses allowed for pattern-based discrimination of a diverse class of metal ions and thiols.
