First published on 28th July 2020AbstractHeterogeneous catalysis, a process in which the reaction of gaseous or liquid chemical reagents is facilitated at the surface of a solid material, is responsible for the majority of industrial-scale chemical and fuel production reactions. The energy required to drive these reactions has historically been derived from the combustion of non-renewable fossil fuels and carries an unavoidably large carbon footprint. More recently, the development of environmentally responsible and sustainable chemical industries is increasingly motivated by greenhouse gas-induced climate change, thus creating demand for eco-friendly heterogeneous catalytic processes. This includes innovative approaches enabled by renewable forms of energy, such as the electrification of chemical and petrochemical processes, utilization of CO2 as a feedstock and the incorporation of light into catalytic reactions. Herein we review the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy using CO2, and describe how the photophysical and photochemical properties of nanostructured metal oxide photocatalysts have been engineered to efficiently incorporate light into heterogeneous gas–solid CO2 hydrogenation reactions. Realizing high photonic and energy efficiencies in these systems has demanded innovation in not only photocatalyst engineering, but also photoreactor and process engineering. Rather than exclusively providing an in-depth discussion of the chemistry and science within each individual study, this Tutorial Review highlights the multidisciplinary character of photocatalysis studies by covering the four essential components of a typical research work in this field (materials engineering, theoretical modelling, reactor engineering and process development) via case studies of the archetypal indium oxide catalyst materials. Through advances in these four components, progress has been made towards the ultimate goal of industrializing the production of CO2-derived chemicals and fuels.

Introduction
The connection between CO2 and global warming via the greenhouse gas effect can be traced to the early works of Joseph Fourier (1827), John Tyndall (1859), and Svante Arrhenius (1896).1 The idea of using TiO2 semiconductor photocatalysts and photoelectrodes to imitate natural photosynthesis emerged as a mainstream topic of research well before climate scientists began to seriously discuss the growing concentration of anthropogenic CO2 in the troposphere and its deleterious effects on global climate.2 This work inspired the rapid growth of international research into water splitting and CO2 conversion via solar-powered thermochemical, electrochemical and biochemical means.3–5
Various reviews have been published regarding the applications and mechanisms of CO2 photocatalysis, especially in the aqueous phase.6,7 However, gas-phase heterogeneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction methods, with their potential for ready integration into existing thermocatalytic processes, have remained relatively less explored. By replacing combustion-driven heating with solar irradiation, gas-phase CO2 hydrogenation reactions such as reverse water gas shift, methane dry reforming, methanol synthesis, methanation, and hydrocarbon production could thus be driven under relatively mild conditions. Doing so would reduce the carbon footprint of future refineries while also offering a renewable source of chemicals and fuels from CO2. However, a significant challenge to the technological relevance and cost-effectiveness of photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation is the low efficiency or stability of existing photocatalysts, which necessitates both advancements in materials design and a comprehensive understanding of the photocatalytic process.
Metal oxides are omnipresent in the field of gas-phase heterogeneous CO2 catalysis, due largely to their stability relative to other chemical compositions. Among these oxides, wide-bandgap (UV-absorbing) insulators notably absorb only a small fraction of incident solar radiation, which has a marked impact on their photochemistry.8 As recommended by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the AM1.5 spectrum is commonly used to represent the solar spectrum at sea level on Earth, as it also takes into consideration the variable angle of the sun due to Earth's rotation. The distribution of wavelengths present in solar radiation resembles that arising from a black body and is further modified by absorption as they pass through the Sun's corona and the Earth's atmosphere. As such, emission intensity is highest at wavelengths just below 500 nm, drops rapidly in the UV as it approaches 140 nm and more gradually diminishes into the infrared toward 4000 nm. In the case of archetypal TiO2, for instance, its large bandgap (3.2 eV) means that barely 5% of the incident solar energy can be utilized to create electron–hole pairs. Moreover, once electron–hole pairs are generated, the energetics and dynamics of these charge carriers determine their ultimate fate, be it relaxation via physical processes to generate heat/light or transfer to adsorbed reactants to enable chemistry.9 Therefore, in order to fully utilize solar energy and achieve high catalytic activity, an effective CO2 photocatalyst should be able to: (1) generate excited charge carriers capable of surviving long enough to perform catalytic reactions (i.e., microseconds to seconds), and (2) provide active sites for the adsorption and transformation of CO2 and other reactant molecules.
To this end, extending photocatalyst's light absorption to the visible range, suppressing the recombination of charge carriers and optimizing surface active sites are important objectives in gas-phase photocatalysis studies. However, merely controlling the structure, composition, size, and shape of nanostructured metal oxides is insufficient; it is also necessary to tailor surface defects such as coordinately unsaturated metal and oxygen sites, and hydroxide groups. Those defects which act as active sites create mid-bandgap states that broaden the optical absorption range and extend the lifetimes of photogenerated charge-carriers, thereby encouraging photochemical reactions rather than non-productive, photophysical recombination processes.10,11 Beyond utilizing solar light to produce photoexcited electron–hole pairs for surface reactions (photochemical processes), photocatalysts can convert light energy to heat through localized surface plasmon or carrier relaxation (thermochemical processes), which can improve the overall energy efficiency of the catalytic process by mitigating the need for external heating.53 Photothermal catalysis, combining both thermochemical and photochemical catalysis within a single system, thus offers the opportunity to further boost photocatalysis efficiency.10
One major goal of this Tutorial Review is comparing a library of photocatalytic nanomaterials for heterogeneous CO2 hydrogenation and providing an overview on their synthesis–structure–property relationships. Understanding the photo-chemistry and photophysics underpinning their excited-state surface reactivity with gaseous H2 and CO2 under light irradiation was also a priority, necessitating the study of catalytic activity, selectivity, reaction kinetics, stability trends, percent conversion, and photonic and energy efficiencies in order to provide parallel comparisons. While many excellent reviews of different classes of materials and materials engineering methods for heterogeneous CO2 photocatalysis have been written in the past few years, the literature generally lacks a coherent and uniform comparison of catalytic performances due to differences between testing systems and rate calculation methods.12 Herein we choose indium oxide as an exemplary photocatalyst for illustrating the concepts and principles pertinent to designing a high-performance heterogeneous CO2 photocatalyst, and investigate the effectiveness of each materials engineering method. Considering the interdisciplinary nature of photocatalytic studies, which involve chemists, physicists and engineers with different educational backgrounds in materials design, computational modelling and reactor engineering, principles underlying theoretical studies and new reactor engineering strategies are also introduced to provide a comprehensive picture and valuable tutorial experience.
Engineering of metal oxide materials
Distinct forms of a metal oxide material can be obtained by tailoring its defects (e.g., stoichiometric MxOyversus non-stoichiometric MxOy−n), polytype (e.g., rutile, anatase, or brookite TiO2), superstructure (e.g., assembled-nanocrystal nanorods), isomorphic substitution (e.g., M*zMx−zOy), and/or heterostructure formation (e.g., MxOy/M* or MxOy/M*Oy). Various microscopic, diffractive, and spectroscopic analytical techniques, including time-resolved and in situ measurements, have been applied to elucidate the physical and chemical dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers and compare the effect of materials engineering. These analyses enable the formulation of a Jablonski scheme depicting photophysical and photochemical processes deemed to follow the absorption of bandgap and sub-bandgap solar irradiation, as shown in Fig. 1.10,13 Here, the progenitor metal oxide photocatalyst can be engineered to contain mid-gap electron-acceptor defect states below the conduction band edge (i.e., oxygen vacancies, [O]v; coordinately unsaturated metal, M′; and isomorphic substituted metals, M*′) as well as mid-gap hole-acceptor defect states above the valence band (e.g., hydroxyl, OH, and coordinately unsaturated oxygen, O).

As shown in the aforementioned Jablonski scheme, photo-generated electrons and holes can follow both fast (bandgap) and slow (sub-bandgap) decay pathways. The latter processes involve carriers trapped in defect states with lifetimes sufficiently long for them to participate in chemical reactions catalysed by active sites such as surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs); in the case of defect-laden indium oxide In2O3−x(OH)y, SFLPs are composed of proximal Lewis-basic In–OH sites and Lewis-acidic In′/M′ sites.14 The photocatalytic activity of In2O3−x(OH)y can then be modified by various materials engineering methods, including altering the Lewis acidity/basicity of the SFLP components and the distance between them as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1.15

Nanocrystals and superstructures
Like many metal oxide semiconductors, the optoelectronic structure of In2O3 can be hugely impacted by its crystal phase, size, morphology, doping elements, and defect concentrations, which makes it an incredibly versatile material. Generally, In2O3 is an n-type semiconductor with direct and indirect band gaps of 3.7 and 2.6 eV, respectively. The n-type conductivity is attributed to its oxygen vacancy ([O]v) defects, which increase electron density at In sites.16
Nanostructures tend to favour the formation of defects due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, and studies have shown that the energy required for [O]v formation is lower at surfaces than in bulk.17 Thus, many studies aimed at tuning the electronic properties of metal oxide photocatalysts have focused on synthesizing nanoscale materials with different sizes and morphologies. For instance, highly crystalline spherical In2O3 nanocrystals were prepared by thermal decomposition of In(acac)3/oleylamine mixture in an argon atmosphere. In2O3 particles of 4, 6 and 8 nm in diameter were obtained by tuning the ratio of In(acac)3 to oleylamine, with size-dependent photoluminescence being exhibited due to quantum confinement effects.18 In2O3 nanocrystal nanorods with different lengths (from 800 nm to 1830 nm) have also been synthesized via slow hydrolysis of InCl3 in urea solution, with their photocatalytic properties being compared through CO2 hydrogenation. The longest nanorods performed best due to longer charge carrier lifetimes (4.81 μs for 1830 nm rods versus 1.78 μs for 800 nm rods) induced by the nanocrystal nanorod superstructure, which allowed electrons to migrate between nanocrystals and avoiding recombination with holes.19
The interaction between reactant molecules and defects on the metal oxide surface also hugely impacts catalytic activity. Defect-laden indium oxide (In2O3−x(OH)y) nanocrystals bearing both [O]v and OH defects were prepared via thermal dehydroxylation of indium hydroxide in air, and showed impressive photocatalytic activity toward CO2 hydrogenation.20 This synthesis approach of converting hydroxide to oxide-hydroxide allowed the proportions of hydroxides and oxygen vacancies to be carefully tuned, via the temperature and duration of the heat treatment, to achieve the best photocatalytic activity.21
In sites adjacent to [O]v acted as the Lewis acid and the proximal OH defect acted as Lewis base, together forming an SFLP active site able to heterolytically dissociate H2, generating a protonated hydroxide and indium hydride that subsequently reacted with CO2 to form CO.14 These protonic and hydridic hydrogen species formed from hydrogen cleavage can be detected through 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements.22
Isomorphic substitution
Tuning the chemical nature, concentration, and position of dopants in the metal oxide lattice is another effective method of modifying the optoelectronic properties of metal oxide. The bixbyite type structure of cubic In2O3 (Ia) can be viewed as defected fluorite with one-quarter of the oxygen sites being vacant. These vacant sites provide space for extrinsically doped atoms. For instance, tin-doped In2O3 (Sn–In2O3, ITO) is a transparent conductor widely used in electronic devices. Due to the 4+ valence of Sn4+, each Sn4+ replacing In3+ in the lattice contributes one free electron to the conduction band. Meanwhile, the charge imbalance between Sn4+ and In3+ needs to be compensated by the incorporation of oxygen anions into some of the structural anion vacancy sites of In2O3.23 Additionally, the two distinct indium positions in cubic In2O3 (24d and 8b) differ in their bonding with neighbouring oxygen atoms, thus providing further opportunity for site-selective substitution.
Given that reaction rate and selectivity of In2O3−x(OH)y are both apparently dictated by the SFLP, these properties could be advantageously tailored through chemical means by adjusting the SFLP geometry, as well as the Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity of its In and In–OH sites, respectively, via isomorphic substitution.15 One study of Bi3+-substituted In2O3−x(OH)y nanocrystals, for instance, indicated that differences in atomic size, electronegativity and degree of Bi3+ substitution provided a quantitative means of tuning both the distance between Lewis acid and base sites, as well as the Lewis acidity/basicity of the SFLP.24 Elemental substitution also creates new mid-gap states within the electronic bandgap, which generates visible-wavelength photon absorption. According to external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, shallow to deep trap states around 550 nm were present in Bi3+-substituted In2O3−x(OH)y samples. With increasing Bi3+ substitution levels, the main photocurrent absorption edge was red-shifted from 430 nm to 470 nm, indicating that enhanced light absorption was induced by Bi3+ substitution. Thus, tailoring the chemical, electronic and optical properties of metal oxides via isomorphic substitution provides a rational and systematic approach toward optimizing their photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation.
Polymorph selection
Another strategy that can enable optimization of gas-phase heterogeneous CO2 photocatalyst performance is materials engineering of polymorphism. The polymorphs of TiO2 have been heavily studied and compared regarding their photocatalytic properties, as has been summarized in many reviews.25 In2O3, the new rising star in photocatalysis, has two primary crystal phases defined by space group symmetries Ia, (cubic) and R (rhombohedral), with the former being widely studied both experimentally and theoretically.26 Cubic In2O3, the most stable form of In2O3, is a bixbyite-type structure with two distinct In sites and one O site atom occupying 8b, 24d, and 48e Wyckoff positions, respectively. It can be obtained by various synthetic methods such as direct oxidation of indium metal, or calcination of indium hydroxide and indium salts. Rhombohedral In2O3 is a corundum-type structure with one In site and one O site at the 12c and 18e Wyckoff positions, respectively. It has been rarely studied, as it was thought to be a metastable phase at ambient temperature and pressure, and was typically prepared by treating cubic In2O3 at high temperatures and pressures. Recently however, nanoscale rhombohedral indium oxide (rh-In2O3−x(OH)y) with [O]v and OH defects has been prepared through the calcination of InOOH, which exhibits significantly higher activity and superior stability while also favouring the production of CH3OH over CO. Though the band gap of rh-In2O3−x(OH)y is slightly larger than that of c-In2O3−x(OH)y (3.01 eV versus 2.89 eV, respectively), detailed studies have observed gains in catalytic performance relative to cubic bixbyite In2O3−x(OH)y. Here, the increased distance between the acidic and basic components of SFLP sites was observed on switching from the cubic to rhombohedral polymorph, thereby resulting in enhanced reactivity.27
Non-stoichiometry
Photocatalyst performance can also be tuned by introducing additional defects to enhance light utilization and reactant activation. Hydrogenated black TiO2−x exhibited a substantially narrowed bandgap compared with stoichiometric TiO2 due to intra-band transitions;28 likewise, In2O3 was hydrogenated to create non-stoichiometric, ultra-black c-In2O3−x, in which oxygen vacancies gave rise to mid-gap states that could accommodate charge-balancing electrons.29,52 As the non-stoichiometry (x) increased, the pale-yellow colour gradually became dark grey, eventually turning black, with the band gap narrowing from 2.66 eV to 2.36 eV.29 According to UV-vis-NIR reflectance measurements, this modification to In2O3 could enhance its absorption of the solar spectrum and even achieve intense and uniform light absorption of ∼90% between 250 and 2500 nm. Compared with pristine In2O3, photoconductivity measurements showed that ultra-black c-In2O3−x also exhibited faster photo-saturation upon light irradiation and slower photocurrent decay, which is attributed to increasing optical absorption of visible and near infrared light by an increasing number of mid-gap and conduction electronic states.
In a batch reactor with a light intensity of approximately 20 suns, black c-In2O3−x exhibited a CO production rate more than 2400 times that of (pale-yellow) In2O3. The superior catalytic activity of black c-In2O3−x arises from its surface oxygen vacancies, which abstract O from CO2 to form CO and are subsequently regenerated by reaction with H2 to form H2O, thereby completing the catalytic cycle. This photochemistry is also enhanced by the photothermal and plasmonic effects associated with the aforementioned mid-gap and conduction electron states, respectively.
Hybrids
The catalysts discussed thus far are single-component materials. They still face some challenges regarding industrial applications, particularly in terms of material cost and stability on larger scales, where coke and water vapor formation can cause deactivation. Thus, it is necessary to introduce greater photothermal and plasmonic effects into the system to further improve the performance of metal oxide photocatalysts while maintaining their active sites. These needs can be met by incorporating metal oxide photocatalysts into binary architectures. In such catalysts, photo-chemical, photothermal, and plasmonic components are integrated synergistically to enhance the overall efficiency of solar energy conversion.
Binary heterostructures of In2O3−x(OH)y that incorporate broadband light-absorbing materials can photothermally or photochemically accelerate the rates of catalysed reactions. Examples include using black Si nanowire arrays to form In2O3−x(OH)y/SiNW and niobium pentoxide nanorods to form In2O3−x(OH)y/Nb2O5. These Si nanowire supports, with a band gap of 1.1 eV, provided a photothermal activity enhancement to the photocatalytic In2O3−x(OH)y nanocrystals whose band gap is 2.9 eV. More specifically, the vertical configuration of the black Si nanowires, as shown in Fig. 3a–c, enabled efficient broadband light harvesting across the near-infrared, visible and ultraviolet wavelength ranges, absorbing over 85% of incident solar intensity by minimizing reflective losses.30 As a result of this enhancement, the hybrid photocatalyst was able to reduce CO2 to CO at a rate of 22.0 μmol g cat−1 h−1, a 6-fold rate increase over that of an identical In2O3−x(OH)y catalyst on a roughened glass substrate.31

Owing to the traditional application of indium oxide catalysts under predominately thermal conditions, many oxide supports that have been studied in the field of CO2 heterogeneous thermocatalysis can also provide valuable lessons for designing better photocatalysts. For instance, supporting In2O3 on ZrO2 has been shown to prevent catalyst deactivation by CO.32 Unlike the copper/zinc-oxide/alumina (CZA) system in which CO addition enhances performance via the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, up to 80% of the CO2 feedstock could be substituted with CO to promote the generation of vacancies in In2O3/ZrO2. Thus, the catalyst remained stable for 1000 h under thermocatalytic conditions, avoiding the otherwise rapid deactivation than would typically occur within 1 h.3,32,33 The electronic effect of ZrO2 not only provided sintering resistance, but was also believed to generate a new type of vacancy and a different reaction pathway by abstracting oxygen from the active indium phase. Similarly, Nb2O5 nanorod supports in Fig. 3d served to increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies relative to pristine In2O3−x(OH)y, thereby prolonging charge-carrier lifetimes by around 30%, according to time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy measurements, and enhancing their chemical reactivity.34
Computational modelling
Throughout the development of metal oxide-based catalysts, computational modelling has played a key role in improving our understanding of a material's surface defects and its interaction with reactant molecules, which guides further materials engineering and unveils catalytic pathways. Point defects (such as oxygen vacancies, hydroxide groups, etc.) in metal oxides can change the potential energy and configuration of the lattice. Knowledge of the distortion created by these defects can, therefore, play a crucial part in optimizing the material's properties and catalytic reactivity. One of the most relevant and extensible approaches to modelling point defects in metal oxides is density functional theory (DFT). This quantum mechanical approach allows the description of a many-body electronic ground state in terms of single-particle equations, providing accurate information about defect formation energies and electrochemical properties, and yielding valuable insights into the crucial ground state mechanisms of chemical reactions.14
Experimental studies on defect-laden In2O3−x(OH)y nanoparticles demonstrated photocatalytic CO2 reduction by H2 at temperatures as low as 150 °C using both ultraviolet and visible light.20 The exact role of [O]v and OH defects, and the mechanism responsible for gas phase CO2 reduction in the presence of light and temperature, can be unveiled using proper computational modelling designs. Periodic slab models of In2O3 with no defects, In2O3−x with only [O]v defects, In2O3−x(OH)y with only OH defects and In2O3−x(OH)y with both defect types were used to represent the pristine and defected indium oxide surfaces. An exhaustive set of DFT simulations then analysed the interactions of each surface with CO2 and H2 molecules, resulting in the identification of a catalytically active SFLP site formed by proximal In (Lewis-acidic) and In–OH (Lewis-basic) moieties on the metal oxide surface, Fig. 4a and b.

To clarify the behaviour of these active sites in the presence of light and heat, thus mimicking the real photocatalytic condition, sophisticated linear response time-dependent DFT (LR-TDDFT) and meta-dynamics calculations can be used respectively.35,36 Unlike standard DFT, the TDDFT approach is currently incapable of dealing with large numbers (i.e., hundreds) of atoms. Cluster models were thus used as an alternative to the computationally expensive periodic slab calculations typically used to study surfaces and processes mentioned earlier. Cluster models are based on the high degree of localization of the perturbation caused by the existing point defects in the lattice. A representative defect and its close surrounding were selected to create the cluster model. Further, a sufficiently large size of the vacuum layer in the cell was implemented to avoid the cluster–cluster interaction that causes artefacts via the interactions of overlapping wave functions. To represent the surfaces, “saturators” should be used in order to deal with the dangling bonds of the surface atoms, which have a negative effect on the entire model. Hydrogens are commonly used as saturators, as they act as both an electron supplier and logical terminator capable of reducing such adverse effects.
For instance, cluster models representing pristine and defected In2O3 surfaces were thoroughly tested by probing the convergence of their optical properties with those calculated from standard periodic models and experiments. These cluster models were then utilized to identify the detailed excited-state properties of pristine and defected In2O3 surfaces, which extended understanding of the enhanced CO2 reduction rate for defected In2O3−x(OH)y in the light relative to the dark. In particular, it was found that the SFLP in In2O3−x(OH)y tends to trap photoexcited electrons and holes at its Lewis-acidic In and Lewis-basic OH sites, thereby enhancing the respective hydridic and protonic character of these excited SFLP moieties and their reactivity towards CO2, relative to the ground state, Fig. 4d.35
To elucidate the role of elevated temperatures (e.g., 180 °C) in photocatalyst's activity, an in-depth temperature-dependent (20 °C versus 180 °C) computational study was conducted on the defected In2O3−x(OH)y system via well-tempered meta-dynamics-biased AIMD simulations.36 First, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) was performed on the Born–Oppenheimer surface and then implemented a meta-dynamics approach that applied a periodic bias to the system to encourage efficient, self-avoiding exploration of the free-energy landscape. This work suggested that the SFLP site was structurally altered under high-temperature conditions, providing the means to break the CO2 reduction reaction into two less-energetic steps with slightly reduced reaction barriers.
Overall, the detailed electronic level information obtained at ground state, excited state and at various temperatures can provide much-needed guidance in the selection of elemental composition, materials design and surface structural engineering, thereby enabling the discovery of next-generation gas-phase CO2-reduction photocatalysts. These computational modelling results, together with validation from experimental studies, can lead to valuable insights to further enhance the activity of the metal oxide photocatalyst via different material engineering methods mentioned in the previous section.
Photoreactor design, modelling, and photocatalyst testing
Photoreactor design plays an important role in all stages of photocatalysis studies, from photocatalyst screening and kinetic studies to high-performance demonstrators for industrial scale-up. Thus, achieving high photonic and energy efficiencies in catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is not only a formidable materials science challenge, but also a demanding engineering task that requires a detailed understanding of the relevant transport processes.37
The CO2-reduction activity of promising new photocatalysts is usually screened in simple reactor geometries under batch or flow conditions, with the aim of limiting light and thermal gradients to allow comparisons of different catalysts under variable wavelength, illumination intensity, temperature, pressure, and/or gas flow rates. Commonly used illumination sources include solar simulators, Xe lamps with filters, LED light sources, and lasers. Batch reactions are typically performed in a pressurized reactor vessel with an optically transparent window and externally heat controller to control sample temperature. Samples are dispersed as a thin powder layer onto a flat substrate, such as quartz filter paper, and then placed into the reactor. In contrast, flow reactor testing is commonly performed using a packed bed/pellet of the catalyst powder in tubular quartz capillaries, followed later by testing in reactors with more well-defined conditions for catalyst characterization, such as a thin-slit reactor or a Harrick cell.
While working with a well-defined reactor system is an important starting point, comparing production rates on different photocatalysts studied in different reactors and by different research groups remains a challenge due to the lack of widely-adopted standardized reactor operating conditions (e.g., illumination intensity and spectral distribution of light source), incomplete reporting of reactor operating conditions, different conventions used in normalizing production rates, and a lack of reference calibrations.38
At a minimum, best practices in conducting photocatalyst testing and reporting rates should be adopted. These include: (1) validation of new photoreactors with a known reference catalyst; (2) pre-reaction cleaning of the catalyst to minimize surface adsorbed organic contamination, coupled with 13C-labelled CO2 reaction testing to verify the origins of the product carbon species; (3) estimation of the photon penetration depth for the catalyst sample and measuring potential temperature gradient across the sample by making reactor modifications to accommodate multiple temperature measurements, so that photochemical and photothermal rate contributions may be decoupled; and (4) normalization of reported rates over the illuminated specific surface area, and reporting a photochemical and photothermal turnover frequency where appropriate, in preference to mass normalized rate.
Simulation studies on the transport processes of heat, mass, momentum, and radiation within photoreactors at length scales from nanometres (catalyst particles) to meters (the reactor) can help guide optimization of photoreactor performance. One approach is to use simple continuum Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) methods coupled with finite element methods (FEMs).39,40 Effects of continuum substructures (catalyst structure) are also considered in such continuum models using appropriately chosen physical parameters (scattering and absorption coefficients, etc.).
According to 2D MCRT/FEM simulation results on three typical reactor designs in Fig. 5, fixed-bed capillary reactors irradiated from one side showed large gradients in their absorption intensity fields, Fig. 5a and b. However, significant improvement could be achieved using thin-slit reactors, as evidenced by their highly uniform optical absorption intensity fields, Fig. 5c. Likewise, better insulation and improved thermal contact of the catalyst with the heating block effectively homogenized the temperature field. Nevertheless, all reactors exhibited reduced optical absorption due to reflective losses at phase boundaries, absorption by reactor components, and light scattering from the catalyst. Thus, mitigating these losses would require minimizing phase boundaries and using reflective reactor components to redirect light toward the catalyst, thereby emphasizing the importance of the reactor/catalyst geometry and alignment. One strategy to meet this demand is through integration of proper noncatalytic photocatalyst supports into the system.
 Fig. 5  Cross-sections showing simulated optical absorption and temperature fields for two tubular designs similar to those used for catalyst testing of In2O3−x(OH)y systems (a and b) and one thin slit design for catalyst testing under well-defined conditions currently under development (c). Reactor designs include transparent “windows” (light blue), metallic bodies (light grey), photocatalysts (yellow), external heating element (dark grey). 
Photoreactor and support archetypes
Within a photoreactor, photocatalysts can be immobilized onto non-catalytic supports whose individual geometry and material properties can be controlled to affect photon absorption, thermal conductivity, surface adsorption, charge transfer, and other catalyst properties that affect production rate and selectivity. For example, thermally conductive materials such as Al have been chosen for efficient heat transfer where additional thermal energy is supplied to the reaction.41 Also, as a reflective support, Al can increase the absorption of photons in the photocatalyst layer.
When considering reactor scale-up, optimizing the light distribution and gas-catalyst contact while keeping the reactor footprint low requires photocatalyst immobilization onto macroscopic supports that offer a high surface area to reactor volume ratio. Packing structures of a regular geometry (monoliths) and random geometry (reticulated foams) have been shown to improve mass transfer and process energy efficiencies by up to an order of magnitude in conventional thermochemical processes.42 Planar photoreactors may themselves be miniaturized and micro-structured (“microreactors”) to reduce the length scale for heat transfer and light transport to (and from) the catalytically active sites. Beyond the improvements in external heat and mass transfer efficiencies over randomly packed beds (Fig. 6), such structures allow improved light penetration, and can also be coupled with optical fibres, which overcome efficiency losses usually associated with under-absorption of the catalyst sub-surface layer.43
 Fig. 6  Continuum of macro porous catalyst supports for effective mass and light transport from regular to random geometry. (a) Channels of square geometry for a monolith structure, with catalyst powder deposited in channels or coated on channel walls, with scattering waveguide illuminating surface. Alternately, film coated directly onto a waveguide and placed in channels, (b) interconnected random network of pores (reticulated) coated with film of catalyst, illuminated either centrally or externally through a solar concentrator. 
For instance, quartz waveguide rod supports were used to maximize optical absorption by In2O3−x(OH)yvia internal reflection, with red (732 nm) to green (535 nm) lasers being readily propagated, Fig. 7a–c.44 Diffuse transmittance measurements, Fig. 7e, revealed that the catalyst coating increased visible light side scattering by ∼21% versus an uncoated quartz rod. This waveguide behaviour allowed more efficient light absorption by defect states extending from the conduction and valence band edges of In2O3−x(OH)y. The CO production rates on a coated waveguide were significantly higher (by factors of 8.7 and 8.1, respectively) than a similarly coated planar substrate when UV or green cut-off filters were used to reject wavelengths shorter than 500 nm or 620 nm. The advantage of using optical fibre waveguides is the efficient packing of optical support-catalyst within a reactor volume. This maximizes catalytic film surface area, while utilizing the gaps between fibres as narrow gas flow channels.

(e) Transmittance spectra of coated and uncoated waveguides, with and without an aluminium foil end cap.44 
Additionally, commercial Ni and Cu metal foams were used as porous supports to maximize the catalyst loading and surface area-to-volume ratio of In2O3−x(OH)y while also increasing light penetration and contact with reactant gases.45 CO production rates were optimized by systematically tuning foam porosity, surface roughness, reactant gas velocity, and reaction temperature. In2O3−x(OH)y on nickel foams exhibited greater redox stability and higher CO production rates than In2O3−x(OH)y on copper foams. Elsewhere, it was found that when using In2O3−x(OH)y deposited on an oxidized nickel foam, a superior CO production rate was observed. Under solar illumination of 247 mW cm−2, the CO production rates of In2O3−x(OH)y on the oxidized nickel foam were 1.3 times higher than under dark.
Potential of photocatalytic processes
The engineering challenges facing photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation are not limited to photocatalyst and reactor development. When considering the potential implementation of a photocatalytic reaction at industrial scale, the entire process chain, including upstream and downstream unit operations, must be compared with other process designs (e.g., conventional thermal, electrochemical, or photo-electrochemical processes). A multitude of interdependent factors influence the outcome of this comparison, as shown in Fig. 8, which will be briefly introduced in this section.
 Fig. 8  Five important interdependent factors influencing the implementation potential of a photocatalytic process. 
Economics and overall efficiency
Even the visionary among us must admit that investors expect a return on their capital investment; in other words, the product value must exceed the process costs. While the product value is determined by the dynamics of the target market, the process costs are inevitably related to the use of available resources. To ensure economic feasibility, all resources must therefore be used efficiently, and the assessment and optimization of efficiencies in all process subsystems becomes indispensable. Unsurprisingly, in most energy applications the efficient use of the employed energy resources is of utmost importance.
An exact definition of an energy efficiency metric that is applicable to a broad variety of processes – and which would facilitate a fair comparison – is difficult for several reasons. One reason is that the significance of different forms of energy (e.g., chemical, thermal, mechanical, electrical, radiative) varies across process designs. Further complicating matters is the fact that, fundamentally, different forms of energy have different thermodynamic and economic value. A given amount of thermal energy (at, for instance, 100 °C) is of lower value than an exact same amount of electrical energy. This is because thermal energy can execute less thermodynamic work than electrical energy. One best-practice approach enabling the calculation of efficiencies while considering the thermodynamic value of different forms of energy, thereby linking the use of resources to the economic costs of process steps, is the concept of exergy.46 Exergy is defined as the maximum useful work that can be extracted from a system when it comes in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment.
Another, more-technical difficulty in assessing energy efficiencies of processes is that the overall and subsystem efficiencies and other process performance metrics are interdependent. A reactor with low conversion, for instance, will entail a large energy demand in subsequent product purification steps. Therefore, complex, and often non-linear, process models are needed to assess the overall efficiency of a process in advance. Aspen® or MATLAB Simulink® are commercial tools providing a framework for such modelling.47
Despite the challenges in comparing different forms of energy, researchers and engineers in the field of energy applications often use simplified process energy efficiencies, η, as shown in eqn (1). Of course, such efficiency definitions do not take account of the different thermodynamic or economic values of different forms of energy. 
(1)
The numerator represents the sum of useful energy outputs. It comprises the sum of energy contained in the products (given by the sum of the products of mass streams ṁi and higher heating values HHVi of products i), and the energy of useful extracted energy streams Ėj. This can be, for instance, heat flux at elevated temperature. The denominator is the sum of all energy inputs. It comprises the energy added to the process via chemical energy of the reactants (represented by sum of the products of mass streams ṁk and higher heating values HHVk of all reactants k) and other energy streams Ėl, such as a photon or heat flux, or electrical energy.
If solar energy was the only energy input and there was only one useful extracted energy stream (e.g. chemical energy in the form of hydrogen in an exemplary case of water splitting), the energy efficiency in eqn (1) would be called solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, which is a commonly reported efficiency metric in the field of solar fuels.
Exemplary aspects in assessments of photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation processes and process steps
By analogy to the overall energy efficiency, energy efficiencies for process steps can also be defined. Unsurprisingly, the solar-to-product or solar-to-fuel efficiency (ηSTX) of the synthesis step is the crucial parameter in assessing photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation processes.47ηSTX is defined by the photonic efficiencies of solar light collection and transport in the photoreactor, and the intrinsic photon efficiency of the photocatalyst employed. The experimental and/or theoretical assessment of the photon transport efficiency of a photoreactor including the light collector is non-trivial. Possible approaches include chemical actinometry following recommended protocols from IUPAC supplemented with optical simulations. Reactor design, in particular the geometry of light concentration and/or guiding elements, drastically influences photon transport efficiency in a photoreactor. Further complications are the interdependencies between photon absorption efficiency of a reactor/catalyst combination and radiation transport properties of the employed photocatalyst systems.
The determination of the intrinsic photon efficiency of the employed photocatalyst is no less challenging than the assessment of photon transport efficiencies. State-of-the-art methods applied in heterogeneous catalysis to quantitatively determine kinetic properties, such as rate constants of a given catalyst, are not applicable in photocatalysis.48 This is due to the dependence of the photochemical rate constant on quantum yield, incident light intensity, and light transport properties, which must be taken into account alongside the “traditional” thermodynamic state variables of temperature and pressure.
One method that may reveal information on the intrinsic photon efficiency of photo catalyst systems is photocurrent measurements. Photocurrent measurements provide insight into charge accumulation/recombination in an illuminated photo catalyst and further indicate reactivity with chemical precursor species.29,35,54 Some of the best practices associated with photocurrent measurements are: (1) a “sanity check” that the measured photocurrents are not above the integral of the absorptance and the solar spectrum; (2) considering the conversion efficiency from photons to thermalized charge carriers by including the optical losses of unabsorbed photons and the reduction in energy of the absorbed photons, as well as electrical contact losses; (3) evaluating the fill factor using a circuit model and an accompanying impedance spectroscopy measurement to separate resistive and capacitive behaviour; and (4) localizing charge-carrier behaviour with a geometric diffusion–recombination model that profiles the illumination absorption depth, carrier concentrations, and trap state distribution under steady-state conditions.
To simplify, the apparent quantum yield or photonic efficiency (ζp) has been introduced as a metric to determine the efficiency of a given photocatalyst: 
ζp(λ) = rate/I0(λ),
(2)where λ is the wavelength of the incident light and I0 represents the light intensity arriving at the inside of a flat front window of the photoreactor. The photonic efficiencies of different experiments and laboratories are, however, only comparable if an identical amount of light has been absorbed in each experiment. Due to the wide range of photoreactors used in different research laboratories, this is unlikely. Standardized testing methods based on, for instance, ISO oxidations of NOx (ISO 22197-1:2016) or acetaldehyde (ISO 22197-2:2011) have therefore been developed and should be applied to determine apparent quantum yields. Rigorous experimental protocols and thorough characterization of the employed photocatalysts, photoreactors, and light sources are instrumental to ensure accurate and reproducible results.
The photoreactor system represents the core element of a photocatalytic CO2 conversion process. However, CO2 capture is another important step that must be considered during the assessment of the process. Since CO2 capture from emission streams or from atmosphere, as well as the transportation of CO2, are crucial and energy-intensive steps in CO2 hydrogenation processes, their influence on the overall efficiency metric deserves a detailed assessment. A multitude of adsorption and absorption processes designed for different CO2 sources, including flue gas streams and the atmosphere, are available.49 Special attention should be paid to the possibility of integrating waste heat streams from process subsystems to cover the significant low-temperature heat demand of most CO2 capture processes. At the same time, the cost of CO2 requires smart process engineering of the subsequent synthesis steps to convert as much of the captured CO2 into products as possible. Using multiple passes of the gas stream over the catalyst might address incomplete conversion if one-pass conversion is not satisfactory. However, such a recycle will again entail an energetic cost that must be considered.3,47
Another important aspect in the assessment of photocatalytic processes is the land area, which is required to harvest sunlight. Land area dedicated exclusively for solar processes significantly impacts process economics and is directly linked to ηSTX of the synthesis step: when ηSTX is low, then a large area of land is required to supply the photons for the photocatalytic reaction, and vice versa. If implemented in world-scale production facilities, and even if ηSTX is high, land use will remain one of the major drawbacks of all solar energy technologies including photovoltaic and biomass-based approaches, as they all require either a direct or indirect sunlight harvesting process step. However, there are futuristic concepts avoiding, or at least reducing, the need for additional land utilization. For example, a retrofitting of existing infrastructures has been proposed, including buildings equipped with photovoltaic panels, fully autonomous units for extracting CO2 from ventilation air streams, and the on-site conversion to green fuel precursors.50
A tool that connects all the different aspects discussed above is the techno-economic assessment (TEA). TEAs based on detailed process modelling may reveal bottlenecks in process designs by allocating economic costs to each process step. For example, TEAs of different solar methanol process designs have revealed that, if the overall photon efficiency is low, the major cost-driving factor in a combined electro- and photochemical methanol synthesis plant is the photoreactor-catalyst combination.3 In encouraging contrast to the economic metrics cited for solar methanol, TEAs of photocatalytic hydrogen processes suggest that cost-competitive hydrogen production can be achieved simply via photoelectrochemical water splitting in low-cost plastic baggie reactors filled with photocatalyst slurry.51
At this point, it is important to address how thresholds must be met regarding crucial process parameters, such as the overall energy efficiency, so that a photocatalytic production process could compete with established fossil resource-based production. Exemplary values can often be extracted from the literature; for instance, at 10% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency for water splitting (using the above-mentioned low-cost baggie reactors) may yield cost-competitive hydrogen.51 From a broader perspective, this question is more difficult to address, as the answer depends strongly on the boundary conditions chosen for the TEA. Such boundary conditions are highly dependent on the existing political framework, including the implementation of CO2 taxes, the local availability of resources such as average solar irradiance and CO2 sources, and the locally and globally achievable revenues. A photocatalytic process with limited solar-to-product efficiency may be feasible in a sunlight-rich area with numerous local consumers, whereas another area with lower solar irradiance and inexpensive CO2 sources may see non-solar conversion processes as economically preferable.
Further complication arises because TEAs for photocatalytic processes must estimate prices for non-commercial components that are currently under development. Prototype photoreactors and concentrating optics are currently still expensive, and their application entails a higher cost for solar chemicals and fuels. Fortunately, though, mass production of these process components could soon be established, resulting in decreased component costs and improved process economics. This demonstrates that the TEA is, therefore, also dependent on assumptions made regarding the economy of scale and the future component-development costs.
In addition to economic aspects, the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential can be an important process selection criterion. To accurately assess the GHG reduction potential of a photocatalytic CO2 conversion process, the GHG footprint of reactants (CO2, H2O), installations (process unit operations) and products in a global network of supply chains and consumers must be considered. Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is a tool commonly used to perform these analyses. Standardized LCA procedures and guidelines have been developed, in particular ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. During the design phase of an LCA study, special attention should be devoted to the definition of scope and a careful selection of system boundaries. Inconsistencies should be avoided within a given study and when comparing the environmental impacts of competing processes to inform unbiased and rationally guided decisions. Imperatively, in the perspective of a state of global climate emergency the worlds resources should be invested into technologies which, for a given effort, promise the highest GHG emission reduction potential.
Although photocatalytic CO2 conversion processes are not yet cost competitive with fossil-driven production, they certainly are among the hot candidates to meet demands of a global society of environmentally conscious consumers.
Conclusions
The development of different kinds of renewable-energy-powered CO2 refineries stands to help curb greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade and play an important role in ameliorating climate change. To realize this utopian vision of a sustainable future, the discovery and optimization of highly active, selective and stable CO2 photocatalysts is imperative.
Catalytic metal oxides are capable of filling diverse roles in solid-state chemistry, physics and engineering, as well as being employed in the production of many industrial products, processes and devices. This prevalence of metal oxides is traceable to their myriad compositions, structures and forms, variations of which bestow upon their versatile properties, functionality and utility.
As has been discussed in this Tutorial Review, even greater variation in the properties of metal oxides can be achieved by modifying their stoichiometry via doping, isomorphic substitution, aliovalent modifications and non-stoichiometry, as well as by introducing nanostructures, heterostructures, superstructures, support materials and polymorphism. This strategy exemplified by indium oxide in its various guises has furthered the understanding of gas-phase heterogeneous CO2 photocatalysis while facilitating advancements in innovative photocatalyst discovery and engineering. The development of novel photoreactor designs has enabled more accurate performance testing of metal oxide photocatalysts while providing the groundwork for the up-scaling and future industrialization of CO2 photocatalysis. These advancements could well lead to future implementation of solar refineries for the manufacture of eco-friendly chemicals, pharmaceuticals, polymers, materials, and fuels from recycled CO2, thereby toward combating climate change.
