    , Accepted 2nd January 2018First published on 2nd January 2018AbstractDeveloping cost-effective and earth-abundant noble-metal-free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with high activity and durability is highly desirable for future renewable energy systems. Herein, we develop a facile and controllable approach to engineer a series of structurally tiered bimetallic Ni–Fe phosphide nanocomposites with well-designed architectures and compositions through the topological conversion of the flowerlike precursor of Ni–Fe layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Remarkably, benefitting from their special physicochemical features and desirable synergistic effect, the resultant bimetallic phosphides can serve as a class of advanced high-performance electrocatalysts for water oxidation with an extremely low overpotential of 233 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 42.5 mV dec−1, and strong durability (30 h of continuous water electrolysis), favourably representing the state-of-the-art level. This work elucidates the promising electrocatalytic performance of multinary transition-metal phosphides with controlled structures and compositions derived from LDHs for the OER.
1. Introduction
Molecular hydrogen (H2), as a sustainable and clean energy supply with a high calorific value and zero carbon emission, is regarded as an ideal candidate to substitute non-renewable fossil fuels in the future.1–3 Assuming that electricity can be acquired from solar power, direct electrolysis of water is then a promising and feasible route to produce high-purity H2 on a large scale.4 Generally, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two half-cell reactions of electrochemical water splitting. The OER, with a complex four-electron transfer process, is recognized as a bottleneck in water splitting because it is thermodynamically unfavourable and kinetically sluggish. Thus, effective electrocatalysts are required for the OER to achieve a high current density at a low overpotential.5,6 To date, the state-of-the-art catalysts for the OER are largely based on noble metals (e.g., IrO2 and RuO2),5,7 but the high cost and scarcity of these metals significantly limit their large-scale practical application. As a consequence, a great deal of effort has been made to develop effective alternatives,8–15 preferably using low-cost transition-metal oxides,16–18 hydroxides,19 chalcogenides,20–22 nitrides,23 and heteroatom-doped carbon-based materials.24,25
Transition-metal phosphides (TMPs) have recently emerged as a class of promising earth-abundant electrocatalysts not only for the HER but also for the OER.26–33 Impressively, it has been found that their electrocatalytic activities in the OER could be even superior to those of their corresponding oxide/hydroxide counterparts.26,34,35 However, compared to the well-established noble-metal-based catalysts, future applications of TMP-based electrocatalysts are hampered by their complicated preparation processes and limited electroactive sites due to technical difficulties in controlling the chemical composition and optimizing the structural properties.36 Thus, developing facile synthetic methodologies to fabricate active and robust TMP-based electrocatalysts with well-designed architectures and compositions for the OER is highly desirable, yet remains a great challenge.
On the other hand, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of 2D anionic clays, which are composed of positively charged brucite-like host layers and charge-balancing anions in the interlayer space.37,38 In addition to their economic advantage, their metal cations are atomically dispersed, and the chemical compositions of LDHs are designable within a wide range, promising a variety of functionalities. For example, the incorporation of electrochemically active metal cations (e.g., Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) can endow LDHs with electrocatalytic OER activity.39–41 Particularly, it has been well known that NiFe-based LDH materials are a type of state-of-the-art OER catalyst with precious-metal-free compositions. Nevertheless, demanding preparation procedures including intercalation and exfoliation of LDHs are generally required to achieve a commendable activity, which apparently hinder their potential large-scale applications.41–43
In order to take advantage of the high efficiency of TMPs, it seems reasonable to speculate that direct topological phosphidation of LDHs might be a viable route to produce mixed bimetallic phosphides for further enhanced electrocatalytic performance. To test this hypothesis, the process feasibility is explored. As shown in Scheme 1, herein, we report our recent research endeavor in transformative phosphidation of NiFe-LDH to bimetallic Ni–Fe phosphides (denoted as NiFe-P hereafter for simplicity). Interestingly, the transformation reaction is topological and highly controlled. With the elegant control over the structure and chemical composition, the resulting nanostructured NiFe-P exhibits extraordinarily high electrocatalytic activity and stability for the water oxidation reaction, which is not only superior to its precursor NiFe-LDH, but also even comparable to the state-of-the-art transition-metal-based and noble-metal-based OER catalysts.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and reagents
The following chemicals were used as received without any further purification: Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich), urea (99.5%, Fluka), NH4F (≥99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2, >98%, Sigma-Aldrich), methanol (99.99%, Fisher), ethanol (99.99%, Fisher), isopropanol (99.99%, Fisher) and perfluorosulfonic acid–PTFE copolymer (Nafion; 5% w/w in water). Deionized water was generated by using an Elga Micromeg water purification system.
2.2. Preparation of flowerlike NiFe(n:1)-P
Here take the preparation of NiFe(3:1)-P (in which the molar ratio of Ni:Fe = 3:1) as an example. Firstly, flowerlike NiFe(3:1)-LDH particles were synthesized by a novel and facile one-pot solvothermal method. In a typical synthesis, briefly, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (3 mmol), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (1 mmol) and urea (11 mmol) were dissolved in 30 mL of methanol. Then 25 mg of NH4F were added. The above mixture was stirred and then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 150 °C for 8 h. The product was centrifuged, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol several times and dried in an electric oven at 60 °C for 12 h.
The flowerlike NiFe(3:1)-P was prepared by using a low-temperature phosphidation method. In a typical synthesis, the as-obtained flowerlike NiFe(3:1)-LDH and NaH2PO2 were placed at two separate positions in a porcelain boat and charged into a tube furnace with NaH2PO2 at the upstream side of the furnace. The molar ratio of metal-to-phosphorus was about 1:20. Subsequently, the samples were heated at 300 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under a N2 flow (20 mL min−1), and then naturally cooled to ambient temperature.
The synthesis conditions for the preparation of other NiFe(n:1)-P samples with different Ni:Fe molar ratios (n = 1, 5, 7, and 9) were similar to those of NiFe(3:1)-P, but with different feeding ratios between Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O; the total molar amount of metal salt was fixed at 4 mmol in the starting solution during the precursor preparation step. The phosphidation temperature was also set at 300 °C for all the samples unless otherwise specified, and the amounts of metal salts used in the experiments are listed in Table S1.†
To investigate temperature effects on the above catalysts, a series of NiFe(3:1)-P samples treated at different phosphidation temperatures (named NiFe(3:1)-P-T, T = 200, 400, 500, and 600 °C) were also prepared. Their preparation conditions were similar to those of NiFe(3:1)-P obtained at 300 °C, while holding at different stabilizing phosphidation temperatures (i.e., 200, 400, 500, and 600 °C) respectively for 2 h.
2.3. Preparation of control samples

2.3.1 Flowerlike NiFe(3:1)-LDO. 
Flowerlike NiFe(3:1)-LDO was fabricated by calcination of the flowerlike NiFe(3:1)-LDH precursor at 300 °C for 2 h under air with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1.


2.3.2 Flowerlike NiPx. 
Firstly, the flowerlike Ni-precursor was prepared through the aforementioned procedure for NiFe(3:1)-LDH while without the addition of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O during the synthesis. Then the flowerlike NiPx was fabricated by the conversion of the flowerlike Ni-precursor, with a similar low-temperature phosphidation route to that adopted for the preparation of NiFe(3:1)-P.


2.3.3 Flowerlike FePx. 
Firstly, the flowerlike Fe-precursor was prepared through the aforementioned procedure for NiFe(3:1)-LDH while without the addition of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O during the synthesis. Then the flowerlike FePx was fabricated by the conversion of the flowerlike Fe-precursor, with a similar low-temperature phosphidation route to that adopted for the preparation of NiFe(3:1)-P.

2.4. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were carried out using a computer-controlled electrochemical workstation (Autolab, PGSTAT 302N) with a standard three-electrode system, in which a catalyst-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) was used as the working electrode, a Pt plate as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (filled with 3 M KCl solution) electrode as the reference electrode. The preparation of the working electrode was as follows: the solid catalyst (3 mg) and Vulcan XC-72 carbon (3 mg) were dispersed in 977.6 μL of water, 244.4 μL of ethanol and 50.92 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution. Then a homogeneous catalyst ink was obtained by ultrasonicating the mixture for about 30 min. Next, 3 μL of the catalyst ink was loaded onto the GCE (loading amount for all the samples: about 0.1 mg cm−2). Finally, the electrode was dried at room temperature overnight. Prior to all the experiments, the electrolyte solution (1.0 M KOH) was purged with O2 for 30 min. Before the electrochemical catalytic measurements, all the working electrodes were characterized by continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) several times at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 until the signals were relatively stabilized. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 to obtain the polarization curves. All the polarization curves were corrected with iR-compensation. A long-term stability test was performed by chronopotentiometric (CP) measurement in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with the current density at 10 mA cm−2.
In this work, the electrochemical measurements were carried out on at least four working electrodes to check the reproducibility and their average was taken into account. The working electrode was continuously rotated at 1600 rpm to get rid of the oxygen bubbles. All the current densities were normalised to the geometrical area of the GCE, and all the measured potentials vs. Ag/AgCl (3.0 M KCl) were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.210 + 0.0591 × pH.
2.5. Materials characterization
The microscopic features of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL-6700F) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer (Oxford INCA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010, 200 kV), and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, 200 kV). Elemental mapping was done by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Oxford Instruments, model 7426). Wide-angle X-ray (Cu Kα radiation) diffraction patterns were taken using a Bruker D8 Advance system. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis (Dual-view Optima 5300 DV ICP-OES) was used to determine the elemental compositions of the samples. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under a N2 stream (50 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 using a Shimadzu TGA-50 instrument. The surface composition and oxidation state of the samples were further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS-HSi, Kratos Analytical) with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.71 eV). All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak (284.5 eV) arising from the C–C bonds.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation and characterization of catalysts
The NiFe-LDH precursor was fabricated via a one-pot solvothermal process using metal nitrates as metal precursors, urea as the base, NH4F as the mineralizer, and methanol as the solvent (Scheme 1). In the case of NiFe(3:1)-LDH, as revealed by a morphological investigation (SEM and TEM techniques; Fig. 1a, b and S1†), the as-synthesized NiFe(3:1)-LDH exhibits a flowerlike hierarchical structure (ca. 1–1.5 μm in particle size) formed by a large number of nanoscale petals connected with each other. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 2) indicates the characteristic (00l) reflections which can be assigned readily to the standard LDH phase. It is worth mentioning that the solvent plays a critical role in the formation of the above nanosheet assemblages with hierarchical structures. For example, by using pure deionized water, aggregated flakes together with small clusters are obtained (Fig. S2a and b†); by using ethanol or isopropanol as the solvent, only irregular and severely aggregated particles can be produced (Fig. S2c and d†). Besides, the concentration of urea during preparation is also important. When the urea content was reduced by half, small aggregated clusters were generated (Fig. S3a†), while doubling or tripling of the fed urea led to the formation of large aggregated particles (Fig. S3b and c†).

 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of the NiFe(3:1)-LDH precursor and NiFe(3:1)-P. 
The NiFe(3:1)-LDH precursor was then subjected to a low-temperature (300 °C) phosphidation treatment, and the XRD pattern of the product (Fig. 2) presents superimposed diffraction peaks which can be indexed to the Ni2P phase (PDF card no. 03-0953) and FeP phase (PDF card no. 65-2595), respectively, while no diffraction peaks assignable to the residual NiFe(3:1)-LDH are detected, suggesting the successful transformation of the precursor NiFe(3:1)-LDH to bimetallic phosphides. Besides, the EDX elemental mapping (Fig. 1g) of NiFe(3:1)-P indicates the coexistence of Ni, Fe and P elements, and all of them are uniformly distributed throughout the sample. The SEM and TEM examinations (Fig. 1c–e and S4a–d†) show that the NiFe(3:1)-P largely inherits the original flowerlike morphology, while the petal building blocks, owing to gas evolution, dehydration and phosphidation of the NiFe(3:1)-LDH, become perforated with a rough surface and are composed of inter-stacked or interconnected nanoparticles (10–20 nm in size) of two metal phosphides. The HRTEM images in Fig. 1f, S4e and f† display clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.188, 0.221, and 0.203 nm, which belong to the d-spacing of the FeP (211) plane, and the d-spacings of Ni2P (111) and Ni2P (201) planes, respectively, further verifying the formation of Ni2P and FeP phases in the NiFe(3:1)-P sample. In principle, such a hierarchical, porous structure would be extremely beneficial for catalytic processes because of a fuller exposure of active sites and a lower diffusion barrier of mass transfer.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to study the surface chemical states of the NiFe(3:1)-P sample. The survey spectrum (Fig. 3a) confirms the presence of Ni, Fe, and P elements. In the Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 3b), the peak at 853.2 eV can be attributed to Ni in Ni2P, and the peak at 856.3 eV is assigned to the oxidized Ni species arising from superficial oxidation with air contact.44 For the Fe 2p segment (Fig. 3c), the peak at 707.0 eV is ascribed to Fe in FeP, while the peak at 711.8 eV to a surface species of oxidized Fe.32,45 In the P 2p spectrum (Fig. 3d), the peaks at 129.4 and 130.5 eV are attributable to P–M (M = Ni, Fe) species, and the peaks at 133.2 and 134.3 eV originated from P–O species.46,47 The above XPS analysis demonstrates the successful preparation of bimetallic Ni–Fe phosphides.

For a comparative study, a series of control samples with similar flowerlike morphologies including the calcination-derived product (e.g., NiFe-layered double oxides, NiFe(3:1)-LDO) and the monometallic phosphides (e.g., NiPx and FePx) were also prepared. Their detailed synthesis procedures and characterization results (including SEM, TEM and XRD) are given in Fig. 4 and the ESI (Fig. S5–S14†). Briefly, flowerlike NiFe(3:1)-LDO was obtained by directly calcining the NiFe(3:1)-LDH precursor at 300 °C under air atmosphere. The recorded XRD pattern (Fig. S6†) reveals that the product is composed of NiO (PDF card no. 47-1049) and Fe2O3 (PDF card no. 25-1402) phases. Similarly, flowerlike NiPx and FePx samples were fabricated by facile phosphidation of their respective monometallic precursors prepared via modified solvothermal routes used in the NiFe(3:1)-LDH synthesis. The XRD analysis confirms the formation of the Ni2P phase (PDF card no. 03-0953) in the NiPx sample and the FeP phase (PDF card no. 65-2595) in the FePx sample (Fig. S10 and S14†).

3.2. Electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts
The electrocatalytic performance of NiFe(3:1)-P for the OER was evaluated in a standard three-electrode system with 1.0 M KOH as the electrolyte (see the details in the Experimental section). In comparison, NiFe(3:1)-LDH, NiFe(3:1)-LDO, NiPx and FePx with a similar flowerlike morphology were also studied as control catalysts. Fig. 5a displays the polarization curves. As a simple conductor, the bare GCE shows no catalytic contribution to the OER. The operating potential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is a commonly adopted index to evaluate the OER activity of a catalyst, as it is approximately the current density for a 10% efficient solar-to-fuel conversion device.5 As clearly demonstrated (Fig. 5a and c), the NiFe(3:1)-LDH precursor, with its hierarchical architecture built of interconnected nanopetals, requires a low overpotential of 280 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2, an excellent activity even better than those of highly active LDH-based catalysts obtained via tedious exfoliation procedures.40,41 After the facile topological phosphidation, the as-obtained NiFe(3:1)-P demonstrates a remarkably enhanced OER activity. A much larger current density can be delivered by NiFe(3:1)-P at the same operating overpotential (e.g., 114 and 20 mA cm−2 at 300 mV for NiFe(3:1)-P and NiFe(3:1)-LDH, respectively; Fig. 5e). In particular, NiFe(3:1)-P only needs an overpotential of as low as 233 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which corresponds to a negative shift of 47 mV compared with that of the NiFe(3:1)-LDH precursor, revealing that the transformation of LDHs through phosphidation treatment is indeed a promising strategy to further promote the OER activity. The remarkable OER activity of NiFe(3:1)-P is also much better than that of the commercial RuO2 benchmark, which requires 342 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 (see the LSV curve in Fig. S15a†). Significantly, it is worth noting that NiFe(3:1)-P presented here is among the best TMP-based OER catalysts reported to date in the literature,26,34,35,44,48 and it also rivals most highly active electrocatalysts based on transition metals and noble metals.5,49–51 A detailed comparison with different OER catalysts is provided in Table S3.†
 Fig. 5  Electrochemical performances of the flowerlike NiFe(3:1)-P, NiFe(3:1)-LDH, NiFe(3:1)-LDO, NiPx and FePx samples: (a) polarization curves, (b) Tafel plots, (c) required overpotential obtained from the OER polarization curves at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, (d) Tafel slopes of the samples, and (e) current density achieved at an overpotential of 300 mV. In all these measurements, the scan rate was 5 mV s−1, the catalyst loading was about 0.10 mg cm−2, and the electrolyte used was 1.0 M KOH. 
On the other hand, the monometallic phosphides, NiPx and FePx, need a much larger overpotential to attain 10 mA cm−2 (305 and 420 mV, respectively). The superior performance of our NiFe(3:1)-P to the corresponding monometallic counterparts is probably attributable to the synergistic coupling effect between the two different metal phosphides with optimized local electronic states owing to the presence of heterojunctions (namely between Ni2P and FeP). To better elucidate this claim, we further performed a comparative XPS analysis on the two control samples NiPx and FePx, which indeed sheds light on the electronic structure modulation behavior of our NiFe(3:1)-P sample. As displayed in Fig. S16,† the Ni 2p2/3 binding energy in NiFe(3:1)-P exhibits a positive shift of 0.3 eV relative to monometallic NiPx, whereas the Fe 2p2/3 binding energy shows a negative shift of 0.4 eV relative to monometallic FePx, suggesting the occurrence of appreciable electronic modulation in the NiFe(3:1)-P. Recent theoretical computations and experimental validations revealed that the incorporation of the second metal species can finely tailor the coordination environment and electronic structure of the catalytically active centers, thus dramatically boosting the electrocatalytic activities of transition-metal-based materials.8,13,15,52–54 On the basis of the above results, therefore, we propose that in our bimetallic NiFe-P samples, the intimate contact between Ni2P and FeP phases and the inter-doping of Ni and Fe species can optimize the electronic structure of catalytic sites, thereby facilitating the adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates and promoting their OER activity. Additionally, the calcination-derived sample, NiFe(3:1)-LDO, gives a moderate OER activity with an overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Obviously, the NiFe(3:1)-LDO catalyst underperforms the NiFe(3:1)-LDH precursor and NiFe(3:1)-P too. The above results are consistent with the previous finding that TMPs, with well-designed chemistry and structures, are capable of outperforming their corresponding hydroxides/oxides in the OER.26
The Tafel slope was further determined to evaluate the OER kinetics. As illustrated in Fig. 5b and d, the Tafel slope of the NiFe(3:1)-P sample (42.5 mV dec−1) is the smallest among all the samples including NiFe(3:1)-LDH (52.0 mV dec−1), NiFe(3:1)-LDO (58.3 mV dec−1), NiPx (62.0 mV dec−1), and FePx (120.1 mV dec−1). Notably, this value is also comparable to those of the most active OER catalysts reported in the literature (Table S3†), indicative of favourable OER kinetics of the NiFe(3:1)-P electrocatalyst.
3.3. Phosphidation temperature and OER activity
In order to investigate the impact of the phosphidation temperature on the OER activity of the NiFe(3:1)-P electrocatalyst, apart from 300 °C, other temperatures (i.e., 200, 400, 500, and 600 °C) were also applied to treat NiFe(3:1)-LDH with NaH2PO2. The morphologies of these phosphidation products (NiFe(3:1)-P-T, T = 200, 400, 500, and 600 °C) were characterized with a SEM technique. As shown in Fig. S17a and b,† similar to that of NiFe(3:1)-P-300 °C (Fig. 1), the flowerlike morphology was also largely reserved in these samples, when the phosphidation temperatures were relatively low (i.e., 200 and 400 °C). Under harsher treatment conditions (i.e., 500 and 600 °C), however, the samples sintered severely, leading to the destruction of the original flowerlike structure (Fig. S17c and d†). It is worth noting that at low phosphidation temperature (e.g., 200 °C), the as-obtained product was still in an earth-brown colour, rather than the black characteristic of the metal phosphides. The XRD pattern of NiFe(3:1)-P-200 °C displays good retention of the typical LDH phase (Fig. S18†), indicating that 200 °C is not high enough for the conversion of NiFe-LDH to NiFe-P. Also, from the TGA curve of NaH2PO2 (Fig. S19†), two obvious weight-loss steps (i.e., the thermal decomposition steps) are observed at around 300 and 375 °C, further evidencing that 200 °C is not sufficient to proceed phosphidation reaction with NaH2PO2. For the other products prepared with higher phosphidation temperatures (i.e., 400, 500, and 600 °C), Ni/Fe phosphide phases were successfully achieved, as shown in their XRD patterns (Fig. S18†), but their structures became much more condensed (Fig. S17c and d†).
The OER activities of the above NiFe(3:1)-P-T samples with different phosphidation temperatures were also tested, and their polarization curves are shown in Fig. 6a. In particular, NiFe(3:1)-P-200 °C gives similar OER activity to its parent NiFe(3:1)-LDH (272 and 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively), which is understandable considering that both samples have a pristine LDH crystal phase and the same morphology. Furthermore, it can be clearly observed that with the increase in the phosphidation temperature, the OER activities of the products gradually decline (233, 256, 273, and 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for NiFe(3:1)-P-300, 400, 500, and 600 °C, respectively, Fig. 6a and b). The observed deactivation trend can be attributed to sintering induced structural deterioration at elevated temperatures (Fig. S17†), accompanied by fewer active sites and less effective mass diffusion/transfer. The trend of activity deterioration with elevated phosphidation temperature demonstrates again that the morphological structure has a critical impact on the catalytic performance of the electrocatalyst. Once again, we show that hierarchical, open, and porous architectures for OER catalysts are indeed highly desirable.

(b) The required overpotential obtained from the OER polarization curves at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the NiFe(3:1)-P-T samples. In all measurements, the scan rate was 5 mV s−1, the catalyst loading was about 0.10 mg cm−2, and the electrolyte used was 1.0 M KOH. 
3.4. Chemical composition and OER activity
To further examine the compositional effect of NiFe-P on OER activity, a series of NiFe(n:1)-P samples with different Ni:Fe molar ratios derived from their corresponding NiFe(n:1)-LDH precursors were also prepared; the phosphidation temperature for all these samples was fixed at 300 °C. As displayed in Fig. S20,† the NiFe(n:1)-LDH precursors (n = 1, 5, 7, and 9), despite having different metal feeds (Ni:Fe molar ratios from 1:1 to 9:1, Experimental section), possess a similar flowerlike morphology to the NiFe(3:1)-LDH, indicating the generality of our synthetic protocol for fabricating hierarchical LDH precursors with controllable compositions. From our XRD study (Fig. 7a), we see that all the samples indeed have a LDH crystalline phase. After the phosphidation treatments, this series of NiFe(n:1)-P samples could thus be generated (the actual Ni:Fe molar ratios in the NiFe(n:1)-P are listed in Table S2†), which retained the flowerlike morphology (Fig. S21†) as the NiFe(3:1)-P did. The XRD patterns (Fig. 7b) indicate that the NiFe(1:1)-P is composed of the mixed phases of the Ni2P phase and FeP phase. For the NiFe(n:1)-P (n = 5, 7, and 9) samples with a higher Ni content, however, only a Ni2P-like phase can be indexed, indicating that the Fe species is homogeneously doped into the Ni2P phase. Then the OER activities of these samples were investigated, and as reported in Fig. 7c, all of the samples exhibit excellent OER activities, although the NiFe(3:1)-P still shows to be the best. More specifically, they follow the activity order of NiFe(3:1)-P > NiFe(5:1)-P ≈ NiFe(7:1)-P > NiFe(9:1)-P > NiFe(1:1)-P, with an overpotential of 233, 245, 246, 250, and 270 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 7d). That is to say, by regulating the Ni:Fe molar ratio, the OER activity of the NiFe(n:1)-P samples can be conveniently optimized with this approach.

(d) The required overpotential obtained from the OER polarization curves at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the NiFe(n:1)-P samples. In all measurements, the scan rate was 5 mV s−1, the catalyst loading was about 0.10 mg cm−2, and the electrolyte used was 1.0 M KOH. 
3.5. Durability and catalytic mechanism
Since the durability is another important indicator for the OER catalyst, the stability of NiFe(3:1)-P was further examined by long-term electrolysis at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 8a, the high activity was retained well over a galvanostatic measurement of 30 h, confirming the excellent stability of NiFe(3:1)-P in the prolonged electrochemical process. The morphology of NiFe(3:1)-P did not change pronouncedly before or after the electrolysis (Fig. 8b–d), although some flakes emerged to encapsulate the spent sample. These small flakes are likely to be the in situ generated surface Ni–Fe oxo/hydroxides during the electrolysis, which will be discussed below in detail.

To gain insight into its structure–performance relationship, the spent NiFe(3:1)-P electrocatalyst after the stability test was further characterized using XPS and EDX elemental mapping techniques. As shown in Fig. S22a and b,† the peaks at 853.2 eV (Ni 2p) and 707.0 eV (Fe 2p) assigned to the surface metal phosphide species are almost invisible, while the intensities of the peaks corresponding to oxidized Ni and Fe species increase significantly, suggesting the formation of superficial oxidized metal species. Consistently, serious weakening of the overall P signal is observed in the P 2p spectrum (Fig. S22c†). Meanwhile, the peaks at 129.4 and 130.5 eV for P–M (M = Ni and Fe) species disappear, and only the weak band at around 133.7 eV assigned to P–O species is barely observable, verifying the surface oxidation of NiFe(3:1)-P. Besides, from the EDX elemental mappings of the spent NiFe(3:1)-P (Fig. 8e), it can be found that the O signal becomes quite strong, while P element is mainly confined in the inner region, further revealing the formation of a quasi-core–shell structure with Ni–Fe oxo/hydroxide species on the outer shell. Similar phosphorus replacements by oxygen have also been observed in the other TMP-based OER systems.26,55,56 Taken all together, it is now known that the surface of NiFe(3:1)-P has been largely converted to Ni–Fe oxo/hydroxides during the OER process. Such transformation is likely responsible for the observed enhanced OER activity.
On the basis of the above results, the excellent performance of NiFe(3:1)-P can be related to its unique physicochemical and structural properties: (i) the hierarchical flowerlike architecture attained by stacked nanoscale petals ensures excellent electrical and mechanical contact; (ii) the porosity in the flowerlike catalysts offers a fuller exposure of electroactive sites and an easier mass diffusion for the OER; and (iii) the synergistic coupling effect between different metal species in the Ni–Fe phosphide nanocomposite together with the in situ generated quasi-core–shell heterostructure (i.e., nanocomposite) of phosphide and oxo-hydroxide can further boost the electrocatalytic activity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have reported the engineering and fabrication of hierarchical bimetallic Ni–Fe phosphide nanocomposites with well-controlled structures and compositions through the facile topological phosphidation of the corresponding flowerlike LDH precursor. A series of key synthetic parameters are optimized, and their impacts on the physicochemical structural properties as well as the electrocatalytic OER performances of the as-obtained products are systematically investigated in detail. Notably, the optimal NiFe(3:1)-P catalyst is able to perform as a type of advanced OER catalyst with an overpotential of as low as 233 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 42.5 mV dec−1, and remarkable working durability. It presents a much better OER catalytic activity than the corresponding NiFe-LDH precursor, NiFe-LDO, and individual counterparts NiPx and FePx; it is also comparable or even superior to the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts reported to date. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of NiFe-P can be associated with its well-controlled architectural and compositional features, the synergistic coupling effect between different metal species, and the in situ transformation to the phosphide/oxo-hydroxide heterostructure during the OER. The work presented here provides a promising and efficient route to explore highly active and durable noble-metal-free electrocatalysts based on TMPs for the OER and other renewable energy applications.
