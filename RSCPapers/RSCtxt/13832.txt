    , Accepted 24th September 2015First published on 28th September 2015AbstractWe here report a novel photoassisted chargeable Li-ion battery (LIB) consisting of a LiFePO4 cathode, a lithium anode and a TiO2 photoelectrode coupled with an iodide (I−) ion redox shuttle for saving electric energy. Due to the contribution of the photovoltage, the photocharging voltage of the LiFePO4 cathode is reduced to 2.78 V, which is lower than the discharge voltage of 3.41 V, resulting in ∼20% electric energy saving. This new conceptual design will provide a possible route for direct conversion and storage of solar energy in LIBs.
The replacement of internal combustion engine cars with electric vehicles will require the development of advanced rechargeable batteries.1–3 Among numerous energy storage devices, rechargeable LIBs are considered as a promising generation of power sources due to their high specific energy and power, long cycle life and so on.4–10 Conventional LIBs are generally composed of an anode, a non-aqueous Li+ conducting electrolyte, and a cathode. During the charging process, the cathode materials are oxidized to their oxidation form (Cox) with releasing Li+ ions, while the electrons are transported from the cathode to the anode through an external circuit. In this process, an extra electric energy is needed to realize the conversion of electric energy to chemical energy. In order to save the extra electric energy during the charging process, more recent efforts have been focused on ways to utilize solar energy to power LIBs. Some early attempts have been focused on the direct integration of a photovoltaic cell and a capacitor/battery into one device for realizing the conversion and storage from solar energy to electricity.11–17 Guo et al.17 demonstrated an integrated device by hybridizing a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with a battery, which gives a discharge capacity of 0.038 mA h. However, the use of embedded DSSCs greatly increases the cost and also causes unstable cycling performance. Very recently, we have introduced a photocatalyst into the aqueous polysulfide cathode to realize the direct storage of solar energy in the lithium–sulfur battery.18 During the photocharging process, the cathode material, S2− ions are oxidized to polysulfide ions by photoexcited holes in the photocatalyst. However, because most of the cathode materials for conventional LIBs are insulating and insoluble in organic/aqueous electrolytes, they are hard to be directly oxidized by photoexcited holes in the photoelectrode.
Herein, a novel strategy to save electric energy of the charging process for LIBs by using a photoelectrode with a redox shuttle has been introduced and demonstrated with LiFePO4 as an example. With the aid of the TiO2 photoelectrode with an I−/I3− redox shuttle, we demonstrate a photoassisted chargeable Li–LiFePO4 battery with a charge voltage of 2.78 V, which is lower than the discharge voltage of 3.41 V, resulting in ∼20% electric energy saving. Due to the contribution of the photovoltage, the battery's charging voltage is greatly lower than the discharging voltage, which is thermodynamically impossible without the solar energy input. For the first time, we reduced the charging voltage of the LiFePO4 cathode to 2.78 V by introducing a photoelectrode with a redox shuttle into the LIB for saving electric energy.

Fig. 1a outlines the structure of our photoassisted chargeable LIB. It consists of a metallic Li anode with an organic electrolyte, a Li1.35Ti1.75Al0.25P2.7Si0.3O12 (LATP) glass ceramic separator, a LiFePO4 cathode with an aqueous electrolyte, and a TiO2 photoelectrode. An aqueous electrode has the characteristics of not only reliable safety and low cost but also a reduced heating effect during a long-term illumination. Both the LiFePO4 cathode and the TiO2 photoelectrode are in contact with the redox shuttle (M). In the charging process, the charging voltage is applied on the Li anode and TiO2 photoelectrode. Under illumination, an oxidation reaction occurs on the photoelectrode first, Mred is oxidized to Mox by photoexcited holes on TiO2. Subsequently, the Mox diffuses to the LiFePO4 electrode surface and oxidizes LiFePO4 to Li+ and FePO4, and is in turn reduced back to Mred, thereby completing a full redox cycle. Meanwhile, the photoexcited electron transfers to the anode through the external circuit, where it then reduces the Li+ ion to Li metal. Consequently, the photovoltage generated on the TiO2 photoelectrode compensates the battery's charging potential. As presented in Fig. 1b, the photoassisted charging potential equals the energy difference between the redox potential of the Li+/Li couple and the quasi-Fermi level of the electrons in the TiO2 photoelectrode (which is near to the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2). Since the CB potential of TiO2 (∼2.6 V)19,20 is lower than the LiFePO4/FePO4 standard potential of 3.45 V,21 the photocharging voltage is expected to be lower than that of conventional Li–LiFePO4 batteries.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of a photoassisted chargeable LIB with a three electrode system. Upon charging under illumination, the photoelectrode and anode are connected to the outside circuit. The redox shuttle Mred on this electrode is first oxidized to Mox and then diffuses to the LiFePO4 cathode. By oxidizing the LiFePO4 into FePO4 and Li+, the Mox gets reduced back to Mred. While upon discharging, the cathode and anode are connected to the outside circuit, and the intercalation of Li+ makes FePO4 reduce back to LiFePO4. (b) The energy diagram of the photochargeble LIB. The saved voltage is determined by the energy difference between the charging voltage of the LIB and the quasi-Fermi level of electrons in the semiconductor (near to its CB). 
A suitable redox shuttle is the key component of the photoassisted chargeable LIB, which has to fulfill two essential conditions: (1) Mred should be oxidized to Mox by photoexcited holes on the TiO2 photoelectrode. (2) Mox should enable the chemical oxidation from LiFePO4 to FePO4 and Li+ ions. Here, we considered I− ions as the redox shuttle for our system, and it is essential to confirm that I− ions will work efficiently. Despite the fact that I−/I3− ions are used as a traditional redox shuttle for DSSCs,22–26 not much attention is paid to the combination of the TiO2 photoelectrode and I−/I3− ions in aqueous electrolytes. Therefore, we started with investigating the photoelectrochemical oxidation reaction (2h+ + 3I− → I3−). The photoelectrode was rutile-phase TiO2 nanorods grown on a Ti mesh, the morphology and crystal structure were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2a) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. 2b). The open structure, as revealed in the SEM images, allows the free diffusion of I−/I3− ions in the electrolyte between the photoelectrode and the LiFePO4 cathode. To investigate the interaction between I− ions and the TiO2 photoelectrode, an aqueous solution of 0.05 M I− ions with the TiO2 photoelectrode was analyzed by using the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra after 1 h illumination. As shown in Fig. 2c, two peaks attributed to I3− ions (288 and 350 nm) were identified,27 proving the feasible photoelectrochemical oxidation reaction from I− to I3− ions aided by the TiO2 photoelectrode.

(c) UV-Vis spectra of 0.05 M I− ion solution containing the TiO2 photoelectrode after 1 h illumination. (d) XRD patterns of the LiFePO4 (black line) and the product (red line) prepared by placing 50 mg LiFePO4 in an aqueous solution of 0.01 M I3− for 10 min. 
We then consider the chemical delithiation process of LiFePO4 by I3− ions. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) reveals that the potential of the I−/I3− redox couple is about 3.55 V (Fig. S1†), consistent with the earlier study,28 higher than the LiFePO4/FePO4 standard potential of 3.45 V.21 Hence, the oxidation of LiFePO4 by I3− is thermodynamically feasible with a driving potential of 0.1 V. The chemical delithiation reaction was examined by monitoring the crystal structure changes of LiFePO4 in I3− aqueous solution. After soaking the LiFePO4 powders in an aqueous solution of 0.01 M I3− ions for 10 min, the crystal structure of LiFePO4 completely transformed into that of FePO4 (Fig. 2d), indicating that the I3− ions can rapidly oxidize LiFePO4 into FePO4 in a very short time. Based on the above results, the I−/I3− ions can be used as the redox shuttle for the photoelectrochemical oxidation reaction (eqn (1) and (2)) and the chemical delithiation of LiFePO4 (eqn (3)) during the photocharging process, described as the following equations TiO2 + hν → h+ + e−(1) 2h+ + 3I− → I3−(2) I3− + 2LiFePO4 → 2FePO4 + 3I− + 2Li+(3)
First we investigate the electrochemical performance of a LIB containing a metallic Li anode with an organic electrolyte, a LATP separator, and a LiFePO4 cathode with an aqueous electrolyte. It shows an average charging voltage of 3.45 V and a discharging voltage of 3.41 V (Fig. S2†), consistent with the reported redox potential of LiFPO4/FePO4 in an aqueous electrolyte.29,30 The charging and discharging capacities are 149 and 138 mA h g−1, respectively. The CV measurement between 3.1 and 4.0 V reveals that the aqueous cathode was electrochemically stable evidenced by neither H2 nor O2 evolution (Fig. S1†).
The charging and discharging curves of the photoassisted chargeable LIB and LIB are shown in Fig. 3. Under illumination, the photoassisted chargeable LIB delivers a charging voltage of 2.78 V at a current density of 0.02 mA cm−2, which matches well with the theoretical prediction, considering the CB potential of TiO2 (∼2.6 V). Compared to the LIB, which has a charging voltage of 3.45 V, the photoassisted chargeable LIB achieves a voltage reduction of 0.7 V, resulting in an energy saving of 20% (0.7/3.45 × 100%). After a 3 h photocharging process, our photoassisted chargeable LIB delivers a long discharge voltage plateau at about 3.41 V and a discharge capacity of 104 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.01 mA cm−2 (all discharge current densities in this work are 0.01 mA cm−2), which is similar to that of the LIB (Fig. 3b). It is noticeable that this charging voltage is lower than the discharging voltage, which is thermodynamically impossible without the solar energy input. Once the illumination was removed, the charging voltage is increased to 3.62 V immediately, and this phenomenon is observed to be consistent and repeatable at least in three repeat cycles (Fig. 3c). Such a fast photo-response behavior effectively demonstrates our proposed working mechanism of the photoassisted charging.

(b) The discharge curves of the photoassisted chargeable LIB (red line) and the LIB (black line) at a current density of 0.01 mA cm−2. (c) The light-response of the charging voltage of a photoassisted chargeable LIB when illumination was switched from “on” to “off”. 

Fig. 4a and b show the charging/discharging curves of the photoassisted chargeable LIB at current rates from 0.02 to 0.04 mA cm−2. It is notable that the degree of polarization does not drastically increase. The photoassisted charging voltage is recorded as 2.88 V, even at a current density of 0.04 mA cm−2. The discharging capacity increased to 137 mA h g−1 after photocharging for 3 h at the current density of 0.04 mA cm−2. In order to evaluate the stability of the photoassisted chargeable LIB, the cycling performances of the photoassisted chargeable LIB after 3 h and 1 h illumination have been studied, respectively. Reversible cycling was observed for 10 cycles without notable changes in the charging voltage (Fig. 4c and d), suggesting the excellent stability of the device. After 10 cycles, the discharge capacity retention of the battery is about 93% for 3 h illumination and 107% for 1 h illumination, respectively. Interestingly, it can be observed that the discharge capacity after 1 h illumination increased during the 10 cycles (Fig. S3†), suggesting a possible activating process in the photocatalyst.31 In addition, the maximum coulombic efficiency of the battery for 3 h and 1 h illumination is 93.3% and 98.9% (Fig. S4†), respectively. It is worth pointing out that the energy conversion efficiency (output electric energy/input electric energy) of the photoassisted chargeable battery after 1 h illumination is 121% (Fig. 4f), significantly higher than that of the LIB (that is, 96.5%), attributed to the reduced voltage during the photocharging process.

Conclusions
We proposed a novel photoassisted chargeable LIB, which enables capturing and storing solar energy in a LIB without using photovoltaic cells. It consists of a LiFePO4 cathode, a lithium anode and a TiO2 photoelectrode coupled with an I− ion redox shuttle. During the photoassisted charging process, the photoexcited electrons of TiO2 transfer to the anode, reducing the Li+ ion to Li metal, and the generated photovoltage is utilized to compensate the required charging voltage. Meanwhile, the I− redox mediator is oxidized to I3− by the photoexcited holes and then, in turn, oxidizes the LiFePO4; in the process, I3− is reduced back to I−. By utilizing solar energy, the photoassisted chargeable LIB can be charged at a voltage of 2.78 V, which is lower than its discharging voltage of 3.41 V. The charging voltage reduction translates to an energy saving of ∼20% compared to conventional LIBs. For the first time, we reduced the charging voltage of the LiFePO4 cathode to 2.78 V by introducing a photoelectrode with a redox shuttle into the LIB. By using appropriate redox shuttles, the concept of “photoassisted charge” could be applied to other electrode materials, such as LiCoO2, LiMnPO4 and LiMn2O4, thus representing an important direction for the future application in solar energy conversion and storage.
