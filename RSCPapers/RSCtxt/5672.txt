    , Accepted 30th September 2016First published on 11th October 2016AbstractIn this contribution, starting from a high mobility polymer P2 with a regioregular D–A–D–A structure, we set out to further optimize the optical bandgap and energy levels for photovoltaic applications. By introducing different donor segments to construct a modified D′–A–D–A backbone, we successfully synthesized three polymers named as PBT, PFT and PPT. Our results demonstrate that the rotation barrier between the D′ and A or D and A significantly increases after using asymmetric A unit PT, compared to either an asymmetric FBT unit or the original BT unit. So, PPT has a more planar backbone conformation, stronger intermolecular contacts and higher degree of structural order than PBT and PFT, and also possesses a deeper HOMO level. When blended with PC61BM, a fullerene acceptor, the PPT-based device showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.3%, which is higher than that of PFT- (6.7%) and PBT-based (6.2%) devices; when blended with ITIC, a non-fullerene acceptor, the PPT-based device showed a PCE of 5.4%, which is also higher than that of the PFT (4.4%) and PBT-based (4.7%) device. Most importantly, we discover that these blends consisting of either PC61BM or ITIC as the electron acceptor exhibit an average transmission of ∼60% over the 400 to 600 nm range and a maximum transmission of ∼70% at ∼500 nm, which provides opportunities and possibilities of achieving high performance, stable and visibly transparent PVs in the future.
1. Introduction
During the past few decades, organic electronic devices using semiconducting conjugated polymers have attracted tremendous scientific and industrial interest. These polymers demonstrate unique advantages such as low cost, light weight and potential applications in flexible and large-area devices, including polymer solar cells (PSCs)1–5 and organic field effect transistors (OFETs).6,7 Synergistic efforts in polymer material design, device processing optimization and morphology improvement have rapidly increased the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs, now approaching 12%.8–12 In addition to the pursuit of high device efficiency, PSCs have also been intensely investigated for their potential in making unique advances for broader applications, for example, visibly transparent photovoltaic devices (PVs) , including building-integrated PVs and integrated PV chargers for portable electronics.13–15 From the PV materials' point of view, an ideal photoactive layer material for visibly transparent PSCs needs to harvest most of the photons from ultraviolet (UV) and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths in the solar spectrum, while the photons in the visible range should be transmitted.16–18
During the pursuit of high-performing organic semiconductors, conjugated polymers with regioregular molecular structures have been attractive due to their ability to achieve a greater degree of inter-chain order, when compared to their less structurally precise counterparts.19 Studies of the widely investigated “classical” regioregular polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) have demonstrated how controlling the orientation of monomers in the backbone translates to desirable modifications in the degree of crystallinity, charge transport, and overall organization in the thin film.20–22 Along this line, recent work on the development of donor (electron rich)–acceptor (electron poor) (D–A) narrow band-gap conjugated polymers has demonstrated cases where controlling the orientation of asymmetric A units brings in improvements in relevant optoelectronic properties.19,23,24 One case in point involves the pyridyl-[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) fragment, see Scheme 1, in the polymer P2,25 which exhibits a similar symmetry to 3-hexylthiophene. Introducing PT in a controlled fashion allows one to achieve exceptional hole mobilities.26
 Scheme 1  The chemical structure of P2 and the designed polymers in this work. 
In this contribution, we describe the synthesis of three new regioregular polymers PBT, PPT and PFT (Scheme 2), which combines two different D fragments (BDT = benzodithiophene and SiIDT = silaindacenodithiophene) with the asymmetric A unit (BT = benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole, FBT = fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole or PT). According to the previous report, the coulombic interactions in S⋯F or S⋯N induce a conformational lock that can further improve the crystalline interchain packing.27 Relative to P2, characterized by a low bandgap and high HOMO energy level, the incorporation of BDT and SiIDT units provide the opportunity to accentuate intermolecular arrangements via a planar molecular structure and avoid unfavorable energy levels due to the electron-rich donor unit cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT).28–30 It is also worth pointing out that this series of polymers will serve as models to understand how subtle changes in the asymmetric A unit impact physicochemical and relevant optoelectronic properties. Relative to P2, these new polymers with the same regiochemically precise set of D′–A–D–A exhibit an increased optical band gap and a lower HOMO level (from −5.10 eV to −5.24 eV). The incorporation of different asymmetric A units evidently impacts the polymer intermolecular contact and further leads to different phase separation morphologies when blending with electron acceptors, as proved by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. After optimization, these donor polymers show an excellent fill factor (best over 70%) and high PCE in PSCs using either PC61BM or non-fullerene ITIC as the electron acceptor. More importantly, we demonstrate that these blends consisting of a regioregular polymer as the donor and either PC61BM or ITIC as the electron acceptor exhibit an average light transmission of ∼60% over the 400 to 650 nm range and a maximum transmission of ∼65% at 550 nm. All these findings provide a new family of conjugated polymers for high performance visibly transparent PV devices.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis
First, as shown in Scheme 2, the X–SiIDT–X (X = BT, FBT and PT) was synthesized through our previous method via the Stille cross-coupling reaction.31 In the case of Br2PT, one finds that the Br adjacent to the pyridyl N is more reactive. As such, one finds opposite regioselectivity between Br2FBT and Br2PT. BT–SiIDT–BT, PT–SiIDT–PT and FBT–SiIDT–FBT were synthesized in yields of 60%, 50% and 70%, respectively. The regioselectivities of PT–SiIDT–PT and FBT–SiIDT–FBT were determined by NMR and 1H–1H NOESY spectroscopy (Fig. S1†), respectively. Finally, PBT, PPT and PFT were obtained by polymerization of 1 with BT–SiIDT–BT, PT–SiIDT–PT and FBT–SiIDT–FBT, respectively, using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 under conventional heating conditions. After stirring at 110 °C for 24 h, the PFT mixture is still very sticky and can be hardly stirred. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and dispersities (Đ) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (PBT: Mn = 29 kDa, Đ = 1.6; PFT: Mn = 36 kDa, Đ = 1.8; PPT: Mn = 32 kDa, Đ = 1.5). PBT shows higher solubility than PPT and PFT in chloroform and chlorobenzene at room temperature.
2.2 Optical properties and energy levels
Optical absorption spectra of PBT, PPT and PFT are shown in Fig. 1a. PFT displays ∼20 nm red-shifted absorption relative to PBT, and PPT displays ∼60 nm red-shifted absorption relative to PFT, indicating the electron-accepting ability of the A unit in the following order: BT < FBT < PT. The optical band gap is closely related to the Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor units.4 In addition, thin film absorption spectra of PBT, PPT and PFT exhibit similar trends to those in solutions. The optical band gap (Eg) of PBT, PPT and PFT is 1.75 eV, 1.65 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively, as determined by the onset of film absorption. To better understand the initial properties of these polymers, mainly the asymmetric A unit effect, we further performed temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption measurements on the three polymers in dilute solutions of chlorobenzene (0.01 mg mL−1). As shown in Fig. S2,† at the elevated temperature (120 °C), all polymers are well dissolved and disaggregated. With gradually decreased temperatures, the polymers start to aggregate and their absorption spectra show red-shifts to different extents. The drastic absorption shifts (∼50 nm) of PPT and PFT indicate strong aggregation of the polymer chains even in solution.32 Conversely, in PBT solution, almost no shift of absorption spectra can be observed, suggesting weak interactions between polymer chains in dilute solution. These observations indicate that the subtle structural change in the asymmetric A unit atom from C–H to N or C–F reduces the solubility of the final polymer structure, most likely as a result of changes in the intermolecular contacts between polymer chains.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements (Fig. 2) were used to estimate highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels by using oxidation onsets. Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were estimated by the addition of Eg to the HOMO energies. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, PPT and PFT show relatively deep HOMO levels of −5.40 eV and −5.42 eV, respectively, owing to the weak acceptor unit of BT. Compared to PT or PFT, PBT shows a HOMO level of −5.20 eV. All the results suggest that the change of asymmetric blocks can impact the HOMO levels. Based on these values, solar cell devices constituting PPT and PFT polymers would be anticipated to provide larger Voc values relative to PBT.

2.3 DFT simulation
To obtain the structural and electronic properties of PBT, PPT and PFT, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the DMol3 (ref. 33 and 34) program. The all-electron generalized gradient approximation functional by B88 exchange and LYP correlation (GGA-BLYP),35 along with a double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set,36,37 was used in calculations on monomers. The solvent effect (chloroform, ε = 4.806) was also taken into consideration to fit the actual conditions. The Dreiding force field was used for the calculations. The geometries of all the polymers are shown in Fig. 3a; according to the simulation results, the incorporation of a different acceptor unit induces great changes in the polymer backbone geometry. We note here that the dihedral angles of D–A and D′–A can be lowered relative to the BT unit (9.3°, −8.3°) when incorporating the asymmetric FBT (4.6°, −5.4°) and PT (1.4°, −0.5°) moieties. To understand how these one-atom substitutions lead to such large deviations in the preferred orientations, we further investigate the torsion potential energy for twisting the acceptor block in the BDT–X(BT, PT and FBT)–SiIDT monomer. As shown in Fig. 3b, we observe that the heteroatom position (PBT vs. PPT) and H–F substitution (PPT vs. PFT) affect the relative energy of the heterocyclic ring. Therefore, due to the different torsion barrier with the SiIDT unit, the BT and FBT-containing systems twist to a greater extent than the PT structure. These results are consistent with the geometries of PBT, PPT and PFT. The differences in the torsion angle play an important role in the intrinsic polymer ionization and optical properties, since it is generally considered that some significant degree of conjugation is maintained with small torsion angles. We also calculated the materials' energy levels to confirm the CV measurement results. As shown in Fig. S3,† the trends observed in the calculated LUMO and HOMO energy levels and band-gaps are consistent with the CV and optical measurements (Fig. 4).

2.4 Polymer structural order and carrier mobilities
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to investigate relevant structural features in a solid film.38 2-dimensional (2-D) scattering images of neat polymer films are shown in Fig. 5a–c. All polymers favor a face-on orientation, with stronger reflection peaks in the out-of-plane direction at q = 1.53 Å−1, q = 1.58 Å−1 and q = 1.55 Å−1 for PBT, PFT and PPT, respectively, which correspond to a “π–π stacking” distance of 4.11 Å, 3.98 Å and 4.05 Å. These distances indicate tighter intermolecular contacts when incorporating asymmetric A of FBT and PT. Crystal correlation lengths (CCLs) were calculated from Gaussian fitting of the “lamellar” and π-stacking diffraction peaks.39 As shown in the figure, the CCLs of π-stacking peaks in the out-of-plane direction were 1.15 nm for neat PBT, 2.01 nm for neat PFT and 3.84 nm for PPT and the CCLs of alkyl-stacking peaks (100) in the out-of-plane direction were 3.5 nm for neat PBT, 4.5 nm for neat PFT and 7.8 nm for PPT, all these results suggesting the higher degree of morphological order in PT-analog polymer films and the effect of the asymmetric unit on improving intermolecular contacts.
 Fig. 5  Transfer characteristics of optimized BGBC OFETs based on PBT, PFT and PPT, respectively. 
OFET devices were employed to further evaluate the charge transport and the asymmetric unit effect. Devices were fabricated with a bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) geometry.40 Thin films were cast by blade-coating from chlorobenzene solutions of PBT, PFT and PPT (5 mg mL−1) onto heavily doped silicon substrates with 300 nm of passivated silicon dioxide. Devices were post-annealed under N2 at 100 °C for 10 min. The optimal output characteristics are shown in Fig. 5, and the best values of hole mobilities, threshold voltages and on/off ratios are summarized in Table 1. The highest hole mobility was calculated to be 0.006 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.008 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.053 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBT, PFT and PPT, respectively. We observe one order of magnitude increase in the hole mobility of PPT compared to that in PBT and PFT. Obviously, polymer PBT with the BT unit exhibits less pronounced intermolecular contacts, which is not desirable for charge transport. In contrast, PPT demonstrates enhanced mobility due to its better structural order in the solid state film. The experimental results clearly show a trend similar to theoretical results and GIWAXS measurements, indicating that the asymmetric unit can effectively tune the co-planarity of the polymer backbone, resulting in more ordered intermolecular packing, which is desirable for efficient charge transport.
2.5 Polymer solar cell performance
The photovoltaic properties of polymers were evaluated in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) configuration by incorporating (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the electron acceptor. All devices were operated under an N2 atmosphere. Previous reports have demonstrated the interfacial issues associated with protonation of PT by PEDOT:PSS;41 therefore, single-junction inverted solar cells with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/MoOx/Ag were adopted for all the polymers. Device optimization included adjustments of solvents, the additive donor–acceptor blend ratio and active layer thickness (see Fig. S4 and S5, Tables S1 and S2†). Chlorobenzene was eventually chosen as the best processing solvent, and the polymer:PC61BM weight ratios were optimized to be 1:2, at a solid total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 for all the polymers.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 6a, with detailed device parameters summarized in Table 2. A maximum PCE of 6.2% was obtained for PBT, PFT shows slightly improved efficiency of 6.9%, and a significant improvement was observed for PPT, with the best PCE of 7.3%. The relatively different PCEs were due to the different Jsc and Voc. PPT and PFT with deeper HOMO levels exhibited higher Voc compared to that of PBT (0.80 V). As shown in Table 2, significant improvements in Jsc were observed upon using lower bandgap polymers PPT and PFT as the donor, giving the highest Jsc of 13.7 mA cm−2, relative to that of 11.1 mA cm−2 in PBT-based devices. The enhancement may be due to the increased carrier mobilities as well as the improved nanoscale morphology of the BHJ blend films.

Quite recently, solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) using a non-fullerene electron acceptor, which possess advantages including tunable chemical and electronic properties as well as enhanced stabilities, have been proven to be a viable alternative to the fullerene system with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) now exceeding 11%.42–45 Therefore, we also fabricated fullerene-free PSCs by employing PBT, PFT and PPT as donors, and a promising non-fullerene molecular acceptor named as ITIC (the chemical structure is shown in Fig. 6b).44 The device structure is the same as that used in the PC61BM-based PSCs, and the best performing PSCs can be fabricated by using CB with 0.5% DIO (v/v) as the processing solvent and a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5. J–V curves of the PSCs based on polymer:ITIC are shown in Fig. 6b, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. All the devices exhibit improved Voc (0.90–0.95 V) compared to that of PC61BM-based devices (0.80–0.85 V); however, both Jsc and FF are unexpectedly decreased, resulting in a lower PCE of 4.9%, 4.4% and 5.4% for PBT, PFT and PPT, respectively. The performance of non-fullerene PSCs in our work is much lower than those of the devices using ITIC as the acceptor and other polymers as the donor in reported studies.44,45 As shown in Fig. S6,† the photoluminescence (PL) of all three donor polymers is effectively quenched by either PC61BM or ITIC, suggesting the efficient energy transfer between the donor and the acceptor. In addition, we also compare the charge transport properties of PPT–PC61BM and PPT–ITIC blends; hole-only and electron-only diodes were fabricated to measure the hole and electron mobilities, respectively (see Fig. S7†).46 As shown in Fig. S7,† the hole and electron mobilities of the optimized PPT–PC61BM blend are 6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively; both hole and electron mobilities are about one order larger than those of the optimal PPT–ITIC blend. The superior electron transport of PCBM can be attributed to its high electron mobility and unique three-dimensional electron transport pathways.1 The lower hole transport in the ITIC-based system may be due to its unfavorable morphology. It should be noted that the absorption of ITIC overlaps with these new donor polymers, which may lead to competitive absorption and inefficient photon harvesting in these non-fullerene blends; further studies on the optimization of the polymer structure and photovoltaic performance are still needed.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the aforementioned devices are shown in Fig. 6c and d. For the devices with either PC61BM or ITIC, the EQE curves are similar in shape, but the PPT-based device shows a broad response and higher EQE than either PBT- or PFT-based devices, which may due to the lower optical bandgap of PPT. The Jsc calculated by integrating the EQE curve with AM 1.5G reference spectra is within a 5% error compared to the corresponding Jsc obtained from the J–V curves. Surprisingly, both polymer–PC61BM and polymer–ITIC devices exhibit relatively low EQE values in the range from 400 nm to 600 nm, with a minimum value appearing around ∼500 nm. According to the absorption spectra of the films (see Fig. S6 in ESI†), all the polymers and ITIC show relatively low absorbance between 400 nm and 600 nm, however, with improved absorption from 600 nm to 800 nm. All these results indicate that this series of polymers potentially could be an ideal photoactive layer material for visibly transparent PSCs, which need to harvest most of the photons from ultraviolet (UV) and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths in the solar spectrum, while the photons in the visible range should be transmitted.
In order to understand the transmittance of these polymer–PC61BM and polymer–ITIC blend films, we further measured the transmission spectra of these blend films with a structure of ITO/ZnO/blend. Since the absorption of PC61BM is located below 400 nm and the absorption of ITIC is mainly located between 600 nm and 800 nm (Fig. S8†), we consider these blends to be promising for semi-transparent applications. With these two materials as acceptors, the photoactive layer has a maximum transmission of ∼70% at ∼500 nm and an average transmission of 60% over the entire visible range (400 to 600 nm), but is strongly absorbing in the NIR range (from 650 to 800 nm), as shown in Fig. 7. This spectral coverage of these blend films, especially for blends containing low bandgap polymer PPT, ensures harvesting of UV and NIR photons while most visible photons are transmitted, making for an excellent candidate for further applications in visibly transparent PSCs. Finally, we evaluated the semi-transparent solar cell performance based on the optimal PPT–PC61BM blend. As shown in Fig. 8, a simple transparent top electrode of MoOx(6 nm)/Ag (20 nm)/MoOx (20 nm) was incorporated to fabricate the semi-transparent solar cells. The optimal J–V curves are shown in Fig. 8; a maximum PCE of 4.1% was obtained for PPT–PC61BM, which exhibits comparable performance relative to the previous reported visibly semi-transparent solar cells.15,17

2.6 Blend morphology
In order to understand the differences in photovoltaic properties between the polymers, as well as the lower efficiency when using ITIC as the electron acceptor, we investigated the morphological properties of the six types of D–A blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as 2D-GIWAXS. The three blend films with PC61BM show very similar surface (Fig. 9a and b and S9†) morphologies; i.e., root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness. From the TEM images (Fig. 9c, S10a and b†), the PFT–PC61BM and PPT–PC61BM blend films show more network-structured films with inter-connected polymer nano-fibers. The phase separation scale can be estimated to be around 20 nm, which is a useful length scale for photovoltaic performance.47,48 In addition to phase separation, the photovoltaic performance of BHJ PSCs also closely correlates with the crystalline structures of the active layer materials, i.e., stronger π–π stacking with more ordered lamellar packing is helpful for facilitating intermolecular charge transport.10,49 As we mentioned, PPT showed a much stronger π–π interaction than the PBT and PFT, which may be another reason for the significantly improved PCE in the polymer–PC61BM device. Therefore, according to the observations in AFM, TEM, and GIWAXS measurements, we can conclude that a well selected asymmetric A unit can produce desirable nanoscale phase separation when blending with PC61BM, and the favorable morphology of the polymer–PC61BM film leads to good photovoltaic performance in solar cell devices.
 Fig. 9  AFM height images, TEM images and 2D-GIWAXS patterns of PPT–PC61BM (a, c and e) and PPT–ITIC (b, d and f) blend films processed under optimal conditions. 
To finalize the characterization, we investigated the morphological differences between PC61BM-based blends and ITIC-based blends. As shown in Fig. 9, when using ITIC as the electron acceptor, discontinuous grains appeared and the RMS value greatly increased to over 5 nm, compared to that of ∼1.0 nm for PC61BM-based blend films. The TEM results properly present the similar nano-scale morphology and exhibit large ITIC clusters in the blends, which is not useful for exciton dissociation and charge transport. In order to confirm the results, we also investigated the PPT–PC61BM and PPT–ITIC blend film morphologies by using 2D-GIWAXS, as shown in Fig. 9e and f. For the PTP–PC61BM blend film, we witness the lamellar peak of the polymer and the amorphous PC61BM diffraction halo at around ∼1.5 Å. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 9f, the PPT–ITIC blend film is dominated by features observed in the neat ITIC film (Fig. S11†). The scattering profiles of the pristine polymer and the non-fullerene acceptor overlap to the extent that it is difficult to characterize the miscibility. Still, by corroborating observations in AFM, TEM, and GIWAXS measurements, we can conclude that these polymers show different miscibilities with ITIC compared to PC61BM, so the polymer–ITIC blend films exhibited distinctly different phase separation morphologies, and the unfavorable morphology of the polymer–ITIC film may result in decreased photovoltaic performance in solar cell devices.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we disclose the synthesis and characterization of three narrow band gap conjugated polymers, PBT, PFT and PPT, which combine two different D fragments (BDT and SiIDT) with the asymmetric A unit (BT, FBT or PT). Regioregularity control over the precise orientation of the FBT or PT fragments relative to the backbone vector was achieved by the chemical selectivity of metal-mediated cross coupling reactions. Compared to the BT-based polymer PBT, the stronger ICT in the FBT and PT-analog polymers resulted in red-shifted absorption spectra, and exhibit lower HOMO energy levels. When compared to PBT, the planarity and intermolecular contacts of PFT and PPT were also notably improved, and PPT demonstrated as high as one order of magnitude enhancement in hole mobility. The incorporation of different asymmetric A units also evidently impacts the phase separation morphology when blending with the electron acceptor, as proved by AFM, TEM and GIWAXS characterization. After optimization, these donor polymers show an excellent FF (best over 70%) and high power conversion efficiency in PSCs using either PC61BM (7.3%) or non-fullerene ITIC (5.4%) as the electron acceptor. More importantly, we discover that these blends consisting of a polymer as the donor and either PC61BM or ITIC as the electron acceptor exhibit an average light transmission of ∼60% over the 400 to 600 nm range and a maximum transmission of ∼70% at ∼500 nm. These findings provide opportunities for furthering the molecular design and highlights possibilities of achieving high performance visibly transparent PVs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials and instruments
All chemicals were purchased from J&K and Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. UV-vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model Lambda 750 instrument. 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed at the Advanced Light Source (ALS)-Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on Beamline 7.3.3 with an X-ray wavelength of 0.123984 nm. The samples were scanned in a He environment at an incident angle of 0.14°. 2D images were analyzed with Nika software available for Igor Pro. Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained with a Veeco Multimode V instrument. TEM images were obtained with a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin Transmission Electron Microscope.
4.2 Fabrication and characterization of polymer field-effect transistors
Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated with a bottom-gate bottom-contact geometry on heavily doped n-type Si substrates with thermally grown 300 nm silicon dioxide. Source/drain contacts (50 nm thick gold with a 5 nm adhesion layer of nickel) were then deposited on top of the SiO2 through photolithography. The substrates were cleaned in acetone and isopropanol and dried in an oven at 100 °C for 30 min before being exposed to UV-ozone for 15 min. The surfaces of the substrates were treated with decyltrichlorosilane (DTS) for 25 min by immersion in 1% (v/v) of DTS in toluene at 80 °C in a N2 glovebox environment. The devices were then cleaned by rinsing with toluene and dried under air flow. The polymers were dissolved in chlorobenzene with a total solid concentration of 5 mg mL−1, and blade coated at 0.1 mm s−1 onto DTS-treated SiO2/Si substrates at a modified rate. The devices were then transferred to another glovebox for testing. The channel length (L) and channel width (W) were 160 mm and 1 mm, respectively. Electrical characterization was performed using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system, and all of the devices were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min.
4.3 Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
Polymer solar cells were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/Active layer/MoOx/Ag. Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, acetone, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol. The organic residue was further removed by treating with UV-ozone for 10 min. A thin film of ZnO (sol–gel method) was spin-coated on ITO substrates and dried at 200 °C for 10 min in ambient atmosphere. A blend of polymer and PC61BM (ratio = 1/2, 20 mg mL−1) or polymer and ITIC (ratio = 1/1.5, 16 mg mL−1) was dissolved in chlorobenzene containing 1.0% (PC61BM) and 0.5% (ITIC) (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane, filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter, and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for the PC61BM-based blend and 2000 rpm for ITIC-based blends. Finally, 6 nm of MoOx (0.2 A s−1) and 80 nm Ag (2A s−1) layers were thermally evaporated on the active layer at a pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask (active area 7.25 mm2). The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity is calibrated by using a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150 V) and verified with a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode.
