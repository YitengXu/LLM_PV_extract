    , Accepted 26th July 2019First published on 29th July 2019AbstractThe employment of up-conversion materials in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) provides an intriguing strategy to extend the spectral absorption from the visible to the near infrared (NIR) regions and thus improves device performance. Here, we synthesized an effective up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP) material, namely NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+, which transformed NIR photons to visible and even to UV emissions. For the first time, the UCNPs were incorporated into PSCs by adopting a double-layer structure that consisted of a bottom layer and a top layer of UCNPs, which were located next to the front (FTO) and rear (Au) electrodes, respectively. Importantly, the UCNP-incorporated PSCs achieved a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with a higher long-term device stability, in comparison with a PCE of 15.8% from the UCNP-free PSCs. Besides the contribution of additional photocurrent generation via NIR photon up-conversion of the UCNPs, atomic force microscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra measurements revealed that the top and bottom layers of UCNPs also played important roles in the film morphology and charge dynamic behaviors respectively, and all of these features led to performance enhancement.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received huge attention as the most competitive candidate in the photovoltaic field, and achieved unprecedented advances in power conversion efficiency (PCE) rising from 3% to over 23%.1–5 As is well known, the standard spectrum of AM 1.5G sunlight ranges from 280 nm to 2500 nm. However, the perovskite materials generally absorb only incident light in the UV and visible range (280–800 nm), which occupies only ∼54% of the solar spectrum.6 In this regard, there is large room to further improve the PSC efficiency via achieving efficient utilization of the remaining ∼46% of the sunlight in the near-infrared (NIR) region. A common approach to harvest the NIR light is bandgap tuning of the perovskite to extend the absorption, for instance, when a methylammonium cation (MA+) in MAPbI3 was replaced by a formamidinium cation (FA+) to obtain a narrow bandgap, the optical absorption could be broadened up to 850 nm.7 However, there is still a large part of NIR light in the sunlight spectrum which has not been utilized and causes considerable loss of solar energy. Therefore, it remains an important issue to efficiently harvest the NIR light for performance improvement of PSCs. It is well known that the lanthanide (Ln)-doped up-conversion nanophosphor (UCNPs) materials are a kind of intriguing luminescent material, and the up-conversion processes have been extensively studied in Ln ion (Ln3+)-doped fluorides due to a high up-conversion luminescence efficiency.8,9 The Ln ions (Ln3+) possess several electronic states at various energy levels, and can absorb low-energy NIR photons and subsequently convert them into visible high-energy light, which can be absorbed by the perovskite materials to generate additional photocurrent. In this light, the UCNPs could provide a promising energy transducer to address the NIR light harvesting issue in PSCs.10,11 In fact, Ln3+-doped UCNP materials have been employed in PSCs for performance improvement,6,12–14 which are mostly restricted to sodium yttrium fluoride co-doped with ytterbium/erbium (NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+), where the Yb3+ was used as a sensitizer and Er3+ was an activator. For instance, the incorporation of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs into PSCs effectively brought about a PCE increasement from 14.1% (UCNPs-free PSC) to 16.0%.15 Despite that, the performance improvement was limited because the up-conversion emissions of Er3+ doped UCNPs are mainly in the green light region,9 while the device performance could be further improved by extending the upconverted emissions to the UV, visible, and NIR regions, which are easily available for Tm3+ doped UCNPs.16–18
In this work, we provide a simple approach to synthesize Yb3+ and Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 UCNPs, namely NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+, which exhibits intense up-conversion emissions in the blue and even UV regions. Importantly, high-efficiency PSCs enabled by a synergetic device architecture were implemented through employment of double layers (a bottom layer and a top layer) of the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ UCNPs, while PSCs with a single layer of UCNPs were also fabricated for further investigation. It was found that the embedded double layers of the UCNPs convert NIR photons into high-energy photons that are absorbed by the perovskite materials, while the bottom and top layers of the UCNPs have different effects on film morphology and charge dynamic features, which are responsible for the performance enhancement in the UCNP-based PSCs.
Experimental
Synthesis of NaYF4:18%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+
Oleic acid (OA)-capped beta-phase NaYF4:18%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ (β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+) nanoparticles were synthesized via a solvothermal route adapted from the literature.19 Briefly, 1 mmol of RECl3·6H2O (RE = 81.5 mol% Y, 18 mol% Yb, and 0.5 mol% Tm) was dissolved in a mixture of 15 mL octadecylene and 6 mL OA. The mixture was heated at 160 °C for 30 min to remove water from the solution under argon protection, and then cooled down to room temperature. Afterwards, a solution of NH4F (4 mmol) and NaOH (2.5 mmol) dissolved in methanol (10 mL) was added to the flask and the solution was stirred for 60 min. The temperature was then increased to 60 °C for 30 min. After methanol was evaporated from the reaction mixture, the solution was heated at 300 °C in an argon atmosphere for 60 min and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The products were precipitated by the addition of ethanol and collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, and then washed with ethanol three times, and finally re-dispersed in hexane for further use.

Lead(II) iodide, dimethyl sulfoxide, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and titanium isopropoxide were purchased from Aldrich. Methylammonium bromide (MABr), formamidinium iodide (FAI), PbI2, PbBr2 and CsI as well as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) were obtained from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Co. Ltd, and the synthesis of mixed-cation perovskite Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 is given in the ESI.† All solvents and reagents were commercially available in pure form and used without further purification. Acetylacetonate, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethanol and chlorobenzene were received from Sinopharm. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3900 UV-vis spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a RF-5301PC fluorescence spectrophotometer. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectra of the UCNPs and cross-sectional device configuration were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI, Quanta450 FEG), X-rays diffraction (XRD) was measured by using a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements were conducted by using an FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit microscope. The film roughness was characterized by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Bruker Multimode 8 SPM system). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were examined by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer RF-5301PC under the excitation of a 470 nm pulsed laser.
Results and discussion
Characterization of UCNPs
The TEM image in Fig. 1a shows that the synthesized β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ UCNPs have excellent dispersibility with an average diameter of approximately 30 nm, which can be supported by the size distribution histogram (Fig. 1b) showing that the particle diameter ranges from 28 to 32 nm with an average diameter of 30 nm. The atomic compositions of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ UCNPs are further confirmed by using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Fig. S1a, ESI†), while the EDX analysis (Fig. S1b–f, ESI†) confirms the presence of the host components (Na, Y, and F) and the dopant components (Yb, Tm), and that all these elements are uniformly distributed throughout the nanoparticles. An additional HRTEM image of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ UCNPs as shown in Fig. 1c reveals a highly crystalline nature and structural uniformity, and the interplanar distances between the adjacent lattice fringes are ∼0.261 nm, which match that of the (200) lattice planes of β-NaYF4. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern of the UCNPs (Fig. 1d) shows the formation of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ UCNPs (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, JCPDS 28-1192), indicating the highly crystalline UCNPs. In Fig. 1e, it is found that the up-conversion luminescence spectrum of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ UCNPs spanning from UV to visible regions is observed at 980 nm laser excitation using the same conditions (the emission slit was 0.5 nm, the voltage of the photomultiplier tube was set at 400 V, and the excitation power density was set at about 100 W cm−2) at room temperature, and intensely sharp emission peaks corresponding to ∼290, ∼345, ∼362, ∼451 and ∼475 nm are attributed to the 1I6 → 3H6, 1I6 → 3F4, 1D2 → 3H6, 1D2 → 3F4 and 1G4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+, respectively.20 The simple up-conversion mechanism is shown in Fig. 1f. The Yb ions acting as an efficient sensitizer absorb 980 nm light and then transfer this energy to neighboring Tm ions, and finally the excitation of the Tm ions induces high-energy UV and blue light emission peaks that are in the absorption range of the perovskite materials (280–800 nm). Therefore, the employment of the UCNPs can extend the spectral absorption of perovskite materials from the visible region to the NIR region, thus benefiting the performance improvement of the PSCs.

Photovoltaic performance of double-UC PSCs
Given the efficient harvesting of NIR light by UCNPs, we conceived an idea that there is a high possibility to enhance the performance of PSCs by introducing two layers of UCNPs into one device. As a proof of concept, PSCs with double layers of UCNPs were implemented and the device configuration was given as: FTO/c-TiO2/UCNPs/perovskite/UCNPs/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, denoted as double-UC PSC. The detailed fabrication process is shown in the ESI† and Fig. S2. Here, with regard to the position of the electrodes, the UCNP layers deposited next to the FTO cathode and the Au anode were remarked as the bottom UCNP layer (B-UC layer) and the top UCNP layer (T-UC layer) respectively. The device structure can be well confirmed from the cross-section SEM image as seen in Fig. 2a, wherein the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanoparticles are clearly observed at both the B-UC and T-UC layers. Firstly, it was considered that the concentrations of the UCNPs had an effect on device performance. Thereby, performance optimization was done by adjusting the concentrations of the UCNPs (Fig. S3, ESI†), and the optimized concentrations of the UCNPs were found to be 10 mg mL−1 for the B-UC layer and 3 mg mL−1 for the T-UC layer. Meanwhile, UCNP-free control PSCs with a device structure of FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, which was similar to that of the double-UC PSCs except for the absence of double UCNP layers, were also fabricated for comparison.

Fig. 2b displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs, which are measured under one sun illumination at AM 1.5G. It is seen that the control cell shows a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.46 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 65.2%, resulting in a PCE of 15.8%. On the other hand, the Jsc of the double-UC PSC is highly raised to be 25.46 mA cm−2, and the FF is increased to be 67.5%, while the Voc is 1.06 V (Table 1). As a result, the PCE of the double-UC PSC reaches up to 18.2%, and the statistical histogram of the PCEs from 30 cells is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Therefore, the photocurrent of the double-UC PSC is enlarged by 8.5% and the PCE is augmented by 15.2% when compared to that of the control PSC. It is worth noting that the double-UC PSC in this work presents an outstanding performance amongst the reported PSCs based on UC nanophosphors (Table S1, ESI†),6,12,13,15,21 most of which are Er3+-doped nanomaterials. The introduced UCNPs converting NIR photons to visible ones is mainly responsible for the increased Jsc by reducing non-absorption loss of solar light, which can be evidenced from the absorption spectra of perovskite films coated with or without UCNPs. As seen in Fig. 2c, in comparison to the pristine perovskite film, the UCNPs/perovskite/UCNPs (double UCNPs) film exhibits an obvious absorption enhancement in the UV-visible region (300–500 nm) as well as in the NIR region (800–1100 nm), due to the up-conversion effect of the UCNPs. On the other hand, it is reported that the UCNPs not only play an important role in the up-conversion effect, but also contribute to the light scattering effect,22 which can elongate the propagation path of light and thus improve the light absorption of perovskite materials. In addition, as for the light that has gone through the perovskite layer and entered into the top UCNP layer, part of the light can be reflected back to the perovskite layer due to the light scattering effect of the UCNPs and then re-absorbed by the perovskite material, consequently promoting the photoelectric response and leading to increased photocurrent. Moreover, the double-UC PSC presents lower dark currents than the control PSC (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating improved charge transport and decreased recombination loss in the UC devices.23Fig. 2d displays the IPCE behaviors of the PSCs. In the 300–500 nm region, the double-UC PSC presents higher IPCE than that of the control PSC, which is in agreement with the increased absorption in the UV-visible region of the UCNPs/perovskite/UCNPs film as seen in Fig. 2c. Meanwhile, no obvious enhancement in the NIR region is observed. The reason is probably due to the light in the 850–1050 nm region occupying only 9.1% of the solar spectrum, which means that the power density of the 850–1050 nm NIR light is only 9.1 W cm−2 with respect to that of the simulated AM1.5 standard sunlight (100 W cm−2), and thereby the unconverted fluorescence induced by the UCNPs is weak.

Long-term stability of the PSCs
At present, device stability is still a great issue for PSCs and high stability is critical for its commercial applications. Then, the long-term stability of the unencapsulated control and double-UC PSCs was investigated and compared under an open environment with a relative humidity of 20–25% at a temperature of 25 °C. As seen in Fig. 3, the photovoltaic parameters were normalized to the initial values. As for the PCE behaviors (Fig. 3a), the PCEs of both the control and double-UC PSCs show fluctuations during an 846 h period. In spite of that, the PCE of the control PSC decreases and retains 80% of its initial PCE after 846 h. Surprisingly, the double-UC PSC demonstrates a 2.5-fold increase in PCE after the same period. These results suggest that the double-UC PSC exhibits higher long-term stability than the control PSC. In detail, the FF of the control PSC shows a similar decreasing tendency and the FF of the double-UC PSC displays a similar increasing tendency as that of their PCEs (Fig. 3b). With regard to the double-UC PSC, the reason for the increased FF is likely due to the decreased interfacial resistances between the perovskite layer and the UCNP layers.24 Meanwhile, the Voc behaviors of both the control and double-UC PSCs are also in agreement with their PCE features (Fig. 3c), while the Jsc of both PSCs tends to slightly decline with increasing time (Fig. 3d).

Device performance of single-UC PSCs
To investigate the reasons for improved device performance of double-UC PSCs, firstly, perovskite solar cells with a single bottom layer or a single top layer of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ UCNPs were fabricated to study the role of the two UCNP layers on device performance. The device configurations are shown in Fig. 4a and b: FTO/c-TiO2/UCNPs/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (B-UC PSC), and FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/UCNPs/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (T-UC PSC). It is expected that the device performances of B-UC and T-UC PSCs are associated with the concentrations of the UCNPs. Therefore, B-UC and T-UC PSCs with different concentrations of UCNPs were investigated and the results are displayed in Fig. S6 (ESI†), which confirmed that the concentration of the UCNPs played an important role in the device performance. Here, the concentrations of UCNPs in B-UC and T-UC PSCs are chosen to be 10 and 3 mg mL−1, respectively, which enable good device performance and importantly are consistent with the concentrations of the B-UC and T-UC layers adopted in the double-UC PSC. Fig. 4c shows the J–V curves of the T-UC, B-UC and control PSCs, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. In comparison to the control PSCs, on one hand, when a top layer of UCNPs is introduced into the PSCs, the PCE of the resulting T-UC PSC is enhanced to 17.1% and the Jsc is increased to be 24.03 mA cm−2. On the other hand, when a bottom layer of UCNPs is introduced, the resulting B-UC PSC presents a higher PCE of 17.2% with a higher Jsc of 25.42 mA cm−2. The reason for the increased Jsc in the B-UC and T-UC PSCs is attributed to the up-conversion effect of the UCNPs, which can be further proved from the UV absorption spectra. As plotted in Fig. 4d, the two samples including UCNPs/perovskite (perovskite deposited atop UCNPs) and perovskite/UCNPs (UCNPs deposited atop perovskite) films show stronger absorption in the NIR as well as the UV-blue regions than the pristine perovskite film. These results certify the effectiveness of using UCNPs for performance improvement of PSCs.

(d) UV-vis absorption spectra of perovskite, UCNPs/perovskite and perovskite/UCNPs films. AFM images of (e) TiO2/UCNPs (inset: TiO2 film) and (f) perovskite/UCNPs (inset: perovskite film). 
With regard to the FF behavior, it is found that the T-UC PSC presents a higher FF (69.0%) while the B-UC PSC exhibits a lower FF (62.7%) in comparison to the control PSC (65.2%), which is mostly related to the fact that the employed UCNPs also have an influence on the surface morphology of the films. As a proof of concept, the AFM measurements were performed for TiO2 film, TiO2/UCNPs films, perovskite film, and perovskite/UCNP films. As seen in Fig. 4e, the TiO2 film has a relatively smooth surface with a root mean square (RMS) of 2.2 nm, which becomes 4.9 nm when the UCNPs were coated on the surface of the TiO2 layer. The increased roughness brings about increased number of holes that tend to decrease the FF behavior of the PSC, which is in good agreement with the J–V results showing a lower FF in the B-UC PSC than that in the control PSC. On the other hand, Fig. 4f shows that the perovskite film has a RMS of 14.7 nm, which is decreased to be 11.2 nm for the perovskite/UCNP film, where the UCNPs were deposited on the as-prepared perovskite film. As supported by the AFM results, the reason for the improved morphology of the perovskite film through incorporation of the UCNPs is due to the UCNPs being well dispersed in the perovskite film and providing continuous and uniform surface coverage, resulting in good interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and the HTL layer. The uniform surface morphology of the perovskite/UCNP films not only enables fast dissociation of photogenerated electrons and promotes efficient electron transport,12,25 but also benefits subsequent deposition of the HTM layer, and all of these contribute to the higher FF in the T-UC PSCs.
The role of the UCNPs
To specifically evaluate the contribution of the UCNPs in device performance, an effective approach is to investigate the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs under only NIR laser irradiation by excluding the impact caused by the light in the other spectral regions.6 Then, the performance of the control, T-UC, B-UC and double-UC PSCs was measured under 980 nm NIR laser irradiation with a power density of 3 W cm−2. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5a and the results are summarized in Table 2. It is found that the control PSC hardly responds to the NIR irradiation, leading to a Jsc of 0.041 mA cm−2. When the NIR irradiation is applied to the T-UC and B-UC PSCs, the Jsc is obviously increased to be 0.174 and 0.102 mA cm−2 respectively. Overall, the control PSC obtains a PCE of 0.008%, while the T-UC and B-UC PSCs achieve PCE of 0.066% and 0.030% respectively, showing a 7-fold and an almost 4-fold efficiency enhancement in comparison to the control PSC. It is also worth noting that the B-UC PSC possesses a higher Voc than the T-UC PSC while the T-UC PSC exhibits a higher Jsc than the B-UC PSC. These results indicate that the embedded bottom layer of UCNPs plays a significant role in improved electron transfer, while the top layer of the UCNPs makes more contribution to efficient utilization of the NIR light, which is in agreement with the previous report that the up-conversion layer can efficiently capture sub-bandgap light when it is located on the rear reflector of solar cells (which is the Au anode in our PSCs). More importantly, when the T-UC and B-UC layers are combined into one device, it is found that the double-UC PSC responds to the NIR irradiation more efficiently. The Jsc of the double-UC PSC is further increased to be 0.529 mA cm−2 and the PCE is greatly enhanced up to 0.21%, indicating a 25-fold enhancement in PCE with respect to that of the control PSC. The results suggest that the UCNP-based PSCs, especially the double-UC PSC can make more efficient utilization of 980 nm NIR light in contrast to the UCNP-free control PSC, as the UCNPs can upconvert the NIR photons into visible ones which the perovskite materials can harvest and thus reduce photon loss of the solar energy. Further evidence for efficient utilization of the NIR light is demonstrated from the J–V curves of a double-UC PSC measured under AM 1.5G standard sunlight with or without 980 nm NIR laser irradiation (Fig. 5b). The inset table in Fig. 5b shows that, a Jsc of 25.15 mA cm−2 measured under only AM 1.5G standard sunlight is increased to 25.56 mA cm−2 when simultaneously measured under both 980 nm NIR laser irradiation and AM 1.5G sunlight, suggesting generation of additional photocurrent induced by the 980 nm NIR laser irradiation, which is due to the up-conversion effect of the employed UCNPs. Consequently, the PCE is improved from 17.7% measured under only AM 1.5G sunlight to 18.1% measured under both 980 nm NIR laser irradiation and AM 1.5G sunlight.

To further investigate the effect of the UCNPs on charge dynamics, TRPL measurements were conducted for four samples including perovskite film (control sample), UCNPs/perovskite films (B-UC sample), perovskite/UCNPs films (T-UC sample), and UCNPs/perovskite/UCNPs films (double-UC sample). As shown in Fig. 6, the PL decay curves were fitted by using a biexponential decay model and lead to two time constants, τ1 and τ2 which represent fast and slow decay times respectively. In comparison to the control sample (τ1 = 3.35 ns), the fast decay time is shortened in the B-UC sample (τ1 = 0.32 ns) but elongated in the T-UC sample (τ1 = 5.16 ns) and double-UC sample (τ1 = 5.66 ns), which indicates that the charge transfer from the perovskite to the B-UC layer is more efficient than from the perovskite to the T-UC layer,26 thus giving a higher Voc in the B-UC PSC, and this result is in agreement with the photovoltaic performance. On the other hand, the slow decay times of B-UC (τ2 = 181.1 ns), T-UC (τ2 = 125.2 ns) and double-UC (τ2 = 193.1 ns) samples are all longer than that of the control sample (τ2 = 102.9 ns), indicating reduced trap-assisted charge recombination near the perovskite and UCNP interfaces.27 Therefore, the results suggest that the incorporation of UCNPs into PSCs is beneficial for improving device performance, and employing double layers of UCNPs is more efficient to enable high photovoltaic performance than utilizing a single layer of UCNPs.

Conclusions
In summary, β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ up-conversion material was synthesized and successfully incorporated into PSCs. A new device design strategy by adopting double layers of UCNPs, which consisted of a top layer and a bottom layer of UCNPs with regard to the position of the electrodes, was proposed for device fabrication. As a result, the UCNP-based PSCs achieved a high PCE of 18.2% showing an increase of 15.2% when compared to the UCNP-free control PSCs, as well as more excellent long-term stability. Detailed results showed that the top layer and the bottom layer of UCNPs mainly contributed to smooth film morphology and enhanced electron transfer behaviors respectively, leading to improved FF and Voc, while the up-conversion effect of the UCNPs was responsible for increased Jsc of PSCs. Therefore, this work provides a feasible approach for performance enhancement of PSCs through employment of up-conversion materials to extend the spectral absorption from the visible to the near infrared ranges, from the perspectives of material and device structure design.
