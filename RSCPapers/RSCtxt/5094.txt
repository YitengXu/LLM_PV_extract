    , Accepted 21st March 2017First published on 24th March 2017AbstractGraphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as an emerging two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial has been commonly used as a metal-free photocatalyst with potential applications in visible light photocatalytic water-splitting. However, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is quite low due to its relatively large band gap and the existence of contact resistance between the nanosheets. Herein we report for the first time the facile synthesis of a covalently bonded g-C3N4/C60 hybrid via a solid-state mechanochemical route and its application in photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light. The g-C3N4/C60 hybrid was synthesized by ball-milling g-C3N4 and C60 in the presence of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as a catalyst. The hybrid nature and conformation of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid were confirmed by a series of spectroscopic and morphological studies, featuring the covalent bonding of C60 onto the edges of g-C3N4 nanosheets via a four-membered ring of azetidine, which has never been reported in fullerene chemistry. The g-C3N4/C60 hybrid was further applied to metal-free visible light photocatalytic hydrogen production, affording a H2 production rate of 266 μmol h−1 g−1 without using any noble metal cocatalyst such as Pt, which is about 4.0 times higher than that obtained for the pristine g-C3N4 photocatalyst.
Introduction
Among the known allotropes of carbon nitrides, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), as an emerging class of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials analogous to graphite, is most stable under ambient conditions.1–6 g-C3N4 has a unique structure comprised of a 2D sheet of tri-s-triazine connected via tertiary amines and shows excellent chemical and thermal stability with polymeric nature, rendering facile structure and property modifications and potential applications in energy storage, catalysis, photocatalysis etc.4–13 In particular, g-C3N4 has been extensively used as a metal-free semiconductor photocatalyst since the first report on the g-C3N4 photocatalyst for water splitting under visible light irradiation by Wang et al. in 2009,14 and demonstrates the advantages of a low cost and a high specific surface area (2500 m2 g−1 for monolayer).4–10 However, the relatively large band gap (ca. 2.7 eV) of g-C3N4 and the existence of contact resistance between the nanosheets result in its poor electrical conductivity and low photocatalytic activity due to the rapid recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs.14–16 In order to improve the photocatalytic activity and to extend further the applications of g-C3N4, recently some g-C3N4-based nanocomposites have been constructed on the basis of the flexibility of its chemical structure arising from its polymeric nature.8–10,15–21 So far the functional materials used to construct g-C3N4-based nanocomposites mainly include carbon materials, metal oxides/sulfides/halides, noble metals etc.8,9,15–21 It is noteworthy that despite the photocatalytic activity enhancements, most of these g-C3N4-based nanocomposites are based on heterojunction structures for which g-C3N4 and other functional materials are typically blended physically instead of covalently bonded; thus the intermolecular interactions between g-C3N4 and other functional materials are relatively weak.8–10 Hence, it is highly desirable to construct covalently bonded g-C3N4-based hybrids so as to strengthen the intermolecular interactions between g-C3N4 and functional materials toward photocatalytic activity enhancement to a larger extent.
Fullerene has a closed-cage structure with no edges and shows a strong electron-accepting ability, and therefore has promising applications in energy conversion, especially organic/perovskite solar cells, biomedicines and so on.22–25 Unlike 2D graphenes analogous to g-C3N4, the divergence in dimension between zero-dimensional (0D) fullerene and 2D g-C3N4 makes their hybridization much more difficult. As a result, composites based on g-C3N4 and fullerene have rarely been reported up to now. Chai et al. prepared a C60 modified g-C3N4 composite by simply blending g-C3N4 powder into a C60 solution in toluene, which showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) owing to the more efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.26 Later on, another C60/g-C3N4 composite was prepared by Zhu et al. via a thermal treatment of dicyandiamide, a precursor for synthesis of g-C3N4, in the presence of C60, and the photocatalytic activity of the C60/g-C3N4 composite for the degradation of phenol and methylene blue under visible light was found to be around 3 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 due to the high photogenerated electron transfer rate and charge separation efficiency of C60 within the C60/g-C3N4 composite.27 More recently, fullerene C60 (or C70)/C3N4 composites were prepared by Ouyang et al. via a hydrothermal process, showing stronger bacterial inactivation than the pristine C3N4.28 Note that in these reports C60 was blended physically into the pristine g-C3N4 or its precursor with quite a low blending ratio (<2.0 wt%) and there were a large number of unreacted C60 in the composites; besides, the photocatalytic activity of the C60/g-C3N4 composite was examined only via degradation of dyes. To our knowledge, so far there has been no report on the covalent bonded g-C3N4/C60 hybrid, and the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid for hydrogen (H2) production under visible light has never been studied, which is of great importance for the current worldwide energy issues.
Herein, we report the first covalently bonded g-C3N4 and C60 hybrid synthesized via a facile solid-state mechanochemical route by ball-milling g-C3N4 and C60 in the presence of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as a catalyst. Based on a series of spectroscopic and morphological studies, the conformation and microstructure of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid is proposed. The g-C3N4/C60 hybrid is further applied to visible light photocatalytic H2 production, showing enhanced photocatalytic activity relative to the pristine g-C3N4 photocatalyst.
Results and discussion
Recently, the solid-state mechanochemical method via ball milling has been extensively applied to functionalize graphene which has a 2D layered structure analogous to g-C3N4, and versatile edge-selectively functionalized graphenes attaching different elements, small inorganic molecules or fullerene C60 have been synthesized.29–32 Stimulated by its simplicity and environment-friendliness (without using any organic solvent), we managed to synthesize the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid by this method. However, our initial attempt to synthesize the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid by ball-milling a mixture of bulk g-C3N4 (synthesized by the standard pyrolysis method using dicyandiamide as the precursor33) and C60 powders afforded no hybrid formation as evidenced by Raman spectroscopic, XRD and TGA studies, suggesting the high energy barrier of the hybridization reaction. This is similar to the case of a directly bonded hybrid of graphene and C60 which we reported very recently.32 We then introduced anhydrous LiOH powder, which can serve as a catalyst to activate C60,32 into the mixture of bulk g-C3N4 and C60 powders prior to ball-milling (see Scheme 1). After ball-milling at 500 rpm for 24 hours, the resultant black mixture was washed with deionized water to remove the excess LiOH and was then Soxhlet extracted with CS2 to remove the unreacted C60 completely.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the mechanochemical reaction between g-C3N4 and C60 in the presence of the LiOH catalyst in a sealed ball-mill crusher. 
A series of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids were prepared by ball-milling mixtures of bulk g-C3N4 and C60 powders with different weight ratios of C60:g-C3N4 (20 mg:500 mg = 4 wt%, 60 mg:500 mg = 12 wt%, 100 mg:500 mg = 20 wt%, denoted as g-C3N4/C60-4 wt%, g-C3N4/C60-12 wt%, g-C3N4/C60-20 wt%, respectively). The FTIR spectra of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids are shown in Fig. 1, which also includes those of the pristine g-C3N4, pure g-C3N4 after ball-milling (BM-g-C3N4) and pristine C60 for comparison. In the FTIR spectrum of pristine g-C3N4 (curve a), the characteristic vibrational band at 808 cm−1 is ascribed to the breathing mode of the s-triazine moiety, and the vibrational bands at 1241, 1320, 1409 and 1458 cm−1 correspond to the C–N stretching modes, while that at 1640 cm−1 is assigned to the CN stretching mode within the CN heterocycles. The additional broadband centered at around 3165 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching modes of the terminal N–H groups.34,35 All these vibrational bands are observed in the FTIR spectra of BM-g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/C60 hybrids but with obvious shifts. For instance, for BM-g-C3N4 (curve b), although the vibrational band of the s-triazine moiety at 808 cm−1 of pristine g-C3N4 remains unchanged, the vibrational bands of CN heterocycles shift to 1261, 1327, 1417, 1490 and 1627 cm−1. This is presumably due to the breach of the 2D structure of g-C3N4via mechanochemical cleavage of the C–N bonds involved in the tertiary amine (N–(C)3) connecting the tri-s-triazine unit during the ball-milling process. In the FTIR spectra of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids (curves c–e), similar shifts of the vibrational bands of CN heterocycles are observed (e.g., 1290, 1334, 1420, 1491 and 1621 cm−1 for g-C3N4/C60-12 wt%, curve d), suggesting a similar structural change of g-C3N4 during the ball-milling process. In particular, the vibrational bands of the s-triazine moiety of g-C3N4 and BM-g-C3N4 (808 cm−1) shift to 800 cm−1, suggesting the perturbation of the s-triazine structure by C60. It is noteworthy that a new vibrational peak at 525 cm−1 appears in the spectra of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids, which is clearly found to be the most intense vibrational peak of pristine C60 (curve f). This result suggests the existence of the C60 moiety in the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid. Besides, another new vibrational peak at 548 cm−1 is also detected in the spectra of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids, which is absent in those of pure g-C3N4 (pristine and ball-milled) and C60, suggesting the formation of the new vibrational mode upon C60 attachment as discussed further below.

Because of the sensitivity to the electronic structure of nanocarbons, Raman spectroscopy has been commonly used for the characterization of nanocarbons including graphenes and fullerenes.32,36 Raman spectra of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids, pristine g-C3N4 and C60 measured with a 532 nm laser are compared in Fig. 2. While C60 exhibits several peaks at 1424, 1469 and 1566 cm−1 corresponding to Hg(7), Ag(2) and Hg(8) modes (curve a), respectively,37 pristine g-C3N4 shows no detectable Raman signals due to the strong fluorescence effect (curve b), while two peaks at 707 and 1234 cm−1 were detected upon removal of the fluorescence effect by using a 785 nm excitation laser (see ESI Fig. S1†).27 In the Raman spectra of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids (curves c–e), an intense signal at 1461, 1461 and 1465 cm−1 is observed for g-C3N4/C60-4 wt%, g-C3N4/C60-12 wt%, and g-C3N4/C60-20 wt%, respectively, and two weaker signals at 1424 and 1566 cm−1 are also detected despite the fluorescence effect. Interestingly, all of these signals have counterparts in that of pristine C60 despite slight shifts, which are however absent in that of a mixture of pristine g-C3N4 and C60 powders ball-milled without LiOH catalyst (see ESI Fig. S1†), confirming that the C60 moiety does exist in the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid and its attachment can be accomplished only in the presence of LiOH catalyst during ball-milling. Furthermore, as reported for C60-based composites including the graphene-C60 hybrid,32 the intense Ag(2) mode (1469 cm−1) of pristine C60 as the most sensitive vibrational mode to the charge state of C60 is found to down-shift by up to 8 cm−1 for g-C3N4/C60-4 wt% and g-C3N4/C60-12 wt%, suggesting that charge transfer from g-C3N4 to C60 may take place as a result of the well-known strong electron-accepting ability of C60.11,32,38 This is quite different from the case of a C60/g-C3N4 composite reported in ref. 27, for which the Raman signals of C60 including the intense Ag(2) mode (1469 cm−1) were not found at all due likely to the physically blended nature and much lower C60 content in the composite.27 These results confirm the successful covalent attachment of the C60 moiety onto the g-C3N4 matrix.

The chemical composition of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 3a shows the XPS survey spectra of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids, pristine g-C3N4 and C60, and their high-resolution C 1s XPS spectra are compared in Fig. 3b–d (see also ESI Fig. S2†). The C 1s peak of pristine g-C3N4 can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 284.8 and 288.2 eV, corresponding to C–C and CN–C bonds, respectively, and the latter is dominating (Fig. 3b).34,39 For the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid (Fig. 3c), two un-shifted peaks at 284.8 and 288.2 eV along with a new peak at 286.4 eV can be obtained in its high-resolution C 1s XPS spectrum instead, which are assigned to C–C, C–O and CN–C bonds, respectively. Apparently, the intensity of C–C bonds at 284.8 eV becomes comparable to that of CN–C bonds. Since the C–C signal at 284.6 eV is dominating in the high-resolution C 1s XPS spectrum of pristine C60 (Fig. 3d), the dramatic intensity increase of C–C signal at 284.8 eV for the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid can be rationally attributed to the involvement of the C60 moiety. The new signal at 286.4 eV should originate from the formation of a new type of bonding during ball-milling (the assignment of the satellite signal of C60 can be excluded due to the much lower relative intensity), and may be tentatively assigned to C–O bonds.40 On the other hand, according to the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectrum, the relative intensity of the C–OH (531.5 eV) signal within the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid increases dramatically relative to that for pristine g-C3N4 (see ESI Fig. S4†), suggesting the involvement of C–OH groups in the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid. This supposition is confirmed by comparing the FTIR spectra of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids and pristine g-C3N4 in more detail, indicating that a new peak at 3334–3356 cm−1 appears in the spectra of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids, which can be assigned to the hydroxyl (–OH) group (see Fig. 1).29,32

The influence of the C60 moiety on the structure of g-C3N4 can be further deduced by high-resolution N 1s XPS spectroscopic analysis. The N 1s peak of the pristine g-C3N4 can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 398.7, 400.0 and 401.1 eV, corresponding to CN–C, N–(C)3 and NHx, respectively (see Fig. 3e).34,39 For the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid, except for the N 1s peaks at 398.7, 400.0 and 401.1 eV corresponding to CN–C, N–(C)3 and NHx, respectively, of g-C3N4, a new peak at 399.5 eV is detected (see Fig. 3f and ESI Fig. S3† for the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectra of g-C3N4/C60-4 wt% and g-C3N4/C60-20 wt% hybrids), which may be ascribed to the N–C60 bonds which connect g-C3N4 and C60. However, such a peak is not detected in that of the mixture of bulk g-C3N4 and C60 powders ball-milled without LiOH catalyst (see ESI Fig. S5†). These results reveal the covalent attachment of C60via N–C60 bonds as discussed below.

Fig. 4 compares the XRD diffraction patterns of g-C3N4/C60 hybrids, pristine g-C3N4 and C60 powder. The XRD pattern of pristine g-C3N4 exhibits two diffraction peaks at 13.0° and 27.7° (curve a), which are attributed to the characteristic (100) and (002) planes of g-C3N4, respectively.26,27,41 In the XRD pattern of C60 powder (curve e), several intense diffraction peaks at 2θ = 10.8°, 17.7°, 20.8° and 21.7° are observed, which are assigned to the (111), (220), (311) and (222) planes, respectively.27 For the g-C3N4/C60 hybrids (curves b–d), the overall XRD pattern shows a superposition of the diffraction signals of g-C3N4 and C60 components, confirming further the hybrid nature of these two components. The diffraction peak of g-C3N4 at 27.7° indexed as the (002) plane corresponding to the stacking of the conjugated aromatic system remains un-shifted in the g-C3N4/C60 hybrids, while the diffraction peak intensity decreases with the increase of the C60 weight ratio. However, the weaker diffraction peak at 13.0°, which is indexed as the (100) plane of g-C3N4 correlated with the interplanar distance of 0.676 nm, is hardly observed in the g-C3N4/C60 hybrids, indicating that the lattice structure of g-C3N4 is changed upon the attachment of the C60 moiety. On the other hand, the diffraction peak of C60 at 10.8° indexed as the (111) plane is also observed in g-C3N4/C60 hybrids but broadens apparently, suggesting that the crystallinity of the C60 moiety decreases within the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid. Besides, two new broad diffraction signals centered at 7.1° and 19.4° appears in g-C3N4/C60 hybrids, which should originate from the new lattice structure of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid. It is noteworthy that again these features are quite different from the composites based on g-C3N4 and C60 reported in ref. 26–28, in which the addition of C60 hardly affected the lattice structure of g-C3N4 as reflected by the intactness of the diffraction peak positions, and this is understandable because g-C3N4 and C60 components were blended physically in those cases.26–28 Thus, in the case of our g-C3N4/C60 hybrid, the influence of C60 attachment on the lattice structure of g-C3N4 is expected to result from covalent bonding between g-C3N4 and C60 components. Indeed, for the mixture of pristine g-C3N4 and C60 powders ball-milled without LiOH catalyst, its XRD pattern shows a similar feature to that of pristine g-C3N4 and signals of C60 are not detected (see ESI Fig. S6†), confirming that ball-milling itself would not result in an obvious change in the XRD pattern.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of pristine g-C3N4 (a), g-C3N4/C60-4 wt% (b), g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% (c), g-C3N4/C60-20 wt% (d), and C60 (e). 
In order to estimate the content of the attached C60 within the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a N2 atmosphere as shown in ESI Fig. S7.† The pristine g-C3N4 shows nearly 100% weight loss in the temperature range of 480–708 °C. For the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid, four weight loss processes were observed. In the first weight loss step (<170 °C), ∼13% weight loss is observed corresponding to the removal of physically adsorbed water. There is a further weight loss of ∼7% in the second weight loss process (170–480 °C), which can be assigned to the thermal elimination of the hydroxyl (–OH) groups.29,32 The third step (∼64%, 480–708 °C) can be assigned to the thermal detachment of g-C3N4 and the consequent weight loss of g-C3N4. The final weight loss step (∼9%, 708–830 °C) corresponds to the decomposition of the C60 moiety. According to the ratio of the C60 weight loss within the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid, the average molar content of the C60 molecule can be estimated to be 1 per 27.8 tri-s-triazine units. Interestingly, for the mixture of pristine g-C3N4 and C60 powders ball-milled without LiOH catalyst, the fourth weight loss step corresponding to the decomposition of the C60 moiety is not observed (see ESI Fig. S8†), confirming further the existence of C60 within the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid and the importance of the LiOH catalyst for the hybrid formation.
Based on the above characterization studies, we propose a possible conformation and formation mechanism of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid. Because g-C3N4 has a 2D layered structure analogous to graphene, it is reasonable to assume that, similar to the mechanism of mechanochemical functionalization of graphene extensively reported in the literature,29–32 high-energy ball-milling of g-C3N4 would result in the exfoliation of g-C3N4 to few-layered g-C3N4 nanosheets along with the generation of the reactive species (radicals and ions) via a mechanochemical cleavage of the C–N bonds involved in the tertiary amine (N–(C)3) connecting the tri-s-triazine unit. Meanwhile, pre-activated C60 radicals would form via the reaction of LiOH catalyst with C60 leading to breaking of the π–π carbon bonds.32,36 The reactive C60 radicals may then react with the reactive species of few-layered g-C3N4 nanosheets, leading to the formation of the covalently bonded hybrid of g-C3N4 nanosheets and C60, in which C60 attaches onto the edges of g-C3N4 nanosheets via a four-membered ring of azetidine and thus terminating the reactive sites of g-C3N4 nanosheets (see ESI Scheme S1†). It is noteworthy that functionalization of C60 affording the formation of azetidine has never been reported in fullerene chemistry;42 thus the solid-state mechanochemical route employed in the present work appears to be quite unique and advantageous for building such an unprecedented aza-heterocycle. Besides, another plausible conformation featuring the attachment of C60 onto the edge of pristine g-C3N4 through the formation of C–N single bonds resulting from the reaction of C60 with the terminal NHx is also considered and excluded according to a control experiment (see ESI Fig. S9†).
The microstructure of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 5a and b compare the typical SEM images of the pristine g-C3N4 and the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid. According to the SEM image, pristine g-C3N4 shows a lamellar structure with the size of 5–10 μm (see Fig. 5a). Upon the formation of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid, the lamellar structure of pristine g-C3N4 is hardly seen, and irregular particles with sizes smaller than 2 μm appear in its SEM image. This SEM image is similar to that of pure g-C3N4 after ball-milling (BM-g-C3N4) shown in ESI Fig. S10,† indicating the strong influence of the particle size by mechanochemical cutting.
 Fig. 5  SEM, TEM and HR-TEM images of the pristine g-C3N4 (a, c, e) and g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid (b, d, f), respectively. The insets in images e and f show the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. 
The TEM image of pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. 5c) also exhibits a lamellar structure, in agreement with the SEM result. While the sheet-like structure is also observed in the TEM image (Fig. 5d) of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid, there are some dark spots with lower transmission, indicating strong perturbation to the lamellar structure of g-C3N4 nanosheets. This is similar to the case of the C60/g-C3N4 composite reported in ref. 27. Besides, the TEM image of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid shows fewer layers according to the smaller contrast than that of pristine g-C3N4, indicating the exfoliation of bulk g-C3N4. Furthermore, some indiscernible lattice feature is observed in the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid (Fig. 5f), which is absent in that of the pristine g-C3N4, suggesting the influence of the covalently attached C60 molecules on the crystallinity of g-C3N4. However, since the power of the electron beam available for our TEM instrument is so high that damage to C60 molecules is induced, it is quite hard to accurately distinguish whether such a lattice feature is due to C60 molecules. According to the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images shown in the insets of Fig. 5e and f, no obvious difference in crystallinity between g-C3N4/C60 and pristine g-C3N4 is observed, suggesting that the polycrystalline property of the pristine g-C3N4 is retained after C60 attachment. We also performed TEM elemental mapping analyses in order to identify more accurately the compositions of C and N elements within the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid (ESI Fig. S11†), confirming experimentally that C60 molecules bond to the cleaved edge of g-C3N4.
Since charge transfer from g-C3N4 to C60 may take place in the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid as revealed by the above Raman spectroscopic study, it is intriguing to investigate the influence of C60 on the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. In three previous reports the photocatalytic activities of C60/g-C3N4 composites, which were based on physically blended C60 and g-C3N4, were examined via degradation of dyes alone.26–28 In our present study, we managed to study the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid for visible light photocatalytic hydrogen production. Due to the small absorption edge at ∼460 nm of g-C3N4 derived from its wide bandgap of ∼2.7 eV, the utilization efficiency of visible light is quite limited for the pristine g-C3N4 as experimentally confirmed below. Therefore, dyes such as eosin Y (EY) have been usually used as sensitizers of g-C3N4 for extending the spectral response region.43,44 Accordingly, the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid was applied in powder form for H2 production from water splitting under visible light (λ > 420 nm) in the presence of 5 vol% triethanolamine (TEOA, as a hole scavenger) and EY (as a photosensitizer), while other noble metal cocatalysts such as Pt were avoided so as to evaluate the metal-free photocatalytic activity.43,44Fig. 6 compares visible light photocatalytic H2 production rates based on the pristine g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/C60 hybrid photocatalysts measured under different conditions. According to our results, the pristine g-C3N4 (sample A) hardly produces H2, confirming its low photocatalytic activity due to the small absorption edge at ∼460 nm.43,44 Likewise, upon C60 attachment, the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid (sample B) produces almost no H2 either, suggesting that C60 cannot function as a photocatalyst or photosensitizer as confirmed from its nearly zero H2 production rate (sample C). After incorporating EY as a photosensitizer which shows a low H2 production rate of 4 μmol h−1 g−1 (sample D), C60 (sample E) still shows a quite low H2 production rate of 6 μmol h−1 g−1, whereas the H2 production rate increases dramatically to 67 μmol h−1 g−1 for g-C3N4 (sample F), which is comparable to those reported in the literature.14,45–47 This result demonstrates the efficient spectral sensitization of g-C3N4 by EY during the H2 production process.43,44
 Fig. 6  Photocatalytic H2 production rates of different samples measured in 5 vol% TEOA aqueous solution in the presence of EY for 3 h under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp. 
Interestingly, upon C60 attachment, g-C3N4/C60 hybrids (samples G–I) exhibit much higher H2 production rates, and the highest H2 production rate reaches 266 μmol h−1 g−1 for the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid (sample H), which is about 4.0 times higher than that for the pristine g-C3N4 photocatalyst (67 μmol h−1 g−1, in the presence of EY). Changing the weight ratio of C60:g-C3N4 in the raw mixture of pristine g-C3N4 and C60 powders to 4% (g-C3N4/C60-4 wt%, sample G) and 20% (g-C3N4/C60-20 wt%, sample I) results in a decrease of the H2 production rate to 197 and 169 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. Thus, the optimum weight ratio of C60:g-C3N4 in the raw mixture of pristine g-C3N4 and C60 powders is found to be 12 wt%. Besides, action spectra of the H2 production of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% in the presence of EY were measured, revealing that the apparent quantum efficiencies (Φ) of both g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% decreased with the increasing wavelength of the incident light, coinciding with the corresponding absorption spectra. Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiencies of g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% were higher than those of g-C3N4 under each incident light wavelength (see ESI Fig. S12 and Table S1†), confirming that covalent bonding of C60 onto g-C3N4 can indeed result in enhanced visible light photocatalytic H2 production. The stability of the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid photocatalyst for visible light H2 production is also evaluated, and is as good as that of the pristine g-C3N4 (see ESI Fig. S13†). For a control study, we also measured the H2 production rates of a physical blend of g-C3N4:C60 (64:9, w/w, labelled as g-C3N4 + C60), a mixture of pristine g-C3N4 and C60 powders ball-milled without LiOH catalyst (g-C3N4-C60-w/o LiOH) and C60/g-C3N4 composites prepared using the method reported in ref. 27, and found that their H2 production rates measured under the same conditions were much lower than that obtained for the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid (see ESI Fig. S14†), revealing the important role of hybrid formation in enhancing the photocatalytic H2 production.
In order to understand the mechanism responsible for the C60-induced photocatalytic activity enhancement, we investigated the effects of C60 bonding on the electronic absorption, specific surface area and electrical conductivity of g-C3N4. According to the comparison of the absorption spectra of the pristine g-C3N4 and the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid, the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid shows much stronger absorption than the pristine g-C3N4 especially in the vis-NIR region (see ESI Fig. S15A†). The estimated bandgap of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid is 2.77 eV according to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic study, which is smaller than that of the pristine g-C3N4 (2.90 eV) (see ESI Fig. S15B†). Therefore, covalent attachment of C60 leads to the decrease of the bandgap of g-C3N4. This is similar to the case of a composite of g-C3N4 and C60 blended physically as reported in ref. 27. Although, in principle, the enhanced absorption intensity in the vis-NIR region due to the decrease of the bandgap of g-C3N4 is expected to contribute to photocatalytic activity enhancement, the nearly zero H2 production rate in the absence of an EY photosensitizer (sample B) indicates that the enhanced absorption intensity in the vis-NIR region is not a major factor responsible for photocatalytic activity enhancement. This is understandable since C60 cannot function as a photocatalyst or a photosensitizer like EY; thus the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid is still limited by g-C3N4.
Since a photocatalytic H2 production reaction occurs on the surface of a photocatalyst, its specific surface area is crucial for the adsorption of H2 molecules. The specific surface area of the pristine g-C3N4 measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method is 12.5 m2 g−1, comparable to that reported in ref. 14. Upon C60 bonding, the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid exhibits a BET surface area of 16.6 m2 g−1, which is higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4 but comparable to those of pure g-C3N4 after ball-milling (BM-g-C3N4) and the g-C3N4/C60 mixture ball-milled without the LiOH catalyst (g-C3N4-C60-w/o LiOH) (see ESI Table S2†). This suggests that the increase of the specific surface area of g-C3N4 is attributed to the exfoliation of bulk g-C3N4 during ball-milling instead of C60 bonding within the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid.
The electrical conductivity of the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid was measured by a standard four-point probe technique and compared with those of pristine g-C3N4 and a physical blend of g-C3N4:C60 (g-C3N4 + C60). The measured conductivity of the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid (1.19 × 10−6 S cm−1) is about two orders of magnitude higher than those of the pristine g-C3N4 (8.6 × 10−9 S cm−1, consistent with that reported in ref. 48) and a physical blend of g-C3N4:C60 (g-C3N4 + C60, 1.58 × 10−8 S cm−1) (see ESI Fig. S17†). These results indicate that, due to the well-known high conductivity of C60,49 covalent bonding of C60 onto g-C3N4 results in dramatically improved conductivity of g-C3N4, and this is beneficial for electron transport in the interior of the g-C3N4/C60 photocatalyst.
To elucidate further the differences in photocatalytic properties between the pristine g-C3N4 and the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid, we estimated their band energy levels by using Mott–Schottky (MS) plots (i.e., 1/C2versus E, where C is the capacitance27,50), from which the typical n-type semiconductor feature can be confirmed for both the pristine g-C3N4 and the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid based on the overall shape of the reversed sigmoidal plots.27,50 The flat-band potential is determined from the intersection point of the potential and linear potential curves,27,50 and is approximately −1.15 and −0.92 V vs. Ag/AgCl (−0.95 and −0.72 V vs. NHE) for the pristine g-C3N4 and the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid, respectively (see ESI Fig. S18†). According to the value of the bandgap estimated from the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic study discussed above, the positions of the valence band maxima of the pristine g-C3N4 and the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid are estimated to be 1.75 and 1.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl (1.95 and 2.05 V vs. NHE), respectively. Hence, the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid exhibits positive shifts of both the flat-band potential and valence band maximum relative to those of the pristine g-C3N4. Specifically for the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid, the lowering of the conduction band minimum suggests an enhancement of the electron transfer from the photosensitizer EY to the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid upon the covalent attachment of C60 (see Scheme 2), facilitating the separation of electron–hole pairs.
 Scheme 2  A schematic of the photocatalytic H2 production mechanism for the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid. 
The effect of C60 on the charge separation process determinative of the photocatalytic performance of a photocatalyst is further investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Based on the integral of the PL band, the broad PL signal of the pristine g-C3N4 centered at about 446 nm is completely quenched in the g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% hybrid (see ESI Fig. S19†). Such a dramatic PL quenching suggests that the covalent attachment of C60 results in a fast photoinduced electron transfer from g-C3N4 to C60 and thus the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs of g-C3N4 may be inhibited.26–28,45
On the basis of the above analyses, a mechanism accounting for the enhanced H2-production activity of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid relative to the pristine g-C3N4 is proposed in Scheme 2. As extensively reported in the literature for the pristine g-C3N4 the photo-generated electron–hole pairs generally suffer from rapid recombination; thus only a fraction of the electrons can take part in the photocatalytic reaction contributing to a low photocatalytic activity.27,45 After the addition of EY whose bandgap (2.15 eV (ref. 51)) is much smaller than that of g-C3N4 (∼2.7 eV), since the H2 production activities of both pristine g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/C60-12 wt% are dramatically enhanced (see Fig. 6), the photo-excitation of EY affording electron–hole pairs (step 1) should be more dominating than that of g-C3N4 (step 2).43,51 Therefore, after visible light irradiation, EY as the photosensitizer is predominately excited, and the photo-generated electrons are transferred from the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of EY (−1.05 V vs. NHE51) to the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 (step 3), followed by a reduction of H2O to produce H2 (step 4). Meanwhile, the separated holes accumulating at the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of EY (1.10 V vs. NHE51) can react readily with TEOA as a hole scavenger.43 Upon covalent attachment of C60, the lowering of the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 by 0.23 V (see Scheme 2) may facilitate electron transfer from the LUMO level of EY to the CB of g-C3N4 (step 3). Besides, the fast photoinduced electron transfer from g-C3N4 to C60 revealed by the above PL study is further beneficial for the separation of electron–hole pairs, and this along with the improved conductivity contributes directly to the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid relative to the pristine g-C3N4.
Conclusions
In summary, for the first time we successfully synthesized a covalently bonded g-C3N4/C60 hybrid via a solid-state mechanochemical route by ball-milling g-C3N4 and C60 in the presence of LiOH as a catalyst. The hybrid structure of g-C3N4/C60 was confirmed by a series of spectroscopic studies, and a possible conformation of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid was proposed, featuring the covalent bonding of C60 onto the edges of g-C3N4 nanosheets via a four-membered ring of azetidine, which has never been reported in fullerene chemistry. Based on the microstructural characterization studies, g-C3N4/C60 hybrid is comprised of few-layered g-C3N4 nanosheets resulting from the mechanochemical cutting and bonding of C60 molecules to the cleaved edge of g-C3N4. The g-C3N4/C60 hybrid was applied for H2 production from water splitting under visible light (λ > 420 nm), and a H2 production rate of 266 μmol h−1 g−1 is obtained under optimized conditions without using any noble metal cocatalysts such as Pt, which is about 4.0 times higher than that for the pristine g-C3N4 photocatalyst (67 μmol h−1 g−1). Upon covalent bonding of C60, the enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the conjunct effects of the facilitated electron transfer from the photosensitizer EY to g-C3N4 due to the lowering of the conduction band of g-C3N4 and the inhibited recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs owing to the fast photoinduced electron transfer process from g-C3N4 to C60. The facile synthesis of the covalently bonded g-C3N4/C60 hybrid with enhanced photocatalytic activity for visible light H2 production opens up a new route for hybridizing 2D nanomaterials and nanocarbons toward potential applications in energy conversion.
Experimental
Materials
C60 (99.5%) was purchased from Suzhou DCN Co., Ltd. Dicyandiamide (C2H4N4, 99%) and LiOH (95%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd; LiOH was subjected to vacuum heating at 110 °C for 4 h to remove the crystallized water.
Synthesis of the g-C3N4/C60 hybrid
g-C3N4 was synthesized by the standard pyrolysis method using dicyandiamide as the precursor, which was heated at 550 °C for 4 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 in a ceramic container.33 Mixtures of 500 mg pristine g-C3N4, different amounts of C60 powders (20, 60 or 100 mg) and 300 mg LiOH were ball-milled at 500 rpm for 24 h (Pulverisette 7, Fritsch GmbH, Germany). In a control experiment, 500 mg pure g-C3N4 or a mixture of 500 mg g-C3N4 and 100 mg C60 without LiOH was also ball-milled at 500 rpm for 24 h. The product was washed with deionized water to remove the unreacted LiOH, and was then Soxhlet-extracted with CS2 for 48 h to remove the unreacted C60. Finally, the product was obtained after heating at 70 °C for 2 h under vacuum.
Photocatalytic measurements
Photocatalytic H2 production experiments were carried out in a 200 mL Pyrex top-irradiation reaction vessel connected to a glass closed gas circulation system. A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used to provide the visible light irradiation. In a typical photocatalytic reaction, 10.0 mg of the powder sample was dispersed in a 100 mL aqueous solution containing 17.5 mg eosin Y (EY) and 5 ml triethanolamine (TEOA) for 3 h. The amount of evolved H2 was determined with a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For the quantum efficiency measurements, 50 mg of the powder sample was dispersed in a 100 mL aqueous solution containing 17.5 mg EY and 5 ml TEOA, and measured by using a 300 W Xe lamp with 420, 450, 475, 520, and 550 nm band-pass filters and an irradiatometer (FZ-A, Beijing Normal University Optical Instrument) which was used to calibrate the power of the light (0.194, 0.205, 0.202, 0.305 and 0.225 J s−1 for 420, 450, 475, 520, and 550 nm, respectively).
Characterization
FTIR spectra were collected on a TENSOR 27 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer. Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman microscope (Renishaw, England) excited with 532 and 785 nm laser lights. SEM images were obtained on a JEOL JSM-7401F instrument (Japan). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was carried out using a JEOL 2100 microscope operated at a voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 (Thermo-VV Scientific) machine. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Q600 SDT instrument (TA, USA). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis was carried out on a Tristar II 3020 M instrument (Micromeritics, USA). Electrical conductivity was measured by using a four-point probe technique with a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400). Mott–Schottky (MS) plot measurements were performed at a frequency of 1 kHz in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution on a 660A electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments Inc., USA) at room temperature.
