However, not all pretreatment techniques are viable alternatives for industrial practice. Pretreatment is an important step to upgrade different kinds of lignocellulosic biomass into more valuable products, including biofuels and bio-based industrial chemicals. Most of the pretreatment techniques have their limitations or weaknesses, including high operational costs and temperature, toxicity and corrosiveness to the instrument, etc., while, some other pretreatment methods such as biological and plasma pretreatment are green procedures that can also be used to alter the physical and chemical properties of lignocellulosic materials. Although our present understanding is still low and not much research has been done to guarantee which pretreatment method is the reliable alternative, the combination of different pretreatment methods could be a good strategy to overcome the limitations of each approach. This review presents an overview of different pretreatment methods of lignocellulosic biomass to increase the rate and the degree of cellulose hydrolysis and subsequent processing steps as well as future perspectives.
1.0 Introduction
1.1 Context
Governments throughout the world are envisaging the utilization of renewable resources and energies, including wind, hydroelectricity, solar, biogas, and biomass, to offset petroleum-based resource consumption and address environmental sustainability concerns.1 Due to the rising rate of population growth and environmental problems related to industrialization, there have been increasing efforts to find alternative resources to produce chemicals and energy.2,3 Lignocellulosic biomass materials which are the largest group of sustainable carbon materials have been considered as one of the promising renewable resources to produce various types of biofuels and bio-based industrial chemicals.4,5 Upgrading different kinds of lignocellulosic biomass into more valuable products including biochar, bio-oil, or other bio-based chemicals in a form of biorefinery design is a well-received concept. However, to assure a successful application, it requires a specific model based on biorefining and sustainable and cost-competitive manufacturing processes.6,7 Therefore, the idea of using the principles of green chemistry in biorefineries for production, material efficiency, energy enhancement, and reducing toxicity and waste generation, as well as increasing the reusability of products upon the completion of their lifespan, has aroused distinct concern and discussion.6,8 Lignocellulose is a complex biopolymer that is mainly composed of carbohydrate polymers (cellulose and hemicellulose) as well as a phenolic polymer (lignin) (Fig. 1), interconnected with strong bonds that give it a highly robust structure. Therefore, it has excellent resistance to chemical reactions.3,9 The main structural component (≈40–60 wt%) in the cell walls of a plant is cellulose, which constitutes a linear polymer (repeating units) of glucose molecules connected by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds.2,10

Cellulose is known as a sustainable source of raw materials for the growing demand for eco-friendly and biocompatible products, which are readily accessible and does not compete with the food supply.12,13 The second component (≈20–30 wt%) of the lignocellulosic polymer is hemicellulose. Unlike cellulose, it has a random, amorphous, and branched structure, including a combination of some heteropolymers such as arabinoxylan, glucomannan, glucuronoxylan, galactomannan, xylan, and xyloglucan. Hemicelluloses have a variety of structural compositions between different types of plants, for example, in softwood and hardwood. Softwood hemicelluloses contain mainly glucomannans, whereas hardwood hemicelluloses contain mainly xylans.
The heteropolymers of hemicellulose consist of various units of pentose (e.g., arabinose, xylose) and hexose (e.g., glucose, mannose, galactose) monosaccharides and acetylated sugars. Hemicellulose monomer units are the ones that are fixed in the cell walls of plant tissues in order to provide a complex network of bonds that enables the structural strength by linking cellulose fibres into microfibrils and cross-linking with lignin.14 Lastly, lignin (≈15–25 wt%) is a three-dimensional (3D) polymer of phenylpropanoid units in the plant cell wall. It acts similar to the glue between the cellular networks, where the plant tissue and the individual fibres gain compressive strength, cell-wall toughness, and insect and pathogen resistance. The structures of lignin are formed by the oxidative combination of three unique blocks of phenylpropane; monolignols: p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol. In the lignin polymer, the respective phenylpropanoid monomeric units are known as p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S).14 The plant cell walls are not uniformly distributed with cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Based on the variety, tissues, and maturity of the plant cell wall, the structure and number of those components vary.11,14
The recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic biomass entails pretreatment processes to unlock the cell wall and make the structure porous, as well as changing or removing the structural and compositional impediments before its valorisation.15,16 Pretreatment of lignocellulose is a balancing act that has received great research attention worldwide because it has an important impact on the economic, technical and environmental sustainability of biofuels and bio-based chemical production.17 The pretreatment process of lignocellulosic biomass can generally be categorized into physical, chemical, and biological techniques. Physical pretreatment procedures (e.g., milling and grinding) usually precede other forms of pretreatment techniques, primarily implemented to decrease the particle size to enable the ease and effectiveness of subsequent processes. Due to not using any type of chemical, these methods are considered as an environmentally friendly technique. Despite that, a major limitation of physical pretreatment is its high energy consumption.18,19 Chemical (wet) techniques have been extensively studied and demonstrated to be effective. They involve using a solvent or a combination of reagents to open the bundles of lignocelluloses, and unlike physical pretreatment, this procedure can be capable of eliminating lignin macromolecules through acids, enzymes or other chemical pretreatments by disturbing the lignin carbohydrate linkages, melting or restructuring the lignin components or solubilization of lignin. However, these procedures are typically considered as polluting, aggressive, and time and energy-consuming techniques. Physicochemical pretreatment methods such as plasma pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass have recently appeared as a new economically feasible and environmentally friendly technique, which seems to be a viable alternative to conventional pretreatment. Biological pretreatment degrades lignin using fungi with low energy and no chemical consumption; nonetheless, this technique is slow, and it is difficult to control the treatment conditions, so efforts towards the development and implementation of any alternative pretreatment techniques are highly recommended in the current and forthcoming lignocellulosic biomass research.2,6,7,45 In the majority of research work, to enhance the biorefinery and conversion of biomass, normally a combination of various pretreatment methods is recommended.46,47 The primary objective of this analysis is to examine the current shortcomings of each pretreatment technique by reviewing the recent progress on the pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials. Besides, regardless of the current developments in pretreatment and hydrolytic techniques, this review highlighted the effectiveness of combined pretreatment techniques, and their recent advancements to overcome the limitations of most of the traditional pretreatment techniques to increase the rate and the degree of cellulose hydrolysis and subsequent processing steps. This work also justifies the continuous need for developing the enhanced methods, equipment and systems for pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials as future perspectives.
1.2 Lignocellulosic biomass
Lignocellulose refers to a variety of dry plant matter i.e. biomass, the so-called lignocellulosic biomass. It is the most abundantly accessible plant material with approximate worldwide availability of up to 1.3 × 1010 metric tonnes per annum.3,19 Lignocellulosic materials have a complex structure constituted by three major organic components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) and also some lipids, tannins, waxes, proteins, pectins, and inorganic materials as minor constituents.2,19 As a result, they represent the largest group of sustainable carbon materials and the most promising raw materials for renewable production of bioethanols, biofuels, and biochemicals.48 Numerous studies on biorefinery applications of lignocellulosic biomass towards the development of value-added products within a biorefinery model are available.7,49,50 Generally, there are a variety of plant sources of lignocellulosic biomass including rice straw, rice husk, corn stover, corn cob, wheat straw, barley straw, sorghum straw, sorghum pulp, cotton stalk, pine, switchgrass, water hyacinth, sugarcane bagasse, bamboo, etc. The compositions of several lignocellulosic feedstocks are summarized in Table 1, adapted from ref. 16 and 19. Based on the different types of lignocellulosic biomass, the matrix of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin biopolymers assembles into complex non-uniform 3D structures to various degrees and with a variety of similar compositions.14 They have lower amounts of hydrogen and carbon and higher fractions of oxygen in comparison to petroleum resources. Because of having such a wide range of compositional diversity of plant raw materials, more categories of products can be derived from the biorefinery process of lignocellulosic biomass compared to petroleum-based resources. However, a relatively wide variety of processing technologies are required to add value to the basic components during the pretreatment of lignocellulose materials. Indeed, the majority of these techniques such as green biorefinery (efficient enzymatic hydrolysis), biorefineries for the chemical industry (conversion of cellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars/ethanol), etc. are still at pre-commercial levels of development or not yet fully commercialized in industry. Resistance to enzymatic and chemical deconstruction is one of the challenging intrinsic characteristics of native lignocellulosic resources. The pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is important to change the physical and chemical properties of substances; however, it is an expensive process concerning cost and energy.1,7,14,51

2.0 Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass
The procedure of lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment is the most challenging step in the biorefinery process. The pretreatment step can constitute more than 40% of the total cost of processing, and degradation of lignocellulose materials via the saccharification process with no pretreatment step may lead to total sugar yields below 20%, whereas the total sugar yield in the same procedure with some pretreatment methods can reach up to 0–90%.52 In the structure of lignocellulose materials, cellulose strands are grouped at once into semicrystalline microfibrils that are cross-linked together through hemicellulose in a matrix of lignin to produce fibres and macrofibrils via different intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This kind of complex lignocellulosic structure protects cellulose from both chemical and biological attacks.2 To access the cellulose within the complex lignocellulosic structure, it is essential to lower the cellulose crystallinity, increase the lignocellulosic materials' surface area, eliminate hemicellulose, and break the lignin seal by employing an effective pretreatment method (Fig. 2), which allows these barriers to be broken, so that hydrolytic entities (e.g. enzymes) enter and trigger the hydrolysis reaction.10,16,53

Several pretreatment technologies with their merits and demerits for fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass into its constituents have been developed, with many of these techniques being the combination of both physical and chemical characteristics, thus they are typically classified as physical–chemical procedures.6,56 To date, no single optimal pretreatment process for lignocellulosic biomass has been discovered.6Table 2 summarizes some of the most promising types of pretreatment methods and compares the pros and cons of each approach. Currently, the greatest challenge in this area is to establish novel techniques that simplify the efficiency of the treatment for lignocellulosic biomass to access mainly the cellulose structure with low cost and environmental effects.57

2.1 Physical pretreatment
The physical pretreatment of lignocellulose normally includes the comminution (milling, grinding, chopping, etc.) method which leads to particle size reduction, depolymerization, and lowering of its crystallinity. This structural alteration results in improved cellulose reactivity for subsequent biochemical conversion.58,59 Mechanical approaches are not usually suitable when applied individually.57 Mechanical pretreatment that is associated with grinding has the advantage of being eco-friendly, as it does not rely on using chemicals such as alkalis or acids. Nevertheless, it is also an energy-intensive operation, therefore, it is better to be used in combination with other pretreatment techniques to save energy and lower the costs of the process. Mechanical treatments are not capable of removing lignin, which acts as both a physical and chemical barrier to limit the enzyme access to cellulose.18,60 Different (dry/wet, centrifugal, jet, and vibratory) ball milling and compression milling processes have been used in a variety of research work alone or with the combination of other methods (acids, enzymes and irradiation) in order to make material handling easier in subsequent processing in the past.61–68 In the ball milling technique, normally ball attrition comminutes a variety of materials to ultrafine particles and in compression milling, normally a two-roll mill with various diameters has been used.61,65,68 Licari et al.68 have compared the effects of four mechanical deconstruction methods namely ball milling, vibratory ball milling, centrifugal milling, and jet milling in terms of energy demand and energy efficiency at a lab scale in the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for bioenergy production. They have reported that the highest glucose yield was achieved when using the vibratory ball milling method for 3 h and in terms of energy efficiency, the centrifugal milling method was the most efficient one compared to ball milling, vibratory ball milling and jet milling. The schematic of the different ball milling strategies is shown in Fig. 3. In another research study, Gu et al.69 have reported the effects of various water contents, i.e., 0, 25, 100, and 400% (w/w) at two milling temperatures (80 °C and 100 °C) and three milling times (10, 20, and 30 min) on the ball milling pretreatment of corn stover and the subsequent enzymatic digestibility. They have stated that milling without using water resulted in faster grinding speeds than that with water and yielded the highest glucose production (67%) at 80 °C after 30 min; however, one of the highest glucose yields (54%) has also been achieved with 400% (w/w) water input when samples were milled at 100 °C for 30 min. The authors have concluded that for ball milling, in particular, the dry mode (no input of water) is recommended and their findings can provide a basis for reducing water use and improving sustainability during the production of lignocellulosic biofuels. As shown in Fig. 4, as a result of the milling process the cell wall matrix of corn stover was disrupted which represented the structural changes of the rigid surface of corn stover. If physical pretreatment is combined with high temperature, the possibility of observing significant chemical changes such as dissolution and degradation of hemicelluloses will increase, similar to the result that has been reported in the literature;70 however, Gu et al.69 emphasized that no noticeable chemical changes were detected in their samples, because mild temperatures (80–100 °C) were used for the pretreatment.

2.2 Chemical pretreatment
Chemical pretreatment, commonly done by using a solvent or a combination of reagents, simplifies the conversion of lignocellulose materials by reacting the biomass with chemicals having either a physical (via solvation, disrupting covalent and hydrogen bonding) or a chemical (via chemical reactions) effect on the structure of biomass.71,72 Acidic,73,74 basic (alkaline),75,76 carbon dioxide treatment,77,78 ionic liquids,79,80 organosolv,81,82 and ozonolysis83,84 are all diverse chemical pretreatment techniques that impact the biomass properties. Compared with the other pretreatment methods (physical and biological), chemical pretreatment is the most predominantly used method because it is usually less expensive and results in faster rates and better efficiencies in enhancing the degradation of complex organic materials.85,86 Nevertheless, chemical pretreatment methods might have their own limitations or weaknesses, including corrosiveness of acids and bases especially the strong types such as concentrated acids, handling and the need for recovery steps after pretreatment to make the pretreatment procedures economically viable.71,72

2.2.1 Acid pretreatment. 
Acid pretreatment has gained considerable attention in recent years and is one of the most widely reported chemical procedures.16 The acid pretreatment procedure can be performed in two ways: one using a combination of concentrated acid and low temperature (e.g., 30–70% and 40 °C), and the other one using mixed conditions of diluted acid and high temperature (e.g., 0.1% and 230 °C).6 The reason for using acid treatment is simply because the cellulose polymer is highly crystalline and requires harsh conditions such as treatment with acid or heat treatment and the combination of both. Organic and inorganic strong and weak acids such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4),87–90 hydrochloric acid (HCl),91–93 nitric acid (HNO3),94–96 phosphoric acid (H3PO4),97–99 acetic acid (CH3COOH),100–102 and maleic acid (C4H4O4),103,104 as well as the combination of different acids, for example, mixed solutions of acetic and propionic acids,105 oxalic and sulfuric acids/phosphoric and sulfuric acids/ferric chloride and sulfuric acid106 have all been used for acid pretreatment, with H2SO4 (typically with concentrations below 4% (wt)) being the most extensively studied acid as it is inexpensive and effective.6,10
Esteghlalian et al.88 studied the effects of dilute acid pretreatment using a combination of different concentrations of H2SO4 (0.6, 0.9 and 1.2% w/w) and high temperatures (140, 160 and 180 °C) on three different lignocellulosic feedstocks namely corn stover, poplar, and switchgrass. The dilute H2SO4 pretreatment was able to remove the protective shield of hemicellulose and lignin networks, which resulted in increased accessibility of cellulose to enzymatic digestion. Based on their results, temperature was the key parameter affecting the level of sugar recovery, a more significant factor than acid concentration. By using a low concentration of acid (1.2% (w/w)) at high temperature (180 °C), they were able to recover up to 90% of xylose. They have modelled the hydrolysis reaction process of hemicellulose to its monomeric units and the chance of these monomeric constituents to degrade by a series of first-order kinetic functions. The kinetic factors to predict the yields of xylose were defined by the actual concentrations of acid in the reactor following consideration of the substrate's neutralisation effect. In another research study, Lloyd and Wyman87 reported the acid pretreatment (stage 1) of corn stover using dilute H2SO4 followed by enzymatic hydrolysis (stage 2) of the remaining solids. Based on their results, in stage 1, acid pretreatment enhanced the xylan solubilization rate with respect to xylose degradation and therefore, increased the yields of xylose sugar followed by enzymatic digestion of glucose in stage 2, resulting in higher maximum yields. It was also noted that increasing the temperature in stage 1 accelerated both xylose release and degradation with maximum xylose yields. Similar to Lloyd and Wyman's group, Zu et al.91 have also used a two-stage procedure to maximize the sugar recovery of corn stover. Initially, they have used diluted hydrochloric acid to treat the corn stover to increase the yields of xylose, and then to modify the structure of lignin and swell the cellulose surface the residues were treated with lime. For the diluted hydrochloric acid pretreatment, the optimum conditions were 120 °C and 40 min, followed by 60 °C for 12 hours of lime pretreatment and lime loading at 0.1 g g−1 of substrate. They have reported that due to the swelling of the inner surface area, the degree of polymerization was decreased, and the porosity was increased, and therefore the two-stage procedure is considered to be successful.
Kim et al.94 investigated the pretreatment effects of HNO3 as an acid catalyst on rice straw for enhancing ethanol production. The maximum yield of xylose (86.5%) and the highest yield of enzymatic hydrolysis (83%) were obtained when using optimal pretreatment conditions, which refer to using HNO3 with a concentration of 0.65% at a temperature of 158.8 °C for a reaction time of 5.86 min. Their research outcomes reveal that HNO3 could be useful not only as an acid catalyst in the pretreatment process but also by forming nitrates from neutralization of HNO3. It can be incorporated in the fermentation process for bioethanol production as a nitrogen source and replace other common nitrogen sources such as yeast extract ammonium, amino acid, and urea. They concluded that the overall costs for the production of bioethanol can be minimised by this strong acid catalyst. In another study by Geddes et al.98 on sugarcane bagasse for sugar monomer production, the pretreatment with 1% (w/w) H3PO4 at 160 °C for 10 min was reported to yield higher monomers, in which, this pretreatment process was reported to be effective because it successfully hydrolyzes hemicellulose in the substrate. Therefore, the accessibility of cellulose for enzymatic digestion is increased. They determined that the formation of inhibitory compounds during the reaction was lower using phosphoric acid compared to employing H2SO4 at elevated temperatures. Kootstra et al.103 considered the enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw after the pretreatment process with an organic acid like C4H4O4. The effects of the process variables (pretreatment time, temperature, and concentration of acid) have been studied and the optimal pretreatment process conditions were the temperature of 170 °C, the C4H4O4 concentration of 46 mM and the pretreatment time of 50 min. They reported that in combination with an enzymatic hydrolysis stage, up to 85% conversion rate of glucan to glucose was achieved. Zhao et al.105 used the combination of acetic and propionic acid solution (1:1 mixture ratio) to pretreat rice straw for the production of methane. The effects of acidic pretreatment process conditions such as the concentration of acid, pretreatment time, and solid-to-liquid ratio on the performance of the delignification process have been investigated, on top of that, the rate of methane gas production from pretreated rice straw was examined. The optimal pretreatment process conditions were achieved when using acid with a concentration of 0.75 mol L−1 at a 1:20 solid-to-liquid ratio for 2 h pretreatment time. It was found that the total production rate of methane gas was increased by 36% using acid pretreated rice straw compared to that using untreated rice straw. Although acid pretreatment can be helpful to open the structure of biomass for hydrolysis purposes, nevertheless, concentrated acids are corrosive, hazardous, and toxic, therefore, acid pretreatment needs equipment that is resistant to corrosion, on top of that a neutralization step to remove acids from substances.10,72


2.2.2 Alkaline pretreatment. 
Similar to acid pretreatment, one of the major chemical pretreatment techniques is alkaline pretreatment that has shown great promise for solubilization of lignocellulosic biomass. In this pretreatment typically numerous alkali compounds including sodium hydroxide (NaOH),76,107,108 potassium hydroxide (KOH),109,110 calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2),111–113 sodium carbonate (Na2CO3),114,115 aqueous ammonia (e.g., ammonium hydroxide, ammonium carbonate)75,116–118 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)119,120 or combination of these can be used.72 One of the major effects of alkali pretreatment is their selectivity for breaking down the lignin structure without degrading carbohydrates, increasing the internal surface area and porosity of materials by promoting structural swelling, therefore, improving the reactivity of the remaining polysaccharides. It has been used traditionally for non-wood fibres such as straw, sugar cane or bagasse.121 During alkali pretreatment, the saponification procedure of the intermolecular acetyl and various uronic ester groups increases the accessibility of cellulose and hemicelluloses to enzymatic digestion.72
Unlike acid pretreatment, in alkaline pretreatment, less sugar is degraded and it causes regeneration of more caustic salts.10 Zheng et al.76 reported the effects of wet state (WS) NaOH pretreatment on corn stover for enhancing the production of biogas. The total biogas yield of 73%, methane yield of 73%, and shorter technical digestion time (35%) were obtained when using appropriate conditions such as a moisture content of 88%, a treatment time of 3 days, and an ambient temperature of 20 °C at a NaOH dosage of 2% w/w with a 65 g L−1 loading rate for anaerobic fermentation as compared to the untreated group. They concluded that the NaOH pretreatment process was highly efficient in the WS, compared to the solid state since the WS used a shorter pretreatment time by 86% (≤24 h) and needed a 67% lower dose of NaOH in contrast to the solid-state process. The total amount of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose (LCH) was reduced by 9.3–19.1% after the NaOH pretreatment. Wang et al.107 reported the alkaline pretreatment of coastal Bermuda grass (CBG) (Cynodon dactylon L.) using different concentrations of NaOH solution (0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, and 3% w/v) and residence times of 15–90 min at a temperature of 121 °C. The results were assessed concerning the total removal rates of lignin and production of total reducing sugars (TRS), xylose and glucose from enzymatic saccharification of the pretreated materials. The highest digestibility of CBG in terms of the conversion rate of glucan and xylan (65% and 90%, respectively) was achieved when the optimal conditions for NaOH pretreatment were 121 °C, 0.75% NaOH and 15 min reaction time. The results showed that the removal rate of lignin is up to 86%, which facilitates the digestibility of carbohydrates. The TRS rate of about 71% of the theoretical maximum was obtained under optimal pretreatment conditions.
Liu et al.109 investigated a variety of KOH loading solutions (2%, 6%, 10%, 14%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, and 50% (w/w dry basis)) for the pretreatment of wheat straw at ambient temperature (20 °C) for 24 h reaction time to increase enzymatic and microbial degradability. Higher loads of KOH have contributed to a higher reduction of lignin and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in a final mixture. The highest (54.7%) reduction rate of lignin was detected at a KOH loading of 50%. Compared with untreated straw, the specific yields of the hydrolysis process were obtained (14–92%) around KOH loadings of 2–50%, and the yields of methane increased from 17% to 78% when KOH loadings were in the range of 10–50%, respectively. The overall yields of reducing sugar (490 mg g−1, total solids) and methane (210 mL g−1, volatile solids) of raw samples were achieved at the best KOH loading (20%). Calcium hydroxide (also known as lime) was stated to be an efficient pretreatment agent and is considered the cheapest hydroxide per kilogram. The lime pretreatment process involves soaking the lime with water, spraying the lignocellulosic resources with it, and keeping the material mass for a range of hours to weeks. Typically the biomass particle size is 10 mm or less.10,16Fig. 5 shows the system for the lab-scale lime biomass pretreatment.

Kim and Holtzapple111 reported on the non-oxidative and oxidative conditions of lime pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) content of corn stover to improve mono-sugar (glucose and xylose) productions. Using the optimal pretreatment conditions (4 weeks, 55 °C, and aeration), the overall glucose and xylose yields were 91% and 52% compared to 96% and 54% after the treated corn stover was enzymatically hydrolyzed with 15 FPU g−1 and 60 FPU g−1 cellulose, respectively. They demonstrated that deacetylation and delignification remove the barriers to enzymatic saccharification and based on their results, long term pretreatment removed 87.5% of the lignin as well as almost all the acetyl groups in corn stover. Non-oxidative lime pretreatment of corn stover at various temperatures (25, 35, 45, and 55 °C) for periods of 16 weeks removed up to 44%, 46%, 48%, and 48% of the initial lignin, whereas oxidative lime pretreatment removed up to 58%, 66%, 81%, and 88% of the original lignin in corn stover, respectively. Regardless of the advantages of lime treatment, the duration of the long term treatment and the high energy requirement during the delignification process reduce its economical merit.122
Yang et al.115 investigated the results of alkaline pretreatment on the chemical compositions and enzymatic saccharification of rice straw using Na2CO3 at different temperatures and total titratable alkali (TTA) charge, respectively. The recovery of sugar from enzyme hydrolysis increases quickly with an increase of TTA from 0% to 8%, reaching from there the peak point. The maximum rates of sugar recovery for total sugar (72%), glucan (73%), and xylan (76%) were achieved when selecting the pretreatment conditions of 140 °C, 8% TTA charge and an enzyme loading of 20 FPU g−1-cellulose. In this case, 42% of the pretreated solid has the relevant delignification ratio, whereas 95 and 76% of glucan and xylan are conserved, respectively. The results of this research showed a significantly enhanced enzymatic digestibility of rice straw because of the good rate of delignification with Na2CO3 pretreatment. In another study, Kim et al.75 reported 70–85% delignification with 40–60% removal of hemicelluloses retaining more than 95% of the cellulose from corn stover which was pre-soaked overnight in 15% w/w ammonia followed by an ammonia recycle percolation (ARP) process at high temperature (170–210 °C) with 2.3 MPa pressure aiming higher enzymatic digestibility. A lengthier ARP process can trigger further delignification resulting in higher enzymatic digestibility. The enzymatic digestibility of ARP-treated corn stover yielded near-quantitative enzymatic digestibility at 60 FPU g−1 glucan and 92.5% digestibility at 10 FPU g−1 glucan. Banerjee et al.119 reported the combination of alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and ethanolic fermentation of corn stover. They pointed at several potential advantages of AHP pretreatment which includes low capital costs, ease of the process especially for large-scale production, and compatibility with enzymatic saccharification and fermentation. The pretreatment procedure was carried out at 0.125 g H2O2 loading per g of biomass, a temperature of 22 °C, 48 h of atmospheric pressure and periodic pH readjustment. The enzymatic saccharification was conducted in a similar reactor followed by the process of biomass slurry pH neutralization excluding the washing step. The highest yields of glucose and xylose (75% and 71% of the theoretical maximum) were obtained after 48 h reaction time. Although the network between lignin and cellulose or hemicellulose can be disturbed in alkaline pretreatment, a considerable portion of lignin may still be combined with cellulose even after pretreatment and may suppress cellulase enzymes in subsequent enzyme hydrolysis. Therefore before enzymatic hydrolysis, a neutralization step is necessary for the elimination of lignin and the inhibitors (furfural, phenolic acids, aldehyde, and salt).123


2.2.3 Supercritical carbon dioxide explosion. 
Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) explosion is a process that can also be employed for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. The primary results of this form of pretreatment are the explosion which affects the biomass structure and enhances the surface area and increases the exposure to further processing.124 A supercritical fluid is defined as a fluid in a gaseous state, yet it is compressed into a liquid-like form at temperatures above its critical point. CO2 is utilized as a supercritical fluid at relatively high pressure and low temperatures with a duration of several minutes. CO2 has a low critical temperature (31.1 °C) and its critical pressure is 1071 psi. SC-CO2 is considered as a green pretreatment procedure because CO2 is a non-toxic solvent. CO2 passing through the biomass material under high-pressure conditions leads to an increase in digestibility of biomass.10,72,125 Explosion pretreatment of the different lignocellulosic biomass by SC-CO2 has been investigated by many authors.77,78,126–129 Kim and Hong77 evaluated the SC-CO2 pretreatment of hardwood (aspen) and softwood (southern yellow pine) with different moisture contents ranging from 0 to 73% for the enzymatic digestibility of cellulose at pressures of 3100 and 4000 psi and temperatures ranging between 112 and 165 °C for periods of 10–60 min. The results of this research could elucidate the relationship between the moisture content and sugar yield. In samples containing no moisture, no significant difference was found in the yield of enzymatic hydrolysis, but in samples with moisture content at a fixed rate (73% humidity), the sugar yields in enzymatic digestibility of TRS were 84.7 ± 2.6 and 27.3 ± 3.8% (w/w) of the theoretical maximum for aspen and southern yellow pine, respectively. Zheng et al.78 treated some cellulosic raw materials such as Avicel, sugarcane bagasse, mixed recycled paper, and the re-pulping waste of recycled paper with SC-CO2 to significantly enhance the response of cellulose to enzymatic hydrolysis in order to increase the rate and the degree of cellulose hydrolysis. The cellulosic materials were placed in a reactor at 35 °C and 3000 psi for a controlled period. The higher the pressure the quicker the CO2 can penetrate inside the crystalline structure of materials and it causes higher yields of glucose after the CO2 explosion against untreated samples. Not only does this explosion pretreatment increase hydrolysis rates, but it also increases glucose yields up to 50% and the overall ethanol yield by 70%. Since SC-CO2 is operated at a low temperature, it may not begin the development of inhibitory substances that may be formed in the steam explosion. Narayanaswamy et al.126 reported the effectiveness of SC-CO2 pretreatment of corn stover and switchgrass at various temperatures (100, 120, and 150 °C) and pressures (2500, 3200 and 3500 psi) for lignocellulosic ethanol production by the combination of cellulase and β-glucosidase enzymes. The yields of glucose were increased when the pressure and temperature increased. The maximum yields of glucose (30 g per 100 g dry biomass) were obtained at 150 °C with 3500 psi after the corn stover (75% humidity content) was treated for 60 min. The glucose yields of untreated samples were reported to be 12%. They found that SC-CO2 pretreatment was not effective for switchgrass, possibly as a result of having more rigid cell walls compared to corn stover.
Similar to the research of Narayanaswamy et al.,126 the study performed by Gao et al.128 used SC-CO2 pretreatment with the combination of cellulase and β-glucosidase enzymes to enhance the sugar yield from rice straw. Rice straw was pretreated under operational conditions ranging from a pressure of 1450 to 4350 psi, and from a temperature of 40 to 110 °C, at a 1:1 g/g solid-to-liquid ratio, and periods of 15 to 45 min. With increases in pretreatment variables (pressure, temperature, and time) the enzyme hydrolysis yields of glucose have improved up to the highest value of 33% at 4350 psi and 110 °C for 30 min against 28% for untreated rice straw. The explanation taken is that after SC-CO2 pretreatment, the structure of rice straw became porous and visible cracks formed which facilitated the exposure of the fasciculi to both enzymes and attacks, therefore increasing the yields of hydrolysis. Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of rice straw prior to and after pretreatment. CO2 is considered as an inexpensive pretreatment solvent and non-toxic and physiologically safe substance. The advantages of CO2 pretreatment relate to using lower temperatures and also a higher volume of solids. Nevertheless, the significant costs and expenses of instruments which can be able to endure high-pressure conditions of CO2 pretreatment are major drawbacks to employing this technique on a large scale.72,77

2.2.4 Ionic liquids (ILs). 
The utilization of ILs as a new solvent-based pretreatment technique for lignocellulosic resources has gained considerable research interest over the years. ILs are a relatively new class of solvents often called as “green” and “designer” solvents. Having a melting point below 100 °C, non-flammability properties, good chemical and thermal stability, zero or negligible vapour pressure (P° ≈ 0), recyclability, and having hydrophobic and polar types are some of their advantages, nevertheless, they are considered as expensive solvents which may prohibit some of their applications. ILs are composed of organic cations such as alkylimidazolium, alkylpyridinium, alkylphosphonium or alkylammonium, coupled to various organic or inorganic anions such as methanesulfonate, tosylate, tetrafluoroborate, chloride, nitrate, and sulphate.72,130,131 In the process of IL pretreatment anions and cations have an important role in solubilizing the lignin and cellulose. Most of the ILs are recoverable and reusable.19 Brandt et al.80 investigated the effects of IL pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic saccharification on the release of glucose from lignocellulosic biomass (Miscanthus giganteus, pine (Pinus sylvestris) and willow (Salix viminalis)). The ionic liquid–water mixtures of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate, [C4C1im][MeSO4], and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, [C4C1im][HSO4], have been employed and found to be very effective when using them in a right concentration in the pretreatment process. After the pretreatment, the ionic liquid liquor consists of mostly the lignin and the hemicellulose and a solid fraction enriched in cellulose was obtained. The top hydrolysis yields were achieved when samples were pretreated with mixtures including 60–90 vol% ILs. Pretreatment with [C4C1im][MeSO4]90% resulted in the release of 92% of the glucose originally included in the biomass. Pretreatment with [C4C1im][MeSO4]80% and [C4C1im][MeSO4]60% resulted in the release of 89% and 87% of glucose according to the original glucan content. Glucose yields decreased if there was a higher or lower amount of ILs in the process. Hemicellulose yields were noticeably lower than glucose yields, regardless of the composition of the mixture. Wang et al.131 studied the activity of IL pretreatment prepared with one-step synthesis on yields of TRS of poplar and bamboo biomass after enzymatic saccharification. Different types of ILs such as 1-H-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Hmim]Cl), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidonium chloride ([Hnmp]Cl), and 1-H-pyridinium chloride ([Hpy]Cl) were synthesized. 61% and 60% lignin extraction yields were obtained by pretreatment of poplar with [Hnmp]Cl and [Hmim]Cl, respectively, whilst 52% and 50% yields of lignin were achieved through the pretreatment of bamboo using [Hpy]Cl and [Hnmp]Cl, respectively. [Hpy]Cl pretreatment of poplar resulted in high yields of glucose (68%), cellobiose (4%) and xylose (10%), and bamboo treated with [Hmim]Cl showed decent yields of glucose (66%), cellobiose (7%) and xylose (12%) after enzymatic digestibility, respectively. [Hmim]Cl, [Hpy]Cl, and [Hnmp]Cl were reported to be effective in the extraction of lignin and enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. Li et al.79 have compared the influence of acid and IL pretreatment on delignification, saccharification and saccharide yields of switchgrass. They showed that ILs are capable of removing higher amounts of lignin and lower quantities of hemicellulose compared to acid pretreatment. The IL pretreatment of switchgrass has shown the potential to increase the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis, resulting in a 16.7-fold enhancement in the cellulose yield, besides a glucan yield of 96% was achieved in 24 h. Dadi et al.132 have applied 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4mim]Cl) IL as a pretreatment solvent to disintegrate the structure of cellulose (Avicel-PH-101) to decrease its crystallinity and increase the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis. It was observed that in the case of regenerated cellulose, the rate of initial enzymatic saccharification (72%) was nearly 50 times higher compared with untreated cellulose (∼32%) after 12 hours. Apart from their special chemical features, the pretreatment technique using ILs still exhibits significant drawbacks and limitations such as being pricey and toxic to microorganisms and hydrolytic enzymes.19


2.2.5 Organosolv. 
The organosolvation process is regarded as one of the most promising lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment techniques which has received much attention. It has various inherent advantages including convenient restoring of solvents using simple distillation, recycling back the solvents to the process and re-use of the lignin obtained from the pretreatment procedure as a value-added by-product for different applications in industry. In this process, lignocellulosic materials generally undergo significant delignification and/or fibre porosity improvement in a pretreatment process using a mixture of inorganic acid catalysts, for example, HCl and H2SO4 with an organic or aqueous-organic solvent to break down the internal bonds between hemicellulose and lignin, thereby improving cellulose accessibility to subsequent hydrolysis. The wide variety of organic solvents often applied in the procedures are ethanol, methanol, acetone, glycerol, triethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, aqueous n-butanol, aqueous phenol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, etc. Organic acids including acetylsalicylic, oxalic and salicylic acids were also produced as catalysts in the organosolv procedure.72,133 Araque et al.81 reported the effects of organosolv pretreatment with acetone–water solution on the conversion of Pinus radiata D. Don to ethanol in the subsequent hydrolysis procedure. They reported that the optimal conditions for the highest ethanol yield (99.5%) were the temperature of 195 °C for 5 min reaction time, pH of 2 and the 1:1 acetone–water ratio. Amiri et al.82 reported the ethanol-organosolv pretreatment process of rice straw followed by enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation using Clostridium acetobutylicum bacterium to produce solvents such as acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE). The production yields of ABE along with ABE concentrations were enhanced by organosolv pretreatment without the requirement of detoxification. The maximum total sugar concentration (31 g L−1) after enzymatic hydrolysis was obtained using 75% (v/v) aqueous ethanol containing 1% w/w of H2SO4 at a temperature of 150 °C for a period of 1 h. But the highest concentration and productivity of ABE (10.5 g L−1 and 0.20 g L−1 h−1, respectively) were achieved from the straw pretreated at a temperature of 180 °C for 30 min reaction time. The highest overall production yields of ABE were found to be 80.3 g butanol, 21.1 g acetone, and 22.5 g ethanol, resulting from the fermentation of glucose (46.2%) achieved by enzymatic hydrolysis of samples pretreated at a temperature of 180 °C for a period of 30 min with a solid loading of 5%. Ebrahimi et al.134,135 have used glycerol and glycerol carbonate pretreatment followed by an enzyme hydrolysis procedure for the production of bioethanol from coconut coir and rice husk. The glucan digestibility rate increased significantly from 11.8% and 18.5% in untreated samples to 81.8% and 78.20% in pretreated coconut coir and rice husk with acidified aqueous glycerol and acidified glycerol carbonate, respectively. Although the organosolv pretreatment has some advantages including solvent recovery; nevertheless, there also lie some key disadvantages to the organosolv pretreatment. The high cost of most organic solvents and the need for a full solvent recovery are regarded as energy-intensive approach. Unrecovered solvents may cause the production of inhibitory compounds against the growth of microorganisms, enzymatic saccharification, and fermentation. Furthermore, due to the higher volatility and flammability of organic solvents, the pretreatment process needs to be conducted in highly restricted environments.19,72


2.2.6 Ozonolysis. 
Ozonolysis is a chemical pretreatment procedure wherein lignocellulosic materials are exposed to ozone (O3) gas as a powerful oxidizing agent. O3 typically reacts with lignin rather than carbohydrates, providing high delignification (≈80%) and promoting biomass de-structuration, therefore, increasing the biomass digestibility in a subsequent processing step. Ozonolysis pretreatment has the following advantages: it has mild operating environments including ambient temperature and normal atmospheric pressure, negligible or very low effects on carbohydrates, the absence of a liquid phase, no requirement of chemicals, and production of non-inhibitory compounds [furfural and HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural)]. The most fundamental parameters in the process of ozonolysis are the sample's moisture content, particle size, pH, the concentration of O3 in the gas flow and reaction time.72,136 The design of the reactor in ozonolysis pretreatment is among the most important factors since it controls the effective O3 concentration profile, which significantly influences the O3 utilization, reaction kinetics, and release of sugars, and it interacts with other factors in the process. The shape of the reactor needs to allow the highest possible interaction rate between the substrate and O3, in order to support maximum oxidation reaction. Different reactor designs are shown schematically in Fig. 7.136
 Fig. 7  Different designs of reactors employed in ozonolysis experiments: (a) batch reactor, (b) rotatory reactor, (c) Drechsel trap reactor, (d) cylindrical reactor, (e) bubble column reactor, (f) multi-layer fixed bed reactor and (g) fixed-bed reactor.

García-Cubero et al.83 reported an efficient ozonolysis pretreatment of wheat and rye straw in a fixed bed reactor to increase the rate of fermentable sugars up to 89% and 57% as compared to 29% and 16%, respectively, after enzymatic hydrolysis of non-ozonated wheat and rye straw. They have investigated the effects of different operating variables including the particle size, moisture content, O3 concentration, different types of biomass and the flow rate of air/O3. Using a fixed bed reactor, the moisture content and different types of biomass proved to be the most significant parameters influencing the ozonolysis process. The moisture content was the reaction controlling parameter, in which the reduction of the acid-insoluble lignin (AIL) content has happened when the moisture content increased up to 30%, but further moisturization did not provide any substantial benefit to the AIL content. Wheat straw hydrolyzes more easily than rye, even though the same amount of remaining lignin after the pretreatment was achieved for both samples. Travaini and co-workers84 examined the effects of ozonolysis pretreatment on sugarcane bagasse in a fixed bed reactor and studied the effectiveness of the two key factors: namely, the sample's moisture content and O3 concentration. They found that the ozonolysis pretreatment causes a significant increase in the release of fermentable carbohydrate during enzymatic hydrolysis. The increase in glucose and xylose yields from 7% to 42% and 2% to 52%, respectively, under the best experimental conditions for raw bagasse, was achieved. All the pretreated samples showed a decrease in AIL content, with a higher net reduction of 66.8% AIL, at an O3 concentration of 3.44% (v/v) with 40% moisture content (w/w) for an ozonolysis time of 120 min. They found only acetic, lactic, formic and xylitol acids as the oxidation products, with neither furfural nor HMF as inhibitory compounds. Although ozonolysis pretreatment has many advantages such as not forming any inhibitory compound over traditional methods, high operational costs due to requirements of large amounts of ozone are the main drawback of ozonolysis.136

2.3 Physicochemical pretreatment
The physicochemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is a combination of both physical and chemical treatment steps as an effective pretreatment method, aiming to convert lignocellulosic materials into monosaccharides by enhancing the removal of lignin components and increasing the efficiency of the hydrolysis process.137,138 Although this technique shows effective enhancement of the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose, it may produce degradation by-products such as furan derivatives, weak acids, and phenolic and inorganic substances that can inhibit the hydrolysis of sugar and fermentation process.139,140 Besides, this kind of pretreatment depends on the conditions and solvents used, which influence the biomass' physical and chemical properties.72

2.3.1 Steam explosion. 
The steam explosion pretreatment technique has been considered as an important research area for the past two decades, especially because of the resulting feedstock, which is much more amenable to enzymatic hydrolysis.13 In steam explosion technologies, lignocellulosic materials undergo a pretreatment process before hydrolysis with high-pressure saturated steam (0.69–4.83 MPa) and high temperature (up to 260 °C) for short periods (several seconds to a few minutes) followed by a sudden reduction of pressure by opening the steam which causes the materials to experience an explosive pressure relief by water molecules. This quick release of pressure results in the explosion of the lignocellulosic structure into split fibers. This procedure, therefore, leads to the degradation of hemicellulose and transformation of lignin due to high temperatures and increases cellulose hydrolysis ability. Hemicellulose can also undergo hydrolysis due to the release of acetic and other acids throughout steam-explosion pretreatment.10Fig. 8 shows the steam explosion equipment for lab-scale experiments.141

Several studies have been focused on the impact of steam explosion pretreatment on the hydrolysis and fermentation process.142–147 Huang et al.148 examined the effects of steam explosion pretreatment on the cell wall composition of two species of cotton stalks (Gossypium barbadense and Gossypium hirsutum). The cell wall characterization indicated that the steam explosion pretreatment of cotton stalks enhanced (5–6 fold) the enzymatic digestibility of the substrate by reducing the degree of polymerization of cellulose and extracting hemicelluloses. Steam explosion using dilute acids leads to the highest rates of sugar–ethanol conversion. In comparison, raw stalks pretreated using alkali with high concentration (16% NaOH) resulted in the highest biomass hydrolysis; nevertheless, at the same time they showed the lowest rates of sugar–ethanol conversion. Datar et al.149 performed the pretreatment of corn stover using a steam explosion process and reported its mesophilic fermentation for hydrogen production. The highest hydrogen yield was obtained from the liquid generated by steam treatment carried out for 3 min at 220 °C. They successfully demonstrated the suitability of steam explosion pretreatment techniques in hemicellulose-enriched hydrolyzate fractions to support hydrogen production through fermentation. Oliva et al.150 reported the effects of released compounds formed after the degradation process during the steam explosion of poplar biomass on the growth and alcoholic fermentation of the thermotolerant yeast strain (Kluyveromyces marxianus). The reported result revealed that the growth rate was influenced more than the production rate of ethanol and it indicated that this microorganism exhibits an important resistance to aromatic compounds. According to this study, harsh conditions during steam explosion pretreatment cause the formation of some inhibiting by-products (e.g. aromatic compounds, furfural and HMF) from the partial degradation of hemicelluloses which affects the enzymatic hydrolysis and the fermentation process and these can be the main drawbacks of steam explosion pretreatment.


2.3.2 Hydrothermolysis. 
Hydrothermolysis is a process in which pure water at elevated temperatures is used for the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials.151 In this pretreatment technique, water can penetrate the cell wall of the biomass, hydrating cellulose, solubilizing hemicellulose, and somewhat degrading lignin.6 As material fractionation is achieved using water and heating rather than a catalyst (e.g. acid or base), hydrothermolysis is considered as an environmentally friendly process; however, the hydrothermolysis process is carried out at high temperature and high pressure, resulting in an increase in energy consumption and process cost.152,153 Also, the hydrothermolysis process can handle biomass feedstock with high moisture content; therefore, it avoids the need for a dewatering step before treatment.153 Bobleter et al.151 in the early 1980s described the hydrothermolysis apparatus by using a reaction vessel enabled to hydrolyze biomass materials up to 100 g. They investigated the effects of process variables (temperature, rate of water flow and stirring) and optimum conditions on degradation of pure cellulose. They achieved up to 52% glucose and 10% 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) yields by hydrolyzing cellulose with pure water at 265 °C at a flow rate of 12 mL min−1. Hörmeyer et al.154 evaluated the influence of hydrothermolysis as a pretreatment for enzymatic saccharification of birch wood (Betula verrucosa Ehrh.). Air-dried birch wood chips were loaded inside the reaction vessel and percolated with deionized water at 3–5 MPa pressure and respective temperatures between 170 °C and 240 °C. They found that the yields for the conversion of pretreated cellulose by enzymes are strongly dependent on the flow rate and the reaction temperature. The highest sugar yield (80%) was achieved at 199 °C and a flow rate that was matched to a 0.7-fold water exchange rate of the reactor volume per minute. Ståhl et al.152 investigated the hydrothermolysis of pine wood at elevated temperatures (200, 220 and 240 °C). This pretreatment was conducted in a batch reactor with a 40:1 liquid-to-wood ratio. They discovered that up to 35% of native pine lignin was dissolved at 240 °C after a reaction time of less than 10 minutes, and the further reaction caused excessive condensation of the lignin and thus increased the amount of lignin in the wood residue. All hemicellulose was hydrolyzed at 200 °C with approximately 12.5% loss in the concomitant cellulose yield.


2.3.3 Wet oxidation (WO). 
Wet oxidation (WO) pretreatment is another form of an oxidative hydrothermal technique capable of treating the substance with water and air or oxygen at high temperatures (∼150–300 °C) and pressures (∼2–15 MPa). The presence of oxygen can maximize the reaction rates as well as the production of free radicals; however, using pure oxygen needs the consumption of large amounts of energy. Once the pretreatment of WO is applied to the process, it will influence all the lignocellulosic biomass structural components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). Cellulose crystallinity is decreased and partially degraded, hemicellulose is broadly broken into monosaccharides and further degraded into organic acids, and lignin undergoes both cleavage and oxidation. Thus, the accessibility of cellulose to biological attack as a result of removing lignin and hemicellulose is improved by WO pretreatment. WO pretreatment has advantages over alternative treatment technologies as it avoids the need for a dewatering step before treatment. Nevertheless, the unselective characteristic of all WO procedures bears the risk of substantial losses at the level of organic matter (e.g., hemicellulose).6,155,156 Schmidt and Thomsen157 studied the optimization of WO pretreatment for the fractionation of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin of wheat straw under alkaline conditions concerning oxygen pressure, reaction time and temperature as the key process variables. The optimal pretreatment process conditions were the temperature of 185 °C, oxygen pressure of 1.2 MPa and 15 min. Overall, the temperature was found to be a more significant factor than the other variables. The recovery of cellulose was substantially higher (95–100%), compared with the recovery of hemicellulose (60%). Palonen et al.158 examined the effectiveness of the WO process conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis of softwood (Picea abies). They analysed the compositions of solid and liquid fractions and evaluated different variable combinations (temperature, reaction time, and pH). After the WO process, the solid fraction was included cellulose (58–64%), hemicellulose (2–16%), and lignin (24–30%). The optimum WO pretreatment process conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis were the reaction time of 10 min at the temperature of 200 °C with the addition of 1.2 MPa oxygen pressure.
Lissens et al.159 treated organic domestic waste mixed with wheat straw by the WO pretreatment technique for monitoring enzymatic conversion and further bioethanol production via the fermentation process. The effects of oxygen pressure (0.3–1.2 MPa), temperature (185–195 °C) and sodium carbonate (0–2 g), as well as enzymatic convertibility of cellulose and hemicellulose, were considered at 10 min constant WO retention time. The enzymatic convertibility assay based on high loading of the enzyme molecules demonstrated that up to 78% and 68%, compared with 46% and 36%, of cellulose and hemicellulose of treated waste could be converted into hexose and pentose sugars in comparison to the raw waste. All WO pretreatment process conditions showed high total carbohydrate recoveries (>89%) and the initial lignin could be converted into non-toxic acids by 44–66%. Martín and Thomsen160 studied the effects of the WO pretreatment process on sugarcane bagasse, rice hulls, cassava stalks, and peanut shells. The WO pretreatment process was carried out at a temperature of 195 °C for 10 min, with 2 g kg−1 sodium carbonate using either 0.3 or 1.2 MPa oxygen pressure. They reported oxygen pressure and the type of utilized raw material as key factors on the material fractionation, sugar production, by-products, and cellulose enzyme convertibility. The WO pretreatment process improved the cellulose enzymatic convertibility, and the best result was obtained (670.2 g kg−1) with the maximum oxygen pressure in bagasse pretreated samples. Despite this, the WO pretreatment conditions for other samples have not been successful in achieving levels of conversion above 450 g kg−1. They concluded that the effects of the WO pretreatment process were reliant on the specific features of each investigated material.


2.3.4 Ammonia fibre/freeze explosion (AFEX). 
The process of the AFEX pretreatment technique is relatively comparable to the steam explosion method. In this method, lignocellulosic materials are subjected to aqueous ammonia loadings around 1:1 (kg/kg dry biomass) at elevated temperature (∼90–100 °C) for a reaction time, like 30 min, with subsequent swift reduction of the pressure which will disrupt the structural makeup of the biomass.161 The AFEX process had many adjustable parameters including ammonia and water loading, temperature, blowdown pressure, time, and the number of treatments. One of the advantages of AFEX pretreatment is that unlike many other pretreatment methods, AFEX does not release any types of inhibitory compounds during pretreatments, such as furfurals and phenolic acids. Additionally, the AFEX treatment is a dry-based method; therefore, it allows much higher loadings of solids in the fermentation procedure than do liquid phase treatments. Consequently, much higher product (e.g., ethanol) concentrations are potentially achievable in the final fermentation broth. AFEX is not ideal for high lignin content biomass; moreover, compared to dilute-acid pretreatment it does not solubilize hemicellulose to any great extent.161,162 Many research groups have recently explored a broad variety of conditions to establish the ideal requirements for ammonia pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass.10 Teymouri et al.163 investigated the optimal conditions of the pretreatment procedure and other factors, for example, ammonia loading, level of biomass moisture content, residence time, and temperature, to maximize the effects of the AFEX pretreatment on the enzymatic saccharification process of corn stover for the production of ethanol. They reported the optimum process parameters of AFEX for the highest enzymatic hydrolysis conversion rates of glucan and xylan (98% and 80%, respectively) and ethanol yields to be the temperature of 90 °C, 1 kg ammonia per kg of dry biomass loading (1:1 ratio), 60% moisture content (dry weight basis) and 5 min residence time. They reported that contrary to acid pretreatment, AFEX does not produce monomeric sugars and finally, based on their findings the pretreated corn stover showed more than 2 times increase in the yields of ethanol production in comparison to untreated corn stover in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) method. In further research, Teymouri et al.162 have investigated the effectiveness of AFEX pretreatment in the production of ethanol via the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of pretreated corn stover. The rate and the volume of both glucose and xylose in AFEX-treated samples were significantly higher than those in the control samples. All the pretreatment parameters (moisture content, temperature, treatment time, and ammonia loading) alter the reactivity of AFEX-treated biomass. Furthermore, the results of this research also indicate that AFEX pretreatment significantly improves biomass digestibility. Even at a very low level of enzyme activity (7 FPU g−1 glucan) the highest yields of glucose and xylose can be achieved. Alizadeh et al.164 reported a 2.5 times increase in the production of ethanol compared to untreated samples in the SSF process after AFEX pretreatment of switchgrass in a bench-top laboratory AFEX reactor (Fig. 9), using its main process parameters. The output yields were estimated at approximately 0.2 g of ethanol per g of dry biomass in the optimised AFEX pretreatment samples.

Murnen et al.165 investigated the effects of the AFEX pretreatment procedure as well as the enzymatic hydrolysis of Miscanthus x giganteus as a potential energy crop to produce fermentable sugars. In order to maximize hydrolysis yields, they tried different pretreatment parameters such as moisture, temperature, residence time, and ammonia and enzyme loadings. They reported that the optimum AFEX conditions for the highest conversions rates of glucan and xylan (approximately 96% and 81%, respectively) during enzymatic hydrolysis were the temperature of 160 °C for 5 min reaction time, the loading rate of 2:1 ammonia to biomass (w/w) and the moisture content of 233% (dry weight basis). They have also applied additional treatments, for example, soaking the biomass before AFEX (pre-AFEX soaking) as well as washing the AFEX-treated samples (post-AFEX washing) to enhance the yields of final sugar. Results indicated that pre-AFEX soaking of Miscanthus further improved the conversion of glucan by 10–15%, as compared to the un-soaked control. Based on the results of HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS/MS analyses, they have mentioned that more likely the post-AFEX washing steps were helpful to remove some of the degradation products (lignophenolics, oligosaccharides, organic acids, etc.).
Taken all together, the WO, hydrothermolysis, and steam explosion pretreatments are commonly used methods, but they are expensive and need to be improved to allow economic production of biofuels and chemicals.166 Therefore, among the physicochemical pretreatment techniques, plasma pretreatment could be an interesting alternative procedure. Plasma treatment is an eco-friendly surface modification technique that changes the outermost surface chemical composition, structure and morphology of different materials such as plastic,167,168 wood,169,170 metal,171,172 glass,173,174 and soil;175,176 also it has found its way into various applications in different types of fields such as in the environment,177,178 food,179–181 health,182–184 and agriculture185–187 for cleaning, coating, activation, etc.


2.3.5 Plasma pretreatment. 
The depolymerization of cellulose to value-added products is withstanding various challenges such as eliminating the lignin barrier. Cellulose is strongly hampered by its highly crystalline structure, which makes cellulose insoluble in common solvents (including water) and recalcitrant to hydrolysis. It is therefore important to chemically open and activate these valuable raw materials before any chemical processing can take place.188,189 As mentioned before, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin exist together in a highly resistant and complex structure, which is usually determined as lignocellulose. Nevertheless, this structure, and the lignin component, in particular, prevents fast cellulose depolymerization. To make cellulose available to enzymatic hydrolysis the need to interrupt the lignocellulosic complex requires the creation of an effective and economical pretreatment technique. While most of the pretreatment procedures undoubtedly lead to facilitate the catalytic depolymerisation of cellulose into the value-added products, their industrial transposition is hindered by the cost, corrosiveness, high energy consumption and toxicity of these decrystallization processes. The chemical industry is now pursuing advanced technologies that can boost cellulose hydrolysis across more effective paths.188
Plasma pretreatment of lignocellulose biomass has recently been developed as a novel pretreatment method that may become a feasible option for conventional pretreatment techniques. Plasma is a (positive and negative) ionized gas composed of charged particles, electronically excited atoms and molecules, radicals, and UV photons. Often it is called the fourth state of matter. Indeed, plasma is the most visible matter in the universe.190,191 It has a (dry) gas-phase cycle, which supports high chemical freedom as a result of partial gas ionization and induces both physical and chemical changes of the lignocellulosic biomass structure. The most important advantage of using a plasma technique is the absence of toxic and polluting substances, as plasma produces a highly reactive ionized gas by using only electrical energy which can be employed for a variety of purposes.2
Plasma pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass has been described lately by many authors.53,57,166,188,189,192–198 In most cases, the plasma techniques have been investigated as an innovative treatment technology to enhance the reactivity of the lignocellulosic complex matrix to render the recalcitrant cellulose for further hydrolysis processes through more efficient routes. In order to facilitate easier access to the cellulose material, Souza-Corrêa et al.57 used atmospheric O2 pressure plasma for the pretreatment of sugarcane-bagasse by degrading the lignocellulose structure through the delignification process. They have reported the linear increase in degradation of lignin and hemicellulose with ozonation time while the cellulose was unaffected. Approximately 80% delignification efficiency was reached within 6 h of treatment. Furthermore, 65% of cellulose content was converted into glucose by the enzymatic saccharification method. All findings support atmospheric O2 pressure plasma pretreatment as a promising method for the development of sugarcane-based cellulosic bioethanol. Song et al.189 described the conversion of cornstalk cellulose and hemicellulose to simple sugars using high-pressure non-equilibrium dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. The experiment was performed at a temperature of 80 °C for 120 min under 90 kPa atmospheric pressure at 1.30 L min−1 flux of N2 gas with a discharge gap width of 1.66 mm at 3.0 kV voltage in a parallel plate type reactor. The findings show that the cornstalk conversion rate was 76% under the above-mentioned conditions with a sugar selectivity of 32%. The monosaccharides (glucose, xylose, and mannose) derived from the experiment were reported to have been converted from cellulose and hemicellulose in the cornstalk, but lignin could not be converted into oligosaccharides. They have concluded that high-pressure nonequilibrium plasma application of agricultural residues is substantially different from conventional chemical, biological, and biochemical approaches.
In another research study, Benoit et al.188 used nonthermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP) treatment to promote the depolymerization of cellulose by facilitating the partial hydrolysis of useful polysaccharides in the subsequent aqueous hydrolysis process. They also demonstrated that the NTAP can be used as a highly effective pretreatment technique to improve the reactivity of recalcitrant polysaccharides, like microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and α-cellulose. The glucose showed a 60% improvement in hydrolysis yields after NTAP treatment compared to other pretreatment methods such as ionic liquid or ball-milling pretreatment. Kádár et al.192 investigated the effects of plasma-assisted pretreatment (PAP) on the removal of cutin and epicuticular waxes together with the degradation of lignin from wheat straw which resulted in an increase in the yield of subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis by 49% and, as a result, the highest ethanol concentration of 12.9 g l−1, which corresponded to 67% of the maximum theoretical ethanol yield of wheat straw, has been achieved. A similar study has been conducted by Schultz-Jensen et al.193 to investigate the effects of generated O3 in atmospheric pressure plasma and at room temperature to improve the enzyme hydrolysis and to produce more fermentable sugar as a result of lignin degradation in wheat straw. They have optimized process parameters such as the dry material content, milled particle size, flow rates and consumption of O3. They have developed a simple and relatively rapid pretreatment (0.5–2 h) technique, which provides the best results for dry matter contents between 45% and 60% with the optimum at 50%. In another research study, Schultz-Jensen et al.166 reported the production of ethanol from wheat straw using atmospheric pressure plasma. They have found that 95% of lignin was degraded in the ozonisation process; however, cellulose and hemicellulose remained untouched. They reported that the optimum conditions for maximum ethanol production (52%) were found to be 1 hour of ozonisation. Up to 78% of the glucose found in the cellulose can be released enzymatically and subsequently converted into ethanol. The influence of the sugarcane particle size and moisture content pretreated with ozone through atmospheric O2 pressure plasma on the effectiveness of the delignification process was investigated in two separate research studies by Souza-Corrêa et al.53,57 The obtained outcomes presented that the optimized particle size (0.08 mm) resulted in a conversion rate of 79% cellulose to glucose when the moisture content was kept constant at 50%. The result of the other study has revealed the significant effects of moisture quantity on the delignification efficiency (approximately 80%) and saccharification of bagasse following ozonation pretreatment, whereby a conversion rate of 65% was achieved after 6 h of treatment at a moisture level of 50%. The combination of microwaves and atmospheric pressure plasma (Fig. 10) for the pretreatment of sugarcane biomass in the so-called air–water ‘tornado’-type microwave plasma with an operating radiation frequency of 2.45 GHz was recently reported.194 Sugarcane bagasse under wet and dry conditions (∼2 g) was subjected to the late afterglow plasma jet under various pretreatment process conditions such as the diverse periods of exposure, distances, power of microwaves supplied to the launcher and numerous background gas compositions. The authors have mentioned that the plasma treatment is planned to provide several long-lived active species to eliminate the lignin wrap and hemicellulose complex, and to strip the cellulose fibres, which have also been verified by FT-IR sample analysis. Oxygen-containing reactive species (singlet O2(a1Δg) delta molecules, OH radicals, HNO2 and NO2), which were found in the afterglow of plasma flow, have a considerable role in the treatment process by breaking down the C–C bonds and providing the free C atoms to create additional functional groups. By using air–water mixtures as a gas source for boosting plasma reactivity, the plasma performance can be increased by increasing the moisture content of the treated sample (2 g of dry biomass combined with 2 g of water). The following operational parameters can lead to the optimal conditions for biomass pretreatment; 400–500 W microwave power, 1000–2000 sccm air–water flux, 6.5–7.5 cm distances, and 2–5 min exposure time.

Gao et al.195 studied the effects of plasma electrolysis as a pretreatment technique on the rate of the enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse. They reported that the production of a large number of active particles, such as HO˙ and H2O2, causes the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass lignin (lignin contents decreased to 18%) and reduces the crystalline index, leading to sugar yield growth of 126.5% as compared with unpretreated samples. Ravindran et al.196 created a novel pretreatment technique by combining two methods, namely, atmospheric air plasma and ferric chloride to investigate the effects of this superior pretreatment procedure on the production of bioethanol from spent coffee waste. The composition analysis of the pretreated biomass showed extensive delignification amounts when the plasma process conditions of 2 min treatment at a voltage of 70 kV in an acidic environment containing 1% H2SO4 were followed. The plasma pretreated biomass yielded 0.496 g of reducing sugar per g after enzymatic hydrolysis which is ascribed to 18.6 g L−1 ethanol production once the hydrolysate was fermented in the presence of S. cerevisiae. The 74% fermentation efficiency represented a two-fold increase in the yields of bioethanol produced as compared with the raw material. In another research study conducted by Ravindran et al.,197 they have studied the effectiveness of atmospheric air plasma using DBD plasma as a pretreatment approach to improve the enzymatic hydrolysis of brewer's spent grain and the following bioethanol production. They have examined the effects of different parameters such as voltages (22 kV, 25 kV and 28 kV), solvents (acid, alkali, and water) and times (5, 10, 15 min). The optimal pretreatment process conditions were achieved when using water as a solvent, followed by an irradiation period of 10 min at a voltage of 28 kV. The total lignin content in the pretreated samples using a water solvent had a 36% decrease compared to that in the other samples, which resulted in a 2.14-fold enhancement in the yield of reducing sugar obtained after the enzymatic hydrolysis. Shaghaleh et al.198 performed the pretreatment of wheat straw using atmospheric pressure plasma pretreatment and reported the effects of using various gases (air, N2 and CO2) and duration of plasma treatment on the chemical composition (sugar yield) and structural features of wheat straw, after the process of enzymatic hydrolysis. The chemical composition, structural properties, enzymatic digestibility, mass and sugar recovery of wheat straw were influenced by the gas type and length of plasma treatment. The plasma pretreatment under optimum conditions (air as gas for 90 s with 60% dry matter) resulted in high conversion yields of glucan (90%) and xylan (69%), and a very high yield of biomass/sugar recovery (84%) after the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis (358.4 mg glucose per g and 135.8 mg xylose per g). Furthermore, they have also indicated that for obtaining the maximum yields of glucose, the duration of plasma pretreatment should not be more than 90 s.
Considering the ease of the plasma pretreatment compared to the rest of the pretreatment methods, it is expected to see more varieties of lignocellulosic biomass from different sources undergo this treatment to examine the effects of different plasma variables on the delignification efficiency and subsequent hydrolysis procedure.

2.4 Biological pretreatment
Unlike the physical, chemical or physicochemical pretreatment procedures, the biological pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is assumed to be the eco-friendliest technique with mild environmental conditions and low capital and does not require high energy, therefore, has low operational cost.7,199 Nevertheless, and demonstrating the scientific need to verify common-sense perceptions, the fungal pretreatment resulted in carbohydrate loss, therefore, it is required to utilize the relevant type of fungal strain/biomass combination.199 Biological pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is mostly used to degrade the hemicellulose and lignin, or for removal of specific components, for example, anti-microbial materials via microbial oxidation of the substrate.2,200,201 During this process, lignin and hemicelluloses are eliminated from waste materials by various microorganisms such as brown, white, and soft-rot fungi; however, the rate of degradation using this technique is usually very slow. Brown-rot fungi often target cellulose, while white- and soft-rot fungi target both cellulose and lignin. The degradation of lignin by white-rot strains happens over the action of lignin-degrading enzymes such as peroxidases and laccase.10 Saha et al.199 studied the feasibility of using white-rot fungal pretreatment of corn stover to improve the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. They evaluated 26 strains, among which are Cyathus stercoreus, Pycnoporus sanguineus, Phlebia brevispora, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Coprinus stercoreus, under solid-state cultivation at a moisture content of 74% at a temperature of 28 °C for 30 days. The Cya. stercoreus strain showed the best result, with a sugar yield of 394 ± 13 mg g−1 pretreated stover, followed by Pyc. sanguineus (393 ± 17 mg g−1) and Phl. brevispora (383 ± 13 mg g−1). The range of weight loss recorded was between the lowest at 9.8 ± 0.1% and the maximum at 52.8 ± 1.3% using Coprinus sp. and Pha. chrysosporium, respectively. Castoldi et al.140 reported the effects of biological pretreatment of five white-rot fungi species, including Ganoderma lucidum, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus pulmonarius and Trametes on Eucalyptus grandis sawdust. The pretreatment caused a structural change (Fig. 11) along with selective degradation of lignin by P. ostreatus and P. pulmonarius in the sawdust fibres, facilitating the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and resulting in a 20-fold increase in reducing sugars. Lee et al.202 also reported the results of biological pretreatment on the Pinus densiflora species (Japanese red pine), following exposure to different strains of white-rot fungi namely: Ceriporia lacerata, Stereum hirsutum, and Polyporus brumalis. The fungus S. hirsutum was able to selectively degrade lignin instead of the holocellulose (hemicellulose and cellulose) component resulting in less recalcitrant biomass after a pretreatment period of 8 weeks. The highest yield of sugar (21%) was obtained when S. hirsutum was involved in a saccharification process of softwood for 72 h at 50 °C. Glucose with 13.6% was the most abundantly generated sugar in all the cases followed by 3.3% and 2.8% for xylose and mannose, respectively, showing that hemicellulose was also amenable to enzyme hydrolysis.

Schilling et al.203 investigated the effects of using brown-rot fungi (Gloeophyllum trabeum and Postia placenta) species to degrade lignocellulosic materials (aspen, spruce, or corn stover) over a period of 16 weeks before saccharification with cellulases. Overall, the pretreatment using brown-rot fungi enhanced the sugar saccharification yield up to 3-fold, and it was notable that G. trabeum pretreatment of aspen for 2 weeks gave the best yields (i.e. 72% glucose). In another research study conducted by Monrroy et al.,204 the effects of biological pretreatment using two brown-rot fungi (Gloephylum trabeum and Laetoporeus sulphureus) varieties on different types of wood chips (Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus) have been reported. After biodegradation for eight weeks, the highest loss of weight and hemicellulose for P. radiata with G. trabeum was 13% and 31%, respectively. The sharp decrease in the degree of cellulose polymerization varying from 58% to 79% was found to be similar in both brown-rot fungi. G. trabeum depolymerized cellulose more quickly than L. sulphureus in all wood forms. They reported a decrease in the crystallinity index between 6% and 21% calculated by infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Decreasing the degree of polymerization and the crystallinity index and eliminating hemicellulose lead to improved enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency. Ray et al.205 also applied two strains of brown-rot fungi (Coniophora puteana and Postia placenta) as a biological pretreatment to degrade Pinus radiata sapwood. The highest release of glucose (70%) as a result of the enzymatic saccharification achieved approximately 15 days after exposure to C. puteana at only 9% of wood mass loss. Mutschlechner et al.206 studied the effects of using the soft-rot ascomycetal fungus (Trichoderma viride) in an anaerobic upstream process before anaerobic digestion. The soft-rot fungal species produces a wide range of carbohydrate-active enzymes (including cellulase, hemicellulases, pectinases) and has a high genetic diversity.207 The results of this research indicate significant increases in the total gas and methane yields up to 3-fold due to improvement in nutrient availability.206 Overall, these results underline the potential for use of this specific group of fungi in the bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass, but in most biological pretreatment processes the rate of hydrolysis is very small.10
Most of the traditional pretreatment techniques need high temperatures, pressures, and energy usage and are costly. Thus, because of these limitations, and regardless of the current developments in pretreatment and hydrolytic techniques, there is a continuing need for developing enhanced methods, equipment and systems for the conversion of cellulosic materials to sugars and subsequent hydrolysis of sugars into alcohols and other chemical substances.208 Several studies have shown that a combined pretreatment technique is more effective when compared to other pretreatment procedures (e.g., chemical or biological) alone.46,47
2.5 Various combinations of pretreatment techniques
Researchers are increasingly more interested in developing low cost, efficient, and environmentally friendly pretreatment techniques. However, not all pretreatment methods achieve these goals to the same extent. In addition, although significant achievements have been obtained, particularly in newer technologies such as plasma pretreatment, our current understanding is still low and there has not been much research to ensure which method of pretreatment is the reliable alternative. Therefore, to overcome the current shortcomings of each pretreatment technique, a combination of two or three procedures could be useful. Some of the different types of pretreatment procedures are summarized in Table 3, adapted from ref. 72.

Some of the combined pretreatment methods are like: physical and chemical (planetary milling and organosolv,209 dilute sulfuric acid and chemical-assisted mechanical,210 ozonolysis and ball milling60), physical and biological (fungal and milling pretreatment211), chemical and chemical (dilute sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide,212 sodium hydroxide and ionic liquid213,214), chemical and physicochemical (dilute sulfuric acid and steam explosion,215 steam explosion and hydrogen peroxide216), biological and chemical (white/brown-rot fungi and mild acid,217 white-rot fungi and dilute sulfuric acid,41 white-rot fungi and sodium hydroxide,218 white-rot fungi and hydrogen peroxide219), and biological and physicochemical (white-rot fungi and steam explosion220).
Park et al.209 investigated the effects of using combined physical and chemical pretreatment methods to maximize the enzymatic digestibility of herbaceous biomass (corn stover and wheat straw) glucose, as well as using a high concentration of ethanol as a solvent which is needed to allow the reusability and recycling of the solvent. When using ethanol with 99.5% concentration at a temperature of 190 °C for 120 min the digestion rates were 69% (using corn stover) and 77% (using wheat straw) compared to using 60% ethanol which resulted in 93 and 87% under the same conditions, respectively. This outcome demonstrates that the use of high concentrations of ethanol as a solvent is limited. Therefore, mechanical pretreatment (planetary milling) has been used prior to the chemical pretreatment to overcome this limitation. As a result, glucose digestibility increased significantly compared to chemical pretreatment alone. Moreover, the effect of the biomass particle size has also been examined and the results showed that very small particles (due to physical pretreatment) had much higher enzymatic digestibility compared to untreated biomass. Liu et al.210 studied the effects of mixed pretreatment techniques consisting of dilute acid pre-extraction and chemical-assisted mechanical refining to pretreat poplar (triploid Populus tomentosa) wood chips for subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. The dilute acid pre-extraction was operated in a 6 L M/K digester (M/K Systems Inc., USA) using dilute sulfuric acid. The pre-extracted wood chips were refined in a chemical-assisted mechanical process in a water bath at 80 °C for 30 min in a polyethylene bag with a mixed solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphite. Subsequently, the two-stage refining was conducted in a defibrator (model D, Vrena Mek Co., Sweden) for pressurized refining followed by twice processing in a KRK high-consistency disk refiner (model 2500-II, Kumagai Riki Kogyo Co. Ltd., Japan) to achieve separated pulp fibres. The findings of this research revealed a 106% rise in the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of pulp substrates after the dilute acid pre-extraction (SF of 3.07) stage compared to the rate of untreated materials, and a glucose conversion yield of 93% plus a glucose concentration of 21.4 g L−1 has been obtained. The results of this research represented the significant enhancement of the enzymatic hydrolysis as a result of the combined pretreatment.
Shi et al.60 reported the effects of two pretreatment procedures namely ozonolysis and planetary ball milling (separately and in combination) to promote the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn straw. When combined, ozonolysis–ball milling and ball milling–ozonolysis pretreatment made the enzymatic hydrolysis more efficient compared to when they were applied separately. Besides, the loading of cellulase has decreased dramatically to just 10% compared to the untreated raw material. These findings indicate that the combination of ozonolysis and ball milling can be considered as a promising technique for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. In another study, the combination of biological pretreatment with Pleurotus ostreatus fungus and physical pretreatment (milling to ≤2 mm) of rice straw has been reported by Mustafa et al.211 The effects of milling and incubation time (10, 20 and 30 d), on the degradation of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose through fungal pretreatment and the rate of biogas production in the anaerobic digestion were evaluated by comparison with the untreated substance. They have reported that both the incubation time and milling had significant impacts on both lignin removal during fungal pretreatment and the methane yield during digestion. Fig. 12 explains the relationships between the degradation of lignin and the yield of ultimate methane during three separate pretreatment processes. Compared to no treatment the methane yield increased significantly from 92% to 165% with posterior milling at 30 days of incubation.

Camesasca et al.212 evaluated the combination of dilute sulfuric acid and alkaline (sodium hydroxide) pretreatment of napiergrass for fuel ethanol production. This combination was effective for the removal of xylan and lignin, resulting in high cellulose contents in the solid which can be hydrolysed and fermented to ethanol. Kassaye et al.213 investigated the effect of the pretreatment steps (alkaline and ionic liquid) on the properties of the original bamboo biomass. In their study, sodium hydroxide solution was capable of removing lignin and hemicellulose. However, the mild conditions of alkaline pretreatment alone have a limited effect on the biomass, therefore, it did not remove the structural complexity of bamboo biomass caused by the recalcitrant behaviour of the cellulose portion. To overcome this limitation, they have used ionic liquid pretreatment to reduce the crystallinity of the recovered cellulosic biomass. The obtained results showed a 64% rise in the yield of total reducing sugars after the pretreatment of bamboo biomass with sodium hydroxide compared to only 30% yield of reducing sugar in the unrefined samples. Overall, the two-step pretreatment has overcome two main challenges faced in the catalytic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass into sugars and resulted in an 80% increase in the total yield of reducing sugar.
Zoulikha et al.215 studied the impact of combined dilute-acid and hydrothermal pretreatment (dilute sulfuric acid and steam explosion) on enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw. They have optimized the process conditions (133–165 °C processing temperature, 5–40 min residence time and 0.70–2.20% sulfuric acid concentration) using a full-factorial design. The monomeric glucose and xylose were the response parameters of the experimental design. The outcome of this research revealed that the concentration of sulfuric acid followed by temperature and processing time was the most influential factor in biomass bioconversion. The optimal values were the processing temperature of 165 °C, the residence time of 40 min and 2.2% acid concentration. The extreme conditions of the pretreatment caused the structure of the biomass to be less dense and disrupted, contributing to a large surface area. Therefore, increasing the specific surface area had a significant effect on the accessibility of enzymes to cellulose active sites of wheat straw, which has increased the rate and yields of bioconversion.
The effect of combined steam explosion pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide on lignocellulosic agricultural wastes (sugarcane bagasse) for production of bioethanol has been investigated by Verardi et al.216 The pretreatment combination has resulted in selective breaking of bonds within lignin by the oxidation mechanism, increasing the lignin degradation to an appreciable extent. The greater degree of lignin degradation allowed higher accessibility of hydrolytic enzymes to hemicellulose and cellulose surfaces, therefore, higher concentrations of fermentable sugars after the enzymatic saccharification were obtained. The average yield was increased by 12% for glucose and as high as 34% for xylose. Martínez-Patiño et al.41 has employed the combination of chemical (dilute sulfuric acid) and biochemical (white-rot fungi) pretreatment methods as the best approach which is more effective than either method used alone to significantly enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of olive tree biomass. It was also observed that the order of the pretreatment combination has a relevant effect on the glucose yield of the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. The optimized pretreatment conditions were the fungal pretreatment with I. lacteus after 28 days of culture followed by mild acid pretreatment (2% w/v H2SO4, 130 °C and 90 min), which have enhanced the yield of enzymatic hydrolysis by 34% compared with the acid pretreatment alone. Under the best pretreatment conditions, the overall sugar yield of the whole process was 51% of the theoretical yield along with 40% glucose recovery.
In another study, Alexandropoulou et al.218 combined biological pretreatment with alkaline treatment to evaluate the effect of lignocellulosic biomass fractionation and biochemical methane potential (BMP). Two white-rot fungi strains (Leiotrametes menziesii and Abortiporus biennis) and sodium hydroxide as the alkali pretreatment were used for enhancing biogas production from willow sawdust. Combined alkali and fungi pretreatment led to high degradation of lignin for both fungi, whilst the removal efficacies of cellulose and hemicellulose were better for the combination of alkali and L. menziesii. The highest BMP was achieved when alkali and A. biennis were combined and the rate was 12.5 and 50% higher than that of the separate alkali and fungi pretreatment alone plus it was also 115% higher than the respective BMP of the untreated substance. Li et al.220 conducted the combination of biological (white-rot fungi) and physicochemical (steam explosion) pretreatment and evaluated the synergistic mechanism of these combined techniques in terms of the pore size distribution, crystallinity index, chemical composition and enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stalk. Their findings demonstrated that the rigid structure of corn stalk has been destroyed by steam explosion pretreatment and it has also caused an increase in the porosity and pore size of corn stalk materials which leads to the higher exposure of the crystalline component of cellulose. Breaking the complex lignin–carbohydrate structure of lignocellulosic biomass facilitated the subsequent biological treatment. As a result, a 2.9 and 1.3 times higher yield of enzymatic hydrolysis was obtained compared to those of untreated corn stalk and treated only with the steam explosion pretreatment method, respectively.
3.0 Conclusions and future perspectives
The dramatic increase in the world population and its associated environmental problems have aroused a vast concern to find alternative resources for the production of chemicals and energy. Lignocellulosic materials which represent a large variety of dry plant matter, i.e. biomass, constitute the most significant amount in the class of sustainable carbon materials and are considered as one of the promising renewable resources to produce various types of biofuels and biochemicals. One of the biggest challenges involved with lignocellulosic resources is being resistant to harsh conditions such as chemical decomposition. Although pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is necessary to alter the physical and chemical properties of the raw material, it is considered a costly process. The biomass pretreatment procedure can constitute more than 40% of the total cost of processing, and degradation of lignocellulose materials via the saccharification process with no pretreatment step may lead to total sugar yields below 20%, whereas the total sugar yield in the same procedure with some pretreatment methods can reach up to 0–90%.52 The complex lignocellulosic structure protects cellulose from enzymatic and chemical deconstruction. To access the cellulose within the complex lignocellulosic structure, it is essential to employ appropriate pretreatment processes to lower the cellulose crystallinity, increase the materials' surface area, eliminate hemicellulose, and breakdown the lignin seal. Several pretreatment technologies (comminution, alkaline or acid pretreatment, organosolv, etc.) have been developed with their merits and demerits for the fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass into its constituents. However, so far, no specific optimal pretreatment procedure for lignocellulosic biomass has been discovered. Physical pretreatment such as comminution results in improved cellulose reactivity for subsequent biochemical conversion by reducing the particle size, depolymerization, and lowering of its crystallinity, yet this kind of treatment is not capable of removing lignin. Therefore, lignin can still act as a barrier for the subsequent processing step and limit the access to cellulose. Chemical pretreatment, like using a solvent or a combination of reagents, simplifies the conversion of lignocellulose materials. Nevertheless, it might have drawbacks or weaknesses, including the corrosiveness of acids and bases, handling, and recovery phases after pretreatment to make the pretreatment procedures economically achievable. Physicochemical pretreatment such as WO, hydrothermolysis, and steam explosion is aiming to convert lignocellulosic materials into monosaccharides by improving the removal of lignin and increasing the efficiency of the hydrolysis process. However, it is costly and needs various enhancements to reach the economically feasible level to produce biofuels and chemicals. Biological pretreatment is often known to be one of the most environmentally friendly technologies with mild environmental impacts and low resource costs. However, in most biological pretreatment processes, the rate of hydrolysis is very low. Thus, given these shortcomings, and regardless of the recent advances in pretreatment, there is a continuous need for developing enhanced methods, equipment, and systems for pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials. Although significant achievements have been obtained in each of the pretreatment methods, especially in newer technologies such as plasma pretreatment, most traditional methods require high temperatures, pressures, and energy. Therefore, owing to these restrictions, there is still room to overcome the existing limitations and drawbacks of each pretreatment technique. It will be valuable to investigate the effects of combining two or even three pretreatment procedures such as the combination of plasma pretreatment as one of the advanced green technologies with other eco-friendly systems with moderate or no environmental effects. For example, different biological pretreatments can be used to compare the rates and the degrees of cellulose hydrolysis among the individual processing steps or different combinations of them.

Physical pretreatment	Comminution	Low	High	Increase of accessible surface area, eco-friendly (does not depend on using chemicals); increases surface area and reduces cellulose crystallinity	Energy-intensive procedure, not capable of altering or solubilizing lignin structure
Chemical pretreatment	Acid pretreatment	High	High	Increase of accessible surface area, solubilization of hemicellulose; alters the lignin structure	Corrosive, hazardous, and toxic, needs equipment that is resistant to corrosion, needs a neutralization step to remove acids from substances
Alkaline pretreatment	High	Nil	Increase of accessible surface area and porosity, selectivity for breaking down the lignin structure without degrading carbohydrates	A considerable portion of lignin may still be combined with cellulose even after pretreatment and may suppress cellulase enzymes in subsequent enzyme hydrolysis. Needs a neutralization step to eliminate lignin and the inhibitors
Supercritical carbon dioxide explosion	High	High	Increase of accessible surface area, green pretreatment procedure because CO2 is a non-toxic solvent, increase in digestibility of biomass	Costs and expenses of instruments which can be able to endure high-pressure conditions of pretreatment, not capable of altering or solubilizing the lignin structure
Ionic liquids (ILs)	High or low	—	Increase of accessible surface area, reduces cellulose crystallinity, non-flammability properties, good chemical and thermal stability, most of the ILs are recoverable and reusable	Pricey and toxic to microorganisms and hydrolytic enzymes
Organosolv	High	High	Increase of accessible surface area, hydrolyses hemicelluloses, convenient restoring of solvents using simple distillation, recycling back the solvents to the process, significant delignification	Pricey, unrecovered solvents may cause the production of inhibitory compounds, due to the higher volatility and flammability of the organic solvents the pretreatment process needs to be conducted in highly restricted environments
Ozonolysis	High	High	Increase of accessible surface area, solubilization of hemicellulose, altering or solubilizing the lignin structure, production of non-inhibitory compounds	High operational costs due to requirements of large amounts of ozone
Physicochemical pretreatment	Steam explosion	High	High	Increase of accessible surface area and porosity, solubilization of hemicellulose, altering or solubilizing the lignin structure	Formation of some inhibiting by-products (e.g. aromatic compounds, furfural and HMF)
Hydrothermolysis	High or low	High	Increase of accessible surface area, hydrating cellulose, solubilization of hemicellulose, and somewhat degrading lignin, environmentally friendly process, handles biomass feedstock with high moisture content (avoids the need for a dewatering step before treatment)	The process is carried out at high temperature and high pressure, resulting in an increase in energy consumption and process cost
Wet oxidation (WO)	High or low	High	Increase of accessible surface area, avoids the need for a dewatering step before treatment, solubilization of hemicelluloses and lignin, low temperature process	Consumption of large amounts of energy due to using pure oxygen, the unselective characteristic of all WO procedures bears the risk of substantial losses at the level of organic matter (e.g., hemicellulose)
Ammonia fibre/freeze explosion (AFEX)	High	High	Increase of accessible surface area, reduces cellulose crystallinity, capable of altering and solubilizing the lignin structure, it allows much higher loadings of solids in the fermentation procedure due to being a dry-based method	Not ideal for high lignin content biomass, moreover, compared to dilute acid pretreatment it does not solubilize hemicellulose to any great extent
Plasma pretreatment	High	High	Increase of accessible surface area, absence of toxic and polluting substances, considered as a low-temperature pretreatment process, reduces cellulose crystallinity, destruction of the hemicellulose complex, significant delignification	Plasma pretreatment's energy conservation and economic sustainability have yet to be fully piloted, low reaction control
Biological pretreatment	Fungi pretreatment	Low	—	Increase of accessible surface area, solubilization of hemicellulose; altering and solubilizing the lignin structure, the eco-friendliest technique with mild environmental conditions, does not require high energy resulting in low operational cost	The pretreatment results in carbohydrate loss, therefore, it is required to utilize the relevant type of fungal strain/biomass combination, low rate of hydrolysis
