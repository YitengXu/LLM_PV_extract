    , Accepted 2nd March 2017First published on 3rd March 2017AbstractThe development of sustainable polymeric photo-catalytic systems for the conversion of solar energy is an important issue. In this perspective, efficient photo-catalytic systems have been developed by many research groups; however, their long-term stability or sustainability is still challenging and need to be resolved. In order to realize sustainable polymeric photoactive systems, we developed terpyridine (tpy)-based polymers and their ruthenium complexes, which were reversibly assembled and disassembled through metal ion–ligand interactions. In the presence of metal ions, Ru-based photoactive polymers were assembled on tpy-coated ITO substrates, generating visible-light induced photocurrents. Subsequently, when disassembled by the introduction of tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride, the assembled polymeric complex decomposed, decreasing the photocurrent. However, the photocurrent efficiency of this system was recovered through re-assembly and repeated several times without a significant decrease in its efficiency. In addition, a sustainable photo-catalyst system was achieved by photo-oxidative coupling with benzylamine. The initial active photo-catalytic system became inactive after disassembly; however, its activity was restored through assembly again, and this process was repeated successfully several times. The self-assembly via reversible metal ion–ligand interaction would enable photo-catalytic systems to be self-repairable and sustainable.
1. Introduction
Plants in nature constantly obtain chemical energy from solar energy (i.e., photosynthesis) for maintaining their in vivo metabolism.1 Because solar energy is considered to be a key component in utilizing environment-friendly energy conversion, many researchers have developed artificial photo-active materials (polymers, nanostructures, and small molecules),2,3 exhibiting high solar energy conversion and catalytic activity, and these photo-active materials have been rapidly applied in pollutant removal,4,5 green chemistry,6,7 solar cells,8 and solar fuels.9 Although significant development of photo-active materials has been achieved, their commercialization still remains a problem and needs to be solved, especially in organic photo-active materials. The organic photo-active complexes generally have low stability and short lifetime, because of their decomposition by oxygen, water, and other conditions under illumination.10,11 Enhancement in stability is one of the important issues to be addressed for commercialization; however, it still remains a challenge in spite of significant efforts.12–14
Nature's photosystems, consisting of “organic” materials (i.e., proteins and coenzymes), carry out photosynthesis without failure even under very high illumination of UV light. Interestingly, protein complexes in photosystems undergo oxidative damage because of excess light. However, the photo-inactivated protein complexes or photo-damaged components (D1 protein) in the reaction center are rapidly degraded and re-assembled,15,16 and this self-repair mechanism of photo-active proteins enables constant energy harvesting under excess light. If such biomimetic self-repair mechanism can be introduced in artificial photo-active materials, their stability can be significantly improved.
Terpyridine (tpy) ligands have been used to fabricate self-healing materials with metal ion–ligand interaction.17,18 They can reversibly bind to metal ions (e.g., Fe2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Mg2+, etc.), and these metals are easily removed by the addition of stronger ligands such as ethylenediamine tetraacetates (EDTAs) and halides.19–21 Tpy-functionalized polymers, nanostructures, and small molecules have been developed and applied as catalysts,22 self-repairing materials,17 and optoelectronic materials.23 For example, Collomb and coworkers synthesized bimetallic self-assembled coordination polymers based on [Ru(bpy)3]2+ units connected to bis-tpy ligands.24 Interestingly, the bimetallic films with Ru(II)–Fe(II) exhibited a photo-induced electron transfer cycling process over Fe2+/Fe3+ and Ru2+/Ru3+ oxidations.24,25 Li and coworkers synthesized self-healing polypyrrole/Zn–tpy hybrid gels by incorporating Zn–tpy supramolecules, which are mechanically and electrically self-healing at room temperature without external stimulus due to assembly or disassembly of metal–tpy supramolecules.26 Tieke and coworkers also synthesized organized double-electrochromic films consisting of electrochromic tpy-substituted polyiminofluorene bound to Zn forming a Zn–bis-tpy complex, and thus improved the electrochromic properties.27 In addition, they synthesized organized electrochromic films of tpy-substituted polyaniline derivatives by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly with metal-ion complexes.28 Burnworth and coworkers synthesized photohealable metallosupramolecular polymers and they attributed their photothermally induced healing to metal–ligand complex formation. Those supramolecular healing systems seem to be applicable to any supramolecular polymer.29 In this study, we envisioned that the reversible metal ion–tpy interaction is suitable for developing biomimetic repairable polymer systems through programmed assembly and disassembly. Many research groups have developed separately efficient photo-catalytic systems or self-healing materials. In our systems, we envisaged that regenerative photoactive polymer systems could be successfully achieved through metal–tpy interactions, resulting in biomimetic, sustainable photoactive systems.
Previously in our research, self-assembled polymeric thin films were fabricated via tpy-based LbL assembly, and visible-light-induced photocurrents were generated in such polymeric films.30,31 In addition, the photocurrent efficiency was enhanced with hybrid systems using tpy-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). Herein, we designed and synthesized tpy-functionalized polymers by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) using various functionalized norbornene derivatives. To endow photo-activity, tpy-functionalized ruthenium(II) complex (Ru(bpy)2(bpy–tpy)Cl2),32 in which the tpy moiety of the Ru(II) complex can bind to tpy-functionalized polymers through metal ions, was synthesized. Using the tpy-functionalized polymers and Ru(II) complex, reversible self-assembly of the polymeric systems was demonstrated and applied to “regenerative” photocurrent generation and photo-catalysis (Fig. 1). The photocurrent efficiency of our polymeric system recovered through disassembly and re-assembly and was repeated several times without a significant decrease in its efficiency. In addition, the assembled photo-active polymers were used as photo-catalysts promoting the photo-oxidative coupling of benzylamine to N-benzylbenzaldimine. The photocatalytic system produced N-benzylbenzaldimine repeatedly after assembly with Mg2+; however, when disassembled by F−, the system showed almost no reaction due to the removal of the ruthenium complex. We believe that regenerative photo-active polymeric systems could be possible through metal–ligand interactions, and such reversible assembly can be applied to repair photo-active materials.

Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs, O.D. 6–9 nm and length 5 μm, >95%), Mg(ClO4)2, and Fe(ClO4)2 were purchased from commercial sources.
2.2 Instruments
FTIR spectra were recorded using a spectrometer (Bruker Optik, Vertex70) equipped with a diamond ATR unit. UV–Vis spectra were obtained using a UV-1800 ENG 240 V, SOFT spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a 500 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm with respect to tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as the internal standard (CDCl3: δ 7.26 ppm). Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet), coupling constants (Hz), and integration. 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 125 MHz spectrometer with complete proton decoupling. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as the internal standard (CDCl3: δ 77.26 ppm). The photocurrent experiment was performed using an Epsilon electrochemical analyzer (EC Epsilon, BASi). The average molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard using an Agilent Technology 1260 Infinity equipment. In order to perform the photocatalyst test, the light source was lased by a 5 W, 455 nm LED source (Mightex, BLS-Series High-Power LED Collimator Source, 22 mm aperture).

After being quenched using butyl vinyl ether, the insoluble precipitate was filtered and washed with MeOH. Yield: 170 mg (81%).


Preparation of a photoactive gel (from P1) and a photo-active crosslinked complex (from P2), and their photocatalytic measurements. 
Terpyridine-functionalized polymer P1 (50 mg) and tpy–Ru (3 mg) were dissolved in a mixed solvent (THF/MeOH, 0.2 mL/0.02 mL). To the mixture, 20 μL of a THF solution of Mg(ClO4)2 or Fe(II)(ClO4)2 (1 mM) was added, resulting in immediate gelation. Non-assembled tpy–Ru was removed by thorough washing with THF. The assembled gel (50 mg) from P1 and tpy–Ru was mixed with benzyl amine (20 μL, 0.18 mmol) and THF (0.3 mL) in a small vial. The vial was charged with oxygen (1 atm) and closed with a silicone septum, which was then placed under 455 nm LEDs at room temperature. After irradiation, an aliquot of the solution mixture was analyzed by 1H NMR at certain time intervals to calculate the conversion ratio. A photoactive crosslinked complex was prepared by using 20 mg of crosslinked polymer P2, dipped in a THF solution (1 mL) of tpy–Ru (2 mM) for 10 min. The swollen P2 was again dipped in a THF solution (1 mL) of Mg(ClO4)2 (1 mM) for another 10 min. The self-assembled crosslinked polymer complex was rinsed several times with THF to remove extra Mg2+ and tpy–Ru. The assembled crosslinked complex (P2 with Mg2+ and tpy–Ru) was placed in a vial with 0.5 mL of THF, and then 30 μL of benzylamine (0.27 mmol) was added to the mixture. The vial was charged with oxygen and closed with a silicone septum, and then placed under 455 nm LEDs at room temperature. An aliquot of the solution was analyzed by 1H NMR with time intervals to calculate the conversion ratio. To disassemble, 1 mL of a THF solution of TBAF (5 mM) solution was added to the mixture and washed. After irradiation, an aliquot of the solution was analyzed by 1H NMR at certain time intervals.


Preparation of photo-active MWNT films and their photocurrent generation. 
Terpyridine-functionalized MWNTs30 (1 mg), and tpy–polymer P1 (3 mg) were mixed in DMF (50 mL) and ultra-sonicated (power 39 W) for 30 min, after which the mixture was centrifuged for 40 min at 13000 rpm, and the supernatant was collected. 5 mL of the supernatant liquid was filtered through an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane (pore 0.250 μm, diameter 25 mm) and washed thoroughly with DMF. The MWNT–polymer film was transferred into an ITO-coated glass after the AAO membrane was removed using 1 M NaOH solution. The coated film was dried at 60 °C for 1 h. To assemble tpy–Ru, a THF solution (1 mL) of Mg(ClO4)2 (1 mM) was cast on the coated tpy–MWNT film. After 5 min, extra Mg2+ ions were removed by rinsing with acetonitrile. Then, a THF solution (1 mL) of tpy–Ru (2 mM) was cast for self-assembly. After 10 min, extra tpy–Ru was removed by rinsing with acetonitrile and dried at 25 °C. To disassemble, the photoactive tpy–MWNT film was rinsed thoroughly with TBAF in THF (5 mM). The photocurrent experiments were performed using an Epsilon electrochemical analyzer in a three-electrode cell configuration consisting of a quasi-internal Ag wire reference electrode submerged in 0.01 M AgNO3/0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in anhydrous CH3CN, a photo-active film coated ITO glass electrode as the working electrode, and a Pt coil as the counter electrode. The photocurrent measurement was carried out under light irradiation by using a 100 W lamp.

3. Results and discussion
To realize self-repairing or regenerative properties, a polymer and a photosensitizer (e.g., a Ru complex) should possess a reversible binding ability for “programmable” disassembly and assembly. If the photoactive system is photo-damaged and its efficiency decreases, the malfunctioned components are disassembled and “fresh” parts are re-assembled, restoring its efficiency. Since tpy has been known as a metal-binding ligand enabling reversible assembly,34,35 we designed tpy-functionalized polymers and Ru complexes (Scheme 1 and Fig. 1). The tpy-functionalized Ru (tpy–Ru) complex could be assembled on the tpy-functionalized polymer (P1 and P2), operating as a photoactive state. Once damaged photochemically (or by other reasons), the photo-inactive state could be repaired by disassembly and subsequent assembly with fresh components, regenerating the photoactive state. The tpy-functionalized Ru complex was prepared from tpy-attached bipyridine according to the literature.32
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of norbornene derivatives (1–4) and tpy-functionalized polymers P1 and P2. Reagents and conditions: (i) TEA, toluene, reflux, 12 h, 64–89%; (ii) HATU, DIEA, DMF, 25 °C, 19 h, 52%; (iii) Grubbs 3rd catalyst, THF, 25 °C, 2 h, 81–92%. 
For the preparation of tpy-functionalized polymers, norbornene derivatives were chosen as monomers, as norbornene is very versatile for functional-group modifications and can be easily polymerized in a controlled fashion by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) using Grubb's catalysts.36
In this study, a tpy-functionalized linear polymer (P1) was synthesized to fabricate photoactive films. The crosslinked polymer (P2) was also synthesized for physically more stable photoactive polymer structures. First of all, ethylhexyl- (1), carboxyl- (2), and bis-norbornene (3) were synthesized from cis-5-norbornene-exo-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride by condensation reactions with 2-ethylhexylamine, 3-aminopropionic acid, and hexyl-1,6-diamine, respectively. In order to attach the tpy ligand, carboxyl-norbornene (2) was further coupled to amine-functionalized tpy,33 promoted by a guanidinium-type reagent (1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate, HATU) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) to furnish the desired tpy-norbornene (4) (Scheme 1). Subsequently, the linear polymer P1 was synthesized by ROMP with a monomer mixture (4:1) of ethylhexyl-norbornene (1) and tpy-norbornene (4) in a decent yield. Interestingly, the tpy ligand, which could bind the Ru catalyst, did not significantly affect the efficiency of ROMP, and the molecular weight of Mn = 25200 g mol−1 and polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.3 were obtained. To fabricate stable gels (see below), a relatively-large amount of free tpy was required in the mixture of P1 and tpy–Ru. In the lower content of tpy, we were not able to generate a stable, photoactive gel. When the tpy ratio was higher than 20 mol% in P1, it gave rise to P1's low solubility and thus we confirmed that 20 mol% terpyridine seems appropriate for the fabrication of photoactive gels. The synthesized P1 was characterized by 1H NMR, FTIR, and UV–vis spectroscopy, confirming its structure. The presence of tpy could be easily observed by the addition of divalent metal ions, such as Fe2+ and Mg2+, resulting in rapid gelation (Fig. 2b).

(b) Schematic representation of the sol–gel phase transition of the P1 solution (THF) by the addition of metal ions. (c–e) UV–vis absorption spectra of P1 with the addition of Mg2+ (c) and subsequent addition of F− (d). The red and blue shifts of ligand (tpy) absorption indicate assembly and disassembly, respectively. The use of Fe2+ ions instead of Mg2+ resulted in the evolution of the MLCT band (e). All the absorption spectra were recorded using a THF solution (3 mL) of P1 (0.1 mg mL−1) with consecutive 5 μL (5 nmol) additions of 1 mM metal solutions for assembly and 2 μL (20 nmol) additions of 10 mM TBAF solutions for disassembly. 
In order to perform repeated assembly and disassembly for sustainability, a platform by using a statically crosslinked polymer with tpy ligands is necessary. The crosslinked polymer P2 was easily synthesized using crosslinkable bis-norbornene (3) as well as ethylhexyl-norbornene (1) and tpy-norbornene (4) in a ratio of 3:6:1. Crosslinked P2 was characterized by FTIR, confirming the presence of a tpy moiety (Fig. S9†). Crosslinked P2 was insoluble, but physically stable with swelling properties (% of wswollen − wdry/wdry) ranging from 1200% in THF and 4100% in dichloromethane.
The reversible binding ability of tpy–polymer P1 and tpy–Ru complex for assembly and disassembly was demonstrated by using Mg2+ and F− ions, respectively (Fig. 2). When Mg2+ (20 nmol) was introduced into a THF solution of P1 (227 mg mL−1), the solution immediately formed a gel (Fig. 2b), because of the formation of a (tpy)2Mg2+ complex (Fig. 2a).34,37 The gel-forming, assembled P1 was decomposed again with the addition of excess F− ions, since Mg2+ binds stronger with F−, than with tpy.20 To confirm the metal–ligand interaction in the self-assembly of P1, UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded with the addition of metal ions (Fig. 2c and e). The binding of tpy to a metal ion is well known to induce the planarization of pyridine moieties (i.e., dihedral angles between pyridine close to 0°), resulting in the red-shifts in the UV–vis absorption.38–40 Indeed, the addition of a 5 μL Mg2+ solution (1 mM, 5 nmol) at regular intervals to a THF solution (3 mL) of P1 (0.1 mg mL−1, ∼185 nmol of tpy) clearly showed the red-shifted absorptions of P1 from ∼310 nm to ∼330 nm due to tpy ligand planarization induced by metal-binding (Fig. 2c).40,41 Interestingly, when tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF, 20 nmol each 4 times) was added to the assembled P1 solution, the red-shifted absorption (∼330 nm) gradually returned to the pristine absorption (∼310 nm) (Fig. 2d), indicating that tpy became “un-bounded”. This result is in good accordance with the fact that F− ions bind stronger to Mg2+ than tpy, removing Mg2+ ions from the complexes. We also observed that although the amounts of F− were not enough (i.e., less than 2 equiv. of total Mg2+), the tpy–Mg2+ in P1 was completely dissociated. When the Fe2+ ion was used instead of Mg2+, similar gel formation and red-shifts in the tpy's UV–vis absorption were also observed (Fig. 2b and e). Interestingly in the case of Fe2+, the immediate color change to violet occurred because of the increased absorption at ∼570 nm, which can be assigned to the metal–ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band of the Fe(tpy)2 complex.31,38
We successfully implemented the regenerative properties in photoactive systems (photo-catalyst and photocurrent) through metal–ligand interaction; the photocatalytic activity and photocurrent efficiency can be restored via disassembly and re-assembly of active components. First of all, we confirmed that the photoactive ruthenium complex with tpy (Ru(bpy)2(bpy–tpy) or tpy–Ru) can be well-assembled to tpy-functionalized polymers (P1) by Mg2+ by red-shifts of ligand absorption (planarization) along with the existence of the Ru complex's MLCT band (∼450 nm) in the UV–vis spectra (Fig. S1†).42 In addition, when Fe2+ was applied instead of Mg2+, the MLCT band of Fe(tpy)2 was evident at ∼570 nm (Fig. S1†). The assembled complex P1/tpy–Ru was disassembled with the addition of TBAF (F−) as evidenced by the blue-shifted ligand absorptions (Fig. S1b†). The above results together indicate that tpy–Ru, the photocatalyst or photosensitizer for photocurrent generation, can be successfully assembled and disassembled on demand via metal–tpy interaction.
Utilizing the tpy–Ru photocatalyst capable of on-demand assembly, visible-light-induced photocatalytic oxidation of benzylamine to imine was conducted43 and found to be regenerative and repairable (Fig. 3a). 2 mM of tpy–Ru and 1 mM of Mg2+ were introduced on tpy-functionalized network polymer P2 (20 mg mL−1) in THF for assembly into the photoactive state. It is well known that by irradiation at 455 nm, photoexcited Ru(II)* under an oxygen atmosphere oxidizes benzylamine to benzaldimine via a benzylamine radical cation, regenerating Ru(II).44 During the process, superoxide (O2˙−) seems generated either by the direct electron transfer from Ru(II)* to oxygen (redox pathway),45 or by oxidation of benzylamine with singlet oxygen (1O2) (by energy transfer from Ru(II)*, singlet-oxygen pathway).46 Either way, the generated superoxide reacts with the benzylamine radical cation, furnishing benzaldimine and hydrogen peroxide via a peroxy-amine intermediate. Subsequently, benzaldimine is hydrolyzed to benzaldehyde, which couples to another benzylamine forming N-benzyl benzaldimine (Fig. 3b). We confirmed that superoxide (O2˙−) and hydrogen peroxide were generated under our conditions by a control experiment with superoxide dismutase (SOD, O2˙− scavenger) and a redox titration with KI/starch solution, respectively (Fig. S5 and S6†).47 After assembly, 1H NMR spectroscopy investigations showed that the irradiation of visible light (455 nm) furnished N-benzyl benzaldimine, and the conversion increased with irradiation time (Fig. 3c and S3†). Although the reaction rate was rather slow, it is important to note that by addition of TBAF for disassembly, the photocatalytic efficiency (i.e., conversion) significantly decreased due to the removal of the Ru complex. Notably, the system became photoactive again by the process of re-assembly with “fresh” tpy–Ru and Mg2+, which could be repeated several times. We envision that this reversible, on-demand self-assembly system would be applicable to other photocatalytic reactions (“solar-fuel” generation) through repeatable assembly and disassembly, resulting in regenerative, sustainable systems.

(b) Mechanism of photoinduced oxidative coupling of benzylamine to N-benzylbenzaldimine via superoxide (O2˙−). (c) Regenerative photocatalytic activity (imine formation) of P2–Ru polymer complex via repetitive assembly and disassembly. 
Interestingly, the conversion rates of benzylamine to imine were found to be different between self-assembled photoactive P1 with Mg2+ and Fe2+ (Fig. S3†). For P1 with Mg2+ under similar conditions (455 nm), the conversion was ∼72% after 6 h, while in that with Fe2+, the conversion was only 35%. Our hypothesis is that the reaction follows a redox pathway and the electron transfer rate is different depending on the metal–tpy linkages. In P1 with Mg2+, the Mg(II)(tpy)2 does not seem to take part in the photo-induced reaction, thus following the mechanism described above. However, in P1 with Fe2+, the oxidized Ru(III) complex appears to obtain an electron from Fe(II)(tpy)2 faster than from benzylamine, furnishing Fe(III)(tpy)2 (Fig. S4†). If the photoinduced oxidative coupling of benzylamine to imine proceeds, Fe(III)(tpy)2 should be able to oxidize benzylamine, which seems to occur; however, the overall conversion rate was slower (∼52% reduction). The slower conversion rate with Fe2+ was attributed to the retarded single-electron transfer from benzylamine to Fe(III)(tpy)2 when compared to those with the Ru(III) complex following the above mechanism since the diminished excitation of the Ru(II) dye (∼20%) by Fe(tpy)2 alone cannot fully explain the retarded photoreaction rate.
The different electron-transfer pathways between network polymers with Mg2+ and Fe2+ were also observed in the photoreduction of an irreversible electron acceptor, 4-bromophenyl diazonium salt (Fig. S7†).48–50 In the case of the network polymer with Fe2+, initially the MLCT absorptions of Fe(II)(tpy)2 at ∼570 nm and Ru(II)(bpy)3 at ∼450 nm were observed. During the irradiation of visible light at 455 nm, the MLCT band of Fe(II)(tpy)2 slowly decreased, while that of Ru(II)(bpy)3 remained almost the same. Because the photoexcited Ru complex (Ru(II)(bpy)3*) should be oxidized first to Ru(III)(bpy)3 by 4-bromophenyl diazonium salt, we can safely assume that Ru(II)(bpy)3 was restored by single-electron transfer from Fe(II)(tpy)2. As a result, the MLCT absorption of Fe(II)(tpy)2 (∼570 nm) decreased due to its transformation to Fe(III)(tpy)2.24,49 In contrast, in the case of the network polymer with Mg2+ under similar conditions, the MLCT absorption of Ru(II)(bpy)3 (∼450 nm) slowly decreased, suggesting that the restoration of Ru(II)(bpy)3 was not achieved, and the Ru complex remained as the oxidized state (Ru(III)(bpy)3).24 Notably, the metal–tpy bondings can not only act as the linkers for on-demand assembly, but also participate in the electron transfer pathways, altering the reaction mechanism.
We also successfully developed a regenerative photocurrent system using self-assembled composites of tpy-functionalized polymer P1, tpy-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (tpy–MWNTs),30 and tpy–Ru by metal–ligand interaction (Fig. 4). First of all, a P1/tpy–MWNT composite film was fabricated by filtration of a DMF mixture (5 mL) of P1 (0.06 mg mL−1) and tpy–MWNT (0.02 mg mL−1) over an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane, followed by transfer on an indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass electrode. Then, a few drops of acetonitrile solution of Mg2+ (1 mM) were cast on the composite film of P1/tpy–MWNT for assembly and after 5 min, extra Mg2+ ions were removed by rinsing with acetonitrile. Subsequently, a few drops of acetonitrile solution of tpy–Ru (2 mM) were also applied over the composite film bound with Mg2+ for assembly to complete the “photoactive” state. The immobilization of tpy–Ru was confirmed by the increased absorption of the MLCT band of Ru(bpy)3 (450 nm) (Fig. S8†). The prepared photoactive film was irradiated under visible light (455 nm), and the photocurrents generated were measured. The photocurrent with the self-assembled photoactive composite film increased to ∼30 nA cm−2 upon irradiation (Fig. 4b). When TBAF (F−) was introduced over the assembled composite film, the assembled tpy-complexes underwent decomposition, rendering the composite “photoinactive”; the photocurrent from the photoinactive composite film decreased from ∼30 to ∼2 nA cm−2. The MLCT band absorption of Ru(bpy)3 was also confirmed to decrease after disassembly with F− (Fig. S8†). It is important to note that the photocurrent efficiency of this system could be recovered through re-assembly with “fresh” tpy–Ru and Mg2+ (Fig. 4b), and the assembly/disassembly process was repeated several times without a significant decrease in its efficiency (Fig. 4b inset), highlighting the regenerative or repairable properties enabled by metal–tpy interaction.

4. Conclusion
In this study, reversible self-assembled photoactive polymers were successfully developed and applied to regenerative or repairable photocatalysis and photocurrent generation. Reversible metal ion–tpy interaction was utilized for on-demand assembly and disassembly of a photoactive component (Ru complex) onto polymers (P1 and P2) or MWNT composites, all of which were functionalized with a tpy moiety. P1 and P2 were synthesized from tpy-functionalized norbornene derivatives by ROMP. Assembly was achieved by addition of Mg2+, as confirmed by red-shifted ligand absorptions (∼330 nm) due to the planarization of pyridine groups by binding to Mg2+. Disassembly was accomplished by using TBAF due to a higher binding affinity of F− to Mg2+ than tpy, returning the tpy ligands to the pristine, free state. In addition, a photocatalytic polymer complex was successfully fabricated with tpy-functionalized network polymer (P2) and tpy–Ru, promoting visible-light-induced photo-oxidative coupling of benzylamine to N-benzyl benzaldimine. More importantly, the photocatalytic activity of the system ceased upon disassembly by F− and restored upon assembly with “fresh” tpy–Ru and Mg2+ and was repeated several times. A similar regenerative or repairable property was demonstrated with photocurrent generation; a photocurrent system using tpy-functionalized composite films with P1, tpy–MWNT, and tpy–Ru via self-assembly by Mg2+–tpy interaction was successfully fabricated. The photoactive composite films showed a photocurrent generation of ∼30 nA cm−2 after assembly; however, the photocurrent efficiency decreased after disassembly by F−, which was restored repeatedly by re-assembly. We believe that the metal–tpy interaction can be applied to the development of other regenerative or repairable photoactive systems via on-demand assembly/disassembly, which may ensure sustainability in organic photoactive systems.
