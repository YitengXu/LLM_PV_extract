1 Introduction
Composites are well-known fascinating materials, which are made from two or more components with different physical, chemical and mechanical properties. When the components are combined, the composites possess better properties than those of each individual component alone. Until now, composites were broadly applied in the aerospace industry, military industry, automobile industry, construction materials and other engineering applications1–8 due to their advantages, such as high specific strength and modulus, ease of fabrication, high design flexibility, good resistance to fatigue and corrosion, desirable thermal expansion characteristics, and economic efficiency.1,4,8–12 Usually, composites are comprised of one continuous phase (matrix) and one or more discontinuous phase (reinforcement), which is harder, stronger, stiffer, and more stable than the continuous matrix phase.13,14 Based on the reinforcement materials, the composites could be divided into three classes, including particulate (particles and flakes) reinforced composites, fiber (continuous and discontinuous) reinforced composites, and hybrid material (particles, flakes and fibers) reinforced composites.
Among these composites, fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPs) play an important role in civil infrastructure and high-tech equipment for the aerospace industry, military industry, civil engineering area and so on.2,9,10,15–20 In the last 30 years, FRPs have gradually, partially or completely replaced the traditional engineering materials such as wood, metal, glass, and even ceramics in a few areas of applications.20–24 FRPs are defined as a combination of polymer resins (matrix or binders) and strong and stiff fibers (reinforcements). The main functions of fibers are to bear the load and provide high strength, high modulus, high stiffness, and thermal stabilities to the FRP composites, while the polymer matrix has functions of binding the fibers, holding the position of the fibers, transferring the load to the fibers by adhesion/friction, and protecting the fibers from environment damages. However, by appropriately selecting the types of the polymer resins and the reinforcement fibers and using different processing technologies, the physical properties of the FRP composites can be versatilely tailored.25 In many cases, the FRP composites can also be imparted with other functional properties, such as optical properties,26,27 magnetic properties, electrical properties28,29 and conductivity30,31 by the modifications of fibers or matrix.
Traditional FRPs usually use fibers with diameters in the micrometer range as reinforcements.32–35 Composites reinforced with these microfibers possess excellent structural properties such as high specific modulus and strength. However, the amazing development of nanotechnology provides another choice of using nanofibers as reinforcements in making nanocomposites. Compared with traditional microfibers, nanofibers can possess even better mechanical properties including high modulus, high tensile strength and toughness due to the amazing size effect of nanofibers and hence improve the structural properties of nanocomposites.
Until now, three main kinds of nanofibers, cellulose nanofibers/nanowhiskers (CNFs/CNWs), carbon nanofibers, and synthetic polymer nanofibers, are used as reinforcements. CNFs/CNWs usually come from the isolation of cellulose based materials.36–39 Carbon nanofibers can be produced by a straightforward way of charring of the natural or synthetic textile fibers in the absence of air, and by the pyrolysis of a hydrocarbon feedstock (natural gas, acetylene, etc.) or carbon monoxide on a metal catalyst such as iron.18,40,41 Synthetic polymer nanofibers can be efficiently produced by the electrospinning technology.42–45
Electrospinning is the most effective state-of-the-art method for the generation of continuous polymer nanofibers and nanofiber nonwovens.42,44,46,47 The nanofibers/nanofiber materials fabricated using this technology have a large surface area, large porosity, high aspect ratio of length to diameter and high molecular orientation along the fiber axis, making them very useful in many applications in diverse fields such as energy storage, healthcare, biotechnology, environmental engineering, defense and security. The quite high-speed developments in electrospinning technology in the last few years, on the one hand, make the modifications of the morphology of the nanofibers possible by varying the processing parameters, and on the other hand, have enhanced the production from a few grams to kilograms of nanofibers/nanofiber nonwovens in a short time. Such developments also promote many new application areas of nanofibers/nanofiber nonwovens and there is no doubt that the electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites have risen as a shining star in the horizon on the path of FRPs.
In the past decade, significant progress has been made according to our fundamental understanding of the preparation and properties of electrospun nanofibers and their applications in composites as reinforcements. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research activities regarding the electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites. In Section 2, a general introduction of the electrospinning technology including the background of the electrospinning technology and the advanced electrospun nanofibers will be made. Section 3 fully describes the properties of electrospun nanofibers. The size effect, molecular orientation, and optical and mechanical properties are discussed in this section. Section 4 will deal with the fabrication method of electrospun nanofiber reinforced polymer composites from previous studies. Section 5 is a comprehensive discussion on electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites reinforced by different types of high performance polymer nanofibers. In Section 6, we highlight the factors affecting the properties of electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites. Finally in Sections 7 and 8, we draw conclusions regarding the activities of this research area and show the challenges and prospects of the electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites.
2 Electrospinning
Electrospinning is a versatile and fascinating technology to produce ultra-fine fibers with diameters from several micrometers even to sub-nanometers.44,46–57 So far, a huge number of materials such as polymers, composite ceramics, metals, carbon nanotubes, and even bacteria and viruses can be fabricated/incorporated into micro/nanofibers by directly electrospinning or through the post-spinning process. Many publications including reviews and research papers were focused on the process, properties and applications of electrospinning/electrospinning nanofibers.44,47–56 The electrospinning nanofibers/nanofiber materials have unique properties, such as ultra-fine diameter, huge surface area to volume ratio (about a thousand times higher than that of a human hair), large porosity, high aspect ratio of length to diameter, high mechanical properties due to the high molecular orientation along the fiber axis, and easy-tailored nanofiber products. Because of the excellent properties, the electrospinning nanofibers/nanofiber materials have been applied to a broad range of areas, such as electrospun biodegradable polymer fibers for tissue engineering/repairing,58–60 cell culture61,62 and drug release,63–65 electrospun engineering polymers for highly efficient air and liquid filters,66–68 battery separators,69–71 dielectric materials,72–76 electric conductive materials,77–80 electrospun metal/metal oxide nanofibers and conducting polymer nanofibers for solar cells,81–83 electrodes of fuel cells/batteries and supercapacitors,84–88 electrospun highly porous nanofibers for hydrogen storages,89–91 electrospun responsible polymers for application in sensors,92,93 electrospun special and functional polymers for multi-functional protective clothing,94,95 electrospun fibers for pH and temperature responsive materials and actuators,96–100 electrospun high performance polymers for fabricating nanofiber reinforced composites,101–106 short electrospun fibers for sponges,65,96,107–119 and many others.
2.1 Electrospinning technology

2.1.1 History of electrospinning. 
The history of electrospinning technology can be divided into two main stages. The first stage was the initial exploration of electrospinning. In 1887, Boys conducted the first studies on electrical spinning for the finest threads.120 Later in 1902, patents on the process and apparatus of electrospinning were applied by Cooley121 and Morton.122 In 1914, Zeleny made the first attempt to establish a mathematical model on the effect of electrical forces on the liquids by studying the behavior of fluid droplets at the end of metal capillaries under the electrical forces.123 In the 1930s and 1940s, a series of patents on the apparatus and the process of electrospinning greatly promoted the development of electrospinning toward commercialization.124–132 In 1936, one patent regarding the use of air-blast to assist fiber formation during the electrospinning of the melt liquids was claimed by Norton.133 In the 1960s, Taylor et al. mathematically modeled the conical geometry of the fluid droplet by the electric field, which was later well known as a “Taylor cone”.134–137 The 1970s and 1980s were a depression time for the development of electrospinning with very few publications or investments on the electrospinning technology.
Since the 1990s, due to the fast development of nanotechnology and the easy way to obtain nanofibers, electrospinning technology has gained worldwide attentions, which indicates that the second booming stage of electrospinning has come. Several research groups like the Reneker group and the Wendorff group have shown that a wide variety of polymers could be processed into nanofibers by electrospinning,138–140 which established a stepping stone in the development of electrospinning and dramatically promoted the research on materials at the nanoscale level. Since then, an explosive development has taken place in the electrospinning field as proved by the exponential increase of the publications on electrospinning in the past nearly 20 years (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, similar trends on the number of publications per year are also observed for the topic of “electrospinning + composite”, which attracts more than 1/3 attention in the electrospinning field and indicates the abundant opportunities in this area.

2.1.2 The basic setup and process of electrospinning. 

Fig. 2 presents schematic diagrams of the basic setup for the electrospinning process, which presents the fabrication of highly aligned fibers (Fig. 2A) and randomly deposited fibers (Fig. 2B).141 The traditional electrospinning setup often consists of three parts: a high voltage power supply, a spinneret (metallic needle, nozzle, disc or wire) and a grounded collector (metal net, aluminum paper, baking paper, plate, rotating disc or drum). During the electrospinning process, a high voltage is applied to the droplet from a polymer solution or polymer melt at the tip of the spinneret. When the high voltage power continuously increased, the droplet will start to elongate into a conical shape known as a “Taylor cone”.142 In this case, the critical applied voltage is achieved. Once the electrostatic force overcomes the surface tension of the droplet, a fine charged jet will be ejected from the bottom of the Taylor cone. Subsequently, the fine charged jet undergoes a series of whipping instabilities due to the electrostatic field and accelerates into thin fibers accompanied by a fast evaporation of the solvent. In most cases, stable and unstable electrospinning jets can be observed during the electrospinning process.143 When the applied external electrostatic force is smaller than the critical voltage, the jet will be broken into droplets, which is called the “Plateau-Rayleigh instability”.144–146 If the applied external electrostatic force exceeds the critical voltage in a certain range, the stable electrospinning jet can be obtained. When a much bigger external electrostatic force than the surface tension is applied, two, three and even four electrospinning jets will be formed from only one droplet.147

The final fiber morphology and diameter depend on three main factors.148–153 (1) Parameters from the setup of electrospinning, such as the feeding rate, the diameter and the shape of the spinneret, the distance between the collector and the spinneret tip, and the shape of the collectors; (2) parameters from the polymer solution, such as the properties of the polymers (type, molecular weight, polymer dispersity index, etc.), the properties of the solvents (types, boiling point, dielectric constant, surface tension, etc.), the properties of the polymer solutions (concentration, viscosity, rheological behavior, electric conductivity, surface tension, etc.) and the additives (salts, surfactants); (3) parameters from the ambient environment, such as the relative humidity, temperature, and the gas velocity in the electrospinning setup. Therefore, no universal electrospinning parameters are suitable for all polymers. However, by carefully changing the parameters mentioned above, a huge number of polymer fibers with different morphologies/structures and diameters in the range from a few nanometers to several micrometers can be prepared through electrospinning.

2.2 Electrospun nanofibers
Electrospinning technology experiences a dramatic development due to the convenience of producing nanofibers and huge potential of these fibers for varied applications. Until now, the sources of electrospun fibers are not only restricted to single component polymers, but also come from polymer blends, and hybrid materials like polymers with metals, metal oxides, ceramics, carbon nanotubes, and even bacteria, viruses, and enzymes. These diversities make 1D fibrous structures more unique with additional functionalities like optical, electronic, sensoric, magnetic, and catalytic properties and provide them applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery, filters and textiles, sensors, fuel cells and batteries, catalysis, nanocomposites, etc.

2.2.1 One component electrospun nanofibers. 
Traditional early electrospun nanofibers are mainly electrospun from single component polymers with sufficiently high molecular weight and good solubility in appropriate solvents. In the past decade, hundreds of polymers have been successfully electrospun into nanofibers, including commercially available polymers like nylons,103 polyethylene oxide (PEO),154 polyacrylonitrile (PAN),155 polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),156 poly-L-lactide (PLLA),157 PVDF,158etc. Today, the knowhow regarding the parameters affecting the process of electrospinning and fiber morphologies is well-established, both from the theoretical and practical points-of-view. The advantages of the nanofibers provided by electrospinning are also very obvious. The high specific surface area provides better solubility, controlled release of encapsulated molecules, catalysis, and reinforcement among several others.159 Due to the higher molecular orientation in electrospun fibers than in films, the electrospun fibers usually presented much larger tensile strength and modulus than the corresponding films, as proved by the example of electrospun polyimide nanofibers and polyimide films.106 These special properties, such as high porosity, good mechanical properties, and high specific surface area, provide electrospun polymer nanofibers applications in the filtration and textile fields.


2.2.2 Two/multi-component electrospun nanofibers. 
Compared to single component electrospun nanofibers, two/multi-component electrospun nanofibers provide diverse compositions, structures and functionalities. Two strategies are used to prepare two/multi-component electrospun nanofibers. The easiest way is electrospinning the polymer blend solutions by simple single nozzle electrospinning. Also, hybrid and composite fibers can be made by the use of additional additives and fillers. Another way is the use of two/multi-channel spinnerets/nozzles, where two or more than two solutions are delivered into the different channels simultaneously. For example, coaxial electrospinning makes use of a coaxial (core–shell) spinneret and various materials including polymers, oligomers, metal salts, proteins, oils, and even cells/bacteria/viruses could be immobilized into the core component of the core–shell nanofibers.42,160–167 In an ideal case, the nanofibers with core–shell or hollow structures could be prepared by optimizing the electrospinning conditions, such as feeding rate, applied voltage, and so on. Through side-by-side electrospinning by a side-by-side spinneret (Fig. 3A), Janus fibers with two different components and multi-functionalities are incorporated into the 1D fibrous structure (Fig. 3B–D).168–170 Even other interesting fiber morphologies, such as bead-on-strings, can also be made by the use of side-by-side nozzles on choosing the appropriate incompatible polymers and appropriate spinning conditions.97

Spinnerets with a triaxial shape or three channel arrays are used for generating tri-component fibers, by delivering three polymer solutions into the three channels at the same time. These tri-component fibers are of special interest as carriers for various drugs of biomaterials. However, due to the complex structure of the fibers and the difficulties in the characterization of the tri-component structures, until now, only countable studies are focused on this area. Liu et al. reported the preparation of multilayer biodegradable nanofibers by triaxial electrospinning.171 Kalra et al. introduced triaxial electrospun nanofibers with SI-28 magnetite NPs sandwiched between two silica layers.172 Chen et al. prepared nanowire-in-microtube structured nanofibers via triaxial electrospinning and selective removal of the middle component (Fig. 4).173

Additionally, it should also be worth noting that Zhao et al. proposed a novel multi-channel spinneret to fabricate multi-channel microtubes by electrospinning and post-treatment.174 The microtubes with multi-channels had wide potential applications, such as multi-component drug delivery, highly efficient catalysts, multi-channel microreactors and so on.

3 Properties of electrospun nanofibers
Compared to the bulk materials and microfibers, electrospun nanofibers present some unique characteristics, such as size effect, optical transparency, and mechanical and thermal mechanical properties, which make electrospun nanofibers excellent reinforcements.
3.1 Aspect ratio
Due to the small size, nanofibers have a high aspect ratio (length to diameter, L/d), which is hundreds of times larger than that of the microfibers. As reinforcements, continuous fibers present better mechanical performance than the particles, whiskers or short fibers because the reinforcement effect depends on the aspect ratio. When low aspect ratio fillers are used for reinforcement, generally the composite would show a decrease of the mechanical performance because (1) the stress concentration resulted from the fiber edges acts as crack initiators; (2) there is no effect on the matrix-to-fiber load transfer from the fiber edges; and (3) the difficulties of overlapping each other in an appreciable measure for the fillers with a low aspect ratio lead to limited contributions in reinforcing composites.53
3.2 Molecular orientation
Due to the very large draw ratios and strain rates during electrospinning, electrospun nanofibers show high molecular orientation along the fiber axis. Conventional techniques for investigating molecular orientation, such as FT-IR spectroscopy and WXRD, require quantities of highly aligned nanofibers. The results are a combination of fiber alignment and molecular orientation. The advanced techniques of atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and polarized Raman spectroscopy are used to directly determine the molecular orientation in single fibers.175 Generally, polymer nanofibers with a rigid rod-like molecular structure possesses higher molecular orientation than those with a soft molecular structure due to the chain-entanglement effect during electrospinning. Hou and Jiang et al. reported that the thinner nanofibers had higher molecular orientation than the thicker fibers because the polymer molecules would be restricted in the very thin nanofibers and the polymer molecules had more opportunities to randomly locate in the thick fibers.141,176–178 Recently, they confirmed that the thin electrospun polyimide nanofibers even had a very high molecular orientation factor of 0.91 by polarized Raman spectroscopy and only 1–3 molecules could form super-thin sub-nanometer electrospun fibers.57,179 Naraghi et al. found that electrospun PAN nanofibers with the longest collecting distance of 25 cm (corresponding to thinner nanofibers) showed the highest molecular orientation factor of 50% compared to the molecular orientation factor of 21–22% with a shorter electrospinning distance (15 and 20 cm, corresponding to bigger nanofibers).180 Yoshioka et al. used TEM to study the molecular orientation of electrospun PE fibers with a diameter of 500 nm (Fig. 5A) and found that the ribbon-like fibers showed a highly ordered molecular orientation (Fig. 5B).181

The rather sharp 110 and 200 equatorial reflections (with respect to the fiber axis) and the meridional 002 reflection indicate a high degree of molecular orientation.

3.3 Specific surface area

Fig. 6 shows the fiber size effect on the specific surface area of different fibrous materials, such as carbon nanotubes, electrospun fibers, textile microfibers, conventional textile fibers and human hair. When the fiber diameter comes to the nanometer scale, the specific surface area of fibers increases dramatically.182 For example, the carbon nanotubes with a diameter around 30 nm could possess a specific surface of about 100 m2 g−1. When the diameter comes to 60 μm, which is approximately the size range of a human hair, the specific surface area is decreased to only 0.05 m2 g−1. The size of electrospun nanofibers is in the typical range from 10 nm to 1000 nm, suggesting that the specific surface area of electrospun fibers could range from 300 to 3 m2 g−1. This specific surface area is much higher than that from conventional textile fibers. Because of the high specific surface area, the electrospun nanofibers will provide more contact areas to the polymer matrix, which would significantly improve the nanofiber–matrix interaction and provide effective load transfer between the matrix and the nanofibers.

3.4 Pore size
The pore size in the electrospun nanofiber nonwovens is linearly decreased with the reduced fiber diameters. Hussain et al. embedded the nanofiber nonwovens into the epoxy and checked the effect of the fiber diameter on the pore size (Fig. 7).183 The fiber nonwoven with a fiber diameter of 309 nm had a pore size of about 1–2 μm while bigger pore sizes of more than 5 μm were observed from the fiber nonwoven with a fiber diameter of 520 nm (Fig. 7A and B). Fig. 7C shows a linear fitting based on the relationship between the fiber diameter and the geometric pore size. An expectation that the reduction of the fiber diameter from about 50 μm to 200 nm would cause a pore size reduction from 400 μm to 1 μm could be made from the linear fitting. These special properties of the pore size would provide useful instructions on how to choose the nanofiber nonwovens for the preparation of composites and the control of the nanofiber amount in the composites.

3.5 Optical transparency
Fibers with diameters down to the nano-scale could provide optical transparency to the composites.102,184–188 As shown in Fig. 8, when an incident light comes to an interface, it may reflect, transmit and refract. The light reflection gives rise to most of the light loss, and more light reflection will happen as the interfacial area increases. So, a small fiber with a smaller interfacial area with matrix results in less light loss (Fig. 8, more green arrows mean more light loss). What's more, it is well known that light is actually a type of electromagnetic wave. It may pass an object when the object size is smaller than the light wavelength. Visible light has a wavelength arranged from 400 nm to 700 nm. Due to those nanofibers with diameters smaller than 400 nm as reinforcements, the refraction of visible light on these fiber/matrix interfaces is very minor. Thus the optically transparent composites reinforced by nanofibers could be produced.
 Fig. 8  Simplified model of light transmitted through fiber reinforced resin. The RIs of the resin and fiber do not match. Φi is the incident light; Φt is the transmitted light. The green arrows mean reflected light at the air/resin and fiber/resin interfaces; the red arrows mean refracted light at the interfaces. Assuming that the reflected light does not go into the other end of the composite, Φt of the transmitted light through the microfiber is significantly less than Φi. Light would pass through the nanofiber without the occurrence of reflection/refraction at the fiber/resin interfaces. Reprinted with permission from ref. 184. Copyright (2008) Elsevier Ltd. 
3.6 Mechanical properties
Due to the higher crystallinity and higher molecular orientation, the fibers with diameters at the nanoscale show significantly improved mechanical performance including tensile strength, E modulus and toughness, compared to the microfibers.53,189–198 This phenomenon is named size-dependent mechanical properties. Many researchers have proved the size effect on the mechanical properties of fibers. A dramatic increase of the Young's modulus from 300 MPa to 3200 MPa and the tensile strength from 20 MPa to 220 MPa was demonstrated by Chew et al., when the diameter of the PCL fibers decreased from 5 μm down to the nanometer regime (200–300 nm).199 Similar results for PCL fibers were also provided by Sun et al.,200 and Liao et al.201 Papkov et al.189 found the size effect of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers on the elastic modulus and toughness (Fig. 9). A linear increase in the strength (Fig. 9A), modulus (Fig. 9B) and toughness (Fig. 9C) was observed as the diameter of the electrospun nanofiber was smaller than 500 nm, which was also proved by the typical stress–strain curves (Fig. 9D). The same conclusion about the size effect of fibers on the mechanical performance was also observed on the electrospun polyamide (nylon-6) fibers, polyimide (PI) fibers, carbon fibers, and so on.191,194,198,202,203 This effect could be explained by three aspects.53,198,204 First, the electric force-induced molecular orientation along the fiber axis happens during the electrospinning. Second, the smaller fiber diameter leads to higher crystallinity. Third, less surface defects per unit fiber length might appear on a smaller fiber, which results in better mechanical properties.

Besides the change in the mechanical properties due to the fiber size, electrospun nanofibers could be reinforced by incorporating other nanoscale additives and polymers by the normal electrospinning of the blend solution or by coaxial/triaxial electrospinning methods. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are considered the ideal reinforcement due to their superior mechanical properties. A lot of work has proved that a small amount of CNTs in electrospun nanofibers would lead to great improvement in mechanical strength, modulus and toughness. Ko et al. found that 4 wt% of SWCNTs in electrospun nanofiber yarns led to a 120% improvement of the modulus.205 Hou et al. embedded 5% MWCNTs into PAN nanofibers, which led to a 75% tensile strength improvement.206
Other kinds of additives like montmorillonite,207 cellulose nanocrystals,208,209 graphite nanoplatelets,210 ferritin nanoparticles,211etc. could also effectively improve the mechanical performance of electrospun nanofibers. For instance, Li et al. reported that the Young's modulus and ultimate strength of electrospun nanocomposite fibrous mats with 15% organically modified montmorillonite (O-MMT) were improved up to 70% and 30%, respectively, when compared with nylon-6 electrospun mats.207 Zoppe et al. and Zhou et al. added cellulose nanocrystals into polycarprolactone (PCL) and PEO nanofibers, and found obvious improvements in the mechanical properties.208,209
Coaxial/triaxial electrospinning has been proved to effectively improve the mechanical properties of electrospun fibers. Han et al. used PU as the core and PC as the shell for coaxial electrospinning and found that 8 wt% PU in the fibers led to the best reinforcement of the fiber membrane.212 Coaxial electrospinning was also used to prepare the PEO core and PEO/MWNT shell fibers and the obtained fibers were highly reinforced when only loading a small amount of MWNTs to the sheath.213 Nguyen et al. used PLA as a core to reinforce the chitosan shell by coaxial electrospinning.214 Recently, our group significantly improved the tensile strength, elongation at break and toughness of PS by incorporating 30 wt% TPU when comparing the corresponding properties of the single PS fibers (Fig. 10A).215 This enhancement was achieved by electrospinning with a special triaxial concentric nozzle to sandwich TPU between the two layers of PS (Fig. 10B). These coaxial and triaxial electrospinning technologies would provide more choices to prepare high performance electrospun fibers as reinforcements.

4 Preparation of electrospun nanofiber reinforced polymer composites
During the preparation of fiber reinforced polymer composites, the fibers should be embedded into the polymer matrix. Depending on the formation of fibers, including continuous fibers (nonwovens, knitted fabrics, and aligned fiber mats) and short fibers (CNTs, short microfibers and short nanofibers), different fabrication methods (dip-coating, film-stacking, solution casing, in situ polymerization, melt blending and electrospinning) would be applied for the preparation of fiber reinforced polymer composites.
Due to the entanglement of the fibers, the continuous fibers can't be dispersed into the polymer solutions or melts homogeneously. Thus, dip-coating and film-stacking (layer-by-layer hot-pressing and layer-by-layer deposition) methods are suitable for the continuous fiber reinforced composites. Dip-coating is a good way to impregnate the electrospun fiber membranes into the polymer matrix solutions or melts. Labronici and Ishida had a review on toughening composites via fiber coating.216 Our group studied the wetting behavior and compared the mechanical properties of nylon-6 nanofiber reinforced melamine formaldehyde (MF) with the dip-coating method and the method of passing the MF solution through the nylon-6 fiber mat.103 The reinforcing effect is significantly affected by the thickness of the electrospun fiber membranes and the amount of fibers in the matrix. Too thick fiber membranes or too many fibers would hinder the homogeneous coating process.217 One efficient way to avoid inhomogeneous coating is applying small vacuum while coating. Film-stacking is another common way to prepare fiber reinforced polymer laminates. Neppalli et al. made PCL composites by sandwiching the electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers between PCL films.218 Akangah et al. used a nylon-66 nanofiber as an interleaving layer to toughen the sixteen-ply quasi-isotropic epoxy/carbon fiber composite laminates.101 In 2012, our group developed a novel film stacking procedure combined solution casting and electrospinning to produce transparent electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber reinforced TPU composites with reinforced tensile strength and toughness.104
As reinforcements, short fibers could be incorporated into the polymer matrix by solution casting, in situ polymerization, melt blending, electrospinning, etc. Many kinds of short fibers like CNTs,205,219–230 glass,231 carbon,73,232,233 nature plant,234,235 nylon,236 cellulose whisker237 and aramid238–241 have been applied to fabricate short fiber reinforced polymer composites by the above processing technique. For example, CNTs were added into the polymer matrix by solution casting,219,220 electrospinning,205,221 melt mixing,222,223 shear mixing,224,225 melt fiber spinning226,227 and in situ polymerization.228–230 However, until now, there are very few reports regarding the preparation of short electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites. Recently, we attempted to disperse short electrospun nanofibers into the polymer solution and made composites by film-casting.217,242 Due to the similar characteristics, we believe that short electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites could be prepared using the same methods as that for fabricating CNT/short fiber reinforced composites.
5 Composites reinforced by different kinds of electrospun nanofibers
Until now, hundreds of polymers could be electrospun into nanofibers. However, not all of them are suitable as reinforcements to make fiber reinforced composites. Electrospun nanofibers with excellent tensile strength, modulus and toughness would be good candidates as reinforcements. In this part, a comprehensive review regarding the high performance electrospun nanofibers (Table 1) and the corresponding fiber reinforced composites will be introduced in the following sections.

5.1 Electrospun nylon nanofiber reinforced composites
Electrospun nylon nanofibers exhibit excellent mechanical properties. Molnar et al. found that the single nylon-6 nanofibers have 48% higher tensile strength than the bulk nylon-6 material by modeling the tensile behavior of the nanofibrous mat.255 Bazbouz et al. developed a setup for the tensile testing of a single nanofiber and their results indicated that the aligned single electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber with a diameter of 800 nm had a Young's modulus of 902 MPa, a tensile strength of 304 MPa and a strain at break of 40%.194 Hwang et al. obtained the tensile strength of single electrospun nylon-6 fibers by a “hooking method”.198 The fibers with diameters of 60, 100 and 170 nm showed a tensile strength of 364, 125 and 94 MPa, respectively. Li et al.207 and Ding et al.243 studied the mechanical performance of electrospun single nylon-6 and single nylon-6 composite fibers by AFM. Their results indicated that the Young's modulus of nylon-6 electrospun single nanofibers was much higher than that of the conventional nylon-6 fibers and could be significantly improved by incorporating organically modified montmorillonite and SiO2 particles.207,243 Another report by Zussman et al. indicated that single electrospun nylon-6,6 nanofibers with a take-up velocity of 5 and 20 m s−1 had a mechanical strength of 110 and 150 MPa and a Young's modulus of 453 and 950 MPa, respectively.244 Therefore, a lot of researchers devoted their efforts to fabricate electrospun nylon nanofiber reinforced composites as summarized in Table 2.

One of the first papers concerning the preparation and the structure–property of such composites was published by Bergshoef and Vancso.102 They prepared electrospun nylon-4,6 nanofibers with diameters (30–200 nm) smaller than the wavelength of visible light to prepare transparent composites with an epoxy matrix. The tensile tests showed that a low fiber content of 3.9 wt% led to a significant improvement in both stiffness and tensile strength. Li et al. fabricated transparent PMMA composites reinforced by electrospun graphene-incorporated nylon-6 nanofibers.256 Chen et al. combined the coaxial electrospinning technique and hot-pressing to prepare nylon-6 nanofiber reinforced transparent composites.188,257 They found that the nylon-6/PMMA composites could achieve significant improvement in the mechanical properties with a minor loss of transparency. Recently, Li et al. prepared nylon-6 reinforced PMMA transparent composites by self-blending co-electrospinning followed by hot-press molding.269 The obtained composites showed an anisotropy of the optical and mechanical properties. In another report by Stachewicz et al., they prepared transparent nylon-6/PVA composites and investigated the effect of the nanofiber amount on the voids between the matrix and the fibers (Fig. 11).258 They found that the composites by impregnating nanofibers in an optimum 16 wt% PVA solution exhibited the highest failure stress (Fig. 11A and B), which could be due to the void-free structures of the composites (Fig. 11C).

Fong and coworkers made efforts to use electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers to reinforce BIS-GMA/TEGDMA dental materials.259,260 They prepared defect-free electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers with a fiber diameter of 100–600 nm (Fig. 12A) and embedded them in the neat BIS-GMA/TEGDMA resin (Fig. 12B).259 The obtained composites with 5 wt% amount of nylon-6 fibers showed an enhanced elastic modulus, flexural strength and fracture work of the composite by 26%, 36% and 42%, respectively, which could be attributed to the strong interface interactions between the fibers and the matrix (Fig. 12C). Later they found that the hybrid reinforcement of electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers and silanized fibrillar silicates could greatly improve the fracture work of the composite by 98%.260 Bottino's group made random and aligned MWCNT/nylon-6 composite fibers by electrospinning and studied their reinforcing effect on the flexural strength of a dental resin.261 They found that the dental composites could be significantly reinforced by the aligned nylon-6 nanofibers with 0.5 wt% MWCNTs. Romo-Uribe et al. demonstrated that the electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber mat (250 nm of fiber diameter) effectively improved the mechanical properties and thermal stability to polyaniline (PANI) thin films.272 In addition, recently, An et al. presented semi-transparent electrospun nylon-6,6 nanofiber reinforced cyclic butylene terephthalate composites by the electrospinning process followed by the hot press method.270 Compared with the pristine nylon-6,6 nanofibers, the composites with enhanced mechanical properties could be because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between cyclic butylene terephthalate and nylon-6,6 molecules.

Electrospun nylon nanofibers can be used as an interleaved layer to make composites. Akangah et al. fabricated quasi-isotropic composites using electrospun nylon-6,6 nanofibers as an interleaved layer.101,273 The nanofiber interleaving significantly increased the threshold impact force by 60% and reduced the rate of impact damage growth rate to one-half with impact height.101 A similar study with electrospun nylon-6,6 nanofibers as an interleaved layer to toughen the carbon/epoxy was conducted by Beckermann et al. and it was found that a 4.5 g m−1 nylon-66 veil led to an enhancement by 156% and 69% for mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness, respectively.262 De Schoenmaker et al. investigated the effect of electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers as an interlayered structure on the mechanical properties of glass/epoxy composites and they demonstrated that some mechanical improvement was achieved by the addition of electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers.263 Saghafi et al. also systematically studied the effect of electrospun nylon-6,6, PCL and their combination as an interleaved layer on the mode I and mode II fracture response of composite laminates.264 Goodarz et al. applied electrospun graphene nanoplatelets/nylon-66 mats as a hybrid multi-scaled interlayer to fabricate expoxy composites.268 It was found that, at 0.5 wt% GNPs, the toughness went up by 25% while it pronouncedly increased by 68% at 1 wt% loading. In another recent report, Habibi Zarabadi et al. presented protein based composites containing an interlayer of electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers with greatly improved oxygen and water vapor permeability, glass transition temperature and mechanical properties, which could be attributed to the good adhesion between the matrix and the filler.271
Electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber sheets were reported to reinforce biodegradable and biocompatible PCL and polylactide (PLA) by Neppalli et al.218,265 The nylon-6/PCL composites could be easily prepared by compression moulding and a very small amount of nanofibers (3 wt%) could lead to an improved stiffness with a simultaneous increase in ductility.218 In another report, PLA composites reinforced by electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers were fabricated and good interfacial adhesion between PLA and fibers was observed.265 Compared to the neat PLA, the nylon-6/PLA composites showed a modulus increase up to 3-fold. Although an increase in the mechanical properties was seen, the use of non-degradable reinforcing fibers for reinforcing the biodegradable matrix could be a matter of debate.
Electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber mats are also used to reinforce the melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin and TPU to prepare nanofiber reinforced transparent composites.103,104 Depending on the fabrication methods, a drastic effect of the wetting process of the fiber mat by the MF precursor on both morphology and mechanical properties was found and in comparison with the MF resin, the composite showed transparency and enhanced mechanical strength and toughness.103 In another report, transparent nylon-6 nanofiber reinforced TPU composites were fabricated by a layer-by-layer assembly by film casting and electrospinning (Fig. 13).104 With this method, very small amounts of nanofibers (0.4–1.7 wt%; fiber diameter: 150–300 nm) could significantly improve the mechanical properties like tensile strength, modulus and toughness without scarifying the optical transparency. Similarly, Lu et al. prepared polyolefin based composites with very small amount of electrospun nylon-6,6 nanofibers and the composites showed improved tensile strength, modulus and toughness.266

5.2 Electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber reinforced composites
Electrospun PAN nanofibers possessed excellent tensile strength, modulus and toughness. Gu et al. studied the effect of the applied electrospinning voltage on the Young's modulus of a single electrospun PAN nanofiber by the AFM bending test.245 The result indicated that the single PAN fiber electrospun from 22 kV showed a much higher Young's modulus (14.07 GPa) than that from 18 kV (6.88 GPa). Recently, Dzenis's group systematically investigated the size effect on the mechanical properties and the structures of single electrospun PAN nanofibers.189 When the fiber diameter reduced from 2.8 μm to around 100 nm, simultaneously the elastic modulus, true strength and toughness significantly increased from 0.36 to 48 GPa, 15 to 1750 MPa and 0.25 to 605 MPa, respectively, which could be attributed to the increase of crystallinity.
Sun et al. used a multi-syringe electrospinning technique to prepare electrospun PAN nanofiber–PS composite fibers by simultaneous spinning of the two polymers using moving syringes (Fig. 14A and B).274 They demonstrated that at a syringe number ratio of 3/1 PS/PAN, the composites has a three times increase of the tensile strength compared to the pure PS mats (Fig. 14C). Wu et al. prepared transparent PMMA composite films reinforced by randomly organized and uniaxially aligned PAN nanofibers (diameter: around 550 nm).186 Depending on the fiber orientation, the composites with aligned fibers showed 40% tensile strength and 30% Young's modulus more than that with randomly organized PAN nanofibers. Similarly, recently, Zainab et al. prepared a PAN/PU based composite by multi-needle electrospinning.275 The composites exhibited good mechanical and thermal properties, and were used for lithium ion battery separators.

In order to improve the interfacial adhesion between the fibers and the matrix, PAN-core PMMA-shell nanofibers were prepared by coaxial electrospinning to reinforce dental materials.276,277 Lin et al. found that the PMMA part could guarantee the good interfacial adhesion between the matrix and the coaxial fiber, while the PAN core could provide the high mechanical properties as reinforcements.276 In a following report, Sun et al.277 improved the tensile properties by post-drawing aligned PAN-core PMMA-shell nanofiber membranes and found that the BIS-GMA/TEGDMA reinforced by these membranes showed increased flexural strength, flexural modulus and work of fracture by 51.6%, 64.3% and 152.0%, respectively, in comparison with the pure resin. Cheng et al. prepared sodium fluoride (NaF)-loaded PAN core PMMA shell nanofibers by coaxial electrospinning and determined the reinforcing effect of these fibers on BIS-GMA/TEGDMA dental composites.278 The results indicated that these fibers not only improved the flexural strength and flexural modulus of the composites, but also exhibited sustained fluoride release, which was helpful in preventing secondary caries. The electrospun PAN nanofibers could also be used as interlaminar layers for the improvement of the impact properties. Molnar et al. deposited PAN nanofibers directly on the surface of carbon fabrics by a needleless electrospinning technique and applied these composites to reinforce epoxy.279 Compared to the neat composite without PAN nanofibers, the hybrid PAN/carbon/epoxy composites showed an increase in absorbed energy to maximum force by 64%. Recently, Herwan et al. interleaved electrospun PAN nanofibers to fabricate carbon fiber reinforced polymer pin joined composite laminates.280 The composites showed improved load bearing strength by 18.9%, flexural modulus by 20.9% and flexural strength by 55.91%. A similar adhesive joint reinforced by electrospun PAN nanofibers was reported by Razavi et al.281 In their report, the PAN nanofibers with 362 nm average diameter resulted in a maximum improvement of 127% in the mode I fracture energy of the adhesive by incorporating 2 g m−2 of PAN nanofibers into the adhesive layer. Neisiany et al. prepared electrospun functionalized PAN grafted glycidyl methacrylate (PAN-g-GMA) nanofibers and incorporated them between the plies to improve the interfacial adhesion.282 The grafting strategy led to the stronger interactions between nanofibers and the epoxy matrix, which gave rise to better mechanical properties of the composites.
5.3 Electrospun polyimide (PI) nanofiber reinforced composites
Polyimide (PI) is a well-known high performance material with excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Previous studies indicated that depending on the molecular structures, the aligned electrospun PI nanofiber belt could have superior tensile strength (1.3 GPa) (Fig. 15A),283 high modulus (13 GPa),284 excellent elongation at break (202%),285 and toughness (82 J g−1).283 Hou's group investigated the mechanical properties of single electrospun PI nanofibers by a novel microtensile test method.192,202 The single PI nanofibers based on 3,3′,4,4′-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride and p-phenylenediamine with diameters of around 300 nm had a tensile strength, tensile modulus and elongation at break of 1.7 GPa, 76 GPa and 3%, respectively (Fig. 15B).202 In another report, they demonstrated that the single co-PI nanofiber with an average diameter of 251 nm showed a similar tensile strength of 1.7 GPa, smaller modulus of 37 GPa and much higher elongation at break of 7.5%.192 Recently, Jiang et al. reported that the single PI electrospun fibers with a diameter around 220 nm could reach a superior tensile strength of 2865 MPa and a modulus of 130 GPa.179 The possible reason for the high mechanical performance of electrospun PI nanofibers could be the high molecular orientation along the fiber axis, which was proved recently by polarized Raman spectroscopy.179 All these above examples prove that electrospun PI nanofibers could be ideal candidates as reinforcements.

Chen et al. used the polymer melt infiltration lamination method to prepare aligned electrospun PI nanofiber reinforced nylon-6 composites.192 Up to 50 wt% of aligned PI nanofibers could be incorporated into the matrix and led to about 700% of tensile strength and 500% of modulus improvements in comparison with the pure nylon-6. Chang et al. modified the surface of azide-decorated electrospun PI nanofibers by atom transfer radical polymerization and “click” chemistry.286 These surface-modified nanofibers exhibited a more significant mechanical enhancement compared to that with unmodified PI nanofibers. The different solubilities that the precursor of PI (polyamic acid) can be dissolved in DMF and DMAc while PI cannot be, make it possible to prepare self-reinforced PI composites. Liu's group prepared CNT reinforced aligned PI composite nanofibers and used these fibers to reinforce the PI film.287 The results indicated that the CNTs were well dispersed and highly oriented along the fiber axis and 2 wt% of CNT/PI fibers remarkably increases the tensile strength and elongation at break by 138% and 104%, respectively, as compared to the neat PI film. Kausar et al. used the same strategy to prepare well-aligned electrospun poly(azo-naphthyl-imide) (PANI) and PANI/MWCNT nanofiber reinforced PI composites.288 SEM and TEM indicated the uniform alignment of nanofibers in the matrix. The composite reinforced with PANI/MWCNT nanofibers showed a higher tensile strength (304.6 MPa) than that of the composite reinforced with only PANI nanofibers (245.9 MPa). Recently, Shen et al. assessed the effect of the amount of electrospun PI nanofibers on the reinforcement and the permittivity of PI/PVDF composites. On increasing the amount of aligned PI nanofibers, the tensile strength, tensile modulus and toughness of the composites increased. The tensile strength and modulus along the longitudinal direction were 743% and 449% higher than that of pure PVDF, respectively, which were achieved by adding 50 wt% of aligned PI nanofibers.289
5.4 Electrospun carbon nanofiber reinforced composites
Carbon nanofibers could be easily prepared from electrospun PAN and its copolymer nanofibers followed by thermal treatments, carbonization and graphitization. The electrospun carbon nanofibers had excellent mechanical strength and tensile modulus. Hou's group devoted much effort on the mechanical properties of electrospun carbon nanofiber bundles (ECNFB). The aligned ECNFB from a pure PAN nanofiber precursor showed a tensile strength of 550 MPa and a Young's modulus of 58 GPa.290 By using phosphoric acid as the stabilization promoter, the tensile strength of the aligned ECNFB increased to 969 MPa.291 Recently, they prepared ECNFB from poly(acrylonitrile-co-monobutylitaconate-co-n-butylacrylate) (co-PAN) with different amounts of monobutyl itaconate (MBI).155 The incorporation of MBI significantly improved the stabilization of co-PAN nanofibers and promoted the formation of ordered graphite crystals in aligned ECNFB. The fibers obtained from co-PAN with 5 wt% MBI showed a tensile strength and Young's modulus of 1.8 and 97 GPa, respectively. Due to the very brittle nature of electrospun carbon nanofibers, it is a challenge to obtain the mechanical properties of single carbon nanofibers directly by the tensile test. Zussman et al. firstly demonstrated the tensile strength (0.32–0.9 GPa) and average Young's modulus (63 GPa) of PAN-derived single electrospun carbon nanofibers by AFM.247 Later, Arshad et al. adopted a microelectromechanical (MEMS)-based nanoscale testing platform equipped with high resolution optics for measuring the mechanical properties of single electrospun carbon nanofibers.248 Their results indicated that the PAN-based single ECNF had a tensile strength of 3.5 GPa and an elastic modulus of 172 GPa through optimizing the electrospinning parameters, stabilization and the carbonization process.
Therefore, ECNFs with superior tensile strength and modulus would have good potential for the preparation of ECNF reinforced composites. However, there were few reports regarding the fabrication of ECNF reinforced composites. One of the report came from Dzenis and Wen in 2001.292 They prepared PAN-based continuous and uniform ECNFs with a diameter in the range from 100 to 500 nm and applied these ECNFs to reinforce the epoxy resin. Later, a series of studies have been done to reinforce the epoxy resin by ECNFs. In 2009, Sancaktar et al. prepared epoxy composites reinforced by a ECNF mat and short ECNF, respectively.293 The results indicated that the composites loading with the ECNF mat had better mechanical properties than those with short ECNFs due to the better homogeneity of the mat in the resin. Fong's group devoted attention to the development of hybrid multi-scale epoxy composites reinforced by hybrid reinforcements with conventional carbon fiber fabrics and ECNF mats.294–296 When the epoxy composites were reinforced by conventional carbon fiber fabrics (CFFs) with interlaminar regions comprising ECNF mats, the composites showed 86% higher interlaminar shear strength than those of comparison composites without ECNF mats.294 In another report, they applied a vacuum assisted resin transfer molding technique to prepare epoxy composites reinforced by CFFs surface-attached with ECNF mats.295 Compared to the traditional CFF/epoxy composites, the hybrid CFF/ECNF/epoxy composites showed better out-of-plane mechanical properties.294 Recently in 2014, they compared the mechanical properties of epoxy composites reinforced by ECNFs, hybrid multi-scale ECNFs/CFFs, vapor growth carbon nanofibers (VGCNFs) and graphite carbon nanofibers (VCNFs).296 ECNFs presented a similar reinforcing effect with VGCNFs, but higher than that of GCNFs. A small amount of ECNFs (0.1 wt% and 0.3 wt%) led to the improvements in impact absorption energy, inter-laminar shear strength and flexural properties for both ECNF/epoxy and CFF/ECNF/epoxy composites. In 2016, Alarifi et al. studied the mechanical and thermal properties of carbon fiber reinforced composites using electrospun nanofibers as interlayers by unidirectional pre-preg carbon fiber stacking.297 The thermal mechanical analysis exhibited an obvious reinforcement due to the enhanced interfacial bonding between the nanofibers and the matrix.
5.5 Electrospun cellulose nanofiber reinforced composites
Cellulose is one of the most abundant natural, renewable and biodegradable polymers. Due to the high aspect ratio and robust mechanical strength and modulus, electrospun cellulose nanofibers (ECLNFs) have been extensively investigated as reinforcements to prepare fully biodegradable composites.298,299 Han et al. optimized the electrospinning conditions of the cellulose/N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) solutions and applied the ECLNFs to make poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) biocomposites.300 The ultrafine cellulose nanofibers with an average diameter of 560 nm were successfully fabricated from 7 wt% cellulose (DP = 700) solution at 100 °C by applying a positive voltage of 30 kV, working distance of 15 cm and flow rate of 3 mL h−1. The obtained ECLNFs exhibited reinforcement in the cellulose/PBS composites that the storage modulus of the composites was 67% higher than that of the neat PBS matrix. Kowalczyk et al. prepared all biodegradable PLA composites reinforced by cellulose fibers.301 Both ECLNFs and dry-wet-spun cellulose microfibers were applied to prepare composites and the properties of these two types of composites were compared. Compared to the pure PLA and the composites reinforced with cellulose microfibers, the composites reinforced by 2 and 20 wt% ECLNFs exhibited obviously a higher storage modulus. Due to the small size of the nanofibers, the voids around the cellulose nanofibers in the nanocomposites were greatly smaller than those around the microfibers as shown in Fig. 16A and B.

Due to the ultrafine size of ECLNF with a diameter smaller than the wavelength of visible light, Liu's group devoted much effort to make transparent ECLNF reinforced composites. In 2008, Chen and Liu fabricated ECLNF mat reinforced soybean protein isolate (SPI) transparent composites.302 The strong interfacial interactions at the ECLNF/SPI interface led to a significant improvement of the mechanical strength and Young's modulus (13 and 6 times, respectively more than the pure SPI film with the incorporation of 20 wt% of ECLNF in the SPI matrix). Due to the ultrafine diameter of ECLNF, the composites were transparent with above 75% light transmittance at 700 nm. A substantially decreased swelling ratio of the composites from 106 to 22% was observed when the amount of ECLNF increased from 0 to 20 wt%. Tang and Liu studied the effect of the amount of ECLNF on the visible light transparency and mechanical properties of ECLNF reinforced PVA composites (Fig. 17).184 The optimized amount of ECLNF was found to be 40 wt%, at which the composites showed a visible light transmittance of 75%, and in comparison with the pure PVA film, the tensile strength and Young's modulus were increased by 50 and 600%, respectively. Later, they investigated the influence of fiber surface and fiber size on the interfacial adhesion and optical and mechanical properties of ECLNF/PVA composites.303 They found that the electrospun cellulose nanofibrous mat reinforced PVA film showed better interfacial adhesion, higher optical transparency and mechanical properties than those of electrospun cellulose acetate nanofibrous mat reinforced composites. In another two reports, Liao and Liu et al. prepared ECLNF reinforced epoxy transparent composites and demonstrated the effect of the fiber alignment, fiber surface and roughness on the interfacial structures and mechanical reinforcement of the composites.304,305 The aligned ECLNF reinforced epoxy composites exhibited increased mechanical strength and Young's modulus by 71 and 61%, respectively, in comparison with the composite film reinforced with 20 wt% randomly deposited fibers.304 They concluded that the interfacial adherence played an important role in the transparency and mechanical properties of the composites.305 Higher optical light transparency and better mechanical properties could be achieved in the composites with strong interfacial adhesion.

5.6 Electrospun ceramic nanofiber reinforced composites
Electrospinning combined with the sol–gel process could be used to fabricate electrospun ceramic nanofibers.306,307 Due to the excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability and chemical erosion resistance, electrospun ceramic nanofibers were used as reinforcements to make composites, especially for dental applications.308 In 2012, Guo et al. fabricated dental composites reinforced with zirconia-silica (ZS) or zirconia-yttria-silica (ZYS) nanofibers.309 The nanofibers with a mean diameter of 190 nm were prepared by a reactive electrospinning sol–gel method followed by calcinations. The results indicated that 2.5 or 5% of ZS or ZYS nanofibers could greatly increase the flexural strength, flexural modulus and energy at break and all ZS nanofiber reinforced composites showed high fracture toughness compared to the control composites only with glass particle fillers. However, due to the mismatch of the refractive index between the fibers and the matrix, the composites showed problems of light scattering and opacity.309 To solve these problems, Li et al. prepared silica shell yttria stabilized zirconia core fibers by coaxial electrospinning.310 The silica shell guaranteed the matched refractive index with resin matrix, which improved the light transmittance of the composites. The composites with a small amount of core–shell fibers (2.5 wt%) possessed the highest flexural strength (145 MPa), which was 41.6% improvement compared to the control composites. Recently, Rameshbabu et al. investigated the effect of alumina microfibers (AMFs), silk microfibers (SMFs) and ceria nanofibers (CRNFs) as fillers in the BIS-GMA/TEGDMA dental matrix.311 10% AMFs, 5% SMFs and 3.33% CRNFs led to a similar degree of conversion of monomers and significantly improved the mechanical properties compared with the control BIS-GMA/TEGDMA sample. However, the composites with CRNFs showed less mechanical improvements than with AMFs and SMFs, which could be attributed to the less fiber amount, the aggregation of nanofibers and the improper distribution of the fibers. Besides dental composites, electrospun ceramic nanofibers are also used to fabricate bio-nanocomposites and nano-epoxy composites. Khalil et al. prepared titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanofibers with diameters of 50–400 nm to improve the fracture toughness of hydroxyapatite (HAp).312 5 wt% of TiO2 in the HAp composites showed bending and compressive strength of 119 and 120 MPa, respectively. Chen et al. used electrospun glass nanofibers (EGNFs) to reinforce or toughen epoxy and investigated the effect of the silanization treatment and the mass fraction on the mechanical properties of the composites.313 A better toughening effect and a higher degree of reinforcement effect were achieved by the silanized EGNFs with epoxy end groups and with amine end groups, respectively. 1% of the reinforcement could improve the tensile strength, Young's modulus, work of fracture and impact strength of the composites by up to 40, 201, 67 and 363%, respectively. Later, they applied the technique of vacuum assisted resin transfer molding to fabricate hybrid multi-scale composites from glass microfiber fabrics and electrospun glass nanofibers (EGNFs) with epoxy resins.314 The loading of a small amount of EGNFs (0.25 wt%) in the hybrid composites led to substantial improvements in the mechanical properties, particularly out-of-plane mechanical properties.
5.7 Electrospun biodegradable nanofiber reinforced composites
Electrospun biodegradable polymer nanofibers have attracted a lot of attention due to their biocompatibility and environment friendly characteristics which have been broadly applied in tissue engineering, drug release and wound dressing.50,315 So far, the main work regarding electrospun biodegradable polymers is focused on synthetic materials, such as PLA and PCL. Previous studies showed that these electrospun biodegradable polymer nanofibers possessed excellent mechanical properties and were good candidates as reinforcements.

5.7.1 Electrospun PLA nanofiber reinforced composites. 
Tan and Lim studied the elastic modulus of single electrospun PLA nanofibers by the three-point bend test and nanoindentation performed on an AFM.249,250 Both methods showed that the elastic modulus of single PLA nanofibers with a diameter less than 350 nm was about 1.0 GPa and decreased by increasing the fiber diameter more than 350 nm. Another two studies by Ryuji et al.251 and Li et al.252 revealed that the higher take-up velocity led to a more packed internal structure and enhanced the tensile properties of the single PLA nanofibers. Single PLA nanofibers with a take-up velocity of 630 m min−1 possessed a tensile modulus of 2.9 GPa and a tensile strength of 183 MPa, which were 0.9 GPa and 94 MPa higher than that of the fiber with 63 m min−1 take-up velocity, respectively.251 Another research has indicated that the increase in the take-up velocity led to an obvious decrease of fiber diameters and an increase of the tensile modulus from 1.82 GPa (630 m min−1) to 5.04 GPa (1890 m min−1) and the tensile strength from 48.39 MPa (630 m min−1) to 195.2 MPa (1890 m min−1).252 However, to the best of our knowledge from the available literature, only a few reports regarding the electrospun PLA nanofiber reinforced composites are available. Dong et al. investigated the potential use of electrospun PLA nanofibers to reinforce epoxy.316 The pilot study showed an increase by 50.8% and 24.0% of the flexural moduli of the composites with 5 and 10 wt% PLA nanofibers, respectively. In another report, Chen et al. proposed a novel strategy to prepare PLA/PCL composites (Fig. 18).317 They compared the reinforcing effect of the composites reinforced by pure PLA fiber mats and PLA/PCL blend fibers and found that the latter blend fibers had a better reinforcing effect on PCL due to the improvement of the affinity of the minor PCL component in the electrospun blend fibers.

5.7.2 Electrospun PCL nanofiber reinforced composites. 
Single electrospun PCL nanofibers exhibit a tensile modulus, tensile strength and strain at break of 120 ± 30 MPa, 40 ± 10 MPa and 200 ± 100%, respectively, which are good reinforcements to reinforce or toughen other materials.253 Dan et al. prepared hybrid gelatin hydrogels by incorporating electrospun PCL/gelatin blend or coaxial nanofibers for tissue engineering application.318 The composite hydrogels were stable due to the cross-linking between PCL fibers and gelatin gels (Fig. 19A and B). The resultant composite hydrogels exhibited an increased Young's modulus from 3.29 kPa to 20.30 kPa (Fig. 19C), and were successfully applied for cell culture (Fig. 19D–F). Beachley and Wen fabricated a hybrid scaffold reinforced with electrospun degradable loose nanofibers.319 They used electrospun PCL nanofibers as a model reinforcement and gelatin as a model protein matrix, and found that the loading of PCL nanofibers enhanced the strength of the dry and hydrated gelatin films. A similar method was adopted by Thorvaldsson et al.320 They prepared nanofiber reinforced hydrogel scaffolds for nucleus pulposus regeneration by combining the electrospinning and electrospraying techniques. The incorporated small amount of electrospun PCL nanofibers led to a mechanical enhancement in the gellan gum hydrogels. Jang et al. treated the PCL nanofibers with ethanol by coaxial electrospinning to improve the wettability of the fibers and hydrogel solution.321 The composite gel was prepared based on the layer-by-layer procedure with the electrospinning of the nanofibers and the spreading of the hydrogel solution. The resulted composite hydrogel exhibited enhanced compressive strength and stiffness by 221% and 434% compared to the neat hydrogel, respectively.

Electrospun PCL nanofibers could be used as interlayers in the composites. Zhang et al. directly deposited electrospun nanofibers on carbon fiber fabrics to toughen carbon/epoxy composites.322 They compared the toughening effect of electrospun PCL, PVDF and PAN nanofibers as interlayers and found that only electrospun PCL nanofibers had a toughening effect on the composites. Saghafi et al. investigated the impact response of glass/epoxy laminates with electrospun PCL nanofibers as interlayers.323 Their results indicated that the interleaving had a negligible effect on the impact parameters, but could significantly decrease the damaged area.
Recently, Guo et al. fabricated a high strength, elastic and biocompatible PCL/PU composite vascular graft (Fig. 20A) by electrospinning followed by pulling out the tube.324 The vascular graft showed good mechanical properties, and could hold a weight of 426 g (Fig. 20B and C). 10 wt% of PCL could lead to the best improvement in the tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation at break (Fig. 20D). The composite with 25 wt% of PCL could withstand expansion and contraction for more than fifteen cycles (Fig. 20E and F).

5.7.3 Electrospun other biodegradable nanofiber reinforced composites. 
Besides electrospun PLA and PCL nanofibers, electrospun gelatin nanofibers are also reported to reinforce alginate gel scaffolds for corneal tissue regeneration by Oyen's group.325,326 They prepared transparent composite hydrogels by infiltrating the electrospun gelatin nanofibers with alginate hydrogels. The composite hydrogels without cross-linking exhibited an improved tensile elastic modulus from 78 kPa to 450 kPa while the stiffer composite hydrogels with an elastic modulus of 820 kPa were obtained by cross-linking the gelatin fibers. Manh et al. applied electrospun silk nanofibers as a toughening agent for carbon fiber/epoxy composites.327 The obtained composites exhibited up to 30% enhancement in fracture toughness due to the good adhesion between matrix resin and carbon fibers. In another report, Du et al. adopted two-nozzle electrospinning to prepare silver nanoparticle/PVA/PCL biocomposites for wound dressing.328 The composites showed a tensile strength of 4.27 MPa, and elongation at break of 88%, which are suitable for wound dressing.

5.8 Other electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites
Besides using the electrospun nylon, PAN, PI, carbon, cellulose, PLA, PCL, and ceramic nanofibers as reinforcements, some special electrospun nanofibers are also used as reinforcements for different applications, which will be introduced in the following.

5.8.1 Short electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites. 
Short fibers applied for reinforcing polymer composites have a fiber length to diameter ratio much less than that of the continuous long fibers. Compared to continuous fibers, short fibers have many advantages for preparing composites.329–331 Short fibers can be prepared from many resources, such as natural polymers, aramid polymers, nylons, carbon, glass and the offcut of the long fibers/fiber textiles. The amount of the short fibers in the composites can be pre-calculated, which means that ahead of the fabrication of the composites, a precise amount of short fibers can be incorporated into the composites. Short fibers can be easily incorporated into the polymer matrix and flexible design methods can be applied to prepare short fiber reinforced composites. There are many reports regarding traditional short microfiber reinforced composites.231,233,236,238–241,332 However, very few literature reports are available regarding the preparation of short electrospun nanofibers and their composites. The short electrospun nanofibers could be made by direct electrospinning,333,334 UV cutting,335 electric spark336 and mechanical cutting.117,217,242,337,338 Compared to the other three methods, mechanical cutting is a simple post-treating method on the as-electrospun long and continuous nanofibers. The resulted short electrospun nanofibers have been applied for the preparation of ultralight and soft sponges117 and nanofiber reinforced composites.217,242 Based on the different solubilities of polyamic acid (PAA) and polyimide (PI), we prepared self-reinforced PI composites reinforced by short electrospun PI nanofibers (Fig. 21).217 Normal electrospinning and mechanical cutting were applied to fabricate the short PI nanofibers. The PI composites were prepared by imidization of the dispersion of short PI nanofibers in the PAA solution, the precursor of PI. Compared to the pure PI film, 2 wt% of short PI nanofibers led to the improvement of the tensile strength and modulus by 53 and 87%, respectively, while the same improvement in the tensile strength required 38 wt% of continuously long fibers. In another report, the short electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers with diameters less than 200 nm were prepared as reinforcements to make highly transparent PMMA and TPU composites.242 Compared to the neat PMMA film, the PMMA composite films with 2.5 wt% loading of short nylon-6 nanofibers exhibited an improvement in the tensile strength and E modulus by 18.7 and 23.4%, respectively. The best mechanical enhancement of TPU composites was achieved by adding 3.5 wt% of short nylon-6 nanofibers, so that the tensile strength, E modulus and toughness were increased by 30%, 185% and 35%, respectively. The difference reinforcing effect on the PMMA and TPU composites could be attributed to the interfacial adhesion between the reinforcing nanofibers and the matrix polymers. Due to the ultrafine diameter of the nanofibers and the small refractive index, both PMMA and TPU composites showed high light transmittance in the visible light range.

5.8.2 Electrospun polybenzimidazole (PBI) nanofiber reinforced composites. 
Polybenzimidazole (PBI) is a class of high performance polymers with excellent mechanical properties. Kim et al. used electrospun PBI nanofibers (average diameter of 300 nm) to reinforce rubber, which led to a ten times improvement in the tensile modulus.339 However, because of the poor solubility of PBI in common solvents, it is difficult to fabricate electrospun PBI nanofibers and also their composites.


5.8.3 Electrospun composite nanofiber reinforced composites. 
Electrospun nanofibers could be reinforced with TiO2 particles, MWCNTs and graphene nanoplatelets, and these composite nanofibers would effectively improve the mechanical properties of the composites.340–343 Nepplli et al. found that the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles modified the roughness of the electrospun PS composite fibers and therefore influenced the interfacial adhesion between the composite fibers and the matrix.340 In other reports, MWCNT reinforced polyurethane nanofibers,341 PMMA fibers342 and P(St-co-GMA) nanofibers343 were prepared by electrospinning, and the resulted electrospun composite nanofibers were used to reinforce silicon film, PCL and epoxy, respectively.


5.8.4 Others. 
Polyurethane and PVDF are flexible materials, and their electrospun nanofibers are used to make flexible aerogel composites for thermal insulation applications.344,345 Wu et al. prepared flexible silica aerogel composites by electrospinning and sol–gel processing.344 The effect of electrospun nanofibers, microparticles and the combined nanofibers and microparticles on the morphology and thermal and mechanical properties of the aerogel composites were investigated and the results indicated that the electrospun PVDF nanofibers greatly improved the mechanical strength and the flexibility of the SiO2 aerogels and the PVDF/SiO2 composite aerogels had the lowest thermal conductivity.344 In order to overcome the disadvantages such as high fragility and poor mechanical strength, Li et al. incorporated electrospun polyurethane nanofibers in the cast sol film prior to the gelation of the silica-based gel and the results showed that the nanofibers in the aerogel composites did not change the thermal conductivity and made the composite bendable and flexible.345
Although PMMA nanofibers are well-known fragile materials and seldom applied as reinforcements, there are also reports on using electrospun PMMA nanofibers to reinforce epoxy and self-reinforced composites. Iyengar et al. fabricated electrospun PMMA nanofiber reinforced epoxy composites and investigated their shape-memory properties.346 The randomly distributed PMMA nanofibers could increase the tensile strength and Young's modulus and decrease the glass transition temperature of the composites.346 Matabola et al. prepared single polymer composites of PMMA reinforced by press-molded electrospun PMMA nanofiber mats and PMMA matrix sheets.347 The effect of the fiber diameter on the dynamic mechanical properties of the composites was investigated. Compared to the neat PMMA matrix, the composite showed a pronounced improvement in the dynamic mechanical properties and glass transition temperatures with about 10 wt% nanofiber loading.347

6 Factors affecting the properties of electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites
Nanofibers, polymer matrix and the interface between the fibers and the matrix are three important components affecting the properties of nanofiber reinforced polymer composites. The fibers in the fiber reinforced polymer composites play an important role in imparting their excellent properties, especially mechanical properties, to the polymer matrix. The interface is the bridge to transfer the load between the fibers and the polymer matrix. The distribution of the fibers in the matrix has an effect on the isotropic or anisotropic properties of the composites. Therefore, the factors related to the above three points would greatly affect the properties of the nanofiber reinforced polymer composites.
6.1 Mechanical performance of fibers
The fibers in the composites as reinforcements provide their high tensile strength, high E modulus or toughness, and excellent thermal stability to the polymer matrix. Therefore, the mechanical performance of the fibers plays an important role in the reinforcing effect. Compared to microfibers and films, electrospun nanofibers show much better mechanical properties due to their stronger orientations of molecules and crystals and the much less drawbacks in the nanofibers. Fig. 22 presents a comparison of the mechanical strength and modulus between the polymer films, microfibers and single nanofibers. The PLA and nylon-6 microfibers exhibited a larger tensile modulus and tensile strength than those of the films while the largest mechanical properties were obtained from the corresponding single electrospun nanofibers.191,194,198,252,348,349 Similarly, the same trend is also observed in PI. The PI film showed mechanical properties with tensile strength and modulus of 230 MPa and 2.5 GPa, while the PI microfiber showed 310 MPa and 15 GPa, respectively.350 However, the single electrospun PI nanofibers exhibited the best mechanical properties with the tensile strength and modulus reaching up to 2387 MPa and 43 GPa, respectively.192

6.2 Fiber diameters
Fiber diameter plays a significant role in the properties of fiber reinforced composites. When the fiber diameter decreased from the micrometer scale to the nanometer scale, the tensile strength, tensile modulus and toughness would increase dramatically.189,191,194,198,199,200–202 This effect provides an efficient way to prepare electrospun nanofibers with excellent mechanical properties for reinforcements by adjusting the electrospinning conditions. Also, fibers with fine diameters are helpful to prepare transparent fiber reinforced composites. When the fiber diameter is smaller than 400 nm, less refraction of the visible light with wavelengths from 400–700 nm on the fiber/matrix interfaces would lead to better optical transparency.102,184–188 The small fiber diameter is also beneficial to decrease the pore size and drawbacks around the fiber/matrix interface and improves the reinforcement of fiber reinforced composites.183
6.3 Fiber amount
Previous reports revealed that the amount of electrospun nanofibers in the composites had a significant effect on the properties of the composites and the properties are maximum at the optimized fiber amount. Depending on the fabrication method, the optimized fiber amount could be different. Our group developed several methods to prepare electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites. By the simple dip-coating method to prepare electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber reinforced melamine-formaldehyde (MF) composites, 13 wt% of nylon-6 nanofibers provided the best improvement in the mechanical strength.103 However, the filtration method in which the resin solution (MF solution) was passed through the reinforcing fiber mat of nylon-6 showed an improvement in mechanical properties at very high amounts of the reinforcing fibers (66 wt%).103 By the way, the fiber amount also had a significant effect on the optical transparency of the composites. A larger amount of nanofibers would create more interfaces between the fiber/matrix and led to more reflection of the visible light, which decreased the transparency of the composites (Fig. 23).

In another report, we designed a novel layer-by-layer procedure including film casting, electrospinning and film stacking to prepare electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber reinforced thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composites.104 With this method, a very small amount (0.4–3.4 wt%) of nanofibers could lead to great improvement in mechanical properties and the optimum properties were achieved at 1.7 wt% of nanofibers and the tensile strength, modulus, elongation at break and toughness were improved by 97, 30, 92 and 154%, respectively.104 The dispersion of short electrospun nanofibers into the matrix solution provided a pre-designed way on the fiber amount in the resultant composites.217,242 Short electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers were used to make composites with pre-designed amounts of 1.0, 2.5, 3.5 and 5.0 wt% in the TPU matrix and 3.5 wt% of the reinforcing short fibers was found to be the optimum amount for the best reinforcing effect.242 In addition, short electrospun PI nanofibers were used to fabricate self-reinforced PI composites.217 Different pre-calculated amounts of short PI nanofibers were first dispersed in the precursor PAA solution. After film casting and thermal imidization, the self-reinforced PI composites with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 wt% of short PI nanofibers were obtained. The 2 wt% short PI nanofibers led to 53 and 87% improvement in tensile strength and modulus, respectively, compared to the neat PI film (Fig. 24).217

6.4 Fiber/matrix interfacial interaction
The fiber/matrix interface plays an important role in transferring the load from the fibers to the matrix. Strong interfacial interactions between fiber/matrix lead to enhanced mechanical properties. The fiber/matrix interfacial interaction could be evaluated by the fiber pull-out test, single filament critical length method, short beam shear test, microdebonding test, and so on.351–353 In applications, several strategies were applied to enhance the fiber/matrix interfacial interaction, such as:
(1) Self-reinforced composites.217,287,347,354 Due to the same or similar chemical structures, superior interface interaction between the nanofibers and the matrix would be obtained. It is well known that the PI and its precursor, PAA, have quite different solubilities in organic solvents, such as DMF, DMAc, etc., which makes it possible to prepare self-reinforced PI composites. Jiang et al. prepared self-reinforced PI/PI composites by dispersing short electrospun PI nanofibers into the PAA/DMF solution followed by film casting and imidization (Fig. 25).217 53% and 87% improvement in tensile strength and modulus by 2 wt% short PI nanofibers were achieved due to the enhanced interfacial interaction, respectively. Chen et al. applied a similar method to fabricate self-reinforced PI films by using aligned pure PI and PI/CNT composite nanofibers (Fig. 25).287 The aligned PI nanofibers and PI/CNT composite nanofibers led to 97% and 138% improvement in tensile strength along the fiber alignment which could be attributed to the good compatibility and the high alignment of the PI nanofibers (Fig. 25).287 In another report, Chang et al. prepared electrospun high melting point polyurethane (PUH) composite nanofibers reinforced with functionalized CNTs as reinforcements to reinforce low melting point PU (PUL).354 An 187% increase in the tensile modulus was achieved by 30 wt% composite PUH nanofibers due to the high compatibility of the fibers and matrix. In addition, single component PMMA composites self-reinforced by PMMA nanofibers with different diameters were fabricated by Matabola et al.347 The DMA showed pronounced improvement in the storage modulus of the composites.

(2) Coaxial electrospinning. Coaxial electrospinning is an effective method to enhance the interfacial interaction between fiber/matrix. By coaxial electrospinning, the reinforcement could be encapsulated in the core while the shell polymer could be the same as the matrix polymer or highly compatible with the matrix to improve the interfacial interaction. Huang's group fabricated electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber reinforced PMMA composites by stacking the nylon-6/PMMA core/shell nanofiber mat followed by hot press treatment.188 Only 2.5 wt% nylon-6 nanofibers led to the mechanical enhancement with a slight sacrifice of transparency.188 Later, they conducted a comparison study on the fabricating methods between the above method and the method by stacking and hot pressing the multilayers of PMMA and nylon-6 nanofiber mat.257 The results indicated that the coaxial fiber based composites had better interface between fiber/matrix, lower drawback amount and more uniform fiber distribution, which led to better mechanical improvement. Lin et al.276 and Cheng et al.278 prepared PAN/PMMA core/shell nanofibers by coaxial electrospinning and applied them to reinforce BIS-GMA/TEGDMA dental resin. The incorporation of the coaxial nanofibers led to an enhancement in flexural strength, flexural modulus and work of fracture, which could be attributed to the semi-interpenetrating polymer network structures between the fibers and the matrix. In order to improve the interface adhesion of the composites, Oh et al. designed a core/shell structure of meta-aramide/epoxy nanofibers with polymer blends by coaxial electrospinning and found that the improvement in the adhesion strength was due to the in situ nanointerface core/shell structure formation.355
(3) Physical interaction. The interfacial interactions could be improved by physical interaction between electrospun nanofibers and matrices. Our group found the intermolecular interaction between the electrospun nylon-6 nanofibers and the TPU matrix by the confirmation of H-bonding from FT-IR spectra (Fig. 26A and B), which would effectively transfer the load from the fibers to the TPU matrix.104,242 As a comparison, the nylon-6/PMMA composites without H-bonding showed negligible enhancement of mechanical properties (Fig. 26C).242

In order to improve the interface adhesion between the fibers and the matrix, Meng et al. grew thorns on the surface of electrospun nanofibers (Fig. 27A) to form a new 3D architecture, and applied this 3D thorn-like micro/nanofibers (Fig. 27B and C) as reinforcements to reinforce composites and toughen the epoxy.356,357 By varying the processing time and the temperature, the fiber structure and the length of the thorns could be controlled. These thorn-like fibers could interlock the matrix molecules and formed a stronger fiber/matrix interface. The composites reinforced by these fibers exhibited improved flexural properties and storage modulus.

In another report, Liao et al. investigated the effect of the chemistry and toughness of the fiber surface on the fiber/matrix interface and the mechanical and optical properties of the composites by comparing the composites reinforced by the electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) fibers with rough surface, PU fibers with smooth surface and CAPU composite fibers with continuous rough surfaces (Fig. 28A–C).305 The strong interfacial adhesion was formed for the rough fiber reinforced composites while the smooth PU fiber reinforced composites showed severe interfacial debonding and pulled out fibers from the analysis of the fractured surfaces of the composites by SEM (Fig. 28D and E).

(4) Chemical modification. Chemical modification of the electrospun nanofibers has been applied to improve the interface interaction between fibers/matrix. In order to obtain good interfacial adhesion, Lee's group treated the electrospun cellulose fibers with alkali and prepared all cellulose composites with cellulose diacetate as the matrix.299 They found that the alkali treatment could remove the acetyl groups and create new crystalline domains and 15 wt% of the fibers treated for 7 h resulted in increased tensile strength and modulus by 1.7- and 2.2-fold, respectively. Chen et al. modified the electrospun glass nanofibers by silanization treatment and investigated the effect of the modification on the strength, stiffness and toughness of the resulting epoxy composites.313 Compared to the untreated glass fibers, the modified glass nanofibers showed better reinforcement on the composites. 1 wt% addition of treated glass nanofibers with amine groups improved the elastic moduli by 201% and work of fracture by 22%, while the same amount of untreated fibers improved them by 33% and 52%, respectively. This difference in the reinforcing effect could be due to the strong fiber/matrix interfacial bonding from the chemical bonds between the amine functional groups on the electrospun glass nanofibers and the epoxy molecules. Papila's group devoted their efforts on designing the chemistry and surface of the electrospun nanofibers by cross-linking between the fibers and the polymer matrix.358 They prepared functioned polystyrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate (P(St-co-GMA))/ethylenediamine (EDA) composites by electrospinning the P(St-co-GMA) polymer solution and electrospraying the EDA. The EDA played a role as a cross-linker agent for the epoxy and the P(St-co-GMA)/EDA composite fiber mats enhanced the polymer–nanofiber interfacial bonding. This strategy made the storage modulus of epoxy composites reinforced by P(St-co-GMA)/EDA composite fibers 10 and 2.5 times higher than those of the neat epoxy and the composites reinforced by P(St-co-GMA) nanofibers. “Click” reaction was also used to modify the surface of electrospun nanofibers and significantly enforced the interface compatibility. Chang et al. modified the electrospun PI nanofibers with PMMA under mild conditions by “click” chemistry (Fig. 29).286 The modified PI (PI-g-PMMA) nanofibers showed a more significant reinforcing effect compared to the ungrafted PI nanofibers.

(5) Hybrid method. Guo et al. prepared styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS)/PAN core/shell fibers by electrospinning and further modified the surface of the PAN sheath with diethylenetriamine to enhance the interfacial interaction between the fibers and the epoxy (Fig. 30).359 The improved Charpy impact energy could be due to the rubbery core of the fibers and the chemical bonding between the fibers and the matrix.

6.5 Fiber alignments
The fiber alignment in the matrix determines the mechanical properties of the composites isotropically or anisotropically. Generally, the composites reinforced by the woven, nonwoven, and aligned fiber mats show anisotropic mechanical properties due to the anisotropic distribution of fibers. The mechanical properties in the planar direction (X–Y) are better than those in the Z-direction because the fibers are oriented along the X–Y plane while few fibers are aligned in the thickness direction (Z-direction). However, there are only a few reports comparing the mechanical properties in all three directions due to the quite small dimension in the Z-direction. Compared to the woven and nonwoven as reinforcements, the aligned fiber mats provided anisotropic mechanical properties not only between the X–Y plane and the Z-direction, but also between the X- and Y-direction due to the anisotropic fiber alignment. Much better mechanical properties could be achieved from aligned fibers along the longitudinal direction compared to the transverse direction. As shown in Fig. 31A and B, the electrospun aligned PI fibers in the longitudinal direction presented a strength, modulus and strain of 166 MPa, 0.61 GPa and 24.4%, respectively, which are much larger than those in the transverse direction with corresponding values of 6.3 MPa, 0.09 GPa, and 8.25%, respectively.192 In comparison, the randomly arranged PI fibers exhibited medium mechanical properties with a strength of 33.9 MPa, modulus of 0.17 GPa and strain of 19.7%. Based on the differences of the mechanical properties, the fiber alignment showed important influences on the mechanical properties of polyamide 6 (PA6) composites reinforced with aligned and randomly arranged PI nanofibers (Fig. 31A–C).192 Compared to the pure PA6 film, both aligned and randomly arranged PI nanofibers (5–50 wt%) showed a reinforcing effect on the composites. However, the composites reinforced with aligned PI nanofibers along the longitudinal direction exhibited much better mechanical enhancement than the composites reinforced with the aligned PI nanofibers along the transverse direction and with randomly arranged PI nanofibers. 465%, 44% and 151% reinforcements in the tensile strength and 479%, 167% and 187% reinforcements in the tensile modulus were achieved, respectively, by 30 wt% aligned PI nanofibers along the longitudinal and transverse direction and with randomly arranged PI nanofibers.

A similar discovery was also demonstrated by Liao et al.304 and Wu et al.186 Liao et al. used randomly and aligned electrospun cellulose nanofibers to reinforce epoxy.304 The composites reinforced with 24 wt% aligned fibers possessed a tensile strength of 33 MPa, which is nearly two-fold those with 24 wt% randomly arranged fibers. Especially in the case of aligned fibers, the composites showed a tensile strength of 35 MPa along the longitudinal direction as compared to 2.5 MPa along the transverse direction. Wu et al. applied the solution impregnation technique to prepare randomly deposited and uniaxially aligned PAN electrospun nanofiber reinforced PMMA composites and the results indicated the anisotropically reinforcement that the composites had much higher tensile strength and modulus in the longitudinal direction than in the transverse direction.186
6.6 Fiber aspect ratio
Fiber aspect ratio plays a significant role in the fiber distribution in the matrix.330,331,360,361 The optimized fiber aspect ratio is called the critical aspect ratio (Rc), which is the best value for the fiber distribution in the matrix. A higher aspect ratio than Rc leads to the aggregation and entanglement of fibers during the dispersion of short fibers into polymer solutions. A lower aspect ratio than Rc gives rise to insufficient stress transfer between the fibers and the matrix. As for the short traditional microfibers, an aspect ratio of approximately 150 is considered a critical value to make short fiber reinforced composites.331,362,363 However, due to the difficulties of processing electrospun nanofibers into short electrospun nanofibers, there are countable reports regarding the use of short electrospun nanofibers to reinforce composites and the exploration of the critical aspect ratio is still required. Our previous studies applied the mechanical cutting process to prepare short electrospun nanofibers and successfully fabricated short electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites.217,242 However, the fiber aspect ratio exhibited a broad distribution from 50–1000 and the critical aspect ratio was not investigated in these two reports.
7 Outlook
In the last few years, electrospinning technology has experienced great progress and attracted scientists from various fields. The excellent properties of electrospun nanofibers make them perfect candidates as reinforcements in composite applications. However, until now, relatively little investigation was done in electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites. For this research field, further developments are required in different aspects. (1) As reinforcements, it is necessary to prepare strong fibers with superior mechanical properties by electrospinning. Through a comparison with the high performance traditional polymer fibers, several strategies could be used to increase the mechanical properties of nanofibers. (a) Increasing the crystallinity degree of electrospun nanofibers and molecular orientation along the fiber axis by post-treatments like heat treatment, post-drawing process, etc. (b) Preparing very fine electrospun nanofibers with diameters below 250 nm is helpful to obtain much stronger and tougher nanofibers due to the size effect. (c) Making electrospun composite nanofibers reinforced by CNTs and cellulose crystals or by coaxial or triaxial electrospinning to incorporate reinforcements inside or in the middle part of the fibers. (2) Fiber/matrix interaction is quite important to prepare successful composites. However, due to the small size of electrospun nanofibers, relatively little work has been done on this topic. Generally, chemical and physical modifications could be performed on electrospun nanofibers and the polymer matrix to strengthen the fiber/matrix interaction, such as plasma treatment, surface polymerization, UV visible induced cross-linking/polymerization, physical absorption and chemical immobilization of small molecules. In addition, coaxial and triaxial electrospinning is also a good way to improve the interface interaction. Through these methods, the inside components could provide enhanced mechanical properties to the matrix while the outside components offer a good physical and chemical compatibility with the matrix. (3) Carbon fibers are well-known excellent reinforcements with ultrahigh tensile strength and E modulus. Nevertheless, the mechanical properties of electrospun carbon nanofibers did not show the expected mechanical properties as those by the chemical vapor grown method. Therefore, how to fabricate electrospun carbon nanofibers with super high tensile strength and modulus is a big challenge for researchers in polymer chemistry and polymer engineering.
Another important issue is the future trends of electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites and their practical applications at the industry scale. Although great achievements in this field have been reached, lots of problems and concerns are still existing that restrict their further developments. (1) Low productivity of electrospun nanofibers is one of the main bottlenecks in industrial applications. Although there already are many companies that fabricate different kinds of electrospinning machines around the world and several companies have announced the industrial production of electrospun nanofibers, the technology for the large scale production of nanofibers is still not mature enough. Much effort is required for the large scale production and wide industrial application of electrospun nanofibers. (2) The research on electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites has been developing for many years and a large number of articles has been published. However, there is still a long way to go to fully understand the mechanism and develop theories on electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites. (3) Systematic studies regarding the effect of the fiber aspect ratio of nanofibers on the mechanical properties of nanofiber reinforced polymer composites are strongly required. Until now, it is still a challenge to fabricate electrospun nanofibers with certain aspect ratios. It is necessary to develop a facile and fast technology to cut the electrospun nanofibers with definite aspect ratios. After solving the technical obstacle to produce electrospun nanofibers with a certain aspect ratio, it will be possible to disclose the mechanism on how the nanofiber aspect ratio affects the mechanical properties of electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites. (4) The development of a force model between the nanofibers and the matrix. It is very important to understand how the force transfers from the fibers to the matrix. In conventional fiber reinforced composites, fiber pull-out experiments are designed to obtain the corresponding information. However, because of the tiny diameter of electrospun nanofibers, it is difficult to handle single electrospun nanofibers and embed them into the matrix. Hence this topic is still a challenge, which needs efforts to be solved in the future. (5) Preparation and application of short electrospun nanofibers. Short electrospun nanofibers would be one of the solutions for wide applications as reinforcements in the future. This strategy will provide completely new fields for the application of electrospun nanofibers with advantages not only in the simple processing process but also for significant property enhancement.
8 Conclusions
Electrospinning is a facile technique to prepare fibers with diameters from tens of nanometers to several micrometers from a variety of polymers and blends with different morphologies. The electrospun nanofibers possess a high aspect ratio and high specific surface area. The polymer molecules are highly oriented along the fiber axis, which leads to the excellent mechanical properties. Electrospun nanofibers have a size effect on the mechanical properties. In addition, the electrospun nanofiber mats/membranes also possess porous structures and high porosity. All these characteristics make electrospun nanofibers an attractive choice as reinforcements for composites. Previous reports indicate that high performance electrospun nanofibers, including nylon, PAN, PI, carbon, cellulose, ceramic, PLA, PCL, gelatin, and other materials, have been successfully applied as reinforcements to produce composites. The properties of these electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites can be affected by several factors, such as the mechanical properties of nanofibers, fiber diameters, fiber amount, fiber/matrix interfacial interaction, fiber alignment, fiber aspect ratio, and so on. Although the field of electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites has been developing for many years, there are still many challenges to conquer and many issues to solve, including (1) how to fabricate electrospun nanofibers with much higher mechanical properties; (2) how to enhance and understand the fiber/matrix interfacial interactions; (3) disclosing the effect of the fiber aspect ratio and the fiber diameter on the reinforcement; (4) how to fabricate electrospun nanofiber reinforced composites in a large scale and apply them in practical uses; (5) how to reduce the cost of composite fabrications; and (6) understanding the mechanism and developing theories of the effect of electrospun nanofibers on composites.

 	Fig. 8  Simplified model of light transmitted through fiber reinforced resin. The RIs of the resin and fiber do not match. Φi is the incident light; Φt is the transmitted light. The green arrows mean reflected light at the air/resin and fiber/resin interfaces; the red arrows mean refracted light at the interfaces. Assuming that the reflected light does not go into the other end of the composite, Φt of the transmitted light through the microfiber is significantly less than Φi. Light would pass through the nanofiber without the occurrence of reflection/refraction at the fiber/resin interfaces. Reprinted with permission from ref. 184. Copyright (2008) Elsevier Ltd.
