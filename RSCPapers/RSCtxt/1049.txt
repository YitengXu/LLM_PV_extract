    , Accepted 9th July 2018First published on 11th July 2018AbstractPhotoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reduction of CO2 into chemical fuels in water is a promising route to mitigate the energy crisis and global warming issues. Herein, Ti3C2/g-C3N4 (TCCN) heterojunctions were fabricated by in situ heat treatment and were applied to PEC CO2 reduction. These heterojunctions have narrow band gaps (2.3–2.6 eV) and rich Ti3+ species, which are beneficial to the absorption of solar light and the separation of electrons and holes. Besides this, the abundant pyri-N species in the TCCN heterojunctions can adsorb CO2 molecules, which is favourable for CO2 reduction. The deposition of nanometal particles can accelerate charge transfer. In a two-electrode system of M–TCCN‖BiVO4, the total formation rate of formate and methanol was as high as 50.2 μM cm−2 h−1 (25.1 mM h−1 g−1), which is tenfold that of pristine g-C3N4. The carbon source of the products was verified by a 13CO2 labeling experiment. These heterojunctions show outstanding PEC performance and stability and are promising candidates in the solar-to-fuel engineering field.
1. Introduction
Renewable energy, such as sunlight, wind and geothermal heat, is a viable substitute for fossil fuels. Converting CO2 into chemical fuels using solar energy is considered as a sustainable avenue to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming issues in the future.1–5 In the natural photosynthesis system, green plants convert CO2 and H2O into hydrocarbons under irradiation with sunlight, which suggests that CO2 might be transformed into chemical fuels by imitating natural photosynthesis.6–8 Photocatalytic and PEC reduction of CO2 are attractive approaches to convert solar energy into renewable chemical fuels.9–15 Particularly, the PEC method is more efficient than photocatalysis because the external voltage can accelerate the transfer of charge carriers and suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.16–19 Therefore, it is feasible to construct a PEC system to generate chemical fuels by achieving the coupling of water splitting and CO2 reduction.
Graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4) has been proven to be a fascinating semiconductor for photocatalysis as it is facilely synthesized, Earth-abundant and physicochemically stable.20–25 However, bulk g-C3N4 always suffers from low electrical conductivity, low surface area and a high recombination rate of charge carriers, which confines its applications in photocatalysis.26–29 In order to obtain efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for solar fuel conversion, many strategies have been developed, for example, depositing metal nanoparticles and forming a heterojunction with other semiconductors.30–38
Ti3C2, a layered two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbide belonging to the MXenes, possesses excellent hydrophilicity and structural stability, high electrical conductivity and superior light-harvesting ability.39–44 Nevertheless, there are few reports about the application of MXenes in renewable energy conversion so far.45,46 Presumably, combining g-C3N4 and Ti3C2 to form a heterojunction might be an effective strategy to fabricate an efficient photocatalyst, which may exhibit strong light absorption ability and highly efficient charge separation in the CO2 reduction reaction.
In this work, a series of Ti3C2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions were prepared by a facile heating method and used as photocathodes in CO2 PEC reduction experiments. It is confirmed that these new TCCN heterojunctions have narrow band gaps and rich Ti3+ and pyri-N species, which are favourable for CO2 reduction. Besides this, a possible mechanism was carefully proposed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the Ti3C2 sheets
Commercially available powders of Ti, Al and graphite were used as the raw materials to synthesize the Ti3AlC2 powder. The detailed synthesis method can be found elsewhere.47,48 Then 2D Ti3C2 sheets were fabricated by selectively exfoliating the Al atoms from the Ti3AlC2 powder in aqueous HF solutions (40%) for 24 h at room temperature. The obtained Ti3C2 specimens were rinsed repeatedly with deionized water to neutral and dried under vacuum.48
2.2 Preparation of the Ti3C2/g-C3N4 (TCCN) heterojunctions
The TCCN heterojunctions were prepared by a feasible in situ heat treatment method. Briefly, 15 g thiourea with different mass content of Ti3C2 (50:1, 20:1 and 10:1) was mixed and ground in an agate mortar for 30 min to obtain a homo-disperse mixture. Subsequently, the mixture was placed into a crucible that was wrapped tightly with aluminium foil, and then annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. The obtained samples were designated as TCCN1 (50:1), TCCN2 (20:1), and TCCN3 (10:1), respectively. The pristine g-C3N4 was also prepared by the same method using thiourea as a raw material and labelled as CN.
2.3 Preparation of the CN/FTO and M–TCCN/FTO electrodes
The TCCN heterojunctions were deposited onto clean FTO glasses by an electrophoretic deposition method.44 The typical procedure was described as follows: 50 mg different samples and 10 mg iodine were dispersed into 50 mL acetone; then the particles were deposited onto the FTO glass under 20 volts provided by a DC power supply for 15 min; lastly, the metal (M = Pd, Pt, and Au) nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited by electrodeposition to obtain M–TCCN/FTO electrodes according to our previous report.19
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements and CO2 reduction experiments
The photoelectrochemical properties of the photocathodes were characterized by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E). M–TCCN/FTO, BiVO4/FTO and Ag/AgCl were employed as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively, in a three-electrode system of M–TCCN|Ag/AgCl|BiVO4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed and Mott–Schottky plots were collected under dark conditions in the three-electrode system. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded and amperometric photocurrent responses were detected in the two-electrode system of M–TCCN‖BiVO4.
The PEC reduction of CO2 experiments were performed with the two-electrode system of M–TCCN‖BiVO4 in an electrolyte of KHCO3 aqueous solution (0.1 M, pH = 6.8, 50 mL). The external voltages (−0.45 V, −0.65 V, −0.85 V and −1.05 V) were powered by a silicon solar cell. The light intensity was 200 mW cm−2 and was provided by a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300/300UV). The liquid products were identified by 1H NMR (JNM-ECS 400 MHz) spectra with water suppression, using DMSO (10 mM) and m-trihydroxybenzene (MTB, 50 mM) as internal standards.19 The gas-phase products were determined by gas chromatography (GC, CP-3380 Varian).
2.5 Morphology and structure characterization
The phase constituents of the as-prepared samples were identified by XRD (D/max-2400 Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the CN and TCCN samples was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6701F) and a field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 TF30). The chemical states of the elements in the samples were identified by XPS spectra on a Kratos AXIS Nova spectrometer (Shimazu Co., Ltd.). UV-vis absorption spectra were collected on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded by a Bruker ER200DSRC10/12 spectrometer at room temperature. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded on a FLS920 spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. N2 adsorption–desorption and CO2 sorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C and 25 °C, respectively, using a micrometrics sorption analyzer (TriStar II 3020). CO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was conducted on a TP-5080 catalyst characterization instrument with a TCD detector. Prior to the measurement, the samples were heated at 300 °C for 1 h in a helium gas environment.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the photocatalysts and photocathodes
XRD patterns of the photocatalysts are displayed in Fig. 1a. It can be clearly seen that the XRD pattern of TCCN3 has two distinct feature peaks around 13.0° and 27.4°, which correspond to the (100) and (002) planes of g-C3N4, respectively.21 The (002), (004) and (110) planes of Ti3C2 also appear and are labelled in Fig. 1a, as well.49 With increasing Ti3C2 content, the diffraction signals of the g-C3N4 nanosheets weaken, while the signals of Ti3C2 strengthen gradually. As shown in Fig. 1b, the shoulder peak at 25.3° corresponds to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2,19,50 revealing that small amounts of TiO2 were formed during the fabrication processes of the TCCN samples.

As shown in Fig. 2, the as-prepared Ti3C2 sheets (Fig. 2a) have a more obvious laminate structure than pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. 2b). It can be seen from Fig. 2c that TCCN shows a partially-covered layered structure, indicating that g-C3N4 is successfully decorated on the Ti3C2 sheets surface. As shown in Fig. 2d, the TCCN samples still retain the covered layered structure after electrodeposition onto the FTO glasses, and the thickness of the TCCN film is about 6 μm (Fig. S1†).

TEM images of the Pd–TCCN photocathode are displayed in Fig. 3 and S2.† They clearly show a heterojunction interface between the g-C3N4 and Ti3C2 phases. The high magnification TEM image shows the diffraction plane (002) of the Ti3C2 phase (Fig. 3b).45 Notably, EDS mappings reveal that the C, N, O, Ti and Pd elements are well distributed on the surface of Pd–TCCN electrode, validating that the heterojunctions were formed.

Fig. 4 and S3† show the XPS spectra of the photocathodes. According to the survey spectrum of TCCN3, the binding energy peaks of the Ti element appear in addition with those of pristine g-C3N4, indicating that the Ti3C2 species are incorporated into the g-C3N4 phase (Fig. 4a). As shown in the high resolution spectrum of Ti 2p, the binding energy peaks at 454.8 and 460.3 eV, and 458.2 and 463.7 eV are assigned to the Ti–C and the Ti–O species, respectively (Fig. S3†).45 For the C 1s spectrum of TCCN3, the peak at 286.0 eV corresponds to C–OH due to the addition of Ti3C2.36,51 Furthermore, the high resolution XPS spectra of N 1s in TCCN3 and CN were analyzed in detail. The binding energy peaks at 398.5 eV, 399.5 eV and 400.8 eV are assigned to the C–N–C (pyri-N), N–(C)3 and N–H groups, respectively (Fig. 4b).52–54 When the TCCN3 heterojunction was formed, in comparison with CN, the concentration of pyri-N increased from 45.2% to 57.2%. The presence of abundant pyri-N species in TCCN can facilitate the adsorption of CO2,51–53 and consequently enhance the activity of CO2 reduction.

Moreover, after depositing the metal NPs onto the TCCN3 electrodes, the binding energies of Pd, Au and Pt were measured. As shown in Fig. S3,† the peaks at 342.9 and 337.6 eV are assigned to the 3d orbital of Pd,55 the peaks at 83.3 and 87.0 eV belong to the 4f orbital of Au, and the peaks at 75.4 and 72.2 eV are attributed to the 4f orbital of Pt. The above results reveal that the metal NPs were deposited on the surface of the electrode, and the target M–TCCN electrodes were fabricated successfully.
In the EPR spectra (Fig. 5a), pristine g-C3N4 shows a weak signal with a Landé factor (g) of 2.004, which is derived from the unpaired electrons on the aromatic rings.20 Obviously, there are two strong signals with g = 2.004 and g = 1.94 for the TCCN heterojunctions, and the intensity of signals is gradually enhanced with an increase in Ti3C2 content. It was reported that the signal at g = 1.94 is assigned to the Ti3+ species that could provide trapping centres for charge carriers and suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.56–59

As shown in Fig. 5b, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms reveal that the surface area of TCCN enlarges gradually as the Ti3C2 content increases. The TCCN2 sample possesses the largest surface area of 28.2 m2 g−1, while TCCN3 has the smallest surface area of 17.3 m2 g−1, because pure Ti3C2 has a relatively small surface area.60 Moreover, the pore size of the mesopores gradually narrows from CN to the TCCN3 sample.
CO2 sorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the CO2 adsorption ability of the different samples. It can be seen from Fig. 5c that the adsorption capacity of the TCCN samples is superior to that of CN, implying that the TCCN heterojunctions have strong CO2 capture ability.61 CO2 TPD profiles were recorded in a helium stream and are shown in Fig. 5d. The peaks that appear around 160 °C can be assigned to the desorption signal of CO2 molecules physically adsorbed by the N species of CN.62,63 Ti3C2 itself should be inactive in the physical adsorption of CO2 and doesn’t have a peak in this region. In contrast, the TCCN heterojunctions show larger peak areas than CN, which is consistent with the results of CO2 sorption. Besides this, the desorption signals of the adsorbed CO2 appear at a high temperature, which is attributed to the strong interaction of the basic groups.31 These results suggest that the incorporation of Ti3C2 could improve the CO2 adsorption capacity of the TCCN heterojunctions.
To investigate the recombination efficiency of the photo-carriers under radiation, PL spectra of all the samples were obtained under 325 nm excitation (Fig. 6). The PL spectra evidently display emission peaks at 460 nm on account of the recombination of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs. The peak intensity of the TCCN heterojunction materials decreases rapidly in comparison with CN, suggesting that the recombination of electron–hole pairs is obviously suppressed.51 As the Ti3C2 content increases, the peak intensity reduces gradually from TCCN1 to TCCN3, which is possibly attributed to the good transfer and utilization of charge carriers in the TCCN heterojunction.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the photocathodes are displayed in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the absorption ability of TCCN3 is superior to CN due to the contribution of Ti3C2. After the deposition of the Pd NPs, the absorption ability of Pd–TCCN3 in the visible light region is obviously improved on account of the surface plasmon resonance of the metal NPs.64 In addition, the corresponding Tauc plots show that the band gap energies of the photocathodes are 2.7 eV (Pd–CN), 2.6 eV (Pd–TCCN1), 2.36 eV (Pd–TCCN2) and 2.3 eV (Pd–TCCN3), which are favourable for light absorption and photocatalytic reactions.

3.2 Photoelectrochemical properties of the photocathodes
The photoelectrochemical performance of the photocathodes is displayed in Fig. 8 and S4.† The LSV curves show that the current value of the photocathodes is almost zero under dark conditions. In contrast, the photocurrent is evidently increased with the escalation of an external voltage under light irradiation, indicating that all the photocathodes have excellent photosensitivity. Furthermore, the current of the Pd–TCCN photocathodes is higher than that of Pd–CN. This reveals that the formation of the TCCN heterojunctions can obviously improve the efficiency of charge separation and light conversion (Fig. 8a).
 Fig. 8  (a) LSV curves, (b) transient photocurrent responses, and (c) EIS Nyquist plots of the different photocathodes. 
The transient photocurrent response of the photocathodes was tested at −1.0 V in a two-electrode system and is illustrated in Fig. 8b. When the light was turned on, the current of the photocathodes rose sharply from zero to 0.7–1.0 mA. Pd–TCCN2 gives the highest current value of 0.85 mA among the four photocathodes, which might be ascribed to the proper coupling effect of Ti3C2 and g-C3N4.
The interfacial charge transfer of the photocathodes was surveyed by EIS spectra. In the Nyquist plots, a smaller semicircle represents a lower resistance (Rct) between the photocathode and the electrolyte.65 Obviously, the Rct value of M–TCCN3 is much lower than that of TCCN3 (Fig. 8c), which could be attributed to the good transfer of charge carriers on the interface of the heterojunction with the presence of the metal NPs. The Rct value of Pt–TCCN3 is larger than that of Pd–TCCN3 and Au–TCCN3, which is consistent with current data. Besides this, the positive slope of the Mott–Schottky plots suggests that the heterojunction is an n-type semiconductor (Fig. S5†). The negative flat band potential signifies that the photoelectrons in the conduction band of the TCCN heterojunctions have strong reducibility.51 Furthermore, the stability of the Pd–TCCN3 photocathode was examined by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S6†). After 100 continuous cycles, the current slightly fluctuates, indicating that the Pd–TCCN3 photocathode is fairly stable.66
3.3 Photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2
Initially, the PEC experiments were carried out with the two-electrode system of Pd–CN‖BiVO4 at an external voltage of −0.85 V (Fig. 9a). Only small amounts of HCOO− and MeOH were examined. When the Pd NP modified TCCN heterojunctions (Pd–TCCN) were used as photocathodes, the yield of HCOO− and MeOH was evidently increased. Clearly, as the Ti3C2 content increases in the TCCN heterojunction, the photocatalytic activity of the photocathodes follows the order of Pd–TCCN3 > Pd–TCCN2 > Pd–TCCN1. Among all of the photocathodes, Pd–TCCN3 exhibits the highest activity for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons at a rate of 50.2 μM cm−2 h−1 (equal to 25.1 mM h−1 g−1), which is about tenfold that of Pd–CN. The apparent quantum efficiency of the Pd–TCCN3‖BiVO4 cell is estimated to be 1.3%, which is two times that of Pd–CN. This remarkable improvement might be attributed to the synergistic effect of the pyri-N and Ti3+ species in the TCCN3 heterojunction.
 Fig. 9  The formation rate of hydrocarbons in the PEC cells: (a) for four different photocathodes at −0.85 V; and (b) for the Pd–TCCN3 photocathode at voltages of −0.45 to −1.05 V in the two-electrode system. 
In order to investigate the influence of external voltage, the PEC experiments were carried out at various voltages using Pd–TCCN3 as the optimal photocathode. As shown in Fig. 9b, when the voltage was varied, the activity for hydrocarbon evolution is in the order of −0.85 V > −1.05 V > −0.65 V > −0.45 V. The activity at −1.05 V is inferior to that at −0.85 V because more H2 is released at more negative voltages (Fig. S7†). These results reveal that a proper voltage can accelerate the CO2 reduction process, and contribute to the coupling of CO2 reduction and water splitting to generate hydrocarbons. Additionally, the selectivity of the liquid products was calculated and is listed in Table S3.† When a higher voltage was applied to the PEC cell, a higher selectivity for formic acid could be achieved in the region −0.45 V to −1.05 V.
To study the influence of different metals on the CO2 reduction reaction, the M–TCCN3 electrodes were utilized as photocathodes. Even though the Pt–TCCN3 photocathode has a larger current than Pd–TCCN3 in the LSV curves (Fig. 8a), it produces less hydrocarbon because of more H2 evolution (Fig. S8†).67 Therefore, the Pd–TCCN3 photocathode shows higher activity for hydrocarbon formation than Pt– and Au–TCCN3 due to the good matching of water splitting and CO2 reduction (Fig. 10). These results reveal that the metal Pd is more suitable for catalytic reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbons than Pt and Au.
 Fig. 10  The evolution rate of hydrocarbons for the TCCN3 and M–TCCN3 photocathodes at −0.85 V. 
Furthermore, a control experiment was conducted at −0.85 V using the TCCN photocathode. As shown in Fig. 10, certain amounts of hydrocarbon and H2 could be detected, illustrating that the heterojunction of TCCN shows intrinsic activity in CO2 reduction and water splitting. Moreover, the performance of the PEC cell of Pd–TCCN3‖BiVO4 is maintained after five-cycles (20 h), which indicates that the electrode is highly stable (Fig. S9†).
3.4 
          13CO2 labelling experiments
In order to identify the carbon source of the hydrocarbons, 13CO2 labelling experiments were conducted in the same cell. The isotopic liquid products were detected by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. As shown in Fig. 11 and S10,† the doublet peak at 8.08 and 8.57 ppm is assigned to the proton of formate coupled by the 13C nuclei. The distinct 13C NMR signal at 160.4 ppm corresponds to the carbon of H13COO− (Fig. S10†).68 These results validate that the carbon source of HCOO− is derived from CO2.

1H NMR spectra of H13COO− and H12COO− yielded in the PEC cell. 
3.5 Possible mechanism of PEC CO2 reduction
Based on the above characterization and experimental results, a possible mechanism was proposed for PEC reduction of CO2 into chemical fuels (Scheme 1). Initially, driven by the low external voltage, electrons could move to Ti3C2 and transfer to the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 and are trapped by the protons on the surface of the Pd NPs. Under light irradiation, the electrons in the valence band (VB) of g-C3N4 could get energy from the photons and jump to the CB. Subsequently, these photoelectrons could combine with protons to generate active hydrogen atoms that directly convert CO2 into hydrocarbons.19,61 In addition, oxygen could be released on the BiVO4 photoanode.

4 Conclusions
In summary, new heterojunctions of Ti3C2/g-C3N4 were prepared and further modified by various metals, and were utilized as photocathodes in the M–TCCN‖BiVO4 cell to reduce CO2. The TCCN heterojunctions have narrow band gaps and exhibit excellent light harvesting ability. The Ti3+ species could suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in the heterojunctions, thereby enhancing the efficiency of photocatalysis. Besides this, the Pd NPs could in situ capture protons and the pyri-N species could adsorb CO2 molecules efficiently. These advantages of the heterojunctions are favourable for the coupling of CO2 reduction and water splitting to generate chemical fuels. To the best of our knowledge, the photoelectrocatalytic properties of the Ti3C2/g-C3N4 heterojunction for CO2 reduction have not been reported to date. This work suggests that the MXene family of materials can be used to construct heterojunction materials to convert solar energy into chemical fuels via CO2 reduction.
