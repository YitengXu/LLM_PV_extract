    , Accepted 5th September 2022First published on 20th September 2022AbstractThe dual functionality of plasmonic light harvesting and barrier spacing between Au nanoparticles (NPs) and ZnO nanorod arrays (NRsA) are spotlighted to investigate their impact on the photoconversion and optical nonlinearity in the present study. The passivating Al2O3 barrier layer permits high-energy hot electron tunneling and injection from Au to the ZnO NRsA. The structural, vibrational, morphological/elemental, and optical properties of ZnO NRsA/a-Al2O3/Au were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering, field emission scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDX), and ultraviolet-visible-near IR (UV-Vis-near IR) absorption, respectively. The optoelectronic and nonlinear optical properties were analyzed by current–voltage measurement and z-scan tests under red laser (655 nm) irradiation, respectively. To highlight the effect of surface plasmon charge transport-based photosensing and photo-harvesting, the irradiated light source is selected to have a photon energy lower than the ZnO bandgap energy and detuning from LSPR. The transfer of photo-induced hot electrons from the Au NPs localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to the ZnO NRsA translates into photocurrent generation in photosensing performance. The reverse saturable absorption process is changed to saturable absorption after intercalating the Al2O3 spacing layer into the ZnO NRsA/Au interface. The typical values of the nonlinear refraction index and absorption coefficient are calculated as n2 = +2.38 × 10−5 cm2 W−1 and β = −0.17 cm W−1 for the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure, respectively. The sandwiched ZnO NRsA/amorphous Al2O3/Au heterostructure exhibits strong nonresonant optical nonlinearity, which has an excellent figure of merit for optical switching.
1. Introduction
The synergetic architecture of noble metal–semiconductor heterostructures can promote high-output functionalities with improved optoelectronic properties for applications in energy harvesting, photocatalysis, photonic crystals, biological sensing, chemical and electrochemical sensing.1–17 The coupling of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) with semiconductors can establish the exploitation of various photophysical processes.1–13 Strong light interaction with plasmonic NPs can cause several interesting phenomena such as electric field enhancement, selective light absorption, and the generation of hot electron–hole pairs through the decay of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the noble metal NP/semiconductor junctions.2,11,18 The LSPR-generated non-radiative hot electrons can overcome the Schottky barrier of the plasmonic NP–semiconductor junction and transfer into the conduction band (CB) of the adjacent semiconductor2,4,19via three different mechanisms:
(i) photonic enhancement, which requires surface patterning of the metal–semiconductor interface to concentrate the incident light, trap it and increase the photoconversion;4
(ii) direct electron transfer (DET) of the high-energy (1–4 eV) hot electrons of noble metal NPs that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium into the CB of the adjacent semiconductor;2,19,20
(iii) large photogenerated electron–hole dipoles in the plasmonic NPs induce electron–hole dipoles in the semiconductor, also known as plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET).2,12,21
Photonic enhancement is highly successful only when the incident photon's energy exceeds the bandgap energy of the semiconductor.19,22 Hot electron transfer and PIRET can coexist, compete and independently improve photoconversion near/below the band edge. Very efficient absorption of light in the visible range, high carrier densities and low recombination rates can be achieved by coupling the LSPR decay of plasmonic NPs with wide-bandgap semiconductors.2,4
Well-aligned ZnO nanorod arrays (ZnO NRsA) are favorable configurations in a vast field of applications, including light-harvesting devices (e.g. solar cells, photodetectors and photoelectrochemical cells), UV devices, chemical and biological sensing, environmental monitoring, and optical communication.1–3,14,23,24 Although one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructures permit efficient charge collection and current generation in separate length scales for light absorption and charge carrier transport, their low visible light absorption and high recombination centers restrict the potential application of ZnO NRsA in different photonic fields.2,23 Plasmonic metal–semiconductor heterojunctions have been designed to optimize and elevate semiconductor limitations.
Several studies have been devoted to elevating the photocatalytic performance of LSPR nanostructured systems to degrade standard dyes and pollutants under UV and visible light illumination.5–11 Fauzia et al.6 investigated the photocatalytic performance of metalloid AuAg NP-decorated ZnO NRsA. The Au, Ag, and AuAg NPs act as electron sinks, preventing the recombination of electron–hole pairs; thus, more electrons and holes can contribute to the photodegradation activity.6 AuPt NPs (∼3 nm in size) loaded onto ZnO nanorods enhance their sensitivity to H2 at room temperature in comparison to that of monometallic NPs.15 AuPd NP-decorated ZnO nanowires (NWs) have been utilized to sense NO2, showing higher sensitivity and faster response time than bare ZnO NWs16 due to the promotion of oxygen vacancies in ZnO and the subsequently enhanced density of NO2 adsorption sites. Additionally, they exhibited high light-harvesting efficiency, leading to robust enhancement of their photo-electrochemical water-splitting performance.24 AuPd nanoclusters deposited on ZnO–reduced graphene oxide presented high photocatalytic performance in the degradation of dyes because of their superior separation of photogenerated charge carriers.25 ZnO nanorods decorated with 2–3 nm Au, Pt and AuPt nanoclusters demonstrated excellent electrochemical sensitivity and the detection of 4-aminophenol, a toxic byproduct of pharmaceutical preparation.18 The electrochemical activation is modified by forming an additional space charge region at the cluster–ZnO interface, which facilitates charge transfer.26
Noble metal–semiconductor heterostructures can amplify the local field mediated by LSPR for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).11,18,27 The intrinsic large nonlinear optical (NLO) response of heterostructures is appealing due to its applications in integrated nonlinear optical devices.28 Strong coupling between surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and the excitons is reported in noble metal–ZnO core–shell nanostructure.28,29 Noble metal NP-decorated wide-bandgap semiconductors exhibit strong third-order NLO effects,28,30 which are appropriate for optical imaging, optical power limiting, all-optical switching, laser technology, pulse compression, mode locking, saturable Q switches, frequency conversion, and electro-optic device fabrications.31–36 Zhang et al.28 fabricated Ag@ZnO core–shell nanostructures via liquid-phase laser ablation and investigated their femtosecond nonlinear optical properties for potential applications in ultrafast all-optical switching. The enhancement in the NLR index n2 of the Ag@ZnO core–shell nanostructure can be explained by the large intrinsic nonlinearity of the composite material, coupling of dipole modes and local field enhancement of the Ag metal NPs.28 Nagaraja et al.37 found that annealing leads to prominent changes in the third-order NLO properties of Mn-doped ZnO (MZO) thin-films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering with different doping contents. They carried out NLO measurements by employing the z-scan test using a continuous wave (CW) He–Ne laser of 633 nm. The annealed MZO thin-films exhibit self-defocusing thermal nonlinearity with a third-order NLO susceptibility χ(3) of the order of 10−2. The low optical limiting of about ∼8 mW indicated their possible application in photonic devices.37 Fathima et al.34 synthesized ligand-free Au–Pt bimetallic NPs via laser irradiation of a colloidal mixture of Au and Pt NPs, which exhibited strong reverse saturable absorption (RSA) behavior, strong optical limiting efficiency and photoconversion characteristics. The nonlinear absorption and refraction characteristics were considerably enhanced in the Au–Pt bimetallic NPs compared to those of the corresponding monometallic NPs and the pristine colloidal mixture. The thermo-optical properties were also investigated via the thermal lens method and tuned by controlling the content of Au and Pt in the bimetallic NPs.34
The passivation of ZnO surface defects and its coupling to Au/Pt NPs SPR usually results in enhanced photocurrent, elevation in the ZnO UV emission yield and a concurrent diminishing of visible emission.1,3 Baharigushchi et al.3 reported the effects of the Au, Pt and bimetallic AuPt nanocluster (2–3 nm in size) decoration of ZnO nanorods on their charge transport, photoluminescence and UV sensitivity. The decoration of ZnO nanorods with bimetallic AuPt nanoclusters improves (reduces) UV sensitivity (photoluminescence) due to the significant depletion of free electrons below the surface. Liu et al.1 fabricated LSPR-enhanced ZnO NRA UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by spin-coating Ag NPs onto ZnO/SiO2 core/shell NRsA/p-GaN heterostructures. They found that the optimal enhancement of the derived photoluminescence and electroluminescence depends on the thickness of the SiO2 shell (spacer) layers.
The plasmonic Schottky junction of AgAu/Al2O3/TiO22,38,39 exhibits superior hot electron injection in the photoconversion process. The thin Al2O3 layer between Ag LSPR and TiO2 presented a very effective approach to reducing the fast electron–hole recombination and permitted the tunneling mechanism of hot carriers. Kohan et al.2 distinctively studied the effect of an insulating Al2O3 intermediate layer between Ag NPs and ZnO NRsA on the electric response and photocurrent generation in the photoconversion devices of ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Ag. The passivating Al2O3 layer minimizes the impact of DET and only permits the dipole–dipole coupling mechanisms and high-energy electron tunneling from Ag to the ZnO NRsA.2 Cushing et al.18 clarified the presence of plasmon-induced charge separation mechanisms in metal@TiO2 core–shell NPs, which are controlled by tailoring the spectral overlap and the physical metal–semiconductor contact through the SiO2 intermediate layer. Arguer et al.38 fabricated a metal/insulator/semiconductor (Ag/Al2O3/TiO2) heterostructure in which the Ag nanostructure can produce LSPR and the 1 nm thick Al2O3 spacer layer can passivate the interfacial states. TiO2 can collect plasmonic hot electrons across the Ag/Al2O3/TiO2 Schottky junction to form a photocurrent.38,39
Tang et al.39 focused on plasmonic photosensitizer nanostructures to improve photovoltaic and photocatalytic performance by enhancing light harvesting, transferring plasmonic hot carriers and suppressing recombination (including thermal relaxation and charge back transfer). The excited hot electrons experience fast relaxation times (a few hundred fs) at the interfacial barrier of the metal/semiconductor junction. Hence, a small fraction of hot electrons can be effectively boosted to the semiconductor.39,40 A sandwiched heterostructure is a typical design to construct a useful interface to enable rapid charge separation and transfer in a plasmonic photoconversion device.
In the present work, plasmonic charge transfer has been investigated in amorphous Al2O3/Au-decorated ZnO NRsA under red light illumination. The proposed architecture can drastically promote photo-harvesting and carrier generation by the accommodation of an insulating Al2O3 spacer layer between the Au NPs and ZnO NRsA. To the best of our knowledge, there is no major report on the effect of concurrent LSPR and barrier spacer on the third-order optical nonlinearity/optical power-limiting properties and photosensing characteristics of the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure, which were investigated by the z-scan technique and photocurrent measurement, respectively, using a CW red laser of 655 nm.
2. Experiment and methods
2.1 Growth of the ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure
ZnO NRsA were grown via chemical bath deposition on seeded Si and quartz substrates. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) were used to grow the ZnO NRsA, as described in earlier works.7,10,11 The ZnO NRsA were then decorated with aluminium thin-films 25–75 nm in thickness deposited using RF magnetron sputtering (70 W), with control over the thickness achieved by in situ quartz balance monitoring and ex situ reflectance ellipsometry. To oxidize the Al thin-films, thermal treatment was performed at a temperature of 400 °C for 1 h in ambient air. Au films were sequentially deposited using DC magnetron sputtering at a discharge voltage of 330 V and a discharge current of 0.6 mA. The final product, i.e. the ZnO NRsA/Al2O3 heterostructure, was annealed at a temperature of 400 °C for 3 h in ambient air.
2.2 Characterization
The surface morphology and chemical components were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Hitachi S-4800), respectively. The crystallinity and structural analysis were investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE). The optical absorption spectra were recorded from 200–1100 nm using a UV-Vis-near IR spectrophotometer (Avantes-Spec2048). A Raman spectrophotometer (Taksan, TakRam Model: P50C0R10) with a 532 nm Nd:YAG laser as an excitation light source was used for vibrational mode measurements at room temperature.
The current–voltage characteristics of bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructures were measured under red laser irradiation using a source meter (2450 Keithley Instrument). Multiple measurements were performed to acquire repeatable and consistent data. The voltage was varied from −5 to 5 V using a Keithley 2450 source meter.
Z-scan is a single beam technique to measure nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, in which a sample is scanned across a focused laser beam over a specific distance, and the intensity variations are recorded. The optical nonlinearity and self-focusing and de-focusing behaviors of the sample can be attributed to the fluctuation in intensity at the output. The details of the z-scan experiment have been reported elsewhere.41,42 A diode laser (655 nm, 40 mW) was used to measure the z-scan trace. A power meter detector recorded the transmittance intensity.
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Morphology and chemical analysis
FE-SEM images of the bare ZnO NRsA exhibit 1D well-aligned NRsA perpendicular to the Si substrates, as shown in Fig. 1a. The Al2O3 film preserves the 1D morphology of the ZnO NRsA (Fig. 1b). The morphological characterization of the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au is presented in Fig. 1c. The Au NP aggregation and Al2O3 coating can be clarified by the possible changes in the cross-sectional shape of the NRsA.

The composition of ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au was quantitatively analyzed by EDX studies. The EDX spectra in a selected area of the tip of a single NRA report the presence of Zn, O, Al and Au, with no other impurities on the Si substrate. A high concentration of Au NPs can be detected on the surface of the NRsA, as shown in Fig. 1d.
3.2 Structural studies
Changes in the phase formation and crystallinity of the bare ZnO NRsA caused by the introduction of Au NPs and/or Al2O3 were observed. Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns of the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au, ZnO NRsA/Al2O3 and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. The diffraction pattern of the bare ZnO NRsA well confirms the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451) with a preferred orientation along the (001) crystallographic direction, which is in agreement with the FE-SEM image. No distinct peaks assigned to Al2O3 appear. The X-ray scattering signal from the amorphous Al2O3 is disruptive in the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au, ZnO NRsA/Al2O3 and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. 
The peaks around 2θ = 38.32° and 44.53° denote the reflection of the (111) and (200) planes of the fcc Au structure (JCPDS no. 00-001-1172). The line broadening of the (111)Au peak indicates the nanoscale size of the Au particles. The crystallite size was analyzed using the Scherrer equation with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the Au(111) diffraction peak. The mean grain size of the Au NPs was found to be around 38 nm, which corresponds to the Au thin-film thickness.

Fig. 3 shows the Raman scattering from the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au, ZnO NRsA/Al2O3 and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. The vibrational bands located at 83 and 422 cm−1 for the bare ZnO NRsA are assigned to the non-polar E2(low) and E2(high) modes of the wurtzite phase, respectively.2,6,11,43 The E2(low) optical mode is shifted from 83 cm−1 (for the pristine ZnO NRsA) to 80 cm−1 for ZnO NRsA/Au due to the interaction of Au with ZnO and finally reaches 65–75 cm−1 for the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. The E2(high) mode is shifted from 422 cm−1 for the bare ZnO NRsA to 410 cm−1 for the Au-decorated ZnO NRsA. Although it is reported that the E1(TO) mode appears at ∼410 cm−1 for the hexagonal wurtzite structure of bulk ZnO, this mode is absent for the preferred c-axis-oriented ZnO NRsA.11 The 291 cm−1 peak is assigned to the second-order Raman process of the nonpolar 2E2 mode involving acoustic phonons,2,6,11,43 which shifted to 300 cm−1 as Au decorated the bare ZnO NRsA.

The breakdown of the translation symmetry and high surface area of the bare ZnO NRsA activates two branches of the localized surface phonon modes between the transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) phonon frequencies.11 The frequency of the upper surface phonon mode (UM) is normally below the corresponding bulk E1(LO) value (591 cm−1). The lower surface phonon mode (LM) is clearly observed at around 475 cm−1 in the vertical well-oriented ZnO NRsA.11 Rahmati et al.11 reported that the two peaks between 940 and 1150 cm−1 (Fig. 3) for the bare ZnO NRsA might be related to the second-order lower and upper surface phonon modes.
The peak around 1098 cm−1 for ZnO NRsA/Au can be assigned to the SPR-induced SERS due to electromagnetic enhancement in the Au hot spot region on top of the ZnO NRsA and their mutual interaction. The electrons transferred between the ZnO NRsA and Au NPs can enhance the electromagnetic field and the multiple-phonon Raman scattering of the ZnO NRsA.18
Surface phonon modes appear when the nanomaterial size is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light.6,44 When small NPs (16–55 nm) are randomly deposited on the ZnO surface, they can enhance the surface phonon scattering.6,45 The amorphous Al2O3 spacer can freeze and attenuate the vibrational mode due to the passivation of the surface phonon modes. An increase in the amount of Al2O3 deposited on the non-polar facet increases the E2(low) intensity by amplifying the movement of oxygen atoms.
3.3 Optical absorption
The UV-visible-near IR absorption spectra of the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au and ZnO NRsA/Au/Al2O3 are presented in Fig. 4 for various thicknesses of Au and Al2O3 thin-films. The bare ZnO NRsA exhibit low absorption in the visible region, and the absorption has a steep drop at around 380 nm, corresponding to the interband absorption of the ZnO NRsA.2,11 The absorption edge of the pure ZnO NRsA is slightly redshifted after the uptake of Au NPs. For ZnO NRsA/Au, the broad absorption peak centered around 525–550 nm is attributed to the LSPR absorption of the Au NPs.
 Fig. 4  UV-Vis-near IR absorption of the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. 
The insertion of the Al2O3 layer between the ZnO NRsA and Au did not result in any appreciable change in the ZnO NRA's absorption edge. For various thicknesses of Al2O3 nanosheets (except 50 nm), the sandwiched ZnO/Al2O3/Au NPs exhibit an LSPR absorption peak similar to that of the ZnO/Au NPs at around 525–550 nm (Fig. 4a and b). The broad optical absorption due to the SPR in the visible-near IR region is beneficial to the efficient harvesting of visible light.
3.4 Light intensity dependence of the photocurrent
To evaluate the light sensitivity of the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure, the photoconversion performance was examined. Fig. 5 depicts the photocurrent density (Jp) of the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure under the illumination of various powers of red laser versus voltage sweep. The energy of the red light photon (1.89 eV) is lower than the bandgap energy of the ZnO NRsA (3.37 eV) and the LSPR excitation peak (2.25 eV).
 Fig. 5  Photoconversion of the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure with Au thicknesses of (a) 15 nm and (b) 40 nm in the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. 
Various LSPR-induced charge transfer mechanisms promote superior photogenerated hot carrier survival, separation and collection. High nonlinear absorption (NLA) may play a significant role in photocarrier generation (see Section 3.5). Recently, Ghaemi et al.18 reported the LSPR-induced green response of the ZnO NRsA/Au heterostructure due to tuning between SPR and green laser excitation. The Al2O3 spacer layer boosts the photo-harvesting of light that has a photon energy lower than the SPR energy.
There is a linear trend in photoconversion versus red laser power for ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au 15 nm, which is a good candidate for photosensing. Increase in the Au thickness of the sandwiched NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure enhances the photocurrent density by up to 3 orders of magnitude while saturated for power intensity ≥70 mW (inset Fig. 5).
The photoresponsitivity (Rp) can be extracted from the linear fitting of Jp = RpP + Jd.45 The Rp values are estimated to be 5.51 × 10−5 and 1.13 × 10−1 A W−1 cm−2 for the Au thicknesses of 15 and 40 nm in the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure, respectively. The specific detectivity (Dp) is defined as 45 under a red laser of 655 nm. The Dp values are calculated to be 1.19 × 107 and 9.13 × 107 (Hz)1/2 W−1 cm−1 for the Au thicknesses of 15 and 40 nm in the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure, respectively.
The detailed theoretical band profile of the isolated component and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterojunction at the equilibrium state are shown in Fig. 6. The electron affinity, work function and bandgap of ZnO and Al2O3 are listed in Table 1.46 Due to the lower work function of Al2O3 compared to that of ZnO and Au, the transfer of electrons across the interface causes an accumulation layer to form at the hetero-interfaces. Rahmati et al.5 reported that the interfacial electrostatic field brings about strong charge separation and low recombination rate to improve the photoactivity of the ZnO NRsA/Au/CuS heterostructure in comparison to its ZnO NRsA/CuS counterpart.5

The electron affinities of ZnO and Al2O3 are χZnO = 4.37 eV and χAl2O3 = 1.35 eV, respectively.46 The Fermi level EF position in each component of the heterostructures is estimated as: EF = Φ − χ(1)where Φ is the work function. The CB and VB offsets can be calculated using (Fig. 6): ΔEc = χ2 − χ1(2) ΔEv = Eg1 − Eg2 − ΔEc(3)where Eg1,2 and χ1,2 are the bandgap values of Al2O3 and ZnO and electron affinity values of ZnO and Al2O3, respectively. The built-in potential Vbi between the ZnO and Al2O3 layers is: eVbi = EF2 − EF1(4)where e is the electron charge and EF1 and EF2 are the Fermi level positions in Al2O3 and ZnO, respectively. Vbi is estimated to be 2 eV, which maintains an interfacial electrostatic field of 8 × 105 V cm−1.
3.5 Nonlinear optical studies

Fig. 7 shows the optical limiting characteristics of the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au, ZnO NRsA/Al2O3 and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. At low incident power, the output power intensity (I) varies linearly with input power intensity (I0) and deviates from a linear to nonlinear trend for high incident power. The linear absorption α0 is calculated in the weak absorptive region (P ≤ 20 mW) using the Beer–Lambert relation, i.e. I = I0e−α0d, where d is the thickness of the samples. Various nonlinear mechanisms such as self-focusing, self-defocusing, induced scattering, induced refraction, induced aberration, excited state absorption, two-photon absorption (TPA), photo-refraction and free-carrier absorption (FCA) contribute to optical limiting in nonlinear media.37 Although optical limiting and nonlinear absorption (NLA) are usually due to RSA and FCA processes in semiconductors,37 the optical power limiting behavior in the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure seems to be an FCA-assisted SA process.
 Fig. 7  Optical power-limiting response of the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au, ZnO NRsA/Al2O3 and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. 
To study the effect of SPR and barrier spacer accommodation on the nonlinear refraction (NLR) behavior of the samples, closed aperture (CA) z-scan measurements were performed. For these measurements, an additional aperture with a linear transmittance of S ≪ 1 was used. The sensitivity to NLR is entirely due to the aperture, and the absence of an aperture completely eliminates the self-defocusing effect.37,38

Fig. 8 illustrates the CA z-scan results and the normalized transmittance (TN) vs. x. x is a dimensionless variable and is defined as the ratio of the on-axis position (z) to the Rayleigh length zR = kw02/2. w0 is the beam radius at the focal point (16 μm) and k = 2π/λ is the wavevector of the laser beam. The peak–valley (valley–peak) profile illustrates the self-defocusing (self-focusing) nonlinearity and corresponds to the negative (positive) NLR index n2.37,48 The NLR index traces for the bare ZnO NRsA and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure show peak–valley separations (Δxp–v) of 2.23 and 2.52, respectively. The Δxp–v values are 0.39 and 1.26 for ZnO NRsA/Au and ZnO NRsA/Al2O3, respectively. The NLR index can physically be derived from electronic, molecular, electrostrictive or thermal manipulation.37 It is reported that a peak–valley separation (Δxp–v) more than 1.7 is the apparent validation of thermal nonlinearity.37,48 The observed nonlinearity has a thermal origin due to energy storage from the laser diode.
 Fig. 8  CA z-scan traces for the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au, ZnO NRsA/Al2O3 and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. 
The difference between the normalized transmittance of the peak and valley (ΔTp–v) in the CA measurement is related to n2 by:11 ΔTp–v = 0.406(1 − S)0.25n2kI0Leff(5)where S is the linear transmittance of the aperture (S ≪ 1),  is the effective thickness of the sample, L is the thickness of the sample, I0 = 2Pin/πw02 is the incident intensity at the focal point, and Pin is the laser power (40 mW). The calculated n2 values from eqn (5) for the bare ZnO NRs and ZnO NRsA/Au heterostructure are given in Table 2. n2 is positive for the bare ZnO NRsA and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure, while it is negative for ZnO NRsA/Au and ZnO NRsA/Al2O3. The latter samples exhibit reverse saturable refraction, while the former ones show saturable refraction.49 The value of the NLR index of the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure increases and has the highest value in comparison to the bare ZnO NRsA and the binary counterparts.

Open aperture (OA) z-scan trace was carried out to determine the induced nonlinear absorption (NLA) coefficient β of the samples.37,50 There are two types of NLA in a NLO material, namely saturable absorption (SA) and reverse saturable absorption (RSA). The SA and RSA processes show a peak and a valley at the focus point in the transmittance, respectively.37,42 Negative and positive types of absorptive nonlinearities exhibit SA and RSA processes, respectively.34,37,50 Nonlinear absorption in NPs is due to various mechanisms such as TPA, RSA, transient absorption, FCA and nonlinear scattering.37 In semiconductors, RSA is due to nonlinear mechanisms such as TPA, FCA, nonlinear scattering or a combination of these processes.37 FCA along with TPA can weakly contribute to higher order nonlinear processes.37,49 TPA appears in semiconductors if the incident light source energy hν falls in the range of  and vanishes when hν < Eg/2.37,51 The nonlinear optical response for hν < Eg involves virtual processes, and the two-photon process is much stronger than the one-photon process.37,51 In the present work, the photon energy of the incident laser is equal to 1.89 eV, and the mentioned condition is fulfilled.

Fig. 9 shows the OA z-scan results for the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au, ZnO NRsA/Al2O3 and the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure. The NLA coefficient is calculated using the sample's normalized OA transmittance. The NLA coefficient (β) is calculated by:41,48 (6)where ΔT is the OA transmittance value at the valley or peak. The calculated β values are given in Table 2. The RSA process is present in the bare ZnO NRsA, ZnO NRsA/Au and ZnO NRsA/Al2O3, while the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure reveals the SA process. A decrease in the nonlinear absorption characteristics was observed for the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure as the Al2O3 thickness increases.

The ZnO NRA-based heterostructure shows high NLR ∼10−5 cm2 W−1 and NLA ∼ 1 cm W−1.11 The spacer layer in the sandwiched ZnO NRA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure causes the increase and decrease in the NLR index and NLA coefficient in comparison to those of the bare ZnO NRsA and binary counterparts, respectively.
The NLO properties and optical limiting of noble metal NPs originate from the interband electronic transition between the d and sp bands (specifically 5d → 6s for gold NPs with 6s1 5d10) and intraband excitations within the LSPR band.34 The interband transition occurs between the d band and sp band, specifically 5d to 6s for gold NPs with an outer electronic configuration of 6s1 5d10. The RSA of Au NPs at the SPR edge implies dominant TPA contributions to their optical nonlinearity.36 The interband and intraband spectra of the Au NPs are extensively overlapped and play essential roles in their NLO properties in nanometal systems.34,35 The saturable optical properties of the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au with resonant excitation energy much lower than the SPR peak could be explained by the interplay of ground-state plasmon bleaching and FCA at the excited state of the LSPR band. Many electrons have been injected from the LSPR band to the ZnO CB by absorption of an intense laser pulse with photon energy less than the ZnO bandgap energy. The electrons fill up the states at the bottom of the ZnO CB. Therefore, as the intensity of the exciting laser increases, the absorption gradually saturates as the bands fill up (band-filling nonlinearity).52
The values of the real and imaginary parts of the third-order NLO susceptibility (χ(3)) are calculated as:42 (7a) (7b)where n0 is the static refractive index of ZnO NRsA/Au18 and ε0 and c are the permittivity of free space and the speed of light in a vacuum, respectively. The χ(3) of the sample can be calculated as follows: (8)The values of the calculated susceptibility are given in Table 2. The significant enhancement of χ(3) and progressive changes in the NLA index of the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure establish the impact of the spectral position of the interband and intraband (SPR) absorptions concerning the laser excitation wavelength and the NLO parameters.28
To qualify as an all-optical switching material, NLO materials should satisfy the following conditions: (1) strong NLA index and ultrafast response time (few ps) and (2) low linear (single photon) and nonlinear (two photons) absorptions.11,28,53 Useful Stegeman figures of merit (FOM) parameters, namely w (single photon) and t (two photons), are:11,53 (9a) (9b)which quantify the NLO efficiency and transparency ratio, respectively. The calculated FOM parameters are given in Table 2. An appropriate material for all-optical switching must meet both w > 1 and t < 1.11,53 The sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure shows a nonresonant nonlinearity with good FOM parameters and can be realized as a good candidate for optical switching.
4. Conclusion
The effect of noble metal and insulating spacer co-decoration on the electronic properties of ZnO nanorod arrays (ZnO NRsA) have been targeted for the specific exploitation of collaborating SPR and barrier potential, which can be a good candidate for light sensing or switching. This work reports a comprehensive study on the photophysics of the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure and proposes an efficient architecture in the light harvesting/detection process, which effectively combines high photon absorption and high carrier transfer/generation. In the sandwiched ZnO NRsA/Al2O3/Au heterostructure, the LSPR mediated hot electrons enable tunneling and Schottky-driven charge transfer and enhance the photosensing performance. Additionally, the proposed plasmonic heterostructure exhibits strong nonresonant optical nonlinearity, which has an excellent figure of merit for optical switching.
