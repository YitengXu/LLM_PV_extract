    , Accepted 26th February 2018First published on 21st March 2018AbstractStructure–property studies were performed on a series of four fluorinated zinc azadipyrromethene derivatives. This series is based on bis[2,8-diphenylethynyl-1,3,7,9-tetraphenylazadipyrromethene]zinc(II) (Zn(WS3)2), with fluorine atoms at the para-position of either the proximal phenyls, the distal phenyls or the pyrrolic phenylethynyls, refered to as the proximal, distal and pyrrolic positions, respectively. In order to study the degree of fluorination, we also added –CF3 to the pyrrolic positions. All complexes had similar absorption spectra, 600–800 nm in films, complementing the absorption of the well-known donor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The chelates were tested in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices using P3HT as the electron donor. Compared to the unfluorinated acceptor Zn(WS3)2, fluorination increased the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in all cases except in the proximal position. The best results were obtained when either F or CF3 was added to the pyrrolic positions with PCEs of 3.3% and 3.7%. Atomic force microscopy images revealed a favorable phase separation and showed no signs of large-scale aggregation for all blends. Light intensity measurements revealed that bimolecular recombination limits the performance in these fullerene-free devices, and that the addition of fluorine suppressed the bimolecular recombination, with the largest suppression seen with the pyrrolic substitutions F and CF3. Electron mobility increased with fluorination, again with the largest increase when fluorines were added to the pyrrolic positions, reaching mobilities as high as ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, on a par with electron mobility of the ubiquitous phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) acceptor in blends. These results point to the importance of the chemical composition of pyrrolic phenylethylnyls for optimizing the charge transport and device performance for these types of complexes.
Introduction
Fluorination is increasingly used to tune the properties and improve the device performance of organic semiconductors in organic photovoltaics (OPVs).2–6 Fluorine atoms are effective electron-withdrawing groups due to their strong electronegative properties and small sizes. Fluorination of conjugated systems is known to lower both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, increase stability towards oxidative degradation, enable n-type or ambipolar semiconductivity, and enhance planarity and charge carrier mobility via intramolecular fluorine interactions.7–14 Since the maximum open-circuit voltage (VOC) in OPVs is related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, the addition of electron-withdrawing groups to the donor has been shown to lower its HOMO energy level and increase VOC.6,15 Others have reported that fluorination can increase short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) by suppressing bimolecular and geminate recombination.16–18 All of these factors indicate that addition of fluorine is a valuable tool for increasing the device performance.
Fullerene derivatives are popular as acceptors in OPVs because they exhibit good electron-accepting properties, isotropic electron mobility, and form a favorable nanoscale phase separation when blended with donors. However, they do not contribute significantly to light harvesting beyond 600 nm and have poor energy-level tunability.19,20 These shortcomings have motivated groups to study non-fullerene small molecules as electron acceptors and have recently reached PCEs as high as 14%.14,21–26 We have explored azadipyrromethene (ADP) dyes and their Zn(II) complexes as non-fullerene electron acceptors due to their high electron affinity and intense absorption in the visible to the near-infrared region of the light spectra. The best device performance was obtained when a phenylethynyl moiety was installed in the pyrrolic positions, Zn(WS3)2 (Fig. 1).27 Zn(WS3)2 absorbs from 600 to 800 nm, which is complementary to the absorption spectra of P3HT from 400 to 650 nm. In 2014, we reported a PCE of 4.1% when blended with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed a favorable nanoscale phase separation.28 However, the LUMO energy level of Zn(WS3)2 is higher than that of PCBM, which limits the use of Zn(WS3)2 as an electron acceptor.

In order to deepen the energy levels and increase its electron-accepting properties, we added a single fluorine atom to three different positions on the parent compound, Zn(WS3)2 at: the proximal phenyls (L1), the distal phenyls (L2) and the phenylethynyls in the pyrrolic position (L3).1 A CF3 group was also installed in the later position to study the degree of fluorination (L4). These ligands were chelated with Zn(II) and their structures are shown in Fig. 2. We reported that a neat film absorbance of ∼500–800 nm did not change drastically with the addition of fluorine, except for a small blue shift of ∼19 nm.1 Cyclic voltammetry measurements in solution revealed that the addition of fluorine did not have a large impact on the energy levels. The largest effect was observed for Zn(L1)2 and Zn(L4)2, with LUMO energy levels ∼0.1 eV lower than that of Zn(WS3)2 and approaching that of PCBM.1

Here, we blended our acceptors with P3HT as the donor and tested their performance in OPVs. Their PCEs increased with fluorination in all cases except in P3HT:Zn(L1)2. Our current best PCE for the unfluorinated acceptor, Zn(WS3)2, is 2.5%. Fluorination at the para-position of the phenylethynyls gave the best performances, with PCEs of 3.74% for Zn(L3)2 and 3.26% for Zn(L4)2. The latter also gave the highest JSC which, combined with its lower LUMO energy level than Zn(WS3)2, is promising for blending with other donors with lower-lying energy levels. To understand our results, we explored the effect of fluorination on bimolecular recombination and charge carrier mobility. Fluorination at the phenylethynyls proved to be highly beneficial in both reducing bimolecular recombination and enhancing electron mobility.
Experimental
UV-vis absorption was performed using a UV-Cary 50 spectrophotometer in o-DCB. For film absorption, glass substrates were cleaned stepwise in soapy water, DI water, acetone and isopropanol under ultrasonication for 15 minutes. Solutions for the film were prepared from a 10 mg mL−1 concentration and filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The films were spin coated at 400 rpm for 60 seconds. Blend films were prepared using the same optimized donor-to-acceptor ratio and concentrations as the active layer of photovoltaic devices. All films were annealed at 120 °C for 30 minutes.
Photovoltaic properties were studied using the inverted configuration: ITO/ZnO/P3HT:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. ITO-Coated glass substrates (R = 15 Ω sq−1) were cleaned stepwise in soapy water, DI water, acetone and isopropanol under ultrasonication for 15 minutes followed by UV-ozone treatment at 80 °C for 15 minutes. A ZnO layer was prepared from a precursor solution of 0.25 M zinc acetate dihydrate in 0.25 M ethanolamine and 2-methoxyethanol by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds, and then heated at 150 °C for 7 minutes. The photoactive layers were spin coated inside the glovebox (PureLabHE) at 1000 rpm for 40 seconds followed by 2000 rpm for 2 seconds from a blend solution with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 (15 mg mL−1 for Zn(L1)2) in o-DCB. The solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter prior to spin coating. All acceptors were blended with P3HT in a 1:0.7 ratio except P3HT:Zn(L1)2, which had a ratio of 1:0.5. The photoactive layers were pre-annealed at 120 °C for 30 minutes followed by deposition of MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (80 nm) under a vacuum pressure of 3 × 10−5 Torr using the Angstrom Engineering EvoVac Deposition System. Solar cell measurements were performed using an Oriel Sol2A solar simulator (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) and a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter inside the glovebox. The devices have a total effective area of 0.20 cm2. The Incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) was measured in air on fully constructed devices using a QEX10 Quantum Efficiency Measurement System.
For single-carrier device fabrication, ITO-coated glass substrates (R = 15 Ω sq−1) were cleaned stepwise in soapy water, DI water, acetone and isopropanol under ultrasonication for 15 minutes followed to a UV-ozone treatment at 80 °C for 15 minutes. For hole-only devices with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag structure, a layer of PEDOT:PSS was prepared by filtering through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter followed by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 60 seconds and heated at 150 °C for 10 minutes. The active layers were prepared in the same manner as for the photoactive layers. For electron-only devices with an ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al structure, cleaning of the ITO substrate, ZnO and active layer film formation was performed as previously described. Calcium (30 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally deposited. Dark current measurements for both architectures were performed using the Keithley 2400 SourceMeter inside the glovebox. The devices have a total effective area of 0.20 cm2.
Atomic force microscopy was performed directly on the photoactive layer of photovoltaic devices using a Bruker Veeco Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 microscope and a Nanoscope Illa controller in tapping mode. WSxM 5.0 Develop 8.0 was used to analyse the AFM images.29
Results and discussion
We have previously published the synthesis and purification of Zn(L1–L4)2 and have shown 1H NMR and elemental analysis in Fig. S2–S6 and Tables S1–S4 of the ESI†. Fig. 3 summarizes the estimated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the zinc complexes from our previous publication.1 All complexes have deeper energy levels than P3HT and can therefore behave as acceptors when paired with P3HT. The optical properties of P3HT, Zn(WS3)2 and the fluorinated acceptors in films are summarized in Fig. 4, 5 and Table 1. All zinc complexes have broad absorption from 500 to 800 nm and λmax values of ∼695 nm. Zn(L4)2 shows a slight blue shift compared to Zn(WS3)2 of ∼19 nm with a λmax value of 676 nm. The λonset values of Zn(WS3)2–Zn(L4)2 are 791, 785, 780, 778, and 769 nm, respectively.1 The optical gap (Eopt) was estimated from the onset of neat films and averaged ∼1.59 eV for Zn(WS3)2–Zn(L4)2. These absorbance spectra are complementary to the absorption of P3HT (Fig. 4). To understand the absorption properties of our photoactive layer in solar cells, blend films were made under the same conditions as the solar cells. Films blended with P3HT and Zn(WS3)2–Zn(L4)2 showed λmax values of ∼554 nm and λonset values of 803, 801, 798, 805, and 784 nm, respectively. Compared to the λmax of the neat films, once blended with P3HT, all of our acceptors show a redshift between 3 and 11 nm possibly due to different molecular pi-stacking in blends compared to neat films. While P3HT:PCBM absorbs from about 400 to 650 nm, P3HT:Zn(WS3–L4)2 acceptor blends absorb light from 450 nm to 800 nm for a better overlap with the solar spectrum.

Photovoltaic properties were investigated using an inverted configuration: ITO/ZnO/P3HT:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. Device processing optimization involved screening for donor-to-acceptor blend ratios (1:0.25, 1:0.5, 1:0.7 and 1:1), solvent choice (chloroform and ortho-dichlorobenzne (o-DCB)), total concentration (15 mg mL−1, 20 mg mL−1 and 30 mg mL−1) and annealing conditions (as cast, 100 °C for 10 min, 100 °C for 30 min, 120 °C for 10 min, and 120 °C for 30 min). The best results were obtained using a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in o-DCB, a film thickness of ∼100 nm and photoactive layer annealing conditions at 120 °C for 30 min. Fig. 6 and Table 2 summarize the current density–voltage curves and photovoltaic performance parameters. Fluorinated acceptors blended with the P3HT donor showed PCEs in the 2–4% range. The best performance of P3HT:Zn(WS3)2 was obtained using a blend ratio of 1:0.7 and gave an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.81 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 5.7 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 55% and a PCE of 2.5%. For devices containing P3HT:Zn(L1)2, the best conditions were slightly different, with a blend ratio of 1:0.5, a concentration of 15 mg mL−1, and a film thickness of ∼90 nm. These conditions gave a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 5.8 mA cm−2, an FF of 52% and a PCE of 2.0%. For the other fluorinated acceptors Zn(L2)2–Zn(L4)2, the best results were obtained using the same conditions as for P3HT:Zn(WS3)2. The best performance of P3HT:Zn(L2)2 gave a VOC of 0.72 V, a JSC of 7.5 mA cm−2, an FF of 56% and a PCE of 3.0%. The highest efficiency was obtained using P3HT:Zn(L3)2 which gave a VOC of 0.73 V, a JSC of 8.5 mA cm−2, an FF of 60% and a PCE of 3.7%. A blend of P3HT:Zn(L4)2 gave a VOC of 0.59 V, a JSC of 9.3 mA cm−2, an FF of 60% and a PCE of 3.3%. The lower VOC values obtained with Zn(L1)2 and Zn(L4)2 are consistent with their deeper LUMO energy levels than with Zn(WS3)2 (Fig. 2), and the VOC of the Zn(L4)2 device has a similar VOC than the PCBM-based devices, consistent with its LUMO energy level being similar to that of PCBM. However, the VOC for the series ranged over 0.2 V, which is larger than the 0.1 eV range for the estimated LUMO energy levels. This discrepancy may be due to errors in the estimated LUMO levels, especially since they were obtained in solution instead of films. Efforts to obtain cyclic voltammograms of films of the Zn(II) complexes failed, as the films delaminated easily from the carbon electrodes. Zn(L4)2 also showed the highest photocurrent of the non-fullerene acceptors tested, and is therefore the best candidate for pairing with high-performance polymer donors that were optimized for PCBM and usually have lower lying energy levels than P3HT.

The maximum incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs) are shown in Fig. 7. The spectral responses for the fullerene-free solar cells covered the visible spectra between 400 nm and 800 nm, comparable to the UV-vis spectra of the blend films and extending well beyond the absorption edge of P3HT at ∼650 nm. This demonstrates that the acceptors participate in converting 600–800 nm wavelength light into current. The IPCEs at 510 nm were 57%, 29%, 26%, 23%, 16% and 16% for PCBM and Zn(L1)2–Zn(L4)2 respectively, and consisted of the photocurrent results. These IPCEs are lower than that of the P3HT:PCBM control. The P3HT:PCBM films had a thickness of ∼200 nm, and therefore absorbed more light than the P3HT:zinc acceptor blends with thicknesses of ∼100 nm. However, making the P3HT:zinc acceptor blends thicker did not increase photocurrent, indicating that non-optical causes limit the performance in our fullerene-free devices.
 Fig. 7  Incident photon-to-current efficiency spectra of solar cells. 
To elucidate the reason for these low photocurrents, charge carrier mobility was estimated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model in neat and blend films. For hole mobility a device structure of ITO/PEDTO:PSS/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag was used, and for electron mobility a device structure of ITO/ZnO/donor:acceptor/Ca/Al was used.30 We attempted to estimate electron mobilities using other device structures (e.g. ITO/Al/donor:acceptor/Al) but due to film formation issues on top of aluminium, mobilities were inconsistent. Our electron mobility structure mentioned above allowed for better film formation and higher mobilities. Table 2 and Fig. 8 summarize the mobility results. In neat films, all the zinc complexes showed hole and electron mobilities, suggesting these complexes are ambipolar. The fluorinated acceptors all showed higher hole and electron mobilities compared to unfluorinated Zn(WS3)2, a positive outcome of fluorination. Hole mobility for Zn(WS3)2 in a neat film was estimated to be 2.74 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 while Zn(L1)2–Zn(L4)2 showed hole mobilities of 1.39 × 10−4, 3.63 × 10−4, 1.40 × 10−4 and 3.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. 8b). The electron mobilities for Zn(WS3)2, Zn(L1)2 and Zn(L2)2 were similar to the hole mobilities with values of 1.40 × 10−5, 2.47 × 10−4 and 3.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for neat films, respectively. Interestingly, Zn(L3)2 and Zn(L4)2 showed much higher electron mobilities, as high as 1.31 × 10−3 and 1.07 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Zn(L3)2 and Zn(L4)2, respectively (Fig. 8e). Both Zn(L3)2 and Zn(L4)2 were fluorinated on the phenylethynyl groups, suggesting that these groups play a significant role in increased charge mobility. Since these complexes are non-planar, charge transport can only occur if certain conjugated parts of the molecule can π-stack with other parts of an adjacent molecule. The published crystal structure of Zn(L2)2 shows that these intermolecular π-interactions can occur with the phenyls protruding from the molecular core: at the distal phenyls and the pyrrolic phenylethynyls.1 Since the complex is highly conjugated, only 2 out of the 8 protruding phenyls need to interact with their neighbours in order to form a conductive path. These acceptors can therefore have random orientations while maintaining good charge transport properties. Indeed, grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments for P3HT:Zn(WS3)2 showed at Zn(WS3)2 is completely amorphous.28 Fluorination has been suggested as a way to enhance crystal packing, electronic coupling, and mobility for naphthalenes and perylenes.32,33 We hypothesize that fluorination of the phenylethynyl groups may be enhancing electronic coupling between adjacent complexes and points to the phenylethynyl groups as key for charge transport in these materials.

In P3HT:acceptor blend films, the hole mobilities were similar ranging from 6.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 4.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 8c), similar to hole mobilities measured in P3HT:PCBM control devices and consistent with hole transport occurring in the P3HT.34 The presence of Zn(II) complexes therefore did not negatively affect the P3HT self-assembly. Electron mobilities, on the other hand, varied greatly from 1.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Zn(L1)2 to 6.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Zn(L2)2 and 6.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Zn(L4)2, to a high 2.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Zn(L3)2 (Fig. 8f). The later is similar to the electron mobility found in P3HT:PCBM control devices, and is therefore high enough to yield high-efficiency organic solar cells. In fact, three of our acceptors with PCEs in the 3–4% range showed charge carrier mobilities that are high enough to result for high-performance devices. The ability for these acceptors to transport charges is therefore not limiting their photocurrent.
Photocurrent is known to be strongly affected by the morphology of blend films.35,36 With this in mind, we imaged the film surface of the photoactive layer in fully constructed OPVs by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. While AFM is limited to imaging the surface, it provides useful information such as domain size, interconnectivity and surface roughness, all related to charge generation and transport of OPVs. Fig. 9 shows the 1 × 1 μm phase images for the OPV photoactive layers. The corresponding 1 × 1 μm height images and 10 × 10 μm images can be found in the ESI.† While the images are slightly different for each acceptor, they all show a favorable nanoscale phase separation between the P3HT and acceptor, and all show P3HT nanofibril formation for efficient hole transport.37–39 There is no indication of a large-scale phase separation or self-aggregation. The surface roughness values of the 1 × 1 μm images are 16.6, 12.0, 13.8, 13.7, 8.63 and 9.79 nm for PCBM, Zn(WS3)2 and Zn(L1)2–Zn(L4)2, respectively. While Zn(WS3)2 and Zn(L1)2–Zn(L2)2 have similar RMS values to our P3HT:PCBM control and the reported values of Zn(L3)2–Zn(L4)2 show a smoother surface.40 To a first approximation, the film morphology does not appear to limit photocurrents. Although a more detailed study is required to fully assess the role of morphology on the device performance in these systems, we suspect that the features that are very difficult to image, such as the mixed phase morphology and donor:acceptor interfaces, may be most relevant.

Other factors that strongly affect photocurrent are exciton splitting, charge separation and charge collection efficiencies.41,42 We have previously shown that exciton splitting is efficient with these types of acceptors.27 One factor that may strongly limit the charge collection efficiency is the bimolecular recombination between a free hole and a free electron. To better understand charge recombination, the light-intensity dependence on photocurrent was investigated. JSC has a power-law dependence on Plight (JSC ∝ Plightα) where α is the power-law component. As α approaches unity, bimolecular recombination is insignificant.43Fig. 10 shows the fitted α values for blend films. While P3HT:PCBM shows the highest α value at 0.99, all of the Zn(II) acceptors show an α value <1. In fact, the α value correlates well with the photocurrents observed (Fig. 11). The fluorinated acceptors showed less bimolecular recombination than Zn(WS3)2, consistent with their higher photocurrents observed in devices. While Zn(L1)2 shows a very similar α-value as Zn(WS3)2, acceptors Zn(L2)2–Zn(L4)2 show larger α-values (0.74, 0.81 and 0.86, respectively), suggesting that the addition of fluorine in the distal and phenylethynyl positions plays a role in suppressing bimolecular recombination in our acceptors. This suppression of bimolecular recombination could be due to improvements in morphology, less hard-to-detect impurities or traps in the complexes, enhanced electron transport out of mixed phases, or a combination of these possibilities.

Conclusions
We studied the effect of a single fluorine atom in three different positions on the parent compound, Zn(WS3)2, and the degree of fluorination in the pyrrolic position using CF3. While fluorination has little effect on the absorbance spectra and on energy levels, it strongly affected charge transport, bimolecular recombination and device performance. Generally, fluorination increased the PCE in OPVs from 2.5% of Zn(WS3)2 to 3.7% in Zn(L3)2. The highest photocurrent was observed in Zn(L4)2 which contains a CF3 group in the pyrrolic position. Combined with its lower LUMO energy level than Zn(WS3)2, these results suggest that Zn(L4)2 has potential to be paired with donors that have lower-lying energy levels than P3HT. AFM reveals a favorable nanoscale morphology and lack of large-scale aggregation in all of our blends, similar to P3HT:PCBM. Bimolecular recombination studies reveal that recombination limits the PCE in these fullerene-free devices, and that fluorine substitutions suppress the bimolecular recombination. Finally, our mobility measurements reveal that all of our fluorinated acceptors have higher neat film mobilities than Zn(WS3)2. Zn(L3)2 and Zn(L4)2 revealed very high electron mobilities similar to that of PCBM. These results point to the importance of the pyrrolic phenylethylnyls in optimizing the charge transport and device performance for this type of acceptor.
