Demand in 2050 is expected to escalate to be as high as 30 terawatts, almost 2.5 times the current usage (<url>http://www.science.doe.gov/production/bes/reports.files/SEU_rpt.pdf</url>). Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere (387 ppm in the Spring of 2008) could reach 600 ppm by 2035, if a “business as usual” approach to meeting this energy demand continues (http://www.sternreview.org.uk/). The price of oil has fluctuated dramatically over the last several years and, at this time of writing, is heading back up again. All of these factors combine to create the potential for worldwide economic and environmental turmoil.While solar energy is disperse and intermittent, nature provides a useful process for capturing and storing light energy, namely photosynthesis. It can be linked to the production of molecular hydrogen (H2) either indirectly (through second generation, biomass production and conversion processes) or directly (through third-generation photoconversion processes, in which photosynthetic water-splitting is coupled to fuel production without an intermediary, biomass-production step). The advantage of the latter is a much smaller fuel-production footprint with better land utilization and elimination of the food versus fuel conundrum facing the current Biofuels industry.1,2Biological photoconversion- and fermentation-based H2 production evolved with the capacity of microorganisms to biosynthesize highly effective catalysts in the form of hydrogenase (H2ase) enzymes. H2ases catalyze H2 activation, coupling the reversible reaction, H2↔ 2e− + 2H+, to help balance cellular proton gradients and redox potentials, and in the transduction of chemical energy within microbial communities through H2 cycling.3,4 The H2ases are classified into three phylogenetically distinct gene families: [NiFe], [FeFe], and Hmd mono-Fe (iron-sulfur-cluster-free).5–7 Each family shows differences from the others in structure and subunit composition and in the metal composition of catalytic sites.These same microbial systems provide a potential carbon neutral, renewable pathway for H2 production8 as a potential alternative to fossil fuels. For example, unicellular algae and cyanobacteria are being studied as model systems9–15 for practical solar-to-H2 conversion. The long-term objective is to achieve conversion efficiencies close to the projected 10%16,17 of photosynthetic systems. Several recent publications also highlight the efforts that are being made to explore artificial photosynthesis for solar H2 production.18–23 This requires integrating either H2ases or a synthetic-biomimetic catalyst in devices and molecular architectures composed of light absorbing molecular dyes, semiconductors, or nanostructured materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electrolytic H2-production systems.24 However, the realization of any mature solar H2 production technology will require addressing, for example, limitations due to (i) photostability of artificial light harvesting molecules; (ii) poor electronic coupling or inefficient synthetic catalysts in photochemical assemblies; (iii) competition for metabolic reductant pools; (iv) H2ase inactivation by O2; and (v) the additional effects of O2 on gene regulation, H2ase maturation, and energetic flux. Some of the specific questions that need to be addressed regarding H2ases include (i) identifying the function of each maturase in H2ase biosynthesis and the substrates for ligand biosynthesis; (ii) defining the parameters that regulate enzyme specificity of maturation/biosynthetic systems; and (iii) improving fidelity of maturation for recombinant expression.In this review, we will focus on recent progress in developing heterologous and recombinant expression and on in vitro maturation systems for the biosynthesis of active [FeFe] and [NiFe]-H2ases. We will also present examples of how these efforts support basic and applied studies of H2ases by addressing the barriers to achieving more viable biological and synthetic H2-production systems and catalysts.Overview of hydrogenase structure[FeFe] hydrogenasesThe [FeFe]-H2ases are principally found in species of bacteria and eukarya (green algae and protists)5 that thrive over a wide range of environmental conditions including temperatures, O2 partial pressures, and salinities. These H2ases are structurally diverse, varying from a simple catalytic domain to more complex multi-domain and multi-subunit compositions. A unifying feature of this family is a series of conserved motifs that function to coordinate the catalytic metallocenter,3,5,7,25,26 and provide the appropriate chemical environment for the inter-conversion of H+ and H2 at high rates and low overpotentials.27–29 Sequence conservation also includes charged and hydrophobic regions that function in proton transfer and hydrophobic “channels” for gas (H2) transport,18 structural features that are shared by other H2ases and gas activating enzymes.30The [FeFe]-H2ase designation is derived from the structure of the unique catalytic site metallo-cluster, or H-cluster. The H-cluster is composed of a [4Fe-4S]-cluster coordinated via a conserved protein cysteine thiolate to a unique organometallic [2Fe]-center.31–33 Each Fe-atom of the [2Fe]-center is terminated by a CO− and CN−, and bridged by an additional CO−. The S-atoms are bridged by a CH3–X–CH3 moiety, with the identity of X suggested to be either N, C, or O based on structural models.34–36 Recent spectroscopic studies strongly support the N assignment in the form of an amine group.37,38[NiFe] hydrogenasesThe [NiFe]-H2ases are distinguished from the other classes of H2ases by the presence of Ni in the catalytic metallo-cluster. To date, the [NiFe]-H2ases have been identified only among species of the Archaea, bacteria, and cyanobacteria, and can be organized into subgroups based on subunit composition, cellular localization, affinity for redox partners and catalytic bias. Full descriptions are extensively reviewed elsewhere.3,7,29,39 In the simplest form, [NiFe]-H2ases are heterodimeric, but many examples of this core complex are found in association with additional subunits. Some examples of [NiFe]-H2ases include the membrane-bound H2ase (MBH, Hyn), soluble NAD-dependent H2ase (SH), and uptake H2ase (Hup), all of which have been produced recombinantly. The MBH and Hyn [NiFe]-H2ases are heterodimers composed of a catalytic large-subunit (∼60 kDa) containing the [NiFe]-cluster, and a small-subunit (∼30 kDa) containing accessory [FeS]-clusters that mediate electron transfer to and from the catalytic site.In addition to Ni, the bimetallic catalytic metallo-cluster of [NiFe]-H2ase contains an Fe-atom coordinated by terminal CO− and CN− ligands, a feature shared with the [FeFe]-H2ase H-cluster. Moreover, the [NiFe]-cluster and catalytic site are connected by hydrophobic channels to the protein surface for H2 gas diffusion.29,40 The degree of O2 sensitivity and/or inactivation varies across the [NiFe]-H2ase family, but in general, the return to anaerobic conditions in the presence of a reductant (i.e., H2) leads to reactivation of H2ase activity. There are examples of [NiFe]-H2ases that possess unique and divergent catalytic site41,42,43 or hydrophobic channel44 structures. These structural alterations contribute to notable reductions in the sensitivities of [NiFe]-H2ases to O2,45 without significant reductions in enzyme turnover number for H2 production. Dementin et al. created a valine-to-methionine mutant of the Hyn [NiFe]-H2ase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans that improved the O2 tolerance of the recombinant enzyme.46 The mutation is within the hydrophobic channel, proximate to the [NiFe]-cluster catalytic site. The exchange of methionine for valine is proposed to reduce the O2 accessibility of the catalytic site,47 and increase the reactivation rate of the O2 inhibited enzyme. This is the first example of successful engineering of improved O2 tolerance for any H2ase.The diversity of [NiFe]-H2ase regulation, function, and maturation is a significant challenge to developing functional, heterologous-expression systems. Expression of [NiFe]-H2ases is regulated in various ways depending on the enzyme's metabolic function. Transcription of [NiFe]-H2ases, in general, can be regulated in response to the availability of the precursors required for maturation. Examples include Ni (via the NikR protein), sulfur (sulfur-reducing NADPH-linked H2ases), and selenium ([NiFeSe]-H2ases).7 Many of the response regulators that mediate these effects are specific to the native organism, thus designing and coordinating transcriptional control of heterologous expression can be complicated by host specific regulatory traits.Recombinant expression host systems for hydrogenases[FeFe] hydrogenasesBacterial. Several model organisms, including bacteria, green algae, and cyanobacteria, have been used as hosts to heterologously express [FeFe]-H2ases with varying levels of success. To date, [FeFe]-H2ases have been heterologously expressed in three bacterial species, Escherichia coli,48–50Shewanella oneidensis,51 and Clostridium acetobutylicum,52 and in one cyanobacterium species, Synechococcus sp. PCC7942.53 However, the initial attempts at heterologous expression of functional [FeFe]-H2ases in a variety of non-native organisms resulted in limited success.53,54 These efforts typically produced catalytically inactive apo-enzymes lacking a complete H-cluster. Initially, heterologous expression of the periplasmic [FeFe]-H2ase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris in E. coli only produced apo-enzymes that contained a fraction of the accessory [FeS] clusters and lacked catalytic activity.54Further developments in bacterial recombinant systems for [FeFe]-H2ase expression have been made in the last several years. In 2004, Posewitz and colleagues co-expressed the C. reinhardtii HydEF, HydG, and HydA1 genes in E. coli.49 Unfortunately, this system, while producing purified and active C. reinhardtii HydA1, did not result in high levels of expression primarily due to the instability and low expression levels of the C. reinhardtii cDNA clones in E. coli. A continuation of these studies resulted in the development of a heterologous system in E. coli utilizing co-expression of the C. acetobutylicum maturation proteins HydE, HydF, and HydG with monomeric [FeFe]-H2ases from C. acetobutylicum, C. reinhardtii and C. pasteurinaum.48 The specific activities of the expressed [FeFe]-H2ases from this system are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1 Activities of [FeFe]-H2ases expressed in native and recombinant maturation systems
A plasmid-based system was also developed in C. acetobutylicum for recombinant expression of both native and algal [FeFe]-H2ases.52 This system exhibits high fidelity and overcomes some of the scale-up issues required to produce the same enzymes from native systems. To date, both algal and bacterial [FeFe]-H2ases have been expressed and purified from C. acetobutylicum, and they have been characterized by spectroscopic, electrochemical, and biochemical techniques.56,57,61 More recently, heterologous expression has been developed for the C. reinhardtii [FeFe]-H2ase HydA1 in S. oneidensis.51 As an expression host, S. oneidensis is an ideal model system for maturation of the C. reinhardtii [FeFe]-H2ase, because it is a facultative anaerobe that can be easily grown and contains an [FeFe]-H2ase, HydA1, that closely matches the codon bias of C. reinhardtii (Table 1). Expression of C. reinhardtii HydA1 in S. oneidensis results in higher yields (0.4–0.5 vs. 0.1 mg L−1) compared to expression in C. acetobutylicum,52 and is produced at higher specific activities than those obtained from expression in E. coli (Table 1).Algal. Advancing the genetic tools that are available for the expression of recombinant H2ases in green algae has been a significant challenge to overcoming H2-production barriers, such as the functional expression of more O2-tolerant [FeFe]-H2ases.9,62 Heterologous expression of H2ases in photosynthetic green algae has not progressed to the same extent as for bacterial organisms, in spite of the advances made in developing genetic systems in model organisms.63–65 The expression of natural and engineered O2-tolerant [FeFe]-H2ases in model photosynthetic organisms such as C. reinhardtii is being investigated to overcome the high sensitivity of the native H2ases to enable photobiological H2 production coupled to water oxidation. Significant progress has been made with regard to developing nuclear transformation protocols for C. reinhardtii,66–69 which should enable progress in the heterologous expression of both natural and engineered [FeFe]-H2ases.Studies have also demonstrated that chloroplast transformation of C. reinhardtii is feasible by glass-bead, cell-wall disruption, and particle bombardment methods.66,70,71 Genes are targeted to the chloroplast genome of C. reinhardtii and incorporated by homologous recombination, enabling targeted gene transformation and expression. In the last decade, significant progress has been made in developing new markers for chloroplast transformation in C. reinhardtii.72 More recently, an inducible chloroplast gene expression system was developed utilizing the copper-sensitive cytochrome C6 promoter and the nucleus-encoded Nac2 chloroplast protein.73 The challenge is to develop regulated expression that coordinates the translocation and maturation of active H2ases with physiological conditions that support light-driven H2-production.[NiFe] hydrogenasesAs discussed above, the development of heterologous expression for the biosynthesis and molecular engineering of [NiFe]-H2ases is challenging due to the complexity and enzyme specificity of the maturation process. There are several documented examples of non-functional heterologous expression, which have only recently been reported for a limited number of organisms. For example, heterologous expression of [NiFe]-H2ases from Rhodococcus opacus, D. vulgaris, and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 all resulted in the production of non-functional H2ases.19,54,74 For this reason, expression and purification of [NiFe]-H2ases for structural and in vitro studies are most often accomplished through the development of plasmid-based expression in homologous strains or closely related species as expression hosts.44,75–81 The results of a few of these efforts are summarized below, and some of the resulting enzymatic activities are shown in Table 2.
Table 2 Activities of [NiFe]-H2ases expressed in native and recombinant maturation systems
In the rhizophere, nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria evolve H2, which can be recycled via Hup activity as part of an energy conserving process. Many naturally occurring rhizobial strains lack H2ase activity.82 Transformation of the hup gene cluster from Rhizobium leguminosariumbv. vicae into hup− strains of Rhizobium etli, Mesorhizobium loti, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum led to restoration of Hup activity.83 More recently, the R. eutropha MBH [NiFe]-H2ase and associated regulatory and maturation genes were successfully transferred via broad host range plasmids into a H2ase-free host, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and the MBH was expressed as a functional H2ase.75R. eutropha has also been used as a host for heterologous expression of the SH [NiFe]-H2ase from R. opacus, which functionally complemented a mutant R. eutropha H2ase null strain.84 Furthermore, the [NiFe]-H2ase from Desulfovibrio gigas has been successfully expressed in an active form in Desulfovibrio fructosovorans MR400.85 Though these studies highlight the successes of heterologous expression for [NiFe]-H2ases, a reasonably high level of homology is required between the native and recombinant enzyme for maturation to occur. Otherwise, co-expression of non-native maturases along with the structural proteins is required to achieve maturation and active enzyme production. In most of these cases, as shown in Table 2, the enzyme activities are reduced compared to those of the natively expressed H2ase.75,84,85There is also recent evidence that the substrate(s) for HypF-mediated CN− biosynthesis, as well as the HypF-domain structure and biochemical activity, are system specific.45,75,90 This specificity further illustrates why development of successful heterologous maturation systems for [NiFe]-H2ases have been challenging. Moreover, the homology between Hyp proteins is not necessarily high, and thus maturases are not always functionally interchangeable in the activation of heterologous [NiFe]-H2ases.Development of in vivo and in vitro maturation systemsBiosynthesis of the H-cluster and maturation of [FeFe]-H2ases are accomplished by the combined activity of three maturases: HydE, HydF, and HydG, which were first identified in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.49 Each of the genes is conserved in organisms that biosynthesize an [FeFe]-H2ase. Details of how HydE, HydF, and HydG function to accomplish H-cluster assembly are beginning to emerge through biochemical and structural investigations of purified maturases, and analytical studies of catalytic site intermediates from in vitro systems. Differences in maturase structure are known to exist; for example HydE and HydF are a single HydEF protein in C. reinhardtii.49 Nevertheless, maturation of C. reinhardtii [FeFe]-H2ases HydA1 and HydA2 has been demonstrated in several bacterial organisms, and successful recombinant expression includes other enzyme lineages.The development of in vitro systems for investigations of [FeFe]-H2ase maturation and enzyme function have evolved from the discovery of the [FeFe]-H2ase maturases in C. reinhardtii.49 Efforts currently utilize the C. acetobutylicum/E. coli58,91and S. oneidensis/E. coli59 [FeFe]-H2ase expression/host systems to produce active maturases in cell extracts. Confirmation of HydE and HydG as radical s-adenosylmethionine (radical-SAM) proteins and HydF as a GTPase was established for the Hyd maturases from Thermatoga maritima that were expressed, purified, and characterized in E. coli.92,93 A structure for recombinantly produced HydE from T. maritima has been solved,94 and it consists of a TIM barrel fold with a [4Fe-4S]-cluster and a possible second [2Fe-2S]-cluster. A hypothetical scheme for H-cluster biosynthesis based on HydE or HydG mediated decomposition of glycine to form CN− and CO− ligands has been proposed, and is being tested through functional studies in recombinant systems.91 Recombinantly produced HydG from T. maritima was recently shown to mediate the decomposition of tyrosine. The authors proposed this as a synthetic route to the formation of the CH2–NH2–CH238 bridging moiety that connects the S-atoms in a [2Fe-2S]-cluster.95 Testing of these hypotheses through investigations of in vitro [FeFe]-H2ase maturation is ongoing. The S. oneidensis/E. coli heterologous expression system has been used to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the nutrients and supplements that are needed to support H-cluster biosynthesis and enzyme maturation. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, in vitro maturation has been developed with the capacity to produce [FeFe]-H2ases with reasonably high specific activities and is being used for high-throughput, randomized mutagenesis and activity screening of [FeFe]-H2ases with improved catalytic activity and O2 tolerance.59,96The development of in vitro activation of [NiFe]-H2ases has also evolved from the initial in vivo identification and functional characterization of maturation, processing, and translocation genes to more recent successes in the reconstitution of [NiFe] cluster biosynthesis by purified or enriched protein mixtures. In vitro maturation was first demonstrated in 1996 for E. coli [NiFe]-H2ases using cell-free extracts, which showed that Ni incorporation and proteolytic processing are required for catalytic subunit maturation.97 More recent efforts by several groups have developed systems with purified components as a means to elucidate the biochemical role of each maturase in assembly and synthesis of a complete [NiFe] cluster and active [NiFe]-H2ases.26,78,98–101 Through a combination of elegant genetic, in vivo, and in vitro studies, the identity of the molecular precursor for CN− biosynthesis, as well as the maturases that function to synthesize and load the CN− moiety on Fe, have been established.102 Maturation of [NiFe]-H2ases, in contrast to [FeFe]-H2ases, requires the activation and incorporation of Ni. This difference and the rich variety in catalytic subunit structure have contributed to the evolution of a more diverse complement of Hyp maturases (HypA-F) and Ni-binding and delivery proteins (i.e., SlyD).26,100,101 The evidence summarized above for the species and substrate specificity of HypF also underscores why development of successful heterologous maturation systems for [NiFe]-H2ases have been challenging. Moreover, the homology between Hyp proteins is not necessarily high, and thus these are not always functionally interchangeable in the activation of heterologous [NiFe]-H2ases. There is also the additional requirement to coordinate proteolytic processing with completion of [NiFe]-cluster biosynthesis to achieve fully mature catalytic subunits. Many of the fundamental aspects of [NiFe]-cluster biosynthesis are still emerging and will undoubtedly have an impact on the development of more robust recombinant expression systems. For detailed reviews of the [NiFe]-H2ase maturation processes, see ref. 26, 99, 101, 103 and 104.Examples of basic research efforts utilizing recombinant expressionRecombinant systems for [FeFe]-H2ase expression have played a significant role in supporting basic efforts in H2-production research. As mentioned above, some of these expression systems are contributing to the elucidation of the maturation pathway for [FeFe]-H2ases. Spectroscopic studies have also been pursued to probe the mechanism of [FeFe]-H2ase maturation using heterologous [FeFe]-H2ase expression systems. Most recently, Mulder et al. spectroscopically and biochemically characterized a precursor form of [FeFe]-H2ase produced both in vitro and by heterologous expression of the C. reinhardtii structural enzyme in the absence of the maturation machinery.105The heterologous expression of [FeFe]-H2ases has also facilitated in-depth structure–function analyses. The vast majority of what is known about the structure–function relationship of [FeFe]-H2ases has been gained from spectroscopic and structural analyses of either CpI or Ddh isolated from C. pasteurianum and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively (for reviews see: ref. 28, 29 and 37). More recently, X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the C. reinhardtii [FeFe]-H2ase, which consists of only the catalytic domain and H-cluster, is being facilitated by heterologous production of this enzyme in C. acetobutylicum52 to obtain more detailed atomic level structural and electronic information on the H-cluster.106Heterologous systems have also played an important role in the elucidation of [NiFe]-H2ase maturation and regulation, although more research is required for a full understanding of these processes. Early studies used the expression of accessory Hup proteins in E. coli to verify size and expression in the native organism.107 In addition, introduction of putative promoter activation regions into host strains or the use of other heterologous promoters have identified regulatory regions and mechanisms of H2ase operon expression in R. leguminosarium bv. vicae, R. eutropha (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus), and E. coli.108–111 Finally, heterologous systems have allowed characterization of Tat-mediated transport of Hup H2ases112 and the verification of homologous maturation and processing enzymes in R. leguminosarium, R. eutropha, and Thermococcus litoralis.108,112–117H2-production research utilizing recombinant hydrogenasesPhotosynthetic processes are being used as models to develop systems for the conversion of solar energy to support our future fuel needs. Besides whole-cell H2 production using algal, cyanobacterial, and bacterial approaches,2,118–120 both [FeFe]-H2ases and [NiFe]-H2ases are being investigated specifically as catalysts in synthetic H2-production systems and H2 fuel cells, and we will summarize examples of studies that are facilitated by the use of heterologously produced H2ases. Although heterologous over-expression systems for [NiFe]-H2ases have not yet been successful, the native [NiFe]-H2ases found in Allochromatium vinosum, R. eutropha, and Ralstonia metallidurans are more O2 tolerant compared to many other [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-H2ases, and thus are uniquely suited for these model enzymatic systems.76,121–125Due to their high H2-production rates, [FeFe]-H2ases have also been investigated as catalysts for synthetic applications. These studies have been facilitated by heterologous expression of enzymes and their immobilization onto electrodes in electrochemical cells and devices.126,127 Hambourger et al. investigated the use of recombinantly produced C. acetobutylicum [FeFe]-H2ase (CaI) as a catalyst for PEC H2 production.127 The electrocatalytic activity of CaI on different carbon electrodes was studied and provided insight into the interaction of the enzyme on an electrode surface, as well as its catalytic efficiency in this system. The observed rates of H2 production, using the H2ase as a catalyst in the PEC biofuel cell, were similar to the rates obtained when platinum was used.127The potential also exists for the incorporation of H2ases into PEC and electrochemical devices. McDonald et al. reported that semiconducting, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) function as molecular wires to electronically couple to the C. acetobutylicum [FeFe]-H2ase catalytic site.128 They demonstrated that complexes spontaneously self-assembled by displacement of a surfactant used to disperse the SWNT's through the physical adsorption of [FeFe]-H2ases onto the SWNT surface. Blackburn et al. showed that fully functional charge-transfer complexes could be formed between metallic-SWNTs (m-SWNT's) and [FeFe]-H2ase.126 The m-SWNT's, which are highly conductive, have the potential to facilitate the development of electrode surfaces for immobilizing H2ases for integration into synthetic H2-production and fuel cell devices. These studies address major challenges in the field, including the ability to create a robust and efficient electronic interaction between H2ases and other components of solar capture/conversion systems, and demonstrate preservation of both the fidelity and activity of the H2ase in a synthetic context.Purified [NiFe]-H2ases have also been immobilized onto carbon and nanostructured TiO2 electrodes to act as photo- and electrocatalysts.27,129,130 The MBH [NiFe]-H2ase from R. metallidurans has been electrically coupled to dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles, resulting in a photocatalytic system for light-driven H2 production.131 Another possibility being investigated is the use of purified enzymes in fuel cells using nanolipoprotein or phospholipid particles to immobilize membrane-associated enzymes on electrodes; this is also intriguing for the development of more efficient H2-production systems.132,133The MBH [NiFe]-H2ase from R. eutropha as well as the [NiFe]-H2ase from D. vulgaris have been physically linked to PSI in vitro and show promise for improved H2 production by coupling the H2ase directly to PSI as the electron donor.80,81 To date, H2-production levels have not been increased through heterologous [NiFe]-H2ase expression. Maeda et al.134 did show increased net H2 production in E. coli when either HoxHYFUE or HoxU from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was expressed. However, this was attributed to the inhibition of H2 uptake by endogenous E. coli H2ases-1 and -2 rather than to the expression of a functional Synechocystis H2ase.74 In addition, the introduction by electroporation of a purified [NiFe]-H2ase from Thiocapsa roseopersicina into Synechococcus PCC7942 led to increased H2 production, although this did not involve expression of the heterologous enzyme in the host.135There are currently several projects in progress with the single objective of identifying and expressing natural or engineered O2-tolerant [FeFe] and [NiFe]-H2ases in model host organisms. One area of focus by our group at NREL utilizes recombinant expression of Clostridal [FeFe]-H2ases to characterize the O2-diffusion and inactivation mechanisms of CpI and CaI, and to engineer CaI for improved O2 tolerance and expression in C. reinhardtii.2,48,120 The J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) is developing an expression system for the O2-tolerant [NiFe]-H2ase from T. roseopersicina in a cyanobacterium with the intent of coupling photolytic water oxidation to H2 production.136 In support of this concept, the JCVI has successfully expressed an active [NiFe]-H2ase cloned from Sargasso Sea metagenomic DNA in T. roseopersicina.137 A group at NREL, conducting research with a similar objective, is introducing an O2-tolerant [NiFe]-H2ase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus CBS into cyanobacteria.138,139 Michael Adams’ group at the University of Georgia has expressed a [NiFe]-H2ase from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus in E. coli and successfully used the resulting purified H2ase for H2 production in a synthetic, enzyme-conversion system.140,141 In addition, researchers at the University of Hawaii are examining expression and activation of the H2-sensing, regulatory [NiFe]-H2ase, RH, from R. eutropha in E. coli.142PerspectiveThe genetic identification of the maturases that function in biosynthesis of the [FeFe] and [NiFe]-H2ases has supported a number of significant advances in the science, engineering, and functional expression of the enzymes. Nevertheless, there are many fundamental aspects of H2ase structure-function, regulation, expression, and H2 metabolism that remain to be elucidated. For each of the enzymes discussed in this review, progress related to the above topics is at different stages of R&D. Furthermore, the work is somewhat biased towards paradigms advanced from a few select model enzymes and organisms. As studies of the natural diversity of H2-metabolizing organisms advances and the depth of the molecular diversity is better understood, these paradigms are likely to evolve or encompass variations on a theme that reflects particular adaptations to specific environmental conditions. The richness of this diversity is evident in the molecular biology of the H2ases, which is well established in the examples summarized here. Additional research offers challenging future opportunities for new discovery at the fundamental level as well as for the use of this knowledge in the development of applied systems to produce renewable H2 to the benefit of society.

Christine M. English	Christine received her B.A. in Chemistry in 2001 from the College of Wooster in Wooster, OH, doing independent study on heat shock proteins from Zea mays. She received her Ph.D. in Biochemistry in 2006 from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, where she studied chromatin assembly factors and used X-ray crystallography to solve the 3D structure of a 3-protein complex. Her postdoctoral research focused on improving the oxygen sensitivity of [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzymes. She currently works for Navarro Research and Engineering in Golden, CO.
Carrie Eckert	Carrie received her B.S. in Biology in 1999 from the University of South Dakota, where she was involved in research on heat shock proteins in maize. She received her Ph.D. in Molecular Biology in 2006 from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, where she studied chromosome cohesion in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Her current research interests involve genetic manipulation of the bidirectional hydrogenase of the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis, to further elucidate the function of each subunit in biohydrogen production.
Katherine Brown	Kate received her Ph.D. in Biological Engineering from MIT in 2008, working with Prof. Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli. Her thesis work involved analyzing and controlling the interactions of DNA with nanoparticle surfaces. She investigated the effects of nanoparticle size and DNA sequence on DNA adsorption using binding isotherms and hybridization studies, and controlled adsorption by surface modification to alleviate non-covalent nucleotide adsorption. Dr Brown is currently studying semiconductor nanocrystal hybrid formation with hydrogenase enzymes, and focusing on light-driven control of enzyme activity.
Michael Seibert	Mike is a Research Fellow at NREL, where he has been engaged in photosynthesis, electron transport, biohydrogen, and hydrogenase research for the past 32 years. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in Biophysics and Molecular Biology, and spent six years in industry performing biotechnology and basic photobiology research prior to joining NREL. After managing a group of photoconversion scientists working in areas of photobiology, photochemistry, photoelectrochemistry, and synthesis and catalysis for a number of years at NREL, he returned to his current research interests, including water-splitting function in photosynthesis, reaction center spectroscopy, and algal biohydrogen production.
Paul W. King	Paul has been at NREL for eight years where he is currently a Senior Scientist. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Georgia in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, before making the journey west to Colorado to join the Photobiology Group at NREL. His projects are centered on fundamental studies of hydrogenase structure-function, photocatalytic hybrid complexes and development of hydrogenase electrodes. Collectively the research supports catalysis and charge-transfer schemes for renewable fuel production. At home Paul spends his time trying to keep pace with his wife's bike riding, yoga, trail running and various social activities.
