X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicates that an increase in laser intensity enhanced the breakdown of weak or metastable chemical bonds within IZO films, leading to the removal of hydroxide-related (OH) species and enhancement of metal oxide composition and oxygen vacancies (Ov); it facilitated carrier transport and led to an average mobility up to 9.0 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, compared with thermal annealing (TA), fs-laser annealing could reduce the thermal budget and more effectively realize the dehydroxylation behavior for OH-related species, resulting in higher charge mobility. These results clearly demonstrated that fs-laser ablation and annealing could provide a promising tool to significantly simplify the fabrication of metal oxide TFT arrays due to their advantages such as high resolution, high yield and low cost. Hence, these techniques show great potential to be applicable in the fabrication of large-area metal oxide TFT arrays for use in display devices and circuits.
Introduction
The requirement for high-performance, low-temperature and large-area thin-film transistors (TFTs) has triggered growing interest in the field of semiconductor materials and innovative processing techniques. As one of the most promising candidates, solution-processed metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) have numerous attractive advantages such as low-cost, transparency and high mobility.1–3 However, conventional solution-processing methods such as spin coating and blade coating were unable to achieve direct patterning for metal oxide TFT arrays, which are required for commercialization in display devices and circuits. Thus, relatively complicated processes including coating deposition and exposure and etching of selected materials were required for the fabrication of TFT arrays.4,5
In order to simplify the patterning processes, direct writing techniques such as microcontact printing, inkjet printing and screen printing were reported.6–8 Unfortunately, the microcontact printing method includes complicated stamping and inking steps, and the adhesion energy between the substrate and ink layer needs to be optimized.9 Screen printing requires an elaborate mask and usually results in very thick films.10 Moreover, the printing resolution was restricted to the screen mask. The inkjet printing method was restricted to ink formulation, surface tension and viscosity of solutions; the presence of the coffee ring causes the uneven deposition of thin films.11
Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to develop new techniques to simplify the processes of solution-processed TFT arrays that exhibit high electrical performance along with high resolution and high integration. The deep-ultraviolet-aided (DUV-aided) decomposition and patterning technique was proposed to lower the annealing temperature and pattern the semiconductor with DUV exposure.12,13 However, DUV patterning was not a direct process; it required a photomask and additives for strong DUV absorption and photoreactivity.12,13 Moreover, laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) is a promising technique, which has been used to fabricate the TFTs via the transfer of materials from the donor substrate to the acceptor substrate using a pulsed laser beam.14–17 However, a metallic sacrificial layer is required to prevent the high energy laser beam from damaging the semiconductor layer.14,17 Laser ablation is another promising technique in the field of laser processing technology. Nanosecond or continuous wave laser technique has been used to pattern the conducting films or organic films, such as silver microstructures, conducting electrodes, copper electrodes, metal nanoparticles, nanowires, ITO and graphene electrodes, and polycarbonate master molds.18–24 However, the films underwent the heat diffusion effect with nanosecond or continuous wave laser ablation, which resulted in unwanted extreme thermal damage, and to some extent, the ablation resolution was affected.25 Compared with the nanosecond or continuous wave laser, the femtosecond laser could provide an ultrashort pulse and high transient intensities at lower energy, which could avoid damage to the surrounding material as well as minimize the heat diffusion zone and light diffraction in the ablating materials for the high resolution patterning.26,27 The femtosecond laser has been applied in ablating conducting films and nanomaterials, such as metal nanoparticles, gold films (for tungsten photonic crystal structures), ITO films and graphene sheets.28–32 However, fs-laser ablation has never been used to pattern the metal oxide active layer for TFT arrays.
Moreover, to achieve high mobility, high temperate annealing (350 °C to 500 °C) was usually required to achieve the decomposition of precursor and avoid undesirable impurities for the solution-processed TFTs.33–35 Therefore, different strategies such as chemical energetic combustion process (using a fuel and oxidizer), ultraviolet irradiation, special high-pressure oxygen medium annealing, and hydrolysis annealing (for metal alkoxide precursor) have been proposed to reduce the annealing temperature.2,5,36,37 However, although respectable device performance was achieved, these methods still retained challenges with specific ambient and time-consuming annealing processes that restricted scalable fabrication of TFT arrays. Hence, a high-energy efficiency annealing technique at a lower temperature would significantly benefit the commercialization of solution-processed metal oxide TFT arrays. As a novel annealing technique, laser annealing (LA) has been utilized in various areas including poly-Si TFT-LCDs, solar cell modules, sensors and CMOS integrated circuits.38–41 However, only few reports have been made about using LA for metal oxide thin films.42–44 Moreover, all these reported studies used a nanosecond excimer laser that suffered from heat diffusion effect, and the temperature gradient induced by the heat effect affected the uniformity of annealing.25 As mentioned above, the fs-laser could provide an ultrashort pulse, which would significantly minimize the thermal effect for a precise and uniform annealing. However, fs-laser annealing has never been used for the annealing of metal oxide TFTs.
Therefore, in this study the fs-laser was, for the first time, utilized to pattern and anneal the solution-processed IZO arrays. The TFT arrays with small size (down to 32 μm), high quality and good uniformity were fabricated with the assistance of laser ablation. Moreover, the conversion of precursor to metal oxide lattices was completed by LA, which significantly reduced the thermal budget. Compared with traditional techniques, this approach significantly simplified the fabrication process of IZO arrays with advantages such as high yield, high quality and low cost. Eventually, the IZO arrays exhibited sufficiently uniform electrical characteristics with average mobility up to 9.0 cm2 V−1 s−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results demonstrated that the enhancement of metal oxide lattices and Ov as well as the decrease of OH-related species occurred with an increase in fs-laser intensity, resulting in an improvement in charge carrier mobility. The decrease of OH-related species is associated with the breakdown of weak or metastable chemical bonds with laser irradiation. High-energy photons from the fs-laser induce the photo-assisted condensation reaction, leading to the formation of metal–oxide bonds from metal hydroxides along with dehydroxylation behavior and the removal of residual impurity. The following photo-assisted densification reaction could facilitate the formation of strong metal–oxygen–metal (M–O–M) frameworks and a dense film. Moreover, compared with TA, fs-laser annealing could more effectively remove the OH-related species, resulting in higher charge carrier mobility. These results clearly demonstrated that fs-laser ablation and annealing is a promising tool for the fabrication of solution-processed metal oxide TFT arrays, and has great potential to be applicable in circuits and display devices.
Experimental
Materials and device fabrication
The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving indium nitrate hydrate (99.99% Aladdin) and zinc acetate dihydrate (99.99% Aladdin) in 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME, AR, Aladdin) with acetylacetone (AcAc, AR, Aladdin) to obtain 0.03 mol L−1 IZO solution (Zn/In = 1:1). The volume ratio of AcAc/2-ME was 1:4. The stock solution was stirred for 5 h at room temperature before use. IZO films were obtained by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 50 s. Then, the films were pre-baked to remove water and organic remnant solvent at 150 °C for 5 min. The coating and pre-baked steps were repeated 3 times and a 40 nm thick IZO film was obtained. The IZO films were then patterned using fs-laser ablation, which is described below. Then, the as-prepared thin films were annealed using the fs-laser or a hotplate. The mobility of devices prepared at different annealing temperatures (300–400 °C with 20 °C steps) and annealing times (40, 60 and 80 min) was characterized. The thermally annealed device with the best performance was achieved with annealing at 380 °C for 60 min.
To fabricate TFT devices, a 100 nm SiO2 layer was thermally grown on top of a heavily doped Si wafer viz., a gate dielectric layer. The bottom gate top contact configuration was fabricated on the SiO2/p + Si substrate. The substrates were cleaned using acetone, isopropyl alcohol and DI water, in sequence. The cleaned substrates were then dried with a N2 blower and treated with UV and ozone exposure. The deposition of IZO films was described above, and IZO films with an array size of 200 μm were used for the device tests. Finally, a 40 nm Au source and drain electrodes were deposited onto the IZO films. The channel length and width for all devices in this study were both 50 μm.
Laser ablation and annealing
A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The laser was generated by an ultrafast Ti:sapphire amplifier system (Coherent Astrella, pulse duration 45 fs, center wavelength 800 nm, repetition rate 1 kHz). After passing through a variable neutral density (ND) filter for controlling the output intensity, the output laser beam was focused by an objective lens on the surface of the sample. The sample was mounted on a three-axis translation stage. By controlling the movement of the stage and the on–off current ratio of the optical shutter with the driving system, the designed pattern was scanned by the laser on the sample. The morphology of the sample was monitored using a CCD after each laser processing. Moreover, a dust collector with air flow was always working beside the sample to collect the processing dust during laser ablation. The laser intensity and scanning speed used were experimentally optimized parameters considering the quality and connectivity of the laser scanning path. The optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were applied to investigate the ablation results. In this study, when a laser intensity of 350 mJ cm−2 and scanning speed of 300 μm s−1 was used for ablation, sharp edges on the ablated film were obtained (as shown in Fig. 2) along with the best device performance. Three different laser intensities of 41, 70, and 99 mJ cm−2 were used for annealing the IZO films. Moreover, the high-quality laser beam played a critical role for the moderate experiment results. The beam shape for these two processes was carefully adjusted by optical modules and monitored by the CCD. For laser ablation, the Gaussian laser beam was focused on the surface of the IZO film using an objective lens so that the material could be effectively removed. However, in order to obtain a homogeneous light–matter interaction condition with a large-area for laser annealing, the beam was adjusted to a rectangular profile via an optical shaping system including a cylindrical lens during the laser annealing process. In this study, all the fabrication processes were operated in air-ambient in a clean room.

Device characterization
Optical microscopic images were provided by a BX51P polarizing microscope (Olympus, Japan). Images of the patterns were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (Nova NanoSEM 230). The thickness and depth profile of IZO arrays were obtained with the Stylus Profiler (Dektak XT, Bruker). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Multimode V system, tapping mode) was used to investigate the surface morphology and roughness of the film. The electrical performance was measured under ambient conditions using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200) and a probe station. The statistical distribution of TFT mobility was obtained from 40 TFT devices using LA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 Xi spectrometer. The binding energy of O 1s was calibrated using the binding energy of the C 1s peak (285.0 eV) as the reference.
Results and discussion
By controlling the sample translational stage and the optical shutter with the driving system, a high-quality pattern on the sample could be obtained with optimized laser ablation parameters. The SEM images with different laser ablation intensities are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It was observed that the removal of material was enhanced with an increase in laser ablation intensity when it was greater than the threshold intensity of 250 mJ cm−2. Fig. 2a shows the image of IZO arrays patterned by the optimized laser ablation parameters using a laser intensity of 350 mJ cm−2 and a scanning speed of 300 μm s−1. The square region represents the IZO films’ layer; the brown cross region is the SiO2 layer, above which the IZO layer was ablated using the fs-laser. As shown in Fig. 2a, the laser ablating lines were straight, and the square units of the IZO arrays were uniform. The length and width of the IZO arrays are 32 μm. Fig. 2b shows the depth profile of a section region in Fig. 2a, which indicates the formation of a uniform array with sharp and fine edges.
For explaining laser ablation there are two different models: the thermal model and non-thermal plasma model. The thermal model assumes that the lattices are heated to the melting of the materials. This model is well suited for picosecond or longer pulses.26 Moreover, the non-thermal plasma model suggests that the lattices remain vibrationally cold during fs-laser ablation.26,45 The fs-laser ablation is the interaction between high-energy photons and the surfaces of the material, which includes the following steps: ionization of electrons with photon absorption, transfer of energy to the lattice, the phase or structural modification emerging in the irradiated target, and expelling the surface material from the films in the vapor phase.27,46–48 In other words, if electrons gain energy greater than the Fermi energy, they could escape from the ablated target. With the subsequent charge separation between the parent ions and escaped electrons, an electric field is created that pulls the ions out of the target to realize ablation.49 Moreover, the pulse width of the fs-lasers is within 10−15 s, and the timescale is shorter than the electron–phonon scattering time (about 1 ps). This allows the laser to achieve very high transient intensities at lower energies, and yields significant material removal in irradiated zones. It should be noted that the fs-laser ablation process could be considered as a direct solid–vapor (or solid–plasma) transition. In the picosecond timescale the plasma phases are created, followed by a rapid expansion and material removal.45 Particularly, the electronic system could directly be excited and result in the disordered lattice, while the lattices could remain vibrationally cold.26,45 As the interaction time is very short (the fs-laser pulse ends before any ions are thermally excited), it inhibits the diffusion of heat into non-irradiated zones, which leads to sharp and fine edges.25 In this study, the fs-laser was used to ablate and realize the sharp edges of the film array, which indicates that the solid-plasma transition primarily occurred during fs-laser ablation.
To further simplify the process of device fabrication and reduce the thermal budget, LA was used to replace TA as it lowers the temperature of the process. Fig. 3 shows the transfer and output characteristics of IZO TFTs treated with TA and LA using different laser intensities from 41 to 99 mJ cm−2. It shows that the drain current (IDS) increased and the threshold voltage (Vth) shifted to the negative gate bias direction with an increase in laser intensity. As shown in Fig. 3b, the fs-laser annealed TFTs exhibited good saturation and pinch-off behaviors. The field-effect mobility (μFE), subthreshold slope (SS) and interface trap density (Dit) were calculated from the following equations according to the conventional TFT model. (1) (2) (3)where L and W are the channel length and width, respectively; Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate insulator; IDS is the drain-source current; VGS is the gate voltage; q is the elementary electron charge; and kT is the thermal energy. The device characteristics with various laser intensities and TA are summarized in Table 1. The values indicate that the performance of the laser annealed devices is comparable to and even higher than that of the thermally annealed devices. The device fabricated using LA with intensity of 99 mJ cm−2 exhibited a mobility of 9.0 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 85% higher than that of the thermally annealed device (5.4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, the mobility and on–off current ratio increases with an increase in laser intensity. Furthermore, SS and Dit decreased with an increase in laser intensity. These results indicate that an increase in laser intensity from 41 to 99 mJ cm−2 could decrease the interfacial trap states at the interface between the channel and the dielectric layer, which is attributed to the photo-assisted condensation and densification reaction with laser irradiation, resulting in the improvement of interface quality.50–52Fig. 4 shows the statistical distribution about the mobility of 40 devices with laser ablation and subsequent LA process with an intensity of 99 mJ cm−2. They exhibited similar mobility, which indicates that good device uniformity could be achieved with laser patterning and subsequent laser annealing. In addition, the surface morphologies of the IZO thin films were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The surface roughness values of the thin film fabricated without and with LA (99 mJ cm−2) are 0.255 nm and 0.302 nm, respectively. It indicates that the surface roughness was almost not impacted by LA using an intensity below the threshold. Furthermore, the transfer characteristic of IZO TFTs (VDS = 1 V) is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As a comparison, the characteristics of the devices in the linear region are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The trend of linear mobility was in good agreement with the mobility in the saturation region.

In order to understand the mechanism, XPS measurements were carried out to obtain the qualitative chemical properties of IZO films. Fig. 5a–c shows the O 1s spectra of the IZO films with LA of different intensities. XPS spectra were fitted with Gaussian–Lorentzian functions after baseline subtraction, and the peak positions were fixed based on the particular binding energy. Three resulting deconvoluted sub-peaks were used to represent the O 1s spectra. The binding energies of 529.9 eV, 531.0 eV, and 531.9 eV correspond to oxygen in metal oxide lattices (M–O) (In and Zn), oxygen vacancies (Ov), and loosely bound oxygen such as hydroxide-related species (OH), respectively.3,53,54 The area ratio of the sub-peak to the total O 1s peak could be calculated from the deconvoluted peak, and the results are summarized in Table 2. It shows that the relative quantity of Ov increases from 36.7% to 43.5%, and that of M–O lattices increases from 39.9% to 47.9% with an increase of laser intensity from 41 to 99 mJ cm−2. In contrast, the relative quantities of OH-related species decreased monotonically with an increase in laser intensity. The O 1s results indicate that the generation of Ov and formation of M–O lattices within IZO films were strongly associated with laser intensity. An increase in laser intensity causes the enhanced breakdown of weak or metastable chemical bonds within IZO films, leading to further removal of OH-related species and enhancement of M–O lattices and Ov. As Ov could act as donors, the increase of Ov resulted in the increase of electron concentration, leading to the negative shift in Vth. This is consistent with the transfer characteristics shown in Fig. 3a. Moreover, sufficient donors could fill in acceptor states near the conduction band minimum (CBM) to form electron transport paths, facilitating electron transport and resulting in an increase in carrier mobility.55 It has been reported that dispersed vacant s-states with short interaction distances constitute the CBM for efficient carrier transport in amorphous-oxide semiconductors (AOSs), which could be achieved in oxide lattices but not so evidently in the hydroxide lattice.53,56 Therefore, formation of the M–O lattice is crucial to facilitate carrier transport.

Furthermore, the O 1s spectrum of the IZO films with TA is shown in Fig. 5d and the area ratio of the sub-peaks to the total O 1s peak is summarized in Table 2. The results obtained show that the relative quantity of OH-related species is 14.7% for the TA sample, which is significantly higher than that in the LA sample fabricated using a laser intensity of 99 mJ cm−2 (8.6%). This implies that, compared with TA, fs-laser irradiation could more effectively realize the dehydroxylation behavior for OH-related species and form M–O lattices. When the as-prepared coarse film was irradiated with laser pulses, high energy photons from the fs-laser could realize the photo-assisted condensation reaction, leading to the formation of metal–oxide bonds with low atomic-scale order from metal hydroxides along with the effective removal of OH-related species and residual impurity.2,3,5,13 Moreover, the subsequent photo-assisted densification reaction could facilitate the formation of well-linked metal–oxygen–metal (M–O–M) frameworks as well as the superior arrangement of metal cations and oxygen anions to the lattice sites with an atomic-scale order, resulting in the formation of a dense IZO film.3,5,57
For solution-processed high quality metal oxide thin films, a thermally driven condensation and densification reaction such as TA, is required to convert metal hydroxides to metal oxides. However, fs-laser annealing is attributed to the photo-assisted condensation and densification reaction, which facilitates the effective conversion of the precursor and the removal of impurity along with the formation of a dense film. The low impurity concentrations and dense M–O–M frameworks lead to the improvement of device performance.3,5,57 Moreover, the decrease of OH-related species resulted in the increase in the amount of M–O lattices and the formation of oxide frameworks using LA, thus facilitating charge transport. Moreover, the increase of Ov increased the carrier concentration, which also improved the carrier mobility.56 Therefore, compared with TA, fs-laser annealing realized low thermal budget and the effective dehydroxylation behavior for OH-related species, which improved the formation of M–O lattices and Ov, resulting in higher charge carrier mobility.
Therefore, the above results clearly show that the uniform IZO arrays with fine and sharp edges could be conveniently achieved by fs-laser ablation, which significantly simplified the fabrication process of IZO arrays for its commercial application in display and circuits. Moreover, fs-laser annealing enables the conversion of precursor to M–O lattices, which significantly improves the energy efficiency compared with TA. More importantly, compared with TA, fs-laser annealing would more effectively remove the OH-related species, which improves the formation of M–O lattices and Ov, resulting in higher charge carrier mobility.
Conclusion
In summary, the fs-laser was applied for the first time to simultaneously pattern and anneal the active channel for the fabrication of metal oxide TFT arrays, which significantly simplified the fabrication process and improved the energy efficiency compared with traditional techniques. Uniform patterned arrays with sharp edges and small feature size were achieved using fs-laser ablation. Moreover, photo-assisted conversion of precursor to metal oxide lattices was successfully achieved using fs-laser annealing. Our analysis indicates that an increase in laser intensity enhanced the breakdown of weak or metastable chemical bonds within IZO films, leading to the removal of OH-related species and enhancement of M–O lattices and Ov, facilitating carrier transport with an average mobility up to 9.0 cm2 V−1 s−1. Moreover, a negative shift in the threshold voltage was observed with an increase in LA intensity, which indicates that a judicious selection of laser intensity could optimize the Vth to reduce power consumption. More importantly, compared with TA, fs-laser annealing could more effectively realize the dehydroxylation behavior for OH-related species, resulting in higher charge mobility. These results demonstrated that fs-laser ablation and annealing could provide a promising tool to significantly simplify the fabrication of metal oxide TFT arrays with advantages such as high resolution, high yield and low cost, which shows great potential to be applicable in the development of scalable metal oxide TFT arrays for display and circuits.
