    , Accepted 25th July 2017First published on 25th July 2017AbstractZr substitution in the anatase TiO2 lattice with exposed high energy facets has been accomplished by a solvothermal process and characterized in detail. We observed that the selection of the solvent (n-propanol, nP or iso-propanol, iP) in the presence of titanium tetrachloride–zirconium n-propoxide mixture and structure directors played a crucial role in tuning the morphology, crystal structure and exposed facets of the resulting nanocrystals. Rietveld refinement of the PXRD data revealed the formation of Ti0.665Zr0.335O1.955 (TZnP) and Ti0.912Zr0.088O1.963 (TZiP) nanocrystals. TEM confirmed the presence of low index high energy {100} and {001} facets in cube-like TZnP and hollow spherical TZiP decorated with truncated crystallites, respectively. XPS revealed the presence of Ti3+ (13–16%) defect states in both the systems. These nanocrystalline materials were explored as co-catalyst free photocatalysts in solar water splitting for H2 generation. Interestingly, Zr modified photocatalysts (TZnP and TZiP) showed H2 evolution rates of 90 and 356 μmol g−1 after 6 h, respectively without any support of a Pt co-catalyst. Further, the overall solar light to energy conversion efficiencies of TZnP and TZiP as photoanodes in dye sensitized solar cell (DSSCs) have been investigated and their efficiencies were found to be 5.40 and 7.52%, respectively. Therefore, these Zr modified TiO2 nanocrystals could be very promising as cost-effective photocatalysts for future fuel generation and DSSC materials.
1. Introduction
Considering the global issues of energy resources, significant attention has been paid to the synthesis of TiO2 based photoactive materials that can efficiently generate future H2 fuel through solar water splitting or harvest solar light in terms of energy.1–4 However, pure TiO2 has some shortcomings due to its wide band gap, visible light absorptivity and high recombination rate of the excitons. In this perspective, hierarchical TiO2 and/or TiO2 based hybrid materials with exposed high energy facets have attracted considerable interest to improve photocatalysis and solar energy harvesting capability.5 The suitable atomic and electronic structures of these exposed high energy facets facilitate the charge carrier transfer, which is responsible for the superior photoactivity of such materials.6–9 Nevertheless, the controlled synthesis of hierarchical nanostructures possessing exposed facets and/or pores is also very challenging in order to obtain materials with improved properties.10–13
Considering the above facts, enormous interest is being devoted to grow such low-index facets since the report on anatase TiO2 with a more active exposed {001} facet.5,14–18 In this context, {001} and {100} facets with five coordinate unsaturated Ti (Ti5C) atoms are considered to be highly reactive for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Thus, experimental results and theoretical presumption lead to a great interest towards the fabrication and photocatalytic applications of such types of crystals.18 Very recently it has also been demonstrated that the introduction of lattice strain within a nanoscale semiconductor system can alter its band structure.19 So, it is believed that the incorporation of foreign atoms into the lattice of anatase TiO2 would be beneficial to obtain improved photocatalysts. In particular, substitution of Ti by larger atoms like Zr could lead to significant lattice distortion resulting in modified photocatalytic properties.19,20 Because of such hetero-atom doping, the generated defects would not only be capable of modifying the band gaps but also could play a role as charge-trapping centers in restricting charge recombination.12 The number of defects depends on the particle size, crystalline structure and Zr-to-Ti ratio of the photocatalyst.21 Moreover, it has been reported that Zr-incorporated hybrid TiO2 materials possess high surface acidity due to an imbalance of surface charges because of the formation of Ti–O–Zr bridges.21 The high concentration of surface –OH groups resulting from such surface acidity inhibits recombination of excitons by trapping photogenerated holes and thus helps in improving the photoactivity. However, incorporation of Zr4+ within the anatase lattice system without introducing severe lattice distortion is difficult because both TiO2 and ZrO2 have a tendency to form solid solution or binary oxide composites.22,23 Overruling the difficulties in the synthesis of TiO2 crystals with intrinsic Zr-incorporation and simultaneous development of high energy facets, we believe that a combination of morphology control along with incorporation of Zr in the anatase TiO2 lattice is possible, and it would result in a new photoactive material.
Accordingly, in the present work we have planned a simple strategic route that involves a surfactant (CTAB) and solvent co-assisted synthesis of intrinsically Zr-modified anatase TiO2 nanocrystals Ti0.665Zr0.335O1.955 (TZnP) and Ti0.912Zr0.088O1.963 (TZiP) with high energy exposed facets. We observed that the polarity of the solvent (n-propanol and i-propanol) used in the synthesis along with CTAB and F− ions played important roles in achieving exposed {100} and {001} facets and hierarchical structures. Crystal structural evaluation of these materials (by Rietveld refinement of the powder XRD patterns) confirmed the formation of Ti0.665Zr0.335O1.955 and Ti0.912Zr0.088O1.963 nanocrystals. Further, the morphologies, chemical states of the elements, optical properties and photocatalytic activities of these materials were thoroughly characterized. Solar energy harvesting properties of these materials were investigated through solar water splitting and application in a DSSC. Interestingly, these new lattice modified nanostructured Ti1−xZrxO2−y showed efficient H2 evolution ability under simulated solar light of intensity 60 mW cm−2 without any noble metal as a co-catalyst. It is noteworthy here that the pristine TiO2 synthesized as the control sample was unable to catalyse the solar light induced H2 evolution under similar reaction conditions. Notably, loading of noble metals (mostly Pt) on the surface of TiO2 not only promotes H2 formation but also facilitates charge (electrons and holes) separation via solid-state junction (metal/semiconductor) generation.24–26 For this reason most of the previous research studies in this field explored the H2 evolution activity of noble metal loaded TiO2.26–28 Besides this, synthesis of TiO2 photocatalysts with intrinsically generated active centers (Ti3+ and/or oxygen vacancies) is another approach that involves heat-treatment at high temperature and high H2 atmospheric pressure.28–31 But use of such noble metals as co-catalysts or calcination under a high H2 atmosphere pressure makes the process and the photocatalyst expensive and thus not suitable for large scale production and application. In this aspect, our newly synthesized TZnP and TZiP can be considered as cost-effective photocatalysts for H2 evolution through solar water splitting because they do not need either of these modifications. H2 evolution rates of 15 and 59 μmol h−1 g−1 have been achieved for TZnP and TZiP, respectively, which have been found to be better than recent reports on co-catalyst free H2 evolution materials.3,32 In DSSCs, TZnP and TZiP also showed improved efficiencies of 5.40 and 7.52%, respectively, as photoanode materials under 1 sun conditions.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials used
Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), n-propanol (nP) and iso-propanol (iP) from Merck, Germany; zirconium n-propoxide (70 wt% in nP; ZrnP) from Sigma-Aldrich, cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB) from SD Fine Chemicals. All these chemicals were used as-received without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of photocatalysts
The synthesis starts with the preparation of saturated NH4F solutions in nP and iP (0.4 g NH4F in 30 ml solvent; stirred for 2 h and decanted). 1 g of TiCl4 was added to each of these saturated solutions under stirring conditions and allowed to stir for 15 min. After that 0.1 g CTAB followed by 1.225 g ZrnP were added to these solutions. A nominal Ti:Zr molar ratio of 1:0.5 was maintained. The solution mixtures were then stirred for 1 h followed by transferring them to Teflon lined stainless steel autoclaves for solvothermal treatment at 180 °C for 6 h. The powder products were then collected by membrane filtration and dried at 70 °C. Finally the samples were heat-treated at 450 °C (rate of heating: 1 °C min−1) for 4 h in air. The samples are labelled as TZnP and TZiP, respectively according to the solvent used. Two control samples were also prepared without the addition of the ZrnP precursor and labelled as TnP and TiP, respectively.
2.3 Characterization
To perform powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments, the samples were ground into homogeneous fine powders using agate mortars and pestles. These ground powder samples were densely packed in rectangular Perspex sample holders for the PXRD experiments. Room temperature PXRD data of both samples were collected using a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer in parallel beam geometry in θ/2θ mode. The diffraction data were collected over an angular 2θ range of 10–120° with 0.12° min−1 scan rate using copper rotating anode (9 kW) generated Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), selected with a curved incident-beam germanium [Ge(111)] monochromator.
Field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) images of TZnP and TZiP were obtained with a Zeiss Supra 35VP field emission scanning electron microscope. The transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis was done with a JEOL JEM 2100F (operating at 200 kV) electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray scattering analysis (EDS) system. Raman spectra of the samples were obtained with a Renishaw InVia microRaman spectrometer with a 514 nm laser source. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Nicolet 380 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 (resolution 4 cm−1) using the KBr pellet method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a PHI 5000 Versa probe II XPS system having an Al Kα source and a charge neutralizer at room temperature and the base pressure was maintained at 6 × 10−10 mbar with an energy resolution of 0.6 eV. Nitrogen sorption analysis was carried out at −196 °C with a Quantachrome Autosorb instrument after degassing the sample at 200 °C under vacuum (10−2 T) for 2 h.
2.4 Photocatalytic water splitting for H2 evolution
Photocatalytic H2 evolution was carried out from a 10 vol% aqueous methanol solution under simulated solar light of intensity of 60 mW cm−2 (Oriel AAA, AM 1.5G simulator). For this purpose, 5 mg of the photocatalyst (TZnP or TZiP) was dispersed in 5 ml DI water/methanol (90/10 vol%) solution and ultrasonicated. The solution was then placed under simulated solar light and the amount of gas generated was measured after 6 h using a gas chromatograph (Clarus 480, Perkin Elmer). Control experiments were also done with pristine anatase TiO2 samples (TnP and TiP).
2.5 Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) fabrication
Fabrication of DSSCs was done following our previous report.33 A viscous paste was prepared with both the samples and two cells were prepared with an active area of ∼0.08 cm2 and thickness of ∼6 μm. The films were soaked in N719 dye solution for 24 h and finally assembled with Pt deposited FTO as the counter electrode in the sandwich form. The electrolyte solution contained 0.03 (M) I2, 0.05 (M) LiI and 0.3 (M) 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide in an acetonitrile/butanol (1/1 vol%) mixed solvent. Photocurrent measurements were done under 1 sun condition with a Keithley instrument (4200 SCS) attached to a solar simulator (model SS50AAA-EM) from Photo Emission Tech., Inc. (Camarillo, California). DSSC measurements were also done with pristine anatase TiO2 samples (TnP and TiP) under similar experimental conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase analysis by XRD and Raman spectral analysis
Initially, a thorough high angle XRD analysis was undertaken to evaluate the crystalline phase of the obtained materials. XRD patterns of TZnP and TZiP (Fig. 1a) show the formation of anatase TiO2 with a shifting of diffraction peaks towards lower 2θ values (Fig. 1a) compared to the control samples (TnP and TiP) of the pure anatase structure (Fig. S1a, ESI†). This is due to the fact that a larger atomic species Zr has been successfully incorporated in the lattice framework of TiO2. However, a difference in the shifting of diffraction peaks and crystallinity has been observed for TZnP and TZiP samples. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1a) of TZiP shows relatively smaller shifting of peaks and the presence of a tiny fraction of the amorphous component. We believe that such an alteration has resulted from the use of a different solvent system because all other experimental conditions were kept similar during the synthesis.

To support the XRD results, Raman spectral analysis (Fig. 1b) of the Zr modified samples was carried out and also compared with the pure control sample (TnP or TiP). It should be mentioned here that the Raman spectra of control samples (TnP and TiP) (Fig. S1b, ESI†) were found to be similar, as also observed in XRD. TZnP and TZiP samples showed the presence of anatase TiO2 related bands Eg [Eg(1)], B1g, A1g and the overtone of Eg [Eg(3)].33 However, in comparison to the control samples significant shifting of Eg(1) (from 150 to 136 cm−1) and B1g bands (from 396 to 380 cm−1) was observed towards the lower wavenumber region for Zr-incorporated samples without any change in A1g and Eg(3) bands. This is because Eg(1) and B1g bands are associated with the atomic vibration of Ti atoms whereas the other two Raman bands originate from the atomic vibration of oxygen.34,35 Thus replacement of Ti4+ (56 pm) by the larger Zr4+ (72 pm) resulted in the increase of the metal ion–oxygen bond length in the lattice, and further shifted the Eg(1) and B1g bands towards the lower wavenumber region. Therefore, this result fully corroborated the information obtained from the XRD analysis of the samples.
3.2 XPS analysis
The surface chemical states of the elements present in TZnP and TZiP have been explored by a thorough XPS analysis. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the survey scans of TZnP and TZiP, where the binding energy peaks corresponding to C, O, Ti and Zr can be observed. The weak peak for C 1s might come from the small amount of organic impurity present.32Fig. 2a and b show the high resolution Ti 2p spectra where two sets of peaks at 458.4, 458.8 eV and 464.2, 464.6 eV can be assigned to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of the Ti4+ chemical state of TZnP and TZiP, respectively.36,37 Notably, the presence of a prominent peak in the range of ∼456.6–457 eV revealed the presence of the Ti3+ active chemical state in the samples TZnP and TZiP.37 Further, deconvolution of both the spectra showed the existence of ∼16% and ∼13% Ti3+ in TZnP and TZiP, respectively. It should be noted here that the pure TiO2 control sample shows almost the absence of Ti3+ species (Fig. S3, ESI†). A relatively higher degree of shifting of the Ti 2p binding energy towards the lower energy region was observed for TZnP compared to TZiP, which is expected to be due to the higher amount of Zr insertion in the TiO2 lattice in the former case. To support this, the high resolution Zr 3d spectra of the samples were also deconvoluted. Fig. 2c and d show the corresponding deconvoluted Zr 3d spectra of TZnP and TZiP where the presence of free ZrO2 was also found along with Zr species engaged within the Ti–O– framework.38 The shifting of the Zr 3d5/2 binding energy towards the lower region can be attributed to the substituted Zr4+ in the lattice.38 Quantitative analysis obtained from the deconvoluted Zr 3d5/2 peaks of the samples indicated the presence of a higher amount of free ZrO2 in TZiP compared to TZnP. The O 1s spectra (Fig. 2e and f) have been fitted with two peaks at ∼530 and 531 eV assigned to O2− and surface –OH of the inorganic framework, respectively.38

3.3 Structural refinement and analysis
Due to the limited number of peaks in the lower 2θ region, ab initio indexing of the powder pattern was difficult. Nevertheless, a tetragonal unit cell with lattice parameters that approximately match with the lattice parameters of TiO2 (anatase)39 could be identified using the computer program DICVOL.40 A subsequent successful Le Bail refinement41 of the powder profiles with Laue group P4/mmm using the software Jana 2006 (ref. 42) confirmed the correctness of the lattice parameters. Structure solutions of Zr-incorporated samples by the charge flipping method using the program Superflip43 yielded approximately the structure of TiO2 (anatase).39 Further crystal structure refinements were carried out by the Rietveld method44 using the Jana 2006 software.42 Rietveld refinements were carried out using the space group I41/amd employing pseudo-Voigt profile functions. Background points were modelled using Legendre polynomials with 30 terms. Initial refinements with the chemical formula TiO2 expectedly revealed discrepancies between the observed and calculated profiles. This was resolved by introducing Zr atom with partial occupancy at the position of the Ti atom. During the refinements, individual site occupancies of Zr and Ti were refined keeping the total site occupancy constrained to be fixed at 1. Since XPS measurements of the sample indicate that a certain percentage of the Ti atoms are in the 3+ oxidation state, we have decided to refine the site occupancy of the oxygen atom in order to quantify possible vacancies at the oxygen atom sites. Free refinements of site occupancies of the Zr/Ti and O atoms together were not successful, and thus they were refined separately. Refinements of the site occupancies of the oxygen atoms were continued until convergence was met. During the final refinement cycles, the site occupancies of the oxygen atoms were kept fixed to the values as obtained from the previous refinement cycles (0.9775 and 0.9815 for TZnP and TZiP, respectively). Thermal parameters of all atoms were refined isotropically. Final Rietveld refinements including preferred orientation corrections according to the March & Dollase method45 yielded excellent fit to the experimental data (Table S1, ESI†).
The fitted XRD patterns and the perspective views of the crystal structures of TZnP and TZiP are shown in Fig. 3a and b and corresponding crystallographic data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Bond distances and angles are given in Table S2 (ESI†). It can be seen from Table S1 (ESI†) that the final Rietveld refinements resulted in atomic compositions of Ti0.665Zr0.335O1.955 and Ti0.912Zr0.088O1.963 for TZnP and TZiP, respectively indicating the presence of a small amount of vacancies at the oxygen atom sites in both the samples. This finding qualitatively matches with the results obtained from the XPS measurements. Table S2 (ESI†) shows relatively longer O–O, Ti/Zr–O and Ti/Zr–Ti/Zr bond distances in TZnP and TZiP samples than the comparable distances of TiO2 (anatase) available in the literature.39 This is due to the fact that a larger atomic species (Zr) has been incorporated in the anatase TiO2 lattice. It is thus expected that Ti atoms will be slightly less densely packed in these samples in comparison to TiO2 (anatase). Accordingly, O–O, Ti–O and Ti–Ti bonding features in TZnP and TZiP will be somewhat different from the pure anatase phase. It can be further noticed that the incorporation of Zr atoms in the structure of TZiP is ∼26% less than the sample TZnP.

3.4 Electron microscopic study
The morphology and crystal structural features of TZnP and TZiP along with exposed crystal facets were investigated by thorough electron microscopic (FESEM and TEM) studies. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of both the samples indicate the formation of single crystalline anatase TiO2 with high energy facets.46 FESEM (Fig. 4a) and TEM (Fig. 4b) images of TZnP show the formation of deformed cube-like nanocrystals with a dimension of ∼50–100 nm. The presence of pores in such nanocubes can also be seen from the TEM images (Fig. 4b and S4, ESI†). The fringe pattern in HRTEM (Fig. 4c) with a spacing of 0.38 nm confirmed the presence of the exposed {100} facet of anatase TiO2.47 Moreover, the SAED pattern (Fig. 4d) shows symmetrical arrangement of (100) (d = 0.38 nm) and (002) (d = 0.48 nm) indexed atomic planes within the crystal.8,18 The formation of a hollow spherical urchin like architecture was observed from the FESEM (Fig. 4e and f) and low magnification TEM (Fig. 4g) images of TZiP. It can be seen from the magnified portion of the FESEM (Fig. 4f) and TEM images (Fig. 4g–j) that the exterior of such a hierarchical hollow structure is decorated with truncated spiky nanocrystals with the exposed {001} active facet of TiO2.48 Further magnified TEM images (Fig. 4h and i) reveal the presence of tiny nanocrystals as well as a porous network in the TZiP nanostructure. The HRTEM (viewed through the [11] zone axis; Fig. 4j and k) acquired from the edges of truncated crystals shows the presence of (101) and (011) lattice fringes (d = 0.35 nm) with an angle of 82.4° which is consistent with a previous report on TiO2 with exposed {001} facets.49,50 Here the symmetric arrangement of the diffraction spots in the SAED pattern (Fig. 4l) corresponds to the (200) and (020) atomic lattice spacing (d = 0.19 nm) of single crystalline anatase TiO2 revealing the formation of exposed {001} active facets.51 Additionally, discontinuity and local fading of lattice fringes (Fig. 4c and k) for both the cases (TZnP and TZiP) revealed the presence of defect states in the nanocrystals.30 The EDS area mapping of TZnP and TZiP was carried out to confirm the homogeneous distribution of Ti, Zr and O all over the nanostructures. Fig. 5 shows the co-existence of Ti and Zr in the cube-shaped TZnP and hollow spherical TZiP decorated with truncated nanospikes. The quantitative analysis of Ti:Zr obtained from EDS was found to be close to 1:0.43 and 1:0.45 in the cases of TZnP and TZiP samples, respectively. The quantitative analysis of the Ti:Zr data was further confirmed by ICP-AAS analysis of the samples where the values obtained are ∼1:0.45. It is noteworthy here that the ICP and EDS data were quite close in both the cases because they provide information about the total Zr content. The quantitative data obtained from EDS and ICP-AAS of TZnP (Ti0.665Zr0.335O1.955) were found to be closer to the Rietveld refinement data (Section 3.3) compared to TZiP (Ti0.912Zr0.088O1.963). The Rietveld refinement data revealed that ∼33.5 and ∼8.8 at% of Zr get introduced in the crystalline TiO2 lattice of TZnP and TZiP, respectively. It is therefore clear that in the case of TZiP a significant amount of Zr remains associated with Ti in the bottom part of the hollow sphere as a nanoporous matrix (Fig. 4g–i).

3.5 N2 sorption analysis
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) N2 sorption analysis (Fig. 6) was carried out in order to study the porosity and surface area of TZnP and TZiP. A typical type-IV adsorption–desorption isotherm (Fig. 6a) was observed for the cube-shaped TZnP with a symmetric H2 hysteresis loop. This is characteristic of mesoporous materials and the corresponding surface area value was found to be 127 m2 g−1. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution (inset of Fig. 6a) of TZnP (estimated from the desorption branch of the isotherm) revealed the presence of mesopores peaking at ∼10.1 nm in diameter within the cube, which is also confirmed from TEM (Fig. S4; ESI†).

However, TZiP showed a modified type-IV sorption isotherm (Fig. 6b) with a stepwise change in the adsorption–desorption branches, and the surface area value obtained was ∼131 m2 g−1. As a consequence, a mixed hysteresis loop was observed revealing the presence of two different pore sizes in this hollow spherical architecture decorated with nanocrystals. Accordingly, the BJH pore size distribution (estimated from the desorption branch of the isotherm)28,33 of TZiP showed two distinct porosity regions (inset of Fig. 6b) with peaks at ∼5 and ∼11.4 nm. The latter peak is relatively broader compared to the former. TEM studies of TZiP (Fig. 4g and h) revealed embedment of nanocrystals with sharp edges of different sizes on the outer part of a porous shell. The underneath region shows the presence of pores along with tiny nanocrystals (Fig. 4i). The narrow pore size region (∼5 nm; inset of Fig. 6b) of TZiP therefore originates from the porous bottom part of the hollow sphere (Fig. 4i). The relatively larger pore size (∼11.4 nm) could be associated with the interstitial pores that originated from the overall structural features.
3.6 Growth mechanism of TZnP and TZiP
A plausible growth mechanism of TZnP and TZiP has been suggested by considering all the above characterizations. Here we will discuss the way Zr4+ gets incorporated in the Ti–O–Ti network, and how the surfactant, fluoride ion (F−) and the solvents play their roles in controlling the morphology and facilitate the growth of high energy facets. We believe that at the very initial stage of hydrolysis, Zr4+ replaced some Ti4+ centers of the hydrolyzed inorganic network formed from TiCl4, and finally after 6 h of hydrothermal reaction the anatase TiO2 single crystals with the Zr modified lattice were obtained. A nominal molar ratio of Ti:Zr ≈ 1:0.5 has been chosen to synthesize such composite nanostructures. However, depending upon the nature of the solvent, a difference in Zr insertion into the Ti–O–Ti network was observed from Rietveld refinement of the PXRD patterns. This is because the complex forming tendency of iP with the Ti4+ unit restricted the introduction of the Zr moiety into the Ti–O–Ti network. As a result, in the case of TZiP, lesser amount of Zr was found to be introduced in the anatase TiO2 lattice and crystals with the molecular formula of Ti0.912Zr0.088O1.963 were obtained. In contrast, in nP medium, where complex forming ability is less, nanocrystals with high Zr-content Ti0.665Zr0.335O1.955 (TZnP) were formed. It has been understood that in the case of TZiP, the excess amount of Zr remained associated with TiO2 as an underneath nanoporous matrix forming a hollow sphere-like structure. Interestingly, the reaction conditions with either of the solvent also facilitated the formation of Ti3+ defect states within the systems.
It has been reported that the presence of CTAB as a surfactant can play a role in producing single crystalline TiO2 with high energy facets.18 At the initial stage of hydrolysis-condensation reactions, the hydrolysed Zr modified [Ti(OH)6]2− clusters remain surrounded by the positively charged CTA+ cations.17 This situation would facilitate more adsorption of smaller F− anions on the surfaces. Under these conditions when the nucleation and subsequent growth of Zr–TiO2 are initiated, the interaction of F− as well as the solvent would occur on the preferential nascent facets, and thus control the overall crystal structure.5 The growth of two different types of crystal facets in the cases of TZnP and TZiP could be due to the following reason. The polarities of nP and iP are different.7,52 Therefore it is expected that in an acidic environment (hydrolysis of TiCl4 released HCl) the relatively less polar (CH3)2CHO− that originated from iP would preferably adsorb on the less polar (001) atomic plane of TiO2 and also facilitate co-adsorption of F− on the same plane (001).5 As a result, growth of the (001) atomic plane gets inhibited and finally crystals with {001} exposed facets are formed. In contrast, nP is relatively more polar, and as the polarity of the (100) atomic plane of TiO2 is higher, CH3CH2CHO− preferentially adsorbs on the (100) atomic plane which further induces F− adsorption resulting in the formation of the {100} exposed cube-like structure.
3.7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
The light absorption properties of TZnP and TZiP were analysed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Fig. 7a shows the UV-vis absorbance spectra of the catalysts along with pure TiO2 and ZrO2. The intrinsic absorbance edge was found to be blue shifted by ∼7 nm for TZiP with respect to TZnP which indicates the better light absorption properties of TZiP. Furthermore, the band gaps of the samples were further calculated from the Kubelka–Munk (αhυ)1/2vs. hυ energy plot (Fig. 7b). The corresponding band gaps were deduced to be 3.16 and 3.10 eV for TZnP and TZiP, respectively. These values were found to be slightly higher than that of pure TiO2 (3.06 eV) and much lower than that of pure ZrO2 (4.8 eV). The small increase in band gap is due to the intrinsic presence of Zr4+ within the anatase TiO2 lattice system. However the values obtained for TZnP and TZiP have been found to be much lower than the previous report on the TiO2–ZrO2 composite system.53 This may be due to the lattice defect generated due to lattice incorporation of Zr4+ and/or the synchronous effect of Ti3+ present within the system.20

3.8 Light harvesting properties
Light harvesting properties of TZnP and TZiP have been investigated under simulated sunlight. For this purpose the materials have been used as co-catalyst free photocatalysts in solar water splitting for H2 evolution and DSSC photoanodes.

3.8.1 Solar water splitting for H2 generation. 
Photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiencies of TZnP and TZiP were studied under 1.5G simulated solar light (intensity 60 mW cm−1) without using Pt as the co-catalyst. The amount of H2 estimated from 10 vol% aqueous MeOH solution under solar illumination has been found to be 90 and 356 μmol g−1 for TZnP and TZiP, respectively after 6 h. Fig. 8a shows the H2 evolution rates of 15 and 59 μmol g−1 h−1 for TZnP and TZiP, respectively. Interestingly, the rate for TZiP has been found to be higher than some latest reports on co-catalyst free TiO2 used for solar water splitting.3,32 Nevertheless, a comparative study (Fig. 8a) with control TiO2 samples (TnP and TiP) was also carried out that showed no H2 evolution under similar experimental conditions and it has already been reported that commercially available P25 TiO2 is also unable to produce H2 without Pt. Therefore, the improved photoactivity of TZnP and TZiP even in the absence of the Pt co-catalyst can be due to the following facts. (i) The presence of Zr in the lattice helped in charge separation during photocatalysis.38 (ii) The redox properties of Zr4+ modify the surface chemistry.21 (iii) The replacement of Ti4+ by the larger Zr4+ causes lattice strain.19,35 (iii) In situ generation of a significant amount of Ti3+ helps in electron transfer for superior water splitting.54 (iv) Preferential adsorption of water molecules on the unsaturated five coordinated TiO2 facets ({100} and {001}) due to the surface acidity.6,55 Although both the hybrid samples showed photo-responsive water splitting abilities due to the existence of high energy unsaturated facets, the difference in activity between TZnP and TZiP is expected to be due to the nature of exposed facets present in the respective catalysts. It is known that the Ti and O atoms in {001} facets are unsaturated (Ti5C), whereas {100} facets contain both Ti5C and Ti6C (saturated) atoms in the subsequent layer.56 Moreover, being an oxidative surface, (001) has greater capability to cleave water under light irradiation.46 It has also been reported that anatase TiO2 crystals become more reactive towards solar water splitting when they possess both the {001} and {101} facets because of easy separation of excitons (electrons and holes) on these two facets.5,57 For the above reasons TZiP with {001} exposed facets showed better performance. In addition, the presence of the underlying nanoporous matrix with smaller nanocrystals (Fig. 4g–i) could be another reason for the better photocatalytic activity of TZiP.58

3.8.2 Photoanode in DSSCs. 

I–V characteristics of photoanodes fabricated with TZnP and TZiP are shown in Fig. 8b along with the control samples (TnP and TiP). The corresponding I–V parameters are summarized in Table 1 along with another control sample P25. The calculation procedure for light to power conversion efficiency (% η) is given in the ESI (S1†). Improved open circuit voltage (VOC) values as well as efficiencies were obtained for TZnP and TZiP which can be rationalized by the modified band structure formed after lattice incorporation of Zr in the TiO2 crystal. It is known that the electronegativity of ZrO2 is higher than that of TiO2, thus the presence of Zr in the TiO2 lattice framework would create some surface charge, which helped in the improvement of electron–hole separation resulting in better cell performances.59 Moreover, the surface defects also decelerated the recombination rate of the excitons.38 Additionally, the surface morphology of TZnP and TZiP also played an important role in increasing the light to energy conversion efficiency. The unsaturated Ti5C atoms present on the {001} and {100} facets are believed to adsorb more dye molecules. Accordingly, TZnP and TZiP with {100} and {001} facets are very likely to give better cell performances.5 The better efficiency value of TZiP is due to the synergistic effect arising from the greater availability of Ti5C atoms on {001} facets, and its hierarchical mesoporous hollow architecture that helps in better dye adsorption as well as light scattering within the photoanode.33

4. Conclusions
A new set of Zr modified anatase TiO2 nanocrystals Ti0.665Zr0.335O1.955 (TZnP) and Ti0.912Zr0.088O1.963 (TZiP) have been synthesized by in situ incorporation of Zr4+ in the TiO2 lattice. Within these single crystalline nanostructures high energy {100} and {001} facets are also simultaneously generated. It has been proposed that the polarity of the solvent along with CTAB and NH4F controls the growth of exposed facets during the solvothermal reaction. In addition to that, this novel synthesis route also ensured formation of Ti3+ defect states within the anatase crystals. Due to the presence of such unique features within the same crystal system both TZnP and TZiP showed enhanced photoactivity. Unlike the control TiO2, these Zr-modified photocatalysts have been found to be capable of solar water splitting without any support of a Pt co-catalyst with H2 evolution rates of 15 and 59 μmol g−1 h−1 for TZnP and TZiP, respectively. Furthermore, improvement in light to energy conversion efficiency values was also observed by using them as photoanodes in DSSCs. It has been believed that the synergistic effect of the modified surface chemistry with the Ti3+ chemical state, presence of high energy facets and structural defects created due to the insertion of Zr4+ in the lattice resulted in such interestingly improved photoactivity of the materials. Therefore, we believe that these newly synthesized nanocrystalline Ti0.665Zr0.335O1.955 and Ti0.912Zr0.088O1.963 can be useful as cost-effective light harvesting energy materials for future fuel generation as well as to fabricate solar energy devices.
