    , Accepted 1st September 2018First published on 6th September 2018AbstractThe effect of perovskite film thickness on the current density (J)–voltage (V) hysteresis is investigated with a normal planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) having the FTO/ETL/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au structure (ETL = electron transporting layer, MA = methylammonium, and spiro-MeOTAD = 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene). A compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer is used as an ETL, which is compared with a PCBM ETL and a c-TiO2/PCBM bilayered ETL. The MAPbI3 layer thickness is varied from 100 nm to 800 nm by controlling the precursor solution concentration. The hysteresis increases with perovskite layer thickness for the c-TiO2 layer, while the hysteresis decreases with increasing the perovskite layer thickness in the presence of PCBM. Deep trap states are much more reduced upon inserting PCBM compared with those of the c-TiO2 case, indicative of fewer traps for non-radiative recombination. The ideality factor obtained from the light-dependent open-circuit voltage (Voc) increases for the c-TiO2 layer but decreases for both the c-TiO2/PCBM bilayer and the PCBM layer as the perovskite layer thickness increases, which again supports that the dependence of hysteresis on the perovskite thickness is related to trap states, that is, decreases in deep trap states can reduce hysteresis. From the capacitance–frequency studies, it is found that the low-frequency capacitance correlates with the observed hysteresis, where it increases for the c-TiO2 layer but decreases for the PCBM containing ETLs with perovskite thickness. This work provides important insight into the hysteresis behavior of PSCs, where the hysteresis depends not only on the nature of the ETL but also on the degree of recombination in the bulk perovskite.
Introduction
A paradigm shift in photovoltaics was realized by a breakthrough of a solid-state perovskite solar cell (PSC) reported in 2012 with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% and 500 h-stability,1 following two important seed research studies on perovskite-sensitized liquid junction solar cells showing PCEs of 3.8% in 2009 (ref. 2) and 6.5% in 2011.3 Since cost-effective and facile fabrication processes can lead to high PCE, PSCs have received great attention. As a result, recent cutting-edge technology yields a certified PCE of 22.7%.4 So far, the best performing PSCs have been based on a normal structure (TCO/ETL/perovskite/HTL/metal) but an inverted structure (TCO/HTL/perovskite/ETL/metal) was also found to work efficiently, where the TCO, ETL and HTL stand for the transparent conductive oxide, electron transport layer and hole transport layer, respectively. Although PSCs have demonstrated high photovoltaic performance and have been confirmed to be better than conventional inorganic thin film solar cells, there are still some issues to be solved. The current density (J)–voltage (V) hysteresis, produced by mismatching of J–V curves between forward and reverse scan directions, is one of the critical issues in PSCs. Many efforts have been made to understand the origin of the hysteresis and to remove the hysteresis. Capacitive current, associated with the capacitor in p–n (or p–i–n) diodes, charge traps, ion migration and ferroelectric polarization have been proposed as origins of the hysteresis.5–7 Among them, interface polarization causing capacitive current is one of the major concerns in terms of hysteresis, which indicates that the hysteresis is expected to be sensitive to heterojunction interfaces of ETL/perovskite and/or perovskite/HTL. Attempts were made to modify the ETL/perovskite interface to solve the hysteresis problem.8–19 The mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) film is conventionally used as the ETL, which however often leads to severe hysteresis. A SnO2 nanoparticle-modified TiO2 film was found to reduce the hysteresis due to its rapid electron extraction and decreased trap states at the interface.8,9 A self-assembled monolayer of fullerene (C60-SAM) was formed on a compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) thin film in a normal planar PSC, which could passivate the trap states of TiO2 and thereby lead to a decrease in hysteresis.10 In addition, there are lots of materials for modifying the interface such as YCl3,11 CsBr,12 sodium13 and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).16–19 Among them, PCBM is considered as one of the promising candidates due to its fast charge extraction characteristics, hydrophobicity and efficient passivation of traps at interfaces16,20–23 or grain boundaries.24–26 The large hysteresis of the planar structure employing c-TiO2 and the FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 (FA = formamidinium) perovskite was significantly reduced by inserting the PCBM layer in between c-TiO2 and the perovskite.16 Insertion of PCBM accelerated charge extraction and thereby reduced charge accumulation, which might explain the reduced hysteresis.21 Recently, fullerene and its derivatives such as PCBM have received more intense attention because they are suitable for PSCs.27 The thickness of the perovskite layer (sometimes the capping layer in a normal structure with a m-TiO2 layer) can affect the photovoltaic performance, where the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) is low from a thin layer but charge extraction and recombination may be issued in a thick layer.28–30 In addition, it was found that the hysteresis decreased as the perovskite capping layer thickness was increased from 40 nm to 480 nm in a normal structure with a m-TiO2 layer,31 where the reduced hysteresis with thickness was explained by the increased grain size. Although advances have been made to better understand and reduce the hysteresis, the effect of perovskite layer thickness on the J–V hysteresis has not been studied to the best of our knowledge.
We report here the dependence of hysteresis on the perovskite layer thickness in a normal planar structure based on c-TiO2 and PCBM as ETLs. Three different ETLs of c-TiO2, c-TiO2/PCBM bilayer and PCBM are prepared to study the role of the ETL on the thickness-dependent hysteresis. The perovskite layer thickness is increased up to 800 nm. We have found that the hysteresis is pronounced as the perovskite layer thickness increases in the case of c-TiO2; however, the hysteresis is abnormally reduced with thickness in the cases of both PCBM only and the c-TiO2/PCBM bilayer. Trap density of states and the ideality factor are evaluated from impedance spectroscopy and light intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage measurements, respectively, to explain the abnormal hysteresis in the presence of PCBM.
Experimental
Solar cell fabrication
FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) glasses (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) were cleaned with detergent and sonicated with ethanol for 15 min prior to coating with ETLs. For the c-TiO2 ETL, a precursor solution of 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in 2-propanol, Aldrich) in 1-butanol (99.8%, Aldrich) was spin-coated at 700 rpm for 8 s, 1000 rpm for 10 s, and 2000 rpm for 40 s with an acceleration of 1200 rpm s−1 to reach the speed set point, followed by annealing at 125 °C for 10 min. This coating process was repeated three times. Finally, the film was annealed at 550 °C for 60 min in air. The annealed c-TiO2 film was immersed in 10 mM aqueous TiCl4 (Sigma Aldrich, >98%) at 70 °C for 20 min, rinsed with deionized water several times and then annealed again at 500 °C for 60 min in air. For the PCBM overlayer on c-TiO2 or the PCBM layer as an ETL, a PCBM solution (20 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 1200 rpm for 60 s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm s−1 and then dried at room temperature for 20 min. In order to control the MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium) perovskite film thickness, concentrations of the perovskite precursor solution were changed. The stock solution with a concentration of 2.71 M was prepared by dissolving CH3NH3I (0.159 g), PbI2 (0.461 g) and DMSO (71 μl) in 0.369 ml of DMF, which was diluted to 2.37 M, 1.58 M and 0.95 M to decrease the perovskite film thickness. The precursor solution was filtered with a 0.45 μm pore-sized filter, and was spin-coated on the ETL-coated substrate at 5000 rpm for 25 s with an acceleration of 1200 rpm s−1. While spinning, 0.8 ml of diethyl ether was added dropwise at 10 s or 7 s after spinning for high concentration or low concentration perovskite precursor solutions, respectively. The perovskite film was heated at 65 °C for 1 min and then at 100 °C for 9 min. For deposition of the spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) layer, a coating solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD, 17.5 μl of Li-TFSI (520 mg ml−1 in acetonitrile) and 28.8 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in 1 ml chlorobenzene, and was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 25 s. Finally, a Au electrode was deposited using a thermal evaporator.
Characterization
Photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) curves were measured with a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, class AAA) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was adjusted using a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The active area was covered with a metal mask with a dimension of 0.125 cm2 during the measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an EQE system (PV measurement Inc.), where a monochromatic beam was generated from a 75 W xenon source lamp (USHIO, Japan) and data were collected in DC mode without bias light. The thickness of the perovskite layer was determined by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM7000F, JEOL). Impedance spectroscopy (IS) and admittance spectroscopy (AS) were performed with a PGSTAT 128N (Autolab, Eco-Chemie). IS was performed under illumination of 80 mW cm−2 and in the dark at DC bias voltages ranging from 0 V to 1.0 V and a potential step of 0.1 V. The frequency range was between 1 MHz and 100 mHz. AS was performed under darkness and an AC sinusoidal signal of 20 mV was applied in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 mHz under open circuit conditions. Capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves were measured from a 1.5 V positive potential, where built-in potential was calculated at 2 kHz in the central plateau region.32
Results and discussion
The architectures of three types of perovskite solar cells are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The most common planar structure is composed of FTO/c-TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au (Fig. 1(a)). Alternatively, TiO2 can be replaced with PCBM because of its electron accepting properties. Since the hysteresis was found to be significantly reduced by inserting PCBM in between TiO2 and the perovskite,21 we also introduced a PCBM interlayer between c-TiO2 and MAPbI3 (Fig. 1(b)) to investigate the dependence of hysteresis on the perovskite film thickness. In addition, a planar structure with only a PCBM layer as the ETL (Fig. 1(c)) is prepared to understand the role of the PCBM interlayer.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the planar device structure with (a) a c-TiO2 layer, (b) a PCBM interlayer between c-TiO2 and MAPbI3 and (c) only a PCBM layer. MAPbI3 layer thickness was varied in each structure. 

Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the full PSC devices with different ETLs, c-TiO2, c-TiO2/PCBM and PCBM. Regardless of the ETL, the MAPbI3 film thickness increases with increasing the precursor coating solution from 0.95 M to 2.71 M without changing spin-coating conditions. The MAPbI3 layer thickness for the c-TiO2 ETL increases from 100 nm to 250 nm, 500 nm and 700 nm as the precursor solution concentration increases from 0.95 M to 1.58 M, 2.37 M and 2.71 M, respectively (Fig. 2(a–d)). On the other hand, the perovskite film becomes 50–100 nm thicker even at the same concentration when depositing the perovskite on the PCBM layer due to the difference in wettability owing to more polar characteristic TiO2versus the less polar PCBM surface.33 The MAPbI3 film thickness is determined to be 150 nm, 300 nm, 600 nm and 800 nm for both the c-TiO2/PCBM bilayer (Fig. 2(e–h)) and the PCBM layer (Fig. 2(i–l)). This indicates that the substrate plays an essential role in forming the perovskite film and determining its thickness.34

Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves and statistical photovoltaic parameters depending on the perovskite layer thickness in PSCs based on the c-TiO2 layer. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The average short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) increases from 14.35 mA cm−2 to 21.36 mA cm−2 as the perovskite layer thickness increases from 100 nm to 700 nm due to enhanced light harvesting efficiency.35 FF tends to decrease with increasing thickness probably due to increased resistance. It is obvious that the J–V hysteresis due to mismatching Jsc between reverse and forward scans is significantly pronounced upon increasing the perovskite layer thickness. The hysteresis index (HI) can be estimated by the relation of HI = [JRS(0.8Voc) − JFS(0.8Voc)]/JRS(0.8Voc),36 where JRS(0.8Voc) and JFS(0.8Voc) denote photocurrent densities measured from the reverse scan and forward scan at V = 0.8 V, respectively. The HI is calculated to be 0.09, 0.45, 0.79 and 0.57 for 100, 250, 500 and 700 nm, respectively. Since a kink structure, associated with ion migration,37,38 appears at around 0.8 V in the forward scan J–V curves for 250 nm and 700 nm, the equation may not give rise to a precise HI. Alternatively, we try to evaluate the HI from the difference in area (A = ∑J × V), that is, HI = (ARS − AFS)/ARS. From this relation, the HI is estimated to be 0.11, 0.34, 0.44 and 0.30, which indicates that the degree of hysteresis increases as the perovskite layer thickness increases up to 500 nm and then seems to be saturated.

The J–V curves and statistical photovoltaic parameters of the c-TiO2/PCBM based PSCs are depicted in Fig. 4 and Table 2. Jsc increases with increasing the perovskite layer thickness, which is the same tendency observed for the c-TiO2 based PSCs. A slightly lower Jsc compared to those for the c-TiO2 based PSCs is probably due to absorption by the PCBM layer at wavelengths around 300–400 nm. It is noted that the hysteresis tends to decrease with MAPbI3 layer thickness, which is contrary to the tendency observed from the c-TiO2 based PSCs in Fig. 3. The HI is calculated from the J–V area difference, as mentioned previously, to be 0.30, 0.29, 0.13 and −0.01 for 150, 300, 600 and 800 nm, respectively. It is also noted that FF tends to slightly increase with thickness (Fig. 4(g)), which is contrary to the tendency observed in the c-TiO2 based PSCs. This indicates that the presence of PCBM can effectively diminish the resistance component in the normal planar structure.

In order to investigate the effect of PCBM on the thickness-dependent hysteresis, a MAPbI3 film is formed on a PCBM layer without c-TiO2. Fig. 5 and Table 3 show the J–V curves and statistical photovoltaic parameters of the PCBM based PSCs. As the thickness of the perovskite layer increases, the hysteresis apparently decreases as can be seen in Fig. 5(a–d). Jsc increases with increasing the perovskite layer thickness, which is almost consistent with the c-TiO2/PCBM case, except for higher Jsc values for 600 and 800 nm. The HI is estimated to be 0.40, 0.27, 0.10 and 0.08 for 150, 300, 600 and 800 nm, respectively. Thus the clear contrast in the thickness-dependent hysteresis before and after the insertion of PCBM between c-TiO2 and the perovskite is closely related to the presence of PCBM.

Since the hysteresis is related to trap density,39,40 the trap density of states (NT) is estimated from the angular frequency dependent capacitance according to eqn (1) and (2),41–44 (1) (2)where Vbi, W, C, w, and w0 represent the built-in potential, the space charge width, the capacitance, the angular frequency and the attempt-to-escape frequency, respectively. q, kB and T stand for the elementary charge, the Boltzmann constant and the temperature, respectively. In Fig. 6, NT is plotted with respect to Ew for the c-TiO2 layer, the c-TiO2/PCBM bilayer and the PCBM layer. It was reported that a large trap density of states is related to large hysteresis.41 Relatively large NT values ranging between 1017 and 1019 cm−3 are observed for the thin (100 nm) or thick (150 nm)-MAPbI3 layers regardless of the absence and presence of PCBM. The shallow trap state below the energy level of 0.4 eV is related to traps at the grain boundary and the deep trap state above 0.4 eV is associated with defects at the film surface.45,46 Shallow and deep trap states decrease with increasing the perovskite film thickness again regardless of the absence and presence of PCBM. When taking a closer look at Fig. 6, the shallow trap states of all architectures decrease as the perovskite layer thickness increases, which indicates that traps at the grain boundary decrease with thickness. Since the grain size of the perovskite also increases when the film thickness increases as shown in SEM images in Fig. 2 (also see Fig. 7), the trap density of states at the grain boundary is expected to be reduced. In addition, the trap state will be similarly reduced before and after the introduction of PCBM because PCBM is not post-treated after forming the perovskite layer. Although the deep trap state shows a similar tendency, the decreasing rate is more pronounced for the PCBM-containing devices. Furthermore, the trap density of states hardly increases above 0.55 eV for the PCBM-based device, while it does increase with the energy demarcation Ew for the c-TiO2 case. The decrease in the deep trap density by adding PCBM on a TiO2 layer implies that deep trap levels formed at the perovskite/c-TiO2 interface are reduced because PCBM could passivate the traps.47 Therefore, more than one order of magnitude lowered NT and almost constant NT at Ew > 0.55 eV seem to be related to the reduced hysteresis with thickness for the PCBM containing PSCs.

It is necessary to double-check the effect of film thickness on the grain size of the perovskite since the hysteresis was reported to be affected by the grain size of the perovskite.36Fig. 7 shows the plane-view SEM images of MAPbI3 depending on different thicknesses. As the perovskite film thickness increases from ∼300 nm to ∼800 nm, the grain size increases from ∼100 nm to ∼400 nm regardless of the kind of ETL layer. Since the dependence of the J–V hysteresis on the film thickness in PCBM-based perovskite solar cells is completely opposite to that in TiO2-based ones in spite of the increased grain size, the hysteresis behavior observed in this work suggests that the interface is obviously more critical in influencing the hysteresis than the grain size of the perovskite.
The ideality factor (nID) is estimated from the light intensity dependent Voc to understand the recombination–hysteresis correlation. Fig. 8(a–c) show Voc as a function of light intensity for the c-TiO2 layer, the c-TiO2/PCBM bilayer and the PCBM layer. In the case of the c-TiO2 based device, the slope tends to increase as the thickness increases, whereas the slope decreases as the thickness increases when PCBM is present. The slope is related to nID that is determined from eqn (3),48 (3)where T is the temperature (300 K), e is the electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 C) and kB is the Boltzmann constant (8.62 × 10−5 eV K−1). I is the light intensity and I0 is the constant with the same unit as I. The Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination and multiple trapping (trap distribution) can lead to 1 < nID < 2 and nID > 2, respectively.48–50 In Fig. 8(d), nID is plotted with respect to the MAPbI3 film thickness. For the c-TiO2 layer, nID increases from 1.7 to 2.6 as the perovskite film thickness increases from 100 nm to 700 nm, which indicates that trap-related recombination increases with thickness. On the other hand, insertion of PCBM decreases nID from 2.3 to 1.1 as the perovskite layer thickness increases from 150 nm to 800 nm. This is indicative of reduction in recombination and well consistent with the reduced hysteresis with thickness. For the PCBM only, a similar tendency is observed and can also explain the tendency of the thickness-dependent hysteresis.

The capacitance–frequency (C–f) curves, extracted from the impedance data, shown in Fig. 9 can provide information on the capacitance–hysteresis correlation. The high-frequency capacitance (Chf) at frequencies above ∼103 Hz is correlated with the dielectric response of the bulk perovskite and the low-frequency capacitance (Clf) at around 10−1 Hz is related to the J–V hysteresis.51–53 It was reported that the hysteresis-less device showed a characteristic feature of relatively small Clf in the C–f curve compared to a large Clf for the hysteresis device.36 For the c-TiO2 layer in Fig. 9(a), Clf increases with increasing the perovskite layer thickness, which is well consistent with the evolution of hysteresis with thickness. Regarding Chf, it was reported that Chf is hardly dependent on film thickness and light intensity in a normal planar structure with MAPbI3.51 However a slight decrease in Chf with thickness is observed at the same time when Clf increases, which is also consistent with a previous report.36 The decrease in Chf with thickness can be easily expected because capacitance is inversely proportional to the thickness of the plate capacitor. Therefore a relatively large increase in Clf along with a small decrease in Chf with perovskite layer thickness is considered to be characteristic of a c-TiO2-based normal planar PSC, which is responsible for the thickness-dependent hysteresis of the c-TiO2 layer. It is noted that both Clf and Chf decrease with perovskite layer thickness for both the c-TiO2/PCBM layer (Fig. 9(b)) and the PCBM layer (Fig. 9(c)). A decrease in Clf with thickness is well consistent with the reduced hysteresis as the perovskite layer thickness increases. It is obvious that lowering capacitances at low frequency is essential to reduce the hysteresis, which implies that the ETL material is critical in reducing the hysteresis.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in Fig. 10 shows that charge collection of photo-generated electrons, especially under red light, becomes less effective as the perovskite thickness increases for the c-TiO2 layer (Fig. 10(a)). On the other hand, charge collection becomes better with increasing perovskite layer thickness in the entire wavelength range for the c-TiO2/PCBM bilayer (Fig. 10(b)) and the PCBM layer (Fig. 10(c)), where the increasing rate of EQE is more pronounced under red light (600–800 nm). The thickness-dependent EQE results indicate that photo-generated electrons tend to be more (for the c-TiO2 layer) or less (for the PCBM containing ETLs) accumulated at the ETL/perovskite interface with perovskite thickness, which is consistent with the tendency of hysteresis. Charge accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite interface in a normal PSC has been known to lead to hysteresis, which is due to ion migration as one of the origins. Thus, for the case of c-TiO2, charge accumulation is expected to be increased with film thickness, leading to poor charge collection especially under red light (600–800 nm). However, charge collection is expected to be increased with film thickness in the presence of PCBM because charge accumulation is suppressed at the PCBM interface,54,55 which leads to an increase in EQE especially in the wavelength range from 600 nm to 800 nm. When considering that the perovskite composition is unchanged and thus the electron diffusion length will be identical regardless of the absence and presence of PCBM, interfacial charge accumulation plays a more critical role in hysteresis than charge transport in the bulk perovskite. Impedance and EQE results combined with changes in trap density of states and the ideality factor indicate that both the interfacial charge accumulation and the degree of recombination in the bulk perovskite have an influence on the hysteresis.

Conclusions
We have systematically investigated the dependence of hysteresis on the perovskite film thickness in a normal planar structure. For the c-TiO2 ETL layer, the degree of hysteresis was pronounced as the perovskite film thickness increased. The ideality factor and low-frequency capacitance increased with thickness. On the other hand, for PCBM used as an ETL or an interlayer between c-TiO2 and the perovskite, the hysteresis was reduced as the perovskite thickness increased. The ideality factor and low-frequency capacitance decreased with thickness. The results of frequency-dependent capacitance, changes in trap density of states and the ideality factor indicate that both the interfacial charge accumulation and the degree of recombination in the bulk perovskite (mostly near the ETL) have an influence on the hysteresis.
