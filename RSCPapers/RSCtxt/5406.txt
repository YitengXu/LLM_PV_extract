    , Accepted 11th October 2022First published on 11th October 2022AbstractA revolutionary invention in the form of a hydroelectric cell (HEC) has opened a new arena in green energy production through water dissociation on the surface of defective metal oxides. In the present study, we have synthesized magnesium (Mg)-doped hematite (α-Fe2O3) via solid state reaction route and studied the structural, electrical, and electrochemical properties. The X-ray diffraction study validates the pure phase formation of the pristine and Mg-doped ‘α-Fe2O3’. The fabricated HEC generates a short circuit current of ∼40 mA and off-load power output of 36 mW. Further, the bulk resistance of the Mg-doped sample is lower (11.4 Ω) as compared to that of the pristine sample (37.41 Ω), which indicates that Mg doping improves the conductivity. The fabricated HEC is a promising device for producing green energy and opens new avenues for alternative sources of green energy.
1. Introduction
Presently, the degradation of energy resources is a great challenge and demands for alternate technologies to improve efficiency and make green energy sources a more viable alternative is growing. The Li-ion batteries, solar cells, lead-acid batteries, and many other such types of conventional energy sources have associated drawbacks, viz. functioning risks, disposal in the environment, and deterioration problems.1,2 Moving to green energy, i.e. renewable energy, is ample and sources such as sun, wind, and water are present everywhere at no cost. The shift to renewable energy is beneficial for the community and environment, and it is presently the only way to save us from the hazards of fossils fuels. Scientists have devoted decades to making the technology more sustainable and cost-effective and optimizing its eco-friendliness. Continuous efforts have also been made to improve the photo-conversion efficiency in photochemical cells and marginal success has been realized in this direction.3,4 Hydroelectric cells (HECs) play a vital role in the field of production of green energy by splitting water molecules without the use of any external energy sources, such as solar, electrolyte, and acid.5–7 The recently discovered HEC has fascinating applications with the dissociation of water molecules at nanopores, oxygen vacancies, and unsaturated surface cations, and other types of defects on metal oxide surfaces for electricity production8. Metal-oxides have fascinating chemical and physical properties, which make them useful in the production of a new class of hydroelectric cells for green energy generation. Oxygen vacancies are one of the most common defects, which can be observed on the surface of oxide materials by enhanced surface reactivity. It has been reported by many researchers that water molecule dissociation is a surface phenomenon, which takes place at defect positions or oxygen vacancies.9,10 The unsaturated cations and oxygen vacancies on the oxide's surface attract the water molecules, and chemidissociation takes place. These chemidissociated ions not only form a layer of hydroxyl ions on the oxide surface but also induce a high surface charge, which further physisorbs the approaching water molecules. These physisorbed layers help the proton hop from one position to another. Because of this hopping some of the protons get trapped inside the nanopores and generate a charge potential, which is sufficient to further dissociate the water molecules. ‘α-Fe2O3’ is one of the most encouraging materials among all the transition metal-oxides due to its easy availability, cost, and non-polluting behavior. The ferrite surfaces have already been reported in the literature for their water adsorption and dissociation properties. Hematite has a very good thermal stability in comparison to other polymorphs abundantly available in nature. This has made hematite the most preferred material for researchers in a variety of applications, including environmental processes, industrial applications, biomedicine, and waste-water treatment.11,12 The crystal structure of hematite is like that for corundum in which Fe3+ ions are in an octahedral coordination, while oxygen ions are hexagonally packed. The surface property of hematite is strongly influenced by its contact with water droplets. This interaction of the water molecule with the surface is highly dependent on the surface configuration as well as coordination number of the Fe3+ ion.13,14 Moreover, water dissociative adsorption is noticeable where surface defects are present along with iron and oxygen ions.
The motive of this study is to systematically investigate the water dissociation capability and transportation of ions because of surface defects in pure and doped hematite cells. In this work, the effects of magnesium doping in hematite have been analyzed and the results are encouraging. The doping of magnesium in hematite created more defects than the prevalent known methods, and was found to be responsible for extreme water dissociation, leading to more current generation as compared to the pristine hematite-based hydroelectric cell. Furthermore, it was observed that the off-load output power for the Mg-doped hematite HEC is 36 mW, which is much higher as compared to 22 mW power for the pristine hematite cell. The results of this study are relatively encouraging, and lead us to a new path for producing green energy without liberating any toxic byproducts or harmful footprint on the environment.
2. Experimental parts
2.1. Materials
Ferric oxide red (Fe2O3, 97%), magnesium carbonate (MgCO3, 99%), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), potassium hydroxide pellets (KOH, 85%), and deionized water were used as the starting materials.
2.2. Synthesis of magnesium-doped α-Fe2O3
The pristine and Mg-doped samples were prepared using the solid state reaction route. The α-Fe2O3 precursor was mixed directly with 0.1 mol% of MgCO3 in a proper stoichiometric molar ratio. The blended powder was ground using a pestle mortar for about 4 to 5 h in air. The ground powder was placed in a muffle furnace at 800 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 for 8 h. This pre-sintered powder was again ground for one hour to obtain the final homogeneous product.
2.3. Fabrication of the hydroelectric cell
The obtained powders were pressed into a pellet form with an area of 4 cm2. These pellets were then sintered at 900 °C for 2 h before fabricating the hydroelectric cell. Finally, the upper face of the pellet was pasted with silver in a comb pattern (thickness of 0.1 μm), which was then used as the inert cathode. A 0.1 mm thick sheet of zinc was then used as the anode, which was pasted on the back side. The electrical contacts were made to complete the cell. Fig. 1 displays the four fabricated hydroelectric cells connected in series to light up a LED.

2.4. Characterization techniques
The crystallinity and phase of the Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 powder were analyzed through X-ray diffraction by a Bruker D8 ADVANCE ECO P-XRD system having CuKα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation with a scan speed of 20° min−1 and 0.02° step size, while the surface morphological analysis and elemental composition determination were completed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). To identify the particle size, field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM, JEOL) was used. FTIR spectra were obtained using an Alfa Bruker Spectrometer. The electrochemical performance of both pristine and Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 samples was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) through a Biologic Science Instrument, which had three-electrode setups. This biologic science instrument was also used to obtain the Nyquist plot of the pristine and Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 HECs in wet states to conduct the impedance study. The current and voltage characteristics of both cells were performed using a Keithley 2400 source meter.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. X-ray diffraction
The components and crystalline phase of the as-prepared pristine and Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 samples were investigated by XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 2(a and b). The obtained diffraction patterns were found to be in good agreement with JCPDS file no. 33-0664 for the rhombohedral phase of α-Fe2O3.15,16 No distinctive peaks of additional contaminants were identified in the XRD pattern. The 2θ values for the distinctive peaks in Fig. 3(a) were found at 24.33°, 33.37°, 35.84°, 41.06°, 49.71°, 54.32°, and 57.80°, corresponding to the (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), and (018) planes. Furthermore, it was observed that the substitution of the larger Mg2+ (72 pm) ion at the site of the octahedral coordinated Fe3+ (60 pm) ion created strain within the lattice. This changed the lattice parameter, as reflected by the shifting in the diffraction peaks towards the lower angle side, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Broadening of the XRD peaks and a reduction in the intensity of the diffraction peaks were observed in the magnesium-doped α-Fe2O3 sample, which indicate the increased structural disorder and decreased crystallite size.

3.2. FESEM analysis

Fig. 3(a and b) delineates the FESEM images of the surface morphology of the pristine and Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 samples. It can be seen that the pristine and Mg-doped samples have a nanorod-like structure. The pristine hematite nanorods have the average length of ∼450 nm and average diameter of ∼60 nm, which are in line with previous reports.17 In Fig. 3(b), the average length of the Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 is decreased to ∼340 nm. Furthermore, the average diameter is around ∼100 nm, which indicates that an appropriate amount of Mg doping affects the growth of nanorods. The doping effect on the surface of the sample is clearly visible. It can be seen that Mg is uniformly distributed in α-Fe2O3 and no large aggregates could be found, which indicates that Mg was successfully doped into the pristine α-Fe2O3 nanorods. Furthermore, doping of Mg ions at the Fe site significantly enhanced the oxygen vacancies, which directly escalated the diffusion of ions within the lattice to sustain the charge neutrality and defect symmetry.18,19 The improved performance of the Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 in comparison with that of pristine α-Fe2O3 could be ascribed to the synergetic effect of the Mg doping and oxygen vacancies.20–22 Energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) was performed for the doped sample, as displayed in Fig. 4. The elemental mapping confirms the homogeneous distribution of the Fe, O, and Mg elements within the sample without any other impurity.

3.4. TEM analysis

Fig. 5(a–e) delineates the TEM images of the Mg-doped hematite sample. The TEM micrographs in Fig. 5(a and b) reveal the disoriented irregular nanorod-like structure with variable sizes. The average lengths of the nanorods have been calculated using the histogram, which was obtained from the TEM image, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The average length was calculated to be around ∼350 nm and the average diameter was around ∼110 nm, which is very close to the values calculated using the FESEM image. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 5(c)) indicate the polycrystalline nature of the material, while the high-resolution image (inset of Fig. 5(d)) shows the crystallographic planes in different directions. The defects are presented in the form of fault zones, vacancy defects, and misfit dislocations, which are marked by yellow arrows, while the lattice fringes containing unequal d spacing are highlighted by the red encircled region.23,24 It was also observed that the lattice fringes of the polycrystalline surface have an interplanar spacing of around 0.30 nm corresponding to the (110) plane (Fig. 5e), which is much higher than the interplanar spacing of the (110) plane of the pristine hematite.25

3.5. FTIR analysis
The FTIR spectra of the prepared samples, performed at room temperature, are shown in Fig. 6. The broad band peaks observed in the range of 3100–3450 cm−1 are due to the hydration of water, whereas the low wavenumber bands around 1522 cm−1, 1645 cm−1, and 2343 cm−1 are associated with the bending and stretching vibrations of the H–O–H and O–H bonds, respectively.26,27 The bands observed in the 800–1300 cm−1 range can be assigned to the Fe–OH vibrational mode, while the bands found in the 400–750 cm−1 range are due to the stretching vibrations of the Fe–O deformation of α-Fe2O3 at the tetrahedral and octahedral positions.28–30

3.6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis
The charge transport mechanism within the hydroelectric cells has been observed by the Nyquist impedance response of the fabricated HECs.31,32 The Nyquist plots of wet α-Fe2O3 and Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 HECs are presented in Fig. 7. The Nyquist curve provides a clear insight into the migration of ions within the hydroelectric cell due to the dissociation of water molecules on the defect sites.33 It can be seen that the bulk resistance for the α-Fe2O3-based HEC was found to be around ∼37.41 Ω, which dropped to ∼11.4 Ω after the addition of Mg in the hematite-based HEC. The hydronium ions transfer towards the respective electrodes via hopping mechanism. Furthermore, the hydroxide ions move via defects, which decreased the internal resistance of the cell. A highly reduced internal resistance was observed for the Mg-doped hematite cell due to the high concentration of defects, which provided a conduction path for the dissociated ions. This smaller bulk resistance in the Mg-doped hematite cell, as shown in the Nyquist plot, reflects the rapid movement of the dissociated ions within the material, which has been confirmed from the higher value of the current in the I–V curves.7 The resistance parameter is calculated using the semicircle fitting of the acquired Nyquist data for both HECs in wet condition. The slopping backend at the lower frequency side refers to the ion diffusion at the electrode's interface.

3.7. Cyclic voltammetry
To determine the electrochemical behavior of the pure and Mg doped hematite samples at room temperature, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used. It is very useful for obtaining information about the electrochemical reactions that occur on the surface of the electrodes. In this study, pure and Mg-doped hematite materials were used as the working electrodes, with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and platinum as the counter electrode. The complete experiment was performed in 1 M KOH electrolytic solution. The potential scan range for both samples was set from 0 to 0.6 V with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1, as depicted in Fig. 8. The shape of the CV curve indicates the pseudocapacitive nature of the synthesized material. The as-obtained peaks are the result of faradaic redox reactions at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte.34 The anodic peak current and cathodic peak current for α-Fe2O3 were observed as 6.15 mA and 3.99 mA, respectively, whereas the anodic peak potential and cathodic peak potential values were found to be around 0.395 V and 0.324 V, respectively. Likewise, the C–V analysis of the Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 displayed the peak anodic current at around 17.25 mA and peak cathodic current at nearly 12.41 mA. The anodic peak potential and cathodic peak potential for the Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 electrode was observed at 0.40 V and 0.26 V, respectively. The doping of magnesium enhances the redox reaction, which results in peak shifting and a larger area under the curve in comparison to the pristine sample.35 Moreover, the doping of Mg in α-Fe2O3 improved the current value by creating more Fe2+/Fe3+ ions, which can be validated by the CV results.

3.8. Water splitting mechanism of α-Fe2O3 and Mg-doped α-Fe2O3-based HECs
The water splitting mechanism includes the chemidissociation of water molecules on the surface of α-Fe2O3, followed by physidissociation at the nanopores. This process mainly takes place due to the Coulombic force of attraction between the unsaturated Fe2+/Fe3+ surface cations and the lone pair of electrons in the water molecule. The reason behind this heterolytic splitting is the strong bonding of the extremely electronegative Fe2+/Fe3+ ions with the electron lone pair of oxygen in H2O.36 After the splitting, Fe–OH bonds are formed, which further helps the H+ ions bond with other oxygen atoms on the surface to create a layer of OH− groups.36,37 The unsaturated/daggling bonds are the electrons trapped inside the oxygen vacancies. These unsaturated/daggling bonds attract the surface cations and polar water molecules on the surface, and withdraw the OH− ions from these water molecules. Subsequently, the water molecules chemidissociate into H+ and OH− ions.5 The OH− ions migrate through the oxygen vacancies, whereas the H+ ions hop from the physisorbed layer of water molecules on the surface. These H+ ions also get trapped inside the nanopores and produce a huge electrostatic field inside the nanopores. This potential is strong enough to further dissociate the physisorbed water molecules into OH− and H+ ions. This chain reaction, which continuously occurs, is also known as the Grotthus chain reaction.38–40 These dissociated ions are further collected by two different electrodes, and produce the voltage and current inside the hydroelectric cell.
In this hydroelectric cell, Zn behaves as an anode and Ag as an inert cathode. The hydroxide ions migrate toward the zinc anode, while the hydronium ions move toward the inert cathode via capillary and surface diffusion. At the zinc anode, oxidation of Zn takes place and produces Zn (OH)2, whereas Ag reduces the H+ ions by taking the electrons released from the Zn anode and generates hydrogen gas. Thus, the voltage and current are produced from the cell.
On the surface, the reaction taking place is explained as follows:
On the surface of the defective nanoporous hematite material: 4H2O → 2H3O+ + 2OH−(1)At the anode: Zn + 2OH− → Zn (OH)2 + 2e− Eoxd = −0.76 V(2)At the cathode: 2H3O+ + 2e− → H2(g) + 2H2O Ered = +0.22V(3)
In the Mg-doped hematite-based HEC, MgFe2O4 is formed by the counter-diffusion of Mg2+ and Fe2+ through a relatively rigid oxygen lattice. There may be partial conversion towards spinel ferrite since the sintering time is not prolonged. Because the Fe2+ ions diffuse very fast, the final sintered material becomes a microstructure with a lot of pores resulting from the high driving force for sintering and fast grain growth.41 As a result of this, oxygen vacancies and defects are created, which help to improve the water dissociation capability and further results in a higher current value.
3.9. Performance of pure and Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 based HECs
As illustrated in Fig. 9(a–d), the performance of the Mg-doped hematite-based hydroelectric cells was assessed using voltage–current polarization (V–I) plots. With distinct working regions of HEC, the voltage drop across the external variable load is given as a function of the current. The short circuit current (Isc) and open-cell voltage Voc of the pure hematite-based HEC showed 24.3 mA current and 0.91 V, which is in line with the reported results. The Mg-doped hematite nanocomposite cells showed 40 mA current and 0.90 V open cell voltage, as shown in Table 1. The comparison of the current and voltage by the different hydroelectric cells is presented in Table 2.

The V–I curves are divided into three portions, AB, BC, and CD (as shown in Fig. 7)), which explain the different types of polarization losses used to characterize the cell's operational zone. In the low current density region, the AB curve denotes the activation loss. The activation loss is the minimum voltage required to initiate an electrochemical reaction between the surface of the active material and their corresponding electrodes.5 The activation loss is found to be less for the Mg-doped hematite HEC in comparison with α-Fe2O3 HEC, as seen in Fig. 9(a). This is because of the high defect density, which provides a fast dissociation of water molecules in the Mg-doped hematite-based HEC. The intermediate region (BC) delineates the voltage drop because of ohmic losses within the cell. This region is responsible for producing the internal resistance by the ion and the electron flow through the porous network of the Mg-doped hematite. For the HEC operation, the large ohmic region is very useful because it results in a low internal resistance within the cell, and further enhances ion migration via hopping mechanism. The segment CD towards the high current density region gives the information about the sharp drop in voltage. This abrupt decline in voltage is because of the highly reactive electrodes, which do not acquire sufficient ions to react. This phenomenon is also known as mass transport loss or concentration loss.5,45 The water droplet dissociates into OH− and H+ ions on the surface of the hydroelectric cell. The active linear region and high current value obtained for the Mg-doped hematite HEC is beneficial for the facile, portable, and low-cost electricity generation by dissociation of the water molecule. In the present study, the cells' maximum powers were calculated to be 22 mW and 36 mW for the pristine and doped hematite based HECs, respectively. The maximum current of 40 mA obtained for a Mg-doped hematite HEC cell with an area of 4.0 cm2 is higher among most of the reported HECs, as shown in Table 2. The addition of magnesium to α-Fe2O3 enhances the current magnitude from 24.3 mA for α-Fe2O3 to 40 mA for Fe1.9Mg0.1O3. The improved oxygen vacancies increase the water dissociation process, resulting in an increase in current. The barrier to OH− diffusion via grain boundaries is reduced, resulting in a lower ohmic loss. The current HEC's potential is higher than those previously reported for most of the HEC cells, indicating that the redox reaction and the water dissociation rates are balanced.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the pristine and Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 have been synthesized via solid state reaction route. The XRD pattern confirms the pure phase formation of the pristine and Mg-doped α-Fe2O3 samples without any impurity. The increased redox reaction is confirmed by cyclic voltammetry measurements performed on the Mg-doped hematite material. Furthermore, the Nyquist plot depicts the ionic conduction within the HEC, and confirmed that the impedance of the Mg-doped hematite cell decreased by a considerable amount. The fabricated Mg-doped hematite-based HEC with an area of 4 cm2 shows an offload output power of 36 mW, which is much higher compared to the value of 22 mW for the pristine sample. This study presents a facile method to produce green energy through the Mg-doped HEC, which is very useful for small energy applications, especially in remote areas. Furthermore, the fabricated HEC may have the potential to replace other renewable sources of energy.
