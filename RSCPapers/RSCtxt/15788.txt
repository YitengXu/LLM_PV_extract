    , Accepted 6th July 2011First published on 10th August 2011AbstractTCO-less, flexible and highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells are fabricated with commercialized carbon fiber as the counter electrode. 5.8% of conversion efficiency was obtained via modification of the conductivity and catalytic performance of carbon fiber.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received extensive attention from both the academic and industrial communities because of their low cost, convenient production, environment-friendliness, and high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency.1 The conversion efficiency of flat DSSCs could reach a maximum of 12%.2 The typical DSSCs have three parts: a working electrode with a dye-sensitized porous semiconductor, a liquid electrolyte containing an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE). The CE plays an important role in collecting electrons from outer circuits and reducing I3− to I−.3 Hence, CE materials with high conductivity and electro-catalytic performance towards I−/I3− are desirable.3 Generally, CE is prepared by covering a layer of materials with high catalytic activity, such as Pt, on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass. However, TCO is expensive and has high sheet resistance, which limits the extensive application of DSSCs.
The use of stainless steel, Ni, and Ti substrates with high corrosion-resistance could improve the conductivity of CE.4 However, the illuminating sides of such devices still require TCO materials. Low-cost carbon materials with high chemical stability, such as graphite,5carbon black,6 porous carbon,7carbon nanotube,8 and graphene,9 are potential CE materials. Thick carbon film often needs to be adhered to TCO or other conductive substrates with binders, resulting in conductivity problems and stability problems in the electrolyte.10 Crushed carbon nanofibers in the powder form are also employed as CE recently, but they do not maintain the advantages of carbon fiber in conductivity and flexibility.11
Recently developed fiber-shaped solar cells provide an alternative to extensive application.12 Especially, those with double fiber electrodes-based architecture (fiber-shaped working electrode and fiber-shaped CE) could completely eliminate the constraints presented by TCOs.13 However, all these DSSCs currently use platinized stainless steel wire or Pt metal wire. They have problems in either device performance or cost.
In this communication, we for the first time fabricate fiber-shaped DSSCs using light-weight, inexpensive, and highly stable commercialized carbon fiber (CF) to replace Pt wire as the CE. The efficiency of fiber-shaped DSSC with pure CF as counter electrode (scheme and photo of the device are shown in Fig. 1) has been shown to reach 2.7%. Catalytic performance and conductivity of CF could be dramatically improved by platinizing and combining CF with metal wires, and the maximum efficiency of fiber-shaped DSSCs of this type could reach 5.8%. Besides, highly 1D-oriented commercialized CF has good flexibility and conductivity (104 S m−1). The excellent self-supporting and mechanical performances of commercialized CF assure that they could be used directly as electrodes to avoid the use of additional conductive substrates and binders.
 Fig. 1  (a) Scheme of the fiber-shaped DSSC; (b) optical photograph of a fiber-shaped DSSC; (c) SEM image of the carbon fiber counter electrode. 
The commercialized CF (Toray M40J) is cleaned with acetone, treated with 0.55 M (NH4)2S2O8 sulfuric acid solution, washed with deionized water and dried in air. CF bundle is comprised of highly 1D oriented monofilaments with a diameter of about 5–7 μm (Fig. 1c). The rough surface (see Fig. S1a, ESI†) not only results in higher specific surface area (1.29 m2 g−1, measured in an ASAP 2010 instrument) than that of bulk counter electrode materials, such as platinized TCO glass and Pt wire (about 10−2 m2 g−1), but also increases the number of deposition sites which is beneficial to surface modification. A platinized CF (Pt-CF) counter electrode is fabricated through magnetron sputtering (JCP-200), which contains 180 μg of Pt per mg of CF, measured by a Leeman, PROFILE SPEC instrument. The dense uniform and smooth Pt film is formed on the surface of CF with good adhesiveness (see Fig. S1b, ESI†). The CEs are prepared by simply wringing CF or Pt-CF into thin bundles with different diameters.
The working electrode with a 10–15 μm thick TiO2 porous film is fabricated on Ti wire (Φ = 250 μm, Alfa Aesar) by dip coating TiO2 colloids and sensitized with N719. The CF-based CEs or Pt wire (Φ = 100 μm) is twisted ten times around the 4 cm length working electrode. The entire electrodes have good flexibility (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Incident light could irradiate the surface of the working electrode through the gap not covered by fiber-shaped CE. Therefore TCO materials could be completely avoided. Fiber-shaped DSSCs are obtained by inserting the entire electrodes into a glass capillary (internal diameter: Φ = 0.9 mm, external diameter: Φ = 1.2 mm) filled with electrolyte. The final device in this work will be flexible entirely if it is sealed with flexible transparent plastic capillary or films. The related work is being conducted.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. 2a) is used to characterize the catalytic activity of CE materials. The CV plot for the Pt electrode with good catalytic activity shows two pairs of apparent oxidative and reductive peaks, while these peaks are not apparent for that of the CF electrode indicating the poor catalytic activity of CF. Peaks similar to that of the Pt electrode appear for the Pt-CF electrode, which proves that the catalytic activity of the CF is indeed improved. Moreover, the overall catalytic performance of Pt-CF may be benefited from the larger specific surface area of CF.

Fig. 2b compares current–voltage (I–V) curves of fiber-shaped DSSCs using pure CF electrodes with different diameters (50, 160, 230 μm) and Pt wire electrodes (diameter = 100 μm). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5), for the device DPt wire with the Pt wire electrode, the open circuit voltage (Voc) is 0.749 V; the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is 8.65 mA cm−2; the fill factor (FF) is 0.73 and the energy conversion efficiency (η) is 4.75%. The effective illumination area for calculating the conversion efficiency is taken as the projected area of the working electrode.13 Among DCF-50, DCF-160 and DCF-230, pure carbon fiber electrodes with different diameters are employed as both the catalyst and current collector in CE. The conversion efficiency is obviously increased from 0.95% to 2.70% as the diameter increases from 50 to 230 μm, mainly due to the improvement of FF. A reasonable explanation for the improvement of FF of the device with larger diameter of CF is that the higher overall catalytic surface area of the CF compensates their insufficient catalytic activity.3 However, the performance of all three pure-CF based devices is lower than that of DPt wire, which is consistent with the poor catalytic activity of pure CF described above and in the literature.3

The photovoltaic performances of fiber-shaped DSSC DPt-CF with platinized carbon fiber CE and DCF with pure carbon fiber CE (Φ = 100 μm) are shown in Fig. 3a. Compared with that of DCF, the Voc of DPt-CF does not change significantly, but Jsc increases from 6.42 to 10.55 mA cm−2, and FF increases from 0.25 to 0.67, which result in the improvement of η from 1.20% to 5.08%. The η of DPt-CF is higher than the Pt wire as described earlier, because the moderate specific surface area of conducting CF increases the catalytic area of CF-based CE and decreases the total amount of expensive catalyst. The total Pt amount of Pt-CF electrode (0.1 μg) in our 4 cm length fiber-shaped DSSCs is nearly 5-order lower than that of the Pt wire electrode (6.7 mg).

To elucidate the role of CE on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is in situ carried out under dark conditions with the devices above, and the results are shown in the form of Nyquist plots (Fig. 3b and c). In Nyquist plots, the arches around 0.5 Hz and 80 KHz correspond to the working electrode/electrolyte interface and solid-solid contact interface, e.g. the Pt/carbon fiber or CF monofilament/monofilament contact interface (around 80 KHz), respectively. Interestingly, the arch corresponding CE/electrolyte interface shifts from 10 Hz for CF to around 10 KHz for Pt-CF, indicating different interface properties. The series ohmic resistance (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance of the CE/electrolyte interface (RCT,CE) can be obtained by fitting with the modified equivalent circuit6 (Fig. 3d). When other components of the device remain unchanged, the catalytic performance and conductivity of CE correspond to the RCT,CE and RS, respectively. RCT,CE of Pt-CF is twice smaller than that of the Pt wire (17 Ω, Fig. S3, ESI†), probably due to larger specific surface area of CF. Hence, the photovoltaic performance of DPt-CF is even better than that of the DPt wire.
Another approach to improve device performance is to increase conductivity of the counter electrode. Considering the excellent conductivity of metal materials, we attempt to improve the conductivity of the CE by combining platinized CF with stainless steel wires, which are highly corrosion-resistant to electrolytes. Calogero et al. fabricated a high efficient counter electrode by coating carbon nanotubes on a stainless steel sheet, and η of the corresponding DSSC was 3.92%.14Fig. 3a shows the I–V curve of a fiber-shaped DSSC (DPt-CF/SS) with a platinized CF/stainless steel wire composite CE (Pt-CF/SS) under illumination. Compared to those of DPt-CF, the Voc and Jsc of DPt-CF/SS do not change significantly, but the fill factor increases obviously from 0.67 to 0.74, and the η of the device reaches a maximum of 5.85%, while the efficiency of only stainless steel wire CE-based cell is less than 0.2%. Data from its electrochemical impedance (Fig. 3b and c and Table 1) show that RCT,CE of DPt-CF/SS does not change much compared to that of DPt-CF, but RS is reduced by three times, indicating that the stainless steel wire contributes to a better conductivity rather than catalytic performance of the CE. In the Pt-CF/SS composite CE, platinized CF with high catalytic performance mainly serves as the catalyst, and stainless steel wires mainly serve as the current collector. Thus, the obtained device has the smallest serial resistance and charge transfer resistance, which are good for the improvement of fill factor.
The fiber-shaped DSSCs we have prepared have little dependency on the angle of incident light (Fig. 4a), which can lower the environmental requirements. Moreover, the fiber-shaped DSSCs could effectively use the incident light from all directions at the same time.15 Besides the normal incident light (SI), the diffuse reflected light (DI) is introduced by simply placing a light diffusion board at the back of the device under the same light source. Fig. 4b shows that the short-circuit current of the device is doubled after introduction of the diffusion board. Since the CE has low ohmic resistance and charge transfer resistance, the device maintains a considerable fill factor under such a high current.

In summary, we successfully fabricated TCO-less and flexible fiber-shaped DSSCs with commercialized CF as the CE. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance plots show that the conductivity and catalytic performance of carbon fiber CE are keys to improving the performance of DSSCs. To demonstrate how to improve device performance, CF is platinized and combined with metal wires. The highest energy conversion efficiency of 5.8% is obtained, and the power output could be significantly improved by multidimensional light-trapping. Our results show the potential application of carbon fiber in DSSCs. Highly conductive CF-based counter electrodes with high catalytic carbon materials and CF-based working electrodes are desirable for flexible and woven solar cells.
