    AbstractThe application of microsecond Pulsed Glow Discharge (PGD) in direct current mode to existing commercial mass spectrometers with the Grimm type fast flow sources is described. Significant improvement of analytical properties in PGD, together with time gated detection of ions, in comparison with continuous direct current discharge is demonstrated. Successful application of microsecond pulsed glow discharge with a sector field mass spectrometer for depth profile analysis is shown. Processes of the sample ion transport in PGD are investigated experimentally and theoretically.
1. Introduction
Pulsed Glow Discharges (PGD) represent a current field of research in analytical chemistry because of some special features in comparison to continuous glow discharges. Microsecond PGD can be operated at several kW of instantaneous power which may lead to a significant increase of a sample excitation and ionization. An enhancement of the analytical signal by 1–4 orders of magnitude using μs-pulsed mode for the discharge supply has been reported for different optical and mass-spectral methods.1–5 At the same time the average power of μs PGD may be significantly less than in continuous direct current (DC) or radio frequency (RF) mode, resulting in reduced thermal stress of the sample. Time of flight mass spectrometers (ToF MS) allow the detection of total spectra with high temporal resolution and therefore are preferred for a combination with μs pulsed GD sources. It was shown6 that both elemental composition and chemical structure of vaporized samples can be obtained by μs PGD and ToF MS. All this makes μs PGD an attractive ion source for mass spectrometry.
In the last 15 years fundamental aspects of μs PGD applications to mass spectrometry have been investigated. Sample ionization and transport processes have been investigated by mass spectrometry,7–11 including μs PGD in a fast flow12 Grimm type source.13,14 Besides improvement of the ion intensity in comparison with DC discharge, application of time gated detection with the PGD may be used to improve detection limits and for separation of the sample elements from ions of the carried gas.9,13,15–17 However, the application of the μs PGD for routine analysis is very limited until now because complex and expensive equipment is necessary for implementation of pulsed discharge and time gated detection. At the moment there may only be one commercial instrument which uses μs DC PGD in a hollow cathode in combination with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer.10,11 Additionally, the application of μs DC PGD to an existing sector field mass spectrometer for commercial analysis is going on14 in the EC funded Research Training Network GLADNET.
In the present work the experimental applications of μs PGD to mass spectral systems with fast flow Grimm type sources is investigated. Two systems are compared. The first one uses a fast flow Grimm type discharge cell in combination with a quadrupole mass-spectrometer (TS SOLA, Turner Scientific). The second system is based on a commercial sector-field mass spectrometer equipped with a fast flow Grimm type source (ELEMENT GD, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Analytical possibilities for bulk and depth profile analysis, analysis of thermally sensitive samples and sample conversion processes in the created systems are investigated experimentally and theoretically.
2. Experimental
A commercial quadrupole mass spectrometer TS SOLA was equipped with a home made fast flow Grimm-type glow discharge source13 with an 8 mm anode diameter (see Fig. 1). According to the basic principle of the Grimm type source,18 the evacuation of the ring slit between anode and cathode was retained. However, for the purpose of mass spectrometry, an additional channel near the exit orifice to the mass spectrometer was added to regulate both gas pressure and flow flexibly. Thus even at high pressure and gas flows the pressure behind the source remained low.

ELEMENT GD is a commercial sector-field mass spectrometer coupled to a DC fast flow glow discharge ion source with anode diameter of 8 mm (see Fig. 1).
In both instruments, the pulsed high voltage source (RUP-3A, GBS-Elektronik GmbH) was connected to the discharge chamber using existing electrical sockets, which were specified for DC power supplies. The electrical current and voltage were measured by an external digital oscilloscope. The discharge and the oscilloscope were synchronized using an external pulse generator. The pulsed power supply used has a flexible system of synchronization by external control pulses and can generate high voltage pulses (up to −3 kV) with rise time of about 100 ns. The pulser provides a maximum mean electrical current of 100 mA that allows its use in a wide range of duty cycles, up to dc mode. Additionally, a fast electronic switch, which provides fast discharging of the power supply and thus a short (<100 ns) rear edge of the generated pulse, is incorporated. Typical operation parameters of the discharge in DC and PGD modes are presented in Table 1.

In addition to investigations of the analytical properties of μs PGD, the dynamics of extracted ions from PGD to the mass analyzer has been studied (see section 3). For these investigations on ELEMENT GD, another pulsed power supply (IRCO, Instrument Research Company) was additionally used. This pulsed power supply has the same main properties as the first one, except for the maximum mean current of 7 mA and a slower voltage decrease at the end of the pulse.
In Fig. 2 electrical voltages and currents at optimal parameters (see section 5) from TS SOLA and ELEMENT GD are presented. The amplitude of the current may reach up to 2.5 A on TS SOLA at the high voltage of 2 kV, which is typical for a powerful μs PGD. On ELEMENT GD, however, the current amplitude was not greater than 200 mA assuming the cause by the construction of the discharge cell14 because the relatively wide flow tube connecting the discharge volume and the region nearby the skimmer reduces the discharge pressure.

3. Dynamics of ions extracted from PGD
In order to better understand the processes of sample ionization and transport in PGD, the dynamics of ions extracted from the discharge have been studied. Two methods for the ion dynamics measurement were used. Firstly, a special method for the ion dynamics measurement based on the gated extraction of ions from PGD by an electrode situated near the discharge chamber has been developed for TS SOLA.13 This method was then modified for ELEMENT GD.14 The formation of the ion beam, which takes place directly behind the sampler orifice, was affected by the time dependent voltage applied to one of the ion optics elements. In TS SOLA, the electrical potential of the discharge chamber was changed, in ELEMENT GD an external potential was applied to the skimmer cone. The applied voltage was synchronized with the GD pulse allowing the ion beam formation only in a specified time within the pulse period. The ion intensity recorded by the detector has been measured as a function of the applied voltage duration. Thus, time resolved intensity measurements of the ion beam formed directly behind the sampler orifice have been carried out.
Secondly, a time-gated ion detection of the ion beam has been used. In both instruments, the ion detector operated in the counting detection mode, and the signal from the detector has been fed into an external universal counter (TOE 6722, Toellner Electronic Instrumente GmbH). In the case of TS SOLA, the signal from the ion detector was preamplified and then recorded by the counter. In the case of ELEMENT GD, the amplified signal from the ion detection board of the instrument electronics has been used. In both cases, the external counter has been time-gated by a system of several function generators (HP 33120A, Hewlett-Packard, HM8150, HAMEG Instruments GmbH, respectively) which have been synchronized with the GD pulses. This system allowed the measurement of the ion beam intensity in the pulse counting mode with a time resolution of 1 μs. The timing between the discharge generation and the signal measurement has been monitored by a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix 11201, Tektronix TDS 2014B, respectively). The position of this time-gate was varied within the pulse period to record the temporal distribution of the ions. In the case of ELEMENT GD, compared to the previous approach, only ions of the minor elements in a copper sample (i.e. for which the counting detection mode could be used) have been studied.
In Fig. 3, the ion dynamics obtained using the first method (gated extraction of ions from PGD) in TS SOLA and ELEMENT GD is presented together with the ion dynamics recorded using the second method (gated detection of ions). In the case of TS SOLA, the results for copper ions are shown. In the case of ELEMENT GD, copper ions could not be used in the second method because the detector in the counting mode would be saturated. Instead, the results for lead ions are shown. The difference between the results, obtained using the two methods, is very small in TS SOLA. In the case of ELEMENT GD, results with different gas flows are presented. It is shown that the differences in time and shape of all detected ion peaks are within 50 μs, which corresponds to the temporal resolution of the gated extraction method.14 Therefore, it is assumed that the influence of the mass analyzers on the temporal propagation of extracted ions is negligible.

Additionally, Fig. 3 demonstrates a small influence of the gas flow on the ion extraction within the usual range of the gas flow (200–400 sccm) in ELEMENT GD. The ion dynamics of different ions extracted from PGD in ELEMENT GD are presented in Fig. 4. All sample ions are extracted within a relatively short phase of the PGD period, which is promising for the application of time gated detection in order to improve the detection limits of the instrument. Additionally, the time gated detection could provide the advantage of recording only that part of the pulse which carries most of the relevant sample ions separated from interfering discharge gas ions. The time separation of the sample ions from the carrier gas ions in μs PGD is demonstrated in numerous publications.9,13,15–17 In the case of TS SOLA the situation is different: the sample ions are detected during approximately 1 ms (see Fig. 3) which is comparable with the period of PGD pulses and caused by a secondary discharge.13 Therefore the application of the time gated detection makes no sense except for the above mentioned reason of interference separation.

4. Time gated detection on ELEMENT GD
From the results of the ion dynamics measurements it is obvious that in PGD the ions contribute to the detected signal only during a fraction of time, depending on the duty cycle of the GD pulses. In the rest of the time only noise is detected which deteriorates the overall S/N ratio. This is particularly a problem when ultra trace analysis is required and the ions are detected in counting mode. Therefore, to improve the analytical performance in terms of lower detection limits, it is necessary to modify the detection system of ELEMENT GD which is designed for a continuous mode of operation. Based on the results of the ion dynamics measurements, the time-gate of the external counter was set to allow recording the ion counts by the external counter between 120 and 270 μs after the beginning of the pulse. These time limits were chosen to cover the time interval in which, for the given experimental conditions, the majority of ions reach the detector (cf.Fig. 3 and 4). Two measurements were undertaken: (i) the ions were counted during the interval within the pulse period specified by the time-gate (gated detection), and (ii) the ion were counted by the external counter throughout the whole time without time-gating (non-gated detection). The ion counts were integrated by the counter for 60 s and five repetitions were undertaken. During these 60 s, the instrument was scanning over the mass window of 56Fe (55.915–55.940 m/z) and 36 data points per mass window were recorded. A copper standard reference material with 8 μg g−1 Fe was used. PGD conditions were: GD pulse voltage 1200 V, average current 6.7 mA, gas flow 424 sccm, pulse width 100 μs and the pulse frequency 500 Hz. Subsequently, the corresponding noise was measured for the two experiments and the detection limits were determined. The results are given in Table 2.

Several important features can be seen in the results. The ratio of the average background signals in the gated mode and non-gated mode is 0.04 which agrees well with the 5% duty cycle. Therefore, the distribution of the noise within the pulse period can be considered uniform. After subtracting the corresponding background counts from the overall intensities, it is clear that under these conditions and time gate settings 97% of ions were recorded within the time gate. If the limits of detection (LoD) are determined from the data using the standard 3σ definition (σ is the standard deviation of the background), it is clear that the LoD in the gated mode is by a factor of 7 lower than in the non-gated mode. Therefore, in order to fully exploit the advantages of the pulsed glow discharge coupled to the sector field mass analyser and to improve the detection limits of ELEMENT GD, it is necessary to modify the detection system so that in the counting detection mode the ions are registered by the detector only during the time when the ions are available on the detector.
5. Analytical properties of PGD
In this section analytical properties of PGD without time gated detection were investigated to separate effect of PGD itself from improvement of LoD caused by the time gated detection. Additionally it simplifies comparison of results from ELEMENT GD and TS SOLA because time gated detection was not used in TS SOLA (see section 3). To look at the analytical advantages of PGD in comparison to the continuous DC discharge, initially, a set of copper standards was chosen. For further investigation, other matrices will be analysed as well, especially aluminium, nickel and silicon are of interest. In the present study, parameters of the discharge were optimized for the best S/N ratio. The optimal parameters used in both instruments for the analysis of copper samples are presented in Table 3.

The noises in the mass spectrometers used have different behaviour. In TS SOLA, the measured noise in DC mode is about 30 cps, which is higher than noises in typical mass spectrometers. Application of PGD to TS SOLA reduces the noise by a factor of 50 which is in the same range as the duty cycle of the pulsed discharge. Therefore it is assumed that the discharge is the source of the detected noise. A possible reason for the noises is micro-sparking which may take place between the cathode and the anode tube in the source geometry used and affect the detection system. In ELEMENT GD, the measured noise is less than 1 cps in both continuous and pulsed discharge modes, and it exists even if the discharge is switched off. The noise is therefore most probably generated by the detection system of the mass spectrometer.
Calibration curves for both instruments in DC and PGD modes are presented in Fig. 5, without time gated detection, together with the level of noises corresponding to 3-σ criterion. To determine the LoD of an element the mentioned level of noises was multiplied by the slope of the calibration curve of the element. The slope was given by linear extrapolation of the calibration curve to zero. Note that this method only estimates possible improvement of LoD by PGD and doesn't include other possible effects, e.g. the influence of residual elements.
 Fig. 5  Calibration for some elements in TS SOLA (upper) and ELEMENT GD (lower) at optimal discharge parameters. 
In both instruments, the intensities of elements in DC and PGD modes are approximately the same (of course, for different elements the signals slightly vary). For TS SOLA this results in a S/N ratio in PGD mode almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than in DC mode. Thus in PGD the detection limits determined for different elements are 15–125 times better than in continuous DC discharge. In ELEMENT GD mass spectrometer S/N ratio is not higher in PGD mode with non-gated detection compared to the continuous mode which was not expected.1–5 The reason for this is the not sufficiently high electrical current achieved in PGD mode.14 However, the application of time gated detection in ELEMENT GD increases S/N ratio several times, according to the duty cycle used (see section 4).
The application of the glow discharge for the analysis of thermally sensitive samples requires a control of the applied power. At the same time a high S/N ratio is needed for trace analysis. To express this compromise quantitatively, a Sensitivity Related to Power (SRP) is introduced: , where S/N is signal to noise ratio, W is a time averaged power delivered to the discharge. Optimization of the discharge parameters for better SRP is required to get high sensitivity together with reduced thermal stress to the sample.
In TS SOLA, the consumption of electrical power averaged by time in PGD is approximately 8 times less than in the continuous DC discharge (Table 3). S/N ratios for different elements are increased by 1–2 orders in PGD (Fig. 5). Thus the application of PGD in TS SOLA results in an increase of SRP by a factor of 200–1000 for different elements.
In ELEMENT GD, the mean power in PGD and in continuous DC modes is approximately the same (Table 3), as well as the intensities of different elements and noises without time gated detection (Fig. 5). This results in approximately the same SRPs for different elements. However, the application of time gated detection increases S/N ratio by a factor of 7 (see section 4) which results in a proportional increase of SRPs.
Therefore, SRPs in PGD are significantly higher than in continuous DC discharge. This may be effectively used for the analysis of samples which are sensitive to heating. On the other hand, an increase of the mean power in PGD may potentially lead to further improvement of LoD.
6. Utilisation of PGD in analytical applications
As has been mentioned earlier, PGD have many advantages over the conventional DC continuous mode. In particular, if PGD is applied to a sector-field GD-MS instrument, a relatively slow sequential mass analyzer can still be able to perform a depth profile analysis of thin layers on substrates with a reasonably large number of data points. Additionally, due to the enhanced ionization efficiency of PGD, the intensities are still sufficiently high despite of the reduced sputtering rate. Furthermore, the lower average power delivered to the plasma enables the analysis of thermally sensitive samples. All these features will be demonstrated in the following example of an analytical application of PGD coupled to the ion source of a sector field GD-MS instrument ELEMENT GD.
Layers of CuInS2 (CIS) deposited on soda-lime glass with a Mo interlayer were analyzed using a microsecond DC PGD to obtain depth profiles of matrix and trace elements. The CIS layers are intended for the second generation of photovoltaic solar cells and in its final form include several more layers which were not deposited on the samples available for the analysis. PGD parameters were as follows: voltage of 900 V, frequency of 1 kHz, pulse width of 50 μs and Ar gas flow of 260 sccm. These conditions were found as a compromise between sufficiently strong ion intensities, thermo-mechanical stability of the glass substrate and reasonably flat crater bottom. Indeed, it was found that only a slightly higher duty cycle (and thus higher mean power) leads to a rupture of the glass substrates. In order to optimize the crater bottom it was necessary to replace the flow tube of the standard length (20 mm) by a shorter one (18 mm). The flow tubes with the standard length create gas flow conditions under which the material from the outer areas of the crater is removed faster than from the central parts (one possible reason for this is that the gas flows from the outside diameter of the flow tube towards the sample surface and is then directed back towards the skimmer cone; additionally, conditions for the sputtered material redeposition may have been changed).
Since DC pulsed voltage was used, the discharge always broke off when the electrical conductivity of the remaining crater bottom was not sufficiently high to draw away the electrical charges, i.e. when the Mo layer–glass interface was reached. Due to the sequential nature of detection in the sector-field mass analyzer and thus due to the low velocity of this type of mass analyzer, special attention had to be paid to the definition of the isotopes to be recorded, to the integration length of individual samples within a mass window and to other parameters which affect the length of one scan. The length of one scan consisting of 21 isotopes was 14 s; the break between the two successive scans was 3 s. The length of one analysis of one sample was thus ∼30 min with ∼100 spectra recorded during the analysis. A depth profile of a CIS sample as a first attempt is shown in Fig. 6 for matrix elements (a) and for trace elements (b).
 Fig. 6  Depth profiles of matrix (a) and trace elements (b) of the CuInS2/Mo layers on glass obtained using PGD in ELEMENT GD. 
The depth profiles are expressed as ion beam ratios (IBR), i.e. intensities of individual elements divided by a sum of intensities of matrix elements (S, Cu, Mo and In, in this case) which is a semi-quantitative measure of concentrations. The direct quantification of the depth profiles was not possible as no suitable calibration samples were available. It is to be investigated if the concept of standard-RSF12 could also be applied to PGD as in continuous DC-GDMS in order to improve the accuracy of semiquantitative analysis without suitable standard reference materials. The overall thickness of the layers (CIS layer + Mo layer) was determined using a profilometer as 2 μm.
In the depth profile of matrix elements, three distinct layers can be identified. At the very beginning, there is a region enriched with Cu and S and depleted of In. From the SEM results, crystals of CuS are present at the surface; these crystals are usually created in the production process on the surface and later removed by etching. The second region in the depth profile is the actual CuInS2 layer, the absorber in the photovoltaic solar cell. After the CIS layer, relatively sharp Mo build-up represents the Mo layer. At about 1600 s, the discharge became unstable until it finally extinguished.
The same samples were analysed using XPS with ion sputtering and similar results were obtained. However, there was no possibility for analysis of trace elements using XPS. Depth resolution was similar in both cases and cannot be improved due to the material issues (conductive layer deposited on a glass substrate).
The trace elements shown in Fig. 6b are those whose intensity was reproducibly higher than the background. Therefore, signals of elements with ∼4 orders of magnitude lower concentration compared to Fig. 6a can be detected (about 1 μg g−1). If the concentrations of e.g. Na, Fe, etc. should be avoided above this level in the production process, PGD with a sector-field MS can be used for this task.
7. Theoretical investigations of processes in PGD
For the interpretation of the measured dynamics of extracted ions from PGD and in order to understand the internal plasma processes, the μs PGD was numerically simulated for the used Grimm type sources.
Description of the model
The computational model used is based on the model developed for microsecond PGD in hollow cathode for mass spectrometry.16 The geometry of the discharge was adopted for the Grimm type fast flow sources. In order to take into account the Ar gas flow, which is important in the fast flow source, a separate model for simulation of the gas flow was developed.
The gas flow in a fast flow source was already simulated by a model based on the solution of the Navier–Stokes equations.19 Then the results of the gas flow model were used as input parameters of the discharge model. In our work, the same approach is used but the gas flow model is based on a Monte-Carlo (MC) method. The MC based model is more complex and has a certain statistical inaccuracy. Although the statistical inaccuracy may be reduced by application of more simulated particles, there is ever a compromise between the accuracy and the computational time. However, the interactions of the simulated gas with walls of the chamber are described on microlevel in the MC method which requires a lower number of assumptions about the interaction processes and is more convenient and flexible. In this way, heat transfer, gettering effects and surface reactions may be included in the model. The Navier–Stokes equations require boundary conditions. Typically, the gas pressure in the gas inlet or in the pumping line channel is needed, which is not experimentally known. Therefore, the use of the Navier–Stokes equations is linked with some uncertainty. In the MC method the gas particles introduction is linked with the gas flow in the inlet channel, which is easy to measure. Additionally, the MC based method may be used in the areas with low pressure, where Navier–Stokes equations are not valid, e.g. in the area behind the sampler.
The input parameters of the gas flow model developed are the discharge chamber geometry and the Ar gas flow. The results are the spatial distribution of the Ar concentration n(), of the Ar flow velocity () and of the Ar temperature T(). The gas flow model is an iterative procedure. In each iteration, n(), () and T() are calculated using distributions nprev(), prev() and Tprev() from the previous iteration. In the first iteration, any reasonable distributions of these quantities are taken. The iterations are calculated until convergence.
In the iteration, the movement of atoms is simulated by MC method. Each simulated atom is introduced in the area near the gas inlet channel. The speed of the atom is initialized by a random number generator with a Maxwellian distribution according to prev and Tprev. The trajectory of the atom is then simulated step by step assuming a linear particle movement: 1 = 0 + Δ, where 0 is the initial atom coordinate, 1 is the final coordinate and Δ is the space step in the direction of the atom velocity. After each atom movement step, simulation of the atom collisions takes place: a random number between 0 and 1 is compared with the collision probability20,21P = 1 − exp(−|Δ|nprevσ)where σ = 2.8 × 10−16 cm2 is the Ar–Ar elastic collision cross-section. If this random number is less than P then the collision is simulated: the speed and direction of the simulated particle motion are changed according to the hard spheres scattering model. The target atom velocity is calculated using a random number generator with a Maxwellian distribution according to prev and Tprev. In this method multiple collisions in the trajectory step are not taken into account. To avoid the influence of multiple collisions on the statistical results |Δ| = 0.02 cm is chosen. With this value the probability of multiple collisions is negligible in our conditions. When a particle collides with the wall of the chamber, it is mirror-reflected. After the reflection the absolute value of the atom speed is changed according to the wall temperature. Direction of the movement of the reflected atom remains unchanged. The particle moves until it reaches the evacuation channel of the discharge chamber. Then it is removed from the model. A sufficiently large number of particles is taken in the simulation to provide statistically relevant results.
To calculate the distribution of n,  and T, the parameters of the simulated particles are recorded after each movement step in knots of the grid which covers the chamber space. At the end of each iteration, n,  and T are calculated in the grid knots according to the statistical thermodynamics laws:  where I is the gas flow (in particles per second units), ΔV is elementary volume of the grid cell, i is speed of particles, m is atom mass, k is Boltzmann constant, N is count of records in the given grid knot, Np is number of simulated particles. The expression for the gas temperature T requires a thermodynamic equilibrium of the gas, which usually takes place in a glow discharge.
The results of the gas flow model have been incorporated in the microsecond PGD model described earlier16 in the following way. In the discharge stage, the calculated n,  and T are introduced in the calculations of the collisions. The collision probability of different particles with neutral Ar atoms is given byPdis = 1 − exp(−|Δdis|nσdis)where Pdis is the collision probability, |Δdis| is the distance passed by the simulating particle, n is the calculated Ar atom concentration, σdis is the collision cross-section. The speed of the target Ar atom is found using a random number generator with a Maxwellian distribution corresponding to the calculated  and T. In the afterglow stage, a convective term is added to the transport equations:aft = −Daft grad naft − μaftnaft grad V + naftwhere aft, Daft, naft, μaft are the flow density, diffusion, concentration and mobility of the simulating particles in the afterglow (μaft = 0 for atoms), respectively, V is the afterglow electrical potential and  is the calculated speed of the Ar flow.
ELEMENT GD
In Fig. 7, calculated concentrations of different particles in the discharge and its afterglow averaged over the discharge space are presented. The maximum of the concentration of the sample (Cu) ions may be found in the afterglow. The only source of the sample ions in the model of afterglow is Penning ionization by metastable Ar atoms, so this reaction is responsible for the formation of the sample ion peak in afterglow. The calculated sample atom and ion distributions on the axis are presented in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the Cu atoms are intensively transported by the Ar flow (300 sccm) to the skimmer through the tube. This is in agreement with the results of theoretical investigation of the DC discharge in the fast flow source19 where a dominant role of the Ar flow in the transportation of the sample material was confirmed. The Cu ions are also transported by the Ar flow and, additionally, undergo the recombination process and faster ambipolar diffusion in the electrical field which is formed in the afterglow. Because the sample ion and atom concentrations are significantly reduced during the propagation of the sample material to the cone through the tube, it is strongly recommended to reduce the length of the tube keeping the distance between the cathode and the tube edge constant.

A combination of Penning ionization in the afterglow and intensive transportation by the gas flow leads to the following picture of the main processes: the sample atoms are sputtered from the cathode in the discharge phase. During the discharge and the afterglow phase, the atoms are transported by the gas flow to the skimmer through the tube. They are ionized, mostly by Penning ionization, in the whole cell volume, including the discharge area and the inner tube space as far as the skimmer. Additionally, intensive losses of the sample material takes place on the tube walls during the transportation. As a result, most of the sample ions generated in the discharge phase are lost during the transportation. The sample ions coming to the mass analyzer through the cone orifice are generated in the space near the skimmer as a result of Penning ionization.
TS SOLA
Processes in microsecond PGD in TS SOLA were experimentally and theoretically investigated earlier13 using the model described above. It was found that there was a secondary discharge (SD) between the discharge chamber and the skimmer. The sample material is sputtered during the microsecond PGD and transported to the SD. In the SD the sample atoms are ionized and then transported to the mass analyzer. Thus the SD is the main source of sample ion formation in the used TS SOLA.
8. Conclusion
Microsecond PGD is successfully and relatively easily applied to existing commercial mass spectrometers with Grimm type fast flow sources. It is shown that PGD together with time gated detection of ions (if possible) significantly increase both S/N ratios and SRPs (Sensitivity Related to Power) of different elements. The latter is promising for analysis of thermally sensitive samples or further improvement of detection limits with higher applied power. In both mass spectrometers used intensities of signals are of the same order of magnitude in continuous and pulsed modes. Therefore instantaneous ionization degree in PGD is by 1–2 orders higher than in the DC discharge, which is in agreement with previous investigations of μs PGD.1–5
It is demonstrated that PGD installed on a commercial sector-field mass spectrometer equipped with the fast-flow GD ion source and originally designed for bulk analysis may be successfully used for depth profile analysis. The focus is especially on trace analysis in thin layers and it has been shown that both matrix elements and trace elements with 4 orders of magnitude lower signal can be detected. Thin film solar cell materials are hot topic analytical applications and PGD in combination with a sector-field MS can provide valuable information. However, quantification of the results in the PGD mode will be a subject of further investigations.
Sample transportation processes in PGD are investigated experimentally and theoretically. The analysis of processes in ELEMENT GD and TS SOLA reveals the following feature: the formation of the analytical signal of the sample in microsecond PGD in the fast flow sources for mass spectrometry is separated from the pulsed discharge temporally (in the afterglow) and spatially (in the secondary discharge in TS SOLA and near the skimmer in ELEMENT GD). This feature is probably a native property of the fast flow source concept owing to the intensive transportation of the sample material from the discharge area by the gas flow.
