, Accepted 29th July 2014First published on 30th July 2014AbstractIn this paper, Nb-doped WO3 nanowires were successfully prepared using a low-temperature, hydrothermal method. The physicochemical properties of pristine and Nb-doped WO3 were determined by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-vis). The photocatalytic properties of those Nb-doped WO3 nanomaterials are evaluated on the basis of their ability to degrade methylene blue (MB) in an aqueous solution under simulated sunlight irradiation. It is demonstrated that the pristine nanowires tend to aggregate, whereas the energy band gap of those nanomaterials narrows as more niobium ions are doped. The photocatalytic experimental results indicated that the Nb-doped WO3 exhibited superior photocatalytic activities to that of the undoped WO3. The Nb-doped WO3 nanowires synthesized with an Nb/W molar ratio of 0.03 possessed the most effective photocatalytic activity among the tested samples.
1 Introduction
Nanostructured oxide semiconductors have attracted considerable interest because of their potential applications in devices such as gas sensors, solar cells, and photocatalysts.1–4 Recently, many different semiconductors, such as TiO2, SnO2, WO3, CdS and ZnO, were investigated as photocatalytic materials.5 In spite of the intensive research on those heterogeneous photocatalysts, the low light-harvesting efficiency of current available semiconductors limits their applications as commercial photocatalytic devices. One key to enhance the performance could be rational doping with lanthanide, transitional metal ions, biogenic elements or judicious coupling on the basis of inhibiting charge recombination, which are revealed by some previous literatures.6–8 For example, rare-earth-doped TiO2 exhibited better photoactivity as compared with bare TiO2, and Ce-doped ZnO possessed higher optical performance than that of undoped ZnO.9,10
WO3 has extensive application prospects as one of the N-type semiconductors and functional materials, which has been studied extensively during the past several decades.11–17 In contrast to widely used TiO2, WO3 has started to draw attention because of its smaller band gap, guaranteeing that WO3 would absorb more solar energy and thus generate a larger photocurrent. Moreover, WO3 has satisfactory photoelectron transport properties, which renders the feasibility of being an excellent photocatalyst.18–20 However, it has been found that pure tungsten oxide, e.g. WO3, has lower light energy conversion efficiency than TiO2 as the reduction potential of the electrons in WO3 is low due to its low conduction band level.21 Research has shown that metal-ion doping can improve the conductivity of metal–oxide semiconductors;22–25 hence, we resort to doped tungsten oxides. The unoccupied f electron orbit of rare earth elements could act as either acceptor or donor for lone-pair electrons. The doping of rare earth elements (REEs) is supposed to generate some low energy level between the conduction and valence bands of WO3, favoring the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The doping of Eu3+,26 Ce3+,27 Dy3+,28 and Yb3+ (ref. 29) are reported to contribute to the reduction of the forbidden energy gap. Hence, the REE-doped WO3 exhibited better photocatalytic activity than that of the pristine. Another significant field is the doping of transition metals (TMs). The substitution of W with Mo resulting in MoxW1−xO3 hydrates could enhance photoelectrochemical response to visible light.30 Ti-doped WO3 exhibited improved photocatalytic activity. Some valuable principles have been formed to guide rational doping.31 Because of the effect of high-valence dopant, we selected the guest cation with a similar ionic radii or electron structure, aimed at making a doped oxide instead of dopant-oxide clusters on the host oxide.
Niobium is a typical transition metal, and the successful preparation of Nb-doped WO3 nanomaterial utilized as photochromic film32–34 and gas sensors35,36 have been reported recently. However, few studies exist on the photocatalytic activity of Nb-doped WO3 nanomaterials. High surface area37 and low-dimensional morphology of Nb-doped WO3 reasonably could expand its application as promising photocatalyst. Hence, in this work, a collection of WO3 with various niobium doping amounts have been fully characterized. The correlation between the nanostructures and photocatalytic performance has been elaborated.
2 Experimental details
2.1 Synthesis of Nb-doped WO3 nanomaterials
The synthetic method of Nb-doped WO3 as follows: 2 g analytical grade Na2WO4·2H2O was dissolved in 45 mL deionized water under stirring at room temperature. Then, 0.1 mol L−1 NbCl5 solution (dissolving in ethanol, the atomic ratios of Nb to W = 0, 0.03, 0.07, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) and 5 mL of 3 mol l−1 HCl solution was then added into the abovementioned solution under continuous stirring until tungstenic acid was precipitated thoroughly. Finally, 35 mL of 0.5 mol L−1 ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) solution was added into this solution, which was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL. Hydrothermal treatments were carried out at 170 °C for 48 h. After that, the autoclave was allowed to cool down naturally. The final products were collected, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried in air at 80 °C. The Nb-doped WO3 were finally obtained.
2.2 Materials characterization
The crystalline structures of the as-prepared samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (PXRD, X'Pert PRO, PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands) with Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm at 40 kV and 45 mA). The sizes and shapes of the nanostructures were observed on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Philips XL30 FEG, Eindhoven, Netherlands) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM200CX, 120 kV). The composition of the samples was analyzed by an energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX, Thermo Noran VANTAG-ESI, 120 kV). The chemical state of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a RBD-upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin-Elmer) using Mg-monochromatic X-rays at a power of 25 W with an X-ray-beam diameter of 10 mm and a pass energy of 29.35 eV. The binding energy was calibrated by the C 1s hydrocarbon peak at 284.8 eV. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was carried out on an UV-vis spectrometer (Lambda 850, PerkinElmer, USA), equipped with an integrating sphere and a BaSO4 reference.
2.3 Photocatalytic measure
The photocatalytic activities of Nb-doped WO3 samples were evaluated by observing the degradation of the MB aqueous solution at ambient temperatures using a 300 W high-pressure mercury lamp as light source. In a typical process, 50 mg of photocatalyst was added to 100 mL of 10 mg L−1 MB−1 aqueous solution in a quartz glass container. Prior to irradiation, the solution was continuously stirred under darkness for 1 h to ensure the equilibrium of the working solution. The suspensions were kept under constant air-equilibrated conditions before and during the irradiation. Analytical samples (3 mL) were drawn from the reaction suspension every 10 min, the photocatalyst was removed by centrifugation, and the concentration of residual MB aqueous solution was measured by the UV-vis spectrophotometer at 550 nm. The degradation efficiency of MB was defined by the equation of c/c0[25], where C is the concentration of MB aqueous solution after light irradiation, and C0 is the equilibrium concentration of MB at the equilibrium adsorption state.
3 Result and discussion
3.1 Characterization of as-synthesized samples
The XRD patterns of the as-obtained products are shown in Fig. 1. All of the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the pure hexagonal phase of WO3 (JCPDS card 33-1387). The XRD peak intensity of the (001) plane is stronger compared with that of other planes, indicating that the (001) is the major growth direction. The results suggested the following information: (1) Nb-doped WO3 samples have good crystallinity and high purity. (2) Undoped WO3 and Nb-doped WO3 belong to the hexagonal crystalline phase. (3) Typical Nb2O5 XRD peaks are not observed, which indicates that Nb may be in the space of WO3 lattice. Furthermore, the concentration of Nb-doping is too low to be detected by XRD. (4) Doping WO3 with Nb ions did not change the crystal structure of WO3. (5) The diffraction peaks transfer to a low degree with an increase in Nb-doping concentration. This phenomenon indicated that Nb-doping WO3 resulted in the spread of the crystal lattice of WO3.37 This may be attributed the diameter of the Nb5+ being slightly larger than the space available within the WO3 cell. This crystal lattice distortion could induce more defects, such as oxygen vacancies, which have been proposed to be the active sites in heterogeneous catalysis.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the WO3 doped with varying amounts of niobium ions. From a–f, the atomic ratios of Nb/W were 0, 0.03, 0.07, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2, respectively. 
It has been recognized that the size and shape of a nanoscale photocatalyst particle profoundly affect its reaction performance. The morphology-dependent photocatalyst could selectively expose the reactive facet on which the active sites can be enriched and tuned.38 In this work, the Nb ionic concentration in the reaction system had a significant influence on the morphology of the final products. The SEM images presented in Fig. 2 clearly demonstrate the evolution of the morphology as a function of the doping amount. Fig. 2a shows the morphology of the undoped WO3 sample, which is composed of a large quantity of interconnected nanowires. Fig. 2b–f shows the morphologies of the Nb-doped WO3 samples with varying the Nb ion concentration. According to Fig. 2b (Nb/W = 0.03), the Nb-doped WO3 sample with a uniform wire-like morphology can be obtained. With increasing Nb/W atomic ratio (0.03–0.07), morphological evolution of the final product can be observed, from the longer nanowires (Fig. 2a) to shorter (Fig. 2b), then to two-dimensional agglomerated nanorods (Fig. 2c). The doped nanowires become stacked and shortened, whereas the pristine are about 30 nm in diameter and 500 nm to a few microns in length, as illustrated by the TEM images in Fig. 3. Fig. 3c and d are HRTEM images of undoped WO3 nanowires (c) and Nb-doped WO3 (d), respectively. It can be seen that the parallel lattice planes become slightly blurred, suggesting that the growth direction of (001) of the WO3 nanowires is inhibited and incorporation of Nb5+ into WO3 framework could cause the lattice fringes of WO3 distortion and induce more defects.39 This result agrees with that of XRD previously discussed. Further increasing the Nb concentration resulted in formation of nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2d and e, a mixture of morphology of nanoparticles and nanorods were obtained when the Nb/W atomic ratio was 0.05. At relatively higher Nb ion concentrations (Fig. 2f), the agglomeration of nanosheets were obtained.

Hydrothermal synthesis has been widely proven to be a simple and convenient route for realizing nanomaterials with controllable morphologies and stoichiometries at relatively low temperatures and short reaction times. In this system, the Nb ion inclusions have an obvious effect on the morphologies of final products. The growth of WO3 nanoparticles followed the traditional Ostwald ripening and oriented-attachment mechanisms in the process.23,24 The WO3 nuclei were quickly formed from precursors with sufficient energy provided by the hydrothermal system. With the presence of (NH4)2SO4, WO3 nuclei serve as seeds and grow along the [001] direction of hex-WO3 unit cell due to the sulfate preferentially absorbed on the faces parallel to the c-axis of the WO3 nanocrystal, resulting in the formation of nanowires. Based on the results of the TEM, it was deduced here that inducing the Nb ions into the reaction system might serve as a growth controller. The Nb5+ could enter into the lattice of WO3 to replace W6+ or W5+ ions due to its slightly larger ionic radius, causing the lattice fringe of the WO3 nanowires to blur and leading to the appearance of many crystal defects that provide favourable location sites for the Nb ions. This deduction is coincident with the Mo-doped WO3 in some literature.39 Moreover, Nb5+ may exist in the form of Nb2O5, which occurred in two different places. Firstly, they were loaded on the surface of the WO3 nanowires along the body, possibly around the defective sites of the nanowires. The possibly formed Nb2O5 may serve as centers for the self-assembly of the as-formed nanowires, leading to the formation of nanorods or nanoparticles (see Fig. 2(b)–(f)). Secondly, some of the Nb2O5 formed occurred at the tips of the WO3 nanowires, prohibiting one-dimensional growth and finally resulting in shorter nanowires and nanorods (see Fig. 2b and c).27
The specific surface areas (BET) of Nb-doped WO3 with different atomic ratios of Nb/W were examined. Fig. 4 shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. The curves of all samples exhibited a typical type-III isotherm with a hysteresis loop originated from the small, slit-shaped pores. The BET surface area of undoped WO3 was 19.42 m2 g−1, and the surface areas of the Nb-doped WO3 were 112.71, 57.983, 28.70, 22.70 and 13.41 m2 g−1, corresponding to the atomic ratios of Nb/W was 0.03, 0.07, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2, respectively. As a result, the Nb-doped WO3 sample had the larger surface area, which can affect the photocatalytic properties of WO3.
 Fig. 4  Nitrogen sorption isotherm curves of WO3 doped with varying amounts of niobium ions. 
The surface composition of Nb-doped WO3 (Nb/W = 0.03) can be determined by EDS (see ESI, Fig. S1†). No detectable impurity except a negligible amount of stained carbon could be observed according to Fig. 4, and the atomic ratio of niobium to tungsten is 0.0295, which is almost equal to the doping ratio. This indicates that the niobium cations are totally incorporated within the stacked WO3 nanowires via hydrothermal synthesis.
The chemical states of W and Nb in the as-prepared sample with the atomic ratio of Nb/W of 0.07 were determined by an XPS spectrum. Fig. 5a shows the XPS spectrum of the tungsten core level (W4f) in the undoped WO3 sample. The two peaks at 35.6 and 37.7 eV in the spectrum can be attributed to W4f7/2 and W4f5/2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the reported values.40 These two peaks are well separated without any shoulder, which indicates that all W atoms are in the +6 oxidization state. However, another doublet at the electron binding energies of 34.9 and 37.0 eV shown in Fig. 4b could be identified as the W5+ oxidation state. The XPS spectrum of Nb 3d shows well-distinguished doublet peaks at binding energies of 207.1 and 209.8 eV, respectively (Fig. 5c). These binding energy values can be assigned to Nb3d3/2 and Nb3d5/2, which describe a +5 oxidation state for the Nb ions. From these results, we can conclude that the chemical compositions in Nb-doped WO3 sample are WO3−x, WO3 and Nb2O5. However, it must be noted that the relative amount of Nb2O5 in the resulting products should be below the detection limit of the XRD analysis.

The surface characterizations evidenced the speculation that Nb5+ has been incorporated into the host framework of WO3, thereupon modifying the electron structure of tungsten in terms of occurrence of W5+.
Room temperature UV-vis reflectance spectra of the WO3 with different Nb-doping concentrations are shown in Fig. 6. The spectra of the Nb-doped WO3 samples show the red shifts in band gap transition and the absorption edge to the longer wavelength. The band gap (Eg) of the semiconductor can be determined according to the equation41 
(hνa)1/n = A(hν − Eg),
(1)where h, ν, a, Eg and A are Planck's constant, frequency of vibration, absorption coefficient, band gap and proportional constant, respectively. The value of the exponent n denotes the nature of the sample transition. It is known that the WO3 crystal is an indirect-allowed transition semiconductor. In this case, n = 2 is used.42 The α in the Tauc equation can be substituted with F(R), which is the so-called remission or Kubelka–Munk function,43 expressed as 
(2)where R is the reflectance coefficient. Thus, in the actual experiment, the relational expression becomes the linear extrapolation of the plots of (F(R)hν)1/2 versus hν. The energy band gap is determined using an extrapolation of the linear region to hν = 0, illustrated by the inset of Fig. 6. The values of the band gaps are 2.62, 2.77, 2.78, 2.78, 2.79 and 2.83 eV, respectively. The band gap of WO3 narrowed due to doping with Nb. WO3 is a widely used n-type semiconductor, which has band gap values ranging from 2.6 eV to 3.2 eV.44 Two possible reasons should account for the varied band gap of WO3. Firstly, their crystallinity and morphology are altered depending on the reaction conditions applied during the preparation of the samples. Changing the doping concentrations of Nb in the preparation step inevitably produce new crystal defects, such as dislocations and stacking faults, which would lead to the formation of localized states in the band gap of WO3, finally resulting in decreased band gap. Secondly, it is reasonable to propose that an increase of oxygen vacancies can also significantly decrease the band gap values of the materials.45

3.2 Photocatalytic properties of as-synthesized sample
Photocatalytic properties of the Nb-doped nanowires were evaluated based on their ability to degrade the MB solutions under simulated sunlight irradiation. Fig. 7 shows the time course of MB degradation efficiencies over different photocatalysts. It is found that the Nb-doped WO3 has much higher photocatalytic activities than that of the undoped WO3. However, it is interesting to note that, at relatively higher Nb/W am ratios (0.03–0.20), the photocatalytic activities of the Nb-doped WO3 photocatalysts increased with increasing Nb ion concentration. The photocatalytic activities of Nb-doped WO3 photocatalysts (Nb/W = 0.03) were found to be better than other doping concentrations of WO3, the photodegradation efficiency of MB was 85% with 120 min, whereas the product with a doping ratio of 0.07 outstands within the first 90 minutes. Further increasing the irradiation time resulted in the photocatalytic activity of Nb-doped WO3 photocatalysts (Nb/W = 0.07) decreasing slightly; however, the product synthesized at an atomic ratio of Nb/W of 0.03 remained unchanged.
 Fig. 7  Photocatalytic degradation of MB by the as-prepared samples. 
The photocatalytic properties of photocatalysts are closely related to their energy band level, morphology, crystalline structure, and surface modification. It is interesting to note that the Nb-doped WO3 nanoparticles possessed improved photocatalytic activities compared with the undoped WO3 nanowires. This could be attributed to four possible mechanisms. Firstly, the doping of Nb ions could decrease the band gap of WO3, which could be attributed to the introduction of acceptor energy levels below the conduction level of WO3. Therefore, the Nb-doped WO3 nanoparticles have higher solar energy conversion efficiencies than that of the undoped WO3, thus leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity.46 Secondly, at a higher concentration of Nb ions, the number of Nb2O5 adsorbed on the surface of WO3 may favor separating the charge carriers, prolonging the life of carriers, inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and eventually enhancing the photocatalytic activity.47 Thirdly, the Nb2O5 is located at the boundaries between single WO3 nanowires because the coupling of two semiconductor oxides with different energies for the valence and allows the vectorial transfer of photoexcited electrons and holes from one oxide to the other. Thus, a depletion region forming at the Nb2O5–WO3 interface would considerably decrease the possibility of charge-carrier recombination and increase the efficiency of the charge-transfer process. Fourthly, the active surface area of nanoparticles is also crucial to the electrocatalytic property. From a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, we can see that surface areas of undoped WO3 and Nb-doped WO3 (Nb/W = 0.03) nanowires are 19.42 and 112.71 cm3 g−1, respectively (see Fig. 4). The surface area of WO3 was clearly added after the doping of Nb ions, resulting in increasing active locations and further improving its photocatalytic activity. Generally, the niobium-doped WO3 sample with a divergent morphology offers a promising candidate nanomaterial for photocatalysis.23,48
4 Conclusion
In summary, the Nb-doped WO3 samples were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method in the presence of ammonium sulfate. The Nb ion concentration played a crucial role in the evolution of the morphology of the final products. The morphological evolution of Nb-doped WO3 samples was explained by the typical Ostwald ripening and oriented-attachment mechanisms. The Nb-doped WO3 nanowires were found to possess superior photocatalytic activities for the degradation of the MB solution to that of the undoped WO3 nanowires under simulated sunlight irradiation, which could be due to the decreased band gaps of the Nb-doped WO3. A small amount of Nb-doping could obviously enhance the photocatalytic activity of WO3 nanowires. The Nb-doped WO3 nanowires synthesized at an optimal atomic ratio of Nb/W of 0.03 exhibited the most effective photocatalytic activity among the tested samples. In this paper, the dopant amount is one of the investigated synthetic factors determining the microstructure and morphology. The exploration of other important determinants is needed in order to make an excellent photocatalysis.
Our next step will focus on the syntheses of highly dispersive Nb-doped WO3 nanowires by a thorough investigation of those hydrothermal parameters, including the pH, temperature, precursor type and concentration, template, and solvent. The vast chemistry of metal doping is far from maturity and more fundamental work focusing the structure–property–application mechanism is under way.
