    , Accepted 8th February 2018First published on 9th February 2018AbstractSo far, the most successful and widely used solvents in polymer solar cells (PSCs) are chlorinated solvents like chloroform (CF), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and chlorobenzene (CB), which are highly detrimental to human health and the environment. In this work, by the approach of manipulating flexible and conjugated side groups of a widely used polymer donor material (PBDB-T), two new polymers named PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT are designed and synthesized to improve the solubility and fine-tune the aggregation property in tetrahydrofuran (THF), a much more benign solvent. As a result, an outstanding PCE of 12.10% was achieved with the THF-processed PBDB-BzT:IT-M device. The result in this work demonstrates the importance to modulate the aggregation effect of the polymer in solution by inserting conjugated groups and also suggests a feasible method to convert the main processing solvent of a highly efficient non-fullerene (NF)-PSC from CB into THF.
Introduction
Solution-processable polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure have attracted considerable interest due to their potential in making flexible and large area devices through printing techniques.1–4 In PSCs, new photoactive materials played an essential role in advancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In the early stages of bulk heterojunctions, fullerene derivatives were predominantly used as acceptors. The recent emergence of new non-fullerene (NF) acceptors with strong light absorption capabilities, highly tunable molecular energy levels and good electron mobilities offered the opportunities to realize higher PCEs than fullerene-based acceptors and the highest PCEs of PSCs based on NF acceptors, also known as NF-PSCs, have caught up and then surpassed those of fullerene-based devices.5–15 However, besides PCE, PSCs are still facing some critical problems for future industrialization, one of which is to remove the highly polluting processing solvents from the device fabrication process.
Until now, the widely used solvents in PSC fabrication are chlorinated solvents like chloroform (CF), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and chlorobenzene (CB), because of their strong ability to dissolve organic semiconductors. However, the use of these solvents is restricted in industry because they are highly detrimental to the environment. In general, two strategies, device engineering and material design have been mainly employed to solve this problem. From the aspect of device engineering, the problem could be solved by replacing the highly toxic solvents with the less polluting ones.16–25 For example, Yan et al. used 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene to replace CB and realized a PCE of 11.70% in a polymer:fullerene-based device.20 Although this strategy is feasible, the scope of solvent selection is relatively narrow due to the limited solubility of the materials, and aromatic solvents still need to be used. From the aspect of material design, the solubility of the photoactive materials could be tuned by introducing functional groups with different solvation effects with the solvents.26–29 For instance, by replacing the alkyl side chains with triethylene glycol monoether (TEG), the solubility of some conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives could be significantly modulated, and based on these materials, PSCs could be fabricated by using non-chlorinated and non-aromatic solvents like N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylformamide and so on.28,29 In this strategy, the solubility can be significantly tuned, but the phase separation morphologies in the active layers might be affected too much and hence often lead to much lower PCEs. Therefore, it is still a great challenge in terms of molecular design to convert an organic photovoltaic material from toxic solvent processable into benign solvent processable without sacrificing its photovoltaic performance.
Small-molecule NF acceptors offer opportunities to fabricate benign-solvent-processable devices with high photovoltaic performance due to their good solubilities in various solvents. Our recent results demonstrated that a PCE of 11.34% could be obtained in a NF-PSC by using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the main processing solvent.30 However, when we attempted to replace CB by THF to fabricate another efficient NF-PSC based on the representative photoactive blend of PBDB-T:IT-M,8 a great drop in PCE was observed. According to the reported studies, the polymer donors used in the highly efficient NF-PSCs usually exhibited strong aggregation effects in the processing solvents, which ensures the formation of nanoscale phase separation with high domain purity.31–34 Empirically, THF is a poorer solvent for conjugated polymers than CB,30,35,36 so a polymer with a strong aggregation effect in CB may have poor solubility in THF, which potentially leads to unfavorable phase separation morphologies. Therefore, we infer that, for a NF-PSC consisting of a highly soluble NF acceptor and a polymer donor, the aggregation effect of the polymer donor in various solvents will provide critical information for guiding material design towards highly efficient and green solvent processable devices.
In this contribution, we initially use CB and THF as the main processing solvents, respectively, to fabricate two devices by adopting PBDB-T13,37 and IT-M8 as the photoactive materials and find that the THF-processed device shows much lower PCE than the CB-processed device, i.e. 6.41% versus 11.74%, demonstrating that the high performance NF-PSC cannot be fabricated by using the low toxic solvent because severe phase separation occurred due to the strong aggregation effect of PBDB-T in THF. Then, we changed the flexible alkyls of the polymer and synthesized a polymer named PBDB-T-BO, which exhibits improved solubility in THF and also weaker aggregation effect in CB. PBDB-T-BO almost shows no aggregation effect in CB or THF, and when it was blended with IT-M, the phase separation was too weak to achieve favorable carrier transport in devices and hence led to low PCE. Aiming for enhancing the carrier transport capability, we further enlarged the conjugated side groups and synthesized another new polymer PBDB-BzT. This polymer shows good solubility and enhanced aggregation effect in both CB and THF. As a result, the THF-processed PBDB-BzT:IT-M blend film shows very similar phase separation morphology to that observed in the CB-processed PBDB-T:IT-M blend film, resulting in a PCE of 12.10%. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the highest value for the NF-PSCs processed using non-chlorinated and non-aromatic solvents.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of the polymers
The synthetic route of the new polymer is described in Scheme 1. PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT are synthesized by referring to the previous work,37,38 and the detailed synthetic procedures are presented in the ESI.† The polymers of PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT were obtained by Stille coupling polymerization as follows. The BDT monomer (0.5 mmol) and BDD monomer (0.5 mmol) were mixed in 10 mL of toluene. After purging with argon for 5 min, Pd(PPh3)4 (25 mg) was added as the catalyst in one portion, and the mixture was then purged with argon for another 20 min. The reaction was stirred at 110 °C for 17 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature. The polymer was precipitated from 50 mL of methanol and then collected after filtration. The polymer was purified through column chromatography by using hot chloroform as the eluent, and then precipitated from methanol again. The polymer was collected and dried in a vacuum oven, and then obtained as a dark purple solid with a yield of ∼60%.

Molecular energy levels and temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra
The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PBDB-T, PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT are 18.8 kDa, 12.7 kDa and 13.5 kDa, with polydispersity index (PDI) values of 2.68, 2.26 and 2.03, respectively. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were employed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the three polymers. As shown in Fig. S1 (see the ESI†), the HOMO levels of PBDB-T, PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT are −5.30, −5.38, and −5.36 eV, respectively, and the difference in the HOMO level of the polymers can be ascribed to the changes in the functional groups and the aggregation structures in the solid state.
As shown in Fig. 1a, the three polymers exhibit similar optical absorption spectra in solid films, i.e. the absorption peaks are all at 630 nm with the edges at approximately 710 nm. Temperature-dependent absorption spectra (TD-Abs) were measured to investigate the aggregation effects of the three polymers in CB and THF solutions (Fig. 1b and S2†), respectively. For the solutions in CB, the measurements were conducted in the temperature range from 120 to −10 °C with a 10 °C interval and the THF solutions were all measured from 50 °C to −10 °C (below the boiling point). The starting polymer PBDB-T has a strong aggregation effect in CB at low temperature but the aggregation effect can be significantly reduced at high temperature, and as a result, the absorption peak at 620 nm almost disappears at 120 °C. Compared with PBDB-T, although PBDB-T-BO shows an identical absorption peak at 630 nm in the solid state, the CB solution of PBDB-T-BO shows a 20 nm blue shift at low temperature, i.e. 600 nm for PBDB-T-BO in CB at −10 °C versus 620 nm for PBDB-T in CB at −10 °C, implying that the former has a weaker aggregation effect in CB solution than the latter. For the CB solution of PBDB-BzT, the absorption peak at 620 nm reduces obviously with increasing the temperature, while it can still be clearly observed at 120 °C. For the three samples in THF, a similar trend can be observed but less information can be obtained than the CB solutions due to the limited temperature range of the measurements. Overall, the TD-Abs results demonstrate that the aggregation effect in solution of PBDB-T can be greatly reduced by enlarging the alkyls and then enhanced by further extending the conjugated side groups. Obviously, the change in the aggregation effect should affect the solubility of the polymers. As it is quite difficult to accurately measure the solubility of conjugated polymers with a strong and broad light absorption spectrum, we designed a simple experiment to show the difference in solubility or dispersibility of the three polymers. As shown in Fig. S3,† we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the surface topography of the thin films of the three polymers by spin-coating their solutions in THF with different concentrations. For the PBDB-T solution with a concentration of 3 mg mL−1, which is much lower than the concentration used for device fabrication, the surface of the spin-coated film is very rough and huge aggregations can be observed. For the PBDB-T-BO solution with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1, the surface of the spin-coated film is still very smooth, implying that this polymer can be well dispersed into THF at this concentration. For the film spin-coated from the PBDB-BzT solution with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1, surface roughness is slightly larger than the PBDB-T-BO film and nano-scaled aggregation can be distinguished. According to the TD-Abs and AFM data, we can conclude that the aggregation effect of PBDB-BzT in THF is between those of PBDB-T and PBDB-T-BO.

2-D grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis
Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to investigate the interchain packing properties of the three polymers in solid thin films. As CB is a good solvent for the three polymers, here we use CB to make the solutions for preparing the three films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns are displayed in Fig. 2a and line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 2b and c. As shown in Fig. 2a, the three films show similar (100) and (010) reflections in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. For PBDB-T, PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT, the (100) reflection peaks are at 0.28, 0.26 and 0.22 Å−1, corresponding to the lamellar distance of 22.4, 24.2, and 28.6 Å, respectively. Compared with PBDB-T, the enlarged lamellar distance of PBDB-T-BO is ascribed to the enlarged alkyls, and for PBDB-BzT, its further enlarged lamellar distance is due to the extended conjugated side groups. These three polymers show the (010) reflections with an identical q value of 1.68 Å−1 in the OOP direction, corresponding to an interchain π–π stacking distance of 3.7 E. We also calculated the OOP π–π coherence lengths (CLs) of these polymers via the Scherrer equation. We found that PBDB-T and PBDB-T-BO exhibit the same CL of 2.5 nm, while that of PBDB-BzT is 2.7 nm, implying that the enlarged conjugated side groups have a slight positive effect on enhancing the interchain interaction of the polymers.

Photovoltaic properties and morphological characteristics
Photovoltaic properties of the three polymers were investigated by fabricating the PSCs with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active-layer/PFN-Br/Al. The device fabrication conditions used in this work can be referred to in the reported methods for PBDB-T:IT-M.8 All of the devices in this work are fabricated and characterized in parallel to minimize the uncertainties caused by device fabrication. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are demonstrated in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, including that of the best devices and the statistical data of twenty cells, are summarized in Table 1.

When CB was used as the main processing solvent, the PBDB-T:IT-M device showed the highest PCE among these three devices, which is 11.74% and agrees with the reported result,8 and the PBDB-T-BO:IT-M device yielded a low PCE of 7.87%, the lowest one in these three. When the devices were processed using THF, the PCE of the PBDB-T:IT-M device dropped to 6.41%, and the PBDB-T-BO:IT-M device yielded a moderate PCE of 10.78%. Interestingly, an outstanding PCE of 12.10% was recorded in the THF-processed PBDB-BzT:IT-M device, which is much higher than its counterpart processed using CB. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the above-mentioned devices are displayed in Fig. 3b, and the EQE results are coincident with the J–V measurements, i.e. the CB-processed PBDB-T:IT-M device and the THF-processed PBDB-BzT:IT-M device demonstrate similarly high EQE in the whole response region.
The phase separation morphologies of the photoactive layers in the devices are monitored by AFM. As shown in Fig. 4a, d and 4f, the three blend films that demonstrated over 10% PCEs show similar phase separation morphological features. In these three films, tiny fibril-like aggregations assemble to form larger domains, and their surfaces are quite smooth, with the surface roughness (Rq) values below 1.5 nm. For the other three blend films with lower PCEs, the surfaces are much rougher (see Fig. 4b, c and 4e). For the THF-processed PBDB-T:IT-M film, the strong phase separation should be ascribed to the low solubility of the polymers. For the PBDB-T-BO:IT-M film, we infer that the high solubilities of the polymer and IT-M in CB allow the formation of large size aggregations.

As the AFM results only give limited information, we further utilized resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) to get insights into phase separation morphologies of the blend films. Firstly, quantitative determination of root-mean-square composition variations that are related to the average domain purity and the spacing of composition correlations was carried out using transmission R-SoXS under high vacuum.39 Following our previously established procedures,40 2π/q of the predominant scattering peak represents the center-to-center domain spacing/correlations of the samples. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, it is observed that the domain spacing is anticorrelated with the Jsc in all three blends. In the reference system of PBDB-T:IT-M, THF processing shows a larger domain with a spacing of 89 nm compared with that (61 nm) of CB processing, while the domain spacing of the two new systems (PBDB-T-BO:IT-M and PBDB-BzT:IT-M) is significantly decreased when the processing solvent shifts from CB to THF. This observation is in line with our previous study on diketopyrrolopyrrole terpolymers.41 In addition, we note that the relative root-mean-square composition variations of these samples are quite comparable, as reflected by the largely unchanged integrated area (see Fig. S4†) of the scattering profile over the q range probed. It implies that the FF is less sensitive to the domain purity in this case, and other affecting factors, for instance, molecular packing or charge mobilities may play a key role in determining FF.42,43 From the 2D-GIWAXS patterns and 1D line-cut profiles (Fig. 5b–d and S5†) of the blended films in the six devices, we found that the intensities of the OOP (010) peak are clearly distinct for all blend systems when a different solvent is utilized. In general, for the three blends with over 10% PCEs, the (010) reflections in the OOP direction, which refers to the stacking effects of the materials, are much stronger than those in the other three blends. To make a quantitative comparison, the normalized area of the broad peak around 1.6–1.8 Å−1 is a good indicator of the OOP scattering intensities of π–π stacking. Higher intensity is beneficial for charge transport. By assigning the intensity of CB processed PBDB-T:IT-M blend as 1, the relative intensities were evaluated as 0.56, 0.47, 0.61, 0.66, and 1.27 for THF processed PBDB-T:IT-M, CB and THF processed PBDB-T-BO:IT-M, CB and THF processed PBDB-T-BzT:IT-M, respectively. This is quite consistent with the PCE change of these devices. Moreover, the face-on to edge-on ratio estimated from the relative populations of IP and OOP (010) peak (see Fig. 5b–d) shows the same trend. Together, THF processed PBDB-BzT:IT-M shows the highest π–π stacking intensity and face-on to edge-on ratio.

Charge recombination and transport
The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the blend films processed with CB or THF were measured using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method, the results are summarized in Table S1 and Fig. S6.† For the THF-processed devices, the PBDB-T:IT-M film exhibits the lowest μh (7.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (7.39 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) values compared with the PBDB-T-BO:IT-M and PBDB-BzT:IT-M blends. In contrast, the active layer of PBDB-BzT:IT-M exhibited the highest μh (1.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (1.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and the balanced μh and μe in THF (μh/μe = 1.38) effectively facilitate charge transport, which can explain the higher FF achieved from the device. To further understand the effect of carrier recombination of the three polymers processed with CB and THF on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, the curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) were also measured (Fig. S7†) and analyzed under illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The calculated Gmax values of the devices are summarized in Table S2.† It is shown that the PBDB-BzT:IT-M blend fabricated with THF had the highest Gmax value of 1.15 × 1028 m−3 s−1, indicating that the exciton generation is larger than the other two polymers processed with THF and CB counterparts. In addition, the values of the exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) can be obtained from the Jph/Jsatversus Veff curves (Fig. S7†), using the equation P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat. The PBDB-BzT processed with THF devices exhibited the highest P(E,T) value (89.2%). Therefore, we propose that this device had a high exciton generation rate and exciton dissociation efficiency.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully demonstrate the feasibility of converting a polymer photovoltaic material from toxic solvent processable into benign solvent processable without sacrificing its photovoltaic performance. Here, taking PBDB-T as the reference material, a representative polymer donor in highly efficient NF-PSCs, we successively enlarge its flexible side chains to improve its solubility in THF and its conjugated side groups to enhance its π–π stacking effect in solid film. According to the TD-Abs results, we find that the aggregation effect of PBDB-T in solution can be significantly weakened by enlarging the alkyl side chains and then recovered by extending the conjugated side groups. The significant change in the aggregation effect affects the phase separation morphologies and interchain packing properties of the polymer in the photoactive layers, which can be clearly monitored by AFM and R-SoXS measurements. As a result, through this two-step optimization in chemical structure, a new polymer PBDB-BzT, the one with a moderate aggregation effect in THF solution and strong π–π stacking intensity and face-on to edge-on ratio in solid film, can be obtained, which shows an outstanding PCE of 12.10% in the device, which is slightly higher than that of the reference device and also is the top value for the NF-PSCs processed using non-chlorinated and non-aromatic main solvents. In the further industrial applications, it is an inevitable trend to remove highly polluting solvents from device fabrication. As this work suggests an effective molecular design strategy to obtain high performance and benign-solvent-processable photovoltaic polymers, it provides important information to meet the requirements for future practical application.
