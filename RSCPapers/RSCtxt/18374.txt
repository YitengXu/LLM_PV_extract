    , Accepted 29th April 2020First published on 13th May 2020AbstractA new imidazole-2-thione based copper coordination polymer namely [Cu2(ebit)Br2]n (1) [ebit = 1,1′-(1,2-ethanediyl)bis(3-methyl-imidazole-2-thione)] was synthesized by a layer diffusion method, and [(C10H14N4S)CuBr3] (2) was a by-product of 1 and was obtained through redox processes between the ligand and metal ion. Polymer 1 was fully characterized by IR, CHNS, PL, TGA, PXRD and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In polymer 1, the copper atom is coordinated by two bridging bromides and two sulfur atoms from two ebit ligands with a distorted tetrahedral geometry to form a 2D honeycomb network, while in 2, the copper atom is coordinated only by three bromide atoms to create the anionic part of the compound and stabilized by the cationic moiety of the ligand. Both compounds have expanded into 3D networks through intermolecular interactions. The adsorption ability of polymer 1 toward four dyes namely Congo Red (CR), Aniline Blue (AB), Malachite Green (MG) and Victoria Blue (VB) was investigated and the results indicated that the title polymer has excellent adsorption capacity towards these dyes. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms and the adsorption mechanism were also analyzed. Polymer 1 was converted to nanospheres 1 by an ultrasonic method and used as a precursor for the preparation of CuO nanospheres. The obtained metal oxide was characterized by SEM, TEM, EDX, PXRD and IR. The results of photocatalytic and antimicrobial tests revealed that the CuO nanospheres showed good performances for the degradation of Rhodamine B and good antibacterial activity.
1. Introduction
Copper as a bioactive element with two main oxidation states (+1 and +2) plays a substantial role in the active sites of enzymes involved in oxygen transfer and redox-reaction processes.1,2 Considering the biological activity of copper, development of synthetic model systems for the above-mentioned enzymes has become a broad research field in bioinorganic chemistry.3–5 In recent years, research on the design and synthesis of copper(I) complexes in particular copper-based coordination polymers (CPs) by combining a suitable copper halide as a building block and an organic ligand as a linker has substantially increased.6–8
Imidazole-2-thione and its corresponding analogues are the main structural components of a large number of biomolecules and synthetic materials.9–15 So far, many mono-, di- and polynuclear copper and silver coordination compounds based on the imidazole-2-thione ligands and their derivatives have been reported in the literature.16–29 In addition, mono- and dinuclear compounds containing this type of ligand together with bulky co-ligands such as phosphines,30–41 2,2′-bipyridyl,42 tris(pyrazolyl)methane and borate43,44 and thiotungstates45,46 have likewise been synthesized. Bis(1-methyl-imidazole-2-thione)methane (BmmMe) as a bidentate semi-flexible imidazole-2-thione based ligand with a methylene group in its spacer moiety which connects the two imidazole-2-thione rings can form mono-, di- and polynuclear compounds of copper and silver metals which have been reported by Brumaghim,47 Gardinier48 and Owen.49 The use of a bulky benzyl group instead of methyl in BmmMe creates mono- and polynuclear copper compounds.49 One of the great features of this type of ligand is its ability to bridge two metal centers (μ2-S) or chelate to one metal ion through one of its sulfur donors. Conversion of the bis(1-methyl-imidazole-2-thione)methane to bis(1-methyl-imidazole-2-thione)borate chelate ligand enabled the formation of eight-membered chelate rings and in turn the construction of trinuclear copper compounds and mononuclear silver compounds with triphenylphosphine as a co-ligand.50
The 1,1′-(1,2-ethanediyl)bis(3-methyl-imidazole-2-thione) (ebit) ligand with two methylene groups between the two 2-thione rings tends to connect to soft metals through its exocyclic sulfur atoms. Information on its coordination chemistry is limited to iridium(III), rhodium(III) and iron(II) with half-sandwich and polymeric structures.51,52 It is rather surprising that so far only one report on a copper(I) complex based on the ebit ligand has been reported in the literature,47 but there is no structural characterization of polymeric copper(I) halide complexes with this ligand. We have recently reported copper and silver coordination polymers by increasing the flexibility and the length of the spacer in bidentate imidazole-2-thione based ligands to three [L = 1,3-bis(1-methylthioimidazolyl)propane], four [bbit = 1,1-(butane-1,4-diyl)bis(3-methylimidazole-2-thione)], five [L = 1,1′-(1,5-pentadienyl)bis-(1,3-dihydro-3-methyl-1H-imidazole-2-thione)] and six [L6 = 1,1′-(hexane-1,6-diyl)bis-(3-methylimidazole-2-thione)] methylene groups between the imidazole-2-thione rings and created various coordination polymers with different coordination modes.53–57
Gimeno et al.58 also synthesized the dinuclear structures of [Ag2(OTf)2(PPh3)2(bbit)], [Ag2(OTf)2(bbit)] and [Cu2(bbit)2](PF6)2 using the chelating bbit ligand. Replacement of hard N-donor pyrazole rings in poly(pyrazolyl)borate ligands by soft S-donor N-substituted-imidazole-2-thione rings led to the formation of tridentate S3-donor ligands of poly(imidazole-2-thione)borates and their derivatives as soft scorpionate ligands. A wide range of copper and silver coordination complexes of these ligands were formed with different coordination modes59,60 with phosphine as a co-ligand.61–67 To the best of our knowledge, the copper and silver compounds constructed from the imidazole-2-thione ligands and their derivatives have great potential for antibacterial,29,34,35,37,53,55–57,68 antioxidant,69 antitumor,70,71 catalytic,72–76 luminescence77 and dye adsorption applications.57
The release of toxic and hazardous organic dyes from diverse industries into the water environment has created a global problem because of their high toxicity to humans and animals.78–80 Therefore, the removal of these pollutants from wastewater is a very important issue. There are various methods for the removal of these dyes but among them, the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes has received considerable attention due to important environmental aspects.81–84 Recent studies have focused on the development of strategies for the design and synthesis of materials like CPs/MOFs and metal oxide micro/nanostructures to remove these industrial dyes by appropriate methods.85–91 CuO as a p-type semiconductor, due to its abundance in Nature, nontoxicity, stability, low production cost, and excellent photoelectrochemical properties, is used as an active electrode material for dye photodegradation, Li-ion batteries, magnetic storage media, heterogeneous catalysis, gas sensors and solar cells.92–96 CPs not only have attractive tunable properties and potential applications,97–102 but also have great potential to be used as precursors for conversion to metal oxides. So far, a few studies have been reported for the synthesis of CuO nanostructures derived from nano-CPs/MOFs.95,103–109
In the present work, we have synthesized a new 2D supramolecular coordination polymer with a flexible sulfur donor ebit ligand. The title compound has been fully characterized by X-ray crystallography, infrared spectroscopy (IR), elemental analysis (CHN), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Considering the above-mentioned points for cleaning of wastewater contaminated with organic dyes, we have used the title 2D polymer as an adsorbent for the adsorption of dye pollutants and investigated its adsorption kinetics and isotherms and the adsorption mechanism. In addition, the considered polymer has been converted to its nano form by an ultrasonic method and applied as a precursor for the synthesis of CuO nanospheres to study their photodegradation and antibacterial performances. As far as we know, the title imidazole-2-thione based copper coordination polymer is the first example that we have converted to CuO nanospheres.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
All experiments were carried out in air. Starting materials were of reagent grade and used as commercially obtained without further purification. The 1,1′-(1,2-ethanediyl)-bis-(3-methyl-imidazole-2-thione) ligand (ebit) was prepared by the reaction of 1,1′-(1,2-ethanediyl)-bis-(3-methyl-imidazolium)dibromide with sulfur powder in the presence of the K2CO3 base in methanol as a solvent.51,110
2.2. Preparation of single crystals of [Cu2(ebit)Br2]n (1) and [(C10H14N4S)(CuBr3)] (2)
To a solution of the ebit ligand (50 mg, 0.019 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was added a solution of the CuBr salt (55 mg, 0.038 mmol) in acetonitrile (10 mL). The mixture was stirred for 2h at room temperature. The resulting white precipitate was filtered off and washed with acetonitrile and dichloromethane (2 × 5 mL) and then dried in a vacuum. To obtain suitable crystals for X-ray diffraction, to a solution of the ebit ligand (20 mg, 0.07 mmol) in 5 mL of dichloromethane (placed in a glass tube of approximately 1 cm diameter), a mixture of CH3CN/CH2Cl2 (1:1, 2 mL) was slowly added to form a diphasic system. A solution of CuBr (22 mg, 0.15 mmol) in 5 mL of acetonitrile was then added on the top layer in the tube without mixing the ligand and salt solutions. The tube was covered and kept at room temperature for a week to obtain grey crystals of 1 as a main product and 2 as a by-product in the tube side. The crystals were filtered off and dried in air. Yield: 80 mg (77% based on Cu). Dec. point: 250 °C. Anal. calcd (%) for Cu2Br2C10H14N4S2: C 22.19; H 2.61; N 10.35 S 11.85; anal. found C 21.82; H 2.34; N 9.98; S 12.14.

2.3. Physical measurements
Infrared spectra (4000–400 cm−1) were recorded as KBr disks with a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrometer. Elemental analyses for C, H, N, and S were implemented on a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1120 CHNS analyser. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded on a Philips PW1730 diffractometer (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54056 Å) in the 2θ range 10–50°. TGA was performed using a TA Q600 instrument under flowing air with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 in the temperature range of 30–1300 °C. Fluorescence spectra of the solid samples were recorded on a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The morphology and size of the products were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN, MIRA III) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips, CM120). The chemical composition of the sample was determined using a MIRA III energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) equipped with a SAMx detector.
2.4. X-ray crystallography
X-ray intensity data were measured on a Bruker D8 Venture TXS system equipped with a multilayer mirror monochromator and a Mo Kα rotating anode X-ray tube (λ = 0.71073 Å). The frames were integrated with the Bruker SAINT software package.111 Data were corrected for absorption effects using a multi-scan method (SADABS).112 The structures were solved with the Bruker SHELXTL Software Package113 and refined using SHELXL.114 All hydrogen atoms were calculated in ideal geometry riding on their parent atoms. The molecular structure plots were prepared using Mercury software.115
2.5. Dye adsorption by 1
Two cationic [Malachite Green (MG) and Victoria Blue (VB)] and two anionic [Congo Red (CR) and Aniline Blue (AB)] dyes were selected. The adsorption experiments of pollutants by polymer 1 were carried out using a batch method. 50 mg of the as-synthesized powder of 1 was immersed in 10 mL of aqueous solutions of different dyes with a selected initial concentration of 100 mg L−1 separately at room temperature. The above mixture was stirred for 120 min and then centrifuged. The concentration of the dye residue in the supernatant was monitored using a UV-Vis spectrometer and the solid adsorbent was washed with distilled water (2 × 5 mL) and then oven-dried. The absorbance before and after the adsorption of the dye was measured. The percent adsorption of each dye and the dye removal efficiency of the Cu(I) coordination polymer was calculated using eqn (1). (1)where C0 and Cf represent the initial and final (after adsorption) dye concentrations in aqueous solution, respectively. All tests were performed in duplicate at room temperature.
2.6 Ultrasound-assisted synthesis of nanospheres 1
Nanospheres of polymer 1 (nanospheres 1) were prepared from CuBr and the ebit ligand with a metal/ligand molar ratio of 2:1 by sonication in an ultrasonic bath at 40 °C for 3 h under atmospheric pressure. At the beginning, the metal salt and ligand were separately dissolved in appropriate solvents and then exposed to ultrasonic waves for 45 min. The ultrasonicated Cu(I) solution in acetonitrile was then added to the ultrasonicated ebit solution in dichloromethane by a titration method at ultrasound power for 180 min. The resulting powder was washed with acetonitrile and dichloromethane (3 × 5 mL) and isolated by centrifugation. The white supernatant was decanted and oven-dried. The morphology and particle size of this nanopolymer were investigated using SEM and TEM analyses. To obtain the CuO nanospheres, nanospheres 1 were calcined at above 700 °C for 15 min in air.
2.7. Photocatalytic activity of CuO nanospheres
The photodegradation reaction of the Rhodamine B (RhB) organic dye was performed by adding 10 mg of the CuO nanospheres as a catalyst into a 10 mL aqueous solution of 10 mg L−1 RhB together with 25 μL of hydrogen peroxide solution (H2O2, 30 wt%) in a beaker at room temperature. Before irradiation starts, the resulting mixture was stirred in the dark at room temperature for 15 min to establish the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the nanocatalyst and dye molecules. The photocatalytic experiment was then started by visible light irradiation using a 400 W Osram lamp with 400 < λ < 700 nm. The samples were collected at considered times with intervals of 30 min and monitored using a Photonix Ar2015 model spectrophotometer. For comparison, this test was repeated for a blank solution, a H2O2/blank solution, as-synthesized CuO nanospheres/blank solution and a commercial CuO/H2O2/blank solution.
2.8. Antibacterial activity of CuO nanospheres
The antibacterial activity of the synthesized CuO nanospheres was evaluated by determining the half minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and the inhibitory concentration (IC100) using the MTT (3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide) colorimetric assay. The oxidoreductase enzymes of viable bacterial cells reduce yellow-colored MTT to purple-colored formazan. The stock solution of CuO was prepared in Müeller Hinton broth (MHB) and then sonicated for 15 min to ensure complete dispersion. The stock solution was subjected to two-fold dilution to produce concentrations ranging from 50 mg mL−1 to 0.195 mg mL−1. Subsequently, 100 μL of each dilution was poured into a microtitration plate, and 5 μL of 0.5 standard (105 CFUs mL−1) concentration of bacteria was inoculated in each well. Two Gram-negative bacteria of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two Gram-positive bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were used for assessing the antibacterial activity of the CuO nanospheres. The control wells are as follows: one well containing only the CuO nanospheres, another containing the bacteria without the nanospheres, and another containing MHB without CuO or bacteria. Following incubation at 37 °C for 18 h, 50 μL of MTT solution (2 mg mL−1) was added into each well, and the plate was incubated for 4 h. Subsequently, 100 μL of isopropanol containing 5% HCl (mol L−1) was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min. The absorbances of the solutions in the wells were recorded using an ELISA Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad; USA) at a wavelength of 570 nm.
3. Results and discussion
Polymer 1 was obtained by the reaction of the ebit ligand and the CuBr salt via a layer diffusion method in acetonitrile/dichloromethane solutions (Scheme 1). After 4 days, two types of products were created, 1 as the main product and 2 as the by-product that were similar in appearance and could not be distinguished from each other. Polymer 1 was obtained by the direct reaction between the reactants, while compound 2 was produced through redox processes between the ligand and metal ion. Polymer 1 is stable in air and moisture and can be stored in a desiccator for one month. It was used as an adsorbent for the removal of organic pollutants and as a template for synthesis of CuO nanospheres. The IR spectrum of the free ebit ligand displayed a medium CS stretching vibration at about 516 cm−1 which is attributed to the CS moiety of the imidazole-2-thione rings. This bond is red shifted to 508 cm−1 for polymer 1. This indicates that the title ligand is coordinated to the copper centers via its exocyclic sulfur atoms.46,116 In order to emphasize the phase purity, the X-ray powder diffraction experiment was carried out for polymer 1 in which the experimental spectrum was matched with its simulated data (Fig. S1, ESI†). The room temperature solid state emission spectra of the ebit ligand and its Cu(I) polymer are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The emission spectrum of the free ebit ligand exhibits a broad emission of a band centered at 320 nm (λex = 280 nm) originating from the electronic transitions of the CS and imidazoline ring moieties of the ligand. In the case of 1 this band is red-shifted to 367 nm. Due to the coordination of the ebit ligand to the metal center through the CS bond, the π character of this bond decreased and hence the π → π* transitions were shifted to a lower energy.

3.1 Crystal structure of polymer 1
The ORTEP atomic numbering scheme for a unit of polymer 1 is shown in Fig. 1a. The crystallographic analysis reveals that this compound crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with the space group P21/c and Z = 2 (Table 1). It displays a two-dimensional network structure in which each repeating unit is constructed from two CuBr units and one bridging ebit ligand as illustrated in Fig. 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are included in Table S1 (ESI†). The Cu1 atom with a CuS2Br2 donor set and τ4 = 0.96 adopts a slightly distorted tetrahedral geometry with bond angles ranging from 102.45(3) to 113.35(4)°. On the basis of Yang et al. analysis,117 the τ4 value varies from zero to 1.00, with τ4 = 0 corresponding to a perfect square planar geometry and τ4 = 1 corresponding to an ideal tetrahedral environment. In polymer 1, the central atom is coordinated by two sulfur atoms from two μ-ebit ligands with a Cu–S average bond distance of 2.397 Å and two bridging bromide atoms. The Cu–Br bond lengths in the centrosymmetric [Cu(μ-Br)2Cu] rhomboids are quite similar [2.530(8) and 2.534(8) Å] with a Cu–Br–Cu angle of 77.55°. This compound shows a 2D honeycomb network along the bc-plane in which the zigzag (CuBr)2 units are linked by the bridging ebit ligands (Fig. 2). The bond distances in polymer 1 are comparable with the corresponding ones reported for related four-coordinated copper structures with a CuS2Br2 core structure such as [{Cu(μ2-Br)2Cu}(μ-PhCH2SCH2CCCH2SCH2Ph2)2] [Cu–S1 = 2.321 Å, Cu–S2 = 2.991 Å, Cu–Br = 2.458 Å, Cu–Br# = 2.528 Å],118 [Cu(μ2-Br)2Cu(L5)2]n [Cu–S1 = 2.306 Å, Cu–S2 = 2.316 Å, Cu–Br = 2.436 Å, Cu–Br# = 2.500 Å],119 [Cu3{MeSi(CH2SMe)3}2Br3] [Cu2–S4 = 2.314 Å, Cu2–S5 = 2.297 Å, Cu2–Br2 = 2.563 Å, Cu2–Br2′ = 2.425 Å],120 [Cu2Br2(L)2][L = dibenzo-O2S2] [Cu–S1 = 2.311 Å, Cu–S2 = 2.336 Å, Cu–Br1 = 2.488 Å, Cu–Br1A = 2.434 Å]121 and so on.17,122–125 Alternatively, 1 consists of a neutral corrugated sheet built up from fused 12-membered non-planar centrosymmetric macrometallocycles (Fig. 2).

 Fig. 2  A view of the 2D structure of 1 along the bc-plane illustrating the intramolecular interactions. 
Each of the 12-membered macrometallocycles contain six copper atoms, four bridging bromide atoms and four sulfur atoms from the bridging ebit ligands. In addition, in each of the macrocycles, an ebit ligand has divided it into two identical parts and the imidazole-2-thione rings of the ligand are anti relative to each other with a dihedral angle of zero. A C–S bond distance of 1.709(4) Å reveals that it has some double bond character after coordination to the metal centres.110 There is one Cu⋯Cu contact in the honeycomb network (Cu1⋯Cu1 = 3.171 Å) which is longer than the sum of the van der Waals radii of two Cu atoms (2.8 Å) and is closer to those in [{Cu(μ2-Br)2Cu}{μ-p-TolS(CH2)5STol-p}2]n (3.0345(10) Å),125 [{Cu(μ2-Br)2Cu}2{L-CyS(CH2)4SCy}2]n (3.215 Å),119 [{Cu(μ2-Br)2Cu}(μ-PhCH2SCH2CCCH2SCH2Ph2)2] (3.007 Å)118 and [{Cu(μ2-Br)2Cu}-(MeCN)2(η1-L6)2] [L6 = bis(o-tolylthio)-methane] (3.066 Å)119 compounds. The shortest intra- and interchain S⋯S distances are 3.890 and 9.574 Å, respectively. Therefore, the S⋯S interactions are not strong in this polymer. In addition, there are no π⋯π stacking interactions between the imidazole-2-thione rings because the shortest intra- and interpolymer π⋯π stacking distances are 5.657 and 4.217 Å, respectively. A further inspection of the crystal structure reveals that intramolecular hydrogen bonds can be detected between the methylene protons of the spacer group and the bromide atoms of the (CuBr)2 moiety and the sulfur atoms of the other ebit ligands with H⋯Br and H⋯S bond distances of 3.095 and 2.872 Å, respectively, in the 2D honeycomb network structure (Fig. 2).
Furthermore, the neighboring 2D chains are cross-linked through the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the bromide atom and hydrogen of the heterocyclic rings of the ligand with an H⋯Br distance of 3.000 Å in the crystallographic ab-plane to form a 3D non-covalent bond network with AA⋯ sequences (Fig. 3).

3.2 Crystal structure of compound 2
The title compound was obtained as a by-product during the preparation of polymer 1via a proposed redox mechanism according to eqn (2)–(5). In the first step, one of the CS bonds of the ebit ligand was cleaved by removing the sulfur atom. The other CS bond was connected to the desulfurized carbon to form a 7-membered ring with C–S bond distances of 1.757(3) and 1.744(3) Å. Thus, the molecule was converted to a cationic species which was neutralized by the [CuBr3]2− anion formed according to eqn (2)–(5). The sulfide (S2−) anion counterbalances Cu2+ generated via an auto-oxidation reaction shown in eqn (3). The cleavage of the C–S bond in eqn (2) in the presence of copper halides is widely supported by published papers in the field of petroleum chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry and biological systems.68,126–130 The molecular structure of 2 and its ORTEP diagram are depicted in Fig. 4a. Similar to polymer 1, this compound crystallizes in the monoclinic system with the space group P21/c and Z = 4 (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of 2 consists of the [C10H14N4S]2+ cation and the [CuBr3]2− anion. There are no significant interactions among the components other than normal coulombic and van der Waals forces. In this structure, the discrete [CuBr3]2− species are stabilized by the large [C10H14N4S]2+ cations, which are placed well apart from each other, thus preventing the formation of a polymeric structure. (2) 2CuBr → Cu + Cu2+ + 2Br−(3) Cu2+ + S2− → CuS(4) CuBr + 2Br− → CuBr32−(5)

In the cationic moiety of this structure, the planar five-membered rings are aromatic. In each of them, there is a lone pair electron on one of the nitrogen atoms and two double bonds (6 pi-electrons). Consequently, in each of the rings there is one nitrogen having four bonds with a positive charge. Each of the two nitrogen atoms of a ring can be neutral and can carry a lone pair or can be charged +1. There is no positive charge on the sulfur or carbon atom. Therefore, the ligand possesses two positive charges and its C–S bonds are single bonds. In the anionic moiety, the copper atom is coordinated by three bromide atoms with Cu–Br bond distances of 2.351(5), 2.378(5) and 2.389(5) Å which are comparable with reported values for CuBr32− in the previous works.131–133 The copper atom in the [CuBr3]2− anion as in [PPh3-Me]2[CuBr3]134 has a distorted planar triangular geometry with C2v local symmetry and bond angles varying from 117.10(2) to 123.30(2)°. However, the distortion from the ideal D3h trigonal planar symmetry is not significant. The structural analysis of compound 2 shows that there are intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the bromide atoms of the anion moiety and the hydrogen atoms of cation component to form a 3D non-covalent network along the crystallographic axes (Fig. 4b).
3.3 Adsorption of dye molecules by coordination polymer 1
MOFs with tunable structures and unique properties are good candidates for the elimination of dyes.135 Although porous 3D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely investigated for application in the adsorption of dyes, coordination polymers with low-dimensional structures which exhibit high adsorption capacity for such pollutants have been rarely reported.136 In this work, the absorption ability of polymer 1 in aqueous solutions of the considered dyes was investigated. The adsorption of dye solutions by polymer 1 was monitored via a camera. As demonstrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†), after dye adsorption by the adsorbent, the color of the solutions changed from dark to pale and simultaneously the color of the solid samples varied from colorless to colored. The adsorption ability of 1 toward these dyes was followed by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 5). The considered dyes show detectable absorption peaks at 584 nm for AB, 498 nm for CR, 617 nm for MG and 614 nm for VB. As shown in Fig. 5, for all organic dyes with increase in time from 0 to 120 min, the intensity of these peaks decreased. This indicates that polymer 1 is able to efficiently adsorb the considered anionic and cationic dyes from wastewater, but the adsorption of the MG dye by 1 was lower than that of the other mentioned dyes. On the basis of the obtained data from UV-Vis spectroscopy, the curves of absorption versus time are drawn and displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†). In general, the highest adsorption occurs during the initial time period and then gradually the intensity of the peaks decreased with increasing time up to 120 min. In the first 5 minutes, polymer 1 adsorbs 75.5% of AB, 50.7% of CR and 48.7% of VB dyes, while in this period of time only 13.7% of the MG dye was adsorbed by the adsorbent (Fig. 5 and Fig. S3, ESI†). The adsorption process was completed within 120 min. Finally, the colors of the solutions of the AB and CR dyes completely fade within two hours. At the same time, about 85.42% of the solution of the VB dye was adsorbed and for MG only 43.4% adsorption occurred (Fig. S2, ESI†). In order to understand the adsorption mechanism, we have recorded the room temperature solid-state photoluminescence spectra of polymer 1 before and after the adsorption of dye molecules (Fig. S4, ESI†). The adsorption of dye solutions by the adsorbent caused a clear decrease of the emission intensity which can be attributed to the host–guest photoinduced electron transfer effect. The substantial decline of the peak can be considered as a good indication of the adsorption of the dyes by this adsorbent and gives valid evidence for the fluorescence quenching of polymer 1 by the guest molecules. Therefore, the adsorption of the dye molecules by the adsorbent can be attributed to the effect of π⋯π stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of the dye compound and the aromatic components in the considered polymer as well as hydrogen bonds between the adsorbent and adsorbate. The framework integrity and crystallinity of dyes@polymer 1 were confirmed by the PXRD patterns and IR spectra that are compiled in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†). After dye adsorption by polymer 1, no significant change in the IR spectra was detected. This indicates that the host network crystallinity remains intact (Fig. S5, ESI†). In addition, the intensity and width of the peaks in the PXRD patterns were slightly changed but, all the peaks were located in the same 2θ position as the parent compound (Fig. S6, ESI†). This is a good signal showing that the network crystallinity of the polymer after the adsorption of the selected dyes (similar to IR results) was unchanged.

3.4 Adsorption kinetics
To explore the adsorption mechanism for the potential rate controlling steps involved in the adsorption of the four considered dyes by the Cu-based polymer and to verify the experimental results, pseudo-first order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticle diffusion and Elovich models defined by eqn (6)–(9),137–139 respectively, were implemented. (6) (7) (8) (9)where qe and qt are the amount of dyes adsorbed by the adsorbent at the equilibrium time and the adsorption time (mmol g−1) respectively, t is the adsorption time, k1, k2 and kdif are the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order and diffusion constants (min−1) and ae and be are the initial adsorption rate and Elovich constant, respectively. The best-fit model for each of the dyes was selected based on the linear regression correlation coefficient values (R2). Plots of the obtained experimental data of the four considered dyes fitted to the selected adsorption models are displayed in Fig. 6 and Fig. S7–S10 (ESI†) and a summary of the models and constants along with the coefficients of determination for the linear regression plots of the considered dyes is provided in Table 2 and Table S2 (ESI†). According to the obtained results, for the three dyes namely AB, VB and MG, the coefficients for the pseudo second-order equation were higher than those for the other equations (0.964, 0.954 and 0.999, respectively) (Table 2). The best correlation for the system provided by the pseudo-second-order model suggests that chemisorption may be the rate limiting step for the sorption of AB, VB and MG by the title Cu-based polymer.140 It is more probable that the adsorption process can occur via electrostatic forces between the adsorbent and adsorbate. For the CR dye, the adsorption mechanism follows the Elovich kinetic model with a linear regression correlation coefficient of 0.961.

3.5 Adsorption isotherms
Analysis of the adsorption isotherm has a substantial role in the description of the phenomenon of the interaction between a liquid phase and a solid adsorbent surface. For this purpose, different adsorption theories including Freundlich, Temkin, and Langmuir were used to explain the data for dye adsorption applications. The regression coefficients (R2) of the linearized isotherm data for dye@polymer 1 at room temperature are given in Table 3 and Table S3 (ESI†) and the best-fit isotherm model for each of the dyes is drawn in Fig. 7. According to the obtained results, the CR dye shows good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm with a reasonable R2 value of 0.969 (Fig. 7 and Fig. S11, ESI†). The Langmuir isotherm shows monolayer adsorption and is defined by eqn (10).141 (10)

 Fig. 7  The best-fit adsorption isotherm model of (a) Langmuir for CR, (b) Freundlich for MG, and (c) and (d) Temkin for AB and VB dyes. 
The model parameters were obtained from the linear relationship between Ce/qe and Ce (Table 3). The calculated qm and kl values were 20.960 (mmol g−1) and 2.252, respectively. One of the major characteristics of this model is the dimensionless separation factor, , which points out whether the adsorption process is favorable (0 < RL < 1), unfavorable (RL > 1), linear (RL = 1) or irreversible (RL = 0).142 The values of the separation factor (RL) were found to be in the range of 0–1 for all concentrations of the CR dye and decreased with the increasing initial concentration which indicates a favorable adsorption at lower concentrations.
For the MG dye, the most linear regression correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.955) is related to the Freundlich isotherm model (Fig. 7 and Fig. S12, ESI†) which was explained by eqn (11)143 and indicates a multilayer adsorption process. (11)where Kf and n are the Freundlich adsorption isotherm constants. Kf is an indication of the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and n is a measure of the deviation from the linearity of the adsorption and is used to determine the type of adsorption. It is suggested that if n is equal to unity, the adsorption is linear. Furthermore, n below unity indicates that adsorption is favorable,144 and n close to unity means a more uniform adsorption.145 On the basis of the obtained data from the drawn curve, Kf and n values were found to be 0.233 and 0.753, respectively (Table 3). For the other two dyes namely AB and VB, the highest values of R2 were associated with the Temkin isotherm model (Fig. 7 and Fig. S13, S14, ESI†). The Temkin isotherm is used to study the heat of adsorption and adsorbate–adsorbent interactions on the adsorbent surface.146Eqn (12) shows the linear form of this isotherm. qe = B1lnkt + B1lnCe(12)where B1 is the Temkin adsorption constant and Kt is the equilibrium binding constant (dm3 mg−1). The obtained values of B1 and Kt from linear curves for the AB dye were −12.645 and 0.058 and for the VB dye were −49.603 and 0.048, respectively (Table 3).
3.6 Polymer 1 and CuO nanospheres
As pointed out in the introduction, CuO is a valuable semiconductor material and so far various synthesis techniques like hydrothermal,147 sol–gel148 and so on149–151 have been applied for its preparation. In some cases, these methods require harsh preparation conditions and need sophisticated equipment. Therefore, it is reasonable to use a simple and low-cost method such as the solid state calcination of CPs/MOFs to prepare copper oxides with high performances.103,104,106 On the other hand, it is well known that nanostructures enhance the properties of materials with respect to the bulk due to their high specific surface area and size effects.86,152 The size requirement cannot be frequently achieved by using a suitable synthetic procedure such as hydrothermal and solvothermal methods or a slow diffusion approach. The conventional recipes have some limitations in scaling up. Consequently, alternative approaches like microwave, sonochemical and electrochemical methods were successfully implemented. In this work, we have successfully synthesized nanospheres from polymer 1 (nanospheres 1) by an ultrasonic method and used them as a precursor for the preparation of CuO nanospheres. The morphology and size of the products were investigated by SEM and TEM analyses. Fig. 8a and b show the SEM images of nanospheres 1 at two different resolutions.
 Fig. 8  The SEM images of nanospheres 1 (a and b) and CuO nanospheres (c and d) at two different magnifications. 
Coordination self-assembly and crystal structure would play an important role in the formation of highly ordered coordination polymeric nanostructures.153,154 The crystal structure data revealed that polymer 1 has a two-dimensional sheet structure which may confirm the formation of 2D sheets shown in the SEM images with a 5 μm scale. A more accurate analysis of the SEM images shows that these sheets are formed by aggregated nanospheres (Fig. 8b). The TEM observations were also confirmed by the results of SEM. The nanospheres with diameters in the range of 2.05 to 10.30 nm can be easily found (Fig. 10a). The thermal stability of polymer 1 was investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). As depicted in Fig. 9, this polymer is stable up to 120 °C and the non-covalent bonds start to break down converting its structure from 3D to 2D in the temperature range of 120 to 250 °C. The first weight loss between 250 to 410 °C was attributed to the elimination of one ebit from the 12-membered macrometallocycle (Scheme 1) (ca. 21%). The decomposition of the remaining organic ligand and the escape of four bromide atoms from the rhomboid rings took place at 410–700 °C as a second step (ca. 47%). Beyond this temperature, there are no noticeable thermal events which clearly indicates that the formation of CuO takes place above 700 °C. Therefore, based on the TGA results, nanospheres 1 were pyrolyzed at this range of temperature for 15 min to produce black crystalline CuO nanospheres as a final product. The morphology of the obtained CuO from the calcined nanospheres was perused by SEM (Fig. 8c and d) and TEM analyses (Fig. 10b). As shown in the SEM images, the CuO nanostructures have a sphere-like morphology in which the agglomerated spheres can be clearly seen. These particles preserved the initial morphology of their polymeric precursor. To get further evidence to confirm the structure of the CuO nanospheres, TEM analysis was also carried out. Fig. 10b shows the TEM image of the CuO nanospheres which is in line with our SEM results. On the basis of the TEM analysis, the size of the nanospheres is in the range of 3–60 nm. The structural analysis of the CuO nanospheres was performed by PXRD, EDX and IR. Fig. 11a shows the PXRD pattern of CuO derived from nanospheres 1. All observed reflections were indexed according to the monoclinic phase with the C2/c space group and the lattice parameters a = 4.69, b = 3.42, c = 5.131 and β = 99.54 (JCPDS Card No. 01.089.5898). The extra peaks corresponding to the impurities like Cu, Cu2O and Cu(OH)2 were not observed which indicates its phase purity and the complete transformation of the precursor to the CuO nanospheres.

The high intensity of the peaks suggests its good crystalline nature. The chemical composition of the nanospheres was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and the spectrum is shown in Fig. 11b, which reveals that the nanospheres are only composed of Cu and O with a stoichiometry ratio of 1:1. This indicates that the as-synthesized CuO has a pure chemical formula. For more analysis of the product, the IR spectrum was used which is consistent with the XRD and EDX results. As shown in Fig. 12a, the strong peaks at 530 and 487 cm−1 correspond to the Bu and Au modes of the CuO monoclinic phase, respectively.155 The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the as-synthesized CuO was used to calculate its band gap (Fig. 12b).

The appeared sharp peak at 230 nm was obviously blue-shifted corresponding to the reported value by Hong et al.149 at 360 nm. Eqn (13) was applied for the determination of the band gap of CuO nanospheres where α is the absorption coefficient, A is the energy independent constant and n = 1/2 applies for a direct transition semiconductor and n = 2 for an indirect transition semiconductor. When the straight portion of the (αhν) 2versus hν plot is extrapolated to the point α = 0, the band gap energy (Eg) was obtained indirectly, the calculated value of which was found to be 2.14 eV. This is higher than the band gap value of the bulk CuO (1.2 eV) which can be attributed to the well-known quantum confinement effect resulting from the nanosized crystals.156 (13)
3.7 Photocatalytic properties
The application of semiconductors as heterogeneous photocatalysts to eliminate various pollutants from aqueous systems has gained significant attention in the last decade.157,158 There are various photocatalyst systems which can be generally classified as oxides,159–162 sulfides163,164 and halides.165,166 So far, several research works have reported on the photocatalytic activity of cupric oxide.147,167,168 To evaluate the capability of the CuO nanospheres to eliminate pollutants from wastewater, we have investigated the degradation of the RhB dye by using the as-synthesized CuO as a catalyst. RhB is used as a model organic dye. It is the most important xanthene dye and a pollutant found in the textile wastewater. So, the photodegradation of RhB is important with regard to the purification of dye effluents. RhB in the aqueous solution shows a sharp absorption peak at 553 nm, and hence this characteristic absorption peak was chosen to monitor the photocatalytic degradation process. The photocatalytic activity of our obtained CuO nanospheres in the degradation of the RhB pollutant was evaluated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. When CuO in the RhB aqueous solution is exposed to UV-Vis light irradiation, it can easily produce electron–hole pairs. The holes are trapped by the obtained electrons from the excited RhB molecules and the electrons are scavenged by the adsorbed oxide species to produce active radicals. RhB is then degraded directly by the photogenerated oxidants. During this process, hydrogen peroxide helps to produce hydroxyl radicals for destroying the organic pollutant. Fig. 13c shows the plots of the photodegradation intensity of the RhB dye (monitored at 553 nm) as a function of irradiation time for the blank (just the photolysis of RhB) and with the addition of the as-synthesized CuO nanospheres. It can be seen that after 210 min of visible light irradiation in the absence of any CuO nanospheres, the absorption peak intensity slightly decreased and only about 14% of the RhB solution was degraded (Fig. 13c and Fig. S15a, ESI†). After using the as-synthesized CuO nanospheres as a catalyst, the absorption peak intensity also did not show an obvious decrease and the RhB photodegradation percentage was 16% (Fig. 13c and Fig. S15b, ESI†). As seen in Fig. 13c and Fig. S15c (ESI†), it can be clearly observed that although some degradation is seen with H2O2 alone, it has a very weak activity for the decolorization of the RhB aqueous solution and the degradation rate is quite low (21% in 210 min). Considering these results, we have used a photocatalytic system of the CuO nanospheres with the assistance of H2O2 in the RhB solution. When both CuO and H2O2 were introduced into the RhB solution, photocatalytic degradation is greatly improved. During the photocatalytic process, we observed that the color of the solution gradually weakened and the intensity of the absorption peaks gradually diminished with increasing irradiation time from 0 to 210 min (Fig. 13a and b). As shown in Fig. 13c, after a certain time period, 97% degradation is observable, which shows the excellent photocatalytic activity of the CuO nanospheres for the decomposition of RhB. The best kinetic model for this process was Elovich with a linear regression correlation coefficient value of 0.93 (Fig. S16 and Table S4, ESI†).
 Fig. 13  (a) The UV-Vis adsorption spectra of RhB as a function of irradiation time using the CuO nanospheres with the addition H2O2, (b) color change of the RhB solution after 210 min, and (c) a plot of the photodegradation extent of RhB molecules (monitored at 544 nm) as a function of irradiation time for the blank, H2O2, as-synthesized CuO, commercial and as-synthesized CuO with the addition of H2O2. 
For comparison, we have compared the photocatalytic degradation ability of commercial CuO toward the RhB dye (Fig. S15d, ESI†). The obtained data confirmed that the as-synthesized CuO nanospheres have better potential than the commercial one due to their size differences (Fig. 13c). The SEM image of commercial CuO is shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†).
3.8 Antimicrobial activity
The application of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) has been gradually increased in the light of their low cost and biological properties which are similar to those of Ag and Au NPs.169 The measurement of the glucose level is very important for the diagnosis of diabetics. Thus, a non-enzymatic glucose nano-sensor based on the Cu NPs was synthesized for this purpose.170 In addition, the Cu and Ag NPs have been used as anti-bacterial agents due to their large surface area, small size and crystalline structural characteristics.171,172 The mentioned nanoparticle materials with good stability and bioactivity are suitable for application in disinfectant and coating formulations.173 Therefore, nano-coatings with Cu or Ag NPs enables them to act as inhibitory agents against the growth of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial agents such as E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.173 Another biological application of the Cu and Ag NPs is their use in wound healing in particular for the treatment of phosphorus burns. The Cu NPs stimulate interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, initiation of tissue healing, and moderation of oxidative damage in tissues.169
In the present study, we examined the antibacterial activity of the CuO nanospheres and their precursor. In contrast to the CuO nanospheres, their precursor showed no activity toward the target bacterial cells which could be due to its structural steric hindrance.
The colorimetric test used in this study was based on the reduction of the MTT dye by live bacteria. Thus, compounds that can reduce MTT cannot be assessed for their antibacterial properties using this assay. However, the as-synthesized CuO nanospheres used in the present study did not reduce MTT. Moreover, the results of the colorimetric assay revealed that in contrast to the tested Gram-negative bacteria, the nanospheres have highly selective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis bacteria (Table 4). The cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is composed of a thick layer of peptidoglycan (PGN) and that of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of an outer membrane, lipopolysaccharides, and a thinner PGN layer. The tested CuO nanospheres were effective against Gram-positive bacteria but were inactive against Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, we concluded that in Gram-negative bacteria the outer membrane as a protective barrier inhibits the absorption of the nanospheres. Small water or lipid-soluble molecules can enter the intracellular membrane through porins located in the outer membrane;174 Consequently, the insoluble designed CuO nanospheres in water and lipids cannot penetrate through the cell wall of the tested Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria has many pores that allow the transfer of guest molecules.175 On the other hand, Cu(II) compounds inhibit PGN elongation176 and activate PGN autolysin.177 PGN is the main part of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria; while, in Gram-negative bacteria PGN is a thin layer. Moreover, Cu(II) has a good affinity for the sulfur atom of the cysteine amino acid. The oxidizing ability of the metal in the CuO nanospheres may be associated with the bactericidal effects of CuO.178 Along with the CuO nanospheres, the antimicrobial activity of commercial CuO was also investigated (Table 4). We did not find any antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria for commercial CuO. The main reason for the difference between the activities of the synthesized CuO nanospheres and commercial CuO is the difference in their sizes and thus the surface areas of the nanoparticles. As the surface area increases, the contact between the nanoparticles and bacteria will simultaneously increase and consequently, the absorption of the nanoparticles through the bacterial pores will enhance. In fact, the main feature of the nanoparticles is their increased surface area compared to their bulk form as observed in the SEM image of the bulk commercial CuO (Fig. S17, ESI†).

4. Conclusion
In summary, in this work we have synthesized a new imidazole-2-thione based copper coordination polymer together with a by-product which was created during the oxidation–reduction processes between the metal and ligand. The title polymer was fully characterized by IR, CHNS, PL, TGA, PXRD and single crystal X-Ray diffraction analysis. The coordination geometry around the copper atoms in the title polymer is distorted tetrahedral, wherein each of the copper atoms are ligated by two bridging bromides and two sulfur atoms from two independent ebit ligands. The by-product was built up from two cationic and anionic parts. The coordination number around the copper atom in the anionic part is three with a distorted trigonal planar geometry. Both compounds are stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonds along the crystallographic axes to form 3D network structures. The considered polymer was used as an adsorbent to adsorb organic pollutants and was also converted to a nanosphere polymer through an ultrasonic method to use it as a precursor for the synthesis of CuO nanospheres. In addition, the adsorption kinetics and isotherms and the mechanism of the dye adsorption process of this polymer were investigated. The obtained CuO nanospheres were analyzed by SEM, TEM, EDX, PXRD and IR and tested for photocatalytic and antibacterial applications. The results showed their good performances in these applications.
