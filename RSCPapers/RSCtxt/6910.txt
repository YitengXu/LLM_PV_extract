    , Accepted 7th July 2017First published on 10th July 2017AbstractBased on first-principles calculations, we propose a two-dimensional α BP3 crystal in which one quarter of the phosphorus atoms in phosphorene are substituted by boron atoms. Its geometrical structure resembles that of graphene more than that of phosphorene, although phosphorus is present as a major component. It is dynamically stable and energetically much more stable than another allotrope analogous to blue (β) phosphorene. The α BP3 monolayer is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap (=0.77 eV) within the HSE06 calculation. For the BP3 bilayer, three stacking patterns are equally stable within 3 meV per atom. The monolayer exhibits a high electron mobility (∼4.6 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1) along the zigzag direction. In the bilayer, the mobility is ∼200 times higher than that of the α phosphorene bilayer. Specifically, it is even higher (∼3.7 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1) and amounts to ∼2500 times in one of the patterns. Therefore, the BP3 monolayer or bilayer will be useful as an n-type material in nanoelectronics through appropriate doping.
1. Introduction
Black (α) phosphorene, atomically thin phosphorus, is a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals material first exfoliated from black phosphorus in 2014.1,2 Its chemical structure is characterized by high anisotropy along the two in-plane directions and a chair-like puckered conformation along the vertical direction. Following the exfoliation of phosphorene, extensive investigations of this material have been performed due to its tunable thickness-dependent direct band gap in the 0.6–1.5 eV range,3 superior carrier mobility of up to 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is much larger than those of the transition metal dichalcogenides,1,2,4 high on/off ratio,5 ultrahigh trion binding energy,6 and high photoresistivity.7 Other allotropes, including blue phosphorene and hittorfene, have been predicted8–10 and subsequently synthesized.11
Black phosphorene exhibits anisotropy in mechanical, electrical, optical, thermal, and lithium and sodium ion transport properties,5,12–17 ferroelectricity in the presence of a vertical electric field,18 a negative interlayer Poisson's ratio,19 and charge localization upon bending.20 The preferred direction of its electron mobility can even be reversed under an appropriate in-plane strain.13 Its electronic and optical properties can be modulated by noncovalent interactions with electron donating or withdrawing molecules.21 Homojunctions with different edge modifications can be possibly used for solar cells.22 Flexible transistors can be fabricated using black phosphorene multilayers with current gain and power gain frequencies in the gigahertz range.23,24 Vertical transistors with high on-state current densities can be constructed by forming a van der Waals heterojunction with graphene.25 Vertical pn-heterojunction photodetectors can be fabricated based on a type-II junction with n-type MoS2.26 Black phosphorene nanoflakes show an extraordinary sensing ability for humidity.27 Compared to its three-dimensional (3D) bulk analogue, the black phosphorene monolayer displays a 40-fold increase in the efficiency of solar energy conversion to chemical energy.28 It has also been found that interlayer stacking faults enrich the electronic and transport properties of black phosphorene multilayers.29
Nevertheless, there are major obstacles that severely limit the industrial application of black phosphorene as an alternative to silicon technology. Most importantly, an inexpensive method for mass production, such as chemical vapor deposition, is currently unavailable. Black phosphorene can be obtained only from the exfoliation of black phosphorus, which is synthesized at high temperature and high pressure.30 In this regard, various alternatives to black phosphorene have been pursued.31 For example, it was computationally shown that one of the three allotropes of an arsenic phosphide monolayer exhibits an electron mobility that is one order of magnitude larger than that for black phosphorene.32 Similarly, the GeP3 and Ti2CO2 monolayers, for which the multilayers have already been known to form 3D crystals,33,34 also possess high carrier mobilities.35,36 Attention has also been paid to group IV monochalcogenides, including SnS, SnSe, GeS, and GeSe, all of which have puckered structures similar to that of black phosphorene. However, the measured hole mobility of SnS (∼20 cm2 V−1 s−1) is found to be much smaller than that of phosphorene and is of the same order of magnitude as those of 2D metal chalcogenides.37
Graphene exhibits a perfect planar geometry due to the sp2 hybridization of its carbon atoms, while phosphorene and its analogs do not. In this regard, we address the following questions: (1) how can the structural puckering in phosphorene be reduced so that its derivative adopts a partially planar geometry? (2) Will the derivative exhibit carrier mobilities much higher than those of phosphorene such that they become comparable to those of graphene? Partial planarity and higher mobilities may be simultaneously achieved by doping phosphorene with non-transition metal atoms that strongly favor sp2 hybridization. For this purpose, using first principles calculations, we propose a 2D layered BP3, in which one quarter of the phosphorene P atoms are substituted by B atoms. We will show that this material does indeed exhibit a very high electron mobility that is comparable to that of graphene.38
2. Computational methods
Structure prediction for crystalline BP3 is performed using the CALYPSO (crystal structure predictions by particle swarm optimization) program.39,40 We employ the program to generate ∼400 initial structures that include 1–3 formula units (NU) of BP3 in a primitive cell. Each of these is relaxed to a local minimum of the potential energy surface (PES) using the density functional theory (DFT) method implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)41,42 as described below. Four structures with the lowest energy are then refined among these initial structures, also optimizing the lattice parameters. Below, we will show that the most stable phase (α BP3) has rectangular symmetry, where the X and Y axes are defined to be parallel to the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
Standard geometry relaxations are performed using the periodic DFT method implemented in the VASP. Throughout this work, attractive van der Waals interactions are taken into account employing the optB88-vdW functional that is a nonlocal exchange–correlation functional.43,44 In a specific case described in the main text, Grimme's D3 correction (PBE-D3) is also employed.45 The electron–ion interactions are described using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, which is primarily a frozen-core all-electron calculation.46 For structure optimization, atoms are relaxed in the direction of the Hellmann–Feynman force using the conjugate gradient method with an energy cut-off of 400 eV until a stringent convergence criterion (=0.001 eV Å−1) is satisfied. k-point sampling is performed using Γ-centered 12 × 20 × 1 points for our 2D systems.
The phonon dispersion relation is calculated by employing the supercell finite-displacement method implemented in the PHONOPY package,47 with the VASP used as the force-constant calculator.48 Force evaluations are performed on 4 × 5 × 1 supercells using reduced k-point sampling meshes of 3 × 3 × 1 points. To further verify the thermal stability of a specific phase at room temperature, Nose–Hoover molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed in constant NVT systems with a time step of 1.0 fs and Γ-point sampling.49–51
We describe the mechanical properties of our 2D sheet with two independent sets of parameters, i.e., the in-plane stiffness (CX and CY) and Poisson's ratio ν. These are calculated from the harmonic approximation: Es = p11εX2 + p12εY2 + p2εXεY, where Es is the strain energy, and εX and εY are strains along the X and Y axes, respectively. Then, the stiffness parameters along the two directions, as well as the Poisson's ratios (νX and νY) can be calculated from the following relations: CX = (2p11 − p22/2p12)/S0, CY = (2p12 − p22/2p11)/S0, νX = p2/2p12, and νY = p2/2p11. More details are given in the ESI.†
In a 2D system, the carrier mobility can be calculated from the deformation potential (DP) approximation:52 (1)where C2D is the elastic modulus of the longitudinal strain in the transport direction, m* is the effective mass of the carrier in the same direction, md is the average effective mass in the two directions given by  and Ei1 mimics the deformation energy constant of the carrier due to phonons for the i-th edge band along the transport direction through the relation: Ei1 = ΔEi/(Δl/l0), where ΔEi and Δl/l0 represent the energy change of the i-th band and lattice dilation, respectively. The DP method has been shown to be useful in calculating the carrier mobilities of other 2D semiconducting materials.32,36,53,54
3. Results and discussion
We first briefly describe the chemical structure of the most stable (α) phase that can be considered as B-doped α phosphorene. There are three P atoms and one B atom in a primitive cell. B atoms are exclusively bonded to P atoms along the zigzag direction such that B and P atoms alternate along this direction. Table 1 shows that the a constant (5.51 Å) along the armchair direction is longer than that (=4.59 Å) of α phosphorene, while the b constant (3.24 vs. 3.30 Å) is almost identical. This occurs because our α BP3 does not maintain the puckered conformation along the armchair direction, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The sp2-hybridization of the B atoms places three P atoms and one B atom around each B–P bond (lzB–P) along the zigzag direction on the same plane. In a sense, the material can be considered to be a set of zigzag nanoribbons that are parallel and chemically connected to one another along the armchair direction. The width (WPP) of a nanoribbon as defined by the two edge P atoms is 5.07 Å. Considering that the plane is only slightly (=17.5°) tilted from the monolayer XY plane, its projection to the a parameter (=4.84 Å) amounts to 88% of the parameter. In this regard, α BP3 has a geometrical structure which resembles that of graphene more than that of phosphorene, although phosphorus is present as a major component. Table 1 also shows that there is a slight disproportionation of the B–P bonds, where the bond lengths of one armchair (lAB–P) and two equivalent zigzag (lzB–P) bonds are 1.94 and 1.85 Å, respectively. Likewise, the bond lengths (2.21 and 2.26 Å, respectively) are also slightly different for one armchair (lAP–P) and two equivalent zigzag (lzP–P) P–P bonds. This is different from the case of α phosphorene, in which the former bonds are longer.

 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the two most stable phases of the BP3 monolayer. Two different views are shown: α (a and b) and β (c and d). For the α phase, the width (WPP) of a nanoribbon defined by two edge P atoms as well as one armchair (lAB–P) and two equivalent zigzag (lzB–P) bonds are also shown. Dark brown and brown colors represent boron (B) and phosphorus (P) atoms, respectively. 
Here, we briefly report the chemical structure of the second most stable (β) phase. Fig. 1(c) and (d) show that this phase is similar to blue (β) phosphorene in that two P atoms in the 2 × 2 hexagonal unit cell of the latter are replaced by two B atoms. Similar to the case of the recently investigated GeP3,35 every B atom has another three B atoms that are three bonds apart. Refer to Table 1 for various parameters. Every B atom has three equivalent B–P bonds, while every P atom has two equivalent P–P bonds and one B–P bond. The table indicates that the β phase is appreciably (∼85 meV per atom) less stable than the α phase, with the difference larger than the corresponding difference (∼20 meV) between the two phases of phosphorene.9 Therefore, we will only consider the latter phase in the following discussion. Chemical structures of two other less stable phases found in this work are shown in Fig. S1(a) and (b) (ESI†), which are 86 and 92 meV per atom less stable than the α phase.
We would like to note that our phonon calculation shows that α BP3 is dynamically stable. Fig. 2(a) shows no negative frequencies in the long wavelength acoustic modes. At a glance, the figure indicates that the group velocities of acoustic modes display anisotropy observed in α phosphorene.55 In addition, optical modes are also more flat along the armchair direction. Meanwhile, the crystal structure remains intact in our MD simulation for 2 ps at 300 K, showing that it is thermally stable at room temperature. A comparison of the CX values presented in Table 1 indicates that the material is harder than α phosphorene along the armchair direction, as expected from the highly planar geometry. In fact, the Poisson's ratio (νY = 0.10) indicates that the transverse contraction in response to the tensile strain along the zigzag direction is much smaller than that (=0.81) in α phosphorene.56 On the other hand, a similar comparison of the CY values (113.12 J m−2vs. 88.02 J m−2) shows that our materials are slightly harder along the zigzag direction.
 Fig. 2  Phonon dispersion relation (a) and the HSE06 band structure (b) of the α BP3 monolayer. The charge density distributions in the VBM (c) and CBM (d) are also shown. 
The HSE06 band structure shown in Fig. 2(b) indicates that α BP3 is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 0.77 eV, which certainly lies between those (1.65 and 0.00 eV) of α phosphorene and graphene.32 It is interesting to note that the structural change accompanied by B-doping not only introduces an appreciable decrease in the band gap from that of α phosphorene but also gives rise to a change in the nature of the band gap from direct to indirect. The valence band maximum (VBM) is located at the Y point that represents π*(P) orbitals in Fig. 2(c). We recall that they are not π(P) orbitals, because a B atom has two fewer valence electrons than a P atom. On the other hand, the conduction band minimum (CBM) is located at the S point, where the empty π(B) orbitals interact weakly with the σ(P) orbitals, as shown in Fig. 2(d).
Next, we investigate the various stacking patterns in the bilayer of α BP3. In the initial structure of the simplest pattern (AA), we initially place the two layers exactly eclipsed along the c direction. As Fig. 3(a) and (b) show, the structure optimization using the optB88-vdW functional shifts one of the layers (for example, the upper) along the X direction by ∼1/5 (=1.11 Å) such that the interatomic distances between all equivalent atoms in different layers are the same (=4.30 Å). The closest interlayer distance (dZ) is 2.74 Å, as defined in Fig. 3 by the smallest difference of Z coordinates of the two layers. Starting from the initial AA pattern, other patterns are generated either by shifting the top layer along the various directions, by rotating the layer by 180° with respect to the c axis, or by their combinations. The second pattern (AB′) shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d) is generated from the initial AA pattern by a 180° rotation followed by a shift (1/2) along the b direction. After the structure optimization, the upper layer is shifted along the X direction by 3.75 Å such that its dZ value is 2.80 Å. According to our calculation based on the optB88-vdW, pattern AB′ is as stable as pattern AA within 1 meV per atom. For comparison, we have also calculated the relative stability of the two patterns using the PBE-D3, finding that their energy difference (0.1 meV per atom) is even smaller. Therefore, we can conclude that the two patterns are almost equally stable.
 Fig. 3  Three most stable stacking patterns of the bilayer of α BP3: AA (a and b), AB′ (c and d), and AC (e and f). The closest interlayer distance (dZ) along the c direction is also shown for each one. Dark brown and brown colors represent boron (B) and phosphorus (P) atoms on the upper layer, respectively. For clarity, P and B atoms belonging to the lower layers are represented by different colors. 
The interlayer binding energies (EL = 49 meV per atom) in the two patterns are comparable to that (=54 meV per atom) in the bilayer of α phosphorene, while they are slightly larger than that (=32 meV per atom) for the graphene bilayer obtained in this work. Therefore, we can expect that BP3 bilayers can also be exfoliated to monolayers. As Fig. 4(a) and (b) show, the two patterns display band gaps (0.36 and 0.47 eV for AA and AB′, respectively) that are appreciably smaller than that of the monolayer due to a weaker quantum confinement effect mediated by π*(P) and π(B) orbitals. Although we will not go into details, our separate calculations show that band gaps become even smaller in the trilayers, where the third layer adopts a stacking pattern with respect to the second layer that is similar to that of the second layer with respect to the first one. In fact, the AAA trilayer becomes metallic, while the other one is still semiconducting.
 Fig. 4  HSE06 band structures of patterns AA (a), AB′ (b), and AC (c) of the α BP3 bilayer. 
The third pattern (AC) can be obtained from the initial AA pattern by translating the upper layer by −1/3 (=−1.83 Å) along the X direction, whose magnitude amounts to the projection of the bond length of an armchair B–P bond on the monolayer plane. As a result of the translation, the P atom on the upper layer is located approximately at the center of the hexagon defined by the lower layer. [See Fig. 3(e) and (f).] Different from the case of the other two patterns mentioned above, our structure optimization does not slide the upper layer of the pattern along any lateral direction. The interlayer binding is weaker than those in the other two patterns by 3 meV per atom, indicating that a stacking fault can be introduced into the multilayers such that the pattern is locally realized along the c direction. Consistent with its lower EL value, the dZ value of 2.92 Å is the largest among the three patterns. Fig. 4(c) indicates that the pattern displays a band structure similar to those of AA and AB′. One minor difference is that here, the splitting of the two valence bands, as well as that of the two conduction bands, is the weakest among the three patterns, leading to the largest band gap (=0.63 eV). We find that many other patterns are possible for the bilayer. Table S1 (ESI†) shows the relative stability of patterns other than the three most stable ones, the structures of which are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
Next, we investigate the carrier mobility of the α BP3 monolayer. Table 2 summarizes various parameters involved in the calculation of carrier mobilities. A comparison of the effective mass indicates that both electrons and holes are much lighter than those of α phosphorene along the zigzag direction. The electron mass is only 13% of that of the latter. On the other hand, it is surprising to note that the hole mass of the α BP3 monolayer is only 3% of that of α phosphorene. As far as effective masses are concerned, both kinds of carriers display less pronounced anisotropy than those in α phosphorene along either of the two directions57 in agreement with the less pronounced anisotropy in the C2D parameter in Table 2. The charge density distribution at the VBM shown in Fig. 2(c) suggests that the hole transport along the direction will be mediated by π*(P) orbitals of P atoms in the alternating P–B–P chains along the zigzag direction.
Table 2 Elastic modulus (C2D), effective mass (me*, mh*) of electrons and holes with respect to free-electron mass (m0), deformation energy of the CBM and VBM (ECBM1, EVBM1), and the mobility (μe, μh) of electrons and holes along two directions (zigzag and armchair) for the α BP3 monolayer (NL = 1) as well as those for the three most stable stacking patterns of the α BP3 bilayer (NL = 2). For each system, the modulus is calculated using the optB88-vdW functional, while the effective mass and the deformation energy are calculated using the HSE06 functional. For comparison, corresponding data for the monolayer and the bilayer of α phosphorene are also shown

Table 2 also shows that the electron mobility (μe) of the α BP3 monolayer is more than 570 times larger than that of the α phosphorene monolayer along the zigzag direction. It can be ascribed to its effective mass (me*) and deformation energy (ECBM1), both of which are approximately seven times smaller. As two examples subject to the largest errors, Fig. S3(a) and (b) (ESI†) show the least squares fits to the ECBM1 as well as that to EVBM1. They indicate excellent linear behaviors of appropriate energy eigenvalues with respect to the dilation. Regarding the small deformation energy, we recall that the CBM represents Φ(B) states that are separated from one another such that its k value corresponds to the vertex (S point) of the 1st Brillouin zone. This is in stark contrast to the case of α phosphorene, in which the CBM is located at the zone center (=Γ point). Surprisingly, the electron mobility (∼4.6 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1) is comparable to an experimental value of graphene.38 As expected, the electron mobility (μe) is highly anisotropic. The mobility is approximately 40 times smaller along the armchair direction, being almost equal to that of α phosphorene along the same direction. On the other hand, the hole mobility of α BP3 is of the same order of magnitude as that of α phosphorene. In short, the α BP3 monolayer exhibits a much higher electron mobility than α phosphorene along the zigzag direction, which supports our point of view that the material is a set of planar zigzag nanoribbons. This observation is another manifestation of this material being an intermediate between graphene and α phosphorene. Therefore, our monolayer will be useful as an n-type material in field-effect transistors through either chemical doping or gate doping.
The data in Table 2 also enable comparison of the various parameters related to the carrier mobility of the α BP3 bilayer with those of the α phosphorene bilayer. In each kind of bilayer, the C2D parameter is approximately twice the value of the corresponding monolayer, and the me* and mh* values are generally not highly sensitive to the bilayer formation. In the α phosphorene, the bilayer formation leads to the increase of EVBM1 by a factor of ten, resulting in the decrease of μh by the same degree. On the other hand, the formation of the bilayers has a much smaller effect on ECBM1. Bilayer formation in α BP3 also has a minor effect on the EVBM1, resulting in no appreciable increase in the hole mobility in any of the three patterns. On the other hand, the formation slightly decreases the ECBM1 along the zigzag direction in pattern AA, but it increases the ECBM1 along the armchair direction. As two examples subject to the largest errors, Fig. S4(a) and (b) (ESI†) show the least squares fits to the ECBM1 of patterns AA and AB′, in which very good linear behaviors of appropriate energy eigenvalues are also observed. Generally, bilayer formation does not lead to a significant increase in the carrier mobility of α phosphorene. On the other hand, it is impressive to note that the electron mobility (∼3.7 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1) of pattern AA along the zigzag direction is even higher than that of the α BP3 monolayer. Even better, the mobility is ∼2500 times higher than that of the α phosphorene bilayer. The electron mobilities (2.7 × 104 and 3.2 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1) of patterns AB′ and AC along the same direction, being slightly smaller than that of pattern AA, are still ∼200 times higher than that of the α phosphorene bilayer. Fig. S5(a)–(f) (ESI†) show the charge density distributions in the VBM and CBM of the three patterns. Different from the case of the two former patterns, the CBM in the latter one represents a bonding interaction between π(B) orbitals of the two layers. Adopting the particle-in-a-box model, an electron in the CBM of the latter one can be considered to be confined in a box larger than that in the case of electrons in the CBM of the former ones. Therefore, we can expect that the energy eigenvalue of the CBM will be less sensitive to the dilation in the latter one.
The electron mobility of the bilayer is highly anisotropic. Along the armchair direction, it is much smaller than that along the zigzag direction. Specifically, the mobility is ∼260 times smaller in pattern AA. On the other hand, the hole mobility of the α BP3 bilayer along the zigzag direction is generally smaller than the electron mobility of the bilayer, indicating that the bilayer will be useful as an n-type material. The hole mobility is of the same magnitude as either that of the α BP3 monolayer or that of the α phosphorene bilayer along both directions.
4. Conclusions
We have proposed a two-dimensional BP3 crystal in which a quarter of phosphorus atoms in phosphorene are substituted by boron atoms based on first-principles calculations. We have searched for the most stable phase among ∼400 different crystal structures consistent with the stoichiometry. Its geometrical structure resembles that of graphene more than that of phosphorene. The sp2 hybridization of the boron atoms in the BP3 introduces a reduction in the ring puckering of the monolayer in the most stable phase, making it a series of parallel zigzag nanoribbons that are chemically connected along the armchair direction. The planarity of the nanoribbons is manifested in the stiffness parameter and Poisson's ratio along the armchair direction. According to our phonon calculation and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, the obtained structure is dynamically and thermally stable. In addition, we have found that it is energetically much more stable than another allotrope that is analogous to blue (β) phosphorene. The HSE06 band structure indicates that the α BP3 monolayer is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap (=0.77 eV) smaller than that of α phosphorene. Along the zigzag direction, the monolayer exhibits a high electron mobility (∼4.6 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1) comparable to an experimental value of graphene.
Intrinsic defects play an important role in the chemical stability of a 2D material. In this regard, monovacancies were shown to be easily formed and highly mobile in a phosphorene monolayer.58 Our separate calculation suggests that the formation of a phosphorus (P) monovacancy is at least 1010 times less favorable than in the α phosphorene monolayer. In addition, boron monovacancy is also found to be as much unfavorable. Therefore, we expect that monovacancies would not introduce a significant chemical instability in the α BP3 monolayer at room temperature.
For the BP3 bilayer, we have identified three stacking patterns (AA, AB′, and AC) that are equally stable within 3 meV per atom. The weaker quantum confinement effect reduces their band gaps to 0.36, 0.47, and 0.63 eV, respectively. The interlayer binding energies (EL = 46–49 meV per atom) in the patterns are comparable to that in the α phosphorene bilayer. Therefore, we can expect that BP3 bilayers can also be exfoliated to monolayers. The electron mobility of the bilayer is highly anisotropic. The mobility (∼3.7 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1) of pattern AA along the zigzag direction is even higher than that of the α BP3 monolayer. It can be ascribed to a larger space available to the electrons in its CBM due to the interlayer bonding interaction of the CBMs of the two constituent layers. Even better, it is ∼2500 times higher than that of the α phosphorene bilayer. Along the same direction, patterns AB′ and AC exhibit mobilities (2.7 × 104 and 3.2 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1) slightly smaller than that of pattern AA. However, they are still ∼200 times higher than that of the α phosphorene bilayer. Therefore, our monolayer or bilayer will be quite useful as an n-type material in field-effect transistors through either chemical doping or gate doping.
