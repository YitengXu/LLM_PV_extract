    , Accepted 30th May 2019First published on 12th July 2019AbstractCeria was deposited onto boron doped polycrystalline diamond (BDD) cathodes, through electrochemically induced precipitation from nitrate-based solutions. The deposits were characterized using SEM-EDS, HRTEM, XRD and XPS. The morphology, thickness and composition of ceria films, which besides CeO2 contained Ce(OH)3 when prepared at very negative potential, were controlled by tuning the deposition parameters. Thin Ce(OH)3-free ceria films allowed CO2 electrochemical reduction at overpotentials below 50 mV, yielding formic acid with faradaic yield higher than 40% and stable performance for many hours. Ceria seemed to act as a co-catalyst that activated CO2 for reduction at the H-terminated BDD surface, because comparable results were not obtained with ceria-coated glassy carbon electrodes.
Introduction
The massive production and accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere has a dramatic impact on global warming.1–3 To limit the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, besides reducing the CO2 emissions by increasing the efficiency of fossil fuel usage, various strategies for capturing and/or converting CO2 are being studied and implemented. Mimicking the high efficiency of natural photosynthesis would be one of the most scientifically challenging avenues.4,5 A major contribution of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) processes to the limitation of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere can hardly be envisaged in the short term. However, from a circular economy perspective, the conversion of wastes like CO2 to useful compounds for use in industrial processes, and also as fuels, is an important goal that may be pursued by developing electrochemical reduction processes powered by green or renewable energy sources, for example, wind, tidal, solar, or the so-called “blue energy” systems.6–8
The feasibility of the CO2RR strongly depends on the performance of the electrocatalysts used. Besides activity, especially at low overpotential, and stability, the catalyst's ability to selectively produce a single compound with high efficiency is a key issue. Among all the products of the CO2RR, formic acid is appealing considering its high volumetric (53.4 g L−1) and moderate gravimetric (4.4 wt%) hydrogen storage capacity under ambient conditions, and the possibility of using it either directly as a fuel or as a H2 source, through catalytic decomposition.9,10
The most studied electrodes for CO2 reduction are metals, in particular transition metals,11 and they may be grouped into two main categories: CO oriented metals (Cu, Au, Ag, Zn, Pd, Ga, Ni, and Pt) and formate oriented metals (Pb, Hg, Tl, In, Sn, Cd and Bi). On various metals, formate is produced with efficiencies higher than 70% in carbonate electrolyte, at overpotentials higher than 500 mV,12,13 but obtaining high efficiency at low overpotential is quite challenging. Nanostructured or surface activated Cu generates high amounts of formic acid, but with CO, methane or other hydrocarbons as side products.14,15 Pd is recognized as a catalyst that can produce formate at low overpotential,16–18 but high cost, compared to non-noble metals, and easy surface poisoning limit its potential for widespread use. Ceria-based materials are well known as catalysts or co-catalysts for many heterogeneous catalytic applications. Ceria has been used for oxidation reactions in the gas phase (CO, hydrocarbons, organics…), hydrogenation reactions (CO + H2, organic compounds), elimination of SOx and NOx in automotive exhaust catalysts19,20 and for the electrochemical oxidation of alcohols in fuel cell applications.20–26 Most of the catalytic properties of ceria are related to the lattice ion mobility, the redox properties of the CeIII/CeIV system and the formation of adsorbed superoxides with high oxidizing power. In the present paper, we report on the preparation of CeO2/BDD electrodes obtained by modifying boron-doped diamond (BDD) supports with an electroprecipitation technique. We studied the electrodeposition process, changing the deposition parameters, with the aim of controlling the morphology, thickness, stoichiometry and phase composition of the deposits. The electrocatalytic behaviour of these materials was studied, focusing in particular on the co-catalytic effects of ceria in a low overpotential range, where BDD itself is inactive, and on formic acid production.
Experimental
Preparation of electrocatalysts
Deposition of CeO2 onto boron doped polycrystalline diamond electrodes (geometric area 0.28 cm2) was carried out in a two-compartment cell. The BDD working electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode were placed in the main cell compartment, and a Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) in the lateral compartment. Voltammetry measurements were performed in the same cell. The BDD working electrodes were placed mainly face up, but depositions performed with working electrodes immersed vertically in the solution gave the same results in terms of film thickness and morphology, which ruled out the possibility that films were formed by precipitation of species generated in the bulk solution. The solutions used to study the deposition of CeO2 contained from 0.4 mM to 0.1 M Ce(NO3)3 and 0.1 M NaNO3. The electrodes used in the electrocatalytic tests were prepared in 0.004 M Ce(NO3)3 and 0.1 M NaNO3 (pH = 4.5). Deposition baths were not deaerated. The presence of 0.1 M NaNO3 ensured that nitrate ions were not significantly depleted, so they were reduced at a constant rate during experiments, which guaranteed stable pH profiles during depositions. Ceria layers were deposited also on glassy carbon electrodes, using the same procedures as for BDD, to prepare the CeO2–GC electrodes used, for comparison, in CO2 reduction. Electrochemical experiments were performed with an Autolab PGSTAT 302N potentiostat.
The boron doped polycrystalline diamond films were grown on p-type (111) silicon wafers (Furuya Metal Co.) using a commercial microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition (MP-CVD) method with commercial microwave plasma reactors (Models AX6500 and AX5400, CORNES Technologies Corp.) following a procedure described in ref. 27. Additional details on our BDD electrodes, their cleaning and activation are reported in the ESI (including Fig. S1 and S2).†
Characterization
SEM images were obtained with a Zeiss SIGMA instrument, equipped with a field-emission gun, operating under high vacuum conditions, at an accelerating voltage variable from 5 keV to 30 keV, depending on the observation needs. The film thickness was evaluated from cross-sectional images of fractured samples. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were performed using an Oxford X-MAX.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a Philips X-PERT PW3710 diffractometer with a Bragg–Brentano geometry, employing a CuKα source (40 kV, 30 mA).
High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and High-Angle Annular Dark-Field Scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) were performed on a JEOL JEM-2200FS microscope, working at 200 kV. Elemental maps were obtained by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). Samples for TEM and XRD analysis were prepared by gently removing the ceria film from BDD and transferred onto a suitable support.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was performed using a JPS–9000 MC (JEOL) equipped with a Mg Kα line source. Peak integration was obtained by fitting XPS spectra to a Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shape after subtracting the background obtained with a Shirley-type function.
CO2RR
Electrolyses were performed in either 0.1 M KHCO3 buffer solution (CB) or 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PB), prepared using K2HPO4 and KH2PO4 (pH = 6.8), saturated with CO2 for at least 30 minutes. These solutions were pre-electrolysed before use to guarantee high purity,28 as it is known that even small amounts of metal impurities can lead to surface interference with electrochemical reactions, especially when using electrodes with small areas. Pre-electrolysis was carried out in a two-compartment cell with Pt wire as a counter electrode and a Pt plate as a working electrode (1.5 cm2); electrolysis of a few mL of electrolyte was performed for at least 8 h at a current of 0.1 mA while stirring the solution.
Electrolyses were performed in a custom-made three-electrode electrochemical cell described in the ESI† (including Fig. S3†). The working electrode was placed face-up in the bottom of the cell. An Hg|HgO|KOH 0.5 M reference electrode and a Pt spiral counter electrode were placed into glass tubes and isolated from the electrolytic solution with medium size porous frits. In the Results and discussion section devoted to the CO2RR, potential values are reported vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).
Analyses of the liquid products were performed by means of a Metrohm model 850 Professional IC Ion Chromatograph equipped with a Metrosep A Supp 4-250/4.0 anion column and a conductivity detector. The eluent used was 0.5 mM H2SO4, with 15% acetone.
Products in the liquid phase were analyzed using solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). The SPME fiber (75 μm, Carboxen-PDMS) was used in the headspace of the liquid sample (1.5 mL) heated to 50 °C in a water bath for 60 min. GC/MS was performed with an Agilent 6850 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5975C quadrupole mass analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), operating in electron ionization (EI, 70 eV, 35 mA) mode. The quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in full scan mode from m/z 20 to m/z 500. The GC column used was a DB5 (60 m, 0.32 mm internal diameter, 1 μm film thickness). The carrier gas was He at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The oven temperature was varied between 50 and 300 °C at a 10 °C min−1 rate. The temperature of the injector and transfer line was 280 °C.
Gases produced during electrolysis were collected into small capacity (50 mL) gas bags. At the end of each electrolysis, a CO2 flow was used to convey gaseous products to the bag and to fill its whole volume. In this way, all the gases present in the void volume of the cell were collected. Gases were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent Micro-GC 490 equipped with a 20 m Molsieve 5 Å column). The column temperature was 40 °C, sampling time was 4 s and injection time was 40 ms. The gas carrier was the same as that used for gas stripping during electrochemical experiments (CO2).
Results and discussion
Preparation of CeO2/BDD electrodes
Ceria layers were deposited onto BDD cathodes from Ce(NO3)3 and NaNO3 solutions. The BDD substrate was chosen because it combined several desirable features, i.e., wide potential window, low background current, good conductivity, inactivity towards the CO2RR at low overpotential, low catalytic activity towards the HER (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction, which competes with the CO2RR), chemical inertness, and mechanical durability.29,30 Both anodic31,32 and cathodic33–51 electrodeposition of ceria have been extensively discussed in the literature. Anodic deposition consists in the direct oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+, to produce a CeO2 layer. The moderate conductivity of CeO2 may limit the scope of this approach. Cathodic deposition follows a base generation/precipitation path, first introduced by Switzer et al. to prepare nanocrystalline CeO2 powders33 and then used by other groups to prepare coatings for corrosion protection,35,36,40–44 microelectronics,41 materials for direct methanol fuel cells,47 sensing48 and water treatment,49 condensate microdrop self-propelling porous films50 and low-temperature combustion of methanol.51

Fig. 1 shows a linear sweep voltammogram recorded on a BDD electrode in a 0.4 mM Ce(NO3)3 and 0.1 M NaNO3 solution; its inset highlights the low current density region. Various peaks were detected that can be identified as follow, based on published literature. Peak a, at around −1.0 V, was due to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite,40,43 (eqn (1)) NO−3 + H2O + 2e− → NO−2 + 2OH−(1)peak b, at around 1.3 V, was due to the reduction of nitrite to ammonia (or ammonium, depending on pH),40,43 (eqn (2)) NO−2 + 5H2O + 6e− → NH3 + 7OH−(2)and the sharply rising current c, at potentials below −1.5 V, was mainly due to hydrogen evolution, (eqn (3)) 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−(3)

In our aerated solution, and in our cells without separation between the working and counter electrodes, where the oxygen produced at the anode could diffuse towards the cathode, peaks d and e were observed and respectively ascribed to hydrogen peroxide formation (peak d, eqn (4))40,52 and to further reduction of H2O2 (peak e, eqn (5)).52 O2 + 2H2O + 2e− → H2O2 + 2OH−(4) H2O2 + 2e− → 2OH−(5)

Fig. 2a shows three chronoamperograms recorded on BDD electrodes, at three different potential values (−1.0, −1.5 and −2.0 V vs. SCE), in a 4 mM Ce(NO3)3 and 0.1 M NaNO3 solution. These deposition potentials, referenced to the SHE, are marked as red horizontal lines in the Pourbaix diagram in Fig. 2b. They are representative of the three regions a, b, and c present in Fig. 1 corresponding to eqn (1)–(3) and were chosen to ensure a sufficiently high nitrate reduction rate to obtain an adequate local alkalinisation of the solution, essential for precipitation of cerium oxides/hydroxides onto the BDD surface. They were more negative than the standard potential for eqn (1) (blue line in Fig. 2b), even when strong alkalinisation occurred.53 The onset potential of the voltammetric curve in Fig. 1 agreed with the blue line.

The red horizontal lines represent the deposition potential applied in ceria electrodepositions. The blue line shows the equilibrium potential of the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (eqn (1)). 
The reactions described by eqn (1)–(5) induce alkalinisation of the solution close to the BDD cathode, causing the local pH to rise from its initial value (ca. 4.5) to values that, depending on the concentration of the reduced species and on the applied potential, may reach 10–12.52 At those pH values, the solubility product of Ce(OH)3 is reached. CeO2 formation requires an oxidation step. Many authors have suggested that the reaction mechanism, essentially independent of the electrode material, is related to H2O2 formation by oxygen reduction, a reaction that occurs at potentials close to those used to deposit ceria. H2O2 has often been added to (nitrate-free) baths for ceria deposition.39,40,45
In the presence of hydroxyl ions and H2O2, the Ce3+ cations in proximity of the electrode can react following two different paths: they can react with OH− and precipitate as Ce(OH)3, (eqn (6)) Ce3+ + OH− → Ce(OH)3↓(6)or they can be oxidized by H2O2 (eqn (7)) 2Ce3+ + 2OH− + H2O2 → 2Ce(OH)22+(7)
It has been reported that direct oxidation of Ce3+ cations by molecular oxygen is thermodynamically not permitted, but Ce(OH)3 can be oxidized following (eqn (8)) 4Ce(OH)3 + O2 → 4CeO2↓ + 6H2O(8)
The CeIV hydroxyl complex hydrolyses to give CeO2 that precipitates on the electrode surface, (eqn (9)) Ce(OH)22+ + 2OH− → CeO2↓ + 2H2O(9)
In summary, deposits formed on the cathode are expected to contain mixtures of CeIII hydroxide and CeIV oxide obtained through oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. The chronoamperograms in Fig. 2a show that, after an initial decrease due to a local pH increase, occurring on a shorter time scale for more negative potentials, the current reached steady state values, indicating that the deposition process was not hindered by the formation of poorly conductive films.

Table 1 summarizes the deposition charge and film thickness data, collected for the upper and lower limits of deposition potential, and shows that there was no direct proportionality between charge and thickness. The ratio between film thickness and deposition charge was markedly higher at the lower potential, a behaviour that seems to be in contrast to the thumb rule that the more negative the potential is, the higher is the pH near the electrode and the higher is the deposition rate. In electroprecipitation, the amount of material that is deposited does not depend directly on the transferred charge, according to Faraday's law, especially when two or more reactions occur simultaneously, with different influences on local pH. At very negative potential, once the HER becomes heavily favoured, gas evolution interferes with the precipitation process in two ways: (i) by stirring the solution, thus limiting the pH rise and (ii) by mechanically removing the precipitates. The dependence of thickness on deposition charge suggests that there was an initial time, necessary for the local pH increase, during which little deposit was formed.

The same deposition procedure was used to prepare CeO2/GC electrodes. Deposition potentials were chosen to obtain similar currents and therefore similar thicknesses. XRD patterns were almost identical to those of CeO2/BDD electrodes. The XRD pattern is shown in Fig. S5.†
Characterization of CeO2/BDD electrodes
Numerous deposits obtained by changing potentials and deposition charges were analysed by SEM. For films with comparable thickness, the deposition potential had little or no effect on morphology. Control of the charge allowed us to obtain homogeneous films with thickness ranging from less than 10 nm (Fig. S4b†) to several hundreds of nm (Fig. S4d†). In general, thicker films were less compact. Over a certain thickness, the films became fibrous and presented evident cracks (Fig. S4e†), in agreement with previous literature which reported that cracking was due to drying, or due to support/film interaction during the deposition process itself.37,38,40,42 Films a few hundreds of nanometres thick showed some major porosity but could become unstable and brittle after prolonged electrolysis with marked gas evolution. Films a few nanometres thick were uniform and compact, adhered well to the BDD surface and were mechanically very stable. Images like that in Fig. S4c† were used for evaluating ceria film thickness.
TEM analyses were performed on samples that were prepared by gently removing films from the BDD surface and transferring them onto transparent conductive grids. They showed agglomerates of CeO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 3a), with average dimensions below 4 nm. Cubic structure Fmm with crystal lattice dimension a = 0.54 nm was confirmed by Fourier Transform Analysis (FFT) of Fig. 3b.

This figure refers to a sample prepared at −1.0 V, but we did not observe any effect of the deposition potential on the crystal structure and size. The particle size distribution was very narrow (Fig. 3c) and centred around 4 nm. Nanocrystallinity is a key feature because the conductivity of CeO2 is related to its microstructure. Preferential sites for electronic conductivity are known to be distributed on grain boundaries and nanocrystalline phase materials show a much higher grain boundary density compared to microcrystalline materials. This means that conductivity increases with decreasing crystal size.54 Furthermore, it is widely recognized that for electrocatalysis, nanoparticles have large numbers of reactive coordination sites due to their high number of surface atoms located at steps, corners and edges.
Both CeO2/BDD and powders obtained by mechanically removing the material from the BDD surface were submitted to X-ray diffraction to study the phase composition of the films, as a function of the deposition potential. The latter sample preparation was necessary due to the low thickness and low density of the deposits. XRD spectra of deposits obtained at Edep = −1.0 V vs. SCE (Fig. 4, curve a) showed only one phase, attributed to the CeO2 cubic fluorite-type structure,55 with low crystallinity, confirming the existence of nanoparticles. For a sample prepared at Edep = −2.0 V vs. SCE (Fig. 4, curve b), besides those attributed to CeO2, some weak reflections were observed that corresponded to peaks related to Ce(OH)3.56 The inset in Fig. 4, where the shape of the most intense reflection is analysed, highlights the formation of Ce(OH)3 at the more negative potential and its absence (or presence in a very low amount) at the less negative potential. These results agree with the set of reactions presented above in Section 3.1 (eqn (6) to eqn (9)). In particular, the potential dependence of the Ce(OH)3 formation may be explained as follows. H2O2 production by O2 reduction is likely to be diffusion limited, while hydroxyl ion production by the nitrate reduction reaction and HER is not. Thus, the ratio between the concentrations of hydroxyl ions and hydrogen peroxide increases at more negative potential and Ce(OH)3 precipitation becomes competitive with CeO2 formation.

Photoelectron spectroscopy has been systematically used to determine the electronic states of cerium in ceria.57Fig. 5 shows the Ce 3d3/2,5/2 spectra recorded on films electrodeposited at three potentials. The CeO2 3d-spectrum is composed of two multiplets that correspond to the spin–orbit split 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 core holes. In each spectrum in Fig. 5 there are peaks related to the Ce 3d5/2–3/2 doublet-pair of CeIV coloured in grey and some features related to 3d3/2–3d5/2 spin–orbit-split doublets which are characteristic for CeIII, coloured in red. The CeIII contribution increases as the deposition potential becomes more negative. If, as suggested by the XRD results (Fig. 4), the deposit obtained at −1.0 V vs. SCE contained no Ce(OH)3, the presence of CeIII signals must be ascribed to oxygen deficiency. Thus, the deposited ceria should be represented as CeOx, with x ≤ 2.
 Fig. 5  XPS high-resolution measurements and spectral fits of the Ce 3d3/2–5/2 region. 
It has been reported that the composition of ceria depended on the electroprecipitation potential,43,46 and that x in CeOx decreased at more negative potential. A calculation of CeOx stoichiometry based on CeIII/IV relative peak intensities according to the following formula (eqn (10)) (10)(where CeIV at% and CeIII at% are the atomic percentages, respectively, of CeIV and CeIII species; 2 and 1.5 represent, respectively, the oxygen stoichiometry of CeO2 and Ce2O3) leads to the results shown in Table 2. For the sample prepared at −1.0 V vs. SCE, whose diffractogram did not reveal the presence of Ce(OH)3, the calculated x value shows some oxygen deficiency that has been recognized to strongly affect the catalytic activity of ceria.20,21 Clearly, when Ce(OH)3 was present, i.e. for a deposition potential of −2.0 V and probably −1.5 V too, eqn (10) overestimated the oxygen vacancies, providing x values below the real ones. Cummings et al. reported that electroprecipitated CeIV species were reduced in solution at a potential of around 0.2 V vs. SCE.58

Electrochemical reduction may have been the path for the formation of oxygen vacancies, in our experiments. However, Table 2 shows that reduction of CeIV was not extensive. It has been reported that the CeOx cubic phase is stable with respect to Ce2O3 formation, for 2 > x > 1.7.45 Therefore the (underestimated) x values in Table 2 exclude the possibility that electrochemical reduction induced phase separation.
In the O 1s spectra (shown in Fig. S6 of the ESI,† for the three potentials) two peaks can be distinguished, one at 529 eV (blue) generated from lattice oxygen linked to CeIV centres and one at 531 eV (grey) attributed to OH− and to oxygen linked to CeIII centres, i.e. to oxygen vacancies. No contribution was ascribed to nitrate adsorption or inclusion, because nitrogen was not present in the XPS wide energy scan. The O/Ce atomic ratio is 30–50% higher than expected for a CeO2–Ce(OH)3 mixture and suggests surface contamination and the presence of water. Thus, the ratio between the two components in the O 1s spectrum cannot be used to obtain information on the CeOx stoichiometry, even when Ce(OH)3 is not present in significant amounts.
At each deposition potential, the composition of the deposits remained essentially unchanged upon increasing their thickness (Fig. 6). This shows that the deposits grew under constant conditions, i.e. the pH of the solution near the BDD surface remained constant.

CO2 reduction reaction on CeO2/BDD electrodes
CO2 saturated carbonate solutions have been used by many authors in the study of CO2 electrochemical reduction, because they can act as reservoirs for aqueous CO2, thanks to the following equilibria: CO2 + H2O ⇆ H2CO3(11) H2CO3 + H2O ⇆ HCO3− + H3O+ pKa1 = 6.35(12) HCO3− + H2O ⇆ CO32− + H3O+ pKa2 = 10.33(13)
Thus, reliable results not affected by CO2 depletion can be obtained in prolonged electrolyses. However, in carbonate solution, establishing the electrode activity through the comparison of voltammetric currents observed without and with CO2 saturation is problematic, because the solution pH depends on CO2 concentration and so the equilibrium potential of all pH-dependent reactions shifts. Furthermore, as reported by Hori,11 the CO2 reduction reaction and HER usually proceed at the same potentials and influence each other. Thus, when CO covers the electrode, it can happen that current densities are lower in CO2-saturated solutions than in solutions saturated with inert gas. Therefore, if there is no evidence that the current corresponds to a single electrochemical reaction, considering only current/potential measurements may be misleading. While the complications linked to the CO2RR/HER competition and to CO adsorption cannot be avoided, the use of 0.1 M phosphate buffer solutions (PB), whose pH is essentially independent of CO2 concentration, in addition to CB, prevents disturbing pH effects. Therefore, we have used both CB and PB in our voltammetric study.
The slow scan voltammograms in Fig. 7 show curves for BDD, CeO2/BDD and CeO2/GC electrodes in 0.1 M KHCO3 solution with and without CO2. CO2 reduction at bare BDD began at around −1.15 V vs. SHE, while the onset potential for the HER in N2 saturated solution was around −1.25 V vs. SHE. This result confirmed that BDD is almost completely inactive toward CO2 reduction at potentials less negative than −1.0 V vs. SHE, although it has been used effectively by various groups at strongly negative potentials. Einaga et al. obtained products like formaldehyde,59 methanol,60 and formic acid,61 with high efficiency, at potential below −1.3 V vs. SHE, and reported formic acid yield approaching 100%, below −1.8 V vs. SHE. Romero-Cuellar et al. reduced CO2 at potentials between −1.3 V and −1.8 V vs. SHE, obtaining only a few percent of CO.62 Saha et al. converted CO2 to peroxycarbonate in KOH, with high efficiency, but with a cell voltage of over 5 V.63 Recently, Birdja and Koper demonstrated that methanol and formic acid were obtained at a BDD electrode at very negative potentials, where the HER induced a strong local alkalinisation, through a base-catalysed Cannizzaro-type disproportionation reaction.64 For potentials less negative than −1.0 V vs. RHE, BDD produced methane. BDD modified electrodes were also used as a support for deposition of metals65 and metal oxides66 for CO2 reduction. For CeO2/BDD, Fig. 7a shows a markedly higher current in the presence of CO2 than in its absence. Fig. 7b, with an expanded current density scale, highlights a weak reduction peak at E = −0.65 V present only in CO2-saturated solution, which we ascribe to CO2 reduction at low overpotential. Such a peak was not recorded with CeO2/GC electrodes for which, in CO2-saturated solutions, at E < −0.8 V, voltammetric currents were higher than for CeO2/BDD.

The voltammetric response recorded in the PB (Fig. S7a, ESI†) was complicated by a reduction peak at around −0.9 V, seen both in the presence and in the absence of CO2. We ascribe that peak to the reduction of cerium phosphate formed by reaction of the CeIII present in the deposit with phosphate ions, in agreement with Cummings et al.58 who, using ceria deposits of different natures, observed a similar cerium phosphate reduction peak, though at higher potential. Fig. S7b† shows that a system due to CeIII/IV was observed also in CB, in agreement with Nagarale et al.67
Chronoamperograms were recorded during prolonged electrolyses, using CeO2/BDD and CeO2/GC electrodes prepared at −1.0 V. For both materials, the applied potential strongly affected the observed current–time dependence. Fig. 8 shows that, using CeO2/BDD, a progressive activation of the electrode was observed at −0.44 V vs. SHE; at −0.59 V, after an initial period of stability the current started to decay; at −0.74 V there was a rapid decay, for a few minutes, and then a slower steady decrease. Using CeO2/GC, rapid current decay was observed at −0.44 V, while electrolysis at −0.74 V caused a large, very noisy current, due to gas evolution.
 Fig. 8  Chronoamperograms registered during CO2 reduction at three different potentials (referenced to the SHE) in a CO2 saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solution on CeO2/BDD and CeO2/GC electrodes prepared at Edep = −1.0 V and Qdep = −0.02C cm−2. 
Fig. S8, ESI,† shows that electrolyses performed with CeO2/BDD at −0.44 V, using electrodes prepared at different potentials, and therefore with different compositions, showed very different current–time dependences. Instead of an activation, the electrode obtained at Edep = −2.0 V exhibited very poor stability, the reduction current falling almost to zero after ca. 10 h.
Focusing on formic acid production, the products in the liquid phase were analysed by ion chromatography after prolonged electrolysis (18–24 h) in order to collect enough products to perform reliable analysis. Fig. 9 highlights the effects of overpotential (calculated as η = Evs.SHE − EEq (CO2⇆HCOOH); with EEq (CO2/HCOOH) = −0.418 V at pH = 6.8) and shows that CeO2/BDD produced significant amounts of formic acid. Instead, bare BDD and CeO2/GC were both inactive, showing the essential role of both CeO2 and BDD in the electrocatalytic activity. The inactivity of CeO2/GC electrodes towards the CO2RR strongly suggests that in CeO2/BDD ceria acted essentially as a co-catalyst, adsorbing CO2 on oxygen vacancies, activating it for reduction by hydrogen-terminated BDD. Other volatile products in the liquid phase were analysed by SPME/GC–MS, which showed the formation of formaldehyde with a faradaic yield that increased with overpotential from 4–8% at η = 40 mV to 10–16% at η = 340 mV. Thus, formate was the main product at low overpotential but, by increasing η, formaldehyde was obtained either through the further reduction of adsorbed formate or via the concomitant reduction of CO2 through a different pathway. Formaldehyde was also detected on CeO2/GC electrodes (33–40% at η = 40 mV). Due to the presence of a buffered solution that prevented significant alkalinisation at the electrode surface, we can exclude the possibility that formate could be generated by a disproportionation of formaldehyde.64 At high overpotential, we observed traces of methanol that could not be quantified.
 Fig. 9  Overpotential dependence of the faradaic efficiency of CO2 reduction to formic acid, formaldehyde and hydrogen, measured with CeO2/BDD electrodes. 
The highest faradaic yield of formic acid (46 ± 8%) was obtained at very low overpotential (≈40 mV) with an electrode with a thin ceria layer (10–20 nm) deposited at −1.0 V. Comparison of Fig. 8 and 9 shows that the conditions that led to the highest efficiency were the same that guaranteed performance during long electrolyses.
The CeO2/BDD electrode prepared at −2.0 V was less efficient (22 ± 8%) and less stable. This result was probably associated with its higher Ce(OH)3 content.
The efficiency of formic acid production decreased upon increasing the overpotential, becoming ca. 0 at η > 0.3 V, where H2 production took over. Our equipment was only a little sensitive to CH4 and insensitive to CO. We speculate that CO was the other main product at 40 mV overpotential, as significant amounts of CH4 would have been detected.
The effect of the thickness of the CeO2 layers in CeO2/BDD electrodes on the CO2RR was also investigated. We found that, at each potential, currents obtained with electrodes bearing ceria films of increasing thickness were progressively lower. Such trend was independent of the Ce(OH)3 content in the film. We ascribe the relative inactivity of thicker films to their poorer conductivity, lower mechanical stability under operational conditions and slower diffusion of species to and from the electrode.
Conclusions
The cathodic deposition of ceria onto BDD with a base generation method and the application of CeO2/BDD as a cathode for CO2 reduction to formic acid have been studied. Using appropriate combinations of deposition bath composition, potential and deposition charge, accurate control over the properties of the ceria deposits was achieved. In particular, thin, compact, well-adhering films with negligible Ce(OH)3 content were obtained at moderately negative reduction potentials and with low deposition charges. Nanostructured CeO2/BDD electrodes sustained CO2 reduction for several hours, producing formic acid with good faradaic yield at very low overpotential (>40% at η ≈ 40 mV). CeO2/GC electrodes failed to produce formic acid, highlighting the synergic combination between BDD and CeO2. This suggests that ceria acted as a co-catalyst that adsorbed CO2 and activated it for reduction by hydrogen-terminated BDD.
A study of the effect of ceria thin layers electrochemically deposited on metals that are active towards CO2 reduction is in progress, to ascertain whether ceria may decrease the overpotential or induce increased selectivity.
