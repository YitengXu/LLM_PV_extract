1. Introduction
In recent years, flexible and wearable/portable devices, such as Apple watches, Samsung bracelets and Huawei Mate X, have been emerging, and they have brought tremendous use and convenience to our daily life. The rapid rise in these portable and wearable products has created a strong demand for indispensable energy storage devices (ESDs) that are compact, miniaturized, adaptable and mechanical flexible.1–3 Earlier research efforts were largely concentrated on 2D flexible ESDs, which were composed of essential functional components (e.g., nanometer-sized electrode materials, gel polymer electrolytes, highly flexible current collectors and other supporting elements), while they were constructed in a planar structure with a relatively large size and finite flexibility,4,5 which could not effectively satisfy the requirements of new generation flexible/wearable electronic devices. Compared with conventional 2D planar ESDs, 1D fiber-shaped ESDs possess several unique and fantastic features and prominent advantages:6–8 (i) fiber-shaped ESDs could be employed to assemble all kinds of highly flexible power sources/supplies owing to their superior miniaturization potential, outstanding flexibility, and great adaptability to deformation, offering diverse possibilities; (ii) fiber-shaped ESDs are well compatible with the present textile/fiber technologies. In common fabrics, yarn is an indispensable part. Fiber-shaped ESDs could serve as functional yarns to be woven into energy storage textiles; (iii) the issue of rather impermeable behaviour to air of common 2D planar structured ESDs could be resolved by the fabrics woven from fiber-shaped ESDs due to their air-permeability; (iv) an integration of fiber-shaped ESDs with other fibrous devices (e.g., self-powering generators, energy conversion, and functional sensors) into one single fiber entity gives rise to an all-in-one integrated system, which adds to new wearables and portable electronics. Therefore, more recently these fiber-shaped ESDs have attracted enormous research interest, leading to a huge expansion of publications/literature in very recent years.
For energy storage, although non-aqueous fiber-shaped ESDs show obviously higher/more-competitive energy density than their aqueous counterparts, the latter will be more realizable for a wider spectrum of practical applications when the overall performance, safety, cycle life and even cost are taken into consideration.9,10 Moreover, the high ionic conductivities of aqueous electrolytes (∼1 S cm−1) compared to those of non-aqueous electrolytes (∼1–10 mS cm−1) will facilitate high rate abilities, which are especially suitable for these quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs.11,12 Most importantly, the safety issue of non-aqueous ESDs, caused by flammable organic electrolytes, is essentially resolved. To date, fiber-shaped supercapacitors have been prospering,13–20 and other promising candidates, fiber-shaped aqueous batteries,21–28 including metal–alkaline batteries and metal-ion batteries with high performance, have also been reported in recent years.
Although there have been a couple of review articles published recently on fiber-shaped ESDs,29–43 a timely and thoroughly comprehensive overview of the current progress of quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs (e.g., aqueous supercapacitors and aqueous batteries), together with their future prospects in the coming years, is essential to expand the horizons for even deeper understanding and aiding even more rapid advances towards flexibles and wearables in the future. Hence, in this review, we will look at them from the angles of design principles, recent progress in both materials and devices, system integration, and further challenges/opportunities, focusing on aqueous supercapacitors and batteries. On top of energy storage, there will be integration with other functionalities, as has been demonstrated more recently, such as sensors and energy harvesting, into the same fiber-shaped.
2. The principles of quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs
Compared to flexible 2D planar devices, the requirements for the fabrication of high performance 1D fiber-shaped ESDs are more challenging. The essential components/elements of fiber electrodes, quasi-solid-state electrolytes (e.g., gel electrolytes) and separators (if necessary), as well as other functional elements, must be compatible with the flexible fiber-shaped architecture, and the ESDs thus fabricated should have the ability to adapt to various repeated and frequent deformations (e.g., bending, twisting and stretching) without remarkable loss in electrochemical performance, mechanical stability and designed functionalities. In addition, short circuiting must be prevented under long-term service and repeated deformation conditions. Thus, the achievement of an overall high performance for fiber-shaped ESDs is dependent on the function and efficiency of each and every component and effective device configuration. In this following section, the fiber electrode and quasi-solid-state electrolyte will be looked into first, followed by a discussion on device configurations for the fabrication of quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs, together with the mechanical properties that are involved.
2.1 Fiber electrodes
Fiber electrodes, as the key component to realizing high-performance fiber-shaped ESDs, usually consist of two parts: a current collector for electronic/charge transport and a supporting substrate for active materials/elements. Simultaneously, they are required to be able to accommodate various deformations under the premise of relatively high conductivity and mechanical durability. To this end, the two main parameters to be considered for the selection of fiber electrodes are high electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility. Besides, the interfacial adhesion, mass density, specific surface area and production cost should also be taken into account. Generally, metal wires with unexceptionable electrical conductivity are heavy and rigid, while lightweight polymeric fibers with good flexibility are less conductive.44,45 By contrast, carbon-based fibers/nanofibers (e.g., carbon nanotube fibers and graphene fibers) have great potential as free-standing active materials or current collectors in fiber-shaped ESDs owing to their favorable conductivity, relatively low mass density, high tensile strength and high surface area.46–48

2.1.1 Metal wires. 
Due to their 1D configuration and excellent electrical conductivities, metal wires have been widely explored as fiber electrodes for aqueous ESDs. On the one hand, several types of bare metal wires (e.g., Zn wires) can be directly used as the fiber electrodes for fiber-shaped aqueous Zn-based batteries due to their intrinsic electrochemical properties.44,45 For example, Lu and co-workers reported a fiber-shaped NiO@Ni//Zn aqueous battery (Fig. 1a),44 where a Zn fiber anode is wound closely by the NiO@Ni fiber cathode. Such a quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped NiO@Ni//Zn battery not only delivered a peak energy density of 0.67 mW h cm−3 (based on the entire device), but also possessed an unexpectedly high stability (99.6% capacity retention after 10000 cycles). On the other hand, metal wires with favorable work functions,49,50 such as nanoporous Ni wires with high specific surface areas, obtained by electrodeposition and dealloying methods, are usually used to load active materials.49 A nanoporous Au wire was also developed by a similar method, followed by depositing MnO2 nanoflowers to obtain a MnO2@NPG wire electrode (Fig. 1b),50 which was further used as the positive electrode in the assembly of quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped asymmetric supercapacitors.

Although great advancement has been made in fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs based on metal wires, the low flexibility, high mass density and limited electrochemical activity of metal wires impede their wide application. Thus, coating a nanosized metal layer on lightweight and flexible polymer/carbon fibers has been recently explored for the replacement of metal wires.51–55 Zheng and co-workers first reported the development of low-cost “graphene@Ni-coated cotton yarns” composite electrodes that lead to high-performance quasi-solid-state supercapacitors (Fig. 1c).51 In this hierarchical composite electrode, Ni-coated cotton fibers are used as lightweight, flexible and highly conductive current collectors of the electrodes, while reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanoflakes uniformly coated on the metallic fibers offer excellent electrochemical capacitance of the electrodes. In our previous work,24 we have electrodeposited Zn nanosheets on a highly conductive CNT fiber (Zn NSs@CNT fiber) to replace the conventional compact Zn wire for assembling fiber-shaped quasi-solid-state aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) (Fig. 1d and e). The Zn array nanostructures not only provide a short ion diffusion length, large surface area, and more active sites, which are beneficial to rapid and reversible Zn/Zn2+ redox kinetics, giving rise to high-rate capability, but also alleviate the Zn dendrite growth and thus are favorable to enhanced long-cycle life.


2.1.2 Polymeric fibers. 
Due to their outstanding mechanical flexibility and high specific stiffness and strength, conducting polymer fibers that are nano- to micro-meters in sizes have recently attracted an increasing amount of attention in such applications such as energy storage and harvesting, sensing and actuation.7,56,57 It should be noted that a mechanically supporting material is usually required to maintain the fibrous shape in the preparation process of conducting polymer fibers.56,57 For example, Wang and co-workers reported a fiber-shaped supercapacitor based on wetspun free-standing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) fibers, where a coagulation bath with CaCl2 in aqueous solution was developed for preparing the PEDOT:PSS fibers. These PEDOT:PSS fibers with good mechanical properties can be easily woven, sewed, knotted and braided as fiber-shaped supercapacitor electrodes.56 Subsequently, Zhao and co-workers presented a novel microfluidic strategy for generating bioinspired helical PEDOT:PSS microfibers, also by injecting PEDOT:PSS solution into a CaCl2 coagulation bath, with controllable conformations for different applications.57 Although there has been steady progress in preparing free-standing PEDOT:PSS conducting polymer fibers, it still remains a big challenge to obtain meter-long fiber electrodes from pure conducting polymers, because of the limited flexibility. To this end, conducting polymer fiber electrodes are usually fabricated by coating/depositing conducting polymers onto commercial elastic fibers (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers and nylon fibers)58–60 or hybridizing with other conducting fibers (e.g., CNT fibers).61–64 Significantly, such conducting polymer fibers were flexible, stretchable, weavable and knottable, and were further used to assemble fiber-shaped quasi-solid-state supercapacitors and batteries.
Polyaniline coated PET yarns (PANI@PET yarns) were fabricated through a modified coating process by Kim and co-workers, which not only presented an excellent electrical conductive, but preserved the original strength and flexibility of PET fibers, leading to an excellent electrochemical performance and high mechanical flexibility of the fiber-shaped supercapacitors based on PANI@PET yarns.59 Other conducting polymer fiber electrodes were also prepared by a continuous vapor polymerization of pyrrole, where nylon58 and plastic yarns7 were used as the fibrous skeleton. Simultaneously, by hybridizing with CNTs,62–64 the resulting PANI@CNT composite fibers have been used to fabricate fiber and textile ESDs.


2.1.3 Carbon-based fibers. 
Carbon-based fibers are most commonly used as active materials or current collectors to fabricate fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs, due to their apparent features of a relatively low mass density and simultaneously excellent tensile strength, a large specific surface area, high electronic conductivity, low cost, high safety and a wide working temperature range. Till now, several types of carbon-based fibers have been explored, including carbon fibers,65,66 CNT fibers,67,68 graphene fibers69,70 and their composite/hybrid fibers71 (Fig. 1f and g). Furthermore, multifunctional fiber electrodes can be easily obtained by combining/hybridizing carbon materials with functional polymer fibers.
CNT fibers, an 1D macro-assembly of CNTs, integrate such desirable properties as high mechanical/physical flexibility, outstanding electrical conductivities, a desirable porosity/surface area and novel corrosion/oxidation resistivity, which make them a very promising candidate (active materials or current collectors) for constructing fiber-shaped ESDs. Note that CNTs when employed in composites as disordered active materials usually deliver low electrochemical performance. To this end, on the one hand, Peng and co-workers pioneered and reported a host of studies on fiber-shaped ESDs by using aligned CNT fibers and sheets which would more effectively extend the physicochemical properties of individual CNTs to macroscopic materials, due to the anisotropic features of vertically aligned CNT arrays matching well the 1D structure of fiber electrodes. As shown in Fig. 1h, a coaxial-fiber electrical double layer capacitor (EDLC) had been designed and assembled from aligned CNT fibers and sheets, which functioned as two electrodes with a polymer gel electrolyte sandwiched between them.72 The unique coaxial structure provides fast transportation of ions/electrons between the two electrodes with a maximum capacitance of 32.09 F cm−3. On the other hand, Ray H. Baughman and co-workers first reported a bi-scrolling method to spin porous multi-functional CNT fibers/yarns, where a low concentration of strong hosts guarantees flexibility, durability, and weavability.67 Subsequently, they further demonstrated weavable, sewable, knottable and braidable CNT fibers/yarns that function as a class of high performance electrodes of fiber-shaped supercapacitors with a high volumetric capacitance of 179 F cm−3.68 To further improve the performance of CNT fiber electrodes, CNT composite/hybrid fibers, such as ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC)/CNT,73 PANI/CNT,74 PPy/CNT,75 and MnO2/CNT fibers,76 were prepared for fiber-shaped supercapacitors or batteries. Simultaneously, as a promising current collector, in situ growing/preparing active materials on the surface of CNT fibers has been widely reported.13–26 In one of our previous reports,13 we first designed an Au-MnOx@CoNi@CNT fiber electrode (Au-nanoparticle doped-MnOx@CoNi-alloy core/shell nanocomposite on CNT fibers, Fig. 1i and j), aiming to boost its charge/discharge rate by taking advantage of the superconductive CoNi alloy network and the greatly enhanced conductivity of the Au doped MnOx active materials. Then, a quasi-solid-state coaxial-fiber supercapacitor was made by wrapping this fiber with a holey graphene paper (HGP), which not only exhibited excellent performance at rates up to 10 V s−1, but also delivered a high volumetric energy density of ≈15.1 mW h cm−3.
Graphene fibers are macroscopic 1D assemblies made of individual units of 2D graphene sheets and its derivatives (e.g., RGO) by either wet spinning or dimensionally confined hydrothermal methods.77–79 Their unique geometry enables the same advantages as graphene, including a low weight, high specific surface area, remarkable mechanical and electrical properties, good chemical stability, and ease of functionalization, thus qualifying them as prospective active materials (or current collectors) for fiber-shaped ESDs. For example, Qu and co-workers reported a unique all-graphene core/sheath fiber, where the graphene fibber core is wrapped with a sheath of the 3D porous graphene network (denoted as 3DG@GF, Fig. 2k).46 The intrinsically high electronic conductivity and mechanical flexibility of the graphene fiber core and the highly exposed specific surface area of the 3D graphene framework are well combined with 3DG@GF, thus providing appreciable merits as flexible, lightweight electrodes for high-performance fiber-based supercapacitors. Similarly to CNT fibers, graphene composite/hybrid fibers were also explored by incorporating other active materials such as CNTs,71 PEDOT:PSS,80 and PPy.81 A hierarchically structured composite fiber made of an interconnected network of aligned CNTs with interposed RGO sheets was first reported by Chen and co-workers.71 The resultant CNT/graphene fibers formed mesoporous structures with a large specific surface area (396 m2 g−1) and high electrical conductivity (102 S cm−1) and thus exhibited a high volumetric capacity as high as 305 F cm−3.

Compared with CNT and graphene fibers, carbon fibers could be very promising in terms of the potential of wide industrial availability and lower cost. However, carbon fibers usually show relativity low electrochemical performance, and further modification is needed in most cases. For instance, hydrated ruthenium dioxide (RuO2·xH2O)82 and MoS2 (ref. 83) were coated on pure carbon fibers, in order to enhance the electrochemical capacitance.

2.2 Quasi-solid-state aqueous electrolytes
For energy storage, the choice of suitable electrolytes is another critical component of fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs, as they are not only related to the electrochemically stable working potential, ionic conductivity and electrochemical reaction mechanism, but also provide the pathway for the transport/migration of ions between the anode and cathode. On the one hand, although the working potential of aqueous electrolyte(s) is normally limited by the intrinsically characteristic voltage of water splitting (1.23 V) including the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), they have their own uniqueness and merits such as low cost, high safety, easy construction and environmental friendliness. As has been well known, non-aqueous batteries (e.g., lithium-ion batteries) usually suffer from safety problems because of their flammable organic solvents (e.g., ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate) and toxic constituent elements (e.g., PF6−), which need rather strict and complicated construction/fabrication processes. On the other hand, it is difficult to load directly liquid electrolytes along a fiber-shaped ESD (usually assembled in a heat-shrinkable plastic tube), and the short circuiting and leakage issues become protruding when these fiber-shaped devices experience various deformations. Thus, the strategy of using quasi-solid-state electrolytes (gel electrolytes) has been developed to overcome the issues of conventional liquid electrolytes and meet the requirements of electrolytes for fiber-shaped ESDs. Some of these gel electrolytes possess excellent physical flexibility and stability, desirable electrochemical properties and high mechanical integrity, and can serve as both an electrolyte and a separator simultaneously to reduce the device volume. Furthermore, gel electrolytes, in some cases, can also improve the electrochemical stability by inhibiting the dendrite growth of metal anodes (e.g., Zn).
Gel electrolytes, normally consisting of ionic conductive additives (e.g., alkalis or acids and metallic salts) and quasi-solid-state polymer matrixes (e.g., poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)), include hydrogel electrolytes with physical cross-linking or chemical cross-linking networks and the case without cross-linking. Niu and co-workers have given a detailed introduction on these three types of gel electrolytes, where the tightly linked structure and the outstanding mechanical properties are good for extending their applications in aqueous ESDs.80 Although great progress has been achieved in gel electrolytes for quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs, at least three challenges still remain with conventional liquid electrolytes, namely: (i) the relatively lower ionic conductivity and inferior electrode/electrolyte interfaces lead to an unsatisfactory rate ability and a low power density; (ii) an improvement in the mechanical properties of gel electrolytes can sacrifice their ionic conductivities, as the polymer framework nanostructure will be reinforced; (iii) they are also not feasible at high working voltage. To overcome the above-mentioned concerns, a promising approach is required to explore gel electrolytes with exceptional ionic conductivity, increased mechanical properties and high operating voltage by selecting novel polymer chains and suitable metallic salts. Recently, some novel quasi-solid-state electrolytes (e.g., poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) cross-linked with Al2O3 nanoparticles,84 poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate-poly(vinyl carbonate-co-butyl acrylate), PEGDA-P(VCA-co-BA) with a 3D crosslinked network85 and monolithic heterojunctions (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide-ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate) (LiTFSI-ETPTA) with Al2O3 nanoparticles86) have been successfully employed for flexible ESDs. For example, Tang and co-workers reported a flexible sodium-based dual-ion battery, based on a quasi-solid-state electrolyte, consisting of PVDF-HFP in three-dimensions with Al2O3 nanoparticles, which shows a porous 3D structure with obviously improved ionic conductivity up to ≈1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1, promoting fast ionic migration of both anions and cations.84 The superior flexibility and wide working temperature range (from −20 to 70 °C) of the as-prepared quasi-solid-state electrolytes were demonstrated for this battery, indicating its potential for high-performance flexible ESDs.
2.3 Device configurations
The device configurations playing vital roles as the basic structures can help obtain enhanced electrochemical performance and endow fiber-shaped ESDs with additional smart functional properties. Generally speaking, the basic fiber-shaped ESD configurations can be classified into three categories, namely parallel, twisted, and coaxial structures (Fig. 2a).87 In this section, the advantages and disadvantages for each of these device configurations will be summarized and discussed.

2.3.1 Parallel structures. 
A parallel configuration can be fabricated by combining two fiber electrodes closely in parallel to a separator or a gel polymer electrolyte, which has been known as an uncomplicated, most straightforward way to obtain fiber-shaped ESDs. For example, Chen and co-workers reported a typical parallel-fiber supercapacitor with a high energy density of 6.3 mW h cm−3,71 where two CNT/graphene composite fibers were mounted onto a flexible polyester (PET) substrate using a H3PO4/PVA gel electrolyte. Interestingly, the parallel structure enables such parallel-fiber ESDs to be easily scaled up by integrating more fiber devices in series or parallel on the planar substrate to satisfy high-voltage energy and power demands in practical applications. Indeed, improvements in the output working voltage and discharging capacity were obtained when three fiber-shaped supercapacitors were connected in series and in parallel, respectively (Fig. 2b),71 demonstrating the excellent stability of the integrated parallel-fiber devices.
Although the fiber-shaped ESDs with a parallel structure have the simplest structure, external substrates (e.g., planar substrates and plastic packaging shells) are needed to hold the device together, which could restrict the wide application of parallel-fiber supercapacitors in wearable electronics. In addition, with the parallel structure, fiber-shaped ESDs have a limited interface between the fiber electrodes and the gel electrolytes and therefore a lower mass loading of active materials, and thus the overall performance can be largely limited. Thus, fiber-shaped ESDs with other structures are developed to increase both their mechanical flexibility and electrochemical performance.


2.3.2 Twisted structures. 
Fiber-shaped ESDs with twisted structures are usually constructed by twisting/twining two or more fiber electrodes together, filled with a gel electrolyte between them, or with the addition of a separating fiber if necessary. Note that it is necessary to pre-coat a layer of a quasi-solid-state gel electrode onto the surface of each fiber electrode to avoid short circuits. Compared with fiber SCs with parallel structures, twisted-fiber ESDs do not need a planar substrate and they show an architecture similar to those of fabric lines, and thus appear to be extremely appropriate for portable/wearable electronics, and can readily be woven/knitted into scale-up energy storage textiles. In one of our previous studies, twisted-fiber aqueous rechargeable batteries were successfully fabricated with an admirable energy density of 30.61 mW h cm−3 and superior mechanical flexibility and could be further weaved into flexible power textiles to illustrate their outstanding weavability (Fig. 2c).21
For fiber-shaped ESDs with twisted structures, one of the major issues is the delicate twisting of two (or more) fiber electrodes that make twisted-fiber ESDs easily separated/detached from each other under bending, squeezing and stretching conditions. Simultaneously, repeated/frequent deformations will necessarily increase the internal resistance between the two electrodes, resulting in performance degradation and a short service life for twisted-fiber ESDs.87 In addition, if the separator or quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte fails, the direct contact areas may tend to cause a short circuit or lead to serious leakage currents (performance degradation). To thoroughly avoid the short circuit, Zou and co-workers developed a novel strategy (Fig. 2d),88 where a non-conducting spacer wire was wrapped onto one of the fiber electrodes to guarantee the effective separation of the two fiber electrodes. The change in distances between the two fiber electrodes along the fiber length is another main issue of twisted-fiber ESDs. The distance between the two fiber electrodes would influence the internal resistance and charge transport, which are crucial for fiber-shaped ESDs. Encouragingly, such a concern can be effectively prevented by the design and fabrication of coaxial-fiber ESDs to get improved performance.


2.3.3 Coaxial structures. 
A coaxial-fiber ESD exhibits a multilayered structure, consisting of a core fiber electrode and an outer layer electrode with a polymer gel sandwiched between them. This configuration usually assembled by a layer-by-layer procedure enables a core/shell structure in which all the elements (active materials, gel electrolyte and separator if necessary) share the same axis. The architecture of a coaxial-fiber ESD, in a way, is similar to the sandwiched architecture in a planar ESD. Compared with parallel and twisted configurations, coaxial-fiber ESDs offer a closer, larger and more efficient interfacial area between the two electrodes and their intimate contact which facilitates a high mass loading of the active material and a more steady architecture to undergo frequent bending. As presented in Fig. 2e,14 in our previous studies, we reported a coaxial-fiber asymmetric supercapacitor, which was fabricated by wrapping aligned CNT composite sheets onto VN@C NWAs@CNT fibers. The cross section of the as-fabricated coaxial-fiber supercapacitor was analyzed using SEM (Fig. 2f), where two concentric cycles were obviously seen from the cross section, corresponding to the inner VN@C NWA@CNT negative electrode and the outer CNT composite sheet positive electrode. The coaxial structure could make full use of the effective surface area and decrease the contact resistance between the two electrodes, leading to a high areal energy density of 96.07 μW h cm−2 for the resultant supercapacitor. In addition, Peng and co-workers reported a bioinspired coaxial-fiber supercapacitor by mimicking the in-series structure of electrocytes in electric eels and obtained a 1000 V output voltage (Fig. 2h),89 which could be further increased to 6.7 × 106 V m−1 by an optimized lithographic method. More significantly, the as-fabricated coaxial-fiber supercapacitors could be integrated with solar cells to realize a high-performance self-powered system with high output voltages incorporating the in-series structure.
Although coaxial-fiber ESDs could exhibit much enhanced electrochemical performance, it is technically difficult to precisely control the assembling process of multiple-layer ESD fibers due to the high length-to-diameter ratios, leading to restricted mechanical flexibility, thereby disastrously limiting their manufacturing scalability. For all three devices, optimizing the applicability of each element and holding the long-term durability of the whole device are two indispensable prerequisites for developing portable/wearable fiber-shaped ESDs with superior electrochemical performance. In addition, it is always important to prevent the short circuit of the two electrodes in order to achieve an effective operation of fiber-shaped ESDs.

2.4 Mechanical properties of fiber-shaped ESDs
For fiber-shaped ESDs, the structural wearability/integrity (e.g., flexibility/bendability, weavability/knittability, stretchability/scalability, washability and thermal comfortability) and stability in electrochemical performance (e.g., under various mechanical deformation conditions) are of two key factors for their applications. Some of these fiber-shaped ESDs can be highly weavable/knittable and assembled into energy storage textiles. Nevertheless, there is still no complete set of standardized guidelines/criteria established/unified to quantify these performance aspects, which presents difficulty to make a fair comparison of various research data reported. Furthermore, the existing testing methods/procedures are rather rough or even inconclusive for assessing the mechanical properties of fiber-shaped ESDs. Thus, in the following sections, we will examine the mechanical properties and measurement methods, in order to assess their mechanical characteristics comprehensively.

2.4.1 Flexibility/bendability. 
Bending is one of the most common mechanical deformations of fiber-shaped ESDs. Repeated bending can compromise the structural wearability/integrity and electrochemical performance stability of 1D ESDs. For example, Zhi and co-workers recently reported a method to describe the bending state and to assess the bending tolerance of flexible fiber-shaped ESDs,90 where the method was applied to acquire the key bending parameters of fiber-shaped ESDs, by winding them around a cylindrical object with given diameters. To advance the practical application of fiber-shaped ESDs, a minimum of 5000 bending cycles are recommended to simulate real wearing conditions. In addition to electrochemical performance measurements, the tensile strength, indicating the fiber's resistance to a high load without failure, of fiber-shaped ESDs should also be tested, to assess their structural wearability/integrity comprehensively after repeated bending.


2.4.2 Weavability/knittability. 
An obvious advantage of fiber-shaped ESDs is their applicability as energy storage textiles, made by commercially available textile manufacturing machines. To this end, it is necessary to have highly weavable/knittable fiber-shaped ESDs with a superior tensile strength and excellent bending tolerance. In addition, some other characteristics, including the diameter, surface roughness and evenness, also affect the weavability/knittablity.91 Firstly, bending strains faced by fibers during textile manufacturing are proportional to their diameters. Simultaneously, the addition of electrode materials, a gel electrolyte, and encapsulation layers would obviously increase the overall diameter of fiber-shaped ESDs, which reduces their flexibility. Therefore, the overall diameter of 1D SCs should be carefully controlled to enable a good overall knittability/weavability. Secondly, surface smoothness is also a relevant parameter in enabling the fiber-shaped ESD surface to go through the manufacturing process without jamming. Finally, fiber-shaped ESDs should also have a high degree of evenness, which can be tested as a variation in mass per unit length.


2.4.3 Stretchability/scalability. 
To guarantee wearing comfort, fiber-shaped ESDs or energy storage textiles made from fiber-shaped ESDs should be stretchable/scalability, and adaptable to frequent movements imposed by the human body. However, compared with traditional textiles, commonly used carbon-based fibers (e.g., CNT fibers and RGO fibers) and metal wires (e.g., Zn wires and Ni wires) in fiber-shaped ESDs have insufficient elongation properties. Moreover, electrode materials, a separator (if applicable), a gel electrolyte, and encapsulation layers are also integrated with fibers/yarns to form intercalated structures/architectures with multiple layers, which could compromise the stretchability/scalability of the as-fabricated fiber-shaped ESDs. To this end, two strategies, namely using elastic fibers and buckled/spring-like structures,91 have been employed to improve the stretchability/scalability of fiber-shaped ESDs.


2.4.4 Washability and thermal comfortability. 
When integrated with textiles or electronics, fiber-shaped ESDs could occasionally become wet by splashes of water or experience of rains during daily application. Thus, the waterproof capability (washability) of the as-fabricated 1D ESDs is also a key factor for wearable/portable applications. Unlike traditional packaging, fiber-shaped ESDs encapsulated with polymer gel or Eco-flex silicone can deliver an excellent waterproof performance, while retaining a superior flexibility and stretchability. In addition, developing fabric-based textiles with high thermal stability and comfortability is undoubtedly another demand for wearable and portable technologies. Especially for triboelectric textiles or fiber-shaped EDSs, electrochemical performance decay under changeable thermal conditions on the body surface can be a major problem that still needs to be resolved. For example, Wang and co-workers reported an all-fiber tribo-ferroelectric synergistic e-textile with outstanding thermal comfortability, which is useful for complicated real-life situations.92

3. Advances of quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs
The rapid development of portable/wearable electronics has motivated a great search for flexible ESDs, especially for fiber-shaped ESDs with a tiny volume, outstanding flexibility, extraordinary stitchability, and high performance with comfortability and stability, in order to effectively power portable/wearable electronics and make sure wireless communications more convenient.93,94 Thus, the advances in quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs, focusing on aqueous supercapacitors and aqueous batteries, are summarized with a brief timeline of their evolution in Table 1.

3.1 Quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous supercapacitors
Due to the high power density, short charging/discharging time and long cycle life, supercapacitors have attracted huge efforts in the past decade. According to the working mechanism (Fig. 3a),95,96 they can store energy by: (i) reversible ion adsorption at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces (electrical double layer capacitance, EDLC) and/or (ii) redox reaction at the vicinity (a few nanometers) of the electrode surfaces (pseudocapacitance). Similar to their planar counterparts, fiber-shaped supercapacitors also can be divided into EDLCs and pseudocapacitors.68,97 Note that some fiber electrode materials are also investigated in a three-electrode electrochemical cell/system without assembling them into a two-electrode supercapacitor/device, which are out of the scope of this review.

3.1.1 Fiber-shaped aqueous electrical double layer capacitors. 
The capacitance of EDLCs is generally determined by the specific surface area of electrodes. To this end, carbon-based fibers are the most commonly used electrodes for fiber-shaped EDLCs, as they usually exhibit the desired features of a large surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, light weight, easy of handling and low cost, and thermal and chemical stability in both acidic and alkaline aqueous solutions. Till now, two main types of carbon-based fibers have been used in fiber-shaped EDLCs, including CNT fibers and graphene fibers.
3.1.1.1 Fiber-shaped aqueous EDLCs based on CNT fibers. 
CNTs can effectively act as prospective electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their unique 1D structure with high electronic conductivity that promotes fast charge transport as well as excellent mechanical strength/flexibility and light weight. Several methods have been developed to produce CNT fibers,98–102 which mainly include wet spinning from a CNT solution, dry spinning from a vertically aligned CNT array grown on a substrate, spinning from a CNT aerogel and twisting/rolling from a CNT film. Ray H. Baughman and co-workers first reported quasi-solid-state twisted-fiber supercapacitors based on CNT fibers in 2003,101 which were further woven into a flexible textile, indicating a potential electronic-textile application of fiber-shaped supercapacitors. However, due to their lower capacitance and energy density (a capacitance of 5 F g−1 and an energy density of 0.6 W h kg−1 at 1.0 V, Fig. 3b) ascribed to the limited specific surface area, the promising concept of fiber-shaped supercapacitors did not draw extensive attention for a few years. Therefore, various strategies were explored to ameliorate the electrochemical performance of CNF fiber-based fiber-shaped supercapacitors, such as compositing/hybridizing CNTs with other carbon materials. As shown in Fig. 3c–e, a composite fiber electrode containing CNTs and activated carbon (AC@CNT) was prepared by using a wet-spinning method and a high-temperature thermal treatment.7 The as-obtained AC@CNT fibers possess abundant mesopores, which were more beneficial to the transport/storage of charges/ions. Furthermore, the AC on the surface of CNT bunches could not only offer a relatively high specific surface area of electrode active materials but also act as a binder between the crossed CNT bunches to increase the composite fiber electrode's electrical conductivity. As a result, the as-fabricated parallel-fiber EDLC exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance, including a high capacitance of 74.6 F g−1 (48.5 F cm−3) and a high energy density of 3.7 mW h cm−3. A similar strategy has also been used by Peng and co-workers to obtain an ordered mesoporous carbon@CNT (OMC@CNT) composite fiber (Fig. 3f and h) for a twisted-fiber EDLC, in which skeleton CNTs were aligned along the axial direction and OMC interconnected among the aligned CNTs.73
Due to the high tensile strength and excellent mechanical flexibility and stability of CNTs, some functional fiber-shaped supercapacitors (e.g., stretchable,10,103–107 electrochromic,64 shape-memory108 and self-healable109 fiber-shaped supercapacitors) assembled from CNT fibers have been developed to meet the application requirement in portable/wearable electronics. Among them, high-performance stretchable fiber-shaped EDLCs are highly demanded to power these stretchable/“soft” electronics that can maintain unchanged properties even under a high tensile strain or large deformation. For example, Peng and co-workers designed an elastic supercapacitor by assembling two spring-like CNT fibers in parallel (Fig. 4a).10 Such a CNT fiber spring was made to consist of twisted aligned CNTs with uniform coiled loops, which endowed the fiber electrode with a high stretchability (released up to 300%). As a result, the as-fabricated stretchable supercapacitors could be successfully stretched by 100% (Fig. 4b and c),10 which enables promising applications in electronic textiles. Furthermore, they have reported a shape-memory, coaxial-fiber supercapacitor (SCSC) assembled from CNT sheet composite fibers (winding aligned CNT sheets on a shape-memory polyurethane fiber, Fig. 4d).108 As expected, despite their high flexibility and stretchability, the deformed shapes under stretching and bending could be “frozen” and successfully recovered to the primitive state when required. More interestingly, their electrochemical performance is well preserved during deformation under the deformed state and after the recovery.

3.1.1.2 Fiber-shaped aqueous EDLCs based on graphene fibers. 
As has been well known, graphene or graphene oxide (a derivative of graphene) is a typical 2D carbon monolayer composed of all-sp2-hybridized carbons with some fascinating properties, including a high surface area (up to 2675 m−2 g−1), excellent electrical conductivity and outstanding chemical/physical stability, and was also demonstrated as a promising active material for planar EDLCs.110–112 Since 2013, graphene fibers have also been widely explored for fiber-shaped aqueous EDLCs,113–117 which greatly enriched the family of fiber-shaped ESDs. Fiber-shaped EDLCs based on graphene fibers were first designed by Shi and co-workers, by using electrochemically deposited RGO sheets on an Au wire as the fiber electrode (Fig. 5a–c). They delivered a specific capacitance of 11.4 μF cm−1 and a long cycle life (94% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles).113 Considering the generally high cost and low flexibility of RGO@Au fibers, Wei and co-workers replaced them with wet-spun graphene fibers, which are mechanically strong and favorably flexible to successfully assemble a parallel-fiber EDLC (Fig. 5d and e).114 Due to the high specific surface area of the nanoporous graphene-based active material and the uniform alignment of graphene sheets along the fiber axis, the as-fabricated device showed a higher specific capacitance of 13.5 mF cm−1 and an excellent cycling stability. The capacitance shows no obvious decrease even after 5000 bending cycles with a 180° bending angle (Fig. 5f). Since then, fiber-shaped EDLCs based on graphene fibers, especially modified graphene fibers (e.g., chemical/atomic doping), have sustained to draw research interest as indicated by the growing annual publications/literature on this topic. For example, as shown in Fig. 5g, Yao and co-workers developed a twisted-fiber EDLC based on Ar-plasma-treated graphene fibers. Both DFT calculations and experimental results demonstrated that the Ar plasma treatment could efficiently remove the oxygen-containing groups of the graphene fibers and improve their conductivity, leading to an ultrafast frequency response, a short resistor–capacitor time constant and excellent cycle stability of the as-fabricated twisted-fiber EDLC (Fig. 5h and i).118

Compared with CNT fibers that are composed of 1D CNT units, a graphene one is formed from 2D microscopic graphene sheets or its derivatives (e.g., RGO) stacked in the fiber axial direction. Consequently, most of the graphene fibers reported only have a relatively low specific surface area of 50–400 m2 g−1, due to the irreversible agglomeration of graphene sheets, leading to unsatisfactory capacitances and relatively low charge/discharge rates. In this regard, on the one hand, a rational design of 3D architectures produced from fiber spinning can effectively provide conductive, highly porous 3D networks for obtaining multifunctional fiber-shaped electrodes. For example, Wallace and co-workers demonstrated a highly porous RGO fiber by taking advantage of the inherent soft self-assembly properties of ultra-large GO liquid crystalline dispersions (Fig. 5j), which not only showed an extraordinarily high specific surface area (2210 m2 g−1) and excellent electrical conductivity (2508 ± 632 S m−1), but also maintained superb mechanical stability.119 The as-prepared RGO fiber possessed an open framework architecture with a continuous ion transport network, resulting in a high specific capacitance of 409 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an outstanding rate ability (56 F g−1 at 100 A g−1), when they were further used to assemble a parallel-fiber EDLC. Similarly, a 3D graphene network can be deposited on graphene fibers by an electrochemical method and this 3D framework can also partially solve the issue of restacking and aggregation of graphene sheets.46 On the other hand, the hierarchical design induced the graphene fibers to form an interconnected mesoporous nanostructure by combining 1D CNTs in the preparation process and has been demonstrated as an effective method to ameliorate the above-mentioned problem.71,120–122 For example, Gao and co-workers proposed a coaxial wet-spinning assembly approach to spin polyelectrolyte-wrapped RGO/CNT core/sheath composite fibers, which are used directly as safe electrodes to assemble fiber-shaped supercapacitors (Fig. 5k and l).120 The incorporation of CNTs onto the surfaces of RGO in the composite fibers not only separates the adjacent RGO sheets and hence increases the specific area of the fibers, but also enhances the conductivity of the RGO fiber. As a result, the as-assembled twisted-fiber EDLCs showed a specific capacitance of 158 F cm−3 and a high energy density of 3.5 mW h cm−3. Furthermore, a cloth fiber-shaped EDLC superior to commercial capacitors is interwoven from two individual 40 cm-long core/sheath composite fibers.


3.1.2 Fiber-shaped aqueous pseudocapacitors. 
Compared with carbon materials, pseudocapacitive active materials, such as metal oxides/hydroxides and conductive polymers, can offer much higher specific capacitances (C), because of the participation of multi-electron redox reactions (surface redox and interaction) within the working potential window. In addition, pseudocapacitive electrodes can also be used to assemble asymmetric supercapacitors with an extended operating voltage (V), which leads to enhanced energy and power densities (E = 1/2CV2 and P = V2/4RESR, where RESR is the equivalent series resistance of the device). Thus, to enhance the overall performance of fiber-shaped EDLCs, pseudocapacitive active materials have been explored for fiber-shaped pseudocapacitors (PCs) including symmetric pseudocapacitors (SPCs) and asymmetric pseudocapacitors (APCs). Generally, those pseudocapacitive active materials are normally coated/grown on a metal wire (such as a Ni wire) and/or carbon fiber current collector (such as CNT fibers or graphene) to realize high-performance fiber-shaped PCs.
3.1.2.1 Fiber-shaped aqueous symmetric pseudocapacitors. 
Owing to their controllable nanosizes and nanoshapes and good redox properties, transition metal oxides/hydroxides (MnO2, Fe2O3, Co3O4, NiCo2O4, Ni(OH)2, Co(OH)2, etc.) and conductive polymers (PPy, PANI, PEDOT:PSS, etc.) with higher specific capacitance have been widely explored as active materials for fiber-shaped PCs.7,62,123–129 Note that pseudocapacitive active materials can store energy not only faradaically but also electrostatically, as discussed in a previous review.129 In one of the pioneering studies, Wang and co-workers reported twisted-fiber symmetric pseudocapacitors (SPCs), which were assembled by twisting a flexible poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plastic wire surface decorated with ZnO nanowires around a Kevlar fiber covered with Au-coated ZnO nanowires in a PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte (Fig. 6a).8 Although their electrochemical performance in this work is not as good as some of those reported in recent studies, this pioneering work successfully opened up a new research field on fiber-shaped supercapacitors based on pseudocapacitive active materials. To further improve the overall performance of fiber-shaped SPCs, Thomas and co-workers designed coaxial-fiber SPCs based on a MnO2@AuPd@CuO core/shell nanocomposite fiber electrode (Fig. 6b–f),123 which not only showed outstanding cycling stability of 99% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, but also delivered a high energy density of 0.55 mW h cm−3 and a high power density of 0.413 W cm−3. The superior performance of coaxial-fiber SPCs was mainly attributed to the novel architecture of the MnO2@AuPd@CuO core/shell nanocomposite fiber, where AuPd@CuO nanowires with a high surface area offered more open space for the accessibility of the electrolyte and an increased number of electrochemically active sites for reversible redox reactions, while sharply decreasing the internal/contact resistance between MnO2 and AuPd. In addition, a coaxial-fiber SPC by using NiCo2O4 nanosheets grown on a Ni wire as the fiber electrode was reported by Shen and co-workers (Fig. 6g) and was demonstrated to exhibit a high energy density of 1.44 mW h cm−3 and a power density of 17 W cm−3 because the bimetal oxide of NiCo2O4 possesses a much better electronic conductivity and a higher electrochemical activity than nickel oxide or cobalt oxide.124,130–132

(l) CV curves of the stretchable parallel-fiber SPC under stretching and folding, respectively (a scan rate of 50 mV s−1). Reproduced with permission from ref. 130. 
As has been discussed in 2.1.1, coated/grown pseudocapacitive active materials on Ni or Cu wires gave rise to composites fiber electrodes that usually show limited mechanical flexibility, because of the rigidity of the metal wire. To this end, carbonaceous fibers (e.g., CNT fibers and graphene fibers) with excellent flexibility/strength and low densities have been recently developed to replace the above-mentioned metal wires in fiber-shaped PCs. For example, Kim and co-workers deposited MnO2 onto a CNT fiber to obtain a MnO2@CNT composite fiber, where MnO2 nanosheets could be effectively trapped into the 3D interconnected pores of the CNT bundles during the electrochemical deposition process (Fig. 6h and i).127 These 3D porous frameworks could not only offer an increased electrolytic surface area (active sites) of MnO2 for better faradaic reactions, but also provide a short ion-diffusion length that promotes full utilization of MnO2 even at a high scan rate/current density. As a result, the twisted-fiber SPC showed a high energy density of 3.52 mW h cm−3 and a high power density of 0.127 W cm−3. Encouragingly, there was no significant capacitance drop for the as-fabricated SPCs observed even after 1000 bending cycles with a 90° bending angle, indicating the good flexible reliability of the device (Fig. 6j). Likewise, similarly superior stability and repeatability of pseudocapacitive materials@carbonaceous fibers have also been demonstrated in a stretchable parallel-fiber SPC composed of two MnO2@CNT fiber electrodes (Fig. 6k and l).130

Although pseudocapacitive active materials show high capacitances, both the energy and power density of these fiber-shaped SPCs are largely limited by the low operating working potential (less than 1 V, E = 1/2CV2 and P = V2/4RESR). Therefore, increasing the voltage window would be an effective strategy to obtain high efficiency fiber-shaped pseudocapacitors. To this end, fiber-shaped aqueous APCs were developed, where the two different electrodes were coupled together, with a pseudocapacitive electrode (faradaic or battery-like) as the energy source and an EDLC electrode (non-faradaic) as the power source in one configuration (Fig. 7a),35 and could operate in much wider potential windows (1.6–2.0 V, Fig. 7b) than that of the symmetrical design,35 thus leading to a substantial increase in the energy and power densities.13,35,65,97,131–137 In 2014, Miao and co-workers first reported a high performance twisted-fiber APC based on as-spun CNT fibers as the negative electrode and MnO2@CNT fiber as the positive electrode in a PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte.133 The as-fabricated device allowed the maximum operating voltage to be extended from 1.0 to 2.0 V and resulted in much higher energy and power densities than the reference twisted-fiber SPC, reaching 42.0 W h kg−1 at a lower power density of 0.483 kW kg−1. In the same year, a parallel-fiber APC was fabricated by using a MnO2@graphene core/sheath fiber and CNT/graphene hybrid fibers in a PVA/LiCl gel electrolyte, and an enhanced high energy density of 11.9 mW h cm−3 was achieved (Fig. 7c–e).137 Note that the energy density of the two APCs was indeed increased by extending the operating voltage window, which was the sum of the maximum potential windows of the negative and positive fiber electrodes. Subsequently, considerable efforts have been devoted to the increase in the energy density of fiber-shaped APCs by utilizing asymmetric designs. The as-obtained overall high-performance devices were further demonstrated as a power source for flexible/wearable electronics.65,97,131,132,134–136

A twisted-fiber APC that simultaneously realizes energy storage and optoelectronic detection was assembled by using Co3O4 NWs@Ni fibers as the positive electrode and employing graphene-based fibers as both the negative electrode and light-sensitive material.97 The as-fabricated integrated systems featured an increased energy storage and power delivery (almost 1860% enhancement of power density) by extending the working potential window from 0–0.6 V to 0–1.5 V, an outstanding photo-response to white light, and excellent mechanical flexibility of both the APC and the photodetector. Such self-powered nanosystems were also reported in one of our previous studies, where we employed a fully charged coaxial-fiber APC to successfully drive a wearable ultraviolet (UV) photodetector without any external bias voltage, demonstrating their practical applications in future flexible electronic/photoelectronic devices.13
The asymmetrical design used in fiber-shaped APCs has indeed resulted in higher working potential windows, but their relatively low capacitances (usually come from EDLC electrodes) still hinder further improvement in their energy density. Thus, some of the recent studies have focused on developing higher capacitive fibrous negative materials, such as VN NWs@CNT fibers14,16,138–140 and MoS2 NSs@CNT fibers,15 to replace carbon-based EDLC fiber electrodes. As discussed in a previous review by Patrice Simon and Yury Gogotsi, due to a thin electrically conducting surface layer of oxides and oxynitrides, the charging mechanism of nanocrystalline VN includes a combination of an EDLC and a PC (faradaic reaction) at the surface of the NWs, and they thus have been explored as the negative electrode for APCs. For example, in one of our previous studies,14 we rationally designed a high-performance coaxial-fiber APC by wrapping aligned PEDOT:PSS@MnO2@CNT composite sheets onto C@VN NWs@CNT fibers. The unique alignment of C@VN NW arrays offers a large electrochemically active surface area and short paths for fast ion/electron diffusion/transport so as to obtain an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 715 mF cm−2. Moreover, the working potential windows for the C@VN NWs@CNT fiber and PEDOT:PSS@MnO2@CNT sheet composite electrodes were −1.0 to −0.2 V and 0 to 0.8 V (Fig. 7g), respectively, and it was thus expected that the working voltage for the APC could extend to 1.8 V. Benefiting from the high capacitances of both the positive and negative electrodes and high operating voltage of 1.8 V, the as-assembled coaxial-fiber APC showed an outstanding energy density of 96.07 μW h cm−2, which was substantially higher than those of previously reported fiber-shaped APCs. Two similar twisted-fiber APCs with enhanced energy densities assembled with VN NSs//ZNCO NWs (Zn–Ni–Co ternary oxide nanowires)16 and MoS2 NSs//PEDOT:PSS@MnO2,15 respectively, were also reported by Yao and co-workers. This progress demonstrates a novel pathway to construct high-energy-density fiber-shaped APCs for next generation portable/wearable electronics.

3.2 Quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous batteries
Compared to fiber-shaped aqueous supercapacitors, fiber-shaped aqueous rechargeable batteries are of more recent development, while they have been considered as another promising candidate for large-scale energy storage in portable/wearable electronic devices, because of their high energy density, high safety, easy of fabrication and the high ion conductivity of aqueous electrolytes (∼1 S cm−1). Although fiber-shaped aqueous batteries share similar device architectures (two fiber electrodes, a quasi-solid-state electrolyte and a separator if necessary) with fiber-shaped supercapacitors, they differ in the precise energy storage mechanisms. Furthermore, the energy storage mechanism of an aqueous battery is strongly dependent on the selection of the electrolytes,141,142 as shown in Fig. 8a (take Zn-based batteries as an example).141 Hence, in this section, quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous batteries will be categorized into aqueous metal–alkaline batteries (alkali electrolytes) and aqueous metal-ion batteries (neutral electrolytes), according to the different electrolytes. In our review, note that metal–air batteries are summarized and discussed in metal–alkaline batteries, as they possess a similar configuration, which consists of a Zn anode, an aqueous alkaline gel electrolyte and a cathode (i.e., MnO2, NiO, and air electrodes).

3.2.1 Quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous metal–alkaline batteries. 
In recent years, obvious progress has been made with aqueous metal–alkaline rechargeable batteries, especially for fiber-shaped aqueous metal–alkaline batteries that are considered promising energy storage sources for wearable and portable devices. The structure of a typical metal–alkaline battery is illustrated in Fig. 8b,143 where both the surface and bulk electrode materials take part in the faradaic reaction, which is similar to what takes place in lithium-ion batteries but different from that in supercapacitors (only surface/near reactions are involved). Based on the anode materials, fiber-shaped aqueous rechargeable metal–alkaline batteries mainly include Zn-based and Fe-based alkaline batteries.
3.2.1.1 Quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous Zn–alkaline batteries. 
The first use of Zn in batteries was dated back to 1799.144 Zn metal has attracted much attention as a promising anode material both for coin-type and fiber-shaped aqueous batteries in recent years, because of its earth abundance, a two-electron transfer, a relatively low redox potential (−0.76 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode), and a high theoretical specific capacitance (820 mA h g−1 or 5854 mA h cm−3).145,146 More importantly, quasi-solid-state gel electrolytes are favorable for flexible fiber-shaped Zn–alkaline batteries (ZABs), which function as electrolytes and simultaneously avoid the internal short-circuiting of the battery (Fig. 9c).147 Fe/N/C is an excellent electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to its high catalytic activity. When the electrode was loaded with the Fe/N/C catalyst, a higher voltage plateau of 0.92 V and higher cycling stability than that of the electrode without loading the catalyst were demonstrated. However, the capacity of a Zn–air battery was normally low due to its non-rechargeability. Therefore, exploring excellent bifunctional ORR/OER (oxygen evolution reaction) electrocatalysts is of great importance for obtaining rechargeable fiber-shaped Zn–air batteries.148–153

Peng and co-workers subsequently demonstrated a flexible, stretchable and rechargeable fiber-shaped Zn–air battery, which was assembled from an air cathode that included aligned CNT sheets for the ORR and a RuO2 hydrate for the OER, a Zn spring anode and a free-standing gel electrolyte (Fig. 8d and e).148 The battery not only could be successfully discharged/charged at 1.0 V at a high current density of 1 A g−1, but also showed excellent flexibility and stretchability, which is exceedingly promising to power portable/wearable electronics. The limited adhesion/interactions between the catalyst layer and fiber substrate in traditional sprayed/coated air electrodes often result in performance degradation, especially when the device works under frequent and large deformation conditions.148–150 To this end, Zhang and co-workers developed a self-standing and highly flexible bifunctional air electrode composed of cubic Co4N nanoparticles, a carbon fiber network and carbon cloth (CoN4@CNW@CC, Fig. 8f).151 Benefiting from the synergistic effects between Co4N and Co–N–C and the stable 3D interconnected conductive network structure, the thus-obtained Co4N@CNW@CC exhibited outstanding OER and ORR performances. Thus, the as-fabricated fiber-shaped Zn–air battery showed excellent electrochemical performance, including a low discharge/charge voltage gap (1.09 V at 50 mA cm−2) and a long cycle life (up to 408 cycles), and was superb bendable and twistable, indicating its promising application potential for portable/wearable electronics. Recently, an efficient air electrode has been reported in our previous work, in which remarkable electrocatalytic performance toward the OER and ORR is exhibited by a catalyst (Co/CoNx@NC) prepared by growing a hybrid cobalt/cobalt nitride nanoparticle decorated nitrogen-doped carbon nanoarray on a flexible carbon substrate. Furthermore, a coaxial-fiber Zn–air battery built with it delivered a superior volumetric power density of 104.0 mW cm−3 coupled with high flexibility (Fig. 8g).153
Different from the half-open configuration of fiber-shaped Zn–air batteries where the air cathode is a charge-transfer medium and the reactants (i.e., O2) are accessed from the environment, all Zn–MnO2,25 Zn–Ni,44,154 Zn–Co28,45,155 and Zn–Ag52,156 fiber-shaped batteries are closed systems, with cathode materials (i.e., MnO2, NiO, NiCo-LDH and Ag2O) playing active roles in the redox reaction, and have also received a lot of attention in recent years, because of their exceedingly high-energy potentiality and decent cycling life. For example, Xiao and co-workers demonstrated a twisted-fiber Zn–Ni battery, where the anode fiber electrode was prepared by depositing Zn nanoparticles on a 3D Li-doped TiO2 nanotube coated Ti fiber (Zn NPs@Li–TiO2@Ti fiber) (Fig. 9a).154 The novel Zn NPs@Li–TiO2@Ti anode fiber shows much improved electrochemical performance towards Zn deposition/dissolution during the charging/discharging process, demonstrating excellent long-term stability in the Zn-containing alkaline electrolyte and superior charging/discharging properties at an ultra-high rate. As a result, the as-assembled twisted-fiber Zn–Ni battery exhibits a maximum volumetric energy density of 0.034 W h cm−3, power density of 17.5 W cm−3 and about 95% capacity retention after 20000 cycles. However, their limited overall electrochemical and insufficient mechanical flexibility due to the rigidity of the metal fibers (Ti-base fibers and Cu-based fibers as the anode and cathode electrodes, respectively) impede their further application in portable/wearable electronics. To this end, Zhi and co-workers used scalably produced highly conductive yarns uniformly deposited with Zn nanosheets (as the anode) and nickel cobalt hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheets (as the cathode) to fabricate parallel-fiber Zn–NiCo batteries (Fig. 9b).28 Due to the superior electronic conductivity of the large-scale-yield yarns and the high capacity of NiCo-LDHs that originated from the synergistic effects between the two transition metal ions, the assembled battery exhibits an ultrahigh rate ability of 116 C and an excellent volumetric energy density of 8.0 W h cm−3. Moreover, their good scalability, flexibility and weavability guarantee wide application as a power source for various integrated portable/wearable electronics. Likewise, Yao and co-workers developed a high-performance twisted-fiber Zn–Ag battery, which could be successfully charged fully with a wind generator, revealing a novel way to harvest clean and renewable wind energy for portable/wearable electronics.155
3.2.1.2 Quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous Fe–alkaline batteries. 
As has been demonstrated, choosing an appropriate anode material for aqueous rechargeable alkaline batteries is extremely critical as it plays an important role in determining the final working voltage of the batteries and affects the full utilization of the cathode capacity. As discussed in a previous review,143 according to previously reported working mechanisms, anode materials were mainly divided into two categories: dissolution-deposition (i.e., Zn anodes) and conversion (i.e., Fe-based anodes). Fe-based materials (i.e., Fe nanoparticles, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeOx and FeS) with high theoretical capacity and a wide operating voltage window as the typical anodes, utilizing the conversion mechanism between the anode materials and the alkaline electrolyte (OH−) during the charging/discharging process, were established for aqueous Fe–Ni batteries by Jüngner and Edison 100 years ago, and have been widely investigated since then.157 However, using Fe-based anodes for fiber-shaped aqueous Fe–alkaline batteries has been rarely reported, because of their relativity poor conductivity and sluggish kinetics of FeOx in the electrochemical process.21,26,158 For overcoming these issues of the inactivation in Fe–Ni batteries, Xiao and co-workers reported a defect engineering based superficially doping method to obtain nanostructured Mn-doped NiO and Mn-doped Fe2O3 fiber-shaped electrodes with superior electrochemical performance.158 Furthermore, they have also demonstrated that these defect-rich shells (Mn-doped layer) are formed on the surface of the primeval NiO and Fe2O3 nanostructures with enhanced carrier density by extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, thus effectively boosting the capacity, rate performance and durability of electrodes. As a result, the assemble twisted-fiber Fe–Ni battery shows an exceptional volumetric energy density of 61.0 mW h cm−3 and power density of 48.4 W cm−3 with an impressive cycling stability of 91.2% capacitance retention after 30000 cycles.
Recently, MOF-derived materials with abundant reaction active sites and a large specific surface area have been demonstrated as a class of promising anodes for aqueous rechargeable alkaline batteries, including Fe–Co batteries and Fe–Ni batteries. Yao and co-workers reported a twisted-fiber Fe–Co battery by employing both a MOF-derived NiZnCoP@CNT fiber and S-α-Fe2O3/OCNT fiber as the cathode and anode, respectively.21 Due to these plentiful reaction active sites and high specific surface area that originated from well-designed MOF-derived electrode materials, the as-fabricated fiber-shaped Fe–Co battery exhibits a superior volumetric energy density of 30.61 mW h cm−3 and a remarkable cycling stability with 88.6% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. Similarly, they have also fabricated a high-performance twisted-fiber Fe–Ni battery, using the afore-mentioned Fe2O3-based anode and 3D well-aligned Ni(OH)2 NSs@CoP NWs@CNT fiber cathode, which shows a high energy density of 81.0 mW h cm−3 at a power density pf 1.2 W cm−3 (Fig. 9f).26 All in all, by developing nanostructured Fe2O3 with more active sites/a larger surface area on a highly conductive CNT fiber, these two studies indeed are an important stepping stone towards the development of fiber-shaped Fe–alkaline batteries for wearable and portable electronics.


3.2.2 Quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous metal-ion batteries. 
Although fiber-shaped aqueous Zn–alkaline batteries have garnered a lot of progress as promising ESDs for flexible wearable/portable electronics, employing corrosive alkaline electrolytes (i.e., KOH) can result in a sharp and needle-like Zn-dendritic growth and soluble ZnO22− (byproduct) formation on the Zn anode, which poisons the cathode and leads to rapid capacity fading. However, the energy storage mechanism of aqueous metal-ion batteries (MIBs) with neutral or mild acidic electrolytes (i.e., ZnSO4) is the reversible insertion/extraction of Mx+ (eqn (1) and (2), taking Zn-ion batteries as an example), where Mx+ stands for a mono/multivalent ion (i.e., Li, Na and Zn),159,160 which significantly differ from traditional metal–alkaline batteries, where the metal anode often shows a stripping/plating process while the cathode displays a H+-induced conversion reaction (eqn (3) and (4), taking Zn–alkaline batteries as an example).
Zn-ion batteries: Anode: Zn ↔ Zn2+ + 2e−(1) Cathode: Zn2+ + 2e− + 2α-MnO2 ↔ ZnMn2O4(2)
Zn–alkaline batteries:  Anode: Zn + 4OH− ↔ Zn(OH)42+ + 2e−(3) Cathode: MnO2 + H2O + e− ↔ MnOOH + OH−(4)
As a result, strong efforts have recently devoted to designing cathode materials and flexible device configurations for aqueous rechargeable MIBs, especially for quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous MIBs, where tremendous progress has been achieved in this field. Based on the anode materials, fiber-shaped aqueous rechargeable MIBs mainly include Zn-ion23,27,53–55,161–163 and Na-ion batteries.22,164
3.2.2.1 Quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous Zn-ion batteries. 
Manganese oxides (i.e., MnO2), vanadium oxides (i.e., V2O5) and Prussian blue analogues (PBA) with tunnel or layered structures enabling reversible intercalation/(de)intercalation of Zn2+ ions have been successfully used for fiber-shaped Zn-ion batteries, because of their unique advantages including abundant reserves, low cost, and multiple valence states. In 2013, Zou and co-workers first reported a parallel-fiber Zn-ion battery assembled with a Zn wire and a dip-coated MnO2/carbon fiber, which does not show any loss in the capacity in bending tests, indicating its impressive flexibility (Fig. 10a).162 The subsequent progress in the Zn-ion battery achieved by employing an α-MnO2 cathode has successfully transformed this primary non-rechargeable battery into a really reversible system. As an example of improvement, Zhi and co-workers reported a high-performance rechargeable parallel-fiber Zn-ion battery (Fig. 10b),27 where double-helix CNT yarns were used as the current collect for the MnO2 cathode (MnO2@CNT yarn) and Zn anode (Zn@CNT yarn), accompanied by a cross-linked polyacrylamide (PAM) electrolyte. Benefiting from the superior ionic conductivity of the PAM gel electrolyte and double-helix structured electrodes, the obtained Zn-ion battery shows an outstanding specific capacity of 302.1 mA h g−1 and volumetric energy density of 53.8 mW h cm−3, as well as a long-term cycle stability of 98.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Moreover, the parallel-fiber battery also exhibits outstanding flexible and stretchability (up to 300% strain). These impressive electrochemical performances, combined with robust mechanical properties, enable the as-assembled fiber-shaped Zn-ion batteries to serve as promising and trusty ESDs for portable/wearable electronics. Simultaneously, to investigate the influence of the electrolyte, Ma and co-workers studied the electrochemical performance of parallel-fiber Zn-ion batteries with different Zn salt electrolytes,163 such as Zn(CF3SO3)2 and ZnCl2, and found that the electrochemical behavior of the MnO2 cathode, including specific capacity and cycling ability, was effected by the Zn salts used in the electrolytes.

Reproduced with permission from ref. 24. 
Layer-structured vanadium oxides with 2D nanosheet morphologies have also been investigated recently as a binder-free cathode for quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous Zn-ion batteries. For example, Yao and co-workers reported a twisted-fiber Zn-ion battery using V2O5@NC (N-doped porous carbon) grown on CNT fibers as the cathode and Zn@CNT fibers as the anode (Fig. 10c).55 The 3D hierarchical V2O5 NSs@NC core/shell heterostructure can not only effectively enhance the mass loading of V2O5 (as the shell layer) to increase the capacity, but also ameliorate the electronic conductivity and diffusion efficiency of the cathode material. As a result, the as-assembled fiber-shaped Zn-ion battery shows a high volume capacity of 457.5 mA h cm−3 and an impressive volumetric energy density of 40.8 mW h cm−3 (based on the total volume of the device). Similar a fiber-shaped Zn-ion battery was also demonstrated by twisting a V2O5@TiN@CNT fiber cathode and Zn@CNT fiber anode, which exhibits stable electrochemical performance under both normal and bending states.54 However, for these layer-structured vanadium oxides/vanadates of 2D nanosheets standing on a conducting surface/substrate, one of the challenging issues is the poor electronic conductivity and mechanical stability especially in the cross-2D nanosheet direction, leading to an insufficient rate capability, mechanical stability and shortened cycle life, especially under repeated bending/stretching conditions.
To this end, in one of our previous studies,24 we developed a facile process to grow zinc pyrovanadate 2D nanosheets stitched together with 1D CNTs (Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O, CNT-stitched ZVO) assembled on oxidized CNT fibers (CNT-stitched ZVO NSs@OCNT fibers) (Fig. 10d), which have been studied as a class of highly efficient cathodes in fiber-shaped quasi-solid-state Zn-ion batteries. Twisted-fiber Zn-ion batteries, consisting of CNTs-stitched ZVO 2D nanosheets as the cathode, Zn NSs@CNT fibers as the anode and a gel electrolyte, are characterized by their tiny volume and excellent mechanical flexibility, ideal for miniaturized portable and wearable electronics. With the CNT-stitched ZVO 2D nanosheet structure, the open frameworks of ZVO provide the required space for reversible Zn2+ (de)intercalation, abundant 2D ion channels in exposed b–c planes to accelerate Zn2+ access and promote charge transfer, while the stitching 1D CNTs offer the desperately needed electronic conductivity across the ZVO nanosheets. As a result, the as-assembled fiber-shaped Zn-ion batteries exhibit an ultrahigh-rate capability (69.7% of initial capacity after a 100-times increase in current density and discharge in 25 s, as shown in Fig. 10e), a high stack volumetric energy density of 71.6 mW h cm−3 and a long-cycle life of 2000 cycles (88.9% retention). These encouraging results prove the proof-of-concept of developing 2D nanosheets purposely stitched together with 1D conducting nanotubes/nanowires as a class of advanced cathodes for quasi-solid-state Zn-ion batteries in future portable/wearable electronics.
3.2.2.2 Quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous Na-ion batteries. 
Aqueous rechargeable Na-ion batteries have been demonstrated to be a promising alternative for large-scale applications which may solve both the safety issue associated with traditional Na-ion batteries which employ highly flammable and toxic organic solvents and rigorous manufacturing conditions.165 In recent years, some effects have been made to develop high-performance fiber-shaped aqueous Na-ion batteries.22,164 For example, Yao an co-workers first reported a coaxial-fiber Na-ion battery by using NTP@CNT fibers (NaTi2(PO4)3 grown on CNT fibers) as the inner anode, In HCF composition as the outer cathode and a CMC/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte sandwiched in between them.22 In this work, a simple solvothermal method is developed to directly obtain binder-free NTP-based fiber electrodes without the need for any further post-synthesis treatment, which guarantee them to possess more active sites, enhanced electronic conductivity and improved mechanical stability. Furthermore, the unique coaxial architecture can make full use of the effective specific surface area and reduce the contact resistance between the two electrodes. As a result, the as-assembled fiber-shaped Na-ion battery with a high working voltage not only shows a high capacity of 37.84 mA h cm−3 and a remarkable energy density of 57.66 mW h cm−3, but also exhibits excellent flexibility and stability (91.3% capacitance retention after being bent 3000 times). Similarly, they have also assembled a high-performance twisted-fiber Na-ion battery based on all binder-free fiber electrodes where nanocube-like KNiFe(CN)6 and rugby ball-like NaTi2(PO4)3 are grown on CNT fibers as the cathode and anode (KNHCF@CNT fibers and NTP@CNT fibers), respectively, which shows an impressive energy density of 39.32 mW h cm−3.164 By directly growing nanostructured NTP on a highly conductive and flexible CNT fiber, these two pieces of research work can be a stepping stone towards the development of high-performance fiber-shaped Na-ion batteries for next-generation wearable/portable electronics.

4. Integration of quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs
With the fast development of flexible and portable/wearable electronics, wearable integrated devices with multiple functionalities have become a significant direction in modern electronics. To this end, in parallel with the lot of studies that have been devoted to optimizing the electrochemical performance of quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs, on the one hand, there has been steady development of integration of other functionalities into the same fiber shapes, such as sensors (e.g., photodetectors, pressure sensors, temperature sensors and humidity sensors) and monitors/actuators (e.g., temperature monitors and humidity monitors). This will make these fiber-shaped ESDs truly multi-functional, going beyond the energy storage alone. With the miniaturization of additional sensors and monitors/actuators, there are more opportunities and challenges in the device fabrication and integration, as demonstrated by a couple of prototypes.13,16,20,166,167 On the other hand, energy harvesting (e.g., solar cells and nanogenerators) is a further functionality for fiber-shaped ESDs, as they can skip frequent charging processes (which would be inconvenient for daily usage). For their practical applications in portable/wearable electronics, integrating fiber-shaped ESDs with energy harvesting is a promising direction to conquer, which will be opening up some new proof-of-concepts for energy management. Currently, the explored fiber-shaped integrated electronics have mainly focused on combining energy harvesting/conversion and ESDs (including supercapacitors and aqueous batteries) to realize a self-powering function in a compact and effective 1D architecture.82,168–177 Till now, two main strategies have been explored to get a single dual-functional fiber system, namely, fiber-shaped ESD-driven sensing systems and fiber-shaped integrated systems combining energy harvesting and ESDs. Note that rare attempts have also devoted to the design and development of a single fiber capable of energy harvesting, storage and utilization (denoted as a fiber-shaped tri-functional integrated system), which further enrich the field of multifunctional integrated technologies.25,83
4.1 Fiber-shaped ESD-driven sensing systems
As a key part of advanced electronics, flexible smart sensors (e.g., photodetectors, pressure sensors, temperature sensors and humidity sensors) can be used to exchange and gather data for monitoring ambient information, including ultraviolet light, temperature, humidity, and the presence of hazardous gases. Integrating fibrous ESDs with multifunctional sensors to get fiber-shaped ESD-driven sensing systems represents a very significant and attractive trend to realize the practical applications of fiber-shaped ESDs. Such integrated systems possess the combined properties of superior flexibility, light weight, and high integration with miniaturized size and multiple functions. For example, Yao and co-workers reported a high-performance sensing system integrating a coaxial-fiber supercapacitor with a humidity sensor (Fig. 11a).166 The as-assembled supercapacitor delivers a high areal energy density of 83.59 μW h cm−2, which can act as a stable power supply for coaxial fibrous humidity sensors. Indeed, the as-obtained flexible humidity sensing system shows a high sensitivity (2.483/% RH) in the detection of relative humidity, with a fast response speed of 0.39 s, demonstrating the promising potential of fiber-shaped ESDs for employing in portable/wearable integrated system. Simultaneously, they have also developed a simple, low-cost 3D printing technique to fabricate a fiber-shaped integrated system that combines a printed fibrous temperature sensor with a twisted-fiber supercapacitor (Fig. 11b),167 which shows impressive sensitivity in the detection of ambient temperature, with a responsivity of 1.95% °C−1.

Although the above two fiber-shaped ESD-driven sensing systems are quite efficient, they however show limited mechanical stability and flexibility, especially in term of the highly stretchable property that can accommodate repeated tensile and deformation conditions without obvious loss in electrochemical performance and reliability. To this end, in one of our previous studies, we have designed an all-in-one stretchable coaxial-fiber sensing system simultaneously integrating strain detection and power supporting supercapacitors (Fig. 11c).20 An asymmetric stretchable coaxial-fiber supercapacitor (ASCSC) is made on an elastic fiber, with a maximum operating voltage of 1.8 V, by adopting the high capacitance of MnO2 and PPy deposited on aligned CNT sheets as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, and thus shows a superior stack volumetric energy density of 1.42 mW h cm−3, and an excellent flexibility with 85.1% capacitance retention after stretching for 6000 cycles at a strain of 200%. As a result, the outstanding performance of the ASCSC has motivated us to integrate it with a strain sensor to assemble an all-in-one stretchable coaxial-fiber sensing system, which presents a consistent self-supported performance with superior stability and durability with repeated unloading/loading of 40% applied strain for 10000 cycles, after one single charge. These encouraging results demonstrated the new proof-of-concept for the integration of strain elements with energy storage into a single stretchable fiber for next generation wearables.
4.2 Fiber-shaped integrated system combining energy harvesting and ESDs
As has been discussed above, it is of great significance to integrate energy harvesting and storage into a single device to obtain self-powering functions, which can not only skip the inevitable and frequent charging processes but also remove unnecessary external electrical connections, with a decrease in the size, weight, and cost. To realize integrated systems combining energy harvesting and ESDs, numerous efforts have been dedicated to integrating flexible fiber-shaped ESDs with solar cells or nanogenerators within one fiber.
On the one hand, Peng and co-workers first reported an integrated energy wire for simultaneously realizing both photoelectric conversion and energy storage by fabricating dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and supercapacitors on a single fiber (Fig. 11d).173 In this integrated system, a Ti wire was first modified with TiO2 nanotubes on the surface, and then photoactive materials and gel electrolytes were coated on two separated parts for photoelectric conversion and energy storage, respectively. Finally, aligned CNT fibers were twisted with both parts to produce a self-charging integrated system with an entire photoelectric conversion and storage efficiency of about 1.5%. Although their overall energy conversion efficiency in this work is not as good as some of those reported in subsequent reports,174–177 this pioneering work successfully opened up a new horizon on such fiber-shaped integrated systems combining energy harvesting and ESDs. Following on that, Zou and co-workers reported a higher overall energy conversion efficiency of 2.1% by integrating an energy system with PANI//TiO2 and PANI//PANI coated on a stainless steel wire as a DSSC and SC.174 More recently, a new design of coaxial-fiber construction was successfully adopted to integrate a polymer SC (PSC) and supercapacitor.175 The generated charges can be speedily separated and transported to produce high photocurrents in the PSC part because of the efficient PSC in the radial direction, and for the supercapacitor part, such a coaxial-fiber structure with a much higher effective contact area can also favor rapid charge transport. As a result, the as-integrated energy system can self-work for weeks with the overall efficiency retained at about 75%.
On the other hand, using a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is also a powerful and effective pathway to convert various forms of mechanical energy in our working/living environment into electricity, especially considering the usage scenario of portable/wearable electronics. Due to their output electric power being pulses with an irregular magnitude and uncontrollable fluctuation/instability, TENGs usually cannot be directly used to drive most electronic devices that demand a stable and continuous input power. Therefore, it is essential to integrate an energy harvesting TENG with an ESD into a self-charging power system, which offers more practical opportunities for sustainable and maintenance-free applications. For instance, Wang and co-workers first developed a flexible and wearable self-charging power system consisting of fibrous supercapacitors and a fiber-based TENG, which can effectively harvest mechanical energy from human motion (Fig. 11e).178 In this system, the fibrous supercapacitor shows a high capacitance of 83.5 F cm−3, because of the superior pseudocapacitance of RuO2·xH2O prepared by the vapor-phase hydrothermal method, while the highly stable fiber-shaped TENG was designed from poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) coated on carbon wire electrodes. When the supercapacitor was charged by the rectified output of a TENG, its voltage increased by 8 mV for ≈10 s (an average charging current of 1.28 μA), which indeed indicates that the as-designed integrated device can effectively convert the human motion to electricity. More recently, similar self-charging power system work was also reported by Yao and co-workers, where a fiber-shaped TENG harvests mechanical energy to successfully power a twisted-fiber supercapacitor, further demonstrating its promise to meet the ever-increasing requirements for renewable power sources in portable/wearable electronics.179
4.3 Fiber-shaped tri-functional integrated systems
Although a significant achievement has been realized in fiber-shaped integrated systems that combine either energy storage-utilization or energy harvesting-storage, it still remains a great challenge to simultaneously realize energy harvesting, storage, and utilization in a single fiber. Encouragingly, Yao and co-workers have rationally designed and fabricated a prototype fully solar-powered coaxial-fiber stretchable sensing system (tri-functional integrated system) by integrating a DSSC, an aqueous Zn–alkaline battery (Zn–MnO2 battery), and a stretchable strain sensor to simultaneously achieve energy harvesting, storage, and utilization, which further enrich the field of multifunctional integrated technologies. As has been detailed, the fiber-shaped DSSC can effectively convert solar energy into electricity and further store as chemical energy in a stretchable Zn–MnO2 battery. Furthermore, the solar-charged Zn–MnO2 battery offers a steady and continuous power/energy supply for a stretchable fiber-shaped strain sensor.
5. Conclusion and prospects
To satisfy the ever-growing requirements of energy storage and multiple functionalities for portable/wearable electronics, enormous efforts have recently been dedicated to developing ESDs in flexible, fiber-shaped configurations for better adapting to various aggressive deformations, where high performance energy storage is essential. In this overview, the state-of-the-art fiber-shaped ESD systems have been critically looked into from the viewpoint of new design principles, materials and device fabrication, and system integration, not only for energy storage, but also for integrated multiple functions. To date, although numerous energy storage mechanisms have been successfully realized in a flexible fiber-shaped configuration with acceptable performance, there are still several important issues/challenges that need to be explored before these elementary wearable/portable devices can be nearly used on wide scales. On the one hand, to translate the academic research accomplishments into practical applications, the following key technical problems/challenges must be addressed.
(i) Compared with flexible aqueous planar ESDs, the electrochemical performance of quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped ESDs, especially regarding the key parameters such as energy density and power density, remains far behind, which can well be attributed to three main factors as follows: (a) The high internal resistance including the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, the electrical conductivity of the fiber electrode, and the interface resistance between the active materials and current collector, caused by the high length-to-diameter of 1D structures, which can lead to a fall in the high-rate ability and energy density. (b) Most of the known flexible 1D substrates possess a low specific surface area with a relatively low mass loading of active materials, resulting in limited energy storage capability. (c) The active material loading on the 1D current collectors is easily shed, which may significantly reduce the overall performance of fiber-shaped ESDs, especially under continuous bending/stretching conditions. Thus, major new research efforts are needed to explore fiber electrodes based on novel active materials (e.g., MXenes), which show high capacitances without sacrificing their cycling life, as well as maintaining their mechanical flexibility.
(ii) Due to the inherent feature voltage of water splitting (1.23 V, 2H2O → 2H2 + O2), the electrochemical stability potential of a typical aqueous electrolyte is limited to be around 1.23 V without the effect of overpotential, thus constraining the operating voltage to a maximum of 1.8–2.0 V for ESDs. Such an issue seriously restricts the energy density (E) and powder density (P) of aqueous ESDs (E = 1/2CV2 and P = V2/4RESR, where C is the capacitance of the device, V is the operating voltage, and RESR is the equivalent series resistance). In addition, the insufficient ionic conductivity and limited mechanical properties of PVA-based quasi-solid-state gel electrolytes (dominating the gel electrolytes for fiber-shaped ESD) are still unsatisfactory for meeting the practical requirements in a wide range of portable/wearable electronics. One of the promising options is to explore new quasi-solid-state electrolytes with a broad working voltage window, a high ionic conductivity, and robust mechanical properties, such as “water-in-salt” electrolytes.
(iii) Note that the requirements for the fabrication procedure of fiber-shaped ESDs are more rigorous when compared to their planar counterparts, where the main issue originates from the finite freedom of movement of the separate elements and the intricate interdependence and the intricate interdependence in the 1D geometry. Moreover, the fabrication cost for fiber-shaped ESDs is significantly higher than that of planar devices, due to the continuous production of high-performance fiber electrodes or coating active materials onto miles of fiber substrates. Thus, it would be important and pressing to develop a low cost and high throughput technique for large-scale production of quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped aqueous ESDs.
(iv) For a wide range of wearable applications, safety issues should be carefully considered, including active material electrodes, electrolytes, etc., considering that fiber-shaped ESDs will be directly worn on the human body. Thus, ensuring that these ESDs are absolutely safe is indispensable. On the one hand, nontoxic and biocompatible materials should be chosen. On the other hand, safety packing/encapsulation active materials and devices are also in demand to realize the practical applications of these fiber-shaped ESDs.
(v) As has been discussed, dual-, tri- and multi-functional fiber systems, such as fiber-shaped ESD-driven sensing systems and fiber-shaped integrated systems combining energy harvesting and ESDs, will be a very prospective direction for future research and development of probable/wearable electronics. However, the majority of previously published integrated systems connected only fiber-shaped ESDs directly with energy harvesting (e.g., solar cells and nanogenerators) or flexible smart sensors (e.g., photodetectors, pressure sensors, temperature sensors and humidity sensors), which would unavoidably lead to an increased volume and can adversely affect the mechanical flexibility and durability. Thus, in future research and development, joint efforts by multiple professionals in several different fields, such as ESD scientists, electrical engineers and mechatronics engineers, are highly expected to transition these gathered/accumulated technologies and know-how into the next exciting era of integrated fiber-shaped electronics.
(vi) Besides the above-mentioned several main technical issues/challenges that need to be resolved, it is also essential to establish a set of criteria for evaluating the properties of ESDs, including electrochemical performance, mechanical flexibility, durability, etc. For electrochemical performance, without complete data or experimental details, i.e. the mass loading of active materials in fiber electrodes (mg cm−2 or g cm−3) and the area/volume of fiber electrodes and whole devices (cm−2 and cm−3), it is difficult to compare with previously reported and new results. In the evaluation of mechanical properties, simple manual methods such as twisting, bending and stretching are often used to evaluate the mechanical flexibility and stability, but the corresponding quantitative data of tensile strength are not obtained. A possible strategy is to establish a complete set of standardized guidelines/criteria for the properties of fiber-shaped ESDs, which would need the efforts from researchers, manufacturers and end users.
On the other hand, compared with their 2D planar counterparts, the electrochemical performance of 1D fiber-shaped ESDs is often poor, which is due to the high curvature interface of the fiber structure, enabling flexibility but deteriorating the utilization efficiency of active materials. Thus, a set of desired guides in the following aspects would help improve high-performance fiber-shaped ESDs.
(i) Energy density and power density: to obtain high energy and power densities for fiber-shaped EDSs, exploring/designing new fiber electrodes and active materials with excellent conductivity, light weight, and high electrochemical performance is apparently a prospective direction. To this end, employing a thinner fiber (e.g., CNT fibers and rGO fibers) as the current collector or enhancing the mass loading of active materials (cathode materials) can definitely improve the energy and power densities due to the shorter transmission path for ion diffusion in the thinner layer and the higher mass part of active materials in the ESDs. Nevertheless, an excess of active materials (cathode materials) could inevitably lead to the loss or weakening of chemical bonds with current collectors, thereby causing the stripping of the surface active material and reduction of electrolyte penetration. In addition, based on most previously reported fiber-shaped ESDs, the calculations of energy and power densities are usually based on volumetric capacitances, rather than mass loading capacitances or areal capacitances. Thus, as has been discussed above, a complete set of standardized guidelines/criteria shall be established/unified for the electrochemical performance of diverse ESD systems, which would be essential for a fair comparison.
(ii) Long-cycle life: wearable/portable electronic devices generally use 1D ESDs as a textile energy supply/source which would not be often replaced, so, it is indispensable for long-cycle life as a standard to assess the value of fiber-shaped ESDs in practical applications. The cycle life is largely related to the nature of the active materials in electrodes, electrolytes and their interfaces in ESDs. Furthermore, several technological problems still remain that need to be considered, when designing and fabricating a high performance 1D fiber-shaped ESD, such as the compatibility of each component and device configuration, as well as the interfaces involved. Promising strategies can well involve developing new electrode materials with long-term mechanical strength, designing mechanically robust configurations or employing effective encapsulation layers/tubes. Simultaneously, systemic evaluations of cycling performance under all kinds of deformations such as twisting, stretching, and bending would be strongly suggested.
Overall, significant and new efforts will be continued to pursue better electrochemical performance, mechanical flexibility and robustness, and at the same time to make fiber-shaped ESDs play an important role in the next generation of wearables, IOT (Internet of Things) and soft robotics, where there will be rapid advances in the development of new materials, device fabrication, and integration of more functional elements, at an overall low manufacturing cost.
