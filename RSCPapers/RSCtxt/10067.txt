1. Introduction
With population explosion and the ever-increasing demand for traditional fossil fuels, a series of issues including environmental pollution and energy shortage have increasingly emerged.1–9 The development of sustainable energy sources with high energy density and environmental benignity has become imminent.10,11 Hydrogen has been regarded as a promising energy carrier due to its long-term sustainability, clean combustion, high energy storage capacity, and renewable nature.12–17 Hydrogen production from sustainable energy-driven electrochemical water splitting is an effective approach with advantages of high-purity, zero environmental pollution and so on.11,12,18–22 However, the paired anode reaction of water splitting termed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves four-electron transfer with one electron coupled per step, resulting in inefficient hydrogen generation.23–27 Although commercial electrocatalysts (i.e., RuO2 and IrO2) exhibit excellent performances for the OER,28,29 their large-scale practical applications are hindered due to the prohibitive cost and low reserves.30–32 Therefore, the development of noble-metal-free OER electrocatalysts with high activity, robust stability, and earth-abundance is crucial and highly urgent.
Recently, non-noble-metal-based materials such as metal oxides,33–37 hydroxides,38–40 phosphides,41–44 sulfides,45–48 selenides,49–52etc., have been used as highly active OER electrocatalysts. Most granular OER electrocatalysts require polymeric binders (for example Nafion) during electrode preparation processes to ensure good adhesion to the conductive substrate.11 The introduction of a polymeric binder would cause the following issues: (i) the loading amount is limited (less than 1 mg cm−2) with substantive sacrifice of active sites;11 and (ii) the incorporation of the polymeric binder can severely reduce the electrical conductivity and inhibit mass transport, compromising the catalytic activity toward the OER.53,54 Therefore, it is of crucial importance to construct free-standing catalysts which do not require polymeric binders and meanwhile without sacrificing the electrocatalytic activity towards the OER.
Benefiting from abundant resources, low cost, good electronic conductivity, and excellent chemical stability, carbon materials have attracted much attention in the field of electrocatalysis, energy storage, water treatment and other fields as conductive substrates.55–61 Carbon materials could be prepared from various precursors and made into versatile structures.62–65 Electrocatalysts can be in situ grown on the surface of carbon substrates such as carbon cloth (CC), carbon paper (CP), carbon fiber paper (CFP), carbon fiber cloth (CFC), etc. The resulting free-standing structures possess the following merits. Firstly, free-standing catalysts can be facilely prepared by diverse methods including solvothermal/hydrothermal synthesis, electrochemical deposition, chemical vapor deposition, template-assisted synthesis, and so on. Meanwhile, the in situ growth strategy can avoid the use of polymeric binders and simplify the electrode preparation process.54 Secondly, the carbon substrate plays a key role in enhancing catalytic activity, wherein their hydrophilicity is beneficial for oxygen desorption and infiltration of the electrolyte.66 Thirdly, compared to metal substrates (Ni foam, Cu foam, stainless steel mesh/foil, etc.), the carbon substrate possesses advantages of easy availability, low cost, low density, large specific areas and good stability in strong alkaline electrolyte during the electrocatalytic process.1,67 Fourthly, free-standing architecture possesses high mass loading, which could offer abundant active sites, increase the current density and enhance the catalytic efficiency.
Until now, although some high-quality reviews have been published on free-standing electrocatalysts for the OER,11,18,67–70 few of them exclusively focus on those catalysts designed with free-standing carbon substrates. In this review, we firstly begin with a brief discussion of the advantages of free-standing catalysts compared to powdery electrodes. Secondly, available methods for the preparation of various free-standing electrocatalysts are systemically summarized (Fig. 1). Thirdly, the improvement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for free-standing catalysts with the assistance of advanced strategies (interface and defect engineering, heteroatom-doping, etc.) is summarized. Importantly, the electrochemical properties of free-standing catalysts for the OER including metal oxides, metal hydroxides/oxyhydroxides, metal phosphides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, MOFs and their derivatives have been comprehensively overviewed. Finally, challenges and perspectives for designing more promising free-standing nanoarray catalysts for the OER are discussed.

2. Mechanism and key evaluating parameters of the OER
2.1 OER mechanism
The OER involves four steps with one electron coupled per step as shown in eqn (1)–(10).69,71–73 The OER mechanisms under acidic or basic conditions involve multiple intermediates, such as *OH, *O and *OOH. * stands for OER active sites, which can adsorb and desorb the reactants and intermediates during the OER process. A complete OER process involves four steps in both acidic and basic media. Firstly, * combines with H2O or OH− to form *OH [(eqn (1) or (6)]. Secondly, *OH dissociates to form O* [eqn (2) or (7)]. Thirdly, the obtained *O combines with H2O or OH− to generate *OOH [eqn (3) or (8)]. Lastly, molecular O2 is directly produced in acidic media [eqn (4)], whereas molecular O2 is generated with the help of OH− in basic media [eqn (9)]. Until now, most literature reports have demonstrated that the rate-limiting step of the OER was mainly located in the second and third step of the four step reaction.74–77 The total free energy variation of the OER is calculated to be 4.92 eV in acidic or basic media according to eqn (5) or (10).78,79 The value of total free energy variation of *OH → *O → *OOH in acidic media is approximately 3.2 eV,69 which is consistent with that in the basic media. If the energy barrier of the *OH → *O step shows a low barrier for catalysts, it would result in a correspondingly high barrier for the *O → *OOH step and vice versa. The high barrier step is called the rate-limiting step for the OER.
Under acidic conditions: H2O + * → *OH + H+ + e−(1) *OH → *O + H+ + e−(2) *O + H2O → *OOH + H+ + e−(3) *OOH → O2 + H+ + e−(4)
Overall: 2H2O → 4H+ + O2 + 4e−(5)
Under basic conditions: OH− + * → *OH + e−(6) *OH + OH− → *O + H2O + e−(7) *O + OH− → *OOH + e−(8) *OOH + OH− → O2 + H2O + e−(9)
Overall: 4OH− → 2H2O + O2 + 4e−(10)
The OER involves multiple indirect routes with high overpotentials, resulting in a slow kinetic process and low activity.20 In order to gain deep insights into the OER mechanisms, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been proposed for revealing the structure–activity correlation and evaluating the activity of reaction intermediates (*OH, *O, and *OOH).13,80–83 In theory, each step of the four steps affects the OER performance. However, the adsorption free energies of intermediates for each step are different.84 Fortunately, the adsorption free energies for the formation of intermediates can be calculated via DFT according to the proposed model. Furthermore, theoretical calculations can be in favor of determining the rate-limiting step, indicating the real active sites, revealing the OER mechanism, and predicting the OER activity.13,19,23,85
2.2 Key evaluating parameters for the OER

(1) Overpotential. 
The electrocatalytic OER can proceed with a theoretical potential of 1.23 V (vs. RHE). However, it requires extra energy to overcome the intrinsic energy barrier originating from the kinetic obstacle. Therefore, the overpotential (η) is generated which is the difference between the applied potential (E) and the equilibrium potential. The overpotential is one of the key factors for evaluating the OER performance. The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (10% efficiency of solar water splitting device69,86,87) has been widely used to evaluate the activity of the catalyst. Generally, the smaller the overpotential, the better the catalytic performance.


(2) Tafel slope. 
The Tafel slope plays a key role in evaluating the kinetic properties and revealing the mechanism for the OER. The Tafel slope is generally determined by the Tafel equation expressed as η = blogj + a, where η represents the overpotential, b refers to the Tafel slope, j is the current density, and a is a constant related to the exchange current density (j0).88 A lower Tafel slope indicates faster reaction kinetics.


(3) Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). 
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is a significant indicator to evaluate the specific surface area and the number of catalytically active sites.89 The ECSA is positively correlated with the double layer capacitance (Cdl), which can be calculated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the non-faradaic region. A larger Cdl value indicates higher exposure of active sites and a higher available electrochemical active area. For instance, glassy carbon (GC) electrode-supported powdery catalysts require polymeric binders to anchor the active materials on the GC surface during the electrode preparation processes, resulting in a limited mass loading and partial sacrifice of electrocatalytic active sites.68 However, the fabrication of carbon-supported nanoarray catalysts can avoid the use of polymeric binders and simplify the electrode preparation processes.11 Accordingly, high mass loading and high conductivity endow carbon-supported nanoarray catalysts with a higher Cdl value than GC electrode-supported powdery catalysts.


(4) Stability. 
Long-term stability is another indispensable factor in evaluating catalysts for practical applications.30,90 Stability is evaluated by the change of CV or linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves before and after a test. Furthermore, another method to judge the stability is comparing the change of current density (or potential) after running for a certain time at a constant potential (or current density). Generally, a smaller change implies better stability for the OER.


(5) Turnover frequency (TOF). 
TOF stands for the intrinsic activity of catalysts. The TOF value is generally derived from formula TOF = jS/4nF, where j represents the current density, S refers to the area of the working electrode, n is the electron transfer number, and F is the Faraday constant. A larger TOF demonstrates higher intrinsic activity.


(6) Faradaic efficiency (FE). 
FE is defined as the electron conversion efficiency to produce oxygen. The FE value is calculated from the ratio between the experimental and theoretical values of oxygen production. Theoretical oxygen production is generally derived from the integration of the chronoamperometric or chronopotentiometric analysis. The experimental yield of oxygen is obtained from gas chromatography measurements.

3. Design and preparation of free-standing nanoarray catalysts
3.1 Solvothermal/hydrothermal synthesis
Solvothermal/hydrothermal synthesis is one of the most fascinating approaches to fabricate nanoarray architectures with a desirable morphology on carbon substrates attributed to the low cost and simple operation. Versatile nanoarray architectures could be obtained by precisely tailoring the reaction time, temperature, pH, reactant ratio/concentration, solvent effects, etc.69,91–100 For example, Mai et al. successfully fabricated NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays on CC (NiFe-LDH NSAs/CC) via a hydrothermal method (Fig. 2a).101 The morphology and average thickness regulation of NiFe-LDH sheets supported on CC was achieved with different molar ratios between Ni and Fe (Ni/Fe: 5/1, 1/1, and 1/3). The results of SEM observations indicated that NiFe-LDH NSAs/CC with the 3/1 ratio of Ni/Fe demonstrated interconnected ultrathin nanosheets. Guan et al. developed a one-step hydrothermal strategy to synthesize NiS–MoS2 hetero-nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (NiS–MoS2 HNSAs/CC).102 The thickness of NiS–MoS2 HNSAs/CC can be tuned by varying the concentration of C12H25SO4Na (SDS). When the pH value in the resultant solution was adjusted to approximately 5.4 by SDS (0.2 mol L−1), the SEM imaging results showed that NiS–MoS2 HNSAs/CC featured uniformly cross-linked nanosheet structures. Furthermore, Manikandan et al. prepared a series of V3O7 nanowires on CFC (V3O7/CFC) via changing the hydrothermal reaction time.103 When the hydrothermal reaction time reached 48 hours, 48@V3O7/CFC with a spider web-like morphology presented denser nanowires compared to 12@V3O7/CFC and 24@V3O7/CFC.

3.2 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis
CVD is capable of preparing self-supported electrocatalysts. The gas–solid reaction is one of the most important reactions in a typical CVD process. In general, the gas phase may be directly provided or may be transformed from other powdery materials such as S, Se, and NaH2PO2 at high temperatures. CVD methods possess advantages of simple operation, high yield, suitable fabrication of complex structures, etc.68,69,104–107 For example, Wang et al. synthesized CNTs@CoSxSe2(1−x) on CC by a continuous two-step CVD method. In the first CVD process, ZIF-67 was converted to CNTs@cobalt nanoparticles with the assistance of melamine at a high temperature.108 Next, cobalt nanoparticles were converted to cobalt sulfide and cobalt selenide using sulfur powder and selenium powder as raw materials through sulfidation and selenization strategies, thus preparing CNTs@CoSxSe2(1−x) with a complex composition. Sun's group constructed honeycomb-like CoN–Ni3N/N–C nanosheets on flexible carbon cloth (CoN–Ni3N/N–C/CC) via a solvothermal synthesis with post-nitrogenization treatment (Fig. 2b).109 The structure and morphology of CoN–Ni3N/N–C/CC at four different temperatures were obtained by pyrolysis of Ni–Co LDH/CC under an NH3 atmosphere. The results of SEM observations indicated that CoN–Ni3N/N–C/CC at 300 °C featured a well-maintained 3D porous honeycomb-like structure. Furthermore, Miao et al. synthesized Ni particles encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes on CP (Ni@N-CNTs/CP) composites via an in situ CVD synthesis.110 The morphology of Ni@N-CNTs/CP prepared with different nickel contents and temperatures has been further explored. When Ni contents on CP were 2.5 mg cm−2 at 700 °C, SEM imaging demonstrated that the CNT structures with Ni particles can be observed on the surface of CP.
3.3 Electrochemical deposition
Electrochemical deposition is a facile technology for synthesizing nanoarray architectures on carbon substrates with the advantages of simple procedures, low working temperatures, high deposition rates, low cost, etc.67,69,111–113 Moreover, nanoarray architectures are highly controllable by tuning the electrolyte concentration, electrodeposition time, scan rate, current, voltage, pH value, conductive substrates, etc.111,114–119 As presented in Fig. 2c, Wang et al. prepared CoO@FeOOH core–shell nanowire on CC (CC@CoO@FeOOH–NWAs) via a facile solvothermal synthesis coupled with the electrodeposition method.120 A series of CC@CoO@FeOOH–NWAs can be obtained at different electrodeposition times (50 s, 100 s, and 200 s). Prolonging the electrodeposition time can increase the diameter of the nanowire. Lu et al. fabricated Ni(OH)2@Ni on CP (Ni(OH)2@Ni/CP) by the electrodeposition method.122 A series of Ni(OH)2@Ni/CP samples were prepared with different CV cycles. With increasing CV cycles, porous Ni(OH)2@Ni spheres can be clearly observed on the surface of CP.
3.4 Template synthesis
Template synthesis methods have been explored as efficient strategies to fabricate architectural nanoarrays. To date, template-assisted preparation of architectural nanoarrays has mainly involved two approaches: soft template methods and hard template methods. Specifically, ZnO, SiO2, and NaCl are classical examples of hard templates,123,124 while organic polymers, PEO106–PPO70–PEO106 (F127), and EO20–PO70–EO20 (P123) are typical soft templates.125–127 For instance, He et al. fabricated nitrogen-doped hollow hexagonal carbon nanoprism arrays on CFC (N–HCNP/CFC) using ZnO as the hard template (Fig. 2d).121 The diameter and areal density regulation of ZnO nanoprisms on CFC can be tailored by varying the concentration of KMnO4 solution to activate CFC. When the concentration of KMnO4 solution is 1 mM, the diameter of obtained ZnO nanoprisms is the smallest. N–HCNP/CFC was prepared by CVD using ZnO nanoprism arrays as the hard template and ethylenediamine as the carbon source. Chen et al. synthesized porous CoSe2 nanosheet arrays on CC using MOF–Co as the hard template.128 MOF–Co was etched through the solution etching treatment prior to selenization. Then, porous CoSe2 nanosheets on CC arrays were successfully obtained by a selenization strategy at 450 °C. Furthermore, Zheng et al. reported that molybdenum sulfide with a 3D macroporous foam structure on CP (3D F–MoS2/CP) was prepared using SiO2 as the hard template.129 3D foam MoS2 was produced through a SiO2 nanosphere template. After the heat treatment of 3D SiO2@MoS2/CP, SiO2 templates were finally removed by HF (aq) treatment. Owing to the nature of different templates, controllability, and uniformity architectural arrays with desirable shapes are achieved. However, some templates such as SiO2 and anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) must be removed via etching agents (e.g. HF or NaOH), which can cause some potential threats to the environment and loss of potential active sites.
4. Carbon substrate supported nanoarray catalysts for the OER
4.1 Metal oxide nanoarrays
Various metal (i.e., Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, W, Mn, and Mo) oxides have been explored as highly efficient OER catalysts (Table 1).72,130–134 For example, Yadav et al. reported that self-supported 3D nanoflower-like CuCo2O4 arrays on CC (CuCo2O4@CC) were obtained via a hydrothermal reaction coupled with thermal treatment.135 The 3D nanoflower structure was assembled by nanosheets, which is beneficial to expose electrochemically active sites. The self-supported 3D nanoflower-like CuCo2O4 arrays on CC exhibited a low overpotential of 288 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Ye et al. synthesized Co–Fe oxide nanosheet arrays on CFP via a one-step hydrothermal reaction.136 Benefiting from the three-dimensional macroporous structure and satisfying electrical properties of CFP (Fig. 3a and b), Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP with the optimized Fe3+ concentration reached the current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a overpotential of 359 mV for the OER in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 3c). Inspired by the advanced strategy of heteroatom doping, P/Mo–Co3O4 on CC (P/Mo–Co3O4@CC) with 2D honeycomb-like nanosheet arrays has been fabricated as a robust electrocatalyst through surface functionalization with phosphate ions and Mo doping.137 The introduction of Mo can not only optimize the adsorption free energy of the *OOH intermediate, but also enhance intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. P/Mo–Co3O4@CC displayed a low overpotential of 365 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 59.4 mV dec−1 for the OER in 1.0 M KOH. Lei and co-workers reported that Fe–NiO–NiCHNA hollow nanotube arrays were grown on CFP via in situ anodic oxidation (Fig. 3d and e). The Fe doping method can downshift the d band of metal sites, resulting in the improvement of OER catalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH. Fig. 3f shows that Fe–NiO–NiCHNAs exhibited an excellent OER performance with a small overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm−2 as well as a low Tafel slope (43.4 mV dec−1).138 The construction of 3D hierarchical nanostructures has been proposed as an efficient strategy to increase the active surface area of an electrocatalyst for promoting OER performances. Self-supported CoOx PHCS with ultrathin nanosheets on CFP were obtained via electrochemical deposition.139 A series of CoOx PHCS with different morphologies were obtained by changing CV deposition cycles. Fig. 3g and h show the morphology of CoOx PHCS after three cycles of electrodeposition. Benefitting from the porous/hollow nanostructure and hierarchical nanostructure, CoOx PHCS required an overpotential of only 300 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 3i).

Most of the layered double hydroxides (LDH) can be expressed by the general formula [M2+1−x M3+x (OH)2]x+ [Ax/n]n−mH2O,145–148 where M2+ and M3+ stand for divalent metal cations (i.e., Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Mg2+ and Zn2+) and trivalent metal cations (i.e., Fe3+, Mn3+, Ga3+, Al3+, In3+ and Cr3+), An− refers to the interlayered anions. Benefiting from a simple preparation process, low cost, good flexibility, adjustable metal ions, and alternative interlayer anions, LDHs have been considered as one of the most active electrocatalysts for the OER.40,147 To date, a large number of literature studies related to LDH (Table 2) have been reported as OER electrocatalysts, such as NiCo, NiFe, NiGa, NiAl, NiFeMn, CoMn, CoAl, CoCo, CoFe, MgAl, MgGa, ZnAl, ZnGa, ZnCo, LiFe, FeNiCo (oxy)hydroxide systems, and so on.148–163 Self-supported LDH arrays on carbon substrates can not only increase the overall conductivity and accelerate rapid charge transfer, but also provide abundant catalytic sites, resulting in the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity. Besides, the abundant interfaces can boost rapid charge transfer from carbon substrates to the surfaces of nanoarray catalysts.164 Yu and co-workers reported a hydrothermal synthesis of NiCo-LDH-nanoarrays vertically grown on CFP.165 The open frameworks derived from LDH nanoarrays exposed abundant active sites and promoted fast charge transport, yielding an outstanding OER performance with a small overpotential of 307 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 64 mV dec−1, and long-term stability at 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Ye et al. prepared partially Fe-substituted CoOOH nanosheets (Fe0.33Co0.67OOH) on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) by electrochemical deposition and an in situ anodic oxidation method (Fig. 4a–c).115 The X-ray absorption fine spectra (XAFS) result demonstrated the presence of FeO6 octahedra in CoOOH, implying that CoO6 octahedra in CoOOH are partially substituted by FeO6 octahedra during the formation process of Fe0.33Co0.67OOH (Fig. 4d). DFT calculations have been used to study the free-energy changes of OER intermediates in FeCoOOH and CoOOH (Fig. 4e). The result revealed that introduction of Fe into CoOOH can not only lower the energy levels of intermediates, but also increase the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of Fe0.33Co0.67OOH. Benefiting from abundant active sites, high conductivity, and large electrochemical active surface areas, optimal Fe0.33Co0.67OOH PNSAs/CFC produced a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential (266 mV) and exhibited a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 and a high TOF value of 1.42 × 10−2 s−1 at an overpotential of 300 mV in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 4f and g). For trimetallic (oxy)hydroxide based OER electrocatalysts, Wang et al. fabricated NiCoFe layered triple hydroxides (NiCoFe LTH) on CFC with porous structures via electrochemical deposition.149 The electrocatalytic OER properties of varied concentrations of Ni2+, Co2+ and Fe3+ have been systematically investigated in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The results demonstrated that trimetallic LTH with the highest catalytic activity possesses the Ni:Co:Fe of 1:1:1 (mole ratio). Owing to the exposure of abundant active sites, free diffusion of gas, and synergistic effects in trimetallic LTH, the self-supported NiCoFe LTH exhibited superior OER catalytic activities with a small overpotential of ∼239 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a low Tafel slope of ∼32 mV dec−1, and an excellent durability for approximately 12 h of continuous electrolysis (∼1% fluctuation) at 20 mA cm−2. Doping other atoms into (oxy)hydroxides can not only regulate the electronic structure, but also increase the conductivity and activate the catalytic sites, thereby significantly boosting the OER catalytic performance.166 Hu's group successfully synthesized Fe-doped NiOOH catalysts on CC via a solvothermal and photochemical–electrochemical method.167 Raman characterizations demonstrated that the surface of the NiOOH matrix contained plenty of Fe active sites. A series of Fe-doped NiOOH catalysts were obtained by varying the concentration of Ni and Fe. When the Fe content is 6%, the OER performance of Fe–NiOOH@CC was superior to that of RuO2 and other NiFe analogues in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, Fe–NiOOH@CC possessed a good OER performance with a small overpotential of 351 mV to reach a current density of 20 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 64 mV dec−1, and stable catalytic activity for at least 55 h of continuous electrolysis at approximately 150 mA cm−2. Li et al. designed a gadolinium (Gd)-doped hierarchal NiFe-LDH in situ grown on CC (Gd-NiFe-LDH@CC) via a hydrothermal approach (Fig. 4h and i).168 The Gd doping not only regulated the electronic structure of NiFe-LDH but also increased the number of oxygen vacancies, thereby adjusting the adsorption energies of intermediate species during the OER process. The Gd content in Gd-NiFe-LDH@CC was tuned by varying the molar content of Gd(NO3)3. When the molar content of Gd(NO3)3 was 2.5%, Gd-NiFe-LDH@CC required a lower overpotential of 210 mV to generate a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and exhibited an excellent OER catalytic activity with a smaller Tafel slope of 40.9 mV dec−1, robust electrocatalytic stability, and near 100% Faraday efficiency in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 4j and k).

4.3 Metal phosphide nanoarrays
Metal phosphides have attracted attention in the field of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution owing to their abundant reserves, ample active sites, and ultra-high conductivity.175,176 To date, various catalysts based on metal phosphides have been reported including but not limited to CoP,177,178 Ni2P,119,179 NiCoP90,180,181 and CoFeP182,183 for the OER in alkaline electrolytes (Table 3). For example, Hu's group prepared CoP nanoneedle arrays grown on CC by a hydrothermal reaction and pyrolysis method.177 On account of good electrical contact between the catalyst and support, CoP grown on CC showed an excellent OER catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and good durability for 17 h of continuous electrolysis at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Besides single-metal phosphide arrays, as shown in Fig. 5a, bimetallic (NiFe) phosphide arrays grown on nitrogen-doped CC (CC-NC) were synthesized by Bian et al.184 DFT results showed that NiFeP required the lowest total free energy of the OER compared to Ni2P and Fe2P (Fig. 5e). Benefiting from the electronic structure modulation of Ni and Fe, the large specific surface area, and fast charge/mass transport originating from three-dimensional CC-NC (Fig. 5bd), the CC-NC–NiFeP exhibited an excellent OER performance with a small overpotential of 145 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 5f and g). Teng et al. synthesized NiFe phosphide nanosheet arrays with hierarchical porous structures on CC using a hydrothermal synthesis and pyrolysis method.185 Meanwhile, the OER performances of varying Ni/Fe ratio (Ni/Fe: 9/1, 8/2, 7/3, and 6/4) for NiFe–P/CC were further studied in 1.0 M KOH. Combined with the electronic structure modulation and the optimized synergistic effect by tuning the Ni/Fe ratio, the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of Ni0.8Fe0.2–P/CC can be improved, thus boosting the overall OER performance. On account of the exposure of abundant active sites, the hierarchical porous structure and high conductivity of the nanoarrays, the optimized Ni0.8Fe0.2–P/CC afforded current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of only 278 and 320 mV, respectively.

Elemental doping has been proved to be an efficient strategy to further boost the OER catalytic activity of metal phosphides. Yan et al. synthesized carbon paper supported Cu doped CoP nanoarrays (Cu–CoP NAs/CP) via a hydrothermal approach followed by a phosphorization process (Fig. 6a).186 The incorporation of Cu into CoP nanosheets favored the chemical structure transformation from Cu–CoP to Cu–CoOOH during the OER measurements (Fig. 6b), which serves as the real active sites for the OER. The ratio of Cu and Co in Cu–CoP NAs/CP can be tuned by controlling the amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O. DFT calculations demonstrated that it required a lower adsorption energy of the OER intermediate (O*) on the Cu–CoOOH surface compared to pristine CoOOH (Fig. 6d), which might account for the ameliorated OER catalytic activity. Owing to the tailored electronic structure, enhanced conductivity by the incorporation of Cu into CoP, and the sufficient exposure of abundant active sites due to the 3D self-supported nanoarrays on CP (Fig. 6c), the optimal Cu0.08Co0.92P NAs/CP showed an excellent OER performance with a small overpotential of 411 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M phosphate puffer solution (PBS, pH = 7) (Fig. 6e and f). Guo and co-workers fabricated Fe doped NiCoP nanoplates with hierarchical nanostructures on CC via electrodeposition and PH3 plasma treatment.187 The Fe doped NiCoP can not only increase the numbers of active sites, but also modify the electronic structure, thus boosting the OER intrinsic catalytic activity. Besides, the existence of defects allows the exposure of more OER active sites, which might account for the enhancement of OER performance. The OER performances of Fex–NiCoP/CC could be further investigated by controlling the ratio of Ni/Co/Fe precursors (Ni/Co/Fe: 1/1/0.5, 1/1/1, 1/1/2, and 1/1/3). The optimized Fe2–NiCoP/CC with a higher Fe doping content exhibited a superior catalytic activity and required an overpotential of 293 mV to generate a current density of 50 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Surface reconstruction is an attractive strategy to boost OER performances and bring changes in the intrinsic properties of materials (e.g. microstructures and electrical conductivity), leading to changes in the energy barrier and kinetics of catalytic reactions.188 Importantly, the structure and composition of pro-catalysts can be changed during the electrocatalyst reconstruction, which are known as the true catalytically active species.84,189,190 Kim et al. fabricated Co3O4-modified CC supported P@polymeric cobalt phthalocyanines containing S linkers (P@pCoPc-1/Co3O4|CC) via a solvothermal reaction coupled with a phosphorization strategy.22 The XRD results of P@pCoPc-1/Co3O4|CC) after the OER showed the characteristic peaks originating from CoOOH, demonstrating the phase transition during the OER process. Furthermore, a few thicker nanoplates are observed in flattened CoP nanosheets after the OER, indicating the surface reconstruction of P@pCoPc-1/Co3O4|CC. Co species in P@pCoPc-1/Co3O4|CC are transformed into CoOOH species during electrocatalyst reconstruction, which are known as the real active sites. The overall advantages of surface reconstruction, enhanced hydrophilicity, cooperative catalytic effects between Co3O4 and CoP, and high conductivity endowed P@pCoPc-1/Co3O4|CC with good OER performances, such as an overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 57.4 mV dec−1, and good stability for 12 h in 1.0 M KOH.

4.4 Metal sulfide nanoarrays
Owing to the advantages of high conductivity and sufficient exposure of more edge sites, metal sulfides, such as CoS2, MoS2, CuCo2S4, Ni2CoS4, NiCo2S4, FeCo2S4, and so on,69,127,193–205 have been explored as promising electrocatalysts in the field of water oxidation (Table 4). For instance, Deng and co-workers prepared CoS2 nanosheets on CC (CoS2/CC) though the method of chemical transformation and heat treatment.198 CoS2/CC with abundant active sites exhibited a good OER performance with overpotentials of 291 and 364 mV to drive current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 as well as a low Tafel slope (69 mV dec−1). Wang et al. synthesized carbon paper/carbon tubes/cobalt–sulfide (CP/CTs/Co–S) via electrodeposition followed by a sulfuration process.127 CP/CTs/Co–S possessed a unique 3D array architecture, which can be in favor of increasing the exposure of electrocatalytic active sites, ameliorating electron transport capability, and enhancing the release of oxygen gas. The CP/CTs/Co–S electrode required an overpotential of 306 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH.

Bimetallic sulfides have been regarded as efficient electrocatalysts to enhance OER performance. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, tip-welded FeCo2S4 nanotube arrays on CC (FeCo2S4 NTA/CC) were prepared via a hydrothermal synthesis and template-free method by Hu et al.202 A series of FeCo2S4 NTA/CC were obtained by varying the concentration of Na2S·9H2O (0.01 M, 0.05 M, 0.1 M, and 0.2 M). When the concentration of Na2S·9H2O was 0.1 M, the resulting FeCo2S4 NTA/CC showed the highest catalytic activity compared to other concentrations in 1.0 M KOH. The unique hollow interior originating from FeCo2S4 NTA/CC (Fig. 7b–d) provided more abundant electrocatalytic active sites, and fast charge/mass transport as well as fluent electrolyte diffusion. On account of the advantages of the unique structure and synergistic catalysis of bimetallic sulfides, optimized FeCo2S4 NTA/CC displayed high durability and an outstanding OER catalytic performance with overpotentials of 278 mV, 305 mV, and 317 mV at 10 mA cm−2, 50 mA cm−2, and 100 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 7e–g). Zhang and co-workers designed and fabricated NiCo disulfide nanowires grown on CC [(Ni0.33Co0.67) S2 NWs/CC] via a hydrothermal synthesis coupled with sulfuration.206 In order to screen out (Ni0.33Co0.67) S2 NWs/CC with high OER performance, Ni–Co precursor NNs/CC was vulcanized at 350 °C, 450 °C and 500 °C, respectively. The electrochemical results showed that (Ni0.33Co0.67) S2 NWs/CC at 350 °C exhibited better catalytic activity than those at other temperatures. Benefiting from high conductivity, and the porous network structure as well as the synergistic effect of bimetallic disulfides, the as-obtained (Ni0.33Co0.67)S2 NWs/CC acted as a superior OER electrocatalyst, requiring an overpotential of 295 mV to afford a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. To enhance the OER catalytic activity of metal sulfides, elemental doping is an efficient strategy to ameliorate the OER catalytic activity. Thangasamy et al. synthesized ferrocene-incorporated cobalt sulfide (Fc-CoxSy) directly grown on acid pretreated carbon fiber via solvothermal synthesis.197 Carbon fiber (CF) was pretreated with HNO3 solution for 4 h, resulting in better OER electrocatalytic activity for Fc-CoxSy on CF. Combining with the strong synergistic effect by Fe and Co, and the exposure of active sites, the electrocatalytic activity of Fc-CoxSy on CF can be enhanced,. For example, the resulting Fc-CoxSy on CF achieved a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 315 mV and exhibited a Tafel slope of 82.1 mV dec−1 in 1.0 M KOH. Wu and co-workers obtained NiCo2S4 hollow nanotubes decorated with CeOx on CC (CeOx/NiCo2S4/CC) via a hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 8a).203 Hollow nanoarrays with hierarchical pores originating from CeOx/NiCo2S4/CC (Fig. 8b–d) were beneficial for the exposure of active sites, and fast rapid charge transfer, offering a fast path for electrolyte ions as well as electron transfer. The incorporation of CeOx into NiCo2S4/CC was also beneficial to modify the surface electronic states, and create more defect sites as well as accelerate electron transfer, which might account for the ameliorated OER catalytic activity. As a result, CeOx/NiCo2S4/CC showed superior durability and catalytic activity toward the OER with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a relatively weak Tafel slope of 126 mV dec−1 in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 8e–g).

4.5 Metal selenide nanoarrays
Metal selenides have been considered promising candidates toward the OER due to their low cost, and high chemical stability as well as superior electrocatalytic activity.209–213 A large number of literature studies have reported metal selenides as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts (Table 5).49,53,212,214–223 For example, Chen et al. synthesized hollow core-branch CoSe2 nanoarrays on CC using a hydrothermal synthesis and pyrolysis method.222 CoSe2 nanoarrays on CC exhibited a superior OER catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 170 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH because of their large specific surface area and high conductivity. Yu and co-workers designed NiCoSe2 crimped nanosheets grown on CC (NiCoSe2/CC) using an electrodeposition technique.212 A series of Ni–Co–Se compounds can be obtained by changing the ratio of Ni/Co (Ni/Co: 1:0, 3:1, 2:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:0) and the OER performances of the corresponding electrocatalysts can be explored in 1.0 M KOH. Electrochemical tests revealed that Ni–Co–Se compounds at a Ni/Co ratio of 1:1 exhibited the best OER activity among all the as-prepared samples. NiCoSe2/CC possessed superhydrophilic properties, superficial micro/nano structures, and large surface areas, which favored accelerated OER kinetics and thus boosted catalytic activity. DFT results demonstrated that the cooperative effects of bimetallic diselenides are beneficial for improvement in the electrical conductivity, which might account for the ameliorated catalytic activity toward the OER. This unique morphology endowed NiCoSe2/CC with superior electrocatalytic activity, requiring a low overpotential (255.8 mV) to generate a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Nickel–iron selenide [(Ni0.75Fe0.25)Se2] nanosheets with a porous structure on CFC were prepared via a hydrothermal process and subsequent selenization strategy.221 Combined with the porous nanostructure, high electrical conductivity, and large electrochemical active surface areas from selenides on CFC, the electrocatalytic activity toward the OER was improved. The as-prepared (Ni0.75Fe0.25)Se2 on CFC exhibited an outstanding OER performance with a small overpotential (255 mV, at 35 mA cm2), a low Tafel slope (47.2 mV dec−1), and high durability of 28 h continuous electrolysis in 1.0 M KOH solution. The heterostructure strategy is an efficient strategy to improve OER intrinsic catalytic activities though increasing the amount of accessible active sites, accelerating mass/charge transfer, regulating the electronic structure, and optimizing the adsorption energies of intermediates.224–227 For instance, Liu et al. fabricated NiFe(OH)x/(Ni,Fe)Se2 nanoarrays on CC with core–shell heterostructures via hydrothermal synthesis, and the electrodeposition technique coupled with the selenization strategy (Fig. 9a–c).216 The electronic coupling at the interface of heterostructures [(Ni,Fe)Se2 and NiFeOOH] can not only increase electrical conductivity, but also optimize adsorption energy of intermediates during the OER, which could be confirmed by the DFT calculations according to the theoretical models (Fig. 9d and e). The OER properties of NiFe(OH)x/(Ni,Fe)Se2/CC at different electrodeposition times (200 s, 300 s and 400 s) were investigated in 1.0 M KOH. Electrochemical results showed that NiFe(OH)x/(Ni,Fe)Se2/CC at an electrodeposition time of 200 s exhibited higher OER catalytic activity compared to other electrodeposition times. Combined with the good conductivity of metallic materials, the optimized NiFe(OH)x/(Ni,Fe)Se2/CC produced a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential (180 mV) and exhibited a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec−1 as well as excellent durability of 20 h (Fig. 9f and g). Park and co-workers synthesized Cu-(a-NiSex/c-NiSe2)/TiO2 on CC using a continuous two-step solvothermal reaction coupled with a selenization strategy (Fig. 9h).215 The incorporation of Cu into heterostructures of amorphous NiSex/crystalline NiSe2 can be in favor of the modulation of the electronic structure, exposure of electrocatalytic active sites, and enhancement of electrical conductivity. The resulting Cu-(a-NiSex/c-NiSe2)/TiO2 on CC (Fig. 9i) exhibited a good OER catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 339 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 54.2 mV dec−1 (Fig. 9j and k).

4.6 MOFs and their derivative nanoarrays
MOFs are a new class of inorganic–organic hybrid materials constructed by the connection of metal ions or metal clusters and organic ligands though coordination bonds.228–239 Owing to their large porosity, high specific surface area, and tunable chemical composition, MOFs show unique advantages in the field of electrocatalysis.237,240–243 Furthermore, the existence of unsaturated metal sites in carefully engineered nanoscale MOFs could be in favor of improving OER catalytic activity.236 Lou's group synthesized NiMn-MOFs on multi-channel carbon fibers (MCCF) via two-step hydrothermal synthesis coupled with a ligand exchange strategy (Fig. 10a).237 X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and DFT results revealed the adsorption energies of intermediates (O2 and OH− species) on Ni sites of NiMn-MOFs were lower than those of Mn sites, indicating that Ni sites serve as the real active sites during the OER process. A well-designed architecture (Fig. 10b–d) and synergetic effect between Ni and Mn endowed MCCF/NiMn-MOFs with high catalytic activity toward the OER. As displayed in Fig. 10e–g, MCCF/NiMn-MOFs exhibited excellent electrocatalytic stability and OER performance with a small overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 86 mV dec−1 in 1.0 M KOH. To improve the OER catalytic activity by exposure of unsaturated metal active sites for MOFs, Zheng et al. constructed 2D FeNi LDH nanosheets packed with 1D MOF nanorods (2D/1D FeNi LDH/MOF) on carbon cloth via a continuous two-step solvothermal method.244 MOFs were smartly fabricated by a facile strategy of in situ transformation of some of the LDH into a MOF. The OER performance of 2D/1D FeNi LDH/MOF with different reaction times (1 day, 2 days and 3 days) was explored. The results indicated that the sample prepared at 2 days displayed higher OER catalytic activity compared to its counterparts in 1.0 M KOH. 2D/1D FeNi LDH/MOF featured a unique 2D/1D combined structure, abundant exposed active sites, and large contact areas, resulting in an excellent OER catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 272 mV at 100 mA cm−2, a low Tafel slope of 34.1 mV dec−1, and superior durability for over 36 h.

MOFs are regarded as potential electrocatalysts for a highly efficient OER reaction (Table 6). However, the poor conductivity and stability of MOFs hinder their direct electrocatalytic applications.182,236 Most of the MOF-derived carbon-based materials featuring large porosity and high specific surface areas245 are considered the most ideal candidates for the OER (Table 6). For instance, Wang's group reported hollow NiCo2O4 arrays derived from ZIF-67 on CC via a solution reaction, ion-exchange and etching process coupled with an additional annealing treatment.246 Unique hollow and porous structures endow CC@NiCo2O4 with abundant reaction sites and a short path for charge shuttling, which could be beneficial for OER kinetics. For instance, CC@NiCo2O4 exhibited a good OER performance with a small overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. As displayed in Fig. 11a, Wang's group also synthesized hollow Mo–CoP nanoarrays on CC using a solution reaction and subsequent phosphide process.247 The incorporation of Mo into CoP arrays (Fig. 11b and c) can be in favor of electronic structure modification, exposure of reaction sites, a short ion diffusion path, and release of oxygen gas. As shown in Fig. 11d, DFT results demonstrated that the Mo-doping strategy can effectively reduce the total free energy of the OER compared to that of CoP arrays, indicating favorable OER kinetics. Mo–CoP nanoarrays on CC required an overpotential of 305 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Besides, Mo–CoP nanoarrays on CC exhibited a lower Tafel slope (86 mV dec−1) and superior durability compared to CoOOH, Co3O4, and Ir/C (Fig. 11e–g).

5. Conclusions and prospects
The design and exploration of OER catalysts with high efficiency, affordable cost, and robustness are of great importance for electrocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen fuels. Different from most high-performance OER electrocatalysts which require polymeric binders during electrode preparation and thus give rise to increased resistance of the corresponding electrodes, self-supported electrocatalysts based on carbon substrates show various advantages such as high conductivity, rapid charge transfer, increased accessibility of catalytic active sites and robust stability, which are beneficial to facilitate the release of gases and boost activity and stability for the OER. In this review, we have presented the various synthetic strategies of carbon substrate-based free-standing electrocatalysts, such as solvothermal/hydrothermal synthesis, electrochemical deposition, chemical vapor deposition, template methods, etc. Besides, we have also systemically summarized the significant contributions to OER development for diverse self-supported electrocatalysts including metal oxides, metal hydroxides/oxyhydroxides, metal phosphides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, and MOFs and their derivative nanoarrays. Furthermore, we have listed the data of the above electrocatalysts and compared their OER catalytic performance in terms of key performance parameters including the Tafel slope, overpotential, electrolyte, and stability.
Although significant achievement has been made for designing OER electrocatalysts, the design/synthesis and practical applications of free-standing catalysts based on carbon substrates are still challenging. Firstly, despite extraordinary achievements on carbon materials as substrates including CC, CP, CFP, and CFC, the selectivity of carbon materials for the preparation of free-standing OER catalysts is still limited. Free-standing catalysts operate at a high current density in the electrolyte for a long time, requiring further evaluations of their chemical and structural durability. Tremendous efforts should be devoted to ameliorating the OER catalytic activity focusing on the following aspects: (1) positively exploring various synthesis methods for the preparation of high-efficiency free-standing catalysts; (2) developing more advanced strategies of heterojunction construction, heteroatom doping, intrinsic defect generation, and nanostructure, and crystal facet engineering for improving intrinsic catalytic activity should emerge as a hot research topic toward the OER.
Secondly, reconstruction phenomena have not drawn enough attention and need more investigation. Reconstruction phenomena mainly occur on the surface of catalysts such as oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, and alloys during the OER process, which always induces structure and composition changes and indeed boosts electrocatalytic activity. Besides, owing to the unclear mechanism of the reconstruction phenomena, exploring and precisely identifying the true catalytically active sites are still challenging. Fortunately, in situ/operando characterization technologies can track the reconstruction behavior and offer powerful evidence during the OER process, which can be beneficial to establish the structure–activity correlation, reveal the real active sites, and discover the OER mechanisms.
Thirdly, although theoretical simulations have made a significant contribution to predict the trend, and reveal the structure–activity correlation for many OER electrocatalysts, inconsistency between the theoretical and experimental results is an inevitable concern owing to the oversimplification of the real-world OER conditions for the theoretical structural model. Thus, advanced theoretical models of DFT computation should be proposed for better design of electrocatalysts. In addition, the proposed structural model involving the influence of the electric field, electrocatalyst defects, electrochemical double-layer, and solvation should be thoroughly considered and further researched.
With substantial efforts made by scientific and technological workers, we believe that advanced free-standing catalysts based on carbon substrates will make a great contribution to the large-scale preparation of high-purity hydrogen and resolve the issues of environmental pollution and energy shortage.
