We introduce the first-ever effective n-type compact layer through facile anodizing of titanium wire, achieving a considerable power conversion efficiency of 3.85%, which remains stable during bending; spray-deposited silver nanowires (Ag NWs) are used as the top electrode instead of gold. The ease of fabrication, low cost of materials, and all-solid-state structures result in a simple approach to developing electronic textiles for harvesting solar energy and blazes a new trail in the field of fiber-shaped photovoltaics.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials (CH3NH3PbX3; X = Cl, Br, I) have come to the forefront among light absorbers as front-runners for the new era of photovoltaics due to their advantages such as low processing cost, tunable band gap and ability to absorb light over the entire visible spectrum.1 Especially, since the photovoltaic behavior of organolead halide perovskite compounds was first reported,2 the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been increasingly enhanced by substituting a solid-state hole conductor for the usual liquid electrolyte.3 In addition, the distinctive properties of perovskite material – ambipolar transport,4 long electron–hole diffusion length,5 shallow traps,6 and solution processing7 – have enabled various approaches to PSC structures. These approaches include planar heterojunction, mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold (m-TiO2), and meso-superstructured PSC.4,8,9 Consequently, Seok et al. recently attained a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.1% in PSCs.10 Flexible PSCs with a high energy conversion efficiency of up to 12.2% have also been developed.11 These achievements reflect the potential for PSC application in electronic devices that require flexibility and high-performance light harvesting.
In modern electronics, low weight, flexibility, and portability are regarded as indispensable features; fiber-based structures are also highly desirable for future electronic systems that require functions to be woven into flexible electronic textiles.12 The development of fiber-based electronic device structures is, therefore, highly desirable in state-of-the-art energy harvesting systems. Recently, Peng et al.13 fabricated coaxial fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells (CFPSCs), which have a PCE of 3.3%. In that work, perovskite materials were incorporated between m-TiO2 on a compact layer based on stainless steel and multi-walled carbon nanotube sheets as an electrode.
The CFPSCs were superior to any other coaxial one-dimensional fiber-shaped photovoltaic devices from the point of view of both performance and stability. However, obtaining a continuous compact layer of TiO2 (c-TiO2) and depositing uniform m-TiO2 for a photoanode were quite challenging.
In this communication, we demonstrate an innovative dimple compact layer of TiO2 (dc-TiO2) and the applicability of Ag NWs as transparent electrodes in CFPSCs (Fig. 1). The dimple structure as a compact layer played an important role in depositing additional m-TiO2, the retention of fiber structures during annealing, and resilience during bending. Moreover, Ag NWs were easily fabricated via solution process engineering. This completely solution-processed CFPSC exhibited a high PCE of 3.85% and endured repeated mechanical deformation. These results indicate the potential for large-scale fabrication of these CFPSCs via roll-to-roll processing,14 enabling their use in a broad spectrum of applications including clothing-integrated photovoltaics.

Results and discussion
To produce the desired CFPSCs, 127 μm diameter titanium wire was prepared. In the case of stainless steel, it is well established that thin Fe2O3 films form on the surface during the annealing process (400–500 °C), hindering electron transport to the substrate.15 For Ti, the semiconductor oxide layer may function in a similar manner to m-TiO2, and aid in electron transport. The dimple structure was formed by modifying Ti wires through electrochemical anodization and the m-TiO2 layer was deposited thereon. The photoactive layer was then coated with a mixture of DMF, NMP, and CH3NH3PbI3 compounds and subsequently dipped in toluene, thereby resulting in highly uniform layers. Solution-based Ag NWs were then sprayed onto these layers of HTM. For comparison, we prepared Ti wire, which was electro-polished in order to remove the rough outermost layer,16 and annealed in air. The characteristics of dc-TiO2 were examined by using field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Details of the complete device fabrication procedure and characterization are provided in the ESI.†Fig. 2a and b show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the polished Ti wire and dimple compact layer structure, respectively. The dc-TiO2 was obtained in two steps, namely: (i) an anodization process of Ti wire and (ii) the removal of the nanotube layer. Specifically, Ti wire was exposed to a sufficiently high anodic voltage in an electrochemical environment and then ultrasonically vibrated in order to remove the nanotubes grown from the surface, thereby resulting in well-formed dimples. When we anodized the Ti wire at a low bath temperature, the nanotubes could not be detached from the surface even after ultrasonic treatment for tens of minutes; ultrasonication was usually completed within 5 min. The diameter of the dimples varied mainly with the applied voltage (Fig. S1†). The optimal dc-TiO2, which had the highest PCE of 3.85%, was obtained by anodizing for 4 h at 60 V and at a bath temperature of 15 °C. This anodization was performed in organic electrolytes containing fluoride ions and was followed by an ultrasonic treatment in a solution of H2O and hydrogen peroxide in a volume ratio of 7:3. Adding hydrogen peroxide to the H2O enabled easy removal of the nanotubes during sonication; however, increasing the amount of hydrogen peroxide resulted in chemical etching of the dc-TiO2.17

Fig. 2c and d show AFM images of each Ti wire. The surface area of Ti wires was measured as 1 μm × 1 μm. The actual surface area of polished Ti wire was 1.05 μm2, an increase of 5.03%, whereas that of dc-TiO2 was identified to be 1.18 μm2, an increase of 18.1%; in fact, the dimple structure resulted in a 12.3% increase in the surface area. It is noteworthy that the improvement in electrical contact area between Ti wire and m-TiO2 enhances the performance of photovoltaics as a result of the reduced electrical resistance of the TiO2/Ti wire interface.18,19 Obtaining uniform m-TiO2 on the polished TiO2 (Fig. S2a†) was quite difficult. In contrast, the surface of the dc-TiO2 was entirely covered with m-TiO2, indicating that the deposition of m-TiO2 onto dc-TiO2 (Fig. S2b†) is favored. We also found that, in contrast to the case of the polished TiO2, the dimple structure on the Ti wire acted as a framework that protected the wire from thermal contraction during annealing. The thermally oxidized layer of dc-TiO2 and the polished Ti wire were further characterized using EDX, as shown in Fig. 2e and f and S3†. This ∼30 nm thick oxide layer confirmed that the layer of the dimple structure consisted of an oxide. The peaks in the XRD pattern of the dc-TiO2 all corresponded to the rutile crystal structure of TiO2 (Fig. S4†). In addition, the precursors of perovskite infiltrated the m-TiO2 by means of dip coating without the problem of pore filling as in the case of TNT perovskite solar cells.20 However, a homogeneous perovskite capping layer, which is crucial for cell performance,21 was not formed on the m-TiO2 even after prolonged dipping (Fig. S5†). Therefore, anti-solvent engineering, i.e., toluene dipping was conducted in order to obtain a uniform surface.22,23 The resulting surface morphology is shown in Fig. 3a. For comparison, the CFPSC with polished Ti wire was also fabricated via anti-solvent engineering, and a dense and uniform perovskite film (Fig. 3a) was obtained. Table 1 lists the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE obtained under standard air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5G) conditions, as extracted from the J–V curves (Fig. 3b). The data suggest that the CFPSC with dc-TiO2 exhibited superior performance compared to that of the CFPSC with polished Ti wire; in contrast, the PCEs were relatively low owing to the low FF. This low FF stemmed mainly from the “s-shape” of the J–V curves (Fig. 3b). In this study, solution-based Ag NWs were adopted for the top electrode because Ag NWs possess the merits of high transmittance, mechanical flexibility and a low sheet resistance. Such polar solvents are, however, relatively harmful to the perovskite film. Therefore, we controlled the spray conditions by diluting the Ag NWs in IPA. The Ag NWs had an average diameter and length of ∼60 ± 5 nm and a few tens of micrometers, respectively. These Ag NW films exhibited moderate transmittance of 350–900 nm (70% at 550 nm); Fig. S6 in the ESI† shows the detailed characteristics of the Ag NWs. The HOMO level of Spiro-MeOTAD is 5.22 eV, while the work function of the as-sprayed Ag NWs is 4.5 eV, as shown in Fig. S7.†24 The difference in the energy level of the as-sprayed Ag NWs and the Spiro-MeOTAD has a detrimental effect on hole transport, thereby resulting in S-shaped J–V curves.25 We applied a 1 min oxygen plasma treatment to the spray-deposited Ag NWs in order to reduce the barrier to charge transport.24,26 After this treatment, the FF increased from 0.37 to 0.44. Furthermore, the best performing CFPSCs exhibited Jsc, Voc, and FF of 11.97 mA cm−2, 0.731 V, and 44%, respectively, with a PCE of 3.85% under standard AM 1.5G conditions (inset of Fig. 4c). The corresponding J–V curve and cross-sectional images of the CFPSC are shown in Fig. 4c and a, b, respectively. We observed from Fig. 4b that, despite being dipped in the anti-solvent, the perovskite photoactive layer was composed of two strata, which account for the high performance of the mesoscopic PSCs.21 To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE ever reported for CFPSCs. Furthermore, the flexibility of the CFPSCs was investigated by bending the devices. No severe deterioration in their performances was observed during 50 cycles and the changes of PCEs in accordance with bending cycles are described in Fig. 4d. Over 93% of the initial PCE value was retained, indicating that our device exhibits remarkable stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have explored a high-efficiency coaxial fiber-shaped perovskite photovoltaic that uses original dc-TiO2 and spray-deposited Ag NWs as the top electrode. We found, via AFM measurements, considerably increased surface area in the dimple surface allowing for increased contact between substrate and mesoscopic scaffold, which is able to effectively reduce electrical resistance and thus induce cell performance enhancement. Moreover, dipping the as-deposited perovskite photoactive layer in anti-solvent resulted in full surface coverage and the formation of an upper layer. The Ag NW top electrode provides a highly conductive, transparent, and flexible top contact in an inverted device configuration. More importantly, the processes were all fully solution-based, and are therefore feasible for large-scale industrial production. We believe that these results will spur the development of fiber-shaped photovoltaics based on organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite in light of the demand for next-generation electronic technology.
