    , Accepted 2nd September 2021First published on 3rd September 2021AbstractSolution processed metal oxides with the characteristics of low cost, high mobility and good transparency are promising materials for the carrier transport layer of optoelectronic devices. So far, solar cells with tin oxide (SnO2) transport layers have been demonstrated to achieve high efficiency and long-term stability. However, it is still a challenge to achieve highly efficient and long-term stable quantum dot light-emitting devices (QLEDs) with SnO2. Here, we prepared QLEDs with a low-temperature SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL), and found that the residual hydroxyl group (–OH) seriously degenerates the operating lifetime of the QLEDs. UV-Ozone treatment (UVO) is then proposed to decompose the residual tin hydroxide into stoichiometric SnO2. Compared with the control QLEDs with SnO2 without UVO, the QLEDs with UVO SnO2 possess the same efficiency, but show a nearly two times higher operating lifetime. With an initial luminance of 500 cd m−2, the QLEDs with UVO SnO2 show a half-luminance operating time of 2168 h, while that of the control device is only 1015 h.
Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their advantages of size-tunable emission wavelength, high color purity, high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), solution processability, and chemical stability.1–6 Therefore, quantum dot light-emitting devices (QLEDs) have been considered as a promising candidate for next generation display and solid-state lighting technology.3–7
At present, the state-of-the-art QLEDs usually adopt an inverted hybrid structure consisting of organic hole transport layers (HTLs) and inorganic metal oxide electron transport layers (ETLs). So far, zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium oxide (TiO2) and tin oxide (SnO2) have been used as ETLs in QLEDs.7–11 Compared with ZnO (∼3.4 eV) and TiO2 (∼3.3 eV), SnO2 with a wider bandgap (3.6–4.2 eV) stands out as promising due to its desirable features, such as higher optical transmittance in the visible range, a higher electron mobility and a lower conduction band (CB).12 As a result, SnO2 has been widely used to achieve high-performance perovskite photovoltaic devices.13–15 However, few efficient QLEDs are reported so far with solution-processed SnO2 ETLs.
In fact, solution-processed SnO2 is always prepared by decomposing tin hydroxide precursors through a series of high-temperature reactions.16,17 According to the reported studies,16,17 a high temperature over 500 °C is required to prepare high-purity metal oxides. However, a high annealing temperature may damage the substrate and reduce the device performances of light-emitting devices.18 Meanwhile, there are usually residual tin hydroxide precursors in the SnO2 films prepared by low-temperature processes, because of incomplete reaction.16,19,20 Low-temperature SnO2 films thus always contain a larger number of hydroxyl (–OH) groups.16,19–21 As we know, –OH groups can seriously affect the operating lifetime of light-emitting devices. As a result, it is necessary to address the issue of –OH groups in the low-temperature process.
In this paper, we investigate the device performances of QLEDs with SnO2 ETLs annealed at different temperatures, and find that an annealing temperature of 120 or 140 °C is the best for the luminous efficiency. In fact, higher temperatures are needed to decompose tin hydroxides such as Sn(OH)2 and Sn(OH)4. UV-Ozone treatment (UVO) is then proposed to decompose the residual tin hydroxide into stoichiometric SnO2. With the UVO SnO2 ETL, the QLEDs show no change in luminous efficiency, but a 110% improvement in the operating lifetime. With an initial luminance of 500 cd m−2, the half-luminance operating time of the optimized device and the control device is respectively 2168 h and 1015 h. The prolonged operating stability is ascribed to the reduced –OH groups, with the confirmation of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses.
Experimental section
The SnO2 sol–gel precursor (15% in a water colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The red core–shell CdSe/ZnS QDs were bought from Suzhou Xingshuo Nanotech Co., Ltd. The 4,4′,4′′-tris(carbazol-9-yl) triphenylamine (TCTA), 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP), di-[4-(N,N-di(p-tolyl)-amino)-phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC), MoO3 and LiF powder used in this paper were purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. The device structure involved in this paper is: indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO2 (45 nm)/CdSe/ZnS QDs (20 nm)/CBP (5 nm)/TCTA (10 nm)/TAPC (35 nm)/MoO3 (3 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The QLED fabrication process includes two steps: spin-coating and vacuum evaporation. Before the device is prepared, the substrates with sputtered ITO need to be cleaned. Then, the SnO2 ETL and QD emitting layer (EML) are deposited by spin-coating and annealed layer by layer. Subsequently, the substrates are transferred into a vacuum chamber, and the remaining functional layers are evaporated with the pressure below 6 × 10−4 Pa. The deposition rates of the organic layer and metal are both 0.1–0.2 nm s−1. Four separate devices with an active area of 10 mm2 are formed on the ITO-coated substrate.
All unpackaged devices are measured in air at room temperature. The luminance–current–voltage characteristics and spectra are obtained using a Goniophotometric Measurement System based on a spectrometer (GP-500, Otsuka Electronics Co. Osaka, Japan) simultaneously.22 The transient electroluminescence (EL) characteristics of the devices are collected using a transient EL measurement system consisting of an arbitrary waveform generator (Rigol, DG5102), a digital oscilloscope (Rigol, DS4054), an avalanche photodiode (C30902), and a fast data collection system (SPCS-T04). The XPS measurements are performed using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 with Al Kα radiation. The device operation lifetime is measured using an organic light-emitting device (OLED) aging tester (Shanghai University, ZJZCL-1, China). Thermo analysis is performed using a NETZSCH STA 449F3.
Results and discussion
The device structure (Fig. 1a) involved in this paper is: ITO/SnO2/CdSe/ZnS QDs/CBP/TCTA/TAPC/MoO3/Ag. The energy level diagram of the device is presented in Fig. 1b. In the QLEDs, SnO2 is used as the ETL, and trilayer CBP (5 nm)/TCTA (10 nm)/TAPC (35 nm) is used as the HTL. SnO2 is prepared by a spin coating process from its sol–gel precursor aqueous solution, which is purchased from Alfa Aesar.

Firstly, QLEDs with SnO2 ETLs annealed at different temperatures are prepared, and their device performances are studied. Fig. 1c and d show their current density–voltage–luminance and external quantum efficiency (EQE)–luminance characteristics. To clearly see the performance variations, we summarize the normalized device performances (Fig. 1e) to their maximum values of the QLEDs with different annealing temperatures. As we see from Fig. 1c and e, the current densities of the QLEDs with annealing temperatures of 80 and 100 °C are higher than the others, but their efficiencies are lower than the QLEDs with annealing temperatures from 120 to 180 °C. It is due to the residual solvent which damages the organic functional layers and leads to a large current leakage.23 The QLEDs at 120 and 140 °C show smaller current densities and higher efficiencies. However, when the annealing temperature is higher than 140 °C, the current density increases and the efficiency decreases with an increase in the annealing temperature. Especially, the QLED at 260 °C has the worst efficiency among all the devices. To clarify this, we investigated the surface morphology and lateral conductivity of an ITO/SnO2 film under an annealing temperature of 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, and 260 °C. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) is 1.246 nm, 1.357 nm, 1.634 nm, 2.045 nm, 3.956 nm, and 6.650 nm, respectively. We can also see that when the annealing temperature is over 200 °C, the microscopic morphologies are particularly different from those of low annealing temperatures.18 The lateral conductivities were measured by using SnO2 films coated on two separated ITO electrodes24 with a separation of 1 mm × 1 cm and the measured results are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). We can see that the film conductivity remains nearly unchanged when the annealing temperature is below 200 °C. Therefore, when the annealing temperature is over 140 °C, the reduction of the efficiency and the increase of the current density are related to the increased surface roughness of the SnO2 films. A high RMS can easily lead to high current leakages and low out-coupling efficiencies.
Although the QLEDs at 120 and 140 °C show higher efficiencies than the others, these low temperatures are not high enough to decompose the tin hydroxide precursors sufficiently.16,17 We then measure the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) heat flow and the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) weight loss of the SnO2 sample, which is obtained by drying the purchased precursor aqueous solution in air at room temperature. The measurement results are shown in Fig. 2a. It can be seen from the TG curve (red line) that a 14.38% weight loss is observed as the temperature increases from 20 to 400 °C. Accordingly, three endothermic peaks are observed from the DSC curve (purple curve). Considering that the weight loss is very fast in the temperature range of 20–120 °C, the peak at 58.4 °C can be attributed to the desorption of the physically adsorbed water on the material surface and the chemically bonded water. When the temperature ranges from 160 °C to 400 °C, the TG curve shows a slow weight loss with the temperature, and the DSC curve shows two endothermic peaks. It is reported that Sn(OH)2 and Sn(OH)4 are the main two compositions of the sol–gel precursors, and their thermal decomposition temperature is in the range of 160–400 °C.25,26 Therefore, the two endothermic peaks in Fig. 2a are reasonably considered as the result of decomposition of Sn(OH)2 and Sn(OH)4. The subsequent increase in weight after 400 °C can be ascribed to the synthesis of SnO2, in which SnO reacts with oxygen. These results reveal that the decomposition temperatures of the tin hydroxides are much higher than 120 °C, which is the best annealing temperature for the device efficiency (see Fig. 1e). Because of the incomplete reaction, there would still be a large number of residual –OH in the SnO2 films annealed at 120 °C. To reduce the hydroxyl groups, UVO treatment is carried out to treat the SnO2 film, as shown in Fig. 2b. The UVO treatment is expected to convert the residual precursors such as Sn(OH)2 and Sn(OH)4 into SnO2 (Fig. 2c), and thereby reduce the –OH component to improve the device performance.

Subsequently, two QLEDs are prepared by using SnO2 ETLs (annealed at 120 °C) with and without UVO. The one with UVO is marked as device wi-UVO, and the other one is marked as device wo-UVO. Their EL characteristics are presented in Fig. 3. At the same voltage, the current density and luminance (Fig. 3a) of wi-UVO are higher than those of wo-UVO. However, as shown in Fig. 3b and c, there are no significant differences in the device efficiencies. The maximal current efficiency (CE), power efficiency (PE) and EQE of device wo-UVO and device wi-UVO are 14.14 cd A−1, 12.93 lm W−1, and 9.89%; and 14.47 cd A−1, 14.15 lm W−1, and 10.18%, respectively. Their normalized EL spectra (Fig. 3d) are almost identical with the emission peak at 632 nm. It indicates that the UVO treatment will not affect the exciton recombination and carrier balance of the devices. The inset is a photo of wi-UVO operating under a bias of 4 V, and the device exhibits uniform and bright emission.

The operating lifetimes of the two devices are measured at a constant current of 6 mA and their results are shown in Fig. 4a. Device wi-UVO has a half-luminance operating time (L50) of 13.7 h for L(0) = 8600 cd m−2, which is much higher than that of device wo-UVO (7.3 h for L(0) = 8000 cd m−2). L50 of device wi-UVO for L(0) = 500 cd m−2 is then extrapolated as 2168 h by using equation L0nT50 = a constant with n = 1.78,23 and that of device wo-UVO is 1015 h. To clarify the improvement of the operating lifetime, transient EL, capacitance–voltage (C–V) and electron-only characteristics are measured. Fig. 4b shows the transient EL characteristics of the two devices. The delay time and rising time of the two devices are almost identical, meaning that the exciton recombination rate in the two devices is not changed.27Fig. 4c shows their capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics. The two devices show similar geometric capacitance before the voltage is applied. However, as the bias voltage increases, the capacitance increase of device wi-UVO is smaller than that of device wo-UVO. It indicates that UVO leads to less carrier accumulation in device wi-UVO.24 It is considered that the –OH groups at the ETL/EML interface can form electric-field-induced dipoles. The formed interfacial dipoles will form a reverse electric field against the external electric field, and thus prevent electron injection from the ETL to the EML. It will then lead to electron accumulation at the ETL/EML interface and hole accumulation at the ZnS/CBP interface (in Fig. 1b and 4c). The carrier accumulation will also form a built-in field to counteract the interfacial dipoles. Thus, the current density–voltage characteristics of devices wi-UVO and wo-UVO are nearly identical. Because of the thick insulting shell of ZnS,28 the hole accumulation has no obvious quenching effect on the excitons, and thus the two devices exhibit the same efficiencies. Electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/SnO2/QDs/LiF/Al are fabricated and their current–voltage characteristics are presented in Fig. 4d. The electron current of device wi-UVO is higher than that of device wo-UVO, which is caused by the lack of a built-in electric field formed by carrier accumulation. This fact also supports our conclusion about the carrier accumulation issue in the two devices. Besides, the higher carrier accumulation can lead to the burden of a higher electric field intensity on the insulting ZnS shell and the ETL/EML interface. It can be reasonably considered that it is the main reason for the lower operating lifetime of device wo-UVO.

To confirm the reduction of the –OH groups in device wi-UVO, XPS measurements are then performed to characterize the chemical composition and the chemical bonding state of the wo-UVO and wi-UVO films. It is reported that UVO treatment could produce ultraviolet light with peaks of 185 nm and 254 nm, whose photon energies are higher than the binding energies of some chemical bonds. Therefore, some chemical bonds in the films are broken by UVO. The Sn and O elements are observed in the XPS survey spectra in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b and c show the high-resolution O 1s spectra of the wo-UVO and the wi-UVO films, respectively, while Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows their combined figure. The main peak at 530.8 eV belongs to the Sn–O bond, the peak at 532.0 eV is assigned to the Sn–OH bond, and the peak at 534.0 eV belongs to H2O.19,29,30 Based on the calculation of the fitting results, the intensity of Sn–OH is approximately reduced by 33% after UVO treatment. It indicates that the residual precursors, such as Sn(OH)2 and Sn(OH)4 in the wo-UVO film, can be partly converted into SnO2via UVO treatment. Carrier accumulation is mainly formed to counteract the reverse electric field of the interfacial dipoles at the ETL/EML interface. The reduction of the –OH groups thus leads to a reduction in carrier accumulation inside the device (see Fig. 5c). The reduced carrier accumulation is considered as the main reason for the significant improvement in the operating stability of device wi-UVO.

Conclusions
In conclusion, it is demonstrated that QLEDs with a low-temperature SnO2 ETL show poor operating stability because of the presence of residual precursors. UVO treatment is proposed to reduce the hydroxyl groups at the ETL/EML interface. With such an SnO2 ETL, the operating lifetime of QLEDs can be improved nearly two times. The maximal CE, PE and EQE of the optimized device with the UVO SnO2 ETL are 14.47 cd A−1, 14.15 lm W−1 and 10.18%, respectively. Besides, with an initial luminance of 500 cd m−2, T50 of the optimized device reaches 2168 h. The improvement in the operating stability of QLEDs is also proved to be caused by the reduced hydroxyl groups in the UVO SnO2 film.
