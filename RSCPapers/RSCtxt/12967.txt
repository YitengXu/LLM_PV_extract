    , Accepted 12th February 2019First published on 13th February 2019AbstractIn this work an innovative quasi-solid state (QSS) polymer electrolyte containing rare earth oxide nanoparticles and an ionic liquid was developed to enhance the efficiency and stability of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For the fabrication of DSSCs, 3-decyl-1,2-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([dmim]BF4−) ionic liquid (IL) and dysprosium oxide nanoparticles (Dy NPs) were synthesized, characterized and introduced into electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers. These nanofibers were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS-UV), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques and examined for their electron uptake, porosity and ionic conductivity. The photovoltaic and electrochemical effects of this electrolyte in DSSCs were investigated. From the results, it was found that DSSCs assembled with IL and Dy NPs incorporated PVDF nanofibers had a higher conversion efficiency of 6.4% and they had better stability than liquid electrolyte. These polymer electrolyte based DSSCs were found to be stable and efficient and such electrolytes show promising potential for use in solar cells.
1. Introduction
The conversion of sunlight to electricity using dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has become a pertinent research area after its inception in 1991.1,2 In the cell, the electrolyte has a key role in charge transportation between the electrodes and the regeneration of dye during DSSC operation.3 Despite the excellent performance of liquid electrolyte containing the triiodide/iodide redox couple, DSSCs suffer drawbacks such as leakage, evaporation, contamination of the solvents, and electrode corrosion, which hinder the outdoor applications of DSSCs.4,5 To surmount these problems, several attempts have been made to replace liquid electrolyte with polymer and solid state electrolytes.6,7 These electrolytes also have the disadvantages of low short circuit current density (Jsc) and cell performance. QSS electrolytes in the form of electrospun polymer nanofibrous membranes have attracted significant attention through the development of one dimensional fiber morphologies with unusually high porosity. Their interconnected architecture has the capacity to entrap a large amount of liquid electrolyte. Their extremely high specific surface area, flexibility in surface functionalities and superior mechanical performance further aid their implementation as electrolytes.3,6 Electrospun PVDF membrane based electrolytes are endowed with these properties and the presence of electron withdrawing fluorine atoms improves the ionic transport and reduces the recombination rate at semiconductor/polymer electrolyte interfaces.7,8 However, compared to a cell with liquid electrolyte, a PVDF membrane shows low efficiency, maybe due to its crystalline nature and inadequate ionic conductivity.9 Some attempts have been reported to enhance the ionic conductivity and reduce the crystallinity of such membranes by the addition of nanoparticles4,11 (e.g., CoS, ZnO). Further, the dispersion of nanoparticles creates continuous ion transport pathways inside the polymer matrix, into which the redox pair (iodide/tri-iodide) can easily migrate. This improves the ionic mobility and promotes the ionic conductivity, which is aided by the porosity of the membrane.13 Besides, NPs containing polymer electrolyte showed high penetration through a porous TiO2 film surface. The polymer crystallinity is reduced by such addition of NPs due to their interaction (Lewis-acid base type) with the polar group of the polymer, which in turn improves the electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the polymer membrane.14 Utilization of rare earth oxide nanoparticles in polymer electrolyte remains unexplored. Among them, Dy NPs are thermally and photochemically stable and their semiconductive nature helps in fast diffusion of charge carriers.15,16 Imidazolium based room temperature ionic liquids (RT-ILs) possess lone pairs of electrons on the nitrogen atom, which can easily form charge transfer complexes with iodine, thereby preventing iodine sublimation.10,11 The ILs also increase the ionic conductivity of the polymer matrix through π–π stacking of imidazole segments.12 The cation moiety such as the imidazole group on the uncovered TiO2 surface hinders the unfavourable recombination reactions and enables DSSCs to exhibit superior performance. In the present work, an IL and Dy NPs were synthesized and incorporated into PVDF by electrospinning and their photovoltaic and electrochemical properties and stability were studied.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) (average Mw = 275000 g mol−1), dysprosium hexanitrate, iodine (I2), lithium iodide (LiI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), acetonitrile (AN), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), NaBH4, 1,2-dimethylimidazole, acetone and absolute ethanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. Bromodecane was purchased from SRL Chemicals Pvt. Ltd, India. Nanocrystalline TiO2 (nc-TiO2) paste coated on FTO conducting glass (15 Ω sq−1), cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,20-bypyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719 dye) and a Pt counter electrode were purchased from GreatCell Solar's DSL, Australia.
2.2 Instrumentation
The morphologies and sizes of the Dy NPs and polymer fibers were examined with high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM; FEI Quanta FEG 200). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was conducted to investigate the presence of dysprosium oxide nanoparticles using a JEOL instrument model JEM 2100 with a voltage of 200 kV and the filament used was LaB6. The functional groups were identified by Fourier transform infrared studies using a BRUKER Alpha FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The ionic liquid ([dmim]BF4−) was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR studies (Bruker, CDCl3, 400 MHz) using TMS as an internal standard. To observe the thermal behaviour of the prepared samples, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (NETZSCH DSC-204 Differential Scanning Calorimeter) was performed in the temperature range of 25 to 300 °C. The crystallinities of the polymer nanofibers and nanoparticles were examined using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker). The optical band gaps of the polymer fibers and material were calculated by using a JASCO V-750 DRS-UV/VIS spectrophotometer. The thicknesses of the electrospun nanofibers were measured by using a digimatic micrometer. The photovoltaic performance (J–V) was measured under 1 sun using a LOT Technologies solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 global filter, which provided a light power of 100 mW cm−2. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed using a CH Instruments electrochemical workstation. A three electrode system was used, where a glassy carbon (GC) electrode with a diameter of 3 mm served as a working electrode (WE) and a platinum wire as a counter electrode (CE). Ag/AgCl used as a reference electrode (RE) dipped in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7. The surface of the WE was polished with alumina powder before use. The samples were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) so as to get a concentration of 3 mM. All the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded at 25 °C with a scan rate of 50 to 500 mV s−1. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed using a cell consisting of membrane based electrolyte sandwiched between two fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) platinised glass plates. The limiting current was obtained from the LSV curves using a Metrohm Autolab 302 N potentiostat/galvanostat. The measurements were performed in the −0.8 to 1.5 voltage range, with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
2.3 Preparation of 3-decyl-1,2-dimethyl-1H-imidazole-3-ium tetrafluoroborate
1,2-Dimethylimidazole (C5H8N2) (0.2 mol) and bromodecane (C10H21Br) (0.1 mol) were taken in a round bottom flask immersed in an oil bath and heated to 140 °C. After 2 h, a slightly viscous liquid was formed. At this point, the solution was allowed to cool for 10 minutes, and again heated in the oil bath to about 140 °C for 10–15 minutes.17 The oil was dried under vacuum. An aqueous solution of NH4BF4 (1.43 g, 0.013 mol) was then added, resulting in the product (3 g, 0.013 mol). The solution was stirred continuously until phase separation occurred. The compound obtained was extracted with dichloromethane and evaporated in a vacuum and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give C15H29BF4N2.
Yield = 96% (3.31 g); pale yellow solid; 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): 0.7149 (t, 3H), 1.53–1.788 (m, 2H), 3.8928 (s, 3H), 3.84 (s, 3H), 4.04–4.06 (t, 2H), 7.2830 (d, 1H), 7.389 (d, 1H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz) δ (ppm): 26–32 (CH2), 14 (CH3), 122–123 (CH2CH2), 144 (N–C–N), 36 (N–CH3).
2.4 Synthesis of dysprosium oxide nanoparticles
Dy NPs were synthesized using a previously reported combustion method16 by the reaction of dysprosium nitrate (Dy(NO3)3·6H2O) with urea at 650 °C. The combustion method was chosen because of the good yield and simplicity of the procedure.
2.5 Preparation of polymer solution for electrospinning
A PVDF solution (A) with a concentration of 20% (w/v) was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of PVDF into a DMF/acetone (4:1, v/v) mixed solution. The Dy NPs–PVDF solution (B) was made by dissolving 0.3 g of Dy NPs in solution A. An IL/PVDF solution (C) was prepared by adding 0.3 g of IL in DMF to solution A. An IL/PVDF/Dy NPs solution (D) was prepared by adding 0.3 g of Dy NPs to solution C. All the prepared solutions were stirred continuously for 24 h at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution.
2.6 Electrospinning process
The prepared polymer solutions were loaded into a 5 mL syringe attached to a stainless steel needle with a diameter of 0.3 mm. The flow rate of the solution was adjusted to 0.5 mL h−1 with the help of a syringe pump. An aluminium foil was placed as a collector at a distance of 15 cm from the needle and a power supply of 26 kV was used. The electrospinning parameters were set after optimization. The electrospun fibers were labelled A, B, C, and D accordingly based on their solutions.
2.7 Ionic conductivity (σ), electrolyte uptake (U) and porosity (P) measurements
The ionic conductivity value of the electrolyte (σ) was calculated using eqn (1):18 (1)where ‘l’ is the thickness of the membrane (30 μm), ‘R’ is the bulk resistance of the electrolyte, and ‘A’ is the area of the membrane used in the cell (0.49 cm2). The bulk resistance (R) of the electrolyte was calculated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat over the frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 MHz at an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The conductivity cell was prepared by sandwiching electrospun polymer electrolyte between two stainless steel blocking electrodes. The bulk resistance could be obtained from the complex impedance plot.

Eqn (2) was used to evaluate the electrolyte uptake (U)18 (2)where ‘mo’ and ‘m’ are the masses of the electrospun nanofibrous membranes before and after immersion in liquid electrolyte respectively. The excess electrolyte solution on the surfaces of the membranes was wiped.
The porosity (P) of the electrospun nanofibers was evaluated by the n-butanol uptake method. In this method, the electrospun nanofibrous membrane was dipped in n-butanol for 2 h. The weights of the membranes before and after immersion were measured. The porosities (P%) of the membranes were investigated using eqn (3):19 (3)where ‘mi’ and ‘ma’ were the weights of the electrospun nanofibrous membranes before and after soaking in n-butanol and ‘ρb’ and ‘ρs’ are the densities of the n-butanol and dried electrospun membranes respectively.
The ratio of the weight of the dried electrospun nanofibers (m) to volume (v) [length (0.7 cm) × breadth (0.7 cm) × thickness (30 μm)] was used to find the density of the electrospun membranes (ρs).
2.8 Linear sweep voltammetry
This technique was applied to measure the diffusion coefficient of tri-iodide ions in the polymer membrane electrolyte, where steady state current could be achieved. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of I3− has a significant role in increasing the short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and reducing the recombination reaction rate at the working electrode and electrolyte interface in QSS–DSSCs. When a voltage is applied, current will be produced due to the diffusion of I− and I3− in the electrolyte. The diffusion coefficient of tri-iodide ions (DI3−) can be calculated according to the following relationship.20 (4)where Jlim is the limiting current obtained from LSV curves, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reaction of tri-iodide to iodide, F is the Faraday constant, d is the distance between two electrodes, and C0 is the initial molar concentration of tri-iodide ions.
2.9 Fabrication of DSSC devices
The screen-printed annealed nc-TiO2 pasted electrodes were immersed in absolute ethanol containing 0.5 mM of N719 dye for 24 h at ambient temperature (∼30 °C) in the dark for the dye adsorption process. Electrospun nanofibrous mats were cut into 0.7 cm × 0.7 cm square pieces after drying and sandwiched between a dye adsorbed TiO2 photoanode and a Pt counter electrode as per earlier reports.20,21 The dye-adsorbed nc-TiO2 electrode and Pt counter electrode were assembled using a 60 μm thick hot melt gasket frame (MSOO4610-10) between the electrodes. The gasket frame with an optimal thickness of 60 μm was used as a spacer in order to allow for addition of a sufficient amount of electrolyte, which in effect improves the efficiency of the DSSC.6 For a spacer thickness of less than 60 μm, the required quantity of electrolyte for production of free electrons could not be added. A spacer thickness of greater than 60 μm leads to a higher electrolyte quantity, which would lead to the recombination of the free electrons due to the increase in their path length through the electrolyte. The cell was pressed together with two clips. A drop of the prepared electrolyte solution containing 0.05 M iodine, 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M of PMII, and 0.5 M of TBP in 1 mL of a mixture of valeronitrile (15%) and acetonitrile (85%) solvents was introduced into clamped electrodes. The active area of the DSSC was 0.49 cm2. For comparative studies, another DSSC was fabricated using liquid electrolyte without electrospun nanofibers.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 FTIR study

Fig. 1 displays FTIR spectra of the synthesized IL, Dy NPs and PVDF nanofibers. The IR spectrum of curve (i) displayed peaks at 615 cm−1 and 766 cm−1 attributed to the CF2 bending vibration, and the band at 1279 cm−1 was due to the C–F stretching vibration. The bands appearing at 1074 cm−1 and 1405 cm−1 corresponded to the CH2 bending vibration in the PVDF fibers.10 Furthermore, one can identify some of the peaks of the α phase at 1408, 1192, 1074, 877 and 520 cm−1, and that of the β phase10 at 840 cm−1. In curve (ii), a shift in the peak at 549 cm−1 assigned to Dy–O– was observed.16 In curve (iii), the bands occurring at 756 cm−1 and 1376 cm−1 indicate the presence of the C–H bending vibration. The peak at 1170 cm−1 indicates C–N stretching and the peak at 1029 cm−1 indicates BF4− stretching vibration. The absorption peak at 1538 cm−1 indicates the CH3, CH2 asymmetric bending of the alkyl substituent. The peak at 3152 cm−1 can be assigned to the C–H symmetric and antisymmetric bending vibrations of imidazolium cations and the peaks at 2925 cm−1 and 2857 cm−1 were due to C–H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations.17

In curve (v), peaks due to the C–H symmetric and antisymmetric bending vibrations of imidazolium cations in the IL were observed at 3152 cm−1 and those due to the C–H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations were observed at 2925 cm−1 and 2857 cm−1 respectively. A peak corresponding to BF4− stretching vibration was observed at 1029 cm−1. These peaks confirmed the presence of the ionic liquid in PVDF nanofibers. In curves (iv) and (vi) the peak at 549 cm−1 indicated the presence of Dy NPs in PVDF. In curve (vi) a peak corresponding to BF4− stretching vibration was also observed at 1029 cm−1.
3.2 Study of the morphology

Fig. 2(A1) shows smooth, beadless electrospun PVDF nanofibers with an average diameter of 265 nm. Fig. 2(B1) exhibits the formation of synthesized Dy NPs, which were found to be irregularly shaped NPs with an average diameter of 93 nm. Fig. 2(C1) shows that the average diameter of the Dy NPs incorporated PVDF nanofibers decreases to 118 nm. This is because addition of Dy NPs into the polymer solution can lead to an increase in the conductivity of the solution.22,23 Addition of Dy NPs into the PVDF solution resulted in a higher charge density on the surface of the ejected jet due to the presence of more charge carriers, which imparts greater force of elongation. This favours the formation of smooth nanofibers of substantially smaller diameter. This effect is pronounced due to the high charge to size ratio of the Dy NPs. The addition of 0.3 g Dy NPs was determined by optimisation. On lowering the weight percentage, a mixture of beads and non-continuous fibers was generated, whereas an increased weight percentage hindered the fiber formation. Incorporation of the IL and Dy NPs into PVDF nanofibers (Fig. 2(D1)) leads to an increase in fiber diameter and rougher fiber surfaces compared to pristine PVDF.24 Rough surfaces of the fibers were observed after the addition of IL, which may be due to the change in the surface tension of the precursor solution, which gives the nanofiber a backward pulse on being stretched by electrical force. The rough surface increases the surface area, which can take up a large amount of electrolyte. Even though a gradual increase in conductivity is seen on adding the IL, other solution parameters like viscosity and surface tension show an increase as a consequence of the larger decyl group in the IL. It has been shown that higher viscosity results in higher chain entanglements, which cause delayed flow of the solution jet during its travel to the collector at fixed process parameters, resulting in an increased diameter.25 All the prepared nanofibers showed high porosity, which helped in the uptake of a large amount of liquid electrolyte, thereby facilitating faster ionic mobility and high conductivity.18

The dispersion of Dy NPs within the nanofiber was examined by TEM. From the TEM image, it was observed that the electrospun nanofiber was smooth and NPs agglomerated along the fiber direction.
3.3 Optical band gap studies by using DRS-UV spectroscopy
The direct band gap energy can be calculated by using Tauc's equation αhν = A (hν − Eg)n, where the α (absorption coefficient) value is calculated by taking the logarithm of the reciprocal of reflectance (α = log(1/reflectance)). The extrapolation of the linear portion of the curve intercepts the photon energy axis (E = hν). It is clear that the optical band gap energy decreases with the addition of the IL and NPs in accordance with previously reported studies.26,32 In Fig. 4, the direct band gap energy was found to be 3.56 eV for pure PVDF nanofibers, 2.43 eV for the IL, 2.21 eV for Dy NPs and 2.03 eV for Dy NPs/IL/PVDF. From the experimental results, it was evident that the band gap energy of pure PVDF decreases to 2.03 eV, which may be attributed to structural disorder due to doping. The Dy NPs/IL/PVDF membrane possessed a low band gap, showed higher transport and had high ionic conductivity. The present study confirmed the conversion of PVDF into a semiconducting membrane.

3.4 XRD analysis
An X-ray diffractogram of Dy NPs shows a crystalline morphology with peaks at 2θ of 28.3°, 34.5°, 39.2°, 47.7° and 58.6°, respectively, in accordance with the literature.15,16 In the XRD characterization of PVDF, the polymer shows an amorphous nature and peaks appeared at 14.14°, 30.07°, and 40.81°, indicating the α phase of PVDF in accordance with the literature.10 The Dy NPs incorporated PVDF polymer did not exhibit the characteristic peaks of Dy NPs and appeared as amorphous. This demonstrates that the dispersion of Dy NPs in the PVDF matrix changed PVDF to an amorphous form and the amorphous nature increased with increasing dispersion.23 When the IL was incorporated into the polymer solution, there was a decrease in the intensity due to the disorder in the polymer chains created by the IL that enhanced the amorphous phase of the system.26 IL and Dy NPs incorporated PVDF fibers also showed a decrease in the intensity of the peak. The percentage crystallinity is calculated by separating the intensities due to the amorphous and crystalline phases of the diffracted graphs. The percentage crystallinity (Xc%) is estimated as the ratio of the crystalline area (Ac) to the total area of the amorphous (Aa) and crystalline phases.27 Xc% = [Ac/(Ac + Aa)] × 100(5)The percentage crystallinity values for Dy NPs, PVDF, PVDF/IL, PVDF/Dy NPs, and PVDF/IL/Dy NPs were 64.5%, 42.6%, 39%, 31%, and 11.7% respectively. In this observation, the percentage of crystallinity decreased upon addition of the IL and Dy NPs (Fig. 5).
3.6 Ionic conductivity (σ), electrolyte uptake (U) and porosity (P)
A polymer membrane with high porosity was suitable for incorporation of a large amount of liquid electrolyte and can attain high ionic conductivity.14 All the prepared polymer membranes have good porosity due to their uniform interwoven structure as shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 shows the comparison of the electrolyte uptakes and porosities of the prepared polymer membranes as calculated from eqn (1) and (2).

3.7 Differential scanning calorimetry studies

Fig. 6 displays DSC thermograms of a pristine electrospun PVDF membrane along with IL, Dy NPs, and IL/Dy NPs incorporated electrospun PVDF membranes. It was observed that each sample exhibits an endothermic peak, indicating its respective melting temperature. The observed shift in Tm may be due to the change in the orientation of polymer chains upon addition of the IL and Dy NPs. It was also observed that the melting enthalpy (ΔHm) decreases on addition of fillers. These observations signify a decrease in crystallinity and therefore an increase in ionic conductivity on incorporation of the IL and Dy NPs into PVDF. A comparison of the DSCs of the pristine PVDF and IL/Dy NPs incorporated PVDF shows an absence of the sharp melting peak on incorporation. This further shows a change from crystalline to amorphous nature in the polymer on incorporation of IL/Dy NPs.

3.8 Electrochemical characteristics of the membrane electrolytes

3.8.1 Ionic conductivity. 
The ionic conductivity of electrospun PVDF was found to be 2.1 × 10−3 S cm−1. In addition, the incorporation of Dy NPs and the IL into the nanofibrous membrane improved the ionic conductivity to 3.2 × 10−3 S cm−1. The enhancement of the ionic conductivity in composite polymer electrolytes was attributed mainly to the formation of efficient ion transport channels.13


3.8.2 Ionic conductivity and temperature dependence study. 
The Arrhenius equation was used to describe the conductivity–temperature behaviour of membrane electrolytes.30 Arrhenius plots of ionic conductivity vs. temperature (temperature range 25 °C to 70 °C) of the different prepared membranes (Fig. 10) show that the ionic conductivities of the membrane electrolytes obey the Arrhenius equation. It was also observed that the IL and Dy NPs incorporated PVDF membrane based electrolyte shows higher conductivity than the others. The increment in ionic conductivity may be due to the polymer flexibility. From the DSC studies (Fig. 6), it was clear that the polymer loses its crystalline nature on the incorporation of the IL and Dy NPs. Such an attainment of amorphous nature leads to greater ionic conductivity. The increase in temperature increases the ionic mobility, which leads to an increased ionic conductivity, as can be seen in Fig. 7.

3.8.3 Electrochemical reversibility. 
The cyclic voltammograms of nanofibrous membranes obtained at a scan rate of 50 mV are shown in Fig. 8A and B. The PVDF/Dy NPs/IL membrane and PVDF/Dy NPs show cathodic and anodic peaks, indicating oxidation and reduction reactions respectively. The peak potentials (ΔEp) for PVDF/Dy NPs/IL and PVDF/Dy NPs are 47 mV and 55 mV respectively.28,31 A lower oxidation–reduction peak separation (ΔEp) indicates stronger electrochemical behaviour of the electrolyte, which implies better electron transfer in DSSCs. From Fig. 8 the calculated ΔEp value for PVDF/Dy NPs/IL (lower than 57 mV) shows electrochemical reversibility. Fig. 8C shows the cyclic voltammograms of PVDF/Dy NPs/IL at different scan rates, which proves its electrochemical stability also.31 Furthermore, in the scanned electrochemical window, PVDF was found to be electrochemically inactive and PVDF/IL had a reduction reaction peak only.

3.8.4 Diffusion coefficient measurements. 
The diffusion coefficients of the I−/I3− redox pair in the membrane based electrolyte systems were investigated using LSV by measuring the limiting current density (Fig. 9). The DI3− values of the liquid electrolyte and different membrane based electrolytes are tabulated in Table 3. During the redox couple regeneration cycle, the ionized dye molecules were reduced by iodide in the electrolyte by the reaction:2D+ + 3I3− ↔ 2D + I3−At the Pt electrode, the reverse reaction takes place:I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−Due to the large excess of iodide ions in the electrolyte, the current is limited by the diffusion of tri-iodide ions only. Thus, the limiting current density is obtained during the oxidation process. The addition of Dy NPs and the IL improves the diffusion coefficient to 3.49 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. The enhanced diffusion coefficient indicates a fast mobility of ions in the electrolyte system. The presence of NPs between the polymer chains reduces polymer–polymer chain interaction and increases the free volume of the system and increases the movement of the redox couple.20 Therefore, in the electrospun nanofibrous membrane, Li+ ions were immobilized through interactions with the polymer and fillers, whereas the mobile anions (I−/I3−) were able to diffuse. The conductivity values for the membrane based electrolytes were in agreement with the corresponding tri-iodide effective diffusion coefficient values, observed from LSV experimental results in Fig. 9.

3.8.5 EIS measurements. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at Voc under one sun to gain better insight into the charge transfer kinetics at the various interfaces of the fabricated cell. The Nyquist plot exhibits two semi-circles. The small semi-circle in the high frequency range is the charge transfer resistance (R1CT) at the redox electrolyte/Pt counter electrode. The large semi-circle in the low frequency region is the transport of injected electrons within the TiO2 film and the charge transfer across the TiO2/redox electrolyte interface (R2CT).28,29 The calculated values of the series resistance (Rs), R1CT, and R2CT for the five types of DSSCs are summarized in Table 4.

As is evident from Table 2, the DSSC fabricated with electrospun PVDF/Dy NPs/IL membrane electrolyte (iv) shows lower R1CT, R2CT and Rs compared to the DSSCs with electrospun PVDF, PVDF/IL and PVDF/Dy NPs electrolytes. The low value of R2CT facilitates more efficient electron transport at the TiO2/electrolyte interface and reduces the charge recombination rate.6,28 DSSC device (iv) also shows low charge transfer resistance (R1CT) of the Pt/electrolyte interface compared with the others, which indicates that addition of the Dy NPs and IL increased the I3− concentration at the Pt counter electrode associated with faster I3− transport in the polymer electrolyte. These results also confirmed the higher diffusion coefficient and ionic conductivity of the PVDF/Dy NPs/IL membrane electrolyte.

3.9 Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs
DSSC devices were prepared using the electrospun nanofibers and their photovoltaic performances were investigated. The best results in terms of open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and efficiency (η) for the DSSC devices using the electrospun PVDF/Dy NPs/IL nanofibrous membrane were found to be 0.81 V, 13.93 mA cm−2, 0.56% and 6.4% under AM1.5 respectively. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 11. All the data in terms of the photovoltaic and EIS parameters of DSSCs under standard conditions are summarized in Table 4.

The efficiency of PVDF/IL/Dy NPs was comparable with that of the liquid electrolyte but with the advantage of stability as shown in Fig. 12. It was also noted that there was an increase in the Voc and a decrease in the Jsc value of the PVDF/IL/Dy NPs when compared to the liquid electrolyte. The liquid electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity and good interfacial contact properties, which are essential for high Jsc and efficiency. The larger value of Voc of the membrane is related to the reduction of charge recombination on the TiO2 and electrolyte interface. Also the presence of IL containing imidazolium cation increases ionic conductivity, by forming a Helmholtz layer on the surface of TiO2 present on the working electrode. This hampers the direct contact of triiodide ions and the surface of TiO2, which efficiently suppresses the recombination reaction and enhances Voc of DSSC. The lower Jsc values of the membranes compared to the liquid electrolyte can be attributed to the limitation of ionic conductivity.32 However, other samples (i), (ii), and (iii) showed lower values for all the photo-voltaic parameters compared to (iv). This may be due to the fibre matrix of sample (iv), which provides a high diffusion coefficient, ionic conductivity, large porosity and low Rs, R1CT, and R2CT values.

3.10 Stability measurements
Stability studies of the prepared nanofibrous membrane electrolytes and liquid electrolyte with respect to time are presented in Fig. 12. Although the photovoltaic performance of the QSS-electrospun membrane based electrolyte was slightly lower than the corresponding liquid electrolyte based DSSC, the former revealed excellent long-term stability. Fig. 12A shows that the decay was much slower for the cell having the electrospun polymer nanofibrous membrane compared to that of the liquid electrolyte. Even though the power conversion efficiency of the liquid electrolyte was 6.9%, it decreased gradually over 10 days to 2.3%. On the other hand, even though the power conversion efficiency of the PVDF/IL/Dy NPs nanofibrous membrane was initially 6.4%, it could be maintained up to 6.1% over the same period of study. This low stability of the liquid electrolyte was due to the evaporation and leakage of the volatile liquid solvent.30 Such a setback was not seen in the nanofibrous membrane as the porous nanofibers in the cells hold the electrolyte solution without evaporation. From the normalised conversion efficiency graph, it is clear that the efficiency of the liquid electrolyte decreased drastically to 34%, whereas that of the PVDF/IL/Dy NPs nanofibrous membrane could be maintained at 93% over a period of 10 days.
4. Conclusion
Due to their high porosities and large surface area to volume ratios, electrospun nanofibers used as electrolytes in solar cells have shown great promise. The room temperature ionic liquid 3-decyl-1,2-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and dysprosium oxide nanoparticles were synthesized, characterized and incorporated into an electrospun PVDF nanofibrous membrane to form an electrolyte for DSSCs. The electrolyte's photovoltaic effects and electrochemical behaviour were investigated. The Voc, Jsc, FF and η values of a DSSC device using such an electrospun PVDF/IL/Dy NPs nanofibrous membrane electrolyte were found to be 0.81 V, 13.93 mA cm−2, 56% and 6.4% under AM1.5, respectively, compared to pristine PVDF nanofibers and nanofibers incorporated with either Dy NPs or the IL. This may be due to its high ionic conductivity, diffusion coefficient, porosity and electron uptake in the uniform electrospun interwoven structure. It showed lower R1CT, R2CT and Rs compared with the DSSCs fabricated with the other samples. This electrospun PVDF/Dy NPs/IL membrane electrolyte showed better stability without any leakage of the electrolyte and has potential for long term use.
