1 Introduction
Semiconductor photocatalysis as a green technology has attracted tremendous attention due to its great potential to solve environmental and energy problems, since the first research into photocatalytic water splitting on TiO2 electrodes was conducted in 1972.1–14 ZnO and TiO2 semiconductors have been proven to be promising photocatalysts for a wide range of environmental applications due to their intriguing optical and electric properties, low cost, and ease of availability.15–19 However, one of the major factors that limits their use is the mismatch between their band gap energy and the solar spectrum, which overlap only in the ultraviolet (UV) (λ < 400 nm) region. As a consequence, they can only utilize less than 5% of the solar energy impinging on the earth's surface, while visible light (∼48%) and near infrared (NIR) light (∼44%) cannot be effectively utilized.20 Therefore, the exploration of efficient visible and NIR light photocatalysts has been an urgent issue from the viewpoint of utilization.21–24
Currently, intensive investigations have been carried out to narrow the wide band gap of ZnO and TiO2 to respond to the visible light, including deposition with noble metals, doping with metal ions or non-metal elements and coupling with other narrow band gap semiconductors.25–42 However, they are inevitably confronted with several disadvantages, such as poor stability, relatively low visible light absorption and increased carrier-recombination centres.43–48 Another attractive strategy is to design novel visible light driven photocatalysts such as silver compounds (AgX (X = Cl, Br, I), Ag2O, Ag3PO4, Ag3VO4, AgNbO3, AgSbO3),43,49,50 bismuth compounds (BiOX (X = Cl, Br, I), Bi2MoO6, BiVO4, Bi2WO6),51–56 indium complex oxides (InMO4, M = V, Nb, Ta),57 ternary chalcogenide compounds (ABxCy, A = Cu, Ag, Zn, Cd; B = Al, Ga, In; C = S, Se, Te, x, y = integer),58 BaTaO2N,59 NaTaO3,60et al. Traditional visible light driven photocatalysts such as Bi2O3 (55%),61 BiVO4 (48%),62 Bi2WO6 (45%),63 CdS (79%),7 MoS2 (30%),64 CuO (40%),65 showed relatively low photocatalytic efficiency due to the difficult separation of electron–hole pairs, which can still not be effectively applied for the solar clean up of pollutants.66–69
Light-conversion phosphors (LCPs) including up-conversion phosphors (UCPs) and down-conversion phosphors (DCPs), which transform lower (higher) energy phonons into higher (lower) energy photons, have attracted tremendous interest in recent years owing to their special electronic structure and unique properties.70–73 Investigations have been carried out to study LCP-semiconductor composites for photocatalysis.72–78 The LCPs can absorb the given energy photon and emit other energy photons, which can be easily absorbed by a given dye or effectively excite the semiconductor to generate more electron–hole pairs. Besides the light-converting ability, long afterglow phosphors (LAPs) as one kind of LCP can emit long lasting phosphorescence, which contributes to persistent photocatalytic performance after turning off the irradiation light. Therefore, the incorporation of LCPs into semiconductors to form hybrid materials has proven to be a promising method to enhance the visible and NIR light photocatalysis, which could be a broad spectrum technology for environmental treatment.
In this work, recent progress in the exploration of various LCP/based composites for photocatalysis is highlighted. Compared with traditional visible light driven photocatalysts, LCP/semiconductors composites exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity. The mechanism of the improved photocatalytic activity under visible and NIR light irradiation is also discussed in detail. Although there are many reviews exploring UCP applications in photocatalysis,22 there is a distinct lack of reviews focusing specifically on DCPs and LAPs for photocatalysis.
2 Up-conversion phosphors
Extended utilization of sunlight from UV to visible or NIR light is an attractive issue in the field of photocatalysis.79 The UCP can serve as a frequency conversion element for semiconductors to harvest light in a broader spectral range. Recently, the incorporation of UCPs into semiconductors to form hybrid materials has been reported to improve the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors.75–78 The possible photocatalytic mechanism in the presence of UCP/semiconductor hybrid photocatalysts was supposed as follows. The UCP doped in the semiconductor can absorb NIR or visible light and then emit UV or visible light, as shown in Fig. 1, which can effectively excite the semiconductor to generate more electron–hole pairs and high active cavities, leading to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the pure semiconductor.76,80–82 In the photocatalytic process, the holes in the valence band not only directly decompose the organics adsorbed on the surface of the semiconductor, but also oxidize water molecules to form ˙OH radicals with high activity and indirectly degrade the organics in aqueous solution.83 In addition, the photo-generated electrons in the conduction band could be accepted by the dissolved oxygen in water, triggering a successive one-electron reduction of O2 to form O2˙−, HO2˙, H2O2, and OH˙. These radicals or reactive oxygen species are highly reactive with the organic pollutants, leading to the partial mineralization or complete mineralization of pollutants into CO2 and H2O. Besides the upconversion (UC) effect of the UCPs, the increased absorption, reduced electron–hole recombination, and enhanced oxygen vacancy signals are also beneficial to the photocatalytic activity of UCP/semiconductors hybrid materials compared to pure semiconductors.83–86 Therefore, the idea of UCP incorporation into the photocatalyst can be envisaged as an effective technology to treat wastewater using solar light irradiation.

2.1 Oxide phosphors
Oxide phosphors such as Y3Al5O12:Er3+, YAlO3:Er3+, YFeO3:Er3+, and Y2O3:Yb3+,Tm3+ have been investigated due to their wide application in photocatalysis.87 Attempts to combine semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnO, Bi2WO6, metal doped TiO2, and non-metal doped TiO2 with oxide phosphors have been made to form hybrid composites with superior photocatalytic activity.

2.1.1 Y3Al5O12:Er3+. 
Y3Al5O12:Er3+ can emit three UC fluorescent peaks in the range of 200–400 nm under excitation at 488 nm, which can satisfy the absorption range of TiO2, ZnO and Bi2WO6 photocatalysts.88 Hence, Y3Al5O12:Er3+-based composites can absorb efficiently the solar light in the photocatalytic process.
Pure Bi2WO6 presents the absorption from UV to visible light with wavelengths shorter than ca. 450 nm, as shown in Fig. 2, which occupies a small part of the solar spectrum.85 Therefore, Y3Al5O12:Er3+ can convert visible light into UV light to excite Bi2WO6 effectively, leading to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity.85 Moreover, Y3Al5O12:Er3+/Bi2WO6 photocatalysts show an increased absorption compared to pure Bi2WO6. The catalyst had a high photocatalytic activity with a higher maximum extent of degradation of 51% for the degradation of phenol (50 ml, 20 mg l−1) than that of pure Bi2WO6 (31.5%) at 120 min under simulated solar light irradiation (500 W Xe lamp) due to the UC effect of Y3Al5O12:Er3+.85

Wang et al.73,89 found that the photocatalytic activity of an Y3Al5O12:Er3+/anatase TiO2 composite (1 g l−1) prepared using a sol–gel, ultrasonic dispersion and liquid boiling method was improved for the degradation of congo red (50 ml, 20 mg l−1, rate constant of 0.4767 h−1) and acid red B (50 ml, 10 mg l−1, 89.95%) as compared with pure TiO2 (0.0869 h−1 for congo red; 66.58% for acid red) under sunlight and visible light irradiation using triphosphor lamps with a power of 144 W, correlated color temperature of 4000 K and intensity of 964347 lx. Similar experimental results were also reported in the literature.77 However, the photocatalytic activity is still low due to the quick recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs. In order to further improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, ZrO2 was introduced into the TiO2/Y3Al5O12:Er3+ composite by an ultrasonic dispersion and liquid boiling method.72 The Y3Al5O12:Er3+/anatase TiO2/ZrO2 composite (1 g l−1) had a high photocatalytic activity with a maximum extent of degradation of 90.39% at 60 min in the degradation of Azo Fuchsine (100 ml, 10 mg l−1) as compared with Y3Al5O12:Er3+/TiO2 (77.99%), TiO2 (27.86%) and Y3Al5O12:Er3+/ZrO2 (5.74%) under solar light irradiation. When a 7:3 Ti/Zr molar ratio, and conditions of 500 °C and 50 min heat-treatment were adopted, the Y3Al5O12:Er3+/TiO2 or ZrO2 composite revealed the most efficient photocatalytic activity.72
Recently, N and F co-doped Y3Al5O12:Er3+ was investigated in order to change the crystalline field to broaden the absorption range and enhance the emission spectra. The incorporation of N and F doped Y3Al5O12:Er3+ into TiO2 to form hybrid materials may enlarge the visible light absorption range, and thus enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Yin et al.90 successfully synthesized five types of photocatalysts, Y3Al5O12:Er3+/TiO2, YbnY3−nAl5O12:Er3+/TiO2, Y3Al5NxO12−x:Er3+/TiO2, Y3Al5FyO12−y:Er3+/TiO2 and YbnY3−nAl5NxFyO12−x−y:Er3+/TiO2 by a sol–gel method and investigated their photocatalytic activities in the degradation of acid red B dye (100 ml, 10 mg l−1) under solar light irradiation. The TiO2 in the composites shows a single anatase phase. The light irradiation intensity was (2.0–2.5) × 104 J m−2 min−1 during April in the city of Shenyang (EL: 123.38° and NL: 41.80°) in China, at a temperature range of 18–22 °C. It was suggested that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 could be enhanced largely by introducing the Yb, N and F doped Y3Al5O12:Er3+, and the Yb0.3Y2.7Al5N0.01F0.01O11.98:Er3+/TiO2 (1 g l−1) photocatalyst displayed the highest photocatalytic activity with an extent of degradation of 91.74% at 60 min (Table 1).

2.1.2 YAlO3:Er3+. 
YAlO3:Er3+ can emit in UV bands around 318.7 nm and 320.1 nm under excitation at 486.5 nm and 542.4 nm, respectively.91 The UC luminescence around 326–342 nm and 354–359 nm was also detected under the excitation of red light at around 652.2 nm (or 657.8 nm).92 Thus YAlO3:Er3+ can make full use of solar light and provide rich UV light to excite TiO2, ZnO or their composites, and thus enhance their photocatalytic activities.93–96 The YAlO3:Er3+ content, heat-treated temperature and heat treatment time for the preparation of YAlO3:Er3+/TiO2 or ZnO composites played key roles in the degradation of acid red B (100 ml, 10 mg l−1) under solar light irradiation (China, Shenyang area, E123°24′N41°50′, at a temperature of 19–25 °C from March to April at midmorning (9:30–10:30 a.m.)).97–99 Wang et al.98 synthesized the YAlO3:Er3+/ZnO composites by an ultrasonic dispersion and liquid boiling method and subsequent heat-treatment at 500 °C for 60 min, and found that the sample with 6.0 wt% YAlO3:Er3+ (1 g l−1) revealed higher photocatalytic activity (86%) than pure ZnO (69%) in the degradation of acid red B at 60 min under solar light irradiation.
Furthermore, a spherical activated carbon (SAC) supported TiO2 photocatalyst doped with YAlO3:Er3+ was prepared by an ultrasonic dispersion and sol–gel method and the photocatalytic activity was evaluated in the degradation of methyl orange (MO) (50 ml, 1 g l−1) under visible light irradiation from a 18 W LED lamp (λ > 400 nm) with two strong peaks at 455 nm and 552.9 nm.100 The SAC acted as a pollutant concentrating photocatalyst support. A maximum MO extent of degradation of 90.8% was obtained by using YAlO3:Er3+/anatase TiO2/SAC composites (20 g l−1) calcinated at 700 °C at 120 min.


2.1.3 YFeO3:Er3+. 
Similar to YAlO3:Er3+/TiO2/SAC, YFeO3:Er3+/TiO2/SAC should also be a good visible light photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants. The photocatalytic activity of YFeO3:Er3+/TiO2/SAC (20 mg l−1) composites synthesized by a modified sol–gel method with ultrasonic dispersion was evaluated by degradation of MO (50 ml, 500 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation using a 18 W LED lamp with two strong peaks at 455 nm and 552.9 nm.76 The XRD pattern of YFeO3:Er3+/TiO2 calcinated at 700 °C indicated the dominance of the anatase phase over the rutile phase. YFeO3:Er3+/TiO2/SAC was calcinated at 700 °C, and the TiO2 predominantly existed in the form of anatase along with a small fraction of rutile, and achieved a maximum extent of degradation of 92% at 80 min.76

2.2 Fluoride phosphors
In recent years, fluoride phosphors have attracted much attention owing to their potential application in white LEDs, optical and photovoltaic devices.101 Similar to oxide phosphors, fluoride phosphors such as YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+, NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+, and NaLuF4:Gd3+,Yb3+,Tm3+ were also reported to extend the absorption of photocatalysts up to the visible and even NIR light region, and thus enhance their photocatalytic activity.81

2.2.1 YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+. 
Under the excitation of a 980 nm laser, emission peaks at 347 nm, 362 nm, 452 nm, and 476 nm were observed for YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+, which were assigned to 1I6 → 3F4, 1D2 → 3H6, 1D2 → 3F4, and 1G4 → 3H6 transitions, respectively.102 Therefore, it is an appropriate candidate for NIR photocatalysis.
YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+/TiO2(P25)/graphene composites prepared via a one-step hydrothermal method exhibited great adsorptivity of dyes, significantly extended light absorption ranges, efficient charge separation properties and good stabilities due to the synergetic interactions among the components.102 The ternary composites (0.3 g l−1) could effectively degrade the MO dye (100 ml, 0.02 g l−1) under sunlight irradiation at 60 min with a higher degradation extent (78%) than the P25 (27%), YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+/P25 (46%) and P25/graphene (53%) photocatalysts. In the photocatalytic process, a 150 W high-pressure Xe lamp with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was used to provide a full-spectrum emission with an AM 1.5 filter to simulate the sunlight source. Furthermore, the extent of degradation of MO for P25 was 27%, which may be due to the presence of the rutile phase of TiO2 that can absorb some of the visible light up to 410 nm.
The core–shell structures are powerful platforms for the application in photocatalysis due to their excellent mechanical, optical, electrical and chemical properties.82,84,103–106 Qin et al.107 synthesized the novel YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+@anatase TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles by a modified hydrolysis method using polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 as the coupling agent for photocatalysis. The average thickness of TiO2 shells was about 10 nm, which is beneficial for the penetration of NIR light into the cores. The YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+@TiO2 nanoparticles were able to efficiently degrade the methyl blue (MB) (500 ml, 15 mg l−1) with a degradation extent of 58% at 9 h under the NIR light irradiation from sunlight (from 08:00 am–16:00 pm on 25–29 April 2009 in Changchun, China, with a cut off filter (λ < 700 nm)), which demonstrated that the NIR light could be used as the driving source for photocatalysis besides UV and visible energy.107
However, the shape of the YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles in the above work was irregular with a low quality, which might limit their photocatalytic activity. Development of uniform UCP-TiO2 core–shell structures with desirable morphology will be advantageous for their photocatalytic applications. Ye et al.108 prepared uniform YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals, which provided a good substrate to coat an anatase TiO2 layer. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals with diameters of 50 ± 20 nm at the ends and 25 ± 10 nm at the centres are hierarchically organized together, showing an assembly structure with peanut-like geometry. The porous TiO2 shells were coated on the YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanoparticles via a sol–gel process and crystallized through annealing, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). It was found that an obvious TiO2 shell with a thickness of 20 ± 10 nm is formed on surface of the YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ particles. The YF3:Yb3+, Tm3+@anatase TiO2 (1 g l−1) core–shell nanostructures not only possessed superior photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MO (20 ml, 50 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation (50 W Xe lamp) but also worked in the NIR light region, as the core YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanoparticles can efficiently up-convert NIR light into UV light.

2.2.2 NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+/Er3+. 
Rare earth doped NaYF4 has been widely studied in recent years. Quantum efficiencies in the range 0.005% to 3% were obtained for the green emission of several NaYF4: 20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ nanoparticles with different particle sizes and a bulk sample.109,110 Compared to YF3, rare earth doped NaYF4 is a more effective UCP, which can emit bright light, such as green, blue, etc., under NIR light excitation.111 The emitted bright fluorescence can be easily absorbed by semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnO and CdS to produce more electron–hole pairs, leading to the enhancement of their photocatalytic activity.112–116 Presently, one of the main problems for the new type of NIR-responsive photocatalysts is their low photocatalytic activity. How to improve the photocatalytic activity is a challenging issue.
Recently, researchers reported that the photocatalytic activity was obviously enhanced by using NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@TiO2 or ZnO core–shell nanocrystals compared to the pure TiO2 or ZnO.82,117,118 These core–shell composites exhibited three emission peaks at 291 nm, 345 nm, and 361 nm, corresponding to the 1I6 → 3H6, 1I6 → 3F4, and 1D2 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions, respectively, which overlap with the absorption range of TiO2 or ZnO.118,119 The core–shell structure may protect the UC core from surface quenching and increase the energy transfer efficiency. Therefore, these core–shell structures are effective photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants under NIR light irradiation.

Fig. 4 shows typical TEM images of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals and NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@TiO2 nanoparticles.80 The TiO2 shells are deposited around the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanoparticles with a diameter of about 25 nm. When hydrothermally annealed at 160 °C, the TiO2 shells are broken and lots of TiO2 nanocrystals are dispersed around the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanoparticles (Fig. 3(c)). TiO2 nanocrystals show a d-spacing of 0.351 nm, well-matched to the spacing of the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 (Fig. 3(d)).

Fig. 5 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+,NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@anatase TiO2 core–shell composite, and NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+–TiO2 physical mixture under 980 nm excitation.80 Compared to pure NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+, the emission peaks for the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@TiO2 core–shell composite and physical mixture at 347 nm and 362 nm decrease significantly, while the peaks at 452 and 474 nm remain almost unchanged. However, the emission peak for NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@anatase TiO2 core–shell at 291 nm nearly disappears. The different energy migration processes affect markedly the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.

MB compound as a model pollutant (0.5 ml, 15 mg l−1) was used to investigate the photocatalytic activity of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@anatase TiO2 composites (1 g l−1) under NIR irradiation using a diode laser of 980 nm with a power of 10 W cm−2.80 As shown in Fig. 6, the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@anatase TiO2 composite achieves an extent of degradation of 65% at 14 h, which is much higher than those of pure NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ (8%) and the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+–TiO2 physical mixture (30%).80 The energy transfer process between NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ and TiO2 is an important factor in the photocatalytic process.

Zhang et al.119 further prepared NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@anatase TiO2 core–shell composites with different shell thicknesses by varying the ratio of fluoride rods and Ti precursors via a facile hydrothermal method, and studied their photocatalytic activities. The extent of degradation for NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@anatase TiO2 (0.04 M TiF4, 10 g l−1) reached a maximum value of 90% for MB (1 ml, 5 mg l−1) at 12 h under NIR irradiation using a 1.5 W 980 nm diode laser.119 Similarly, the incorporation of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ into ZnO composites was also shown to greatly promote the photocatalytic activity in the degradation of RhB (0.5 ml, 20 mg l−1) with an extent of degradation of 65% at 30 h under NIR irradiation using a diode laser of 980 nm with a power density of 2.0 W cm−2, whereas NaYF4:Yb3+, NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ and ZnO aqueous suspensions showed very limited photocatalytic activity.118
Wang et al.120 successfully synthesized the double-shell-structured NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ or Er3+@SiO2@TiO2 photocatalysts by a simple hydrothermal method, and studied the influence of different UCPs in affecting NIR-driven photocatalysis. They consist of uniform NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ or Er3+ nanocrystals, SiO2 as the middle shell, and anatase TiO2 nanocrystals exposed with highly reactive facets as the outer shell, as shown in Fig. 7(a)–(c). The thickness of the SiO2 shell is about 30 nm (Fig. 7(g)). The outer TiO2 shell is composed of a large number of nanocrystals with diameters of about 20 nm (Fig. 7(h, i)). The photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts (1 g l−1) was evaluated by the degradation of RhB (10−5 M) under NIR irradiation (3 W mm−2), and the photocatalytic activity of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@SiO2@TiO2 was found to be higher (0.3624 h−1) than that of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+@SiO2@TiO2 (0.2912 h−1).

2.2.3 CaF2:Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+. 
Tm3+,Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped CaF2 nanoparticles with unique UC properties have been intensively studied.121 The UV (361 nm and 379 nm), violet (408 nm), and blue (485 nm) light from Tm3+,Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped CaF2 nanoparticles can be harvested by semiconductors for photocatalysis.83,84 Huang et al.83 prepared a novel CaF2:Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+/BiVO4 photocatalyst with a dendritic structure via a two-step hydrothermal method. The CaF2:Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+ particles with an average particle size of 140 nm were dispersed homogeneously on the dendritic surface of BiVO4. The absorption and emission intensities of the CaF2:Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+/BiVO4 composite were higher than those of pure CaF2:Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+ or BiVO4, through tailoring the crystal symmetry of lanthanide ions with Bi3+ ions. The rate of degradation of MO (10 ml, 10 mg l−1) for CaF2:Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+/BiVO4 (2 g l−1) was improved (0.113 × 10−1 h−1) under 980 nm NIR irradiation compared to the pure CaF2:Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+ or BiVO4.83 Furthermore, the same group also found that the CaF2, Tm3+,Yb3+@anatase TiO2 photocatalyst had a higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB (4.96 × 10−2 mg l−1 h−1) and MO (2.67 × 10−2 mg l−1 h−1) than pure TiO2, Yb3+,Er3+co-doped TiO2 and CaF2@TiO2 under NIR light irradiation.86
CaWO4 is a good oxide host material for lanthanide ions with a high UC efficiency. The formation of lanthanide ion doped CaWO4 or CaF2 can fulfil the requirements of high stability and excellent UC properties. Huang et al.84 synthesized a CaWO4,Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+@(anatase TiO2/CaF2) (ETY/CTC) photocatalyst via a hydrothermal method, and its photocatalytic activity (1 g l−1) was tested through the degradation of MO (20 mg l−1, 20 ml) under NIR light irradiation (λ ≧ 780 nm). ETY/CTC possessed a higher photocatalytic activity compared to Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+ tri-doped CaWO4@TiO2, owing to the enhanced UC properties, the increased electron–hole separation efficiency and oxygen vacancy signals.84


2.2.4 Other fluoride phosphors. 
Liu et al.122 investigated the influence of 10BaF2:NaF, Na3AlF6 doping on the visible light photocatalytic activity of TiO2 with anatase and rutile phase. 10BaF2:NaF,Na3AlF6 displays two emission peaks at 304 nm and 324 nm under excitation at 583 nm, and TiO2 exhibits a narrow absorption band from 200 nm to 400 nm. The absorption band of TiO2 overlaps very well with the UV emission of 10BaF2:NaF,Na3AlF6. In the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O (400 ml) under visible light irradiation by a 500 W spherical Xe lamp with an optical filter (λ > 515 nm), 10BaF2:NaF,Na3AlF6/TiO2 (5 g l−1) exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity (179 μmol gcat−1) under visible light irradiation.122
Silimar to 10BaF2:NaF,Na3AlF6, the 40CdF2·60BaF2·1.0Er2O3 could emit five UC fluorescent peaks under excitation at 488 nm, and supply the UV light for the TiO2 photocatalyst. By calculation, the UC efficiency of the emission peak at 380 nm was estimated to be about 0.78%. Wang et al.123–125 prepared the 40CdF2·60BaF2·1.0Er2O3/rutile TiO2 photocatalyst by ultrasonic and boiling dispersion at 80 kHz frequency with 50 W output power for 15 min and studied its photocatalytic activity through the degradation of azo fuchsine, ethyl violet and acid red B (10 mg l−1) solution under visible light irradiation using triphosphor lamps with a color temperature of 4000 K and light intensity of 964347 lx. 40CdF2·60BaF2·1.0Er2O3/rutile TiO2 powder (1 g l−1) showed a higher photocatalytic activity in the degradation of azo fuchsine (95%), ethyl violet (87%), and acid red B (100%) than undoped TiO2.

3 Down-conversion phosphors
Research has indicated that the photocatalytic degradation of dyes in a wide band gap semiconductor suspension under visible light irradiation is a typical self-sensitized degradation process.126–132 In the photocatalytic process, the dye is excited under visible light irradiation to dye*. The photo-induced electrons are transferred from the dye* to semiconductors and then react with adsorbed oxidants, usually O2, to produce reactive oxygen radicals (˙O2−).4,132–134 However, the photocatalytic degradation rate and mineralization degree of dyes are limited because of the slow interfacial electron transfer.52 The DCP has attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their intrinsic and unique conversion properties.70,72,73,135–137 Recently, many studies indicated that the incorporation of the DCP into photocatalyst to form hybrid materials can enhance the visible light photocatalytic activity of the wide band gap semiconductor by utilizing the light down-converting characteristics of the phosphors to facilitate the self-degradation of MB. The possible photocatalytic mechanism in the presence of DCP/semiconductor hybrid photocatalysts is supposed as follows. The DCP can absorb the high energy photon and emit the low energy photon at a longer wavelength, which can be easily absorbed by a given dye and thus effectively excite the dye to generate more electron–hole pairs, resulting in an improvement of the self-sensitized degradation of the dye.74,126,138 Moreover, the increase of dye adsorption and visible light absorption as well as the reduction of electron–hole pair recombination in wide band gap semiconductor may also be responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance.74,126,138 Therefore, the incorporation of the DCP into photocatalysts to form hybrid materials could be a promising method to enhance the visible light photocatalysis.
3.1 Oxide phosphors
The light converting ability of oxide phosphors is promising to fulfil the simple and effective removal of dyes by adjusting the light emission of the oxide phosphors to improve the self-sensitized degradation of dyes. Therefore, exploration of oxide phosphor-semiconductor composites and studies into the effect of their down-converting (DC) properties on the self-sensitized degradation of different dyes is necessary for better understanding of this technique and the mechanism behind it.

3.1.1 Y3Al5O12:Ce3+. 
Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ shows two absorption peaks at 340 nm and 455 nm, which are assigned to the characteristic 4f1 → 5d1 transition of Ce3+ ions. A broad emission spectrum with a peak at 525 nm for Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ under an excitation of 455 nm falls in the absorption range of the dye MB (<663 nm), which indicates that Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ can be used as an effective DCP to improve the self-sensitized degradation of the dye MB.
Jiang et al.139 indicated that Y3Al5O12:Ce3+/anatase TiO2 compound films exhibited a superior photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MB (50 ml, 12 mg l−1) under UV light irradiation using a 160 W high pressure mercury lamp than the pure TiO2 film due to its larger specific surface area, stronger absorption and higher photo-generated current density with the introduction of Y3Al5O12:Ce3+. Unfortunately, the DC properties of Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ have not been utilized in the above work.
Pan et al.138 reported that the introduction of Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ by utilizing the DC characteristics can facilitate the self-sensitized degradation of MB, and thus enhance the photocatalytic activity of ZnO. ZnO/Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ composites were successfully synthesized via microwave-assisted reaction of the ZnO precursor with a Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ suspension using a microwave synthesis system. As shown in Fig. 8, ZnO displays the sheet nanostructure and the Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ particles are monodisperse with diameters in the range of 200–300 nm. The photocatalytic activity of the ZnO/Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ composites (2 g l−1) with 3 wt% of Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ in the degradation of MB (5 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation (400 W metal halogen lamp with wavelength: 390–800 nm) was found to be much improved (93%) compared with pure ZnO (13%) mainly due to the DC effect of Y3Al5O12:Ce3+, which facilitated the self-sensitized destruction of MB.138

3.1.2 Y2O2S:Eu3+. 
Further study showed that the light converting phenomenon was also found for ZnO/Y2O2S:Eu3+ composites (2 g l−1) synthesized by a microwave-assisted method for photocatalytic degradation of MB, RhB and MO (80 ml, 5 mg l−1).126 Y2O2S:Eu3+ particles are monodisperse with diameters in the range of 3–5 μm, as shown in Fig. 9(a). Y2O2S:Eu3+ is surrounded by ZnO particles in the composite, as shown in the Fig. 9(b). The photocatalytic experimental results showed that Y2O2S:Eu3+ phosphors played an important role in the enhancement of visible light photocatalysis. ZnO/Y2O2S:Eu3+ composites with 0.5 wt% Y2O2S:Eu3+ exhibited the highest visible light photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MB (95%).

3.1.3 NaSrBO3:Tb3+. 
Pan et al.74 further studied the ZnO/NaSrBO3:Tb3+ composite synthesized via a microwave-assisted method for visible light photocatalytic degradation of MB, RhB, MO and reduction of Cr(VI) (80 ml, 5 mg l−1). NaSrBO3:Tb3+ has a diameter in the range of 0.5–1 μm, as shown in Fig. 9(c). As shown in Fig. 10, the emission band of NaSrBO3:Tb3+ phosphors (about 540–700 nm) matches the absorption range of MB (about 550–700 nm) and RhB (500–600 nm), but it cannot be absorbed by MO (about 400–530 nm) and Cr(VI). Therefore, the low energy photons emitted by NaSrBO3:Tb3+ can be easily absorbed by the MB and RhB, and thus generate more electron–hole pairs, leading to the obvious improvement of the self-sensitized destruction of MB and RhB. However, it is not obviously enhanced in the degradation of MO or does not happen in the reduction of Cr(VI). The photocatalytic experimental results indicated that the maximum extent of MB and RhB degradation for the ZnO/NaSrBO3:Tb3+ composite with 1 wt% NaSrBO3:Tb3+ reached 97% and 94%, respectively, while the extent of degradation of MO and reduction of Cr(VI) were only 38% and 37%, respectively. The large difference in the photocatalytic process indicates the contribution of the light DC effect of NaSrBO3:Tb3+ to the photocatalytic performance by enhancing the self-sensitized degradation. Besides the self-sensitized degradation of dyes, the improvement of photocatalytic performance should also be ascribed to the increase of visible light absorption and the reduction of electron–hole pair recombination in ZnO with the incorporation of NaSrBO3:Tb3+ (Fig. 11).

Besides the above mentioned oxide phosphors-based composites, Gd2O2S:Tb3+ and Sr2CeO4/TiO2 composites also exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic activity over pure TiO2 (P25) for the degradation of gaseous benzene, MB (1 × 10−5 mol l−1), and formaldehyde diluted in water (0.1 mol l−1) under UV light irradiation (10 W, UV-A, 9 W m−2), which was ascribed to the synergy of electron transfer and the stronger absorption in the region 400–850 nm.140,141

3.2 Other oxide phosphors
Recently, many oxide phosphors such as SrWO4:Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+) and Zn3V2O8 have been reported for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes under visible light irradiation.142

3.2.1 SrWO4:Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+). 
Zheng et al.142 successfully prepared SrWO4:Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+) phosphors by microwave treatment at very low temperature (70 °C) for only 45 min. Upon excitation at 248 nm, green emission peaks at 490, 545, 583 and 622 nm for SrWO4:Ln3+ could be observed, which were transitions from the 5D4 excited state to the different J levels of the ground state 7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3). The photocatalytic activity of SrWO4:Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+) was examined by the degradation of different dyes (MB, MO and RhB) under mercury lamp irradiation (a 500 W mercury lamp with a maximum emission at 365 nm). An obvious reduction in the absorption peaks for all three dyes was observed in the presence of SrWO4:Tb3+, SrWO4:Dy3+ and SrWO4:Sm3+ after UV light illumination at 70 min. In addition, MB decomposed dramatically during the irradiation period using SrWO4:Eu3+ phosphors, but MO and RhB were hardly degraded, which is because the emission of SrWO4:Eu3+ located in the red region (600–700 nm) only overlaps with the absorption of MB.142


3.2.2 Zn3V2O8. 
Recently, vanadate has attracted much attention because of its rich structural chemistry and wide applications in photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices. Zn3V2O8 as a typical vanadate has an interesting crystal structure comprising a porous framework. Zn3V2O8, with broadband yellowish white emissions, was synthesized via a combustion route, by hydrothermal, sol–gel, and solid state reaction methods.143 Zn3V2O8 prepared by the combustion method showed spherical particles with dimensions of between 1 and 3 μm. The hydrothermally treated Zn3V2O8 at 150 °C for 24 h and sintered at 775 °C for 12 h showed thin plate like particles with an average size of 3–5 μm, which connected with each other and formed a flower like structure. Zn3V2O8 prepared by a sol–gel method displayed cylindrical particles with dimensions of 10–12 μm in length and 2–3 μm in diameter. The much bigger and rougher microstructure of Zn3V2O8 was formed by the solid state reaction method. The photocatalytic activity of Zn3V2O8 phosphors (250 mg l−1) was investigated by the degradation of MB (400 ml, 10 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation using a 60 W halogen–tungsten lamp. It was found that the MB degradation rate for Zn3V2O8 synthesized via the hydrothermal method was higher than that synthesized via the other methods, which might be ascribed to its large surface area.143

4 Long afterglow phosphors
Alkaline-earth aluminate phosphors have attracted considerable attention for their potential applications in the fields such as luminous paints, safety indicators and plasma display phosphors. Recently, many reports confirmed that by coupling semiconductors with LAPs such as blue CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+, green SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ and BaAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+, the photocatalytic activity can be maintained even after turning off the light for a long time. This is because the LAP stores light from the light source and emits it slowly, which excites the semiconductor to generate more electron–hole pairs when the irradiation source is turned off.144 Such a self-fluorescence-assisted system could enhance the photocatalytic activity for environmental clean-up.145 It is a new concept for photocatalyst synthesis and application.
4.1 Aluminate phosphors

4.1.1 CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+. 
CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+ is an excellent LAP due to its good chemical stability, low toxicity, and long afterglow time.103 The photocatalytic activity of CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+-based composites has been reported for the degradation of dye pollutants.
Yoon et al.146,147 prepared CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+/anatase TiO2, and CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+/anatase TiO2/Al2O3 composites using a sol–gel processing and atomic layer deposition method and their photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the degradation of MB (1.6 × 10−5 mol ml−1, 100 ml) in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation using a 100 W white light lamp with a cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm). The composites showed much higher photocatalytic activities than pure TiO2, which might be because the combination of TiO2 with phosphors induced energy band bending at the junction, shifted the absorption band of the TiO2 toward the visible light region, and thus increased the electron–hole pairs. However, no noticeable degradation was observed after turning off the light.
TiO2−xNy showed visible light absorption up to 700 nm, which had a perfect overlap with the emission spectrum of CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+, as shown in Fig. 12.148 Therefore, the CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+-based hybrid materials could use the long afterglow from the phosphor as the light source in the photocatalytic reaction process. Li et al.149–152 prepared CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+/brookite TiO2−xNy composites in a sequence of procedures, which involved reactions of a TiCl3 and hexamethylenetetramine mixed solution at 190 °C for 2 h to obtain the brookite TiO2−xNy, followed by mixing with CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+ particles by soft planetary ball milling. CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+/brookite TiO2−xNy showed higher persistent NO destruction ability in the dark after turning off the light compared to pure TiO2−xNy.151 Upon an increase in the TiO2−xNy content to 40 wt%, the photocatalytic activity increased. However with a further increase in the TiO2−xNy content, the photocatalytic activity slightly decreased, which might be due to the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+.149,152
 Fig. 12  Overlap of the diffuse reflectance spectra and emission spectra of uncoupled CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+ and CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+/TiO2−xNy composite. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 148.) 
Li et al.153,154 synthesized SrTi1−xCryO3 nanoparticles with diameters of 25–40 nm and coupled them with CaAl2O4:Eu2+, Nd3+ though a simple precipitation method. The CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+–SrTi1−xCryO3 composites exhibited prolonged photocatalytic activity for the oxidative destruction of NO in a continuous gas flow system even after turning off the light at 180 min. The photocatalytic activity was dependent on the proportion of SrTi1−xCryO3 in the composites and the optimal content was around 50 wt%.153 Similarly, the CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+/SrTiO3/Fe2O3 composites synthesized using the microwave-assisted solvothermal method could also efficiently degrade the NO gas, not only under UV light irradiation using a 450 W high pressure mercury lamp, but also in the dark with fluorescence assistance of CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+.155


4.1.2 Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+,Nd3+. 
After being combined with TiO2, Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+,Nd3+ can absorb and store light, which will supply light for the TiO2 to remain photocatalytically active in the darkness.156 Recently, Ag3PO4 was reported to show absorption up to 600 nm, which might be activated by phosphorescence with a wavelength of 490 nm emitted from Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+,Nd3+. Therefore, the introduction of Ag3PO4 into Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+,Nd3+ to form a hybrid also could harvest persistent phosphorescence to degrade the pollutant after turning off the lamp irradiation.157 Li et al.157 prepared Ag3PO4/Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+,Nd3+ composites by a simple precipitation process, followed by mixing with a desired amount of Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+,Nd3+. The composite with 50 wt% Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+,Nd3+ showed the highest photocatalytic activity with an extent of degradation of 100% in the dark at 10.5 h.157

4.2 Zirconate phosphors
Intense violet blue long-lasting phosphorescence covering a wavelength range of 320–550 nm was observed from BaZrO3:Mg2+, which partially overlaps the absorption of the TiO2.158 Therefore, the BaZrO3:Mg2+ may assist the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 with mixed phase of anatase and rutile at night. Ma et al.158 synthesized BaZrO3:Mg2+/TiO2 composites with a perovskite structure via a solid-state reaction and sol–gel method. The photocatalytic activity of the BaZrO3:Mg2+/TiO2 composite (75 mg) was evaluated through the decomposition of MB (75 ml, 10 mg l−1). Results revealed that the BaZrO3:Mg2+ supported the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under UV light irradiation (~90%) or in darkness after UV irradiation (10%).158
5 Summary and outlook
Semiconductor photocatalysis has become more prominent owing to the advantages of being able to use a vast range of additive chemicals or disinfectants and its mineralization aspects. The major challenges in photocatalysis are the limited light absorption in the incident solar spectrum and quick recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. Increasing the energy harvesting efficiency for continued solar energy utilization under ambient conditions will continue to be one of the most important objectives in designing photocatalysts. In this review, our aim is to reveal the advances in using LCP materials as spectral converters for enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The LCP/semiconductor composites display excellent photocatalytic activity compared to the traditional visible light driven photocatalysts. The incorporation of the LCPs as spectral converters, including UCPs, DCPs and LAPs, into semiconductors to form hybrid photocatalysts has proved to a promising method to enhance the solar energy harvesting ability and visible light photocatalytic activity. The UCP doped in the semiconductor can absorb NIR or visible light and then emit UV or visible light, which can effectively excite the semiconductor to generate more electron–hole pairs and high active cavities, leading to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of pure semiconductor due to the UC effect.76,80–82 The introduction of DCPs in wide band semiconductors by utilizing the light DC characteristics can result in the absorption of high energy photons and emit low energy photons at longer wavelengths, which can effectively excite the dye to generate more electron–hole pairs, and facilitate the self-sensitized degradation of MB, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity of wide band semiconductors. Such light-converting ability of phosphors is promising to fulfil the simple and effective removal of dyes by adjusting the light emission of the phosphors to improve the self-sensitized degradation of dyes. Moreover, the increase of dye adsorption and visible light absorption as well as the reduction of electron–hole pair recombination may also be responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of LCP/semiconductor hybrid materials compared to pure semiconductors. A semiconductor coupled with an appropriate amount of LAP could continuously degrade organic contaminants even after turning off the irradiation lamp, owing to the long afterglow characteristics. However, from the point of view of industrialization and commercialization, many challenges remain in the areas of photocatalysis. The major drawback associated with the low quantum efficiency of LCP materials limits the practical application in photocatalysis. Investigations have been made to improve the quantum efficiency by using plasmonic resonance, photonic crystals, impurity doping, quantum dot sensitizers, and core–shell structures.159 Furthermore, a high power laser is required for some UCPs to obtain the up-conversion characteristics, which decreases the photocatalytic activity and limits the practical application of the solar light photocatalysts. In addition, it is well known fact that energy transfer from the semiconductor to lanthanide ions is common. Therefore, there is a very high possibility of energy transfer back to lanthanide ions, even after absorbing the UC emission from lanthanide ions, which is not beneficial to the photocatalytic activity of LCP/semiconductor composites. Despite the encouraging progress to date, the application of LCP materials as spectral converters for photocatalysis is still at the primary stage. A greater knowledge of the photocatalytic mechanism and exploration of high quantum efficiency LCP/semiconductor composites will be indispensable to make substantial breakthroughs for practical applications.
