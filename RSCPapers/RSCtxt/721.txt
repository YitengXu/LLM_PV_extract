    , Accepted 20th September 2021First published on 22nd September 2021AbstractNon-fullerene acceptors have received a great deal of attention over the past several years, and numerous modifications on the molecular structures significantly boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). To be a match, a promising polymer donor is urgently needed. Herein, we report a wide bandgap donor with alternating fluorinated benzotriazole (FTAZ) and triisopropylsilylethynyl-phenyl substituted benzodithiophene. Strategically, the lateral benzene and acetylene motifs induce a down-shift of the HOMO energy level, and the alkylsilyl facilitates inter-chain interactions and modulates the solubility. The new polymer exhibits a strong solution pre-aggregation ability that influences the intermixed morphology and optimizing methods of OSCs. When blended with the easily accessible acceptor IDIC, a respective PCE of 7.81% with a Voc of 0.928 V has been demonstrated. We investigated the impact of molecular weights on the optical and electrochemical properties, charge transport, blend morphology, and photovoltaic parameters, and the result indicates that a high Mn is desired for improving the quality of the solution-processed films. The acquired results reveal that trialkylsilylethynyl-phenyl is a promising multi-functional side chain scaffold for developing promising conjugated molecules.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a blend of polymer donor and a small molecule acceptor have been attracting more and more attention from both academic and industrial communities because of their advantages such as low cost, light weight, easy fabrication, semi-transparency, and compatibility with large-scale and flexible applications.1–3 For a long period of more than two decades, the fullerene derivatives PC60BM and PC70BM have been ubiquitously used as acceptors due to their merits of high and isotropic transport of electrons.4–6 Accordingly, numerous efforts have been dedicated to innovating polymer donors, and categories varied from P3HT to PCDTBT and then to PTB7-Th as well as PffBT4T-2OD with a descending trend of the optical bandgap.7–10 However, with the intrinsic drawbacks of weak optical absorption and limited molecular energy level tunability, the fullerene acceptors can only contribute to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of no more than 12% for OSC devices.11 Encouragingly, Zhan et al. made a breakthrough in 2015 with the invention of the A–D–A structured small molecule non-fullerene acceptor (SM-NFA) ITIC.12 Thereafter, numerous A–D–A-type SM-NFAs were innovated.13,14 Particularly, Zheng et al. recently developed a series of N,S-bridged heteroheptacene-centered SM-NFAs (i.e., M series),15,16 and obtained a record PCE of 16.7%.17 Furthermore, the Zou and Yang groups developed the small molecule acceptors (SMAs) of the Y series with a geometry of A–DA′D–A that could enable a PCE of over 18% in OSCs.18–20 Impressed by the breakthrough results based on Y6, a number of studies have been carried out for the development of low bandgap SM-NFAs.2
To be a match in terms of complementary absorption, efficient wide bandgap polymer donors are essential. Given the fact that the focus of materials innovations in the fullerene-acceptor era is developing low bandgap polymer donors,21,22 and the derived wide bandgap polymer donors in this period may not be suitable for application in combination with low bandgap SM-NFAs, it is of vital importance to explore new wide bandgap donors for studying the material properties and device performance.23–25 Besides, the synthetic cost of the donor and acceptor components must be taken into account to benefit the commercialization of OSCs. In this regard, the easily accessible SM-NFA is preferable.
Two-dimensional benzodithiophene (BDT) represents the state-of-the-art electron-rich building block for constructing donor–acceptor (D–A) type polymers. Benzene and thiophene rings are the widely used conjugation moieties to be connected with soluble alkyl side chains. In comparison, phenyl side chains are able to down-shift the HOMO energy levels of molecules owing to their higher aromaticity. Consequently, higher open-circuit voltages (Vocs) were acquired in relevant OSC devices.26,27 Nevertheless, thienyl side chains can promote molecular stacking via intermolecular O⋯S and S⋯F non-covalent bonds and intra-molecular non-covalent conformational locks.28 Thus, additional functional groups should be attached onto the phenyl rings to achieve the desired comprehensive device performance. One successful approach is introducing F atoms. Huang and co-workers used difluorophenyl substituted BDT-containing polymers to simultaneously enhance the Voc and short-circuit current density (Jsc), and therefore PCEs of 13% and 16% were obtained based on the acceptors of IT-4F and Y6, respectively.29,30 Zhou et al. investigated the impact of the number of F substituents sited on the phenyl side unit, and demonstrated a gradual decrease of energy levels and an increase of crystallinity in the films on increasing the fluorination. Meanwhile, the PCEs of the OSCs with Y6 as the acceptor progressively went up.31 However, it is worth noting that the fluorination of molecular chains may induce solubility issues.32 Then it is easy to understand that the high-efficiency polymer donor PM6 was usually purchased from commercial sources according to works in literatures, because it is challenging to find an appropriate compromise between the high molecular weight and good solution processing ability. Trialkylsilylethynyl is a unique functional group that integrates the conjugation and electron-deficient nature of unsaturated triple bonds, the large atom size of silicon, and solubilizing alkyl.33 Such a functional side unit has been used to construct some conjugated molecules for OSCs and organic thin film transistors (OTFTs).34,35 But to the best of our knowledge, it has been rarely applied to aromatic side units despite bearing promising potential properties.
In our recent studies, we utilized triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS) substituted thiophene as a 2D-conjugated side chain and investigated the steric hindrance effect of TIPS via the construction of a head-to-head bithiophene building block.36,37 It is found that the incorporation of compact TIPS down-shifts the HOMO energy level and promotes inter-chain interactions to strengthen the molecular aggregation.37 Herein, we design and synthesize a TIPS-substituted phenyl side chain to construct a new 2D-BDT building block. By alternating with fluorinated benzotriazole (FTAZ), medium-bandgap polymers (PBDTPSi-FTAZ, denoted as PW30) were generated. Temperature-dependent optical profiles indicate the strong pre-aggregation of the polymer chains. In view of this, some reports reveal that aggregated polymers induce a hierarchical morphology and yield high PCEs when blended with SM-NFAs.38 In addition, molecular aggregation favors inter-chain π–π packing and charge transport, but may diminish the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the device when measured as a light-emitting diode, and thus lead to a large non-radiative energy recombination loss.39 Therefore, the aggregation properties of the polymer should be alternated, wherein the modulation of molecular weight (Mw) is a straightforward solution. We found that the Mw of PW30 has a profound effect on the polymer pre-aggregation, charge mobility and phase-separated blend morphology. By taking advantage of the PW30 with a higher Mw, a PCE of 7.81% can be achieved when blended with the simply structured, low-cost A–D–A fused-ring acceptor IDIC.40,41 Such results are meaningful in understanding the properties of the newly synthesized polymer and guiding molecular designs toward highly conjugated and pre-aggregated polymers with decent charge transport ability and high performance.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The synthetic route to the monomer and the polymer is depicted in Scheme 1. Selective Sonogashira coupling reactions between 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene and triisopropylsilylacetylene afforded compound 1. Then it was lithiated at low temperature to generate carbanion for imposing nucleophilic addition reaction onto the dione reactant. The resulting diol intermediate was subjected to in-situ elimination of hydroxyl and annulations under acid mediated conditions. The overall yield from compound 1 to 2 is 65%. The compound 2 was deprotonated for attaching trimethylstannyl to form the monomer M. Stille polymer condensation between M and 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyl-decyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (FTAZ) with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and toluene as a solvent leads to the target polymer PW30. The polymer weight can be controlled via the reaction time to enable the polymer to be soluble in common processing solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. In this manner, two batches of the polymer with higher number-average molecular weights (Mns) of 25.6 kg mol−1 and 8.3 kg mol−1 were produced to induce polymer solubility in warm and room-temperature chloroform solution, respectively. The Mns were determined by gel permeation chromatography with hot trichlorobenzene and chloroform as eluents, respectively, based on polystyrene standards. The two polymers exhibit good thermal stability as evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†) with a 5% weight loss temperature of more than 300 °C. X-ray diffraction patterns of the polymer films indicate an amorphous microstructure (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Optical and molecular energy properties
The optical properties of the blend components were investigated using UV-visible absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. 1a, the polymers in solution show a broad absorption band across 400–650 nm. Apart from the maximum absorption peak located at 533 nm, a pronounced shoulder peak at 575 nm that is attributed to inter-chain π–π stacking can be observed.42 On comparing between the two polymers with high and low Mns, the polymer with a higher Mn exhibits more intense shoulder absorption, and this indicates the stronger molecular interactions among PW30H chains in solution.43 As for the films, the positions of absorption bands change little relative to those in solution. This phenomenon in conjugation with the distinctive shoulder peaks in the solution state implies strong pre-aggregation of the polymer chains even in solution.44 The absorbance of PW30 complements that of IDIC well so as to capture more photons. To figure out the impact of molecular weight on the molecular aggregation and serve as a cause to affect the charge transport and blend morphology, we recorded the temperature-dependent UV-vis spectra of the polymers PW30H and PW30L (Fig. 1c and d). As the solution temperature is increased, the absorbance at the maximum absorption gradually decreases, and the shoulder peaks diminish until disappearance. These are the results of de-aggregation of the polymer chains in solution at elevated temperatures.37 However, in comparison, different profiles exist among PW30H and PW30L. The absorbance of PW30H slightly decreases when the solution is heated from 30 to 60 °C, but obviously decreases between 60 and 100 °C. In contrast, the absorbance of PW30L quickly weakens across the low temperature range below 70 °C, but insignificantly diminishes around much higher temperatures till 100 °C. Such variations well support that the polymer chains of PW30H have much stronger pre-aggregation ability and its de-aggregation needs higher temperatures. This is meaningful in terms of blend solution preparation. To make the polymer fully soluble and create fine blend microstructures, the blend solution of PW30H should be appropriately heated. The optical bandgaps of the polymers were determined to be 1.97 eV for PW30L and 1.94 eV for PW30H, according to the onset of the absorption spectra in the long wavelength region.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was used to evaluate the molecular energy levels. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels can be calculated based on the onset oxidation/reduction potentials (φox/φred) in the cyclic voltammograms according to the equation: EHOMO/ELUMO = −(φox/φred + 4.8 − φFc/Fc+) (eV) where φFc/Fc+ is the redox potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple under the same measurement. As shown in Fig. 2, the φFc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.1 V versus the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode, and the onset oxidation potential of PW30H and PW30L was determined to be 0.75 V, so the HOMO energy level of the polymer PW30 can be calculated as −5.45 eV. Similarly, the HOMO level of IDIC is determined to be −5.68 eV. The molecular weight has some impact on the onset reduction potentials. The φred of PW30H and PW30L was measured to be −1.15 V and −1.19 V, respectively, and then the LUMO levels were calculated to be −3.55 eV for PW30H and −3.51 eV for PW30L. The slight decline of the LUMO level caused by a higher molecular weight can be attributed to the strengthened conjugation delocalization effect within the polymer chain, which leads to a narrower optical bandgap (1.94 vs. 1.97 eV) being consistent with the somewhat reduced bandgap from CV (1.9 vs. 1.94 eV). Similarly, the LUMO level of IDIC was calculated to be −3.95 eV. The smaller energy offset between the HOMOs of the donor and acceptor is beneficial to minimizing the voltage energy loss.

Photovoltaic properties
The polymers PW30H and PW30L were used in OSCs with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al. The fabrication procedures are described in the Experimental section. The J–V curves of the optimal OSCs are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. To optimize the performance of OSCs, the ratios of D/A were screened (Table 1), and the annealing temperature was investigated (Table S1, ESI†). It is found that the optimal D/A ratio is 1:1.2, and the appropriate annealing temperature is 110 °C. The OSCs with a higher Mn (PW30H) exhibit a PCE of 7.07% in comparison with a lower PCE of 5.00% for PW30L. When the cathode electrode and interlayer were modified as PDIN/BCP/Ag,36,37,45 the PCE of PW30H based devices can be improved to 7.81% with a Voc of 0.928 V, a Jsc of 15.82 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53.2%. Although such an optimal PCE is superior to that in the literature acquired based on IDIC and a polymer incorporating thienyl-substituted BDT and FTAZ units,41 it is still far lower than the state-of-the-art performance that arises from IDIC acceptors.46 In view of the decent Voc that benefits from the down-shifting effect imposed on the HOMO level of the polymer donor by the TIPS-phenyl, the drawbacks of Jsc and FF must be the cause of the suboptimal PCE. In some papers, it is claimed that photon-induced excitons first dissociate to form a charge transfer (CT) state before charge generation, and the singlet exciton state (S1) can efficiently hybridize with the CT state given a low energy difference between the S1 and CT state.39 This helps in interpreting that more and more examples support the fact that it is not necessary to maintain a large energy offset as the driving force for exciton dissociation in a non-fullerene system.2,47 Here the large LUMO offset tends to cause a big charge generation energy loss. Of course, the charge transport properties and morphology-related recombination loss are also key aspects that account for Jsc and FF (vide infra).

To assess the spectral response of the OSCs and verify the accuracy of the Jsc measurements, we examined the external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of the OSCs. As shown in Fig. 3b, the EQE spectra range from 350 to 800 nm, indicating that absorbed photons can be converted to current all over the absorption region. The OSC with PW30H exhibits higher values than the counterpart with PW30L, which is consistent with the measured Jsc trend. It is found that the EQE peak is located around 533 nm that is the location of the maximum absorbance of the polymer donor. And the high EQEs beyond 60% are distributed over 500–700 nm rather than the intense optical absorption band beyond 700 nm in terms of IDIC. These profiles indicate less efficient photon-to-current conversion efficiency for the photons generated from the acceptor. The integrated Jsc (15.12 mA cm−2) obtained from the EQE by referencing the AM 1.5G solar spectrum agrees well with the measured Jsc with errors less than 5%.
Charge generation, transport and blend morphology
To understand the exciton dissociation and charge generation properties, we measured and depicted the Jph–Veff plots, where Jph = JL − JD (JL and JD represent the photocurrent densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively), and Veff is defined as Veff = Vo − Va (Vo is the voltage where Jph equals zero, and Va is the applied voltage). As shown in Fig. 4, with an increase in Veff, the photocurrent of the PW30H based device gets close to saturation earlier, and the Jph of the PW30H based device is higher than that of the PW30L based device over the scan range. These indicate that the charge generation and collection in the PW30H based device is more efficient. To confirm this, the exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) was determined using Jph/Jsat under the Jsc condition.36 The P(E,T) was 72.6% and 70.8% for PW30H and PW30L based OSCs, respectively. Such inefficient exciton dissociation partially accounts for the mediocre Jscs of the OSCs. To further probe the reasons for the differences in performance between PW30H and PW30L based devices, we fabricated a hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag, and calculated the hole mobility of the blend according to the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model. Based on the slope of J0.5–V plots (Fig. 4b), the hole mobility is determined to be (7.2 ± 0.5) and (1.6 ± 0.3) × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PW30H:IDIC and PW30L:IDIC, respectively. The higher hole mobility of PW30H:IDIC supports the higher Jsc and FF in OSC devices.

To obtain more insights into the photovoltaic parameters and charge transport ability, we investigated the film morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5, the PW30L:IDIC blend (Fig. 5a) exhibits unclear domain-separated nanostructures as compared to that based on PW30H:IDIC (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the domain size of the PW30H:IDIC blend is somewhat larger than that of PW30L:IDIC. The domain sizes of the polymers are smaller than the typical exciton diffusion length (10–15 nm),48 so appropriately a larger domain size is beneficial to reduce bimolecular recombination of charges. The well-defined nanostructures of PW30H:IDIC with a decent domain size account for its superior hole mobility and exciton dissociation, and thus directly for the higher PCE. The distinctive morphological features of PW30H:IDIC must correlate with the strong pre-aggregation tendency of PW30H that can mediate the film-forming process. Because the optimal PCE for PW30H:IDIC was obtained after thermal annealing, we examined the influence of annealing on the blend morphology. As seen from Fig. 5c, the film of PW30H:IDIC without annealing displays a relatively dim domain boundary compared to the annealed film of PW30H:IDIC in Fig. 5b. So it is straightforward to understand why the annealed blend delivered better photovoltaic properties.

Conclusions
In summary, we proposed the protocol of attaching trialkylsilylethynyl as a functional group onto the 2D-conjugated side chain of a BDT-based polymer, and herein we developed a triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS)-phenyl substituted BDT building block. By copolymerizing with FTAZ, a p-type polymer with an optical bandgap of 1.94 eV was achieved. This polymer has distinct pre-aggregation characteristics as evidenced from temperature-dependent absorption spectra. The newly designed side chain can help down-shift the HOMO energy level to minimize the voltage energy loss associated with the hole transfer. When the donor is blended with IDIC for OSCs, a fair PCE of 7.81% was acquired after thermal annealing. Besides, we investigated the impact of molecular weight on the material properties and device performance. It is found that the polymer with a higher Mn exhibits intense pre-aggregation profiles, induces evident and decent phase-separated morphology, and thus leads to higher hole mobility and exciton dissociation that account for the superior PCE. It is worth pointing out that although PW30H has a much higher Mn, it is not the ceiling in terms of performance for the newly structured molecular backbone. If we further increase the Mn, the solubility will be sacrificed. So the Mn for PW30H represents a trade-off for the specific molecular structure. As such, it is easy to understand that there is still much room for advancement toward more intriguing OSC properties via more modifications to the building blocks. For example, additional alkyl chains can be attached to the phenyl ring to improve the solubility for achieving a large window of molecular modulation, and then more potential electron-deficient units can be screened.

Then the solution was stirred at a low temperature for 1 h. Trimethyltin chloride (4 mmol, in 5 mL THF) was added dropwise. The mixture was warmed to RT and stirred overnight. After quenching with water, the product was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was dried with MgSO4 and filtered. After the removal of the solvent via a rotary evaporator, the residue was recrystallized with methanol to afford a yellow solid (0.83 g, 74% yield). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.69 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H), 7.68 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H), 7.33 (s, 2H), 1.17 (br, 42H), 0.36 (s, 18H). 13C NMR (150 MHz, CDCl3): δ 142.64, 142.36, 139.92, 136.86, 132.59, 132.52, 130.31, 129.42, 129.33, 128.40, 123.13, 106.99, 91.38, 18.72, 11.38, −8.33. MS (FT-MS): m/z calcd for C44H55S2Si2 [M-2Sn(CH3)3 + H]+ 703.3, found 703.3.


PBDTPSi-FTAZ (PW30H). 
To a degassed solution of M (0.4 g, 0.39 mmol) and FTAZ (0.27 g, 0.39 mmol) in 20 mL of toluene was added Pd(PPh3)4 (20 mg). The solution was heated at reflux for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was precipitated into methanol. The resulting solids were collected by filtration and purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, and hexanes in sequence to remove oligomers and the catalyst. Finally, the product was extracted into chloroform and then concentrated. Precipitation into methanol of the chloroform concentrated solution yielded the polymer as a dark red solid (0.2 g, 41%). GPC (TCB, 150 °C): Mn = 25.6 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.23. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.06–7.11 (br, 14H), 3.75 (br, 2H), 1.20–0.83 (m, 73H).


PBDTPSi-FTAZ (PW30L). 
To a degassed solution of M (0.2 g, 0.19 mmol) and FTAZ (0.13 g, 0.19 mmol) in 20 mL of toluene was added Pd(PPh3)4 (12 mg). The solution was stirred and heated at reflux for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, the polymer product was received as a purple red solid by following the purification procedures as described for PW30H (0.11 g, 45%). GPC (THF, RT): Mn = 8.3 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.54. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.27–7.32 (br, 14H), 4.73 (br, 2H), 1.25–0.78 (m, 73H).

Device fabrication and characterization
Polymer solar cells were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al. The ITO-glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in sequence for 30 min each. The substrates were dried in an oven at 140 °C for 20 min, and then subjected to treatment with UV-Ozone for 15 min. A layer of PEDOT:PSS (30 nm) was deposited onto ITO through spin-coating the solution at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The wet film was baked at 150 °C for 10 min, and then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The active layer solution was formed by dissolving the donor and acceptor components in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 15 mg mL−1. To fully dissolve the materials, the PW30H based solution was stirred at 50 °C overnight. The active layer was formed by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 45 s. Then the substrates were put in a Petri dish and annealed on a hotplate at varied temperatures for 10 min. Thereafter, a methanol solution of PDIN (1.5 mg mL−1, with 0.5 vol% AcOH) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a layer of Al (100 nm) was thermally deposited in a high vacuum chamber (1 × 10−4 Pa) through a shadow mask. The overlapping area between the cathode and anode defined a pixel size of 6 mm2. For the optimal PCE, 5 nm BCP was thermally deposited under high vacuum on the top of PDIN, and then 100 nm Ag was thermally deposited. The J–V curves were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which was provided by a SAN-EIELS 155 (XE) solar simulator equipped with a standard monocrystalline silicon solar cell to calibrate the light intensity. The EQE data were measured by using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (Crowntech Inc.). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
