    , Accepted 22nd July 2015First published on 24th July 2015AbstractIron phosphide (FeP) was introduced onto silicon nanowires (SiNWs) via precursor loading and phosphorization. The resultant SiNWs/FeP shows remarkably enhanced photoelectrochemical hydrogen production in comparison with bare SiNWs. The solar power conversion efficiency of SiNWs/FeP is as high as 2.64%, which is 94% of that of SiNWs modified with Pt particles, and is larger than those of silicon-based photocathodes loaded with other non-precious electrocatalysts such as transition metals and their chalcogenides. The faster reaction rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP than that of the bare SiNWs was confirmed by an electrochemistry impedance experiment (EIS). The investigations over the EIS spectra and the flat band potential show that the onset potential of cathodic photocurrent is mainly influenced by the reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the photocathode. The transient photocurrent experiments also suggest the faster kinetics of the HER on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP in comparison with that of the bare SiNWs. This result demonstrates a convenient approach to SiNWs loaded with a highly effective electrocatalyst and its promising application potential in photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation.
Introduction
The depletion of fossil fuels and increased environmental pollution have stimulated considerable research concerning the development of clean and renewable energy sources.1,2 The solar-driven water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is promising to produce clean energy. The fast reaction rate of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the surface of a photocathode is essential, because in this case photo-generated electrons in the photocathode can effectively reduce the species in the electrolyte into H2 instead of recombining with photo-generated holes, and therefore the absorbed solar energy can be effectively harvested into H2.
As an abundant and low cost semiconductor, silicon (Si) has been widely used in the field of solar energy conversion, including solar cell and photoelectrochemical water splitting devices.3,4 One-dimensional Si nanostructures (Si nanowires, SiNWs) are promising in the field of photovoltaics because they can remarkably improve optical absorption and charge collection in comparison with the bulk materials.5 Therefore, SiNWs or Si microwires (SiMWs) gain increasing attention in the field of solar energy conversion.6–10 However, the solar power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of a photocathode constructed from native bulk Si, SiNWs, or SiMWs is very low because of its poor intrinsic HER kinetics. The reaction rate of the HER on the surface of Si-based photocathodes can be improved by the loading of noble metal HER catalysts (e.g. Pt) to the Si surface, whereas the high cost and scarcity of noble metal HER catalysts hinder their widespread application.3 The research concerning efficient and non-precious HER catalysts is therefore extensively carried out. Nickel oxide,11 molybdenum sulfide,9,12,13 tungsten sulfide,14 Ni–Mo alloy15 and nickel phosphide16 have been used as HER catalysts on photocathodes so far. Though metal phosphides have shown superior HER catalytic activity in comparison with their chalcogenide counterpart,17–24 only nickel phosphide16 has been used to enhance the HER kinetics on the surface of photocathodes. It is yet to be revealed whether other metal phosphides can be used to promote the performance of photocathodes.
In this article, a convenient approach for the synthesis of the composite of SiNWs and iron phosphide (FeP) is introduced, and the remarkably enhanced hydrogen production capability of the resultant SiNWs/FeP has been demonstrated. Under the same conditions, the PCE of the SiNWs/FeP is as high as 2.64%. This value is 1000% of that of bare SiNWs, and is ca. 94% of that of SiNWs modified with Pt particles (SiNWs/PtNPs) (2.81%).16 The electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the transient photocurrent experiment confirm the faster reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP in comparison with that of the bare SiNWs. The faster reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP affords the larger onset potential (Vonset) of cathodic photocurrent in the SiNWs/FeP. The faradaic efficiency of the SiNWs/FeP is nearly 100%. These results demonstrate the promising application potential of the SiNWs/FeP in practical solar-driven hydrogen generation.
Experimental
Fabrication of SiNWs
Metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) was utilized to fabricate SiNWs.25,26 The p-type (100) Si wafers (1–10 Ω cm) were cleaned in ethanol and acetone by ultrasonication for 15 min, respectively, and then washed with deionized water. The degreased Si substrates were immersed in a boiling solution composed of H2O2, NH3·H2O, and H2O (1:1:5, v/v/v) for 30 min, and afterwards washed by deionized water. In a typical MACE experiment, the cleaned Si substrates were immersed in an aqueous etchant containing AgNO3 (20 mM) and HF (4.5 M) for 30 min at 30 °C. Afterward, the samples were immersed in 5% HNO3 for 30 min to remove silver dendrites covering the surface of SiNWs. Finally, the resultant SiNWs were rinsed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C in air.
Fabrication of SiNWs/FeP
The SiNWs were first treated in a HF aqueous solution (5 wt%) for 10 minutes to remove the native oxide layer on the surface of SiNWs, and then immersed into a Fe(NO3)3 ethanol solution (100 mM) for 3 min. Then the SiNWs were immediately transferred into an electric oven and dried at 80 °C in air. After that, the SiNW/Fe(NO3)3 sample was converted to the SiNWs/FeP at 400 °C for 1 hour in a quartz tube in a tube furnace with N2 flow (100 sccm). In the quartz tube a moderate amount of NaH2PO2 was loaded at the upstream side of the SiNW/Fe(NO3)3 sample. At 400 °C PH3 gas was generated from NaH2PO2 and used to phosphorize the SiNW/Fe(NO3)3 sample. After the phosphorization the sample was naturally cooled to room temperature under continuous N2 flow.
Sample characterization
The morphologies of the SiNWs/FeP were revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, 7001F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, 2100, JEOL). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was carried out on a GENESIS 2000 XM 30T system equipped on the TEM. For TEM investigation, SiNWs/FeP was scratched, and the isolated SiNWs/FeP was dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonication. The dispersion was dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid (300 mesh). The copper grid was then dried at 100 °C for 5 min before the TEM characterization.
The spectra of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were recorded on a Physical Electronics PHI 5700 ESCA System equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) source and a concentric hemispherical energy analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a D8 ADVANCE instrument with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Fe(NO)3 powders were phosphorized under the same conditions used to fabricate the SiNWs/FeP, and the resulting powders were used for XRD experiments.
Electrochemical measurement
The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in an aqueous 0.05 M H2SO4 solution containing 0.5 M K2SO4 with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 614D, CH Instrument). A three-electrode configuration was used in the measurements, with the bare SiNWs or the SiNWs/FeP as the working electrode, a Pt foil (1 × 1 cm2) as the counter electrode, and a mercury/mercurous sulfate electrode (MSE) as the reference electrode. The reversible hydrogen evolution potential (RHE) was determined by the open circuit potential of a clean Pt electrode in the same solution,27,28 being −0.767 V vs. MSE. Therefore, a potential measured with respect to the MSE was referenced to the RHE by adding a value of 0.767 V.
The bare SiNW and the SiNW/FeP samples were assembled into a homemade electrochemical cell. In this setup the area of the sample exposed to the solution during measurements was defined by an o-ring (3 mm inner diameter). An indium–gallium alloy (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was scratched onto the back side of the bare SiNWs or the SiNWs/FeP for ohmic contact, and then the sample was glued to a copper substrate using a silver paste. In photoelectrochemical measurements, the illumination was generated by a xenon lamp (350 W), and before each experiment the density of illumination was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2. The polarization curves of samples were measured at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under illumination and in the dark. The Vonset is defined as the onset potential of cathodic photocurrent, which is the potential corresponding to the zero photocurrent in the polarization curve. The PCE of the photocathode was calculated as η = JmpVmp/Pin, where Jmp and Vmp are the current density and applied potential at the maximum power point, and Pin is the power of incident illumination.27 EIS spectra were performed at 0.3 V vs. RHE with applied 5 mV sinusoidal perturbations in the frequency range of 1–106 Hz with 12 steps per decade. The capacitance–voltage measurement was carried out at 3 × 104 Hz with applied 5 mV sinusoidal perturbations.
The volume of H2 during potentiostatic electrolysis measurement under illumination (V = 0.1 V vs. RHE) was monitored by water displacement as shown in ref. 16. In this experiment, the surface area of the SiNWs/FeP exposed to illumination was ca. 0.1 cm2. The details can also be found in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
Results and discussion
The morphology of the SiNWs/FeP was revealed by a SEM experiment. Fig. 1a shows a representative bird's eye view SEM image of the SiNWs/FeP in low magnification. The morphology of SiNWs is analogous to a typical one resulting from MACE. The length of SiNWs is ca. 4.5 μm. In this magnification the FeP component is hard to be found, implying the small size of FeP loaded on the surface of SiNWs. A SEM image with larger magnification (Fig. 1b) shows clearly the presence of the FeP on the sidewall of SiNWs (indicated by white arrows).

Because of the relatively small amount of FeP in the SiNWs/FeP, the signal from FeP in an XRD pattern of the SiNW/FeP sample is negligible. It is difficult to identify the structure of FeP from the XRD pattern of the SiNWs/FeP. To reveal the structure of FeP, the XRD pattern was recorded from a sample resulting from the phosphorization of Fe(NO3)3 under the same conditions used to phosphorize the SiNW/Fe(NO3)3 sample. The corresponding pattern can be found in Fig. 2. The distinct peaks suggest the good crystallinity of the product. The strong peaks were labelled, and were found to match well with those from orthorhombic phase FeP (JCPDS no. 71-2262, a = 5.193 Å, b = 5.792 Å, c = 3.099 Å). In addition, no apparent peaks from the impurity phase can be found, suggesting the phase purity of the FeP. It is therefore reasonable to deduce that the phosphorization of SiNWs/Fe(NO3)3 converts Fe(NO3)3 into orthorhombic phase FeP on the surface of SiNWs, resulting in the SiNWs/FeP.

The microstructure of FeP in the SiNWs/FeP was further investigated by a TEM experiment. Fig. 3a shows a low magnification TEM image of the SiNWs/FeP, in which the SiNWs (indicated by the black arrow) and FeP components (indicated by the white arrow) exhibit obvious contrast difference. A close examination of a single SiNW (Fig. 3b) shows that two typical morphologies of the FeP component, namely large particles with ca. 40 nm thickness (indicated by open white arrows) and a thin layer with ca. 20 nm thickness (indicated by filled white arrows). Regions enclosed with broken squares in Fig. 3b are enlarged in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. In Fig. 3c it is shown that the large FeP nanoparticle on the surface of SiNW is assembled by smaller particles, as indicated by black arrows. Fig. 3d reveals that the thin layer of FeP is constructed by thin open shells with a typical thickness of ca. 4 nm. The distribution of the FeP component on SiNWs was monitored more clearly in scanning TEM (STEM) mode, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). From 9 STEM images the coverage of FeP on SiNWs is estimated to be 68 ± 17%. The EDX spectrum recorded in a TEM (Fig. S3, ESI†) confirms the presence of Fe and P on SiNWs. A high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of FeP (Fig. 3e) shows that well-defined lattice fringes can be found in the FeP layer. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the lattice fringes results in a set of diffraction pattern (inset of Fig. 3e), and the pattern can be indexed to the diffraction pattern of the [2–13] zone axis of the orthorhombic phase FeP (1/dOA = d(−111) = 0.24 nm, 1/dOB = d(120) = 0.25 nm, ∠AOB = 82°). The HRTEM image confirms that the phosphorization of SiNWs/Fe(NO3)3 results in crystalline FeP on the sidewall of SiNWs.

The chemical compositions and chemical states of FeP in the SiNWs/FeP were accessed via the XPS experiment. In the Fe 2p3/2 window of the XPS spectrum (Fig. 4a) two peaks can be found, and the corresponding binding energy (BE) values are 706.9 eV and 710.9 eV, respectively. The peak with a BE of 706.9 eV is associated with Fe in FeP,29 whereas that of 710.9 eV comes from the oxidized state Fe. The oxidized state of Fe might be iron oxide or iron phosphate on the surface of FeP.30 The P 2p window of the XPS spectrum shows two doublets with the peak BE at 133.8 and 129.5 eV, respectively (Fig. 4b). The doublet with a peak BE of 129.5 eV can be assigned to P in FeP,29 and the doublet with a peak BE of 133.8 eV arises from the P in phosphate. The BE of Fe in FeP is only 0.1 eV positively shifted from that of elemental Fe (706.8 eV),31 suggesting that Fe in FeP has a very small positive charge. Similarly, the BE of P in FeP is only 0.5 eV smaller than that of elemental P (130.0 eV),32 suggesting that P in FeP has a relatively small negative charge. It has been revealed that in hydrogenase and its analogues the hydride acceptor has a small positive charge, and the proton acceptor has a small negative charge.33 The hydride acceptor and proton acceptor are important active sites of hydrogenase and its analogues catalyzing the HER. The weakly charged Fe and P in FeP suggest that FeP would be active in the HER.18,23,24

The performance of the SiNWs/FeP in photoelectrochemical hydrogen production was evaluated via polarization experiments. Fig. 5a shows the current density (J)–potential (V) relationships measured in the dark and under illumination (100 mW cm−2). The Jsc of the bare SiNWs is 1.8 mA cm−2 and the Vonset is 0.34 V. After the introduction of FeP onto the sidewall of SiNWs, the photoresponse of the resultant photocathode was markedly enhanced. The Jsc of the SiNWs/FeP is as large as 13.9 mA cm−2, much larger than that of un-modified SiNWs. Meanwhile, the Vonset of SiNWs/FeP is increased to 0.43 V. The PCE of SiNWs/FeP is computed to be 2.64%, which is more than ten times the PCE of the bare SiNWs (0.245%).

Pt nanoparticles were also introduced onto SiNWs via electroless plating, and the optimal PCE of the SiNWs/PtNPs is 2.81% (see also Fig. S4a, ESI†).16 The PCE of the SiNWs/FeP is nearly 94% of that of SiNWs/PtNPs. The coverage of FeP on SiNWs in the SiNW/FeP sample is 68 ± 17%, whereas the coverage of PtNPs in the SiNW/PtNP sample is less than 12.5% (panel c to panel d of Fig. S4, ESI†). Further increasing the coverage of PtNPs (longer deposition time) did not result in larger PCE of SiNWs/PtNPs (Fig. S4a, ESI†). The cost of FeP is much smaller than that of PtNPs; therefore the larger loading amount of FeP on SiNWs does not hamper the promising application potential of SiNWs/FeP. On the other hand, the photocurrent diminishes in the potential range of 0.1 to −0.1 V vs. RHE in SiNWs/FeP, whereas typical saturation photocurrent can be found in SiNWs/PtNPs (Fig. S4a, ESI†). It is worth noting that the FeP component distributes homogeneously on the sidewall of SiNWs, and can be found on top, middle, and bottom regions of SiNWs (Fig. 2 and S2, ESI†), whereas PtNPs cover only the top region of SiNWs (Fig. S4c and d, ESI†). The selective loading of PtNPs on the top region of SiNWs is the typical morphology of SiNWs/PtNPs fabricated by the electroless plating of PtNPs.34,35 The different characteristics between the photocurrent of SiNWs/FeP and SiNWs/PtNPs are possibly correlated with the different distribution features of FeP and Pt. In SiNWs/FeP, molecular hydrogen can be generated from the bottom part of SiNWs because of the homogeneous distribution of FeP on SiNWs, and these gas bubbles must diffuse among the dense and long SiNW arrays out to the bulk electrolyte. Only if the generated gas bubbles depart from the sidewall of SiNWs, the corresponding region can contribute again to the photocurrent. Otherwise the corresponding region would be inactive in the HER because the region cannot contact with the electrolyte. In the measurement of the polarization curve, the amount of gas bubbles generated on the bottom part of SiNWs increase with the photocurrent. With the photocurrent being sufficiently large, the out-diffusion rate of gas bubbles becomes smaller than the generation rate of gas bubbles, and some bubbles might be trapped on the bottom region of SiNWs. In this case the corresponding region of SiNWs would be inactive in the HER, and the photocurrent will diminish due to the decrease of the active area of the photocathode. In contrast, all gas bubbles are generated on the top region of SiNWs/PtNPs because of the loading feature of PtNPs. The release of gas bubbles from the surface of SiNWs/PtNPs is much easier and faster than that of SiNWs/FeP. The SiNWs/PtNPs behaves similar to a planar electrode, and therefore the corresponding photocurrent exhibits a typical saturation value. On the other hand, the trapped gas bubbles might scatter the incident illumination, resulting in the diminishing of light absorption in SiNWs. This might be another possible reason for different features of photocurrent.
The PCE performance of typical photocathodes are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Among various Si-based photocathodes loaded with non-precious HER catalysts, the SiNWs/FeP has larger PCE than SiMWs loaded with Mo3S4 clusters (1.24%),9 SiNWs loaded with MoS2 shells (0.03%),36 SiNWs loaded with MoS3 particles (2.28%),13 SiNWs loaded with WS3 nanoparticles (2.02%),14 and pn+ SiMWs loaded with Ni–Mo particles (2.21%),15 while the PCE of the SiNWs/FeP is smaller than that of plane pn+ Si loaded with MoSx (7.46%),12 SiNWs loaded with Ni12P5,16 and SiNWs loaded with Ni2P.16 It is worth noting that the PCE of the SiNWs/FeP is even larger than that of some Si photocathodes loaded with Pt particles, for example, SiMWs loaded with Pt particles (0.21%),28 plane Si loaded with Pt particles (2.1%),28 SiNWs loaded with Pt particles deposited by atomic layer deposition (1.3% 37 and 1.53% 35), and 20 μm-thick Si structure loaded with Pt nanoparticles (1.19%).38 The Si-based photocathodes with larger PCE than the SiNWs/FeP include pn+ Si (plane Si,12,39 SiMWs,28 30–350 μm thick plane Si,40 and 300 nm thick amorphous Si film on a transparent conductive substrate41) loaded with Pt particles, and nanoporous black Si loaded with buried Pt particles (3.23%).42 The low-cost, convenient fabrication and the large PCE of the SiNWs/FeP make its application potential promising.
The comparison between the PCE of the bare SiNWs and the SiNWs/FeP explicitly shows the enhancement in the photocathode's performance by the introduction of FeP. The enhancement of photocurrent density of the SiNWs/FeP is associated with the HER catalytic activity of the FeP component. The activity of FeP in the HER was confirmed by a polarization curve of FeP resulting from the phosphorization of Fe(NO3)3 under the same conditions used to phosphorize the SiNW/Fe(NO3)3 sample (Fig. S5, ESI†). It is shown that the overpotential required for the current density of 20 mA cm−2 is 275 mV for the FeP, while the current density of a bare glassy carbon electrode is negligible in the potential range of 0 to −0.5 V vs. RHE. The active FeP accelerates the reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP, affording the larger photocurrent density.
The faster reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP in comparison with that of the bare SiNWs is confirmed by the corresponding EIS experiments. Fig. 5b shows the EIS spectra of the SiNWs/FeP and the bare SiNWs measured under the same conditions, and the detailed presentation of data can be found in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†). Two semicircles can be distinguished from the EIS spectra of the SiNWs/FeP and the bare SiNWs (Fig. 5b). The semicircle in the low frequency range is correlated with the HER at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, with smaller diameter corresponding to a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct,dl) of the double layer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface (i.e. the faster reaction rate of the HER).43 The semicircle in the low frequency range corresponding to the SiNWs/FeP has smaller diameter than that corresponding to the bare SiNWs (Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, the corresponding Rct,dl values resulting from data fitting of the EIS spectrum using an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S6c (ESI†) are 689 Ω for the SiNWs/FeP and 25540 Ω for the SiNWs. The values of elements in the equivalent circuit can be found in Table S2 (ESI†). The smaller diameter of the semicircle in the low frequency range of the SiNWs/FeP and the smaller Rct,dl of SiNWs/FeP confirm that the reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP is much faster than that of the bare SiNW sample.
Besides PCE, the Vonset of the SiNWs/FeP is also larger than that of the bare SiNWs. Here the Vonset is defined as the onset potential of the cathodic photocurrent (Fig. 5a). In principle, the most extreme value of Vonset is the flat band potential (Vfb) of a photocathode, and the presence of overpotential required to drive the HER will negatively shift the Vonset from Vfb. To reveal the origin of the difference of the Vonset in the SiNWs/FeP and the bare SiNWs, the Vfb of both samples were derived from the capacitance versus applied potential relation via the Mott–Schottky relationship44 1/C2 = 2(Va − Vfb − kT/q)/(qNdεsε0A2), where C is the space charge capacity, Va is the applied potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the electron charge, Nd is the donor density, εs is the dielectric constant of materials, ε0 is the electric permittivity of a vacuum, and A is area. The Mott–Schottky plot of the SiNWs/FeP and the bare SiNWs are shown in Fig. 5c, and the Vfb is 0.47 V vs. RHE for the SiNWs/FeP and 0.45 V vs. RHE for the SiNWs, respectively. The SiNWs/FeP has larger Vfb than the bare SiNWs, suggesting that the band edge position of the SiNWs/FeP contributes to its larger Vonset. On the other hand, the Vfb of the SiNWs/FeP is only 20 mV larger than that of the bare SiNWs, while the Vonset of the SiNWs/FeP is 90 mV larger than that of the bare SiNWs. The larger difference in the Vonset than that in Vfb suggests that the Vonset is more influenced by the overpotential required for the HER. This is in accordance with the faster reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP in comparison with that of the bare SiNWs (Fig. 5b).
The Vonset values of various Si nanostructures are different in the literature. The Vonset is 0.04 V vs. RHE for bare SiMWs;9 it is larger than 0.28 V vs. RHE for nanoporous silicon; and it varies from 0.23 to 0.38 V vs. RHE for SiNWs resulting from MACE,45 smaller than 0 vs. RHE for SiNWs fabricated via MACE,34 and so on. The Vonset of the bare SiNWs in our experiments is 0.34 V vs. RHE. The bare SiNWs reported here lie in the Si nanostructures with large Vonset. The Vonset is correlated with the Vfb of Si nanostructures, the kinetics overpotential for the HER on the surface of the Si nanostructures, the surface states, and the morphology of the Si nanostructures. The large Vfb of the bare SiNWs (Fig. 5c) might be responsible for its large Vonset.
The transient responses of the bare SiNWs and the SiNWs/FeP during a potentiostatic electrolysis experiment carried out under chopped illumination were monitored, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 5d. Similar to that revealed by the polarization experiment, under the same applied potential the stationary photocurrent density (Iph,st) of the bare SiNWs (curve I in Fig. 5d) is ca. 0.04 mA cm−2, much smaller than that of the SiNWs/FeP (ca. 4 mA cm−2, curve II in Fig. 5d). Moreover, the Iph,st/Iph,in ratio of the bare SiNWs (0.14) is also much smaller than that of the SiNWs/FeP (0.71), where Iph,in is the initial photocurrent density spike when the light is just switched on. The bare SiNW sample has a small Iph,st/Iph,in ratio, meaning that most photo-generated electrons are consumed by recombining with photo-generated holes inside SiNWs instead of being used to reduce the H+ in the electrolyte into molecule hydrogen. In contrast, most of the photo-generated electrons in the SiNW/FeP sample participate in the HER reaction, as suggested by its high Iph,st/Iph,in ratio. The different behaviours between the photo-generated electrons in the bare SiNWs and the SiNWs/FeP can be correlated with the different reaction rates of the HER on the surface of the corresponding sample. Without a HER catalyst, the reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the bare SiNWs is relatively slow so that most photo-generated electrons would be trapped on the surface state of SiNWs and then recombine with photo-generated holes.46,47 With the effective HER catalyst (FeP), the reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP is markedly enhanced so that the photo-generated electrons can pass quickly through the solid/electrolyte interface and take part in the HER reaction.
Potentiostatic photoelectrolysis was utilized to evaluate the stability of the SiNWs/FeP in long-term photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation. The corresponding result is shown in Fig. 6a. The current density exhibits only a ca. 10% decrease after 5000 s potentiostatic electrolysis (Fig. 6a).

The faradaic yield of the SiNWs/FeP during H2 production was evaluated by the comparison of detected volume and theoretical volume of generated hydrogen during a potentiostatic photoelectrolysis experiment. The volume of generated gas was monitored via a water displacement method when a potentiostatic photoelectrolysis measurement was carried out. The theoretical volume of hydrogen was calculated by assuming that all electrons passing through the photocathode are totally used to reduce H+ into hydrogen (100% faradaic H2 production). The theoretical volume and the experimentally detected volume of hydrogen are plotted in Fig. 6b. It can be found that the detected volume of hydrogen matches the theoretical one, suggesting that the faradaic yield of H2 production from SiNWs/FeP in photoelectrolysis is nearly 100%.
Conclusions
The SiNWs/FeP was fabricated by precursor loading and phosphorization. The SiNWs/FeP exhibits remarkably enhanced photoelectrochemical performance in comparison with the bare SiNWs. The PCE of the SiNWs/FeP is ca. 94% of that of the SiNWs/PtNPs, and larger than those of Si-based photocathodes loaded with non-precious electrocatalysts such as transition metals and their chalcogenides. The fast reaction rate of the HER on the surface of the SiNWs/FeP induced by FeP affords the excellent performance of the SiNWs/FeP. The photo-current density exhibits only a ca. 10% decrease after 5000 s potentiostatic electrolysis, and the faradaic efficiency of the SiNW/FeP during photo-electrolysis is nearly 100%. The method introduced here offers a convenient approach for the design and exploitation of devices with significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical hydrogen production capabilities.
