Among the various possibilities, solar energy represents a clean, sustainable, and renewable technique for providing humans with power. Inspired by photoactive reactions in nature, such as photocatalysis in self-sustaining ecosystems, artificial photocatalysts based on metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are broadly designed for hydrogen evolution from water, value-added chemicals from carbon dioxide, nitrogen fixation, energy-saving organic transformations, and photodegradation/photocatalytic removal of pollutants in the air (e.g., aldehydes and aromatics) and pollutants in waste water (e.g., dyes, antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, phenols, formaldehyde, and hexavalent chromium). Photovoltaic cells based on MOFs including perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic solar cells (OSCs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), MOF-sensitized solar cells (MSSCs), and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have been rapidly developing over the past few years. This review article covers recent progress in the aforementioned topics and discusses future directions.Cong CongCong Cong received her MS degree from Nara Women's University, Japan, in 2011 and her PhD from Kyoto University, Japan, in 2014.

1. Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) consist of organic linkers and metal salts or secondary building units (SBUs) that form open frameworks and predictable structures, especially when using SBUs and multidentate organic linkers.1,2 MOF-based materials can be used in many applications such as H2/CH4/C2H2 storage,3–5 CO2 capture/conversion,6–10 catalysis,11,12 photonic applications,13–15 and DNA delivery.16 The need to understand the mechanisms of crystallization of MOFs has stimulated deep investigations of transition states by in situ techniques17–22 and how parameters affect crystal growth in addition to the resultant behaviors. The impact of time on a dynamic process is important;23 for instance, MOF glasses were prepared by a melt-quenched method at low temperatures, and fracture toughness and short-range disorder were reported.24–26 The evolution of transition states of MOF glasses over time can be directly analyzed by X-ray diffraction, ultrahigh-field NMR, Raman spectroscopy, optical microscopy, etc.
As a class of multifunctional porous materials, MOF-based solar-driven water harvesting,27–30 solar-driven steam generation/desalination/water purification,31–36 photocatalysis,37–39 photovoltaics,40–42 and solar thermal energy storage43,44 have been widely studied because solar energy represents a sustainable, and green technology with good prospects. Among the abovementioned photoactive applications, photocatalysis and photovoltaics are particularly attractive.40,45–50 Consequently, intensive efforts have been made to prepare efficient, stable, eco-friendly, scalable, and cost-effective materials to fulfill the requirements, although challenging. One paramount factor involved in photoelectroactive MOFs for photocatalysis and photovoltaics is how to design and prepare semiconductive materials with appropriate band gaps suitable for solar-driven activities (Scheme 1). MOF-based photocatalytic reactions span from H2 evolution,51–55 CO2 reduction,56–60 N2 fixation61–63 to photodegradation of gaseous pollutants,64–68 photodegradation of aqueous pollutants,69–74 and various types of organic transformations,75–78etc. MOF-based photovoltaics have been studied with the integration of perovskites,79–82 dyes,83,84 organic polymers,85,86 and quantum dots.87,88

In the following sections, we will first present construction strategies of photoelectroactive MOFs, then summarize and discuss photocatalysis in the following: (1) photocatalytic H2 evolution; (2) photoreduction of N2; (3) photoreduction of CO2; (4) photodegradation/photocatalytic removal of gaseous organic/inorganic pollutants; (5) photodegradation of aqueous organic/inorganic pollutants; and (6) photocatalytic organic syntheses. We also cover photovoltaics using MOF materials in the following areas: (1) perovskite solar cells (PSCs); (2) dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); (3) MOF-sensitized solar cells (MSSCs); (4) organic solar cells (OSCs); and (5) quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).
2. Strategies for designing photoelectroactive MOFs
Photocatalytic reactions occur upon light irradiation and provide a way to obtain chemical energy from solar energy. Photocatalysts that can maximally utilize the spectral wavelength range of sunlight, especially visible light, are highly needed. Therefore, semiconductive materials with the ability to generate high-density photogenerated charge carriers (i.e., photoelectrons and holes), good separation, slow recombination rate of electron–hole pairs, quick migration speed, and suitable band gaps with tailorability to conduct efficient photocatalytic reactions for practical uses are vitally important.49,89–91 MOFs are promising due to their merits of large surface area, high porosity, and tunable light absorption ability with precise structural identification. These features of MOFs are also beneficial for MOF-based solar cells since photovoltaic cells convert solar irradiation into electrical energy, with the requirements of decent light harvesting ability, power conversion efficiency, and stability.40,92
Routine strategies for the design of MOF-based photoelectroactive materials include the following: (1) pristine MOFs; (2) hybrid MOFs or MOF composites; and (3) MOF derivatives. In general, in situ and ex situ methods can be utilized to construct four types of MOF materials for photocatalysis and photovoltaics: (I) pristine MOFs without loading guest species; (II) hybrid MOFs with guest species coated on MOF surfaces; (III) hybrid MOFs with guest species partially embedded in MOFs; and (IV) hybrid MOFs with guest species fully embedded or encapsulated in MOFs (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Schematic illustration of the preparation of representative photoelectroactive MOF materials. 
Notably, organic linkers of carboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid (H2BDC)93–95 and its derivatives with functional groups (e.g., –NH2, –OH, –SH, –SCH3),96–100 trimesic acid (H3BTC),101–103 and meso-tetraphenylporphine-4,4′,4′′,4′′′-tetracarboxylic acid (H2TCPP)57,84,104 were extensively exploited to construct photoelectroactive MOFs for photocatalysis and photovoltaics. The introduction of functional groups enabled the improvement of light absorption and extended wavelength utilization. Besides, the introduction of photosensitizers such as Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) or Cu(dppe)PF6 (dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) at chelating nitrogen binding sites of organic linkers105,106 and luminescent units such as naphthalene107 or naphthalene diimide (NDI) core108 are also beneficial for photocatalysis and photovoltaics. To further enhance photoelectroactive performances, the integration with guest species to form hybrid MOFs was investigated, which helps to separate and suppress the recombination rates of photoelectrons and holes.57,109–112 MOF derivatives are obtained through the heat treatment of pristine MOFs or hybrid MOFs, which usually sacrifices organic linkers upon calcination but retains porosity and enhances electrical conductivity.
3. Photocatalysis based on MOFs
Pristine MOFs with active sites have shown potential for many photocatalytic reactions. MOFs are also applied as host materials to encapsulate guest species (e.g., semiconductive metal nanoparticles (NPs), metal oxides, polyoxometalates (POMs), photoactive metal complexes, perovskites, quantum dots, dyes, and g-C3N4) to form hybrid MOFs for improvement (Scheme 3). Moreover, MOF derivatives from pristine/hybrid MOFs for photocatalysis with impressive performances have been reported as well. MOF-based catalysts have shown homogeneous and heterogeneous merits in catalytic reactions.91,113,114

3.1 Photocatalytic H2 evolution
Hydrogen generation through photocatalytic reactions is quite attractive. Extensive efforts and impressive achievements have been reported by using MOF-based photocatalysts such as pristine MOFs,115–119 hybrid MOFs with guest species like metal nanoparticles,55,93,96,120–125 metal sulfides,51,52,126–128 metal oxides,54,129–132 MXenes,133 g-C3N4,134,135 and MOF derivatives.136,137
Recently, Ti8Zr2O12(COO)16 clusters in bimetallic TiZr MOFs involving Ti4+ and Zr4+ ions were designed and prepared for the generation of hydrogen under light irradiation.120 Compared to monometallic Zr6O4(OH)4(COO)16 clusters in Zr MOFs, eight Ti4+ replaced four Zr4+ while leaving the other two Zr4+ on the top and bottom sides (Fig. 1a and b). A bimetallic TiZr MOF constructed from mixed metal salts of ZrCl4 and Ti(OiPr)4 and acetic acid/2-aminoterephthalic acid (BDC-NH2) was reported to show a hydrogen evolution rate of 594 μmol g−1 h−1 when coupled with Pt NPs in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA) under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation (>380 nm). Photogenerated electrons migrated from excited BDC-NH2 to the Ti8Zr2O12(COO)16 cluster and then to the surface of Pt NPs where hydrogen was produced. Moreover, a Ti MOF constructed by the integration of Ti(OnBu)4 and BDC-NH2 with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to form a hybrid material was reported to show a hydrogen evolution rate of 360 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation.96 The hybrid Ti MOF/COF material was linked through covalent amide bonds, which contributed to the improvement of charge separation and stability.

The simultaneous integration of mixed noble metals with MOFs for the production of H2 under visible light irradiation was also reported. For instance, a hybrid Zr MOF-Ir/Pt was constructed from ZrCl4 and H2TCPP forming a Zr MOF that further reacted with IrCl3·xH2O and H2PtCl6·6H2O to generate structures consisting of Zr–O clusters and porphyrin-Ir/Pt units; it showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 201.9 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of TEOA (Fig. 1c).53 The introduction and stabilization of single metal atoms of Ir and Pt inside Zr MOF were responsible for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which showed speedy mass permeation and efficient separation of photoelectrons and holes. In another case, a hybrid Pt@Ti MOF/Au constructed from Ti(OiPr)4 and H2BDC forming a Ti MOF further with guest species of Pt NPs and Au NPs showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 1743.0 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of TEOA (Fig. 1d).93 Plasmonic electron injection from the external Au NPs to the Ti MOF, and Schottky junction electron trapping from the Ti MOF to internal Pt NPs were proposed to drive photoelectrons in a fast flow, which exhibited an efficient electron–hole separation to contribute a synergetic effect.
Noble metal-free MOF-based hybrid materials for photocatalytic H2 evolution were also reported. For instance, a two-dimensional (2D) Ni MOF [Ni(phen)(oba)n]·0.5nH2O (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, oba = 4,4′-oxybis(benzoate)) integration with CdS NPs showed a remarkably high hydrogen evolution rate of 45201 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of lactic acid under visible light irradiation.52 Well-matched electronic band structures, exposed active sites, and strong interactions between 2D Ni MOF and CdS NPs contributed an impressive photocatalytic H2 performance. Moreover, nanocatalysts of ZnO/ZnS were generated by heating a hybrid MOF-5 that was constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and H2BDC with thioacetamide, which showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 415 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of Na2S and Na2SO3 under visible light irradiation.136 The reduction of the pathways of charge carriers and enhancement of efficiency for charge carriers contributed to hydrogen evolution by such stable and recyclable ZnO/ZnS. A hybrid material with CdS quantum dots (QDs) and carbon nanodots (CDs) encapsulated in a Cr MOF that was constructed from Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and H2BDC to form CD/CdS/Cr MOF was reported to show a hydrogen evolution rate of 14.7 μmol h−1 in the presence of lactic acid under visible light irradiation.137 Substitution of noble metal cocatalysts with QDs/CDs realized the improvement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with possibilities of lowering costs and the aggregation of metal NPs. In the case of ZnIn2S4@NH2-MIL-125(Ti), a Ti MOF constructed from Ti(OnBu)4 and BDC-NH2 was integrated with ZnIn2S4 nanosheets on the surface, which showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 2204.2 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of Na2S and Na2SO3 under visible light irradiation due to merits of stability, appropriate band structure, and close contact interfaces.51 A hybrid material prepared by NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and benzoic acid-functionalized g-C3N4 with cocatalyst Pt NPs showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 1123 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of TEOA under visible light irradiation.134 Benzoic acid played the role of an electron mediator that was able to separate photogenerated charge carriers.
3.2 Photoreduction of N2
Inspired by N2 fixation by nitrogenase in nature, the efficient capture and conversion of N2 into NH3 in ambient atmospheres under mild conditions represent challenging work that provides sources for chemical fertilizers, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and energy storage media, etc.62,138 Pristine MOFs62,99,139–142 and hybrid MOFs such as Cr MOF/POM,61 Ni MOF/MXene,143 Zn MOF/perovskite,144 and Zr MOF/Au NPs/PTFE (PTFE = polytetrafluoroethylene)63 have been widely explored to photoreduce N2.
For instance, a pristine Zr MOF, constructed from ZrCl4 and 2,5-dimercapto-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2MBDC) with thermal treatment in an inert gas to form the corresponding dehydrated catalysts, was reported to convert N2 into NH3 in the presence of deionized water with a rate around 32.4 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation (>400 nm) at room temperature (Fig. 2a).99 Defects (coordination unsaturation or missing organic linkers) were formed after heat treatment as active sites, which activated and converted N2 into NH3 by way of μ-N–Zr interactions with the assistance of photoelectrons and protons upon light irradiation. A bimetallic ZrHf MOF constructed from mixed metal salts of ZrCl4 and HfCl4 and H2MBDC exhibited a rate of 116.1 μmol g−1 h−1 for NH3 generation in the presence of K2SO3 solution under visible light irradiation.141 N2 reduction occurred at Zr sites while Hf sites played a role in the accumulation of electrons. Functional thiol groups enabled a wide range of light utilization in contrast to the corresponding terephthalic acid-supported bimetallic MOFs. Furthermore, a heterovalent Fe MOF was constructed from mixed metal salts of FeCl3 and FeCl2 and H2BDC and was reported to exhibit a rate of 164 μmol g−1 h−1 for NH3 generation in the presence of K2SO3 solution under visible light irradiation.142 Activation of N2 occurred at Fe2+ sites while Fe3+ was responsible for N2 adsorption. The proposed mechanism involved π-back-donation from the d-orbital electrons of Fe2+ to the πg* antibonding orbital of N2.

A Cr MOF constructed from Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and H2BDC was hybridized with silicotungstic acid (H4SiW12O40) to form a Cr MOF/POM composite catalyst, which showed N2 reduction with a rate of 75.56 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of ultrapure water under UV-vis light irradiation at room temperature.61 Photoelectrons from the Cr MOF upon light irradiation efficiently flowed to the encapsulated active POMs through hydrogen bonds, which accumulated on the conduction band of POMs and then coupled with protons from water to release NH3. A Ni MOF constructed from NiCl2·6H2O and H2BDC was hybridized with Ti3C2 quantum dots to exhibit a rate of 88.79 μmol g−1 h−1 for NH3 generation in the presence of Na2SO3 solution upon light irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp at 25 °C (Fig. 2b).143 The hybrid Ni MOF/Ti3C2 material with the improved abilities of interfacial charge transfer and absorption, in addition to rich exposed active Ni sites, showed a four-time enhancement of the photocatalytic performance in contrast to pristine 2D Ni MOF. Moreover, a Zr MOF constructed from ZrCl4 and H2BDC was impregnated with Au NPs and filtered onto PTFE to form a Au@Zr MOF/PTFE membrane (Fig. 2c).63 The resultant N2 gas-permeable membrane exhibited a rate of 18.9 mmol g−1 h−1 for NH3 generation under visible light irradiation (>400 nm). Impressively, this hybrid membrane showed a synergistic effect between the multifunctional roles of Au NPs (e.g., photosensitizer, cocatalyst, and plasmonic promoter) and the Zr MOF substrate (host matrix with protons for Au NPs and large surface area for N2 absorption) to reduce N2, and also showed a dynamic flow process.
3.3 Photoreduction of CO2
MOF-based photocatalysts for CO2 conversion have been intensively studied, which helps to decrease CO2 concentration and realize carbon neutralization while obtaining valuable carbon fuels and chemicals from abundant CO2.145–148
Pristine MOFs for CO2 photoreduction have shown impressive performances.60,106,149–155 For instance, a MOF photocatalyst mPT-Cu/Re constructed from ZrCl4 and mixed organic linkers of 4,4′-(1,10-phenanthroline-3,8-diyl)dibenzoic acid (H2PT) and 2′′-nitro-[1,1′:4′,1′′:4′′,1′′′-quaterphenyl]-4,4′′′-dicarboxylic acid (H2TPHN) followed by the stepwise addition of Re(CO)5Cl, Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 and 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane was reported to produce CO from CO2, and obtained a turnover number of 1328 within 48 h in the presence of the sacrificial agent 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole under visible light (350–700 nm) irradiation (Fig. 3a).106 A selectivity of CO/H2 (9:1) was also achieved. Similarly, the utilization of open N,N′-chelating sites in Ru-MOF-253-Re, constructed from AlCl3·6H2O and 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid (dcbpy) followed by stepwise addition of Re(CO)5Cl and Ru(bpy)2Cl2, was reported to produce formate as the major product along with CO and H2 as minor products in the presence of a sacrificial agent, TEOA, under visible light irradiation (420–800 nm).149 Electrons induced by light irradiation migrated from Ru sensitizers to Re sites where photocatalytic CO2 reduction occurred. MOF-253-Ru(dcbpy)2 produced formic acid, CO and 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline in the presence of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline as a sacrificial agent under white LED irradiation, and other valuable organic products were also obtained.150 Another case involving RuCl3·3H2O, ZrOCl2·8H2O, and 4′-(4-methoxycarboxyphenyl)-2.2′:6′,2′′ terpyridine produced formate with a conversion rate of 366 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of TEOA as the sacrificial agent under visible light irradiation (420–800 nm) (Fig. 3b).151 A Zr MOF photocatalyst constructed from ZrCl4 and 2,2′-diamino-4,4′-stilbenedicarboxylic acid was reported to produce formate with a conversion rate of 96.2 μmol h−1 mmolMOF−1 in the presence of TEOA under visible light irradiation (420–800 nm).152 The prepared Zr MOF displayed dual photocatalytic CO2 reaction routes at both chromophore and Zr–O cluster sites (Fig. 3c). Moreover, a Zn MOF ([Zn3(btca)2(OH)2]) constructed from Zn(CH3COO)2 and 1,2,3-benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid (H2btca) converted CO2 to CH4 with a rate of 4 μmol g−1 h−1 in the absence of a sacrificial agent to perform the Sabatier reaction at 215 °C under UV-vis irradiation (Fig. 3d).58

The encapsulation of guest species, such as metal NPs/clusters,98,109,154,156,157 metal oxide/sulfide/selenide,56,158–160 QDs,57,161 g-C3N4,94,162,163 graphene,59 and POMs,164 in host MOFs to prepare hybrid composites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions has also been widely explored. For instance, the encapsulation of Pt NPs inside NH2-UiO-68, which was constructed from ZrCl4 and amino-terphenyl-4,4′′-dicarboxylic acid (NH2-tpdc), produced CO from CO2 with a rate of 400.2 μmol g−1 in the presence of TEOA under visible light irradiation (400–780 nm).109 The encapsulation of Pt NPs inside MOFs (Type IV) was more efficient than their location outside (Type II), or both inside and outside, or pristine NH2-UiO-68 (Type I). Another case showed the encapsulation of Ag NPs in hollow structural Co-MOF-74 that was constructed from Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2-methylimidazole, 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (H4DOBDC), and Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O, which produced CO and H2 in the presence of TEOA under visible light irradiation (400–1000 nm).98 The encapsulation of TiO2 QDs inside MIL-101-Cr-NO2 (which was constructed from Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and H2BDC, forming MIL-101-Cr followed by post-synthetic nitro group functionalization) produced remarkable conversion rates of CO and CH4 (12 mmol g−1 h−1), besides O2 (7.2 mmol g−1 h−1), under 350 nm light irradiation.56 The encapsulation of CH3NH3PbI3 QDs inside PCN-221(Fe0.2) (constructed from ZrCl4, H2TCPP and Fe TCPP) produced CO (34%) and CH4 (66%) from CO2 with a total yield of 1559 μmol g−1 in the presence of the sacrificial agent H2O under visible light irradiation.57 Stability enhancement in the presence of water and intimate contact between QDs and Fe sites facilitated photoelectron transfer to achieve efficient CO2 reduction. In another case, a hybrid material with the integration of carbon nitride quantum dots (g-CNQDs) and 2D Co MOF that was constructed from Co(NO3)2·6H2O, H2TCPP and benzoic acid produced CO (16.10 μmol g−1 h−1) and CH4 (6.86 μmol g−1 h−1) from CO2 in the presence of TEOA under visible light irradiation (>420 nm).161 The encapsulation of CdS NPs inside ZIF-8 (constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 2-methylimidazole) produced CO (32.13 μmol h−1) and H2 (7.09 μmol h−1) from CO2 in the presence of TEOA with the assistance of cocatalyst Co(bpy)3Cl2 under visible light irradiation (>420 nm).158 Photostability, adsorption capability, selectivity, and efficiency were improved due to core–shell structures for CdS/ZIF-8 in contrast to CdS-based photocatalysts.
The MOF derivative, carbon-coated Co1.11Te2 prepared from ZIF-67, which was constructed from Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 2-methylimidazole reacting with Te powder at 700 °C, was reported to produce CO (2.30 × 104 μmol g−1 h−1) and H2 in the presence of TEOA with the assistance of photosensitizer Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O under white LED irradiation.105 The half-metallic nature of Co1.11Te2 was beneficial for photoelectron transfer in the process of CO2 reduction. A 2D porous Co3O4 obtained by the calcination of ZIF-67 was reported to produce CO (4.52 μmol h−1) and H2 (1.93 μmol h−1) in the presence of TEOA with the assistance of the photosensitizer Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O under LED lamp irradiation (400–1000 nm).165 The ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets displayed higher rates for the production of CO due to the enhancement of adsorption for CO2 and rich active sites in contrast to bulk Co3O4 catalysts.
3.4 Photodegradation of gaseous organic and inorganic pollutants
Air pollutants, including aldehydes, aromatics, and nitrogen oxides, are responsible for severe problems that affect the environment (e.g., acid rain and chemical smog) and human health (e.g., cancer and respiratory diseases).166–169 Photocatalysis utilizing MOFs has the potential to successfully degrade harmful gaseous pollutants.

3.4.1 Photodegradation of aldehydes. 
Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are constantly produced and released into the air, which causes serious health and environmental risks. The degradation of gaseous aldehydes to harmless species using MOF-based photocatalysts has made significant progress over the past years. For instance, TiO2 was encapsulated in NH2-MIL-125 (constructed from TiCl4 and 2-aminoterephtalic acid) to form TiO2@ NH2-MIL-125, which photocatalyzed gaseous HCHO (10 ppm) at a flow rate of 600 mL min−1 (20:80 vol% O2:N2) in the presence of water vapor (60% RH) to give CO2 and H2O at 25 °C. A removal efficiency of 90% and a reaction rate of 3.67 × 10−8 mol s−1 g−1 within 122 h under UV irradiation (365 nm) were reported.170 The proposed Z-mechanism involved the generation of active radical species of ˙O2− and ˙OH, which contributed to the oxidation of HCHO (Fig. 4a). In another case, ZIF-8-T was prepared by the calcination of ZIF-8, and photocatalyzed gaseous HCHO (20 ppm) to CO2 and H2O at 40 °C, exhibiting almost 100% removal (0.0754 min−1 within 1 h) under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5) irradiation.64 The proposed mechanism involved the generation of active oxygen species of ˙O2− and H2O2 along with photogenerated holes, which contributed to the oxidation of HCHO, forming isocyanate groups during the preparation of ZIF-8-T (Fig. 4b). In addition, MIL-125(N-Ti9Zn1), constructed from Ti(OiPr)4, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, H2BDC and pyrrole, photocatalyzed gaseous CH3CHO (200 ppm) in the presence of water vapor (80% RH) to give CO2 and H2O at 298 K. A removal efficiency of 98% and pseudo-first-order kinetics of 0.1797 min−1 within 24 min under visible light irradiation (>420 nm) were reported.169 Active radical species of ˙O2− and ˙OH were proposed for the oxidation of CH3CHO (Fig. 4c). The introduction of pyrrole and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O into MIL-125(Ti) showed a narrower band gap of 1.85 eV for the utilization of visible light in addition to the enhancement of hydrophobicity and alkalinity, for stronger adsorption of CH3CHO, in contrast to pristine MIL-125(Ti). Other multifunctional MOFs were also reported to photodegrade CH3CHO into CO2 and H2O.97,171

3.4.2 Photodegradation of aromatics. 
Toluene, benzene, xylenes and styrene are toxic aromatic VOCs that are harmful to human health and the environment. A photocatalyst FeMOF-0.25 constructed from FeCl3·6H2O, Fe(AC)2 and H2BDC converted gaseous toluene (460 ppm) to CO2 and H2O under ambient conditions, showing a removal efficiency of 100% and a conversion efficiency of 85% within 100 cycles under simulated solar light (AM 1.5) irradiation.67 The proposed mechanism involved the generation of active oxygen species of ˙OH and H2O2. The presence of abundant Fe2+ in FeMOF-0.25 led to the reduction of H2O2, forming more ˙OH, which together with photogenerated holes efficiently oxidized toluene to CO2 and H2O. FeMOF-0.25 could also efficiently remove and photodegrade benzene and p-xylene. In another case, a MOF derivative, GC-N-TiO2, prepared by the stepwise thermal treatment of TiO2-hybridized ZIF-8, photocatalyzed gaseous toluene (either 100 ppm in static conditions or 25 ppm in dynamic conditions) with a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 (20:80 vol% O2:N2) in the presence of water vapor (70% RH) to give CO2 and H2O under ambient conditions and UV light irradiation (Fig. 5a).65 Conversion efficiencies of almost 100% were reported within 1 h under static conditions, and around 70% within 24 h under dynamic conditions. Light-induced ˙OH and photogenerated holes oxidized toluene to CO2 and H2O. 75TiO2-25UN was prepared by the encapsulation of TiO2 into UiO-66-NH2, which was constructed from ZrCl4 and BDC-NH2 photocatalyzed gaseous toluene (25 ppm) with a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 (20:80 vol% O2:N2) in the presence of water vapor (60% RH) to give CO2 and H2O at ambient conditions, which showed a conversion efficiency of 72.7% within 240 min under UV light irradiation (365 nm).97 Light-induced ˙O2− and photogenerated holes dominantly oxidized toluene to CO2 and H2O (Fig. 5b). Moreover, C–H activation of toluene using Fe-UiO-66 that was constructed from FeCl3·6H2O, ZrCl4 and H2BDC was also reported, which formed benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid instead of the products of CO2 and H2O under visible light (>380 nm) irradiation.172

The photocatalytic degradation of gaseous styrene is another area of focus. For instance, TiO2@C-N(30) derived from NH2-MIL-125(Ti) via stepwise thermal treatment was reported, which photocatalyzed gaseous styrene (35 ± 1 ppmv) under dynamic conditions with a flow rate of 60 mL min−1 (air) to produce CO2 and H2O with a degradation efficiency of 62.4% and a mineralization rate of 51.9% within 240 min under ambient conditions with visible light (>420 nm) irradiation.173 The proposed mechanism involved the generation of active radical oxygen species of ˙OH and ˙O2−, which oxidized styrene to CO2 and H2O (Fig. 5c). Under similar dynamic conditions, TiO2@ UiO-66-NH2, which was constructed from ZrCl4 and BDC-NH2 with encapsulated TiO2 NPs, photocatalyzed gaseous styrene (30 ± 1 ppmv) under dynamic conditions with a flow rate of 35 mL min−1 (air) to CO2 and H2O due to the powerful oxidation capability of photogenerated holes under visible light (>420 nm) irradiation.174 Intriguingly, a heterostructural MOF-on-MOF core–shell-like hybrid material, UiO-66-NH2@MIL-101(Fe) (constructed from FeCl3·6H2O and H2BDC, forming MIL-101(Fe), which grew on the surface of UiO-66-NH2) transformed styrene into benzaldehyde under ambient conditions with visible light (>420 nm) irradiation.66 The active radical oxygen species of ˙O2− and photogenerated holes oxidized styrene to benzaldehyde (Fig. 5d).


3.4.3 Photocatalytic removal of other gaseous pollutants. 
A multifunctional material Ni-MOF/NF prepared by Ni foam, sodium formate, and 2-methylimidazole was reported to photocatalyze gaseous ethyl acetate (70 ppmv), in dynamic conditions with a flow rate of 35 mL min−1 (air), to CO2 and H2O, which exhibited a removal efficiency of 96.7% within 35 min at 30 ± 0.5 °C under visible light (>420 nm) irradiation (Fig. 6a).175 The proposed mechanism involved the generation of active radical oxygen species of ˙OH and ˙O2−, which together with photogenerated holes oxidized ethyl acetate to CO2 and H2O. More importantly, the multifunctional Ni-MOF/NF also showed removal abilities for n-butanol and toluene, respectively.

Gaseous nitric oxide (NO) was converted into the less harmful NO2−/NO3− species by MOFs and MOF hybrids. For instance, a multifunctional material GO/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) prepared by graphene oxide (GO), Ti(OiPr)4 and BDC-NH2 was reported to photocatalyze gaseous NO (500 ppmv) in dynamic conditions with a flow rate of 4 L min−1 (air) in the presence of water vapor (70% RH) to NO3−, which showed a removal efficiency about 50% within 30 min at ambient temperature under visible light (>420 nm) irradiation (Fig. 6b).171 Active radical oxygen species of ˙OH and ˙O2− with holes induced by light irradiation oxidized NO to NO3−. A hybrid photocatalyst Ti MOF/g-C3N4 constructed from Ti(OnBu)4 and BDC-NH2 with carbon vacancy g-C3N4 was reported to exhibit a NO removal efficiency of 63.4%.68 The proposed mechanism involved the participation of electrons, holes, H2O2, ˙OH and ˙O2− under xenon lamp irradiation to produce NO3−. Gaseous NO has also been photocatalyzed by pristine MOFs such as Zr MOFs176 and defective Ti MOFs.177

3.5 Photodegradation of aqueous organic and inorganic pollutants
The removal of toxic organic and inorganic pollutants in wastewater is in high demand because water contamination leads to environmental problems and health issues.178–180 Therefore, various kinds of techniques, including photocatalysis with the merits of sustainability and efficiency have been extensively explored, and have demonstrated potential for the photodegradation of dyes, antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, phenols, formaldehyde, and Cr(VI) using MOF-based photocatalysts in aqueous conditions.

3.5.1 Photodegradation of dyes. 
Photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) (Scheme 4) is one of the major concerns in wastewater treatment.72,107,181–186 For instance, a pristine MOF {[Cu(tpt)]·3H2O·0.5SO4}n constructed from CuSO4·5H2O and 2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt) demonstrated aqueous RhB (20.0 mg L−1) degradation in the presence of 30% H2O2 at room temperature under visible light LED irradiation, with a degradation efficiency of 77% and a rate constant of 2.10 × 10−2 min−1 within 70 min involving the generation of active species of ˙OH.72 In another case, SNNU-110 constructed from In(NO3)3·xH2O and 4,4′,4′′-s-triazine-1,3,5-triyltri-p-aminobenzoic acid showed a degradation efficiency of 94.6% for aqueous sulforhodamine B within 70 min at ambient temperature under xenon lamp irradiation.181 Pristine MOFs such as {[Zn7(NDC)5.5(μ4-OH)3·7DMF]}n constructed from Zn(NO3)2·4H2O and 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (H2NDC) (DMF = dimethylformamide) and a Co MOF constructed from Co(NO3)2·6H2O and mixed organic linkers were also reported to show the photodegradation of RhB in aqueous solution under UV light irradiation.107,183 Moreover, hybrid carbon-doped ZnO composites derived from MOF-5 showed RhB (1 mg L−1) degradation with a rate constant of 1.57 × 10−2 min−1 within 210 min at 25 °C under visible light (420–780 nm) irradiation, which involved the generation of active species of ˙O2−.182
 Scheme 4  Representative organic dyes. 
The photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) (Scheme 4) is another concern in wastewater treatment.187–192 For instance, a pristine Cu MOF [Cu(4,4′-bipy)Cl]n constructed from CuCl2·H2O and 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-bipy) was reported to photodegrade MB (10.0 ppm) in the presence of H2O2 with a rate constant of 1.82 × 10−2 min−1 and degradation efficiency of 93.93% within 150 min at room temperature under visible light (>420 nm) irradiation. Active species of ˙OH radicals and photogenerated holes were responsible for the photodegradation.187 In another case, Zr-Fc MOF that was constructed from ZrCl4 and 1,1′-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid was reported to photodegrade MB (10 mg L−1, pH = 7) in the presence of H2O2 with a rate constant of 1.07 × 10−1 min−1 and efficiency above 99% within 35 min under 1 sun (AM 1.5G, 1 kW m−2) irradiation, which involved the generation of active species of ˙OH radicals.191 Hybrid MOF materials, such as that involving the encapsulation of polydopamine NPs in UiO-66, constructed from ZrCl4 and H2BDC, and a chitin-functionalized Fe MOF that was constructed from FeCl3·6H2O and NH2-BDC, have also been reported to photodegrade MB dye with efficiencies of around 99% and 70% under visible light irradiation, respectively.188,190 Furthermore, ZnO/carbon nanocomposites prepared by the carbonization of MOF-5 in the presence of water vapor showed MB (20 ppm) photodegradation with an efficiency of 94% within 180 min under visible light (>420 nm) irradiation.189 By lowering energy band gaps through controlling the morphology and size of carbon-doped ZnO composites, stronger light absorption abilities and greater efficiencies were expected.
The strategy of using mixed organic linkers to form photocatalysts, such as a Co MOF constructed from Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 5-fluorine-3-(3,5-dicarboxylphenoxy)benzoic acid, 1,1′-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole) and a Zn MOF constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 1,3-bis(2-methylimidazolyl)propane, H3BTC for the photodegradation of methyl violet (MV) (Scheme 4), was investigated.73,193 Methyl violet dye in aqueous solution (10 mg L−1) was photodegraded with rate constants of 1.798 × 10−2 min−1 (by Co MOF) and 2.003 × 10−2 min−1 (by Zn MOF) within 40 min under UV light (365 nm) irradiation, which involved the generation of active species of ˙O2− radicals. Meanwhile, the aforementioned multifunctional MOFs107,183,185 were also reported to photodegrade the MV dye under UV light irradiation involving the generation of active species of ˙OH radicals.
The photodegradation of other organic dyes (Scheme 4) was reported as well. Crystal violet (CV) and basic red 2 were photodegraded by a hybrid Cd MOF that was constructed from CdI2, Na3PMo12O40, and 1,3,5-tris(4-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)phenyl)benzene, which showed that dyes (2.0 × 10−5 mol L−1) in the presence of H2O2 were photodegraded with efficiencies of 94.3% for CV within 36 min and 95.0% for basic red 2 within 18 min under UV-vis light (<800 nm) irradiation.194 Intriguingly, a phthalocyanine dye, reactive blue 21, was photodegraded by a hybrid composite. The encapsulation of three azo-based dyes, including C. I. Bright Red 14, C. I. Bright Yellow 24 (Scheme 4) and MB into an In MOF constructed from In(NO3)3·5H2O and 5′-(5-carboxy-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[1,1′:3′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-dicarboxylic acid was reported to show a degradation efficiency of 95.36% within 8 h under visible light irradiation.195 In addition, MOF-based photocatalysts were also reported to degrade organic dyes like metanil yellow (MY), methyl orange (MO), direct red 23, basic blue 41, malachite green (MG), Congo red (CR), and AB 92 under visible light irradiation.72,185,190,192,196


3.5.2 Photodegradation of antibiotics. 
Antibiotics represent another threat in contaminated water although originally used for humans and animals as medical treatments.197,198 Tetracycline (TC) is one of the widely used antibiotics that has been intensively investigated for photodegradation (Scheme 5). The strategy of utilizing pristine MOFs under visible light irradiation has recently achieved impressive results.69,71,95,199–201 For instance, a Cu MOF constructed from Cu(NO3)2·2H2O and 1,3,5-tris(imidazol-1-yl-methyl)benzene with a mechanism involving ˙O2−;199 an Fe MOF constructed from FeCl3·6H2O and H2BDC with a mechanism involving photogenerated holes, ˙OH, and ˙O2−;95 an Fe MOF constructed from FeCl3·6H2O and fumaric acid with a mechanism involving ˙O2− and ˙SO4− radicals;69 and a bimetallic CoZr MOF constructed from mixed metal salts of ZrCl4 and CoCl2·6H2O and an organic linker of H2BDC with a mechanism involving ˙OH, and ˙O2−200 have been reported. Photodegradation efficiencies of 93.21% with a rate constant of 2.117 × 10−1 L mg−1 min−1 within 1 h (30 mg L−1 TC alkaline solution, >420 nm), 96.6% with a rate constant of 1.63 × 10−2 min−1 within 3 h (50 mg L−1 TC solution, >420 nm), 99.8% with a rate constant of 3.96 × 10−2 min−1 in the presence of sodium persulfate within 80 min (200 mg L−1 TC-HCl solution, >420 nm), and 78.5% within 1 h (20 mg L−1 TC solution, xenon lamp full range) were obtained, respectively.69,95,199,200
 Scheme 5  Representative antibiotics. 
Hybrid MOFs have also been reported to photodegrade TC.202–205 For instance, a hybrid material CuBi2O4@ZIF-8 prepared by growing ZIF-8 on the surface of CuBi2O4via an in situ method showed a photodegradation efficiency of 75.2% within 2 h (20 mg L−1 TC solution, >400 nm).206 The p-type semiconducting CuBi2O4 having intrinsic catalytic properties under visible light irradiation was integrated with ZIF-8 for strong TC adsorption to show impressive degradation efficiencies. The integration of TiO2 with Zr MOF,207 Cr MOF,208 and Fe MOF209 has also been reported to photodegrade TC. For instance, TiO2@UiO-66-NH2 prepared by growing UiO-66-NH2 on the surface of TiO2via an in situ method showed TC photodegradation with a mechanism involving photogenerated holes as the dominant active species.207 In addition, the integration of either Ag3PO4 or In2S3 with MIL-100(Fe), which was supported by H3BTC, was reported to efficiently photodegrade TC.210,211 Furthermore, MOF derivatives were also obtained through heat treatment to photodegrade TC with impressive performances.70,198,212–214
Other antibiotics such as doxycycline hydrochloride,215 chlortetracycline,216 ciprofloxacin,217 norfloxacin,218 amoxicillin,219 sulfamerazine,220,221 sulfamethoxazole,222 sulfamethazine,223 sulfadimidine,224 and sulfameter225 were also reported to be photodegraded by MOF-based materials (Scheme 5). For instance, a defective MIL-101-NH2(Fe) constructed from FeCl3·6H2O and BDC-NH2 with the template molecule sulfadimidine (SM2) for the creation of target recognition defects was reported to show SM2 (20 mg L−1) photodegradation, which showed an efficiency of around 64% with a rate constant of 2.27 × 10−1 min−1 in the presence of H2O2 within 10 min under visible light irradiation.224 The introduction of target template molecules to form suitable-sized cavities and defects contributed to the improvement of the photodegradation efficiency and selectivity. A hybrid material, AgFeO2/graphene@Cu2(BTC)3, was prepared by the integration of AgFeO2 NPs and graphene with Cu2(BTC)3 that was constructed from Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and H3BTC, was reported to show photodegradation efficiencies of 92.9% for amoxicillin (AMC) (5 mg L−1) and 91.4% for diclofenac (DCF) (5 mg L−1) within 150 min under visible light irradiation (420–600 nm).219 The tertiary heterojunction material displayed an appropriate band gap and resulted in a smooth charge flow from Cu2(BTC)3 to AgFeO2 mediated by graphene. Moreover, a hybrid material BiOBr/UiO-66-NH2 prepared by the integration of BiOBr nanoplates with UiO-66-NH2 was reported to show a photodegradation efficiency of 93.60% for norfloxacin (NOR) (10 mg L−1) within 3 h under simulated sunlight irradiation.218 The aforementioned carbon fibers/TiO2/MIL-101(Fe) and g-C3N4@CoFe2O4/Fe2O3 were reported to photodegrade 17β-estradiol (E2), diclofenac sodium (DFC), and ofloxacin (OFX) (Scheme 5).70,209


3.5.3 Photodegradation of pesticides and herbicides. 
Pesticides and herbicides are widely used to improve crop production but cause serious environmental and health issues.74 Significant effort has been put into photodegrading such toxic molecules (Scheme 6). For instance, a Ag MOF constructed from AgNO3 and p-hydroxybenzoic acid was reported to show photodegradation efficiencies of 96.0% for 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4.5 mg L−1) and 98.0% for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (4.5 mg L−1) within 20 min under sunlight irradiation.226 In another case, MIL-101(Fe) was reported to show a photodegradation efficiency of around 90% for tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (3.51 μM) in the presence of H2O2 within 1 h under 420 nm LED irradiation.227 The proposed mechanism involved ˙OH radical species, which oxidized tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate to more than ten degradation products through pathways of cleavage and hydroxylation, etc. Remarkably, a versatile porphyrinic MOF constructed from ZrOCl2·8H2O and H2TCPP was reported to show the respective photodegradation of nitenpyram (10 μg mL−1, 95%), thifluzamide (10 μg mL−1, 82.3%), isoproturon (10 μg mL−1, 67.4%), and atrazine (10 μg mL−1, 76.2%) within 20 min under 660 nm laser irradiation.104 A hybrid material was obtained via the integration of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a Zr MOF that was constructed from ZrOCl2·8H2O and H3BTC, and was reported to show a photodegradation efficiency of 99.7% for diazinon (50 mg L−1) within 1 h under metal-halide lamp irradiation.228 The introduction of CNTs improved the photodegradation efficiency owing to the enhancement of light harvesting, adsorption, and conductivity in addition to playing the role of electron acceptor.
 Scheme 6  Representative pesticides and herbicides. 


3.5.4 Photodegradation of phenols and HCHO. 
Formaldehyde and phenols in aqueous solutions are of concern regarding the environment and ecosystems, and MOF-based materials as photocatalysts have been reported as promising techniques for addressing these issues.101,229–232 For instance, a pristine MOF MIL-100(Fe) constructed from Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and H3BTC in the presence of H2O2 was reported to show the photodegradation of formaldehyde (700 mg L−1, 93%) within 2 h under visible light irradiation.230 The initial concentration of formaldehyde was heavily related to the photodegradation efficiency of MIL-100(Fe) with a proposed mechanism involving ˙OH to convert formaldehyde into formate acid and then to CO2 and H2O via holes. In addition, a nanofibrous membrane PAA-PVA/PW12@UiO prepared by the integration of polyacrylic acid (PAA)-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers, phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40 (PW12), and UiO-66 was reported to show the photodegradation of formaldehyde during the process of photodegradation of methyl orange under high-pressure mercury lamp irradiation.101 The proposed mechanism involves the coincidence of the oxidation of formaldehyde and the reduction of methyl orange via electron transfer from formaldehyde to methyl orange mediated by PAA-PVA/PW12@UiO.
Phenol and the corresponding derivatives (Scheme 7) have been widely investigated for photodegradation.231–238 For instance, Ag3PO4@UMONs was prepared by the integration of Ag3PO4 and UMONs (constructed from mixed metal salts of NiCl2·6H2O and CoCl2·6H2O and H2BDC) and exhibited phenol degradation (40 mg L−1, 100%) within 16 min under visible light irradiation (>420 nm).231 A core–shell structure with Ag3PO4 inside bimetallic UMONs showed synergistic effects for boosting charge transfer and good separation for improved performance as compared to Ag3PO4. Hybrid MOF materials such as HOQ@MOF-5 prepared by the integration of 8-hydroxyquinoline (HOQ) with MOF-5, and phosphorus-doped carbon/Cu2O composite HKUST-1-P-300 prepared by the calcination of a Cu MOF that was constructed from Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, triphenylphosphine and H3BTC, were reported to photodegrade phenol with efficiencies of 91% within 40 min and 99.8% within 90 min under visible light irradiation, respectively.234,235 Photodegradation of phenol by HKUST-1-P-300 involved a dominant role of ˙O2− and an inferior role of holes. It is also worth mentioning that a pristine Cu MOF constructed from Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, H2BDC and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane was reported to transform phenols into diaryl ethers under 365 nm UV light irradiation.236
 Scheme 7  Representative phenolic compounds or phenols. 
Bisphenol A (40 mg L−1, 98.9%) was photodegraded by the aforementioned Ag3PO4@UMONs within 20 min under visible light irradiation (>420 nm).231 Moreover, phenol red (0.11 mg L−1) was photodegraded with an efficiency of 99% within 11 min under UV light irradiation by a pristine U MOF that was constructed from uranyl acetate UO2(CH3COO)2 and curcumin.232 Both ˙O2− and ˙OH were proposed for the degradation of phenol red. Furthermore, both 2,4-dichlorophenol (10 mg L−1, 94% within 90 min) and 4-bromophenol (10 mg L−1, 97% within 1 h) were photodegraded under visible light irradiation by TiO2/Au/Fe2O3, which was prepared by heat treatment of hybrid composites of HAuCl4 and a bimetallic TiFe MOF that was constructed from mixed metal salts of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Ti(OnBu)4 and H2BDC.233 Photodegradation efficiencies of 2,4-dichlorophenol and 4-bromophenol were higher than TiO2/Fe2O3 because of the more efficient separation of electrons and holes after the introduction of Au. Both ˙O2− and ˙OH radical species have been proposed to contribute to degradation.


3.5.5 Photoreduction of Cr(VI). 
Pristine MOFs100,239–242 and hybrid MOFs110,243–247 have been reported to show the photoreduction of the highly toxic Cr(VI), a human carcinogen, and the low- or non-toxic Cr(III).
For instance, an Fe MOF, constructed from FeCl3·6H2O and the mixed organic linkers of 2,5-bis(methylthio)terephthalic acid and 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine, was reported to photoreduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) with a percentage of 99.6% and a rate constant of 0.0546 min−1 (pH = 1) under visible light irradiation (>420 nm) (Fig. 7a).100 Both the pH and protonation of Fe MOF were beneficial for the adsorption of Cr2O72−. The improvement of light absorption and electron density at iron sites by the functional group –SCH3 along with enhanced charge carrier separation and migration using 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine contributed to Cr(VI) photoreduction. A Zr MOF constructed from ZrOCl2·8H2O and BDC-NH2 was treated with Cp2TiCl2 to form a bimetallic ZrTi MOF for Cr(VI) photoreduction.240 The presence of rich defects in the prepared ZrTi MOF with more exposed amino groups contributed to the enhancement of the Cr(VI) removal ability.

NH2-MIL-125(Ti) was hybridized with plasmonic Au to photoreduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) at a pH of around 5.3 with a percentage of >99% under visible light irradiation (>490 nm).110 Amino groups of organic linkers facilitated plasmonic activity including hot electrons/holes on Au, which improved charge carrier separation to show the efficient photoreduction of Cr(VI). An Fe MOF constructed from FeCl3·6H2O and BDC-NH2 was hybridized with (3-chloropropyl)trimethoxy silane-functionalized sand through covalent bonds to achieve the photoreduction of Cr(VI) with 98.8% (pH = 2) under visible light irradiation (Fig. 7b).245 The resultant hybrid material showed a core–shell structure with MOFs decorated on the sand. Integration of sand was designed to prepare cost-effective photocatalysts while maintaining efficient Cr(VI) removal in an aqueous state.

3.6 Photocatalytic organic syntheses
Various types of organic transformations have been investigated by using MOF-based photocatalysts (Scheme 8). Organic syntheses with selectivity for oxidation/reduction/cycloaddition reactions using photocatalysts are appealing.46,248,249 These photocatalytic organic transformations include but are not limited to the oxidation of alcohols,250,251 oxidation of amines,75,252–256 oxidation of sulfides,76,257–260 reduction of nitroarenes,261–263 C–C/C–N/C–halogen couplings,78,251,256,259,264,265 cycloaddition,77 decarboxylative radical cyanation,266 and debromination.267

For instance, a Cr MOF photocatalyst Cr-PCN-600 that was constructed from Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and H2TCPP was reported to oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, which exhibited a conversion of 98% and selectivity above 99% in the presence of O2 (1 atm) at 32 °C (±3) under visible light LED irradiation (Scheme 8a).250 The proposed mechanism involved active species ˙O2− and 1O2 for oxidation due to the utilization of the photosensitizer linker H2TCPP.
Benzylamine and derivatives were oxidized to imines in the presence of O2 (0.1 MPa) at 60 °C by a Zn MOF photocatalyst ZJU-56-0.2 that was constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and mixed organic linkers of 2,5-bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-1-methylpyridinium hydroxide and bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)pyridine under 660 nm LED irradiation (Scheme 8b).252 The proposed mechanism involved the active species 1O2 for oxidation. Similar amine oxidation reactions were also investigated by using a Cd MOF constructed from Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylate75 and a hybrid Ti MOF constructed from Ti(OiPr)4 and H2BDC, with the encapsulation of the photosensitizer Ru(bpy)3Cl2 to show selectivity above 99% in the presence of O2 (from the air) at room temperature under visible light irradiation (Scheme 8b).253 ZJU-56-0.2 was also able to perform C–C oxidative coupling reactions through photoinduced electron transfer between N-phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline and nitromethane (Scheme 8c). Intriguingly, a two-photon absorption mechanism under LED irradiation was proposed for C–N and C–C photocatalytic reactions in contrast to single-electron transfer that was commonly observed in conventional photocatalysis.
Reactions of methylphenyl sulfide and derivatives to the corresponding sulfoxides were reported for bimetallic IrZr MOFs constructed from ZrCl4 and [Ir(pqc)2L]Cl (pqc = 2-phenyl-quinoline-4-carboxylic acid, L = 1,10-phenanthroline, etc.) in the presence of O2 (1 atm) at room temperature under blue light LED irradiation (460 nm), which involved the generation of reactive oxygen species of ˙O2− (Scheme 8d).257 Also, a hybrid Zr MOF that was constructed by the integration of ZrCl4 and H2TCPP with polyethylene glycol, DNA, and silver ions successfully converted 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide to 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide in the presence of O2 (1 atm) under blue light LED irradiation (450 nm), which involved the generation of reactive oxygen species of 1O2.76
Photocatalytic reactions of benzyl alcohol and derivatives with 2-aminobenzamide forming quinazolin-4(3H)-ones were reported for Fe@PCN-222(Fe) that was constructed from FeCl3, ZrCl4 and Fe(TCPP)Cl in the presence of O2 (1 atm) at 40 ± 2 °C under visible light irradiation, which involved the generation of reactive oxygen species of ˙O2− (Scheme 8e).264 A hybrid Zn MOF/POM constructed from Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, K8[β2-SiW11O39]·14H2O and 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine in the presence of N2H4·H2O efficiently and selectively converted nitrobenzene to aniline (99%) upon 365 nm LED irradiation at room temperature (Scheme 8f).261 The obtained results were attributed to zinc-substituted [SiZnW11O39]6− in connection with POMs and organic linkers for the accumulation of photogenerated electrons, which suppressed the recombination rates of electron–hole pairs and improved the separation efficiency. Besides, a Cu MOF constructed from CuI and (4,4′,4′′-(2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tripyridine) was reported to show decarboxylative cyanation in the presence of trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) upon 395 nm LED irradiation (Scheme 8g).266 A proposed mechanism involved radical reactions through the synergy of photocatalysis and copper catalysis. In addition, the debromination of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 209) to lower BDEs like tetra-BDEs and penta-BDEs, etc. was catalyzed by NH2-MIL-125(Ti) in the presence of TEOA at 25 ± 0.1 °C under visible light irradiation (>420 nm), which involved the generation of active species of Ti3+ in the forms of coordination to TEOA or the corresponding oxidized intermediates (Scheme 8h).267
4. Photovoltaics based on MOFs
Solar energy represents a sustainable, clean, and renewable technique that stimulates the exploration of efficient, eco-friendly, and low-cost materials for sunlight utilization. Thus, photovoltaic cells including (1) PSVs;268–272 (2) DSSCs;273 (3) MSSCs;274,275 (4) OPVs;271,276 and (5) QDSCs277,278 have been intensively investigated. MOFs as versatile functional porous materials play multiple roles in solar cells (Scheme 9). The manipulation of electronic structures of MOFs to appropriate band gaps suitable for solar light absorption is vital for the design and fabrication of high-performance photovoltaic cells. Consequently, the electronic properties of MOFs have been studied theoretically and experimentally.279–282
 Scheme 9  Categories of MOF-based materials applied in solar cells. 
4.1 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
Typically, PSCs consist of perovskite active layers, electron transport layers (ETLs), hole transport layers (HTLs), and blocking layers or interfacial layers in advanced devices besides transparent/back electrodes.271,283 Accordingly, efforts to enhance the performances of PSCs were mainly focused on the aforementioned aspects with available diverse device construction strategies (i.e., n–i–p configuration and inverted p–i–n configuration).284–287 MOFs were explored in PSCs, showing impressive performances as additives to ETL, HTL, perovskite active layers or interfacial layers. For instance, nanocrystalline MIL-125 (Ti) constructed from Ti(OnBu)4 and H2BDC was hybridized with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBM) as the ETL in a conventional n–i–p planar PSC, which showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.94% in a rigid device, while a PCE of 17.43% was obtained for a flexible device (Fig. 8a and b).79 The prepared MIL-125 (Ti)/PCBM material exhibited efficient electron transfer owing to the utilization of MIL-125(Ti) with its intrinsic electronic structure for injection and transfer.

Reproduced with permission.285 Copyright 2020, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press and Springer. 
MOFs as interlayers were also studied in PSCs. A ZIF-8 interlayer between mesoporous TiO2 and the perovskite showing a PCE of 16.99%,288 an Eu MOF interlayer constructed from Eu(NO3)3·6H2O and oxalic acid H2C2O4·2H2O between ITO and the perovskite showing a PCE of 22.16%,289 a Zr MOF interlayer constructed from ZrOCl2·8H2O and 1,3,5-tris(3′,5′-bimercapto-4′-carboxyphenyl)benzene between phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester and the Ag electrode showing a PCE of 20.34% or a PCE of 22.02% when using a hybrid interlayer Zr MOF/bis-C60 surfactant,284 an UiO-66 interlayer between NiOx and the perovskite showing a PCE of 17.01%,287 and a Zn MOF constructed from ZnSO4·7H2O and oxalic acid between 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate (Li-TFSI) and the perovskite showing a PCE of 21.15%,290 were reported.
Pristine MOFs as additives doped into HTLs80,283,286,291 and hybrid MOFs doped into HTLs82,102,292,293 were reported to show enhanced performances for PSCs. For instance, In MOFs constructed from InCl3 and quinoline-3-dicarboxylic acid or InCl3 and 5-(pyridin-4-ylmethoxy)isophthalic acid were incorporated into Spiro-OMeTAD to show PCEs of 17.0% for the former and 19.47 ± 0.79% for the latter.80,283 Besides, a hybrid Cu MOF material H3PMo12O40@Cu BTC constructed from Cu(CH3CO2)2·H2O and H3BTC with the encapsulation of H3PMo12O40·nH2O was reported as a dopant in HTL, showing a PCE of 21.44% (Fig. 8c and d).102 Compared to the pristine Cu MOF-doped HTL, the hybrid H3PMo12O40@Cu BTC-doped HTL improved the PCE and stability of PSCs due to the oxidation ability of H3PMo12O40 in addition to the solid form of the nanoparticles. In another case, a hybrid In MOF material [(CH3)2NH2]+@In MOF constructed from In(NO3)3·xH2O and 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(1,4-phenylenbis(pyridine-4,2,6-triyl))-tetrabenzoic acid with the encapsulation of [(CH3)2NH2]+ cations was reported as a dopant in HTL, showing a PCE of 20.34%.292 The [(CH3)2NH2]+ cations were intended to passivate perovskite defects, and the negatively charged In MOF was beneficial for the improvement of hole transfer. Importantly, a semi-conductive Ni MOF constructed from NiCl2·6H2O and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaaminotriphenylene hexahydrochloride without guest species as HTLs in inverted planar PSCs was reported to exhibit a PCE of 10.3%.294 The Ni MOF material showed a hole mobility of 48.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 to effectively facilitate hole transport from the perovskite to the anode.
MOFs have also been applied as additives to perovskites as active layers.81,287,295–298 For instance, a PCE of 18.01% was obtained when UiO-66 was added to a perovskite active layer.287 A microporous In MOF constructed from In(NO3)3·5H2O and H3BTC was hybridized with perovskite as a light-harvesting layer showing a PCE of 20.87% in an n–i–p PSC (Fig. 8e and f).285 After the introduction of In MOF into the perovskite, the morphology, crystallinity, grain boundaries, and defects were modified, leading to enhanced performances as compared to devices without In MOFs. Another case involved doping Zn MOF constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 1-[4-carboxybenzyl]-3-[pyrzin-2-yl]pyrazole (Hcbpp) into perovskites to be active layers, which showed a PCE of 21.28%, due to diminished pinholes and cracks by employing such a 2D Zn MOF with fairly strong interactions among perovskite grains.295 A Zn MOF constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 1-(triazol-1-ly)-4-tetrazol-5-ylmethylbenzene in perovskite precursor solutions was reported to exhibit a PCE of 23.14%.81 A macromolecular intermediate phase was formed along the Zn MOF structure, which improved the stability in contrast to physically mixing MOFs with perovskites.
It is noteworthy that MOF derivatives obtained through the pyrolysis of corresponding MOFs is another strategy. Similarly, the obtained MOF derivatives were intensively explored as ETLs, interlayers, hole buffer layers, and additives to perovskites for PSCs.299–304
4.2 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
A typical DSSC usually contains a photoanode with dye molecules loaded, a redox electrolyte (e.g., I−/I3− species), and a counter electrode (CE).84,282,305 Intensive investigations have been focused on the exploration of novel photoanodes, CEs and improved electrolytes.83,103,306–309 MOF-based materials for DSSCs have been attracting increasing attention. For instance, a Co MOF constructed from Co(NO3)2·6H2O and H3BTC deposited on a N3 dye-coated TiO2/FTO as the photoanode in a DSSC was reported to exhibit a PCE of 8.35%.103 The Co MOF layer inhibited photo-induced electron recombination, thus increasing its lifetime, which led to a PCE enhancement by 20% in contrast to a photoanode without Co MOF under the same conditions. Using either ZIF-8 or UiO-66 with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) doped into TiO2 to be coated onto indoline dye/FTO glass substrates as photoanodes reportedly showed PCEs of 7.33% for the former and 7.67% for the latter.310 Also, a Ni MOF constructed from Ni(CH3CO2)2·4H2O and H3BTC was doped into TiO2 coated on FTO glass substrates to load N719 dye molecules as the photoanode and showed a PCE of 8.846%.311 The introduction of Ni MOF into TiO2 decreased the interfacial charge transfer resistance and rates of charge carrier recombination but increased electron transport. A Zn-perylene SURMOF constructed from Zn(CH3CO2)2 and 3,9-perylene dicarboxylic acid with TiO2 was coated onto FTO glass substrates to load pyridine-functionalized BODIPY dye/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as the photoanode, which was coupled with a redox mediator Co(bpy)32+/3+ instead of I−/I3− species to show enhanced photocurrent (∼1.25 μA cm−2) as compared to the TiO2 photoanode (∼0.1 μA cm−2) under a 532 nm green light irradiation (Fig. 9a and b).312

(e) J–V curves of Zn-TCPP-Pt under light irradiation from front or rear side. Reproduced with permission.84 Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society. 
MOFs applied as CEs in DSSCs have also received much attention. For instance, a Cu MOF constructed from Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O and 6,6′-dithiodinicotinic acid (H2dtdn) was electrodeposited onto FTO glass substrates with the assistance of a conductive binder poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), forming a composite Cu MOF/PEDOT counter electrode, which showed a PCE of 8.26% or a PCE of 9.45% when using a carbon cloth substrate instead of an FTO substrate at 1 sun irradiation (Fig. 9c).313 The intrinsic conductive Cu MOF showed improvement in film adhesion, electron transfer, and redox mediator diffusion in addition to the merits of rich active sites with lower energy barriers. Pt atom-doped SURMOF Zn-TCPP-Pt, which was constructed from Zn(CH3CO2)2, H2TCPP, and K2PtCl4 deposited onto FTO glass substrates as CEs in bifacial DSSCs showed a PCE of 5.48% (front side irradiation) and a PCE of 4.88% (rear side irradiation) (Fig. 9d and e).84 Compared to Pt CE, the prepared Zn-TCPP-Pt CE displayed higher visible light transmission and less Pt utilization without decreasing the catalytic activity due to the virtues of the photoelectric effect by the 2D conductive Zn-TCPP.
The carbonization of MOFs mixed with additional species for application as CEs in DSSCs was also extensively studied. In particular, MOF derivatives of the porous material ZIF-67 were heavily exploited.306,314–320 Other MOF derivatives, utilizing a Cu MOF constructed from Cu(CH3CO2)2 and H2TCPP,321 or a Co MOF constructed from Co(CH3CO2)2 and H2TCPP,307 or a Zn MOF constructed from Zn(CH3CO2)2·2H2O and H3BTC,322 or a bimetallic NiCo MOF constructed from mixed metal salts of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O with H3BTC,323 were reported to be CEs in DSSCs. Moreover, mesoporous TiO2 derived from the coating of MIL-125(Ti) onto FTO glass substrates with ruthenium sensitizers as photoanodes in DSSCs was reported to show a PCE of 7.45% in a solid state DSSC and a PCE of 8.43% when using liquid electrolytes, respectively.324
4.3 MOF-sensitized solar cells (MSSCs)
MSSCs share a similar architecture to DSSCs with the substitution of dyes by MOFs as sensitizers.274 MOFs have been applied as photoanodes,274,275,325–327 and photoactive layers328 in MSSCs. For instance, a Zn MOF constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and mixed organic linkers of H2TCPP and 2,2′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridine (DMBPY) was grown on a ZnO-decorated FTO glass substrate as a photoanode in liquid-junction MSSCs, which showed a PCE of 0.86% under AM 1.5G illumination due to efficient charge separation and charge transfer besides charge injection (Fig. 10a).274 A Ru MOF constructed from RuCl3·xH2O and H3BTC was integrated with ZnO and β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs and applied as a photoanode in MSSCs.326 Doping upconverting NPs contributed to the enhancement of photocurrent and PCE (8.6%) due to a broader spectrum of light absorption up to the near-infrared region in contrast to the Ru MOF/ZnO electrode. The Ru MOF/TiO2 photoanode coupled with the Pt-coated FTO counter electrode in the presence of I3−/I− redox electrolyte under 1 sun irradiation was reported to show a PCE of 0.42%.327

It is worth mentioning that a Zr MOF constructed from ZrCl4 and 3-hydroxy-2-[7-(4-carboxy-2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,6,8-tetraoxo-3,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[Imn][3,8]phenanthrolin-2-yl]benzoic acid was coated on p-type semiconductors (Si or GaP) with TiO2 as photocathodes for potential application in MOF-based photoelectrosynthesis, which showed the enhancement of photovoltage in the presence of the redox mediator tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(III) tris(hexafluorophosphate) under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 10b).108 The introduction of Zr MOF improved charge separation and enhanced the photocurrent (>300%) in contrast to organic linker-modified photocathodes. Moreover, a 2D conductive Ni MOF (1.1 × 10−3 S cm−1) constructed from Ni(CH3CO2)2 and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) as a photoactive layer in a solid-state ITO/Ni MOF/Al solar cell was reported to show a short circuit current of 8.76 × 10−4 mA cm−2 and open circuit voltage of 156 mV under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 10c and d).328 It is appealing to employ the prepared Ni MOF to facilitate photoactive reactions in MSSCs due to the existence of appropriate band gaps and long enough excited states. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that advanced device architectures are required to further evaluate PCE, charge carrier transfer, separation efficiency, stability, and so on.
4.4 Organic solar cells (OSCs)
OSCs consist of architecture similar to that of PSCs with the substitution of perovskite active layers by organic active layers.271 Unfortunately, organic photovoltaics (OPV) suffer from instability and low PCEs. Advanced materials along with newly designed device architectures have been reported to improve the performances of OSCs.85,86,329 For instance, a 2D Zn MOF constructed from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and H2TCPP was doped into a photoactive layer containing poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)(P3HT) and PCBM to show a PCE of 5.2% in an OSC under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 11a).85 The introduction of Zn MOF nanosheets with monolayer thickness enabled high doping concentrations, which were capable of harvesting a wider range of solar irradiation as compared to the binary photoactive layer P3HT/PCBM. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of 2D Zn MOF was aligned between P3HT and PCBM, which was beneficial for energy flow.

A Cd MOF constructed from Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and tellerophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid was doped into the polymer surfactant polyethylenimine ethoxylate (PEIE) as an electron extraction layer (EEL) on ZnO/ITO to show a PCE of 3.42% in an OSC under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 11b).86 The integration of Cd MOF/PEIE with ZnO/ITO enabled energy level alignments for a smoother energy cascade than PEIE with ZnO/ITO. Furthermore, the hybridization of the semiconductive Cd MOF with insulating PEIE improved the overall electrical conductivity in addition to the inhibition of charge recombination.
4.5 Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs)
In general, QDSSCs consist of photoanodes with quantum dot sensitizers, electrolytes, and counter electrodes.277,278 Although structurally and functionally similar to DSSCs, the virtues of QD-sensitized solar cells include stronger light harvesting ability, more stable structures, lower cost, and higher theoretical conversion efficiency (up to 44%), etc.87,88,277 For instance, a porous material, ZIF-8, was coated onto ZnO/FTO loaded with CdSe/CdS QDs as the photoanode, which was coupled with the counter electrode of Cu2S in the presence of an electrolyte S2−/Sx2− to show a PCE of 1.75% (vs. 0.88% by a photoanode without ZIF-8) in a QDSSC (Fig. 12a and b).87 The introduction of ZIF-8 was helpful in inhibiting charge carrier recombination in addition to facilitating QDs and electrolyte diffusion within pores. The loading mass of QDs and charge transfer were also improved. In another case, a Zn MOF constructed from Zn(CH3CO2)2 and 5,10-bis(4′-carboxymethylphenyl)-15,20-bis(4′-pyridyl)porphyrin was hybridized with CdS/ZnS QDs coating onto TiO2/FTO as the photoanode to show a PCE of 4.62%, which involved doping graphene oxide and nitrogen into TiO2 besides doping Mn2+ into ZnS.88 Suppressed charge carrier recombination, enhanced surface area, and improved loading amount of dye were achieved after the introduction of graphene oxide and nitrogen. Furthermore, the introduction of Mn2+ was also meaningful for inhibiting recombination. Notably, the co-sensitizer Zn MOF was doped into CdS/ZnS QDs to endow photoanode with stronger light harvesting ability to the near-infrared region.

Integrating MOF derivatives with CdS/CdSe QDs as photoanodes330 and Zn–Cu–In–Se QDs as CEs331–335 has also been reported to enhance PCEs for QDSSCs.
5. Conclusions
The development of MOF-based photoelectroactive materials for applications in photocatalysis and photovoltaics is of significant interest, motivated by how to efficiently utilize solar energy to alleviate the energy crisis and protect the environment. The merits of MOFs include large surface areas, porosity, and the ability to tailor the pore size, light harvesting, and conductivity in addition to facile synthesis, etc. Moreover, the porosity of MOF derivatives, inherited from pristine MOFs by calcination, is beneficial when enhanced electrical conductivity and stability are needed. Besides, hybrid MOFs are also able to exhibit superior outcomes due to the virtues of the synergistic effect between the host MOFs and guest species. Pristine MOFs, hybrid MOFs, and MOF derivatives can be prepared stepwise. In principle, guest species with locations on the surface or outside of MOFs and partially or fully embedded in MOFs by in situ and ex situ methods can be adopted to construct four types of non-calcined MOF materials.
Photocatalysts based on MOFs are capable of boosting a series of reactions upon light irradiation. Hydrogen evolution from water using sunlight is appealing and promising for providing clean energy. Photocurrent density is paramount for improving hydrogen production efficiency, which is related to the bandgap, recombination rate of photoelectron–hole pairs, catalytic active sites, stability of photocatalysts, etc. These common features also apply to the photoreduction of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, which require high activation bond energies. Accordingly, the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of MOF-based materials by using photoelectroactive organic linkers and multivalent metal ions is beneficial, besides the encapsulation of guest species into less conductive MOFs or the calcination of MOFs. The defect engineering strategy helps provide rich active sites due to more exposed unsaturated metal centers. Tetravalent titanium and zirconium ions prefer to form fairly stable carboxylic acids-supported MOFs because of the high Lewis acidity at high oxidation states. MOF-based photocatalysts are also applied in various organic transformations with high selectivity and efficiency under mild conditions. The photodegradation of pollutants (e.g., aldehydes, aromatics, dyes, antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, phenols, and hexavalent chromium) to carbon dioxide, water, and less harmful or non-harmful species with high efficiency and good cycling life are observed as well. It is worth noting that durability, reusability, and cost-effectiveness are far from satisfied.
MOF-based photoelectroactive materials can be applied in photovoltaic cells. As additives to photoactive layers of perovskite solar cells, MOF materials can stabilize perovskites and enhance power conversion efficiency in addition to cycling life. Doping MOF materials in electron or hole transport layers can improve extraction and transport abilities. MOF materials can also be coated as blocking or interfacial layers for better performance. A similar strategy can be applied to organic solar cells with architectures that are analogous to perovskite solar cells. For dye-sensitized solar cells and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, porosity and large surface area are significant for hosting and stabilizing sensitizers, which decrease the chance of sensitizers accumulating besides enhancing the loading mass and charge transfer to improve light harvesting and power conversion efficiency. MOF-sensitized solar cells work in another way, utilizing luminescent organic linkers for light harvesting. MOF materials play important roles as electrolytes, counter electrodes, and photoanodes in sensitized solar cells. Much effort is needed to improve the power conversion efficiency and cycling life of photovoltaic cells.
