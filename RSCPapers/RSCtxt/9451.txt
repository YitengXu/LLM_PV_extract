    , Accepted 7th July 2018First published on 9th July 2018AbstractAn efficient nanocomposite anode material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) based on nickel oxide nanoparticles entrapped in a polypyrrole matrix has been readily synthesized by an all-electrochemical procedure. Examples of anodes for the OER utilizing metallic nanoparticles dispersed in an organic polymer film are still scarce but very promising for water splitting applications. Herein, nickel metal (Ni0) nanoparticles were first electrodeposited into a cationic poly(pyrrole-ammonium) film (poly1) electropolymerized onto carbon or ITO electrodes by reduction of an anionic nickel oxalate complex in aqueous borate buffer at pH 6. The Ni0 nanoparticles were then electro-oxidized into nickel oxide (NiOx) in aqueous borate buffer at pH 9.2. The physical, chemical and electrocatalytic properties of the nanostructured poly1–NiOx material were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled to various electrochemical techniques, and the results were compared with those of NiOx directly deposited on a naked electrode (without polymer) by the same electrochemical procedure. Such characterization clearly evidences the beneficial role of the poly1 matrix to generate smaller and non-agglomerated NiOx particles. Owing to the small size of NiOx nanoparticles (ca. 21 nm) and the great nanostructuration of the poly1–NiOx composite film deposited on the carbon (C) electrode surface, this material displays a very high electrocatalytic OER performance in a nearly neutral solution (pH 9.2) and even in alkaline solution (pH 14) with strong mass activities and turnover frequencies (TOFs) (1.12 A mg−1 and 0.17 s−1, respectively, at an overpotential of 0.61 V at pH 9.2, and of 1.28 A mg−1 and 0.19 s−1, respectively, at an overpotential of 0.35 V at pH 14). This performance places the C/poly1–NiOx electrode among the most active anodes based on nickel oxide reported in the literature and undoped with iron ions for the OER. In addition, when the poly1–NiOx film is deposited on a porous ITO electrode, its physisorption on the electrode surface is significantly enhanced, as shown by long-term electrocatalysis at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Indeed, its catalytic current remains constant after several days of electrocatalysis, demonstrating the great stability of the poly1–NiOx nanocomposite; the polymer matrix maintains the integrity of the NiOx nanoparticles and precludes their corrosion. This material is thus very promising for the implementation of efficient and highly stable anodes for water oxidation.
Introduction
In the actual energy context, molecular hydrogen (H2) is considered as an attractive clean energy carrier and an excellent alternative to fossil fuels. However, the challenge is to produce it on a large scale and at an attractive cost without using fossil fuels. A very promising sustainable approach is to split water into molecular oxygen (O2) and H2 using only renewable energy sources such as solar energy or clean electricity (e.g. from wind power).1–3 Water electrolysis couples the complex proton-coupled multi-electron oxidation of water to O2 at the anode (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and the subsequent reduction of the protons released to H2 at the cathode. The OER remains the bottleneck of the water splitting process due to its high activation barrier, slow electrode kinetics and large anodic overpotential.4–7 Many efforts are thus turned towards developing stable and highly active catalysts deposited on conducting electrodes for the OER that tend to lower its activation barrier. Among these, noble metal-based oxides such as RuO2 and IrO2 are known to be among the best OER catalysts in acidic and alkaline solutions due to their low overpotential and high catalytic current.8 However, these catalysts suffer from instability through corrosion under an anodic potential and contain costly and rare metals that are not compatible with large-scale H2 production. In view of their substitution, many metal oxides based on more earth abundant first row transition metals (e.g. Mn,9–19 Fe,20–25 Co26–51 and Ni52–66) have been investigated in various oxide forms such as perovskite (ABO3; A = alkaline and/or rare-earth metals, B = transition metals), spinel (; A′ = alkaline-earth and/or transition metals, B′ = group 13 elements and/or transition metals) and oxyhydroxide (M(O)(OH); M = transition metals) and have shown very promising electrocatalytic performances.5,8,67–71 Among them, the most extensively studied are nickel oxyhydroxide (Ni(O)(OH), also denoted herein as nickel oxide or NiOx) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) because of their large use in supercapacitors and electrolysis cells5 and their long-term corrosion resistance and high electrocatalytic activity towards the OER. It has been shown that the catalytic performance of NiOx can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of iron ions within the structure of the oxide, leading to a decrease of its OER overpotential of at least 200 mV.22,72–74 Another way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of NiOx and more generally of metal oxides deposited on electrodes is to control the porosity and morphology of the films and/or to decrease the size of metal oxide particles, which allow promoting electron/mass transport at the electrode surface, increasing the electroactive surface area of the electrode and thus enhancing the accessibility of catalytic sites towards the water substrate. To this end, several physical and chemical methods have already been employed to deposit nickel oxide on conducting electrodes,5,70,75 such as solvothermal, electrochemical or sol–gel deposition, in order to obtain various forms and morphologies like hollow spheres,76 microballs,59 nanoplates,76 nanosheets77 or very small nanocrystals.78
Herein, we report a very efficient anode for the water oxidation reaction based on a nickel oxide–poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium) nanocomposite (poly1–NiOx) prepared by an original and easy all-electrochemical synthesis (see Scheme S1† for the monomer 1). In contrast to the usual oxidation process employed for the electrodeposition of nickel oxide films at an electrode surface, the approach used here consists in first inducing the electroprecipitation of Ni0 nanoparticles into the poly1 film and then generating in situ NiOx by electro-oxidation of Ni0. Thus, NiOx nanoparticles are well dispersed throughout the polypyrrole matrix which confers a great nanostructuration to the composite film, a large active surface area, a high OER electrocatalytic activity and high stability under electrocatalytic conditions. Although very promising for the OER, only three examples of anodes79–81 using an organic polymer matrix to entrap small metallic oxide particles have been reported until now and one of them was published by our group using a precious metal catalyst such as iridium oxide.79 The poly1–NiOx nanocomposite material has been characterized by various electrochemical techniques, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and finally by scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The electrocatalytic properties of this material toward water oxidation under neutral and basic conditions have also been evaluated and compared with those of a NiOx film directly deposited on a naked electrode by the same electrochemical procedure. Finally, we have performed a careful comparison of the electrocatalytic OER performance of these electrodes under near neutral and basic conditions to that of some nickel-based electrodes previously reported at similar pH values.
Results and discussion
Electrosynthesis and electrocharacterization of nickel oxide and poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium)–nickel oxide nanocomposite electrode materials
Deposition of metallic oxide on electrodes, especially nickel oxide, has been performed via several physical and chemical methods5 but the simplest and the more versatile one is the electrochemical technique.75 Nickel oxide is generally electrodeposited anodically either by galvanostatic, potentiostatic or potentiodynamic (i.e. cyclic voltammetry) experiments5 from a basic aqueous solution of nickel salt or nickel complexes in the presence of borate buffer at pH 9.2. The resulting bulk NiOx films are known to be efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions with overpotentials lower than 0.47 V for a current density of 10 mA cm−2.60,82 In view of developing structured, active and stable anodes for the OER as mentioned in the Introduction, we synthesized by an all-electrochemical procedure nanocomposite electrode materials composed of NiOx particles entrapped in a poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium) thin film coated onto C or ITO electrodes (see the ESI†). This strategy, which is based on the electroprecipitation of catalyst particles into a functionalized polypyrrole film, was previously reported by Noufi,83 Yoneyama84 and also by our group with various metals and employed as electrocatalytic materials for several reactions.79,85–91
Here, the C or ITO/poly1–NiOx modified electrodes were prepared following a four-step electrochemical procedure depicted in Scheme 1. The poly1 electrodes were first easily obtained by electropolymerization of the pyrrole ammonium monomer 1 (4 mM) at a controlled-oxidation potential of +0.95 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 for the C electrode in acetonitrile (Scheme 1 and Fig. S1†). The surface coverage in ammonium units ΓN+ (mol cm−2), i.e. the quantity of pyrrole units deposited on the C electrode (0.071 cm2), was quantified electrochemically by integration of the polypyrrole reversible wave (see the ESI†). ΓN+ values ranging from 1.1 × 10−7 to 1.3 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for C electrodes were obtained when a 4 mC anodic charge was used for the polymerization of 1 (Fig. S2†).
 Scheme 1  General strategy for the electrosynthesis of poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium)/NiOx composite film modified electrodes. (i) Formation of poly1 by oxidative electropolymerization of monomer 1 (4 mM) at Eapp = +0.95 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 in CH3CN, 0.1 M [Bu4N]ClO4; (ii) incorporation of [Ni(C2O4)2]2− into poly1 upon soaking for 1 h in an aqueous solution (pH 6) of 1 mM NiSO4, 5 mM NaC2O4, 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M H3BO3; (iii) electroprecipitation of Ni0 within poly1 at Eapp = −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the previously mentioned aqueous solution of nickel oxalate; (iv) electrooxidation of Ni0 to NiOx by repeated cyclic voltammetry scans between 0 and +1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl in an aqueous solution (pH 9.2) of 0.1 M H3BO3 and 0.05 M NaOH. 
Using the excellent ion-exchange properties of the cationic polymeric film poly1, this film was then loaded with the anionic nickel oxalate complex, [Ni(C2O4)2]2−, generated in situ from an aqueous borate buffer (0.1 M) solution at pH 6 containing 1 mM of NiSO4 and 5 mM NaC2O4. According to previous studies, under such conditions, the di-anionic [Ni(C2O4)2]2− complex is the largely predominant species present in solution compared to Ni(C2O4) and [Ni(C2O4)3]4−.85 The large concentration in the negatively charged [Ni(C2O4)2]2− complex allows ensuring a good loading of nickel into the cationic pyrrole-alkylammonium polymer film. In the third step, an efficient incorporation of Ni0 particles inside the poly1 film was achieved by electroreduction of the [Ni(C2O4)2]2− loaded in the film at a controlled potential of −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl by maintaining the electrode in the nickel oxalate solution. For this electroreduction, only about 80–90 seconds was required to pass 4 mC of cathodic charge (Fig. S3†). For comparative studies, a similar Ni0 electrodeposition was performed on naked C electrodes in the nickel oxalate aqueous borate buffer solution (pH 6) using also a cathodic charge of 4 mC. In this case, the deposition, requiring only 60 seconds, is even faster (Fig. S3†). The optimum cathodic potential of −1.4 V for Ni0 electrodeposition was determined from cyclic voltammetry experiments carried out with naked C and C/poly1 electrodes as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammetry recorded at C (black line) and C/poly1 (ΓN+ = 1.1 × 10−7 mol cm−2) (red line) electrodes (3 mm in diameter) in an aqueous solution (pH 6) of 1 mM NiSO4, 5 mM NaC2O4, 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M H3BO3; the C/poly1 electrode was dipped in the aforementioned aqueous solution for 1 h before the cyclic voltammetry experiment. 
The electroactivity of the nickel oxalate solution is characterized by an irreversible cathodic reduction process observed below −1.25 V which is ascribed to the reduction of Ni2+ (coordinated to oxalate) to Ni0 leading to its deposition on the C and C/poly1 electrodes and to the concomitant electrocatalytic reduction of protons to H2 through the Ni0 deposited.85 On the reverse scan, in the anodic part, two successive irreversible redox processes are observed at +1.28 and +1.82 V for C (+1.19 and +1.64 V for C/poly1) which are respectively attributed to the oxidation of oxalate anions and the reoxidation of Ni0 deposited at the electrode surface to Ni2+, leading to its dissolution.85 It can be noticed that the charge involved in this stripping wave between +1.3 and +2.0 V does not allow for estimating the quantity of nickel deposited on the C/poly1 and naked C electrodes. Indeed, the polypyrrole film is known to protect metallic particles from dissolution;85,92,93 in addition, the dissolution of Ni0 deposited on the surface of naked C electrodes is often incomplete due to passivation phenomena.85 The precise determination of nickel loaded on the electrodes was thus performed by ICP-MS experiments after the electrogeneration of NiOx from Ni0 (see below). Finally, in the last step, the nickel oxide (i.e. Ni(O)(OH), denoted NiOx), is generated by oxidation of Ni0 by scanning the C/poly1-Ni0 or C/Ni0 modified electrodes in an aqueous borate buffer at pH 9.2 over the 0 to +1.2 V potential range for 50 consecutive cycles (scan rate 50 mV s−1) (Fig. 2 and Scheme 1).
 Fig. 2  Electro-induced generation of NiOx from Ni0 into a poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium) film by repeated cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans (50 scans; scan rate of 50 mV s−1) in an aqueous 0.1 M borate buffer solution (pH 9.2) at the (A) C/poly1-Ni0 electrode (ΓN+ = 1.1 × 10−7 mol cm−2, ΓNi = 3.3 × 10−8 mol cm−2) and (B) C/Ni0 electrode (ΓNi = 1.2 × 10−8 mol cm−2) and (C) overlay of the 50th scans of the C/poly1-Ni0 (red) and C/Ni0 (blue) electrodes (in black, the electroactivity of a naked C electrode of 3 mm diameter). 
The formation of NiOx is evidenced by the progressive growth of the well-known NiII(OH)2/NiIII(O)(OH) redox process5 with an anodic peak and a cathodic peak located at +0.88 and +0.60 V for C/poly1–NiOx and at +0.80 and +0.67 V for C/NiOx, respectively (Fig. 2A and B). More cycles do not lead to a significant increase of the NiII(OH)2/NiIII(O)(OH) redox process. Note that the first scan of the C/poly1-Ni0 modified electrode shows two broad anodic processes at around +0.7 and +1.0 V corresponding to the oxidation and the overoxidation of the polypyrrole, respectively. Consequently, after the first scan from 0 to +1.2 V, the conductivity of polypyrrole is fully destroyed owing to its complete overoxidation. Thus, at this stage, the overoxidized poly1 plays only the role of matrix and the conductivity of the film is ensured by the nickel catalyst. Otherwise, upon scanning from 0 to +1.2 V, a concomitantly growing catalytic current is observed above +0.95 V for both C/poly1-Ni0 and C/Ni0 electrodes (Fig. 2). This process is ascribed to the catalytic oxidation of water to O2, concomitant to the formation of the NiOx species (potentially the β-NiIII(O)(OH) and/or γ-NiIII/IV(O)(OH) phases5,94,95) from Ni0 which occurs at the same potential. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3A, the NiOx formation is not observed by successive scans between 0 and +0.95 V of a C/poly1-Ni0 electrode and only the polypyrrole oxidation and overoxidation are observable on the first scan. The NiOx formation is only effective by scanning up to +1.20 V as shown by the appearance and the progressive increase of the characteristic NiII(OH)2/NiIII(O)(OH) redox process5 (Fig. 3B). The growth of the NiOx redox process is stopped (Fig. 3C) if the oxidation potential of further scans is restricted to +0.95 V, confirming the need to sweep above +0.95 V to generate NiOx. Basically, the sequential three-electron oxidation of Ni0 to Ni3+ that takes place above +0.95 V is followed by the formation of nickel(III) oxy-hydroxide species (NiIII(O)(OH)) in basic medium.96 The overall reaction for the NiOx formation can be schematically displayed as: (1)
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms recorded at the C/poly1-Ni0 (ΓN+ = 1.1 × 10−7 mol cm−2, ΓNi = 3.2 × 10−8 mol cm−2) electrode (3 mm of diameter) in an aqueous 0.1 M borate buffer solution (pH 9.2): 5 successive scans between 0 and +0.95 V vs. Ag/AgCl (A), followed by 5 scans between 0 and +1.2 V (B) and then by 5 scans between 0 and +0.95 V (C); scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
With a charge of 4 mC passed for nickel deposition, the Ni loading on the C/poly1 and C electrodes was estimated to be 3.32 × 10−8 (±0.19 × 10−8) and 1.19 × 10−8 (±0.03 × 10−8) mol cm−2, respectively, corresponding to deposition yields of 11.4% and 4.1%, respectively. Thus, for the same quantity of charge (4 mC), the amount of Ni0 deposited on the C/poly1 film is 2.8 times greater than that deposited on the naked C electrode. The ratio of nickel incorporated within the poly1 film was also calculated considering that the di-anionic [Ni(C2O4)2]2− complex should be bound to two ammonium units during the Ni loading in the film. For an incorporation ratio of nickel of 100%, the ΓNi/ΓN+ ratio should be equal to 0.5.
For the C/poly1-NiOx electrodes, the average surface coverage values of Ni and poly1 were determined to be respectively ΓNi = 3.32 × 10−8 mol cm−2 and ΓN+ = 1.2 × 10−7 mol cm−2 which correspond to an average ΓNi/ΓN+ ratio of 0.28 and thus to an incorporation ratio of nickel of 56%. A similar incorporation ratio was previously obtained by our group for incorporation of the [MoS4]2− complex within poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium) films.91
The average number of electrons consumed per nickel within C/poly1-NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes was estimated from the ratio of the charge used to reduce NiOx into NiII(OH)2 to the nickel content on the electrode (Table 1 and see the ESI†). A value of 1.11 was determined for C/poly1–NiOx, while a significantly lower value of 0.17 was obtained for C/NiOx. According to the schematic Bode representation,5,95,97 the oxidation state of nickel within C/poly1–NiOx lies between two limit states, the β-NiIII(O)(OH) and the γ-NiIII/IV(O)(OH) phases. It was also previously established by Corrigan et al.98 that the β-NiII(OH)2/β-NiIII(O)(OH) transition requires a transfer of 1 electron while the α-NiII(OH)2/γ-NiIII/IV(O)(OH) transition needs 1.67 electrons, as depicted in eqn (2) and (3), respectively. Note that the γ-NiIII/IV(O)(OH) phase can also be referred to the Na(NiO2)3 phase.98 In other words, the formal nickel oxidation in the γ-Ni(O)(OH) phase has been estimated to be 3.67, with a mixture of NiIII/NiIV.94 β-NiIII(O)(OH) + H2O + 1e− → β-NiII(OH)2 + OH−(2) 0.33Na(NiO2)3 + 2H2O + 1.67e− → α-NiII(OH)2 + 0.33Na+ + 2OH−(3)

Consequently, from the value of 1.11, it could be inferred that NiOx electrogenerated in the C/poly1 electrode is mainly a β-NiIII(O)(OH) phase which was commonly considered as the most active phase towards water oxidation.56,97,99–101 However, the question of which of the β or γ phases is the most efficient is still a matter of debate,67 and some recent articles94,102 have concluded that the γ-NiIII/IV(O)(OH) phase is a better catalyst than the β-NiIII(O)(OH) phase. Otherwise, the average number of electrons consumed per Ni could be related to the ratio of the number of effective catalytically active sites to the theoretical number of active sites.78 While all Ni sites present on the C/poly1–NiOx electrode are accessible for catalysis, less than 17% of the sites are active for C/NiOx. The greater accessibility of Ni sites on C/poly1–NiOx is most probably ascribed to a better nanostructuring of material owing to the polypyrrole matrix.
To obtain another clue to the better nanostructuring of the poly1–NiOx nanocomposite material, the relative capacitance of C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes, which is correlated to the electrochemically active surface area of the electrode,56,82,103 was determined from the slope of the plot of the current density versus scan rate at 0 V (Fig. 4). Indeed, the capacitive current measured in the non-Faradaic potential region is assumed to be due to double-layer charging and can be measured from cyclic voltammograms at various scan rates (Fig. 4A and B). As shown in Fig. 4C, C/poly1–NiOx exhibits a 1.4-fold higher capacitance (93.2 and −109.2 μF cm−2 for anodic and cathodic capacitance, respectively) than C/NiOx (63.6 and −79.6 μF cm−2 for anodic and cathodic capacitance, respectively).
 Fig. 4  Electrochemical double-layer capacitance measurements: cyclic voltammograms recorded at the (A) C/poly1–NiOx (ΓN+ = 1.2 × 10−7 mol cm−2, ΓNi = 3.3 × 10−8 mol cm−2) and (B) C/NiOx (ΓNi = 1.2 × 10−8 mol cm−2) electrodes (3 mm in diameter) in an aqueous 0.1 M borate buffer solution (pH 9.2); the scans were recorded between −0.10 and +0.10 V vs. Ag/AgCl at the scan rate of 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mV s−1. (C) The cathodic and anodic current densities at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl plotted as a function of scan rate for the C/poly1–NiOx (red) and C/NiOx (black) electrodes. 
This confirms that the C/poly1–NiOx electrode has a higher electroactive surface than the C/NiOx electrode. The capacitance values determined from cyclic voltammograms are not absolute values and should be used with great care when they are compared to other catalytic OER electrodes in the literature.56,78 Indeed, these relative capacitance values should be used only for the estimation of the electroactive area of electrodes displaying the same type of materials within the same study. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that similar capacitance values (between 64 and 94 μF cm−2) were obtained by Spiccia et al.54 for NiOx films deposited on C electrodes from various molecular nickel complexes dissolved in aqueous borate buffer.
Characterization of nickel oxide and poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium)–nickel oxide nanocomposite electrode materials by AFM and TEM microscopy
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements in peak force mode were performed on ITO/poly1–NiOx and ITO/NiOx electrodes in order to identify and compare the surface morphology of both electrodes (Fig. 5 and S4†).

The electrodes (ITO surface of 0.5 cm2) were prepared with a charge of 28 mC for both the poly1 and the Ni0 deposition in order to obtain a charge density of 56 mC cm−2, similar to that used for the preparation of the C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes (4 mC for a C electrode surface of 0.071 cm2). From the AFM images, a homogenous granular topography along with well-defined grain boundaries was observed for ITO/NiOx with a root mean square (r.m.s.) roughness of 2.9 nm (Fig. 5A), while an ill-defined nodular topography (cauliflower-like) was obtained with ITO/poly1–NiOx with a close r.m.s. roughness of 4.8 nm (Fig. 5B). Cauliflower topology is typical for electrodeposited polypyrrole films,79,86 and since the NiOx particles are embedded into the polymer matrix, it was difficult to measure their size within the nanocomposite from AFM measurements. Conversely, the NiOx particle size on the surface of the ITO/NiOx electrode was roughly estimated to be 30.8 ± 8.9 nm from the AFM image (Fig. 5A). At first glance, the employment of a nickel oxalate complex (with or without a polymer matrix) seems to be a good strategy to prepare well-nanostructured and homogeneous NiOx films.
In order to estimate the NiOx particle size deposited inside the film and directly on ITO, the poly1–NiOx and NiOx materials were peeled off from the ITO plates and deposited on carbon-coated copper grids for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses (Fig. 6 and S6†). The TEM images clearly reveal big NiOx nanoparticles for the ITO/NiOx electrode with an average particle size of a hundred nanometers associated with a larger size distribution (i.e. 99.9 ± 42.5 nm, 125.9 ± 33.6 nm and 106.7 ± 33.7 nm, respectively, from Fig. 6A and S6B and C†). This average size obtained from TEM images is greater than that obtained from AFM images. This difference of particle sizes could be explained by the fact that (i) AFM measurements provide a view of the surface of the film while TEM measurements display the internal and superficial nature of the film and (ii) there is potentially a gradient of particle size within the nanocomposite film (i.e. bigger particles inside the film and smaller particles at its surface). By contrast, TEM images of NiOx trapped in the poly1 film show a percolated network of smaller nanoparticles of about 20 nm with a very narrow particle size distribution (i.e. 21.0 ± 3.6 nm and 22.4 ± 4.0 nm, respectively, from Fig. 6B and S6A†). TEM images unambiguously illustrate the finer nanostructure of the poly1–NiOx material compared to that of the bare NiOx. In addition, the SAED pattern recorded from poly1–NiOx indicates that the particles within polypyrrole are crystalline and randomly oriented. The indexing of the punctuated diffraction rings confirms that the metal oxide generated within the poly1 film is indeed nickel oxide (see the ESI,† Fig. S7).104,105 To sum up, the use of polypyrrole films as a template for nickel deposition and NiOx formation allows obtaining highly nanostructured NiOx films by avoiding agglomeration of particles, and a high crystallinity.

Electrocatalytic performance of nickel oxide and poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium)–nickel oxide nanocomposite electrodes
The electrocatalytic activity of C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes has been evaluated in a conventional three-electrode cell by linear sweep voltammetry at pH 9.2 as well as at more basic pH values of 13 and 14 (Fig. 7). Table 2 and S2† summarize the catalytic OER performances of these electrodes and those of some nickel-based electrodes reported in the literature at similar pH values. The design of catalysts able to operate at nearly neutral pH is of high importance not only in order to use natural water sources but also to develop photoelectrochemical cells for light-driven water splitting that couples a catalyst and a molecular photosensitizer, the latter being often poorly stable in strongly basic solution.106 The two figures of merit usually measured for an electrocatalyst working at pH 9.2 are the catalytic current density (j) at an overpotential (η) of +0.61 V (corresponding to +1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 9.2) and the overpotential needed to reach the catalytic current density of 1 mA cm−2. For C/poly1–NiOx, the j value at +0.61 V and the η value at 1 mA cm−2 are 2.17 mA cm−2 and +0.51 V, respectively, while for C/NiOx these values are 0.66 mA cm−2 and +0.67 V, respectively (Table 2). The higher j value and lower η value of C/poly1–NiOx compared to those of C/NiOx can be attributed not only to the greater amount of NiOx deposited on the electrode owing to the presence of the polypyrrole film but also to the greater nanostructuration of the NiOx particles within the poly1 matrix as observed in the TEM images (vide supra). Regarding the significant difference in the particle size and in the mass loading of NiOx within the C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes, the catalytic activity of C/poly1–NiOx is expected to be five- or six-fold higher than that of C/NiOx. However, the catalytic current density at an overpotential of +0.61 V with C/poly1–NiOx is only 3.3 times higher than that of C/NiOx (Table 2). This weaker difference in terms of catalytic activity between both electrodes could be ascribed to a more difficult mass transport (i.e. release of O2 outside the nanocomposite) within the polypyrrole film which limits the electrocatalytic performance of C/poly1–NiOx.

In spite of a hypothetical slow mass transport, the catalytic current density at an overpotential of +0.61 V for C/poly1–NiOx is quite significant at pH 9.2 and higher than those reported by Spiccia et al.54,55 with analogous NiOx-based electrodes prepared by anodic electrodeposition of nickel(II) amine complexes (j at +0.61 V in the range 1.2 to 1.3 mA cm−2, Table 2). The higher catalytic current of C/poly1–NiOx can be ascribed to the smaller NiOx particles (average size of 21 nm, vide supra) than those deposited on Spiccia's electrodes (particle size between 300 and 350 nm), improving the accessibility of Ni sites to the water (or OH−) substrate. The same group59 succeeded in improving the efficiency of their electrodes towards water oxidation in terms of the j value by increasing the amount of NiOx deposited on the electrode (i.e. mass loading between 330 and 1100 μg cm−2) via a screen-printing method that uses inks of NiOx microballs (NiOx-MB) and nanoparticles (NiOx-NP and NiOx-NP1) (Table 2). A greater Ni mass loading on the electrode generates thicker films of NiOx with a larger electrocatalytic surface area beneficial for the catalytic performance. Nevertheless, a thicker NiOx film could also hinder the mass transport of OH− and O2 and usually displays a strong electrical resistance.59,107,108 Consequently, the mass activity (catalytic current (A) per milligram of Ni) and the turnover frequency (TOF) of the FTO/NiOx-MB, FTO/NiOx-NP and FTO/NiOx-NP1 electrodes lying between 0.013 and 0.027 A mg−1 at a η value of 0.61 V and between 0.002 and 0.005 s−1 at 0.52 V are very low (Table 2). By comparison, the mass activity and the TOF values at an overpotential of 0.61 V of the electrodes described in this work are clearly superior and are among the highest values in the literature for a NiOx-based anode operating at pH 9.2, with 1.12 A mg−1 and 0.17 s−1 for C/poly1–NiOx, and 0.95 A mg−1 and 0.14 s−1 for C/NiOx (Table 2). Note that at an overpotential of 0.52 V, our electrodes with TOF values of 0.075 and 0.060 s−1 for C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx, respectively, are also much more active than the FTO/NiOx-MB, FTO/NiOx-NP and FTO/NiOx-NP1 electrodes.59
Only NiFeOx deposited on the C electrode by Strasser et al.109 outperforms the electrodes prepared in this work at pH 9.2 with a lower η value of 0.37 V at 1 mA cm−2 along with a high mass activity of 1.9 A mg−1 and a high TOF value of 0.29 s−1 at an overpotential of 0.40 V (Table 2). The mixed NiFe oxide, published first by Radniecka et al.72 and Corrigan et al.73 in the 80s, is among the best OER electrocatalysts in the literature and it was postulated by Boettcher et al.74 and Bell et al.22 that iron is the catalytically active site within this mixed oxide, NiOx only offering to FeOx an electrically conductive framework with a high surface area that reveals the real catalytic activity of FeOx. Indeed Boettcher et al.23,74 demonstrated that FeOx is much more active than NiOx towards the OER when very thin films of metallic oxide are deposited on the electrode, but thicker films of FeOx suffer from a very low electrical conductivity which limits their electrocatalytic performance.
It can also be noted that Nocera et al.52 reported a quite efficient electrode with a very low overpotential of 0.425 V at 1 mA cm−2 and pH 9.2. Such a high catalytic activity would be assigned to the deposition of a very thin NiOx film on the electrode, close to a monolayer of catalyst, conferring a high electrical conductivity and promoting the mass transport, as mentioned above (Table 2). Hu et al.110 also published an interesting approach to build a nanostructured Ni-based anode with high porosity via the use of a scaffold of SiO2. Basically, silica was co-electrodeposited with nickel on a stainless steel electrode and then removed under basic conditions, leading to a porous NiOx film with an average particle size of 50 nm. Although this electrode exhibits good catalytic performance with a η value of +0.45 V at 1 mA cm−2, the mass activity at the overpotential of 0.61 V of 0.021 A mg−1 is still significantly inferior to those of C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx (Table 2).
The stability of C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes during electrolysis at pH 9.2 was evaluated by chronoamperometry measurements over a period of 3 h at an applied potential of +1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl under stirring in order to decrease the resistance due to the mass transport and thus to improve the catalytic performance of the electrode (Fig. S12†). The catalytic current density of the C/poly1–NiOx electrode is 1.5-fold higher than that of C/NiOx and is very stable within the first hour, while that of the C/NiOx electrode gradually decreases to reach a low value similar to that of a bare carbon electrode (Fig. S12†). This clearly indicates that C/poly1–NiOx is more robust and efficient than C/NiOx. The instability of the C/NiOx electrode could be attributed to the gradual release of nickel oxide particles from the electrode surface. By contrast, such a phenomenon does not occur on C/poly1–NiOx since the NiOx particles are embedded into the polymer matrix which protects them from degradation or release in solution. Nevertheless, after 1 h of electrolysis, the current density of the C/poly1–NiOx electrode also starts to gradually and drastically decrease (Fig. S12†). The activity loss of C/poly1–NiOx is simply due to the progressive detachment of the polymer film caused by the oxygen bubbling during electrolysis and not to the degradation of poly1–NiOx nanocomposite material. In order to demonstrate this assumption, the poly1–NiOx nanocomposite and, for comparison, NiOx materials were electrodeposited on porous ITO plates (denoted ITOpor; surface of 0.4 cm2) through the all-electrochemical procedure described above. This strategy has allowed avoiding the detachment of the nanocomposite film by improving its physisorption on the electrode and thus significantly prolonging the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode for several days. These ITOpor plates have been prepared by a straightforward method recently reported by Zhang et al.111 which consists in the partial electroreduction of the surface of ITO (i.e. In2O3/SnO2) into a metallic In/Sn layer, followed by the stripping of the thin In/Sn layer in a solution of aqua regia. The ITOpor/poly1–NiOx and ITOpor/NiOx plates were characterized by AFM (Fig. S5†), SEM-EDX (Fig. S8–S10†) and ICP-MS (see the ESI†). SEM-EDX and ICP-MS measurements confirm the presence of nickel deposited on ITOpor and ITOpor/poly1, and AFM images reveal that ITOpor/poly1–NiOx and ITOpor/NiOx exhibit relatively close morphologies to those of the electrodes described above using nonporous ITO plates, i.e. ITO/poly1–NiOx and ITO/NiOx (Fig. 5). Films of poly1–NiOx deposited on ITOpor present a considerable increase in stability during electrolysis at pH 9 and an applied potential of +1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 8) compared to similar films deposited on the C electrode (Fig. S12†). The catalytic current of ITOpor/poly1–NiOx electrodes is indeed extremely stable over a period of several days (the electrocatalysis was voluntarily stopped after 3 days). By comparison, when NiOx is directly deposited on ITOpor electrodes, the stability also increases compared to that of C electrodes but the catalytic current again gradually decreases over time and has already lost half of its initial intensity after 1 day (Fig. 8). Thus, once again, the poly1–NiOx nanocomposite electrode appears to be more efficient and robust towards the OER than the bare NiOx electrode. By overcoming the problem of the film detachment using porous ITO electrodes, we prove unambiguously the great stability of the poly1–NiOx nanocomposite and the beneficial role of the polypyrrole film which prevents the corrosion and the degradation of NiOx nanoparticles.

Tafel analysis was carried out by stepwise chronoamperometry (see the ESI†) at pH 9.2 on C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes in order to gain some mechanistic information, through the Tafel slope, about the rate-determining step for the OER (Fig. 9). The Tafel slopes calculated for C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx of 72 and 69 mV per decade, respectively, are almost identical, showing that the same catalytic mechanism occurs within both electrodes. A similar Tafel slope was previously reported with a Ni-based anode110 operating at pH 9.2 and these slope values are close to the predicted value of 60 mV dec−1, which suggests that the rate -determining step leading to O2 evolution is a chemical reaction subsequent to the first electron transfer step.5 The Tafel analysis also confirms that C/poly1–NiOx electrodes operate efficiently at a lower overpotential than the C/NiOx electrodes.
 Fig. 9  Tafel plot recorded at a C/poly1–NiOx (ΓN+ = 1.2 × 10−7 mol cm−2, ΓNi = 3.3 × 10−8 mol cm−2) (red) and a C/NiOx (ΓNi = 1.2 × 10−8 mol cm−2) (black) electrode (3 mm diameter) in a 0.1 M aqueous borate buffer solution (pH 9.2). 
The electrocatalytic activity of the C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes was also investigated at pH 13 and 14 (Fig. 7), since the most common commercial electrolyzers operate in strongly alkaline media and most of the metallic catalysts for the OER based on non precious and earth-abundant elements are studied under basic conditions in order to avoid the corrosion of metal.74,112 At these basic pH values, the onset potential for the OER and the NiII(OH)2/NiIII(O)(OH) redox process recorded at C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx by linear sweep voltammetry (Fig. 7) are cathodically shifted compared to the values measured at pH 9.2, which is a classical behavior for a nickel-based electrode studied at various basic pH values.55,109 The figures of merit for an electro-catalyst operating at basic pH are the catalytic j value at η of 0.30 and 0.35 V (respectively corresponding to 0.56 and 0.61 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 13 and 0.51 and 0.56 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 14) and the overpotential at the j value of 10 mA cm−2. These figures of merit stem from the studies of Weber et al.113,114 and Jaramillo et al.,60,115 who have proposed that an integrated solar water-splitting device, under 1 sun of illumination with a quantum yield of energy conversion (solar-to-fuels) of 10%, should work with a current density per geometric area of 10 mA cm−2 and a global overpotential lower than 0.45 V. In addition, considering an overpotential of 0.45 V for the water-splitting reaction, Jaramillo et al.60 have estimated that the cathode in charge of HER should operate at a η value of 0.10 V, and thus the anode devoted to the OER should work at 0.35 V. This explains why most of the electrocatalytic activities of anodes published in recent years are referenced at an overpotential of 0.35 V or at a closer value of 0.30 V.
At pH 13 (Table 2), the C/poly1–NiOx anode displays interesting catalytic performances with j values of 1.75 and 0.25 mA cm−2 at 0.35 V and 0.30 V, respectively, and a η value of 0.45 V at 10 mA cm−2, while C/NiOx seems again to be less active with j values of 0.39 and 0.07 mA cm−2 at 0.35 V and 0.30 V, respectively, and a η value of 0.57 V at 10 mA cm−2. Similarly to what has been observed at pH 9.2, C/poly1–NiOx exhibits at pH 13 very high mass activity and TOF values at an overpotential of 0.35 V with 0.90 A mg−1 and 0.14 s−1, respectively. At pH 14 (Table 2), the C/poly1–NiOx electrode presents a higher electrocatalytic activity than at pH 13 with j values of 2.49 mA cm−2 at 0.35 V and 0.52 mA cm−2 at 0.30 V, and a lower overpotential of 0.41 V at 10 mA cm−2. Its mass activity and TOF values are also slightly higher at pH 14 at an overpotential of +0.35 V (i.e. 1.28 A mg−2 and 0.19 s−1) and these values double at 0.30 V compared to those at pH 13 (i.e. 0.27 A mg−2 and 0.04 s−1). Surprisingly, the performance of the simple C/NiOx electrode decreases at pH 14 compared to that at pH 13, most probably due to a poor mass transport of OH− anions within the NiOx film that hinders the oxidation reaction. It is worth noting that at pH 13 and 14, the C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes lose their activity after only a few successive scans by cyclic voltammetry between 0 and 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This poor stability under strong basic conditions can be directly correlated to the detachment of the film of poly1–NiOx or NiOx induced by the strong oxygen bubbling as a consequence of their high catalytic performances. Nevertheless, the first scan recorded at the C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes at pH 13 and 14 is sufficient to evaluate their real catalytic activity and thus their potentiality towards the OER under very basic conditions. At pH 13 and 14, the C/poly1–NiOx and C/NiOx electrodes have exhibited catalytic activities (i.e. mass activity and TOF values) substantially superior to that of most of the literature anodes using nickel oxide, even those using ruthenium or iridium oxide, which are commonly considered as benchmark electrocatalysts for water oxidation due to their high catalytic performances in acidic and basic media (see Table S2 in the ESI†).53,56,58,76,77,79,106,109,116–124 In spite of the fact that the stability of the nanocomposite film has to be improved in alkaline conditions (above pH 13), this study confirms that the use of a polymer matrix to design metallic anodes is a good strategy to obtain highly structured and very active electrodes for water oxidation.
Conclusion
We report a very efficient OER anode based on a nickel oxide–poly(pyrrole-alkylammonium) nanocomposite prepared by an easy all-electrochemical synthesis. As observed by AFM and TEM, this composite features a great nanostructuration along with small crystalline NiOx particles of ca. 21 nm dispersed in the polymer film, which confers a high electroactive surface area and thus high electrocatalytic performance. These nickel oxide particles entrapped within the polypyrrole film, whose nature has been determined by coulometric titration to be β-NiIII(O)(OH), exhibit exceptional mass activity and TOF values for the OER at pH 9.2 of 1.12 A mg−1 and 0.17 s−1 at an overpotential of 0.61 V. Under basic conditions at pH 14, the nickel oxide–polypyrrole nanocomposite electrode, with a high mass activity and TOF values of 1.28 A mg−1 and 0.19 s−1, respectively, at an overpotential of 0.35 V, outperforms the nickel-based anodes of the literature (undoped by Fe) and those using precious metal oxides, such as RuO2 and IrO2. In addition, the nickel oxide electrogenerated into polypyrrole-alkylammonium films also appeared to be more efficient than the nickel oxide film electrogenerated on a naked electrode surface by the same electrochemical procedure, highlighting the beneficial role of the polypyrrole matrix in generating small NiOx particles with high activity. Finally, in order to avoid the film detachment of the nickel oxide–polypyrrole nanocomposite from the surface of the electrode under electrocatalytic conditions, we have successfully used porous ITO electrodes. When the nanocomposite is deposited on such electrode surfaces, its physisorption is considerably enhanced, leading to a very stable electrocatalytic current even after 3 days of electrolysis. This very promising way to prepare elaborate nanocomposite material paves the way for the design of new anodes very active and highly stable for the OER by using other earth abundant metals, such as cobalt, manganese and iron. This all-electrochemical method of preparation offers a great versatility not only to prepare mixed metal oxide nanoparticles that are more efficient for the OER such as NiFeOx but also to develop photoanodes by the introduction of a molecular photosensitizer within the polymer matrix in order to implement photoelectrochemical cells for the light-driven water splitting reaction.
