Here, the ZTO/CBS–GNs cell exhibits a superior performance and the highest efficiency is 8.6%. The multichannel separation process from the TPV signals indicates that the macro-photoelectric signals can be attributed to photogenerated charges separated at the interface of CBS/GNs, rather than CBS/ZTO. The comprehensive signals of SPS, TFR and TPV not only provide insights into the transition, separation and shifting of photogenerated carriers, but also promote the exploration of charge dynamics from the picosecond to second range. Importantly, the BHJ flexible solar cells with excellent efficiency and facile, scalable production present significant potential for practical application.
1. Introduction
In the past twenty years, some thorough and comprehensive research studies have been carried out to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Here, several superior performances have been reported over 8.0%,1,2 such as 9.2%,3 8.94%,4 11.7%,5 and a fill factor of 0.80 has been achieved.6 For the electron transport layer, some binary oxides including ZnO,7 SnO2,8 and In2O39 have been reported. However, multi-cation oxides have been scarcely investigated in BHJ solar cells. To date, only two ternary oxides SrTiO310 and Zn2SnO411 have been used as electron transport layers. Zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4) as a typical ternary oxide exhibits excellent electrical properties and high optical stability.12 Recently, an efficiency of 3.8% has been reported for Zn2SnO4 (ZTO) nanoparticles in dye-sensitized solar cells.11 Besides, ZTO as an electron transport material has better stability than ZnO and SnO2 for acidic donors,13 and exhibits higher open-circuit potential and lower sensitivity than standard TiO2 cells.14
Recently, flexible solar cells with lightweight, foldable, portable, wearable, and cheap advantages have attracted much academic interest and industrial attention with extensive applications.15–17 Traditional plastic and polymer substrates do not withstand a high temperature sintering process. Here, the stainless steel mesh (SSM) is an ideal substrate for weave-based solar cells due to its low cost, high strength, good electrical conductivity, excellent temperature-resistance and corrosion resistance. The key to SSM-based solar cells is to construct an optimal architecture with suitable materials to achieve excellent performance.18
For application as a photoelectric device, it is reported that Cu4Bi4S9 (CBS) exhibits excellent photoconductivity and electron transfer properties.19 There is also a broad photovoltaic response for a thin film of CBS nanoribbons.20 Recently, some BHJ solar cells with CBS as a donor have been reported, indicating the potential application of CBS nanoribbons.21 However, the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in pure CBS films only generates weak photoelectric properties and restricts their application. Graphene possesses a typical two-dimensional (2D) structure. With some superior properties, such as high electron mobility, high thermal conductivity, high specific surface area and excellent mechanic strength,22 graphene, especially graphene nanoplatelets (GNs), has attracted extensive research interest and industrial application in solar cells, electron devices, energy conversion and storage devices, etc.23
With factors changing in ZTO/CBS and ZTO/CBS–GNs on the SSM, qualitative and quantitative analysis of the photoelectric signals can provide some insights into the thermodynamic model and the basis of more systematic studies on the photochemical charge transport process using surface photovoltage spectroscopy (see Fig. SI1 and SI2(a), ESI†). With the combination of different detection methods, we aim to further explore the separation and transfer process, as well as the charge dynamics.21,24–29
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of samples
All reagents are of analytical grade or better without further purification. The deionized water used in our work has an electrical resistivity of 18 Mμ cm. After cleaning and degreasing with several cleaning steps and sonicating successively in acetone, absolute ethanol, and deionized water, clean SSMs were obtained. Then, the SSMs were blown dry in a nitrogen gas stream.
For the preparation of ZTO octahedron nanoparticles, 0.21 g of SnCl4·4H2O and 0.263 g of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O were added into a solvent with 10 mL of ethylenediamine (En) and 20 mL of H2O in a 50 mL flask. The solution was stirred for 30 min and then 0.29 g NaOH was added slowly. After stirring for a few minutes, the obtained slurry was quickly transferred to a stainless steel Teflon-lined autoclave with a 50 mL inner volume. Soon, the SSMs as flexible substrates were put into the autoclave and leaned against the inner wall. This process was performed under an auto-generated pressure at 200 °C for 20 h in an oven and cooled naturally to room temperature. After cleaning with deionized water, ZTO nanoparticles with high crystallinity were obtained.
The preparation process of CBS nanoribbons was reported in our previous work.21 For the fabrication of heterojunction and BHJ flexible solar cells, first, different amounts of GNs were added into several colloids of CBS (with GNs of 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.4 wt%). After dispersed by ultrasonication and stirring continuously for 12 h, the homogeneous, dispersed solutions of CBS–GNs were obtained. Secondly, the CBS–GNs with GNs of 1.6 wt% were spin-coated onto a ZTO substrate, which was put into a glove box for 0.5 h and dried naturally. After repeating the process six times, the SSM was quickly placed into an autoclave for 30 h at 180 °C and the ZTO/CBS–GNs with well-crystallized CBS nanoribbons were obtained. Here, the film thickness of the heterojunction is about 5.0 μm. Other films of thicknesses 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5.5 and 6 μm can be prepared by changing the spin-coating times of CBS–GNs. For a fair comparison, the ZTO/CBS heterojunctions and BHJ flexible solar cells were also provided.
2.2 Characterization of samples
Using a Philips X' Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer of CuKα radiation (wavelength = 0.154 nm), the XRD patterns of the as-prepared materials were obtained. The surface morphologies of CBS, GNs, CBS–GNs and ZTO nanoparticles were determined on a field-emission scanning electron microscopy system (SEM, JSM-7001F). The microstructure of CBS–GNs was observed via a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100UHR). The thickness of the heterojunctions was obtained by profilometry (Dektak 3 profilometer, Veeco). Utilizing a scanning Kelvin probe system (SKP370), the surface potential and electronic work function of the as-prepared materials were measured. The electrical properties of the ZTO thin film were obtained using a Hall-effect measurement system (HMS-3000). The surface photovoltaic response of two types of heterojunction was evaluated using surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), and detailed information can be seen in our reported work.21 Here, the sandwich structure with two electrodes is supplied in Fig. SI1 and SI2(a) (ESI†). The emission lifetime of CBS–GNs and two heterojunctions was monitored using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TFS). The as-prepared materials were excited at 360 nm using a frequency doubled Ti:sapphire laser (pulse width of 120 fs; Mira 900F, Coherent). The time-resolved data were collected using a synchroscan streak camera (Hamamatsu, C5680). There are two temporal scanning ranges and the instrument response function (IRF) of 16 ps corresponds to the 2.2 ns range and 4 ps to the 160 ps range using a deconvolution technique. The decay of photovoltaic response was monitored using transient surface photovoltage spectroscopy (TSPS). A third harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research, Inc.) with a laser radiation pulse (pulse width of 5 ns, wavelength of 355 nm) was used to illuminate the heterojunctions. The time-resolved data were collected using a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix) with a preamplifier.
2.3. Characterization of BHJ flexible solar cells
The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the BHJ flexible solar cells was determined using a quantum efficiency measurement system (QTest Station 1000ADI). I–V measurements were carried out with a cell active area of 0.132 cm2 (battery plate of 2 × 2 cm2) via a photoelectric measurement system (Newport-94043A). The open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) were obtained using a digital source-meter (Keithley 2400). Besides, the overall conversion efficiency (η) can be calculated as follows: η = VocJscFF/Pin(1)where Voc and Jsc are the open-circuit photovoltage and short-circuit current per unit area. Pin represents the incident light power (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). As shown below, the fill factor (FF) can be obtained by FF = VmaxJmax/VocJsc(2)where Jmax and Vmax are the current and voltage per unit area with the maximum output values, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD patterns and SEM image
The XRD patterns of the CBS nanoribbons and ZTO octahedron nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. As seen, CBS has an orthorhombic-phase structure and the ZTO nanoparticles growing on the SSM match well with the cubic phase structure.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of (a) CBS nanoribbons and (b) ZTO octahedron nanoparticles. 
As shown in Fig. SI3 (ESI†), the ZTO octahedron nanoparticles are homogeneous and the average size is smaller than 100 nm. For CBS–GNs (GNs 1.6 wt%) shown in Fig. 2(a), the majority of CBS have been covered by GNs and a dense interfacial contact between the two components has been formed. As seen in Fig. SI4(a)–(c) (ESI†), the SEM images of CBS, GNs and CBS–GNs are also provided. The TEM image of CBS–GNs (GNs 1.6 wt%) is shown in Fig. 2(b), suggesting that the GN walls are very thin with stacked GNs and many corrugations. Besides, a HRTEM image of CBS is supplied in Fig. 2(c). The (10,11) planes have a lattice spacing of 0.24 nm and the (12,00) planes have a lattice spacing of 0.26 nm. As seen in Fig. 2(d), there is also a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of CBS.

3.2. Surface photovoltaic response
As seen in Fig. 3(a), the CBS film with a thickness of 5.0 μm exhibits a broad surface photovoltage (SPV). For ZTO/CBS and ZTO/CBS–GNs, the photovoltaic responses all present a trend from rise to decline with the film thickness increasing. Here, the SPV peaks with changing thickness are shown in Fig. SI5 (ESI†). As seen, the peaks increase linearly from 2.0 to 5.0 μm and then decrease slowly.

(c and d) The separation and transport mechanism of photoinduced carriers in ZTO/CBS–GNs under illumination and positive bias (CB: the conduction band; VB: the valence band; Ec: the bottom of the conduction band; Ev: the top of the valence band; Ef: the Fermi energy level; Ef0: the Fermi energy level under dark conditions; Ef1: the Fermi energy level under illumination; Ef2: the Fermi energy level under illumination with bias; Eg1 and Eg2: the energy band gap; E0unoc: the energy of the unoccupied states; AVS: the absolute vacuum energy scale; NHE: the normal hydrogen electrode; Ee: the applied electric field; hν: the energy of photon). 
With GNs wt% changing, the SPVs of CBS–GNs with the same thickness are shown in Fig. 3(a). Here, the SPV increases gradually for GNs from 0.4 to 1.6 wt%. Above 1.6 wt%, the SPV decreases and the separation between two response regions becomes clearly like pure CBS again. For GNs 1.6 wt%, there is the highest SPV (633 μV ca. 485 nm) with an obvious amalgamation between two SPV regions relative to the pure CBS film. From Table SI1 (ESI†), there is an energy level matching between CBS and GNs. The photogenerated electrons can easily transfer to the GNs and the holes in CBS. The interfacial contact barrier between CBS and the GNs can be neglected. With the GNs wt% increasing, more electrons transport to the GNs. Due to the very high electron mobility of the GNs,22 the accumulated electrons in the GNs quickly transfer to the electron collector, which can improve the collection efficiency and generate a higher SPV. For a low SPV with further addition of GNs, graphene is an almost transparent material. The optical absorption of CBS and photogenerated carriers will decrease due to the transmission of GNs. The high electron mobility in the GNs can promote the electrons to diffuse to the interface of the Pt electrode/CBS–GNs and improve the recombination rate. Besides, there is no electron blocking layer to impede the recombination. The decreasing SPV can be attributed to such factors.
The SPVs of ZTO/CBS and ZTO/CBS–GNs (GNs 1.6 wt%) are shown in Fig. 3(b). As seen, ZTO/CBS–GNs exhibits a higher SPV than that of ZTO/CBS with a distinct amalgamation of two SPV regions. For ZTO/CBS–GNs, the photogenerated electrons in CBS firstly transfer to the GNs. The accumulated electrons in the GNs can raise the Fermi level of the GNs and enhance the transfer dynamics between the GNs and ZTO. Then, a large amount of free electrons transport from the GNs to ZTO with an energy level matching as seen in Table S1 (ESI†), and the interfacial contact barrier between the GNs and ZTO can be neglected. Incorporation of GNs into CBS can improve the separation efficiency of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and result in a higher SPV than that of ZTO/CBS.
As shown in Fig. 3(c), there is a diagram of the energy band structure including several energy level matchings. For CBS and ZTO, the direct-contact presents a high contact barrier. Importantly, there are no adequate interfaces between CBS and ZTO. The majority of photogenerated electron–hole pairs are split at the interface of CBS/GNs, and the separated electrons transfer to GNs and then to ZTO. Incorporation of GNs can supply adequate interfaces and improve the separation and collection efficiency of photogenerated charges. Here, the SPVs can be attributed to the comprehensive effect of contact interfaces, the GNs conductive network, energy level matching and other factors.
3.3. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy
Using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, the emission lifetimes of the as-prepared materials were monitored with different scanning ranges. Detailed information on temporal scanning ranges can be seen in our reported work.25 In order to confirm the inherent transition mechanism of photogenerated carriers, CBS–GNs and ZTO nanoparticles/CBS were measured firstly and the fluorescence decay curves with two scanning ranges are provided in Fig. 4(a) and (b). As seen, there are two decay components for CBS–GNs and ZTO nanoparticles/CBS. The two larger time constants of 83 and 90 ps for CBS–GNs and ZTO nanoparticles/CBS can be assigned to the faster component due to the surface defects or/and deep defect levels.30,31 Besides, the ultrafast components of CBS–GNs and ZTO nanoparticles/CBS exhibit two time constants of 6 and 14 ps, respectively. The two ultrafast processes can be attributed to the transition of photogenerated electrons from excited CBS to GNs and CBS to ZTO nanoparticles.30,31
 Fig. 4  The time-resolved fluorescence decay curves (including simulation curves) with two scanning ranges of (a) CBS–GNs, (b) ZTO octahedron nanoparticles/CBS and (c) ZTO octahedron nanoparticles/CBS–GNs. 
ZTO nanoparticles/CBS–GNs were also measured and the fluorescence decay curves with two scanning ranges are shown in Fig. 4(c). As a result, there are three decay curves, which can be fitted with three decay components. The two faster components exhibit two time constants of 93 and 58 ps, respectively. The larger time constant can be attributed to deep defect levels or/and surface defects and the smaller results from the transition of photogenerated electrons from GNs to ZTO. Here, it can be seen that there is an ultrafast decay curve with a time constant of 12 ps. However, there are two ultrafast transition processes from the excited CBS to GNs and CBS to ZTO nanoparticles.30,31 Due to the limitation of our equipment, the two ultrafast processes are not distinguished with amalgamation. The signals of TFS confirmed the different transition processes of photogenerated electrons.
3.4. Transient surface photovoltaic response
Here, the energy band-gaps of CBS and ZTO are about 0.88 and 3.5 eV, respectively. Detailed information on the pulse laser and the sign of the transient surface photovoltage (TPV) are shown in our previous work.27 For ZTO nanoparticles/CBS–GNs, the illumination by a pulse laser from the Pt electrode can be seen in Fig. S2(b) (ESI†). Two different separation and transfer processes of photogenerated carriers are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (c). The first positive sign process has a time constant of 6.2 × 10−6 s, and the second has a time constant of 4.3 × 10−5 s. From the shifting process of photogenerated carriers, the fast process can be attributed to the direct separation at the interface of CBS/ZTO and the slow process can be attributed to the separation at the interface of CBS/GNs.32–34 With a medium of a mica sheet, the interface effect between CBS–GNs and the Pt electrode can be ignored. Besides, the ZTO substrate was directly spin-coated with a CBS–GNs solution and the state densities are very similar for the bulk and the surface in the CBS–GNs layer. This weak separation process of photoinduced carriers due to surface defect states and surface adsorption can also be neglected. Under illumination, some excitons can diffuse to the interface of CBS/ZTO where they are split, forming charge carriers; holes in the donor side of CBS and electrons in the transport layer of ZTO. Then the electrons transfer to the SSM, and the holes to the Pt electrode. Considering the inadequate interfaces, only a small amount of photoinduced charges can be separated and collected by bilateral current collectors. Compared to some reports, a weaker and slower TPV signal was obtained for the first process.32–34 However, the majority of excitons diffuse to the interface of CBS/GNs where they are split, the electrons in the GNs and the holes in CBS. Free electrons and holes can be achieved with further diffusion and actual separation. Then a large amount of electrons transport from the GNs to ZTO (then to the SSM), and the holes in CBS to the Pt electrode, inducing the second process as shown in Fig. 5(c).32–34 Meanwhile, the illumination by a pulse laser from the SSM electrode can be seen in Fig. S2(c) (ESI†), and three different separation and shifting processes of photoinduced carriers are shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d). The first negative sign process has a time constant of 4.2 × 10−7 s, the second of 6.3 × 10−6 s, and the third of 4.5 × 10−5 s. Generally, the drift process is quicker by several orders than diffusion.32–34 Here, a built-in electric field at the interface of ZTO/SSM is established with a direction from the SSM to ZTO, promoting the electrons to transport to the SSM and the holes to the bulk of ZTO for the first process. Similarly, some excitons can diffuse to the interface of CBS/ZTO, and the separated electrons transfer to the SSM and the holes to the Pt electrode. As seen, there is a weak TPV signal for the second process. The majority of excitons can easily diffuse to the interface of CBS/GNs, and the separated electrons transport from the GNs to ZTO (then to the SSM) and the holes in CBS to the Pt electrode in the third process. It can be seen that the TPV signal illuminated from the SSM is lower than that from the Pt electrode. The majority of photogenerated charges are from the CBS–GNs layer. The changing optical absorption and photoinduced carriers in the CBS–GNs layer result in different TPVs.

For ZTO nanoparticles/CBS, the illumination by a pulse laser from the Pt electrode can be seen in Fig. S2(b) (ESI†), and the separation and transfer process of photoinduced carriers is supplied in Fig. 5(e). This positive sign process has a time constant of 6.2 × 10−6 s. The surface and interface effects can also be ignored as per the interpretation shown in Fig. 5(c). Here, the excitons only split at the interface of CBS/ZTO, the holes in CBS and the electrons in ZTO. Then the electrons transfer to the SSM and the holes to the Pt electrode with a low signal. Besides, the illumination by a pulse laser from the SSM can be seen in Fig. SI2(c) (ESI†), and two different separation and transfer processes of photoinduced carriers are shown in Fig. 5(f). The first negative sign process has a time constant of 4.4 × 10−7 s and the second of 6.3 × 10−6 s. Similarly, the first can be attributed to the drift process and the second to diffusion. It can be seen that there are different separation and shifting mechanisms, as well as the charge dynamics for two types of heterojunctions. Upon incorporation of GNs, adequate interfaces of CBS/GNs can promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The ultrafast electron transmission channel in the GNs can improve the collection efficiency. With regard to TFS, the TPV signals provided insights into the separation and transfer process of carriers, as well as the comprehensive effect of main factors.
3.5. IPCE spectra and I–V characteristics of cells
The incident photoelectric conversion efficiency of the two types of solar cells is shown in Fig. 6(a). At 485 nm, the IPCE values of the ZTO/CBS and ZTO/CBS–GNs cells are about 35% and 70%, respectively. Using a Hall-effect system, the electron mobility of the ZTO nanoparticle film was measured to be 26 cm2 V−1 s−1. The high electron mobility can also improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency.

As shown in Fig. SI6 (ESI†), the overall photoelectric conversion efficiency of the two types of cells with various film thicknesses was firstly measured. There is the same changing trend as the SPVs to film thickness. For a fair comparison, the I–V characteristics and I–V curves of two types of solar cells with the same film thickness are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6(b), respectively. As seen, the ZTO/CBS–GNs cell presents an overall light-to-electricity efficiency (η) and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.6% and 18.4, and the ZTO/CBS cell has η and Jsc of 1.3% and 3.3. It can be seen that there is an identical feature as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). In contrast, the ZTO/CBS–GNs cell has a higher efficiency (η) than that of ZTO/CBS. Moreover, the highest η of 8.6% in our work is remarkably higher than the reported value of 0.55%.35 After the incorporation of GNs, it is mainly due to the adequate interfaces of CBS/GNs, the GNs conductive network, and other factors. The majority of photogenerated electron–hole pairs can split to electrons and holes at the interface of CBS/GNs. Then the separated electrons and holes can be collected quickly by current collectors.

4. Conclusions
The photoelectric properties can be attributed to the comprehensive effect of some factors from the signals of SPV, TFS, TPV and I–V characteristics. With the incorporation of GNs and a densely interfacial contact between CBS and the GNs, excitons can easily diffuse to the interface of CBS/GNs, and the separated electrons and holes can be collected by current collectors. The I–V characteristics exhibit the same feature as the SPVs, further confirming the separation process and the charge dynamics. Besides, the ZTO/CBS–GNs solar cells with high efficiency, great bendability and facile, scalable production present potential for practical application.
