    , Accepted 31st August 2019First published on 2nd September 2019AbstractUpconversion materials endow great potential in converting infrared irradiation to visible luminescence for security anti-counterfeiting applications. However, the development and application of upconversion materials are constrained greatly by their underlying shortcomings such as single emission colors, and low emission brightness. Here, a new approach to rationally engineering upconversion matrices with desirable performance and particle morphology is presented in Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ nanocrystals, which leads to significant enhancement of luminescence signals (up to 409 folds) and flexibly tunable UC colors. The laser-sensitization upconversion emission is systemically studied under the excitation of a 980 nm single NIR light source. We identify that the laser induced-synergic effect, crystal morphology evolution and unlocking dark sensitizers are the key factors underpinning this enhancement. Importantly, owing to this special laser power dependent optical property, these materials represent a convenient route for high security anti-counterfeiting applications. These results not only provide an upfront simple experimental design for constructing upconversion materials with strong luminescence and color tunability, but also deepen the understanding of the interaction mechanism between lasers and upconversion emission, which may be very important for practical applications in anti-counterfeiting.
1 Introduction
Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals (LUCNPs) can up-convert two or more lower-energy photons (NIR light) into higher energy photoluminescence (PL) emission in the ultraviolet, visible, or NIR ranges. Featuring a wealth of electronic transitions within the 4f shells, the lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals have enabled a broad range of applications, spanning from biological imaging,1,2 biomarker detection,3,4 and light-activated therapy5 to solar energy,6 3D displays,7 and anti-counterfeiting.8,9 LUCNPs are typically doped with ytterbium (Yb3+) sensitizer ions, which absorb infrared light and non-radiatively transfer their excitation to activator ions such as thulium (Tm3+), erbium (Er3+), or holmium (Ho3+). A typical energy transfer upconversion process in LUCNPs involves three key steps: sensitizer ion energy absorption, non-radiative energy transfer from excited cations to emission centers, and activator ion photoluminescence (PL) emission, whose upconversion efficiency relies on the energy transfer from sensitizer ions to activator ions.
An efficient energy upconversion in nanocrystals is highly desirable for practical applications. Although recent advances in synthesis and design have led to accurate control of the lanthanide-doped nanocrystal crystal phase, morphology and emission colours,10–14 it is still a great challenge to achieve strong upconversion luminescence. Tremendous attempts have been made to overcome this problem, including minimizing surface quenching via coating nanocrystals with an inert/active shell,15,16 and enhancing the energy transfer rate by surface plasmons.17,18 Despite these improvements, it remains a grand challenge to obtain sufficient upconversion luminescence caused by energy migration or thermal relaxation, which severely limits the energy transfer from absorption to emission centers. To inhibit energy migration and restrain thermal quenching, many strategies, including localizing lanthanide cations in discrete sublattices to achieve violet upconversion improvement by more than eight times,19 designing oxygen moiety chelating Yb3+ ions ([Yb⋯O]) in the nanoparticle surface to favor energy transfer from sensitizers to activators,20 developing a new host matrix with ultrahigh upconversion luminescence, and increasing the excitation irradiance to alleviate concentration quenching,21 have been developed. However, there is still a lack of a convenient and universal method to improve upconversion fluorescence.
In recent years, the development of multicolor-emitting materials has attracted increasing attention owing to their potential applications, including in displays, graphics imaging, and anti-counterfeiting.7,22,23 Intriguingly, benefiting from ladder-like arranged energy levels, a single lanthanide activator can produce a set of emission bands from ultraviolet to near-infrared. The emission color can be controlled by employing various routes, such as tailoring the pulse width of the laser beam, and optimizing dopant concentration.24,25 However, these color tuning techniques would require either chemical composition design or physical optimization. Therefore, there is demand for a simple method to simultaneously realize multicolor emission and bright upconversion luminescence in lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals.
Here, we demonstrate the possibility of spatially laser-induced maximization of upconversion emission. The laser treatment material exhibits excellent luminescent properties as well as porous morphology. Cubic Gd2O3 is chosen as the host material for the synthesis of bright color-tunable nanocrystals. Yb3+ is used as an efficient sensitizer for harvesting 980 nm light, and Er3+ is chosen as an activator to ensure the generation of red and green emission. Importantly, a laser induced-synergic effect is proposed, which not only alleviates nonradiation probability via morphology evolution, but also favors energy transfer from sensitizers to activators. At the same time, the UC luminescence color can be finely tuned from red through yellow and finally to the green region by increasing the pump power. Note that the color range of laser treated samples increases, leading to the achievement of pure green and red emission. Furthermore, this laser sensitized upconversion emission provided a simple route for high security anti-counterfeiting applications.
2 Experimental methods
2.1 Materials
Lanthanide nitrate including Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (99.9%), Er(NO3)3·5H2O (99.9%), Tm(NO3)3·5H2O, Ho(NO3)3·5H2O and Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%), and NaOH were purchased from Sigma-Aldric. Deionized water as a solvent was used throughout the experiment procedure. All chemicals were analytical grade reagents and used directly without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of Gd2O3:Yb3+,X3+ (X = Er, Ho and Tm) nanocrystals
Gd2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals (nanorods) were fabricated via a hydrothermal procedure. In a typical synthesis, Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (2 mmol), Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (0.2 mmol), and Er(NO3)3·5H2O (0.02 mmol) were completely dissolved in 10 mL deionized water and magnetically stirred at 25 °C for 30 min. Then a NaOH solution (5 mol L−1) was added (final pH adjusted to 8.5–9), and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The resultant white precipitate was transferred to a Teflon autoclave and kept at 453 K (24 h). The white precipitates were washed with ethanol and water with centrifugation at 3000 rpm six times and dried in air at 333 K. The dried powder was annealed in air at 1073 K for 4 h. A similar procedure was adopted for the synthesis of Gd2O3:Yb3+,Ho3+ or Gd2O3:Yb3+,Tm3+. In this case, Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (2 mmol), Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (0.2 mmol), and Ho(NO3)3·5H2O or Tm(NO3)3·5H2O (0.02 mmol) were completely dissolved in 10 mL deionized water. Then a NaOH solution (5 mol L−1) was added (final pH adjusted to 8.5–9) and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The resultant white precipitate was transferred to a Teflon autoclave and kept at 453 K for 24 h. The white precipitates were then washed with distilled water and ethanol six times, and dried in air at 333 K. Finally, the dried powder was annealed in air at 1073 K for 4 h.
2.3 NIR laser treatment
The laser treatment was performed with a 980 nm InGaAs diode laser. The laser was fixed and irradiated at a particular power (711 mW, 1067 mW, 1511 mW and 1867 mW). The white powder samples were pressed into pellets for laser irradiation treatment. To obtain laser treated samples, the pellet samples were irradiated by a 980 nm laser for 30 s.
2.4 Characterization
The compositions of the resulting products were studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/max-RB12 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology and size of the products were characterized by a SU8000 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). An energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) facility attached to the field emission SEM (FEI Quanta 200) was employed for determination of chemical composition. TEM and HRTEM images and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were observed by a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2100). TGA was carried out using a Shimadzu TGA 50 instrument with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under a continuous air stream with a flow rate of 10 cm3 min−1. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were taken on a Shimadzu IR Affinity-1 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer over the wavenumber range 400–4000 cm−1. Upconversion PL spectra were recorded using by Zolix-SBP300 grating spectrometer equipped with a CR131 photomultiplier tube. Synchronously, a 980 nm diode laser was used as the pump source, and a signal generator was used to convert a continuous 980 nm excitation source to a pulse excitation source. The fluorescence lifetime was measured by the 980 nm diode laser modulated through square-wave electric current and recorded by a Tektronix DOP 4140 oscilloscope.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structure characterization
Cubic-phase Gd2O3 with Yb3+ and Er3+ nanocrystals are synthesized by the hydrothermal method and annealing treatment. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show that all products are composed of uniform nanorods (Fig. 1a and d). The element mapping of the Gd2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles exhibits uniform doping of Ln3+ ions in the upconversion (UC) nanoparticles (Fig. 1e–g). Power X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-prepared hydrothermal samples are characteristic of the pure hexagonal Gd(OH)3 (JCPDS no. 83-2037), while the patterns of the annealed samples are indexed to cubic Gd2O3 (Fig. S1a, ESI†).

In order to establish the phase nature of the synthesized Gd2O3, the TEM, HRTEM and SAED patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The d-spacing of the planes in the lattice image seen in the HRTEM photograph (Fig. 1b) is 0.31 nm and 0.19 nm, corresponding to the (222) and (440) plane, respectively. This is coincident with two intense lines in the XRD pattern (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The SAED pattern (Fig. 1c) indexed as (111), (220), (311), (511) and (440) planes demonstrates the polycrystalline nature of Gd2O3, which matches well with the results of XRD.
The thermogravimetry curve of the nanocrystal shows the crystalline structure evolution. The TG curve shows two stages of weight loss (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The first weight loss (approximately 7%) step is observed between 509 and 619 K when the Gd(OH)3 hexagonal structure loses one water molecule. Another mass loss is from 707 to 867 K. This is caused by the elimination of hydroxyl, nitrate, and carbonate groups, generating oxide (Gd2O3) from hydroxide phase.
3.2 Maximization of upconversion emission via laser treatment
Fig. S2 (ESI†) records the excitation power-dependent UC intensity spectra with an incident power in the range ∼20–1511 mW. Under 980 nm laser excitation, the upconversion nanoparticles exhibit typical ET upconversion emission of Er3+. The green UC emission originated from the 2H11/2/4S3/2–4I15/2 transition is located in the wavelength region from 500 to 575 nm luminescence, and the red UC emission in the spectral range of 625–700 nm is derived from the 4F9/2–4I15/2 transition (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†). The proposed UC mechanism is shown in Fig. S2h (ESI†). The upconversion luminescence intensity increases with the pump rising. When the pump power further elevates, the luminescence intensity decreases owing to power saturation and thermal quenching caused by high laser power. Surprisingly, the upconversion emission intensity remarkably improves two orders of magnitude at the same pump power when the upconversion nanoparticles are treated with a 980 nm laser under the pump power of 1867 mW (Fig. 2a). And both the green and red luminescence intensity increases compared to the raw sample at the same power, but the enhancement of red luminescence intensity is more pronounced as the irradiation power increases from 20 to 623 mW. This may be due to the increase of energy transfer as well as the enhancement of a cross relaxation process (4F7/2 + 4I11/2–4F9/2 + 4F9/2). It is noteworthy that the power saturation effect is also alleviated after a high-power treatment. After higher excitation power treatment, the power saturation bottleneck shifts to higher excitation power (as shown in Fig. 2b). This high-power treatment technique has been implemented in the Gd2O3 with Yb3+ and another emission lanthanide ion Ho3+, achieving 195-fold enhancement for green upconversion emission light (Fig. 2c and d). The upconversion luminescence (UCL) spectra of the Gd2O3:Ho3+,Yb3+ and laser treated Gd2O3:Ho3+,Yb3+ are shown in Fig. S2c and d (ESI†). While for the sample with Tm3+ and Yb3+, this phenomenon can be observed only at the irradiation power of 711 mW or less than 711 mW, achieving a 1.35-fold increase in blue emission after 711 mW laser treatment (Fig. 2e and Fig. S2e, f, ESI†). When the sample is treated by a 1867 mW laser, the upconversion luminescence intensity of the treated sample decreases relative to the raw sample at the same pump power (Fig. S2g, ESI†) owing to the large level mismatch and increase of the cross relaxation process. The degree of energy level mismatches is closely related to the luminescence signal.20,26 By comparing the degrees of energy level mismatches between ytterbium ions (sensitizer) and different activators, we find that the maximum enhancement factors of laser power treatment enhanced upconversion strongly follow the degree of energy level mismatches in the order ΔEYb–Er < ΔEYb–Ho < ΔEYb–Tm, as shown in Fig. 2f. It may be that the laser treatment can alleviate energy depletion, and simultaneously promote energy transfer, and the low degree of energy level mismatches facilitates energy transfer.

It should be noted that the UC luminescence is sensitive to laser treatment power. To understand the relationship between the upconversion signal and laser treatment power, we collect a matrix of power-dependent luminescence spectra of the upconversion nanocrystals at varying laser treatment power (Fig. S3a–c, ESI†). The UCL improvement folds for the sample treated with different power are exhibited in Fig. 3a–c. For the sample treated by a 1511 mW laser, the red UCL enhancement fold is proportional to pump power, which is similar to the sample treated at 1867 mW (Fig. 3a). However, when the sample is treated by 1067 mW and 623 mW lasers, there is an irregular dependence between the UCL improvement folds and the power for the laser treated sample (Fig. 3b and c). To make it clear, the maximum enhancement folds of UC intensity against the laser treatment power are summarized in Fig. 3d. It is worth noting that the improvement of upconversion emission intensity is directly proportional to the value of the laser treatment power. The enhancement factor of 410, 210, 152, and 1.8 for red upconversion emission and the improvement fold of 208, 193, 99, and 2.4 for green upconversion luminescence are observed under the maximum laser treatment power of 1867 mW, 1511 mW, 1067 mW, and 623 mW, respectively. It is not hard to find that a high laser treatment power is beneficial for the improvement of upconversion luminescence intensity. This strongly implies that the mechanism behind the extraordinary power-enhanced luminescence of samples could be associated with the laser thermal effect.

(d) The improvement folds of red and green emission versus laser treatment power in Yb3+–Er3+ codoped Gd2O3. 
It is natural to consider the factor that causes laser power-dependent upconversion luminescence. In Fig. S2a (ESI†), the UC luminescence patterns from Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ nanorods show a thermal radiation emission, and similar thermal radiation has been achieved in Y2O3:Er3+,Yb3+27 and (Gd,Yb,Er)2O3 with a surface decorated with AuNPs.28 When lanthanide ions are excited with intense laser power, the phonon coupling depletes a large portion of photon energy to locally heat some of the crystalline lattice atoms. This strongly implies that the mechanism behind the extraordinary laser-enhanced luminescence of Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ samples could be associated with the laser thermal effect, by taking account of the power-dependent luminescence improvement of Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ samples due to the laser thermal effect (LTE).
As a further proof, when the as-synthesized Gd2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ upconversion nanomaterials are transferred to water, the luminescence intensity has slightly decreased with the same power after treating at higher power (as shown in Fig. S4a–c, ESI†), which is consistent with a previous report.29 The thermal radiation emission did not occur at high power. This is because the laser thermo diffuses into water rather than gathers at one point. This further demonstrates that the fundamental reason for the enhancement of upconversion luminescence is the change of sample caused by the laser thermal effect. In a sensitizer–activator system, many factors including energy transfer probability, nonradiation probability and radiation probability affect upconversion luminescence emission. Complications in the current study could arise from two sources: one is that the nonradiation probability may be alleviated via enlarged particle size;30,31 the other is that the energy transfer probability could be tuned by the rearrangement of Yb3+ ions and Er3+ ions, and the schematic illustrating the laser synergic effect can be seen in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Schematic illustrating the laser synergic effect consisting of crystal morphology evolution and unlocking dark sensitizers enhances upconversion luminescence. 
In order to determine the effect of laser treatment on quenching molecules and upconversion fluorescence emission, FTIR spectra are acquired for the samples with and without laser treatment, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). From the FTIR spectra, peaks are observed at ∼1620, ∼2978, and 3000–3700 cm−1 that correspond to CO stretching, C–H stretching, and O–H stretching, respectively. The presence of peaks near 1400 and 1509 cm−1 indicates that O–H bending is present. A strong absorption band at 548 cm−1 is assigned to the Gd–O bond vibrations, which further verified the formation of Gd2O3, consistent with the XRD result. Apparently, compared with the sample annealed at 800 °C, no apparent change of the absorption vibration peak of quenched ions in the case of the laser treated sample is observed. This indicates that the laser annealing effect is weak when the sample annealed at 800 °C is irradiated by a laser.
Crystal morphology is essential to certain technological applications such as dye sensitized solar cells and in vitro biological applications.32,33 To better understand the relationship between crystal morphology and laser, the particle morphology as a function of laser treatment power is investigated using SEM. The SEM micrographs are presented in Fig. 5. It is clear from the SEM micrographs that crystal morphology changes significantly owning to laser treatment. Agglomeration occurs first by a roughening of the particle surface, followed by laser sintering, forming mesoporous particles, and finally by growth into larger, bulk sized interconnected networks of particles. As the laser treatment power rises, the surface of the particles begins to roughen and particles further agglomerate (Fig. 5a and b). When the laser treatment power is 1511 mW, the agglomerated nanoparticles fuse together to form mesoporous particles (Fig. 5c). On further increasing the laser treatment power to 1867 mW, the mesoporous particles grow into a macroporous bulk (Fig. 5d). It can be seen that the particles size increases as the laser treatment power increases, which leads to the reduction of the nonradiation probability and corresponding upconversion emission improvement. This change of material morphology induced by the laser thermal effect is not only beneficial for the upconversion fluorescence emission, but also promotes the practical application of materials in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. At the same time, it can be directly observed that the local distribution of rare earth ions increases after laser treatment compared with the raw sample (shown in Fig. 5e–h).

Actually, laser irradiation treatment also brings about a change of energy transfer. As can be seen from the above results, this phenomenon depends on the doped emitter (X3+) type and a low degree of energy level mismatches facilitates the improvement of upconversion emission. Thus, we can conclude that not only the morphology change induced by the laser can provide routes to boost fluorescence emission, but also laser treatment can unlock otherwise dark sensitizers to enhance the upconversion brightness. The laser thermal effect can shorten the average minimum distance between adjacent Ln3+ ions to boost energy transfer from different particles.34,35 The upconversion emission spectra of Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ with and without laser treatment at different Yb3+ concentrations are shown in Fig. S6a–d (ESI†). Fig. 6a and b show that laser treatment enhances the fluorescence emission at different Yb3+ concentrations (4% and 6%). It is obvious that a higher emission enhancement fold is achieved with an increase of Yb3+ concentration (Fig. 6c), which indicates that excitation irradiance treatment can unlock dark sensitizers to improve upconversion luminescence. In order to elucidate the upconversion emission enhancement induced by the increase of energy transfer, the emission spectra of Yb3+ (center at 975 nm) in the Gd2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles were also measured under 980 nm excitation before and after laser treatment. As shown in Fig. 6d, the luminescence spectra of Yb3+ at ∼975 nm decreased after laser irradiation treatment (power: 1867 mW). It is well known that the UCL in Gd2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ can be attributed to an energy transfer upconversion luminescence process. The Yb3+ ions absorb the excitation energy and jump to excited states, where they can relax to the ground state and transfer energy to Er3+ ions. Therefore, the laser-induced reduction of emission intensity of Yb3+ is mainly due to the increased energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+. Meanwhile, the Yb3+ emission lifetime (975 nm) is measured. As shown in Fig. 6, the Yb3+ decay curves could be described by a monoexponential decay function, and the emission lifetimes decrease after laser treatment. The lifetime of a raw sample is 217, 218, and 220 at the pump power 180, 269, and 357 mW, respectively (Fig. 6e). While the lifetime of the laser treated sample is 212, 216 and 218 at the pump power 180, 269, and 357 mW, respectively (Fig. 6f). The decrease of the Yb3+ fluorescence lifetime indicates that the energy transfer efficiency from Yb3+ to Er3+ increases after laser treatment. These results confirm that the laser-induced UCL enhancement of the UCNPs is related to the enhanced energy transfer caused by unlocking dark sensitizers.

To gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced upconversion luminescence, the upconversion emission mechanisms of Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ are investigated. The UC emission bands have been observed corresponding to the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (green), and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (red) transitions of Er3+. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the measured pump power dependences of green and red upconversion emission bands for the Gd2O3 nanocrystals doped with 1% Er3+ and 10% Yb3+. The number of photons required to populate the upper emitting state under unsaturated conditions can be derived from the relation. Iem ∝ Pn(1)where Iem is the upconversion luminescence intensity, P is the pump laser power, and n is the number of the pump photons. The slope (n values) for 523, 550 and 659 nm emission is 1.8, 1.1, and 0.5, respectively (Fig. S7a, ESI†). The n value of the 523 nm emission is 1.8, demonstrating the two-photon UC process in which two NIR excitation photons are absorbed to emit one. The n value of 550 nm emission is 1.1, which is inconsistent with the two photons required for generating 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 emission. It is known that, for intermediate pump powers, situations of competition between linear decay and upconversion are established; thus, the slope of the upconversion is dominated by two factors (linear decay and upconversion process).36 When upconversion luminescence is excited by sequential absorption and energy transfer upconversion of n photons, its dependence on the absorbed pump power P decreases from n down to 1 as long as the upconversion rate well exceeds the decay rate for the intermediate states. Thus, the low n value (1.1) at 550 nm and for green UC luminescence is owing to the competition of linear decay and the upconversion process. The n value for red UC emission peaking at 659 nm is 0.5, which is less than 1 due to the thermal effect and the competition between linear decay and the upconversion process. As seen from Fig. 2b, the red upconversion luminescence quickly reaches saturation. When the power is higher than 180 mW, the red up-conversion luminescence decreases with the increase of pump power due to the thermal effect. Thus, not only the competition of linear decay and the upconversion process, but also the thermal effect causes the low n value for red UC luminescence.
It is found that the slope values of the sample treated at high power (1867 mW) are 1.6, 0.9 and 0.8 corresponding to the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (green), and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (red) transitions of Er3+, respectively (shown in Fig. S7b, ESI†). It should be noted that the n value for green UC luminescence corresponding to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition decreases for the sample treated with high power, indicating that the upconversion process (ETU) is enhanced accompanied by a decrease in the linear decay due to the increased energy transfer from sensitizer to activator. Meanwhile, the red UC emission n value increased for the sample treated with high power owing to the alleviated thermal effect. The change in photon number before and after laser irradiation further proves that high laser power treatment not only improves energy transfer but also alleviates the thermal effect on upconversion luminescence.
3.3 Emission color tuning of Er–Yb co-doped UCNPs
More careful inspection of the measured luminescence spectra reveals that the relative intensity of the green and red UC emissions also changes with the pump power. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the red to green ratio of UC luminescence (RGR) of Gd2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ decreases with increasing pump power and is about 6.3 times higher under excitation at the pump power of 2 mW than under excitation at the pump power of 357 mW. As a result, the increasing of pump power leads to remarkably weakened red emission and enhanced brightness of green emission, resulting in the color change of the UC luminescence patterns. Based on the above UC emission spectral data, for Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles, the corresponding color coordinates are calculated and the variation of UC luminescence color points as a function of the pump power is illustrated in the 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram. The chromaticity coordinates in the 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram are approximately (0.5535, 0.4408) at 2 mW, and shifted to (0.2899, 0.6771) at 357 mW. As shown in Fig. 7a, in an Er3+/Yb3+co-doped system, the UC luminescence color can be finely tuned from red through yellow and finally to the green region by increasing the pump power. Correspondingly, the color shift can be quantifiably described by the chromaticity shift (ΔC) according to the following equation.37 (2)where μ′ = 4x/(3 − 2x + 12y), v′ = 9y/(3 − 2x + 12y), and w′ = 1 − μ′ − v′. μ′ and v′ are the chromaticity coordinates in CIE 1931 uniform color space, and o and t represent the color coordinates at power 2 mW and a given power. The chromaticity shift (ΔC) at 357 mW is calculated to be ∼0.076 for the Er3+/Yb3+ Gd2O3 upconversion nanoparticles. It is worth noting that the RGR of the sample treated with high laser power achieves 46.3-fold improvement under excitation at the pump power of 2 mW than under excitation at the pump power of 1156 mW. At the same time, the corresponding RGR changes from 25.5 to 0.6 with the increment of pump power, implying a marked enhancement of color range and color purity. The calculated CIE chromaticity coordinates for high laser treated Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ nanocrystals, given in Table S1 (ESI†), show that their UC emission can be finely tuned from red through yellow and finally to the green region by increasing the pump power. Simultaneously, bright red, green and yellow light can be observed in the process of power adjustment (see Fig. 7b). The chromaticity coordinates shift from (0.6242, 0.3663) to (0.237, 0.771) over the power range of 2–1156 mW, and the corresponding chromaticity shift (ΔC) is ∼0.1832, which is larger than that of the Er3+/Yb3+ UCNPs. Moreover, the UCL color shifting can be directly achieved via simple power regulation. As shown in Fig. 7a, the sample color shifts from the initial red to green with the laser pump increase. After laser irradiation treatment, more obvious color change from bright red to bright green can be found (Fig. 7b). These results suggest that multicolor-tunable emissions make these luminescent nanoparticles good candidates for anti-counterfeiting and security applications, optoelectronic devices, and display systems.
 Fig. 7  Power-dependence of the CIE coordinates of (a) Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ samples and (b) Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ samples treated with a 1867 mW laser. The insets show photographs of the raw sample and laser treated sample under 980 nm excitation at various powers. 
Taking advantage of their laser-sensitized optical properties, the Yb3+,Er3+ codoped Gd2O3 can be utilized for anti-counterfeiting applications. Moreover, the preparation method of patterns is quite simple without the need for complex processes. As an example, a H-type character appears on a sample piece by laser-writing (Fig. 8a). When exposed to 980 nm laser beams (2 mW), a clear character with a bright red emission is observed, and no light could be discerned on the sample without laser treatment (Fig. 8b). This laser-responsive color enhancement characteristic can provide added security protection and help to construct more secure patterns. At the same time, when the sample irradiated by the emission red/green light originated from Gd2O3:Yb3+,Er3+, a H-type red light emission also can be seen by the naked eye (Fig. 8c and d). A HIT-type pattern is also obtained simply by laser treatment (Fig. 8e). Utilizing the laser-sensitized upconversion ability of UCNCs, an obvious HIT pattern is observed with a 980 nm laser beams. And the HIT pattern emission color change from yellow to red was found with the change of laser power (Fig. 8f and g). When the sample was irradiated at some point, a red HIT pattern also can be clearly observed (as shown in Fig. 8h and l). To further research the application value of these laser sensitive materials in anti-counterfeiting, the material is placed under white paper, wherein the sample and HIT pattern cannot be seen (Fig. 8i). Interestingly, the pattern of red “HIT” appeared on the paper when excited by a 980 nm laser source, and the brightness of the red “HIT” pattern can be turned via adjusting the laser power (Fig. 8j and k). Light brightness changing and multicolor shifting of the Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Gd2O3 UCNPs can be simply realized by adjusting the pump power of a commercially available laser and is easily recognized by the naked eye for visual authentication, leading these UCNPs to be highly promising for anti-counterfeiting applications.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a novel strategy to significantly enhance the upconversion luminescence of nanocrystals, by a laser synergistic effect. The feasible laser treatment enables the realization of emission enhancement, power saturation alleviation and flexible color tuning in upconversion emission through adjusting the pump power. The maximum enhancement factors for the green, and the red luminescence of the UC nanocrystals upon excitation at 980 nm are found to be 208, and 410, occurring at a laser treatment power of 1867 mW. In the meantime, the overall emission color can be tuned from deep red to bright green by increasing the power from 2 to 1156 mW. These experimental observations have been well interpreted, which reveals that the laser synergistic effect of crystal morphology evolution and energy transfer enhancement is responsible for these experimental observations. Furthermore, this work presents a feasible approach for achieving emission enhancement and color shifting in lanthanide-based upconversion systems via laser power, making them very attractive for producing more secure anti-counterfeiting patterns.
