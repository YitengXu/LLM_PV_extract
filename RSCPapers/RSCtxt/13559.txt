    , Accepted 27th April 2022First published on 27th April 2022AbstractWe present a new solar absorber material – quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey quantum dots (QDs) – with a band gap Eg tunable over a broad range of 1.5–2.4 eV. PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs were prepared using a two-step cation/anion co-alloying approach: first, Pb2+ was incorporated into the binary CdS host by cation exchange, leading to ternary PbxCd1−xS QDs. Second, Se2− replaced a fraction of S2− in PbxCd1−xS by anion exchange, leading to quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs. The reactions reduced the Eg from 2.42 (CdS, absorption onset 500 nm) to 1.91 (PbxCd1−xS, 650 nm) to 1.55 eV (PbxCd1−xS1−ySey, 800 nm). The Eg of PbxCd1−xS1−ySey (1.55 eV) is close to the Shockley–Queisser gap. Solid-state PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QD solar cells (QDSCs) were fabricated with Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport material. The best cell (Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18) yielded Jsc = 13.71 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, FF = 54.8% and PCE = 4.43% under 1 sun. At low light intensities, the PCE increased to 7.18% under 10% sun and further to 9.24% under 1% sun. The co-alloying treatment improved the PCE from 4.49 (CdS) to 8.48 (PbxCd1−xS) to 9.24% (Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18) under 1% sun. The cell with a PCE of 9.24% can be categorized as a high-efficiency QDSC, suggesting that PbxCd1−xS1−ySey can be an efficient solar absorber.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) are a potential candidate for the next generation of low-cost alternatives to photovoltaic devices based on silicon. The key component of a QDSC is a mesoporous photoanode coated with a layer of light-absorbing nanoparticle sensitizer. The employment of inorganic semiconductor QDs as light sensitizers has the advantages of tunable band gap Eg due to the quantum size effect,1 large optical absorption coefficient, and multiple exciton generation by a single photon.2,3 A good light absorber material should have two important physical properties: a 1.2–1.4 eV band gap that matches the Shockley–Queisser limit and large optical absorption coefficients.4 Other properties such as direct band gap, earth abundance, and cost should also be considered. Binary metal sulfides M–S (M: metal, S: sulfur), such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, PbSe, Sb2S3, and Ag2S,5–10 have so far been the most widely studied QD sensitizers due to the ease of material preparation. In contrast, ternary and quaternary metal sulfides have been less explored because the materials are generally more difficult to grow. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of QDSCs based on single-layered binary M–S QDs are low, typically 3–5%,11–13 because their Egs are usually too large, and the optical absorption range narrow. Co-sensitization using two types of QDs such as CdS/CdSe can expand the absorption band and improve the PCE to 5–6%.12–16 To date, the best PCE of QDSCs was obtained in a perovskite system with a PCE of 16.6%.17 The next highest PCE was achieved in the widely studied Cu–In–Se (CISe) system (including Zn–Cu–In–Se) with PCEs in the range of 13–15%.18–20 Colloidal PbS QDSCs yielded a PCE of ∼10–12%.21,22 The anion alloyed ternary metal sulfide CdSe1−x yielded a PCE near 9%.23,24 According to the published photovoltaic data in several review articles,12,13,16 a cell with a PCE of over 8% can be categorized as a high-efficiency QDSC.
In addition to co-sensitization with two binary QDs, the optical absorption bands of metal sulfides can be tuned by three strategies: doping, composition control, and manufacturing nanostructures. Among the three strategies, composition control is probably the most effective method. The bandgaps of metal sulfides can be tuned by changing the compositions (and stoichiometries) of cation constituents in cation alloyed metal sulfides, anion constituents in anion alloyed metal sulfides, or anion and cation constituents simultaneously in anion–cation alloyed metal sulfides. For example, the Eg of the cation alloyed semiconductor ZnxCd1−xS can be tuned in the spectral range of 2.6–3.2 eV by changing the Zn cation content from x = 0.10 to 0.53.25 The Eg of anion alloyed metal sulfide PbSxSe1−x can be tuned from 1.07 to 1.39 eV by controlling the amounts of the S and Se anions.26
Much work on band gap engineering has been devoted to tuning the band gap of metal sulfides. However, there is a complication—a lowering in Eg is usually accompanied by a lower Voc because Voc is proportional to Eg, as explained in the basic theory of solar cells, namely Jsc and Voc change in the opposite directions; an enhanced Jsc does not guarantee a higher PCE. Hence, in the search for a suitable material for band gap engineering, it is preferable to choose a starting semiconductor with a high Voc, which could reduce the effect of a loss in Voc due to a lower band gap Eg. A possible candidate is the binary cadmium sulfide CdS – one of the most widely studied binary semiconductors. CdS has a band gap of Eg = 2.4 eV (500 nm),27 significantly larger than the Shockley–Queisser gap. The large Eg produces a small absorption band, a small photocurrent Jsc (typically ∼10 mA cm−2), and a low PCE (∼2–3%).12,13 However, an advantage of CdS is that it has an open-circuit voltage of ∼0.6 V, a relatively large photovoltage among all QDSCs.
In our previous work, the binary CdS was chosen as the starting material for band gap engineering.28 The Eg of CdS was tuned by applying the partial cation exchange strategy. According to the collected data of several semiconductors in a textbook,29Eg is roughly inversely proportional to the lattice constant. Substituting an element of a semiconductor with a larger element will increase the lattice constant and result in a lower Eg.29 Humayun et al. reported that the Eg in InxGa1−xN decreased from 3.4 to 0.7 eV upon replacing Ga3+ (62 pm) with a larger In3+ (80 pm).30 In the cation exchange process, the Pb2+ cation (ionic radius: 119 pm) was incorporated into the binary CdS (Cd2+ ionic radius: 95 pm), replacing a fraction of the Cd2+ cation and forming the ternary alloyed semiconductor PbxCd1−xS. The Pb incorporation reduced the Eg from 2.44 eV for CdS to 1.73 eV for PbxCd1−xS and increased the absorption band from 300–500 nm (CdS) to 300–720 nm (PbxCd1−xS). As a result, the PCE of PbxCd1−xS QDSCs achieved an impressive value of 8.5% under 1% sun,28 which is a factor of two larger than that of the CdS host. However, the Eg of PbxCd1−xS (1.7 eV) is still slightly higher than the ideal Shockley–Queisser gap of ∼1.2–1.4 eV, suggesting room for further improvement. Relevant work on liquid-junction PbxCd1−xS QDSCs has been reported by Yuan D. et al. and Yuan C. et al. with respective PCEs of 5.3% and 3.2% in two separate papers.31,32
In this work, Eg is tuned by cation/anion co-alloying through controlling the compositions of the cation/anion constituents using the ion exchange approach. A fraction of the cation in CdS is first replaced by the Pb2+ cation, forming the ternary alloyed semiconductor PbxCd1−xS. Next, a fraction of the S2− anion (ionic radius 184 pm) is replaced by the Se2− anion (ionic radius 198 pm), forming a quaternary alloyed semiconductor, PbxCd1−xS1−ySey. Our theoretical calculations on the bulk band structures of PbxCd1−xS1−ySey predict a decreasing Eg with increasing Se content due to increasing hybridization of Cd/Se wavefunctions. We investigate the dependence of the photovoltaic performance of solid-state PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDSCs on Se composition y and sun intensity. The cation/anion co-alloying reduces the Eg from 2.40 (CdS) to 1.55 eV (PbxCd1−xS1−ySey). The best PbxCd1−xS1−ySey cell achieves a PCE of 9.24% (1% sun), a ∼9% increase over the ternary PbxCd1−xS and a factor of two larger than that of the CdS host. This work demonstrates that the simultaneous band gap engineering of cation/anion constituents in the CdS system is highly effective in expanding the optical absorption band and increasing efficiency.
2. Experimental

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic structure of a PbxCd1−xS1−ySey solar cell containing four components: a blocking layer, a TiO2 photoanode, a solid electrolyte, and an Au cathode. The preparation of each component is described in detail below.

2.1 Blocking layer and TiO2 photoanode
A blocking layer can reduce the recombination of photocarriers in the photoanode and the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. The TiO2 blocking layer, having thickness of ∼100 nm, was prepared using the hot spray pyrolysis method by spraying a 0.2 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (C16H28O6Ti) ethanol solution on a pre-patterned FTO substrate (7 Ω per square, Pilkington) placed on a 500 °C hot plate. Next, a mesoporous TiO2 active sensitizer layer (mp-TiO2) was prepared by spin coating a 75 μl TiO2 solution, prepared by mixing 0.2 g of commercial transparent anatase TiO2 paste (particle size ∼30 nm, Greatcell Energy 30 NR-T) with 0.5 g of ethanol, on top of the blocking layer, followed by heating on a hot plate at 125 °C for 5 min. Finally, the mp-TiO2 substrate was annealed in a furnace in the air at 500 °C for 20 min. The resultant mp-TiO2 thickness was ∼1 μm.
2.2 Synthesis of PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs
Quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs were synthesized using a two-step ion-exchange process: first, the Cd2+ cation in the binary CdS was partially replaced by Pb2+via cation exchange, forming ternary PbxCd1−xS QDs. Next, a second partial anion exchange was performed where the S2− anion in PbxCd1−xS was partially replaced by Se2−, forming quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs.

2.2.1 Step 1: synthesis of ternary PbxCd1−xS QDs. 
The cation substitution strategy was applied to the starting material CdS. The PbxCd1−xS growth consisted of a two-step SILAR process: (a) growth of PbS QDs, and (b) growth of CdS QDs on top of the PbS QDs. Post annealing converts the double-layered PbS/CdS structure into the ternary PbxCd1−xS phase. The order of the SILAR process is important – the PbS layer must be deposited before the CdS layer to produce the correct ternary crystalline phase. A PbS SILAR process was performed by immersing an mp-TiO2 electrode into a 25 °C, 0.1 M PbNO3 aqueous solution for 30 s, rinsed in DI water, and then dried at 65 °C in air. This process produced Pb2+ ions on the TiO2 electrode. Afterward, it was immediately immersed into a 25 °C, 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O methanol solution for 30 s, and dried in the air as above. This process produced S2− ions. This two-stage dipping process formed one PbS SILAR cycle. The PbS SILAR cycles were repeated m times (referred to as PbS(m)) to obtain the desired amount of PbS QD material on the TiO2 electrode. For the CdS SILAR cycle, the PbS QD-coated TiO2 electrode was dipped into a 25 °C, 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution for 60 s, then dipped into a 25 °C, 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O methanol solution for 60 s, and finally rinsed and dried as above. The dipping process formed one CdS SILAR cycle. The CdS SILAR cycles were repeated n times (referred to as CdS(n)). Post annealing at 200 °C for 20 min in an N2 flowing furnace converted the PbS(m)/CdS(n) double-layered structure to the ternary PbxCd1−xS phase. The Pb content x was controlled by changing the number of PbS SILAR cycles m.


2.2.2 Stage 2: synthesis of quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs. 
The anion substitution strategy partially replaced the S2− anion in PbxCd1−xS with Se2−. Before the Se2− exchange reaction, a Se solution was first prepared by mixing 0.30 g of NaBH4 and 0.36 g of Se powder in 125 ml ethanol in a flowing N2 atmosphere to prevent oxidation, and then stirred until the solution became colorless. The PbxCd1−xS-coated TiO2 electrode was dipped into the Se solution to conduct the Se ion-exchange reaction. The Se content y was controlled by employing various Se dipping times of 0, 15, 20, 25, and 30 s. Lastly, the Se-treated samples were annealed at various high temperatures of 150, 200, 250, and 300 °C to produce the desired quaternary phase. Subsequent photovoltaic measurements revealed the optimal Se dipping time and annealing temperature to be 15 s and 200 °C, respectively.

2.3 Assembly of solar cells
The PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QD-coated TiO2 photoanode was fabricated into a solid-state solar cell configuration using Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transporting material (HTM). The HTM was prepared by dissolving 0.034 g of Spiro-OMeTAD in 190 μl of chlorobenzene, 12.25 μl of 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) and 7.5 μl of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, and then stirred vigorously at 50 °C. 70 μl of HTM was dropped on top of the PbxCd1−xS1−ySey anode and left it sit in the air for 60 s, followed by spinning at 2000 rpm for 30 s to allow the HTM to penetrate the pores of the TiO2 electrode completely. An Au film of thickness 100 nm was sputtered onto the cell to function as the cathode. A cell contained three rectangular active areas with dimensions of 3 mm × 3 mm (Fig. 1, left figure). Fig. 1(b) shows the SEM cross-sectional image of a fabricated solar cell, revealing the thickness of each layer: 119 nm (blocking layer), 1.08 μm (QD active layer), and 198 nm (HTM layer).
2.4 Material characterization and photovoltaic measurements
The purity and structures of the synthesized QDs were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). XRD patterns were scanned using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MRD diffractometer operating at 200 kV. Cross-sectional SEM images were recorded and EDS analysis was performed using a JEOL JSM-7800F Prime Schottky field-emission scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV. TEM images were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2010 Scanning Image Observation microscope operating at 200 kV. XPS spectra for chemical analysis were recorded using a ULVAC-PHI 500 (Versa Probe II) with Ar heat treatment. Optical absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi 2800A spectrophotometer. Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a 150 W Oriel Xe lamp coupled with an Oriel AM 1.5 simulating filter. Multiple metal meshes were inserted in the light path to vary the light intensity from 100 to 1 mW cm−2 (i.e., 1 to 0.01 sun). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded using an Acton monochromator with a 250 W tungsten-halogen lamp. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded using a Bio-Logic SAS SP-150 potentiostat with a maximum power of 65 W and a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution was used as a supporting electrolyte.
2.5 Theoretical calculation method
We computed electronic structures using the projector augmented wave33,34 method as implemented in the VASP package35 within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) scheme.36 Experimental lattice constants were used. A 7 × 7 × 5 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used in the computations. The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects were included in calculations self-consistently. We performed calculations with the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional37 to accurately estimate the energy band gap. To systematically calculate the evolution of band structure with finite Pb and Se doping contents, we constructed tight-binding matrices for CdS, PbS, CdSe, and PbSe, where the tight-binding model matrix elements were calculated by projecting onto the Wannier orbitals,38,39 which used the VASP2WANNIER90 interface.40 We used Cd (Pb) s and p orbitals and S (Se) p orbitals to construct Wannier functions without maximizing the localization procedure. Linear interpolating tight-binding model matrix elements were used to calculate the samples' electronic structure with finite doping. Since tight-binding parameters contained all vital information such as lattice constants and atomic bonding strengths, an interpolation presumably covered all systematic changes of the electronic structure between the two end materials.
3. Results and discussion
The results of ternary PbxCd1−xS QDs have been reported in a previous paper.28 Here we will focus on the material and photovoltaic properties of quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs.
3.1 Theoretical results
To deepen our understanding of the evolution of the band structures as a function of Se doping, we performed first-principles calculations on the bulk band structures based on the GGA with HSE correction, as shown in Fig. 2. Our calculation reveals an insulating ground state in CdS with a 2.2 eV direct energy band gap (Eg) at the Γ point, in good agreement with our experimental observations (Fig. 2(a)). We also calculated the band structure of CdSe by assuming the same crystal structure of CdS. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the band gap decreases while the bandwidth increases compared with CdS. To reveal the nature of the Se doping on the band structure of CdS1−ySey, we calculated the real space charge density distribution of Cd and S (Se) along the z-axis (Fig. 2(c)). The ratio of the overlapping area between Cd and S (Se) represents the hybridization strength of the wavefunction of the two elements. Our results show that the proportion of hybridization in CdSe is higher than that of CdS. Consequently, the hopping strength increases in CdS1−ySey with increasing Se doping concentration, resulting in a wider energy bandwidth in CdSe. In addition, a wider energy band indicates that the system is closer to a metal state. The bandwidth of the valence band and the conduction band increases simultaneously, leading to a smaller energy gap in CdSe. The schematic of the evolution of band gap and bandwidth is shown in Fig. 2(d). Fig. 2(e) shows the dependence of Eg on Se content y at the Γ point. The red square and blue dot symbols correspond to the experimental measurements and our theoretical results, respectively. For simplicity, we fixed the Pb content at x = 0.15, giving Pb0.15Cd0.85S1−ySey. It can be seen that the calculated and measured results show a consistent trend for Se content up to y = 0.25. The Eg decreases linearly in the low-doped region and exhibits a sudden change near y = 0.18. It is also noteworthy that the lattice effect is not a major effect that modifies the band gap. The band gap decreases slightly as the lattice constants of Pb0.15Cd0.85S increase (green triangle in Fig. 2(e)).

The green triangle indicates the Eg value as a function of lattice constants of Pb0.15Cd0.85S. 
3.2 Energy dispersive X-ray analysis
The atomic composition of PbxCd1−xS1−ySey is expected to change with selenization time. Here, the atomic compositions of various selenized PbxCd1−xS1−ySey samples were determined using EDS measurements. Table 1 lists the EDS data of the host material PbxCd1−xS and four PbxCd1−xS1−ySey samples prepared with selenization times of 10, 20, 25, and 30 s, respectively. The host material PbxCd1−xS, prepared with SILAR cycles of PbS(3)/CdS(7), had atomic percentages of 7.55% (Pb), 45.51% (Sb), and 46.94% (S) and the chemical formula of Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88 (sample no. 1, x = 0.14). The number of S atoms is 0.88 (below the integer value of 1), indicating some vacancies in the S lattice sites. For the four selenized samples PbxCd1−xS1−ySey (sample no. 2–5), the Se content y increased monotonically from 0.15 to 0.22 as the reaction time increased from 15 to 30 s. Meanwhile, the S content decreased from 0.85 to 0.78. The result indicates that a fraction of S atoms (15–22%) has been replaced by Se atoms. The four Se-treated samples have the chemical formulae Pb0.13Cd0.77S0.85Se0.15, Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18, Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.80Se0.20, and Pb0.11Cd0.72S0.78Se0.22, respectively.

3.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD)

Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD patterns of five PbxCd1−xS1−ySey samples with different Se reaction times and Se content y. To clearly show the change due to Se reaction, Fig. 3(b) compares the XRD spectra of the ternary host Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88 (sample no. 1, black line) and the Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 sample (sample no. 3, y = 0.18, Se-reaction: 20 s, red line). The host sample Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88 (without selenization) retains the hexagonal structure of the parent semiconductor CdS (bottom panel, JCPDS: 00-041-1049). Several large peaks are observed due to the TiO2 film and FTO (SnO2) substrate (* symbol). The PbxCd1−xS spectrum does not show any peak associated with the binary PbS phase from the SILAR process (bottom panel), indicating that the Pb2+ cation has been incorporated into the CdS lattice without forming a second binary PbS phase. The Se-exchanged Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 sample shows a similar XRD pattern to the host PbxCd1−xS. No other impurity phases are observed except a small peak at 29.70° that is attributed to the (101) plane of the unreacted Se source material. Careful examination of the spectra shows that the XRD angles of the PbxCd1−xS1−ySey sample are downshifted relative to those of the host PbxCd1−xS. Fig. 3(c) shows the enlarged (110) peaks of the five selenized samples with various Se content y. Table 2 list the angles for the (110) and (002) peaks. The angle decreases monotonically with increasing Se content y. For example, the (110) peak decreases from 43.87° (Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88) to 43.34° (Pb0.11Cd0.72S0.78Se0.22). A similar trend is also observed in the (002) peak. The decreasing angle indicates an expansion in the lattice. The lattice constants a, b, and c of the five PbxCd1−xS1−ySey samples were calculated from the XRD data using the theoretical equations for the hexagonal lattice. The calculated lattice constants and unit cell volume are listed in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 3(d) and (e). As seen, the lattice constants a and c both increase with increasing Se content y. The unit cell volume increases from 98.67 × 106 to 101.24 × 106 pm3, an increase of 2.6%, as Se content y increases from 0 to 0.22. The substitution of S by the larger Se atom results in larger lattice constants and a unit cell volume. The dependence of the lattice constants a and c on Se content y follows the equations below: a = 4.1204 + 0.2065y,(1) c = 6.6740 + 0.2136y.(2)

3.4 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The morphology and structure of the synthesized materials were investigated using TEM. Fig. 4(a) shows a TEM image of a bare TiO2 film. The TiO2 NPs are rectangular with a length of ∼30 nm. The lattice fringes (interplanar spacing d = 0.345 nm, as shown in the inset) correspond to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. Fig. 4(b) shows an image of the ternary Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88 QDs (prepared with SILAR cycles of PbS(3)/CdS(7)). The Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88 QDs, marked by red arrows, are randomly deposited on top of the TiO2 surface without observable aggregation. The lattice fringes (d spacing = 0.211 nm, see the inset) are assigned to the (110) plane of hexagonal Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88. The particle size is in the range of 12–15 nm with an average diameter of 14 nm. Fig. 4(c) shows a TEM image of Se-exchanged Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 QDs (sample no. 3 in Table 1, preparation condition: SILAR cycles PbS(3)/CdS(7), selenization time: 20 s). The QDs are seen to be distributed randomly on TiO2, much like in the case of the host Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88 QDs. The d spacing for the (110) plane of the Se-reacted sample is 0.224 nm (inset), which is larger than that (0.211 nm) of the host material. The increased d spacing is a consequence of replacing S with a larger Se atom. Fig. 4(d) shows a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the selenized Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 sample. Analysis of the SAED pattern revealed that the sample has the hexagonal structure of the host Pb–Cd–S material with the associated (hkl) indices labeled in the figure. The SAED result is in good agreement with the XRD result shown in Fig. 3(b). The SAED pattern shows the diffraction signals associated with the Se element, marked as yellow arrows. They are attributable to some unreacted Se material. Fig. 4(e)–(h) display the images of elemental mapping for Pb, Cd, S, and Se, respectively. As seen, all four elements are distributed over the whole area of the sample. Moreover, the incorporated Se element is seen to be distributed over the whole area without significant variations in density, indicating the successful incorporation of Se into the host material. Finally, the mapping signal intensity of S is significantly larger than that of Se, indicating an elemental percentage of S much larger than that of the Se element, which agrees with the EDS elemental ratios shown in Table 1.

3.5 Optical spectra
Optical measurements were performed to investigate the band gap Eg and optical absorption coefficient α of the synthesized materials. Fig. 5(a) shows the transmission spectra T(λ) of five PbxCd1−xS1−ySey samples with various Se contents y. T(λ) decreases with increasing Se content, indicating increasing optical absorption as more Se2− anions replace S2−. Fig. 5(b) shows the optical absorbance spectra A(λ) where A(λ) = −log10T(λ). A(λ) exhibits a significant increase with increasing Se content y. For example, A increases from 0.50 (y = 0) to 1.31 (y = 0.22) at λ = 700 nm, a nearly three-fold increase. Fig. 5(c) shows the Tauc plots (Ahν)2vs. hν of the five samples. Eg can be estimated by extrapolating the Tauc curve to the x-axis. Analysis of the Tauc plots yields Eg = 1.91 (y = 0), 1.74 (y = 0.15), 1.65 (y = 0.18), 1.59 (y = 0.20) and 1.55 eV (y = 0.22), respectively. Fig. 5(d) displays the dependence of Eg on Se content y. The Eg decreases from 1.91 (λ = 650 nm) to 1.55 eV (λ = 800 nm) as y increases from 0 to 0.22. The decreasing Eg results in a broader optical absorption range. Notably, the Eg of 1.55 eV is slightly higher than the optimal Eg (∼1.2–1.4 eV) required for the Shockley–Queisser limit. The optical results show that the Se replacement results in (i) a broader optical absorption band and (ii) larger absorption coefficients. They are two important advantages for a solar absorber.

3.6 Cyclic voltammetry measurements
The band gap and band alignment of PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs with various Se content y were determined by CV measurements. Fig. 6(a), top panel, shows the CV curves of four PbxCd1−xS1−ySey samples with various Se content y. For comparison, the CV curves of the host CdS and ternary Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88 QDs are shown at the bottom panel. Fig. 6(b) shows the enlarged half-wave oxidation potential curves for four PbxCd1−xS1−ySey samples. The inset shows the enlarged curves for CdS and Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88. Similarly, Fig. 6(c) shows the enlarged curves of the reduction potential of four of the PbxCd1−xS1−ySey samples. The valence band level EVB and conduction band level ECB were calculated from the CV curves using eqn (3) and (4), respectively, EVB = −Ec = −e(Eoxonset + 4.71),(3) ECB = −Ea = −e(Eredonset + 4.71),(4)where Eoxonset and Eredonset, marked as red arrows in the figure, are the energy of the oxidation reaction and reduction reaction with step onset, respectively. The calculated ECB level, EVB level, and Eg as a function of Se content y are listed in Table 3. The energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 6(d). As the Se content y increases, the conduction band level ECB stays roughly unchanged (∼−4.34 eV) whereas the valence band level increases monotonically from −6.15 (y = 0) to −5.88 eV (y = 0.22), leading to a decreasing Eg from 1.93 (y = 0) to 1.57 eV (y = 0.22). For comparison, Table 3 (right column) also lists the Eg deduced from optical measurements shown in Fig. 5. The CV-deduced Egs are in good agreement with those deduced from optical measurements.

3.7 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
The chemical composition, material purity, and valence states of the elements in the selenized sample Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 (sample no. 3) with the best photovoltaic performance were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 7(a) shows the survey spectrum, indicating the presence of four constituent elements: Pb 4f, Cd 3d, S 2p, and Se 3d. No other impurities are observed in the spectrum. The Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 peaks located at 136.7 and 141.6 eV with a spin–orbit separation of 4.84 eV can be assigned to the Pb2+ cation of the Pb–Sb–S–Se phase (Fig. 7(b)).41Fig. 7(c) shows the Cd 3d binding energies of 404.1 and 410.9 eV for Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, separated by 6.7 eV, confirming the bivalent oxidation state for cadmium.42,43 The XPS peaks of S 2p, as illustrated in Fig. 7(d) with binding energies at 160.5 and 161.5 eV, correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, with a slight difference of 1 eV.44 This indicates the presence of divalent S2− ions in the lattice. The single peak at 53.2 eV of Fig. 7(e) corresponds to the Se 3d binding energy.45

3.8 Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of a SILAR-prepared QDSC depends strongly on the number of SILAR cycles. A low SILAR number deposits insufficient QD material on the photoanode, leading to incomplete solar light harvesting. A SILAR number too large over-deposits the photoanode, reducing the porous spaces within the mesoporous TiO2 electrode and leading to incomplete filling of the Spiro-OMeTAD electrolyte, which increases the resistance to carrier transport, also resulting in low performance. There is an optimal number of SILAR cycles for each sample. Since a two-stage process was used to prepare the PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs, the optimal number of SILAR cycles needs to be determined by a two-step process: (a) finding the optimal number of SILAR cycles in the ternary PbxCd1−xS QDSCs by controlling the content of cation constituents Pb/Cd and (b) finding the optimal number of SILAR cycles for quaternary ternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey by controlling the content of anion constituent S/Se. The results for each step are presented below.

3.8.1 Stage I: photovoltaic performance of ternary PbxCd1−xS QDSCs. 
In this step, Pb was incorporated into CdS to form PbxCd1−xS QDs. The Eg was tuned by controlling the content of the Pb cation. As described in the Experimental section, the PbxCd1−xS QDs were formed from the double-layer structure of PbS(m)/CdS(n). Two SILAR numbers are involved: m for PbS and n for CdS. As reported previously, the optimal SILAR number for CdS was n = 7.28 To find the optimal SILAR number m for PbS, four PbxCd1−xS samples with different Pb content x were prepared with various numbers of PbS SILAR cycles (m = 1–4) while keeping the CdS SILAR number fixed at n = 7. Fig. 8(a) displays the I–V curves of the four ternary PbxCd1−xS QDSCs measured under 1 sun illumination. Table 4 (top panel) lists the photovoltaic data. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was low (2.14%) for the low PbS SILAR cycle (m = 1). The PCE increased with increasing m, reaching a maximal value of 3.31% at m = 3, then decreasing again to 2.18% at m = 4. The results indicated that the optimal number of PbS SILAR cycles is m = 3, so the best number of SILAR cycles for PbxCd1−xS is PbS(3)/CdS(7). According to the EDS data in Table 1, this best sample has a Pb content of x = 0.14 with the chemical formula of Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88.

3.8.2 Stage II: photovoltaic performance of quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDSCs. 
In this step, PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDs were prepared by partial substitution of the S anion in PbxCd1−xS with Se. The Se content y was varied by controlling the Se reaction time. The optimal ternary PbxCd1−xS QDs with SILAR cycles of PbS(3)/CdS(7) underwent Se exchange with various reaction times of 0, 15, 20, 25, and 30 s. The Se content y increased from 0.15 to 0.22 as the Se reaction time increased from 0 to 30 s, as revealed in the EDS data. Fig. 8(b) shows the I–V curves of five quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDSCs with various Se reaction times and Se content y. Table 4, bottom panel, lists the photovoltaic data. The PCE initially increased with increasing Se reaction time. The cell with a 20 s reaction time yielded the best PCE of 4.43% (sample no. 3), which is 34% larger than that (3.31%) of the ternary PbxCd1−xS host (sample 1, 0 s, unreacted) cell. The optimal sample treated with 20 s selenization has a Se content of y = 0.18 and a chemical formula of Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18. The optimal cell has the photovoltaic parameters of a short circuit current density Jsc of 13.71 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage Voc of 0.59 V, and a fill factor FF of 54.8%. The increase in PCE in the Se-treated sample arises mainly from Jsc, which increased from 8.32 (sample no. 1, no selenization) to 13.71 mA cm−2 (sample no. 3, 20 s Se treatment), a significant enhancement of 65%. The large increase in Jsc is attributed to the decreased Eg following Se incorporation, which leads to a broader optical absorption band and a higher Jsc.
Carrier recombination is a significant problem in QDSCs prepared by the SILAR method. Measuring I–V curves under reduced light intensities can improve performance and reveal the maximum PCE that a QDSC can achieve. The improved PCE under reduced light intensities is because the generation of photoelectrons is more efficient under reduced light. Fig. 8(c) displays the I–V curves of the best Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 QDSC under various reduced light intensities from 1 to 0.01 sun. Table 5 lists the photovoltaic data. The PCE increased from 4.43% (1 sun) to 7.18% (0.1 sun) and further increased to 9.24% at the lowest light intensity of 0.01 sun. In addition, FF increased monotonically from 54.8 to 61.0% (1 sun); Voc decreased monotonically from 0.59 to 0.53 V (1 sun). The cell with the best efficiency of 9.24% herein can be categorized as a high-efficiency QDSC, aside from the widely studied perovskite and CISe systems.

The improved performance under reduced sun intensities is attributed to the reduction in carrier recombination. Semiconductor QDs synthesized by the SILAR method usually contain many surface defects, which act as recombination centers for electron–hole recombination. The multiple trapping model for carrier recombination, in which carriers are trapped and detrapped repeatedly from trap sites, predicts a sublinear Jscvs. light intensity I0 power law: Jsc ∝ I0α (α < 1).46,47 Franco et al. and Schlichthorl et al. have reported sublinear relations ne ∝ I00.6 and ne ∝ I00.45, respectively, in dye-sensitized solar cells, where ne is the electron density.48,49 In the cases of QDSCs, similar power laws of Jsc ∝ I00.72 and Jsc ∝ I00.52 have been reported for Pb5Sb8S17 and NaSbS2 QDSCs, respectively.50,51 Analysis of the Jsc–I0 data in Table 5 yields a power law of Jsc ∝ I00.74 for PbxCd1−xS1−ySey. The sublinear power value of α < 1 agrees with the multiple trapping model, indicating that carrier recombination is an important active process in the PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDSCs. According to the multiple trapping model, as the light intensity decreases, the photocurrent Jsc will decrease slower than light intensity I0 because α < 1. For example, if α = 0.5 and I0 decreases by ten times, Jsc decreases by three times. Hence, carrier recombination is reduced at low light intensities; the generation of Jsc is more efficient, and the solar cell efficiency improves. The improvement in fill factor FF with reducing light intensity can also be explained by the same reason. Reduced carrier recombination improves carrier collection and produces a higher FF. The third parameter, decrease in Voc with reducing light intensity, is a typical result for a solar cell.

3.9 Comparison of CdS, PbxCd1−xS and PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDSCs
Quantum efficiency is a crucial parameter for a solar cell. Fig. 9(a) compares the EQE spectra of (a) pure CdS, (b) Pb-incorporated ternary Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88 and (c) Se-substituted quaternary Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 (sample no. 3, Table 1). The spectral ranges for the three EQE curves are CdS: 300–500 nm, Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88: 300–674 nm, and Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18: 300–750 nm, respectively. The range increases with successive incorporation of S and Se. The range of Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 is nearly twice that of the parent CdS. In addition to the spectral range, the EQE value also increases with S or Se substitution. The Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 sample exhibits the maximal EQE among the three samples. The maximal EQE value for Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 equals 83% at λ = 520 nm. Note that this maximal EQE value is close to the theoretical maximal value of 85% (there is a ∼15% loss of incident light due to the absorption and reflection by the FTO glass). The onset of an EQE spectrum represents the band gap Eg where a valence band to conduction band transition occurs. The EQE spectra yield Eg of 2.42 (CdS), 1.84 (Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88) and 1.65 eV (Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18), respectively. These EQE-deduced Egs are in good agreement with the ranges deduced from optical spectra shown in Fig. 5, indicating that the Pb and Se substitution results in a lower Eg and a broader absorption range.
 Fig. 9  Comparison of the best binary CdS, ternary PbxCd1−xS and quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDSCs: (a) EQE spectra and (b) I–V curves under 1% sun. 
The total photocurrent Jph that a solar cell produces can be calculated by integrating the area under an EQE curve:Jph = e∫ϕ(λ)EQE(λ)dλ,where e is the elementary charge and ϕ is photon flux. The integration yields Jph of 2.31 (CdS), 10.25 (Pb0.14Cd0.86S) and 16.06 mA cm−2 (Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18), respectively (shown in the right axis of Fig. 9(a)). The Jph of Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 is 60% larger than that of Pb0.14Cd0.86S, indicating a large improvement in photocurrent with Se substitution.
The best efficiency in this work was obtained under reduced light intensities. Fig. 9(b) compares the I–V characteristics of CdS, Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88 and Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 QDSCs under illumination of 0.01 sun. Table 6 lists the data. The best PCEs are 4.49% (CdS), 8.48% (Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88) and 9.24% (Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18), respectively. The PCE of the selenized sample Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18 increases by 9% relative to Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88. The improved performance arises mainly from the photocurrent Jsc, which increases from 0.19 (Pb0.14Cd0.86S0.88) to 0.29 mA cm−2 (Pb0.15Cd0.85S0.75Se0.18), an increase of 52%. The large increase in Jsc shows the advantage of Se substitution in expanding the light-harvesting range.

4. Conclusion
Using a two-step ion exchange process, we demonstrated the synthesis and photovoltaic performance of quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDSCs. The ion exchange reaction results in a tunable band gap ranging from 2.4 to 1.5 eV and an expanded absorption onset from 500 to 800 nm, enabling increased light-harvesting and cell performance. The quaternary PbxCd1−xS1−ySey QDSCs exhibit a PCE of 9.24%, two times higher than that of the binary CdS and 9% higher than that of the ternary PbxCd1−xS. The results suggest that PbxCd1−xS1−ySey is a candidate material for highly efficient solar cells.
