    , Accepted 25th May 2019First published on 29th May 2019AbstractModulating the charge distribution over the carbon skeleton via heteroatom doping is critical for creating active centres for efficient metal-free electrocatalysts. However, effective approaches to precisely control heteroatom co-doping to guide catalytic activities are still lacking. Herein, a P and N-coordinated fullerene-like carbon (N,P-FC) multi-functional catalyst was constructed via a facile soft-template pyrolysis method, which achieves impressive activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO (CO2RR, 83.3% faradaic efficiency for CO (FECO), a high current density of ∼24 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V), along with high selectivity and long-term stability. The activity of N,P-FC for CO2RR is strongly dependent on the P/N atomic ratio. Also, N,P-FC possesses an impressive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with a half-wave overpotential (E1/2) of 0.910 V, 79 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C, and it outperforms all documented carbon-based electrocatalysts. Combined theoretical calculation studies suggest that the P-coordinated C site is more active for CO2RR, while the N-coordinated neighboring C site is responsible for ORR in this catalyst. This work highlights a new concept for modulating surface charge redistribution by heteroatom co-doping and morphology control toward designing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts.
Introduction
Electrocatalytic reactions, such as the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and O2 evolution reaction (OER), play a pivotal role in the new energy conversion and storage devices.1–9 However, they require the wide utilization of noble metal (e.g. Au,10 Pt,11 Ru,12 or Ir13) based electrocatalysts, which show many shortcomings, including exorbitant prices, and instability under and susceptibility to gas poisoning, limiting their commercial development. Among non-precious alternatives, carbon nanomaterials, especially carbon nanotubes,14 graphene,15,16 and fullerene,17 show great potential as metal-free catalysts due to their multiple advantages, such as earth abundance, low cost, high electronic conductivity, structural stability, and tunable morphologies, and high tolerance to acidic/alkaline media. But pristine carbon materials exhibit an inert reactive property toward electrochemical reactions.18
Depending on the surface structure, the charge redistribution and adsorption behaviors of the reaction zone are critical to tailoring the activity of electrochemical catalysts.19,20 Since Dai and co-workers developed N-doped CNTs as a highly efficient metal-free catalyst for electrochemical reactions,14 various studies on the heteroatom doping of carbon have been launched worldwide. Doping-induced charge transfer effectively modulates the electronic properties of the doping site's neighboring carbon, which is beneficial in providing the carbon matrix with an optimized charge-carrier concentration and creating new active sites. With regard to CO2RR, the N-doping strategy provides an improved charge-carrier center and effectively results in high CO2 to CO efficiency.21–23 However, as the low current density is less than 1 mA cm−2, the high faradaic efficiencies (FE) do not indicate considerable production. Recently, co-doping with heteroatoms of different electronegativities has been shown to further boost catalytic performance due to the synergistic effects arising from the electronic interactions between the different dopants. For example, nanocarbon co-doped with electron-donating atoms (e.g. P) and electron-accepting atoms (e.g. N) can serve as an effective multi-functional catalyst for ORR and OER.24,25 Despite enormous progress, carbon materials tailored by heteroatom doping still cannot reach the activity of metal-containing catalysts for CO2RR, ORR, or OER. Therefore, the tailoring of active centers by heteroatom doping of carbon for multi-functional electrocatalysts still remains a challenge.
Fullerenes and their derivatives have received significant attention owing to their highly significant electron affinity, and excellent electron mobility,26 and have wide-ranging applications, including semiconductive materials for solar cells,27–29 catalysts,30,31 transistors,32 and photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy.33 However, an elucidation of the factors that cause the electrochemical behavior of the catalytically active centers in heteroatom doped fullerene materials has rarely been reported.
In this work, we constructed an N,P coordinated fullerene-like carbon structure (N,P-FC) with single-layer carbon nanocages using a soft-template pyrolysis method with the assistance of nontoxic, natural, and eco-friendly phytic acid (PA) as the P source, dicyandiamide (DCA) as the N source, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the soft-template. Combined density functional theory (DFT) computational studies show that, by benefiting from the synergistic effects of the double active centers introduced by N and P-coordination, the N,P-FC catalyst can be used as an efficient multi-functional electrocatalyst for CO2RR, ORR and OER, and for Zn-air batteries. As expected, it shows outstanding activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (83.3% faradaic efficiency for CO (FECO), and a current density of ∼24 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V). It also exhibits excellent performance for ORR (half-wave potential of 0.910 V, outperforming by 79 mV that of a Pt/C catalyst in basic media). As far as we know, this is the highest performing metal-free electrocatalyst for ORR from aqueous solutions that has been reported.
Experimental
Chemicals and reagents
Phytic acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Dicyandiamide was bought from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Mw = 2000) was purchased from Beijing Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Nafion (5.0 wt%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The Pt catalyst (20% Pt supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon) was obtained from Johnson Matthey. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification deionized water was used in all experiments.
Synthesis of three-dimensional porous N,P-coordinated fullerene-like carbon (N,P-FC)
N,P-FC was synthesized via a soft-template pyrolysis method. Typically, 5 g of dicyandiamide, 2 mL of phytic acid, and 0.5 g of PEG-2000 were dissolved in 40 mL of water under stirring and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The obtained solid powder was placed in a tubular carbonization furnace and carbonized at 900 °C for 6 hours under Ar gas conditions at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The obtained sample was named N,P-FC. The samples prepared at 800 and 1000 °C were designated as N,P-C-800 and N,P-C-1000, respectively. Samples with 1.5 times the P content of N-doped carbon and 0 times the P content of N-doped carbon annealed at 900 °C were designated as N,P-C-1.5P and N-doped C.
Synthesis of three-dimensional porous N,P-coordinated graphite-like carbon (N,P-GC)
Typically, 5 g of dicyandiamide, 2 mL of phytic acid and 0.5 g of P123 were dissolved in 40 mL of water under stirring and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The obtained solid powder was placed in a tubular carbonization furnace and carbonized at 900 °C for 6 hours under Ar gas conditions at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Finally, the black powder was acid treated by marinating in 6 M H2SO4 aqueous solution in order to remove the metallic impurities.
Characterizations
The morphology of the samples was studied with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEORJSM-6700F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 20) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Y-2000X-ray diffractometer using copper Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV, 40 mA. The Raman measurements were performed on a Renishaw spectrometer at 532 nm on a Renishaw Microscope System RM2000. The N2 adsorption/desorption curve was determined by BET measurements using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area analyzer. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with an ESCA LAB 250 spectrometer using a focused monochromatic Al Kα line (1486.6 eV) X-ray beam with a diameter of 200 μm. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were performed at the Taiwan Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC, 20A).
Results and discussion
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the preparation of the N,P-FC catalyst was performed via a one-step facile soft-template pyrolysis process by employing PA as the P source, DCA as the N source, and polyethylene glycol (Mw = 2000, PEG-2000) as the soft-template. In this, the use of PA as an acid source and of DCA as a base source is known to be advantageous due to their easy availability, strong “acid-base pair” cross-linking, and environmental friendliness. Briefly, PA, DCA, and PEG-2000 were mixed in water and then dried at 80 °C, followed by carbonization at 900 °C under Ar atmosphere.

As shown in Fig. 1b and S1a,† field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal numerous nanocages aggregated into a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure. Significantly, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows that the nanocages in N,P-FC possess a typical fullerene-like structural character with a 2–3 nm inner diameter and a single carbon layer (Fig. 1c and S1b†).34–38 The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) image in the inset of Fig. 1c shows a ring structure, implying the short-range order of carbon nanocages. For comparison, the other N,P-codoped carbon was prepared by using the surfactant P123 (EO20PO70EO20) instead of PEG-2000 (Scheme S1†). As shown in Fig. S1c and d,† such a control sample shows a graphene-like carbon sheet morphology with 4–6 layers and was marked as N,P-GC. The hydroxyl groups of PEG-2000 and P123 are responsible for linking to the PA–DCA macromolecule via hydrogen bonds, and the different micellar structures formed by PEG-2000 and P123 probably lead to a diversity of carbon structures during pyrolysis.39–41 The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analyses further manifest a homogeneous C, N, and P distribution over the fullerene-like N,P-FC (Fig. 1d).
Fig. S2† shows that N,P-FC has a large calculated Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore volume of up to 766.05 m2 g−1 and 1.49 m3 g−1 (Fig. S2a–c†), respectively.42–44 And the pore-size distribution centers at 3 and 23 nm correspond to the internal cage of the individual “fullerene” and stacking pores of N,P-FC, respectively. Obviously, the results are consistent with SEM and TEM observations. The ultrahigh surface areas and pore volumes of N,P-FC are anticipated to provide highly dense active sites and to favor fast mass transfer, facilitating electrocatalytic activity.
The structure of N,P-FC was further analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray adsorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Broad peaks at 25.5° and 43.5° in the XRD pattern are assigned to the (002) and (101) of graphitic carbon in N,P-FC (Fig. S2d†), indicating disordered structural features. Fig. S2e† presents Raman spectra of N,P-FC under a 532 nm laser, with a typical D-band (1342 cm−1) and G-band (1593 cm−1) corresponding to the disorder and the vibration of sp2-bonded carbon atoms,45 respectively. The ratio values of ID/IG were calculated to be 1.05–1.14 (Table S1†), indicating the defective structure of N,P-FC.
The chemical oxidation states and elemental compositions of the catalysts were examined by NEXAFS and XPS technologies. In the C K-edge spectrum, N,P-FC exhibits typical πC–C* resonances at ∼284.5, σC–C* resonances at ∼290.8 eV, and σC–N* at ∼287.0 eV (Fig. 1e). The π* resonances of C–C and C–P species have an overlapping position in the C K-edge NEXAFS (with only a weak shoulder at ∼283.1 eV that can be attributed to the πC–P* resonance).46,47 The successful incorporation of N is revealed by the N K-edge spectra (Fig. 1f), showing three π* resonances representing N–C bonds in the form of pyridine (398.0 eV), pyrrole (399.4 eV), and graphite (401.2 eV) structures, respectively.46 The P L-edge spectrum shows P–C and P–N bonds at 132.5 and 133.7 eV, respectively (Fig. 1g). In addition, (1–4) peaks show the spectrum of phytate, possibly due to a small amount of raw material residue.
The XPS survey spectra of N,P-FC, N,P-C-800, and N,P-C-1000 exhibit the presence of peaks corresponding to C, N, O, and P in the desired stoichiometric ratios, confirming the formation of metal-free catalysts (Fig. S3†). The doping contents of N and P are 3.72 at% and 2.27 at%, respectively (see details listed in Table S2†). As shown in Fig. 1h, the N 1s XPS peak was deconvoluted into four groups corresponding to N-6 (pyridinic-N, 398.5 eV), N-5 (pyrrolic-N, 399.7 eV), N-G (graphitic-N, 401.2 eV), and N–O (oxidized pyridinic N+–O−, 402.9 eV).25,48 The P 2p spectrum displays three distinguishable peaks attributed to the P–C bond (132.8 eV), P–N bond (133.7 eV), and P–O bond (135 eV), respectively (Fig. 1i).49,50 All these results are consistent with the NEXAFS results. Subsequently, to investigate the effects of temperature changes on the structure and electrochemical property, N,P-C-800 and N,P-C-1000 were also synthesized via a similar protocol but carbonized at 800 and 1000 °C. As listed in Tables S3–S6,† the contents and types of N and P doping sites formed at different temperatures were compared. As shown in Fig. 1j, N,P-C-800 and N,P-FC show similar amounts of N and P elements. When the temperature rises to 1000 °C, the N and P amounts are dramatically decreased. We speculate that the abundant N-doping and P-doping sites could more helpful for electrocatalysis.
To evaluate the electrochemical performance of N,P-FC materials for CO2 reduction, we explored the catalyst in a membrane-separated two-compartment cell using a typical three-electrode setup, as shown in Fig. S5.† The working electrode was obtained by uniformly depositing materials on hydrophobic carbon fiber paper with an areal loading of 1 mg cm−2. First, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed between 0 V and −0.9 V in both CO2-saturated and N2-saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3 electrolytes to compare the CO2RR and H2 evolution reaction (HER) of N,P-FC (Fig. 2a). In CO2-saturated electrolytes, the LSV curve exhibits an onset potential of −0.34 V for CO2RR, and the current density increases rapidly to ∼24 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V. When CO2 is absent, HER becomes the dominant reaction and a more negative onset potential can be observed. Therefore, N,P-FC exhibits CO2RR between −0.34 and −0.8 V and a dominant HER over −0.8 V. To determine the optimal N,P-FC preparation conditions, comparisons of catalytic activities toward CO2RR among N,P-FC, N,P-GC, N,P-C-800, and N,P-C-1000 were performed, and N,P-FC exhibits the highest activity among these four materials (Fig. 2b). Typically, between −0.22 V and −0.55 V, the N,P-FC faradaic efficiency (FE) displays a rapid increase and a maximum (FECO) production of ∼83.3% at a low potential of −0.52 V can be reached. After −0.52 V, the FE starts to slowly decline, presumably because CO2RR becomes diffusion-limited under large overpotentials. The same trend is observed for these samples, N,P-GC and N,P-C-800 show maximum FECO of ∼68.8% at −0.55 V and 72% at −0.48 V, respectively. While N,P-C-1000 performs with the worst CO2RR properties with a maximum FE of 45% at −0.6 V. H2 was detected as another gas during the entire electrolysis and its FE increases with decreasing applied potential (Fig. S6†). More importantly, the N,P-FC catalyst shows a superior maximum CO partial current density of 8.52 mA cm−2 at −0.52 V (Fig. 2c), much higher than those of most reported catalysts (Fig. 2d and Table S7†). We also summarized recently reported carbon-based electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. The highest CO partial current density of these electrocatalysts and the corresponding overpotentials are presented in Fig. 2d. It is worth noting that N,P-FC shows a higher partial current density and lower overpotential than those of reported state-of-the-art metal-free CO2RR catalysts.

(d) Comparison of overpotentials and current density of CO formation at the maximum FE of N,P-FC with other electrocatalysts reported in literature studies. (e) Stability of performance of N,P-FC carbon for CO2 reduction operated at the potentiostatic mode of −0.55 V for 12 h. Both current density and FECO remain steady over the duration of the test. 
Another crucial performance indicator for an ideal electrocatalyst is stability. We also conducted continuous CO2RR at −0.55 V for 12 h to test the stability of this material. As shown in Fig. 2e, the current density shows no sign of activity loss over the entire electrolysis and the corresponding FECO is calculated to be in the range of 75–80%. The surface composition of N,P-FC after the stability test was also analyzed by XPS (Fig. S7†): there are no obvious differences for the atomic percentages compared with the original ones. All these results suggest the excellent durability of the N,P-FC electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.
In order to understand the correlation between catalytic activity and the contents of the heteroatom doping sites, the trend in the maximum FECO and its corresponding current density versus the P/N atomic ratio in the catalyst at various carbonization temperatures was investigated (Fig. S12†). As the P/N atomic ratio increases, the maximum FECO and the corresponding current density increase. When the P/N ratio is 0.6, the best catalytic activity is shown. These comparisons further indicate that the activity of the fullerene-like carbon material for CO2RR is strongly dependent on the loading of P-doping sites.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) to understand the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR over P-doping and N-doping sites. Based on the NEXAFS and XPS results for different types of N and P coordination, six types of configurations were constructed in the fullerene models including N,P coordinated and N-single coordinated ones (Fig. S13a, S14–S18 and Table S8†). Since Shinde and co-workers50 have confirmed that the N–P moieties are active for ORR/OER, we did not consider an N–P bond containing model. The electron reduction of CO2 into CO is generally considered to take place in three elementary steps, involving the initial state (CO2 molecule), adsorbed intermediate states (*COOH, *CO) and the termination state (CO molecule). Among these, the most important one is *COOH, whose corresponding free energy reflects CO2RR activity, while in addition, the desorption of *CO into the gas phase also affects the catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. S13b,† the defective fullerene model with pyridinic-N and P coordination gives more rational Gibbs free energy values than other types of model, even the N single doping models, implying the significant synergistic effect of N,P coordination on CO2RR catalysis. Because the CO2 reduction could not occur on N or P sites owing to their strong electronegativity, four types of C sites coordinated P-atom (C56 and C55) and N-doping (C44 and C42) sites were further chosen to determine the active centers. As shown in Fig. 3a, the free energy adsorption of *COOH and desorption of *CO on C56 are significantly lower than those on C55, C44, or C42, suggesting that the high CO2 activity originates from C active site coordinated P atoms. More importantly, coinciding with the experimental data, the N,P-coordinated fullerene model shows even lower Gibbs free energy than N,P-coordinated graphene model, further confirming that the fullerene structure is beneficial to the CO2RR reaction (Fig. S19†). Therefore, N and P coordinated on the fullerene surface activate C atoms adjacent to P atoms by generating an asymmetric charge distribution and causing greater polarization.24
 Fig. 3  Computational results: (a) free energy diagrams of CO2RR on C55, C56, C44, and C42 sites of an N,P codoped fullerene model in salt solution and the relaxed structure of C56, as determined by DFT calculations; (b) free energy pathway of ORR on C44 of an N,P codoped fullerene model in alkaline solution and the relaxed structure of C44, as determined by DFT calculations. 
The theoretical calculation results demonstrate that N,P coordinated on the surface of fullerene bring about greater asymmetrical spin distributions than that on graphene, indicating that N,P-coordinated fullerene is more advantageous for enhancing CO2RR performance (activity, reaction pathway, durability) compared with P,N-coordinated graphene-based materials, well consistent with the electrochemical results.
To further demonstrate the multifunctional catalytic activities, we investigated the ORR performance of the N,P-FC and N,P-GC samples. First, DFT calculations were conducted to determine the influence of N- and P-coordinated sites. The calculated minimum free-energy path and the species along the subreactions of the ORR on C44 (next to N) and C56 (next to P) sites are listed in Fig. 3b and Table S9.† For the C44 active center at a potential of U = 0 V, the free energies are all lower than those on C56, and all the reaction steps from O2 to OH− are downhill, implying the significant fact that the C sites next to an N-doping active site are probably responsible for ORR electrocatalysis. This conclusion is consistent with a previous study reported by Dai.14 After considering the effect of the applied electric potential, the thermodynamic reduction potential will be further decreased at an applied potential of 0.726 V.
Therefore, we tested the ORR performance, as shown in Fig. 4e and S20.† As expected, the CV scan (Fig. S20a†) shows that N,P-FC possesses a cathodic peak with high current emerging at a potential in an O2-saturated electrolyte, indicating superb oxygen reduction activity. As shown in Fig. 4e and Table S13,† N,P-FC shows outstanding ORR performance in alkaline media (onset overpotential (Eonset) = 0.959 V and half-wave overpotential (E1/2): 0.910 V) over N,P-GC (E0: 0.912 V and E1/2: 0.841 V), even 79 mV higher in E1/2 than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (Eonset: 0.878 V and E1/2: 0.831 V). More importantly, the computer calculation results reveal that the intrinsic curve surface of the fullerene model brings about greater asymmetrical spin distributions than those on graphene, affording the carbon matrix with superior binding affinity of intermediates and high reactivity, leading to a higher level of electrochemical performances. As far as we know, this is the highest performing ORR electrocatalyst among reported non-noble metal catalysts (Table S14†).

The ORR kinetics were further probed by the K-L method (Fig. S20b and c†). In the potential range of 0.2–0.5 V, the calculated average electron transfer number of N,P-FC is ∼4.0, which is equal to the theoretical value (4.0) for Pt/C catalysts. Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements show a low percentage of peroxide generation (<5%) and 4-electron processes (Fig. S21a and b†). As shown in Fig. S20d,† the fast ORR kinetics for N,P-FC is confirmed by its Tafel slope of 70 mV dec−1, lower than that of N,P-GC (80 mV dec−1) or Pt/C (71 mV dec−1). Thus, both the RDE and RRDE measurements suggest an efficient ORR directly into water via a four-electron pathway. More importantly, N,P-FC has good tolerance of CH3OH (Fig. S21c and d†) and excellent durability with almost no activity decay after 20000 cycles (Fig. S22†). Significantly, Fig. S23a† shows excellent ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for N,P-FC, which can be judged by the potential difference between OER and ORR (ΔE = Ej=10 − E1/2, where the OER potential is taken at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, while the ORR potential is taken at half-wave). As a reference, we also used a state-of-the-art OER electrode with RuO2 nanoparticles, and found that N,P-FC possesses a lower onset potential than RuO2 or Pt/C, and ΔE is minimal at 0.678 V. To better evaluate OER performance, we tested the LSV curve, the Tafel slope and its stability for N,P-FC. As shown in Fig. S23b,† an overpotential of 1.57 V was obtained for an N,P-FC catalyst to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for OER in 1 M KOH solution. Additionally, N,P-FC shows a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec−1, which suggests favorable OER kinetics for N,P-FC (Fig. S23c†). Moreover, the N,P-FC catalyst exhibits robust stability with a negligible difference in the curves after 40000s of OER test at an overpotential of 1.6 V (Fig. S23d†). Undoubtedly, owing to their high ORR/OER activity, N,P-CN materials are promising cost-effective candidates for Zn-air batteries. Obviously, N,P-FC displays a high open-circuit voltage of up to 1.42 V (Fig. 4f) and a peak-power density as high as 148.3 mW cm−2, superior to commercial Pt/C (∼63.6 mW cm−2) or other catalysts (Table S15†), and good rate performances for 2–20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4g). As shown in Fig. S24b,† no obvious decrease in voltage in long-term discharge is implied. When normalized to the mass of Zn consumed, the specific capacity at 10 mA cm−2 was calculated to be 725 mA h g−1. The galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling curve (Fig. 4h) shows excellent reversibility in ≈24 h at 5 mA cm−2 with a scan rate of 200s per cycle. The photograph in Fig. 4i shows a Zn-air liquid battery with an open circuit voltage of 1.441 V, and an LED (5 mm, ∼3.2 V) light can be powered by two liquid batteries connected in series with an N,P-FC-based air-cathode. These results reveal that the as-obtained N,P-FC catalyst shows attractive potential in rechargeable Zn-air batteries.
Conclusions
In summary, an N,P-coordinated fullerene-like carbon structure with single-layer carbon nanocages has been effectively synthesized via a soft-template pyrolysis method. This low-cost catalyst demonstrates multifunctional catalytic activities for CO2RR, ORR, OER, as well as Zn-air batteries. DFT calculations manifest that the C atoms coordinated to P and N atoms act as catalytically active centers for CO2RR and ORR. Thus the P,N-coordinated carbon matrix possesses splendid electrochemical reactivity for multifunctional catalysis. When compared with a graphene model, N,P-coordinated sites on the surface of the fullerene model bring about greater asymmetrical spin distributions than that on graphene, so the electrochemical properties of such materials can be further promoted to a higher level. In view of this, N,P-FC achieves impressive activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO at moderate overpotentials, along with high selectivity and long-term stability. Also, N,P-FC exhibits splendid ORR activity (E1/2 = 0.91 V), 79 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C, and a high Zn-air battery performance (a power density of up to 148.3 mW cm−2 and excellent reversibility). Undoubtedly, this work provides a profound understanding of the intrinsic activity of multi-heteroatom coordinated carbon and paves the way to the design of highly-efficient metal-free catalysts for advanced energy conversion devices.
