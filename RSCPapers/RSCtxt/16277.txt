    , Accepted 9th June 2009First published on 7th July 2009AbstractWith a general aim to make anthracene derivatives multifunctional (n-type emitter) and also study their suitability as electron transport layers for organic light emitting diodes (OLED), and with a more specific interest to understand the charge transport and packing pattern in the solid state due to the rotating side rings, we report the synthesis and characterization of six novel molecules (5–10) in which the 9 and 10 positions of anthracene have been directly substituted by phenyloxadiazole groups. We have carried out detailed studies of these molecules including photophysical, electrochemical, electroluminescent studies and solid state structure determination through crystallographic techniques. The electron affinity is very high, around 3.1–3.2 eV, and the ionization potential is around 5.9–6.0 eV, comparable to the more commonly used electron transport electroluminescent layer Alq3. The studies reveal that the new molecules being reported by us, in addition to the high thermal stability, are quite efficient in a two layer unoptimized device with the device structure ITO/α-NPD/5–10/LiF/Al and have an emission in pure green. They also show very high efficiency as electron transport layer in device structure ITO(120nm)/α-NPD(30nm)/Ir(ppy)3 doped CBP(35nm)/BCP(6nm)/5(28nm)/Al(150nm). From these studies we conclude that the anthracene derivatives also have considerable potential as multifunctional layers and as electron transport layers in OLED.
Introduction
Organic molecules having semi conducting and emission properties are of immense interest due to their potential applications in opto-electronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLED), field effect transistors (FET) and solar cells.1OLED in particular have attracted considerable attention after the first report by Tang and VanSlyke.2 The search for new and efficient emitting materials and charge transport layers remains as one of the most active areas in this field.3 While bringing out efficient devices is one challenge, understanding the interactions, properties due to substitution, geometry and packing of the molecules in the solid state is another.4 The latter would help us not only to improve the device efficiency but also give us more detailed insight into the mechanism of OLED.
The basic structure of the OLED which have been widely reported in the literature is multilayered constituting of a hole transport layer (HTL), an emitting layer (EML) and an electron transport layer (ETL) with each layer having an independent function.5 Very high device performances have been achieved with these.3c,6 It has been suggested that in the next generation of OLED the focus should be on thermally robust materials with improved multifunctional properties like, emission and charge transport in a single layer.7 The process of device fabrication then gets simplified due to the multifunctional properties.8 A device with a single organic material having a good emission, charge mobilities, i.e. both hole and electron, and thermal stabilities is difficult to achieve.7
Compared to emitting HTL, fewer emitting ETL have been reported.7–10 One good example of electron transporting emitting material is the well known green emitter Alq3 which is still being used as a good electron transporter since its first report in a bilayer device.2 Other metal chelates have also been investigated for electron transport properties after the success achieved with Alq3.9 Molecules containing aromatic heterocyclics (electron rich or electron deficient) like oxadiazoles, triazoles, quinoxalines, triazines, benzobisazoles, benzothiadiazoles, pyridine, quinoline, phenanthrolines, anthrazoline based materials have been synthesized and suggested as electron transport and hole blocking materials for electroluminescent (EL) devices.7,11,12 Emissive groups attached to charge transport moieties in a single molecule will not only help to improve charge injection but also favour cheaper fabrication of devices as fewer layers are necessary for coating on to the device. To work as an efficient ETL the molecule should possess high electron affinity (EA) to match with the high work function of the air stable cathodes.13Oxadiazole derivatives have been investigated as electron transport materials.7,112-(4-biphenyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) is a molecule with EA of 2.16 eV and ionization potential (IP) of 6.06 eV that has been exploited as an electron transport material.14 To increase the EA of these materials another oxadiazole molecule was appended and an EA value of 2.8 eV was achieved.7 The dimeric oxadiazoles also have an added advantage of higher glass transition temperature Tg.7 Changing the central phenylene moiety in PBD, which lies in between the two oxadiazoles, to ethylene and to pyridyl the EA increased.7b,11e At high electric fields electron mobilities of 2 × 10−5 cm2/Vs has been noted for PBD and related compounds.7a

Anthracene has been widely investigated as an emitting material for OLED due to its excellent photoluminescence and electrochemical stability.15 Many anthracene derivatives have been synthesized and characterized, with various donating groups and electron withdrawing groups symmetrically substituted at 9,10 or 2,6 positions, as emissive layers for blue and green/yellow emission.15i,j A direct substitution of either a strong electron withdrawing or electron donating groups at 9 and 10 positions changes the electron density on the anthracene ring due to conjugation and the emission peak is red shifted.16,15i On the other hand substitution of groups like alkyl or an aromatic ring with a negligible conjugation with the anthracene ring almost retains the large band gap of the unsubstituted anthracene which has an emission in the blue region.15a–h,j,k Exploiting this, bulky groups have been attached to anthracene to induce non-planarity into the molecular structure which essentially prevents aggregation in the solid state without changing the emission characteristics. In addition there is also an increase in the luminescence quantum yields.17 Non-planarity also enables formation of pin hole free thin films.18 Ando et al. have investigated p-and n-type organic semiconductors containing an anthracene unit.15l The substitution of acceptor or donor at 2 and 6 positions gave rise to n- and p-type activity with the same mobility range. Yu et al. had synthesized and characterized anthracene derivatives with electron donating groups like diaminophenylnapthalene and diphenyldiamino at the 9 and 10 positions for green host EL materials.15i They obtained very high efficiencies in three-layered device structure. In a recent study Chien et al. had tested triphenylphosphine derivatives of anthracene as a multifunctional blue emitter.15f In their studies they appended two electron deficient triphenylphosphine oxide (TPO) groups to the 9th and 10th position of anthracene to make it an n-type emitter.
With an aim to achieve an efficient n-type emitter, we rationalized that appending the highly electron withdrawing oxadiazole moiety directly to the anthracene ring would give us not only an emitting layer but also an ETL with larger EA and this would increase the multifunctionality of the layer. In addition this would also increase the thermal stability of the molecule. In this paper we report the synthesis, structural characterization of a series of six new n-type organic emitters based on 9,10-bis(2-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole) derivatives of anthracene (5–10). Investigation of the photophysical, thermal and electrochemical studies are presented. Solid state structure of two of the derivatives (5 and 10) were determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography while detailed understanding of the absorption/emission and reorganization energies of all the derivatives were obtained by theoretical studies. Simple bi-layer EL devices were fabricated for all these anthracene derivatives using 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl-1)-N-phenyl-amino]-biphenyl (α-NPD) as hole transport layer and the resultant electroluminescent properties analyzed. A three layer device with 5 as electron transport material and phosphorescent Iridium complex as the emitter was also fabricated and tested. These anthracene derivatives show promising applications as n-type emitters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of multifunctionality of anthracene derivatives as n-type green emitters for OLED.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
We have synthesized and characterized six 9,10-bis(2-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole) derivatives of anthracene 5–10. The synthetic routes to these are illustrated in Schemes 1 and 2. The basic differences in the six derivatives lie in the substitution at the phenyl ring. In 5 there is no alkyl group attached to the phenyl ring (R1 = R2 = H), while 6 has a methyl group at the para and in 7 at the ortho position respectively. 8, 9,and 10 have methoxy, t-butyl and hexyl groups substituted at the para position respectively. 1 was prepared as per the published procedure.19 Subsequent bromination20 of 1 led to 9,10-dibromo product 2 with 81% yield. Conversion of the dibromo derivative to dinitrile 3 was achieved by Rosenmund-von Braun synthesis21 using cuprous cyanide. Freshly prepared Bu3SnN322 was used to obtain the ditetrazole intermediate 4. 4 was confirmed by negative-ion ESI mass spectrometry and the relevant peak observed at m/z425.2(M-1). In the final step 5–10 were obtained by treating 4 with corresponding acid chlorides and refluxing in pyridine solvent (56–82%). All the anthracene derivatives were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and elemental analysis. The details of the experimental characterization data are available in the ESI.†

Molecular geometry and crystal structure
The crystal structures of 5 and 10 have been determined. The X-ray molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1. In both crystals there are two independent molecules of the anthracene derivative and each lie about the crystallographic inversion centre. The oxadiazole ring is symmetrically twisted with respect to the central anthracene ring with a twist angle of 79° in one molecule and −66° in the other molecule in 5. Similarly in 10 we find the corresponding angles to be 62° and −57°. B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) reproduces the structures of these molecules, with an accuracy of 0.025 Å for bond lengths and 1° for bond angles. But the twist angles are a bit different as predicted by DFT for both molecules. This difference in the theoretical value and the experimentally determined one can be attributed to the intermolecular forces. The experimental bond length of the anthracene–oxadiazole connecting C–C bond is around 1.48 Å which has a more single bond character (free rotation). Oxadiazole prefers to have conjugation with the phenyl ring in the ground state (oxadiazole-phenyl part is planar). This would also explain that 10 with a longer hexyl chain and thus decreased intermolecular interactions relatively has a smaller dihedral angle. Extending the single molecule DFT studies to the other molecules (6,7,8 and 9), we obtain essentially similar angles in the range 52–53°.

The dihedral angle of the second molecule is shown in parenthesis. Only the torsion (twist) angles are shown for clarity. The details are given in the ESI.† 
The crystal packing diagrams of 5 and 10 are shown in Fig. 2. In 5 the shortest distances between the anthracene rings (CH to centroid) is around 2.98 Å. The CH–π distance from phenyl ring C–H to anthracene centroid is 2.88 Å. The π–π interactions can be considered to be absent as the centroid–centroid oxadiazole separations are 4.41 Å. From this it is clear that the stabilization of crystal 5 is due CH–π interaction. On the other hand in 10, we find that the stabilization is due to the π–π interaction, here the closest centroid–centroid oxadiazole separation is 3.94 Å, while the CH–π separations are much longer.

We have also calculated the geometry of the corresponding cation and anion of these molecules (data shown in ESI†). Here we find the torsion angle to be reduced or in other words increase in conjugation between anthracene and oxadiazole. Thus on being reduced or oxidized during charge transfer, we can expect the molecule in the crystal to be more conjugated.
Electrochemical properties
To evaluate electrochemical properties of 5–10, cyclic voltammetry studies were performed under N2 in 0.1M CH2Cl2/tetrabutyl ammoniumperchlorate solutions with scan rates of 100 mV/s and a scan range between −1.8 and 1.8 V. Fig. 3 shows representative voltammograms. It is observed that an oxidative process is quasireversible while the reductive process is reversible for all the anthracene derivatives. The half wave potentials23 (Eoxd1/2 and Ered1/2) for the oxidation and reduction of 5–10 are tabulated in table 1. The oxidation and reduction potentials are almost similar for all the derivatives. The higher oxidation potential is attributed to the anthracene ring. Vertical IP (VIP) and EA (VEA) calculated using DFT methods are also tabulated in Table 1. It is seen from the VIP and VEA that upon substituting the oxadiazole ring the radical cation state of the unsubstituted anthracene is destabilized by 0.4–0.5 eV (VIP of anthracene is 7.16 eV) while the radical anion state is stabilized around 0.6 eV(VEA of anthracene is 0.49 eV).24a

Electrochemically measured redox potentials are often used as estimates to HOMO/LUMO energies (in eV) by adding 4.4 to the Eonset to obtain IP (IP = Eoxdonset + 4.4) and EA (EA = Eredonset + 4.4).23 The estimated experimental HOMO/LUMO values along with HOMO/LUMO values obtained from DFT calculations are shown in the same table. In general the computationally and experimentally determined HOMO/LUMO values are in good agreement.24b–fEA is in the range of 3.1–3.19 eV for these anthracene derivatives, which are comparable to the large EA of a widely used ET material.
Thermal properties
The thermal properties of anthracene derivatives were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA was performed in the temperature range of 33–600 °C in N2 atmosphere by heating at the rate of 10 °C min−1. 5–10 show high thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures (Td) ranging from 400 to 461 °C (with a wt. loss of less than 5%). This is tabulated in Table 2. The melting points (Tm), glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of 5–10 (Table 2 and Fig. 4) were measured by carrying out DSC in a N2 atmosphere by heating at the rate of 10 °C min−1. The Tg values reported in the table were determined from the second heating scan. The Tg values range from 52–131 °C. The maximum Tg value was observed for 9 which can be attributed to the four tertiary butyl substitutions. On the other hand the flexible hexyl chains in 10 decrease its Tg to 52 °C. 7 and 8 do not show any melting endotherm or crystallization exotherm on second heating up to 350 °C. The melting points of 5–10 are very high and are in the range of 180–288 °C. The lower melting point of 180 °C obtained for 10 is due to the decreased intermolecular forces.

Absorption and emission
The absorption spectra of 5–10 were recorded in CHCl3. Due to the similarity in the spectra only the absorption spectra of 5 is shown in Fig. 5 while salient features of the spectra for all the anthracene derivatives are summarized in table 3 (The spectra for other compounds are in the ESI†). The absorption maxima of the six derivatives varies only by 0.2 eV (3.08–3.10 eV) and is almost independent of the substitution at the phenyl ring. On the other hand the maxima are slightly red shifted when compared to the unsubstituted anthracene, which is at 3.31 eV.25 This could be attributed to the stabilization of the LUMO and destabilization of the HOMO on appending of the oxadiaziole ring to the anthracene. From the theoretical data obtained by TDDFT calculations (Table 3), the absorption is dominated by HOMO–LUMO transition, in which both the orbitals are mainly localized on the anthracene unit. The HOMO and the LUMO along with HOMO −1 and LUMO + 1 of 5 are shown in Fig. 6. The computed absorption energies are slightly different from the experimentally observed ones due to the inherent limitations in the TDDFT methodology.24a,26

The emission spectra were recorded in CHCl3 with excitation wavelength fixed at 400 nm. The emission energies range from 2.39 to 2.42 eV which is in good agreement with the theoretical calculations shown in the same table. The shift of the emission, by as much as 0.7 eV, to the green region is attributed to the increase in conjugation with the substituent at the 9,10-position of the anthracene ring on excitation.15i To have a deeper understanding of the absorption and emission maxima and their relation to the symmetric rotation of the side rings, we carried out DFT studies of a model molecule shown in Fig. 7. The angle Vs the emission/absorption energy (wavelength) calculated is also shown graphically in the same figure. The absorption/emission energies decrease with decrease of the angle, due to increase in conjugation between the side rings and the central ring. At 90° when there is no conjugation, the absorption maxima is the same as in unsubstituted anthracene. The quantum yields measured in CHCl3 are quite high.

Electroluminescence properties
To evaluate the electroluminescent properties of 5–10, we fabricated a bilayer device for each derivative having a configuration ITO (120 nm)/α-NPD (30nm)/Emissive layer 5–10 (28 nm)/LiF(1nm)/Al(150 nm). After fabrication of the EL devices, we recorded the EL spectrum (shown in Fig. 8 for 5), current–voltage-luminescence (J–V–L) characteristics and CIE co-ordinates of the devices. Peak wavelength and CIE co-ordinates obtained for each device are shown in Table 4. Fig. 9 shows the current–luminescence characteristics of the devices using these molecules as emitters. The EL devices with each emitter showed good EL performance over a wide range of current density. For the reference we also fabricated an EL device with Alq3 as an emissive material with the same device structure. The luminescence of 5–10 based devices are comparable to that of the Alq3 based device. Within the anthracene derivatives investigated here we achieved the highest luminescence of 1996 Cd m−2 at a current density of 468 mA cm−2 in the case of 5 as an emitter. We calculated the current and power efficiency for all the devices. In the table maximum values of current and power efficiencies and the onset voltages are shown. The onset voltages for each device are quite low. Compared to the fluorescence spectra the EL spectra were slightly red shifted.

To test the efficiency of the anthracene derivatives as ETL, we fabricated three different devices with phosphorescent emitter Ir(ppy)3 doped 4,4′-bis(9-carbazolyl)-biphenyl (CBP). Only the ETL was changed in each device while the rest of the device was kept the same. The first device was without an ETL, while in the second case Alq3 was used as an ETL and in the third case 5 was used as an ETL. Fig. 10 shows the J–V–L characteristics of these three devices while in Table 5 we have tabulated the results. From the figure and table it is seen that by using 5 as an electron transport layer a significant increase (about two times) in current density at all voltages and luminescence is achieved in comparison to Alq3 as electron transport layer.

Charge transport
The electron/hole transport parameters namely the reorganization energies (λ+ and λ−) and the electronic coupling element t12 (transfer integral) for 10 have been determined by DFT calculation and data tabulated in Tables 6 and 7. The transfer integrals are calculated for the different channels as shown in Fig. 2. To understand the effect of rotation on the reorganization energy, we have calculated the λ+, λ− for both fully relaxed conformations (allowing the oxadiazole side rings to rotate to its minima when oxidized/reduced) and partially relaxed (twist angle between the anthracene and oxadiazole ring is frozen in the neutral state) in which only the bond angles and the bond lengths relax on oxidation/reduction. We clearly see that the major contribution to the reorganization energy is due to the side ring rotations, which is larger than the reorganization energy observed in unsubstituted anthracene.
While the reorganization energies indicate that the electron/hole transport will be slightly slower than in unsubstituted anthracene, the transfer integral (Table 7) which is another important parameter clearly indicates a large value in some directions in these anthracene derivatives.

Conclusion
We have shown that 5–10 have considerable potential to act as n-type emitters and as electron transporting layers in OLED. Blending in anthracene's superior photophysical properties and oxadiazole's good electron transport properties into a single moiety has been achieved. The thermal robustness of the materials also increases as seen from the higher dissociation and melting temperatures (Td = 400–461 °C; Tm = 180–296 °C). The Tg (52–131 °C) are also very high. In the solid state, from the data obtained for 5 and 10, we infer that the stabilizing interactions in these derivatives are CH–π and π–π. The electrochemical studies reveal that these derivatives have reversible reduction process and quasi reversible oxidation process. Theoretical studies reveal that the HOMO and the LUMO lie on the anthracene ring and the orbital energy values of these are in good agreement to the ones estimated from the cyclic voltametry studies. The absorption and emission of these derivatives lie in the range 3.08–3.11 eV and 2.39–2.42 eV respectively. Basically the major contribution to the absorption is a HOMO–LUMO transition. High fluorescence is observed for all the derivatives (the quantum yields = 0.76–0.98). The EL performance of all these devices is good and can be attributed to the high electron affinity of these molecules (∼3.1 eV), which offers a low barrier for electron injection ∼0.6 eV from the cathode LiF/Al. The injection barrier is quite low in comparison to the injection barrier in the case of Alq3, where the EA is 2.7 eV, which is mostly used as an emissive material as well as an electron transport material. Due to the electron withdrawing nature of the oxadiazole ring, the central anthracene ring has only a partial conjugation with this group in the ground state, the twist angle between the two rings calculated without including any intermolecular interaction is in the range 52°–53°. The electron density on the central ring is modified due to an increase in conjugation on excitation and hence the emission takes place in the green.
Based on the calculation it is seen that the conjugation between the rings in the ground state tends to increase in the excited state due to the charge transfer between the anthracene and oxadiazole. Thus there is a rotation of the oxadiazole ring on excitation with decrease in the twist angle between the anthracene and the oxadiazole ring. In the polaron hopping model regime, the charge transport takes place through formation of cations and anions. For the rotation of the rings, both in the formation of cation and anion, slightly larger reorganization energy is required for these derivatives when compared to the unsubstituted anthracene. In spite of the larger reorganization energy due to this rotation, efficient ET characteristics are seen, which could be attributed to the larger transfer integral between the neighboring molecules in the solid state.
In the un-optimized two layer device we find that the power efficiency, current efficiency and luminous intensity is reasonably good. The CIEx,y coordinates obtained for 6 (0.25, 0.71) lie in pure green according to Nation Television System Committee (NTSC) green color standard (0.21,0.71). Thus these molecules act as both ET and EM layers in a non-doped OLED device. Further studies of the compounds as ETL in a three layer device with Ir complex as the phosphorescent emitter, showed reasonably high efficiency when compared to the standard Alq3 as the ET layer.
Experimental
Measurements and instruments
Analytical Reagent grade reagents were used without further purification. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Gemini (200 MHz) spectrometer and Bruker Avance (300 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3 and 13C-NMR spectra on a Bruker Avance (300 MHz) spectrometer, both with TMS as standard. Mass spectra were obtained by using electrospray ionization iontrap mass spectrometry (Thermofinnigan, Sanzox, CA, USA) and fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectra were recorded on VG-AUTOSPEC spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed using a Vario-EL elemental analyzer. UV-Visible absorption spectra were measured on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. Steady state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Spex model Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence quantum yields (Φ) were estimated by using 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) as the standard.27 The Tm, Tg of the derivatives were measured by carrying out DSC using DSC 821e (METTLER TOLEDO). TGA was performed using a TGA/SDTA 851e (METTLER TOLEDO). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed on a PC-controlled CH instruments model CHI 620C electrochemical analyzer. The working electrode is glassy carbon, standard calomel electrode (SCE) is reference electrode and platinum wire is an auxiliary electrode.
Computational methodology
The ground state geometries for all the molecules (including a model molecule) in this study were obtained at DFT/B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level using the software G03.28 Where possible the crystal structures were taken as an initial guess for optimization. Frequencies were evaluated for the optimized geometries to ensure the structure obtained was a minimum on the potential energy surface. To get a deeper insight into the absorption spectrum, excitation energies were calculated using time dependent DFT RPA methodology at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level. The vertical S0–S1 vertical excitation energy obtained at B3LYP ground state geometry was taken to be the absorption maximum.29 To get a deeper insight into the emission, the first singlet excited state geometries were obtained with optimization using HF-CIS/6-31G (d,p) model chemistry. The vertical absorption at the excited state geometry was taken as the emission maxima.30
The charge transport in organic crystals can be assumed to be similar to intermolecular self exchange electron transfer reactions, in such a case the charge hopping pace can be inferred from semi classical Marcus theory (1).31 (1)Where K(h,e)t is the rate constant for charge transport (hole/electron), ħ the Planck's constant divided by 2π, b the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, t12 is the intermolecular transfer integral and λ the reorganization energy which amounts from i) the inner reorganization energy of the molecule due to successive oxidation, λi and reduction and ii) reorganization energy of the surrounding media, λs. The inner reorganization energy is the sum of stabilization gained by relaxation of neutral molecule after losing/gaining electron and stabilization gained by charged species after gaining/losing electron. We have carried out the optimization of the cation and anion at the UB3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level.
The charge transfer integral was estimated for all the possible dimer interaction pathways by taking pairs of molecule in the crystal using the recently suggested Energy Dimer Hamiltonian (EDH) method by Siebbeles et al.32 and Bredas et al.,33 by orthogonalization of off-diagonal elements of Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian as shown below in equation (2). (2)
This mainly requires the knowledge of the dimer HOMO and HOMO-1 (LUMO and LUMO + 1) and the interactions of monomer HOMOs (LUMOs). The Kohn Sham Hamiltonian was obtained from the secular equation,  = SCEC−1 by making use of Symmetry Adapted Linear Combination (SALC) of Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) approach with PW91 Density functional method along with TZP basis set available in ADF,34 where the diagonal elements are the site energies e1(2) and off diagonal elements are the charge transfer quantity, h12, both in a non-orthonormal basis. When we transform the t12 to an orthonormal basis we get the effective charge hopping element, efft12(3), which is similar to t12 in equation (1). (3)
Single-crystal structure

Diffraction data were collected at 294 K for both the structures using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) on a Bruker Axs SMART CCD diffractometer. The collected frames were processed with the software SAINT35 (Bruker, 2001). The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 (Sheldrick,2008) and refined by full-matrix least-squares refinement using SHELXL-97 (Sheldrick,2008).36

Device fabrication
For the EL studies, Indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with sheet resistance of 20 Ω were photo lithographically patterned and cleaned using trichloroethylene, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water sequentially for 20 minutes using an ultrasonic bath and dried in flowing nitrogen. Prior to film deposition, the ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 5 minutes. On the substrate, the hole transport layer, emitting layers, electron injecting LiF layer and Al cathode were deposited sequentially under a high vacuum (1 × 10−5 torr). The deposition rate of organic materials were kept at 1Å/sec whereas that of LiF was 0.5 Å/sec and Al at 5Å/sec. Thickness of the deposited layers were controlled by a quartz crystal monitor. The cathode was deposited on the top of the structure through a shadow mask. A 30nm N,N-diphenyl-N′N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine, α-NPD (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a hole transport layer. The newly synthesized metal complex was used for the emitting layer and LiF (Merck, Germany) was an electron injection layer and Al, the cathode metal. The typical thickness of the different layers were ITO (120 nm)/α-NPD (30nm)/Emissive layer (28 nm)/LiF(1nm)/Al (150 nm). The size of each pixel was 3 × 4mm. The typical thickness of three layer devices fabricated with phosphorescent emitter Ir(ppy)3 doped CBP with device structure ITO(120nm)/α-NPD(30nm)/Ir(ppy)3 doped CBP(35nm)/Al(150nm), ITO(120nm)/α-NPD(30nm)/Ir(ppy)3 doped CBP(35nm)/BCP(6nm)/Alq3(28nm)/Al(150nm) and ITO(120nm)/α-NPD(30nm)/Ir(ppy)3 doped CBP(35nm)/BCP(6nm)/5(28nm)/Al(150nm). The EL spectra were measured using a Ocean Optics high resolution Spectrometer (HR-2000CG UV-NIR). The current density-voltage-luminescence (J–V–L) characteristics were measured with a luminance meter (LMT l-1009) and a Keithley 2400 programmable voltage-current digital source meter. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient conditions.
