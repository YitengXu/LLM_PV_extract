    , Accepted 4th April 2017First published on 4th April 2017AbstractTiO2 is one of the most extensively investigated materials owing to its unique properties and several promising applications. The properties of TiO2 are highly dependent on its microstructure and feature size. Herein, we report a strategy for the synthesis of hierarchical porous TiO2 with two distinguishable scales of ligament sizes, which consists of both macro-pores and meso-pores. A metallic melt dealloying process with CuTi alloy was followed to form a porous Ti precursor. Subsequently, this precursor was used as a substrate for anodization to form TiO2. By controlling the anodization potential, time and initial porous Ti ligament size, nanotubular nanotubes or nanoporous TiO2 were distributed uniformly on the ligaments of porous Ti. Both the sizes of the macropore (400 nm to 2 μm) and mesopore (10 to 30 nm) can be tuned. A core–shell structured TiO2/Ti composite with a nanoporous or nanotubular structure in the shell and un-anodized porous Ti in the core can be achieved by partial anodization. The hierarchical structure with high surface area is essential for mass transport (large pore) and functionality (small pore), which makes it a potential candidate for various applications such as in sensors and catalysts.
Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has exhibited important applications in various areas such as photovoltaics, photocatalysts, energy storage systems including supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries, and sensor devices.1–7 Nanostructured TiO2 with high surface area, more reaction sites, and distinctive electronic properties has attracted great attention for applications mentioned above. The performance of nanostructured TiO2 in different applications has strong dependence on the morphology.2,8–11 Therefore, the development of novel nanostructures and optimization of fabrication methods towards their potential applications remain a challenging task in several studies. TiO2 can be fabricated in different ways including hydrothermal reactions to form various TiO2 nanostructures in aqueous solutions,2 anodization of bulk titanium to form nanotube arrays,12–17 chemical vapor deposition,18,19 and physical vapor deposition.20 Among these methods, anodization can be regarded as a facile, inexpensive and controllable approach to fabricate TiO2 nanotube arrays. TiO2 nanotubes have been extensively studied for application as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC): the ordered TiO2 nanotubes provide vertical pathways for electron transport along the tube and thus minimize electron loss during diffusion process. However, nanotube arrays have low surface area leading to insufficient dye loading and low light-harvesting efficiency. Recently, some efforts have been made to increase the surface area of TiO2 nanotube arrays in order to enhance the efficiencies of DSSCs. Schmuki et al. synthesized bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays via anodization under an alternating voltage condition.21–24 Such bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes possess higher surface area owing to the ridges and have higher photo conversion efficiency than that of smooth walled nanotube when applied in DSSCs. These bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes were grown using an electrolyte containing environmentally hazardous HF and a rather high voltage (120 V) for more than 10 h. The synthesis is limited by long time fabrication and high voltages. Therefore, there is a need to find an efficient way to fabricate nanostructured TiO2 with higher surface areas where an enhanced performance is expected.
Dealloying, a phenomenon in corrosion science, is the selective dissolution of less noble elements from an alloy.25 Dealloying can produce a monolithic sample with bicontinuous open pore/ligament structure at nanometer range scale, thereby suggesting potential applications in the fields of actuators, sensors, and catalysts.26,27 Apart from single nanoporous structures, hierarchical nanoporous structures with two distinguished scales of pore sizes were also reported to minimize the mass transport issue in order to fully utilize all the functional sites.28–30 Traditionally, dealloying was carried out in an aqueous solution where less noble elements were oxidized to corresponding metal ions. However, the number of metal elements that can be generated by dealloying in aqueous solution is limited because most of the metal elements cannot stably exist upon potential driven dissolution or acid attack. Recently, metallic melt dealloying was proposed to prepare nanoporous metals. Surprisingly, metals that normally dissolved in aqueous dealloying maintained nanoporous structure in metallic melt dealloying.31–34 In contrast to dealloying in the aqueous solution, a molten metal liquid serves as the dealloying solution, and the dissolution process selectively dissolves the elements that have a lower melting point in the metallic melt.35 This new dealloying strategy greatly enhances the choices of nanoporous materials with an integral shape. Titanium with a nanoscale porosity has been fabricated by metallic melt dealloying process, where the pore size can be modulated by controlling the precursor alloy composition, dealloying temperature and time.31–34 Controlling porous structures ensures a better modulation upon versatile application requirements.
Herein, we report a novel strategy to fabricate a free-standing bicontinuous 3D hierarchical macro/mesoporous TiO2 (HM2-TiO2) with a nanoporous or nanotubular structure using porous Ti instead of Ti foil as the substrate. By partially anodizing porous Ti obtained from the melt dealloying process, a core–shell composite was fabricated. The composite consists of nanoporous or nanotubular TiO2 on the shell and a porous Ti framework in the core. The core/shell structure is expected to combine the merits of metallic porous Ti framework, which can be used as a current collector, and nanoporous/nanotubular TiO2, which provides functionality due to the unique structure and nanoscale size effects.
Experimental
Synthesis of porous Ti
The precursor alloy Cu70Ti30 (at%) ingots were prepared by arc melting (Arc Melter MAM-1, Edmund Buehler) of Cu (99.99%) and Ti (99.99%) under an argon atmosphere (99.9995%). A melt spinning device was used to form thin ribbon samples. The obtained ingots were re-melted in quartz crucibles under a purified atmosphere of inert gas and ejected onto the surface of a fast rotating copper wheel at cooling rates around 106 K s−1. Thus, the rapidly quenched alloy was obtained in the form of a continuous ribbon with a width of 5 mm and a thickness of ∼20 μm. The metallic melt dealloying was performed in a muffle furnace (resistance furnace) by immersing the ribbons into 50 g molten Mg (99.99%) dealloying solution in a SiO2 crucible at 800 °C for 10 s or 60 s. After melt dealloying, the samples were cooled to room temperature in air and immersed in 3 M HNO3 (ACS grade, Aladdin) solution for 3 h to remove Mg formed during the melt dealloying process. Finally, the samples were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water at least five times and dried at 80 °C.
Synthesis of porous TiO2
The anodic oxidation of porous Ti was performed in a typical two-electrode system. Porous Ti served as the working electrode and a carbon cloth (1 × 1 cm2) was used as the counter and reference electrodes. The anodization was performed in ethylene glycol (A. R., Beijing Fine Chemical Company, China) containing 0.25 wt% NH4F (98%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.75 wt% H2O. For porous Ti ribbons, four different potentials 10 V, 20 V, 30 V and 40 V were chosen to study potential dependence on the formation of TiO2 with a nanoscale porous structure. A direct current (DC) was employed as the power supply. After the anodization process, the samples were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water at least five times and annealed in air at 450 °C for two hours.
Characterization
The crystalline information was studied by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/max-γB) with Cu Kα radiation λ = 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA. The scan range was from 20° to 80° at a scan speed of 0.02° s−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on Hitachi SU-8020 equipped with an EDS accessory to study the microstructure evolution at different sample preparation stages and conditions. The working distance was 10–20 mm, and the accelerating voltage was 5 kV due to low conductivity of TiO2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to study the microstructure on a FEI F20 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Selected area diffraction (SAD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were also conducted with TEM. The samples for TEM were gently crushed in a mortar to get fine powders. These powders were dispersed in ethanol solution in a capsule using an ultrasonic bath for dispersion and collected on a Cu grid with a carbon film. Raman spectrum was measured on Dilor XY microspectrometer with 532 nm laser excitation.
Results and discussions
The strategy to prepare 3D HM2-TiO2 can be illustrated by the scheme diagram shown in Fig. 1. Mg and Cu are miscible while Mg and Ti are immiscible at a high temperature above the melting point of Mg, as shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows the formation of porous Ti via the melt dealloying process. Cu and Ti formed an intermetallic compound with the composition of Cu70Ti30 (at%). Due to different miscibility among Cu, Ti and Mg, Cu moves into Mg melt while leaving Ti intact when immersed in the Mg melt. During this process, Ti forms a porous structure. Finally, a chemical dealloying process removes the attached Mg during the melt dealloying. The schematic diagram for the preparation of 3D HM2-TiO2 and its core/shell composites is shown in Fig. 1c. Taking porous Ti as the template, TiO2 was formed on the surface of Ti ligaments through the anodization process. With complete anodization, all Ti was oxidized to TiO2. By partial anodization, only a part of Ti was oxidized and a core/shell structure formed with TiO2 on the shell and a porous Ti in the core as a backbone.

(b) The formation of 3D-porous Ti by dealloying in a metallic melt: initially, Cu70Ti30 alloy was immersed in the Mg melt, only Cu atoms were dissolved into the Mg melt, leaving Ti atoms to assemble to Ti islands (ligaments); finally, Mg was dissolved leaving the framework of the porous Ti.

The resulting porous Ti, as the precursor for anodization, indicated larger structural size of the porous network. Fig. 2 displays SEM images of porous Ti obtained from ribbon samples at the same melt temperature of 800 °C but different immersion time. The porous Ti showed a typical bicontinuous feature with 3D randomly distributed ligament/pore structures. The open-cell porous architecture in both the samples were similar to each other, while the ligament size varied from ∼400 nm (Fig. 2a and b) to ∼2 μm (Fig. 2c and d) as the immersion time increased from 10 to 60 s. Evidently, a long immersion time led to ligament coarsening without changing the bicontinuous structure. This result is consistent with that of the previous reports on ligament size of porous Ti that can be modulated via different metallic melt dealloying time and dealloying temperature.31–34 Therefore, it is possible to adjust macroporous structure sizes as per different requirements. It is believed that ligament coarsening in the melt takes place by surface diffusion of atoms, which is the same as the process in aqueous solutions.36 Moreover, the ligaments of porous Ti were quite smooth and no substructures could be found on their surfaces (Fig. 2b and d).

Fig. 3 presents the structural evolution of TiO2 on the surface of porous Ti ligaments (∼400 nm) with varying anodization times at a fixed anodization potential of 10 V. All of the ligaments were well maintained, and the substructures appeared on those ligaments after the anodization. These substructures were distributed homogeneously all over the sample. For the sample anodized for 1 min, bicontinuous porous structure of porous Ti were still maintained (Fig. 3a), and a particular feature that does not exist in the original porous Ti appeared on the surface of ligaments (Fig. 3b). This particular feature became much more evident upon longer anodization time (5 min) as depicted in Fig. 3c and d, and the overall framework still resembled original porous Ti (Fig. 2). When anodization time was further increased to 10 min (Fig. 3e), an evident substructure feature was found with higher magnification of the SEM image, as shown in Fig. 3f. A complete conversion from Ti to TiO2 was achieved after anodization for 30 min (Fig. 3g). Fig. 3h clearly shows a nanoporous feature of the substructures within the porous Ti ligaments, particularly more noticeable at the fractured surface of the ligaments. The size of nanoporous ligaments of TiO2 was too small to have a good contrast between solids and voids at the curved surfaces; therefore, the nanoporous feature was not evident on some surfaces in the SEM image. After anodization for 60 min, some cracks appeared on the porous Ti ligaments (Fig. 3i and j). Finally, these cracks ruptured upon extended anodization time for 180 min (Fig. 3k and l). Due to the growth of nanoporous substructure via anodization that started from surface to the center of ligament, the proportion of TiO2 was determined mainly by the anodization time. In general, when porous Ti was anodized at 10 V for less than 60 min, the core–shell structure composite consisting of an un-anodized porous Ti ligament core and TiO2 shell was formed. When the anodization time was more than 60 min, porous Ti was completely anodized to a bicontinuous structured nanoporous TiO2. The remaining un-anodized size was found to decrease with increase in anodization time from ligament size ∼400 nm to 0 when all of the Ti was consumed to form TiO2.

Fig. 4a presents the representative XRD patterns of porous Ti after melt dealloying and anodization and the corresponding samples after annealing process. From the XRD pattern of porous Ti, only characteristic peaks of Ti could be found, which were identified as JCPDS No. 44-1294. For the samples after anodization, only two peaks of Ti were left, which suggested that most of Ti had been anodized. This finding was consistent with those of the previous studies of mesoporous TiO2, which showed that metallic Ti was still in the oxides.37,38 Furthermore, anatase peaks appeared and peak broadening could be observed, indicating a nanocrystalline nature of the newly formed TiO2. We also performed annealing process to modify the crystalline nature of TiO2. Both anatase and rutile phases were found after annealing in the newly formed TiO2. It can be noted that Ti peaks totally disappeared after annealing. Therefore, a mixed crystal of anatase and rutile phases was formed by annealing 3D HM2-TiO2. Raman spectrum was used to verify phase information before and after the anodization process as shown in Fig. 4b. No characteristic peaks of Ti could be observed from the Raman spectra. The peaks at 413 cm−1 and 607 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of porous Ti were related to the passivation layer of TiO2 that formed during the removal of Mg in HNO3 solution. Pronounced TiO2 Raman peaks appeared when porous Ti was subjected to the anodization process. It is well known that an amorphous phase can be obtained when Ti foil was anodized; therefore, no characteristic peaks of TiO2 were expected. However, three peaks at 144, 399 and 641 cm−1 were found from the samples after anodization. The literature has reported that anatase exhibits characteristic Raman scattering at 146, 396, 515, and 641 cm−1.39 Therefore, the present Raman spectrum was identified as anatase. Peak position shifts can be attributed to nanoparticle size effect, namely small nanoparticles shift to the positive direction.14 Moreover, intensity of anodized TiO2 Raman spectrum was higher than that of porous Ti, suggesting that crystalline TiO2 was formed after the anodization. The Raman results for highly crystallized TiO2 agree well with the XRD results.

Although SEM images in Fig. 3 show that 3D HM2-TiO2 has two scales of porous structures, the low conductivity of TiO2 does not give a satisfied image quality to clarify the exact size and morphology of the substructure. Therefore, TEM was carried out to investigate the microstructure of 3D HM2-TiO2. Fig. 5a shows a typical TEM image of 3D HM2-TiO2. Two different structures can be observed: one is the dark region at the center of the porous Ti ligament, which was too thick to be clarified by TEM; the other part randomly distributes on the surface of the porous Ti ligament corresponding to the porous substructure. Fig. 5b reveals nanoporous nature of the substructures, which was found to be consistent with the observation of SEM images as shown in Fig. 3. The substructure resembled ligaments of porous Ti interconnected with each other but at a distinguished small size of ∼10 nm. The inset in Fig. 5b is the representative selected area diffraction pattern that exhibited a ring feature, indicating the polycrystalline nature of the present TiO2. Moreover, this TEM observed feature is consistent with the XRD results, wherein a broadened peak was observed suggesting a nanocrystalline nature. High-resolution image in Fig. 5c demonstrates a typical anatase phase (101) lattice plane. The TEM images confirm that the 3D HM2-TiO2 have a hierarchical structure with two different scales of structures. We have also analyzed several different areas of the different samples and did not find any un-anodized Ti particles.

For most TiO2 prepared by anodization of Ti, nanotube is the most common structure one can expect.12–17 However, the present study of 3D HM2-TiO2 shows a porous structure after anodization. In order to understand the formation of 3D HM2-TiO2, we performed a series of studies to clarify the role of anodization potential on the TiO2 structure. Three different anodization potentials 20 V, 30 V and 40 V were applied individually to clarify their role in the TiO2 structure formation on porous Ti. Fig. 6a presents the SEM image of porous Ti anodized at 20 V for 1 h. The ligament structure remained the same, while there were cracks on the ligaments with the formation of TiO2 nanotubes (Fig. 6b). This nanotubular feature became pronounced with higher anodization potentials. The SEM images of TiO2 obtained at 30 V for 30 min are shown in Fig. 6c and d, where TiO2 nanotube can be observed. To increase the anodization potential to 40 V, TiO2 nanotube were obtained after 10 min, and the ligaments of porous Ti were completely cracked (Fig. 6e and f). With various anodization potentials, the length, diameter and wall thickness of the nanotubes are summarized in Table 1. The length and diameter of nanotubular structure increased with an increase in anodization potential. The diameter was ca. 15 nm at 20 V, while it increased to ca. 30 nm at 40 V. The wall thickness was nearly the same with all three anodization potentials. The length and diameter of the nanotubular structure increased with an increase in the anodization potential. The diameter was ca. 15 nm at 20 V, while it increased to ca. 30 nm at 40 V. The wall thickness was nearly the same with all three anodization potentials.

On subjecting the samples for longer time from 10 s to 60 s in Mg melt as shown in Fig. 2, the ligament size of porous Ti increased from ∼400 nm to ∼2 μm. With the larger ligament samples, a large nanotubular TiO2 was formed after anodization at 40 V with the same configurations. Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of porous Ti dealloyed for 60 s after anodization with two different potentials of 20 and 40 V. The samples with large Ti ligaments anodized at 20 V in Fig. 7a–c show a similar nanotubular structure with samples obtained from small Ti ligaments anodization (Fig. 6a and b). Moreover, the structure of porous Ti was well maintained after the anodization process. However, when porous Ti with larger ligament was anodized at 40 V, a large nanotubular structure was formed as shown in Fig. 7d–f, which was also an example of 3D HM2-TiO2 composite obtained by partial anodization. Two regions can be found on the ligament as shown in Fig. 7e: one region is the tubular TiO2 structure at the surface and the other is the framework of porous Ti, both of which can be observed in Fig. 7f. Several joints were at the side of those large nanotubular structures.

(a), (b) and (c), anodized at 20 V for 60 min, showing a nanotubular structure, (d), (e) and (f), anodized at 40 V for 60 min, a large nanotube can be found and TiO2/Ti composites with the framework of un-anodized porous Ti. 
Monolithic nanomaterials often suffer the effective utility of their surface area as the mass transportation becomes sluggish due to diffusion limitation within them. The dilemma can be solved by introducing a second scale of large structure into it, which means to create a larger pore with fast mass or fluid transport. This is our motivation to develop this novel 3D HM2-TiO2. The macropore size can be modulated, which gives us the ability to facilitate mass transport within a monolithic nanomaterial. Moreover, the mesopore size can also be tuned by changing the anodization potential. In addition, the substructure shape can be modulated as nanoporous or nanotubular structures.
As mentioned earlier, normally, an amorphous phase can be obtained when Ti foil is anodized; however, nanocrystalline TiO2 was obtained in this study. The samples for anodization herein were porous Ti with the ligament size less than 1 μm, which is essentially different than previous reports using Ti foil. It can be noted that properties of nanomaterials significantly differ from those of their bulk counterparts. For instance, nanoparticles usually have a lower melting point owing to their high surface energy. Moreover, nanoparticles also tend to have a lower dissolution potential compared to their bulk form.40 A higher anodization potentials (60–120 V) are normally used for Ti foil, which can severely damage the porous Ti with nanoscale ligament size in this study. The main reason is the stress induced during fast anodization cannot be released within a short time, which is also supported by the study of anodization a sputtered ∼100 nm Ti film on a silicon substrate.41 Therefore, relatively low potentials were chosen to investigate the structure evolution of porous Ti during anodization in this study.
Anodization of Ti to form TiO2 in F− ion contained electrolyte has been extensively studied for several years.13,42,43 In F− ions free solution, the surface was passivated by a thin barrier oxide that formed during the anodization process, thereby stopping the anodization process. However, with F− ions, which form water soluble [TiF6]2− complexes, the thin barrier layer breaks and diffuses into the inner part of newly formed porous structure. As a result, the dissolution of Ti and formation of TiO2 continue simultaneously. Porous structure formed in TiO2 from bulk Ti foil was similar to the structure of porous Al2O3, whose formation mechanism has been well established.12 The formation of porous structure by anodization of Al2O3 can be divided into two processes: one is field-enhanced oxidation and the other is field-enhanced dissolution. Field-enhanced oxidation causes the formation of a barrier layer. The formation of pore is due to the field-enhanced dissolution of positive ions at the oxide-electrolyte interface. For Ti anodization process, a random porous layer is formed at the beginning. After the first layer is formed, the anodized layer growth is determined by field-aided transport of mobile ions through the oxide. The growth of nanotube structures (either at the interfaces between metal and oxide or between oxide and electrolyte) is dependent on the migration of the participating ionic species (Ti4+, O2−). The driving force to form the nanotube structure is the electric field applied during the anodization process. It can be inferred from the present results that the formation of porous TiO2 is related to the low anodization potential. A threshold between the formation of porous and nanotube structure exists between 10 and 20 V. The structure of anodized porous Ti transformed from porous (Fig. 2) to nanotubular structure (Fig. 6) on increasing the anodization potential. At low anodization potential, a porous structure formed while a nanotubular structure formed at high anodization potential.
Compared to earlier reports, we used ethylene glycol-based electrolyte that contains only NH4F and H2O without the hazardous and dangerous HF. In addition, the synthesis consumes much less energy and takes shorter time; for instance, large nanotube can be achieved by anodizing porous Ti at low voltage (40 V) for only 1 h. The TiO2 prepared by anodizing a Ti foil forms an array in the vertical direction where the anodized area contains only TiO2. Due to semiconductor nature of TiO2, it was not a good electrical conductor. Therefore, short length of TiO2 nanotube was expected to transfer charge to Ti substrate faster compared to traditional TiO2 obtained by anodization of Ti foil. Moreover, porous hierarchical structure increased the entire surface area of TiO2. The novel core–shell composites with TiO2 nanotube on the surface and Ti in the center not only possess excellent properties of semiconductor TiO2 but also provide good conductivity throughout Ti, which can be potentially utilized for fast electron transport.
Conclusions
In summary, we report a new strategy to fabricate hierarchical macro/mesoporous TiO2 with well-controlled microstructure via anodization of porous Ti obtained via melt dealloying process. Both of the two scales of hierarchical macro/mesoporous TiO2 can be modulated: the higher scale ligaments size can be tuned by varying metallic melt dealloying time and temperature, whereas the lower scale size of substructures can be tuned by changing anodization time and potential. With controlled anodization time, a composite structure with TiO2 on the surface and Ti in the core with faster charge transfer can be obtained. TiO2 with mixed rutile and anatase phases was confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization through subsequent annealing process. The tube length and diameter show a potential dependence, namely, higher anodization potential longer tube and larger diameter. The present hierarchical structure has large surface area and two scales of structures, which is good for mass transport (large pore) and functionality (small pore) making it a potential candidate for various applications such as sensors and catalysts.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic of the synthesis process. (a) Cu and Mg are miscible and Ti and Mg are immiscible during the melt dealloying process. (b) The formation of 3D-porous Ti by dealloying in a metallic melt: initially, Cu70Ti30 alloy was immersed in the Mg melt, only Cu atoms were dissolved into the Mg melt, leaving Ti atoms to assemble to Ti islands (ligaments); finally, Mg was dissolved leaving the framework of the porous Ti. (c) The strategy to prepare 3D hierarchical macro/mesoporous TiO2 (full anodization) and its core/shell composites (partial anodization) with porous Ti in the core and TiO2 on the shell.	 

 	Fig. 2  Scanning electron micrographs showing the cross sectioned view of porous Ti obtained by melt dealloying of a ribbon sample Cu70Ti30 (at%) at 800 °C for (a) 10 s, (b) a higher magnification, (c) 60 s, and (d) a higher magnification.	 

 	Fig. 3  Scanning electron micrographs showing structure evolution of TiO2 on the surface of porous Ti (∼400 nm) under different anodization time at a constant anodization potential of 10 V: (a) and (b) after 1 min anodization, some initial TiO2 formed, (c) and (d) after 5 min anodization, more TiO2 formed, (e) and (f) after 10 min anodization, TiO2 formation still continued, (g) and (h) after 30 min anodization, nearly full TiO2 conversion achieved, (k) and (l) after 60 min anodization, cracks formed, (i) and (j) after 180 min anodization, all the large ligaments were fractured.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of samples with porous Ti, after anodization at 10 V for 180 min and subsequently followed by annealing to modify the crystalline structure of TiO2, (b) Raman spectra of porous Ti and the sample subsequently followed by anodization at 10 V for 180 min to form TiO2, note the direct change of TiO2 characteristic Raman peaks.	 

 	Fig. 5  Microstructure of 3D hierarchical macro/mesoporous TiO2. Transmission electron microscopy (a), (b) images showing 3D hierarchical macro/mesoporous TiO2 obtained after anodization process (10 V for 60 min), (c) a high-resolution image showing typical anatase phase (101) lattice plane. The inset in b is the corresponding selected area diffraction pattern suggesting a polycrystalline feature.	 

 	Fig. 6  Scanning electron micrographs showing bicontinuous 3D macro/mesoporous TiO2 structure dependence on anodization potentials. (a) and (b) 20 V for 1 h, (c) and (d) 30 V for 30 min and (e) and (f), 40 V for 10 min.	 

20 V	15 ± 5	12 ± 3	40 ± 10
30 V	20 ± 5	15 ± 3	120 ± 15
40 V	30 ± 8	13 ± 3	300 ± 30

 	Fig. 7  Scanning electron micrographs showing the structure of 3D hierarchical macro/mesoporous TiO2 started with a porous Ti of ∼2 μm ligament size for different anodization potentials. (a), (b) and (c), anodized at 20 V for 60 min, showing a nanotubular structure, (d), (e) and (f), anodized at 40 V for 60 min, a large nanotube can be found and TiO2/Ti composites with the framework of un-anodized porous Ti.
