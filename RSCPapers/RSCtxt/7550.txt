    , Accepted 21st June 2019First published on 28th June 2019AbstractCu–Sn binary sulfide is a promising candidate for an electrode material due to its superior properties, and it has been extensively reported in solar cells and Li-ion batteries. However, there are only a few pieces of work about its use in either supercapacitors or electrocatalysts. In this work, self-assembled binary sulfides with different morphologies in terms of 1D Cu–Sn–S micron-tubes (MTs-CTS), 1D Cu–Sn–S submicron-tubes (SMTs-CTS) and 3D Cu–Sn–S hoya-like micron-spheres (MPs-CTS) with honeycomb pores were successfully fabricated via a facile gelation–solvothermal–annealing three-step method. The results show that MPs-CTS achieve better electrochemical performance compared with MTs or SMTs. The optimized MPs-CTS exhibit a higher capacitance value (1134.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), better rate capability, and longer-term cycle stability (94.2% retention after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Moreover, the MPs-CTS also display excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with the lowest overpotential of 302 mV and a small Tafel slope of 78 mV dec−1. This work provides an effective route for the design and preparation of a 3D hoya-like structure with multiple functions, such as energy storage and electrocatalysis.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of modern science and technology, more and more researchers are concerned about energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors (SCs) and Li-ion batteries. Among them, SCs are drawing international attention by virtue of their remarkable characteristics: for instance, long working lifetimes, high power density, good safety and fast charge–discharge ability.1,2 However, their lower energy density and higher costs than lithium ion batteries are hindering their practical applications in the developing electronic era. Therefore, designing and optimizing electrode materials with desirable structures will be an effective strategy to gain high supercapacitive performance.3 Additionally, the electrocatalytic behaviors of the materials are an important issue for electrochemical applications. A highly active electrocatalyst can obviously decrease overpotentials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Pt is the most representative electrocatalyst for HER, but this noble metal's high cost and single function are hindering its wide application.4 Hence, it is essential to seek inexpensive, earth-abundant and effective electrode materials for SCs and HER.
In recent research, metal sulfides, such as SnS, MoS2, CuS, SnS2 and CoS2, have attracted great research interest on account of their low cost, excellent redox reversibility, high theoretical capacities, environmental friendliness and thermal stability.5,6 Luo et al. prepared NiS2 with porous hollow micron-spheres by a hydrothermal process, which displayed superior activity for HER in KOH solution.7 Nazish Parveen et al. described flower-like SnS exhibiting a high capacitance value (431.82 F g−1 at 1 A g−1).8 Zhang et al. reported a 3D interconnected CuS nanowall by a facile in situ growth method, which displayed high electrochemical performance.9 These results reveal that a special morphological structure, porosity and electronic conductivity are some critical factors which can enhance the electrochemical activity of the electrode material.
Latterly, binary metal sulfides have shown more excellent electrochemical performance and higher electrical conductivity than single metal sulfides, promoting electron transfer on the surface of electrode material because of their rich redox reactions and multiple oxidation states. Feng et al. studied hyacinth-like Ni–Al binary sulfuration with excellent electrochemical performance.10 Cu–Sn–S, a non-toxic and earth-abundant binary sulfide, has been widely applied in the domains of solar cells, gas sensing, and Li-ion batteries.11,12 However, only a few studies have been reported on Cu–Sn–S electrode materials for supercapacitor and electrocatalysts applications. V. Maheskumar et al.13 reported an irregularly patterned Cu4SnS4 which exhibited a relatively small Tafel slope of 110 mV dec−1 and an improved overpotential of 358 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. A. C. Lokhande et al.14 synthesized an orthorhombic structure Cu4SnS4 material with a capacitance of 704 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Nevertheless, the fabrication of self-assembled Cu–Sn sulfide with different microstructures has not been well excavated, and it is supposed it will display remarkable electrochemical performance for SCs and HER.
Based on the above considerations, self-assembled Cu–Sn binary sulfides with micron-tube, submicron-tube and micron-particle morphologies were successfully prepared by a simple gelation–solvothermal–annealing three-step method. To our knowledge, there have been few reports on the morphological control of self-assembled CTS materials by changing the experimental conditions. In general, the prominent electrochemical performance of an electrode material is closely related to its microstructure and morphology, which can be controlled by adjusting some experimental conditions, such as temperature, pH value, reaction rate, precipitating agents, etc.15 In our work, the prepared three-dimensional (3D) hoya-like micron-sphere structure is composed of lots of thin nanosheets. The unique porous structure is like a buffering reservoir which facilitates the penetration of electrolytes into the electrode surface, and shortens the ion diffusion pathway. These electrode materials with self-assembled morphology also exhibit outstanding characteristics, such as sufficient and efficient transport channels, high electrical conductivity and effective electroactive sites. The results show that the fabricated 3D MPs-CTS electrode has a higher capacitance value and a better rate capability with good cycling stability compared to those fabricated with SNTs or NTs. The capacitive value of Cu–Sn binary sulfide is obviously improved, compared with the previously reported studies on Cu2ZnSnS4/RGO (591 F g−1)16 and Cu4SnS4 (704 F g−1).14 In addition, the Cu–Sn binary sulfides also display excellent electrochemical catalytic activity for the HER reaction, which can gain a lowest overpotential of 302 mV and 78 mV dec−1 of Tafel slope at 10 mA cm−2. It is hoped that Cu–Sn binary sulfide as a high-performance electrode material can be widely applied in the supercapacitor and electrocatalytic fields.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials preparation

2.1.1 Preparation of MTs-CTS. 
4 mmol of thioacetamide (TAA) was dissolved in 20 mL of ethanol by vigorous stirring to form solution A. In addition, 2 mmol of CuCl and 1 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O were added into 20 mL of ethanol to form solution B by vigorous stirring. Then, solution A was mixed quickly with solution B and stirred vigorously for several minutes to form a white gel. The mixture solutions were poured into 50 mL stainless steel autoclaves and were heated to 160 °C for 16 h. They were subsequently naturally cooled to room temperature, and the products were centrifuged and washed using ethanol and deionized water several times, and then dried at 70 °C. The final products were heated to 400 °C in a tube furnace in an N2 environment for 4 h with a ramping rate of 4 °C min−1. Finally, the Cu–Sn sulfide micron-tubes were obtained.


2.1.2 Preparation of SMTs-CTS. 
The preparation process of SMTs-CTS is similar to that of MTs-CTS except that CuCl2 solution was used as the Cu source.


2.1.3 Preparation of MPs-CTS. 
In contrast, the MPs-CTS were synthesized by adding solution B into solution A drop by drop. The subsequent process was the same as for the preparation of Cu–Sn–S NTS.

2.2. Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical experiments, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), AC-impedance, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), were undertaken in a three-electrode electrochemical system with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation.

2.2.1 Evaluation of capacitance performance. 
For the supercapacitors, a platinum sheet, saturated calomel (SCE) electrode and Ni foam coated with the electrode materials were used as the counter electrode, reference electrode and working electrode, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared using a homogeneous slurry consisting of 80% prepared materials, 15% acetylene black and 5% PTFE ethanol solution, and then the mixture was coated onto the Ni form and dried at 40 °C for 4 h. The active electrode materials were weighed before and after drying, and each electrode material loading was approximately 2.2 mg. The electrochemical experiments were performed in 6.0 M KOH aqueous solution.


2.2.2 Evaluation of the HER. 
For the hydrogen evolution reaction, 5 mg catalyst samples were put into a 0.5 mL 5 wt% Nafion solution (Nafion:ethanol = 1:10) and were then ultrasonicated for approximately 40 min to form a homogeneous slurry. Subsequently, 5 μL of slurry was drop coated onto a glassy carbon electrode with a 3 mm diameter. Then, the GC electrode with the coated catalyst was dried at the current temperature. A saturated calomel electrode, platinum wire and glassy carbon electrode (0.07 cm2) were used as the reference electrode, counter electrode and working electrode, respectively. LSV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. All the reported potentials were referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation:17E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.059PH + 0.2224.

2.3. Material characterization
The morphologies, structures and the elemental composition of these products were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM images (JEM-2100F, Japan), scanning electron microscopy (Quanta 450, FEG), X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X'Pert3, Netherlands with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15406 Å), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5072 with Al Kα radiation), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2020).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Schematic illustration, structure, morphology and the elemental composition characterization
The self-assembled formation of Cu–Sn–S MTs, SMTs and MPs is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The synthesis procedure included three steps: firstly, TAA solution and CuCl (CuCl2), SnCl4·5H2O solutions were each vigorously stirred, and were then mixed rapidly to form a white gel. Subsequently, the white gel underwent a solvothermal process. Finally, the 1D Cu–Sn–S MTs, SMTs were gained by an annealing treatment. However, the reaction process for the Cu–Sn–S MPs was different from those for MTs and SMTs. In the first place, TAA solution was added dropwise into a mixed solution containing CuCl and SnCl4 to form a white gel with a little precipitate. In the second step, the mixture was converted in steel autoclaves and went through hydrothermal reactions and then calcination to get the MPs. It should be inferred that the reaction rate plays a main role in the morphologies of the samples. The fast reaction rate generally leads to a lot of nucleations and then the nucleations agglomerate to form nanoparticles. Finally, these nanoparticles with unique surface properties self-assemble into 1D micron-tubes and submicron-tubes under hydrothermal conditions. But for the slow reaction rate, the preferred growth of lower free energy crystalline plane results in nanosheets, and then these nanosheets intersect to form hoya-like micron-spheres to further reduce the free energy of the system during the hydrothermal process.

To investigate the phase alignment and crystallinity of the as-synthesized products, XRD characterizations were carried out. Fig. 2 shows that the diffraction peaks of the Cu–Sn–S MPs mainly appeared at 28.58°, 47.50° and 56.19° corresponding to the (111), (220) and (312) planes, which can be attributed to the phase of Cu2SnS3 (JCPDS 89-2877). It was confirmed that the MPs consisted of the Cu2SnS3 phase alone.18 Moreover, the diffraction peaks of the MTs and SMTs indicated a mixture of the Cu3SnS4 (JCPDS 36-0217), Cu2SnS3 and Cu4SnS4 phases. The diffraction peaks located at 28.49°, 33.16°, 47.80° and 56.28° are indexed to the (112), (020), (024) and (132) planes of Cu4SnS4 (JCPDS 71-0129).19 It should be noted that the diffraction peaks of the MTs contain a greater diffraction component of the Cu4SnS4 phase state and less Cu3SnS4. In contrast, Cu3SnS4 is the main phase component of the SMTs. The porous structure of the samples was further determined by an N2 adsorption–desorption test. The results are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

XPS measures were also characterized to attain the valence state and compositional information of the elements in the MPs-CTS. The XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 3a displays the convincing presences of Cu, S and Sn in NPs-CTS. The characteristic peaks of Cu 2p appeared at 933.6 eV (Cu 2p3/2) and 952.7 eV (Cu 2p1/2), which were consistent with the peaks of Cu(I). The obvious peaks of Sn 3d can be seen at 486.8 (Sn 2p5/2) and 496.1 eV (Sn 2p3/2) with a splitting energy of 8.7 eV, which were ascribed to Sn(IV). One wide peak of S 2p includes 162.4 eV (S 2p3/2) and 161.2 eV (S 2p1/2); moreover, the second peak at 168.5 eV implied that there existed a sulfate or sulfite-like species because of the strong interaction between the S element and absorbed oxygen.20 XPS analysis indicated that the prepared CTS micron-spheres were composed of the elements Cu, Sn and S, which was in agreement with the reports in the literature.20

The morphology of the samples was imaged by SEM. Fig. 4(a and b) show the morphology of the as-prepared MTs, which have a 1D hierarchical micron-tube structure with an average diameter of 1.2 μm. On the other hand, the surface of the micron-tubes is not smooth, and there are lots of highly uniform micron-spheres growing on its surface. The morphology of the SMTs is shown in Fig. 4(c and d). The SMTs present a narrow slit on the micron-tubes, which is about 50 nm in width. Moreover, lots of submicron-tubes are interleaved together. In contrast, the synthesized MPs-CTS present hoya-like micron-spheres with honeycomb pores and the diameter of the micron-spheres is approximately 2–3 μm. It is worth mentioning that these micron-spheres displayed a nanosheet-assembled honeycomb-like 3D-porous structure with a rough surface. It can be foreseen that this honeycomb-like micron-sphere structure is beneficial for enhancing the utilization ratio of the active materials, providing a proper transport channel for the reaction molecules.

Further observation of the morphology of the samples was attained from the TEM images and HRTEM. Fig. 5a is an image of MTs-CTS, which shows a hollow hierarchical micron-tube with inside and outside nanoparticles. The HRTEM (Fig. 5b) displays the interplanar spacing of the lattice fringes to be 0.31 nm and 0.29 nm, which were indexed as the (111) and (200) lattice planes of Cu2SnS3 and Cu3–4SnS4.20 As shown in Fig. 5(c and d), there existed lots of small particles on the surface of the submicron-tubes, where the lattice fringes of d = 0.29 nm corresponded to the (126) or (112) crystal planes of Cu3SnS4 (JCPDS 36-0217) and Cu4SnS4. The TEM image of MPs is shown in Fig. 5(e and f). The observation indicates that an individual micron-sphere is composed of a large number of nanosheets whose thickness is only several nanometers. The lattice fringes of the (112) and (312) facets18 can be clearly observed in the HRTEM photograph (Fig. 5f), and were consistent with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns.

3.2. Electrochemical properties
To evaluate the electrochemical performances of the prepared electrode material, some electrochemical measurements were investigated. Fig. 6a and Fig. S2(a, b) (ESI†) depict the CV curves of MPs-CTS, MTs-CTS and SMT-CTS at different scan rates ranging from 3 to 20 mV s−1, with the potential changing from 0 to 0.7 V in 6 M KOH. As can be seen, a pair of strong redox peak appears at various scan rates, indicating that the electrochemical capacitance comes mainly from faradaic pseudo-capacitance, rather than double layer capacitance.21 The redox peak may be contributed by the conversion of Cu+ to Cu2+, Sn2+ to Sn4+, as in the following equations:22,23 SnS + 2OH− → SnS(OH)2 + 2e(1) Cu2S + 2OH− → Cu2S(OH)2 + 2e(2)
 Fig. 6  CV curves of MPs-CTS (a) at various scan rates; and comparative CV curves (b) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. 
Meanwhile, with the increase of sweep rates, the corresponding current value increases quickly and the reduction peaks and oxidation peaks shift to lower and higher potentials, respectively. However, the MPs-CTS electrode shows a smaller shift from 0.320 to 0.388 V compared to the change in the MTs-CTS electrode from 0.271 to 0.380 V and in the SMTs-CTS electrode from 0.31 to 0.40 V. This indicates that a fast faradaic reversible reaction and a rapid ionic transport rate happen at the interface of electrolyte and electrode.24 At a higher rate, the shape of the CV is still maintained, indicating good rate ability and capacitive behavior. The CV comparison curves of three electrodes at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 6b. It is obvious that the MPs-CTS electrode has a significantly larger integrated area than the others, implying a higher energy storage ability for the MPs-CTS electrode.
To investigate the rate capability and the capacitance of the as-obtained samples, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements were conducted within the range −0.248 to 0.4 V. Fig. 7a depicts the GCD curves of three electrodes at a current density of 1 A g−1. As can be seen, the charge–discharge curves show obvious voltage plateaus with pseudocapacitive characteristics, which are consistent with the CV results. The longest discharge time of the MPs-CTS electrode indicates its highest capacitance values compared to the others. The specific capacitances of the three electrodes were calculated according to the corresponding equation. The calculated capacitance values for MPs, SMTs and MTs are 1134.2, 981.0 and 881.9 F g−1, respectively. The enhanced capacitance performance of the MPs-CTS electrode is comparable to previous reports based on CuS or SnS composite electrodes, such as CuS,5 SnS2,8 Cu2SnS318 Cu4SnS4,14 CuMoS,23etc. (Table S1, ESI†). Fig. 7(b–d) display the GCD curves for the three kinds of electrodes at current densities ranging from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1. The GCD plots of MPs-CTS present nearly symmetric shapes at different current densities, which indicates good coulombic efficiency and reversible Faraday reactions. The specific capacitance values of the MPs-CTS electrode are 1134.2, 888.9, 788.8, 729.0, 690.7 and 670.8 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The specific capacitances of the three electrodes at different current densities are exhibited in Fig. 7(e). The discharge time and specific capacitance decrease gradually with an increase in discharge current density, on account of the diffusion effect restricting the penetration and diffusion of electrolyte ions at high current density.25 The outstanding performance of MPs-CTS can be attributed to two reasons: firstly, better conductivity and rich Faraday reactions; secondly, the novel and unique 3D structure with appropriate channels, which may supply more electroactive sites for the intercalation of electrolyte ions to raise the utilization during the reaction process.

The cycling stability of an energy storage material is another key parameter in supercapacitors.26 The long-term cycling measurements of the as-prepared materials were carried out for 2000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 8, the specific capacitances of MPs-CTS remained stable over the initial 1600 cycles and then slowly decreased, while the other samples displayed an obvious decrease. The capacitance retention for the three electrodes remained at 94.2%, 89.1%, and 74.8% of the initial value after 2000 cycles, respectively. This indicates that the MPs-CTS show better cycling stability than SMTs and MTs. The long-term cycling stability of MPs-CTS may profit from their novel 3D structure, which could ease mass transportation of electrolyte ions and electrons, raising the interfacial area of the electrode material.

To gain further understanding of the electrochemical behavior, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of all the samples was carried out and the Nyquist curves are presented in Fig. 9. The plots are composed of an inclined line and a high-frequency semicircle, which represent charge transfer resistance (Rct) and ion diffusive impedance (W0) from the active material/electrolyte interface.27 The intersection of the semicircles with the X-axis displays the internal resistance (Rs), which comes from the intrinsic resistance of the substrate/electrolyte. The MPs-CTS electrode displays a lower Rct (0.4 Ω) than MTs-CTS (1.2 Ω) or SMTs-CTS (0.8 Ω). This reveals that the better electronic conductivity and more rapid electronic transfer at the MTs-CTS electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effect coming from tin and copper in bimetallic sulfide, the porous structure, and 3D hoya-like micron-sphere morphology. Besides, the slope of the straight line in the MPs-CTS electrode is closer to 90° than in the other samples. This may be due to the improved contact between the electroactive materials and the electrolyte.
 Fig. 9  EIS of MTs-CTS, SMTs-CTS and MPs-CTS. 
To further understand the practical application advantages of the Cu–Sn sulfide samples, the electrocatalytic activity for HER of the materials with different morphologies were also investigated. Fig. 10a presents typical polarization curves in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. As can be seen in Fig. 10a, the LSV of MPs-CTS exhibits the lowest overpotential, indicating the best electrocatalytic activity for HER. The overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for MPs-CTS, SMTs-CTS and MTs-CTS are 302, 435, 461 mV, respectively. Specifically, the electrocatalytic activity of MPs-CTS for HER is superior to that of many reported electrocatalysts, and a detailed comparison is presented in Table S2 (ESI†). Furthermore, the corresponding Tafel slopes of MPs, SMTs and MTs are displayed in Fig. 10b: the Tafel slope of MPs is about 78 mV dec−1, while that of SMTs is 84 mV dec−1 and that of MTs is 182 mV dec−1. A smaller Tafel slope implies a fast kinetic response to current during HER: that is, the smaller the Tafel slope is, the faster the HER rate increases.28 In general, the mechanism of HER consists of three possible reactions in acidic electrolyte: the Volmer step (H+(aq) + e− → Hads), the Heyrovsky process (H+(aq) + e− + Hads → H2(g)) and the Tafel process (Hads + Hads → H2). In this work, the value (78 mV dec−1) is located in the range 39–118 mV dec−1, suggesting that the HER reaction of MPs-CTS is the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism following the Heyrovsky reaction as the rate-limiting procedure.29

For a better evaluation of the intrinsic activities and reaction trend for HER, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the samples was investigated from the double-layer capacitance value (Cdl) which was calculated by testing the CV curves at different scan rates without a faradaic reaction.30 For comparison, the Cdl of MPs (3.39 F cm−2) is larger than that of SMTs (2.82 F cm−2) or MTs (1.80 F cm−2) (Fig. 10c), implying higher electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, EIS measurements were performed to further analyze the reaction kinetics for the HER process. As displayed in Fig. 10d, all the curves exhibit an obvious semicircle-like shape; the MPs-CTS shows a smaller circular diameter than the other samples. The Rct value of MPs-CTS is about 68 Ω in comparison with MTs-CTS (92 Ω) and SMTs-CTS (102 Ω). This possibly indicates that the MPs-CTS have the highest electrocatalytic activity for HER due to their lower charge transfer resistance and higher electronic conductivity. Additionally, the long-term stability of the MPs-CTS electrocatalyst was assessed at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. After 20 h of running, it showed negligible decay during continuous hydrogen evolution (Fig. 7e), suggesting excellent durability for MPs-CTS. The XRD, SEM and EIS of the three samples were characterized again after long-term cycling electrochemical tests (Fig. S3, ESI†). It can be seen that after a long-term stability test the position of each peak in the XRD pattern did not change much, and the surface morphology remained intact in the SEM image, indicating that the MPs-CTS electrode has excellent stability. By contrast, the peak intensity, surface morphology and EIS plot of other samples showed some changes after long-term cycling, thereby further validating the excellent stability of the MPs-CTS catalysts.
Based on the above results, the exciting supercapacitance performance and good electrocatalytic activity of MPs-CTS for HER can be mainly summarized in several aspects. Firstly, the 3D hoya-like structure not only provides convenient channels for electrolyte ion transport, promoting the full utilization of active materials, but it also synergistically optimizes the binding energies of the reaction intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics and improving the electrocatalytic activity. Secondly, the highly open honeycomb pores facilitate the fast dissipation of continuously produced bubbles during electrocatalysis to improve the HER catalytic performance. Thirdly, the multiple transition metals decrease the charge transfer resistance and lead to fast diffusion and reaction at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Finally, the intrinsic high electrical conductivity of bimetallic Cu–Sn–S is beneficial for accelerating electron transfer because of the relatively low electronegativity of the S element.
4. Conclusions
In summary, Cu–Sn–S electrodes with three different morphologies of micron-tubes, submicron-tubes and micron-spheres were successfully fabricated via a three-step gelation–solvothermal–annealing method. Compared with CTS micron-tubes and submicron-tubes, the self-assembled hoya-like MPs-CTS with a honeycomb porous structure possesses a better mass capacitance (1134.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and better cycling stability (the capacitance remains 94.2% after 2000 cycles). Moreover, MPs-CTS also present excellent HER performance with an overpotential of only 302 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 10 mA cm−1. These results demonstrate that controlling the microstructure and morphology is essential for enhancing the electrochemical performance of materials. It is expected that this work will provide an open possibility to prepare and design 3D hoya-like structures for promising energy storage applications.
