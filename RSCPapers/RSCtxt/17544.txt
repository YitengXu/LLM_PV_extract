    , Accepted 10th March 2023First published on 10th March 2023AbstractBy combining stereochemically active lone-pair d10 metal Cd2+ with halogen anions was identified as an effective method to obtain enhanced nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. In this work, hybrid lead-free perovskite [Me3NCH2Cl]CdCl3 (abbreviated as (TMCM)CdCl3) bulk crystals were grown by the solution method, which demonstrates the one-dimensional chainlike perovskite structure with distorted {CdCl6} irregular octahedrons. The environmental, temperature, and atmospheric stabilities were systematically evaluated with a reversible transition and the phase decomposition point were determined at 125 and 271 °C, respectively. In addition, high environmental and high solvent atmospheric stability were also detected. A wide transparent region (200–900 nm) and wide band gap of 5.24 eV were determined with a moderate second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 0.73 times that of KH2PO4. Furthermore, theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the relationship between structure and performance, and an applicable birefringence of 0.043 was calculated at 1064 nm. All the results make (TMCM)CdCl3 a promising candidate for NLO material, which may also have potential applications in the solar-blind UV region.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites (OIMHPs) have emerged as a new class of functional materials due to their merits of abundant structures and fascinating physical properties, such as optoelectronic, semi-conductive, photoluminescent, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties.1–8 The three-dimensional (3D) structural Pb-based halide perovskites as significant materials of OIMHPs demonstrate excellent performances and have potential applications in optoelectronic fields.9,10 However, they still endure two main disadvantages, the environmental and biological toxicities of heavy-metal Pb, as well as poor temperature and chemistry stability under exposure to moisture, heat, and light.11–13 Therefore, it is very urgent to develop OIMHPs with environment-friendly, high stability, and outstanding performances.
The second-order nonlinear optical crystals harboring the ability to generate second harmonic generation (SHG) coherent light play an important role in the areas of frequency shifting, telecommunications, biological tissue imaging, medical treatment, optical lithography, and laser remote sensing.14–19 In particular, the solar-blind region stretching across 200–280 nm is important to nutrition disinfection, military communication, and fire safety system.20–22 Generally, the requirements for SHG characteristics include a noncentrosymmetric (NCS) structure, a large band gap, a large SHG effect, moderate birefringence for phase matching (PM), and easy fabrication of bulk crystals.21,22 However, few materials can satisfy all these prerequisites simultaneously, and the SHG studies of OIMHPs are limited. The distorted octahedrons of perovskite functional materials may lead to NCS structures as well as SHG characteristics.8,13 Thus, it is a great crucial task and academic interest to discover and exploit the NLO performances of perovskite functional materials with NCS structures, especially those with potential applications in solar-blind UV ranges.
Recently, hybrid metal halide perovskite [Me3NCH2Cl]CdCl3 (ref. 23–29) with a one-dimensional chainlike structure possessing excellent piezoelectric properties aroused our tremendous attention and interest. Firstly, cadmium (Cd2+)-based metal halide perovskites are nontoxic, environment-friendly, and earth-abundant. Secondly, low-dimensional OIMHPs usually demonstrate higher stability when compared with their 3D counterparts.13,30 Thirdly, the piezoelectric property is often accompanied by second-order NLO characteristics, because both properties require the noncentralsymmetric structure. Furthermore, the combination of stereochemically active lone-pair d10 metal cations (SCALP, such as Cd2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+) that exhibited second-order Jahn–Teller (SOJT) distortion with halogen anions proved to be an effective method to enhance the SHG effect.31 Therefore, in this work, bulk crystals of hybrid metal halide perovskite [(CH3)3NCH2Cl]CdCl3 were grown, and the structure, environmental/temperature and atmosphere stability, transmittance, SHG effect, and related theoretical calculations were systematically performed. For the first time, we identified [(CH3)3NCH2Cl]CdCl3 as a promising solar-blind UV NLO material.
Experimental
Crystal growth
A white solid of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium chloride (TMCM-Cl, 10 mmol) was prepared in a round-bottom flask (50 ml) by reduced pressure distillation as described in previous literature.23 CdCl2 (10 mmol, 1.8332 g), methanol (20 mL), and HCl (36.5 wt%, 3 mL) were respectively added to the above round-bottom flask, and a clear solution was formed after sealing and stirring for 24 hours at 25 °C. Next, the above precursor solution was poured into a flask covered by a perforated polyethylene sheet for the crystal growth of (TMCM)CdCl3.
Single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction
Single crystal X-ray diffraction data of (TMCM)CdCl3 were collected at 25 °C using a Bruker SMART APEX II 4K CCD diffractometer furnished with a CCD detector (monochromatic Mo-Kα radiation). Using Olex2 software, the structure was solved by a direct method refined by full-matrix least-squares minimisation. The crystallographic parameters for (TMCM)CdCl3 are listed in Table S1.† The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment was performed using PANalytical X-ray Diffractometer Model X pert3 equipped with Cu-Kα radiation over the 2-theta ranges of 10–60°.
Stability analyses
The environmental, temperature, and atmospheric stability were evaluated for (TMCM)CdCl3 single crystals. The XRD experiments of the newly synthesized crystals with those of samples that were exposed to air at environmental conditions for one year were carried out to study the environmental stability. The simultaneous thermal analyzer of thermal gravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA), and PXRD samples annealed at different temperatures (unannealed, annealed at 100 °C and 150 °C) were performed to investigate the temperature stability. Thereinto, a Pyris Diamond TG/DTA analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Corporation of U.S.) was used to measure the simultaneous thermal analyzer. The XRD experiments of (TMCM)CdCl3 powers that were exposed to different solvents in saturated or supersaturated atmospheres (water, acetonitrile, methanol, and ethanol) for different times (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 hours) were performed to research atmosphere stability.
UV-visible-near-infrared diffuse reflectance absorption and transmission spectra
The absorption and transmission spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 1050) with an integrating sphere in the spectral range from 190 to 900 nm, and spectral pure BaSO4 was selected as a reference with 100% reflectance.
SHG measurement
Powder SHG measurement was performed using laser irradiation of 1064 nm produced by a Q-switched Nd–YAG laser using the Kurtz–Perry method. In general, the SHG intensity of the beam generated by samples is closely related to the particle size, and (TMCM)CdCl3 was divided into a series of discreet particle sizes of 38–55, 55–88, 88–105, 105–150, 150–200, and 200–250 μm. The microcrystalline KDP powers with the same sizes were chosen as a reference.
Theoretical calculations
The first-principles calculations for band structure and density of states of (TMCM)CdCl3 were carried out using the plane-wave pseudopotential method32 adopting the CASTEP program.33 During the entire calculation process, the exchange–correlation terms were sketched using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)34 with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function.35 The kinetic energy cutoff was set as 800 eV, and the Monkhorst-Pack k-point meshes were chosen as 5 × 5 × 2 in the Brillouin zone to ensure the adequate accuracy of the theoretical calculation. The norm-conserving pseudopotentials 50 were chosen to simulate the ion–electron interactions of the constituent elements, including in H 1s1, C 2s2 2p2, N 2s2 2p3, O 2s2 2p4, Cd 4d10 5 s2, Cl 3s2 3p5. In addition, the refractive indexes were calculated by the scissor-corrected methods.36
Results and discussion
Crystal structure
Bulk and colorless (TMCM)CdCl3 single crystals were obtained by solvent evaporation method for about three weeks, as presented in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The as-grown bulk (TMCM)CdCl3 single crystals. 
The material structure has a decisive impact on the performance, the X-ray single crystal diffraction was performed to understand the crystal structure. As shown in Table S1,† (TMCM)CdCl3 belongs to the monoclinic system with a polar space group Cc, and unit cell parameters are a = 9.4797 (10), b = 15.7695(16), c = 6.7960(8) Å, β = 94.474(4)° and V = 1012.84(19) Å3. From the packing structure as exhibited in Fig. 2a, (TMCM)CdCl3 forms a typical organic–inorganic one-dimensional chainlike perovskite-type configuration, consisting of face-sharing cadmium(II) octahedrons forming [CdCl5]n3− infinite polyanionic chains parallel to the c-axis, and the protonated TMCM+ cations evenly distributed on both sides of the polyanionic chain. As shown in Fig. 2b and Table S2,† {CdCl6} octahedrons present a certain extent of structural distortions, which is confirmed by the difference of the Cd–Cl bond lengths (2.6106–2.6840 Å) and the deviation from 90° of bond angles (∠Cl–Cd–Cl of the adjacent chloride ions distributing in the range of 82.050 to 98.062°) of the {CdCl6} irregular octahedrons. Compared with centrosymmetric [(CH3)4N]CdCl3, the distortions of {CdCl6} octahedrons in (TMCM)CdCl3 most probably are the primary induction for its noncentrosymmetric structure, thus, showing some related interesting properties, such as piezoelectric, ferroelectric and nonlinear optical properties.

Stability analysis
The stability investigation of (TMCM)CdCl3 mainly included environmental, temperature, and atmospheric stability. As shown in Fig. 3a, the experimental XRD patterns of the freshly prepared samples matched well with those exposed to air for one year as well as the calculated X-ray single crystal diffraction peaks, indicating high environmental stability of the title (TMCM)CdCl3 single crystals.

The temperature stability was performed by the simultaneous thermal analyzer of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)/differential thermal analysis (DTA) and XRD. As exhibited in Fig. S2,† an onset phase decomposition point of (TMCM)CdCl3 was detected by the DTA curve and determined to be 271 °C. One endothermic peak at 125 °C that corresponds to phase transition was discovered by the DSC curve, which is in good agreement with the result of the reversible second-order transition reported by Xiong et al.23 To further confirm the temperature stability and category of transition, XRD patterns of unsintered and sintered (TMCM)CdCl3 samples before and after 125 °C were measured. As shown in Fig. 3b, the XRD results of (TMCM)CdCl3 that annealed at 100 and 150 °C are in good agreement with those of unannealed samples, indicating a reversible transition at 125 °C.
The atmosphere stability was characterized by the phase analysis of (TMCM)CdCl3 samples that were exposed to different solvent (water, acetonitrile, methanol, and ethanol) atmospheres for a certain period of time (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 hours) using XRD measurements. As illustrated in Fig. 4, all the XRD peaks of the samples that were exposed to the four kinds of common solvent atmospheres up to 60 hours are still in accordance with those of the 0-hour specimen, manifesting high atmosphere stability of (TMCM)CdCl3 in water, acetonitrile, methanol and ethanol atmospheres.

UV-visible-near-infrared transmission spectrum and SHG response
The transmission spectrum of (TMCM)CdCl3 is shown in Fig. 5a, from which a high and wide transparent region (200–900 nm) was observed. The optical band gap was calculated to be 5.24 eV by fitting the absorption spectrum (Fig. S3†), wider than those of reported UV NLO crystals, such as 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4′-N′-methyl-stilbazolium tosylate (DAST) (1.61 eV), 2-amino-5-nitropyridinium dihydrogen phosphate (2A5NPDP, 2.95 eV) and 4-hydroxypyridinium phosphate (4HPP, 4.69 eV), and comparable with L-arginine phosphate (LAP, 5.39 eV).20,37–39

To evaluate the second-order NLO response, the SHG measurement of (TMCM)CdCl3 was conducted on six different particle sizes by the Kurtz and Perry method using a 1064 nm laser with KDP as a standard sample. Fig. 5b illustrates the SHG intensity versus different particle sizes, from which their SHG intensities rise with increasing particle size, indicating a type-I phase-matchable behavior. An SHG conversion efficiency of 0.73 times of KH2PO4 was detected in the particle size of 150–200 μm, and a higher SHG effect may be obtained using a larger size of (TMCM)CdCl3. Of particular note is that most of the reported NCS organically templated cadmium chlorides are non-perovskite structures, such as [C3H8N]CdCl3, C12H20N6O4Cd2Cl5, Cd(C3H7NO3)Cl2·H2O, [C5H14NO]CdCl3, CdCl2(C5H9NO3) and (C4H10NO)2Cd2Cl6,13,40–44 which presented SHG responses of 0.1 to 0.73 times KDP, whereas reports on cadmium chloride perovskites with NCS structures are limited, [C4H10N]CdCl3 and [C6H11NH3]2CdCl4 presented SHG intensity of 0.4 and 0.6 times KDP, respectively.45,46
Theoretical calculations
To study the structure–property relationship of (TMCM)CdCl3, the first-principles calculations were performed to calculate the band structure, refractive index, and density of states. From the calculated band structure (Fig. 6a), (TMCM)CdCl3 is an indirect band gap crystal with its bandgap calculated as 4.49 eV, slightly lower than the experimental data of 5.24 eV on account of the discontinuity of the exchange–correlation energy used by the PBE–GGA method.
 Fig. 6  (a) Calculated band structure. (b) The calculated refractive index of (TMCM)CdCl3. (The inset illustrates the birefringence) (c) TDOS and PDOS. 
From the calculated refractive index (Fig. 6b), (TMCM)CdCl3 is a negative uniaxial crystal with no(ω) > ne(ω), and the birefringence at 1064 nm was evaluated to be 0.0439 (inset of Fig. 6b), slightly larger than that in some of the commercial NLO crystals, such as KH2PO4 (0.035)47 and LiB3O5 (0.040),48 and comparable with that of CsLiB6O10 (0.049 at 1064 nm).49 Such an applicable birefringence manifests the phase-matchable ability of (TMCM)CdCl3, which is consistent with the preceding SHG experiment.
Since the electronic states close to the Fermi level play a vital part in the optical characteristics, the total and partial densities of states (TDOS and PDOS) are greatly intuitive to explore the origin of optical absorption and NLO performances. As shown in Fig. 6c, the organic components totally overlap over the energy extension from −14 to −1 eV, indicating strong covalent interactions of N–H and C–H bonds. In addition, the valence band maximum (VBM) region predominantly contributes to Cl 3p, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) principally comprises Cl 3p and Cd 5 s. To sum up, the optical absorption (broad bandgap) and moderate SHG effect of (TMCM)CdCl3 are mainly derived from the distorted [CdCl6] octahedrons.
Conclusions
In summary, hybrid perovskite (TMCM)CdCl3 bulk crystals were synthesized, and their structure, stability, transmission spectrum, and nonlinear optical characteristics were investigated, and theoretical calculations were also performed to study the relationship between the structure and performance. The temperature, environmental, and solvent atmospheric stability were systematically analyzed, with a reversible transition at 125 °C, high environmental stability for at least one year, and high solvent atmospheric stability observed. A moderate SHG effect of 0.73 times KH2PO4 was measured, and an applicable birefringence of 0.043 @ 1064 nm was calculated. Furthermore, the origin of SHG was determined to derive from distorted {CdCl6} octahedrons using theoretical calculations. This work proves (TMCM)CdCl3 to be an NLO material with good comprehensive performances, which may also have potential applications in solar-blind UV NLO fields.
