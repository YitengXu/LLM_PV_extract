    , Accepted 13th August 2020First published on 17th August 2020AbstractAs the key component of organic solar cells (OSCs), the acceptor plays key roles in determining the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Based on the famous non-fullerene acceptor ITIC, a series of acceptors (A1–A5) were designed by introducing fused-ring units (phenanthrene, pyrene, benzopyrazine, dibenzo[a,c]phenazine, and phenanthro[4,5-abc]phenazine) as the end groups. Theoretical calculations showed that A1–A5 display improved solubility and redshifted absorption spectra compared with ITIC. More importantly, the newly designed acceptors exhibit much higher electron mobility, where the electron mobility of A5_h (similar to A5 but with the same hexyl side chain as ITIC) is about four orders of magnitude larger than that of ITIC. The computed binding energies of the donor PBDB-TF with the acceptor ITIC and A5_h are −2.52 eV and −3.75 eV, indicating much stronger interface interactions in PBDB-TF/A5_h. In terms of charge-transfer (CT) mechanism, we found that both PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h can generate CT states through direct excitation and hot excitons, meanwhile there exist more opportunities of producing CT states via the intermolecular electric field (IEF) mechanism in PBDB-TF/A5_h. Our results not only offer a set of promising ITIC-based acceptors, but also provide new insights into the donor/acceptor interface properties, which are closely related to the PCE of OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), containing interpenetrating bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend photoactive layers of solution-processable p-type donors (D) and n-type acceptors (A), have attracted great attention in recent decades for their potential applications in energy conversion and storage.1–6 In OSCs, the acceptors have been extensively explored because of their intrinsic central role in promoting the photon absorption, charge separation and transfer, and suppressing the potential charge recombination at the interfaces between donors and acceptors. The well-established acceptors based on fullerene derivatives have attracted great attention due to the advantages of low cost, light weight, excellent electron transport properties, and suitability for large-scale production.6–8 However, fullerene-based acceptors faced troubles in further improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) as a result of some inevitable defects including difficult tuning of the energy levels, poor visible light absorption, inherent tendency of easy aggregation, etc.9,10
Recently, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have emerged as promising candidates to replace the fullerene-based acceptors due to the merits of synthetic versatility, excellent electron-accepting properties, reasonably high electron mobility, and broad optical absorption.11–15 Among the non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), indacenodithienothiophene(IDTT)-based acceptors have drawn wide interests in boosting the PCE.9,16–18 NFAs possess ideal characters such as strong oscillator strengths, small optical bandgaps, reduced internal reorganization energies, remarkable electron mobility, efficient charge transfer, and synthetic tunability feature.19–22 For instance, Zhan's group synthesized the IDTT-based NFA ITIC molecule (Scheme 1) for the first time in 2015, and PTB7TH:ITIC blended films showed PCEs as high as 6.80%, which was a new record for fullerene-free solar cells in those days.23,24 In 2019, a series of IDTT-based non-fullerene acceptors, ITIC-nF (n = 0, 2, 3, 4, 6), were synthesized, where the end-group fluorination density and positioning were systematically varied.25 Subsequently, diverse structural variants based on IDTT core have been designed and synthesized, which presented their advantages in high-efficiency OSCs.26–28

The strategy of molecular engineering has proved to be a powerful tool in tuning the IDTT skeleton with diverse functional groups. The IDTT core has been extended by side part alkyl substitution, heteroatom replacement, and end part modification by aromatic groups.16,17,19–21,26,28,29 The structural variants obtained could exhibit expanded absorption range, tuned the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, enhanced electron mobility, all of which improve the short-circuit current density (Jsc) as well as the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and ultimately enhance the PCE.
In this work, we designed a set of new ITIC-based acceptors (see Scheme 1) composed of different aromatic end-capped groups (A1: phenanthrene, A2: pyrene, A3: benzopyrazine, A4: dibenzo[a,c]phenazine, A5 and A5_h: phenanthro[4,5-abc]phenazine). Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) were carried out to investigate the geometric and electronic structures, solubility, and optical properties of ITIC and the newly designed molecules. Moreover, the intermolecular charge transport properties of the studied molecules were evaluated by Marcus semi-classical model. Furthermore, we discussed the charge transfer mechanisms at the two interfaces composed by the donor PBDB-TF with the acceptor ITIC or A5_h, where the two acceptors have the same hexyl side chain and the influences coming from different side chains will not appear. Our results are expected to offer guidance for further theoretical and experimental researches on OSCs.
Computational methods
The geometries of all investigated single molecules were relaxed to their potential energy minima at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level.30–32 All optimized geometries show no imaginary frequency, which ensures energetic minima. The absorption spectra and corresponding excitation energies of acceptors were evaluated using the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) based on M05/6-311G(d,p).33,34 The solvent effects were considered by using the polarizable continuum model (PCM)35 in chlorobenzene to keep consistent with the experiments25,36–38 where chlorobenzene was employed as solvent for ITIC. Since the long alkyl branches have proven to contribute little to the total density-of-state, that is, replacing the alkyl branched chain by the methyl group (–CH3) has insignificant influence on the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) and optoelectronic properties.39,40 Thus, except for the calculations on solubility, electron mobility and D/A interface properties, all the alkyl branched chains were replaced by the methyl group to save computation cost. In order to distinguish different molecules and show the relationship between them, the molecule formed by replacing the hexyl groups in ITIC with methyl groups is named ITIC′, and the molecule composed from A5 by the substituting all methyl groups with hexyl groups is named A5_h. All calculations were performed by using Gaussian 16 code.41
For the crystal structure prediction, firstly the single point energies of the optimized molecules were calculated in Dmol342,43 with the accuracy setting in fine. Then the electrostatic potential and population analysis were carried out. Next, the crystal structures were predicted by using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)44 exchange–correlation energy functional and the Dreiding force field.45 Five most probable space groups (P21/c, P1, P2121, P21 and P2/c) were restricted. This part was done in the polymorph module, which has proven as a useful method in predicting the crystal structure. The above calculations were done using Materials Studio software.46,47 Based on the obtained crystal structures, the transfer integral was computed at the M06-2X/6-31G (d,p) level, which has proven to suitable in describing the non-covalent interaction.48 The non-covalent interaction (NCI) and ESP were analysed with the assistance of Multiwfn 3.7 version.49
Results and discussion
Geometric and electronic structures
Whether the energy levels match or not is a precondition for a molecule to be an acceptor in OSCs.50 For acceptors, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level affects the Voc, and the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level determines whether the hole can be effectively blocked. Fig. 1 shows the energy levels of the investigated molecules. The ELUMO was obtained using EHOMO plus the first excitation energies.51 As can be seen, the ELUMO and EHOMO of ITIC are −3.87 eV and −5.63 eV, respectively, which match well with the experimental result of −3.83 eV and −5.48 eV.23 The HOMO energy level (−5.64 eV) and the LUMO energy level (−3.87 eV) of ITIC′ are almost the same as those of ITIC, which shows that the methyl side chain has negligible effects on the electronic energy levels, and verifies the rationality of using methyl to replace the long chain in the calculations. The ELUMO values of the newly designed molecules are in the range of −4.16 eV to −3.74 eV, which are lower than the ELUMO of −3.64 eV of the donor PBDB-TF,52 ensuring efficient electron transfer from PBDB-TF to the acceptors. On the other hand, the EHOMO values of A1–A5 are lower than the EHOMO of −5.48 eV of PBDB-TF, meaning that the hole transfer is prevented effectively. It is worth noting that the LUMO of A4 is 0.08 eV higher than that of A3 due to the 0.04 eV lower HOMO energy level and 0.04 eV smaller excitation energy for A4. In Fig. 2, we can see the HOMO orbitals are delocalized on the domain to the ring connected with 2-methylenemalononitrile (2-cyanoethylene), while the LUMO orbitals are delocalized beyond the benzene ring connected with 2-methylenemalononitrile (2-cyanoethylene). That is, all the designed molecules may have good electron transport properties due to a wide LUMO distribution. In Fig. 2, the values below the FMO diagrams represent the contribution of the end group to the orbitals. We can see the contributions of the end groups to the HOMO (3.5% for A3, 3.6% for A4) of A3 and A4 are similar to that (3.9%) of ITIC. In addition, the contributions of the end groups in the newly designed acceptors (A1, A2, and A5) to the HOMO and LUMO have been greatly improved than those in ITIC. In detail, the contributions of the end groups to the LUMO in A1–A5 are 47%, 66%, 129%, 201% and 95% higher than that in ITIC. The above results show that the newly designed acceptors possess suitable energy levels.

Optical properties and solubility
The absorption properties were characterized in the TD-M05/6-311G(d,p) level on the optimized ground state geometries in order to gain insights into the electronic transition and excitation properties. The inset Table of Fig. 3 summarizes the computed maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) and the oscillator strengths (f) of the studied compounds. The λmax of ITIC molecule is 649 nm, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (668 nm).25 The absorption spectra of ITIC′ and ITIC coincide basically, indicating that the substitution of long alkyl chain by methyl group has little effect on the optical properties. Compared with the first three molecules (ITIC, A1–A2) without N heterocycles, A3–A5 with N heterocycles not only have bigger λmax (743 nm for A3, 727 nm for A4, 711 nm for A5), but also exhibit a little larger oscillator strengths (3.46 for A3, 3.72 for A4, 3.73 for A5). From ITIC, A1 to A2, with the increased number of benzene rings, the maximum absorption wavelength appears red shift and the oscillator strength decreases. However, from A3 to A5, with the increased number of benzene rings, the blue shift of the absorption wavelength occurs, and the oscillator strength increases. To further understand the overall absorption of sunlight by ITIC and A1–A5, the absorption spectra were simulated. As shown in Fig. 3, significant red shifts occurred in the absorption spectra of A3–A5, while the red shifts of A1–A2 are not obvious. A1–A5 exhibit larger oscillator strengths than those of ITIC. For the whole spectrum, compared with the ITIC, the newly designed molecules exhibit not only wider absorption range, but also higher absorption intensity in the range of 300–1100 nm.

A significant advantage of small molecule acceptors for efficient and stable bulk heterojunction solar cells is that they can be fabricated at moderate conditions with the assistance of the solution phase processed film-forming process.16,53,54 In order to create bicontinuous interpenetrating network morphology with optimal domain size the solubility of acceptors in organic solvents is an inevitable factor to be considered, which can suppress its large aggregation in the donor–acceptor bulk heterojunction film.6 The solubility can be estimated by the solvation free energy (ΔGsol) with HF/6-31G(d), which is defined as the difference of free energy for the solute in the solution and gas phases.55–57 The more negative the solvation free energy, the more soluble the materials. The higher solubility of acceptors in organic solvent is beneficial for improving the film-forming ability. Experimentally, chlorobenzene was commonly employed to dissolve ITIC molecule,25 so we evaluated the solubility of the studied molecules in chlorobenzene. Considering the fact that the solubility is sensitive to the alkyl side chains, we have calculated the ΔGsol values of ITIC, ITIC′ and A5_h in addition to A1–A5 molecules. As shown in Fig. 4, the ΔGsol values are −18.59 and −19.58 kcal mol−1 for ITIC′ and ITIC, −22.84 and −23.79 kcal mol−1 for A5 and A5_h, which suggests that the solubility is enhanced by about 1 kcal mol−1 if the four methyls are replaced by hexyls. Furthermore, the ΔGsol values of the A1–A5 are in the range of −20.80 to −22.84 kcal mol−1, indicating that the newly designed molecules possess higher solubility than ITIC molecule. Among them, the solubility of A3, A4 and A5 containing N heterocycles is higher than that of the same type molecule without N, indicating that the introduction of N element can evidently increase the solubility.

Transport properties
The transport capacity is the most important property for acceptors in organic solar cells. The values of reorganization energy, centroid-to-centroid distance d, the electron transfer integral V (eV), and average electron mobility μe (cm2 V−1 s−1) for all the investigated molecules are presented in Table 1. The predicted structures of the studied acceptors are given in the ESI (Fig. S1†). The computed μe of ITIC molecule is 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 3.7 ± 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.25 The average electron mobility values are 5.7 × 10−2, 5.3 × 10−2, 1.6 × 10−1, 1.1 × 10, 5.3 × 10, 3.9, and 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ITIC′, A1–A5, and A5_h, respectively (Table 1), where the mobility of all the newly designed acceptors is higher than that of ITIC molecule. From Table 1, the mobility of A5 is nearly 104 times higher than that of ITIC molecule. This suggested that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs using A3, A4, or A5 molecule as acceptor will be greatly increased. Because electron mobility is closely related to the Jsc and FF of OSCs. In order to further understand the reasons for the difference in electron mobility, we further analyzed the parameters relevant with the electron mobility. The reorganization energy (λ) values were estimated by the adiabatic energy surface approach at the B3LYP/6-311G (d,p) level. The λ values of ITIC, ITIC′, A1, and A2, are close to each other and are 0.156, 0.157, 0.182 and 0.176 eV, respectively. One thing worth noting is that the λ values of A3, A4, A5, and A5_h are 0.073, 0.093, 0.092 and 0.091 eV, respectively, which are about 50%–60% of that of ITIC. The results show that the different reorganization energies are one of the main reasons leading to the difference in electron mobility for the studied molecules.

The transfer integral (v) reflects electronic coupling between the neighboring molecules and needs to be maximized in order to improve the electron transport process. The crystal structure offering the relative position of the molecules plays an essential role in electron transport.58 The polymorph module in Materials studio was used in prediction of the crystal structure, which has proven to be an appropriate method.59 The v values of each selected path for the studied molecules are listed in Table 1. We can see that the v values of ITIC in all paths are about 10−4 eV, while the v values of ITIC′ are one order of magnitude larger than that of ITIC, which is the main reason for that the μe of ITIC′ is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of ITIC. In the designed molecules A2, A4, A5 and A5_h, there are several electron transfer paths with v values more than 10−2 eV, thus leading to much larger μe of 0.16–53 cm2 V−1 s−1. According to Marcus's rate formula, the electron rate is positively related to the square of the transfer integral, which is the dominating factor for the electron mobility.
D/A interface property
The D/A interface properties play key roles in the separation of electron and hole in OSCs, which significantly affects the PCE of the devices. Therefore, we constructed the interfaces of PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h and compared their related properties. For D/A interfaces, the binding energy (Eb) is an important parameter to evaluate the interfacial binding strength between the donor and the acceptor. The higher the absolute value of Eb, the stronger the binding interaction between D and A. In our work, the Eb was calculated according to the following formula:Eb = ED/A − ED − EA + EBSSEwhere ED/A, ED, EA and EBSSE denotes the energy of the combined D/A system, the donor, the acceptor and the basis set superposition error (BSSE), respectively. The calculated Eb values of PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h are −2.52 eV and −3.75 eV, indicating that the interactions between the donor and the acceptor for the latter are about 50% stronger than that of the former.
In order to further understand the information at the interface, we analysed the noncovalent interactions between D and A through the independent density gradient model (IGM) by using the Multiwfn software,60,61 and displayed the obtained results in Fig. 5. More details about the IGM analysis are given in the ESI (section S2).† Overall, there exist evident intermolecular attractions (sign(λ2)ρ < 0 a.u.) and repulsion effects (sign(λ2)ρ > 0 a.u.) for both PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h systems. The insets (3D isosurface at δginter = 0.01 a.u.) of Fig. 5 illustrate more details about the D–A configurations and interaction populations of the two studied interfaces. In PBDB-TF/ITIC system, the weak interactions are mainly distributed along the side chain of D and A because of the x-cross stacking mode between PBDB-TF and ITIC. Meanwhile, in PBDB-TF/A5_h, the interactions are widely distributed and mainly on the molecular skeletons due to the face-on parallel stacking configuration of PBDB-TF and A5_h. The above results not only agree well with the order of the binding energies, but also provide inherent hints on the different interaction strengths of the two investigated D/A interfaces.

To further clarify the charge transfer mechanisms at the D/A interfaces, the vertical excitations of the 40 lowest excited singlet states of PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h were computed at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G (d) level. The calculated excitation energies, oscillator strengths, transferred charges, and CDD diagrams are shown in Fig. 6, 7 and Fig. S2, S3,† respectively. Excited states in OSCs can be divided into Frenkel exciton (FE) states and charge transfer (CT) states. A FE state refers to an electron excitation localized on the donor (FED state) or the acceptor (FEA state), while a CT state is characterized by the fact that the two singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) separately locate on the donor and the acceptor. CT states may come from the following three ways.62 The first way is the direct excitation process, that is, an electron of the donor is directly excited to the acceptor or a hole of the acceptor is transferred to the donor, thus generating a CT state.63 The probability of producing CT states in the direct excitation way is positively related to the oscillator strengths of the CT states. The second approach is called the intermolecular electric field (IEF) mechanism, which means that when the energy of a FE state is lower than that of a CT state, the low-energy FE state can be converted to the CT state under the effect of the intermolecular electric field formed by the different electrostatic potentials of the donor and the acceptor surfaces.64,65 The third way is the hot exciton mechanism, which means that when the energy of a FE state is higher than that of a CT state, the FE state can be transformed into the CT state.66–68 In some cases, there are hybrid CT states mixing FE states and CT states, which are marked as FE-CT states in this work.

 Fig. 7  Excitation energies, corresponding oscillator strengths, CDD maps and the amount of charge transferring from donor to acceptor of the lowest eight excited states for the PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h interface. 
As shown in Fig. 6, in the PBDB-TF/ITIC system, there are seven pure CT states among the lowest 40 excited states, accounting for a proportion of 17.5%, while the proportion (nine pure CT states out of 40 excited states) increases to 22.5% in PBDB-TF/A5_h. As the premise of charge separation, more CT states in PBDB-TF/A5_h imply more facile charge separation. In terms of oscillator strength (f), the f value (0.983) of the CT1 state in PBDB-TF/ITIC is much larger than that (0.022) of the CT1 state in PBDB-TF/A5_h. Additionally, the f values of other CT states in PBDB-TF/ITIC vary between 0.002 and 0.058. Meanwhile, the f values of the nine CT states in PBDB-TF/A5_h are in the range of 0.010 and 0.174, where three f values are over 0.12. The above results show that it is possible to generate CT states by direct excitation in both PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h systems.

Fig. 7 displays more details about the vertical excitations of the lowest eight excited states (S1–S8 states) of the PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h systems. According to Kasha's rule,69 the S1 state is essentially important in photochemical and photophysical processes. In Fig. 7, we can see both S1 states of the two studied systems are FEA states localized on the acceptor ITIC or A5_h with an excitation energy of 2.18 eV/569 nm or 2.14 eV/579 nm and an oscillator strength of 1.810 and 2.585, respectively. Clearly, the S1 states of the two systems are bright states and their absorption peak correspond to yellow green in visible light range. The S2 state is the lowest charge transfer (CT1) state in both systems, where the CT1 state of PBDB-TF/ITIC has higher excitation energy (2.40 eV/517 nm), larger oscillator strength (0.983), and more transferred charge (0.740 e). It is worth noting that the energy difference ΔE(S2 − S1) between the S2 state (CT1) and the S1 state (FEA) in PBDB-TF/A5_h is 0.145 eV, which is significantly smaller than that of 0.221 eV in PBDB-TF/ITIC. From the viewpoint of energy, the smaller ΔE(S2 − S1) value in PBDB-TF/A5_h implies less energy difference (resistance) to overcome for the transition of FE state to CT state through IEF process.
Besides the energy difference, the IEF mechanism needs to consider the driving force,70 that is, the discrepancy of the surface electrostatic potentials between the donor and the acceptor.64,65 As shown in Fig. 8, the surface mean electrostatic potential of the donor PBDB-TF is 6 meV, while those (18 meV and 17 meV) of the two acceptors ITIC and A5_h are much larger but almost equal. Comparing the distributions of electrostatic potentials between ITIC and A5_h, we can see the values of the side chains and the skeleton terminals are more positive, while the potentials at the regions around the N atoms in cyano and phenazine groups are much more negative for A5_h than those of the corresponding part in ITIC. On the whole, the surface electrostatic potentials of A5_h fluctuate much violently than those of ITIC. This can be ascribed to two facts in A5_h: (1) the phenanthrene [4,5-abc] phenazine prolongs the conjugation length of the skeleton, and (2) the electron-withdrawing N atoms of phenazine enhance the push–pull feature of the whole molecule. Therefore, compared with ITIC, A5_h possesses stronger push–pull electron effect, which is more helpful for the charge transfer via the IEF mechanism.
 Fig. 8  ESP mapped onto a surface of total electrons for the PBDB-TF, ITIC and A5_h molecules. 
In addition, the excitation energies (335 nm–580 nm) of the lowest 40 excited states lie in the range of UV/Vis light, where the majority FE states and the CT states are staggered to each other. Therefore, it is possible to achieve the CT states via the hot exciton mechanism. This is consistent with previous quantum chemical calculation results on the PBDB-TF/ITIC system.71
In short, our calculations show that both PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h can generate CT states by means of direct excitation and hot exciton. For PBDB-TF/A5_h, there exist more opportunities of producing CT states through IEF mechanism.
Conclusions
The conclusions section should come in this section at the end of the article, before the acknowledgements. In this work, we have designed a series of acceptors (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A5_h) for OSCs by introducing aromatic fused-ring units involving phenanthrene, pyrene, benzopyrazine, dibenzo[a,c]phenazine, phenanthro[4,5-abc]phenazine to the ends of the famous non-fullerene acceptor ITIC. The geometric and electronic structures, optical properties, solubility, electron transport capacity, and interface (with the donor PBDB-TF) properties of ITIC and the designed acceptors were compared based on DFT calculations and Marcus theory. The newly designed acceptors exhibit appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels, larger solubility, and much higher electron mobility compared with ITIC. Especially, the average electron mobility of A5_h is about 104 times higher than that of ITIC. Moreover, the computed binding energies show that the donor–acceptor interactions of the PBDB-TF/A5_h interface with the face-on parallel configuration are much stronger than those of PBDB-TF/ITIC with the x-cross stacking mode of the donor and the acceptor. Furthermore, multiple charge transfer mechanisms including direct excitation of CT states, hot exciton, and IEF mechanisms were found possible for both PBDB-TF/ITIC and PBDB-TF/A5_h interfaces, where the IEF mechanism is remarkably prevailing for PBDB-TF/A5_h. Besides proposing several promising non-fullerene acceptors, our results provide new insights into the D/A interface properties, which are expected to be informative for future design of donor and acceptors for efficient OSCs.
