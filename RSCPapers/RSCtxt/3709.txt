Experiment and theory(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Michael N. R. Ashfold, Clive L. Bennett and Richard N. DixonAbstractThe spectroscopy and predissociation of the vibronic levels of the Ã1A″2 excited states of NH3 and ND3 have been studied via Ã-X dispersed emission spectra, C′-Ã dispersed emission spectra and C′-Ã stimulated emission pumping, in each case following two-photon excitation to a selected intermediate level. The predissociation lifetimes span more than two orders of magnitude. The lowest levels predissociate by H(D) atom quantum tunnelling, the higher levels by vibrational rearrangement. A model calculation is presented to illustrate this mechanism for the v1= 1 levels of the Ã state, which are very short-lived.
