    , Accepted 22nd April 2021First published on 24th April 2021AbstractThe single-phase binary nickel vanadate Ni2V2O7 was successfully synthesized by a simple solid-state method to explore novel anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. After an activation process, the Ni2V2O7 electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a stable, high specific capacity of about 960 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, which is attributed to the multiple valence states and the synergistic effect of the transition elements V and Ni. Even at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1, a stable specific capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 was still obtained. Considering the influence of the activation process on the electrochemical performance of the Ni2V2O7 electrode, we studied the origin of the excellent electrochemical performance, where the improved lithium diffusion coefficient and increased pseudocapacitive contribution caused by the activation process led to a significant improvement in the electrochemical performance, including rate capacity and cycle stability. By combining in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) methods, for the first time, we illustrate the detailed lithium storage mechanism of the Ni2V2O7 electrode during the lithium insertion/extraction process.
1. Introduction
The increasingly serious global energy crisis and environmental pollution caused by the widespread use of fossil fuels have stimulated the development of sustainable and clean energy such as wind, solar, and tidal energy.1 However, the intermittent nature of these renewable sources disturbs their direct practical application, and there is an urgent need for renewable energy storage systems. Among most energy storage systems, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density, excellent efficiency and environmental friendliness are considered as one of the promising energy storage devices that have been extensively used in electrical devices.2,3 The excellent performance of lithium-ion batteries is mainly determined by the electrode materials. As one of the key components, anode materials play an important role in electrode performance. Due to the limited discharge specific capacity (∼372 mA h g−1) and the relatively poor safety caused by the low potential (only about 0.2 V vs. Li+/Li), it has become increasingly difficult for the dominant commercial anode material, graphite, to meet growing demands in terms of high energy density, good safety, etc.,4 and exploring novel high-performance anode materials has become a challenge.5
Transition metal oxides are regarded as among the most promising electrode materials for LIBs due to their high theoretical specific capacity, long cycle life and wide usefulness.6–8 However, transition metal oxide anodes suffer from some crucial issues such as large volume expansion, poor electronic conductivity and terrible cyclability, which hinder their widespread commercialization.9 Recently, binary transition metal oxides (BTMOs) have received significant attention as anode materials. Due to the coexistence of two distinct transition metal elements in a single-crystal structure, as anode materials, BTMOs usually present an exceptionally high specific capacity of 2–3 times that of the traditional commercial graphite anode material.10 Also, due to the synergistic effect and the relatively low activation energy for electron transfer between cations, the BTMOs usually exhibit higher electrical conductivity and better cycle stability than simple TMOs.11,12
Among the BTMOs, V-based binary transition metal oxides have been widely reported as promising anode materials because of their excellent electrochemical performance and abundant reserves. Vanadium belongs to the transition metal elements of the 3d sub-family with the valence electron configuration of 3d34s2. The existence of five valence electrons allows vanadium to have multiple valence states (+5, +4, +3, and +2), which have different properties that cause V-based binary transition metal oxides to demonstrate interesting electrochemical performances in the fields of energy storage and power sources. There have been many studies on the V-based binary transition metal oxides, such as Co3V2O8, MnV2O6, Cu3V2O8, Cu2V2O7 and Zn2V2O7, which have been reported to be used to develop novel anode materials with a high specific capacity to replace the conventional graphite anodes.12–16 However, some key issues such as inferior cycling stability and the relatively poor rate performance still need to be resolved. At present, the excellent electrochemical properties of V-based binary transition metal oxides still cannot be fully utilized to meet the needs of the high energy density LIBs.
Considering the high electrochemical activity of nickel and the synergistic effects of nickel and vanadium,17,18 the binary nickel vanadate Ni2V2O7 is expected to be a new high-performance anode material for LIBs. Until now, there has been no report on the electrochemical properties of Ni2V2O7 as the electrode material for LIBs. Herein, using a sol–gel method combined with the calcination process, we have successfully synthesized the single-phase Ni2V2O7 sample. The high charge/discharge specific capacity and the excellent cycle stability and rate performance indicate that Ni2V2O7 is a promising candidate anode material for high energy density LIBs. After the activation process, a stable high specific capacity of about 960 mA h g−1 was observed at the current density of 100 mA g−1. Even at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1, a stable specific capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 was still obtained, which is much higher than the theoretical capacity of the commercial graphite anode (372 mA h g−1). On combining the in situ XRD and ex situ XPS methods, for the first time, we illustrate the detailed lithium storage mechanism of the Ni2V2O7 electrode during the lithium insertion/extraction process.
2. Experimental
2.1 synthesis of Ni2V2O7
To synthesize pure Ni2V2O7, analytical grade NH4VO3 (0.01 mol) and Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.01 mol) were dissolved in 80 mL deionized water, in turn. After continuous magnetic stirring at 60 °C, a dry sol–gel was obtained and then placed in an oven of 80 °C to remove the remaining water. The precursor was ground and put into a tube furnace. After the annealing process at 700 °C for 10 h in a high purity argon atmosphere, the pure Ni2V2O7 was obtained.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were conducted to check the phase purity using a Bruker-D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation. Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern of the single-phase Ni2V2O7 sample was performed by the GSAS program via the EXPGUI interface.19,20
The surface morphology of Ni2V2O7 electrodes was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (Gemini SEM 500) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JSM 5610), and the chemical binding state of the electrodes was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS ESCALAB210) with Al Kα radiation. The electrochemical properties of Ni2V2O7 as anode materials were evaluated with a two-electrode CR2032 cell. The anode electrode was prepared by mixing the Ni2V2O7 powder, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a mass ratio (8:1:1) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The mixture was coated on Cu foil and the mass loading of the active materials was approximately 1.3 mg cm−2. The cells were assembled in a high-purity argon glove box. The lithium metal foils were regarded as counter electrodes, Celgard@2320 was used as the separator, and 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC (1:1 vol%) was used as the electrolyte.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on an electrochemical workstation (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N, Metrohm, Netherlands) applying an alternating current (AC) voltage of 5 mV and the frequency range of 0.1–100 MHz. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were conducted with a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V.
3. Results and discussion
The phase purity of the Ni2V2O7 sample was investigated using the XRD technique, and the XRD patterns of Ni2V2O7 powder were in good agreement with standard XRD patterns (ICSD #2358) as shown in Fig. 1a. The Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern of the Ni2V2O7 sample was carried out using the GSAS program and a space group of P121/C1 was selected as the refinement model. The relatively small Rwp factor (about 9.71%) revealed that the single-phase Ni2V2O7 was successfully synthesized without any impurity phase (see Fig. 1b). Correspondingly, the cell parameters are a = 6.5170(2), b = 8.2938(3), c = 9.3593(2) Å and α = 90, β = 99.8964(4), γ = 90°, and the atomic sites and coordinates of Ni2V2O7 from Rietveld refinement results are exhibited in Table 1. To further confirm the valence states of the elements in the sample, the XPS spectra of Ni 2p and V 2p of the Ni2V2O7 powder are shown in Fig. 1c and d. The peaks located at 873.45 eV and 855.81 eV were ascribed to Ni2+ 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, and the other two peaks at 879.93 eV and 861.90 eV in Fig. 1c were fitted to the satellite line; two peaks at 524.35 eV and 516.93 eV of V5+ 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 are exhibited in Fig. 1d, in agreement with the element valence of Ni2V2O7.21–24

The fundamental electrochemical properties of Ni2V2O7 as the electrode material for LIBs were evaluated using coin cells. Fig. 2a displays the galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of the Ni2V2O7 in the first three cycles at a current density of 700 mA g−1 in the potential range of 0.1–3.0 V. For the electrode material, an obvious difference was observed in the discharge capacity and voltage profile for the first discharge cycle. The significantly higher discharge specific capacity (about 1110 mA h g−1) can be mainly ascribed to the irreversible phase transformation of the electrode material and the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film.15,16 The obvious difference in the voltage profile implied that different reaction mechanisms occurred for the electrode material between the first discharge process and the subsequent cycles, which was confirmed by our in situ XRD measurement and ex situ XPS results. Except for the first discharge cycle, the charge/discharge curves presented a similar profile, indicating that the electrode material has good reversibility in subsequent cycles. The galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of Ni2V2O7 in the first three cycles at a low current density of 100 mA g−1 are provided in Fig. S1.†

The cycling performance of the Ni2V2O7 electrode material at a relatively high current density of 700 mA g−1 is shown in Fig. 2b. Like most binary TMOs, as the anode material, Ni2V2O7 presents an obvious activation process.25,26 First, the specific capacity of the electrode material experienced a sharp decline, then gradually increased, and finally recovered to a stable value. The initial sustained capacity decay can be mainly attributed to the structural reorganization such as the formation of amorphous LixV2O5, which reduced the conductivity of the electrode material. However, due to the increase in the active sites for Li+ insertion caused by the pulverization of the amorphous bulk, named an activation process,25 as the cycle continued, the specific capacity of the electrode material gradually began to recover. After 170 cycles, a stable specific capacity of about 695 mA h g−1 was obtained. Fig. 2c exhibits the galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of the Ni2V2O7 electrode after 170 cycles at 700 mA g−1, and the maintenance of the similar voltage profiles of the discharge and charge curves indicated that the electrode material has the same lithium storage mechanism after the first discharge cycle, and after 170 cycles the electrode material still exhibited excellent structural stability. The good structural stability was further confirmed by the CV measure results. For the CV curves of the Ni2V2O7 electrode material, the first cathodic sweep (Fig. 2d) presented completely different electrochemical behaviors, where the obvious sloping voltage region (0.75–0.01 V) can be attributed to the formation of the SEI layer and the process of lithium-ion insertion into Ni2V2O7.27 After the first cathodic sweep, the electrode material presented an obvious reversible behavior. There were two oxidation peaks (1.20 V and 2.45 V) in the anodic sweep; the former may result from the process of lithium ions breaking away from LixV2O5, and the other corresponds to the oxidation of Ni.27,28 The variation of peaks is in agreement with the discharge/charge curves as shown in Fig. 2a. The CV curves of the Ni2V2O7 electrode material after 170 cycles are exhibited in Fig. 2e, where the same redox peaks further indicated that the electrochemical reaction process was reversible and stable during cycling. To investigate the rate performance of the electrode material, after a long activation process, various current densities (100, 200, 500, 700, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1) were applied to the work electrodes as shown in Fig. 2f. Due to the smaller particle size caused by the long activation process, which was confirmed by the subsequent SEM results, the electrode material presented excellent rate performance. At a smaller current density of 100 mA g−1, a stable high specific capacity of about 960 mA h g−1 was observed. Although a sustained capacity decrease was observed with increasing current density, a stable specific capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 was still obtained at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1, which is much higher than the theoretical capacity of the commercial graphite anode (372 mA h g−1). The rate capability of the fresh Ni2V2O7 electrode is exhibited in Fig. S2.† More importantly, when the current density returned to 100 mA g−1, the specific capacity could still recover to the initial capacity value. The excellent capacity recovery and stability indicated that after the activation process, the electrode materials presented excellent rate capability and structural stability. Compared with other mixed-metal vanadates (see Table 2),17,29–34 as electrode materials for LIBs, after the activation process, the Ni2V2O7 presented a satisfactory electrochemical performance. For example, although Zn3V2O8 exhibited a high specific capacity of 1278 mA h g−1, after 40 cycles, the capacity decayed to 268 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1.31 Moreover, the capacity retentions of Mn2V2O732 and Cu11V6O26/V2O533 were only 389.4 mA h g−1 and 522.6 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, respectively. In terms of rate capability, the Ni2V2O7 showed a satisfactory result of 965.2 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and that of Co3V2O8 was 600 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1.34

To understand the influence of the activation process on the electrochemical performance of electrode materials, the EIS test was carried out for the fresh electrode and the electrode after 170 cycles at room temperature. The Nyquist plots were recorded from 0.01 Hz to 100 Hz and the equivalent circuit model 1 and model 2 correspond to the fresh electrode and the Ni2V2O7 electrode after a long activation process in Fig. 3a. Re represents the solution resistance and Rct stands for the charge transfer resistance in this equivalent circuit model. The Rct value of the fresh electrode is 144.3 and it was reduced to 14.3 for the Ni2V2O7 electrode after 170 cycles, which improved the electrochemical performance of the Ni2V2O7 electrode. W and CPE1 stand for the Warburg impedance and double layer capacitance, respectively. Due to the formation of the SEI layer, Rs corresponds to the SEI layer resistance and CPE2 represents the capacitance of the surface layer in model 2. The linear fitting of the Z′ vs. ω−1/2 relationship in the low-frequency region is given in Fig. 3b, where the slope of the fitting line is related to the interface dynamic behavior. The lithium-ion diffusion coefficient can be determined from the following formula:35  where T stands for the test temperature, R represents the gas constant, n is the number of transferring electrons per molecule, F represents the Faraday constant, A is the electrode material surface area, C is the lithium-ion concentration of the electrode material, and σ is the slope of the fitted line in Fig. 3b. The corresponding lithium diffusion coefficient of the fresh Ni2V2O7 electrode is 3.606 × 10−16 cm2 s−1; however, that of the electrode after 170 cycles is 1.115 × 10−14 cm2 s−1. The improved lithium diffusion coefficient may be attributed to the reduced particle size caused by the activation process, which can be observed from the SEM and TEM measurement results.

Fig. 4 presents the morphology evolution of the electrode material at different cycles. For the Ni2V2O7 powder, the sample presents an approximate disc shape with a size of about 1–2 μm as shown in Fig. 4a. After the first discharge cycle, although the electrode material still presented a schistose morphology, attributed to the structural reorganization caused by the irreversible phase transformation, an amorphous phase corresponding to the formation of LixV2O5 was observed from the XRD results in the inset of the figure in Fig. 4b. Four weak diffraction rings were observed from the SAED pattern of the electrode material after the first discharge process, whose inter-planar distances measured by the diffraction rings were about 0.237, 0.205, 0.160 and 0.1316 nm, corresponding to the (010), (011), (012) and (110) reflections of Ni (ICSD #76668) as shown in the inset of Fig. 4b, which indicate the existence of the nickel when it discharged to 0.01 V in the first cycle.36 Due to the existence of the amorphous Lix+yV2O5 and other additives (such as acetylene black and PVDF) in the electrode, only a rough outline of the diffraction rings of Ni was observed in the SAED pattern and there were no obvious diffraction peaks in the corresponding XRD pattern in the inset, which is in agreement with the report of Baba Ali and coworkers.37 As the cycles continued, the particles of the electrode material gradually reunited to form a huge plate in Fig. 4c at 50 cycles and the corresponding XRD patterns in the inset of the figure indicated that the huge plate was the amorphous phase. After 170 cycles, a uniform particle distribution, with the size of about 50 nm as shown in Fig. 4d indicated that the amorphous plate electrode material was gradually pulverized into small particles, consistent with our cycle measurement results (see Fig. 2b), where, after 50 cycles, a gradually increasing specific capacity was observed. After the activation process, a significant reduction in the particle size shortened the diffusion length of Li-ions, thus improving the lithium diffusion coefficient of the electrode material.

The CV measurements with different scan rates were applied to further understand the electrochemical kinetics of the electrode material at different cycles, where the sweep rate changed from 0.1 mV s−1 to 1 mV s−1 (Fig. 5a and c). The kinetic information was obtained from the formula relating the peak current (i) and the sweep rate (v), i = avb, where a and b are adjustable parameters. The value of b indicates what is dominant in electrode kinetics; either the diffusion-controlled process (where b is close to 0.5) or the surface-controlled process (where b is close to 1).38 For the fresh electrode, the b values of the cathodic and anodic peaks were 0.58 and 0.61, and were 0.75 and 0.76 for the Ni2V2O7 electrode after 170 cycles (Fig. 5b and d). The increase in the b values showed that the effect of surface control was more obvious after a long activation process. The pseudocapacitance can be calculated by the following equation: i = k1v + k2v1/2(1)where k1 and k2 are variable parameters, and k1v and k2v1/2 stand for the surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled parts, respectively.39,40 According to Fig. 5e and f, the pseudocapacitive contribution is 15.15% for the fresh electrode, but 45.98% for the Ni2V2O7 electrode after 170 cycles at the same sweep rate of 1 mV s−1. For the electrode material after a long activation process, although the diffusion-controlled Li storage plays a dominant role in terms of electrode kinetics, attributed to the increase of the active site of the electrode material caused by the significant reduction in the particle size, a significant increased pseudocapacitive contribution was observed. The increased pseudocapacitive contribution and improved lithium diffusion coefficient significantly improved the reaction kinetics of the electrode material. As a novel anode material for LIBs, the Ni2V2O7 electrode material exhibited a high specific capacity and excellent rate stability after the activation process.

To understand the lithium insertion/extraction mechanism of the Ni2V2O7 electrode material during the charge/discharge process, in situ XRD tests were carried out to reveal the association between the electrochemical behavior and the crystallographic structure evolution (Fig. 6). A set of new high-intensity colors were observed in some specific peak sites in the XRD color map of Fig. 6a, corresponding to the peaks of LiV2O5 and NiO, which was further confirmed by the corresponding XRD pattern evolution. From the XRD pattern evolution of the electrode material, we can see that as the discharge process continued, the initial diffraction peaks of Ni2V2O7 marked with the red dotted line gradually disappeared, and some new diffraction peaks (at 16.8°, 21.2°, 37.2°, 43.0°, and 62.8°) appeared and gradually reached a strong intensity. The peaks at 16.8° and 21.2° were indexed as the (002) and (201) diffraction peaks of LiV2O5 (ICSD #27245), and the peaks located at 37.2°, 43.0° and 62.8° were matched with the (003), (012) and (104) reflections of NiO (ICSD #9866). A shift of the (002) and (201) peaks toward a lower angle was observed with increasing inserted Li, which was considered to form the solid solution of the transitional phase LiV2O5, where the final phase was named LixV2O5. The evolution of XRD patterns corresponds to the Ni2V2O7 being first transformed into NiO and LixV2O5 when discharging to about 0.6 V in the first discharge process. However, these new peaks faded away completely when discharged to 0.01 V, indicating that the electrode material was completely converted into the amorphous phases, in agreement with the TEM result in Fig. 4b. Correspondingly, these phases can be attributed to the formation of Ni and amorphous Lix+yV2O5, which was confirmed by our ex situ XPS measurements.

(b) Magnification of select regions of the in situ XRD color map and (c) the corresponding intensity contrast of the XRD patterns in the next charge and discharge process. 
To further confirm the reversible reaction mechanism of the electrode material in the subsequent cycles, magnification of select regions of the in situ XRD color map during the first charge and the second discharge/charge process is shown in Fig. 6b, where an interesting phenomenon is observed. Two new high-intensity colors at peak sites of 44.0° and 63.8° were generated during the first charge process, then vanished in the second discharge process, and finally appeared in the second charge process. The periodic evolution phenomenon indicated that a reversible phase transition occurred during the cycles. To further identify the phase transition process, the magnified intensity comparison of diffraction peaks on the corresponding two selected regions of the XRD patterns is exhibited in Fig. 6c. The diffraction peak located at around 44.0° and 63.8° in the fully charged state marked with a red line (3 V) displayed a higher intensity than in the fully discharged state marked with a black line (0.01 V) during cycling, which indicates that the new compound was formed at 3 V and decomposed at 0.01 V. Based on the sites and intensity change of the peaks, the new diffraction peaks at 44.0° and 63.8° can be indexed as the (104) and (110) reflections of Li0.28Ni0.72O.
Because it is difficult to confirm the phase of the amorphous material by X-ray diffraction, XPS spectra of the electrode material at different discharge/charge stages were obtained to further determine the reversible reflection mechanism. To alleviate the effect of the SEI film, we conducted a series of processing operations on the samples scraped from the Ni2V2O7 electrode at different cycle stages, such as soaking in organic solvents. Fig. 7a–d present the XPS spectra of Ni 2p and V 2p of the Ni2V2O7 electrode discharging to 0.01 V in the first and 170th cycle. In Fig. 7a and c, the peaks at 852.7 eV and 871.5 eV are related to Ni0 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, and the other two couples of peaks (855.80 eV and 873.50 eV, 860.2 eV and 878.8 eV) are related to Ni2+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 and Ni 2p satellite peaks.21,22 The peaks of Ni0 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 observed at 0.01 V indicated that the NiO transformed into Ni at a fully discharged state. However, it is necessary to point out that the existence of Ni2+ in the fully discharged state may be caused by surface oxidation and the unused active materials remaining during the amorphous process. Fig. 7b and d show two couples of peaks (514.88 eV and 521.96 eV, 515.92 eV and 523.11 eV), attributed to V2+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 and V3+2p3/2 and 2p1/2,23,24 which correspond to lithium ions inserting into LixV2O5 to form a reversible Lix+yV2O5 amorphous phase during the process of discharging to 0.01 V. In the fully charged state, Fig. 7e and g exhibits a pair of Ni peaks corresponding to the coupling of Ni2+ and Ni3+.27 The coupling of Ni2+/Ni3+ is in agreement with the formation of Li0.28Ni0.72O charging to 3 V in the first and 170th cycle. Correspondingly, in Fig. 7f and h, the V4+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks were observed at 516.50 eV and 523.62 eV, respectively.24 The coexistence of V4+ and V5+ in the fully charged state corresponds to the delithiation of Lix+yV2O5. The XPS spectra of Ni 2p and V 2p of the Ni2V2O7 electrode at the same voltage (0.01 V or 3 V) between the first and the 170th cycle are similar, which indicates that the electrode material presents the same reaction mechanism during cycling.

Based on the in situ XRD experimental results and the XPS spectra of the Ni2V2O7 electrode material at different cycle states, a detailed charge and discharge mechanism was obtained for the electrode material. During the first discharge process, the Ni2V2O7 was first transformed into the transitional phases of NiO and LixV2O5, discharging to about 0.6 V, and then the transitional phases were completely converted into Ni and amorphous Lix+yV2O5 with further discharge to 0.01 V. In subsequent charge and discharge cycles, the reverse phase conversion was observed, in which Ni and amorphous Lix+yV2O5 transformed into Li0.28Ni0.72O and LixV2O5, respectively, which is often reported in similar V-based materials.41 The corresponding electrochemical reaction can be described as follows:
The first discharge Ni2V2O7 + xLi+ + xe− → 2NiO + LixV2O5(1) NiO + 2e− + 2Li+ → Ni + Li2O(2) LixV2O5 + yLi+ + ye− → Lix+yV2O5(3)
The subsequent charge/discharge cycles Lix+yV2O5 ↔ LixV2O5 + yLi+ + ye−(4) 0.72Ni + Li2O ↔ Li0.28Ni0.72O + 1.72Li+ + 1.72e−(5)
4. Conclusions
Ni2V2O7 was synthesized by a facile solid-state method. X-ray diffraction patterns and the corresponding Rietveld refinement results showed that the single-phase Ni2V2O7 was obtained. As an anode material, although the Ni2V2O7 electrode delivers an initial reversible capacity of 695 mA h g−1 at 700 mA g−1, after an activation process, excellent electrochemical performance can be observed, where a stable high specific capacity of about 965 mA h g−1 was obtained at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Even at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1, a stable specific capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 was still observed. Using SEM, TEM, EIS, and rate CV analytical techniques, we revealed the entire activation process of the electrode. The Ni2V2O7 electrode was first transformed into the amorphous phase and was then pulverized into small uniform particles with the size of about 50 nm. For the electrode material, after an activation process, the significant reduction in the particle size shortened the diffusion length of the Li ions, and thus an improved lithium diffusion coefficient was obtained. Also, due to the increase of the active site of the electrode material caused by the significant reduction in the particle size, a significantly increased pseudocapacitive contribution was observed. The improved lithium diffusion coefficient and increased pseudocapacitive contribution significantly improved the reaction kinetics of the electrode material. As a novel anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the Ni2V2O7 electrode material exhibited a high specific capacity and excellent rate stability after the activation process. Based on the in situ XRD and ex situ XPS results, the reaction mechanism during cycling was analyzed in detail for the first time. The Ni2V2O7 electrode material exhibited a complicated charge/discharge reaction mechanism. In the first discharge process, the Ni2V2O7 electrode material was converted into transition phases of NiO and LixV2O5, and ultimately transformed into Ni and amorphous Lix+yV2O5, respectively. In the subsequent charge and discharge process, the reversible multi-electron conversion reaction of Ni and amorphous Lix+yV2O5 works.
