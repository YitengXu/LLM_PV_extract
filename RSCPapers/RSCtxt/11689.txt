The extended π-conjugation of PDI2 ensures a high electron conductivity for efficient charge transport, and the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups can chelate with uncoordinated Pb2+ to passivate the surface defects of perovskite crystals. It thereby suppresses interfacial recombination, enhances efficiency, and reduces hysteresis and the light-soaking instability. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of our perovskite solar cells showed negligible dependence on the thickness of the PDI2 interlayer, and the champion device achieved a high PCE of 19.84% and the hysteresis value (ΔPCE) was reduced to 2.34% compared to 6.46% in the perovskite device without the presence of the PDI2 interlayer.
Introduction
Organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have drawn extensive attention for their superior optoelectronic properties such as a tunable band gap, strong light absorption, long carrier diffusion length and ambipolar charge transport ability. They have enabled rapid and encouraging progress in perovskite photovoltaics with the highest PCE boosting from 3.8% in 2009 to 22.7% today.1–7
One unique characteristic of perovskite solar cells is the diversity of their device structures, with both n–i–p and p–i–n type architectures having been demonstrated to operate effectively, although devices with the former structure usually achieve relatively higher efficiencies.7–9 Whilst the charge transport layers are not necessary to fabricate a working perovskite solar cell,10,11 they function as charge selection layers to boost the efficiency.12 The electron transport layer of an n–i–p type perovskite solar cell usually incorporates n-type metal oxides, e.g. TiO2.7 For mesoporous TiO2, the high-temperature sintering process increases energy consumption and also limits its usage for large scale fabrication on plastic substrates.13,14 Meanwhile, the low-temperature processed TiO2 usually displays low electrical conductivity and insufficient charge extraction ability due to the presence of oxygen vacancies as well as low crystallinity.15 This results in the appearance of serious hysteresis between forward and reverse scans, and light-soaking instability where efficiency evolves during continuous light illumination, both of which have been commonly observed in low-temperature-processed n–i–p type perovskite solar cells due to their inferior electrical characteristics.16,17
To address the aforementioned issues, a number of approaches have been introduced to modify the interface or bulk perovskite layer to passivate defects.18,19 Some n-type molecules, for example fullerene derivatives like phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), have been found to be able to passivate surface defects in both TiO2 and perovskite layers to prohibit hysteresis and obtain efficiencies as high as ∼21%.20,21 However, these fullerene derivatives have monotonous tunability of energy levels and poor photochemistry stability in ambient conditions.22,23 Besides, the relatively high price of fullerene heightens the manufacturing cost. There is a pressing need to develop low-cost and stable n-type interfacial modification materials in order to realize high-performance perovskite solar cells. Macromolecules, for instance polyethylenimine (PEI), polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE), poly[9,9-bis(60-(N,N-diethylamino)propyl)-fluorene-alt-9,9-bis-(3-ethyl (oxetane-3-ethyloxy)-hexyl)-fluorene] (PFN-OX) have already been demonstrated to be able to suppress the charge injection barrier at the interface and enhance charge transport efficiency to obtain high efficiency devices.17,24–27 However, the thickness of these polymers locating at the interface are usually restricted to less than 5 nm, otherwise their inferior charge mobility will raise the interface barrier and resistance significantly to deteriorate device performance.
Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives are n-type semiconductors that can be straightforwardly synthesized and purified, exhibiting good stability and high mobility and conductivity as a result of rigid and extended π–π stacking in their molecular structure. In previous reports, Jen et al. synthesized an n-type perylene diimide derivative that has a discotic coronene diimide (CDI) core with an expanded π-conjugated plane along the short axis. This can increase the charge mobility of ETLs and affect the grain size of the perovskite, ultimately increasing perovskite efficiency from 12.0% to 17.1% with a week hysteresis of 0.2%.28 Brabec et al. reported another perylene diimide derivative PDINO as the interfacial layer between PCBM and Ag for p–i–n type perovskite solar cells, and increased the PCE from 10% to 14% with a hysteresis value of 0.62%.29,30 Wang et al. introduced an amino-substituted perylene diimide derivative (namely N-PDI) to replace TiO2 for effective electron selection, further enhancing device PCE from 12.89 to around 17.66% with a small hysteresis of 1.81%.31 However, there are no reports on whether these PDI derivatives can eliminate the light-soaking issues afflicting perovskite solar cells, which have been commonly observed in n–i–p type perovskite solar cells and represent a significant instability during the early stages of the lifetime operation of these devices.
Herein, we introduce an n-type π-conjugated small molecule, namely helical perylene diimide (PDI2), as an interfacial layer for the preparation of n–i–p type perovskite solar cells. The extended π-conjugation ensures high electron conductivity at the interface, leading to perovskite solar cells with negligible thickness dependence on the PDI2 interlayer. The oxygen atoms of carbonyl groups at the edge of PDI2 molecules can chelate with the non-coordinated Pb2+ of perovskite crystals to passivate surface defects. This PDI2 interfacial layer consequently enhances device efficiency, reduces hysteresis and restrains the light-soaking instability. After optimization, our champion device with a PDI2 interfacial layer achieved a maximum PCE of 19.84% with a significantly reduced hysteresis value from 6.46% to 2.34%.
Results and discussion
We fabricated planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with the structure of ITO/TiO2/PDI2/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (see Fig. 1a), with devices without the PDI2 interlayer serving as reference. The n-type conjugated small molecule PDI2, with its molecular structure shown in Fig. 1b, fuses two coplanar rigid perylene diimide units in a helical manner, which can prevent the formation of excimers through suppressing the self-aggregation of PDI units.32 The TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized via a low-temperature route and blended with a titanium oxide bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TOPD) additive which acted as the binder to reduce morphological defects between TiO2 nanoparticles. This combination has been demonstrated as an efficient ETL layer to prepare high performance perovskite solar cells.16 Surface scanning probe microscopy (SPM) images suggests that the size of these TiO2 nanoparticles is ca. 20 nm, with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness around 3.0 nm. This roughness was further reduced to 1.0 nm (see Fig. 2b) after casting the PDI2 layer on top, which ensures an intimate contact with the perovskite layer. To evaluate the spreading of perovskite precursor solutions on TiO2 and PDI2 surfaces, we have measured the contact angle of DMF and DMSO (9:1) mixed solvent on these two surfaces. As shown in Fig. S3,† the contact angles are 18 and 47° respectively, which ensure sufficient wetting and spreading of PbI2 solution on TiO2 and PDI2 surfaces (see Fig. S3c and d†), and then form perovskite films after casting the MAI precursor (see Fig. S3e and f†). To examine the potential removal of PDI2 during the casting of the atop PbI2 layer as PDI2 can partly dissolve in DMF, we have measured the absorption intensity reduction of a glass/TiO2/PDI2 film after solvent washing using DMF and DMSO (9:1), and found that the absorption intensity was reduced to half in Fig. S4.† This suggests that the PDI layer can indeed by partly dissolved during the subsequent solution casting process, which might be taken away or migrate into the perovskite layer. Although the actual thickness of PDI2 at the interface should be less than designed, the presence of PDI2 at the interface can be confirmed to introduce interfacial modifications. The grain sizes of the perovskite films cast on TiO2 or PDI2 are similarly ca. 250 nm, as shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 2c and d. The light absorption spectra (see Fig. 2e) and X-ray diffraction patterns (see Fig. 2f) of perovskite films cast on both surfaces all show comparable intensities, indicating negligible variations regarding the crystallinity and PbI2 residues in the bulk of the perovskite photoactive layer. Therefore, any device performance differences can be regarded as a result of interfacial properties between the TiO2 and perovskite layers.

Our perovskite solar cells employing an ITO/TiO2/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag device architecture markedly display the light-soaking phenomenon, similar to a literature report33 on PEDOT:PSS-based perovskite devices. In Fig. 3a and Table S1† we show the J–V curves from both forward and reverse scans of this device, with a time interval of 20 seconds between J–V curves. This means the difference between two adjacent J–V curves is a light illumination period of 20 seconds under 1 sun. From the reverse scans, we can see that after 20 seconds of light-soaking the Voc increased from 1.04 to 1.09 V, the FF increased from 67.77 to 74.46% whilst the Jsc values are rather constant. This corresponds to a PCE improvement from 16.40 to 18.86%. A similar evolution can be observed from the forward scans. After a light-soaking time of 40 seconds, the discrepancies between two adjacent J–V curves are negligible, suggesting that the device is now sufficiently stabilized to give a steady power output. This evolution of device PCE can be better judged by looking at the current density and PCE changes of devices measured at the maximum power point (MPP) voltage (MPP voltage = 0.86 V) presented in Fig. 3b. In Fig. 3b, the current density and PCE continue to increase after light illumination began, and it took about 30 seconds for them to stabilize with a PCE = 15.1% and Jsc = 17.6 mA cm−2. The hysteresis between forward and reverse scans is also notable, with a PCE difference (ΔPCE) over 6.0% observed during the initial scans. After adding a 15 nm PDI2 layer on top of TiO2, this light-soaking instability is significantly reduced (see Fig. 3c and Table S1†) and the ΔPCE between forward and reverse scans is remarkably reduced to only 1.95% during initial scans. The J–V curves upon 40 seconds of light-soaking overlap with those of J–V curves having subjected to a 20 second light-soaking period. This is supported by the current density and PCE evolutions from the MPP measurements in Fig. 3d, where it took less than 10 seconds for the device to stabilize. These initial J–V curves (from either forward and reversed scans) in Fig. 3a are typical S-shaped curves, indicating serious charge recombination due to inefficient or unbalanced charge extractions by the hole and electron extraction layers. The continuous light illumination (i.e., light-soaking) will generate free charges that can neutralize defect states in the TiO2 and perovskite layers, leading to reduced trap density and lower trap-assisted recombination, which will result in the increase of device FF, Voc and PCE.33–35

We present the stabilized J–V curves in Fig. 4a and b, from devices with and without the presence of a 15 nm-thick PDI2 interfacial layer between TiO2 and perovskite. Consistent with literature reports, the PCEs from reverse scans are higher than those from forward scans. During reverse scans, the PCE increased marginally from 19.33% to 19.84% (Jsc = 23.29 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.07 V and FF = 79.61%). While during forward scans, the perovskite solar cells without the PDI2 interfacial layer only obtained a maximum PCE of 12.87%, with a Jsc of 23.17 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.99 V and FF of 56.11%. Encouragingly, the efficiency of the device employing a PDI2 interlayer increases significantly from 12.87% to 17.50% (Jsc = 23.17 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.06 V and FF = 71.68%). The hysteresis value is therefore reduced from 6.46% to 2.34% after the addition of the PDI2 interfacial layer. The external quantum efficiency spectra (EQE) of devices with or without PDI2 are shown in Fig. 4c. The calculated Jsc values are 20.7 and 20.2 mA cm−2 for devices with or without PDI2 respectively, values that are only 10% less than the average Jsc values from our J–V measurements and confirm the validity of our J–V scans. With the presence of a PDI2 interlayer, the EQE of perovskite solar cells reduced slightly in the wavelength between ∼360 to 550 nm, which we think is attributed to the absorption of PDI2 in this region (see Fig. S4†). We also analyzed the distributions of PCEs based on 26 individual devices for two groups of perovskite solar cells. As shown in Fig. 4d, the PCEs of devices with a PDI2 interlayer lie between 16.5 and 20.0%, whilst those of devices without a PDI2 interlayer lie between 15.5 and 19.5%. The average values of different photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The presence of the PDI2 interfacial layer increased the Voc of the perovskite solar cell by approximately 70 meV from forward scans (0.99 V vs. 1.06 V, Fig. 4a and b). We believe that the PDI2 interlayer reduces the electron transport energy loss as the energy barrier is significantly reduced at the ETLs/MAPbI3 interface (see energy levels presented in Fig. 1c) and favors efficient electron transport, effect that will be beneficial to reduce hysteresis and lead to a higher Voc.36 The superior conductivity of PDI2 interlayer allow it to work as an effective electron transport pathway to avoid charge accumulation at that interface, of which is related to hysteresis and slow transient response.37 We have also examined the interactions between PbI2 and PDI2 via absorption spectrum measurements shown in Fig. 5a. The PbI2 and PDI2 mixture solution exhibited the strongest absorption than pure PbI2 or PDI2 solutions at the wavelength from 475 to 575 nm, which could indicate a coordination interaction between PbI2 and PDI2. Then the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) was applied to further confirm the interaction between PDI2 and PbI2. As shown in Fig. 5b and c, the stretching vibration of CO (v(CO)) appears at 1703 and 1660 cm−1 for the PDI2 film, which red shifted to 1698 and 1658 cm−1 for PDI2·PbI2 film, respectively. This red-shift is attributed to the coordination interaction between PbI2 and PDI2, where the acylamino oxygen functions as a Lewis base to chelate with PbI2+ and therefore passivate the surface traps of perovskite crystals at the interface of TiO2/perovskite.38,39 In our earlier discussion, we have concluded that some PDI2 materials might diffuse into the perovskite active layer during the solution casting process, coordination and defect passivation effect can also operate within the bulk of the perovskite layer if PDI2 diffusion happens, and will also contribute to improve device performance and reduce hysteresis.40,41

(b) The FTIR of PDI2, PbI2 and PDI2·PbI2 films cast from their respective solutions, and (c) expanded region for CO vibrations from 1750 to 1610 cm−1. The three films were drop cast on KBr pellets and annealed for 100 °C for 2 h and kept in high vacuum for 24 h to fully remove the DMSO solvent. 
A further demonstration of the benefit of this PDI2 interfacial layer is that the device performance is insensitive to the thickness of this interlayer. We plot in Fig. S5a† the device PCEs with the thickness of the PDI2 interlayer varied from 5 to 20 nm, from which we can see that the PCE changed only marginally in both forward and reverse scans. Although reaching a maximum value when the thickness is 15 nm, at which point a PCE of 18.57 ± 0.69%, Jsc of 22.70 ± 0.37 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.07 ± 0.01 V and FF of 76.68 ± 2.54% were achieved (see Table 1), the PCE changes are relatively small. This is a significant improvement over certain interfacial materials, e.g., PFN-OX and PEIE, which will dramatically reduce device PCE and FF when their film thickness is higher than the optimum value (ca. 5 nm) due to enhanced series resistance.17,26,27 The conductivity of PDI2 correlates with the device performance seen in Fig. S5.† Therefore, we attribute the insensitive thickness dependence of device PCE on the PDI2 interlayer to its high conductivity as a result of its extended π-conjugation.31
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements were performed to explore the charge-transport properties in these films. The MAPbI3 perovskite film cast on TiO2 surface showed a primary PL peak at 770 nm, and the intensity of this feature significantly reduced with the presence of the PDI2 interlayer, as can be seen in Fig. 6a. Since we didn't observe any notable structural and optoelectronic property changes from the perovskite layer (see Fig. 2c–f), this PL intensity reduction can be associated with effective electron transfer from perovskite to PDI2.2 This enabling of charge transfer at the interface was further confirmed by the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of perovskite films shown in Fig. 6b. The average lifetime of perovskite cast on ITO is 28.4 ns, a value that is reduced to 16.9 ns for perovskite cast on ITO/TiO2, and further reduced to 7.3 ns for perovskite cast on ITO/TiO2/PDI2. Our steady-state PL and PL lifetime testing both suggest that charge transport from perovskite to TiO2 is more efficient when applying a PDI2 interlayer, an effect that will contribute to achieving a higher device efficiency.42

The Voc as a function of light intensity of devices with or without the PDI2 interlayer are shown in Fig. 7a, from which charge recombination mechanisms can be inferred from the slope of the plots. A slope of unity for kT/q, calculated by linearly fitting Vocversus log-scaled light intensity, usually suggests that bimolecular recombination dominated in the device.43,44 A slope larger than unity for kT/q suggests the combination of bimolecular and trap-assisted recombinations. For the two types of perovskite solar cells studied here, the slope was reduced from 1.74 kT/q to 1.51 kT/q, indicating that both recombination mechanisms operate but trap-assisted charge recombination was substantially suppressed after adding the PDI2 interlayer.45 The trap density variations of devices with or without the PDI2 interlayer were quantitatively qualified from dark J–V curves of the electron-only devices ITO/TiO2 or PDI2/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag. Fig. 7b shows the dark J–V curves, in which three regions can be identified: an ohmic region, a trap-filling region and a trap-free space-charge-limited-current region (SCLC region) where all traps are filled after the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL).46 The trap density can be determined from VTFL by referring to the relationship VTFL = entL2/2εε0, where L is the thickness of the perovskite film (∼290 nm), ε (=32) is the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1).41,46 We found that the calculated trap density (nt) can be reduced from 9.8 × 1016 cm−3 to 4.6 × 1016 cm−3 after adding the PDI2 layer.

The charge carrier transport and recombination properties of our perovskite devices were further characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 7c shows the Nyquist plots of devices in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 Hz when devices were subjected to one sun illumination during testing. The plots, exhibiting only one arc for devices studied in this work, were fitted using an equivalent circuit model (see inset in Fig. 7c) comprising a series resistance (Rs), an interfacial resistance (Rinter) and a recombination resistance (Rrec) from the bulk perovskite layer.47,48 By adding the PDI2 interlayer, Rs and Rinter reduced from 165 to 119 ohms and 67 to 29 ohms, respectively (see Table 2). This supports our assertion that the interfacial transport is more efficient with the presence of PDI2 interlayer. The recombination resistance is increased from 326 to 751 ohm upon applying the PDI2 interlayer, suggesting that the perovskite layers are more efficient at suppressing charge recombination and consequently exhibit enhanced photovoltaic performance.49 This also confirms the reduced trap density after adding the PDI2 interlayer in the device, an effect that we have verified from results in Fig. 7b.

The capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics obtained from Mott–Schottky measurements was adopt to analysis the effect of PDI2 on the charge density (which is inversely proportional to the slope of the fitted straight line of the Mott–Schottky plot in the downwards region) and build-in potential (Vbi) (which is the intercept of the fitted straight line with x axis) of the device.50 The slope and Vbi were calculated to be 1.8 × 1017 and 1.05 V for TiO2-based perovskite device and 1.4 × 1017 and 1.08 V for TiO2/PDI2-based perovskite device, respectively in Fig. 7d. The increased Vbi are in coincidence with the increased Voc during forward scans with the presence of the PDI interlayer. The relative higher Vbi and higher charge density of TiO2/PDI2-based perovskite device would accelerate charge dissociation and transport and avoid charge accumulation to some extent.51,52
Conclusion
The π-conjugated small molecule PDI2 has been synthesized and explored as an efficient interfacial layer between TiO2 and perovskite to prepare perovskite solar cells. The addition of this PID2 interlayer did not influence the MAPbI3 morphology and crystallinity. The high conductivity of PDI2 and good energy alignments of the device ensure efficient charge transport and provide a rapid pathway for electron transport to inhibit interfacial accumulation and recombination. The efficiency of these perovskite solar cells showed negligible thickness dependence on the PDI2 interlayer due to its high conductivity. The oxygen atoms of carbonyl groups of PDI2 can coordinate with Pb2+ to passivate surface defects of perovskite crystals, contributing to the reduced trap density. The PDI2 interlayer therefore suppresses interfacial recombination, enhances device efficiency, reduces hysteresis and restrains the light-soaking instability. Our champion perovskite device achieved a high PCE of 19.84% with reduced hysteresis value from the initial 6.46% to 2.34% with the presence of this PDI interlayer.
Experimental section
Materials
The synthetic details of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I or MAI) and TiO2 can be found in our previous reports.16,53 Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.9%) was purchased from You Xuan Ltd (China). 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-Methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and PCBM were purchased from Luminescence Technology (Taiwan). Bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The synthesis of PDI2 was detailed in Fig. S1† and the energy level was measured and presented in Fig. S2.†
Device fabrication
The perovskite devices were fabricated on ITO glass substrates (20 × 15 mm2). The ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with ethanol, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol under ultrasonication for 10 min, then dried with N2 flow and followed with UV/ozone cleaning for 15 min. The 50 nm thick TiO2 film was deposited by spin coating TiO2 solution with the presence of the titanium oxide bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TOPD) additive, at 3000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. For devices with a PDI2 interlayer, the PDI2 films with thicknesses of 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20 nm were cast onto TiO2 film surface by spin coating from its CB solution for 30 s from 2.5 mg ml−1 solution at 3000 rpm, 5 mg ml−1 solution at 3500 rpm, 7.5 mg ml−1 solution at 7000 rpm, 7.5 mg ml−1 solution at 3500 rpm and 7.5 mg ml−1 solution at 1000 rpm, respectively. Afterwards, the perovskite films were deposited as described below. The 50 μl of mixed precursor containing PbI2 (605 mg ml−1) and MAI (50 mg ml−1) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (1:9) was dropped onto the TiO2 or TiO2/PDI2 surface spinning at 6000 rpm for 15 s, then immediately 75 μl of MAI/IPA solution (35 mg ml−1) was dropped onto it and span at 4000 rpm for 45 s. The substrate was then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min to form a MAPbI3 film of ca. 290 nm thick. After cooling down to room temperature, the 80 mg ml−1 Spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec, 99.5%) solution doped with 17.5 μl lithium-bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%) (Li-TFIS) (520 mg Li-TFIS dissolved 1 ml in acetonitrile) and 28.5 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) (Sigma-Aldrich, 96%) was spin coated onto the perovskite surface at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm thick Ag layer was deposited by thermal evaporation under a base pressure of at least 2 × 10−6 torr through a shadow mask to form the anode. The active layer of the device defined by the size of the anode layer is 4 mm2.
Device characterizations
Device characterization was carried out under AM 1.5G by using a Newport 3A solar simulator in ambient conditions. The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si reference cell certified by NREL before J–V measurements. The J–V characteristics were collected using a J–V sweep software developed by Ossila Ltd. (Sheffield, UK) and a Keithley 2612B source meter unit. All J–V measurements were performed at a scanning step of 50 mV and keeping the light on for several minutes before scanning. The forward scan range is from −0.1 to 1.2 V, while the reverse scan is from 1.2 to −0.1 V under AM 1.5G illumination. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were measured using a Zolix IPCE measurement system (Zolix SCS10-X150-DSSC) at a scanning step of 5 nm (Zolix, China). The impedance measurements were performed on the ModuLab XM electrochemical workstation (AMETEK, UK) under AM 1.5G illumination at a bias of 0.8 V, an AC voltage signal amplitude of 5 mV, and a frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 Hz. Equivalent modeling was done using the software ZView 3.1 (Scribner Associate, Inc., USA). The Cyclic voltammograms was obtained by the ModuLab XM electrochemical workstation applying Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode.
The PL spectra were obtained using a PL microscopic spectrometer (Flex One, Zolix, China) with the excitation source of PL utilizes a 532 nm CW laser. The PL lifetimes (FluoTime 300, Germany) were measured by using an excitation wavelength of 520 nm and an emission wavelength of 770 nm. The XRD patterns were measured by an X-ray diffractometer (RU-200B/D/MAX-RB RU-200B, Japan). The absorption spectra of perovskite films cast on the TiO2 or TiO2/PDI2 films and PbI2, PDI2 and PbI2 and PDI2 mixture solution and transmittance of TiO2 and TiO2/PDI2 films were obtained by UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900H, Japan). The surface morphologies were characterized by scanning probe microscope (SPM) (NT-MDT, Russia) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi S4800, Japan). The perovskite grain size was estimated using the software ImageJ. The digital photographs of devices were taken by DSLR (Nikon D7000). The film thicknesses were double-checked by a Dektak XT surface profiler (Bruker, USA) and spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam, USA). The FTIR was performed by using a Nicolet6700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo electron scientific instruments, America).
