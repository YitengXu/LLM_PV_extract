    First published on 27th June 2014AbstractRemote activation of photoactivable therapeutic compounds by light provides a high spatial and temporal control for activating the therapeutic agent. However, photoactivable compounds are mostly responsive towards ultraviolet (UV) or visible light radiation that has poor tissue penetration depth besides being unsafe to the body in the case of UV light. Nanoparticles with energy upconversion hold potential in overcoming this limit by using safe and deeply penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light. These upconversion nanoparticles (UCNs) act as versatile nanotransducers as they convert NIR light to light of shorter wavelengths that can be tuned to the NIR, visible or UV colors to suit different activation wavelengths. Their highly unusual optical properties to fluoresce with near-zero photobleaching, photoblinking and background autofluorescence are unique and an added benefit when used simultaneously as optional imaging agents. This article reviews recent advancements in the use of UCNs for photoactivation of therapeutic agents. Specifically, we discuss the use of these UCNs for activation of light-sensitive/photocaged molecules or photosensitizers for photocontrolled-delivery and photodynamic therapy.

1. Introduction
In the last few decades, photoactivation has garnered enormous interest, with applications in numerous fields ranging from medicine to energy harvesting and even pollution control. The popularity of this technology stems from its core concept of using light – an external, spatially and temporally controllable,1 non-invasive and sustainable stimulus to achieve precise control over specific processes. In the context of therapeutics, where specificity and selectivity are a major concern,2 this provides a relatively safe means of achieving precise control over processes like drug or gene delivery, cell killing etc., thereby reducing side effects and improving therapeutic efficacy.
Photoactivation encompasses an umbrella of techniques such as photodynamic therapy, photo-triggered release systems, photocaging, photoisomerization etc., which use light in different ways to achieve specific outcomes. These include generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by light responsive chemicals called photosensitizers to kill cells – a technique termed photodynamic therapy (PDT) that is being developed for cancer treatment as well as to achieve antimicrobial and antifungal effects. Light is also being used as a trigger for on-demand release of bioactive/small molecules in photo-triggered release systems.
The obvious advantage that light has as a stimulus over other stimuli has fostered the rapid growth of this technology. However, the widespread use of the aforementioned techniques is hindered by certain limitations. For biomedical photoactivation applications such as PDT and photo-triggered release, the most commonly used excitation sources are visible and ultraviolet (UV) light, primarily because the photosensitive compounds used in these techniques are sensitive to these wavelengths. These light sources have low tissue penetration, and UV in particular is known to be toxic. This limits to a great degree, the in vivo applications of these techniques.
Judging from the limitations highlighted above, photoactivation would benefit enormously if longer wavelength light sources such as infrared could be used for activation. Such wavelengths would offer deeper tissue penetration which is important for in vivo therapeutic applications. However, direct excitation using these longer wavelength light sources is not often feasible since the photosensitive compounds used in these processes do not respond to these wavelengths. Thus, an energy transduction mechanism that can convert this infrared light into the UV or visible light sources to which these compounds are sensitive is needed. This can be achieved using two-photon excitation or upconversion. Both these systems involve the non-linear conversion of low energy near infrared light (NIR) to higher energy photons. The main difference between the two is that in two-photon excitation, simultaneous absorption of two NIR photons is involved, whereas in upconversion, two or more NIR photons can be absorbed in a sequential process, made possible due to the presence of intermediate metastable states.3 Since the probability of simultaneous absorption of photons is lower than that of sequential absorption, the efficiency of two-photon excitation is significantly lower than that of upconversion.4
The higher efficiency of upconversion processes in comparison to two-photon excitation has provided the impetus for the rapid growth of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNs) as nanotranducers for photoactivation applications. These particles are excited at long wavelength NIR and can be tuned to emit across a range of UV and visible light (depending on the type of dopants used and their ratios) in keeping with the absorption characteristics of the photoresponsive molecule in question (Fig. 1). Until recently, UCNs were being used primarily for biomedical applications such as PDT. However, the last few years have seen a growing trend in the use of UCNs for applications such as photo-triggered delivery systems, solar energy harvesting, microbial inactivation and control of various photochemical and photophysical reactions. This review will describe the various photoactivation techniques that can be realized using UCNs, the different kinds of UCN-based systems that have been deployed for these purposes, their advantages, limitations and the emerging trends in the field of UCN-based photoactivation.

2. Upconversion nanoparticles for photodynamic therapy
The last decade has seen a growing interest in the use of upconversion-based photoactivation modality in the development of new generation PDT drugs for the light-activated production of ROS. To this end, conventional PDT has been reported as a successful primary or adjuvant treatment modality for a number of solid tumors, some examples being bladder,5 esophagus,6 lung,7 breast,8 prostate9 and skin10,11 cancers. However, PDT is not limited only to cancer therapy, but it is also being explored as a tool to kill bacteria and fungi with implications in treating infections, cardiovascular, ophthalmic and dermatological diseases. The mechanism of PDT relies on three key components: light, a photosensitizer and oxygen. Following administration of a photosensitizer either systemically, locally, or topically to a patient bearing the disease, illumination of the diseased site with a suitable light would kick-start a cascade of electron transfer processes that culminates in the generation of ROS. Specifically, if the light matches the maximum absorption wavelength of the photosensitizer, electrons of the photosensitizer get excited to a higher energy level and convert it to a short-lived excited singlet state. In this state, it has the ability to undergo intersystem crossing whereby the spin of its excited electron gets inverted to form a relatively long-lived excited triplet-state.12,13 The excited triplet-state can transfer its energy to a neighbouring substrate to produce intermediary free radical species that can then react with surrounding oxygen to produce superoxide anion radicals, hydrogen peroxides and hydroxyl radicals (type I reaction). Alternatively, a photosensitizer in its triplet state can directly transfer its energy to surrounding oxygen that also exists as a triplet in its ground state, to form an excited state singlet oxygen (1O2) (type II reaction). For most photosensitizers, the latter type II reaction is the prevailing mechanistic route in generating ROS.
The therapeutic effect is exerted as the highly reactive ROS induces oxidative damage to biomolecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that ultimately leads to cell death.14 The mechanism of cell death is multifactorial and could either be from direct cell death by necrosis and/or apoptosis, deprivation of oxygen and nutrients following tumor vasculature shutdown as well as stimulation of immune response against the diseased cells.15 Since ROS has an extremely brief lifetime that is in the order of only nano- to micro-seconds,16,17 this key cytotoxic agent in PDT is generated only upon irradiation of the photosensitizer. By selectively irradiating only the disease site, little or no damage is incurred to surrounding healthy tissues, thereby making the treatment regimen a highly localized one with lower toxic side effects compared to other cancer therapies such as chemo- and radio-therapy.18 Other appealing features of PDT include the option to repeat the therapy without cumulative toxicity, its minimal invasiveness, cost-effectiveness and short treatment time that is often performed as an outpatient procedure.
Admittedly though, PDT has yet to gain widespread acceptance as a frontline cancer therapy. As introduced earlier, a major limitation of PDT (as with other photoactivation techniques) is attributed to its poor tissue penetration that limits its application to flat, superficial tumors or tumors that are accessible to endoscopes, whereas solid organ tumors are at a thickness much greater than that possible with current technology. Apparently, for most photosensitizers, the light that is needed to activate them lies in the UV-visible region that has tissue penetrability only in the range of millimetres, beyond which the energy gets attenuated dramatically such that insufficient ROS is generated to produce an appropriate photodynamic effect. Tissue transparency is attained only in the NIR window (700 to 1000 nm) where light absorption and scattering by biomolecules within the tissue reaches a minimum.19 Although efforts have been made to synthesize new photosensitizers with maximum absorption shifted to the NIR wavelength, they are still rare and early in development.20,21 Moreover, the energy of NIR light at the single-photon level is normally too low for effective ROS generation. Although this can be overcome by two-photon PDT whereby the photosensitizer is excited by simultaneous absorption of two low-energy NIR photons, an expensive pulsed laser excitation source is required to reduce photodamage of surrounding tissue from the extremely high laser power, thereby limiting its clinical application.
In recent times, an elegant approach that cleverly exploits the use of UCNs as a transducer to convert the low-energy but highly penetrating NIR light to higher-energy UV-visible light matching the activation wavelength of existing photosensitizers was proposed. By this method, old, proven, good photosensitizers can continue to be used to realize their full therapeutic potential of deep tissue therapy. The unique optical property of UCNs has been harnessed here primarily for the purpose of harvesting NIR light to emit light of higher energy for effective activation of photosensitizers at deeper tissue layers that were previously inaccessible to UV-visible light. Alongside this, UCNs can also be used as a carrier of photosensitizers for their delivery to tumor sites. As with other nanoparticles, UCN's nanoparticulate size confers it the ability to preferentially accumulate in tumors based on the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. If necessary, specific delivery of the UCN–photosensitizer composite can be enhanced by the use of targeting moieties grafted to their surface. Moreover, by formulating these mostly hydrophobic photosensitizers in the nanoparticulate form, their previous difficulty in achieving a stable dispersion in physiologically acceptable solvents for systemic administration can now be overcome. Ideally, the UCN–photosensitizer composite could also serve as a single theranostic platform with multifunctional capabilities for simultaneous imaging and therapy in a “see and treat” approach of PDT. UCN's unique optical property to emit multiple emission bands under a single NIR excitation wavelength can be exploited in both exciting a photosensitizer as well as for optical imaging. Indeed, designing a new generation of PDT drug based on UCNs that suitably meets the ideals of PDT is challenging. A well-thought-out design would take into consideration the selection of a upconversion phosphor–photosensitizer pair that has minimal mismatch between the upconversion luminescence emission and photosensitizer absorption for the maximum coupling effect but yet individually possess a high upconversion efficiency and high ROS production efficiency respectively; an overall particle size, size distribution and surface property that is conducive for tumor-specific accumulation; a tunable loading capacity of the photosensitizer drug cargo but with zero leakage; surface property that confers hydrophilicity and biocompatibility to the nanoconstruct for use in biological systems; and a synthesis procedure that is simple for reproduction and scaling up. In the following paragraphs to come, we will dissect the different ingenious designs of UCN-based PDT drugs that have been reported to date, in their attempt to achieve the ideals of PDT. A summary of the study designs is also featured in Table 1.

2.1 Design of a UCN-based PDT drug

2.1.1 The upconversion phosphor core: host matrix and ion dopants. 
At the heart of the UCN–PDT system lies the upconversion phosphor core wherein the all-important task of converting low energy NIR light to higher energy, shorter wavelength ones is executed. By serving the first key component in PDT (i.e. the light component), judicious selection of the right core material in terms of the type of host matrix and ion dopants embedded in it is thus crucial in affording a suitable emission light with high upconversion efficiency to the next key component – the photosensitizer.
The first report on using UCNs for PDT chose hexagonal-phase (β) sodium yttrium fluoride (NaYF4) as its host matrix.22 Given the fact that NaYF4 is one of the most efficient upconversion host materials,52,53 it is not surprising that NaYF4 is now the most popularly used host material in a majority of the UCN–PDT studies done to date, with just a handful of studies reporting on the use other materials like NaGdF4,32,35 NaLuF4 (ref. 48) and NaYbF4 (ref. 46) (Table 1). Next comes the choice of ions doped into the host matrix. By controlling the type and amount of ions doped, the emission color of UCNs can be tuned to the desired wavelength such that it matches the absorption band of the selected photosensitizers. Amongst the various sensitizer and activator ions reported, the Yb3+–Er3+ pair remained the classic combination used in most PDT application, due to its high efficiency in producing upconversion luminescence in the blue (albeit weakest), green and more importantly, red upconversion emissions,54 the last being most commonly harnessed to activate widely used commercial photosensitizers. In view of this, Xia et al. have recently made an attempt to enhance the red upconversion emission by deliberately increasing the doping concentration of Yb3+ ions to 25% from the conventionally-used amount of 18–20%.49 In another strategy to enhance the red upconversion luminescence, the manganese ion (Mn2+) was doped into a NaYF4:Yb,Er core to obtain a pure, single-band red emission peak that showed much stronger luminescence compared to its Mn2+-free counterpart.43,44 When UV and/or blue light is required to activate other less common photosensitizers such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) and hypocrellin A, the Yb3+–Tm3+ sensitizer–activator pair would normally be recruited instead.36,46 In their NaYbF4:Tm,Gd UCNs, Jin et al. doped the gadolinium ion (Gd3+) into the host matrix to induce a cubic-to-hexagonal phase transition of the NaYbF4 nanocrystal such that an enhancement of the blue upconversion luminescence emitted was achieved.46 Indeed, geometric shape of the UCN nanocrystals also plays a role in determining its upconversion efficiency, with hexagonal phase nanocrystals displaying a remarkably higher upconversion luminescence than cubic-phase ones.54,55 Aside from improving the upconversion luminescence output, ions such as Gd3+ and Mn2+ doped into the host matrix also impart paramagnetic properties to the UCNs such that they can now double up as a T1- or T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent.32,35,43,44,46,51 Alternatively, a shell of upconversion phosphor material NaFY4:Yb,Er has also been coated around a Fe3O4 core, conferring the resultant particle with T2-weighted MRI capability that is claimed to be a safer MRI contrast agent as opposed to the more toxic Gd3+-doped particles.42 The upconversion phosphor core may also be coated with an undoped matrix shell such as NaGdF4 (ref. 32, 38, 46) and CaF2 (ref. 35) to form a core–shell structure that will minimize luminescence quenching attributed to the core surface defect, thereby providing another means to improve the upconversion luminescence emitted. In yet another variation of the UCN design, Liu et al. coated the NaYF4:Yb,Tm shell onto a NaYF4:Yb,Er core to confer multicolor capability for simultaneous imaging and PDT.41 It is clear from this that rational selection of ions doped into the host matrix is crucial in determining the eventual functionality of the synthesized UCNs, with multi-functionalities from a single nanoplatform now seemingly to be the more popular trend.


2.1.2 Surface coatings. 
The upconversion phosphor core, synthesized per se, is normally bare and hydrophobic. As such, the usual practice is to coat the core with a thin layer of shell that will confer it hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, biofunctionality as well as a means to carry the photosensitizers.
2.1.2.1 Coating with stabilizers. 
To date, polymeric coating has been by far the most popular approach employed in a majority of the UCN–PDT studies listed (Table 1). This ranges from polyethylenimine (PEI),23,30,48 polyethylene glycol (PEG)31,42,44,49 and its variations such as the PEG-b-PCL amphiphilic block copolymer,24 the PEG-b-PLA block copolymer,27 PEG-grafted poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (C18PMH-PEG),28 PEG-phospholipids,38 PEG-succinimidyl carbonate,41 OQPGA-PEG lipid micelle,45 to polyacrylic acid (PAA).39,44,51 Their main attractive feature lies in their well-documented ability to confer stability to the colloidal UCNs in aqueous solutions. For instance, PEG-b-PLA block copolymeric coating on the UCN core was reported to show a stable dispersion of the particles in water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and serum-containing medium for at least three months.27 OQPGA-PEG lipid micelle harbors both hydrophilic and hydrophobic arms that enable the encapsulation of hydrophobic photosensitizers while still achieving water dispersibility of the coated particles.45 Amongst the different polymers, PEG is particularly attractive. Besides conferring water solubility to PEGylated particles, PEG can also be flexibly used as a linker for conjugation between the UCN and a targeting moiety as the two ends of a PEG molecule can be tailored to carry different (or the same) functional groups, with the benefit that its long chain acts as a spacer to reduce steric hindrance. PEG coating also enhances the particles' biocompatibility as it displays lack of toxicity and low immunogenicity. Indeed, various studies have reported on the low toxicity of PEGylated UCNs, with toxicity becoming apparent only beyond the particles' concentration of 200 μg mL−1 for 24 h incubation with HeLa human cervical cancer cells49 and 400 μg mL−1 for 2 h incubation with 4T1 murine breast cancer cells.28 This was similarly observed when UCNs were coated with other variations of the PEG molecule. Negligible dark toxicity was reported with PEG-succinimidyl carbonate-coated UCNs at a concentration below 800 μg mL−1 when incubated for 24 h with HeLa human cervical cancer cells,41 with PEG-phospholipid-coated UCNs at a concentration lower than 250 μg mL−1 when incubated for 24 h with U87-MG human glioblastoma cells,38 and with PEG-b-PLA block copolymer-coated UCNs at a concentration of 14.9 μg mL−1 when incubated for 48 h with HeLa human cervical cancer cells.27,56In vivo, PEGylated UCNs also showed minimal systemic toxicity. Mice intratumorally administered with 43 to 50 mg kg−1 of PEGylated UCNs gave no indication of significant variation in their body weight nor abnormality or appreciable damage to major organs such as the liver, lung and kidney,28,49 with near-complete clearance of the particles from the mouse body being observed after 60 days, based on yttrium content analysis of the NaYF4-based UCNs.29 In a long-term study done by Xiong et al.,56 PAA-coated UCNs intravenously injected into mice at a concentration of 15 mg kg−1 did not exhibit apparent toxic effects for up to 115 days, based on observational, histological, hematological and biochemical assessment. By 14 days post injection, the upconversion luminescence signal was barely detectable in the liver and spleen, but not in the intestines, thus indicating near complete clearance of the particles from the reticuloendothelial system (RES) of the liver and spleen, but an on-going clearance via the hepatobiliary transport. Interestingly, a head-to-head comparison between PEG- and PAA-coated UCNs revealed a more superior stability of the PEG-coated UCN in physiological solutions such as saline and serum, besides also exhibiting a longer circulatory half-life than its PAA-coated counterpart, though both particles showed no adverse toxic side effects.57 Polymers are, however, not without their disadvantages. For example, although PEG-b-PCL amphiphilic block copolymeric and PAA coating confers water dispersibility to UCNs, they become unstable when exposed to salt-containing buffers or serum-containing media.27,51 The agglomeration of these particles would lead to their poor bioavailability as they get rapidly cleared from the body by the RES. For this reason, Chen et al. have recently reported on an additional modification to their PAA-coated UCNs with the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) that conferred stability to the particles even in physiological solutions such as PBS.51 PEI coating, unlike the biocompatible PEG, may prove to be impractical when used in a biological setting owing to its toxicity.58 Lim et al.14 and Yuan et al.25 reported non-toxicity of their PEI-coated UCNs against dengue virus serotype-2 at a concentration of 44 μg mL−1 and towards lymphoblastic leukemic cells at a concentration of 250 μg mL−1 with 2 h of incubation, respectively. These values are lower than the aforementioned limit displayed by PEG-coated UCNs. It was also reported that polymer encapsulation of the UCN nanocrystals may quench the upconversion luminescence emitted by as much as 50 to 90%, with higher polymer concentration displaying greater attenuation.24
Next in popularity comes silica coating (Fig. 2), with a history that goes as far back as the first report on using UCN for PDT.22,25,26,32,33,35,37 Being known for its stability, low toxicity and easy functionalization, Zhang and co-workers have back then, coated a thin layer of silica doped with photosensitizers onto the UCN core.22 While such silica coating renders better particle dispersibility in water and compatibility in biological system besides providing easy access for subsequent conjugation to targeting agents,22,59,60 its porosity is also tunable on the nanometer scale to provide control over the pore size for flexibility in hosting a high payload of differently sized photosensitizer molecules. In the context of PDT, the porous matrix is especially favored due to its presumably better permeability to ROS molecules and thus their efficient release out of the silica layer, though a “dense” silica network has also been found to have tiny pores that allow for the diffusion of small molecules like water and oxygen.61 Encapsulating photosensitizers within the silica shell also protects them from degradation in external hostile environments and promotes their in vitro and in vivo dissolution, altogether improving their bioavailability for a more effective PDT. Zhao et al. showed a toxicity limit of 100 μg mL−1 of their silica-coated UCNs incubated with MEAR murine liver cancer cells for 24 h, with cell viability reaching just below 80% of untreated cells.32 A higher tolerance was observed with mesoporous silica-coated UCNs in which a similar response of around 80% cell viability was observed when MB49-PSA modified murine bladder cancer cells were incubated with 200 μg mL−1 of the particles for 24 h.26

Although less commonly employed, chitosan coating is another form of polymer surface coating that has been utilized in UCN–PDT studies.29,34,40 By virtue of its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity and non-immunogenicity, chitosan offers the promise of an ideal polymer for biological application. Its amphiphilicity was exploited to solubilize both the hydrophobic photosensitizers that were entrapped within it as well as enhance the water dispersibility and stability of the UCN construct in physiological solutions. As chitosan harbors diverse functional groups in its parent backbone, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl and amine, it also provides the convenience for chemical modification to other bio-specific moieties should a targeting agent needs to be attached to the UCNs.34,40 Additionally, chitosan's unique behavior to display a positive charge under acidic conditions would favor for its accumulation in the acidic tumor microenvironment for a more targeted PDT.62 Surface coating of UCNs with chitosan boasts an impressive reduced toxicity compared to its mesoporous silica-coated counterpart. Even at a high concentration of 800 μg mL−1 of N-succinyl-N′-octyl chitosan-coated UCNs, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells remained 90% viable after 24 h exposure to the particles.29 This was similarly observed in O-carboxymethylated chitosan-coated UCNs that showed more than 85% viability with U87-MG human glioblastoma cancer cells exposed to the particles at a concentration of 400 μg mL−1 for a lengthy 48 h incubation.34 When administered intratumorally in mice at a therapeutic dose of 33 mg kg−1, no discerned variation in body weight nor abnormality and tumor metastasis were seen in major organs of the mice, such as the heart, spleen, liver, lung and kidney, by the fourteenth day after injection.29 In yet another study, in vivo acute toxicity and biochemical assessment revealed a dose-dependent systemic toxicity of the chitosan-coated UCNs administered intravenously into mice, with a relatively high median lethal dosage (LD50) of 150 mg kg−1 that is way above the therapeutic range normally used in UCN-based PDT studies, thus affording it a greater margin of safety.40
Other forms of surface coatings that have been reported, but used rather remotely in UCN–PDT studies, include coatings with α-cyclodextrin,43 Tween-2046 and aminophenylboronic acid (APBA).50 α-Cyclodextrin and Tween-20 were used to transfer the hydrophobic oleic acid capped-UCN core into water.43,46 Both approaches demonstrated a stable monodispersion of the surface modified particles in water as well as a good biocompatibility. A considerable high toxicity limit of 400 μg mL−1 was reported for α-cyclodextrin-coated UCNs incubated with A-549 human epithelial lung cancer cells, which left more than 90% of the cells viable even after 24 h of incubation with the particles.43 Likewise, Tween-20-coated UCNs showed a satisfactory low toxicity that is able to maintain a cell viability of more than 80% with A-549 or HeLa cells exposed to 200 μg mL−1 of the particles.46 On top of these, Tween-20 offers the additional advantage of a low-cost and resistance against non-specific adsorption of proteins. APBA, interestingly, served the purpose of both a stabilizer to the hydrophobic UCNs core as well as a ligand for targeted bioimaging. Negligible dark toxicity was also observed when these APBA-coated UCNs were incubated with PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells or NIH 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblast cells at a concentration below 120 μg mL−1, in which more than 80% of the cells remained viable even after 24 h of exposure to the particles.50 To conclude, every type of coating has its own advantages and disadvantages. But certain polymeric coatings like PEG derivatives are presumably better than other coatings like silica and chitosan due to its low toxicity, better biocompatibility, longer retention times, better functionality and ease of modification. The use of polymers for encapsulation of the UCNs and photosensitizers might also achieve better photosensitizer loading than physical adsorption or covalent linking. Also there are several polymers which have been already approved for clinical use. Usage of such polymers for surface modification might expedite the progress of this technology for clinical applications.
2.1.2.2 Coating with targeting moieties. 
Besides having a layer of stabilizers coated onto the UCN core, an additional modification is sometimes engaged to graft biomolecular recognition moieties to the nanoconstruct surface to enhance its targeted delivery to specific sites for a more effective PDT and fewer side effects. This is especially useful in cases where systemic administration does not result in sufficient accumulation of the drug at the treatment site simply by passive targeting from the EPR effect. The most widely-adopted targeting moiety that has been used in UCN–PDT studies to date is folic acid (FA) (Table 1).23,31,37,40,41,49 Many have been drawn to this vitamin B9 due to its numerous benefits including small size (only 441 Da), non-immunogenicity, inexpensiveness, and stability over a broad range of temperatures and pH values, being relatively safe to use and most importantly, its natural high affinity for folate receptors (FR) that are selectively overexpressed on the surface of many human cancers. Upon their capture by these FR (Fig. 3), FA-conjugates would be internalized into the cell via a non-destructive, recycling endosomal pathway.63,64 By this pathway, the invaginated FR can be regenerated at the cell surface for capture and internalization of more FA-conjugates, thereby providing these particles an opportunistic route for enhanced uptake into the targeted cells. FA conjugated to the surface of UCNs has been found to actively bind to FR overexpressed on HT29 human colon cancer cells,23 JAR human choriocarcinoma cells,31 B16F0 murine melanoma cells,37 Bel-7402 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells,40 murine S180 sarcoma tumors40 and HeLa human cervical cancer cells.41,49 Cui et al. have also reported in vivo tumor targeting of their FA-modified nanoconstruct that showed maximal tumor uptake at 24 h post intravenous injection and displayed an impressive high tumor to muscle contrast that persisted for more than 96 h post-injection.40

Antibodies have also been employed as targeting agents in UCN–PDT studies.22,30,36 A myriad of antibodies are presently available to target different types of tumors. As the antibody is specific towards antigens that are expressed on the target cell surface, their conjugation to a UCN construct provide a means to bring the nanoparticles to target cells through the highly specific antigen–antibody interaction. Lim and colleagues showed increased target specificity of their dengue virus serotype 2 antibody-conjugated UCN construct to dengue virus-infected cells30 while Xu et al. demonstrated targeted cancer cell ablation activities with their cAngptl4 antibody-conjugated UCN composite.36 The use of antibody as a targeting moiety, however, comes with the caveat of producing bulky nanocomposites due to the large size of these antibodies (approximately 150 kDa for typically used IgG1 isotype). Furthermore, depending on the type of antigen that it binds to, there is a likelihood that the antigen–antibody interaction would only be restricted to the cell surface and that no internalization of the nanoparticles into the cell would ensue following the binding activity for a more destructive cell killing effect.
Another targeting strategy that has been reported by groups engaged in UCN–PDT studies is peptide targeting.34,45 Zhou et al. conjugated the peptide cyclic arginine glycine aspartic acid (RGD) to their UCN construct to target αvβ3 integrin on the surface of U87-MG tumor cells for a selective PDT killing.34 In a similar approach, Wang and co-workers modified their UCNs with a combination of RGD and a cell-penetrating trans-activating transcriptional activator (TAT) peptide to achieve both targeted delivery of the nanoconstruct via the αvβ3 integrin–RGD peptide interaction as well as enhanced intracellular uptake through the TAT peptide-mediated translocation of the nanoparticles across the cell membrane.45
In another unique selection of targeting moieties, Wang et al. chose two types of targeting ligands, APBA and hyaluronic acid (HA), to respectively target polysialic acid and cluster determinant 44 (CD44) receptors overexpressed in cancer cells.50 Here, APBA also served as a stabilizer of the UCN core besides performing its function as a targeting agent. Others have turned to single-stranded oligonucleotides called aptamers as a targeting moiety.48 By having several advantages such as ease of synthesis and modification, flexibility in design, chemical stability and ability to penetrate tissue quickly, aptamers are slowly gaining reign over antibodies as a targeting ligand.65 Additionally, their natural ability to fold into a G-quadruplex (GQ) structure that can be stabilized by small-molecule ligands such as porphyrins provides an unusual means to load photosensitizers with porphyrin molecular structures.66 Recently, Yuan et al. conjugated the DNA aptamer, sgc8, loaded with the photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)-21H,23H-porphine (TMPyP4) to their UCNs and demonstrated specific binding affinity of the aptamer–UCN conjugate to the cell membrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase 7 overexpressed on CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemic cells.48


2.1.3 Photosensitizers. 
Photosensitizers form the next key component of the PDT regimen. Ideally, a photosensitizer should have good ROS production efficiency, a high absorption coefficient at longer wavelengths for better tissue penetration, amphiphilicity, low dark toxicity, ease of synthesis and ease of formulation in aqueous solvents for in vivo delivery.67 In other words, the photosensitizer should be easy to deliver, localize in the cell membrane and kill cells only when excited by light to ensure specificity and selectivity of the treatment process. Keeping these requirements in mind, several different kinds of photosensitizers have been developed for PDT and they can be broadly classified into chemical groups such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, chlorins, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and naphthalocyanines, photosensitizers like porfimer sodium, temoporfin, 5-aminolevulinic acid, methyl aminolevulinate, hexyl aminolevulinate, talaporfin sodium, aluminium phthalocyanine disulphonate, tin ethyl etiopurpurin and verteporfin have been approved for clinical use. However, many of these photosensitizers are still fraught with less-than-perfect characteristics that include aggregation in aqueous solutions due to their hydrophobic nature, poor selectivity, low extinction coefficients, absorption at relatively short wavelengths and high accumulation rates in the skin. Development of nanocarriers for delivering these photosensitizers has come a long way in overcoming a majority of these issues. UCNs, in particular, play multiple roles by being a carrier for photosensitizers, a light transducer to harvest deeply penetrating NIR light for conversion to higher-energy radiation that can be used for activation of the photosensitizer in deeper tissues, besides also enhancing its selectivity towards cancer sites through the attachment of specific targeting moieties on the particle's surface. By delivering photosensitizers in the nanoparticulate form, a stable dispersion of these mostly hydrophobic drugs can now be attained. The previous problem of aggregation (that will diminish their photosensitizing ability) in physiologically acceptable solvents which is generally aqueous-based, as well as toxicity of the free drug will thus be eliminated, making them better suited for clinical applications. Besides, most nanoparticle matrices are also effective in protecting their drug cargo from degradation during delivery, thereby enhancing the latter's otherwise poor bioavailability in hostile external environments.
2.1.3.1 Matching of photosensitizers to the upconversion phosphor core. 
Careful selection of the right photosensitizer based on its photophysical and chemical properties is thus crucial in ensuring a high ROS production for an effective therapeutic outcome. In designing a UCN-based PDT drug, the choice of photosensitizer is additionally dictated by the activation light made available by the upconversion phosphor core or vice versa. In fact, selecting a photosensitizer that has the slightest mismatch between its absorption and the upconversion luminescence emission should be of first priority. As the emission spectrum of UCNs lies in the broad visible light region, this overlaps with the absorption spectrum of many photosensitizers, hence affording flexibility in choosing from a wide range of photosensitizers. Amongst all, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) top as the most frequently selected photosensitizer for coupling with a UCN nanoconstruct for PDT studies (Table 1).23,25,26,29,30,37,39,40,43,45,49 The reason is twofold, the first being attributed to its strong absorption in the red wavelength range (molar absorption coefficient of ∼282000 M−1 cm−1 at 672 nm)68 that matches well with the 660 nm red upconversion emission of typical Yb3+–Er3+ doped UCNs, and the second being endowed with a considerably high 1O2 quantum yield (0.67).69 Although other phthalocyanines such as the clinically-approved tetra-sulfonic phthalocyanine aluminium (AlPcS4), tetrasubstituted carboxy aluminum phthalocyanine (AlC4Pc) and silicon phthalocyanine dihydroxide have also been recruited for incorporation into a UCN-based PDT drug,32,35,42 they are substantially less popular, probably due to their lower molar absorption coefficient and 1O2 quantum yield than ZnPc.70,71
Chlorin e6 (Ce6) is the next most widely employed photosensitizer in UCN–PDT studies.28,38,43,44 It features a high 1O2 quantum yield (0.64 in PBS)71 and a strong absorption peak in the blue region (molar absorption coefficient of 200000 M−1 cm−1 at 402 nm)72–74 as well as a smaller peak in the red region (molar absorption coefficient of 40000 M−1 cm−1 at 654 nm).75 Although absorption of the photosensitizer is weaker in the red wavelength range, many have preferred it over the blue peak owing to the deep penetration characteristic in this long-wave spectral area. Hence, PDT involving a free Ce6 photosensitizer is normally performed using red light rather than blue light. In principle, UCNs can provide a unique opportunity to utilize both absorption peaks of Ce6 for a maximized ROS production. Here, the Yb3+–Er3+ doped UCN's capability to emit multiple emission peaks, particularly in the blue and red regions that overlap with the two absorption bands of Ce6, is most suited for use in conjunction with the photosensitizer. In a study by Park and co-workers, Ce6 loaded onto a UCN nanoconstruct was found not only to act as a photosensitizer, but also led to the enhanced accumulation and retention of the nanoparticles in tumors, besides also showing longer blood circulation half-lives than its counterpart that was not loaded with Ce6.38 This is indeed interesting since the UCN nanoconstruct was not modified with any tumor targeting agent to confer it with an active targeting ability to the tumor sites. The authors have attributed this to the lipophilic characteristics of Ce6 that facilitates the intracellular uptake of UCN–Ce6 nanocomposites across the lipid membranes as well as their better colloidal stability over void UCNs.
Porphyrins such as tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP), meso-tetraphenyl porphine (TPP) and TMPyP4 or their clinically-approved precursor ALA, have also been used in conjunction with UCNs for PDT.24,27,47,48 They display a strong absorption at ∼410 to 425 nm of the blue region (molar absorption coefficient of ∼170000 to 400000 M−1 cm−1)76 with smaller subsidiary absorption peaks extending from ∼620 to 640 nm (molar absorption coefficient of ∼3500 M−1 cm−1),77 besides also having a relatively high 1O2 quantum yield (∼0.56).70,71 Groups utilizing these photosensitizers for UCN–PDT studies have coupled it to Yb3+–Er3+ doped UCNs as their choice of upconversion phosphor core since its 410 nm blue upconversion emission peak better matches the maximum absorption band of these porphyrin-based photosensitizers as compared to the ∼450 and 470 nm blue upconversion luminescence peaks of Yb3+–Tm3+ doped UCNs. In the studies done by Ungun et al. and Shan et al., however, activation of their loaded TPP photosensitizer did not capitalize on the 410 nm blue upconversion emission of their Yb3+–Er3+ doped UCNs, but rather on its 540 nm green and 660 nm red upconversion peaks instead.24,27 A closer look at their UCN design revealed an upconversion luminescence spectrum showing near-nil emission in the 410 nm blue region.28 This is rather surprising given the fact that Yb3+–Er3+ doped UCNs typically produce upconversion luminescence peaks in all of the blue, green and red regions of the visible spectrum. It can thus be suggested here that Yb3+–Er3+ doped UCNs with a 410 nm blue upconversion emission peak (aside from the green and red upconversion peaks) could have been a better choice of upconversion phosphor core for use with porphyrin-based photosensitizers.
Other photosensitizers activated using the red upconversion luminescence of UCNs for PDT applications include methylene blue (MB)33,43 and pyropheophorbide a.34 MB is a water soluble photosensitizer whose monomeric form shows a strong absorption at 654 nm (molar absorption coefficient of ∼82000 M−1 cm−1 at 666 nm)70 and a relatively high 1O2 quantum yield (0.52 in aqueous solution).78 Tian et al.43 and Chen et al.34 separately fabricated a NaYF4:Yb(18%),Er(2%),Mn(30%) and NaYF4:Er(2%),Yb(18%),Gd(15%) upconversion phosphor core, respectively, emitting red luminescence at ∼651 to 653 nm to closely match the absorption band of their loaded MB. The large spectral overlap between the donor UCN and acceptor photosensitizer is the best known match reported between an upconversion emission and a given photosensitizer absorption, with a mismatch of merely less than 5 nm. Pyropheophorbide a shows a high 1O2 quantum yield (0.69)71 aside from a strong absorption at ∼413 nm (molar absorption coefficient of ∼105000 M−1 cm−1)79 and a decent absorption at 668 nm (molar absorption coefficient of ∼44000 M−1 cm−1)79 that overlaps considerably with the typical blue and red emission band of Yb3+–Er3+ doped UCN. Its free carboxylic group is an added plus point for further modification of the photosensitizer should the preferred path of loading the drug be via covalent conjugation.80
Aside from utilizing the blue and red upconversion luminescence of Yb3+–Er3+ doped UCNs, its green emission has also been exploited for activation of other photosensitizers such as Rose Bengal and merocyanine 540 (MC540).22,31,37,51 Rose Bengal is a water soluble photosensitizer that absorbs strongly in the 549 nm region (molar absorption coefficient of 100000 M−1 cm−1)70 and displays a high 1O2 quantum yield (0.72).81 Yb3+–Er3+ doped UCN is a straightforward choice for coupling to this photosensitizer by virtue of its intensely bright 540 nm green upconversion luminescence (typically predominating over other emission colors) that overlaps well with the absorption band of Rose Bengal. Likewise, it has also been chosen for activating the photosensitizer MC540 due to its large spectral overlap with MC540's strong absorption at 556 nm (molar absorption coefficient of 110000 M−1 cm−1).70 The use of MC540, however, comes with the caveat of a low 1O2 quantum yield (0.11 at maximum).82 In an attempt to amplify the therapeutic function of UCN-based PDT, our group had exploited on UCNs' capability of multicolor emissions at a single NIR excitation wavelength to activate two photosensitizers, MC540 and ZnPc, at the same time for an enhanced PDT.37 NaYF4:Yb(18%),Er(2%) UCN's strong emission in both the 540 nm green and 660 nm red colors were fully harnessed to activate the two photosensitizers, MC540 and ZnPc, respectively. It was suggested that simultaneous use of multiple photosensitizers offers a therapeutic advantage over single ones83–86 and that may allow lower dose of the drug and/or light to be used, thereby minimizing chances of side effects common to the PDT regimen. Notably however, this combined approach is less explored and could have been attributed to their cumbersome nature of requiring multiple wavelengths of light to activate the different photosensitizers. Our approach to co-deliver multiple photosensitizers with single wavelength activation provides a unique means to bring the two combination of photosensitizers to a treatment site without the need for complicated multiple wavelengths excitation.
Though rare, the Yb3+–Tm3+ doped UCN has also been recruited for use with photosensitizers that require UV and/or blue light activation. TiO2, hypocrellin A and fullerenes are some examples of these.36,41,46,50 Their requirement for activation by UV light has been a major impediment to their practical clinical usage. Besides having an extremely superficial penetration depth of only fractions of a milliliter due to the strong absorption and scattering of UV light by tissues,87,88 UV light is also generally known to cause mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on the skin. Here, Yb3+–Tm3+ doped UCN's ability to upconvert safe and deeply penetrating NIR light into UV/blue light provides a unique path for UV light to bypass the skin and its adjacent tissue linings for direct activation of the photosensitizers at deeper tissue layers. Strangely though, this was not capitalized by Xu et al. in their study using the NaYF4:Yb(18%),Tm(0.0017%) UCN–TiO2 nanocomposite for PDT application.19 Apparently, no emission in the UV region was evident in their upconversion luminescence spectrum. This is rather surprising, as our own experience with NaYF4:Yb(25%),Tm(0.3%) UCNs normally reveals a strong UV upconversion peak at the 350 nm region,89 which could have been easily exploited for effective activation of the loaded TiO2. The discrepancy could have been attributed to the different synthesis route employed in fabricating the two NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNs. While Xu et al. had used the hydrothermal route in their synthesis work, we had turned to the solvent thermal method for a more precise control over the nanoparticle's size, shape distribution and crystallinity, all of which could have affected the particle's efficiency in producing upconversion luminescence at a given wavelength. Hypocrellin A is another candidate photosensitizer that has an excellent absorption in the UV and 467 nm blue light regions,90 and exhibits a high 1O2 quantum yield (0.84).91 Jin et al. have utilized the 450 to 475 nm blue emission of their NaYbF4:Tm,Gd@NaGdF4 UCNs for activation of the loaded hypocrellin A.46 Recently, fullerenes formed yet another class of photosensitizer that was used in conjunction with Yb3+–Tm3+ doped UCNs.41,50 Fullerenes possessed a high 1O2 quantum yield and broad absorption spectra extending from the UV to visible range92 that overlaps with many of the upconversion luminescence multi-peaks of UCNs. Wang et al. reported overlapping of their NaYF4:Yb(20%),Tm(1%),Gd(30%) upconversion emission peaks at ∼475, 650 and 700 nm when coupled to hyaluronated fullerene (HAC60)50 while Liu et al. observed overlapping of their NaYF4:Yb(20%),Er(2%)@NaYF4:Yb(20%),Tm(0.3%) core–shell upconversion emission peaks at ∼450, 475, 540, 650 nm when coupled to monomalonic fullerene (C60MA).41 Although several studies have been reported for UCN-based PDT, only a few of them use clinically approved photosensitizers. The use of clinically approved photosensitizers will fasten the approval process of UCN-based nano-constructs for PDT significantly.
2.1.3.2 Photosensitizer loading strategy. 
Once selection of the photosensitizer has been made, the next step would be to craft a loading strategy that ensures optimal loading of the photosensitizer onto the UCN nanoplatform. Of noteworthy to mention here is the importance in choosing an approach that meets most, if not all, of the following criteria: (1) high photosensitizer loading capacity; (2) close proximity of the loaded photosensitizer to the upconversion phosphor core for an efficient energy transfer; (3) zero or minimal leakage of the loaded photosensitizer; (4) the loaded photosensitizer is trapped in a matrix that allows oxygen and ROS to diffuse in and out freely. To date, three strategies have been commonly employed in loading photosensitizer molecules onto the UCN nanoplatform, namely physical encapsulation, physical adsorption and covalent conjugation (Table 1).
The method of physically encapsulating a photosensitizer molecule within a dense silica network has been employed since the first study on using UCNs for PDT application.22,33 Photosensitizer molecules were simultaneously absorbed into the silica network as the latter gets deposited (through hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate) onto the UCN core to form a layer of silica coating. The strategy offers a tunable loading capacity by controlling the amount of photosensitizers added into the reaction mixture as well as thickness of the silica layer deposited on the UCNs. Too thick a silica layer however, should be avoided for it impedes the energy transfer efficiency from the donor core to the acceptor photosensitizer trapped in the silica matrix. Owing to the negatively charged hydrophilic nature of the silica matrix, it is generally more apt for trapping cationic, hydrophilic photosensitizers. It is thus not surprising that silica encapsulation of an anionic, lipophilic MC540 photosensitizer achieved a loading capacity of only 0.46 wt%.22 On the contrary, strong electrostatic interaction between the silica matrix and water-soluble, cationic MB has been reported to show a high loading level of 0.05 mmol MB/UCN besides also boasting a zero MB leakage when the UCN–MB composite was immersed in water, ethanol or even non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane.34 Trapping photosensitizers within a dense silica matrix, however, faces the argument on whether oxygen and ROS molecules can freely diffuse in and out of it, although there has been evidence on the existence of tiny pores even within a “dense” silica network that allows for the diffusion of small molecules like water and oxygen.61
The most common method of photosensitizer loading, however, goes to physical adsorption, whose popularity is believed to be based upon its simple and straightforward approach to load photosensitizers. Having been capped with hydrophobic ligands such as oleic acid, the bare UCN core usually possesses a hydrophobic surface. In transferring this hydrophobic core into the aqueous phase, coating with polymers such as PEG, PEG-diacrylate hydrogel, PEI, α-cyclodextrin and Tween-20 would typically create a thin hydrophobic layer sandwiched between the core surface and the underside of the coating, to which tight adsorption of hydrophobic photosensitizers can occur through hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions. The loading technique offers the benefit of placing the photosensitizer in close proximity to the UCN core for effective energy transfer from the core to the photosensitizer, with the hydrophobic layer of <5 nm in thickness having been reported.28 Loading of photosensitizers by physical adsorption into such a hydrophobic layer had shown varying levels of loading capacity, ranging from a meager 0.0065 wt% to a high 12.3 wt% level.23,24,27,28,30,38,39,43,46 It is assumed here that loading increases with the degree of hydrophobicity of the loaded photosensitizer and hydrophobic layer. Indeed, a comparison study between Ce6, ZnPc and MB physically adsorbed into α-cyclodextrin-coated UCN revealed a high loading capacity of 9.43 wt% and 9.54 wt%, respectively, for the highly hydrophobic Ce6 and ZnPc photosensitizers while that attained by the water-soluble MB was almost halved at 4.13 wt%.43 The physical adsorption method, however, faces the risk of poor stability of the attached photosensitizers due to the relatively weak hydrophobic forces that holds the adsorbed photosensitizers to the nanoconstruct. There is thus a concern that the loaded photosensitizers could be prematurely released from the UCNs, particularly if systemically administered into the blood circulation. Data from in vitro release study however are rather encouraging, demonstrating slow release of the photosensitizers Ce6, ZnPc, MB and hypocrellin A from the UCN nanoconstruct and reporting a leakage of only <10 to 15% after 48 h incubation in PBS.43,46
The method of physical adsorption has also been employed for entrapping photosensitizers within the mesopores of silica (Fig. 4). Instead of having dense silica to coat the UCN surface, the silica layer can be made porous so that photosensitizers can be incorporated into the pores through physical adsorption. The pore size is tunable between 2 and 50 nm for flexibility in hosting differently sized photosensitizer molecules and the large surface area (e.g. ∼770 m2 g−1)25 enables a high payload of the drug cargo. In the context of PDT, the porous matrix is favored over dense silica due to its presumably better permeability to ROS molecules and thus more efficient release out of the silica layer. In principle, the mesoporous-silica coated UCNs are also recyclable as the adsorbed photosensitizers could be removed from the mesopores when soaked in ethanol.25 In aqueous solutions such as water, PBS or cell culture medium, however, the loaded hydrophobic photosensitizers are stably adsorbed into the mesopores, with no obvious release of photosensitizers being detected in the supernatant of soaked particles.25,37 As in dense silica coating, the thickness of the mesoporous silica shell should be carefully controlled as it may hinder the efficient energy transfer between the UCN core and the entrapped photosensitizer. Furthermore, the method of physically adsorbing photosensitizers within the mesoporous silica is again more suited to cationic, hydrophilic photosensitizers owing to the negatively charged hydrophilic nature of silica. This could thus account for the low loading that we observed with hydrophobic photosensitizers ZnPc and MC540 in the silica mesopores (<0.5 wt% loading capacity).25,26,37 Choosing hydrophilic photosensitizers over hydrophobic ones, however, comes with the caveat of leakage of the drugs out of the uncapped pores when exposed to an aqueous environment in the body. Unless additional efforts are made to improve the poor retention of these hydrophilic drugs within the mesopores by strong covalent bonds or capping the pores with a material that will keep the drugs inside but still allow for diffusion of oxygen and ROS freely, this may again prove to be a weak link in the loading strategy.

In another variation of the loading strategy utilizing hydrophobic interaction, chitosan was used to encapsulate photosensitizers for UCN–PDT studies.29,40 Cui et al. loaded ZnPc into their chitosan-coated UCNs through hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic photosensitizer and the inward facing hydrophobic arm of the amphiphilic chitosan, thereby effectively entrapping the photosensitizer within the nanoconstruct. The strategy produced a tunable ZnPc loading capacity that saturates at ∼10.8 wt%. It should be cautioned here that the higher loading capacity need not necessarily translate to a better therapeutic outcome as there exist an optimal ZnPc loading concentration (determined to be about half of the saturated value in this case). The authors reasoned out that ZnPc present in excess of the optimal amount may aggregate while being entrapped in the nanoconstruct that is exposed to aqueous-based media, thereby diminishing their photosensitizing ability due to triplet–triplet annihilation and self-quenching.40 The hydrophobic force entrapping the ZnPc is, nonetheless, mildly susceptible to pH changes, showing an acceptable <20% leakage of ZnPc from the nanoconstruct within 50 h of incubation in an acidic solution of pH 5.7.40
In another work utilizing the strategy of physical encapsulation through hydrophobic interaction, Wang et al. encapsulated both their photosensitizer ZnPc and UCN within a lipid micelle.45 The lipid micelle, consisting of amphiphilic polymers, trapped the lipophilic ZnPc within the hydrophobic layers existing between the UCN and the polymeric lipids. The strategy also offers a tunable loading capacity that showed increased in the loading level with an increasing amount of ZnPc added. The release profile of the photosensitizer, however, revealed a 25 to 50% leakage of the drug just after 6 h.
Another loading strategy that has been employed in UCN–PDT studies is physical adsorption via electrostatic attraction.42,44,48 Wang et al. recruited a layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly approach to load multiple layers of the Ce6-conjugated polymer onto UCNs (Fig. 5).44 The negatively charged Ce6-conjugated polymer was bound to positively charged PAA–poly(allylamine hydrochloride)(PAH) coated on the UCN via electrostatic attraction and the process was repeated to yield up to three coats of the Ce6 layer. The strategy resulted in a high Ce6 loading capacity of 3.4 wt%, 7.7 wt% and 11.0 wt% for one-, two- and three-layered Ce6–UCN composites, respectively. The loaded photosensitizer was also found to be tightly coupled to the nanoplatform as there was barely any Ce6 leakage into PBS or fetal bovine serum even after 48 h of soaking. The two-layered-Ce6-loaded UCN was found most optimal as a PDT agent, yielding the highest 1O2 generation as compared to one- or three-layered-Ce6–UCN composites. In another unique approach utilizing electrostatic attraction, Yuan et al. loaded the TMPyP4 photosensitizer into the G-quadruplex DNA structure of an aptamer that has been pre-conjugated to their UCNs.48 The cationic photosensitizer intercalates with the aptamer via π–π interactions with the G-quartets as well as through electrostatic attraction with the anionic phosphate groups of the G-quadruplex. By having the aptamer conjugated to the UCN, the photosensitizer intercalating it is placed in close proximity to the UCN for efficient energy transfer between the UCN and the photosensitizer.

Since it is not necessary for the loaded photosensitizer to be released out of the nanoplatform in order to exert a therapeutic effect, covalent conjugation may offer a solution that can enhance its retention to the nanoplatform, altogether overcoming the leakage problem faced with non-covalent interactions such as physical adsorption. Covalent linkage has been popularly engaged to cross-link photosensitizers either onto the surface of UCNs,31,34,38,41,49,50 inside the silica coating of the UCN32 or even inside the mesoporous channels of silica coating of the UCNs.35 The covalently conjugated photosensitizers were found to be stable against leaching with no free photosensitizers being detected in PBS, cell culture medium or water of different pH that have been soaked with the photosensitizer-loaded UCNs.32,34 The loading technique also offers the benefit of placing the photosensitizer in close proximity to the UCN core for effective energy transfer from the core to the photosensitizer, especially when zero-length crosslinkers such as carbodiimide crosslinking reagents (DCC and EDC) are used in the conjugation. In fact, Liu et al. reported a high energy transfer efficiency of more than 80% from their covalently grafted Rose Bengal–UCN composite.31 In an interesting head-to-head comparison between ZnPc that were covalently conjugated and those that were physically adsorbed to UCNs, Xia et al. found a high loading level that can reach 10 wt% with the covalent conjugation strategy while that of physically adsorbed ones could only reach a maximum of 1.5 wt% loading capacity.49 To achieve a heightened loading capacity, Park et al. used a combination of covalent conjugation and physical adsorption strategies to maximally load Ce6 photosensitizers onto their PEG-phospholipids-coated UCNs.38 By virtue of its hydrophobicity, Ce6 can be readily adsorbed into the hydrophobic phospholipid layers surrounding the UCN while its carboxylic group is available for amide bonding with the amine-functionalized UCN. The combined loading strategy achieved a high loading level of more than 1000 Ce6 per UCN. On the down-side though, the method of covalent conjugation requires the need for structural modification of the photosensitizer to be loaded. This runs the risk of impairing their photosensitizing ability, although most studies have shown that the covalently linked photosensitizers were able to retain their functional properties.

2.2 Upconversion-based PDT studies in cells and animals
Having dissected the UCN-based PDT drug into its different components, this section will now look into its chronological development as an in vitro and in vivo PDT agent when collectively assembled into an integrated entity (Table 1).
In 2007, Zhang et al. proved, for the first time, the concept of upconversion-based PDT.22 In this pioneering work, silica-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs loaded with the MC540 photosensitizer actively targeted MCF-7/AZ human breast cancer cells via a MUC1/episialin antibody moiety that was conjugated on its surface. Photodynamic cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was demonstrated qualitatively in vitro by irradiating the targeted cells with a 974 nm light for 36 to 43 min. Following this, Chatterjee et al. performed a more quantitative in vitro photodynamic assessment of the concept with their PEI-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs.23 Now conjugated to FA as a targeting moiety and loaded with a second generation photosensitizer, ZnPc, that exhibits considerably higher 1O2 quantum yield and molar absorption coefficient than previously used MC540, the nanoparticles showed active targeting to HT29 human colon cancer cells and achieved ∼50% cell kill with 733 μg mL−1 of the UCNs and 5 min of 980 nm irradiation. The low ZnPc loading capacity (0.0065 wt%) and toxicity of the PEI coating spurred Qian et al. to come up with the mesoporous silica-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er UCN design.25 With this, an improved loading capacity of the ZnPc within the mesoporous silica layer was attained at 0.1 wt% and a lower effective dose of ∼25 to 50 μg mL−1 of the UCNs was needed to achieve 50% cell kill in MB49-PSA modified murine bladder cancer cells exposed to 5 min of 980 nm irradiation. Using the same particles, Guo et al. furthered the work by studying the mechanism behind the photodynamic destruction at the sub-cellular level.26 They found that the nanoparticles were ingested into the cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. Upon irradiation with a 980 nm laser, oxidative damage by the generated 1O2 resulted in a change in the nuclear morphology as well as loss of DNA and mitochondrial membrane integrity. This was evident from the observed chromatin condensation seen inside the nucleus, DNA fragmentation from the nuclear extract and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, all of which are indicative of the involvement of apoptosis in triggering the cell death.
An attempt to improve on the photosensitizer loading capacity, dispersity and dark toxicity of the UCN–photosensitizer nanoconstruct was made by Shan and colleagues.27 Using a Flash NanoPrecipitation route, they achieved an elevated 10 wt% loading of the TPP photosensitizer onto NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs stabilized with a PEG-b-PLA block copolymer coating. The resultant particles displayed a low toxicity in the dark but exerted a destructive effect on HeLa human cervical cancer cells upon exposure to 978 nm light. However, with an extremely low dose of 0.00025 μg mL−1 of the particles used, a corresponding enormous amount of 980 nm light irradiated at 39 W cm−2 for 30 min was needed to kill ∼50% of the cells. In the same year, the first demonstration of upconversion-based PDT in experimental animals was reported by Wang and team.28 The group loaded a good 8 wt% of Ce6 photosensitizer onto their NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs coated with a C18PMH-PEG stabilizing layer. At half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ∼400 μg mL−1, the UCN–Ce6 complex induced in vitro death of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells irradiated for 10 min with a 980 nm light at a dose of 0.5 W cm−2. In vivo, injection of 43 mg kg−1 of the nanocomplex directly into 4T1 murine breast tumor grown subcutaneously on Balb/c mice revealed an obvious retardation in the growth of the tumor that was exposed for 30 min to 980 nm light at the same fluence rate of 0.5 W cm−2. No such tumor growth retardation was observed in animals that were not exposed to the NIR light or those that did not receive injection of the nanoparticles but merely exposed to the laser irradiation. A remarkably longer survival time was also documented in the UCN–PDT treated animals as compared to their control counterpart. The team was also the first to demonstrate the depth of achievable tissue penetration for activation of their NIR-PDT technology as compared to conventional red light-PDT system. Pork tissues with thicknesses of 3 mm and 8 mm were placed between laser sources (980 nm or 660 nm) and samples (UCN–Ce6 complex or free Ce6 photosensitizers). A comparison of the amount of 1O2 that can be produced from the activated samples upon irradiation with either a 980 nm (for UCN–Ce6 complex) or the conventional 660 nm (for free Ce6 photosensitizers) light blocked by the pork tissues revealed a markedly higher level of 1O2 generated from irradiation with the 980 nm light. This was similarly observed in their cell viability assays. The study was also extended to an in vivo study in which the subcutaneously grown tumors on mice were blocked by the 8 mm thick pork tissue during PDT treatment. While no appreciable delay in tumor progression was observed from the free Ce6 photosensitizers + 660 nm laser-treated group, the UCN–Ce6 complex + 980 nm laser-treated mice showed a significantly reduced tumor growth rate.
Ensuing Wang's et al.28 first demonstration of the in vivo efficacy of upconversion-based PDT modality, Cui and colleagues validated the work using a chitosan-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er UCN loaded with a high 10.8 wt% of the photosensitizer ZnPc.29 Significant inhibition of the tumor growth rate was also observed in this work using a similar experimental setup of a subcutaneous tumor bearing mice model receiving intratumoral injection of the UCN formulation, but this time at a lower UCN concentration and light dose of 33 mg kg−1 and 0.4 W cm−2 for 15 min (with the irradiation repeated twice at 3 and 24 h post-injection), respectively. It was also discovered that the nanoparticles remained localized within the tumor tissue, with no trace of translocation to other major organs of the body being detected in the 14 days following injection. Shortly after, report on the photodynamic potential of the UCN-based PDT drug was also extended to antiviral therapy application. Lim et al. demonstrated photodynamic inactivation of the dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) virus in suspension, a virus-infected cellular system as well as a murine model, with their ZnPc-loaded PEI-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs.30 A relatively high NIR light dose of 23.5 W cm−2 for 5 to 10 min, however, was required for significant inactivation of the virus.
An attempt to improve the drug's photodynamic efficacy through improved photosensitizer loading level-cum-zero photosensitizer leakage was made using UCNs that were covalently conjugated to their photosensitizer moieties, as opposed to previous PDT studies that utilized physical encapsulation or adsorption as a means of photosensitizer loading. Liu et al. reported specific killing of JAR human choriocarcinoma cells expressing FR with their FA-PEG-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er UCN covalently linked to the photosensitizer Rose Bengal.31 With a loading capacity of hundred photosensitizer molecules conjugated per nanoparticle, a reasonable UCN dose of 100 μg mL−1 was used to achieve ∼50% cell kill upon exposure to 1.5 W cm−2 of 980 nm light for 10 min. The light dose used was below the 2 W cm−2 limit that was found to cause thermal killing of the cells due to localized heating from the 980 nm irradiation. On the contrary, this was not observed in non-cancerous NIH 3T3 cells that are negative for FR expression, thus demonstrating the specificity of the developed UCN-based PDT drug for targeted cancer therapy. The study was corroborated by Zhao et al. who also used covalently conjugated photosensitizer AlC4Pc inside the silica-coating of their NaGdF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4 UCN.32 Despite showing a rather low AlC4Pc loading level of 3.3 wt%, the UCN–photosensitizer conjugate achieved a similar extent of ∼50% death on MEAR murine liver cancer cells treated with the same concentration of 100 μg mL−1 of the UCN but with lower exposure of 0.5 W cm−2 of 980 nm light for 5 min. A similar result was also reported by Zhou and colleagues who covalently conjugated the photosensitizer pyropheophorbide a onto a RGD peptide-modified, chitosan-wrapped NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs for PDT treatment of U87-MG human glioblastoma cancer cells.34 Notwithstanding the fact that only 0.53 wt% of photosensitizer was loaded onto the UCN platform, an appreciable ∼50% of the cells were eradicated after treatment with a UCN dose of 100 μg mL−1 and a 980 nm laser exposure of 0.5 W cm−2 for 7.5 min. As opposed to covalently attaching photosensitizer molecules onto the surface of the UCN construct, a commendable effort by Qiao et al. to increase their loading capacity was attempted by covalently attaching the photosensitizer silicon phthalocyanine dihydroxide inside the porous channels of mesoporous silica-coated NaGdF4:Yb,Er@CaF2 UCNs.35 Although the weight percentage of the loaded photosensitizer was not clearly reported, the study showed that ∼50% of HeLa human cervical cancer cells succumb to treatment with ∼80 μM of the UCN–photosensitizer conjugate under a 980 nm light exposure of 2.5 W cm−2 for 10 min.
In a unique approach using the semiconductor material TiO2 as an unconventional photosensitizer, Xu et al. fabricated the nanocomposite TiO2–NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCN for specific cancer cell ablation.36 Targeting of the nanocomposite to A-5RT3 human squamous cell carcinoma was conferred by conjugating it to the antibody cAngptl4. The antibody-conjugated TiO2–UCN nanocomposite exerted its destructive photocatalytic activity specifically towards the targeted A-5RT3 cells but not its HaCaT non-tumorigenic cell counterpart. The potency of the antibody-conjugated TiO2–UCN nanocomposite was remarkable as reflected from the minute amount of 0.25 μg mL−1 of the drug used to achieve significant ablation of the targeted cancer cells under an appreciably mild NIR light exposure of 0.2 W cm−2 for 2 min. Although the mechanism behind this powerful destruction remained to be elucidated, the hydroxyl radicals produced from the nanoplatform is anticipated to initiate a different cell death pathway from that of 1O2 generated in conventional UCN–photosensitizer-mediated PDT.
Following previous in vivo studies employing intratumoral injection as their route of administration, reports on systemic administration of the UCN-based PDT drug have also ensued for clinical relevance. Unlike direct injection into tumor tissues, this route involves circulating the nanoparticles in the bloodstream before they could reach the desired tumor site. It thus becomes incumbent to surface modify them with stabilizers and targeting moieties such as PEG, chitosan and FA in order to enhance their circulatory lifetime as well as assist their targeting for a higher chance of accumulation at the tumor site. Our team reported on the use of FA-PEG-modified mesoporous silica-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs, loaded with two photosensitizers, MC540 and ZnPc, to kill B16-F0 melanoma in mice intravenously injected with the nanocomplex (Fig. 6).37 We found that the UCNs were efficient nanotransducers, utilizing a single 980 nm NIR wavelength to activate both photosensitizers (through their multiple visible emissions) and that the use of two photosensitizers in unison was more effective than using a single one. This was the first demonstration of UCN-mediated PDT using simultaneous activation of two photosensitizers. Admittedly, though, the low photosensitizer loading of <0.6 wt% had compelled us to use a high dose of 1500 μg mL−1 of the UCNs with a long exposure time of 40 min of the 980 nm light at 2.5 W cm−2 to effectively eradicate B16-F0 cells in vitro. In vivo, a 50 mg kg−1 UCN dose and a long exposure time of 60 to 120 min of the 980 nm light at 0.415 W cm−2 was also required for effective PDT treatment. Park et al. had also reported on systemic administration of their Ce6-loaded, PEG-phospholipids-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4 UCNs into mice bearing subcutaneous U87-MG human glioblastoma.38 By utilizing both physical adsorption and covalent conjugation to maximally load photosensitizers, they were able to achieve a high loading level of 1000 Ce6 molecules per UCN that could possibly enabled the UCN–Ce6 PDT regimen to be conducted at a low therapeutic dose of merely 5 mg kg−1 of the UCN with only 5 min of exposure to 0.6 W cm−2 of 980 nm light for effective inhibition of the tumor growth. It was also interesting that the Ce6-loaded nanoconstruct accumulated more in the tumors as compared to its unloaded counterpart, although both nanoparticles were not decorated with any tumor targeting agent to confer it an active targeting ability to the tumor site. As mentioned previously, this could be due to the lipophilic nature of Ce6 that facilitates the intracellular uptake of UCN–Ce6 nanocomposites across the lipid membranes as well as their better colloidal stability over unloaded UCNs. Yet another study that performed systemic administration of their UCN-based PDT drug was reported by Cui et al.40 The group used a FA-modified chitosan to coat their NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs and loaded a high 10 wt% of ZnPc photosensitizer for intravenous injection into mice bearing subcutaneous murine S180 sarcoma. A reasonable therapeutic dose of 50 mg kg−1 of the UCNs exposed to 980 nm light at 0.2 W cm−2 for 30 min was sufficient to inhibit tumor growth. The work was also extended to study the depth of tissue penetration for activation of the UCN nanocomplex, wherein a 1 cm pork tissue placed over the subcutaneous tumor during PDT treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in mice exposed to the 980 nm light as compared to those treated with direct 660 nm light.

Liu et al. took advantage of the multicolored upconversion luminescence of their NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNs to photoactivate the photosensitizer monomalonic fullerene that exhibits broad absorption spectra. A high 10.5 wt% of the fullerene was covalently conjugated to the PEG-succinimidyl carbonate-coated UCNs. However, a slightly high IC50 dosage of the resultant nanocomplex at ∼500 μg mL−1 was required for significant decline in the viability of HeLa human cervical cancer cells irradiated with a 1.37 W cm−2 of 980 nm light for 10 min.41 One of the mildest UCN–PDT treatment conditions ever utilized were reported by Zeng et al.42 They loaded the photosensitizer AlPcS4 onto PEG-coated Fe3O4@NaYF4:Yb,Er UCN and found that only 75 μg mL−1 of the UCN construct at a very low 980 nm light dose of 0.02 W cm−2 for 3 min was enough to kill ∼50% of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Tian et al. conducted an interesting comparative study between three differentially-loaded NaYF4:Yb,Er,Mn UCNs functionalized with α-cyclodextrin.43 Ce6, ZnPc, or MB photosensitizers were each physically adsorbed onto the nanoplatform at different loading levels of 9.43 wt% (Ce6), 9.54 wt% (ZnPc) and 4.13 wt% (MB). After incubating 100 μg mL−1 of the respective UCNs with A-549 human epithelial lung cancer cells, their exposure to 1 W cm−2 of 980 nm light for 5 min resulted in ∼50% cell kill. The extent of cell death appears in the order of Ce6 > ZnPc > MB, presumably due to differences in the photosensitizer loading level.
Wang and co-workers further contributed towards structural improvement of the UCN-based PDT drug by developing a smart material that can be controlled environmentally.44 They employed an elaborate LbL self-assembly process to coat multiple layers of the pH-sensitive polymer and the Ce6 photosensitizer onto their NaY(Mn)F4:Yb,Er UCNs. The outer polymer coating displays a charge-reversible behavior that is susceptible to pH changes of its environment. As the surface charge of the particles switches between negative charge under neutral/alkaline conditions and positive charge in a slightly acidic environment, this facilitates their binding to the negatively charged cell membrane, altogether improving their intracellular uptake in acidic milieu. Indeed, an elevated amount of the nanoconstruct was found in HeLa human cervical cancer cells cultured with ∼100 μg mL−1 of the nanoparticles in acidic pH 6.8 as compared to those at neutral pH 7.4. Upon exposure of the cells to 0.5 W cm−2 of 980 nm light for 10 min, a corresponding increase in their death percentage was also observed under acidic culture conditions as compared to the ones under neutral culture conditions. More importantly, intratumoral injection of the nanoconstruct into the acidic tumor microenvironment of a 4T1 murine breast cancer showed an enhanced retention inside the tumor tissues and a corresponding heightened response in tumor growth inhibition upon exposure to 30 min of 0.5 W cm−2 980 nm light (as compared to those particles that were not coated with the pH-responsive polymer). Remarkably, only 20 mg kg−1 of the UCN complex was needed, the lowest dose ever reported in in vivo UCN-based PDT.
In recent times, efforts to make UV/blue light-activated photosensitizers more clinically relevant were also attempted. Unlike other widely used photosensitizers that can be activated by red and sometimes green light, photosensitizers that respond only to light of short wavelength such as UV and blue light are usually disregarded for clinical use, especially in the treatment of solid tumors that are normally at a thickness impenetrable by the UV/blue light. Considering that many of these photosensitizers possess a promising photodynamic potential based on their relatively high 1O2 quantum yield, overcoming their tissue penetration depth limit using a NIR-to-UV/blue light UCN transducer would be a commendable step forward. One of the earliest few attempts was made by Jin et al. who used the blue light-activated photosensitizer hypocrellin A to load onto their Tween-20-coated NaYbF4:Tm,Gd@NaGdF4 UCNs.46 A reasonable 5.47 wt% of hypocrellin A was physically adsorbed onto the UCN construct and the resultant nanocomplex exhibited a strong photodynamic activity against A-549 human epithelial lung cancer cells at a low UCN dose of 25 to 50 μg mL−1 with just 5 min of exposure to 0.8 W cm−2 of 980 nm light. Another photosensitizer that was successfully activated by blue upconversion light was TMPyP4. The TMPyP4 was intercalated with targeting moieties G4-aptamers that were in turn attached to the surface of PEI-coated NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Er UCNs.48 Yuan et al. demonstrated their PDT efficacy in CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemic cells using a reasonable amount of 100 μg mL−1 of the UCN complex and an irradiation dose of 0.5 W cm−2 of 980 nm light for 10 min. Yet another study utilizing blue upconversion light activation was reported by Shimoyama et al.47 Interestingly, ALA, the precursor to photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) was not incorporated into their NaYF4:Yb,Er,Gd UCN platform but separately added into MKN45 human gastric cancer cell culture instead. A UCN concentration of 250 μg mL−1 and a very high power density of 3.42 W cm−2 of 975 nm light shone for 16 min was required to achieve ∼50% cell kill.
Motivated by concerns on the use of NIR laser power that were mostly too high and too long for exciting previously-reported UCN-based PDT drugs, Xia et al. made a commendable attempt to improve the energy transfer efficiency between their core NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs and loaded ZnPc photosensitizer via a two-pronged strategy: (1) enhancement in the red upconversion emission of their UCN core (needed for activation of ZnPc) through deliberate increase in Yb3+ ions doped; (2) shortening the distance between the photosensitizer and the UCN core by covalent linkage using zero-length carbodiimide crosslinkers.49 With a stronger red upconversion light emitted and a more closely bound photosensitizer, the energy transfer efficiency between the UCN core and the loaded photosensitizer is anticipated to improve to yield a high amount of 1O2 production, thereby allowing the use of low NIR light dosage (Fig. 7). HeLa human cervical cancer cells incubated with 100 to 200 μg mL−1 of the ZnPc-loaded, FA-PEG-modified NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs required exposure to 980 nm light at a dose of only 0.39 W cm−2 for 10 min. More remarkably, intratumoral injection of the nanoparticles at a dose of 50 mg kg−1 into C57/6J mice bearing subcutaneous murine Hepa1-6 hepatocellular carcinoma revealed significant tumor growth inhibition with the same 980 nm light dose of 0.39 W cm−2 and an irradiation time of 15 min.

In one of the most recent efforts to improve the therapeutic efficacy of UCN-based PDT drug, Wang et al. incorporated a dual-targeting strategy in their UCN-based PDT nanoplatform to achieve improved tumor-targeted PDT efficiency.50 Two targeting ligands, APBA and HA, were decorated on the surface of NaYF4:Yb,Tm,Gd UCNs loaded with the photosensitizer hyaluronated fullerene to confer specificity towards two different targets overexpressed on PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cancer cells. The nanocomplex harboring dual-targeting ligands showed a superior tumor-targeting capability as compared to those harboring only a single-targeting ligand. A higher intracellular uptake and consequently better PDT efficacy was observed when the cells were treated with 100 μg mL−1 of the dual-targeting nanocomplex followed by exposure to 0.5 W cm−2 of 980 nm light for 15 min. Another very recent effort towards the progressive development of UCN-based PDT drug was contributed by Chen et al., who reported fabrication of a multifunctional UCN based platform that can be used for simultaneous PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT) using NIR.51 It involves the use of BSA–PAA-coated NaGdF4:Yb,Er UCNs, that is highly soluble in aqueous solvents to deliver the photosensitizer Rose Bengal and an NIR-absorbing dye, IR825, which can be used for PDT and PTT respectively (Fig. 8). They demonstrated this system in 4T1 breast tumor-bearing nude mice with a low 20 mg kg−1 UCN dosage injected intratumorally and a 980 nm light exposure of 0.4 W cm−2 for 30 min.

3. Upconversion nanoparticles for photochemistry applications
Initially, studies were focused mostly on using the visible emission of UCNs for photoactivation of photosensitizers for PDT applications. However around 2010, researchers started focusing on utilizing the UV emission of UCNs for photoactivation of different molecules to overcome the problems associated with UV light based photoactivation. Typically UV-A light with wavelength around 350 nm is used for these applications. Even though UV-A is considered safe in comparison to UV-B and UV-C, it is still correlated with production of free radicals, damage to skin and development of skin cancer. Also the penetration depth of UV is very low, which prevents such UV-based photoactivation systems to be used for biological applications. So the majority of the studies published so far on UV based photoactivation have been restricted to in vitro systems. So the potential of UCNs to be used as a NIR-to-UV nanotransducer was exploited for several photochemistry applications. It can be argued that the UCNs still produce harmful UV light upon excitation with NIR light, but several studies have shown that the toxicity of such upconverted UV is very minimal. This could be due to the mild and localized upconverted UV produced by the UCNs in comparison to conventional UV irradiation. The doping of Yb along with Tm in UCNs gives rise to emission in the UV-blue range and this combination was used with various host lattices for different applications. Various photochemical reactions have been performed with the help of UCNs and they can broadly be classified into two classes namely, photoactivation of caged molecules and photo-triggered release of molecules depending upon the end application.
3.1. Photoactivation of caged molecules
The basic principle of photocaging involves the temporary inactivation of a molecule (plasmid/siRNA/drug etc.) through covalent linkage with a photolabile group.2 This works by blocking key functional groups (carboxyl groups, amino groups, phosphate moieties, hydroxyl groups etc.) using photolabile molecules and hinders their activity. Upon irradiation with light of a suitable wavelength (usually UV), this photolabile group gets released, thereby rendering the molecule active again. In this manner, photocaging allows us to achieve site-specific activation of molecules to obtain the desired effect at a precise time and site.93 Several chemical molecules like drugs, fluorescent dyes and biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids have been photocaged and then photoactivated using UCNs in in vitro as well as in vivo systems.

3.1.1 Caged chemicals. 
Initially, Carling et al. designed experiments to show the possibility of using UCNs for NIR light triggered uncaging. 3′,5′-Di(carboxymethoxy) benzoin cage was used as a model photocaged molecule, which releases carboxylic acid upon UV irradiation.94 They used NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4 UCNs and loaded it with 3′,5′-di(carboxymethoxy) benzoin acetate through physical adsorption. The photocaged molecule underwent uncaging when irradiated with a continuous wave (CW) 980 nm NIR laser for 35 min (Power = 4.37 W and Power density = 556 W cm−2) and induced uncaging similar to that of direct UV irradiation. This proof-of-concept study aroused much interest in this area and was then rapidly followed upon by several other studies.
Garcia et al. used NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4 core–shell UCNs and utilized the visible emission of these UCNs for photoactivating caged nitric oxide which has potential applications in cancer therapy.95 Core–shell NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4 UCNs were coated with a layer of silica for making them hydrophilic as well as for ease of surface modification. Roussin's black salt anion Fe4S3(NO)7− (RBS) was used as the nitric oxide precursor. Nitric oxide was produced when the nanoparticle–RBS solution was irradiated with a CW NIR laser (1 W). Aside from this, the UCNs were also coated with a layer of mesoporous silica and RBS was encapsulated into the pores before photoactivation.
Zhao et al. reported the photoactivation of caged chlorambucil (anti-cancer drug) for cancer therapy.96 They formulated novel yolk–shell nanoparticles, where the core was composed of NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaLuF4 UCNs and the shell was composed of silica as shown in Fig. 9. They were able to successfully encapsulate one UCN in one shell and the UCN core was movable. Photocaged chlorambucil was physically adsorbed into these nanoparticles and the upconverted UV emission uncaged the drug to make it active. The antitumor activity of these core–shell nanoparticles was tested in vitro in KB cells and in vivo in Kunming mice subcutaneously injected with S180 tumor mass. There was a significant decrease in the viability of cells and tumor size in the group treated with the core–shell nanoparticles and irradiated with a NIR laser, whereas the core–shell nanoparticle treated group without NIR irradiation did not show any response and was similar to the control. The power density of the NIR laser used in this study was very moderate and still provided good photo-triggered release of the drug (570 mW cm−2in vitro and 50 mW cm−2in vivo).

UCNs were also used for multimodality imaging in conjunction with photoactivation of anticancer drugs.97 Dai et al. synthesized NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaGdF4 and modified it with a light-activated prodrug DPP (trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N3)2-(NH3)(py)(O2CCH2CH2COOH)2]). They were further modified with PEG to improve circulation and reduce the immunogenicity of the nanoparticles. The upconverted UV from UCNs activated DPP as efficiently as direct UV irradiation and up to 48% of the drug was activated in solution with 30 min of irradiation. It was calculated that a single nanoparticle releases up to 3000 molecules of DPP with 1 h of NIR irradiation. In vitro toxicity assessment of the activated drug was analyzed in HeLa cells. The cells pre-incubated with UCNs and photoactivated using a NIR laser for 40 min (4.5 W cm−2, 5 min break after every 5 min irradiation) showed good reduction in cell viability. However direct irradiation with a NIR laser alone up to 1 h did not cause any significant change in cell viability. Further, these UCNs were also tested on H22 xenografts in nude mice, where treatment with UCNs in combination with NIR laser showed excellent tumor inhibition. Apart from using it as a photoactivating transducer, these UCNs were also used for multimodal imaging. The 800 nm NIR emission from these UCNs were used for photoluminescence imaging whereas the Gd ions doped in the UCNs were used for MRI and Yb and Gd ions in the UCNs for computed tomography imaging. In another study, Min et al. developed multifunctional UCNs for photoactivation of a platinum prodrug and also for sensing of apoptosis.98 UCNs were coated with a layer of silica and then modified with PEG, DPP and an apoptosis sensing peptide. The peptide has a FRET pair which consists of a NIR dye–Cy5 and its quencher Qsy21 conjugated to it. When the peptide comes in contact with caspase (a key enzyme responsible for apoptosis), the peptide is cleaved, which results in the regaining of Cy5 fluorescence. The platinum prodrug was highly stable even with conjugation to UCNs and they caused excellent cytotoxicity in both cisplatin-susceptible and cisplatin-resistant A2780 cells when they were irradiated with a NIR laser for 1 h (1.5 W cm−2). Live cell imaging and flow cytometry was also performed to monitor the extent of apoptosis in these cells.
Studies were also focused on improving the NIR-to-UV upconverted emission for photoactivation applications as higher luminescence intensity could lead to reduced duration of NIR irradiation and consequently reduce the heating effects. Han et al. synthesized NaYF4:Yb,Tm@CaF2 core–shell UCNs for photoactivation of caged fluorescein.99 These UCNs had a α-NaYF4 crystal structure instead of the commonly used β-NaYF4 and had a biocompatible CaF2 shell which matched highly with the crystal lattice of α-NaYF4. These led to the reduction in surface quenching effects and enabled doping of high concentrations of Yb, which in turn increased the UV emission significantly (9 fold stronger than arguably the best UV upconverter to date: beta-NaYF4 core–shell UCNs). These UCNs were modified with branched PEI and then conjugated with o-nitrobenzyl caged fluorescein and delivered to HeLa cells. The fluorescence from fluorescein upon uncaging was monitored real time using fluorescence microscopy and the photoactivation was completed within 90 seconds when irradiated with a CW 975 nm NIR laser through the objective lens (Power = 11 mW).


3.1.2 Caged biomolecules. 
Yang and colleagues demonstrated the first use of UCNs for uncaging photocaged biomolecules in both in vitro and in vivo systems.100 NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4 core–shell UCNs were modified with thiolated silane molecules and later caged D-luciferin was covalently coupled to them. Uncaging of D-luciferin leads to regaining of its fluorescence and when incubated with the enzyme luciferase, it produces bioluminescence, which could be used for bioimaging. There was a time-dependent uncaging of caged D-luciferin loaded UCNs upon NIR irradiation whereas NIR irradiation on plain caged D-luciferin had no effect. This was further tested in C6 glioma cells and MCF-7 cells in vitro and in nude mice in vivo. Even under in vivo conditions, NIR irradiation for 1 h (Power = 0.8 W, Power density = 255 W cm−2) induced enough uncaging via UCN to visualize the resulting bioluminescence.
Subsequently, Jayakumar et al. reported the use of UCNs for photo-controlled gene expression and knockdown.89 Plasmid and siRNA were photocaged using DMNPE [1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane] to render them non-functional. These photocaged nucleic acids were then loaded onto mesoporous silica-coated NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCN. The UCNs were able to photoactivate the nucleic acids in solution and in cells within 12 min of NIR irradiation (Power density = 2.8 W cm−2). The activated nucleic acids then expressed or knocked down green fluorescent protein (GFP) in B16F0 cells. Further experiments were designed to prove the excellent spatial resolution achieved by UCN-based photoactivation. It was also shown that NIR light had the ability to pass through tissue phantoms of different thickness as well as through tissue in mice model to activate the photocaged nucleic acids.
The same group also recently reported the use of UCNs for the simultaneous photoactivation of two different molecules. Core–shell NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNs were synthesized to obtain emissions in both the UV and visible range.101 The UV emission was used to activate photomorpholinos (morpholinos are short nucleic acid analogs which are highly stable and efficient for gene knockdown, photomorpholinos are light-sensitive morpholinos which become functional upon UV irradiation) whereas the visible emission of the UCNs was used to activate an endosome localizing photosensitizer meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPPS2a) for disruption of the endosomal membrane and enhance cellular uptake as shown in Fig. 10. These UCNs solved several problems associated with gene therapy namely ineffective gene delivery, inability to control gene expression and endosomal degradation using light-based techniques. The core–shell UCNs were co-loaded with anti-STAT-3 photomorpholino and TPPS2a and delivered into B16F0 cells and tumors in the C57BL6/J mice model to enhance endosomal escape and knockdown the expression of STAT-3 concurrently. Irradiation with a NIR laser significantly improved the cellular uptake and knocked down the expression of STAT-3. This subsequently led to efficient tumor reduction in mice. The visible emission of these UCNs was used effectively for in vitro and in vivo imaging.

3.2. Photo-triggered release of molecules
Stimuli-responsive delivery systems are very attractive for delivering payload like drugs and other biomolecules since it allows a good degree of control over the delivery process. This is very essential as it reduces unwanted side effects to a great extent. Various stimuli like pH, redox environment, ultrasound, magnetic field, electric field, heat and light102 have been used. Of all the above, light-sensitive delivery systems are one of the most studied ones, as it offers excellent spatial and temporal control. Various polymeric nanoparticles/scaffolds have been used for this purpose and these polymers are usually based on photo-responsive chemical groups like coumarin, 7-nitroindoline and 2-nitrobenzoyl. Since the majority of these photo-responsive groups respond to UV light, UCNs have been used to mediate the activation of these groups upon NIR excitation. Several studies have shown the potential of UCNs to trigger the release of the payload upon NIR excitation in both in vitro and in vivo environments.
Yan et al. demonstrated the use of UCNs for triggering dissociation of micelles. They synthesized micelles using block copolymers [poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl methacrylate)] and encapsulated NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCN in them (Fig. 11a and b).103 When these micelles are irradiated with a NIR laser, the UCNs produce UV light which causes the photocleavage of o-nitrobenzyl groups in the micelle and leads to dissociation of the micelle. A hydrophobic dye namely Nile Red was also encapsulated in the micelles to study the dissociation kinetics. It was shown that there was an exposure time-dependent degradation of the micelles, which in turn released the loaded cargo. Even though it proved the concept, there were issues like very high laser exposure (5 W for 4 h) needed which might not be appropriate for in vivo use and non-uniform encapsulation of UCNs in the micelles which might induce variations in the micelle degradation characteristics.

The same group also developed a photosensitive hydrogel encapsulated with UCNs.104 The hydrogel was synthesized using hybrid polyacrylamide–PEG, cross-linked by photoresponsive o-nitrobenzyl groups. Core–shell UCNs (NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4) along with the payload was loaded into the photoresponsive hydrogel as shown in Fig. 11c and d. Such hydrogels are very advantageous for tissue engineering applications for on-demand release of growth factors/proteins. BSA conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and trypsin was chosen as the model protein and enzyme respectively. It was shown that these molecules were loaded efficiently and released from the hydrogel upon NIR irradiation to exhibit their activity. It was also shown that there was no release of the molecules under dark conditions thereby showing its potential for applications requiring stepwise, on-demand release. However this study also used a 5 W NIR laser for long durations which might induce heating effects and cell death.
Apart from encapsulating in micelles and hydrogels, UCNs were also encapsulated in photo-responsive polymeric nanoparticles.105 Similar concentrations of NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNs were encapsulated in photo-responsive polymeric particle by electrospraying. These particles had photo-responsive o-nitrobenzyl groups for induction of degradation and subsequent release of cargo. Coumarin 153 was used as a model hydrophobic drug during the encapsulation process. These UCN loaded polymeric particles were polydisperse with a size range of 400 to 1000 nm and encapsulated multiple UCNs. This study used a pulsed NIR laser for triggering instead of the routinely used CW NIR laser but used a much lower power. The maximum power used was 1 W but significant release of the cargo was observed from 500 mW. However, even with the low power used for the experiments, there were significant heating effects and an increase of up to 10 °C was recorded. This increase in heating also leads to some thermal degradation that further leads to minor release of the drug.
After testing these UCN-based light triggered systems with model drugs, subsequently more in-depth studies were performed to test the viability of these systems in in vitro models. Yang et al. coated a layer of mesoporous silica onto the UCNs and the pores are photocaged using a the o-nitrobenzyl linker when the drug is loaded into the pores.106 The upconverted UV emission cleaves the photocage to release doxorubicin as and when required. Light-triggered toxicity of these nanoparticles was tested on the A498 kidney carcinoma cell line where NIR irradiation enabled doxorubicin release in the cells over time and induced significant toxicity in them. Targeted delivery of these nanoparticles was also tested by decorating the nanoparticle surface with FA, which then brought about significant toxicity in HeLa cells which express FR but not in NIH 3T3 cells which do not express them. All these studies used a 980 nm CW laser and irradiation on cells was performed for 2 h.

All these studies used a 980 nm CW laser and irradiation of cells was performed for 2 h.
Aside from delivery of drugs, delivery of biomolecules like siRNA has also been reported.107 Silica-coated NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4 UCNs were further modified covalently with cationic photocaged linkers. siRNA was then adsorbed physically onto these photocaged linkers and used for delivery. These nanoconstructs loaded with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) siRNA knocked down EGFP expression in HeLa cells efficiently after NIR irradiation, comparable to the knockdown by a commercially available transfection reagent. However there was no knockdown observed without NIR irradiation. Also there was no significant reduction in cell viability with the treatment. The duration of NIR irradiation was 2 h with a 5 min break for every 30 min although the power used was not mentioned. All these studies on employing UCNs for several photochemistry applications show excellent and promising results in both in vitro and in vivo systems. However various things need to be meticulously studied before moving to preclinical and clinical studies. At this point of time, cross-comparison of studies for a particular photoactivation application is difficult as the field is still at its infancy and several unique types of UCNs are used for different applications. More in-depth studies like improving the UV emission, improving the bioavailability, assessing the phototoxicity and heating effects of NIR lasers, long term biodistribution of UCNs and optimization of parameters for efficient photoactivation should be performed. Also care should be taken in these studies when comparing the efficiency of UV-based photoactivation and UCN-based photoactivation. Several studies directly compare a low intensity UV lamp source and a high power NIR laser source, which is not a fare comparison. Hence all these points have to be considered when designing future photoactivation studies for furthering this technique to the bedside at a rapid pace.
4. Upconversion nanoparticles for miscellaneous photoactivation applications
In addition to the photoactivation applications mentioned above, UCNs have also been used sporadically for other diverse photoactivation applications like microbial inactivation, solar cells, photophysical reactions etc. Upconversion based PDT has been shown to inactivate microorganisms through the generation of ROS but recently, microbial inactivation has also been shown using UV light generated from UCNs for disinfection of water.108 For this application, UCNs which can convert visible light to UV light was chosen since they wanted to utilize solar energy as the light source. Glass slides were coated with microcrystalline and nanocrystalline Y2SiO5:Pr,Gd UCNs to obtain antimicrobial surfaces. These surfaces effectively inhibited Bacillus spores and Pseudomonas biofilms with visible light irradiation, which in turn was converted to UV light by the upconversion phosphors. It is to be noted that instead of the commonly used laser sources, a lamp source was used for these experiments and it was shown that even with the low power and low efficiency of upconversion, it was sufficient to cause microbial inactivation. Also this technique has the advantage of working in oxygen-depleted surfaces in comparison to PDT which requires oxygen for generation of singlet oxygen. This technology could potentially be used in developing countries as a cost-effective means of water disinfection.
Another interesting application in which UCNs are used is in the field of photovoltaics. This field has progressed significantly with the current need to use alternative renewable sources or energy. However, the efficiency of these solar cells is relatively low till date. Majority of them are able to utilize only the visible range of the spectrum. Since the bulk of solar spectrum (55 to 60%) lies in the NIR range of 800 to 1700 nm, current solar cells are not able to utilize the solar spectrum completely. This was overcome by employing upconversion materials in solar cells to harvest light in the NIR range and convert it to the visible range, which can further be utilized by the solar cells.109,110 Various compositions of UCNs were used but they faced two main problems including low quantum yield and very narrow excitation spectrum. The meager quantum yield of the nanoparticles limits the efficiency with which NIR light can be harvested and the narrow excitation spectrum (around 980 nm) limits the NIR spectrum, which could effectively be converted to UV/visible light. To overcome these problems, other strategies like doping with metals like gold onto these materials are being evaluated to increase the quantum yield and broaden the excitation spectrum.111,112
UCNs have also been utilized as a transducer for photo-isomerization reactions. Here there is no breakage of chemical bonds as seen in the previous applications. Boyer et al. used NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4:Yb,Tm core–shell UCNs for toggling of photoresponsive dithienylethene molecular switches.113 They showed that these dithienylethene (DTE) isomers can be inter-converted using a single type of UCN, where excitation using higher power density generated UV light that enabled ring closing and excitation using low power density generated visible light which enabled ring opening as shown in Fig. 12. Remote photoswitching was done efficiently using a NIR laser for several on–off cycles. The same group also further developed a photoresponsive hybrid system which was synthesized by decorating DTE molecules on oleate ligand coated UCNs (NaYF4:Yb,Er) and used them in vivo as biolabels.114 These DTE-decorated UCNs were delivered in to C. elegans and photoswitching was performed inside their body. The luminescence intensity of the nanoparticles in C. elegans was shown to have 50 to 60% difference in intensity before and after UV irradiation. This system possesses the advantage of being used several times before degradation unlike the single-use systems like photo-caged modulators. Apart from the photoisomers used here, there are several such molecules like azobenzene derivatives, retinoic acid, rotaxanes etc. which could also be photoswitched using UCNs. These kind of molecular photoswitches find applications in diverse fields like bioimaging, diagnostics, chemotherapy and electronics.

Finally, UCNs have also been used for controlling photophysical reactions, Wu and colleagues demonstrated the use of UCNs for modulating the bending characteristics of liquid crystal polymers.115 They synthesized composite films which contained NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNs in combination with azotolane cross-linked liquid crystal polymers. It was shown that these composite films bent towards the light source upon irradiation with a NIR laser within one second and went back to its original state when the light source was switched off. However the liquid crystal polymer without UCN did not show any effect with NIR irradiation. This bending and unbending was repeated for several reversible cycles by switching the NIR light source. Such reactions find applications in developing light-driven micropumps and artificial muscles. There have been very few reports on these applications as they are still far away from being used for practical applications. But it is foreseen that the prevailing roadblocks would be overcome in the near future.
5. Limitations of UCNs
Although promising, UCNs do face certain limitations at present. Their quantum yield is low (<1%), thus a relatively high intensity of NIR is needed for activation. However the use of higher laser power leads to rapid heating effects since the excitation wavelength of UCNs at 980 nm overlaps with the 970 nm water absorption peak. Hence there is tradeoff in the efficiency of photoactivation which can be achieved currently. Thus, this field would benefit from innovations in material science that could allow synthesis of UCNs with a higher quantum yield and also the use of excitation wavelengths where the absorption coefficient of water is low. Some efforts have already been made in this regard. Improved quantum yields have been reported by coating of an undoped shell such as NaYF4 or CaF2 (ref. 116) around the UCN core. This improvement in quantum yield results from a reduction in non-radiative excitation losses at the nanoparticle surface, in other words the suppression of surface quenching due to the additional undoped shell. The use of different host materials,117 optimization of doping ion ratios and dopant types is also being explored as a means of improving the quantum yield.
In terms of using an excitation wavelength different from the conventionally used 980 nm excitation, novel dopants like neodymium (Nd3+) and different lattice structures have been explored. There have been reports of nanoparticles that use Nd3+ as a sensitizer. This dopant has a sharp absorption band centered around 800 nm and thus allows UCNs doped with it to be excited at this wavelength.118,119 However, these Nd3+ doped UCNs have not gone through extensive in vitro and in vivo testing and it remains to be seen whether their photoactivation capabilities are comparable to the UCNs that have been used thus far. UCNs with excitation at wavelengths greater than 980 nm have also been synthesized by using host matrices different from the conventionally used NaYF4. For instance, when BaSr2Y6O12 is used as the host matrix, the resulting nanoparticles can be excited at 1540 nm.120 Similarly, when a LiYF4 host matrix is used, excitation can be achieved at 1490 nm. In addition, these LiYF4 UCNs also have a relatively high quantum yield (1.2% for 85 nm particles at 10–150 W cm−2).116 Apart from shifting the excitation wavelength of UCNs, treatment regimens with different on–off cycles are also being tested. It has been shown that alternative on–off cycles reduce the heating effects significantly without affecting the therapeutic effect significantly.
Another roadblock in the use of UCNs for clinical purposes is the uncertainty in terms of systemic toxicity, their clearance and long-term effects on the body. Although their safety has been demonstrated extensively for in vitro and short term in vivo settings,121 along with studies on biodistribution,122,123 their long term toxicity effects and potential bioaccumulation are largely unexplored. Studies detailing such long-term effects need to be undertaken so as to ascertain the safety of these particles for clinical use. Besides these issues, batch-to-batch variability resulting from the numerous synthesis methods used have made comparisons between the resulting UCN difficult.124 Issues of quality control in terms of uniformity in particle size, optical properties etc. also serve as an impediment in the scaling up of UCN synthesis. Standardization of synthesis techniques and increased automation could potentially resolve these issues. This would allow for greater consistency in the quality of the particles synthesized besides also enabling easy scaling up of the synthesis procedure, all of which are important for bringing these particles to commercial use.
6. Conclusions
This review has described the recent advances in the field of UCN-based photoactivation. Technologies like two-photon excitation and upconversion provide a means of overcoming limitations of traditional photoactivation techniques, particularly the widespread use of low penetrating and/or toxic UV or visible light for excitation, by allowing the use of biologically friendly and deeper penetrating NIR light for excitation instead. The higher efficiency of upconversion processes over two-photon excitation gives the former a distinct advantage and has made UCNs the nanotransducers of choice for photoactivation applications. Also, tunability in terms of emission and high photostability makes them particularly suited for such a purpose. To this end, the use of UCNs for techniques such as PDT, modulation of photochemical reactions including photo-uncaging and photo-triggered release and solar energy harvesting, has been reviewed. In addition, the limitations that UCNs face at present have also been highlighted, including low quantum yields, high water absorption (leading to heating effects) at 980 nm excitation wavelength, high batch to batch variability and uncertain systemic toxicity and clearance. Some efforts have been made to overcome these issues and these have also been described. These include synthesis of UCNs with different types of host lattices, changing the concentration and type of doping ions, reducing surface quenching effects through coating with undoped shells etc.
To conclude, the field of photoactivation in general and use of UCNs as nano-transducers for photoactivation in particular is still in its infancy. The obvious advantages that upcoming nanomaterials like UCN have over traditional materials can potentially revolutionize the field of photoactivation and make it a strong contender for clinical and industrial use. However, significant work needs to be done to improve parameters such as quantum yield, a biologically friendlier excitation wavelength, reduction in batch-to-batch variability along with in depth toxicity studies, before implementation at the clinical or commercial level can be achieved.
