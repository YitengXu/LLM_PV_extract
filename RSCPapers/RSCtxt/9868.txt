The SWAW flexible electrode exhibits excellent optical and electrical properties, with a high transmittance of ∼90%, combined with a low sheet resistance of ∼9 Ω sq−1, and a work function of 5.16 eV. The flexible SWAW electrode is stable through 2000 bending cycles, has strong adhesion, and is thermally and environmentally stable. The performance of the polymer PV cells with the SWAW electrode are competitive with devices based on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, which indicates that the SWAW electrode is a potential candidate for low-cost, light-weight and flexible transparent electrodes to replace ITO in efficient optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) technologies based on solution processed polymers have attracted increasing attention because of their advantageous characteristics, such as their light weight, low cost, and compatibility with flexible substrates to cover large areas.1–3 In particular, polymer PV cells based on flexible substrates have the potential to be used on clothing, tents, flexible chargers, and packaging, giving highly convenient power sources.4–6 Transparent electrodes are the cornerstone of flexible polymer PV cells, allowing light to be transmitted with minimal losses while simultaneously transporting charge. To be acceptable as a flexible transparent electrode, specific properties such as low-cost, low-temperature processing with strong adhesion, and stability after repeated flexing are required, in addition to the essential requirements of high optical transparency and low sheet resistance. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is frequently employed as the transparent electrode in polymer PV cells because of its high transparency and conductivity.7–9 However, ITO is not the best choice for low-cost and efficient flexible polymer PV cells because it is brittle under repeated bending and is incompatible with the high temperature processing of plastic substrates.4,6,10,11 Moreover, indium, the main constituent of ITO is in short supply and sources may soon be exhausted, which means the cost of ITO is constantly increasing.4 Therefore, it is necessary to develop new materials with appropriate properties to boost the development of flexible polymer PV cells.
Recently, several emerging materials such as conducting polymers,12,13 carbon nanotubes,14–16 graphene,17–19 and metallic nanowires,20–22 have shown the potential to replace sputtered ITO in flexible devices. However, they suffer from either large sheet resistance12–19 or high surface roughness,20–22 which causes reduced fill factors (FF) and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in polymer PV cells. Moreover, the adhesion and long-term environmental stability of these transparent conductive films are issues which need to be resolved before they can be applied to flexible devices.
Previous studies have shown that the transmittance of a metal layer can be enhanced through the interference effect by inserting the metal layer between two dielectric layers with high refractive indexes.23–25 The transmittance and conductivity of the multilayer transparent films based on a dielectric–metal–dielectric (DMD) structure can be optimized by tuning the thicknesses of the dielectric and metal layers to achieve high transparency in the visible region as well as high conductivity. In addition, DMD multilayer transparent electrodes can be fabricated at room temperature using abundant materials, which can be deposited through processes such as thermal evaporation,26,27 magnetron sputtering23,25,28,29 and atomic layer deposition (ALD).30,31 All of these technologies can be combined with roll-to-roll technology for low-cost large area production. Nowadays, DMD electrodes have been applied to organic light-emitting diodes and organic PV cells, and the properties of these devices are comparable to devices based on ITO electrodes.28,29,32 However, most of these studies are based on DMD electrodes on glass substrates; the properties of flexible optoelectronic devices with DMD electrodes have been seldom investigated, particularly in flexible polymer PV cells. In addition, the adhesion, thermal and long-term environmental stabilities of DMD electrodes based on flexible substrates have not been reported.
Flexible polymer PV cells have the advantages of being light-weight and easily bent. Herein, we have developed a method of fabricating ultrathin (∼25 μm-thick) and flexible polymer PV cells based on an indium-free transparent electrode with the DMD structure of SiO2/WO3/Ag/WO3 (SWAW), which greatly decreases the weight and thickness of the flexible polymer PV cells compared with devices based on the popular ITO-coated 100–300 μm-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates.17,33 SWAW electrodes deposited on polyimide (PI) substrates show excellent electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, together with good thermal and environmental stabilities, which are comparable or better than ITO electrodes. Moreover, SWAW electrodes are compatible with organic materials, and can be patterned using lithographic masks. The performance of the polymer PV cells with SWAW electrodes are competitive with a device based on ITO/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) electrodes, which indicates that SWAW is a potential candidate for low-cost, light-weight and flexible transparent electrodes to replace ITO for efficient optoelectronic devices.
Experimental

Fig. 1 shows the fabrication process for the ultrathin flexible polymer PV cells employing SWAW electrodes. PI was used as the flexible substrate for the polymer PV cells, which was dropped as a liquid onto a pre-cleaned glass substrate held at 60 °C, sustained at 60 °C for 1 h, then heated up to 200 °C for 10 min to form a ∼25 μm-thick PI film. The flexible polymer PV cells were fabricated on PI-coated glass substrates, which provide a flat and smooth surface for the SWAW electrodes and active layer deposition. Patterned SWAW electrodes were deposited by electron beam evaporation through shadow masks. SiO2 (100 nm), WO3 (35 nm), Ag (10 nm) and WO3 (35 nm) were deposited sequentially at a substrate temperature of 25 °C by electron beam evaporation. Before depositing each of the WO3 layers, oxygen gas was introduced into the evaporation chamber at a flow rate of 13–15 SCCM to keep a vacuum pressure of 2.0 × 10−2 Pa. The SiO2 and Ag layers were prepared at ∼1.2 × 10−3 Pa without oxygen gas. The evaporation rates of SiO2, WO3 and Ag were 0.4, 0.1 and 1 nm s−1, respectively, which were monitored in situ with a thin film deposition controller (MDC-360C). The underlying SiO2 was used to improve the adhesion of the WO3 and Ag to the substrate. A blend of a low band gap conjugated polymer, poly[4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2b:4,5b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-thieno[3,4b]thiophene-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-C, Solarmer) and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM, American Dye) was spin-coated onto the substrates from dichlorobenzene in a glove box to serve as the active layer. A small amount (3% in volume ratio) of a high boiling-point additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to optimize the morphology.34,35 Finally, LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally deposited at a pressure of approximately 4 × 10−4 Pa. After the deposition of the top Al electrode, the SWAW-coated PI substrate and the active layers and top electrodes were stripped carefully from the glass substrates using tweezers. Fig. 2 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the 25 μm-thick flexible polymer PV cells before stripping from the glass substrate. For comparison, devices based on ITO (11 Ω sq−1)/PEDOT (Baytron P AI 4083, 30 nm) and glass/SWAW electrodes were fabricated using the same process. The active area of the PV cells was 0.12 cm2. All measurements were performed in air without encapsulation.

Optical transmittance spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements were performed on a SA400HV with a SPI3800N controller, Seiko Instruments Industry, Co., Ltd. The structure images of the flexible polymer PV cells were characterized using SEM (Hi-tachi S-4800). Work functions were investigated on a KP Technology Ambient Kelvin probe system package. Carrier concentration, resistivity, and Hall carrier mobility were carried out by Hall effect measurements, and the maximum magnetic field applied was 0.55 T. Film thicknesses were measured with an Ambios XP-1 surface profiler. The surface resistance was measured using the four-point probe method with a surface resistivity meter. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the polymer PV cells were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2611 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed with a lock-in amplifier at a chopping frequency of 20 Hz during illumination with the monochromatic light from a xenon lamp.
Results and discussion
In order to optimize the optical transmittance of the SWAW electrodes, ensuring more photons passing through the SWAW electrodes and allowing efficient light absorption in the polymer PV cells, optical analysis was carried out by using the optical transfer matrix method,36,37 which is related to the thickness and refractive index of the film. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the contour plots for the transmittance of SWAW multilayers on different substrates at a wavelength of 550 nm as a function of WO3 and Ag thickness. In this calculation, the thickness of SiO2 was fixed at 100 nm and the two WO3 layers were kept at the same thickness. With the varying thickness of both the Ag and WO3 layers, the calculated transmittance of the SWAW on the glass (Fig. 3(a)) and PI (Fig. 3(b)) substrates was optimized to over 90% and 95%, respectively. The best transmittance of SWAW on both substrates was achieved at a thickness of WO3 of 35–55 nm. Our calculations indicated that the transmittance of the Ag layer can be enhanced to over 90% by varying the thickness of both WO3 layers, and the maximum transmittance of the SWAW multilayer can be adjusted from the visible region to the infrared region by increasing the thickness of both WO3 layers (Fig. 3(c)). Herein, the SWAW with a SiO2 (100 nm)/WO3 (35 nm)/Ag (10 nm)/WO3 (35 nm) structure on glass and PI substrates was fabricated with a calculated transmittance of 92% and 95% at 550 nm, respectively. Fig. 3(d) shows the measured transmittance spectra of the SWAW electrodes on the glass and PI substrates, and the transmittance of ITO is also shown for comparison. The average transmittance of SWAW on glass is 82.6% over 350–700 nm, which is a little lower than ITO (84.2%) over the same range. Because of the absorption of the PI substrate below 400 nm, the transmittance of the SWAW-coated PI film decreased sharply between 350 and 400 nm. However, the SWAW multilayer on the PI substrate showed a high average transmittance of 90% over 400–750 nm. A photograph of this flexible PI/SWAW transparent substrate is shown as an inset in Fig. 3(d). Moreover, the SWAW electrode is compatible with different flexible substrates (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†) and thermal evaporation, magnetron sputtering or ALD processing, which can be combined with roll-to-roll technology for large area production.

Aside from optical properties, electrical characteristics are also key indicators of transparent electrodes for polymer PV cells. Fig. 4(a) shows the sheet resistance and transmittance of SWAW electrodes based on PI substrates as a function of Ag thickness. Both the sheet resistance and transmittance of SWAW decreased with increasing Ag layer. In order to compare different transparent electrodes directly, a figure of merit was introduced to rank the quality of the transparent electrodes,38–40 which has been defined as: (1)where σ is the conductivity, α is the absorption coefficient, t is the electrode thickness, Rsh is the sheet resistance, A is the absorption, and T is the transmittance. Here, we neglect the reflection of the transparent electrodes, and the value for T is the average transmittance over 400–750 nm. A high σ/α value indicates a high transmittance and a low sheet resistance. Fig. 4(b) shows the σ/α of these SWAW electrodes with a fixed WO3 thickness of 35 nm based on PI substrates as a function of the thickness of the Ag layer. The σ/α value was only 0.22 Ω−1 with 6 nm Ag, which was due to the large sheet resistance, which originated in the discontinuous growth of the Ag film. The σ/α value increased with increasing Ag thickness, and reached a maximum value of 1.05 Ω−1 with 10 nm Ag, which contributed to a high transmittance and a low sheet resistance, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The σ/α value then decreased to 0.55 Ω−1 because of the decreased transmittance of the thicker Ag layer (20 nm). For comparison, the σ/α value of the ITO electrode (0.62 Ω−1) used in this work was calculated using the same method, which was lower than the SWAW electrode with 10 nm Ag. The higher σ/α value of the SWAW flexible electrode indicates that the SWAW electrode has the potential to replace ITO in polymer PV cells.

Surface roughness, and the work function of transparent electrodes are very important for the stability and efficiency of polymer PV cells.41,42 The SWAW electrode based on a PI substrate also shows excellent surface morphology and work function, which further shows the potential for the fabrication of efficient flexible polymer PV cells. Fig. 5 shows the AFM images of ITO, PI and SWAW. As seen in Fig. 5(b), the PI substrates were very smooth; the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of SWAW deposited on PI was only 0.72 nm, while the RMS of the compared ITO was 3.94 nm. In addition, since WO3 is a hole-transport material,43,44 the SWAW electrode shows a higher work function of 5.16 eV than the ITO electrode (4.7 eV) (Fig. S2, ESI†), which decreases the offset between the work function of the SWAW electrode and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PBDTTT-C (5.12 eV).33 Therefore, the smooth surface and high work function of the SWAW electrode indicate that good Ohmic contact and increased built-in potential for maximizing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) will be achieved in SWAW devices without any interfacial layers at the anode.

The properties of flexible electrodes under repeated bending have a significant effect on the performance of flexible devices. Fig. 6(a)–(c) shows the electrical characteristics, including carrier concentration, Hall mobility, and resistivity of the SWAW flexible electrode under repeated bending. The bending angle was about 90° (Fig. S3, ESI†). The carrier concentration and Hall mobility of the SWAW electrode remain virtually unchanged, while the resistivity of SWAW increases slightly after 2000 bending cycles. As a result, the sheet resistance of the SWAW flexible electrodes increases from 9.1 Ω sq−1 to 9.5 Ω sq−1, while the sheet resistance of the flexible ITO electrode increases to about 1800 Ω sq−1 after only 400 bending cycles (Fig. S4, ESI†). This illustrates that flexible SWAW electrodes have better mechanical properties than flexible ITO electrodes.26,45 Moreover, the mechanical adhesion and environmental stabilities of the SWAW electrode have also been studied. The sheet resistance remains ∼9 Ω sq−1 after peeling the SWAW electrode with tape three times (Fig. 6(d)), and the sheet resistance increases by only 3% after leaving the SWAW electrode in air for half a year (Fig. 6(e)).

Fig. 7 shows the thermal stability of the SWAW electrodes on both glass and PI substrates. The transmittance and Hall mobility of SWAW on both substrates decreased slightly with increased annealing temperature (Fig. 7(a), (b) and (d)), while the sheet resistance of SWAW increased slightly with increased annealing temperature up to 250 °C (Fig. 7(e)), which might be the result of slight Ag oxidization under heating. However, because of crack formation on the PI surface, the sheet resistance of PI/SWAW increased dramatically after annealing at 300 °C for 30 min. However, the SWAW electrode was thermally stable and would be compatible with the annealing process in some polymer PV cells. In addition, the SWAW electrode can be patterned using a lithographic mask. Our research also revealed one drawback of the SWAW electrodes. They have poor acid and alkali resistance, and can be corroded by weak acid or alkali, which would preclude the use of such solutions in the fabrication of a device.

To evaluate the properties of the transparent SWAW electrodes, polymer PV cells based on PBDTTT-C:PC70BM were prepared on SWAW coated glass or PI substrates. Fig. 8(a) shows the J–V characteristics of the polymer PV cells based on glass/SWAW, PI/SWAW and ITO/PEDOT substrates under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. The detailed parameters of these PV cells are summarized in Table 1. For the device using ITO/PEDOT as the anode electrode, a PCE of 6.11% was obtained with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 14.07 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.70 V and a FF of 0.62. The SWAW device based on a glass substrate showed a similar performance (VOC = 0.70 V, JSC = 14.66 mA cm−2, FF = 0.59, and PCE = 6.05%). When the flexible polymer PV cell based on a PI substrate, fabricated as illustrated in Fig. 1, was measured, a PCE of 5.47% was achieved with a JSC of 13.27 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.70 V and a FF of 0.59. The lower PCE of the flexible device was attributed to the smaller JSC resulting from the PI film limiting the absorption of the active layer, which was confirmed by the EQE spectra of the devices based on different substrates (Fig. 8(b)). The JSC values calculated from the EQE spectra are also listed in Table 1. The characteristics of the flexible polymer PV cell under repeated bending were also investigated (Fig. 8(c)). The VOC and FF of the flexible device decreased slightly after bending 2000 times (3% and 7% respectively). However, because of the 20% decrease in JSC, only 70% of its initial PCE was achieved after 2000 bending cycles. Since the flexible SWAW electrode has stable electrical properties under repeated bending (Fig. 6), the decreased performance of the flexible device was attributed to the degradation of the Al electrodes after repeated measurements in air.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a method to fabricate ultrathin and efficient flexible polymer PV cells based on an indium-free SWAW transparent electrode. The SWAW electrode showed excellent optical and electrical properties, which has an excellent transmittance of 80–90%, combined with a low sheet resistance of ∼9 Ω sq−1, and a work function of 5.16 eV. The PCEs of the polymer PV cells with SWAW deposition on glass and PI substrates were 6.05% and 5.47%, respectively. The flexible SWAW electrode and polymer PV cells showed excellent stability towards bending-induced tension stress, and the SWAW electrode also exhibited strong adhesion, and good thermal and environmental stabilities, which indicates that the SWAW electrode is a promising substitute for commercial ITO electrodes as a low-cost, light-weight and stable flexible transparent electrode in efficient polymer PV cells. The applications of SWAW in inverted and tandem polymer PV cells will be further studied.
