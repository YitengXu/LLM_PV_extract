    , Accepted 17th January 2023First published on 18th January 2023AbstractDespite the promising characteristics of tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs), one obvious limitation is the rapid oxidation of Sn2+, resulting in poor device performance and stability. Here, we introduced two different aromatic carboxylic acid molecules, 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (BP2Ac) and biphenyl-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxylic acid (BP4Ac), into the perovskite precursor solution, by adjusting pH of the precursor solution to suppress the fast Sn2+ oxidation. In addition, we proposed a vertical antioxidant strategy by simultaneously inhibiting the downward diffusion process of Sn4+ in both precursor solutions and perovskite films. Meanwhile, BP4Ac in the perovskite film can also form hydrogen bonds with the perovskite to further improve the stability of the device. Consequently, the unencapsulated devices retain nearly 87% of the initial PCE even after 1000 hours of storage in a nitrogen atmosphere. This strategy enabled the photovoltaic devices to deliver a power conversion efficiency of 10.35% with lower defect density. This work provides a novel antioxidant strategy for efficient wide band gap tin perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Lead-halide based perovskite solar cells (LPSCs) have experienced a steep development in their power conversion efficiency (PCE) values over the past decade, rising from 3.8% to 25.7%, which provides considerable prospects for the future application of photovoltaics.1–3 However, as a heavy metal element that seriously endangers human health, lead hinders the development of commercial and indoor applications of perovskite photovoltaics.4 Therefore, the development of eco-friendly materials based on tin (Sn), germanium (Ge), copper (Cu), bismuth (Bi), and antimony (Sb) to substitute lead as optical absorption layers has attracted much attention.5–8 Among them, tin perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are the most promising candidate for next generation PSCs because of their high charge-carrier mobility, low exciton binding energy, and similar ionic radius and electronic configuration to lead.9,10 In addition, wide band gap tin perovskite solar cells (with a band gap of 1.6 eV) as the top cell in tandems, a mutually beneficial collaboration with Si, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) or narrow band gap perovskites for the development of tandem solar cells that can further improve efficiency. The PCE of tandem solar cells is able to overcome the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit (∼31–33%) for single-junction devices. Up till the present moment, the PCE of TPSCs has exceeded 14% through various methods, including additive engineering, interface optimization, and solvent engineering, and the efficiency of wide band gap TPSCs has also reached 11.17%, but their PCE still lags far behind that of lead-based counterparts.5,11–13 Previous studies have suggested that the lower efficiency of TPSCs is mainly due to the labile oxidation nature of Sn2+, which induces the stoichiometric ratio imbalance and adverse p-type self-doping in tin-based perovskite films.14,15
Regarding the above issue, considerable efforts have been devoted in order to inhibit this oxidation. For example, Yan et al. introduced antioxidant gallic acid (GA) together with SnCl2 to protect the inner perovskite grains from oxidation by forming SnCl2–GA complexes wrapping the perovskite grain surface.16 And liquid formic acid (LFA) has been used as the reducing solvent to reduce the Sn4+ content in perovskite films, resulting in efficiencies of over 10% for TPSCs.17 Another approach involves crystallization regulation, where Chen et al. were able to achieve a PCE of 12.26% by utilizing acetic acid (HAc) to form pre-nucleation clusters.18 Joy et al. thoroughly investigated the mechanisms of action of different additives for reducing the concentration of Sn4+ and highlighted the significance of accounting for redox potential and coordination with tin species.19 Although the above studies are impressive, the effect of acidity on TPSCs has not been fully elucidated in several of these studies. Meanwhile, the antioxidant strategies only aim to reduce the Sn4+ content in the device and ultimately improve its performance. However, the subsequent diffusion of Sn4+ resulting in accelerated degradation of the device has not been well resolved.
Herein, two acidic molecules, namely 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (BP2Ac) and biphenyl-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxylic acid (BP4Ac) were selected to systematically study the effect of acidity in inhibiting the formation of Sn4+ and its effect on device efficiency. And we reported for the first time, a vertical anti-oxidant strategy that simultaneously inhibits the downward diffusion of Sn4+ in perovskite films and precursor solutions, which can effectively improve the oxidation resistance of perovskite in the liquid and solid states by utilizing aromatic polycarboxylic acid molecules. The partial ionization of BP4Ac in the precursor solution provides an acidic environment for Sn2+ to maintain its thermodynamic stability, and the carboxylate ions have a stronger interaction with Sn4+ in the precursor solution to inhibit the process of downward diffusion of Sn4+, and CO of aromatic polycarboxylic acid molecules can form coordination bonds with Sn2+ to further inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+. In the perovskite film, BP4Ac distributed on the surface of the film can prevent the entry of oxygen, thus protecting the intrinsic perovskite grain from oxidation, and can passivate the uncoordinated Sn2+ to further suppress the oxidation process. Moreover, BP4Ac dispersed at grain boundaries in the bulk of the films mainly restrain the migration and oxidation of iodide ions through hydrogen bond interaction, thus improving the stability of the device. Furthermore, BP4Ac with more carboxyl groups compared with BP2Ac, also has a better passivation effect. Taking into account multifaceted benefits, the BP4Ac-modified TPSCs achieved a champion PCE of 10.35% and yielded VOC up to 0.85 V and FF as high as 0.73. The target-BP4Ac device exhibited remarkable long-term stability, retaining almost 87% of its initial PCE after 1000 hours of storage in an inert gas atmosphere.
Experimental
Materials and precursor solutions
Formamidinium bromide (FABr) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were purchased from Greatcell Solar Materials Pty Ltd. SnI2 (99.999%) was purchased from Libra New Energy Technology company. Tin(II) fluoride (SnF2, 99%) was purchased from Aldrich. Bathocuproine (BCP) was purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. ICBA was purchased from 1-Material. DMF (99.8%), DMSO (99.8%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and chlorobenzene (CB) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI 4083) was bought from Heraeus. The perovskite solution was prepared by mixing MABr, FABr, SnI2, SnF2, and EDAI2 in the molar ratio of 0.25:0.75:1:0.1:0.02, and then dissolving in 1 mL of DMSO and DMF mixed solvent (1/9, v/v). For the preparation of the additive-containing precursor solution, 0.5 mg of BP2Ac and 0.1 mg of BP4Ac were added. 20 mg of ICBA was dissolved in 1 mL of CB to prepare the ICBA solution.
Devices and characteristics
PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the substrates at 4500 rpm for 50 s in the air, followed by 140 °C annealing for 15 min. The perovskite solution was spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS at 5000 rpm for 30 s, while adding about 200 μL of toluene dropwise onto the film at 7 s to fabricate the perovskite thin film. Then the film was annealed at 70 °C for 5 min. After cooling, the electron transfer layer was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, an 8 nm BCP layer and 100 nm Ag electrode were evaporated under vacuum conditions (Suzhou Fangsheng FS-380). The active area of each separating device is 7.25 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells could be obtained under AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter. The field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained using a ZEISS G500. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker XRD equipment. A system combining a xenon lamp, monochromator, chopper, lock-in amplifier and calibrated silicon photodetector was used to measure EQE. The XPS and UPS analyses were done by using an ESCALAB250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800. The time-resolved photoluminescence decay was recorded by a 502 ns time resolution and laser excitation using a transient fluorescence spectrometer (HORIB-FM-2015). FTIR was performed using a machine from Bruck. The absorption spectra were obtained using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). The depth-dependent XPS analyses were measured at the Jiangsu Jicui Photoelectric Test Center.
Results and discussion
In this work, inverted planar TPSCs are fabricated with the device configuration of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/FA0.75MA0.25SnI2Br/indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag (Fig. S1†), where MA and FA denote methylammonium and formamidinium, respectively.20,21 To systematically reveal the role of the acidity, we choose two acidic molecules, namely 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (BP2Ac) and biphenyl-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxylic acid (BP4Ac) as additives (Fig. 1a). The electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis (Fig. 1b) indicated a high electronegativity of O in BP2Ac (−31.95 kcal mol−1) and in BP4Ac (−30.51 kcal mol−1), driving the formation of strong coordination bonds between Sn2+ and CO in both additives and substantially inhibiting the oxidation of Sn2+.22,23 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis further confirmed the interactions between perovskite and both additives. As shown in Fig. S2,† the peak shifts from 495.4 to 495.7 eV for the Sn 3d3/2 orbit, and from 487.0 to 487.3 eV for the Sn 3d5/2 orbit when the perovskite film was treated with BP4Ac. This indicates the strongest interaction between BP4Ac and perovskite, which is profitable for both the passivation of surface defects and the stabilization of Sn2+ components in perovskite.

Compared with BP4Ac, the lower shift of Sn 3d for BP2Ac (0.2 eV) illustrates the weaker interaction between the CO in BP2Ac and Sn2+. Although the electronegativity of O in BP2Ac is slightly larger than that in BP4Ac, the four carboxyl functional groups in BP4Ac further strengthen this interaction.24,25 The redox properties of Sn2+ in alkali and acid media can be evaluated from the standard reduction potential (E0). In a redox reaction, the change in the free energy of the redox reaction (ΔG0) can be calculated from E0 of the reactants. The fact that ΔG0 is negative and the reaction can proceed spontaneously in an alkaline environment shows that Sn2+ is unstable there. However, in an acidic environment, ΔG0 is positive and the reaction cannot proceed spontaneously, indicating that the acidic environment is beneficial for inhibiting the oxidation of Sn2+ (Fig. S3†).17 Since BP2Ac has better solubility than BP4Ac, we evaluated the pH values corresponding to BP2Ac at various concentrations (Table S1†). In addition, to further demonstrate its antioxidant properties under acidic conditions, the precursor solution was kept in the glove box for two weeks, and XPS was employed to measure the ratio of Sn4+/Sn2+ in perovskite films fabricated with the precursor solution (before and after two weeks of placing in the glove box) at various pH levels. The content of Sn4+ is effectively suppressed by acidity, as illustrated by the observation that while the acidity of the solution increases, the increment of the ratio of Sn4+/Sn2+ detected in perovskite films drops (Fig. 1c). The corresponding parameters of XPS analysis are displayed in Fig. S4 and S5,† where Fig. S4† displays the content of Sn4+ in perovskite films prepared with fresh precursor solution, and Fig. S5† demonstrates the content of Sn4+ in perovskite films fabricated with precursor solution placed in the glove box for two weeks. However, when pH declines, the device efficiency does not follow the same tendency as the ratio of Sn4+/Sn2+; instead, it peaks at pH = 4.62 and adversely affected device performance even as pH continued to lessen (Fig. 1d). This is mainly attributed to the high doping concentration and the detrimental effect of acidity on perovskites.18,26 Furthermore, the concept of acidity coefficient (AC) was first introduced here to quantify the acidic intensity of the two additives (AC = Z/M, where Z is the proton number and M represents the molar mass of acid molecules). The calculated AC of BP2Ac is 0.0083, while the AC of BP4Ac is 0.0121 (1.47 times of BP2Ac), demonstrating that BP4Ac could yield elevated acidity with less molar mass, which resolves the issue aforementioned. Consequently, BP4Ac might obtain a better result in terms of both device efficiency and oxidation resistance. Details on the preliminary optimization of additive concentrations (Table S2†) are provided in the ESI.†
The absorption spectra of the precursor solutions with and without additives were recorded to shed light on the impact of the two acidic molecules on Sn2+ (observed at 405 nm). The fresh precursor solution was added to BP2Ac and BP4Ac solutions (DMF as the solvent) at the optimal concentration for detection to avoid exceeding the detector limit. As shown in Fig. 1e, due to the precursor solution being added to the cuvette in air, the solution will undergo various degrees of oxidation throughout the addition process, resulting in inconsistent absorption values at the beginning. The absorption signal of the sample without additives clearly displayed a substantial increase in the absorption signal over time after 100 minutes, which was also confirmed by the solution that turned from colorless to dark yellow. This transformation was previously thought to be caused by the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+.27 Intriguingly, the absorption signal of the solutions containing both additives begins to increase after 150 minutes. In particular, obviously slower absorption signal enhancement of the solutions containing BP4Ac was observed, showing that BP4Ac has prominent capacity to prevent the oxidation of Sn2+ at lower concentrations. The contents of Sn2+ and Sn4+ in perovskite films with different additives were also explored, and the perovskite films with BP4Ac showed the least area ratio of Sn4+/Sn2+, suggesting that BP4Ac obviously restrained the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ (Fig. S6†). The inset image in Fig. 1e also revealed an unexpected discovery that the BP4Ac-containing solution effectively blocked the downward diffusion of Sn4+ in contrast to the pristine and target-BP2Ac solutions. According to Pearson's hard/soft acid/base (HSAB) principle, the carboxylate-based ligands (BP4Ac) can be regarded as a hard base, which forms a strong interaction with a hard acid (Sn4+), finally inhibiting the downward diffusion of Sn4+.28
Depth-profiling XPS test was performed to investigate the area ratio of Sn4+/Sn2+ in different thicknesses of perovskite films, and all samples were placed in air for 20 minutes to study their antioxidant effect before etching. The depth distributions of the characteristic XPS spectra of Sn 3d of the three samples are shown in Fig. 2a. Then, the Sn 3d spectra of the three samples were analyzed to obtain the curve of the change of Sn4+ content at different film depths (specific parameters are shown in Fig. S7–S9†).12,29 As depicted in Fig. 2b, the content of Sn4+ on the surface of the pristine is relatively high and still large at the film inside, which is 37.8%, 35.1%, and 31.4%, respectively, with the increase of sputtering time. The perovskite films treated with BP2Ac and BP4Ac only have a large proportion of Sn4+ (32.3% for target-BP2Ac and 26.9% for target-BP4Ac) on the surface, while the content of Sn4+ in the interior is relatively small. This confirms that the antioxidant strategy observed in the precursor solution is also present in perovskite films, that is, BP4Ac can also hamper the downward diffusion of Sn(IV) by preventing the entry of oxygen into the film.

Compared with pristine and target-BP2Ac, the doped BP4Ac treatment led to an obvious overall decrease in the Sn(IV) content at all film depths, which is mainly ascribed to the inhibitory effect under acidic conditions. Fig. 2c schematically illustrates the form of interaction of BP4Ac with Sn(IV) and Sn(II) in the precursor solution and the blocking of oxygen entry in the film state.30 To evaluate the influence of additives on the morphology of perovskite films, top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed (Fig. S10†). The pristine film displays many pinholes on the surface, which will lead to surface recombination and affect charge transfer and collection. For the target-BP2Ac and target-BP4Ac films, the surface pinhole density showed a downward trend, and the improved film quality also corresponds to the increased oxidation resistance in the film state.31
Liquid-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) was employed to confirm the formation of hydrogen bonds between SnI2 and the additives (Fig. S11 and S12†); as shown in Fig. 3a, in the BP2Ac-containing deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide reagent (DMSO-d6), the proton resonance signals for –COOH in BP2Ac appear at δ = 13.02; after the addition of SnI2 to the solution of BP2Ac, there is a distinct broadening of the resonance signal attributed to the carboxyl group of BP2Ac, indicating the (–OH⋯I−) hydrogen bonding interaction.32 The above phenomena can also be observed for the BP4Ac additive, as shown in Fig. 3b. The broadening phenomenon is due to the fact that a certain proportion of active hydrogen forms different proportions of hydrogen bonds, which makes the chemical environment of active hydrogen have more possibilities.24

XPS measurements were conducted to investigate the mechanism of hydrogen bonding in both the pristine FA0.75MA0.25–SnI2Br film and target films with BP2Ac and BP4Ac additives. Fig. 3c–e show the percentage of I− of these three different samples and these ratios have been extracted from the analysis of I 3d5/2 XPS spectra. Compared with that of the pristine film (82.9%), the films with additives showed significantly larger percentage of I− up to 98.6% and 92.3%, respectively. Among the three samples, the I 3d (631.3 eV for 3d3/2 and 619.8 eV for 3d5/2) peaks displayed the largest shifts (0.30 eV) for target-BP4Ac toward a higher binding energy (Fig. S13†). With respect to BP2Ac, a relatively small shift (0.1 eV) of its I 3d peak position at 631.1 eV and 619.6 eV toward a higher binding energy is observed, indicating the strongest hydrogen bond (–OH⋯I−) interaction between the BP4Ac and perovskite, thus explaining the higher percentage of I− of the samples with the additive of BP4Ac.33
The (–OH⋯I−) hydrogen bonding interaction in the perovskite film could inhibit the migration of I− and the oxidation of I− to I2 or I3−, thereby reducing iodine vacancy defects and improving the stability of perovskite solar cells, which was further confirmed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S14†).34 In the XRD patterns of pristine perovskite films new diffraction peaks appear that are related to SnI4 at 12.7°, and the intensity of the main diffraction peaks basically disappears after 3 hours of exposure to air. It means that pristine perovskite films suffer substantial deterioration. And for target-BP2Ac, a similar degradation phenomenon can also be observed, but the degradation degree is better than that of the original film. However, in the BP4Ac-containing perovskite film, the main diffraction peak remains, although accompanied by the appearance of an SnI4 signal.13,18 The results are in excellent agreement with the expected role of our additives to inhibit the entry of oxygen, as the schematic shows in Fig. 2c. The aforementioned NMR, XPS, and XRD results comprehensively show that the hydrogen bond interaction between BP4Ac and perovskite is stronger, thereby enhancing the stability and PCE of the target device by improving the resistance to oxidation of the film.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was employed to investigate the optical properties and charge recombination in these perovskite films. The target-BP4Ac film exhibits the strongest fluorescence intensity among all the perovskite films, indicating that the recombination of carriers in the perovskite was dramatically suppressed. This could be ascribed to the more effective passivation of defects by BP4Ac and the decrease of the proportion of Sn4+ on the perovskite surface. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured to explore the light absorption ability and band gap (Fig. S15†). The film containing BP4Ac shows an improved absorption intensity in the range from 420 to 800 nm. A red shift of the absorption band edge was observed on the incorporation of BP2Ac and BP4Ac. The band gaps of these three samples were 1.625, 1.623, and 1.616 eV, respectively, which were obtained from the absorption spectra.
The results are also consistent with steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, in which the emission peaks of both target perovskite films have a slight red shift, showing that both additives could mildly alter the band gap of perovskite films. According to the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) characteristics in Fig. 4b, the average lifetime (τave) of excited electrons was significantly prolonged from 2.88 ns (pristine) to 38.7 ns (target-BP4Ac), which is much longer than 15.7 ns for target-BP2Ac. Consequently, the non-radiative recombination in the perovskite layer was significantly inhibited by BP4Ac.35

The increase of Urbach energy reflects the higher defect density and the VOC deficit has been commonly used as a device performance parameter to correlate with Eu. Fig. 4c illustrates Eu calculated from UV-vis absorption spectra for the three samples, using the following formula: α = α0exp(hν/Eu), where α is the absorption coefficient, α0 is a constant, and hν is the photon energy. The Eu of these three films was 51 meV (pristine), 47 meV (target-BP2Ac), and 44 meV (target-BP4Ac), respectively. The phenomenon illustrates the reduced defect concentration with the addition of BP4Ac.36,37
In order to further clarify the impact of passivation on perovskite films without and with both additives, the characterization of space-charge limited current (SCLC) was employed to study the electron-dominated devices with the structure FTO/SnO2/perovskite/ICBA/Ag under dark conditions. Nt can be calculated using the following equation: (1)where εr, ε0, q and L are the relative dielectric constant, vacuum permittivity, elementary charge, and thickness of the perovskite layer, respectively,5 and the trap density is derived from the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL). As expected, the lower value of VTFL (0.295 V) of the electron-dominated devices with an Nt of (9.43 × 1015 cm−3) means that the additive of BP4Ac could greatly inhibit the defects of the perovskite film as depicted in Fig. 4d. The VTFL values of the other two devices were estimated to be 0.525 V (pristine) and 0.453 V (target-BP2Ac) and the Nt of the corresponding devices was 1.68 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.45 × 1016 cm−3, which were much higher than that of the device with BP4Ac.5 Furthermore, the trap density of states (tDOS) inferred from the angular frequency-dependent capacitance was employed to further evaluate the defect distribution in the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 4e, the trap density of the perovskite film decreased after treatment with BP2Ac and BP4Ac.
Moreover, the doping of BP4Ac exhibits the lowest trap density, confirming that BP4Ac has a superior ability to passivate defects and inhibit the formation of Sn4+.38 To probe the profile distribution of the trap density, drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) was utilized as shown in Fig. 4f. Clearly, the film treated with BP4Ac displayed the lowest density of defect states at different depths, which further reflects the successful penetration of BP4Ac and the passivation effect.39,40
The J–V curves of the champion devices without and with additives are shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Apparently, the improved VOC can be ascribed to the lower density of defect states as described above. We consider that this is related to two factors: (1) the introduced hydrogen bond and strong coordination bond retard the crystallization rate of the perovskite, finally improving the quality of the perovskite film. (2) The reduced content of Sn4+ in the precursor solution and perovskite film results in lower tin vacancies, leading to the reduction in deep level traps. The statistical distributions of photovoltaic parameters for pristine devices and both target devices are summarized in Fig. 5b. The target-BP4Ac devices exhibit good repeatability compared with the pristine and target-BP2Ac devices. The integrated photocurrent density (15.15 mA cm−2) obtained from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the target-BP4Ac device (Fig. 5c) agrees closely with the current density (JSC) in the J–V curves. We further monitored the PCE output at the maximum power point voltage of 0.7 V for this device for 300 s with a stable current density of 14.04 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5d), which stabilized at 9.83%. Ultraviolet (UV) photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to explore the effect of both additives on the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of the perovskite films, and the parameters are shown in Fig. S16† in detail. The VB values are estimated to be −5.54, −5.51, and −5.47 eV for the pristine, target-BP2Ac, and target-BP4Ac perovskite films, respectively. By subtracting the band gap obtained from the UV-vis spectra, the values of the CB are estimated to be −3.92, −3.89, and −3.86 eV, respectively. This demonstrated the favorable energy alignment for the carrier injection at the interface. The target-BP4Ac device also exhibits better stability. After 1000 h of storage in a nitrogen-filled glove box, 87% of the initial PCE could be retained. For comparison, only about 40% retention of the initial PCE is achieved for the pristine device after 700 h (Fig. 5e).

Conclusion
In summary, we have reported a vertical antioxidant strategy for wide band gap tin perovskite photovoltaics by introducing BP4Ac into the perovskite precursor solution for the first time. This novel anti-oxidation strategy not only effectively prevented the formation of Sn4+, but also simultaneously inhibited the vertical diffusion of Sn4+ in the precursor solution and perovskite film. Therefore, the p–i–n planar device treated with BP4Ac can achieve an excellent PCE of 10.35%, while Jsc is significantly improved to 16.64 mA cm−2. In addition, the corresponding devices can maintain 87% of their initial efficiency after being stored in nitrogen for more than 1000 h. This work provides a promising strategy for the oxidation resistance of tin perovskite solar cells and highlights the significance of a vertical antioxidant strategy for the fabrication of efficient and stable, lead-free, and environmentally-friendly photovoltaic devices.
