    First published on 29th June 2022AbstractCovalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of organic crystalline porous materials discovered in the early 21st century that have become an attractive class of emerging materials due to their high crystallinity, intrinsic porosity, structural regularity, diverse functionality, design flexibility, and outstanding stability. However, many chemical and physical properties strongly depend on the presence of metal ions in materials for advanced applications, but metal-free COFs do not have these properties and are therefore excluded from such applications. Metalated COFs formed by combining COFs with metal ions, while retaining the advantages of COFs, have additional intriguing properties and applications, and have attracted considerable attention over the past decade. This review presents all aspects of metalated COFs, from synthetic strategies to various applications, in the hope of promoting the continued development of this young field.

1. Introduction
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are covalent bond-linked two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) organic crystalline frameworks constructed from organic monomers composed entirely of light elements (e.g., C, N, O, B, and S).1–4 According to the groundbreaking work by Yaghi et al. in 2005, the first reported COFs, i.e., COF-1 and COF-5, were respectively prepared by self-condensation of 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid and co-condensation of 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid with triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaol under solvothermal conditions (Fig. 1A).5 As shown, the boroxine-linked COF-1 features a 2D structure with staggered AB stacking mode, whereas the boronate ester-linked 2D COF-5 adopts an eclipsed AA stacking structure. Since then, COFs with different linkages and topologies have been synthesized one after another by various approaches including solvothermal,6–9 ionothermal,10,11 microwave,12,13 atmospheric solution,14–18 mechanochemical,19–21 electrochemical,22,23 photochemical,24,25 and other methods.26–29 The CURATED-COFs database30 established by Smit et al. has included 648 COFs as of June 2021. The variety of COFs has been still increasing rapidly since the release of this archive to date. A search of the Scopus (Elsevier B.V.) database on May 2, 2022 showed that the query string TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Covalent Organic Framework”) retrieved over 4300 research papers and close to 1000 patents, covering various subject areas such as chemistry, materials science, chemical engineering, and environmental science.31

The diverse linkage chemistry of COFs is the basis not only for investigating the structure–property relationship, but also for expanding the applications of COFs (Fig. 1B). Early studies focused on the COFs linked by dynamic covalent bonds. The reversibility of the linkages allows self-correction of defects formed during the reaction, resulting in COFs with ordered structures and thermodynamic stability. For example, the reversibility of the B–O bonds was essential for crystallinity of boronate ester-linked 3D COF-102 reported by Yaghi et al. in 2007.32 COFs linked by reversible imine bonds were first reported in 2009,33 which are one of the most reported subclasses of COFs to date due to the diversity of aromatic amine and aldehyde monomers. However, to some extent, the reversibility of the bonds reduces the chemical stability of the framework. To date, several irreversible linkages have been developed to synthesize COFs. For example, β-ketoenamine-linked COFs with high chemical stability can be synthesized by combining reversible Schiff base reactions and irreversible tautomerism reactions.34 Furthermore, when the ortho position of an aromatic amine is occupied by a nucleophilic group (e.g., –OH, –NH2, and –SH), the cascade reaction of imine condensation–oxidative cyclization can be used to obtain benzoxazole-, benzoimidazole-, and benzothiazole-linked COFs.35–37 Dioxin-linked COFs can be obtained by irreversible nucleophilic substitution reactions of fluorobenzenes and phenols.38 In 2022, pyridinium-linked COF films were synthesized via the irreversible Katritzky reaction of pyrylium and arylamines.39 Moreover, multicomponent reactions were used in the construction of chemically robust COFs. The three-component Strecker reaction, aza-Diels–Alder reaction, Debus–Radziszewski reaction, sulfur cyclization reaction, Groebke–Blackburn–Bienaymé reaction, A3-coupling reaction, and Kabachnik–Fields reaction have been used for COF synthesis with α-aminonitrile,40 quinoline,40 benzimidazole,41 benzothiazole,42 imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine,43 propargylamine44 and α-aminophosphonate45 linkages, respectively. In addition, the construction of COFs linked by amine,46,47 amide48,49 benzothiazole,50 and azo51 moieties based on post-synthetic modification of imine-linked COFs greatly enriched the variety of COFs.
In addition to linkages, the topology of COFs is also an important source of structural diversity of COFs (Fig. 1C). Based on the design strategy of modular condensation polymerization, at least 9 kinds of topologies of 2D monolayers, i.e., hcb,5,52sql,53,54kgm,55–58cem,59hxl,60cpi,61bex,62,63kgd,64–66 and tth,63,66 have been reported by combining more than one organic monomer or making the pore structure dissymmetric via changing the edge lengths and vertex angles.67 Moreover, the 2D monolayers may adopt different stacking modes in space, e.g., AA,5 AB,5,68,69 and ABC,70–74 further enriching the structural diversity of 2D COFs. Conversely, less than 100 different 3D COFs have been reported since the first report in 2007.32 The variety of reported 3D COFs is significantly less than that of 2D COFs largely due to their complicated structural determination and the limited availability of organic monomers that form highly connected 3D reticulations.75,76 However, 3D COFs have an abundant changeable topology.77 3D COFs with ctn,32,78bor,32dia,33,79rra,80pts,81–85lon,86ljh,87 and nbo88 topologies have been formed based on four-connected monomers with tetrahedral Td symmetry. Six-connected monomers with trigonal prism D3h symmetry led to stp,89ceq,90acs,91–93 and hea94 topologies, while D3d- and C3-symmetric six-connected monomers have been implemented in the synthesis of 3D COFs with pcu95 and soc96 topologies, respectively. Eight-connected building monomers produced 3D COFs with bcu97 and pcb98 topologies. Furthermore, by introducing specific geometric constraints into the monomers to control the spatial orientation of reactive groups in the monomers, the topological types of 3D COFs were further enriched, including ffc,99fjh,100 and tbo101 topologies formed by [4+3] condensation reactions and srs102 topology formed by [3+3] condensation reactions.
As crystalline porous materials, COFs have the advantages of modularity, crystallinity, porosity, and versatility.103–106 Generally, COFs are chemically stable in water and organic solvents as well as under acidic, alkaline, and oxidizing conditions. These features enable the use of COFs as functional materials for various applications under different conditions, including for adsorption and separation,107–111 catalysis,112–115 nanomedicine,116–120 sensing,121–124 photochemistry,125 electrochemistry,126 energy storage,127 and many others.
However, since COFs are metal-free, they cannot meet the requirement of applications that require the presence of metals. Recent studies revealed that COFs with potential coordination sites can act as supramolecular ligands and carriers to bind and stabilize metal ions or metal-containing nanoparticles, further enhancing the functionality of COF-based materials.128 Since metal species are not involved in the construction of the COF-backbones, the metalation does not generally affect their crystallinity and structural features, providing unparalleled flexibility for combining the advantages of COF and metal species.
Since the impressive example of a Pd(II)-coordinated COF reported in 2011,129 metalated COFs have undergone more than a decade of rapid development, particularly in the last 5 years, and numerous metalated COFs have been reported to date (Table 1).129–151 The metalated COFs display various properties that cover almost all possible application fields. Metalated COFs are being increasingly recognized as a new class of organic–inorganic hybrid materials.152,153 However, surveys of achievements related to metalated COFs are scattered in various review articles,67,77,154–176 and no comprehensive and complete review articles dedicated only to metalated COFs are currently available in the literature,128,177 hampering the further development of this promising and rapidly evolving field.

In this review, we provide an exhaustive and systematic overview and discussion of the metalated COFs that have been realized to date, including their synthetic strategies and cutting-edge applications in the past decade. Furthermore, the remaining challenges and personal perspectives on the further development of metalated COFs are presented. We are convinced that this timely review not only will inspire the researchers in the COF-field and the interdisciplinary areas of chemistry, materials science, but it can also be highly beneficial for the future design and development of functionalized COFs.
2. Synthetic strategy of metalated COFs
The methods for the introduction of metal ions into COFs through coordination, known as metalation,178 include both pre-synthetic and post-synthetic routes.179 In pre-synthetic metalation, the complexes are used directly as the monomers for the construction of COFs, and the amount and position of the metals in the COFs can be precisely controlled. However, the solubility and reactivity of the metalated monomers may be different from those of the metal-free monomers, so that the synthesis conditions of COFs must be optimized iteratively. In addition, for the complexes that are unstable under violent reaction conditions (e.g., solvothermal synthesis), it is difficult to avoid the leaching of metal ions. Fortunately, post-synthetic metalation provides an effective alternative approach for the synthesis of metal-modified COFs. Through either direct coordination or ligand exchange, metal ions can be anchored to COF-frameworks while maintaining the original crystallinity of COFs, and their contents can be regulated by simply changing the concentration and reaction time in the reaction system. During this process, the regularly arranged non-metal atoms in COFs act as a well-defined net that becomes a reticular chemical ligand for accurate capture of metal ions. Furthermore, since metal ions are not vital for the support of the COF-backbone, more than one metal can be easily embedded in the COFs as required and their content and ratio can be readily adjusted without affecting the crystallinity, providing unparalleled flexibility for combining the advantages of the COFs and the metals.
Depending on the position of the metal ions in the metalated COFs, metalated COFs can be divided into three categories: (i) metal ions are coordinated to the COF monomeric units; (ii) metal ions are coordinated to the linkages of the COFs; and (iii) metal ions are embedded in the COFs as nanoparticles. In this section, we will introduce these three types of metalated COFs, with a special focus on their structural and synthetic chemistry.
2.1. Metal–monomer coordination

2.1.1. Porphyrin. 
Porphyrins are a representative class of macrocyclic heterocyclic compounds formed by connecting the α-carbon atoms of four pyrrole subunits linked by methines (CH–).180 Due to their planar structure and easy functionalization, porphyrins have been widely used as monomers for the construction of COFs containing π-conjugated systems.181
Most of the reported porphyrin-COFs are based on porphyrins with C4 symmetry, such as 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin. Regarding topology, the [4+2] combination of square and linear monomers yielded a 2D sql network. In 2011, Yaghi et al. reported a typical 2D porphyrin-COF, COF-366, that was synthesized by the condensation of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin and terephthalaldehyde.182 Later, Jiang et al. synthesized the DhaTph COF using 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde rather than terephthalaldehyde in o-dichlorobenzene and ethanol solvents.183 Because the in-frame hydrogen bonds protect the imine from hydrolysis under acidic conditions, the DhaTph COF is chemically more stable than COF-366. In addition, the [4+4] combination of two square-planar molecules can also form a 2D sql network. As an example, COF-420 was synthesized by imine condensation between two porphyrin monomers, namely 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin.184,185 Similarly, H2P-TPE-COF186 and TTCOF-2H187 were synthesized by the [4+4] strategy based on porphyrins and rhombic monomers. Furthermore, the combination of planar porphyrins with tetrahedral molecules can provide 3D COFs. In 2017, Wang et al. reported the first 3D porphyrin-COF with pts topology through the [4+4] imine condensation of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin and tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)methane.188 In addition to C4 symmetry, porphyrins with C2 symmetry were also employed for the construction of COFs. For example, in 2013, Echegoyen et al. reported the CoPc-PorDBA COF with the sql topology in the P4/mmm space group based on the 5,15-bis(4-dioxylborylphenyl)porphyrin building block.189 One year later, Bein et al. obtained the TP-Por COF with the hcb topology by the [3+2] co-condensation of 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene and 5,15-bis(4-boronophenyl)porphyrin.190
An important structural advantage of porphyrins is that they have four pyrrolic nitrogen atoms arranged in squares that serve as effective chelating sites to trap metal ions, providing abundant possibilities for COF metalation (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Pre- and post-synthetic metalation of porphyrin-based COF-366. 
Metalated porphyrins (viz. metalloporphyrins) are used directly as monomers for the synthesis of COFs; this is referred to as pre-synthetic metalation. In 2013, Jiang and co-workers reported that the CuP-Ph COF was obtained by the reaction of copper 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin with terephthalaldehyde under solvothermal conditions.191 The replacement of half terephthalaldehyde with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde significantly increased the crystallinity of COFs, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area increased from 926 to 1389 m2 g−1, which is attributed to the self-complementary electronic interactions in the COFs. In the same year, the same group reported an additional squaraine-linked porphyrin-COF, namely, CuP-SQ, by the solvothermal reaction (o-dichlorobenzene/n-butanol, 85 °C, 7 days) of copper 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin with squaric acid in a high yield of 94%.192 Due to the π-conjugated linkage together with the eclipsed stacking mode, this COF possesses enhanced chemical and thermal stability.
Furthermore, 2D metalloporphyrin-COFs may be a diversified resource library for the development of ultrathin nanosheets and membranes with potentially enhanced functional performances due to the high accessibility of exposed metal sites on the surface. Very recently, Feng et al. employed the irreversible Katritzky reaction of zinc 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin with 4,4′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(2,6-diphenylpyrylium) tetrafluoroborate to prepare the pyridinium-linked C2DP-ZnPor COF films on the water surface.39 The obtained C2DP-ZnPor COF has a large crystal size of 30–80 μm2 and a thickness of approximately 25 nm. A square lattice with a cell parameter of 30.5 Å can be clearly observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). In addition to copper(II)101,145,188,193 and zinc(II) porphyrin,130,194,195 other metalloporphyrins such as cobalt(II),195–197 palladium(II),198 nickel(II),135,193,199,200 manganese(II),201 and iron(III) porphyrins202 can also tolerate the solvothermal conditions, and can be directly embedded into COFs by similar reactions, achieving the corresponding metalated COFs with unique properties that are not available in the metalloporphyrin monomers.
In addition to homometallic porphyrin-COFs, the construction of heterometallic porphyrin-COFs is also feasible through the use of mixed metalloporphyrin monomers. In 2019, Feng et al. reported heterometallic porphyrin-COFs that were prepared from tetraamino- and tetraformaldehyde-substituted porphyrins with different metal ions via the [4+4] imine condensation reactions.185 By adjusting the central metals in the metalloporphyrins, Por-COF-ZnCu and Por-COF-ZnNi can be obtained, enabling laser-induced nonlinear optical applications. Additionally, the metal content in the heterometallic COFs is adjustable due to the flexibility of the raw material ratios. For instance, Chang and co-workers employed the reaction of 4,4′-diformylbiphenyl with different ratios of cobalt 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin and copper 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin for the synthesis of COF-367-Co/Cu to achieve the controlled electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties.134
Besides direct polymerization of the metalloporphyrin monomers, post-synthetic modification is an additional powerful approach for COF metalation. For example, by refluxing metal-free 3D porphyrin-COF (PCOF-1) with ferrous chloride in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), the Fe-metalated PCOF-1-Fe COF was obtained, which was reported by Gu et al. in 2019.203 In addition, the authors prepared the cobalt-doped PCOF-1-Co in a similar way. The resulting PCOF-Fe exhibited considerable biocatalytic activity, and PCOF-Co had good electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution. Interestingly, the post-synthetic metalation of porphyrin-COFs sometimes can promote the exfoliation of bulk COFs. As shown in the recent reports by Osakada et al. in 2019204 and 2022,205 when the metal-free TphDha COF was refluxed with metal salts (e.g., Mg(ClO4)2 and CuSO4) in pyridine, the bulk TphDha COF was exfoliated into 2D nanosheets with a thickness of less than 3 nm due to the formation of metalloporphyrin and axial coordination of pyridine. When 4-methylpyridine and 4-ethylpyridine that are larger molecules than pyridine were used as the axial ligands, nanosheets with a thickness of only 1 nm were obtained. In conclusion, post-synthetic metalation circumvents the shortcomings of metalloporphyrin monomers in terms of stability and solubility.


2.1.2. Phthalocyanine. 
Phthalocyanine, as a derivative of tetraazaporphyrin, is a conjugated macrocyclic compound with 18π electrons that is composed of four isoindole rings connected by nitrogen atoms.206 The cavity with a diameter of approximately 2.7 Å in the center of the phthalocyanine ring can bind metal ions such as Cu(II), Zn(II), and Co(II) through four coordinate bonds to form highly stable metallophthalocyanines. Since their accidental synthesis in the early 20th century, metallophthalocyanines have been widely used in the dye industry and as photoelectric functional materials.207 To date, only octahydroxyphthalocyanine, hexadecafluorophthalocyanine, octaaminophthalocyanine and octacarboxyphthalocyanine tetraanhydrides have been used as monomers for the synthesis of metallophthalocyanine-COFs. The synthesis involved 6 types of condensation reactions and only three kinds of topological structures (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Metallophthalocyanine-based COFs. (A) Structures of metallophthalocyanine building blocks. (B) Schematic illustration of the metallophthalocyanine-involved condensation reactions. (C) Schematic diagram of sql, nbo, and pts topological structures. 
The first synthesis of phthalocyanine-COFs from 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxyphthalocyanines (or the corresponding acetonides) and linear diboronic acids was reported by the Dichtel group in 2010,208 while the corresponding metallophthalocyanine analogs (i.e., metallophthalocyanine-COFs) were reported by the same group in 2012.131 By varying the length of the diboronic acid monomers, the zinc(II) phthalocyanine-COFs with pore size in the range of 2.7–4.4 nm were obtained (Fig. 4). In addition to zinc(II) phthalocyanine, copper(II),209 nickel(II),209,210 and cobalt(II) phthalocyanine189,211 can also serve as metallomonomers for creating borate-linked COFs, which was demonstrated by Jiang and Echegoyen groups independently. For example, the reaction of copper(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxyphthalocyanine with N,N′-di(4-boronophenyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide led to DCuPc–APDI-COF, whereas the combination of nickel(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxyphthalocyanine with N,N′-di(4-boronophenyl)benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic diimide and N,N′-di(4-boronophenyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic diimide resulted in DNiPc–APyrDI-COF and DNiPc–ANDI-COF, respectively.209 These metalated donor–acceptor COFs have long charge separation lifetimes, whereas the photochemical dynamics properties are closely related to the embedded metal species, the acceptor species, and the local geometry between the donor and acceptor units. Furthermore, the CoPc-BPDA COF, a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine-COF, was prepared by the solvothermal reaction of cobalt(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxyphthalocyanine with [1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diyldiboronic acid, and it possesses moderate H2 (1.2 wt% at 77 K/1.0 bar) and CH4 (0.59 wt% at 273 K/1.0 bar) uptakes.211
 Fig. 4  Octahydroxyphthalocyanines for constructing borate-, spiroborate- and dioxin-linked COFs. 
An impressive Co(II)-metalated phthalocyanine-COF, namely SPB-COF-DBA,88 with nbo topology was reported by Cooper et al. in 2021 (Fig. 4). It was prepared by the reaction of cobalt(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxyphthalocyanine with trimethyl borate at 120 °C in N,N-dibutylformamide under self-generated pressure. In its framework, the adjacent cobalt(II) phthalocyanine species are located in two perpendicular planes and connected by the negatively charged spiroborate linkage, while the in situ generated dibutylammonium from N,N-dibutylformamide decomposition under the given conditions acts as the charge-balancing cation. Structural analysis by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) showed that SPB-COF-DBA crystallizes in a cubic symmetric structure with the cell parameter a = 34.744 Å and the Imm space group. In addition, the solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) signal of 11B is located at 14.0 ppm and the B–O stretching vibrations in the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum are located between 1026 and 1053 cm−1, indicating the formation of spiroborate. Interestingly, the counter ions in SPB-COF-DBA can be adjusted by changing the solvent systems. For example, the solvents dimethylamine and 1-methylpyrrolidin-2-one led to dimethylammonium, whereas the tetrabutylammonium hydroxide medium resulted in tetrabutylammonium as the counter cation. Although SPB-COF-DBA is more stable than some reported borate-linked COFs, it still cannot tolerate 1 M HCl due to the intrinsic susceptibility of the spiroborate linkage to acidic media.
For achieving chemically more stable COFs, the dioxin-linked metallophthalocyanine-COFs have been recently designed and synthesized (Fig. 4). In the late 2020, Lan and co-workers reported a series of NiPc–TFPN, CoPc–TFPN, and ZnPc–TFPN COFs based on irreversible aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions between 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxymetallophthalocyanines and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile under solvothermal conditions (N,N-dimethylacetamide/mesitylene, triethylamine, 150 °C).212 These dioxin-linked COFs display high crystallinity and exceptional stability. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the NiPc–TFPN COF is thermally stable up to 400 °C in nitrogen and up to 300 °C in oxygen. In addition, these COFs were able to withstand extreme environments, such as concentrated acids and bases, for at least 1 month without obvious loss of crystallinity. Furthermore, as shown by Zhang et al.,213 the CoPc–TFPN COF can maintain its crystallinity even in 30% H2O2 and 1 M NaBH4, with a weight loss of less than 10%. In 2021, heterometallic dioxin-linked COFs were synthesized by Huang et al. by the combination of cobalt(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxyphthalocyanine and copper(II) 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11,15,16,17,18,22,23,24,25-hexadecafluorophthalocyanine under solvothermal conditions.147 The obtained CuPcF8–CoPc-COF and CuPcF8–CoNPc-COF are chemically stable under harsh conditions. Moreover, their pseudo-AA stacking mode of metallophthalocyanine species enables a high-speed electron transfer pathway, resulting in that both metalated COFs exhibit satisfactory activity and selectivity toward electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in an aqueous solution. Of note, around 10% Cu(II) in CuPcF8–CoPc-COF was reduced to Cu(I) due to the reducibility of DMF and triethylamine. Follow-up studies have shown that the reaction at 180 °C with K2CO3 can effectively prevent Cu(II) reduction.214
Metalated octaaminophthalocyanines have recently been developed for the synthesis of pyrazine-linked COFs. In 2019, Mirica et al. reported COF-DC-8,215 which was obtained by the reaction of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octaaminophthalocyaninato nickel(II) and pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone in the solvent system of N,N-dimethylacetamide and o-dichlorobenzene with sulfuric acid under solvothermal conditions (202 °C, 10 days). Interestingly, microwave heating significantly shortened the reaction time to 10 h. In 2020, Jiang et al. synthesized CoPc-PDQ-COF, a Co-based analogue of COF-DC-8, in a mixture of ethylene glycol and N,N-dimethylacetamide with the aid of acetic acid at 200 °C for 7 days.216 CoPc-PDQ-COF, as a phenazine-linked stable and conductive COF, can be an ideal electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CO in aqueous media. Interestingly, a steric effect is present in pyrazine-linked phthalocyanine-COFs. By introducing bulky substituents (e.g., tert-butyl), COF layer stacking deviates from the classical AA mode, leading to slip stacking, which was recently observed by Feng et al.217 MPc-pz COFs (M = Zn, Cu) were synthesized by the condensation reaction of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octaaminophthalocyaninato zinc(II)/cooper(II) with 2,7-di-tert-butylpyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone/mesitylene (150 °C, 3 days) with p-toluenesulfonic acid (Fig. 5). The PXRD analysis combined with first-principles calculations showed that both COFs are consistent with a serrated AA stacking which was caused by the tert-butyl groups in pyrazine moieties. Subsequently, MPc-pz COFs (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Zn, Cu) were also prepared by the same group but using more soluble (diphenylmethylene)amino-substituted metallophthalocyanines as precursors. During the synthesis, 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octaaminometallophthalocyanines were in situ generated, thereby lowering the polymerization rates and providing pyrazine-linked COFs with superior crystallinity and high average crystal size.148 Recently, Cao et al. reported a nickel(II)-containing pyrazine-linked COF. As an isomorphic analogue of MPc-pz COFs, it also possesses a 2D layered structure with serrated AA stacking.218

In addition to the pyrazine-linked COFs, the piperazine-linked phthalocyanine-COF has also been reported by Huang and co-workers. By Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reaction of nickel(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octaaminophthalocyanine and cobalt(II) 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11,15,16,17,18,22,23,24,25-hexadecafluorophthalocyanine under solvothermal conditions (dioxane, triethylamine, 120 °C), the piperazine-linked heterometallic NiPc–NH–CoPcF8 COF was generated.219 NiPc–NH–CoPcF8 crystallized in the tetragonal P4/mmm space group, with AA stacking mode, a pore size of 1.1 nm, and an interlayer spacing of 3.6 Å. Not surprisingly, NiPc–NH–CoPcF8 is chemically stable toward water, common organic solvents, 6 M NaOH, and 6 M HCl.
In addition, the imide-linked metalated phthalocyanine-COFs also appeared in the recent literature.220 In 2021, Jiang and co-workers employed cobalt(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octacarboxyphthalocyanine tetraanhydrides to react with benzene-1,4-diamine in the binary solvent of N-methylpyrrolidone and n-butanol under the catalysis of isoquinoline at 180 °C for 5 days to synthesize imide-linked COFs. The obtained CoPc–PI-COF-1 was indexed to the eclipsed AA-stacking structure in the P4/mmm space group with the cell parameters a = b = 21.02 Å and c = 3.34 Å. Moreover, attempts to replace benzene-1,4-diamine with benzidine resulted in CoPc–PI-COF-2 with a similar structure to that of CoPc–PI-COF-1. In the same year, Jiang and co-workers used the same cobalt(II) phthalocyanine monomer but with 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(adamantane-1,3,5,7-tetrayl)tetraaniline with the Td molecular symmetry to get a Co-metalated phthalocyanine-based 3D COF.85 The generated CoPc–PI-COF-3 has a three-fold interpenetrated pts topology with the cell parameters a = b = 24.6 Å, c = 44.4 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. The evaluation of chemical stability showed that CoPc–PI-COF-1, CoPc–PI-COF-2, and CoPc–PI-COF-3 are stable in 12 M HCl, 0.5 M KHCO3 and various organic solvents for at least 20 days.
In addition to the direct polymerization of metallophthalocyanine monomers, the metallophthalocyanine-COFs can also be synthesized from the in situ polymerization of the phthalocyanine precursors with metal templates. In 2019, Xiang et al. employed the one-pot in situ reaction of benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarbonitrile and FeCl3 or CuCl2 with the 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) catalyst under either microwave heating (180 °C, 15 min) or solvothermal conditions (180 °C, 3 days) to generate a fully closed conjugated planar COFBTC.221 Notably, the addition of 3,6-dihydroxyphthalonitrile to the reaction system could decrease the condensation reaction rate, consequently, controlling the particle size of the phthalocyanine-COFs.222 Compared with the COFs directly obtained from phthalocyanine monomers, the metallophthalocyanine-COFs synthesized by this method have better aqueous dispersibility but worse crystallinity.
Of note, the metallophthalocyanine-COFs with 5th and 6th period metals (e.g., Pt, Rh, Ag, W, Ta, Mo, Os, and Re) have been predicted based on first-principles density functional theory calculations,223 but their synthesis still remains blank.


2.1.3. Naphthalocyanine. 
Naphthalocyanine is an analog of phthalocyanine that can be regarded as tetrabenzophthalocyanine. In 2021, Huang et al. first synthesized naphthalocyanine-COFs, including NiPcF8–NiNPc-COF, CoPcF8–CoNPc-COF, CuPcF8–CuNPc-COF, and CuPcF8–CoNPc-COF, using the solvothermal reaction of 3,4,12,13,21,22,30,31-octahydroxylnaphthalocyanines with 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11,15,16,17,18,22,23,24,25-hexadecafluorophthalocyanines under alkaline conditions (Fig. 6).147 All of these naphthalocyanine-COFs are linked by a dioxin linkage and have the AA stacking mode, exhibiting strong stability under harsh conditions.

2.1.4. 2,2′-Bipyridine. 
As one of the most common classes of bidentate N,N′-type ligands, 2,2′-bipyridines, which are easily functionalized at the 5,5′-positions, are ideal candidates for the synthesis of metalated COFs (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Post-synthetic metalation of the TpBpy COF via coordination reaction of the metal ion and ligand exchange reaction of the coordination compound. 
The solvothermal synthesis of metallobipyridine-COFs using 2,2′-bipyridine complexes is sometimes limited by their chemical stability. As revealed by Banerjee et al. in 2017, the solvothermal reaction (N,N-dimethylacetamide/1,4-dioxane, HOAc, 90 °C, 3 days) of (5,5′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine)dichloropalladium(II) with 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde caused the Pd(II) reduction during the COF formation, and Pd nanoparticle-loaded Pd@TpBpy was obtained.224 However, the mechanochemical synthesis can circumvent this issue, but the obtained Pd(II)-metalated Pd-TpBpy COF has poor crystallinity.225 In addition, the room temperature synthesis of COFs is also a feasible approach,226 but may not meet the high crystallinity requirements of most COFs. The attempt to synthesize Re(I)-chelated 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs, however, was successful.227 Marinescu and co-workers revealed that the reaction of tricarbonylchloro(5,5′-dicarbaldehyde-2,2′-bipyridine)rhenium(I) and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin in o-dichlorobenzene/n-butanol at 120 °C for 2 days could successfully give Re-BpyPor-COF, which may be attributed to the acceptable chemical stability of the rhenium complex under the given conditions. In addition, attempts for direct synthesis of the Co(II)-coordinated 2,2′-bipyridine-COF on the surface of CdS nanowires have also been successfully achieved by Wang et al. recently.228
By comparison, post-synthetic metalation of 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs is a scalable method. On the one hand, metal ion-coordinated 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs can be directly obtained by reacting metal-free 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs with the corresponding metal salts. As reported by the Kurungot group in 2016,136 Co(II)-metalation of the imine-linked TpBpy COF that was formed from 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde and [2,2′-bipyridine]-5,5′-diamine can be easily realized in a Co(CH3COO)2 methanol solution via the 2,2′-bipyridine-cobalt(II) coordination. In the solid ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV-vis DRS) of the cobalt(II)-chelated Co-TpBpy COF, new strong absorption bands appear at 470 and 510 nm, corresponding to the charge-transfer transition. Similarly, other metal ions, such as Fe(III),229 Cu(II),230–232 Ag(I),233 and rare earth ions,146 can also be introduced into 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs by the same post-synthetic metalation approach. In addition, when two metal salts are used, the heterobimetallic 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs can be easily obtained, which was well demonstrated by Sun et al.234 On the other hand, the ligand exchange between 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs and metal-complexes is an additional feasible approach for the preparation of metalated 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs. As shown by Huang and co-workers in 2018,141 by the reaction of the established TTA-BPDA-COF—which was generated from 4,4′,4′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline and [2,2′-bipyridine]-5,5′-dicarbaldehyde—with Re(CO)5Cl under reflux in toluene, the two coordinated CO ligands were exchanged by the 2,2′-bipyridine moieties on TTA-BPDA-COF, thus anchoring Re(I) as Re(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Cl on the pore walls of the COF. As shown, the existence of the Re(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Cl structural unit was supported by X-ray absorption and ssNMR spectra. Briefly, post-synthetic metalation is a general and versatile method for 2,2′-bipyridine-COF metalation that has been widely used for the synthesis of metalated 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs, as summarized in Table 2.136,141,146,229–254

Different from the metalloporphyrin- and metallophthalocyanine-COFs, the metalated 2,2′-bipyridine-COFs might possess higher activity due to their often existent coordinatively unsaturated metal centers. However, the free rotation of the pyridine rings in 2,2′-bipyridine monomers could sometimes lead to weak coordination interactions between metal ions and N donors, which would cause the metal ions to leach from COF-scaffolds. This has a negative impact on the stability of metallo-2,2′-bipyridine-COFs, consequently, limiting their application, especially in catalysis under relatively harsh conditions.


2.1.5. 1,10-Phenanthroline. 
1,10-Phenanthroline is a 2,2′-bipyridine analog but with rotationally restricted pyridine rings. It is found that 1,10-phenanthroline monomers can coordinate with metal ions in the form of V-shaped 2,9-disubstituted- or linear 3,8-disubstituted-1,10-phenanthrolines.
In 2016, Yaghi et al. reported COF-505-Cu as the first example of woven COFs via the reaction of the V-shaped 2,9-disubstituted-1,10-phenanthroline tetrahedral complexes with a linear monomer (Fig. 8A).137 The Cu(PDB)2BF4 monomer from 4,4′-(1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-diyl)dibenzaldehyde (PDB) and Cu(CH3CN)4BF4 possesses a stable coordination conformation with the four terminal aldehyde groups in a well-defined tetrahedral configuration. Under solvothermal conditions, the Cu(PDB)2BF4 units were connected by the imine linkages formed with linear benzidine into a weaving COF-505-Cu with the dia topology. Furthermore, Cu(I), which was located at the intersection of the two organic threads, can be removed by heating COF-505-Cu in the KCN–CH3OH–H2O system. The demetalated COF-505 has a flexible structure with a high degree of freedom, and thus, leading to a more elastic COF-505 than COF-505-Cu. In addition, treatment of COF-505 with Cu(CH3CN)4BF4 leads to its re-metalation without loss of crystallinity. Unfortunately, COF-505 has a two-fold interpenetrated framework structure with low porosity, which is not favorable for loading guest species and functionalization. In 2018, by using a similar synthetic method, but replacing BF4− with the bulky diphenylphosphinate anion (Ph2PO2−), COF-506-Cu was obtained in which the internal space is occupied by larger Ph2PO2−, resulting in a non-interpenetrating network.255 As expected, anionic dyes, such as methyl orange and hydroxynaphthol blue, can be encapsulated by COF-506-Cu by exchanging with Ph2PO2−. In addition, the crystallinity of COF-506 after demetalation is extremely reduced, which is clearly attributed to the fact that COF-506 has a larger internal space and is more flexible than COF-505. It is interesting to note that the replacement of the metal ions in COF-505 and COF-506 may endow them with novel properties; this is currently under investigation.256,257

Additionally, the same group also examined the assembly of tetrahedral cationic Cu(PDB)2+ with rectangular tetraamino-substituted monomers.258 As shown in Fig. 8B, the 60° angle between the two aldehyde groups in Cu(PDB)2PO2Ph2 and the 120° angle between the two amino groups of 4′,4′′′,4′′′′′,4′′′′′′′-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetrakis(([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine)) are well complementary, resulting in the formation of quadrilateral macrocycles. These macrocycles are connected by CC double bonds in the rectangular monomers, further leading to corner-sharing 1D square ribbons. The two 1D square ribbons are interlocked via the Cu(I)–biphenanthroline node in an orthogonal manner, thus yielding a woven 3D COF with pts topology.
Furthermore, the combination of two tetrahedral metal-complexes can also afford woven COFs (Fig. 9A). By imine condensation between amino- and methylal-functionalized Cu(I)–1,10-phenanthroline complexes, wCOF-Cu with a 3D weaving network was synthesized by Loh et al.259 Its crystal structure was determined by combining 3D electron diffraction and PXRD data, and it was found that wCOF-Cu crystallizes in dia topology with a 3-fold interpenetrated structure. Interestingly, the dynamic ligand exchange between homoleptic complexes and another ligand led to heteroleptic complexes, in which two kinds of functional groups are essential to complete the synthetic reaction of COFs, enabling the formation of a 1D metallopolymer. Based on this strategy, wCOF-Cu was synthesized by ligand exchange–imine condensation between bis[4,4′-(1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-diyl)dianiline]copper(I) tetrafluoroborate and 2,9-bis(4-(dimethoxymethyl)phenyl)-1,10-phenanthroline. Structurally, the 1D zigzag chains consisting of bis(2,9-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)copper(I) structural units linked by imine bonds are stacked via the hydrogen bonding between amine groups and tetrafluoroborate anions and the π–π stacking of the adjacent phenanthroline plane to form mCOF-Cu. Due to the existence of amine-enriched channels in mCOF-Cu, Pt(II) can be easily immobilized inside through N–Pt interaction to afford heterobimetallic Pt/mCOF-Cu for potential catalytic application.

Furthermore, mCOF-Ag,260 an isostructural analogue of mCOF-Cu, has also been obtained from AgBF4, 2,9-bis(4-(dimethoxymethyl)phenyl)-1,10-phenanthroline, and 4,4′-(1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-diyl)dianiline through in situ metal–ligand coordination and subsequent imine condensation reaction. The free amino groups in mCOF-Ag can be cross-linked with glyoxal to form 3D wCOF-Ag (Fig. 9B), and the covalent cross-linked structure formed in this process leads to the increased Young's modulus of wCOF-Ag.
Besides V-shaped 2,9-disubstituted-1,10-phenanthrolines, linear 3,8-disubstituted-1,10-phenanthrolines can also be used for the construction of metalated COFs. Very recently, Mas-Ballesté and Alemán et al. reported the 3,8-disubstituted-1,10-phenanthroline-based Phen-COF by the reaction of 4,4′-(1,10-phenanthroline-3,8-diyl)dibenzaldehyde with 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene under solvothermal conditions (1,4-dioxane/mesitylene, acetic acid, 120 °C, 3 days) (Fig. 10).261,262 Phen-COF crystallizes in the Amm2 space group with a layered eclipsed structure. The phenanthroline moiety in Phen-COF is a potential chelating site that can coordinate with a variety of metal ions via post-synthetic metalation. For example, by the combination of Phen-COF with palladium acetate in acetonitrile/water at 70 °C, 26 mol% of the phenanthrolines are chelated with Pd(II) and the palladium content is up to 4.4 wt%.262 In addition to homometalation, the authors also reported the heterometalation of Phen-COF. By the reaction of tetrakis[2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine-C2′,N](μ-dichloro)diiridium(III) and dichloro(dimethoxyethane)nickel(II) with Phen-COF under the given conditions, the iridium(III)- and nickel(II)-coexistent Phen-COF was generated, in which 15 and 30 mol% of the phenanthrolines coordinate with the iridium(III) and nickel(II) ions, respectively.261

2.1.6. 1H-Pyrazole. 
In addition to homometallic and heterometallic COFs, the COFs from functionalized polynuclear complex monomers have also been reported recently (Fig. 11). A representative example was reported by Li and co-workers in 2021.263 By the combination of tris(4-formyl-μ2-pyrazolato-N,N′)tricopper(I) (Cu3Pz3) and 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene or 4,4′,4′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline under solvothermal conditions (mesitylene/dioxane, acetic acid, 120 °C, 72 h), JNM-1 and JNM-2 were generated as light green solid powders. They all crystallized in the hexagonal system with the P6 space group. Structural analysis revealed that JNM-1 and JNM-2 adopt an eclipsed AA stacking mode with a pore width of approximately 18.9 Å. In addition, both JNM-1 and JNM-2 exhibited good thermostability and chemical stability toward air and water. Of note, JNM-1 and JNM-2 possessed reversible redox behavior. With the aid of an oxidant, the Cu(I) ions in JNM-1 were partly oxidized to Cu(II), and JNM-1 could be completely regenerated by treating it with 1-methylpyrrolidin-2-one at 160 °C. Furthermore, JNM-1 and JNM-2 were also prepared by the one-pot in situ reactions of 1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde, Cu2O and the corresponding triamine monomers, but the materials obtained by this method contain Cu2O which is difficult to remove.
 Fig. 11  Trinuclear copper(I)–pyrazolate complex as a metalated monomer for constructing a variety of metalated COFs. 
Later on, a different imine-linked 2D COF based on the same aldehyde-functionalized trinuclear copper(I)-complex with a diamine monomer was reported.264 As shown, the mechanochemical reaction of Cu3Pz3 and benzene-1,4-diamine with p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in trace water and subsequent heat treatment at 170 °C afforded FDM-71. Further analysis showed that vacancy defects are present in FDM-71 due to the missing monomers, leading to the presence of unreacted amino and aldehyde groups in the scaffold, consistent with the obtained FT-IR and ssNMR spectra.
In addition, Li et al. revealed that the stacking mode of Cu3Pz3-based COFs is acid-dependent, which is rarely observed in reticular chemistry.265 With the aid of trifluoroacetic acid and acetic acid, the solvothermal reactions of Cu3Pz3 with anthracene-2,6-diamine in mesitylene/dioxane led to AA-stacked JNM-3-AA and ABC-stacked JNM-3-ABC, respectively. Interestingly, immersion of JNM-3-ABC in trifluoroacetic acid could trigger a stacking mode transformation from ABC to AA within 30 min, while the soaking of JNM-3-AA in a methanol solution of sodium methoxide could not trigger this structural transformation, indicating that strong interlayer Cu⋯Cu interactions facilitate the formation of eclipsed stacking mode based on the computational simulations.


2.1.7. Catecholate. 
It is well-known that the o-dihydroxy on catechol (viz. 1,2-dihydroxybenzene) provides an open chelate site for metal ion binding. In 2014, Jiang and co-workers demonstrated that the catechol moiety could be introduced into the COFs.266 Recently, by solvothermal reactions of 2,3-dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde with 4,4′,4′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline, 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(pyrene-1,3,6,8-tetrayl)tetraaniline, and 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetraaniline, Ma and Zhao et al. successfully synthesized the TAPT-2,3-DHTA COF,267 the PyTTA-2,3-DHTA COF,268 and COF-ETTA-2,3-Dha,269 respectively, in which the coordination sites are ordered on the pore walls and structurally predesignable for binding metal ions (Fig. 12). For example, the TAPT-2,3-DHTA COF and the PyTTA-2,3-DHTA COF can be further metalated by bis(2,4-pentanedionato)vanadium(IV) oxide in an inert atmosphere (50 °C, 24 h) to yield oxyvanadium(IV)-loaded VO-TAPT-2,3-DHTA and VO-PyTTA-2,3-DHTA with 4.9 and 3.8 wt% of vanadium, respectively.267,268 The vibrational peak at 970 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectra clearly supports the existence of the VO bonds, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) analyses demonstrate the oxidation state of V to be +4. Furthermore, COF-ETTA-2,3-Dha with a heteropore structure was used as an efficient adsorbent to adsorb Cd(II) from water based on the Cd–O interaction, showing saturation adsorption capacity as high as 116 mg g−1.269

Moreover, monomer-exchange on the established COF is also a useful approach to access the COFs with open docking sites. For example, Tang and co-workers introduced 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde into COF-LZU1 by solvent-assisted monomer-exchange.270 The original benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde in the COF-skeleton was partially replaced by 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde to afford defective LZU-OH with a catechol moiety. As expected, the obtained LZU-OH can bind metal ions to afford the metalated LZU-OM (M = Fe, Mn, V).
More recently, Gu et al. demonstrated that the Ti(IV)–catechol complex can also be used to construct titanium-metalated COFs (Fig. 13).96 The octahedral titanium complex Na2Ti(2,3-DHTA)3 with C3 symmetry, which was synthesized in acetonitrile by the reaction of 2,3-dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde and bis(acetylacetonato)oxotitanium(IV), reacted with 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(pyrene-1,3,6,8-tetrayl)tetraaniline under solvothermal conditions (mesitylene/o-dichlorobenzene/acetonitrile, acetic acid, 120 °C, 7 days) to afford the desired Ti-COF-1. Ti-COF-1 is an anionic framework with Na(I) as the equilibrium cation. Ti-COF-1 with the I23 space group has an edge-transitive (6,4)-connected net, in which the [TiO6] clusters occupy eight vertices and the pyrene-1,3,6,8-tetrayltetrakis(benzene-4,1-diyl) moiety serves as the six faces to form [Ti8] cubic cages with a pore diameter of 14 Å. Every four [Ti8] cubic cages are separated by two perpendicular channels with a diameter of 16 Å to generate a 3D reticular structure with the soc topology. Consistent with its microporous framework, Ti-COF-1 shows a typical type I N2 adsorption and desorption isotherm with a BET specific surface area of 1000 m2 g−1 and a pore size of 1.55 nm.

2.1.8. Triphenylphosphine. 
Triphenylphosphine (PPh3), a common ligand in organometallic chemistry, has only recently been employed for COF metalation.271,272 Two examples of P(III)-containing COFs, P-COF-1 and P-COF-2, were synthesized by Fan and co-workers via the reaction of 4,4′,4′′-phosphanetriyltribenzaldehyde with benzene-1,4-diamine or benzidine under solvothermal conditions.273 Theoretically, due to the presence of a lone electron pair on P, COF-1 and P-COF-2 readily coordinate with acetylacetonatodicarbonylrhodium(I) to form Rh–P-COF-1 and Rh–P-COF-2. The vibrational absorption due to the Rh–P bond was observed at 442 cm−1 by FT-IR spectroscopy, suggesting the interaction of Rh-species with P. Although the coordination mode and distribution of Rh(I) with the COFs have not been fully investigated, this provides a possible way for enriching the range of applications of COFs as supramolecular ligands.


2.1.9. N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC). 
In addition to the metal–heteroatom coordination, the organometallic metal–carbon coordination can also be used to realize COF metalation. As we know, NHCs are classified as stable nitrogen heterocyclic compounds characterized by a divalent carbon atom with a six-electron valence shell.274 Due to their distinct σ-donor properties, NHCs are widely employed as ligands to bind transition metals to access NHC–metal complexes (NHC–M).275 An unavoidable challenge in constructing COFs with NHC or NHC–M monomers is their stability under solvothermal conditions.276
Recently, Dong et al. reported a NHC–AuCl-COF by direct polymerization of chloro[1,3-diethyl-4,7-bis(4-formylphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) with 4,4′,4′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline under solvothermal conditions (Fig. 14A).277 The obtained NHC–AuCl-COF possesses a staggered AB stacking mode with a pore size of 2.8 nm. Of note, the Au content in NHC–AuCl-COF is up to 23.4 wt%, which is very close to the theoretical value of 24.1 wt%, implying that the NHC–Au moiety is stable under solvothermal conditions. The only existence of Au(I) rather than Au(0) in NHC–AuCl-COF, which is determined by XPS, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), further supported the above presumption. The direct polymerization of NHC–M monomers for synthesis of metalated COFs ensures not only a high loading content of NHC–M species but also their uniform distribution in the COF matrix.
 Fig. 14  NHC–M-based COFs. (A) Synthesis of NHC–AuCl-COF using the NHC–Au-loaded complex as a monomer. (B) Synthesis of COF-NHC–Pd via post-synthetic metalation. 
Compared to direct synthesis, post-synthetic metalation is also a practical approach to access NHC–M-based COFs. Using this strategy, Wang et al. reported a NHC–Pd(II)-loaded COF with pre-embedded imidazolium (Fig. 14B).278 Specifically, the ionothermal reaction of 1,1′-((4,4′′-diformyl-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-2′,5′-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(3-propyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium) hexafluorophosphate with benzene-1,3,5-triamine at room temperature generated COF-NHC, which after combination with palladium acetate in acetonitrile at 75 °C for 3 h afforded the NHC–Pd(II)-loaded COF-NHC–Pd with a Pd content of up to 20.1 wt%. Other types of NHC–M such as NHC–Ru can also be introduced into the COF-frameworks by this method, which was reported by Lotsch and co-workers recently.279


2.1.10. Dehydrobenzoannulene. 
Metal–carbon π-complexes are valuable raw materials for many synthetic reactions and key intermediates in various catalytic processes.280 Although they have been known from the early days in organometallic chemistry, they have only recently been integrated into COFs.
McGrier et al. first reported 2D COFs containing C3-symmetric π-conjugated planar triangular dehydrobenzoannulenes which are potential sites for metal binding via π–d interactions.281,282 Later on, the McGrier group reported that the polymerization of (methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene-4,1-diyl))tetraboronic acid and 5,6,11,12,17,18-hexadehydro-2,3,8,9,14,15-hexahydroxytribenzo[a,e,i]cyclododecene generated the green DBA-3D-COF with a bor topological network (Fig. 15).138 As an electron-rich COF-ligand, DBA-3D-COF can be further metalated by the reaction with bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) to afford purple Ni-DBA-3D-COF but without loss of its structural feature and crystallinity. Spectroscopy analysis indicated that Ni-DBA-3D-COF displayed an additional charge-transfer absorption band at 500–650 nm, implying that the alkynyl provided 2e− to form a 16-electron complex. Moreover, the fluorescence of DBA-3D-COF at 510 nm was quenched after metalation, further supporting the formation of a Ni(0) complex.

Similarly, in 2020, the same group reported that DBA-2D-COF constructed from 5,6,11,12,17,18-hexadehydro-2,8,14-triformyltribenzo[a,e,i]cyclododecene and hydrazine was also used as a COF-ligand for Ni(0) loading.283 After treatment with bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) in toluene, approximately 64 mol% of dehydrobenzoannulenes in DBA-2D-COF were metalated as the Ni(0)–triethyne complex.

2.2. Metal–linkage coordination
In addition to organic ligand-based COF metalation, the electron-enriched COF-linkages, such as imine, β-ketoenamine, and acylhydrazone, can also act as the active coordination sites for metal binding to access COF metalation (Fig. 16). This approach might overcome to some extent the limitation of the aforementioned COF metalation methods, but the precise locations and coordination modes for the loaded metals in COF-frameworks sometimes cannot be clearly demonstrated.
 Fig. 16  Coordinate interaction of metal ions with the linkages of COFs. 

2.2.1. Imine linkage. 
Since the first report of COF-300 in 2009,33 imine-linked COFs have become the most abundant and well-studied subclass of COFs. Imine bonds have abundant reaction chemistry and their various chemical transformations are an effective approach to realize the further functionalization of imine-linked COFs.284 Besides, the regularly arranged imine linkage in COF-frameworks provides useful coordination sites for COF metalation by imine–metal coordination.
In a pioneering work by Wang et al. in 2011,129 the imine-linked COF-LZU1 was successfully metalated by Pd(II) via mixing of Pd(CH3COO)2 with COF-LZU1 in dichloromethane for 24 h under ambient conditions. The authors demonstrated that the loaded Pd(II) ions (7.1 wt%) are located between the 2D COF-layers and fixed by the interlayer N–Pd–N interactions in Pd/COF-LZU1 (type I in Fig. 16). The Pd(II) bonding energy by XPS is 337.7 eV, similar to that of diacetato(1,10-phenanthroline)palladium(II) (337.8 eV), but lower than that of Pd(CH3COO)2 (338.4 eV). Later on, Jiang and co-workers used a similar method to load Pd(II) in H2P-Bph-COF with a Pd content of 12.9 wt%.285
The rationality of this coordination mode was further bolstered by subsequent research. In 2021, Karim et al. reported PdCl2@ILCOF-1 and studied the local coordination and electronic property of Pd(II) in ILCOF-1 (Fig. 17).286 The obtained PdCl2@ILCOF-1 product is a dark brown powder with a Pd content of 18.1% based on ICP–OES analysis. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Pd K-edge showed that the spectral pattern of PdCl2@ILCOF-1 is quite different from that of PdO, while it is similar but still not identical to that of PdCl2. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra suggested that Pd(II) is bound to two N and two Cl atoms at the distances of 2.31 Å and 2.03 Å, respectively, revealing that Pd(II) lies in a tetracoordinated sphere. Furthermore, based on the diffuse-reflectance FT-IR spectrum, the adsorption of CO by PdCl2@ILCOF-1 at −40 °C only resulted in a narrow peak at 2130 cm−1 with a full width at half maximum of approximately 20 cm−1 with no other CO band observed, strongly suggesting a single local coordination environment for Pd(II) in PdCl2@ILCOF-1.

When Pd(II) is doped into COFs by the one-pot method, the coordination mode of Pd(II) differs from that of post-synthetic metalation. Investigation of the TAPB-BTCA COF prepared by [3+3] condensation of 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene and benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde showed that with the increase of local defects (e.g., –NH2) in the COF, Pd(II) tends to simultaneously coordinate with the amino N and imine N between the adjacent layers (type II in Fig. 16) rather than with imine N exclusively.287 Given the prevalence of defects in COFs, this may provide a new perspective for the optimization of the in situ and post-synthetic metalation of COFs.
In fact, the COF–metal coordination, which largely depends on the metal coordination preference and the coordinating nature of COF-ligands, is complicated. For example, the loaded Pt(II) ions in COF-UARK-49-Pt288 are located in a planar quadrilateral coordination environment formed by two Cl−, one DMSO, and one imine N donors (type III in Fig. 16). Furthermore, during the post-synthetic metalation of Py-1P with [Cp*IrCl2]2 (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl),289 the authors found that the loaded Ir(III) not only coordinates to imine N and Cp* ring, but also forms a C–Ir bond with the phenyl ring attached to imine in Py-1P-Ir (type IV in Fig. 16). All these observations were respectively reported by Moghadam288 and Beyzavi289 groups very recently.
In addition, the bisimine-assisted metalation has been reported recently (type V in Fig. 16). In 2021, Van Der Voort et al. found that the bisimine-functionalized Ace-COF could be readily metalated by simple post-synthetic wet impregnation with NiCl2 under ambient conditions with a Ni content of 1.0 mmol g−1.290 XPS analysis elucidated the interaction between N and Ni(II). Upon the introduction of Ni(II), the N 1s XPS peak shifts toward higher binding energy, and the Ni 2p peak is located at 856 eV and is distinguished from the Ni(0) and NiO peaks.
The electron-rich substituents, e.g., hydroxyl and phenolate (type VI in Fig. 16), on the monomer adjacent to the imine can participate in metal ion coordination to provide the chelating coordination sites for binding metal ions to achieve COF metalation. For example, by refluxing RIO-12 with NiCl2 in ethanol with K2CO3, Esteves and co-workers successfully synthesized NiCl@RIO-12 with 3.6–25 wt% of Ni(II) by varying the NiCl2 dosage.291 Using the same approach, Ji et al. reported a Pd(II)-decorated Pd/COF-BTDH.292 The research demonstrated that both imine nitrogen and hydroxy oxygen were coordinated to Pd(II) inside the pores and the ordered channel structure played an important role in regulating the regioselectivity for the oxidative Heck reaction. In addition to Ni(II) and Pd(II), the Cu(II) grafting on this type of COF can also be realized. In 2020, Gao and co-workers reported the Cu@T-D COF by metalating the (E)-1-((phenylimino)methyl)naphthalen-2-ol moiety in the T-D COF.293 Since the T-D COF contains pyridyl donors, the definite location of Cu(II) deserves further study.

N,N′-Bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamino (salen), containing an N,N′,O,O′-planar coordination pocket, is an important class of bisimine ligands formed by 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and ethylenediamine at a molar ratio of 2:1. A variety of metal ions, e.g., Cu(II), Zn(II), Fe(III), Al(III), V(IV), and Sn(IV), can be readily embedded in the salen pocket, which yields tetradentate MN2O2 or pentadentate MN2O2A (M = metal ion, A = axial ligand) metallosalen.294 Due to the strong ability to accommodate metal ions, the COFs generated from salen monomers are an ideal class of platforms to realize metalation of COFs. In 2017, Wang et al. first reported the salen-linked COFs and their post-synthetic metalation (type VII in Fig. 16).295 As shown in Fig. 18A, Salen-COF1 was prepared by the imine condensation of C3-symmetric salicylaldehyde with ethylenediamine under solvothermal conditions (dioxane/ethanol, acetic acid, 120 °C, 3 days). The structural analysis indicated that the AA stacked 2D salen-COF crystallized in the P321 space group with an interlayer spacing of 3.4 Å. Due to the large BET specific surface area (1366 m2 g−1), pore volume (0.73 cm3 g−1), and pore size (2.5 nm), Salen-COFs allow the metal ions to diffuse into the COF-framework and trap them by the salen linkage. As expected, a series of metal ions, including Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Co(II), and Mn(II), can be loaded on Salen-COF1 in the ratio of 64–88% under given conditions, indicating that Salen-COF1 is an ideal platform for metal ion immobilization. Of note, the oxidation of Co(II)-loaded salen-COF with air led to the formation of Co(III)-loaded salen-COF that is difficult to be prepared by direct impregnation due to the unavailability of Co(III) salts.296

(B) Synthesis of metalated salen-based chiral COFs (CCOFs) via in situ self-assembly and post-synthetic metal exchange. (C) Synthesis of metallosalphen-based 3D COFs via post-synthetic metalation. 
In addition to post-synthetic metalation, metal ions can also be introduced into the salen moiety by the one-pot in situ method while forming COFs. The involved metal ions may serve as a template to facilitate COF formation and crystallization. In 2017, Cui and co-workers presented such an example, in which 1,3,5-tri(3-formyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)benzene or 1,3,5-tri(3-(tert-butyl)-5-formyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)benzene, zinc acetate, and (1R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine were employed to synthesize Zn(II)-loaded chiral CCOF3 and CCOF4 (Fig. 18B).297 CCOF4 is chemically more stable than CCOF3 due to the steric hindrance of tert-butyl, and shows a wide range of reaction chemistry. For example, when CCOF4 is immersed in saturated solutions of metal salts—such as CrCl2, Fe(CH3COO)2, Mn(CH3COO)2, bis(2,4-pentanedionato)vanadium(IV), and Co(CH3COO)2—the target ions underwent ion exchange with Zn(II) along with an oxidation process—except for V(IV)—to afford a series of heterobimetallic CCOF4-M (M = Cr(III), Co(III), Mn(III), Fe(III), V(IV)) with the Zn(II) to M ratio in the range of 1:12 to 1:54. The residual Zn(II) in CCOF4-Cr(III) can be further exchanged by M′ to give heterotrimetallic CCOF4-Cr-M′ (M′ = Fe(III), Mn(III), Co(III)). In addition, V(IV) in CCOF4-V was oxidized to V(V) by 3-chlorobenzoperoxoic acid. During ion exchange processes, the structural integrity and crystallinity of these chiral salen-COFs are maintained. Furthermore, the Zn(II)-metalated 3D salen-COFs with a seven-fold interpenetrating structure were also reported by the same group in 2019.298
The analogue of salen, N,N′-bis(salicylideneimine)-1,2-diaminobenzo (salphen), has also been used to construct metalated 3D COFs (type VIII in Fig. 16). As reported by Fang et al. in 2019,299 the non-interpenetrated dia salphen-based JUC-509 COF, obtained by the assembly of 4,5-dichlorobenzene-1,2-diamine with 5,5′,5′′,5′′′-methanetetrayltetrakis(2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) under solvothermal conditions (mesitylene/dioxane, acetic acid, 120 °C, 3 days), can be metalated by Mn(II), Cu(II), and Eu(III) via post-synthetic wet impregnation (Fig. 18C). Furthermore, Gu et al. recently reported a heteropore salphen-COFHATP-DMDBvia the solvothermal reaction of triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine and 4,6-dihydroxy-5-methylisophthalaldehyde. As expected, it can bind Ni(II) by the salphen moiety to form Ni-Salphen-COFHATP-DMDB with hexagonal and quadrilateral pores, and the four-coordinated Ni(II) ions are located on the hexagonal pore walls (Fig. 19).300
 Fig. 19  Synthesis of salphen-based COFs with hexagonal and quadrilateral pores. (A) Schematic diagram of Salphen-COFHATP-DMDB. (B) Schematic diagram of Ni-Salphen-COFHATP-DMDB. 
In addition, the participation of the neighboring groups in coordination is also observed in the COFs containing pyridine rings. In 2020, Zhao and co-workers reported a series of metalated COFs based on COF-DB.301 As shown in Fig. 20, the pyridin-2-ylmethanimino linkage in the framework provides the N,N′-bidentate chelating site on the same side that can trap metal ions (type IX in Fig. 16). As a result, a variety of metal ions such as Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II), Zn(II), Mn(II), and Cd(II) are embedded in the COF-scaffold, leading to a blueshift in the stretching vibration of the CN bond from 1655 cm−1 to 1657–1663 cm−1. In addition, the metal-coordination further limits the rotation of the C–C bond between the pyridyl and the imine bond, making an additional contribution to the stabilization of the framework that is reflected in the increased BET specific surface area. Furthermore, as evidenced by the study of Van Der Voort et al., rare earth ions can also coordinate with TTA-DFP-COF by the pyridin-2-ylmethanimino moiety.302 By adjusting the ratio of Eu(III) (red luminescence) and Tb(III) (green luminescence), together with the inherent blue luminescence of TTA-DFP-COF, a composite luminescent material with white light emission is achieved.

Additionally, the N,N′,N′′-tridentate coordination site in the pyridine-2,6-dicarbaldehyde (PyDA)-derived imine-linked COFs was also reported (type X in Fig. 16). One such impressive example was observed in the Co-based woven COF-112 that was reported by Yaghi and co-workers in 2017 (Fig. 21).13 The cascade reaction of PyDA, tert-butyl (4-aminophenyl)carbamate (NBPDA) and Co(BF4)2 at 85 °C in acetonitrile/toluene produced COF-112 with dia net: first, the bis(imino)pyridine ligand 1 generated from imine condensation of PyDA with NBPDA coordinated to Co(II) to form precursor 2; then, the CF3COOH-assisted tert-butyloxy carbonyl hydrolysis gave the key intermediate 3; finally, the amino group in 3 was guided by the Co(II) to form interlaced 1D polyimine chains with PyDA via imine condensation, leading to the formation of COF-112 with a woven structure. In this process, the slow hydrolysis of the tert-butyloxy carbonyl group allows the cobalt coordination reaction to occur prior to the imine bond formation. This enables Co(II) with six-coordinated tetragonal bipyramidal geometry to act as a template to guide the lengthening and weaving of the molecular chains. By contrast, attempts to substitute NBPDA with p-phenylenediamine only yielded 1D polyimine, because the imine condensation reaction is faster than metal coordination and cannot provide a regular woven structure. Not surprisingly, pre-synthesis of Co-complex 3 followed by reaction with PyDA and Co(II) also afford COF-112 as small and aggregated microcrystals. It is worth mentioning that the oxidation of COF-112 with NaClO2 can convert the imine bond to the amide bond, while the Co oxidation state remains intact.303 Furthermore, COF-112-Fe, the iron-based analogue of COF-112, was also synthesized by a similar method. Unfortunately, neither Co(II) nor Fe(II) can be removed from the molecular chain and metal-free woven COFs cannot be obtained.13,303

2.2.2. β-Ketoenamine linkage. 
The carbonyl O and enamine N connected by the CC bond in β-ketoenamine-linked COFs can provide an additional type of bidentate coordination site to bind metal ions (type XI in Fig. 16). In 2018, Cui et al. reported a β-ketoenamine-linked chiral COF, CCOF-TpTab, which after coordination to Cu(II) gave CCOF-TpTab-Cu with a Cu(II) loading of 1.2 wt%.304 Fitting of structural parameters from EXAFS spectra showed that the loaded Cu(II) coordinated to one nitrogen and three oxygen atoms. In 2021, Islama et al. reported the Pd(II)-loaded β-ketoenamine-linked TFR-OT COF.305 After coordination, the absorption peak in the FT-IR spectrum associated with the CO stretching vibration was redshifted from 1624 to 1563 cm−1 and the peak for the N–H stretching vibration broadened. The authors thought that these changes were caused by the attenuation of the CO and N–H bonds due to the electron donation of O and N after coordination.


2.2.3. Acylhydrazone linkage. 
Acylhydrazone-linked COFs formed by salicylaldehyde and hydrazide possess a unique (E)-N′-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)benzohydrazido unit in which only three of the four heteroatoms can participate in coordination as O,N,O′-type tridentate ligands because of conformational constraint (type XII in Fig. 16). In 2020, Ma et al. reported that Redox-COF1—synthesized from 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde and benzene-1,3,5-tricarbohydrazide—can coordinate with UO22+ and subsequently undergo electron transfer from hydroxyl to UO22+, allowing the oxidation of benzene-1,4-diol to benzoquinone to achieve effective adsorption of uranium via the redox adsorption mechanism.306 The adsorption selectivity for UO22+ was up to 97% at pH = 3. Furthermore, the Bth-Dma COF, which was constructed from benzene-1,3,5-tricarbohydrazide and 2,5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde, has a regular arrangement of the (E)-N′-(2-methoxybenzylidene)benzohydrazido units on the pore wall that can readily bind Fe(III) in an aqueous solution, leading to the formation of O,N,O′-chelated Fe(III) along with fluorescence quenching of the Bth-Dma COF at 518 nm.307


2.2.4. β-Ketoacylhydrazone linkage. 
Similar to acylhydrazone-linked COFs, β-ketoacylhydrazone-linked COFs also provide tridentate O,N,O′-chelating sites (type XIII in Fig. 16). Recently, Dong et al. reported the gram-level synthesis of COF-DM by the reaction of 2′-methyl-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-dicarbohydrazide with 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde in dimethyl sulfoxide/1,3,5-trimethylbenzene at 60 °C under atmospheric pressure. After mixing with CuCl2 in acetonitrile, the Cu(II)-loaded Cu(II)@COF-DM was obtained with a Cu loading of 13.0 wt% (Fig. 22).308 In order to further determine the coordination environment of Cu(II) in COF-DM, N′,N′′′,N′′′-((1E,1′E,1′′E)-(2,4,6-trioxocyclohexane-1,3,5-triylidene)tris(methaneylylidene))tri(benzohydrazide) that was generated from benzohydrazide and 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde was used as the model molecular ligand to synthesize the Cu(II)-complex. The single-crystal analysis showed that Cu(II) in the model complex adopts [NO3] planar square coordination formed by β-ketoacylhydrazone and a coordinated methanol molecule. In addition, molybdenum-doped β-ketoacylhydrazone-COF was also reported by Zhang and co-workers recently.309

2.3. Metal nanoparticle-loaded COFs
As previously mentioned, metal ions can be immobilized into COFs by either direct polymerization of metal-containing monomers or post-synthetic metalation on the established COFs with open coordination sites. Furthermore, the metal species can also be loaded by COF-carriers as nanoparticles.310
In 2012, Fischer et al. reported the first example of COFs with deposited metal nanoparticles.132 By diffusing the Pd(η3-C3H5)(η5-C5H5) gas into COF-102 in vacuum and subsequent ultraviolet light irradiation, Pd30wt%@COF-102 was obtained with the Pd nanoparticles with a size of 2.4 nm. Because COFs have a well-defined pore structure, the growth of metal nanoparticles in the COFs is spatially restricted and the metal nanoparticle aggregation can be effectively prevented during preparation and usage. As a result, the ultra-small nanoparticles loaded in COFs are easily obtained (Fig. 23). To date, the methods for preparation of the metal nanoparticle-loaded COFs can be roughly divided into three types, namely reduction, hydrolysis, and precipitation.

2.3.1. Post-synthetic reduction. 
The post-synthetic reduction is a powerful and versatile method to prepare the metal or low-valent metal oxide nanoparticles loaded in COFs. The commonly used reducing agents are NaBH4, citrate, hydrogen, etc.
In 2020, Zhang and co-workers reported an imine-linked Phos-COF-1 which is equipped with triphenylphosphane coordination groups (Fig. 24).271 Due to the ordered distribution of phosphine coordination sites in the well-defined COF pores, a series of homo- and heterometallic metal nanoparticles, including Pd, Pt, Au, and PdAu, were successfully embedded in Phos-COF-1 by post-synthetic reduction with the aid of NaBH4. The COF-supported metal nanoparticles are stable, well-dispersed, and ultrafine (1–2 nm). In fact, NaBH4 is an excellent reducing agent and has been widely used in the preparation of the Pd,140,143,195,271,311–317 Ag,318–320 Ru,321 and Pt271,312,314 nanoparticles loaded in COFs.

Of note, application of NaBH4 in the preparation of metal nanoparticles supported on imine-linked COFs would also cause the imine linkage reduction. For example, Deng and co-workers reported that the amine-linked COFs COF-300-AR and COF-366-M-AR can be directly synthesized by reduction of their corresponding imine-lined COFs with the aid of NaBH4 even at temperature below 0 °C.46 Therefore, its improper use might lead to amine linkage formation and sometimes a decrease in crystallinity after reduction.316 An alternative is to use a milder reducing agent instead of NaBH4 to exclude this adverse effect. For example, Wang et al. synthesized the imine-linked TAPA-TFPA-COF-supported gold nanoparticles (3.9 ± 0.5 nm) using sodium citrate as a reducing agent with the assistance of polyvidone.322 Later on, Fan et al. reduced the RuCl3 in the TpPa-1 COF by H2 in a N2 atmosphere at 280 °C to afford COF-supported Ru nanoparticles. A slight decrease in the crystallinity of TpPa-1 was observed after reduction.323 In addition, vitamin C is another weak reducing agent that has been used to prepare the COF-BD(OH)2-supported Cu nanoparticles, as reported by Islam et al. recently.324
Additionally, partial reduction of inorganic salts can give low-valent metal oxides. For example, FeCl3 in the IISERP-COF6 COF was reduced with NaBH4 to obtain Fe3O4@COF,325 while the treatment of COFs with KMnO4 led to COF-supported MnO2 nanoparticles.326,327Table 3 provides more such examples.132,133,140,143,271,311–362

2.3.2. Post-synthetic hydrolysis. 
Post-synthetic hydrolysis is an effective approach for incorporation of metal oxides into COFs. The hydrolysis of the COF-supported metal salts in water or alkaline solutions can afford the corresponding metal oxides even though their actual structure may be extremely complex.
For example, in 2021, Pang et al. confirmed that gradual hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate loaded in DMTP-TAPB-COF in ethanol and water at 160 °C gave TiO2@DMTP-TAPB-COF with a TiO2 loading of up to 38.9 wt%.363 The band gap of TiO2@DMTP-TAPB-COF is 2.4 eV, which is significantly smaller than that of free TiO2 (3.2 eV), confirming the interaction between TiO2 and DMTP-TAPB-COF.
In addition, the hydrolysis of TbBd COF-supported tetrabutyl titanate in supercritical CO2 with trace water was also reported by Zhang et al.364 Compared to direct hydrolysis, the use of supercritical CO2 can effectively avoid the TiO2 aggregation during hydrolysis. More importantly, the hydrolysis in supercritical CO2 leads to the formation of O–Ti–N and N–Ti–N bonds, which was evidenced by FT-IR, XPS, and Fourier-transformed Ti K-edge EXAFS spectra. In contrast, the TiO2/TbBd COF obtained by direct hydrolysis appears to be a physical mixture of TiO2 and the TbBd COF.
As shown in Fig. 25, Minasian et al. reported the COF-5-supported actinide oxides.365 After the formation of Th(hfa)4@COF-5 and U(hfa)4@COF-5 (hfa = hexafluoroacetylacetonate) via room-temperature sublimation, the actinide oxide-loaded ThO2@COF-5 and UO2@COF-5 were obtained by hydrolysis in humid argon at 200 °C. TEM and SAXS techniques showed that ThO2 and UO2 nanoparticle growth was effectively limited by the size of COF-5 pores (2.7 nm) such that ultrasmall nanoparticle products (below 3 nm) were generated. In addition, X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy methods, such as XANES and EXAFS, provided information on the coordination environment, coordination number, bond length, and oxidation state.366 Specifically, actinide L3-edge XANES spectra revealed significant differences in the electronic structure, particle size, and surface chemistry between ThO2 and UO2 embedded in COF-5 and the bulk counterparts. The decrease in the peak amplitude of the EXAFS spectra indicates that ThO2 and UO2 embedded in COF-5 are more disordered with a larger bond length distribution, and have smaller particle size than the corresponding bulk materials. In addition, this study provides a useful template for the characterization of metal-containing nanoparticles in COFs.

2.3.3. Post-synthetic sedimentation. 
Metal ions coordinated to COFs can also be converted to solvent-insoluble nanoparticles by precipitating agents. In 2021, Caro et al. reported the synthesis of ZIF-67@TpPa-1; here, the TpPa-1 COF grown on porous α-Al2O3 was immersed vertically in a Co(NO3)2 solution to immobilize Co(II) through coordination, and 2-methyl-1H-imidazole was subsequently added to the reaction system that diffused in the pores and reacted with Co(II) to form ZIF-67 by rapid nucleation and restricted growth within the pores.371 Since the size of a single sod cage of ZIF-67 (1.70 nm) is smaller than the pore size of TpPa-1 (1.83 nm), ZIF-67 can form particles with only one cage size inside the pores of TpPa-1 COF. Unfortunately, attempts to observe ZIF-67 in ZIF-67@TpPa-1 by HRTEM were unsuccessful, most likely due to the poor stability of ultrasmall ZIF-67 under high-energy electron beams. Moreover, ZIF-8@TpPa-1 and ZIF-67@TpBD can also be prepared by a similar method. It is important to mention that in the fabrication of MOF/COF composites, this two-step method of metal coordination–ligand addition is significantly different from the one-step method that involves immersing COFs in a mixed solution of metal ions and ligands and heating them. The two-step method usually leads to the growth of MOFs within the pores of the COFs, whereas the one-step method usually results in a core–shell or layer-by-layer structure.372
By a two-step precursor addition strategy, perovskite@COF nanocomposites were prepared by Mukherjee et al. in 2021.373 After the reaction of EB-COF:Br with PbBr2 in DMF solution (60 °C, 2 h), the generated Pb(II)-coordinated EB-COF:Br was combined with CsBr in toluene/CH3OH at 60 °C for 5 min to afford CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 perovskite@COF nanocomposites. PXRD analysis showed that the crystallinity of EB-COF:Br was retained during the synthesis process and the phase component of the perovskite depended on the concentrations of PbBr2 and CsBr. It was found that the EB-COF:Br shell greatly improved the water stability of interior perovskites. The same year, Wang and co-workers reported perovskite quantum dots doped in COF-SH for facilitating light-harvesting and promoting light-converting applications.374
In addition, COF-supported transition metal carbonate, sulfide and phosphate nanoparticles have also been synthesized recently. In 2020, Dong and co-workers demonstrated that CaCO3 nanoparticles can also be embedded in nanoscale TPB-DMTP-COF through the sequential treatment of CaCl2 and NH4HCO3, with a CaCO3 content of up to 35.3 wt%.375 Due to the hydrophobicity and protective effect of the shell, the decomposition of CaCO3 under weakly acidic conditions is slowed down. Later on, the nanoscale SnS2-loaded SnS2/TpPa-1 heterojunction was reported by Shi et al.376 More recently, Wang and co-workers prepared the Ag3PO4@TpPa-1 COF for photocatalytic detoxification of hazardous pesticides in a similar manner.377
Sometimes, post-synthetic sedimentation might cause solid-phase transformation, leading to the formation of new nanoparticles in COFs, which was reported by Pang and co-workers recently. For example, treating the Cu(II)-loaded LZU-1 COF with Se2− in solution afforded CuSe@LZU-1,142 which after further treatment with the Tollens reagent gave Ag2Se@LZU-1.378 Both XPS and PXRD analysis showed that CuSe has been completely transformed into Ag2Se. However, the direct treatment of the Ag(I)-loaded LZU-1 COF with Se2− in solution only afforded silver nanorods, possibly because the coordination interaction of Ag(I) with LZU-1 is weaker than that of Cu(II).

3. Application of metalated COFs
Metalated COFs integrate the high stability of covalent bonding with the flexibility of coordination bonding, giving them the properties of both COFs and metal species, such as modularity, regular structure, permanent porosity, high mechanical strength, low density, high activity, customizability, and scalability. These characteristics undoubtedly endow them with many applications, including adsorption and separation, energy storage, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, sensing and analysis, and biomedicine applications. However, their relatively poor processability and high-cost synthesis might limit their practical applications.379 Therefore, their low-cost large-scale production and feasible processing methods are the imperative but challenging tasks.
Unlike the previous section, which focused on the design and synthesis of metalated COFs, this section will focus on the applications of metalated COFs.
3.1. Adsorption and separation

3.1.1. Gas adsorption and separation. 
Hydrogen has long been considered to be one of the cleanest energy sources, but its practical use still faces significant barriers due to storage difficulties. Other combustible gases, such as methane, ethane, ethylene, and carbon monoxide, are important chemical feedstocks. In addition, carbon dioxide emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming that are serious environmental problems facing mankind today. High concentrations of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide are toxic to humans, animals, and plants. Therefore, the development of practical methods for selective gas adsorption and storage is an urgent but challenging task. Selective gas adsorption by porous materials is one of the strategies developed to date for achieving this goal.111,380,381
As an emerging class of crystalline porous materials, COFs have been proposed for gas adsorption382–384 and separation.385–388 Various theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that COFs have high gas storage capacity at low temperature and high pressure, but their storage capacity at ambient temperature and pressure is not yet satisfactory.389–392 For example, COF-108, a well-known storage material for molecular hydrogen, has gravimetric hydrogen uptake capacity as high as 21 wt% at 100 bar and 77 K. However, upon increasing the temperature to 298 K, the hydrogen uptake plummeted to 4.5 wt%, even at a high pressure of 100 bar.393 The hydrogen uptake capacity is even less than 1 wt% at near normal temperature and pressure,394 indicating that COFs are still far from practical application. Structurally, the pore size (1–5 nm) of 2D COFs is much larger than the kinetic diameters of common gas molecules (2–5 Å), making the van der Waals interaction between pore walls and gas molecules very weak and unfavorable for gas molecule attachment.380 Metalated COFs, however, provide additional opportunities to enhance gas adsorption while retaining the advantages of COFs. Unlike the coordinatively saturated metal ions commonly found in MOFs,395 metal ions in metalated COFs are usually coordinatively unsaturated. These metal ions can induce polarization of gas molecules and promote their adsorption on the open metal sites, thereby providing the possibility for large-capacity gas adsorption under normal temperature and pressure conditions.396
Computational chemistry has played an invaluable role in the studies of gas adsorption of COFs.397–399Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations by Ahuja et al. showed that the hydrogen uptake of the Li(I)-loaded COF-366 at 77 K under ambient pressure is approximately twice that of metal-free COF-366.400 On the basis of the multiscale theoretical method that combines first-principles calculations and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation, Wang et al. predicted that the total gravimetric hydrogen uptake in COF-202 at 298 K and 100 bar could increase from 1.52 to 3.32 and 4.39 wt% after doping with 3.95 and 7.90 wt% of Li(I), respectively.401 In addition, Li(I)-doping also significantly enhanced the room temperature hydrogen uptake of COF-102, COF-103 COF-105, COF-108, and COF-320.402–405 Furthermore, the diffusion and desorption of hydrogen in COFs were studied by Cheng et al. via combining first-principles calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The gravimetric hydrogen density of the Li(I)-doped Pc-PBBA COF was 3.81 wt% at 300 K and 100 bar. When the pressure was reduced to 1 bar, the adsorbed hydrogen molecules showed fast desorption kinetics and 97% of the hydrogen escaped from the material.406 Mechanistically, through charge polarization, the positively charged Li(I) bound to COFs causes the formation of coordination bonds between the electrons of the H2 σ-bonds and the empty Li(I) 2s orbitals, clearly enhancing the hydrogen uptake in the materials.401,402,406 Other alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as Na(I),403 K(I),403 Ca(II),407,408 and Mg(II),407 also enhanced the hydrogen uptake of metalated COFs through similar polarization effects.
Transition metal-chelated COFs also show potential for application in hydrogen storage. For example, according to molecular dynamics simulations using quantum-mechanics-based force fields and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, the volumetric hydrogen uptake of PdCl2-chelated COF-301 is 60 g L−1 at 100 bar, which is 8.1 times that of the metal-free COF-301.409 The distance between the adjacent framework layers is reduced from 10.4 to 9.9 Å and the pore size is reduced from 9.3 to 6.3 Å upon PdCl2 loading. The short distance between the metalated sites allows H2 molecules to easily interact with the Pd(II) from the two adjacent layers, and the suitable pore size further enhances this interaction, resulting in the efficient capture of H2. Similarly, simulations by Mendoza-Cortes et al. showed that over a wide pressure range (0–700 bar), the hydrogen uptake of transition metal-metalated imine-COFs was generally higher than that of bulk H2 (Fig. 26).410

(B) Optimum pressure, also known as saturation pressure. Under this pressure, the material has the maximum extra uptake relative to bulk H2 at 298 K. (C) Extra gravimetric H2 uptake of pure and metalated COFs at 298 K. (D) Total volumetric H2 uptake of pure and metalated COFs at 298 K. 
In addition to hydrogen adsorption, the enhanced effect of metalation on adsorption of other gases was also investigated by computational chemistry. A simulation study by Smit et al. predicted that the excess CO2 uptake of Li(I)-doped COF-102 was as high as 409 mg g−1 at 298 K and 1 bar, which was 7.9 times greater than that of unmetalated COF-102.411 Similarly, as reported by Wang et al., the excess CH4 uptake of Li(I)-doped COF-103 was 30.98 wt% at 298 K and 35 bar, which was 1.9 times greater than that of unmetalated COF-103.412 Clearly, consistent with hydrogen adsorption, the metalated sites enhance the interaction of gas molecules with the framework, including the London dispersion force and ion-induced dipole interaction, thus significantly increasing their uptake capacity. In addition, Cao et al. investigated the diffusion and separation behaviors of CH4 and H2 in 3D COFs (including COF-102, COF-103, COF-105, and COF-108) and lithium-doped counterparts.413 The affinity of Li(I)-doped 3D COFs for CH4 molecules is stronger than that of H2 molecules, leading to an order of magnitude increase in the adsorption selectivity of Li(I)-doped 3D COFs to the CH4/H2 gas during the adsorption and separation process. However, the self-diffusivity and permeation selectivity of Li(I)-doped 3D COFs were significantly decreased due to the strong affinity of Li(I) for gas molecules, hindering molecular motion. This implies that Li(I)-doping is not favorable for kinetic separation and may weaken the separation performance of COF-based membranes.
The above simulation studies suggest that metalation is a potential method that can enhance gas uptake. However, the simulation results may be difficult to be achieved precisely by chemical methods. For example, the designed COFs may have difficulty in achieving the expected crystallinity or even fail to crystallize, the metal ions embedded in COFs may face difficulties in reaching the theoretical content due to hindered intra-pore mass transfer, the high-valent metal ions may undergo hydrolysis leading to cluster formation, and the open metal ions may coordinate with the solvents leading to coordination saturation, thus weakening the interaction with gas molecules. All these factors lead to gas uptake of metalated COFs to be lower than the calculated value, so that the practical application of metalated COFs in gas adsorption and separation is still limited.
To date, the vast majority of the studies reported in the literature provide the nitrogen adsorption and desorption data of metalated COFs at 77 K.301 However, due to the material weight increase caused by metalation, the gas adsorption per unit weight and specific surface area is usually reduced, indicating that the enhancement of N2 adsorption by metalation is insignificant. However, there are some impressive experimental studies showing the enhanced effect of metalation on hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and ammonia adsorption and release.
In 2020, Johnson et al. reported that the copper(II) formate-loaded COF was heat-treated in vacuum at 175 °C for 1 h to afford open Cu(I) sites in the framework.384 After adsorption of hydrogen, most of the hydrogen was released from the material at 77–173 K. However, a fraction of the hydrogen was retained in the material at room temperature and was not desorbed until 303–373 K. This phenomenon of hydrogen retention at ambient temperature is closely related to the interaction of hydrogen molecules with coordinatively unsaturated Cu(I).
In 2015, Lotsch et al. reported metalation of azine-linked AB-COF by treatment of the COF with lithium acetate and zinc acetate in methanol.414 The metalated Li@AB-COF and Zn@AB-COF displayed enhanced CO2 uptake of 4.33 and 4.68 mmol g−1, respectively, at 273 K and 1 bar, while the CO2 uptake of AB-COF was only 3.38 mmol g−1 under the same conditions. At higher pressure, Li@AB-COF and Zn@AB-COF are more suitable for selective adsorption of CO2 from a mixture of CO2 and H2 than the metal-free AB-COF. By contrast, the metalated ATFG-COF has no beneficial effect on CO2 uptake at 1 bar and in the temperature range of 273–313 K, possibly due to the low amount of open metal sites in ATFG-COF.
Endowing metalated COFs with acidic functionality can significantly enhance NH3 uptake capacity via both the formation of ammonium salts and metal–NH3 interactions. In 2018, Zhu et al. prepared [HOOC]X-COFs (X = 17, 33, 50, 67, 100) containing different amounts of carboxyl groups (Fig. 27A).415 After metalation at room temperature, [MOOC]X-COFs (M = Ca, Mn, Sr; X = 17, 33, 50, 67, 100) were generated (Fig. 27B). Compared with metal-free COFs, the NH3 uptake capacity of [MOOC]17-COF (M = Ca, Mn, Sr) increased from 9.34 to 12.25, 11.38, and 14.30 mmol g−1, respectively. Variable-temperature FT-IR spectra showed that the interaction strength between NH3 and the metal ions decreased in the order of –COOH, –CO, and –NH– in the framework, strongly suggesting that metalation is a key factor for NH3 uptake enhancement (Fig. 27C). A similar phenomenon was observed by Wang et al. in their recent report on the NH3 uptake based on Ca(II)-metalated TAPT-DMTA-COF.416 As shown, the NH3 adsorption of CaCl2@TAPT-DMTA-COF is 8.8 times higher than that of the metal-free TAPT-DMTA-COF. The enhanced NH3 uptake was attributed to the Ca(NH3)xCl2 formation and the capillary condensation phenomenon caused by microporosity.

(B) The structure of [MOOC]X-COFs (M = Ca, Mn, Sr; X = 17, 33, 50, 67, 100). (C) The interaction of ammonia and metalated COFs containing carboxyl groups. 
Overall, metalation is one of the effective methods to enhance the gas uptake and selectivity of COFs, which is clearly attributed to the fact that the loaded metal species can provide additional active sites for gas immobilization. Although the metalated COF-based gas adsorption and separation have not been fully explored thus far, the potential of metalated COFs is foreseeable due to the great success of MOFs in gas adsorption and separation.381 We believe that the highly chemically stable frameworks, together with their tunable metal content and metal type, would allow the metalated COFs to be alternative potential porous materials to achieve desirable gas adsorption and separation performance.


3.1.2. Pollutant adsorption. 
In addition to gas adsorption, as porous materials, COFs are also efficient adsorbents for the removal of pollutants, including heavy metal ions,45,417–421 organic dyes,422–426 pesticides,427 and antibiotics.428 In 2019, Tang et al. showed that Ca(II)- and Ni(II)-loaded COF-COOH can facilitate the adsorption-removal of organic dyes.429 A likely explanation for this result is that the loaded metal ions provide increased active sites for dye adsorption, thus improving the efficiency of the organic dye removal. However, frankly, the enhanced effect of metalation on pollutant adsorption has not been fully explored compared to that on gas adsorption.


3.1.3. Enrichment of peptides and proteins. 
Due to the large conjugation range and high density of heteroatoms, COFs have high affinity for peptides and proteins, albeit with poor specificity.430–433 However, metal ions in metalated COFs can provide additional active sites to enhance the selective adsorption of peptides and proteins to a certain extent. In 2019, Lin et al. reported MCNC@COF@Zr(IV) core–shell magnetic nanoparticles, which can serve as an ideal adsorbent for selective enrichment of phosphopeptides via the strong affinity interaction between Zr(IV) and phosphate groups.434 Moreover, the Ti(IV)-anchoring TpPa-2 COF also has a strong affinity for phosphopeptides.435 In mass spectrometric analysis of HeLa cell-derived proteins, 7432 phosphopeptides were detected, showing that the enrichment performance of the Ti(IV)-loaded TpPa-2 COF is superior to that of commercial TiO2 microspheres and the metal-free TpPa-2 COF. Recently, Lin and co-workers reported a Cu(II)-loaded hollow COF that can efficiently capture amyloid β-peptide 1–42, a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, from human serum within 3 min.436 A low detection limit of 0.2 fmol μL−1 was obtained in the subsequent mass spectrometric analysis.
In addition, metal nanoparticle loaded COFs also possess the ability to selectively enrich polypeptides.318,437 As reported by Li et al. in 2020, IBAs-AuNPs/COF composites with the insulin aptamer on the AuNPs/COF surface exhibit good specificity for insulin enrichment in the presence of high levels of human immunoglobulins, lysozyme, or biotin.335 The selective enrichment of insulin from the serum of diabetic patients by IBAs-AuNPs/COF can then be used for insulin quantification through mass spectrometric analysis.

3.2. Energy storage
In recent years, COFs have been developed as energy storage materials, including in supercapacitors and rechargeable metal ion batteries.438,439 Incorporation of metal ions into COFs would further improve their electrochemical performance and expand the scope of their application.440 Below we will highlight some representative examples in this emerging energy storage area, including semiconductor properties of the metalated COFs and their application in supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries.

3.2.1. Semiconduction and photoconduction. 
As a class of organic materials, COFs are usually electrically insulating, because they share a wide band gap that is too large to allow electrons to transition from the valence band to the conduction band under usual conditions.441 Metalation endows COFs with electrical conductivity in two ways.442 First, the metal acts as an electroactive component to generate charge carriers. Second, the regular arrangement of metal atoms on the COF-scaffolds allows continuous conduction channels for charge transport. Similar to other semiconductor materials, COF-semiconductors can be divided into three types based on their carrier transport characteristics, namely p-type, n-type and ambipolar.443
The stacking of aromatic units in 2D COFs provides a pathway for charge carrier transport. Therefore, p-type semiconducting COFs can be easily constructed by integrating electron-rich units (e.g., porphyrins, phthalocyanines, and pyrenes) into COFs,182,444–446 leading to a carrier transport process dominated by hole conduction. For example, the intrinsic charge carrier mobility of NiPc-COF constructed of nickel(II) phthalocyanine was determined by Jiang et al. using flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements.53 The charge carrier number was determined to be 3.8 × 108 at a photon density of 6.5 × 1014 photon cm−2 and a bias voltage of 0 V, with a charge carrier generation efficiency of 3.0 × 10−5 that was independent of the measurement atmosphere (i.e., Ar and SF6), indicating its p-type semiconductor behavior with a minimum carrier mobility of 1.3 cm2 (V s)−1. When NiPc-COF was irradiated with a xenon lamp at the wavelengths greater than 400 nm, the current at a bias voltage of 1.0 V increased from 20 nA to 3 μA. Moreover, the Q-band absorption of NiPc-COF was located at 635 and 686 nm, leading to additional sensitivity to dark red light. Additionally, the effect of the central metal on the semiconductor and photoconductive properties was further investigated by comparison of three phthalocyanine-COFs, viz. CuPc-COF, ZnPc-COF, and CoPc-COF.447 The charge carrier mobilities of CuPc-COF, ZnPc-COF, and CoPc-COF at a photon density of 9.1 × 1015 photon cm−2 were 1.4, 2.2, and 2.6 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively. The mobilities increased in the order of CuPc-COF < ZnPc-COF < CoPc-COF, which coincides with the increasing order of electron densities of the phthalocyanine macrocycles, indicating the key role of the central metal in regulating the electronic properties of metallophthalocyanine-COFs. However, the photocurrents of CuPc-COF, ZnPc-COF, and CoPc-COF at a bias voltage of 2 V were 110, 0.6, and 0.14 nA, respectively. This inconsistency with the charge carrier mobility may be related to the microscopic morphology of the three COFs: CuPc-COF is band-like, whereas ZnPc-COF and CoPc-COF are disk-like.
An impressive study by Huang et al. in 2022 showed that piperazine-linked NiPc–NH–CoPcF8 and NiPc–NH–CuPcF8 COFs are p-type semiconducting COFs that exhibit carrier mobilities of 35.4 and 35.1 cm2 (V s)−1 and conductivities of 12.7 and 11.5 S m−1, respectively.219 Remarkably, NiPc–NH–CoPcF8 has the highest carrier mobility among the semiconducting COFs reported to date. In addition to the π-conjugation effect in the metallophthalocyanine-COFs, such record mobility is largely due to the spontaneous oxidation of the piperazine linkages that can lead to the formation of cationic radicals, consequently, increasing electrical performance dramatically.
For exploiting tunable semiconductivity and photoconductivity, Mirica and co-workers constructed a chemiresistive-type gas sensor by using metallophthalocyanine-COF as a semiconductor.215 The aromatic conjugated framework of nickel(II) phthalocyanine-based COF-DC-8 maximizes in-plane charge delocalization, and the regularly arranged rigid metallophthalocyanine entity, together with the fully eclipsed AA-stacking of COF-DC-8, effectively promotes out-of-plane charge transfer. Combining both in-plane and out-of-plane charge transfer strategies, COF-DC-8 has an intrinsic bulk conductivity of up to 2.51 mS m−1. After fabrication into chemiresistive devices, COF-DC-8 exhibited positive chemiresistive response to both NH3 and H2S as electron donors, but negative response to NO and NO2, indicating that COF-DC-8 is a p-type semiconductor. The chemiresistive responses after exposure to gas are linear with respect to gas concentration over a certain range, allowing it to be a gas sensor. The detection limits of NH3, H2S, NO, and NO2 were 0.070, 0.204, 0.005, and 0.016 cm3 m−3, respectively. Importantly, after thermal recovery and solvent treatment, the detection performance of the device is almost restored to its original level, highlighting its reusability. ESR and XPS analysis indicated that weak coordination interactions between gas molecules and Ni(II) were the origin of the chemiresistive response. Similarly, the conductivity of CoPc-PDQ-COF obtained by replacing Ni(II) in COF-DC-8 with Co(II) was measured as 3.68 mS m−1.216
In addition to metallophthalocyanine-COFs, in 2020, Huang et al. synthesized porphyrin-based TAPP-TFPP-COF with tetragonal micropores, in which the porphyrin units form a periodically ordered columnar structure by π-stacking (Fig. 28).194 Due to the lack of charge carriers in the framework, the electrical conductivity of TAPP-TFPP-COF is 1.12 × 10−10 S cm−1 at room temperature, slightly increasing to 6.32 × 10−10 S cm−1 upon visible-light irradiation. After doping with I2, the electrical conductivity of I2@TAPP-TFPP-COF increased to 1.46 × 10−7 S cm−1 due to the formation of charge transfer complexes. Upon visible-light irradiation, the I2@TAPP-TFPP-COF-derived films displayed an increased photocurrent from 22 to 144 nA with a photoconductivity of 4.1 × 10−5 S cm−1. Of note, the I2@TAPP-TFPP-COF films responded to a wide range of wavelengths, and were exceptionally sensitive to 700 nm near-infrared light with an on–off ratio of 24000.

Likewise, the semiconducting nature of porphyrin-based COFs can be used to fabricate gas sensors. In 2022, Lan and co-workers reported that Co-TPCOF prepared by post-synthetic metalation has the form of ultrathin atomic-level thick nanosheets, which is extremely important for providing fully accessible and exposed active sites that facilitate gas diffusion and sensing applications.448 Upon exposure to a NO2 atmosphere, NO2 rapidly adsorbs on cobalt porphyrin to form Co–N bonds and accepts electrons to form nitrite species, leading to an increase in the hole concentration and thus allowing elevated conductivity. Once NO2 is desorbed, electrons are released from the nitrite back to Co-TPCOF and the sensor current is restored. Apparently, metalation enhances the NO2 adsorption on the sensor and contributes to the detection sensitivity. The current response recorded at interdigitated electrodes showed 2713- and 1382-fold current signal enhancement for Co-TPCOF and its unmetalated counterpart H2-TPCOF, respectively, when exposed to 100 cm3 m−3 NO2. Importantly, Co-TPCOF responds selectively to NO2, while 10 other common gases (i.e., SO2, CO, H2S, NH3, CH4, benzene, methylamine, methanol, ethanol, and toluene) do not lead to a change in the current signal. This selectivity is uncommon in chemiresistive-type NO2 sensors and may be related to the significantly lower adsorption energy of NO2 by Co-TPCOF than that of other gases. In addition, the response of Co-TPCOF to NO2 is concentration-dependent with a detection limit of 6.8 × 10−3 cm3 m−3 and a response time of 5.3 min, and the reusability performance and long-term stability meet the needs of practical NO2 gas detection.
Compared with the p-type semiconducting COFs, reports on n-type semiconducting COFs constructed from electron-deficient monomers (e.g. benzothiadiazole and benzobisthiadiazole) are relatively rare thus far.449–451 The first n-type semiconducting COF is the 2D-NiPc-BTDA COF, which was synthesized by Jiang et al. via the reaction of electron-deficient nickel(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxyphthalocyanine with benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyldiboronic acid.452 The AA-stacking mode provides a channel for electron transport with an electron mobility as high as 0.6 cm2 (V s)−1. Upon visible-light irradiation, the 2D-NiPc-BTDA COF exhibits panchromatic photoconductivity, and its photocurrent is enhanced from 250 nA to 15 μA.
Very recently, copper(II) phthalocyanine and isoindigo have also been used by the same group to synthesize ordered but unconjugated borate-linked 2D CuPc-MIDA-COF (Fig. 29A).453 The conductivity of CuPc-MIDA-COF is temperature-dependent and can be activated at near room temperature. The activation energy is 0.34 eV and the room temperature conductivity is on the order of 10−6 S cm−1. Based on the Hall effect, the Hall resistance of CuPc-MIDA-COF at 27 °C is linearly and positively correlated with the scanned perpendicular magnetic field, indicating that the charge carriers are electrons with a mobility of 8.3 cm2 (V s)−1. Furthermore, time- and frequency-resolved terahertz spectroscopy indicates that the scattering time of charge carriers is 23 ± 13 fs and the intrinsic carrier mobility is 13.3 cm2 (V s)−1. The structural reasons for such exceptionally fast electron transport were explained based on theoretical calculations. Briefly, in CuPc-MIDA-COF, the electron-deficient monomer isoindigo is guided to form a highly regular overlapping stacking due to the π-stacking of the phthalocyanine species, thereby confining isoindigo to a well-defined framework. Thus, the planar structure allows electrons to move within the plane, leading to lateral electron transport, while the eclipsed stacking enhances electron coupling, permitting band-like electron conduction across the layers (Fig. 29B). This unique electron transport mechanism provides theoretical guidance for the development of high-performance n-type semiconductor materials.

It is clear that the semiconductor properties of metalated COFs are closely related to the type of metal ion. The reaction of (porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayltetrakis(benzene-4,1-diyl))tetraboronic acid and its metalation products with benzene-1,2,4,5-tetraol gave three isostructural porphyrin-COFs with the AA stacking mode (Fig. 30), i.e., H2P-COF, CuP-COF, and ZnP-COF.454 Experimental results showed that H2P-COF is a p-type semiconductor due to the absence of metal and the presence of only ring-to-ring hole transport channels. After doping with metals, additional metal-to-metal electron transport channels are formed. The electron density on the porphyrin rings is reduced in metalated ZnP-COF and CuP-COF, which in turn reduces the ring-mediated hole mobility. However, Cu(II) induces a stronger tendency of ring-to-metal charge transfer than Zn(II), further reducing the electron density on the porphyrin rings, so that CuP-COF is an electron transport-mediated n-type semiconductor, while ZnP-COF allows hole and electron transport along the ring and metal, respectively, as an ambipolar semiconductor. This pioneering study by Jiang and co-workers implied that by changing the metal species in metalated COFs, not only the conductivity can be fine-tuned, but also the carrier type can be fundamentally changed.

The combination of electron-rich donors and electron-deficient acceptors in COFs can form ambipolar semiconducting COFs.455–457 Jiang et al. reported the synthesis of DZnPc–ANDI-COFs (Fig. 31A) from zinc(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxyphthalocyanine as the electron donor and ((1,3,6,8-tetraoxo-1,3,6,8-tetrahydrobenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-2,7-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))diboronic acid as the electron acceptor, in which the acceptor and donor form parallel columnar arrays that allow ultrafast electron transfer from donor to acceptor, enabling direct coupling of light absorption and charge separation and suppressing charge recombination.458 Both solid-state and multiple organic solvent-dispersed DZnPc–ANDI-COF can produce photo-induced rapid charge dissociation and long-life charge retention. Further studies of photo-induced electron-transfer dynamics have shown that the photo-induced charge separation state lifetime and charge carrier mobility are influenced by factors such as metal type and the donor–acceptor distance.209

In addition to the use of different monomers, regularly arranged donor and acceptor in COFs can be constructed by the pore engineering strategy. According to the research of Jiang et al., x%N3–ZnPc-COFs (x = 0, 10, 25, 50) with azide groups on the pore walls were synthesized using zinc(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octahydroxyphthalocyanine as the node and different ratios of (2,5-bis(azidomethyl)-1,4-phenylene)diboronic acid and 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid as the edge.459 Photoelectroactive [C60]y–ZnPc-COFs (y = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) were obtained after click reactions with fullerenes modified with ethynyls (Fig. 31B), in which the fullerenes are confined in the pores as electron acceptors and the phthalocyanines on the frameworks act as electron donors, leading to photoinduced electron transfer and allowing effective charge separation in the form of spatially separated ZnPc˙+ and C60˙−. As a result, upon laser flash at 680 nm, [C60]0.3–ZnPc-COF exhibited a charge separation time of 2.66 ms. This work demonstrates the possibility of using frameworks and regular pores to construct ambipolar COFs for charge separation and photoelectric conversion, highlighting the advantages of COFs over amorphous polymers.
In conclusion, COFs can be used as semiconductors and photoconductors due to the π-column periodic arrays resulting from their stacked structure,460 while metal ions can modulate the photoelectric activity of COFs by adjusting the local electron density, providing a valuable toolbox for property optimization.


3.2.2. Supercapacitor. 
According to their electrical energy storage mechanisms, supercapacitors—also called electrochemical capacitors—are classified as either pseudocapacitors, electrochemical double-layer capacitors, or hybrid supercapacitors.461 Pseudocapacitors, also known as redox supercapacitors, are based on the electrochemical adsorption of ions on the surface of electrode materials and subsequent reversible redox reactions. The introduction of variable-valent metals (e.g., Ni, Co, and Fe) and redox-active monomers (e.g., quinone, imide, and thianthrene) into COFs may help to achieve pseudocapacitance.462–464 Electrochemical double-layer capacitors store electric energy through charge accumulation at the electrode–electrolyte interface without chemical reactions.465 As porous materials, COFs have a high specific surface area for providing ample charge storage surface and suitable pore size (1–4 nm) for the transport of solvated ions within the pores, which may help to improve the energy density of electrochemical double-layer capacitors.466
The earliest COF device capable of pseudocapacitive energy storage was constructed using 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone as the redox active site.467,468 However, it is difficult to precisely control the number of active sites in order to fine-tune the electrochemical performance. In 2015, Jiang et al. used post-synthetic modification of nickel(II) porphyrin-COFs to covalently attach 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) to the framework of [HCC]X%-NiP-COF (X = 50, 100) in order to convert the COFs into a redox-active platform for capacitive energy storage (Fig. 32).135 The resulting [TEMPO]X%-NiP-COFs (X = 50, 100) have capacitances of 124 F g−1 (X = 50) and 167 F g−1 (X = 100) at a current density of 100 mA g−1. This study underscored that the regular pores of COFs promote charge transfer, and the high specific surface area provides a platform for the immobilization of redox-active sites, revealing the potential of COFs as an important platform for the construction of energy storage materials.

In 2021, Zhang and co-workers reported dioxin-linked metallophthalocyanine-derived PAE-PcM (M = Co, Ni, Cu) COFs as p-type semiconductors for supercapacitors.469 The effects of different metals in COFs on the properties were compared. Since the carrier mobility increases in the order of PAE-PcCu < PAE-PcNi < PAE-PcCo, PAE-PcCo with the best semiconductor performance was used to develop supercapacitors. Structurally, PAE-PcCo can accommodate large electrolyte ions due to its open pore channel with a diameter of 1.4 nm. Experiments using a three-electrode system in 0.5 M 1-ethyl-3-methyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium chloride showed the capacitance characteristics of PAE-PcCo in a wide potential window with a range of −0.6–0.8 V. The surface area-normalized capacitance of PAE-PcCo devices is 19 μF cm−2, and the devices retain 86% of the capacitance after 1500 cycles at 80 mV s−1. Mechanistically, the capacitance of PAE-PcCo is mainly attributed to the redox process during charge–discharge cycles with a maximum contribution of 88.5% and a relatively small contribution from the double-layer capacitance. In addition, the solid-state supercapacitor cell has a low internal resistance with an equivalent ohmic resistance of only 2.2 Ω. Clearly, the excellent stability of the dioxin-linked COFs paves the way for the application of COF-based devices.
COFs have also recently been developed as electrochemical double layer capacitors. In 2020, Fang et al. reported that amino-functionalized metalloporphyrins, i.e., 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin nickel(II) and copper(II), reacted with 4,4′-(ethyne-1,2-diyl)bis(2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) to result in JUC-511 and JUC-512, respectively.470 Structurally, both COFs have open pores with a size of 3.4 nm that are conducive to charge transfer. Due to the existence of hydrogen bonds between –OH and imine linkages, the chemical stability of JUC-511 and JUC-512 is greatly improved. The areal capacitance values of the capacitor device manufactured based on exfoliated JUC-511 and JUC-512 at 1000 mV s−1 are 5.46 and 5.85 mF cm−2, respectively. After 10000 cycles, the capacitance retention rates are still close to 100%, indicating their good reliability and stability. In addition, considering the low density of COFs, exfoliated JUC-511 and JUC-512 capacitors with the maximum power densities of 55.0 and 42.2 kW kg−1, respectively, are superior to the common graphite carbon microcapacitors for achieving device miniaturization. It is particularly important to mention that even at a scan rate as high as 30000 mV s−1, the device still shows excellent energy storage performance, which is not common in capacitor-type microdevices. By contrast, the metal-free JUC-510 was also synthesized from 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin, and it showed electrochemical properties inferior to those of JUC-511 and JUC-512, suggesting that metalation can indeed improve the capacitor performance.
Hybrid supercapacitors based on metalated COFs were reported recently. In 2020, Zhuang et al. reported the interdigital microsupercapacitors that were assembled from the metallophthalocyanine-based PAE-NiNiPcF8 COF and exfoliated graphene (Fig. 33).214 The highly ordered crystalline framework and periodically arranged metal-on-metal columns in the PAE-NiNiPcF8 COF provide powerful transport channels for charge carriers. The specific volumetric capacitance of the PAE-NiNiPcF8 COF device reaches 28.1 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. In an acidic electrolyte, the PAE-NiNiPcF8 electrode exhibits outstanding cycling stability. The capacitance performance is over 98% of the initial value after 10000 charge–discharge cycles. Trasatti analysis suggests that the contributions of pseudocapacitance and double layer capacitance behavior are approximately equal for the PAE-NiNiPcF8 COF-derived device. In addition, PAE-CuCuPcF8 and PAE-NiCuPcF8 based devices with different metal centers display slightly lower capacitive performances, with specific volumetric capacitances of 22.0 and 24.1 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, respectively.

3.2.3. Rechargeable battery. 
Conventional organic electrode materials usually suffer from poor electrical conductivity, slow ion diffusion, low energy density, and poor cycling stability.471 Inspired by redox-active COFs and their potential as supercapacitor energy storage devices, the prospect of redox-active COFs in metal-ion battery systems has also attracted significant attention.472 First, COFs have regular open pores with easily functionalized pore walls. The modified functional groups on the pore wall can interact with metal ions to modulate ion transport, thus inducing uniform and dense metal deposition during charge and discharge, and ultimately suppressing dendrite growth. This is critical for increasing battery capacity and extending battery life.438 Second, the diversity of building blocks and topologies enables COFs with tunable structures to facilitate functional-oriented material design.473 The customizability of COFs provides outstanding flexibility in the optimization of the battery performance. Ion diffusion kinetics and conductivity of a COF-based battery can be optimized by exfoliating bulk COFs362,474,475 and compounding with other conductive materials, such as carbon nanotubes.476–478 Third, COFs have lower material density and higher energy density compared to MOFs and other metal-based materials.479 Also, the good thermostability and electrochemical stability of COFs undoubtedly can extend the cycle life of batteries.480 To date, COFs have already been used to make lithium-ion,481–483 sodium-ion,484–486 potassium-ion,487,488 zinc-ion,489,490 lithium–CO2,491 lithium–sulfur,492–494 and zinc–air batteries.221 Functionally, COFs can be used as anodes,362,475,495 cathodes,478,496,497 solid-state electrolytes,498–500 and separators.501–505
As we know, the regularly arranged metal-on-metal arrays are favorable for charge carrier transport, and the variable-valence metals can be used as redox-active sites, as evidenced by several recently reported examples.
In 2021, Lan et al. reported the application of a manganese(II) porphyrin-COF in Li–CO2 batteries.201 As shown in Fig. 34A, TTCOF-Mn was synthesized as a cathode catalyst for high-performance nonprotonic Li–CO2 batteries by imine condensation between electron-donating 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-([2,2′-bi(1,3-dithiolylidene)]-4,4′,5,5′-tetrayl)tetrabenzaldehyde and catalytically active manganese(II) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin monomers. TTCOF-Mn exhibited higher CO2 uptake than its metal-free counterpart TTCOF-2H (29.8 vs. 14.0 cm3 g−1). When used as a Li–CO2 battery cathode, the overpotential of TTCOF-Mn is only 1.07 V at a high current density of 100 mA g−1, which is less than half of that of TTCOF-2H. Importantly, the Li–CO2 battery with TTCOF-Mn as the cathode can operate at a high current density of 300 mA g−1 for 180 cycles, with only a slight decrease in the discharge terminal potential from the initial 2.86 V to 2.60 V, while TTCOF-2H shows a rapid decrease in the discharge terminal potential to 1.60 V after 10 cycles (Fig. 34B). In the deep charge–discharge experiments, the discharge capacity of TTCOF-Mn is 13018 mA h g−1, which is 3.1 times higher than that of TTCOF-2H. On the one hand, the mechanistic study shows that the metalloporphyrin in TTCOF-Mn as the catalytically active center in the Li–CO2 battery effectively adsorbs and activates CO2 to realize an efficient four-electron CO2 conversion pathway; on the other hand, the electron-donating property of tetrathiafulvalene and the regular microporous channel are favorable for the transport of electrons and Li(I) ions. This study suggests a positive role of metalation in improving the performance of COF-electrodes.

Loh et al. established the ternary composite, which is composed of COF-Ru@CNT formed by the acylhydrazone-linked Tf-DHzOPr COF, ruthenium nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes, for use as a cathode in a Li–CO2 battery.506 The Tf-DHzOPr COF provides regular pores to promote CO2 adsorption and Li(I) directional transport, and ruthenium nanoparticles contribute to CO2 reduction and Li2CO3 decomposition. The synergy between Tf-DHzOPr COF and ruthenium catalyst effectively reduces the accumulation of Li2CO3 on the cathode and avoids passivation of the cathode surface and blockage of diffusion channels, thus narrowing the overpotential and enhancing the battery kinetics. This enables the battery to run for many cycles and withstand high current densities. The data show that for the Li–CO2 battery, the overpotential of the COF-Ru@CNT cathode is only 1.24 V. The battery has an ultra-large capacity of 27348 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1, and is cycled through 200 charge–discharge cycles without a significant performance decay under a current density of 1000 mA g−1.
Exfoliation of bulk COFs into nanosheets can further expose the active sites. Very recently, the same group reported that the Mn-involved MnO2/DQTP-COF-NS-3 nanosheet can be achieved by the reaction of DQTP-COF and HClO4-acidified KMnO4 solution with 18.9 wt% MnO2 (Fig. 34C).327 MnO2/DQTP-COF-NS-3 nanosheets with the MnO2 catalyst and the redox-active anthracene-9,10-dione moiety would be of great benefit for the mass transfer and battery kinetics. As expected, MnO2/DQTP-COF-NS-3 displays excellent electrochemical performance as a cathode catalyst for Li–CO2 batteries, exhibiting a discharge potential of 2.72 V and a charge potential of 4.18 V at a constant current density of 200 mA g−1 and a limited capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 (Fig. 34D). The specific capacity reaches an astonishing 42802 mA h g−1 based on the full discharge curves at a current density of 200 mA g−1. Furthermore, the Li–CO2 battery can be rapidly charged and discharged at a high current density of 1000 mA g−1 for 120 cycles without significant performance degradation (Fig. 34E).
In addition to Li–CO2 batteries, the application of metalated COFs in other types of batteries has also been reported by Wang and co-workers.362 E-TFPB-COF/MnO2 composite nanosheets prepared by a similar chemical stripping method were used as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The E-TFPB-COF/MnO2 composite anode has long cycling stability with a high reversible capacity of 1359 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 300 cycles, whereas this reversible capacity is 968, 126, and 358 mA h g−1 for E-TFPB-COF nanosheets, bulk TFPB-COF, and commercial MnO2, respectively. There are many reasons for this result. First, the broad conjugation range of E-TFPB-COF promotes Li(I)–π interactions, providing outstanding lithium storage performance. Second, compared to bulk TFPB-COF, the ultra-thin micromorphology exposes more redox-active sites. Third, the short insertion distance of Li(I) substantially promotes their diffusion. Lastly, acting as a spacer, MnO2 nanoparticles prevent the agglomeration of E-TFPB-COF nanosheets during the cycling charging and discharging process.
Exploiting the coordination interaction between cyano and Co(II) in COF-316, Wang and co-workers realized its metalation.507 The obtained COF-316-Co was used as the anode for potassium-ion batteries. Due to the K(I)–π interactions and structural defects caused by Co(II), COF-316-Co has stronger conductivity and faster K(I) reaction kinetics than COF-316. The charge transfer resistance of the COF-316-Co anode is significantly lower than that of the COF-316 anode. The reversible capacity was 371 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 100 mA g−1, which is 3.5 times higher than that of COF-316 (106 mA h g−1).
In 2021, the same group reported a zinc–air flow battery, in which the aqueous solution of ferric phthalocyanine-based COFBTC, KOH (8 M) and ZnO (0.5 M) served as the electrolyte, and the zinc plate and IrO2/C on carbon paper acted as the anode and air cathode, respectively.221 Unlike the conventional air cathode that is coated with the catalyst (e.g., Pt/C), the COFBTC solution catalyst allows the active sites to be almost completely exposed, which is clearly beneficial for improving battery performance. For the discharge process, COFBTC has good activity with an onset potential of 965 mV and a half-wave potential of 900 mV. After 10000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, the half-wave potential shifted by only 9 mV. Furthermore, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the COFBTC-constructed battery maintains its properties for 40 discharge–charge cycles, while its counterpart constructed using Pt/C as the catalyst exhibits significant performance degradation after 10 cycles.
Unarguably, metalated COFs have made some progress in battery applications due to the availability of a catalytic active center and ion diffusion channels, but there are still a lot of research gaps, providing great opportunities for future studies. The electrode reactions which will be discussed in the next section may provide additional information for increasing energy density and optimizing battery performance.

3.3. Electrocatalysis
Noble metal-catalysts, such as Pt, RuO2, and IrO2, as electrocatalysts have been widely investigated for use in electrolytic cells, fuel cells, and metal–air cells.508,509 However, the poor stability and high cost of precious metal electrodes have greatly limited their performance and large-scale applications.510 The development of next-generation electrocatalysts with enhanced stability and catalytic activity is an ongoing challenge in energy conversion and storage research.511,512 Electrocatalysts based on metal-free materials and inexpensive metals such as graphene,513,514 MXenes,515,516 MOFs,517–520 and COFs126,479 are currently an active research area. Due to the well-defined and programmable structures, the study of COF-electrocatalysts can truly correlate the structure and properties and promote a deeper understanding of electrocatalytic principles, thus providing guidance for the development and optimization of novel electrocatalysts.438,521,522 Compared to conventional metal-based materials, COFs have relatively less active sites and lower conductivity, making the direct application of most pristine COFs in electrocatalysis difficult. Methods such as introduction of heteroatoms,523,524 metalation,134,300,525 defect engineering,526 and preparation of composites527,528 are usually utilized to introduce catalytic active sites and further enhance the electrochemical properties of COFs. In particular, metalated COFs combine the advantages of COFs and metal-based materials, offering an alternative platform for the integration of conductivity, porosity, and catalytic activity into a single scaffold.

3.3.1. Electrochemical water splitting. 
Electrochemical water splitting, involving hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, is considered an attractive approach for the sustainable production of clean and renewable energy.510
In principle, HER, the process by which H+ or H2O receives electrons to be reduced to hydrogen gas, occurs through the Volmer–Heyrovsky–Tafel mechanism that involves three main reactions, namely initial electron transfer (Volmer step), electrochemical desorption (Heyrovsky step), and composite desorption (Tafel step). The reaction kinetics of the Volmer step are fast, and either the Heyrovsky step or the Tafel step is usually the rate-determining step of HER. As an example of HER application of metalated COFs, Feng et al. explored the HER performance of cobalt porphyrin-based Co-2DP deposited on a Ti electrode in a KOH solution.139 The electrode overpotential was 367 mV with a Tafel slope of 126 mV dec−1 at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 due to the CoN4 active site. Furthermore, rhenium-metalated COF-Re designed by Marinescu et al. catalyzes HER with a faradaic efficiency of 11% in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution at a potential of −1.1 V.227 After introducing Co(II) and Fe(II) into the porphyrin moiety of COF-Re, the faradaic efficiencies were increased to 55% and 65%, respectively. Moreover, in 2022, Chen et al. reported Ru(III)-metalated COF-1 as an efficient electrocatalyst for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4.529 Due to the protonation of the triazine ring, it has a Tafel slope of 140 mV dec−1 and an overpotential of 200 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.
OER is a four-electron process in which water is oxidized to oxygen. Due to the high energy barrier of O–H bond breaking and OO bond formation, the actual potential of OER is higher than the theoretical value (1.23 V).511 Therefore, OER is generally considered to be the rate-limiting step in electrochemical water splitting.
The Co(II)-metalated TpBpy COF was one of the first metalated COFs investigated for OER, as reported by Kurungot et al.136 Co-TpBpy-coated glassy carbon electrodes in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH = 7 required an overpotential of 400 mV to generate an anodic current density of 1.0 mA cm−2. The Tafel slope was 59 mV dec−1. The performance remained stable in 1000 cycle scans and 24 h activity tests. Furthermore, using polystyrene as a hard template, the introduction of interconnected macropores into the Co-TpBpy COF can facilitate the mass transfer process and enhance the accessibility of the active species, further improving the OER performance.235 The Tafel slope of Co-TpBpy with macropores was 54 mV dec−1, and the overpotentials were 380 and 430 mV at current densities of 10 and 50 mV cm−2, respectively.
In addition, in 2021, Chen et al. prepared Co@COF-Pyr and Ni@COF-Pyr catalysts for OER under alkaline conditions with pyrimidine as the binding site for metal ions.530 The Tafel slopes of Co@COF-Pyr and Ni@COF-Pyr are 100 and 145 mV dec−1, respectively, which are both significantly lower than that of their metal-free counterpart COF-Pyr (879 mV dec−1). Similarly, the COF-TpDb-TZ-Co formed by the coordination of tetrazole-functionalized COF-TpDb-TZ with Co(II) is an OER catalyst under alkaline conditions, with a Tafel slope of 82 mV dec−1, which is much lower than that of COF-TpDb-TZ (477 mV dec−1).531
The synergistic effect of Ni(II) and other metal ions can optimize the OER kinetics.525 For example, the Tafel slope of the heterobimetallic NiFe-Salphen-COF is 53 mV dec−1, which is lower than that of Ni-Salphen-COF (72 eV dec−1).300 The OER performance of IISERP-COF2 deposited with different ratios of Co(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 in 0.1 M KOH depends on the Ni:Co mass ratio.527 The best OER performance was obtained for the Ni:Co mass ratio of 3:1, with an overpotential of 258 mV and a Tafel slope of 38.9 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.
Recently, Deng et al. used machine learning to predict the performances of metalated 3D salen-COFs in OER and identified Ni-salen-COFs to be the best candidate.532 The synthetic experiments well verified the predicted results, and the Ni-salen-COF was overall better than the corresponding Co-, Fe-, Cu-, and Zn-based analogs in Tafel slope, charge transfer resistance, and electrochemical double-layer capacitance. This theoretical and experimental study not only develops the synthesis method of metalated COF electrocatalysts, but also provides insights for material design.
Several strategies may help to further enhance the OER properties of metalated COFs, including the use of monomers with OER activity to construct COFs533 and the preparation of composites with carbon nanomaterials to enhance electrical conductivity.528 Although these strategies have been confirmed to be effective for other types of materials, they have not been extended to metalated COFs.


3.3.2. Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction. 
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key electrode reaction in fuel cells and metal–air batteries.534 Although the detailed mechanism of ORR is not fully understood, it can be simply divided into a four-electron pathway and a two-electron pathway.535 In the four-electron pathway, O2 is reduced to H2O and OH− in acidic and alkaline media, respectively.536 In the two-electron pathway, O2 is reduced to either H2O2 (in acidic media) or HO2− (in basic media). Subsequently, H2O2 or HO2− can either diffuse into solution or can be further reduced to H2O or OH−.537
Benefiting from tunable structures, large specific surface areas, and well-defined nanoscale pores, heteroatom-involved COFs have been explored as ORR electrocatalysts, but their performance is constrained by the limited active site density and poor conductivity.538 Metalation of COFs is demonstrated to be an effective approach to access COF-based ORR electrocatalysts with rich and precisely controlled electrocatalytically active sites.
Metal–N4 catalytic centers in metalloporphyrin-COFs are considered to be potential alternatives to noble metal ORR catalysts. On the basis of first-principles calculations, Xia et al. identified the crystal field stabilization energy of metals as an activity descriptor to predict the ORR performance of metalloporphyrin-COFs and predicted that iron(II) and cobalt Co(II) porphyrin-based COFs may be a superior catalyst for four-electron ORR.539 The experimental results obtained by Wu et al. were consistent with this prediction.540 Co-, Mn-, and Ni-metalated porphyrin-COFs, termed as M-TP-COF (M = Co, Mn, Ni), were prepared by [4+4] imine condensation. For M-TP-COF (M = Co, Mn, Ni), the onset potentials were 0.81, 0.75, and 0.72 V, respectively; the half-wave potentials were 0.73, 0.68, and 0.66 V, respectively; and the diffusion-limited current densities were 4.8, 5.0, and 2.2 mA cm−2, respectively. These data indicated that Co-TP-COF has better ORR performance than Mn-TP-COF and Ni-TP-COF. In addition, the electron transfer number of Co-TP-COF during ORR was determined to be 3.7, indicating that Co-TP-COF mainly catalyzed four-electron ORR in alkaline electrolytes.
It is clear that in addition to metal ions, the structure of COFs can also affect the ORR mechanism and therefore it is difficult to generalize the above trends to all imine-linked COFs. In 2020, Chen et al. systematically investigated the effect of metal ions in the imine-linked metalloporphyrin-COFs on the catalytic activity of ORR (Fig. 35).541 According to the disk current density and disk onset potential results obtained for the three oxygen-saturated electrolytes at pH of 12.6, 7.2, and 3.5, among the seven metalated COFs, COF-366-Fe had the highest ORR activity, followed by COF-366-Ni and COF-366-Mn. However, the three COFs with the highest selectivity for H2O2 generation were COF-366-Co, COF-366-Ni, and COF-366-Ir, as reflected by their electron transfer number and faradaic efficiency values. Among these, COF-366-Co had 91% H2O2 selectivity and 84% faradaic efficiency in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH, exhibiting high selectivity toward H2O2 generation via the two-electron ORR. Furthermore, the H2O2 productivity of COF-366-Co in an H-shaped electrolyzer was as high as 909 mmol (g h)−1 at a current density of 22 mA cm−2. This study demonstrates that metalated COF-catalyzed two-electron ORR is an attractive approach for decentralizing H2O2 production, providing a powerful complementary technique to the anthraquinone process used in industrial production of H2O2.

The fabrication of metal nanoparticle-loaded COFs has proved to be a feasible strategy for enhancing ORR performance by improving the electronic properties. The Pt@TM-TPT-COF electrocatalyst, with a Pt content of 6.4 wt%, was obtained by Jiang et al. via loading nanoplatinum in fully conjugated TM-TPT-COF.356 In 0.1 M HClO4 saturated with O2, Pt@TM-TPT-COF displayed an onset potential of 1.04 V and a half-wave potential of 0.89 V, which were 0.07 and 0.06 V lower than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The electron transfer number of Pt@TM-TPT-COF in ORR is 3.9–4 in the potential range of 0.2–0.8 V, indicating that Pt@COF mainly carried out four-electron ORR in acidic electrolytes. In addition, due to the immobilization of Pt by triazine N on the TM-TPT-COF scaffold and the high chemical stability of the TM-TPT-COF matrix, the current density of Pt@TM-TPT-COF retained 96% of the initial value after running for 50 h, highlighting the excellent stability of Pt@TM-TPT-COF.
Phthalocyanine-based CoPc-dx-COF catalyzed four-electron ORR in 0.1 M KOH, but its high resistance limits its performance.213 Simple mixing of CoPc-dx-COF with carbon materials improved ORR performance by increasing the conductivity. Moreover, high-temperature carbonization of metalated COFs is also a useful strategy for enhancing electrical conductivity and ORR activity.229,234,526,542


3.3.3. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. 
Sustainable energy demands and global climate change have spurred the development of methods to convert CO2 into value-added carbon products, motivating the broad research interest in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).543 CO2RR is a highly complex multi-proton and multi-electron transfer reaction with many reaction intermediates.544 The variety of possible CO2RR products—such as C1 compounds (e.g., CO, CH4, HCOOH, and CH3OH) and C2 compounds (e.g., acetic acid, ethylene, and ethane)—makes selectivity a formidable challenge.545 Furthermore, because most CO2RR reduction potentials are close to that of HER, HER is usually a competing side reaction that needs to be avoided as well.46,546
The application of metalated COFs in CO2RR began with the study of the electrocatalytic activity of cobalt porphyrin-COFs by Chang et al.134 Cobalt porphyrin-based COF-366-Co (Fig. 36A and B), as the first reported CO2RR COF-electrocatalyst, reduced CO2 to CO in NaHCO3 solution at an overpotential of −0.55 V with a faradaic efficiency of 90%. In a diaphragm electrolytic cell, COF-366-Co as the cathode coating material was maintained for at least 24 h with a total CO production of 36 mL mg−1. After the electrocatalytic reaction, the crystallinity and microscopic morphology of the recovered COF-366-Co were not significantly changed, allowing reuse for 5 times without decreasing the catalytic activity and selectivity. Although the electrocatalytic performance of the investigated COFs was comparatively poor, this landmark work highlights the high potential of metalated COFs as electrocatalysts for CO2RR.

In the follow-up study, a series of strategies were adopted to improve the CO2RR activity and selectivity of Co-metalated COFs (Fig. 36C). COF-367-Co with a larger pore size than that of COF-366-Co showed enhanced catalytic CO2RR activity, possibly due to adequate active site exposure.134 At an overpotential of −0.55 V, the 24 h CO production corresponding to COF-367-Co was 2.8 times higher than that of COF-366-Co, exceeding 100 mL mg−1, while the CO faradaic efficiency was comparable to that of COF-366-Co. In addition, the structural flexibility of metalated COFs provides an opportunity to fine-tune the active centers. Replacing the cobalt porphyrin in COF-367-Co with copper porphyrin with no CO2RR catalytic activity dilutes the active CoN4 sites, further improving the accessibility of the active site and enhancing the CO2RR activity, but decreasing the selectivity for CO2 reduction.134
The charge transport within the COF-layer allows electronic connectivity between remote functional groups and active sites, thus enabling precise regulation of CO2RR catalytic activity. Cobalt porphyrin-COFs modified with electron-withdrawing groups on the pore walls were reported by Yaghi et al. in 2018.547 The current density at a given electrolytic potential increases in the order of COF-366-Co, COF-366-(OMe)2-Co, and COF-366-F4-Co, which is consistent with the order of the intensity of the electron-absorbing effects observed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The CO2RR performance of COF-366-F4-Co is slightly decreased due to strong hydrophobicity, which is not consistent with the above-described observed trend.
The introduction of electron donors into porphyrin-COFs can enhance the conductivity and improve the electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. TTF-Por(Co)-COF containing tetrathiafulvalene has higher conductivity and carrier mobility than COF-366-Co; this is ascribed to the existence of efficient electron transfer from the tetrathiafulvalene scaffold to the cobalt porphyrin moiety.548 Electrochemical tests showed that the current density and the faradaic efficiency of TTF-Por(Co)-COF were higher than those of COF-366-Co over the tested potential range. For example, at an applied potential of −0.7 V, the faradaic efficiency of CO2 to CO conversion of TTF-Por(Co)-COF reached 95%, significantly higher than that of COF-366-Co (70.8%). Furthermore, on the basis of the same strategy, Cao et al. reported the installation of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene into the framework of a cobalt porphyrin-based COF to enhance the CO2RR activity.196 However, excessive electron transfer may lead to the hydrogenation of porphyrin N that degrades the long-term durability performance of the catalyst, which must be considered. Interestingly, crown ethers not only enhance electron transfer but also improve the hydrophilicity and CO2 adsorption of COFs. TAPP(Co)-B18C6-COF with 18-crown-6 as a scaffold, reported by Liu et al. in 2021, is an excellent candidate for the CO2RR catalyst with a maximum turnover frequency of 1267 h−1 at −0.9 V and a maximum CO faradaic efficiency of 93.3% at −0.7 V.549
The construction of 3D COFs is another effective approach to enhance the activity of CO2RR. The 3D COFs reduced the porphyrin stacking and allowed the electrocatalytic sites to be exposed to the electrolyte and CO2 as much as possible, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. The 3D-Por(Co/H)-COF synthesized by Cao et al. in 2022 with a Co content of 0.56 wt% achieved a high faradaic efficiency of CO up to 92.4% at −0.6 V in 0.5 M KHCO3.550 Its electrocatalytic activity was higher than that of COF-366-Co and other previously reported 2D porphyrin-COFs.
Growing porphyrin-COFs on the surface of conductive scaffolds can further optimize CO2RR performance. Zhu et al. synthesized COF-366-(OMe)2-Co@CNT using aminated carbon nanotubes as a template, in which the COF-366-(OMe)2-Co nanolayer grown on the carbon nanotube scaffold was only 0.9 nm thick, increasing the accessibility of the Co(II) active sites and conductivity.551 In CO2-saturated KHCO3, COF-366-(OMe)2-Co@CNT exhibited high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO, with a faradaic efficiency of 93.6% at −0.68 V and a current density of up to 40 mA cm−2 at −1.05 V, both of which are much higher than those of its counterparts without carbon nanotubes. Not surprisingly, although the thick COF-366-(OMe)2-Co coating increases the number of Co(II) active sites, it also blocks the electron transport channel from the carbon nanotubes to Co(II), weakening the synergistic effect and thus is detrimental to CO2RR.
In addition to cobalt porphyrin, cobalt phthalocyanine, which also has CoN4 active sites, is also an effective molecular catalyst for CO2RR.552,553 Since 2020, several examples of 2D cobalt phthalocyanine-COFs for CO2RR have been reported.147,212,216,220 In these COFs, the metallophthalocyanines are connected by strong covalent bonds, including phenazine, imide, and dioxin linkages, to form robust planar sql lattices. On the one hand, electrons can be transported in the planes through the highly conductive regular lattices. On the other hand, the metal-on-metal columns formed by metallophthalocyanine stacking promotes electron transport in the direction perpendicular to the 2D layer. Therefore, these COFs have high CO2RR activity and CO selectivity (Table 5). For example, as reported by Jiang et al., CoPc–PI-COF-1 provided large CO partial current densities of 21.2 mA cm−2 at −0.90 V and 9.4 mA cm−2 at −0.7 V, associated with its high conductivity of 3.72 × 10−3 S m−1. CoPc–PI-COF-1 was stable for 40 h in an electrocatalytic test at −0.70 V, showing no performance decay with a turnover number (TON) as high as 277000.220 It is important to mention the contribution of irreversible chemical bonds in dioxin-linked COFs to the durability of the CO2RR.147,212 The CoPc–TFPN COF was stable for 60 h at −0.9 V and the faradaic efficiency of CO was maintained at 94.5–97%.212 In addition, nickel phthalocyanine-based NiPc-COF was also used for CO2RR, showing a CO faradaic efficiency of approximately 96% and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.05 s−1.218

Although robust π–π stacking is beneficial for cross-layer electron transport, it limits the adequate exposure of CoN4 active sites to some extent. The synthesis of Co(II)-metalated 3D COFs can spatially reduce the stacking of cobalt-phthalocyanine to increase the accessibility of CO2 to CoN4. Following this approach, Jiang et al. synthesized CoPc–PI-COF-3 with a pts topology and it possessed an adsorption capacity of 21 cm3 g−1 for CO2 at 298 K and 1.0 bar.85 Although its conductivity of 0.21 mS m−1 is an order of magnitude lower than that of the common 2D phthalocyanine-COFs, resulting in its slightly higher Tafel slope (117 mV dec−1) and much larger charge transfer resistance, its CO2RR activity is satisfactory due to the full exposure of the CoN4 active sites. A maximum faradaic efficiency of 96% with a partial current density for CO of 31.7 mA m−2 was obtained for CoPc–PI-COF-3 at −0.9 V. In addition, the CoPc–PI-COF-3 electrode exhibited excellent long-term durability, maintaining a faradaic efficiency of more than 90% with TON and TOF of 35500 and 0.6 s−1 respectively, for 20 h of continuous running at −0.8 V. Only 0.18% of cobalt leaked from the electrode into the electrolyte.
Rhenium–carbonyl complexes are well-established electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to CO, but no additional advantage was gained by combining them with COFs.239 The faradaic efficiency of COF-2,2′-bpy-Re (81%) was lower than that of the corresponding molecular catalyst (99%). Even more unfortunately, the CO2RR activity of COF-2,2′-bpy-Re significantly decreased after 30 min of controlled potential electrolysis, because of its poor electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and mass transfer kinetics. Fortunately, the immobilization of manganese–carbonyl complexes in COFs strongly enhances the CO2RR activity. In 2021, Lloret-Fillol et al. prepared a Mn(I)-metalated COF as a CO2RR electrocatalyst by grafting Mn(CO)5Br on COFbpyvia CO–bipyridine ligand exchange.246 The COFbpyMn|NT composite, composed of COFbpyMn and multiwalled carbon nanotubes, exhibits higher CO2RR activity than the corresponding molecular electrocatalyst composite fac-Mn(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Br|NT. In 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution, the CO faradaic efficiency of COFbpyMn|NT was 62% under optimized conditions, while that of fac-Mn(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Br|NT was only 13%, and the TOF of COFbpyMn|NT was 627 h−1, which was 15.7 times higher than that of fac-Mn(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Br|NT. Spectroelectrochemical characterization showed that Mn(–I) is a key intermediate in CO2RR, while the Mn(0)–Mn(0) dimer negatively affects CO2RR. Due to the structural limitation of COFbpyMn, the Mn(0)–Mn(0) dimer cannot be formed within the framework, leading to improved CO2RR activity.
Copper-complexes are a class of heterogeneous CO2RR electrocatalysts with a tendency to produce hydrocarbons, alcohols, and carboxylic acids.554 Copper-metalated COFs were explored for CO2RR to obtain methane. In 2022, Lan et al. synthesized multi-dimensional superstructures of COF-366-Cu as CO2RR catalysts based on copper-porphyrin.555 The CH4 faradaic efficiencies of the COF-366-Cu hollow sphere, nanofiber, and nanosheet are 68.2, 71, and 64.2% respectively, with CH4 partial current densities of 194.7, 248.6, and 177.3 mA cm−2 at a potential of −0.9 V. The electrochemical double-layer capacitances of the hollow sphere, nanofiber, and nanosheet are 2.07, 2.73, and 1.2 mF cm−2 respectively, while the charge transfer resistances are 6.51, 5.68, and 9.83 Ω respectively, indicating that morphology modification affects not only the contact between the electrolyte and the Cu(II) active sites, but also the transfer of electrons from the catalyst surface to CO2, thus affecting the CO2RR performance. It is important to mention that ethylene was not avoided in this CO2RR process, and the faradaic efficiencies for ethylene of the hollow sphere, nanofiber, and nanosheet were obtained as 14.6, 16.6, and 5.6%, respectively. Moreover, for all three COF-366-Cu morphologies, the CO2RR performance is better than that of their metal-free counterpart (COF-366) for which HER mainly occurs to obtain hydrogen. Similarly, the AAn-COF-Cu nanofiber obtained by immobilizing Cu(II) at the β-ketoenamine-linkage in AAn-COF provided a CH4 faradaic efficiency of 77% with CH4 partial current density of −128.1 mA cm−2 at a potential of −0.9 V under optimal conditions, while the ethylene faradaic efficiency dropped to less than 5%.556 However, HER is still present with an H2 faradaic efficiency of approximately 15%. Furthermore, the zinc-based analog AAn-COF-Zn mainly catalyzes CO2RR to CO and HER to H2, and the cobalt-based analog AAn-COF-Co shows almost no CO2RR activity within the tested potential range.
Covalent attachment of basic groups to copper-metalated COFs to enhance CO2 uptake can inhibit competitive HER and improve CO2RR selectivity. As shown in Fig. 37A–C, Cu-Tph-COF-Dct modified with 4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl groups on the pore wall exhibited enhanced CO2 adsorption (61.4 cm3 g−1, 273 K) and elevated CO2 adsorption enthalpy (25.9 kJ mol−1).557 In a KOH solution, Cu-Tph-COF-Dct exhibited a total current density of 537.4 mA cm−2 at −1.1 V that was higher than that of the unmodified Cu-Tph-COF-OH (394.2 mA cm−2), indicating enhanced electrocatalytic activity. At the optimal potential of −0.9 V, the faradaic efficiency of Cu-Tph-COF-Dct is approximately 80% for CH4 and is nearly 20% for H2, while the faradaic efficiency values for CO and ethylene are negligible. Mechanistic studies suggest that the amino and triazine N enhanced the uptake and activation of CO2 and promoted the reduction of CO2 to CO that was subsequently enriched near the Cu(II) centers and reduced to CH4.

Careful design of the Cu coordination environment in COF-supported Cu electrocatalysts can enhance kinetic viability and improve product selectivity to obtain a wide variety of C2 products in aqueous solutions. In 2020, Yang et al. synthesized the Cu(II)-loaded COF of CTF-Cu-4.8% by post-synthetic metalation of the CTF-B COF, as shown in Fig. 37D–G.249 According to the XANES and EXAFS spectra, the oxidation state of Cu in CTF-Cu-4.8% was assigned as +2, and the coordination environment was designated as [CuN2Cl2]. In the H-shaped cell, the liquid products given by CTF-Cu-4.8% are formic acid and a small amount of acetic acid, and the gaseous products include CO, H2, methane, and ethylene. At a potential of −1.30 V, the main products are H2 and CO. As the potential increases, the faradaic efficiencies of CO and H2 gradually decrease, while the faradaic efficiency of hydrocarbons (i.e., methane and ethylene) increases. Specifically, faradaic efficiencies reach their respective maximum values of 30.6% at −1.47 V for ethylene and of 72.0% at −1.55 V for methane. Time-dependent XANES and EXAFS spectra indicated that during electrolysis, Cu(II) was reduced to form copper-clusters. The aggregated copper atom clusters confined within the CTF-B matrix are the true active sites of CO2RR. Notably, the size of the generated copper atom clusters is approximately 1.09 nm due to the steric confinement effect of CTF-B, which effectively avoided the formation of large nanoparticles and ensured excellent durability during CO2RR. Furthermore, CTF-Cu-4.8%-catalyzed CO electroreduction mainly produced ethylene and acetate with the maximum faradaic efficiencies of 35.0% for ethylene and 33.4% for acetate, but no formate was obtained. Not surprisingly, for the unmetalated CTF-B, only HER was observed, indicating the key role of Cu-metalation in CO2RR.
Although some progress has been made in replacing noble metal catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2RR, the application of metalated COFs in CO2RR is still in early stage. Taking full advantage of COFs to precisely control the active metal sites with desirable geometric distribution at the atomic level is a promising research direction in this field. In addition, the effect of the COF matrix on the CO2RR process is also worth investigating to fully understand the structure–performance relationship.


3.3.4. Electrocatalytic N2 reduction. 
Ammonia plays a crucial role in the production of fertilizers, dyes, and explosives. The Haber–Bosch process, an energy- and capital-intensive process for the synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen at high temperatures and pressures established in the early 20th century, is still the main method for the industrial production of ammonia.558 Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is very attractive for achieving sustainable and flexible alternative to the Haber–Bosch process for ammonia production.559 To date, iron and titanium phthalocyanine-based COFs have been reported as potential NRR catalysts.
As reported by Feng and co-workers in 2021, in nitrogen-saturated 0.01 M H2SO4, the iron phthalocyanine-based FePc-pz COF gave an ammonia faradaic efficiency of 31.9% and an ammonia yield of 33.6 μg (h mg)−1 at −0.1 V.148 The FeN4 active sites in the FePc-pz COF readily adsorbed N2 and the π-back interaction between the 3d electrons of Fe(II) and the π* antibonding orbital of N2 led to N2 activation. In addition, the CoPc-pz COF induced effective N2 adsorption and activation as well, but its high HER activity greatly inhibited NRR. The N2 adsorption of the MPc-pz COF (M = Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn) is weaker than that of the FePc-pz COF, thus providing poor NRR activity with NH3 faradaic efficiencies below 10%.
One year later, Jin et al. reported the NRR activity of Ti-metalated COFs.560 In N2-saturated 0.05 M HCl, TiPc-COF provided a maximum NH3 faradaic efficiency of 34.6% at −0.4 V and a maximum NH3 yield of 27 μg (h mg)−1 at −0.7 V. The TiN4 sites in TiPc-COF favor adsorption of N2 rather than H+, thus inhibiting HER. The interaction of 3d electrons of Ti with the π* antibonding orbitals of N2 enables N2 activation, which is beneficial for NRR.
In addition, Su et al. screened 20 metallophthalocyanine-COFs by density functional theory calculations, suggesting that a molybdenum phthalocyanine-based COF may be the most efficient NRR catalyst, in which the hybridization of Mo 4d and N2 2p orbitals plays an important role in promoting NRR.561 Sarkar et al. reported similar results showing that Mo-salphen-COF has a theoretical faradaic efficiency of 41% for NRR based on density functional theory calculations.562

3.4. Photocatalysis
Efforts to develop clean energy sources have remained continuous due to the depletion of traditional energy sources and the environmental pollution problems they cause.563 Solar energy, an abundant renewable energy source, is one of the most promising renewable energy sources for replacing fossil fuels and mitigating the global energy crisis.564 Solar-driven chemical processes, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and organic reactions, have attracted great research interest.
In 2014, Lotch et al. reported the first example of the HER using COFs under visible light with platinum as a co-catalyst.565 Since this pioneering work, COFs have been extensively developed for photocatalysis.125,566 In general, photocatalytic reactions induced by COFs involve four main steps: first, the COF absorbs light with energy greater than the band gap; then, electrons in the valence band are excited to the conduction band, while the corresponding holes are formed in the valence band; next, the electrons and holes (collectively called photogenerated carriers) migrate to the COF surface; and finally, the electrons induce reduction reactions, while the holes induce oxidation reactions.567
COFs are ideal platforms for photocatalysts, offering some distinct advantages.568 First, COFs are synthesized from predesigned monomers, thus allowing for the integration of specific functions. Second, the adjustable pore metrics and high crystallinity of COFs help to suppress the charge recombination of the photoexcited states. Third, the π-conjugated structure within the COF-layers and the π-electron columns between the layers enable high charge carrier mobility. In addition, the high stability of COFs can effectively prevent photodegradation and performance degradation during long irradiation.569 All these advantages endow COFs with great potential for application in photocatalysis.570
The application of metalated COFs in photocatalysis is attracting attention.567 In addition to directly catalyzing photoreactions, the incorporated metal ions can adjust the band gap and visible-light absorption to modulate the optical properties of COFs. For example, the embedded Pt nanoparticles can be the co-catalysts to enable recovery and reuse, while Ag(I) and Fe(III) can be the OER sacrificial agents.571 Furthermore, conventional semiconducting photocatalytic materials, such as CdS,572–574 TiO2,364,575 Bi2WO6,576 and Ni(OH)2,577 can be combined with COFs to form heterojunctions, promoting the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, inhibiting electron–hole recombination, and optimizing the photocatalytic activities of the resulting materials.578 All these features empower metalated COFs as functionally oriented multifunctional platforms for designing efficient photocatalysts.
In this section, we will introduce the applications of metalated COFs in photocatalysis, including photocatalytic HER and CO2RR, pollutant removal, and organic transformations.

3.4.1. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
Photocatalytic HER based on a ternary system of semiconductors, cocatalysts, and sacrificial agents is an effective means of converting solar energy into hydrogen energy.579
Due to their broad light absorption capacity, porphyrin-COFs have been shown to be good photocatalysts. Embedding different metal ions into porphyrin units can tune the photophysical properties and thus optimize the photocatalytic activity. In 2021, Wang et al. reported the synthesis of acylhydrazone-linked MPor-DETH-COFs (M = Co, Ni, Zn) with metalloporphyrins and their HER activities (Fig. 38).580 With the aid of a co-catalyst (Pt) and a sacrificial agent (triethanolamine), the generated MPor-DETH-COFs (M = Co, Ni, Zn) splitted water to produce hydrogen under visible-light irradiation, and their catalytic performance increased in the order of Co, Ni, and Zn. Of note, MPor-DETH-COFs (M = Co, Ni, Zn) have similar optical band gaps (1.82–1.88 eV) but vastly different charge carrier dynamics. The 3d7 Co(II) in CoPor-DETH-COF leads to significant porphyrin-to-metal charge transfer, which inhibits photogenerated charge carrier migration, resulting in the worst HER performance. While the 3d10 Zn(II) strictly forbids ligand-to-metal charge transfer, the photogenerated holes of ZnPor-DETH-COF can smoothly migrate to the surface through the porphyrin-on-porphyrin column, and the electrons can migrate to the surface along the Zn-on-Zn column, which results in a long excited-state charge separation lifetime. Ultimately, the photogenerated electrons migrate to the Pt co-catalyst for the HER to generate hydrogen, while the holes are quenched by the triethanolamine sacrificial agent.

(B) Frontier orbital energies of MPor-DETH-COF (M = Co, Ni, Zn). (C) HER rates of MPor-DETH-COF (M = Co, Ni, Zn) in phosphate buffer solution with the help of H2PtCl6 and triethanolamine under a Xe lamp (300 W, >400 nm). 
Metal ions bound to COF-scaffolds can also regulate charge carrier separation and transfer. In 2022, Yu et al. reported a Zn(II)-involved hollow COF cage of Zn@H-TpPa for HER under visible-light irradiation.581 Thereinto, Zn(II) enhances the polarity of the framework that is favorable for photogenerated charge separation. Moreover, Zn(II) causes the upward shift of both conduction and valence bands in H-TpPa, thus increasing the reduction potential of photogenerated electrons and promoting H2O reduction. In addition, the hollow morphology of Zn@H-TpPa facilitates mass transfer, which also enhances the HER activity. As a result, Zn@H-TpPa achieves an HER rate as high as 28 mmol (g h)−1 in phosphate buffered saline upon visible-light irradiation under the given conditions.
Pt is widely used as a co-catalyst for the HER due to its low overpotential and effective formation of Schottky junctions on COF surfaces.582 Typically, the H2PtCl6 precursor in the photoreaction system is in situ reduced to Pt(0) for HER catalysis, which complicates the Pt recovery. Very recently, Zhang and co-workers designed reusable platinum single atoms that were anchored on the β-ketoenamine-linked TpPa-1 COF for photocatalytic water splitting.351 The resulting Pt single atoms in Pt1@TpPa-1 possessed the six-coordination chemical environment of [PtC3NCl2], which acted as the electron collector to improve photogenerated carrier transfer. As expected, Pt1@TpPa-1 was extremely catalytically active, with a high HER rate of 719 μmol (g h)−1 and a TOF of 19.5 h−1 under visible-light irradiation. Importantly, Pt1@TpPa-1 was durable over four recycling runs.
Much work has been done to try to replace expensive Pt co-catalysts with inexpensive metals such as Cu(II),583 Ni(II),584 and Co(II).250,585 The coordination of metal ions with COFs is not only feasible but also results in better recoverability than the direct addition of the corresponding inorganic salts to the HER system.
Furthermore, another effective way to reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is to fabricate heterojunctions of COFs and semiconductors. The interfacial charge transfer between the two components in the heterojunction physically separates electron–hole pairs, thus enhancing the HER. For example, in 2021, Shi et al. reported a SnS2/TpPa-1-COF heterojunction prepared by the hydrothermal method.376 Its HER rate under xenon lamp irradiation (>420 nm) without an additional co-catalyst reached 2.47 × 103 μmol (g h)−1, which is superior to that of TpPa-1-COF with Pt co-catalyst. Mechanistically, after electron and hole pairs were generated by both TpPa-1-COF and SnS2 under light irradiation, photogenerated electrons were transferred from TpPa-1-COF to the SnS2 surface, while photogenerated holes were transferred in the opposite direction. As a result, electrons and holes accumulated on SnS2 for the reduction reaction of H2O and on TpPa-1-COF for the oxidation reaction of the sacrificial agent (vitamin C), respectively. In this way, the photogenerated electrons and holes were spatially separated, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic HER activity. Based on the same principle, in the MOF/COF heterostructure of Cu3(HHTP)2 and TpPa-1, the Cu3(HHTP)2 MOF provides low interfacial charge transfer resistance as an electron acceptor, thus enhancing the HER rate nearly 100-fold compared to TpPa-1 alone.586 Theoretically, COF-based heterojunction photocatalysts are rich in possibilities,573,587–589 and the compositions, bonding forms, and energy band positions are highly controllable,590 which provides more chances to design low-cost, highly active HER photocatalysts in the future.
The more relevant literature on metalated COF-based photocatalysts for the HER is summarized in Table 6 to facilitate comparison of their properties and to provide information for designing new materials.204,250,351,352,364,376,580,581,583,585,586,591,592

3.4.2. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction. 
Photocatalytic production of solar fuels using CO2 as a carbon source is a promising strategic goal for securing future sustainable energy supplies and addressing global climatic changes.593 Over the past half century, various photocatalysts, including TiO2,594 metal sulfides,595 layered double hydroxide,596etc., have been developed to optimize light capture, charge separation, and activation of CO2, but they still face deficiencies such as low efficiency, unsatisfactory economic viability, poor selectivity, and difficulty in recycling.597,598 COFs, as a class of highly customizable porous materials whose light absorption capacity, semiconductor properties, and mass transfer abilities can be optimized through the design of the structure, have shown promise in CO2RR.599 Metals such as Co, Ni, Re, and Ru have been used in the synthesis of metalated COFs to improve the photocatalytic CO2RR. The roles of metalation include, but are not limited to, providing active centers for CO2 capture and activation, altering the CO2 reduction products (e.g., CO, HCOOH, and CH3OH), and inhibiting the unintended HER.
Cobalt porphyrin-based COFs are attractive catalysts for photocatalytic CO2RR due to their broad absorption extending into the near-infrared region, the efficient adsorption of CO2 by Co(II), and the activation of CO2 by CoN4.600 For example, in the presence of vitamin C as the sacrificial agent and Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)3Cl2 as the photosensitizer, the imine-linked COF-367-Co nanosheets with a thickness of 1.15 nm reduced CO2 to CO in water at a high rate of 10162 μmol (g h)−1 under the irradiation of a xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm high-pass filter.601 The ultrathin COF nanosheets are favourable for mass transfer and exposure of the active sites, resulting in 82-fold and 6-fold enhancements in activity and CO selectivity, respectively, over those of their bulk counterparts.
In addition, sp2C-linked COFs have a fully conjugated structure, which provides a channel for photogenerated electron transfer. As shown in Fig. 39, Ye et al. grafted Co(II) on a 2,2′-bipyridine-derived sp2C-COFdpy to prepare the photocatalyst for CO2RR.602 The absorbance edge of sp2C-COFdpy was located at 640 nm with a band gap of 2.03 eV, while after Co(II)-metalation, sp2C-COFdpy-Co had a wider absorption range than sp2C-COFdpy, and its absorbance edge was extended to 733 nm with a band gap of 1.83 eV. Thus, Co(II)-metalation enhanced the light absorption of the photocatalyst in the long wavelength region, which is conducive to the photocatalytic CO2RR. In water, sp2C-COFdpy-Co produced 6.01 mmol g−1 CO after 6 h upon visible-light irradiation, while the unmetalated sp2C-COFdpy yielded only 0.17 mmol g−1 CO. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy showed that Co(II)-metalation effectively inhibited charge recombination and boosted intramolecular electron transfer, thus enhancing the CO2RR. Furthermore, Co(II)-metalation suppressed the HER. The pyridinyl group in sp2C-COFdpy was a good hydrogen evolution site, leading to an HER rate of 670 μmol (g h)−1 under the given conditions, whereas the electron transfer from N to Co in sp2C-COFdpy-Co made it difficult for electrons to transfer to H2O, resulting in an HER rate of sp2C-COFdpy-Co of only 1/3 of that of sp2C-COFdpy. Ultimately, with enhanced absorption, fast photogenerated electron transfer, and suppressed HER, the selectivity of sp2C-COFdpy-Co to CO was as high as 81.4%, while that of sp2C-COFdpy was only 1.5%. Based on a similar design, Co-FPy-CON nanosheets also provide highly dispersed active CoN4 sites for the CO2RR, effectively reducing CO2 to CO under visible light irradiation with the assistance of an Ir(III)-complex as the photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor.603

The same year, Wang et al. studied the effect of different metals on the CO2RR.186 By comparing the performances of the tetraphenylene/metalloporphyrin coexistent NiP-TPE-COF and CoP-TPE-COF, it was found that Co-metalation significantly enhanced the catalytic activity, but Ni-metalation improved the CO2-to-CO selectivity. The reason for this difference is that CoN4 has a higher affinity for CO2 than NiN4, while NiP-TPE-COF has a higher propensity to capture protons for the proton transfer reduction of adsorbed CO2 than CoP-TPE-COF. A similar finding was obtained by Zou et al. using metallo-2,2′-bipyridine-COFs as a model, with Ni-TpBpy exhibiting 96% CO selectivity, higher than the 41% CO selectivity of Co-TpBpy.604 This study highlighted that 2,2′-bipyridine, besides as a chelating unit for Ni(II), makes additional contributions to improving the catalytic activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction by facilitating CO2 activation and inhibiting competitive H2 evolution. Inspired by this insight into the structure–property relationship, in 2022, Wang et al. further investigated the CO2RR activity of Ni(II)-metalated COFs with different coordination linkages.605 H-COF-Ni containing β-ketoenamine–Ni(II) has a higher CO yield (5694 vs. 1960 μmol g−1 in 2 h) and slightly lower selectivity (87 vs. 93%) than I-COF-Ni with imine–Ni(II). The coordination environment provided by β-ketoenamine linkage was more favorable for CO2 adsorption, activation, and photoreduction than that of imine linkage, leading to a higher CO2RR performance of H-COF-Ni than I-COF-Ni. Although imine could promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons along the nickel bridge between the I-COF-Ni layers, the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers did not play a decisive role in the CO2RR in this system.
Since their discovery in the late 20th century, fac-chlorotricarbonyl(2,2′-bipyridine)rhenium(I) and its substituted bipyridine analogs have been known for their high CO2 reduction efficiency606 but are difficult to recover and reuse due to their homogeneous nature. In contrast, anchoring rhenium bipyridine carbonyl complexes on COFs is expected to overcome this deficiency and promises better photoreaction performance. In 2018, Huang et al. reported a COFBPDA-TTA with incorporated Re(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Cl for CO2 photoreduction.141 The presence of effective electron transfer from the COFBPDA-TTA skeleton to the loaded Re(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Cl moiety within Re-COFBPDA-TTA significantly inhibited charge recombination and distinctly promoted the adsorption and activation of CO2 at the Re(I) active sites. With triethanolamine as the sacrificial agent, Re-COFBPDA-TTA provided a CO yield of 15 mmol g−1 for 20 h with 98% CO selectivity upon visible-light irradiation. It is worth mentioning that the control experiments with isotope-labelled 13CO2 as the carbon source only yielded 13CO, and no 12CO was detected, confirming that the CO indeed came from the CO2 reduction rather than from the Re(I) carbonyl complex. Based on this design strategy, the Re(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Cl-loaded sp2C-linked Bpy-sp2C-COF was also prepared, and it had a wide absorbance range and high CO2 affinity.251 Upon illumination, there was charge transfer from the pyrene unit to the Re(I)-complex along the Re-Bpy-sp2C-COF scaffold, forming long-range electron–hole pairs in which the holes are quenched by a sacrificial agent, while the electrons participate in CO2 reduction. In this way, Re-Bpy-sp2C-COF produced CO in acetonitrile at a rate of 1040 μmol (g h)−1 with a selectivity of 81%, using triethanolamine as a sacrificial agent and a proton source. Furthermore, the additional supplementation of an Ir(III)-complex as a blue light photosensitizer enabled the rate of the CO2RR induced by Re-Bpy-sp2C-COF to be further increased to 1400 μmol (g h)−1 under optimized conditions due to the occurrence of electron transfer between the Ir(III)-complex and Re-Bpy-sp2C-COF via oxidative quenching. Overall, the immobilization of the Re(I)–bipyridine complex in the COF-scaffolds is a highly feasible strategy for optimizing photocatalytic CO2RR activity, which was initially understood through effective intramolecular charge transfer. Zheng et al. recently further rationalized this strategy by investigating ultrafast charge transfer dynamics in such Re(I)-metalated COFs via transient optical spectroscopy and time-dependent density-functional theory calculations. In particular, they emphasized that upon excitation with high-energy photons, the photogenerated electrons located at the highly excited level of Re(I) have a long lifetime; some long-lived electrons that are transferred back from Re(I) are also retained on the COF-scaffold. Both factors contribute significantly to the two-electron reduction of CO2, which did not receive enough attention in previous studies.
As mentioned earlier, formally, CO2RR is a process in which CO2 is reduced by sacrificial agents under illumination. Therefore, in most cases, sacrificial agents such as triethanolamine, vitamin C, and triethylamine need to be added to the CO2RR system to consume the photogenerated holes. Such sacrificial agents not only waste the oxidation potential of photogenerated holes but also increase the cost of the reaction. In 2019, Lan et al. reported a photocatalytic CO2RR that used water as the electron donor; this reaction could simultaneously yield CO and O2 by coupling the CO2RR with the OER.187 Electron-deficient metalloporphyrins and an electron-rich tetrathiafulvalene were selected as monomers for the construction of COFs, respectively responsible for the formation of photogenerated electrons and holes for CO2 reduction and water oxidation (Fig. 40A). The resulting TTCOF-M (M = Ni, Zn, Cu) had different energy band structures, where the energy bands of TTCOF-Zn and TTCOF-Cu spanned the reduction potential of CO/CO2 and the oxidation potential of O2/H2O and could utilize H2O for CO2 reduction (Fig. 40B). As expected, under visible light, TTCOF-Zn and TTCOF-Cu produced 10.33 and 8.65 μmol of CO in 60 h respectively, while producing half as much O2 as CO, indicating effective CO2RR and OER coupling (Fig. 40C). The activity of TTCOF-Ni was poor due to the energy band structure mismatch and the absence of an additional sacrificial agent. Furthermore, TTCOF-Zn could be reused for at least five times without loss of its catalytic activity basically.

Metalated COFs for photocatalytic CO2RR to formic acid or formates will be discussed next. In 2019, Lan and co-workers reported a series of transition metal-loaded DQTP-COF-M (M = Co, Ni, Zn).611 As shown, the different loaded metals exert a strong influence on the activity and selectivity of products. For example, DQTP-COF-Zn has high selectivity (90% over CO) for formic acid generation with a rate of 152.5 μmol (g h)−1 under xenon lamp irradiation. In contrast, DQTP COF-Co only generated CO under the same conditions. Very recently, Trabolsi and co-workers reported a Co(II)-metalated Co-PI-COF containing isoindigo and cobalt(II) porphyrin blocks which could trigger the CO2RR in CO2-saturated acetonitrile to produce formate at an average rate of 50 μmol (g h)−1.197 Besides, Ru(0)-metalated COFs can also reduce CO2 to HCOOH.323,614 These examples imply that the products of CO2 reduction are the result of a combination of the embedded metals and COF-frameworks, which are subtle and not easily predictable in advance.
In 2020, Jiang et al. found that regulating the oxidation state of cobalt in porphyrin-COFs can regulate the generation of HCOOH.615 The Co(II) in COF-367-CoII has a low spin state (S = 1/2) with six of the seven 3d electrons occupying the t2g orbital and one occupying the eg orbital, while all six 3d electrons in COF-367-CoIII are in the t2g orbital with S = 0 (Fig. 41A). The different spin states lead to the difference in CO2RR activity because the different 3d electron distributions and orientations can change the interactions between cobalt and CO2 (Fig. 41B). Specifically, the O 2p orbitals of CO2 overlap more with Co(III) 3dz2 than with Co(II) 3dxz or 3dyz orbitals, and the interactions of HCOOH with Co(III) and Co(II) follow the same trend, both of which lead to a stronger interaction of CO2 and HCOOH with COF-367-CoIII than with COF-367-CoII. Additionally, COF-367-CoIII induces a lower energy barrier for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH than COF-367-CoII, while the energy barrier induced by COF-367-CoIII for the further reduction of HCOOH to CO and CH4 is higher than that induced by COF-367-CoII. Therefore, compared with COF-367-CoII, COF-367-CoIII exhibits higher catalytic activity and selectivity for the photoreduction of CO2 to HCOOH. As a result, the HCOOH yield of COF-367-CoIII is 1.9 times higher than that of COF-367-CoII under the given conditions, and the HCOOH selectivity is 86% and 62%, respectively (Fig. 41C and D). This study provided a paradigm for optimizing the photocatalytic activity by tuning the electronic properties of the metal centers. In addition, more examples of CO2RR to HCOOH are listed in Table 8.197,252,323,611,614,615

3.4.3. Photocatalytic pollutant degradation. 
Although different methods have been developed for treating wastewater, there are still challenges in the environmentally sound treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater.616 Light can excite the photocatalyst to generate dissociated electrons and holes with redox activity, which can directly cause the organic pollutants’ degradation.617 In addition, photogenerated electrons and holes can also interact with water, air, or other additives (e.g., persulfate) to generate reactive oxygen species (including ˙OH, ˙O2−, 1O2, etc.), resulting in the breakage of unsaturated bonds in the pollutant molecules to degrade organic pollutants.618
In 2021, Zhao et al. examined the performance of COF-909(Cu) in the photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole.619 As shown, the absorption band of COF-909(Cu) covers almost the entire spectral range from 200 nm to 1500 nm due to the charge transfer between the COF-909 scaffold and Cu(II). In addition, COF-909(Cu) has a narrow band gap of 1.89 eV, and thus it can be more easily excited by light than COF-909 (2.34 eV). After 30 min of irradiation with a 50 W white LED, 98% of sulfamethoxazole in water was degraded. Mechanistic studies showed that photogenerated holes, ˙OH and ˙O2− are the main active substances that result in pollutant degradation. One year later, a copper-metalated Cu-Tp-Azo for the enhanced photodegradation of tetracycline was reported.620
COF-909-Fe, an analog of COF-909(Cu), is a versatile photodegradation catalyst.621 Besides a wide absorption range and a narrow band gap, COF-909-Fe has additional advantages. First, due to Fenton-like activity, COF-909-Fe can induce ˙OH production by decomposing H2O2. Second, the photogenerated holes and electrons can interact with H2O2 to generate O2 and ˙O2− upon illumination, and the diffusion of the generated active species within COF-909-Fe enhances Brownian movement and strengthens the mass transfer process. Third, the in situ O2 generated from COF-909-Fe exfoliates the large particles into nanoparticles, increasing the contact area with pollutant molecules. The obtained results showed that the particle size of COF-909-Fe was reduced from 4.3 μm to less than 400 nm under 300 mW cm−2 illumination for 1 h in 0.5% H2O2 solution, and tetracycline in water could be almost completely degraded in 2 h under the given conditions.
As we know, inorganic semiconductors, such as TiO2, Fe2O3, and CdS, have been widely used in photodegradation, but there is still room for enhancement of their performance.616 For example, the charge separation and migration rates can be further enhanced through the formation of a heterojunction composed of two inorganic semiconductors.622 However, this strategy does not solve the problems of their narrow light absorption range and poor long-term stability. The application of heterojunctions formed by inorganic semiconductors and organic materials (such as COFs) in photodegradation has been noticed.618 The π-conjugated COFs with a wide light absorption range, good chemical stability and a protective effect on inorganic semiconductors would lead to durable and efficient heterojunctions.623
Bismuth oxyhalides represent a class of semiconductor materials with a layered skeleton. It has been proven that these materials possess certain photocatalytic activities. Recently, Bachas et al. assembled azine-linked ACOF-1 with BiOBr to form a type II heterojunction ACOF-1@BiOBr via a hydrothermal reaction of bismuth nitrate and sodium bromide in the presence of ACOF-1.624 The complete degradation of methyl orange, rhodamine B, and methylene blue by ACOF-1@BiOBr only required 140, 40 and 40 min, respectively, under a 300 W mercury-xenon lamp, which was significantly shorter than when using ACOF-1 and BiOBr alone. The photogenerated electrons were enriched in the conduction band of BiOBr, and the photogenerated holes were enriched in the valence-band of ACOF-1 upon irradiation, which optimized the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and enhanced the photocatalytic properties. The photogenerated holes and electron-induced ˙O2− are the main active species for dye degradation. Based on the same strategy, BiOBr and TzDa COF were assembled to form a Z-scheme heterojunction BiOBr/TzDa, which can degrade rhodamine B by a variety of active substances including photogenerated holes, ˙O2− and ˙OH.625 In addition, the photogenerated electrons participated in the reduction of Cr(VI) to treat wastewater. Furthermore, Z-scheme heterojunctions based on Ag(I) semiconductors, including AgI/COF-PD626 and Ag3PO4/TpPa-1,377 have also been reported. They all show a good performance for the degradation of rhodamine B, acetaminophen, and pymetrozine. These studies emphasized that the different pollutant degradation paths can be realized by adjusting the COF-structures to meet the requirements for wastewater treatment.
The photoactivity of inorganic semiconductors is highly dependent on the particle size and specific surface area since the photodegradation reaction occurs at the particle surface. Reducing the particle size to greater than 10 nm can greatly improve their photocatalytic activity, but this method is often limited by nanoparticle agglomeration and deactivation. Embedding ultrasmall nanoparticles into COFs can ameliorate these deficiencies. For example, perovskites have very poor water stability and cannot be directly used for photodegradation. However, the EB-COF:Br-supported perovskite displays good cycling stability and degradation efficiency in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange in water.373 In addition, the role of COF-supports in the protection of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles has been validated, including but not limited to photocatalytic degradation applications.334,627 Another interesting example is TpTa-COF-supported ultrasmall Fe(III)-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (called Fe–TiO2) by a COF-supported confined growth method, which was reported by Zhang et al.369 The authors suggested that the interactions between amine and carbonyl groups of the COF with TiO2 provide favourable anchoring sites, facilitating the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles inside the COF pores. Upon 365 nm LED irradiation, methylene blue was completely degraded by Fe–TiO2@TpTa-COF within 20 min, while a 98% degradation rate was achieved within 180 min upon ambient light irradiation.
Due to the complex composition of sewage, photocatalysts that are designed to simultaneously degrade different types of pollutants, including organics, microplastics, heavy metal ions, and radionuclides, are urgently needed.628–634 The secondary pollution caused by photocatalysts is also a potential issue that requires attention. Due to the good chemical and photostability of COFs, the synthesis of multifunctional photodegradation catalysts based on multifunctional metalated COFs may be a promising research direction.


3.4.4. Photocatalytic organic transformations. 
In the photocatalysis mentioned above, photocatalytic energy is mainly achieved through photoinduced separation and migration of electrons and holes; therefore, the match between the energy level of the photocatalyst and the redox potential of half-reaction is very important.635 This match can be optimized by adjusting the metal species in COFs. However, in some cases, coulombic interactions between electrons and holes may be significantly promoted in the 2D COFs, leading to different photoexcitation mechanisms.636 Electrons and holes in bound states are called excitons, and their triplet states are crucial for promoting photocatalytic reactions.637 The spin–orbit coupling of metal-free semiconductors is weak, and the intersystem crossing rate is usually slow, leading the excitons to exist primarily in a singlet state. Heavy-atom doping (e.g., metal and iodine atoms) can be used to optimize the generation of triplet excitons by enhancing intersystem crossing. The interaction of the triplet excitons with the substrate leads to abundant reaction chemistry, the most common of which is the energy exchange between triplet excitons and ground oxygen through the Dexter coupling mechanism, resulting in the formation of 1O2, an excellent oxidant for green chemical synthesis.638 In this section, we will introduce the application of photocatalysis in organic transformation reactions involving the two aforementioned mechanisms, excitonic and charge-carrier aspects.
In 2020, Jiang et al. reported an example of changing the photosensitization mechanism by adjusting central metal ions in metalloporphyrin-COFs.144 As indicated in Fig. 42, the zinc porphyrin-based DhaTph-Zn COF converted singlet excitons into triplet excitons by facilitating energy transfer, thus inducing 1O2 generation. In contrast, the nickel porphyrin-based DhaTph-Ni COF promoted photoinduced electron transfer by inducing the dissociation of excitons into holes and electrons, leading to ˙O2− production. The two different active species lead to their different selectivity in α-terpinene oxidation. Upon irradiation with visible light from a 300 W xenon lamp, the DhaTph-Zn COF led to the oxidation of α-terpinene by 1O2 to 1-isopropyl-4-methyl-2,3-dioxabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene with 99% conversion and 85% selectivity, while the DhaTph-Ni COF exhibited 76% conversion and 81% selectivity toward p-cymene due to ˙O2− generation under the same conditions. Furthermore, the two COFs are suitable for different photocatalytic reactions. For example, the DhaTph-Ni COF can effectively catalyse the oxidative hydroxylation of phenylboronic acid to phenol (99% yield), while the DhaTph-Zn COF displays a high catalytic activity for the oxidation of methyl(phenyl)sulfane to (methylsulfinyl)benzene (82% yield). This interesting study shows that the rational design of photosensitive COFs with different metal species can facilitate the efficient synthesis of specific products by regulating excitonic effects.

(B) Yields of three kinds of photocatalytic reactions over DhaTph-Zn and DhaTph-Ni photocatalysts under an O2 atmosphere (1 atm) in acetonitrile upon visible-light irradiation. 
In 2020, Cui et al. reported a copper(II) porphyrin-based CuCOF2 with 3D tho topology, by which the generated 1O2 and ˙O2− can promote the conversion of phenylboronic acids to the corresponding phenol derivatives under 440 nm LED irradiation (81–93% yields).101 With cysteine and sodium formate, CuCOF2 can also catalyse the defluoroalkylation of trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatics and olefins in moderate-to-good yields but with a free radical mechanism induced by photogenerated carrier separation.
Visible-light photoredox catalysis is an invaluable tool in modern organic synthesis, in which light active metal-based catalysts (e.g., Ru-, Ir-, and Au-based complexes) with long excited-state lifetimes and high redox potentials allow the formation of radical intermediates, enabling substrate activation and driving the reaction.639–641 Modification of photoredox catalysts on COF-scaffolds makes the visible-light heterogeneous catalysis available. For example, the Neogi group reported that the tris(2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II)-derived Ru-TAPM-BPDCA-COF is a useful photoredox catalyst for the Strecker reaction (Fig. 43A).254 In water, N,N-dimethylaniline was converted to 2-(methyl(phenyl)amino)acetonitrile with a yield of 99%. In this process, the light induced exciton separation; the photogenerated electrons induced ˙O2− generation via single electron transfer; and the photogenerated holes oxidized N,N-dimethylaniline to the radical cation, completing the activation of the substrates. Furthermore, Neogi et al. reported similar Ru(II)-based COF photocatalysts for visible-light-mediated photoredox cross-dehydrogenative coupling of glycine esters with indoles, obtaining 19 coupling products in 45–95% yields (Fig. 43B).247

(B) Dehydrogenative coupling of glycine esters and indoles. (C) Photocatalytic S–C cross-coupling reaction between aryl iodides and thiols. (D) Decarboxylative difluoroalkylation and oxidative cyclization. 
In 2021, Van Der Voort et al. reported a triazine-based imine-linked COF decorated with single Ni sites (Fig. 43C).290 The obtained Ace-COF-Ni is an active photoredox catalyst for catalyzing the cross-coupling reaction between aryl iodides and thiols under visible light. This is the first report of integration of single transition metal active sites in a photosensitive COF with a two-component synergetic catalyst for organic transformation.
By post-synthetic metalation of an imine-linked COF with Pt(II) occurring selectively at the N donor (imine and pyridyl) in the larger pores, Beyzavi and co-workers synthesized Pt(II)-complex-loaded COF-UARK-49-Pt (Fig. 43D).288 The generated COF-UARK-49-Pt possesses an absorption band covering almost the entire visible spectrum and a band gap of 2.0 eV and can be a recyclable heterogeneous photocatalyst for decarboxylative difluoroalkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions.
Additionally, other metalated COFs have also been reported for photocatalysis, including Fe(III)-,226 Ti(IV)-,96 Bi(III)-,642 Pt(II)-,643 and Pd(II)-metalated COFs,305 all of which achieve substrate activation via photoinduced exciton dissociation.
In addition to homometallic COFs, heterobimetallic COFs have also been reported for photocatalysis. In 2021, Mas-Ballesté and co-workers reported Ir,Ni@Phen-COF which can promote the light-mediated Csp3−Csp2 cross-coupling between potassium benzyltrifluoroborates and aryl bromides.261 Upon illumination by a blue LED, the excited state Ir(III) activates the substrate through single electron transfer, while Ni(II) is responsible for the following coupling between the activated substrate and aryl bromides. Later on, Maji et al. reported a Ni-Ir@TpBpy COF which was prepared by integrating photoredox-active Ir(III) and Ni(II) in the 2,2′-bipyridine-involving TpBpy COF by dual post-synthetic metalation for performing a variety of photocatalytic C–N cross-coupling reactions.242 Of special note, the utility of the Ni-Ir@TpBpy COF is also highlighted by the preparation of a variety of drug molecules including flufenamic acid, tripelennamine, and flibanserin. In these two interesting cases, the cooperativity between Ir(III) and Ni(II) allows the heterobimetallic COF to display higher catalytic activity and stability than its homogeneous counterpart.
Due to the large π-conjugated structure, metalated COFs in fact have emerged as ideal platforms for integrating light capture and photocatalytic sites with all the advantages of heterostructured photocatalysts, including recyclability, chemical stability, and photostability. However, one of the major drawbacks of the currently reported metalated COF photocatalysts is their excessive dependency on the high-energy visible light (e.g., blue light). Many photosensitizers (e.g., metalloporphyrins, metallophthalocyanines, and Ru-based N3 dye) have broad absorption in the green, red, or even near-infrared range. Their redox potentials and excited state energies are theoretically suitable for photocatalysis, but the low intersystem crossing efficiency of these chromophores leads to poor catalytic performance, requiring further optimization. Using natural sunlight rather than artificial light sources for sustainable photochemical reactions may be a future research direction, which underscores the urgency of research on solar energy capture and photocatalytic strategies covering the entire visible spectrum.644


3.4.5. Photothermal catalysis. 
The coupling of light energy and thermal energy is a promising strategy to drive chemical reactions, which is known as photothermal catalysis.645,646 According to the reaction mechanism, photothermal catalysis can be divided into three subtypes.647
Type I: thermal-assisted photocatalysis. The high temperature (which is usually achieved by an external heat source) promotes photogenerated carrier migration and accelerates the photochemical reaction. Therefore, the primary reaction mechanism is still a photochemical pathway. This subtype has been widely used in the conversion chemistry of CO2, including methanation, reverse water gas shift reactions, and dry reforming reactions.647,648
Type II: photo-assisted thermocatalysis. In this subtype, the photothermal material absorbs light energy and converts it to thermal energy via localized surface plasmon resonance heating or nonradiative relaxation.648,649 Local overheating replaces the external heat source. The reaction occurring at elevated temperature still proceeds in the same way as the traditional thermally driven process, in which photogenerated charge carriers or excitons do not contribute to reactant activation in this subtype.650 To achieve the desired reaction temperature, the ability to absorb light and the photothermal conversion efficiency of materials are crucial. Materials with good photothermal properties include gold nanorods, nonstoichiometric metal chalcogenides, carbon materials, etc.651–653
Type III: photothermal cocatalysis. The photoreaction mechanism and thermal reaction mechanism intertwine or form a cascade of steps to drive the reaction, leading to a synergistic effect of photochemical and thermochemical pathways, as opposed to a simple addition of the two pathways.648
Copper porphyrins are common organic photothermal conversion materials due to the enhanced nonradiative transitions by Cu(II). Dong and co-workers successively reported a series of copper porphyrin-based CCOFs for type II photothermal catalysis (Fig. 44).143,145,654
 Fig. 44  Copper porphyrin-based COFs for photothermal asymmetric catalysis. (A) Au- and Pd-Loaded CCOF-CuTPP for catalyzing asymmetric coupling reactions. (B) Homochiral (R)-CuTAPBN-COF for catalyzing the enantioselective Strecker reaction. (C) (R)-CuTAPBP-COF as a chiral catalyst for the α-benzylation of aldehydes. 
In 2019, gold nanorods and palladium nanoparticles were introduced into CCOF-CuTPP as coupling reaction catalysts by in situ reduction, yielding Au@CCOF-CuTPP and Pd@CCOF-CuTPP respectively (Fig. 44A).143 Under visible-light irradiation, Au@CCOF-CuTPP induced the temperature of the reaction system (toluene/ethanol) to increase from room temperature to 58 °C, which greatly promoted the Henry reaction of benzyl alcohols with nitromethane in 93–99% yields with 94–98% ee. Meanwhile, Pd@CCOF-CuTPP induced the temperature to rise to 45 °C in dioxane and efficiently catalysed the three-component coupling reaction of aromatic aldehydes, aryl acetylenes, and cyclic secondary amines in 68–98% yields with ee above 90%. In addition, the chiral CCOF-CuTPP support provides a single chiral restriction space for high enantioselectivity.
In 2020, (R)-CuTAPBN-COF was synthesized by integrating chiral binaphthalene and copper(II) porphyrin into a single COF-framework (Fig. 44B).145 Of note, the catalytic Cu(II) sites and the chirality control of chiral binaphthalene species are not on the same entity, resembling what is happening in an enzyme pocket. Upon light irradiation (xenon lamp, 2.5 W cm−2), the reaction system (acetonitrile) increased from room temperature to 50 °C within 18 min, which significantly promoted the Cu(II)-catalysed Strecker reaction of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine and trimethylsilyl cyanide to obtain (S)-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5(4H)-yl)acetonitrile—a key intermediate for the synthesis of the antithrombotic drug (S)-clopidogrel—in 98% yield with 94% ee. Interestingly, the (R)-CuTAPBN-COF-induced Strecker reaction could also be effectively driven by natural sunlight, with a slightly decreased yield of 70% but with 92% ee. This result not only establishes a new synthetic process for the synthesis of (S)-clopidogrel but also affords a foundation for development of COF-based and solar-powered endothermic asymmetric catalysis.
Later on, Dong group reported additional Cu(II)-metalated CCOF by a similar approach (Fig. 44C).654 The obtained (R)-CuTAPBP-COF contains both Brønsted acid (phosphoric acid) and Lewis acid (copper porphyrin) catalytic sites. Upon visible-light irradiation, it can highly promote the intermolecular asymmetric α-benzylation of aldehydes via visible-light-induced photothermal conversion: for example, the reaction of propionaldehyde and 4-(bromomethyl)pyridine in methanol to form (R)-2-methyl-3-(pyridin-4-yl)propanal in 98% yield with 95% ee. Again, this type II photothermal catalytic reaction can effectively proceed under natural sunlight irradiation.
In addition to copper(II) porphyrin-COFs, the application of cobalt(II) porphyrin-COFs in photothermal catalytic CO2 cycloaddition was recently reported by Dong et al.655 In COF-PI-2, the cobalt(II) porphyrin and benzoimidazolium served as a photothermal conversion site and a catalytic site, respectively. Under irradiation with a xenon lamp at 80 mW cm−2, COF-PI-2 induced an increase in the temperature of the reaction system from 25 °C to 51 °C, which promoted the reaction of epibromohydrin with 1 atm CO2 to obtain 4-(bromomethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-one in basically quantitative yield. Interestingly, the CO2 cycloaddition herein is a “window ledge” reaction, and it can be conducted upon natural sunlight irradiation with a cycloaddition yield of up to 90%.

3.5. Thermocatalysis
Since the catalytic application of metalated COFs was first reported in 2011,129 the studies on metalated COF catalysts have drawn more and more attention.112–115,656–658 Metalated COFs have some unique advantages over conventional metal-based catalysts. First, COFs contain abundant and mutually independent 1D pore channels, which effectively enhance mass transfer and facilitate the contact of reactants with catalytic active sites, theoretically making all metal sites accessible.659 Second, the metal sites are uniformly distributed in the COF-matrix, preventing the leakage, agglomeration, and deactivation of the metal catalyst during the reaction.660–662 Third, COFs are highly stable, and thus, their structural integrity usually remains intact after multiple uses, which facilitates the recycling and reuse of catalysts and reduces the consumption of precious metals.112 Furthermore, the flexibility and versatility of COF design allow realization of multifunctional catalytic systems, such as chemo- and regioselectivity, asymmetric catalysis, and stereospecific polymerization.663,664
This section will be divided into 16 subsections according to the types of metal elements (Fig. 45), and each subsection will discuss the heterogeneous catalytic applications of metalated COFs along the order from high to low oxidation state.
 Fig. 45  Metal elements and their oxidation numbers in metalated COF catalysts. 

3.5.1. Palladium-metalated COF catalysts. 
Palladium catalysts, including Pd(II) and Pd(0), are commonly used catalysts with high catalytic activity, high selectivity and low usage.665,666 The alumina, zeolite, and carbon carrier supported Pd-catalysts can be repeatedly regenerated and activated; thus, they have a long service life.667,668 As a promising class of candidates for catalyst carriers, COFs have shown a unique value in palladium-catalysed reactions, including Suzuki–Miyaura, Heck, Sonogashira coupling reactions, and many others, making many difficult-to-achieve reaction processes possible.113,663
Pd(II)-Coordinated COF-LZU1, namely Pd/COF-LZU1, which was reported by Wang et al. in 2011, is the first example of metalated COFs used for heterogeneous catalysis.129 The Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction of aryl iodides with phenylboronic acid at 150 °C in p-xylene catalyzed by 0.5 mol% Pd/COF-LZU1 afforded the corresponding coupling products in yields of 96–97% (Fig. 46A). The less reactive bromobenzene derivatives also resulted in high yields of over 95% in 2.5–4 h. Furthermore, in the reaction of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene and phenylboronic acid, Pd/COF-LZU1 was reused at least four times without significant loss of activity but along with a slight crystallinity decrease.

(B) Region-selective Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of phenylboronic acid and aromatic halogens. (C) Heck reaction of styrene and iodobenzene.

(G) C–P coupling reaction of an aryl halide and secondary phosphine oxide. (H) Intramolecular oxidative coupling of diphenylamine. 
The lack of selectivity of Pd-catalysts in Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions makes it difficult to efficiently obtain halogen-substituted biphenyl-type compounds. In 2021, Chen et al. reported a series of COF-supported Pd-catalysts, namely Pd/COF-SMCx (X = 1, 2, 3, 4).669 The authors demonstrated that they can regioselectively catalyse the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of arylboronic acids and aryl halides, especially with halogenated arylboronic acids (Fig. 46B).
Triarylbismuth compounds are an eco-friendly alternative to phenylboronic acids. In 2019, Wang et al. reported that the coupling of 1-iodo-4-nitrobenzene with triphenylbismuthane afforded the coupling product in 96% yield in the presence of COF-NHC–Pd and K2CO3 at room temperature.278 Encouragingly, COF-NHC–Pd had satisfactory catalytic activity for the substrates containing either electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.
The Heck reaction is another famous Pd-catalysed coupling reaction between unsaturated halohydrocarbons and alkenes for the construction of C–C bonds.670 In 2016, Chai et al. reported the Pd(II)@X% BPy COF with different Pd loading for the Heck reaction (Fig. 46C).671 The authors demonstrated that the Pd(II)@75% BPy COF afforded the best catalytic performance. For example, the coupling of iodobenzene and styrene afforded stilbene with a yield greater than 90% in DMF with K2CO3.
A key challenge for the Heck reaction is the regioselectivity (limiting the insertion sites of the halogenated hydrocarbons) and stereochemical selectivity (obtaining an alkene with a single configuration). Recently, Ji et al. synthesized a Pd/COF-BTDH catalyst, in which Pd(II) coordinated to the imine linkage and its neighbouring hydroxyl group.292 With the help of Pd/COF-BTDH and copper(II) trifluoromethanesulfonate, the coupling of oct-1-ene with 2-phenyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane afforded (E)-oct-1-en-1-ylbenzene in 74% yield in the oxygenated N,N-dimethylacetamide at 40 °C for 48 h (Fig. 46D). The ratio of (E)-oct-1-en-1-ylbenzene and oct-1-en-2-ylbenzene was up to 50:1, and the ratio of (E)-oct-1-en-1-ylbenzene with other isomers reached 7:1. However, these two ratios were reduced to 5:1 and 1.3:1 when no COF-BTDH was present. Notably, the attempt to replace Pd/COF-BTDH with Pd/COF-LZU1 gave a disappointing result, suggesting that the pore wall environment of COF-BTDH played an important role in regulating the selectivity for the Heck reaction. Of course, the Pd/COF-BTDH-catalysed Heck reaction could be generally applied to a variety of aliphatic olefins, including styrene, vinylcyclohexane, and 4,8-dimethylnona-1,7-diene.
Pd(II) bound to 2,2′-bipyridine-based COFs with a wide range of catalytic activities has been used as a recyclable catalyst for various organic transformations. In 2021, Pan et al. reported a Pd(II)@TpBpy-COF which was demonstrated to be a catalyst for conjugate addition of arylboronic acids to unreactive α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids in aqueous media (water/acetone) (Fig. 46E).225 The yield was maintained at more than 70% after five catalytic cycles. The same year, Ma et al. reported an interesting Pd(II)-loaded COF catalyst based on an imine-linked dual-pore COF which can catalyse regioselective hydrocarbon activation reaction of benzo[h]quinoline in a heterogeneous way (Fig. 46F).243 Of note, the authors compared the catalytic activity of the Pd-loaded imine-linked dual-pore COF with its single-pore counterpart. The dual-pore Pd(II)@[(BPyDC)]x%-ETTA was more active than the single-pore Pd(II)@Py-2,2′-BPyDC because the dual-pore COF might be more favorable for the reactant and product diffusion within the framework, as suggested by the authors.
One year later, Zhang et al. reported a Pd(II)-coordinated azine-linked TFPT-Azine-COF for dehalogenative phosphorylation to form C–P bonds.672 It was found that the synthesized Pd/TFPT-Azine-COF is an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the Hirao reaction of bromobenzene with diphenylphosphine oxide to form triphenylphosphine oxide with 94% yield (Fig. 46G). In addition, Pd/TFPT-Azine-COF was suitable for a variety of para-substituted substrates, including fluoro-, chloro-, alkoxy-, nitro-, and formyl-substituted aryl halides. More importantly, Pd/TFPT-Azine-COF was stable under the given reaction conditions with no Pd(II) leaching or loss of activity after seven successive catalytic cycles.
Furthermore, the Pd(II)-anchored TpPa-1 COF was shown to be active for the intramolecular oxidative biaryl coupling to convert diphenylamine to 9H-carbazole with a 68% yield in pivalic acid (Fig. 46H).673
Compared with Pd(II), Pd(0) is more commonly used in heterogeneous catalysis for various organic functional group transformations (Fig. 47) and C–C coupling reactions (Fig. 48). Pd(0) embedded in a COF-matrix circumvents the aggregation of Pd nanoparticles during the catalytic process. For example, in 2020, Yue et al. reported Pd@COF-300 in which the amino defects in COF-300 were essential for obtaining ultrasmall monodisperse Pd nanoparticles.332 With increasing amino content, the Pd particle size decreased from above 5.0 nm to approximately 1.6 nm. As expected, Pd nanoparticles with a size of 1.6 nm showed the best conversion and selectivity for the oxidation of phenylmethanol to benzaldehyde. Because the framework with amino defects significantly stabilized the Pd nanoparticles, the catalyst was reused six times without any significant loss of performance.

(A) Pd@TpBpy COF as a heterogeneous catalyst for catalyzing the reaction of 2-bromophenol derivatives and terminal alkynes. (B) Pd@CCOF-MPC for catalyzing asymmetric Henry reactions of nitromethane and aromatic aldehydes. (C) Pd@CCOF-MPC for catalyzing asymmetric reductive Heck reactions of cyclohex-2-en-1-one and aryl bromides. 
It is known that the COF-supported Pd nanoparticles can act as a powerful catalyst for a series of organic reduction reactions, including nitro group reduction,14,316,328 partial hydrogenation of the alkyne group,317 and dehalogenation of chlorobenzenes.311,315 In 2018, Dong et al. reported COF-AO-supported Pd nanoparticles (termed as Pd@COF-AO) which displayed excellent catalytic performance in the conversion of 4-chlorophenol to phenol in ammonium acetate aqueous solution.311 After the catalyst was repeatedly used 5 times, no detectable aggregation or Pd leaching was observed, and its catalytic activity remained almost unchanged. The incorporation of Pd@COF-AO with thiol-functionalized polysiloxane via thiol−ene click reaction provided the standalone and elastic membrane. The obtained membrane was robust, permanently porous, uniform, processable, and water-permeable. Moreover, it can be used to construct highly efficient membrane-based microreactors for continuous-flow operation to promote chlorobenzene dechlorination in water at room temperature.
The same year, the same group fabricated Pd@COF@chitosan aerogels by the cross-linking of Pd@TpTe-1@chitosan with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether by a templated freeze-drying procedure. The resulting Pd@COF@chitosan aerogels can be used to build highly efficient continuous flow-through microreactors for chlorobenzene dechlorination in water at room temperature.315 The incorporation of COFs with polymer binders allows the processability of metalated COFs to be feasible, accelerating the construction of metalated COF-based devices for various applications.
In addition to reduction reactions, Pd(0) was also applied in C–C bond formation.271,312,313 In 2021, Zhao et al. reported SP-3D-COF-BPY-supported Pd nanoparticles for Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction.248 At the same Pd content, PdNP@SP-3D-COF-BPY showed less activity than Pd(II)@SP-3D-COF-BPY, which may result from the regular arrangement of Pd(II) in the COF-scaffold that can minimize the aggregation of the key intermediate Pd(0) in the catalytic process.
The application of Pd(0)-loaded COFs for catalytic synthesis of 2-substituted benzofurans was reported by the Banerjee group (Fig. 48A).224 Pd(0) nanoparticles with a size of 12 ± 4 nm were uniformly dispersed in the TpBpy COF at a content of 15.2 wt%. In the presence of the Pd@TpBpy COF and K2CO3, the reaction of 2-bromophenol and ethynylbenzene in DMF gave 2-phenylbenzofuran in 70% yield, while the commercially available Pd/C catalyst provided only 23% yield under the same conditions. In addition, this benzofuran synthesis was compatible with a variety of groups, including –CN, –NO2, –CHO, and halogen located on 2-bromophenol; alkyl, alkoxyl, halogen, –COCH3, and –N(CH3)2 located on phenylethynes; and aliphatic alkynes (e.g., ethynyltriisopropylsilane and ethynylcyclopropane), to afford the corresponding benzofuran products in 26–80% yields.
The CCOF-supported Pd nanoparticles for asymmetric synthesis were achieved in 2017.140 Dong and co-workers synthesized the C–N single bond-linked CCOF-MPC by heating a mixture of 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine and (S)-2-methylpiperazine in a dioxane solution of K2CO3 at 90 °C. After solution impregnation with Pd(NO3)2 in methanol and subsequent NaBH4 reduction at room temperature, Pd@CCOF-MPC was obtained as a brown-black powder with a palladium content up to 34.1 wt%. The incorporation of Pd(0) and the CCOF-framework allowed Pd@CCOF-MPC to be a highly active reusable asymmetric heterogeneous composite catalyst to effectively promote the Henry reaction (Fig. 48B) and reductive Heck reaction (Fig. 48C) in high yield with excellent stereoselectivity. For large-sized substrates, both Henry and reductive Heck reactions, however, afforded the desired products in quite low yields without any enantioselectivity, demonstrating that the reactions are intrapore catalytic processes.
In addition, COF-supported Pd nanoparticles have also been employed to catalyse tandem reactions. In 2014, Banerjee and co-workers realized the Pd(0)@TpPa-1-catalyzed sequential Heck–Sonogashira reactions under basic conditions. The catalytic activity was superior to that of the commercially available Pd/C catalyst.673 These Heck–Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions provided an effective method for preparing (alkynyl)(alkenyl)arenes in good yields, highlighting the usability of the catalyst for the regioselective formation of two C−C bonds in a one pot reaction.


3.5.2. Iridium-metalated COF catalysts. 
It is well-known that iridium-based homogeneous catalysts are widely used in catalytic hydrogenation, C–H activation, and C–C coupling reactions.674 However, the reports of iridium-metalated COF catalysts are relatively rare, although they are logically feasible.
As reported by the Beyzavi group, Ir(III) can be coordinated into the imine-linked COF by forming N–Ir and C–Ir bonds.289 The obtained iridacycle-decorated Py-1P-Ir COF exhibited more than tenfold efficiency enhancement in catalytic H2 evolution from sodium formate aqueous solution than its homogeneous counterpart. Of note, Py-1P-Ir COF could be reused at least five times without any significant decrease in crystallinity or catalytic performance, although partial imine bonds were reduced to C–N bonds.
Bipyridine-COF can also be employed to bind iridium for organic catalysis. In 2019, Ma and co-workers immobilized Ir(I) on a 2D Py-2,2′-BPyPh COF (Fig. 49).245 The obtained Ircod(I)@Py-2,2′-BPyPh exhibited excellent catalytic activity for C−H borylation of aromatic rings. Under the same conditions, neither the [Ir(μ-OCH3)(1,5-cyclooctadiene)]2 complex nor Py-2,2′-BPyPh COF exhibits catalytic activity. Furthermore, Ircod(I)@Py-2,2′-BPyPh possessed satisfactory recyclability and was compatible with a variety of electronically and sterically substituted substrates.
 Fig. 49  Iridium(I)-immobilized Ircod(I)@Py-2,2′-BPyPh COF for C–H borylation. 


3.5.3. Rhodium-metalated COF catalysts. 
Precise selectivity control in the metal-catalysed olefin hydroformylation is a long-standing challenge.675 In 2020, Fan et al. reported the triphenylphosphine-based COFs loaded with (acetylacetonato)dicarbonylrhodium(I) via Rh–P coordination bonds.273 The COF-confined Rh catalysts, Rh–P-COF, showed high TOF (above 2000 h−1), high aldehyde selectivity (99%) and excellent catalyst reusability (up to 5 cycles) for hydroformylation of olefins. The common side reactions, such as hydrogenation to alkane and isomerization to 2-alkene, were negligible. However, the regioselectivity in hydroformylation was dissatisfactory. For example, the hydroformylation of styrene yielded linear and branched aldehydes with a molar ratio of 1.1:1. Similar regioselectivity was also detected in the reactions involving straight-chain α-olefins, such as hex-1-ene and oct-1-ene. No regioselectivity was observed in the 4-chlorostyrene hydroformylation, yielding equal amounts of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)propanal and 2-(4-chlorophenyl)propanal.
In addition, the Rh-complexes can also be loaded by the COFs via metal–linkage coordination. By post-treatment of the chloro(2,5-norbornadiene)rhodium(I) dimer with TPB-DMTP-COF via ligand exchange, Li et al. prepared TPB-DMTP-COF-Rh, in which chloro(2,5-norbornadiene)rhodium(I) was stabilized by hydroxyl O and imine N atoms.676 TPB-DMTP-COF-Rh with 2.74 wt% Rh can be a highly active catalyst to promote the polymerization of phenylethyne to cis-transoidal polyphenylacetylene in toluene with high activity and selectivity. The polymerization catalyzed by TPB-DMTP-COF-Rh therein resulted in a similar or higher molecular weight and narrower molecular weight distribution than the polymerization catalyzed by the corresponding homogeneous catalysis due to the steric confinement of COF-pores. These catalytic reactions are also suitable for large alkynes. For example, the polymerization of alkynes with tetraphenylethene resulted in polymers with aggregation-induced emission properties, while the polymerization of an alkyne with an N,N-dimethylnaphthalen-1-amine block resulted in a pH-responsive fluorescent polymer. Due to the hydrophobicity of TPB-DMTP-COF-Rh, phenylacetylene easily enters the pores, and thus, the polymerization can be carried out in air and water. Of note, the catalytic activity of TPB-DMTP-COF-Rh significantly decreased after three catalytic cycles because the COF-pores were blocked by the generated polymers. This study highlights the promising application of metalated COFs in improving the stereoselectivity of polymerization.
In addition, COF-supported Rh(0) catalysts have also been reported. The Rh nanoparticle-loaded Rh/COF2 with 3.3 wt% Rh is capable of converting benzaldehyde to N-benzyl-1-phenylmethanimine via a one-pot tandem reductive amination in ammonia methanol solution at 2 MPa H2 with greater than 99% conversion and greater than 95% selectivity, as reported by Ma and co-workers in 2021.350


3.5.4. Ruthenium-metalated COF catalysts. 
One of the challenges of olefin metathesis is the competition between intramolecular ring-closing metathesis and intermolecular oligomerization. Very recently, Lotsch et al. reported a Ru@dHP-TAP COF catalyst with a Ru content of 42.3 μmol g−1 by loading a Hoveyda–Grubbs-type NHC–ruthenium species into the dHP-TAP COF.279 The authors demonstrated that the Ru@dHP-TAP COF catalyst exhibited an interesting size-dependent olefin metathesis driven by the spatial confinement of dHP-TAP-COF. For dec-9-en-1-yl undec-10-enoate which can enter the COF-pores, the reaction exhibited higher selectivity for intramolecular ring-closing metathesis to afford oxacycloicos-11-en-2-one. In contrast, the oversized dodecane-1,12-diyl bis(undec-10-enoate) mainly underwent the intermolecular reaction on the catalyst surface to give the oligomerization product.
Besides Ru ions, Ru(0) nanoparticles can also be supported and stabilized by COF-frameworks. In 2018, Dong and co-workers reported that heteroatom-enriched COF-ASB was an ideal support to load Ru nanoparticles to form Ru@COF-ASB. As shown, the obtained Ru@COF-ASB is able to highly promote one-pot tandem synthesis of imine products from benzyl alcohols and the corresponding amines under solvent-free conditions in air.321
Later on, a RuO2@TpBD-Me2 catalyst loaded with nanoscale RuO2 was reported by Kolen’ko and co-workers. It was demonstrated to be a good catalyst for formic acid dehydrogenation, as it showed higher catalytic activity than the commercial Ru/C catalyst.367


3.5.5. Platinum-metalated COF catalysts. 
Due to their high surface area and surface-area-to-volume ratio, ultrasmall-sized Pt nanoparticles are an efficient heterogeneous catalyst and have attracted particular interest. In 2017, Zhang et al. prepared Pt nanoparticles with a size of 1.7 nm within the Thio-COF pores using a wet chemical method.312 The presence of thioether groups inside the ordered COF pores plays a central role in the size-controlled growth of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles. The Pt@Thio-COF showed excellent catalytic activity in nitrophenol reduction, and could completely convert 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol within 8 min. Notably, Pt@Thio-COF was very stable and could be readily recovered by natural sedimentation and it showed almost constant performance over six catalytic cycles. Later on, the Pt-metalated COF catalyst PtNPs@Phos-COF-1, which possessed similar catalytic activity for reduction of 4-nitrophenol, was also reported by Zhang et al.271
Also, COF-supported Pt(0) can catalyse reductive amination with hydrogen and ammonia to prepare symmetrical secondary amines.354 The Pt/COF catalyst was prepared by Ma et al. via loading Pt nanoparticles (approximately 2 nm) into a COF generated from 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)benzene and 4,4′-oxydianiline. As shown in Fig. 50, Pt/COF specifically converted benzaldehyde to dibenzylamine in 96% yield under the given reaction conditions, which is largely superior to the performance of commercial Pt/C. In addition, the commercial Pt/C, Rh/C, and Ru/C catalysts, however, led to additional products including imine, benzylamine and benzyl alcohol, while RANEY® Ni and Co catalysts resulted in the formation of benzylamine and a secondary amine under the same conditions. Without catalysts, the reaction mainly afforded N,N′-(phenylmethylene)bis(1-phenylmethanimine) as the product. These results suggest that the selectivity of metal catalysts for secondary amines depends not only on the properties of the active metals but also on the nature of the COF-carriers, which balance the competition between hydrogenation and amination via fine-tuning the surface chemical environment of the metal catalysts.

3.5.6. Gold-metalated COF catalysts. 
COF-supported gold catalysts and their applications are summarized in Fig. 51, which includes two categories, Au(I) and Au(0).
 Fig. 51  COF-Confined gold catalysts and their applications. 
In 2020, Dong and co-workers reported a COF-supported Au(I)-catalyst.277 The NHC–Au-loaded NHC–AuX-COF (X = Cl−, SbF6−) catalysts can be a highly active reusable catalyst to separately promote the phenylacetylene carboxylation with CO2 and phenylacetylene hydration under mild conditions. In addition, no obvious substituent effect was observed for both carboxylation and hydration reactions, which was evidenced by the generality for the phenylacetylenes with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. Compared with NHC–AuCl-COF with a water contact angle of 123 ± 2°, NHC–AuSbF6-COF is much more hydrophilic (water contact angle was 0°), and thus it is more suitable for catalysing organic reactions in aqueous phase under the applied reaction conditions.
Incorporation of metallocatalysis and organocatalysis into a single platform has attracted extensive research interest for developing undiscovered and valuable organic reactions. In 2022, Dong group reported the COF-catalyst that was concomitant with NHC–Au and chiral amine, viz. (S)-2-methylpiperazine.677 The obtained chiral (S)-NHC–Au-SA-COF is a dual functional catalyst for heterogeneous asymmetric benzyl alcohol oxidation–aldol relay reaction. For example, with the aid of (S)-NHC–Au-SA-COF, 4-(hydroxymethyl)benzonitrile was quantitatively oxidized to 4-formylbenzonitrile under ambient conditions (toluene, air, room temperature). After direct supplementation of acetone and acetic acid, the reaction eventually led to the chiral product (R)-4-(1-hydroxy-3-oxobutyl)benzonitrile. The total yield of the tandem reaction was 89% with 95% ee.
In addition to Au(I), COF-supported Au(0) as nanoparticles for catalysis also appeared in recent literature. For example, with the help of TpPa-1 COF-supported Au(0), p-nitrophenol was completely converted to p-aminophenol in 13 min with NaBH4, which is superior to the performance of HAuCl4 in a homogeneous system.133 The catalytic activity of Au(0) strongly depends on the ratio of atoms on the surface of gold nanoparticles. Au@TpPa-1_HL with a gold particle size of 5 ± 3 nm exhibited a higher catalytic activity than Au@TpPa-1_LL with a gold particle size of 11 ± 4 nm, although the latter had 1.8 times gold loading than the former. Follow-up studies further demonstrated the application of COF-supported Au(0) in organic transformations as heterogeneous catalysts.314,344,345


3.5.7. Silver-metalated COF catalysts. 
Similar to Au(0), nanoscale Ag(0) was also applied in nitrophenol reduction. In 2021, Pan and co-workers fabricated a flow-through reactor by encapsulation of AgNP@SCOF in polyvinyl chloride tubes.320 The reduction reaction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in an aqueous solution of NaBH4 proceeded quantitatively at a reaction solution flow rate of 2000 L (m2 h)−1, and the reduction efficiency decreased to 84% when the flow rate was increased to 4000 L (m2 h)−1.
In addition to reduction reactions, COF-supported Ag(0) nanoparticles can activate unsaturated bonds, promoting the carboxylative cyclization reaction with CO2. As shown by Islam et al., the Ag@TpPa-1-catalysed reaction of prop-2-en-1-amine with CO2 generated 5-(iodomethyl)oxazolidin-2-one in 89% yield under solvent-free conditions at room temperature, in which Ag(0) induced CC activation to form the highly reactive iodonium that was considered a key intermediate for cyclic carbamate formation.678 Furthermore, in a solvent-free system with Ag@TpPa-1 as a catalyst, the carboxylative cyclization reaction of propargylic amines with CO2 resulted in 2-oxazolidinone derivatives in 36–89% yields.678 In 2022, the Bai group examined the catalytic activity of Ag@2,6-FPP-TAPT for the same reaction, and it was found that Ag@2,6-FPP-TAPT exhibited high activity and afforded cyclic carbamates in yields higher than 90% under the given conditions.349 As suggested by the authors, the combined effects of ultra-small Ag(0) nanoparticles, unimpeded mass transfer, and resultful activation of substrates enhanced the activity of Ag@2,6-FPP-TAPT.


3.5.8. Copper-metalated COF catalysts. 
Copper is a promising alternative to precious metals for catalysts due to its low price, diverse catalytic activity, and broad tolerance for functional groups.679,680 Because the copper ion can readily coordinate with N and O heteroatoms, the copper ion-loaded COFs are one of the most common metalated COF catalysts. In addition, Cu(0) can also be loaded in porous COFs as metal nanoparticles for heterogeneous catalysis.
Cu(II)-Loaded COFs can be obtained by a solid-state coordination approach. For example, Dong et al. reported that the reaction of β-ketoacylhydrazone-linked COF-DM with CuCl2 in acetonitrile can afford the Cu(II)-loaded Cu(II)@COF-DM,308 which is a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the alkyne–dihalomethane–amine (AHA) coupling reactions. In the presence of Cu(II)@COF-DM and DBU, the reaction of phenylacetylene, dichloromethane and diethylamine in acetonitrile at 80 °C afforded N,N-diethyl-3-phenylprop-2-yn-1-amine in 99% yield (Fig. 52A). As a heterogeneous catalyst, the Cu(II)@COF-DM can be easily recovered by centrifugation, and the yield was still higher than 90% after five catalytic cycles. ICP–OES analysis showed that there was only a tiny amount of Cu(II) loss (approximately 0.7 wt%) after multiple catalytic cycles. In contrast, the Cu(II)-loaded amorphous Cu(II)@polymer-DM provided 92% yield in the first catalytic cycle, but the yield sharply decreased to 16% in its second catalytic cycle.

(D) Copper azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction. (E) Styrene oxidation. (F) Cycloaddition of epichlorohydrin and CO2. (G) Homocoupling reaction of arylboronic acids. (H) Asymmetric Henry reaction. 
By a similar solid-state coordination approach, the Cu(II)-loaded CCOF-based catalyst can also be synthesized. Very recently, the same group disclosed that CCOFs can be prepared by a catalytic asymmetric polymerization approach.44,681 With the aid of the chiral 2-methylpyrrolidine catalyst, a series of tris(N-salicylideneamine)-derived β-ketoenamine-linked CCOFs were directly synthesized from prochiral aldehyde and primary amine monomers in high yields under ambient conditions.682 The obtained (Λ)- and (Δ)-TpPa-1 with the β-ketoenamine coordination moiety were further metalated by copper(II) trifluoromethanesulfonate in hot ethanol to give the corresponding Cu(II)-metalated CCOFs. Due to the co-existence of Cu(II) and the chiral framework, the generated Cu(II)@(Λ)-TpPa-1 and Cu(II)@(Δ)-TpPa-1 can highly promote asymmetric A3-coupling reactions at room temperature (Fig. 53B). Benefiting from the strong chelating coordination mode between β-ketoenamine and Cu(II), the obtained Cu(II)@(Λ)-TpPa-1 is robust and was reused at least 10 times without loss of its catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. Of special note, a Cu(II)@(Λ)-TpPa-1@chitosan aerogel was also fabricated as a highly efficient fixed-bed model reactor for scaled-up asymmetric A3-coupling reaction.
 Fig. 53  Cu(0)- and Cu(I)-loaded COFs for CO2 fixation. Reaction conditions: (i) CuOx@COF-BD(OH)2, DMF, 25 °C, 10 h; (ii) Cu(0)@TFP-TTA-COF, DBU, acetonitrile, 50 °C, 12 h; (iii) Cu(0)@TFP-TTA-COF, borane dimethylamine complex, ethanol, water, 100 °C, 12 h. 
In 2018, Zhang and co-workers reported a Cu(II)-loaded Cu(CH3COO)2@PI-COF, which is a highly active heterogeneous catalyst that can effectively promote the Chan–Lam coupling reaction of phenylboronic acids with primary amines in air without any base or additive (Fig. 52C).683 In addition, the catalyst can be readily recovered from the reaction system by filtration and reused for at least 8 cycles without any observable change in structure and catalytic activity. The reaction is compatible with a wide range of substrates, and 54 diphenylamine derivatives with different substituents are obtained in 73–92% yields. However, aniline derivatives containing strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as 4-nitroaniline, cannot be converted to the target products. In addition, aliphatic amines, including butan-1-amine, prop-2-en-1-amine, cyclohexanamine, 2-phenylethan-1-amine, and furan-2-ylmethanamine, can be converted to the corresponding secondary amines in 83–90% yields.
Later on, the COF-supported Cu(II)-catalyst was also reported by Wang et al. The obtained Cu(CH3COO)2@TpBpy COF was also employed to catalyse the Chan–Lam coupling reaction but between phenylboronic acid and imidazole (Fig. 52C).231 The reaction was conducted in methanol with triethylamine as the base for 12 h at 70 °C to afford 1-phenyl-1H-imidazole in 66% yield. Examination of the substrate scope led to acceptable reaction yields for 3- and 4-substituted phenylboronic acids, but it was barely able to promote the coupling reaction between 2-substituted phenylboronic acids and imidazole. It is assumed that the 2-substitution increased the steric hindrance, which did not allow the substrates to readily access the catalytically active sites located within the COF pores.
As an example of click chemistry, copper-catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition has the advantages of mild conditions and high reaction yields. The catalysts for this reaction are usually Cu(I) or a mixture of Cu(II) and a reductant. In 2020, Gao et al. demonstrated that the click reaction of terminal alkynes with azides can be achieved by a Cu(II)-functionalized COF with sodium ascorbate as the reducing agent.293 For the reaction of phenylacetylene with benzyl azide at 60 °C, the yields in methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, and water are all above 80%, and the reaction proceeds almost quantitatively in a mixed solvent system of methanol and water. However, the reducing agent used in this reaction cannot be recovered, which increases the cost of the reaction. Thus, supported Cu(II) catalysts without reductants are highly desired.684
In 2021, Zamora and co-workers reported a Cu(II)-decorated β-ketoenamine-linked TAPB-TFP COF by a pre-synthetic metalation method, which was propitious to form the binding amine defects.685 The obtained Cu-TAPB-TFP showed high reactivity in catalysing the reaction of azides with alkynes in the absence of a reducing agent. For example, the reaction of hex-3-yne with (azidomethyl)benzene by Cu-TAPB-TFP afforded 1-benzyl-4,5-diethyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole in 98% yield (Fig. 52D). Importantly, the reaction of asymmetric 4-bromobut-1-yne with (azidomethyl)benzene provided the 1,4-isomer of 1-benzyl-4-(2-bromoethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole in 97% yield with 100% regioselectivity, which may be related to the template effect of the COF-pores. This Cu-TAPB-TFP catalyst is stable, and no significant decrease in selectivity nor catalytic activity was observed after five catalytic cycles.
The copper-catalysed olefin oxidation reaction may yield a variety of possible products, such as alcohols, carbonyl compounds, and epoxides. In this context, the selective olefin oxidation is a common topic in current research. In 2017, Chen et al. took advantage of COFs with regular pore channels to embed Cu(II) into imine-linked TAPT-DHTA-COF to form Cu-COFHX by post-synthetic metalation with copper acetate.686 The Cu(II)-loaded Cu-COFHX exhibited good catalytic performance and recyclability towards selective oxidation of styrene to benzaldehyde. As shown in Fig. 52E, in the presence of Cu-COFHX, the styrene oxidation afforded benzaldehyde and styrene oxide with 76% conversion at a molar ratio of 38:7. However, for (E)-1,2-diphenylethene and hex-1-ene, the epoxides were the main products. Furthermore, (Z)-cyclooctene mainly underwent α-H oxidation to yield (Z)-cyclooct-2-en-1-one. This selective oxidation reaction is closely related to the substrate size and the Cu(II) location in the COF-framework.
Other types of catalytic reactions by COF-supported Cu(II) have also been reported. For example, Ma et al. reported that Cu(II)-doped COF-TpBpy containing a polymeric phosphonium salt in the pores can convert a variety of oxirane derivatives, such as 2-(chloromethyl)oxirane, 2-ethyloxirane, 2-((allyloxy)methyl)oxirane, and 2-(phenoxymethyl)oxirane, to the corresponding cyclic carbonates in 1 atm of CO2 with greater than 90% yields (Fig. 52F).232 In addition, the CuO nanoparticle-loaded TRIPTA COF for coupling of phenylboronic acids to biphenyls was also reported by Bhaumik and co-workers (Fig. 52G).370 Also, the Cu(II)-grafted (Δ)-TpTab-Cu CCOF catalyst, which was prepared by a combined approach of chiral induction and post-synthetic metalation, for asymmetric Henry reactions was reported by Cui et al. in 2018 (Fig. 52H).304 In the presence of (Δ)-TpTab-Cu and N-ethyl-N-isopropylpropan-2-amine, the reaction between nitromethane and 4-bromobenzaldehyde in mesitylene at −10 °C for 48 h afforded the corresponding β-nitroalcohol with 10% conversion of aldehyde and 35% ee.
In addition to the organic conversions catalysed by Cu(II)-COFs, the catalytic properties of low-valent copper (Cu(I) and Cu(0)) have also been reported. In 2021, Gao and co-workers reported a Cu(I)-decorated TpBpy COF, which is demonstrated to be a good platform for CO2 adsorption and transformation.236 For example, the TpBpy-Cu-catalysed ethynylbenzene carboxylation with CO2 afforded 3-phenylpropiolic acid in 95% yield. The same year, Li and co-workers reported that the Cu(I)-based JNM-1 COF can efficiently catalyse the Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions of phenylacetylene with aryl iodides in DMF.263 Specifically, no obvious substituent effect was observed in this reaction, and the aryl iodides with either electron-withdrawing or electron-donating functional groups are executable with the product yields ranging from 90 to 97%. Moreover, IISERP-COF9-supported Cu/Cu2O nanoparticles for Glaser–Hay coupling between two terminal alkynes to asymmetric dienes were reported by Vaidhyanathan et al.360 The oxidation of Cu(0)/Cu(I) to Cu(II)/Cu(III) was observed in the reaction, and the formed copper(III) diacetylide complex was considered the key intermediate.
In 2020, Islama et al. reported a low-valent Cu/CuxOy nanoparticle-loaded COF for CO2 transformation via carboxylative cyclization. As shown in Fig. 53, the synthesized Cu@COF-BD(OH)2 could catalyse the three-component one-pot reaction of (Z)-2-bromo-3-phenylacrylic acid, aniline, and CO2 in DMF to afford (Z)-5-benzylidene-3-phenyloxazolidine-2,4-dione in 96% yield at room temperature.324 In addition, TFP-TTA-COF-supported copper nanoparticles for carboxylative cyclization of N-benzylprop-2-yn-1-amine and cyclization of benzene-1,2-diamine with CO2 were reported by the same group in the same year.358 Both examples of catalysts were reusable at least six times, emphasizing the role of COFs in stabilizing copper-based nanoparticles.


3.5.9. Iron-metalated COF catalysts. 
Similar to copper-based complexes, iron-based complexes are also a class of cheap and readily available catalysts,687 and they have been widely used to catalyse the cross-coupling reactions, asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, CO2 chemical transformation, etc.688 To date, several impressive examples that highlight the application of Fe-metalated COFs in organic transformations have appeared in the literature.
In 2017, Cui et al. first applied the Fe-metalated COF catalyst for asymmetric epoxidation of olefins.297 In the presence of Fe(II)-loaded CCOF4-Fe as the catalyst with iodosylbenzene as the oxidant, 2,2-dimethyl-2H-chromene and spiro[chromene-2,1′-cyclohexane] were successfully oxidized to (1aS,7bS)-2,2-dimethyl-1a,7b-dihydro-2H-oxireno[2,3-c]chromene (76% conversion and 90% ee) and 1a′,7b′-dihydrospiro[cyclohexane-1,2′-oxireno[2,3-c]chromene] (84% conversion with 94% ee) in chloroform at −20 °C. However, with NaClO as the oxidant, only a trace amount of the desired products was obtained.
In 2018, Buarque et al. reported an iron-based COF catalyst, FeCl3@TPB-DMTP-COF, which could effectively facilitate decarboxylative reactions of cinnamic acids.689 Using di-tert-butyl peroxide as the oxidant, the reaction of cinnamic acid with dioxane at 120 °C for 6 h yielded (E)-2-styryl-1,4-dioxane in 86% yield. The reaction was compatible with methoxy, hydroxyl, and methyl groups in 28–79% yields. Interestingly, only (E)-isomers were obtained, whether (Z)- or (E)-cinnamic acid derivatives were used, because of the free radical mechanism.
One year later, Fang et al. reported a β-ketoenamine-linked COF which can trap Fe(II) into the COF-framework via the chelating coordination.690 The generated JUC-521-Fe served as the Fenton catalyst to degrade rhodamine 6G with a degradation rate of up to 95% in 90 min.
In 2020, Tang et al. reported a Fe(III)-embedded COF by defective engineering of COF-LZU1, and the obtained LZU-OFe exhibited excellent catalytic activity in epoxide alcoholysis.270 As shown, 2-phenyloxirane could be quantitatively converted to 2-methoxy-2-phenylethan-1-ol with the aid of LZU-OFe at room temperature. As a heterogeneous catalyst, LZU-OFe was reused three times without obvious performance loss.


3.5.10. Cobalt-metalated COF catalysts. 
Since the discovery of hydroformylation reactions, cobalt has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for a variety of organic reactions, including cycloadditions, borohydride reductions, and hydrosilylations.691 It has been demonstrated that introducing electron-rich units, e.g., porphyrin, cyclopentadienyl, and salen, into COF-scaffolds can be attractive for COFs to immobilize cobalt ions. To date, the reported oxidation states of cobalt in Co-metalated COFs are 0, +2, and +3. Co(-I) and Co(I) have not been incorporated into COFs, although their related organometallic complexes have been reported for homogeneous catalysis.692
Co(II), as a Lewis acid, can effectively activate epoxides and promote their ring-opening addition with CO2. For example, Gao et al. reported a Co-metalated TF-TACo-COF by the reaction of cobalt(II) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin and 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(pyrene-1,3,6,8-tetrayl)tetrabenzaldehyde in a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylacetamide, 1,4-dioxane, and mesitylene at 140 °C for 3 days.693 The cobalt porphyrin units in TF-TACo-COF are alternately stacked along the crystallographic c-axis with a layer spacing of 3.8 Å, and the two adjacent layers in the ab-plane have a slip of 1.7 Å. Compared with the classical AA and AB stacking, this unique stacking form fully exposes the Co(II) catalytic sites, ensuring the smooth progress of CO2 cycloaddition with 2-(chloromethyl)oxirane. With the aid of tetrabutylammonium iodide, the reaction yield at 313 K is over 90% even with CO2 pressure as low as 0.1 MPa. Large substrates, such as 2-phenyloxirane, 2-hexyloxirane, and 2-(butoxymethyl)oxirane, are difficult to contact the Co(II) sites in the COF-matrix, resulting in low reaction yields. Similarly, Co-BD-COF reported by Chen et al. containing a (η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)(η5-cyclopentadienyl)cobalt(II) sandwich complex also exhibited high activity in catalytic CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides to produce cyclic carbonates.694
In addition to direct polymerization, the Co(II) ions can also be loaded by COFs via the post-synthetic metalation. In 2017, Wu et al. reported a Co(II)-loaded porphyrin-COF by heating the 3D imine-linked CPF-2 with CoCl2 in DMF. The generated Co-CPF-2 COF under ambient conditions exhibits efficient heterogeneous catalytic activity in the aerobic epoxidation of olefins.695 In oxygen-rich acetonitrile, a variety of olefins (e.g., styrene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, (Z)-cyclooctene, and hex-1-ene) were effectively oxidized to the corresponding epoxides in the presence of isobutyraldehyde. The yield was negatively correlated with the molecular size of the substrate, indicating an intrapore catalytic process. Mechanistic studies suggest that the (CH3)2CHCO˙ radical formed by the reaction of isobutyraldehyde and Co(II) is a key intermediate for the activation of molecular oxygen.
Similarly, Co-metalation can also be achieved on salen-based COFs. In 2017, Hoskins et al. reported a Co/salen-COF that was prepared by Co(II)-metalation of an established salen-COF via a post-synthetic approach.295 The obtained Co/salen-COF can catalyse the Henry reaction in a heterogeneous way. In addition to the Co(II)-metalated COF, the Co(III)-metalated COF has also been realized by Yang and co-workers in 2019, and the obtained COF-salen-Co(III) was applied in epoxide hydration successfully.296
The Co-involved nanoparticles can also be loaded into porous COFs. In 2018, Vaidhyanathan and co-workers demonstrated that the nitrogen-rich COFs can support and stabilize Co/Co(OH)2 nanoparticles.361 The cobalt nanoparticle-loaded Co@IISERP-COF5 can catalyse the reaction of NaBH4 with methanol under basic conditions to produce hydrogen, which can be in situ utilized for the hydrogenation of nitrile and nitro compounds to amines under mild conditions in a facile one-pot reaction. In contrast, the free Co/Co(OH)2 nanoparticles were less active, implying that the nitrogen-rich binding pockets in IISERP-COF5 ensure strong interactions between the Co/Co(OH)2 nanoparticles and the COF-carrier, which provides high catalytic activity and enables catalyst recycling.


3.5.11. Nickel-metalated COF catalysts. 
Due to its low-cost and relatively large earth abundance, nickel(II) is an ideal alternative to palladium for Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction. In 2020, Esteves et al. tested the potential of NiCl@RIO-12 as a heterogeneous catalyst in the cross-coupling reaction of 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one and phenylboronic acid in toluene with the aid of K3PO4.291 In a microwave reactor (180 °C, 2.45 GHz), a 34% conversion to 1-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)ethan-1-one was obtained after 15 min. Although the reaction efficacy is far from that of the Pd-based counterpart, this work is still a valuable exploration of Ni-metalated COFs for catalytic research.
In addition, the Ni(0)-loaded dehydrobenzoannulene-based COF, which has a nickel content of 8.56 wt%, was reported in 2020 by McGrier and co-workers.283 The Ni-metalation therein was achieved by combining an azine-linked 2D COF with bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) in toluene at room temperature. The obtained Ni-DBA-2D-COF is a de facto nickel single-atom catalyst that can highly catalyze the desulfurization of aryl thioethers which was evidenced by the reaction of methyl(naphthalen-2-yl)sulfane to naphthalene (ethyldimethylsilane, toluene, 130 °C, 87% yield). Of note, Ni-DBA-2D-COF exhibited recoverability over five catalytic cycles with negligible leakage of Ni and almost constant catalytic activity. The mechanistic study showed that upon heating, Ni(0) broke two coordination bonds, underwent oxidative addition to insert into the C–S bond, followed by σ-bond metathesis with ethyldimethylsilane, and finally reductive elimination to obtain the product and complete catalyst regeneration.
Later, Ma et al. reported an additional Ni(0)-loaded COF catalyst by roasting the nickel acetate-embedded TpDb COF in a H2/Ar atmosphere at 350 °C.357 The obtained H350-Ni/COF enables selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene with greater than 99% conversion and up to 85% selectivity for styrene. Both the conversion rate and the selectivity are superior to those of the TiO2-supported Ni, C3N4-supported Ni, and commercial Raney Ni catalysts. This H350-Ni/COF-catalyzed semihydrogenation reaction was demonstrated to be also suitable for other substituted phenylacetylenes.
Therefore, Ni-metalated COFs are a promising class of non-precious metallic catalysts for application in demanding organic transformations for fine chemical products because the cheap abundant metal-based reusable catalysts are highly significant for a sustainable society.


3.5.12. Zinc-metalated COF catalysts. 
As an additional cheap abundant metal, Zn is also selected as a handy metal source to conduct COF metalation. In 2022, Islam et al. grafted Zn(II) on a N-rich COF to obtain a Zn-metalated COF.696 The obtained Zn@TpTta exhibits good catalytic activity in the fixation of CO2 under sustainable conditions. The corresponding cyclic carbonates were generated in 69–99% yields in 1 atm CO2 under solvent-free conditions. Moreover, Zn@TpTta is also highly active in facilitating atmospheric cyclizative CO2 capture, which led to the formation of diverse iodo-substituted cyclic carbamates in 61–94% yields from unsaturated amines using N-iodosuccinimide as an electrophilic reagent under optimized conditions.


3.5.13. Manganese-metalated COF catalysts. 
Mn–salen molecular complexes are effective catalysts for olefin epoxidation. However, the formation of μ-oxo-Mn dimers is a potential deactivation pathway for the Mn–salen catalysts. The immobilization of Mn–salen complexes in the porous COF supports has been demonstrated to be a facile and effective way to prevent the dimer formation. In 2019, the Yang group developed a post-synthetic protocol for the preparation of COF-salen–Mn, and moreover, successfully realized its catalytic application in styrene epoxidation (t-butyl hydroperoxide, acetonitrile, 40 °C, 24 h, 74% conversion).296 In contrast, the homogeneous Mn–salen catalyst afforded much slower reaction rate than COF-salen–Mn, and only approximately 58% conversion of styrene was achieved under the same reaction conditions.


3.5.14. Vanadium-metalated COF catalysts. 
Different from the most metalated COFs, the introduction of vanadium into COFs is usually in the form of vanadium oxide cations. For example, in 2019, Ma et al. utilized an imine-linked COF containing a catecholate moiety to trap VO2+ ions by a single step reaction of TAPT-2,3-DHTA with bis(2,4-pentanedionato)vanadium(IV) oxide.267 The obtained oxovanadium-functionalized VO-TAPT-2,3-DHTA has the ability to catalyse a series of organic transformations, including the Prins reaction,267tert-butyl hydroperoxide-assisted sulphide oxidation,267 and Mannich-type reaction268 (Fig. 54).
 Fig. 54  Oxovanadium(IV)-catalyzed Prins carbonyl–ene reaction, oxidation reaction of thioethers, and modified Mannich-type reaction. 


3.5.15. Molybdenum-metalated COF catalysts. 
By a similar post-synthetic protocol, Jiang et al. prepared a β-ketoacylhydrazone-linked COF containing a bis(acetylacetonato)dioxomolybdenum(VI) moiety.309 The molybdenum-doped Mo-COF with a Mo content of 2.0 mmol g−1 can be an open nanochannel-reactor for the selective epoxidation reaction of olefins. With the aid of tert-butyl hydroperoxide, Mo-COF promoted the cyclohexene epoxidation to 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with a conversion rate above 99% and a selectivity of 77%, and (Z)-cyclooctene epoxidation to 9-oxabicyclo[6.1.0]nonane with a conversion rate of 80% and a selectivity higher than 99%. For the alkene substrates with long alkyl chains such as oct-1-ene and dodec-1-ene, the catalytic reactions provided below 20% conversion but with selectivity above 99%, suggesting that the Mo-COF-catalysed epoxidation is an inner pore catalytic process.


3.5.16. Heterometallic COF catalysts. 
Because COFs have multiple possible coordination sites, it is logically feasible to load two or more types of metals into specific positions within the COF-scaffolds. Such heterometallic COF catalysts provide an opportunity for tandem reactions. In 2022, Gao and co-workers reported a Py-2,2′-BPyPh COF which contains two possible coordination sites of 2,2′-bipyridine and imine bonds.244 After sequentially doping Mn(II) and Pd(II) in the Py-2,2′-BPyPh COF, a heterobimetallic Mn/Pd@Py-2,2′-BPyPh COF was obtained, and it can promote a Heck–epoxidation tandem reaction, in which the loaded Pd(II) and Mn(II) are responsible for Heck addition and epoxidation reaction, respectively. Thereafter, the same group reported additional heterobimetallic Pd(II)/Cu(II)@TADP-COF which can catalyse a coupling–oxidation cascade reaction in water.697
Furthermore, chloro(1,5-cyclooctadiene)rhodium(I) and palladium acetate were incorporated into a 75%-BPy-COF via a two-step reaction and used to catalyze the reaction of phenylboronic acid and benzaldehyde to obtain benzophenone without the need to separate the diphenylmethanol intermediate.698
By integrating two metal nanoparticles of Pd and Au into Phos-COF-1, tandem Suzuki–Miyaura coupling and nitro reduction reactions have been achieved using a one-pot method, leading to [1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine from phenylboronic acid and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.271 The oxidation state of Au increased from 0 to +3, and the oxidation state of P decreased, raising doubts about the reusability of the catalyst.

3.6. Sensing and analysis
The colossal specific surface area of COFs makes them easy to interact with the external environment, which has been exploited to develop sensing materials.699 Based on pore engineering of COFs,700 the pore walls can be precisely designed to selectively interact with target analytes, thus allowing the design of various types of chemical detection systems based on the principles of colorimetry,701,702 chemiluminescence,336,703 photoluminescence,704–706 chemoelectrical transduction,707 chromatography,708,709 and others to achieve highly sensitive and selective detection.
In addition to being used for the detection of metal ions, the metalated COFs offer several advantages for the detection of other types of analytes. For example, iron-metalated COFs can trigger Fenton reaction for decomposing H2O2 to yield ˙OH that can be combined with a variety of chromogenic and luminescent substrates (e.g., 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, o-diaminobenzene, 9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-amine, and luminol) to achieve colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection. Obviously, the non-enzymatic detection system based on iron-metalated COFs possesses better stability than the conventional horseradish peroxidase-based detection system. In addition, COFs loaded with rare earth ions have rich photochemistry with potential applications in fluorescence sensing. Also, COF-supported noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Pt, Au, and Ag) can be used for electrochemical sensing with enhanced electrical conductivity. COFs, as crystalline porous carriers, not only provide channels for the directional and rapid diffusion of analytes but also protect the metal nanoparticles from aggregation and accidental oxidative deactivation.
This section will comprehensively summarize the sensing applications of metalated COFs.

3.6.1. Colorimetry. 
Ferrous-metalated COFs have been developed for the colorimetric detection of H2O2 and glucose. On the basis of the porphyrin–Fe(II) coordination, Dai et al. reported an Fe(II)-decorated COF-366-Fe in 2018 (Fig. 55).710 In a sodium acetate buffer solution of pH = 5.0, the authors demonstrated that COF-366-Fe could promote H2O2 decomposition via Fenton-like reaction to produce ˙OH, which in turn caused 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine to change from colorless to blue. Kinetic analysis showed that the Michaelis–Menten constant Km of COF-366-Fe was lower than that of natural horseradish peroxidase, implying that the affinity of COF-366-Fe for 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and H2O2 was stronger than that of natural peroxidase. During the assay, Fe(II) did not leak out, confirming its good chemical stability. Based on this colorimetric reaction, COF-366-Fe was used to detect H2O2 in solution at a detection limit of 1.1 μM. Furthermore, since glucose and oxygen can be catalysed by glucose oxidase to produce gluconic acid accompanied by H2O2 production, COF-366-Fe was used in combination with glucose oxidase to specifically detect glucose at a detection limit of 1.0 μM. Other common carbohydrates, such as sucrose, maltose, and lactose, did not interfere with glucose determination. For human serum samples, the results obtained by the above colorimetric method based on COF-366-Fe were consistent with those of commercial blood glucose meters. Furthermore, through the coordination reaction of FeSO4 with imine bonds, Fe(II) was embedded in RT-COF-1 for the detection of H2O2 at a detection limit of 5.6 μM and a linear range of 10–2000 μM.711 Fe-RT-COF-1 was used to detect H2O2 in dairy products with a recovery of 96.3–100.7%.

Recently, noble metal nanoparticles have been reported as iron-free Fenton-like reaction catalysts for colorimetric analysis. In 2019, Yan et al. developed gold nanoparticle-loaded PTAzo-COF-AuNP for the colorimetric analysis of Hg(II).337 In the presence of Hg(II), PTAzo-COF-AuNP catalysed the reaction of H2O2 with the chromogenic substrate of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, resulting in an enhanced absorption at 652 nm. In buffer solution at pH = 4, PTAzo-COF-AuNP achieved an ultrasensitive colorimetric analysis of Hg(II) with a detection limit of 0.75 nM and a linear range of 5–300 nM with excellent analytical robustness. Effectively, the colorimetric method is highly versatile, as it combines different chromogenic substrates. Very recently, Pt@Tz-Da@GOx that was decorated by Pt nanoparticles and glucose oxidase was prepared by Jiang and co-workers via a stepwise post-treatment of the Tz-Da COF.330 In a buffer solution at pH = 8, glucose oxidase converts glucose to gluconic acid and H2O2; Pt subsequently catalyzes the reaction of phenol with the chromogenic substrate 4-aminoantipyrine in the presence of H2O2, causing the solution to turn red. The absorbance at 505 nm is linearly related to the phenol concentration in the range of 12.5–300 μM. As a carrier, the Tz-Da COF protects the activity of ultrasmall platinum (2–3 nm) and glucose oxidase from external environmental damage.


3.6.2. Chemiluminescence sensing. 
Ferric- and ferrous-coordinated COFs can accelerate the oxidation of luminol by triggering H2O2 decomposition, resulting in pronounced chemiluminescence. As indicated by Li et al., in the carbonate buffer solution with pH = 11, the chemiluminescence caused by mixing luminol, H2O2 and COF-366-Fe is 27 times stronger than that of the COF-free system.703 In addition, the chemiluminescence intensity is linearly related to the H2O2 concentration in the range of 0.01–10.0 μM with a detection limit of 5.3 nM. Through the reaction of glucose and glucose oxidase to generate H2O2in situ, COF-366-Fe can also be used in the chemiluminescence assay of glucose, with a linear range of 0.05–8.0 μM and a detection limit of 4 nM.


3.6.3. Fluorescence sensing. 
Many COFs are weakly fluorescent or nonfluorescent due to π–π stacking between layers and rotation and vibration of covalent bonds within the layers.712–716 Several design strategies have been shown to improve their fluorescence quantum yield. For example, photoluminescent COFs can be synthesized by introducing large π-conjugated structures, such as pyrene,717–719 porphyrin,190,720–722 triazatruxene,723 and triphenylene,724 into monomers. In these COFs, the large π-conjugation enhances the probability of the π–π* transition; thus, this transition is easily excited and is accompanied by a redshift of the maximum absorption and emission wavelengths. In addition, the use of intralayer hydrogen bonds and steric effects to limit the free rotation of the linkages and the vibration of O–H and N–H bonds can reduce the energy dissipation caused by nonradiative transitions and improve the fluorescence intensity.725–728 Third, modulating the interlayer stacking interactions is also an effective way to optimize the fluorescence properties of 2D COFs: (i) the introduction of bulky substituents, such as tert-butyl,729 into the monomer increases the interlayer spacing and weakens the fluorescence quenching caused by interlayer interactions; (ii) AB stacking of 2D COFs can minimize the interlayer interactions while maintaining the crystalline structure, which is beneficial for fluorescence enhancement;730–733 (iii) exfoliating bulk 2D COFs into nanosheets or quantum dots can reduce the number of stacked layers, thereby enhancing fluorescence;734,735 and (iv) the introduction of twisted intralayer structures can weaken the interlayer stacking interactions of 2D COFs, accompanied by fluorescence enhancement.419,736,737 Furthermore, monomers with aggregation-induced emission properties, such as 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethene,723,738,739 are beneficial for the synthesis of 2D COFs with high fluorescence quantum yields. Furthermore, π–π stacking interactions in 3D COFs are usually weak or absent, and thus they are a promising class of candidates for the construction of fluorescent COFs.81,740 Finally, photoluminescence properties beyond single-photon fluorescence, such as two-photon fluorescence, have recently been disclosed in some COFs with a wide range of π-conjugated systems and strong intralayer charge transfer.741–745
In addition, metal ions can also affect the fluorescence properties of COFs through various mechanisms. For example, metal ions can cause fluorescence quenching of the metalated COFs through several mechanisms: (i) enhancing absorption competition,746–748 (ii) promoting photoinduced electron transfer,307,729,736,749 (iii) blocking intramolecular charge transfer,750 and (iv) interrupting the π-conjugated structure.751 On the other hand, metal-assisted fluorescence enhancement mechanisms usually include (i) blocking photoinduced electron transfer,752,753 (ii) limiting covalent bond rotation,754 and (iii) weakening interlayer stacking.755 Thus, metalation of COFs provides an effective means of modulating the fluorescence properties of COFs as needed for fluorescence sensing.
The metalated COF-based fluorescence visualization for intracellular H2S was reported very recently. In 2021, Du and co-workers reported a copper(II) porphyrin-based CuPor-COF for sensitive and selective detection of H2S.756 As indicated by the authors, H2S could react with Cu(II) and release the metal-free COF to turn on the fluorescence (Fig. 56A). Upon excitation with 419 nm light, the fluorescence increased at 700 nm, and the detection limit was as low as 10 nM (Fig. 56B). In addition, CuPor-COF has good selectivity and is almost free from the interference of common anions and biological thiols.

In 2021, Huang et al. found that Fe(III) can bind to the imine linkage of TPB-DMTP-COF through metal–linkage coordination, forming TPB-DMTP-COF-Fe(III) and quenching the fluorescence at 515 nm, while adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has the ability to bind Fe(III) through the Fe–O–P bond, leading to the removal of Fe(III) from TPB-DMTP-COF-Fe(III) accompanied with fluorescence recovery.748 Therefore, TPB-DMTP-COF-Fe(III) is a probe for ATP detection (Fig. 56C). Experimental results indicated that the fluorescence of TPB-DMTP-COF-Fe(III) was enhanced along with the increase in the amount of ATP in aqueous solution, and the detection limit was 2.4 nM (Fig. 56D). High levels of proteins, amino acids, and inorganic ions barely interfered with the detection. Based on the obtained fluorescence properties and good biocompatibility, TPB-DMTP-COF-Fe(III) has been further used for fluorescence imaging of intracellular ATP and track Ca(II)-induced intracellular ATP upregulation in real time (Fig. 56E).
Among the metalated COFs, lanthanide-immobilized COFs have received additional attention. The fluorescence emissions of lanthanide ions potentially cover a wide range from the ultraviolet to near-infrared regions due to their numerous energy levels originating from f–f transitions; they have unique photoluminescence features, such as sharp emission bands, large Stokes’ shifts, and long luminescence lifetimes, creating a vast library of fluorescent probe candidates.757,758 However, the fluorescence of hydrated lanthanide ions is usually weak due to weak light absorption. The antenna effect,759 which achieves energy absorption and transfer by means of ligands in the excited triplet state that have the same energy levels as lanthanide ions, effectively enhances fluorescence emission. This effect is essentially a form of intramolecular energy transfer from the organic ligands to the lanthanide ions, and it can be regulated by ligand exchanges, thereby inducing fluorescence enhancement or quenching and achieving sensitive fluorescence sensing. Based on this principle, lanthanide-metalated COFs have been developed as fluorescence sensors (Fig. 57).
 Fig. 57  Eu(III)- and Tb(III)-Metalated COFs as turn-on fluorescent sensors. *TAA, 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone. 
The Eu(III)-functionalized TpPa-1 COF was used to detect levofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, as reported by Yan et al.760 TpPa-1 cannot enhance the fluorescence emission of Eu(III) via the antenna effect, and Eu@TpPa-1 and TpPa-1 have similar photoluminescence properties because the triplet energy level of TpPa-1 (15504 cm−1) is lower than the 5D0 energy level of Eu(III) (17500 cm−1). The coordination of the β-diketone moiety in levofloxacin and Eu(III) affects the energy transfer, thus enabling the fluorescence detection of levofloxacin. In the presence of high concentrations of levofloxacin, the excited singlet state of levofloxacin is transformed into the excited triplet state via intersystem crossing, and the energy is then transferred from the lowest energy level of the excited triplet state to the excited energy level of Eu(III), effectively sensitizing the Eu(III) emission and leading to a significant enhancement of its 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 1, 2, 3, 4) emission at 592, 613, 652, and 701 nm. When there is a low concentration of levofloxacin, the sensitization of the Eu(III) emission is limited; however, the levofloxacin ligand occupies the site of the original water ligand on Eu(III), attenuating the nonradiative transition due to thermal vibrations and continuing to enhance the fluorescence. As a result, the levofloxacin induces an enhancement of Eu@TpPa-1 fluorescence in a concentration-dependent manner at a detection limit of 0.2 μM and within a linear range from 1 μM to 10 mM. The fluorescence sensing property of Eu@TpPa-1 is robust and has been applied in the detection of levofloxacin in serum and urine. In addition, based on the same detection mechanism, the Eu(III)-modified TyBpy COF was also reported by Liu and co-workers for fluorescence detection of levofloxacin with a detection limit of 0.51 μM and a linear range of 2–800 μM.761
The introduction of carboxyl groups on the pore walls of COFs can increase the coordination sites of lanthanide ions and further improve the detection sensitivity. This year, Song et al. prepared a DTA-TFP COF containing carboxyl groups using 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde and 2,5-diaminoterephthalic acid.762 After loading Eu(III) through the coordination bond, the Eu@DTA-TFP exhibited weak fluorescence due to energy level mismatch. Pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, an organic ligand with multiple coordinating atoms, can enhance the fluorescence of Eu(III) at 592, 615, and 693 nm through the antenna effect but has almost no effect on the fluorescence of the DTA-TFP COF at 457 nm. Therefore, using the fluorescence emission at 457 nm as an internal reference and the enhanced emission at 615 nm, ratiometric fluorescence detection of pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid with a detection limit of 4.2 nM within a linear range of 0.01–12.0 μM has been achieved. Tb@DTA-TFP, which contains Tb(III) instead of Eu(III), can achieve the ratiometric fluorescence detection of pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid at 544 nm with a detection limit of 2.9 nM within a linear range of 0.01–9.0 μM.
To construct turn-off fluorescent probes, Yan et al. prepared Eu-TAA@TpDq with bright red emission by introducing the additional β-diketone ligand 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TAA) into the Eu(III)-coordinated TpDq COF.763 Common aldehydes, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, benzaldehyde, and glutaraldehyde, quenched the fluorescence of Eu-TAA@TpDq to varying degrees. Among them, glutaraldehyde diminished the fluorescence intensity at 613 nm to 1/398 of the initial value, successfully realizing the fluorescence sensing of glutaraldehyde at a detection limit of 4.55 μM. Mechanistically, this fluorescence quenching was attributed to dynamic quenching; the collision of the excited Eu-TAA@TpDq with glutaraldehyde resulted in energy dissipation. Unfortunately, Eu-TAA@TpDq could not detect glutaraldehyde in water because the water quenched the Eu(III) fluorescence. Based on the same principle of TAA-enhanced Eu(III) photoluminescence, in 2022, a TpBD-(COOH)2@Eu-TTA COF hydrogel was used for the simultaneous detection of vanilacetic acid and Al(III), both of which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases.764 In aqueous solution, due to competitive energy absorption and dynamic quenching, vanilacetic acid led to fluorescence quenching at 614 nm, while Al(III) led to fluorescence quenching at 614 nm and enhancement at 412 nm. The detection limits for vanilacetic acid and Al(III) were 132 nM and 23.4 nM, respectively. However, the partial leaching of Eu(III) during the detection process limited the reusability of the TpBD-(COOH)2@Eu-TTA COF.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that temperature has a significant effect on the photoluminescence properties of lanthanide ions, enabling temperature sensing. By post-treatment of the TpBpy COF with rare earth acetylacetonate complexes under solvothermal conditions, Carlos and co-workers prepared TpBpy-Ln (Ln = Eu, Tb, Dy) with strong fluorescence emission.146 The acetylacetonate co-ligands in these metalated COFs not only prevent the fluorescence quenching caused by water molecules but also act as an antenna ligand to sensitize the fluorescence emission of rare earth elements. Variable-temperature fluorescence spectra showed that TpBpy-Eu/Tb, which is anchored with Eu(III) and Tb(III) ions, has temperature-dependent fluorescence emission. In the temperature range of 10–360 K, due to metal-to-ligand energy back-transfer, the lifetime of the Eu(III) 5D0 energy level decreases with increasing temperature, which leads to a negative correlation between the 610 nm emission intensity and temperature. However, because of the mismatch between the T1 energy level of TpBpy COF and the 5D4 energy level of Tb(III), there is no such thermally activated emission decay of Tb(III), and the 548 nm fluorescence emission intensity is almost independent of temperature. This gives TpBpy-Eu/Tb the potential to be a ratiometric fluorescence thermometer. In addition, the characteristic emission peaks of TpBpy-Dy, such as 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 transition, have temperature-dependent photoluminescence properties in the temperature range of 280–440 K. TpBpy-Dy is also a candidate for a fluorescence thermometer. In 2021, Kaczmarek et al. also reported the use of a TTA-DFP COF loaded with terbium(III) trifluoroacetylacetonate or europium(III) trifluoroacetylacetonate as a fluorescence thermometer.765 Eu(III) and Tb(III) were bound to the pyridin-2-ylmethanimino moiety. Within the range of 273–403 K, the emission intensities of Tb(III) at 544 nm and Eu(III) at 612 nm decreased with increasing temperature. However, the thermal quenching process of the 544 nm emission had a lower activation energy than that of the 612 nm emission, and thus, the decrease in the intensity of the 544 nm fluorescence peak was more pronounced, allowing the Eu(III)- and Tb(III)-combined TTA-DFP COF to be used as a ratiometric fluorescence thermometer.
Despite numerous advances in this type of sensing, metalated COF fluorescent probes still face several limitations that prevent them from replacing existing chromatographic methods, including selectivity, reusability, and sample preparation. First, the stability of metalated COF dispersions is a major challenge for the detection. In the detection medium, the aggregation of metalated COF particles leads to fluorescence decay, which directly interferes with the analyte-induced fluorescence enhancement or quenching and compromises the long-term stability of the detection system. A feasible solution is to prepare nanoscale metalated COFs, such as quantum dots, nanosheets, and nanospheres.179 In addition, fluorescent probes constructed based on energy transfer processes rather than demetalation reactions face a significant limitation of lack of specificity. It is not easy to distinguish between two structurally similar compounds, especially when structural analogs coexist. Although some potential interferents have been explored in existing research, the structural analogs have not been fully screened and their mechanisms have not been adequately studied. Furthermore, the detection media of metalated COF fluorescent probes are usually organic solvents, and the excitation wavelengths are below 400 nm, both limiting in vivo and in vitro fluorescence detection.766


3.6.4. Electroanalysis. 
Electroanalysis sensors perform qualitative and quantitative determinations of substances by converting chemical quantities (e.g., concentration) into electrical quantities (e.g., current, potential, and resistance of charge transfer), which are usually based on functionalized modified electrodes and the corresponding redox reactions.767 The classical materials applied in electrochemical sensing are 2D materials represented by graphene, metal oxides, and MXenes, which have the advantages of fully exposed active sites, anisotropic carrier migration, and abundant surface chemistry.768 Recently, 2D COFs have shown potential in electrochemical analysis because they do not have many of the limitations of previous 2D materials, which are difficult to modify due to their lack of modifiable dangling bonds. The variable-valence metal ions in metalated COFs provide potential redox sites that allow controlled adjustment of sensing performance over a wide range by adjusting the metal type and content.
In 2021, Yu et al. reported COF-366-Fe grown on graphene aerogel which was used as an electrochemical gas sensor for NO detection.769 The glassy carbon electrode coated with COF-366-Fe/GA had a high effective area due to the porous structure of COF-366-Fe, which facilitated the donation of electrons from COF-366-Fe to form [COF-366-Fe(III)]+, thus promoting the chemisorption of NO on the electrode, culminating in the formation of NO3−via electrochemical oxidation. The electrons released during this process formed an electric current with the assistance of graphene aerogel, the intensity of which was positively correlated with NO concentration. In phosphate buffer (0.01 M, pH = 7.4), the linear range of the sensor was 0.14–400 μM with a detection limit of 30 nM. COF-366-Fe/GA successfully detected the release of NO from HUVEC cells induced by different concentrations of arginine.
Ultrasmall nanoparticles that are used as electrode surface modifiers can significantly enhance and amplify the electrochemical signal due to their high conductivity and large specific surface area, but they are limited by easy agglomeration. Recent works have demonstrated that the in situ growth of nanoparticles in COF matrices can prevent the aggregation of the nanoparticles and is an effective method of enhancing electrochemical detection. In 2022, the composite TFPB-BD-COF/PtNPs/NH2-MWCNT was obtained by Wang and co-workers via integrating Pt nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes on a TFPB-BD-COF matrix, and it enabled the simultaneous detection of three benzenediol isomers.353 Pt nanoparticle electrocatalysts catalysed the electrooxidation of the analytes, TFPB-BD-COF protected the Pt nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes played a role in enhancing the electrical conductivity. In phosphate buffer solution, the TFPB-BD-COF/PtNPs/NH2-MWCNT was coated on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode and the benzenediols were oxidized to benzoquinones, resulting in the effective separation of the redox peaks of the three analytes. The response current of the differential pulse voltammetry scans was linearly related to the concentration of the analytes over wide concentration ranges, with detection limits of 15, 260, and 22 nM for 1,2-benzenediol, 1,3-benzenediol, and 1,4-benzenediol, respectively. In addition, the abundant nitrogen in squaraine-linked TS-COF provided binding sites for the immobilization of gold nanoparticles in the pores to build a composite AuNPs@TS-COF material.342 After the introduction of reduced graphene oxide, AuNPs@TS-COF/RGO could simultaneously detect uric acid, dopamine, and ascorbic acid via a two-electron/two-proton process in urine samples with high sensitivity and high reliability. Similarly, based on the above electrocatalytic oxidation principle, chlorogenic acid340 and bisphenol A770 could be quantified by COF-supported gold and palladium nanoparticles, respectively.
Based on Au-doped COFs, sophisticated electrochemical immunosensors can be designed to achieve ultrasensitive analysis of proteins. Gold nanoparticles not only increase the conductivity of the electrode but also provide binding sites to facilitate the adsorption of antibodies onto the electrode sheet so that antibody–antigen interactions can occur on the electrode surface. A sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was fabricated for the detection of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) using the gold nanoparticle-modified TAB-PTA COF as the electrochemical sensing platform and the porous NiCo2S4@CeO2 core–shell material as the signal amplifier.338 Under optimal conditions, the obtained immunosensor showed a good linear current signal response in the KIM-1 concentration range of 0.01–50 pg mL−1 with a low detection limit of 2.0 fg mL−1, maintaining stable detection results for 7 weeks. Furthermore, when horseradish peroxidase was incorporated as a signal amplifier, Au-modified DMTP-TAPB-COF was used to construct an enzymatic electroimmunosensor for cardiac troponin I.771 The response current of this sensor was linearly related to the logarithmic concentration of cardiac troponin I with a wide sensitivity range from 5 pg mL−1 to 10 ng mL−1 and a low detection limit of 1.7 pg mL−1. Glucose oxidase, hemoglobin, horseradish peroxidase, immunoglobulin G and cardiac troponin T did not interfere with the sensor, which could detect cardiac troponin I specifically in serum samples.
An electrochemical aptamer sensor based on metalated COFs was reported by Yuan et al.339 Single-stranded DNA was immobilized on an Fe3O4@COF-Au-coated glassy carbon electrode via Au–N bonds. Due to the interaction between the ATP aptamer and ATP, the chain of nucleic acids that was complementarily paired with the aptamer was dissociated, which in turn triggered the layered-branched hybridization chain reaction. The redox substrate (viz. 4-nitrophenol) was prevented from approaching the electrode, and electron transfer was confined, thus increasing the resistance of the device. In this way, the ATP concentration was linked to measurable electrochemical signals, achieving an extremely low detection limit of 1.6 pM and a wide linear range of 5–5 × 107 pM.
Electrochemiluminescence is a specific chemiluminescence phenomenon caused by electrochemical reactions on the electrode surface that combines the controllability of electrochemical methods and the sensitivity of chemiluminescence methods and has the advantages of low background, high sensitivity, and strong specificity.772,773 The Qiu group reported some COFs with electrochemiluminescence properties774,775 and their application in UO22+ detection.776,777
Briefly, electrochemical sensing has the advantages of sensitive response, simple operation, and low cost, but metal-free COFs have not been widely used in electrochemical sensing due to their poor electrical conductivity. By contrast, metal nanoparticle-loaded COFs to some extent cover the shortage of low conductivity and have been developed for electrochemical sensing, but there is still room for improvement in reproducibility and stability.


3.6.5. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering. 
The Raman scattering intensity of molecules adsorbed on the surface of precious metals such as Au and Ag is enhanced by several orders of magnitude, and this phenomenon is called surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).778 Throughout the nearly 50-year development of this technique, substrates for SERS have usually been irregularly shaped colloidal nanoparticles, including nanostars, nanorods, nanocubes, and heterojunctions of noble metals.779 However, these colloidal nanoparticles have potential aggregation problems, which can usually be circumvented by embedding the particles in porous materials such as COFs. In fact, COFs not only serve as carriers for metal substrates to prevent undesired aggregation and deactivation but also provide a channel for molecular diffusion to effectively enrich the SERS reporter molecules and analytes, achieving the rapid, noninvasive, and specific detection of trace analytes.
In 2022, Chen et al. found that Ag-decorated TPB-DVA-COF can enrich benzoic acid on the surface.780 Due to the SERS effect, the Raman signal of the surface-adsorbed benzoic acid at 1003 cm−1 was greatly enhanced over that of unadsorbed benzoic acid, thereby improving the sensitivity of SERS detection. After optimization of the measuring conditions, the SERS signal intensity was linearly related to the benzoic acid concentration in the range of 0.05–1 μg mL−1, and the detection limit was 3.72 ng mL−1. Furthermore, gold nanostar-modified DMTP-TAPB-COF was shown to adsorb 4-nitrobenzenethiol through Au–S bonds and catalyze its reduction to 4-aminobenzenethiol by NaBH4, enhancing the Raman signals at 1591 cm−1 and reducing those at 1573 cm−1 in the SERS assay, leading to a ratiometric SERS signal.341 When monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are combined with β-lactoglobulin, Au@DMTP-TAPB-COF can replace natural enzymes in classical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, achieving ratiometric ultrasensitive detection of β-lactoglobulin with an ultralow detection limit of 0.01 ng mL−1 within a linear range from 26 ng mL−1 to 62 μg mL−1.


3.6.6. Other advanced analytical methods. 
In addition to the above mentioned detection methods, metal-based nanoparticles supported by COFs also have potential applications in other detection techniques.
As reported by Jiang et al. in 2020, COF-LZU1 embedded with Ag nanoparticles can catalyse the reaction of CuSO4 with glucose to form Cu2O, which has a strong resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) signal at 370 nm.346 The strong adsorption of aptamers on the Ag@COF-LZU1 surface leads to the inhibition of its catalytic activity. The target molecule corresponding to the aptamer can form a complex with the aptamer, which leads to the release of the aptamer from the Ag@COF-LZU1 surface and restoration of the catalytic activity. Thus, the RRS signal intensity at 370 nm was correlated with the concentration of the target molecule with the help of the specific binding reaction between the aptamer and the target molecule on the Ag@COF-LZU1 surface. Through the use of different aptamer sequences, Ag@COF-LZU1 was successfully used for the RRS detection of urea, melamine, and bisphenol A.
Furthermore, metalated COFs have also been used to establish methods of analysing trace metal ions. In 2022, Wang et al. developed a MoS2-embedded TpPa-1 COF heterojunction for the accurate analysis of trace Ni(II) via photochemical vapor generation–microplasma optical emission spectrometry, with a detection limit of 0.03 μg L−1 and a linear range of 0.1–10 μg L−1.781 Cai et al. developed a quartz crystal microbalance sensor by growing the 2,2′-bipyridine-based Bpda-Bth COF on the surface of gold-coated quartz crystal chips, which achieved detection of trace Hg(II) at a detection limit of 58 nM within a linear range of 5–50 μM.782

3.7. Biomedicine
With the joint efforts of researchers in chemistry, materials science, cell biology, and clinical medicine, the application of nanomaterials in tumor therapeutics,783–785 antibacterial therapy,786,787 and tissue engineering788 has made great progress over the past three decades.

3.7.1. Oncotherapy. 
Nanomaterials have unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that provide new perspectives for the diagnosis, tracking, and treatment of tumors.789 For example, quantum dots are ultrasmall nanoparticles with semiconducting properties whose fluorescence emission can be adjusted by changing their size, shape, and chemical composition; they are used for tumor imaging in vivo.790–792 Mesoporous silica is widely studied as a carrier for chemotherapeutic drugs, and due to its passive targeting nature, the loaded drugs can achieve targeted sustained release in the tumor region, minimizing side effects.793,794 Hafnium-based materials with strong X-ray absorption are used as radiosensitizers to enhance the radiotherapeutic efficacy of tumors.795–797 Gold nanorods, copper sulfide, and MXenes can effectively convert light into heat energy when irradiated by near-infrared light, thus achieving tumor ablation through photothermal therapy (PTT).651–653,798 Fe3O4 nanoparticles effectively decompose H2O2 into highly toxic ˙OH in the tumor microenvironment and cause tumor cell death via apoptosis and ferroptosis; this method is known as chemodynamic therapy (CDT).799,800 Organic nanomaterials based on porphyrins, cyanines, and phthalocyanines can be excited by near-infrared light and ultrasonic waves and transfer the energy to oxygen to generate 1O2, which has extremely strong oxidative properties, inducing photodynamic therapy (PDT)801 and sonodynamic therapy (SDT).802,803 In addition, with nanoparticles as excipients, multiple therapeutic modalities can also be integrated into the same nanoplatform for combined therapy, which has the advantages of synergistic therapeutic mechanisms, reduced drug doses and enhanced treatment effects.804
COFs are latecomers, since they joined the nanooncology candidate library in the 2010s, but they have shown some advantages.117,714,805,806 COFs are highly diverse in terms of structure, particle size, charge, hydrophilicity, surface chemistry and other physicochemical properties,807 and thus, their biological interactions are not only manifold but also controllable, with great scope for customization.808 As nanoplatforms, COFs easily integrate multiple diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to achieve nanotheranostics.179 To date, COFs have been validated in the laboratory stage for drug delivery,809–818 phototherapy,819–825 immunotherapy,151,741,826–828 and combination therapy applications.817,829–832 In particular, the antitumor application of metalated COFs has been a promising research topic in COF-based nanomedicine. The types and contents of metal elements in metalated COFs can be adjusted as needed, which is advantageous for minimizing the potential long-term toxicity of metal elements.
In 2019, Pang et al. reported a Fe(III)-metalated Fe-TpPa-COF by simply mixing FeCl3 with TpPa-COF under ambient conditions.833 The resulting Fe-TpPa-COF showed no significant cytotoxicity even at concentrations up to 600 μg mL−1, implying negligible Fenton-like catalytic activity of Fe(III). Notably, Fe-TpPa-COF has a photothermal effect with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 13.9%. In cultured HeLa cells, 1.2 mg mL−1 of Fe-TpPa-COF resulted in a reduction in cell viability to approximately 30% under 808 nm laser irradiation at 1.8 W cm−2 for 5 min.
Iron-metalated COFs have also been used in CDT. An Fe(II)-metalated COF(Fe) was prepared by porphyrin-based TphDha-COF with FeCl2 in DMF, which was reported by Tang et al. in 2021 (Fig. 58A).834 Due to the porosity, the COF(Fe) was loaded with doxorubicin (DOX)—a clinical chemotherapeutic drug—to afford DOX@COF(Fe) with a DOX loading of 61.5 wt%. The highly dispersed Fe(II) sites in the COF matrix catalysed the Fenton-like reaction to convert H2O2 to ˙OH, inducing CDT. Furthermore, the generated ˙OH disrupted the efflux transporter p-glycoprotein on nuclear membranes and inhibited the efflux of DOX, thereby promoting nuclear accumulation and enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect of DOX. This result has been confirmed in vitro and in vivo with a DOX-resistant MCF-7 cell line and the corresponding xenograft model.

The same year, the Dong group reported that the ferrocene-modified Tf-TAPB COF (namely COF-Fc) can induce CDT in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma, HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma, and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 58B).149 After loading RSL3 in COF-Fc to inhibit glutathione peroxidase 4, RSL3@COF-Fc disrupted the intracellular antioxidant mechanism and led to an increase in intracellular lipid peroxide and subsequent ferroptosis.
In addition to being used for CDT, the Fenton-like reactivity of iron-metalated COFs can also be combined with chemiluminescent substrates to realize PDT excited by internal light sources, which greatly ameliorate the situation of insufficient penetration of external light sources into tumor tissue. Recently, Dong et al. synthesized a Fe(II)-metalated Fe-DhaTph COF for loading luminol, realizing in situ chemiluminescence-excited PDT.835 In H2O2-rich 4T1 solid tumors, Fe(II) catalyses the oxidation of luminol by H2O2 to produce blue chemiluminescence, thereby exciting porphyrins to generate 1O2 for PDT. By avoiding the use of clumsy external light sources, self-luminous excitation of PDT fundamentally circumvents the dilemma faced by phototherapy of deep tumors. This study demonstrated that Fe(II)-metalated COFs have potential in phototherapy of deep tumors.
Metalated COFs derived from copper porphyrins and copper phthalocyanines have been recently used as phototherapy agents. In 2021, Dong and co-workers reported a Cu-DhaTph COF based on copper(II) porphyrin; it has poor photodynamic properties due to the spin-forbidden d–d transition of Cu(II).836 Interestingly, the Cu-DhaTph COF can be triggered by endogenous H2S via an intracellular sulfidation reaction to generate a metal-free DhaTph COF as the photosensitizer for PDT against H2S-rich colon tumors with controllable singlet oxygen release; meanwhile in situ generated CuS can be synchronously used as a photothermal agent for PTT. This intracellular H2S-dependent demetalation resulted in combined PDT and PTT under 660 and 808 nm laser irradiation, which significantly inhibited colon cancer in vitro and in vivo.
Moreover, in 2021, a copper phthalocyanine-based CPF-Cu COF was synthesized by Zang and co-workers using 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene as the monomer.222 Additional 3,6-dihydroxyphthalonitrile was added as a regulator to limit the extended growth within the layer and confine CPF-Cu to the nanoscale, and the hydroxyl group at the edge of the nanoparticles made CPF-Cu hydrophilic, both of which are beneficial for antitumor applications. The fused conjugated phthalocyanine framework restricts the rotation of intramolecular chemical bonds, which partially blocks the nonradiative transitions. Therefore, the CPF-Cu COF has green fluorescence emission at 520 nm with a fluorescence quantum yield of 10.3% in water upon excitation at 390 nm, which can be used for cell fluorescence imaging. Furthermore, the residual nonradiative energy decay can enable CPF-Cu to promote photothermal conversion. The photothermal conversion efficiency was 39.3% upon 660 nm laser irradiation when the CPF-Cu concentration was 100 μg mL−1. As expected, at low concentrations, CPF-Cu significantly inhibited the proliferation of SMMC7721 hepatoma cells when irradiated by a 660 nm laser. Mechanistic studies suggested that CPF-Cu-induced PTT downregulated the anti-apoptotic protein Blc-2, thereby inducing cell apoptosis.
Recently, Sun et al. reported the terpyridine–copper(II)-decorated COF-909-Cu by a direct coordination reaction of COF-909 with CuCl2 in methanol. COF-909-Cu has multiple functions in cells.151 First, COF-909-Cu promotes the cascade reaction of ˙O2− → H2O2 → ˙OH, which induces CDT. Second, COF-909-Cu oxidizes glutathione to oxidized glutathione and relieves the spontaneous cellular scavenging of reactive oxygen species. Finally, COF-909-Cu possesses photothermal conversion properties, and the induced temperature increase not only promotes the Fenton-like reaction and glutathione oxidation but also induces PTT. COF-909-Cu leads to caspase 3 activation, gasdermin E cleavage to generate N-terminal domains, and cell membrane perforation in 4T1 tumor cells; these phenomena are characteristic of pyroptosis. As expected, COF-909-Cu combined with an 808 nm laser almost completely cured 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, cell disruption was also accompanied by danger-associated molecular pattern release, which triggered antitumor immunity. COF-909-Cu combined with α-PD-1 immunotherapy induced long-lasting abscopal effects, thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis and recurrence.
Moreover, Ag(I)-metalated BpyTp-COF rapidly captured 125I within 30 s to obtain 125I-COF with 94% radiolabeling yield.233 In PC-3 tumor-bearing mice, the radiation intensity of 125I-COF at the tumor site was 3.2 times higher than that of 125I at 30 min after injection. At 24 h after injection, high radioactivity was still present at the tumor site injected with 125I-COF, while the radioactivity was no longer detectable in the tumor site injected with 125I. The retention time of 125I-COF in the tumor was much longer than that of 125I due to the interaction of the COFs with the tumor tissue, which facilitated radionuclide-based internal radiation therapy. Intratumoral injection of 125I-COF into PC-3 tumor-bearing mice at 4-day intervals resulted in significant tumor ablation, whereas there was no difference between 125I-injected and untreated mice.
In addition to the abovementioned metalated COFs formed by the coordination of metal ions with COFs, metal nanoparticle-embedded COFs are also applied in tumor therapy. Embedding photothermal nanoagents into COFs can prevent nanoparticle aggregation and improve the PTT effects. Two therapeutic nanomaterials obtained by Pang et al. via growing CuSe142 and Ag2Se378 within COF-LZU1 exhibited photothermal conversion efficiencies of 26.3 and 37.9%, respectively, upon 808 nm laser irradiation, which effectively induced tumor cell apoptosis and solid tumor ablation via PTT.
Due to the versatility of metalated COFs, multiple therapeutic agents can be integrated to realize multimodal combination therapy. According to the report of Dong et al., bifunctional CuS@COF-BDP nanomaterials were obtained by introducing ultrasmall CuS into TPB-DMTP-COF using copper acetate and thioacetamide as starting materials, followed by covalent modification of the amino groups on the TPB-DMTP-COF surface with a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) photosensitizer.837 Upon 520 nm laser irradiation, CuS@COF-BDP induces 1O2 generation for PDT. Upon 1064 nm laser irradiation, CuS@COF-BDP leads to an increase in the temperature of the illuminated region for PTT because of its near-infrared light absorption and photothermal conversion ability. PDT and PTT synergistically cause significant lethality against MCF-7 breast cancer in vitro and in vivo.
Gold nanomaterials are considered as promising multifunctional therapeutic agents due to their photothermal properties and catalytic activity.838 Gold nanomaterial-loaded COFs are potential multimodal therapeutic platforms that are easy to further functionalize. As reported by the Tang group in 2021, CApHD nanosheets were obtained by in situ growth of gold nanoparticles on a photosensitive porphyrin-COF, followed by loading with DOX and covalent modification with a pH-responsive insertion peptide.839 As expected, CApHD induced the upregulation of reactive oxygen species and local overheating upon 635 nm laser irradiation, which disrupted cell membrane integrity and promoted DOX release and entry into tumor cells, ultimately enabling cell membrane-targeted synergetic PDT, PTT and chemotherapy. In addition, in 2021, Lin et al. prepared a COF-Au-MnO2-HA composite with catalytic cascade reaction activity by growing gold nanoparticles and MnO2 sequentially on TPB-DMTP-COF for T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and combination therapy of hypoxic tumors.326 The authors demonstrated that the gold nanoparticles catalyze the glucose oxidation to generate gluconic acid and H2O2 and MnO2 subsequently decomposes the generated H2O2 into O2 for enhancing PDT.
In addition to CuS and Au, other types of nanomaterials embedded in COFs have also been reported. Recently, CaCO3-loaded COFs have been used for calcium overload-induced tumor therapy.375,840 As reported by Dong et al.,375 using the reaction of CaCl2 and NH4HCO3, CaCO3@COF-BODIPY-2I was prepared by the in situ formation of ultrasmall CaCO3 in TPB-DMTP-COF modified with a diiodo-substituted BODIPY photosensitizer (Fig. 59).375 Surface modification with glycosaminoglycan further improve the targeting ability of the nanomaterial to tumor cells with high CD44 expression. The obtained CaCO3@COF-BODIPY-2I@GAG induced 1O2 production under green LED light, leading to damage to mitochondria as intracellular calcium buffer pools. In the absence of the calcium buffering capacity of mitochondria, an irreversible defect in ion homeostasis is induced by elevated Ca(II) concentrations due to CaCO3 decomposition in acidic lysosomes, thereby leading to cell death. In the HCT-116 xenograft model, a single injection of CaCO3@COF-BODIPY-2I@GAG and subsequent light exposure almost eradicated the tumor, which showed no obvious signs of recurrence within 12 days. This study shows for the first time the use of metalated COFs in ion interference therapy and highlights the disruptive effect of PDT on cellular homeostasis.

Moreover, the band gap change caused by the composition of TiO2 with COFs may be beneficial for the generation of reactive oxygen species. In 2021, Pang et al. reported that a TiO2-loaded COF nanoagent, which was used for SDT, could be prepared by depositing anatase-phase TiO2 on the DMTP-TAPB-COF surface.363 The energy band gap of COF-TiO2 decreased from 3.15 eV to 2.42 eV compared to pure TiO2. The narrow band gap was beneficial for improving the electron–hole separation efficiency and enhancing 1O2 generation under sonication. To enhance biocompatibility, COF-TiO2 was further modified with hyaluronic acid. In cultured 4T1 cancer cells, the resulting COF-TiO2-HA induced the upregulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and led to cell death in a concentration-dependent manner under sonication with a frequency of 1.0 MHz and a power density of 1.5 W cm−2. In an in vivo model of 4T1 tumors, COF-TiO2-HA induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth. This is the first report of sonosensitized COFs, and it has greatly inspired the study of COF-based SDT. Finally, COF coatings of COF-TiO2-HA can improve pharmacokinetics, increase tumor accumulation, and optimize therapeutic efficacy in tumor-bearing mice.
Overall, research on the oncotherapeutic applications of metalated COFs is still at a very early stage and many persistent challenges and limitations must be considered. First, due to the size limitations of mammalian cells for uptake of therapeutic nanomaterials, which is generally considered to be an upper limit of 200 nm, the morphological controls during the preparation of metalated COFs cannot be neglected. The dispersibility and colloidal stability of metalated COFs in aqueous solutions are one of the major bottlenecks limiting their biologically relevant applications, especially oncotherapy applications. Second, although the current study implies that the acute toxicity of metalated COFs in rodents is negligible, the metabolic process and long-term toxicity of metalated COFs in vivo have not been studied. Third, in theory, metal coordination can change the interaction between the guest and the framework, thereby regulating the uptake and release of the guest, but the significance of such precise regulation in metalated COF-mediated drug delivery has not been given much attention.


3.7.2. Antimicrobials. 
Infections caused by bacteria represent an important clinical challenge. Compared to tumor cells, bacteria have additional protective membranes (e.g., outer membrane, capsular polysaccharide layer, and cytoderm)841 and tend to form biofilms to escape the effects of antimicrobial agents and host immune responses.842 The overuse and misuse of conventional antibiotics lead to the development of bacteria toward drug-resistant or even multidrug-resistant bacteria, which is a global public health crisis of growing proportions.843 Due to these intrinsic and extrinsic difficulties, the development of bionanomaterial-based antimicrobial therapeutics is an alternative to conventional antibiotics that is gaining attention.787,844 COF-based antimicrobials are highly customizable biomaterials. COFs with intrinsic antibacterial activity can be easily designed and synthesized by introducing antibacterial moieties, including guanidine,845,846 propidium iodide,847 and benzooxazine.848 Additionally, due to their porosity, COFs can be loaded with high levels of antibiotics to provide slow and sustained antibiotic release.849–851 Furthermore, photosensitive COFs induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (including 1O2, ˙O2−, ˙OH, etc.) under light, causing the oxidation of bacterial membrane structures and killing bacteria.852–857 Additionally, COFs can be composited with other antimicrobial nanomaterials, such as Fe-based MOFs,858 MXenes,859 and nanosilver,860 to enhance the adhesion of the biomaterials on the bacterial surface and improve the antimicrobial activity.
Fe-metalated COFs can induce bacterial death by virtue of the chemodynamic activity of Fe(II). In 2021, Xiang et al. reported an antibacterial GFeF material that was synthesized by loading glucose oxidase on iron-metalated Fe-iCOF (Fig. 60).150 The loaded glucose oxidase converted glucose to gluconic acid and H2O2, and then the H2O2 decomposed to ˙OH under the catalysis of Fe-iCOF. The activity of Fe-iCOF was significantly increased in the acidic environment due to gluconic acid. Eventually, the vast accumulation of ˙OH leads to membrane perforation and death of E. coli and S. aureus. Interestingly, the addition of GFeF to a mixture of β-glycerophosphate and chitosan allowed the synthesis of thermosensitive GFeF hydrogels, which inhibited S. aureus infection, promoted vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration when used as wound dressings, thereby accelerating wound healing.

Nanosilver is a traditional broad-spectrum antimicrobial metal material. In 2022, Dong et al. obtained Ag@DhaTph-COOH by loading silver nanoparticles in a porphyrin-based DhaTph-COOH COF (Fig. 61).319 Ag@DhaTph-COOH has photothermal and photodynamic properties that can be combined with nanosilver to enhance the antimicrobial effect. The inactivation efficiency of Ag@DhaTph-COOH exceeded 95% for bacteria (including E. coli and S. aureus) and viruses (including influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and vesicular stomatitis virus) under a laboratory xenon lamp and even real sunlight. In addition, hydroxyl-rich Ag@DhaTph-COOH was cross-linked with isocyanate-terminated polyurethane oligomers, and after it was sprayed onto the surface of nonwoven polyester fabric, a bioprotective mask with a self-sterilized surface was obtained. Bacteria and viruses attached to the mask were inactivated within 60 min under sunlight exposure. The contaminated mask was regenerated by washing with water and ethanol, with no apparent performance loss after 5 repeated uses.

4. Summary and outlook
Although COFs have the advantages of customizability, high stability, and colourful reaction chemistry and have a wide range of applications, they have some inherent limitations in their properties and applications as pure organic materials.128 The morphology control and processability of COFs are difficult due to the low density, large internal space, and interlayer molecular interactions that are much weaker than covalent bonds. For example, the synthesized COF-based membrane is loose and fragile and has poor reusability.861 Furthermore, the synthesis of nanoscale COF particles necessitates an inefficient exfoliation strategy.119,806 In addition, the poor hydrophilicity of COFs increases the mass transfer resistance in aqueous systems, which is limited in sensing, catalysis, and biomedical applications. More critically, the function of COFs is confined to the limited properties caused by the monomers and their stacking, disregarding more than 4/5 of the metal elements in the periodic table. In contrast, the application-oriented porous materials used in gas adsorption and separation,862,863 catalysis,520,864,865 electrochemistry,866 and biomedicine867,868 heavily rely on the properties endowed by metals rather than the organic moieties. In this context, metalated COFs offer an opportunity to balance the structural advantages and functional limitations of COFs, with impeccable porosity, crystallinity, stability, functionality, and tunability. After more than 10 years of development, metalated COFs stand at the intersection of inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry. They are organic–inorganic hybrid materials, much like MOFs, which have been widely developed and have numerous application prospects. However, the development of metalated COFs is still in the stage of raw material collection and faces some systemic challenges.
The coordination chemical environment of the metal unquestionably influences the material properties in metalated COFs. Several issues should be considered when synthesizing metalated COFs. Are there multiple metal ion binding sites in the framework? What is their contribution to the immobilized metal ions? Do metals form clusters through metal–metal and metal–heteroatom bonds? In addition to the framework, what are the other molecules that form coordination bonds with metals? What additional role dos the ubiquitous defects in COFs play in binding metal ions? The answers to these questions will deepen the understanding of the structure–property relationships and may enable function-oriented material design. Furthermore, it is important to note that current characterization techniques are incapable of unambiguously determining the chemical purity, stacking pattern, crystal domain size, defect density, and many other structural features of COFs.86,869–872 Each of these features with uncertainties may impact the interaction of metal ions with COFs, which further complicates the structure–property relationships of metalated COFs.
Theoretical calculations are powerful tools for studying the structure and properties of materials; for example, first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations have been applied in the study of the binding sites of light metals in COFs,402 optimization of the unit cell structure of COFs,852 prediction of gas adsorption behaviors,412,873,874 and design and screening of electrocatalysts.532,875,876 However, due to computational bottlenecks, theoretical simulations are usually performed on fragments of COFs, leading to one-sided conclusions. Moreover, even such degraded theoretical calculations are rarely used to optimize the metalation synthesis conditions, catalyst screening, prediction of electronic properties, and material–biointerface interaction studies, although they are logically feasible and very important.
Artificial intelligence is changing research paradigms in various disciplines, including chemistry and materials science, with the ability to predict and discover unknown information by learning from existing datasets.877 Artificial intelligence bypasses the concrete understanding of structure–property relationships, providing a black-box tool for discovering new structures, new properties, and new applications.878–881 Because the COF structure is highly predictable, a database of COF structures has been established based on combinations of known and predicted building blocks. It contains more than 470000 hypothetical materials.99 In addition, a database of real structures based on published data was also initially established.882 These provide training sets for high-throughput screening and machine learning. Adding the metal dimensionality to these established datasets enables the construction of datasets for the study of metalated COFs. There are, however, two main challenges. First, as mentioned above, the binding sites of metal ions in metalated COFs have not been completely identified, which reduces the accuracy of the dataset and thus increases the training and predictive difficulties of machine learning. Second, the COF structure report lacks a unified standard, and the establishment of the dataset has to rely on manual extraction of structural information from the literature and manual proofreading.873,874,882 We strongly recommend that the community unifies the structure reporting standard of COFs and provides machine-readable standardized format files, which can greatly promote the application of data science in exploring the potential of COFs. We believe that it is only a matter of time before artificial intelligence reshapes the study of metalated COFs.
In conclusion, the library of metal ions and organic monomers with suitable coordination sites for the synthesis of metalated COFs is growing as the research proceeds. The field of metalated COFs will continue to be an active and challenging area of research. We hope that this review article will inspire follow-up studies on metalated COFs and even functionalized COFs.
