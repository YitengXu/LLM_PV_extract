    , Accepted 7th June 2023First published on 8th June 2023AbstractDue to their tunable wavelength, high color purity, bright emission and low-cost fabrication process, perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) have attracted broad interest and exhibited great prospects in application areas such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and lasers. Although the fabrication of PeNCs and related optoelectronic devices has witnessed rapid development over the past several years, the poor stability of PeNCs in an external environment still remains a major drawback which severely limits the further improvement and commercialization of PeNC-based devices. Therefore, various techniques and strategies have been developed to enhance the stability of PeNCs. Among them, the encapsulation strategy has been demonstrated to be an effective way to improve the stability of PeNCs. In this review, the origin of the instability of PeNCs is first analyzed to identify the importance of encapsulation, followed by a summary and discussions on recent advances in the encapsulation of PeNCs. The potential applications of encapsulated PeNCs in various optoelectronic devices are also presented to manifest the necessity of encapsulation. Finally, the further development and outlook on encapsulation of PeNCs are analyzed in order to suggest future improvements and commercialization of PeNCs and related optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Halide perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs), with the general formula of ABX3 (where A is methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+), formamidinium (FA, CH(NH2)2+) or Cs+, B is Pb2+or Sn2+, and X is Cl−, Br−,or I−), have been recognized for their excellent optical properties including tunable emissions, narrow emission line width, and long carrier diffusion length. These unique features make them promising candidates for applications in solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and photodetectors.1–8 With continuous efforts, optoelectronic devices based on PeNCs have witnessed rapid development in recent years. However, the issues of their inherent instability and fast degradation when exposed to oxygen or high humidity strongly limit the long-term operation of devices based on PeNCs. Although replacing MA+ or FA+ in organic–inorganic PeNCs with Cs+ can produce inorganic perovskites with enhanced stability, the ionic nature of all inorganic halide perovskites may also lead to decomposition or degradation when exposed to polar solvents.9–12 Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the stability of PeNCs for device applications.
It has been demonstrated that the degradation of PeNCs usually originates from the surface. So approaches that can improve the surface structure of PeNCs could be effective strategies to enhance the stability of PeNCs. In conventional semiconductor NCs, combining with polymers or an inorganic matrix is the main strategy to enhance the stability of NCs. In this strategy, the molecules of polymers or the inorganic matrix on the surface of NCs act as barriers that protect NCs from oxygen, moisture and light. On the other hand, the surface defects of NCs can also be well passivated by polymers or the inorganic matrix. Owing to the nature that NCs are wrapped in another material, the above-mentioned strategies are generally termed as encapsulation at the multiple-particle level. Different from being dispersed in polymers or inorganic matrix, NCs with a core–shell structure always refer to a single NC core existing in one core–shell particle and totally separated from other NCs. Based on this, the encapsulation can be classified into multiple-particle level and single-particle level encapsulation. Compared to encapsulation at the multiple-particle level, the encapsulation at the single-particle level or core–shell structure can not only act as a barrier and passivate the surface defects, but also tune the optical properties of NCs to a large degree.13,14 Inspired by the successful experiences in conventional NCs, the stability of PeNCs has also been enhanced through similar strategies. To date, the formation of composites by dispersing PeNCs in polymers or inorganic matrix has been widely investigated and used for applications in various optoelectronic devices. However, the fabrication of nearly perfect core–shell PeNCs is still in the initial stage when compared to the well-developed conventional core–shell NCs such as CdSe/ZnS, InP/ZnSe, and CuInS2/ZnS.15–17
In this review, based on our previous research and understanding of the fabrication and optical properties of PeNCs, the encapsulation of PeNCs will be reviewed.6,18–20 First, the origin of the instability of PeNCs is analyzed and mechanisms on degradation of PeNCs under light, heat and humidity are discussed. Then, recent advances in the encapsulation strategies for enhancing the stability of PeNCs are summarized and introduced in detail with classification into multiple-particle encapsulation and single-particle encapsulation. The main differences between the two encapsulation forms are discussed to reveal the advantages of single-particle encapsulation, especially the applications in EL devices. Besides, applications of encapsulated PeNCs in optoelectronic devices are also presented to emphasize the significance of encapsulation in improving the device performance. Moreover, future development and challenges for encapsulation of PeNCs are also prospected. With further research, high quality encapsulated PeNCs would be fabricated with the required optoelectronic properties, which will lead to the development of PeNC-based devices.
2. The origin of instability of lead halide perovskites
The stability issue of lead halide perovskites under different working conditions is a great challenge in device applications. The main causes of instability problems are the ionic nature of lead halide perovskites and low lattice energy, resulting in rapid crystallization rates and low formation energy of lead defects or halide vacancies. Second, due to the inherent dissolution equilibrium and the high dynamic binding of ligands, severe surface ligand dissociation occurs when halogenated PeNCs are exposed to polar solvents, resulting in the decomposition of lead halide PeNCs. In device applications, lead halide PeNCs are integrated into optoelectronic devices and inevitably decompose when exposed to light and heat from ambient environments. Therefore, improving its stability is a problem that must be solved ahead of commercialization, especially light and thermal stability.
2.1 Light stability
Degradation of lead halide perovskites under continuous light exposure is one of the most challenging problems. UV and blue light are both destructive to lead halide perovskites.21–24Fig. 1a outlines the comprehensive understanding of the degradation pathways of two organometallic mixed halide perovskite materials (MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbBr3−xClx) under white light and high vacuum conditions. It is clear that even under high vacuum conditions, the two perovskite films exhibit a noticeable color shift during continuous white light exposure. By in situ composition analysis and real-time film characterization, the decomposition of both hybrid halide perovskites begins at grain boundaries, leading to the formation of hydrocarbons and ammonia with the residue of PbI2(Cl), Pb, or PbClxBr2−x in the film. For all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs), illumination can cause the shedding of the capping agent, which leads to the collapse of the surface and eventually the appearance of the Pb0 surface defects. The Pb0 defects can act as a recombination center for the photogenerated carriers, resulting in decreased photoluminescence (PL) intensity (Fig. 1b). Due to the composition and structure diversity, perovskites with varied halide contents possess different crystal formation energies, which makes halide substitution another way to regulate the optical properties and stability of PeNCs.25,26 Zhu et al. investigated CH3NH3Pb(I1−yXy)3 (X = Cl, Br, y = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) components using first principles.27 The absorption edge of CH3NH3Pb(I1−yXy)3 was obviously blue shifted with the increase of X content, accompanied by the improvement of stability. However, compared to the significance in wavelength tuning, halide substitution only plays a limited role in stability enhancement because of the unchanged ionic nature. Fig. 1c and d show the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the original CsPbBr3 NCs and CsPbBr3 NCs under 450 nm LED illumination for 2 h. It can be seen that the original CsPbBr3 NCs are highly monodispersed nanocubes with an average size of 5 nm. After being irradiated for 2 hours, severe aggregation can be observed with larger crystals in the size range of 26 to 50 nm. From Fig. 1e, it can be observed that the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 under 365 nm UV lamp irradiation shows faster attenuation at elevated temperatures. Therefore, the improvement in light stability is essential for maintaining the PL intensity of PeNCs.

2.2 Thermal stability
For the thermal stability of perovskite materials, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies have shown that MAPbBr3 decomposes at around 493 K.28 Among lead halide perovskites with A site cations of Cs+, MA+, or FA+, all-inorganic perovskites (CsPbX3) are more thermally stable than their organic–inorganic counterparts (MAPbX3 and FAPbX3) because of the absence of volatile organic components. Kong et al. illustrated how the MAPbX3 perovskite crystal degraded under heat. Both of the following two decomposition pathways were possible.29 CH3NH3PbX3(s) → PbX2(s) + CH3NH2(g) + HX(g)(1) CH3NH3PbX3(s) → PbX2(s) + CH3X(g) + NH3(g)(2)It has been emphasized that pathway (i) (eqn (1)) was the predominant one, while pathway (ii) (eqn (2)) occurred to a much smaller extent due to its significant kinetic hindrance. In order to develop more effective protection strategies for perovskites under thermal stress, further investigations are required for in-depth understanding of the decomposition mechanism of these compounds. Fig. 2a shows that the thermal stability of CsPbBr3 NCs is improved with the decomposition temperature increased to around 853 K by replacing organic cation MA+ with Cs+.30 Although the decomposition temperature was increased, the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 NCs also greatly declined under high temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2b, CsPbBr3 NCs show obvious decreased PL intensity at a temperature higher than 310 K and are almost nonluminous at 400 K. When returned back to room temperature, only less than 20% percent of the initial PL intensity can be recovered. This demonstrates that the PL intensity decreasing at high temperature is an irreversible process. The morphology evolution of CsPbBr3 NCs during annealing was revealed through TEM characterization (Fig. 2c).31 After annealing at 400 K for 20 min, the average size of CsPbBr3 NCs obviously increased and better crystallinity was observed through sharper XRD patterns. This indicates that the growth of CsPbBr3 NCs is not only due to the aggregation of small grains, but also due to the recrystallization of CsPbBr3 crystals. The aggregation of CsPbBr3 crystals implies the absence of surface ligands, which results in defective crystals and weakened PL properties.

3. Strategies to enhance the stability of perovskite NCs
From the above discussions, the encapsulation by an appropriate shell that can prevent oxygen and moisture would effectively enhance the stability of PeNCs. Specifically, these encapsulation processes are achieved through combining with polymers, growing into inorganic space lattices, and coating with silica or other oxide shells by in situ synthesis or post-synthetic strategies. According to the number of PeNCs in one particle or unit cell of shell materials, the encapsulation can be classified into multiple-particle level and single-particle level encapsulation. In most of the cases, the combination with polymers or an inorganic matrix always forms numerous PeNCs dispersed in one particle or unit cell, which is certainly attributed to multiple particle level encapsulation. When under precise control, a single PeNC would be well coated by one shell molecule and totally separated from other NCs, forming encapsulation at the single particle level. It should be noted that the encapsulation at the single particle level is similar to the widely studied core–shell structure in conventional semiconductor NCs. Different from the encapsulation at the multiple particle level, the encapsulation at the single particle level (core–shell structure) can not only enhance the stability but also modulate the optical and electrical properties of NCs. Theoretically, two types of core–shell structures are widely investigated due to the core–shell band alignment. In the type-I structure, the bandgap of the core is surrounded by the shell and the minimum conduction band of the core is higher than that of the shell while the maximum valence band of the core is lower than that of the shell. In this circumstance, both electrons and holes are confined to the core, giving rise to substantially increased PL quantum yields (QYs) and improved stability. However, the type-II structure has a staggered band gap arrangement between the core and shell, which is beneficial to the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.16,17 It can be clearly seen that NCs with a type I structure are more suitable for light-emitting applications and those with a type-II structure are widely applied in solar cells. On this basis, in order to build ideal core–shell structures for various applications, the type of bandgap configuration should be considered beforehand.32–36 The detailed research progress related to multiple-particle encapsulation and single-particle encapsulation are summarized as follows.
3.1 Encapsulation at the multiple-particle level
Metal halide PeNCs can be affected by many common factors such as oxygen, humidity, light, and heat. Therefore, investigating appropriate encapsulation strategies and materials has attracted broad attention. To date, several types of protective materials have been proposed, such as metal oxides, metal salts, organic polymers, amorphous glass, etc. Silica coatings for conventional semiconductor QDs are also used for metal halide PeNCs due to their non-toxicity, mechanical robustness, high thermal stability, and good light transmission properties.37–40 As can be seen from Fig. 3a, a large number of CsPbBr3 QDs are almost uniformly distributed in one silica sphere. The HRTEM image in Fig. 3b shows the high crystallinity of CsPbBr3 QDs with an average size of approximately 9 nm. The improved light stability is attributed to the good dispersion of QDs without close contact, which greatly avoids the light induced aggregation and PL reduction. With the same idea, Shao et al. reported the coating of CsPb2Br5 NCs by mesoporous silica. The resultant CsPb2Br5/silica composite exhibited brighter emission and better stability against water, heat, and light exposure compared to bare CsPb2Br5 NCs.40 For conventional growth of the SiO2 shell on QDs through hydrolysis, the water involved may cause decomposition of PeNCs. On the other hand, the SiO2 obtained by the hydrolysis process is non-compact, and could not prevent water from penetrating into PeNCs. In order to improve the density of SiO2 shells on CsPbX3 NCs, a high temperature annealing technique has been demonstrated as an effective way to promote the crosslinking structure and compactness of SiO2. Studies have shown that high temperature annealing above 1073 K can induce the transition of SiO2 films from amorphous to crystalline and achieve better barrier properties.41 However, due to the severe oxidation or melting of the surface of CsPbX3 NCs, the annealing temperature cannot exceed 423 K. To overcome this, Zhang et al. proposed a simple strategy for the preparation of stable, highly luminescent ceramic CsPbBr3 NCs based on silica molecular sieve (MS) assisted in situ encapsulation (Fig. 3c).42 The synthesis process was a high temperature solid-phase reaction without organic solvents and ligands. Due to the encapsulation of dense SiO2 at high temperatures (873 to 1173 K), the operational stability of the as-prepared CsPbBr3/SiO2 powder exhibited almost unchanged PL intensity in an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution for 50 days (Fig. 3f).

As for metal oxides, Wang et al. prepared a highly emissive CsPbBr3 NCs/Al2O3 composite using an in situ solid phase growth strategy with mesoporous Al2O3 as the template under high temperature.43 The thermal stability of the as fabricated CsPbBr3 NCs/Al2O3 composite was even better than commercial KSF phosphors. In addition, 500 g of CsPbBr3/Al2O3 powder was obtained in a single attempt, demonstrating the possibility for large scale fabrication of this method. To avoid sintering at high temperatures, Loiudice et al. developed a low temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) process for AlOx deposition on CsPbX3 QDs films.44 The AlOx matrix protects CsPbX3 QDs from oxygen and moisture in the air, providing strong stability in moisture and high temperature. Moreover, this method shows wide applicability and could be successfully applied for PeNCs with various components such as CsPbBr3, CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3−xIx. Fig. 4b shows the cross-section scanning transmission electron microscopy high-angle ring darkfield (STEM-HAADF) images of CsPbBr3QDs/AlOx nanocomposites, perfectly revealing that QDs are embedded in the alumina matrix. Due to the protection of the AlOx shell, the nanocomposites showed minimal PL quenching and no obvious energy transfer after irradiation for 8 h (Fig. 4c). At the same time, the effect of annealing on CsPbBr3 QDs/AlOx nanocomposites was also studied. Fig. 4d shows the XRD spectra before and after the annealing of primitive QDs and nanocomposites. After annealing, the XRD pattern of the original QD film showed greatly narrowed XRD peaks and additional new peaks, which demonstrated the recrystallization and decomposition of CsPbBr3 crystals. In contrast, the XRD patterns of CsPbBr3 QDs/AlOx nanocomposites do not exhibit any obvious changes. In summary, alumina coating and infiltration is an effective protection strategy to prevent ion diffusion and decomposition during the annealing process.

As an example of metallic salt related encapsulation, Dirin et al. proposed a unique two step method to manufacture perovskite NCs.45 First, the accompanying crystallization of perovskite NCs and salt matrix was achieved in a polar solvent, which allows perovskite NCs to nucleate, grow and anchor on the surface of the microcrystalline salt. Subsequently, by introducing Na+ and Br− in the precursor, NaBr would precipitate on the surface of the salt matrix and perovskite NCs, as shown in Fig. 5a. The resulting composite exhibited great chemical stability against a variety of polar solvents (Fig. 5b). In addition, An et al. demonstrated that CsPbBr3 NCs were grown in pores of mesoporous silica using the molten salt at a temperature of 623 K.46 This special salt (i.e. the mixture of inorganic KNO3, KBr and NaNO3) acted as a reaction medium with closed porosity, so that CsPbBr3 NCs could be effectively isolated from the external environment. The emission characteristics of these composites remained unchanged even after being soaked in aqua regia for several weeks (Fig. 5c).

The formation of PeNCs/polymer composites is another common option to improve the resistance of PeNCs to harmful environments. Zhang et al. firstly dispersed CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (Fig. 6a), and then the obtained intermediate was embedded in microspheres (MHSs) of the polystyrene matrix to fabricate CsPbX3 NCs@MHSs.5 The PVP protective layer can not only provide CsPbX3 NCs with high QYs and a narrow emission line width, but also serve as an interface layer to make PeNCs more compatible with polystyrene molecules. Besides, Wang et al. reported a spray assisted coil-globule transition method to fabricate scalable CsPbBr3@PMMA nanospheres (Fig. 6b).47 In this method, PVP was introduced as the surfactant and a mixture of CsPbBr3 NCs, dichloromethane and PMMA was sprayed onto a non-polar petroleum ether (PET) at a controlled liquid flow rate of 1 mL min−1 to form a monodisperse CsPbBr3/PMMA nanosphere. At the same time, the interaction between PVP and PMMA chains assisted in the coating of PMMA molecules onto CsPbBr3 NCs. The synthesized CsPbBr3/PMMA nanospheres not only possess QYs of 73%, but also maintain a fluorescence intensity of 81% after exposure to water for more than 80 days. Other polymers, such as polystyrene (PS), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and copolymer polystyrene-block poly 2-vinylpyridine (PS-b-P2VP), have also been successfully used to improve the stability and optical properties of PeNCs.48–50

Due to good thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability, amorphous glass is also widely applied as a matrix for various NCs.51–53 Inspired by the strategy of conventional semiconductor NCs, PeNCs embedded in glass have also been studied. Ye et al. reported a melt growth process to generate CsPbX3 NCs embedded in boron germanate glass.54 In this process, powders of PbO, Cs2CO3, NaX (X = Cl, Br or I) and boron germanate glass were mixed thoroughly, melted at 1473 K for 30 min, and then quenched to room temperature to form the target compound. During heating, the ionized Pb2+, Cs+ and I− were combined together to form CsPbX3 NCs which dispersed within the glass substrate. By controlling the halide composition and heat treatment conditions, the PL of CsPbX3 NCs embedded in the glass can be tuned over a wide range. However, the melting of glass at a higher temperature would result in significant volatilization of the Br source and decreased crystallinity of the CsPbBr3 phase, which leads to low QYs. To avoid this, Yuan et al. developed an in situ crystalline strategy to directly grow CsPbBr3 QDs into a specially designed low melting TeO2-based glass matrix (Fig. 6c).55 The as-fabricated QD-embedded glass exhibited typical bright green emission under UV excitation with QYs up to 70%. Moreover, the light/thermal stability was also significantly improved attributed to the effective protection of glass with a dense structure. Other amorphous glasses such as phosphate glass and borosilicate glass have also been used as the matrix for encapsulation of perovskite NCs.56,57
3.2 Single-particle level encapsulation
Although impressive stability improvement can be achieved through the above strategies, the regulation on optical and electrical properties of PeNCs is still insufficient. These strategies always result in multiple PeNCs existing in a single shell molecule, which is not beneficial for precise control of particle size and good dispersion of PeNCs. It has been recognized that the luminescent properties of PeNCs are strongly dependent on their size. The lack of effective size control and unavoidable aggregation of the above strategies always result in PeNCs with a particle size larger than tens of nanometers. Besides, the electrical properties of PeNCs are significantly weakened because of the low conductivity of shell materials. In general, the above-mentioned strategies related to encapsulation at the multiple-particle level exhibit some shortcomings that limit their wide applications. Regarding this, the encapsulation of perovskite NCs at the single particle level has been developed inspired by the well-studied core shell structure in conventional NCs.
Hu et al. successfully fabricated monodisperse CsPbX3/SiO2 Janus nanoparticles by combining a water-triggered transformation process (Fig. 7a).58 Due to surface passivation initiated by water treatment and silica modification, CsPbX3/SiO2 Janus NCs exhibit significantly enhanced PL stability under air, water and light. In addition, these Janus nanostructures have small size and good dispersion in solution, which facilitates the formation of high quality thin films. In the same year, Zhong et al. proposed a simple one-pot method for synthesizing CsPbBr3@SiO2 core–shell NCs with high stability (Fig. 7b).59 By injecting a mixture of CsBr, PbBr2, oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OLA), dimethylformamide (DMF) and ammonia aqueous solution into a toluene solution containing tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), monodisperse CsPbBr3@SiO2 core–shell NCs were obtained. The growth process was carefully monitored and a reasonable growth mechanism was demonstrated. Due to the coating by the silica layer, the as-prepared CsPbBr3 NCs were stable under harsh conditions such as ultrasonication in water.

II–VI and IV–VI binary semiconductors have also been applied as shell materials to improve the stability and optoelectronic properties of PeNCs. The construction of the core shell structure using II–VI and IV–VI semiconductors as shells is widely studied in conventional NCs such as CdSe/CdS, CdSe/ZnS and CdTe/ZnS.60–62 Tang et al. reported the fabrication of core–shell CsPbBr3/CdS NCs based on a continuous thermal injection method. Cd-oleate and OLA-S were selected as precursors to grow thinner CdS shells (Fig. 7c).63 Compared with bare NCs, the as-fabricated core–shell CsPbBr3/CdS NCs possessed improved stability and a reduced non-radiative recombination rate due to the suppressed Auger recombination. Liu et al. prepared CsPbBr3/nCdS (n = 1, 2, 3) NCs with varied shell thicknesses using the same precursors.64 In order to further improve the stability of these NCs, a precursor solution containing aluminum isopropanol was added to the reaction solution to induce the growth of aluminum hydroxide shells on CsPbBr3/CdS NCs. The core–shell structured CsPbBr3/CdS/Al NCs exhibited long-term structural and photo stability (Fig. 7d).
In addition to oxides and inorganic binary semiconductors, perovskites and their derivatives are also used for the fabrication of PeNCs with core–shell structures. Zhang et al. reported the fabrication of core–shell FAPbBr3/CsPbBr3 NCs using epitaxial growth of CsPbBr3 inorganic layers on the surface of FAPbBr3 NCs (Fig. 8a).65 FAPbBr3 NCs was pre-synthesized using a thermal injection method, and Cs2CO3, PbBr2, oleic acid (OA) and oleyamine (OLA) were directly added to the crude solution of FAPbBr3 NCs for shell growth of CsPbBr3. In this core–shell structure, the formation of the FAxCs1−xPbBr3 intermediate alloy layer mitigated the lattice mismatch between the perovskites with varied composition (FAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3). The as-fabricated FAPbBr3/CsPbBr3 core–shell NCs showed an average size of 11.2 ± 1.1 nm and QYs up to 93%. Moreover, the low dimensional perovskites show wider bandgaps and better stability than their 3D counterparts, which makes them suitable candidates for acting as shells on the surface of 3D PeNCs. Jia et al. used 0D Cs4PbX6 for the synthesis of core–shell CsPbX3/Cs4PbX6 NCs for the first time through seed growth (Fig. 8b).32 These core–shell NCs consisted of a narrow band gap CsPbX3 core and Cs4PbX6 shell with a large bandgap. Therefore, the Cs4PbBr6 shell could effectively confine the photo generated excitons in the CsPbBr3 core. As a result, the obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 core–shell NCs showed high QYs up to 96.2%. Saliba and Park et al. reported that the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells were improved by incorporating a small amount of oxidation stable rubidium ions (Rb+).66,67 Inspired by this, Wang et al. developed a controlled post-synthetic phase change strategy to prepare stable CsPbBr3/Rb4PbBr6 core–shell NCs (Fig. 8c).68 The introduction of rubidium oleate triggered a phase transition, and the Rb4PbBr6 shell was formed through a cation exchange process. Perovskite NCs coated with a Rb4PbBr6 shell exhibited higher structural stability than perovskite NCs coated with a Cs4PbBr6 shell due to the better thermodynamic stability of Rb4PbBr6. Qiao et al. fabricated water-resistant, monodisperse and stable CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 NCs using an improved non-stoichiometric solution phase reaction.69 During the synthetic process, the surface of CsPbBr3 NCs was coated with a 2D layer of CsPb2Br5 to form the core–shell structure. The PL stability of CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 NCs was significantly improved due to the protection of the relatively wide-band gap CsPb2Br5 shell in water and ethanol (Fig. 8d).

Above all, the encapsulation at both the multiple particle level and single level can greatly improve the stability of PeNCs to meet the requirements for device applications. It should be distinguished that the encapsulation on PeNCs is different from the encapsulation on whole devices achieved by UV adhesives. The latter only provides simple physical insulation from moisture and oxygen without any chemical functions, which leads to limited performance enhancement. Compared to encapsulation at the multiple particle level, the construction of PeNCs with a core–shell structure has become a new research hotspot due to their wider application areas, especially in electroluminescence (EL) devices.
4. Optoelectronic applications
4.1 LEDs
PeNCs possess tunable emissions, high color purity and cost-effective solution processability, which has attracted widespread attention in lighting and display technology. Due to the passivation of surface defects by shell molecules, PeNCs in the encapsulation structure show prolonged fluorescence lifetime and higher QYs, which is beneficial for acting as the emissive layer in light emitting applications. In principle, the use of PeNCs in light emitting applications can be classified into phosphor converted and EL devices. In phosphor converted devices, PeNCs are incorporated and excited by blue or ultraviolet chips, working as the light conversion medium. For EL devices, the emitted photons are originated from the electrons and holes injected by an applied electric field and eventually recombination in the perovskite layer. Compared to phosphor converted applications, the application in EL not only desires high QYs but also excellent electrical conductivity, setting higher requirements for PeNCs. Because of the optical transparency, chemical inertness and non-toxicity, perovskite NCs encapsulated by SiO2 have been extensively studied in phosphor converted LED applications. For example, Wang et al. reported the coating of CsPbBr3 NCs by mesoporous SiO2 to prevent ion exchange with improved stability. The as-fabricated NCs/silica nanocomposites containing green QDs were further mixed with red emissive perovskite QDs, obtaining a white LED under excitation by a blue InGaN chip.41 The white LED acting as the backlight achieved a color gamut with 113% NTSC and 85% Rec. 2020 standard. Except for SiO2, polymers can also be used as protective shells for PeNCs. Zhou et al. used hydrophobic semicrystalline PVDF as the matrix for MAPbBr3 NCs to prepare MAPbBr3/PVDF composite with QYs up to 95%.50 By combining a green emissive composite film and a red emissive K2SiF6:Mn4+ (KSF) phosphor as well as a blue InGaN chip, an efficient wide color gamut white LED with a luminous efficiency of 109 lm W−1 and a color gamut of 121% NTSC was prepared. Huang et al. successfully synthesized a MAPbBr3@SiO2/PVDF composite with double hydrophobic shells by infiltrating MAPbBr3 precursor solution into hollow silicon nanospheres and then covering them with PVDF.70 Under the dual protection of SiO2 and PVDF, the stability of MAPbBr3@SiO2/PVDF nanocomposites under water and ultraviolet radiation was greatly improved. Finally, a white LED with a luminous efficiency of up to 147.5 lm W−1 was obtained using MAPbBr3@SiO2/PVDF nanoparticles as the green light source (Fig. 9a and b). For EL devices, core–shell structured FAPbBr3/CsPbBr3 NCs were reported and fabricated through epitaxial growth. Due to the good conductivity and passivation of the CsPbBr3 shell, the resultant EL devices achieved enhanced EL performance with a maximum current efficiency of 19.75 cd A−1 and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.1% (Fig. 9c and d), which is 4 and 8 times higher than that of FAPbBr3 NC based devices, respectively. In addition, the operation lifetime of core–shell FAPbBr3/CsPbBr3 based devices was also greatly improved (47 minutes) and twice that of FAPbBr3-based devices, demonstrating the improved light stability of FAPbBr3/CsPbBr3 NCs.65

4.2 Solar cells
Photovoltaic devices utilizing PeNCs have also attracted wide interest along with the rapid development of perovskite thin film-based solar cells. Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite NC-based solar cells has reached a high level, the stability issue still remains a major challenge. To overcome this, Xi et al. designed p–i–n solar cells based on core–shell CsPbI3 NCs that can be processed at low temperature in the open air.71 A new ligand 4-fluorophenylethyl ammonium iodide (FPEAI) was used to enhance binding and charge coupling between the ligand and the NCs. By treating the in situ formed CsPbI3 quasi-nanocrystalline films at low temperatures, the maximum PCE of p–i–n solar cells reached 13.4%, which still remained at 92% after 500 h in ambient air. Wang et al. used PbSe as the shell for fabrication of colloidal CsPbI3/PbSe heterostructures and the corresponding solar cells. The introduction of PbSe not only improved the absorption of sunlight, but also passivated the surface of PeNCs, obtaining lower trap densities and extending the exciton lifetime.72 Moreover, PbSe could also modify the electronic properties of the composite films by changing the CsPbI3 QDs from n-type to more ambipolar behavior, thus promoting the carrier separation and collection efficiency. These improvements resulted in high-performance CsPbI3/PbSe QD solar cells with a maximum PCE of 13.9% (Fig. 10a and b). Li et al. prepared CsxFA1−xPbI3/[GaAA3]4 core–shell NCs by introducing gallium(III) acetylacetone (GaAA3) as the precursor for the formation of metal organic complex intermediates ([GaAA3]4).73 Due to the epitaxial growth of the ultra-thin [GaAA3]4 shell, the deep trap states at the core–shell interface can be effectively passivated, promoting PCEs from 14% to 17% (Fig. 10c). More importantly, the stability of solar cells containing these core–shell PeNCs were significantly improved. The average PCE decline of these devices was lower than 10% over 800 h operation under 50% humidity, while 30% reduction in PCE was observed for devices utilizing core-only CsxFA1−xPbI3 NCs (Fig. 10d). Therefore, it has been widely recognized that the encapsulation for PeNCs is an effective strategy for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

4.3 Photodetectors
Similar to applications in solar cells, the advantages of a large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, and long carrier diffusion length make PeNCs suitable candidates for photodetectors as well.74 Saleem et al. reported high performance photodetectors using quasi core–shell CsPbBr3/FAI NCs as the active layer.75 Due to the fact that alkylamine ligands on the surface were partially replaced during passivation of FAI, the carrier mobility of the CsPbBr3/FAI NCs film could be highly improved. As a result, photodetectors with the structure of ITO/ZnO (100 nm)/CsPbBr3 (150 nm)/Au exhibited a specific detection rate of 1013 Jones and a response rate of 19 A W−1 at 1.5 V under 3 mW cm−2 (405 nm) light illumination. As a most promising field, photodetectors working in the infrared region have attracted broad interest. Liu et al. fabricated a near-infrared (NIR) light detector by directly coating a layer of Cs-doped FAPbI3 perovskite film onto vertical Si nanowire (SiNW) arrays.76 The as-fabricated device possessed distinct advantages of a large Ilight/Idark ratio exceeding 104 (Fig. 11a), and a swift response rate with rise/decay times of 4/8 μs (Fig. 11b). According to the numerical simulation based on a finite model, the superior device performance was associated with the strong light trapping effect in this unique core–shell heterojunction array. In addition, Zhou et al. fabricated a flexible NIR detector utilizing OPCs/NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+@NaYF4:Nd3+/MAPbI3 hybrid structure with NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+@NayF4:Nd3+ acting as upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and MAPbI3 acting as the photoelectric conversion layer (Fig. 11c).77 The resultant NIR detectors exhibited excellent detection performance, good bending resistance, and long term stability (Fig. 11d).

4.4 Lasers
The two main unique properties of PeNCs are the narrow emission line width and slow trap assist recombination rate, which are desired in amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and lasing.78–80 Hu et al. obtained strong ASE using nonblinking CsPbBr3/SiO2 NCs.33 By embedding CsPbBr3 QDs into anhydrous silica spheres (Fig. 12a), the blinking of QDs could be significantly suppressed, effectively improving the moisture resistance and light stability of QDs. Silicon spheres can also prevent anion exchange of halide ions between perovskite QDs. Ultra-stable ASE based on QDs/SiO2 was observed under continuous laser irradiation with almost no decline after storage at room temperature for 60 days. Most significantly, the ASE threshold (Pth) of the CsPbBr3 QDs was reduced by 50% and the relative efficiency increased by 388% (Fig. 12b). In addition, by covering CsPbBr3 QDs with semiconductor CdS, the resulting CsPbBr3/CdS core–shell QDs exhibited ultrahigh chemical stability and nonblinking PL as well as high QYs.63 The emission intensity variation of CsPbBr3/CdS QDs under continuous excitation of 800 nm laser pulses (pumping intensity is 0.98 mJ cm−2) for at least 3 h (up to 1.08 × 107 excitation cycles) was demonstrated with extremely small fluctuations, as shown in Fig. 12c. Furthermore, by integrating core–shell CsPbBr3/CdS NCs into microtube resonators, stable, low threshold and high quality lasers under one and two-photon excitation were achieved.

In addition to the enhancement in the operating stability, the encapsulation also has a great effect on the physical and chemical properties of PeNCs as well as other parameters of related devices. For example, in PeNC based solar cells, the encapsulation can tune the bandgap of PeNCs, which is conducive to improving the open circuit voltage. In LED applications, the encapsulation may result in a more uniform particle size and fewer defects, which contributes to a wider color gamut and lowering the open voltage of PeNC-based EL devices. Overall, the encapsulation shows a comprehensive effect on PeNCs and related devices, in which the enhancement in device operation stability seems more effective and attracts broad attention.
5. Conclusions and outlook
In conclusion, the recent advances in the fabrication of PeNCs with an encapsulation structure are summarized and reviewed. The inherent instability of PeNCs is illustrated to emphasize the significance of encapsulation. Specifically, the encapsulation strategies are introduced in detail with classification into multiple-particle encapsulation and single-particle encapsulation. The main differences between these two encapsulation forms are discussed to reveal the advantages of single-particle encapsulation, especially the applications in EL devices. Moreover, the important contribution of encapsulation of PeNCs to device performance improvement is also demonstrated by analyzing the latest progress in the literature. The remaining challenges and prospects for future studies may focus on the following aspects: (i) precise control of the shell thickness and monodispersity of PeNCs in the encapsulation structure should be further improved. (ii) New material fabrication techniques for the construction of PeNCs with an encapsulation structure such as epitaxial growth, microfluidic synthesis, and in situ formation strategy are suggested to be of interest. (iii) The encapsulation of PeNCs at the single-particle level, also well known as the core–shell structure, exhibits superior electrical and optical properties, which is expected as a promising candidate for future device applications. Especially, the core–shell heterostructures formed through 3D perovskites and low dimensional perovskite derivates are attractive new structures in PeNCs.
Although there still exist some gaps towards commercialization requirements, PeNCs with encapsulation have been demonstrated with great potential in various optoelectronic applications. Longer operation lifetime and improved performance can be achieved through emerging new encapsulation strategies, which is expected to bring a bright future for applications of PeNCs in photoelectric devices. With numerous efforts from researchers, it is believed that the encapsulated PeNCs would provide the possibility for further promoting the development and commercialization of PeNC-based optoelectronics.
