    , Accepted 9th September 2019First published on 9th September 2019AbstractAlkali metal cation modulation toward high-electronic-quality perovskite films requires strict control over trap densities in the devices. By introducing tailor-made potassium cation (K+)-functionalized carbon nanodots (CNDs@K) into the perovskite precursor solution, we succeeded in defect passivation and crystallization control of the perovskite film. X-ray diffraction indicated that the binding effect of carbon dots confined the K+ ions in the grain boundary and prevented excessive cations from occupying interstitial sites, thereby reducing the microstrain of the polycrystalline film. Consequently, the synergistic effect of the tailored crystal size and suppressed grain boundary defects could reduce the charge trap density, facilitate charge generation, and lengthen the carrier lifetime, leading to a boosted efficiency of 21.01% with a high fill factor of 84%. This performance is among the best reported for carbon dot-doped PSCs.
Organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are emerging as a novel alternative owing to their low-cost. In addition, in the past several years, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has rapidly increased from 3.9% to a certified 25.2%.1 The impressive PCE increase can be attributed to their superior optoelectronic properties, including a strong absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, and relatively long carrier diffusion length.2 Despite the rapid progress, the device performance of the perovskite solar cells is still far from their theoretical limits. It is still generally believed that the non-radiative losses originating from charge-carrier trap states in the perovskite layer are one of the critical factors for improving the PCE.3 Moreover, most of the defects in perovskite films are supposed to be located at the grain boundaries because of the presence of dangling bonds on the crystal surface and the sublimation of organic molecules during the thermal annealing process.4 Direct evidence of this includes the fact that the trap density in solution-processed polycrystalline MAPbI3 perovskite films (1016–1017 cm−3) is much higher than that in perovskite single crystals (109–1010 cm−3).5 Additionally, defects are recognized as one of the important reasons in triggering the anomalous current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis behavior and the degradation of perovskite solar cells.6 Therefore, it is of great importance to eliminate the defects in perovskite films for efficient photo-carrier transport.
Various materials have been employed to passivate the defects of perovskite films, such as metal/organic halide salts,7 solvents,8 Lewis bases,9 inorganic acids,10 and polymers.11 Recently, monovalent cation incorporation has attracted great interest for reducing the non-radiative recombination by decreasing the surface defects of perovskite grains.12 Interestingly, the internal photoluminescence yield can approach 100% after passivating the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films with potassium iodide (KI). In addition, alkali metals can also suppress the incident I2 defects and manipulate the stoichiometry via the iodine disproportionation reaction. The interstitial sites of these alkali cations in the perovskite lattice would raise the migration energy barrier for native halide defects, thus suppressing the ion migration and reducing the J–V hysteresis of perovskite solar cells.13 However, it is noted that the interstitial occupancy of alkali cations will cause lattice expansion and structure distortion, possibly resulting in some adverse effects on the perovskite films.14 For example, the incorporation of potassium cations (K+) will result in the reduction of the light absorption coefficient at wavelengths shorter than 750 nm, leading to a decrease in the short-circuit current density (Jsc).15 In addition, the amount of alkali halide additives should be carefully controlled to prevent the formation of another non-photoactive phase of KPbI3. Considering the complexity of perovskite formation and the difficulty in controlling the interstitial occupancy of the alkali cations, the development of strategies to control the passivation of K+ for high-quality perovskite films is essential for high photovoltaic performance.
In this study, we explore a novel strategy to modulate alkali surface passivation by preparing a large alkali ionic material, namely, K+-functionalized carbon nanodots (CNDs@K). We found that the large nanodot anions could effectively suppress the interstitial occupancy of the alkali cations without affecting surface passivation. In addition, CNDs@K increased the grain size as well as the crystallinity of the perovskite films. Consequently, an average PCE of over 21% was achieved based on the planar ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3–CNDs@K/PCBM/BCP/Ag device structure. More importantly, the fill factor (FF) of the devices reached up to 84.01%, which is one of the highest values in the planar perovskite solar cells.
We selected CNDs as the host material for K+ based on the following reasons: CNDs can be easily obtained from graphite or organic molecules, such as citric acid and glucose; CNDs have good chemical stability, photostability, dispersibility, and tunable optoelectronic properties; the surface properties of CNDs can be adjusted and thus rationally designed; CNDs can carry various metal ions simultaneously on their surfaces by means of covalent bonding/ionic bonding due to the presence of many functional groups on the surfaces of the dots; the high functionality of CNDs can tune the composition of perovskites through hydrogen bonding and passivate the defects.16
Our CNDs@K material was prepared by the reaction between potassium hydroxide (KOH) and carbon dots functionalized with carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups, fabricated through the carbonization of urea and citric acid in dimethyformamide (DMF). As shown in Fig. 1a, the ionized products first spontaneously assembled into the nanoplate structure upon intramolecular H-bonding urea and citric acid. Then, the polymerization of these assemblies through aromatization, carbonization, and dehydrolysis processes produced CNDs with abundant carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups on the surface (Fig. S1, ESI†). Further neutralization of the carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups on CNDs by KOH delivered the final product CNDs@K.17 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CNDs and CNDs@K at 26.1° (Fig. 1b) were indexed to the d-spacing interlayer of the sp2-bonding of graphitic carbon nitride.18Fig. 1c and d illustrate the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the as-synthesized CNDs@K, exhibiting a regular circular shape with an average diameter of 8 nm. The small size of CNDs@K is critical for the uniform dispersion of dots in solution and the effective fabrication of devices with a solution process. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images in Fig. 1e (in water) and Fig. 1f (in DMF) demonstrate the crystalline lattice fringe with the characteristic spacing of 0.28 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of the (020) planes.19 The obvious electron diffraction circle from the (020) crystal plane in Fig. 1g indicates the regular atomic arrangements and high crystallinity of CNDs@K, which agrees well with the XRD results.

We further performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the elemental characteristics of synthesized CNDs@K. As shown in Fig. 2a, CNDs@K presented typical C1s, N1s, O1s and K2p peaks. The C1s spectrum of CNDs@K showed four peaks at 284.5, 285.4, 286.1, and 287.4 eV (Fig. 2b) that correspond to C–C (sp2), C–C (sp3), C–N (sp3), and O–CO (sp2), respectively, indicating that the CNDs were functionalized by carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups. The functional groups were further confirmed from the N1s peaks (Fig. 2c) of C–N–C (sp3 at 398.6 eV) and N–(C)3 (sp3 at 400.1 eV), and the O1s peak (Fig. 2d) of O–CO at 531 eV. The presence of K2p at 292.8 and 296.8 eV (Fig. 2e) verified the successful introduction of K+ onto the surface of the CNDs.20

Considering that the electronic density and Fermi levels of carbon dots would be significantly changed with different surface molecules, we compared their UV-vis absorption and PL properties before and after K+ modification. Pristine CNDs showed an aquamarine blue luminescence (Fig. 2f) with three typical absorptions around 240 nm, 320 nm, and 495 nm (Fig. 2g), which can be attributed to the n–π* electronic transitions, π–π* transitions in the s-triazine rings, and surface functional groups, respectively. After K+ modification, the absorption peak at 320 nm was decreased and the absorption peak at 495 nm was shifted to around 520 nm. The reason is the strong ionic interaction between K+ and CNDs reducing the density of the amino-groups and increasing the electron-rich property of the carboxylate ions on the inner surface of the CNDs, leading to the rise in the Fermi level of CNDs.21 Similar to the UV-vis absorption, a strong and narrow photoluminescence excitation (PLE) peak of the CNDs centered at 574 nm shifted to 597 nm after K+ modification. The detailed photoluminescence (PL) spectra at different emission wavelengths are displayed in Fig. 2h and i. The CNDs showed the strongest emission at 600 nm with 520 nm excitation. CNDs@K exhibited the strongest emission at 620 nm under 560 nm excitation, corresponding to the absorption spectra. Overall, these results verified that K+ was modified onto the surfaces of the CNDs successfully through strong ionic combination.
Next, we fabricated perovskite films by employing K+ (KI), CNDs, and CNDs@K as additives. All XRD patterns in Fig. 3a show the (110), (220), and (310) diffraction peaks, corresponding to the same tetragonal structure of MAPbI3. The (110) peak intensity of the CNDs@K-doped CH3NH3PbI3 in Fig. 3b is much stronger than the pristine one, which would be beneficial for the carrier transfer.13 We further zoomed in on one main peak corresponding to the (040) crystal plane of the perovskite to understand the cation occupancy in the MAPbI3 crystalline lattice.15 As shown in Fig. 3c, the (040) peak of the K+ (KI)-doped perovskite films was slightly shifted toward a lower degree, suggesting that K+ from KI expanded the lattice by occupying the interstitial sites. The perovskite structure would collapse if numerous cations located at the A site are replaced by K+ cations (Fig. S2(i), ESI†). The lattice expansion would also result in increased defects if numerous cations occupy interstitial sites without methylammonium vacancies (Fig. S2(ii), ESI†).12,14 An impurity of KI and K2PbI4 with diffraction peaks at 13.1, 24.5, and 26.6 degrees appeared (Fig. 3a), suggesting the intramolecular interaction between the K+ (KI) additive with the perovskite lattice and the possible lattice distortion after K+ insertion. In contrast, there was no visible diffraction peak shift for the CNDs-doped perovskite. More interestingly, the diffraction peaks of the CNDs@K-doped perovskite (Fig. 3c) also exhibited no shift, indicating that the interaction between K+ and CND effectively prevented the entrance of K+ into the perovskite lattice.

The morphology of the perovskite films synthesized from the three different additives was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and is shown in Fig. 3d. All perovskite films showed full surface coverage and dense film morphology, but the films with K+ (KI) and CNDs showed a significant difference in the crystal size and flatness. It is worth mentioning that the grain size of the MAPbI3 with K+ (KI) was much larger, unraveling a better film crystallinity, but the K+ (KI)-doped perovskite showed some small scale cracks and bulge defects. In particular, the excess K+ (KI) doping led to an exaggerated strip-shape grain growth accompanying the presence of a secondary phase (Fig. S3, ESI†). Moreover, the CNDs@K-doped perovskite showed obviously increased grain sizes with a dense planar surface. We deduced that CNDs@K enhanced the compatibility by interactions with the grain boundaries of the perovskite films, implying that the defects on the grain boundary could be passivated effectively (Fig. 3d).22 Therefore, the increased grain sizes and surface flatness of the CNDs@K derived perovskite could decrease carrier recombination and improve electronic transmission, resulting in the dramatic increase in device performance (Voc and FF). All the morphology results are further confirmed by the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum in Fig. 3e and XRD measurement in Fig. S4 (ESI†).12,15
The charge dynamics in the CNDs@K-doped perovskite films were investigated from steady-state PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). The PL intensity of the CNDs@K-doped perovskite films in Fig. 3e and f showed an increase of about three times that of the pristine films, suggesting that CNDs@K can passivate the defects of the perovskite films, which might result from effective crystallization control of CNDs@K (Fig. S5, ESI†).23 Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films with various concentrations of CNDs@K. Compared with the pristine perovskite, we observed increased absorption after CNDs@K doping, which should be associated with larger perovskite crystal sizes. The passivation effect was also confirmed by the TRPL spectrum. The TRPL data was fitted by a bi-exponential decay process with two exponential decay components (τ1 and τ2), and the fitting parameters are summarized in Fig. 3g. A small value of τ1 reflects a lower content of grain boundary defects. Therefore, the decreased τ1 for the CNDs@K (0.25) derived perovskites represents efficient passivation of the grain boundary defects through CNDs@K. The higher value of τ1 for the excessive dose of CNDs@K (0.4) indicates the increased number of trap states. In addition, the efficient enhancement in the crystal sizes and surface flatness increases the carrier lifetime, which significantly suppresses the current carrier recombination, resulting in a dramatically increased device performance (Voc and FF).
In the following, we compare the photovoltaic performance of pristine and perovskite films with different dopants. Solar cells with a planar structure of ITO/PTAA:F4TCNQ/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/BPhen/Ag were fabricated. All of the fabrication steps were conducted under a dehumidified atmosphere (∼25 °C, RH < 30%). The focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) cross-sectional image of the PSCs is shown in Fig. 4a. All J–V characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and the photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table S1.† It can be seen that both CNDs and K+ (KI)-doped devices displayed improved performances with improved Jsc, Voc, and FF. However, the CNDs@K-doped perovskite devices showed the highest photovoltaic efficiency. As shown in Fig. 4b, the optimized performance of the pristine perovskite demonstrated a Jsc of 21.51 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V, and a FF of 78.51%, yielding a PCE of 18.25%. The PCE of the CNDs@K-doped perovskite reached up to 21.01%. In particular, the FF of the devices reached up to 84.07%, which is one of the highest values in the planar perovskite solar cells. The increased FF can be explained by the facilitated exciton dissociation and charge transport due to the improved crystallinity and decreased defect density of the perovskite films, which agrees well with the electron/hole-only devices in Fig. S8 (ESI†) and the dark J–V characteristics in Fig. 4c. Following Ohm's law, the leakage current through shunting resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) can be expressed as . Therefore, Rs is typically taken to be the inverse slope of the dark current around J (0 mW cm−2, 1.5 V) and Rsh is the inverse slope around J (0 mW cm−2, 0 V). The dark current density of the CNDs@K-doped devices is much lower at the reverse bias and low positive bias, and higher than the control device when the flat band condition is reached. These results confirm that the CNDs@K can increase the Rsh of the perovskite films by increasing the crystallinity and passivating the grain boundary, leading to the dramatic increase in Voc and FF.24

It is also worth mentioning that the devices based on the CNDs@K-doped perovskite exhibit excellent reproducibility (Fig. 4d). More than half of the devices from the CNDs@K-doped perovskite showed a PCE of over 20%. All devices showed a negligible hysteresis (Fig. 4e), which can be attributed to the high film quality and fullerene passivation of the control devices.25 In addition, we performed a steady-state photocurrent measurement to monitor the stabilized power output as a function of time. The control device showed a photocurrent of 21.5 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 18.2%, and the modified device indicated a photocurrent of 22.6 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 20.9% (Fig. 4f), consistent with the J–V results. The calculated Jsc values from the integration of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Fig. 4g) also agree well with the J–V curves.
In summary, we have demonstrated an ion modulation approach to control the grain boundary passivation of perovskite film by K+ (KI) without entering the crystal lattice to prevent lattice distortion. In addition, the CNDs@K dopants enhanced the crystallinity of the perovskite films and the passivation grain boundary defects. After optimizing the concentration of CNDs@K, the PCE of the doped perovskite device achieved 21.01% with a maximum FF of up to 84.07%. These findings elucidate the modulation of ion passivation to achieve high power conversion efficiency, which is critical for material optimization processes toward further industrial application.
