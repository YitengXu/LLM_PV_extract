, Accepted 27th June 2013First published on 28th June 2013AbstractCdS nanostructured thin films have been directly fabricated on indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates through a one-step solvothermal process involving a cadmium nanocrystal layer and sulfur powder in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was then infiltrated into the CdS framework. The CdS film and the CdS–P3HT hybrid film were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and UV-vis spectroscopy. CdS–P3HT hybrid film exhibited a wider absorption in the solar spectrum and stronger photo-current response and external quantum efficiency than a pure CdS and P3HT film. Hybrid solar cell devices have been constructed based on the CdS–P3HT hybrid film with structure ITO–CdS–P3HT–Au. The effects of sulfur sources, solvent and thickness of elemental cadmium films on the photovoltaic performance of CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cells were assessed.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices have recently drawn increasing attention due to the many advantages of organic devices, such as easy fabrication, flexibility and low cost. But low carrier mobility and small exciton diffusion length of organic materials reduce the efficiency for charge collection and thus limit the performance of these solar cells.1,2 To overcome these disadvantages of organic materials, investigators have turned to hybrid solar cells composed of inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals and conjugated polymers. This alternative type of polymer solar cell shows promise for the development of low-cost, large-area, mechanically flexible photovoltaic devices.3,4 Such hybrid solar cells have the combined merits of both organic and inorganic materials, namely the low-cost solution processing capability of the organic semiconductors together with the high electron mobility and excellent chemical and physical stability of inorganic semiconductors. Different inorganic nanostructures of CdSe,5–8 FeS2,9 ZnO,10,11 In2S3,12 Ag2S,13 and CdS,14–20 have been successfully employed for fabrication of hybrid solar cells. Among these, cadmium sulfide (CdS), a II–VI semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 2.4 eV, has proven to be an excellent photoactive and charge transport material in optoelectronic devices. Cadmium sulfide is therefore an appropriate choice as an acceptor in organic–inorganic hybrid photovoltaic devices. The conventional method for preparing a nanocrystal-conjugated polymer composite is by mixing a given polymer with nanocrystals through the use of surfactants. However, the surfactants used in this procedure would form an insulating interface, causing a reduction in charge transfer ability.3,21 Moreover, organic and inorganic components must be mixed and subsequently and then spin-coated for the formation of a hybrid film on the electrode for the photovoltaic device. Clearly, spin coating would not result in an adequately tight junction between the deposited hybrid film and electrode. To overcome these problems, we have previously developed a direct elemental reaction route to synthesize CuI,22 In2S3,12 Ag2S,13 and CuS thin films.23 Solvothermal/hydrothermal based one-pot method has become one popularly wet chemical approach for preparing semiconductor nanostructures at low temperature.24–26 We present here a facile and similar route for in situ construction of CdS nanocrystals films directly on indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates. This was simply done through a one-step solvothermal treatment of cadmium nanocrystals that deposited on the ITO substrate and sulfur powder in the presence of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). After the formation of the CdS nanocrystals film, a poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) layer was spin-coated in the CdS framework, and finally evaporated an Au electrode as anode through a shadow mask. The transient photocurrent response of the as-prepared CdS thin film and CdS–P3HT hybrid film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution under 300 W UV irradiation was investigated. The photovoltaic performance of the solar cells with the structure of ITO/CdS:P3HT/Au was evaluated at room temperature under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G simulated globe sun illumination from a filtered xenon lamp. The level of standard irradiance (AM1.5G irradiation, 100 mW cm−2) was set with a calibrated c-Si reference solar cell. Moreover, we studied the effects of sulfur sources, different media and thickness of cadmium nanocrystals films on the photovoltaic properties of CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cells. The optimum experimental conditions were established. An external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.9% was obtained under the optimum conditions.
2. Experimental section
Fabrication of CdS nanostructured film on ITO
All of the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. The indium-tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass substrate (sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1) was washed with acetone, isopropyl alcohol and D.I. water under ultrasonication for 15 min. To avoid local short circuits, the ITO-covered glass substrates were structured via removing the ITO on a band of the substrate using photoengraving. In a typical synthesis, an 80 nm thick cadmium film was deposited onto the ITO surface by magnetron sputtering of a cadmium target under Ar atmosphere at ambient temperature. The base pressure in the chamber was kept below 1.0 × 10−4 mbar and the sputter deposition was carried out under a working pressure of 5 × 10−3 mbar at a power of 1000 V A and a sputter current of 35 mA. The sample holder was rotated at constant speed of 12 rpm during sputtering, and the distance between the target and samples was 40 mm. The final cadmium film thickness was detected by a film thickness monitor (FTM). Then the as-prepared 80 nm cadmium film, 0.05 mmol S (powder) and 21 mL DMF were put into a 28 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was then sealed, maintained at 120 °C for 12 h, and cooled down to room temperature. The resulting nanocrystal film, observed as a yellow film on the ITO surface, was washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and then dried at 50 °C for 2 h under vacuum. Reaction conditions were varied to optimize photovoltaic performance. CdS nanocrystal films were prepared using different thicknesses of cadmium films (60 nm and 100 nm). In addition thiourea and S powder were compared as sulfide sources. To determine the effects of solvent, 80 nm cadmium films were reacted with S powder in DMF and ethanol at 120 °C and 160 °C for 12 h, respectively.
Fabrication of CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cell
For fabrication of the hybrid solar cell device, a solution of P3HT (Aldrich, MW = 87000) in chloroform (15 mg mL−1) was spin-coated (2500 rpm) onto CdS films under an argon atmosphere in a glovebox. For a positive contact, an Au electrode was formed by vapor deposition of Au under vacuum (9.0 × 10−5 mbar) through a shadow mask, resulting in individual solar cell devices with 0.25 cm2 nominal area.
Characterization
The as-synthesized products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer) using monochromatized Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Digital Instruments, Nanoscope IIId) were used to characterize the morphology of the as-prepared products. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the samples was record on a Varian Cary 500 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence spectra were measured on a F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer using a 150 W Xe lamp (the excitation wavelength: 470 nm). The transient photocurrent response of the as-prepared CdS nanocrystal film and CdS–P3HT hybrid film was investigated under 300 W UV irradiation in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance of the hybrid solar cells (ITO/CdS:P3HT/Au) was evaluated using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. A Newport Inc. solar simulator fitted with a AM1.5G filter was used for excitation of the solar cells during measurements for the density–voltage curves. The irradiance of the emitted light from xenon lamp was 100 mW cm−2. The standard irradiance was set using a calibrated c-Si reference solar cell.
3. Results and discussion
Formation and characterization of CdS nanostructured film
The Cd film with thickness of about 80 nm was first deposited on an ITO substrate by magnetron sputtering. Solvothermal synthesis of a CdS film was achieved by direct reaction between Cd and S in DMF. Typically, the as-prepared 80 nm Cd film, 0.05 mmol S (powder) and 21 mL DMF were put into a 28 mL autoclave and reacted at 120 °C for 12 h. The resulting nanocrystal CdS film, observed as a yellow film on the ITO surface. The phase and crystallographic structure of the obtained products were examined by XRD. Fig. 1 shows a typical XRD pattern of the as-prepared CdS film obtained after solvothermal synthesis at 120 °C for 12 h. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to hexagonal wurtzite CdS (JCPDS no. 41-1069) with the P63/mc space group and a primitive hexagonal unit cell with a = 4.1409 and c = 6.7198 Å. All other peaks of the XRD pattern can be attributed to the ITO substrate (JCPDS File No. 6-416). These results indicate that the described solvothermal method yields a high purity products with well defined crystalline structure. In addition, the obvious XRD signal from ITO indicates no damage of ITO substrate after solvothermal reaction.

The morphologies of the original elemental cadmium film and the fabricated CdS film were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2a shows the two-dimensional AFM image of an 80 nm thick cadmium film deposited on an ITO glass substrate by magnetron sputtering. The average grain size of cadmium nanoparticles is measured to be 50 to 150 nm with high density. Typical SEM images of the CdS thin films obtained after solvothermal treatment at a low magnification reveal that the ITO glass is fully covered with large-area CdS nanoparticles (Fig. 2b). From the higher magnification (Fig. 2c), CdS nanoparticles in the film have a flower-like superstructure with high roughness. The grain diameter of the CdS nanoparticles is between 50 to 100 nm. Further, to study the effect of sulfide source on the formation of CdS thin film, we reacted thiourea with a 80 nm cadmium film under similar conditions (Fig. 2d). A quite different CdS film with a smooth surface comprising many quasi-tetrahedral particles formed when thiourea, rather than sulfur powder, was used as the sulfide source. The major disadvantage, however, of the CdS thin film obtained in thiourea is that it was found to easily peel off the surface of the ITO glass substrate. Therefore, sulfur powder was used to prepare CdS for further functional characterization and device fabrication. A solvothermal method is an easy and effective way to fabricate metal sulfide films, in addition to synthesizing CdS films, and it has been widely used for deposition of CIGS based solar cells.27–29

Optical and photo-current properties
The above large-scale and uniform semiconductor CdS film with a rough surface is a desirable component for fabricating photoelectric devices. We chose P3HT, an often-used polymer in photovoltaic applications, to prepare CdS–P3HT hybrid films. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the as-prepared CdS film, pristine P3HT film and CdS–P3HT hybrid film are shown in Fig. 3a. The pure CdS film absorbs in the UV and near visible region with a band edge of ∼515 nm. The pristine P3HT film exhibits a typical absorption spectrum in wavelengths from 400 to 650 nm. This strong visible light absorption of the P3HT feature will enhance the absorption spectrum of the CdS–P3HT hybrid film in this spectral region. As shown in Fig. 3a, the P3HT–CdS hybrid film displays a wide and strong absorption band from 250 nm to 650 nm. We noted a red-shifted and better absorption edge above 520 nm, coincident with the absorption edge of P3HT. Also the hybrid film absorbs light more efficiently below 450 nm compared to the pristine P3HT film. This enhanced absorption may be attributed to the CdS film itself. Fig. 3b shows the photoluminescence emission spectra of P3HT film and CdS–P3HT hybrid film. The PL intensity of the CdS–P3HT hybrid is significantly reduced compared to that of the pristine P3HT. Strong quenching of the PL emission occurring in the CdS–P3HT hybrid implies that charge separation effectively occurs before exciton recombination within P3HT.

The transient photocurrent responses of the as-prepared pure CdS film electrode and the P3HT–CdS hybrid film electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution under UV irradiation are shown in Fig. 4. A significant rise in the photocurrent responses can be observed for all the electrodes under UV irradiation (300 W). When the light is switched off, the current density returns to its pre-illuminated value, and the on–off cycles of photocurrent are reproducible over many cycles (only 7 cycles demonstrated here) without significant photocurrent decay. The initial current density of the pure CdS film is 17.3 μA cm−2, whereas the value for the P3HT–CdS hybrid film is 34.9 μA cm−2, which is two times more than that of the former. This is due to the formation of the p–n heterojunction at the interface between n-type CdS and p-type P3HT, wherein the photogenerated charges in CdS and P3HT are effectively separated. More interestingly, the pristine P3HT film could not generate a photocurrent in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution under UV irradiation. This observation may be attributed to the low carrier mobility and a small exciton diffusion length for the P3HT polymer film, leading to inefficient separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs at the P3HT/electrolyte interface.

Photovoltaic performance of CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cell device
Because of its strong absorption of visible light, desirable photo-current responses, ease of preparation and low cost, the CdS–P3HT hybrid film is a promising component for construction of photovoltaic cells. From the view of energy levels, CdS and P3HT are well matched for fabricating hybrid solar cells. Charge-transfer processes occurring within the P3HT–CdS hybrid solar cell are depicted in Fig. 5a (ITO depicted as the electron collector and Au as the hole collector). The conduction band of the CdS nanocrystal is more negative than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the P3HT. In the fabricated solar-cell devices (ITO/CdS:P3HT/Au), the light is absorbed by CdS and P3HT, and the excited electron–hole pairs are generated. Then, benefiting from the p–n heterojunction formed at the interface between n-type CdS and p-type P3HT, the photogenerated charges in CdS and P3HT are effectively separated. Subsequently, the separated electrons are efficiently transferred from the excited state (LUMO) of P3HT into the conduction band (Ec) of CdS and then quickly transferred to the surface of the ITO substrate. A schematic of the structure of the fabricated solar cell prepared in this way is depicted in Fig. 5b. The photovoltaic solar device, with the structure ITO/CdS:P3HT/Au, has an active area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2.

For the fabricated CdS–P3HT hybrid thin film solar cells, we conducted preliminary measurements to investigate their photovoltaic performance. Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage characteristics of the CdS–P3HT hybrid film when the solar cell devices are exposed to simulated solar light (AM 1.5 illumination, 100 mW cm−2). A short circuit current density (Isc) of 1.17 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.2 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.29 and conversion efficiency (η) of 0.068% were obtained. We found that the thickness of CdS films has a significant effect on the photovoltaic performance of the hybrid solar cells. Three cadmium films with thickness of 60, 80 and 100 nm, were used to prepare CdS films with different thickness by treatment with S powder in the presence of DMF. Subsequently, CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cells were fabricated according to the methods mentioned above. The output decreased for the photovoltaic devices formed from Cd films with thicknesses of 60 nm and 100 nm. This reduction of cell performance may be due to the following reasons: (1) the aggregated CdS nanoparticles might not only act as a charge transfer barrier to decrease the transfer efficiency from CdS to ITO, but also as recombination centers for the separated electron–hole pairs; (2) the use of a thinner CdS nanocrystalline layer may lead to leakage in and thereby reduce the performance of the photovoltaic cell. The thickness of the as-fabricated CdS–P3HT hybrid film with optimized photovoltaic performance was also measured to be about 200 nm from cross-sectional SEM image of the hybrid film (Fig. S1, ESI†). The influence of sulfur sources and reaction medium on the photovoltaic performance of CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cells was also investigated. The results are summarized in Table 1. For the CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cells where the CdS film was prepared with ethanol as the solvent or thiourea as the sulfur source, all of the values of Isc, Voc and η decreased greatly. The use of ethanol at 160 °C makes CdS particles aggregate and form larger groups (Fig. S2, ESI†). This may reduce the efficiency for separation and transfer of charge carriers. The CdS film obtained with thiourea as the sulfur source was not stable on the ITO substrate. These two observations may be the main reasons for the observed lower photo-current conversion efficiency. In addition, these observations may also provide clues for optimization of CdS thin film hybrid solar cells. The external quantum efficiency of the optimal cell was examined by recording the EQE% spectrum according to the standard formula,20  where JSC is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), λ is the wavelength (nm) of incident radiation, and P0 is the incident light intensity of the source (mW cm−2). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) results for the P3HT:CdS hybrid solar cell and the pristine P3HT conjugated polymer cell are shown in Fig. 7. The peak EQE for the CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cell is observed between 480 and 550 nm, with a shoulder peak around 600 nm. This shows that the photocurrent action spectra closely follow the absorption spectra of the devices. The highest EQE value obtained at 510 nm is ∼3.9%. However, the highest EQE of the pristine P3HT conjugated polymer cell obtained under our experiment conditions is only ∼0.0035% (inset of Fig. 7). This result indicates that combining the CdS and P3HT films significantly improves the external quantum efficiency. The CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cell presented here is a useful method to extend the efficiency of organic solar cells, which is key in addressing the low cost solar cell applications. However, it is important to note that current record solar conversion efficiency had been achieved by using multijunction solar cells based on III–V semiconductors.30,31 Recent advances in the fields of GaInNAs-containing quantum well active regions grown on GaAs substrates had resulted in record low-threshold laser devices,32–35 which in turn resulted in the recent realization of record 43.5% solar conversion efficiency.36

4. Conclusions
In summary, CdS nanostructured thin films were directly prepared through a one-step solvothermal process using nanoscale elemental cadmium layers and sulfur powders in the presence of DMF. Then, we fabricated hybrid photovoltaic devices based on active layers consisting of as-prepared CdS film and P3HT polymer for forming bulk-heterojunctions. We found that the reaction temperature, solvent and sulfide source all play an important role in the formation of the CdS thin films and thus influence the photovoltaic performance of the as-fabricated CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cells. The optimized photovoltaic performance of the CdS–P3HT hybrid solar cells was obtained under the current experiment conditions. Despite the improvement in the solar efficiency observed from the hybrid method, the solar cell efficiency is still relatively low. We believe the photovoltaic performance could be increased by device optimization, such as incorporating good absorption and conduction materials, e.g. noble metal nanoparticles and graphene, into the films to improve the photo-absorption and separation efficiency of electron and holes. This simple method is low-cost and environmental friendly, will lead to a potential way to “simply fabricate” solar cell devices.
