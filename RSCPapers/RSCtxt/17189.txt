    , Accepted 20th December 2019First published on 23rd December 2019AbstractNon-catalytic hydrolysis of CaMg2-based materials (abbreviated as CaMg2, CaMg2–0.1Ni, H-CaMg2, and H-CaMg2–0.1Ni hereinafter) fabricated by ball milling for hydrogen supply has been investigated in the present work. With respect to the as-melted counterparts, it is found that both milled CaMg2 and H-CaMg2-based samples can significantly enhance the hydrolysis performance via adjusting the milling durations. In particular, 0.5 h-milled CaMg2 and 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 exert optimal kinetics at ambient temperature, delivering a hydrogen yield of 539 mL g−1 within 2 h and 1439 mL g−1 of H2 within only 3 min, respectively. In addition, the further results indicate that the hydrogen uptake of CaMg2 can be accelerated by doping with the Ni element, giving rise to considerably enhanced hydrolytic dynamics, as opposed to a limited promotion of the hydrolysis of the CaMg2 alloy. For example, the hydrogen yield of H-CaMg2–0.1Ni increases from 853 to 1147 mL g−1 H2 in 5 min with hydrogenation durations ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 h, much higher than the values (598–954 mL g−1 H2) of H-CaMg2 under the same conditions. More specifically, the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 sample also demonstrates excellent cryogenic hydrolysis kinetics, achieving a hydrogen yield of 1332 mL g−1 H2 within 15 min at 0 °C. In comparison with the conventional hydrogenation of pristine CaMg2 conducted at elevated temperature, a more feasible strategy is applied to realize its hydrogen uptake by ball milling with Ni under mild conditions. Expectedly, the hydrogen supply capacities of the hydrogenated samples are markedly enhanced, making them promising to achieve their wide applications in hydrogen energy areas in the future.
Introduction
Continuously rising concerns over depleting the resources of conventional energy (such as coal, natural gas, petroleum, etc.) and the environmental issues of burning fossil fuels have prompted tremendous efforts for the exploration of sustainable and renewable alternative energy carriers, including nuclear energy,1 solar energy,2,3 hydrogen energy,4,5etc. Among these candidates, hydrogen has taken the lead in the past several decades from the standpoint of the recognized “hydrogen energy economy”,6–8 owing to its abundant content, environmentally benign products of oxidation (water), high energy density (142 MJ kg−1) and so on. At present, establishing affordable, safe and convenient hydrogen production systems remains a major obstacle to the transition of the world from the current hydrocarbon economy towards a “hydrogen economy”. Various solutions for hydrogen supply, such as photocatalysis,9 biomass conversion,10 and water splitting by electrolysis,11 have been in the limelight for the last few decades, but there has been a lack of feasible methods until now. Compared to the above strategies, hydrogen generation from hydrolysis12,13 (NaBH4, for example) exhibits numerous advantages such as low operation temperature, environmentally benign by-products, well-controlled hydrogen release and high-purity hydrogen, making it promising for realizing uninterrupted and rate-controlled hydrogen supply, e.g., portable polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).
During the hydrolysis process, some typical materials, including metals,14,15 metal hydrides,16,17 chemical hydrides,18,19etc., can release high-purity H2via reacting with water without an external heat input. Slightly humid hydrogen can be transferred directly into PEMFCs without dehumidification treatment.20 Nevertheless, stable and cost-effective hydrogen production systems are in great need to enable uninterrupted energy power supply of PEMFCs, if the hydrolysis processes are on the basis of the above two hydrides. Chemical hydrides, such as LiBH4,21,22 LiAlH4,23,24 NaBH4,25,26 Mg(BH4)227,28 and Ca(BH4)2,29,30 are in particular expensive one-pass consumables. Besides, efficient and mature regeneration methods for chemical hydrides are still lacking, though they do exhibit a desirable hydrogen yield. For example, NaBH4 could release over 2440 mL g−1 H2 within 2.4 min in the presence of CoCl2.25 However, the difficulty lies in the hydrogen regeneration of spent NaBH4 and the resulting fancy price has become the bottleneck of its commercial viability as an off- or on-board hydrogen carrier. Moreover, the addition of catalysts into hydrides would increase the dead weight, and complicate the recycling process. On the other hand, the hydrolysis of light metals and their hydrides has also been investigated widely, because of their outstanding advantages such as low-cost, abundant element content, and nonpoisonous products of oxidation. Nevertheless, these materials, including Al,31 Mg,32 MgH2,13etc., are unable to satisfy the requirements for the fuel cell-based vehicle practical applications due to their poor kinetics and low hydrogen yields. Noticeably, the poor hydrolysis performance of Mg-based light metals has been recognized as due to the rapidly interrupted hydrolysis reaction of Mg or MgH2 by a passive Mg(OH)2 layer deposited on the surface of Mg-based materials. Accordingly, several methods, e.g., ball milling,33 alloying,34 changing the aqueous solution35 and catalyst doping,36 have been developed to overcome these drawbacks. In particular, it has been suggested that achieving nanostructured Mg-based light metals with a small particle size by mechanical ball milling can result in the enhancement of their hydrolysis properties with high yield and fast kinetics. For instance, Tessier and co-works37 reported that the MgH2–20.3 mol% CaH2 composite milled for 10 h exhibited superb hydrolysis performance with a hydrogen yield of 80% conversion in 30 min, meaning that CaH2 could remarkably facilitate the hydrolysis process of MgH2. However, the highly active CaH2 and the difficulty existing in the preparation of CaH2 and MgH2 would result in relatively high cost for the fabrication of MgH2–CaH2 composites. Therefore, an uncomplicated and affordable method for batch preparation of Mg-based materials with superior hydrogen generation performance is in great need, realizing their wide applications in off- or on-board hydrogen energy areas.
Herein, CaMg2-based materials fabricated by a super facile method, namely single-step ball milling, for hydrogen supply in pure water have been investigated in this manuscript. With respect to the as-melted counterparts, it is found that ball-milled CaMg2 and H-CaMg2-based samples can significantly enhance the hydrolysis performances by adjusting the ball milling durations. Moreover, our previous studies38 revealed that the addition of Ni could promote the dissociation of H2, thus resulting in more favorable hydrogenation of the Ca–Mg alloy at room temperature, compared to that of pure CaMg2 at 450 °C.39 However, the boiling point of Mg is much lower than that of Ni, which might increase the difficulty in the synthesis of Ca–Mg–Ni ternary alloys through conventional induction melting. Therefore, the CaMg2–0.1Ni hydrides are also prepared by ball milling the mixture of CaMg2 and Ni in a backpressure of H2 and its hydrolysis behaviors have been studied. The results indicate that doping of Ni in CaMg2 could accelerate its hydriding process, thus delivering enhanced hydrogen evolution behaviors, as opposed to a limited promotion of the hydrolysis of CaMg2 without hydrogenation treatment. In particular, considering the hydrogen absorption of Ca–Mg–Ni compounds at room temperature, it may be promising to recycle waste hydrogen from the oil industry or automobile exhausts and further lower the cost of MgH2–CaH2 composites. In addition, the hydrolysis mechanism of CaMg2-based materials has also been discussed in this manuscript.
Experimental section
Reagent and sample preparation
The high-purity Mg (≥99.9%), Ca (≥95%) and Ni (≥99.9%) materials were used as source materials. The CaMg2 alloy was synthesized by the sealed tube smelting process, i.e., putting an argon-filled pure iron pipe loaded with pure Mg and Ca into a resistance furnace maintained at 900 °C for 20 h. The as-melted CaMg2 ingots were initially polished with fine-grit sandpaper to remove the surface oxide layer, and then smashed into small particles and finally filtered through a 200-mesh sieve. The CaMg2–0.1Ni composite was successfully prepared via ball milling a mixture of the above CaMg2 powder and Ni with a 10:1 atomic ratio on a QM-SP4 planetary miller, and the rotating speed was determined to be 400 rpm. Furthermore, CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni composites were successfully hydrogenated through the ball milling process under a 3 MPa H2 atmosphere. All samples were handled and transferred in an argon atmosphere glove-box (Mikrouna, China) equipped with a recirculation and regeneration system, which was maintained under an argon atmosphere with <0.1 ppm O2 and H2O vapor.
Characterization
The phase structure of samples was acquired by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical EMPYREAN) at room temperature using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 over a range of diffraction angles (2θ) from 10° to 90° with Cu-Kα radiation (45 kV, 40 mA) at a scanning rate of 0.02° s−1. The morphologies of the samples were observed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss, Supra-40, Germany) and the chemical composition of the as-prepared alloys was determined by using an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) accessory attached to the SEM.
Hydrogen generation measurements
The hydrogen evolution measurements were conducted in a homemade device. During a typical hydrolysis experiment, 0.1–0.2 g of reactant was placed in a 50 mL sealed three-necked Pyrex flask fitted with an outlet tube for collecting the evolved H2 gas. The flask was immersed in a low-temperature stirring reaction bath to maintain a certain temperature. The hydrogen generation was exhausted through a Tygon tube and passed through a Monteggia washing bottle, in which water was extracted into a beaker put on an electronic scale that was used for recording the weight changes over time. Therefore, all the hydrogen release rates and yields could be determined from the reaction time and hydrogen volume, which was obtained and analyzed by using a computer. Moreover, the hydrolysates were exsiccated in an electrothermal blowing drying oven at 60 °C for 5 h.
Results and discussion
Tailoring hydrolysis properties of CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni composites via ball milling
As shown in Fig. 1a, the particle size of the sieving 200-mesh Ca–Mg alloy ranges from 10 to 50 μm. Its chemical composition consists of 59.7 at% Mg and 33.1 at% Ca, determined by EDX analysis (Fig. 1b), which is referred to as the CaMg2 intermetallic compound. The diffraction peaks of the as-prepared CaMg2 alloy are in good agreement with those in the standard PDF card shown in Fig. 1c, implying that high-purity of as-melted CaMg2 is composed of C14 Laves phases. Based on the fragility and pulverization of the Mg–Ca intermetallic compound, mechanical milling was adopted to refine the particle and grain size for tuning the hydrolysis properties of CaMg2-based alloys. XRD measurements demonstrate that the peak intensities of the CaMg2 alloy are significantly weakened as shown in Fig. 2a, accompanied by an obvious increment in the FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum), when ball milling time is gradually prolonged from 0.5 to 5 h, indicating the reduction of the grain size over the CaMg2 alloy. Fig. 2b presents the XRD patterns of the products after ball milling the mixture of CaMg2 and Ni with a 10:1 atomic ratio for durations from 0 to 5 h. The main diffraction peaks of all ball-milled samples remain the same as those in raw materials, whereas the relative peak intensities of CaMg2 decrease. Even if the milling time increases to 10 h, there is no mechanical alloying between CaMg2 and the Ni element (Fig. S1†). The results indicate that CaMg2–0.1Ni synthesized by this method consists of two individual phases, i.e., CaMg2 and Ni. Subsequently, non-catalytic hydrolysis behaviors of CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni with various milling durations were evaluated in deionized water at room temperature (about 300 K), respectively, as shown by the hydrogen generation plots in Fig. 2c and d. Fig. 2c shows that the hydrogen yield of the sieving 200-mesh CaMg2 is 458 mL g−1 H2 in 120 min with a conversion rate of 55.2%. Noticeably, the 0.5 h-milled CaMg2 alloy exhibits enhanced hydrolysis properties, of which the solid–liquid system could release 539 mL g−1 H2 in 120 min with a conversion rate of 65.0%. Nevertheless, the hydrolysis kinetics becomes more and more sluggish with the ramping ball-milling time. The 1.5 h-milled sample delivers a hydrogen yield of 497 mL g−1 H2 within 90 min, of which the kinetics is slightly worse over the 0.5 h-milled one though the final conversion is up to 67.7%. More specifically, the hydrolysis properties of CaMg2 deteriorate dramatically with the ball-milling time over 1.5 h. The conversion rate of 3 h- and 5 h-milled samples is reduced to 28.4% and 11.8%, respectively. It may be ascribed to the agglomeration of CaMg2 after long time ball-milling as shown in Fig. S2,† resulting in decreased reaction channels.

Similarly, the hydrolysis properties of the ball-milled CaMg2–0.1Ni composite agree well with the results of the CaMg2 alloy. As shown in Fig. 2d, the 0.5 h- and 1.5 h-milled CaMg2–0.1Ni could release 509 mL g−1 and 494 mL g−1 H2 in 120 min with a final conversion rate of 65.6% and 63.5%, respectively. As the milling time is prolonged to 3 h and 5 h, the corresponding conversion rate was 41.4% and 17.2%, slightly higher than the values for CaMg2 under the same conditions. The results indicate that Ni has a very limited promotion upon proceeding of the hydrolysis of the CaMg2 alloy. As shown in Fig. 2e, the optimal kinetics of CaMg2–0.1Ni is pretty much the same as that of the Ni-free sample, whereas the final hydrogen yield is slightly lower because the Ni element itself could not participate in the hydrogen releasing process during hydrolysis.
Hydrolysis kinetics and reaction activation energy of ball-milled CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni composites
To determine the exact kinetics of CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni, the hydrolysis behaviors of 0.5 h-milled samples with optimal hydrogen properties are chosen as the model samples to be further investigated, as shown by their hydrogen generation curves at various temperatures in Fig. 3. The results indicate that both the hydrogen release rate and yield increase significantly with the ramping reaction temperature. For the CaMg2 sample, the hydrogen yield increases from 434 to 575, 704, and 744 mL g−1 H2 in 60 min as the reaction temperature rises from 28 to 60 °C (Fig. 3a). When the reaction time is prolonged to 120 min, the final conversion rate would reach 94.0% at 60 °C. With respect to the 0.5 h-milled CaMg2–0.1Ni composite, the H2 yield increases from 407 to 523, 652, and 728 mL g−1 in 60 min when the reaction temperature varies from 28 to 60 °C, delivering a conversion value from 52.4 to 67.0, 83.7, and 93.5%, respectively. Moreover, the ultimate conversion rate may increase from 65.6% at 28 °C to 98.5% at 60 °C, indicating that the hydrogen yield is positively correlated with the temperature. In particular, it could release a hydrogen yield of 766 mL g−1 H2 within 120 min at 60 °C (close to the theoretical amount of hydrogen release, as shown in Fig. 3b), which is slightly better than the one for CaMg2 under the same conditions.

The hydrogen kinetic mechanisms for the hydrolysis of CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni composites can be analysed by using the Avrami–Erofeev equation,16,40 which is expressed as follows: α(t) = 1 − exp(−k × tm)(1)where α(t) is the reaction rate representing the ratio of the reacted material to total material, k is the reaction rate constant, m is the Avrami constant and t is the reaction time, respectively. Two sets of values of k and m of CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni composites can be respectively obtained by fitting their hydrolysis reaction rate vs time curves at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3c and e indicate that the correlation factor (R2) values are >0.99, signifying that the experimental curves are well fitted to the Avrami–Erofeev equation (eqn (1)). According to the classic Arrhenius equation,12,41 on the other hand, the reaction rate constant k could be described as the following equation: (2)where A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the apparent reaction activation energy (J mol−1), R is a universal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1) and T is the absolute temperature (K). If doing the logarithm on the two sides, eqn (2) can also be written as: (3)
Based on eqn (3), the apparent reaction energies can be obtained from the slopes of the fitted line in Fig. 3d–f. The apparent reaction activation energy Ea values of the CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni composites are calculated to be 23.8 kJ mol−1 and 23.1 kJ mol−1 H2, respectively, which are much lower than that of MgH2 (58.1 kJ mol−1 H2) hydrolysis in pure water.35 Noticeably, the obviously lower apparent reaction activation energies of ball-milled CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni composites indicate the higher hydrolysis reaction activities than that of MgH2 in pure water.
Hydrolysis performances of hydrogenated CaMg2-based materials via ball milling
Though the hydrolysis properties of the above CaMg2-based materials have been enhanced via ball milling, their conversion rates are still relatively low under moderate conditions. It is worth noting that metal hydrides could not only release the intrinsic hydrogen stored in itself, but also liberate the hydrogen from water while reacting with water, resulting in twice as much hydrogen yield as the counterpart metals.16 Thus, hydrogenation ball milling is conducted to tailor both the hydrolysis kinetics and hydrogen yield of CaMg2-based materials in the present work.

Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of H-CaMg2 and H-CaMg2–0.1Ni milled under a H2 atmosphere for 0.5 h, 1.5 h, and 3 h, respectively. Fig. 4a shows that the diffraction peaks of Mg and CaH2 begin to appear in both 0.5 h-milled H-CaMg2 and H-CaMg2–0.1Ni samples, whereas the peaks of CaMg2 are still strong after this milling duration. Compared to 0.5 h-milled H-CaMg2, the 0.5 h-milled H-CaMg2–0.1Ni sample exhibits stronger CaH2 diffraction peaks and weaker CaMg2 diffraction peaks, as well as obvious diffraction peaks of Ni, implying that Ni could promote the proceeding of hydrogenation of H-CaMg2via ball milling. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks of Mg and CaH2 are predominantly developed while the original CaMg2 phase nearly disappears in the H-CaMg2 sample when the ball-milling duration is prolonged to 1.5 h, as indicated in Fig. 4b. For the 1.5 h H-CaMg2–0.1Ni sample, the original CaMg2 phase is even absolutely replaced by Mg and hydride phases of Ca–Mg. When the milling duration time is up to 3 h, more specifically, the hydrogenation proceeding for fabricating the H-CaMg2–0.1Ni sample is nearly completed and the peaks of Mg are extremely weak, as shown in Fig. 4c. Under the same conditions, the products of the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 sample are composed of several phases, i.e., Mg, CaH2, and Ca5Mg9H28 (H-CaMg2 composites for short). According to the above results of XRD experiments, therefore, the hydrogenation steps of CaMg2 could be given as follows: CaMg2 + H2 → CaH2 + 2Mg(4) 5CaH2 + 9Mg + 9H2 → Ca5Mg9H28(5)
 Fig. 4  X-ray diffraction patterns of H-CaMg2 and H-CaMg2–0.1Ni ball-milled for (a) 0.5 h, (b) 1.5 h, and (c) 3 h. 

Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen evolution profiles of the as-milled H-CaMg2 and H-CaMg2–0.1Ni composites with various milling durations at room temperature. When the ball milling durations are 0.5 h and 1.5 h, the corresponding milled H-CaMg2–0.1Ni composites always exhibit an apparently faster hydrogen generation rate and higher hydrogen yield than H-CaMg2 (as shown in Fig. 5a and b). It may be the catalytic effect of Ni towards the dissociation of H2 during the hydrogenated process,42 resulting in more sufficient hydrogenation than Ni-free samples. For example, the 0.5 h-milled CaMg2–0.1Ni hydrides could release 853 mL g−1 H2 within 5 min in deionized water, and the hydrogen yield reached 1057 mL g−1 in 30 min, higher than the value (951 mL g−1) of H-CaMg2 under the same conditions. Both the 1.5 h-milled H-CaMg2–0.1Ni and H-CaMg2 composites present better hydrolysis properties compared to those for 0.5 h-milled products. The 1.5 h-milled H-CaMg2–0.1Ni composites could produce nearly 1147 mL g−1 H2 in 5 min and it is fully hydrolyzed within 10 min with a hydrogen yield of 1160 mL g−1 H2. However, 1.5 h-milled H-CaMg2 completes the hydrolysis reaction after at least 20 min, of which the terminal hydrogen yield is 1093 mL g−1 H2. Besides, the hydrogen evolution profiles for hydrolysis of CaMg2-based hydrides milled for 3 h are shown in Fig. 5c; both of them show superior hydrogen supply capacities. In particular, the hydrolysis of 3h-milled H-CaMg2 and H-CaMg2–0.1Ni composites can be completed within 3 min, in which the former could release 1439 mL g−1 H2 while the latter merely has a hydrogen yield of 1275 mL g−1 H2. Fig. 5d summarizes the hydrogen yields in 1 min of H-CaMg2 and H-CaMg2–0.1Ni composites after milling for different durations. Compared to H-CaMg2 with the same milling durations, the hydrogen generation rate and hydrogen yield in 0.5 h- and 1.5 h-milled H-CaMg2–0.1Ni composites are enhanced by introducing Ni, but accompanied by a slight reduction in hydrogen yield in 3 h-milled H-CaMg2–0.1Ni. It may be ascribed to the intrinsic endothermic trait of Ni that results in the difficulty in further hydrogenation with continuously increasing the milling duration.43 Therefore, the theoretical hydrogen-storage capacity of H-CaMg2–0.1Ni is reduced to some certain extent, delivering a lower hydrogen yield for hydrolysis than the Ni-free one. It is noted that both hydrogenation percentages of 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 and H-CaMg2–0.1Ni composites are over 90%. Assuming the hydrogen absorption of CaMg2 at an atomic ratio of 2:1 in H/M, the gravimetric hydrogen density could reach 6.3 wt% with a theoretical hydrolysis hydrogen yield of 1554 mL g−1 H2. In this way, the hydrogenation percentage of 3 h-milled CaMg2 is up to 93% according to a hydrogen yield of 1439 mL g−1 H2.

Hydrolysis kinetics properties of H-CaMg2 with varied ball milling durations
Given the limitations of practical hydrogen supply in various regions and seasons, effective hydrogen generation systems with good hydrolysis properties below room temperature are in great need for PEMFCs. Herein, the hydrolysis performance of H-CaMg2 composites obtained from the CaMg2 alloy after milling for different durations is investigated. Fig. 6a shows the hydrogen generation plots via hydrolysis of the 1.5 h-milled H-CaMg2 composites at the temperatures of from 0 °C, 15 °C and 25 °C. The 1.5 h-milled products exhibit considerable hydrolytic properties at room temperature, of which the hydrogen yield is 1063 mL g−1 H2 within only 10 min and the final yield is 1102 mL g−1 H2. As the reaction temperature decreases, both the hydrogen generation rate and hydrogen yield present an obvious reduction. Unlike the above results, the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 composite showed an almost equivalent hydrogen yield at the temperature ranging from 0 to 25 °C, though the initial hydrogen generation rate is slowed down by the dropping temperature (As shown in Fig. 6b). Finally, the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 samples liberate 1322, 1360, and 1372 mL g−1 of H2 within 15 min with the reaction temperature ramping from 0 to 25 °C. Their conversion rates increase from 93.7% at 0 °C to 95.7% at 15 °C, and 96.6% at 25 °C in 10 min, which exhibit better hydrolysis kinetics in comparison with the values ranging from 18.8% to 58.4%, and 88.6% of the 1.5 h-milled H-CaMg2 composites under the same conditions. The reason may be related to the higher hydrogenation degree of 3 h-milled H-CaMg2, and the ball-milled products are mainly composed of CaH2 and Ca5Mg9H28 (Fig. 4c). Overall, the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 composites demonstrate superior hydrolysis performance either at room temperature or under cryogenic conditions.

Nevertheless, the 0.5 h milled H-CaMg2 sample shows sluggish hydrolysis dynamics even at room temperature. The temperature-dependent hydrogen generation curves of 0.5 h milled H-CaMg2 are shown in Fig. 6c, in which the hydrogen yield varied from 754 to 927, and 986 mL g−1 H2 in 10 min in higher temperatures ranges of 25, 35, and 45 °C, respectively. Fig. 6d presents that the degree of hydrolysis increases with the jumping temperature and the value is up to 91.6% within 10 min at 45 °C. While the reaction time prolongs to 30 min, the hydrogen yield reaches 951, 985, and 1076 mL g−1 H2 at 25, 35, and 45 °C, respectively. The relatively poor kinetics of the 0.5 h-milled H-CaMg2 compared to those for 1.5 h- and 3 h-counterparts could be assigned to the lower hydrogenation of the H-CaMg2 composite, in which the major phase is CaMg2 coupled with minor CaH2 and Mg.
The hydrogen generation profiles via the hydrolysis in the pure water of the 0.5-, 1.5-, and 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 composites at various temperatures are respectively plotted and fitted based on Avrami–Erofeev equation (1) in Fig. 7a–c. The correlation coefficient (R2) values are close to 1, indicating that the experimental curves can be well fitted by the Avrami–Erofeev equation. Correspondingly, the Arrhenius plots of ln k versus the reciprocal of absolute temperature (1000/T) for these samples are shown in Fig. 7d, obtained from simulation towards the hydrolysis curves of the H-CaMg2 composites. From the slope of the fitted lines, the apparent activation energies of 0.5 h-, 1.5 h-, and 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 composites are determined to be 39.2, 53.6, and 40.2 kJ mol−1, respectively.

In comparison with previously reported metals or metal hydrides, non-catalytic hydrolysis of CaMg2–0.1Ni exhibits a high energy efficiency, of which the conversion rate may reach 98.5% with a hydrogen yield of 766 mL g−1 H2 in 2 h at 60 °C, as seen in Fig. 3b and Table 1. In addition, hydrogenation ball milling has been carried out to further enhance the hydrolysis properties of CaMg2-based materials for achieving high-efficiency and rate-controlled hydrogen supply to fuel cell-based vehicle applications. The hydrogen yield of H-CaMg2 materials increases from 485 mL g−1 H2 in 0.5 h-milled H-CaMg2 to 1439 mL g−1 H2 in 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 within 3 min (Fig. 5). This value (1439 mL g−1 H2) is much higher than those from references listed in Table 1. Significantly, the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 composite demonstrates superior cryogenic hydrolysis properties, of which the hydrogen yields may exceed 1300 mL g−1 H2 within 15 min as the reaction temperature ramps from 0 to 25 °C.

Analysis of hydrolysis products of milled CaMg2-based materials
The morphologies of the milled CaMg2-based composites and their hydrolysis by-products were observed by SEM as shown in Fig. 8a–d. Fig. 8a shows the SEM image of the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 composite that consists of micron and nanoscale particles agglomerated together in size of 5–10 μm, and plenty of cracks exist. In the hydrolytic process, these cracks would supply considerable channels for water molecules; thus the large particles collapse into well-dispersed small ones, as shown by the SEM image of the hydrolysis by-product of 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 in Fig. 8b. Fig. 8c shows the SEM image of 3 h-milled CaMg2 before hydrolysis, with the particle size approximately 1–3 μm. Afterward, the surface morphologies of the hydrolysis by-products of 3 h-milled CaMg2 became fluffy and coarse, as shown in Fig. 8c, implying that the hydrolysis reaction of CaMg2 could be considered as a corrosion process. According to the XRD profiles for the hydrolyzates of CaMg2 and CaMg2–0.1Ni (Fig. 8e), the major diffraction peaks are indexed to Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2. Besides, partial diffraction peaks of CaCO3 are observed in both XRD patterns of CaMg2-based composites, accompanied by a minor phase of Ni in CaMg2–0.1Ni. The formation of CaCO3 could be ascribed to the absorption of Ca(OH)2 towards CO2 in the air during drying proceeding. Thus, the hydrolysis reaction of CaMg2-based alloys could be expressed as: CaMg2 + 6H2O → Ca(OH)2 + 2Mg(OH)2 + 3H2(6)
 Fig. 8  SEM images of the (a) 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 composite before hydrolysis, (b) hydrolysis by-product of 3 h-milled H-CaMg2, (c) 3 h-milled CaMg2 alloy, and (d) its hydrolysis product. XRD patterns of the by-products of the (e) CaMg2 alloy and CaMg2–0.1Ni composite milled for 0.5 h, and (f) H-CaMg2 composite milled for 3 h. 
On the other hand, the main phases for the hydrolysis by-product of the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 composite remain unchanged (Fig. 8f), which are also assigned to Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 as well as CaCO3. Therefore, the hydrolysis reactions of the H-CaMg2 composite can be described as follows: CaH2 + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2(7) Ca5Mg9H28 + 28H2O → 5Ca(OH)2 + 9Mg(OH)2 + 28H2(8)
Noticeably, the hydrolysis by-products, e.g., Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2, could turn back to the CaMg2 alloy via sintering or electrolysis by external energy such as wind energy, solar energy or nuclear energy. In this closed material cycle, a pollution-free, zero-emission and sustainable hydrogen supply system for on-site hydrogen energy fields may be promising in the near future.
Conclusions
In summary, non-catalytic hydrolysis behaviors of CaMg2-based materials via ball milling have been comprehensively investigated in this manuscript. It is found that the 0.5 h-milled CaMg2 alloy shows an optimal hydrogen yield of 539 mL g−1 H2 in 120 min at room temperature. Besides, the hydrogenated H-CaMg2-based composite can also be acquired from hydrogenation ball milling, and it exhibits excellent hydrogen generation properties, of which the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 could release optimal 1439 mL g−1 of H2 within only 3 min at 28 °C. Furthermore, it is interestingly found that the hydrogen uptake of CaMg2 can be accelerated by doping with a minor Ni element, thus delivering obviously enhanced hydrolytic dynamics, as opposed to a limited promotion of the hydrolysis of CaMg2. In particular, the hydrogen yields of H-CaMg2–0.1Ni composites increase from 853 mL g−1 H2 to 1147 mL g−1 H2 in 5 min as the milling time varied from 0.5 h to 1.5 h, much higher than the values (598 mL g−1 H2 and 954 mL g−1 H2) of H-CaMg2 under the same conditions. More significantly, the 3 h-milled H-CaMg2 composite demonstrates superior cryogenic hydrolysis properties, achieving a hydrogen yield of 1332 mL g−1 H2 in 15 min at 0 °C. Considering the intrinsic trait of hydrogen absorption of the Ca–Mg–Ni compounds at room temperature, it may be possible to recycle some typical waste hydrogen, such as from the oil industry or automobile exhausts, thus establishing an affordable and high-efficiency MgH2–CaH2 composite system with excellent hydrogen supply abilities. Our results demonstrate that CaMg2-based materials prepared by the ball milling method offer a promising prospect as off-/on-board hydrogen supply carriers, even in winter or subzero areas.
