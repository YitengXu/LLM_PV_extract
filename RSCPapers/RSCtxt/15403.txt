    , Accepted 7th November 2019First published on 7th November 2019AbstractConventional solar cell efficiency is usually limited by the Shockley–Queisser limit. This is not the case, however, for ferroelectric materials, which present spontaneous electric polarization that is responsible for their bulk photovoltaic effect. Even so, most ferroelectric oxides exhibit large band gaps, reducing the amount of solar energy that can be harvested. In this work, a high-throughput approach to tune the electronic properties of thin-film ferroelectric oxides is presented. Materials databases were systematically used to find substrates for the epitaxial growth of KNbO3 thin films, using topological and stability filters. Interface models were built and their electronic and optical properties were predicted. Strain and substrate–thin-film band interaction effects were examined in detail, in order to understand the interaction between both materials. We found substrates that significantly reduce the KNbO3 band gap, maintain KNbO3 polarization, and potentially present the right band alignment, favoring electron injection in the substrate/electrode. This methodology can be easily applied to other ferroelectric oxides, optimizing their band gaps and accelerating the development of new ferroelectric-based solar cells.
1 Introduction
Solar energy is the most abundant source of clean and renewable energy with photovoltaics, PVs, being the most promising technology in the coming decades. However, to make this technology competitive, significant improvements must be made in the efficiency of the solar cells and manufacturing costs must be reduced. PV device performance depends on three main features: (i) efficient light absorption, (ii) effective charge separation and (iii) fast transport and charge extraction. Conventional solar cells based on p–n junctions and other new solar cell generations are good light harvesters, but they are limited by the Shockley–Queisser limit, because carriers are separated by the internal electric field at the p–n junction.1 This is not the case for ferroelectric materials, which present spontaneous electric polarization, providing an alternative way to separate excited carriers.2 This charge separation, due to the polarization in the bulk of the material, is called the bulk photovoltaic effect, BPVE,3,4 and has attracted the attention of the scientific community to ferroelectric materials as candidates to design new and more efficient PV devices.5,6
Oxide perovskites, organic–inorganic perovskites — also known as hybrid halide perovskites — and, more recently, chalcohalides are the ferroelectric materials used for solar energy conversion.7 Hybrid perovskite thin-films such as CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3, have changed the solar cell paradigm in the last decade because of their low cost and high efficiency.8–10 However, there is some debate about their ferroelectric nature.11,12 Chalcohalides such as SbSI are abundant and also good solar absorbers,13 but they usually have a small enthalpy difference between the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases and smaller polarization than many oxide perovskites.7 Ferroelectric oxide perovskites, ABO3, combine strong spontaneous electric polarization with a wide range of thermal, chemical and mechanical stabilities.14,15 Moreover, the availability of low-cost methods for their synthesis and device fabrication makes them very attractive from an economic point of view, too. This is the reason why the power conversion efficiency, PCE, of solar cells based on these materials has rapidly grown from 0.28% to 8.1% in less than seven years.16,17
Ferroelectric oxide perovskites also present hindrances that will need to be overcome to design efficient PV devices. The wide band gap of these materials remains as the main obstacle to achieve a higher PCE. Reducing the band gap from 2–3 eV to 1.5 eV, the maximum emission of the solar spectrum is the main goal. Different strategies have been proposed to tune the electronic properties of these oxides.18 For instance, perovskite band gaps are reduced as much as 1.2 eV via polarization rotation through rhombohedral-to-tetragonal structural transition.19 Doping of the A and B sites has also been identified as a valid approach to modify the gap of oxide perovskites.20–27 As an alternative to chemical modifications, strain effects on ferroelectric thin-films have been proposed as an effective method to customize their properties.28
Strain engineering of thin-films is a frequently applied route to enhance material properties. Systems under strain have demonstrated that it is even possible to combine, in principle, incompatible properties such as ferroelectricity and band topology.29 In the case of perovskite thin-films, the strain is usually controlled through their epitaxial growth on a substrate with a specific lattice mismatch.30 Then, substrates play a dual role in solar cells: (i) tuning the electronic properties of the ferroelectric material and (ii) acting as one of the electrodes of the solar cell. Although some encouraging results have been obtained during recent years31,32 and new techniques have been introduced to modify the strain of ferroelectric materials,33–36 the limited number of available substrates hampers the tunability of ferroelectric thin-films. Moreover, the search for an optimal substrate for a specific ferroelectric thin-film requires the analysis of not only structural but also electronic properties of both materials at their interface. This time- and resource-consuming task cannot be tackled by experimental trial-and-error approaches, so data-driven and theory-driven frameworks need to be developed to accelerate this device design.
In this article, we propose a novel high-throughput search for substrates for oxide perovskite thin-films in order to design ferroelectric-based solar cell devices. One of the most studied oxide perovskites, KNbO3,14,21,23,37–40 was selected as proof of concept due to its simple and low-cost synthesis in epitaxial thin-films.41–45 Material databases are automatically screened for potential substrates in which the epitaxial growth of strained KNbO3 thin-films is possible. Then, the electronic properties of the interfaces, including band bending models, are explored to evaluate band gap modifications of KNbO3 and its interaction with the electrode.
2 Methodology
2.1 High-throughput substrate search
The Materials Project, MP, database was used to find potential substrates for the epitaxial growth of KNbO3 through its Materials Application Programming Interface, MAPI.46 This search includes semiconductors and insulators that belong to different structural prototypes such as diamond, zincblende, rock salt, fluorite, wurtzite, and anatase. Energy above the hull, Ehull, of each material was used as a descriptor of its thermodynamic stability and synthesizability, considering only materials whose Ehull < 0.1 eV per atom. Slab models were built taking into account the most stable planes and the Wulff construction of each prototype (Table 1).

2.2 Lattice mismatch and surface models
The lattice mismatch between two surfaces was measured using an algorithm based on the Zur and McGill approach.56 This algorithm is available in New Materials Lab repository at GitHub and Zenodo.57 The primitive surface cells of the substrate and the thin-film are the only required inputs to evaluate their commensurability. In order to determine if 2D lattices match, we have to find if each of them possesses a superlattice where their area, A, surface lattice vectors, a–b, and surface angle between a and b, α, are the same. If the substrate and the thin-film have primitive surface cell areas Asub and Atf respectively, their superlattice surface areas are nsubAsub and ntfAtf where nsub and ntf are integer numbers. When both superlattices present the same area, (1)
However, it is very unlikely that both lattices will match exactly. A user parameter defining the maximum percentage error between both areas, εA, has been included to limit the search of nsub and ntf pairs, (2)
Similarly, an upper limit on the possible nsub and ntf values is introduced to limit the size of the interface models. This maximum area, Amax, is defined as Amax > nsubAsub,(3)and Amax > ntfAtf.(4)
Once a list of compatible nsub and ntf pairs that fulfill eqn (2)–(4) is created, all possible superlattice surfaces58 with an area of nsubAsub and ntfAtf are compared (Fig. 1 and the ESI†).
The superlattice surface vectors, u and v, of both surfaces are compared, selecting only the interfaces in which the mismatch between vectors and angles is below the thresholds defined by the user. The error associated with the vector misfit is defined as (5)and that for the angle misfit is defined as (6)where u = |u| and  Because more than one superlattice combination can fulfil all the conditions, only the system with the minimal coincident interface area, MCIA,59 is selected to build an atomistic model.
Ferroelectric oxides are brittle and tend to crack under low compressive or tensile strains.60,61 However, their thin-films present much better mechanical strength. Interfaces such as BiFeO3/YAlO3 have been reported with biaxial strains up to 6%.62,63 Additionally, large lattice mismatch can lead to a high concentration of defects at the interface in order to reduce the strain between the substrate and the thin films. The formation of these defects also depends on the experimental conditions and modifies or even suppresses the ferroelectric behavior of the material.64 For this reason, all the interfaces presented in this work have been built considering moderate misfits between the slabs (εA < 15%, εu < 5%, and εα < 5%) and reducing the atomistic models below 250 atoms (Amax = 100 Å2).
2.3 Computational details
All structures were relaxed using the VASP code65–67 with the projector-augmented wave, PAW, method.68,69 Energies were obtained using the generalized gradient approximation, GGA, proposed by Perdew et al.70 and a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff of 500 eV. The number of valence electrons and the Hubbard-like term for each atom were selected following standards proposed by Calderon et al.71 For the high-throughput screening, DFT+U calculations were performed according to Dudarev formalism, using a single Ueff parameter (Ueff = U − J).72 The HSE hybrid functional73,74 was used only for specific cases in which a more accurate prediction of the band gap was needed. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a k-point mesh of 5000 k-points per reciprocal atom. Hellmann–Feynman theorem was used to calculate the forces over the ions, including Harris-Foulkes corrections.75 Dipole corrections to the potential, forces and the total energy were applied in order to eliminate spurious interactions caused by the periodic slab images.76,77 Wave-function was converged when the energy difference between two consecutive SCF steps was smaller than 10−6 eV and 10−8 eV for geometry optimizations and density of states, DOS, single-point calculations respectively. Geometries were considered optimized when forces acting over each atom were below 10−3 eV Å−1. Optical spectra were simulated using the imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric function, ε2(ω), as proposed by Gajdoš et al.78 Polarization perpendicular to the surface, Pz, was calculated in the KNbO3 film as79–81 (7)where Ω is the volume of the KNbO3 film, N is the number of cations in the film and δzi is the relative displacement in z between the cations, K/Nb, and the anions, O, located in the same plane parallel to the surface.  is the component of the Born effective charges perpendicular to the surface plane using density-functional perturbation theory.78,82 This approach only considers the polarization due to atom displacements with respect to their centrosymmetric positions, but it is accurate enough to predict the KNbO3 bulk P, 35 μC cm−2, compared to experimental values, 37–41 μC cm−2.37,83,84
3 Results
3.1 Strain effects
The modifications of the electronic structure of KNbO3 bulk and surfaces by mechanical strain were studied before building models with the substrate–thin-film interface. Using this approach, it is possible to differentiate the effects that stem from substrate–thin-film interactions or only from the strain. Here, it is worth noting that the KNbO3 (001) facet is a polar surface in which there is an alternation of positively charged NbO2 and negatively charged KO layers. This bilayer acts as a capacitor creating a dipole moment, μ. The total dipole moment depends on the number of bilayers of the surface, N. When N → ∞, μ and the electrostatic contribution to the surface energy diverge, which is the origin of the surface instability also called “polar catastrophe”.85,86 Classically, two distinct regimes are considered for polar surfaces: (i) the low thickness regime, in which polarization is sustained without surface reconstruction and (ii) the high thickness regime, in which polarity needs to be compensated through surface reconstruction.86 A two-layer KNbO3 thin-film model will be used to simulate ultra-thin-films (low thickness regime) in this section and for interface screening. However, surface reconstruction will be modelled for the most interesting cases.
Different exchange-correlation functionals were used previously in the study of tetragonal KNbO3 (Table S1, ESI†).20,87,88 While all of them describe the lattice parameters reasonably well, there are quantitative differences between the predicted band gaps. LDA predicts an indirect band gap, Eg, around 1.40 eV and 1.50 eV;20,87 however, experimental values are reported between 3.08 eV and 3.30 eV.89,90 The use of hybrid functionals guarantees some improvement but their results are sensitive to the amount of HF exchange. For instance, there is a 0.68 eV difference between the gap predicted with HSE06 using a 30% of exact exchange (3.23 eV)88 and standard HSE06 (2.55 eV).20 Initially, we have opted for a PBE+U functional that improves the band gap values obtained with LDA, but it is not as computationally demanding as hybrid functionals. Because of the derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy,91 this approach will not quantitatively reproduce experimental band gaps. However, it has been proven to obtain good qualitative results for band gaps and quantitative accuracy for other properties such as geometry, thermodynamic stability or polarization.92 The HSE hybrid functional will be used later for specific cases in which a more accurate prediction of the band gap was needed. Band gap values for strained bulk structures are depicted in Fig. 2 between −5% and 5% misfit with respect to the equilibrium lattice parameter, a. The band gap is modified in a range of 0.47 eV from 1.88 eV at −5% strain to 1.41 eV at 5% strain. A very similar trend was found for the 2 layer KNbO3 thin-film, where Eg ranges between 1.64 eV at −5% strain and 1.39 eV at 5% strain. This band gap value corresponds to M, A → Γ indirect transition (Fig. S1, ESI†) which is in agreement with previous experimental reports.90 When a negative strain is applied to the bulk (or in the case of the thin-film), the energies of the Γ and Z points become degenerated at the edge of the conduction band (Fig. S1, ESI†). The band gap reduction with the tensile (positive) strain is due to a decrease of the overlap between the Nb d orbitals and the equatorial O p orbitals. The tensile strain specially destabilizes the valence band states projected on the equatorial O pz orbitals and stabilizes the antibonding states at the conduction band projected on the degenerated Nb dxz and dyz orbitals (Fig. S2, ESI†). In light of these results, substrates that produce a positive strain on KNbO3 thin-films are particularly interesting.

Different phenomena and mechanisms are involved in the PV behavior of ferroelectric ultrathin films in addition to the aforementioned BPVE.93 The depolarization field effect,16,94 Schottky barrier effect95–97 and domain wall effect98,99 also play a role in the PCE of these devices. In some cases, the influence of these effects on the PCEs is not clear and their comprehension is not complete, even to date. Moreover, ferroelectric domain modelling would require big supercells that would make the high-throughput screening presented virtually impossible. For this reason, we have opted to calculate the polarization of the solid as a descriptor of the strength of the BPVE in the material. Strain does not only modify the KNbO3 band gap, but it also changes the polarization. Tensile strain has been reported to increase polarization in the [110] direction for rhombohedral or orthorhombic KNbO3.20,100,101 However, the Pz component behaves differently, decreasing when positive strains are applied and increasing with compressive strains.102 This same trend was obtained for the tetragonal KNbO3 bulk and thin-film in our calculations (Fig. 2). When tensile strains are applied, Nb atom displacement in the z direction with respect to the equatorial O atoms is reduced so Pz is gradually lost. However, when compressive strains are applied, the out of the plane Nb atom distortion is larger and Pz increases.
3.2 Substrates
A high-throughput search was performed to find insulators and semiconductors that can be used as potential substrates for KNbO3 epitaxial growth. The list of substrates is included in Table S2 (ESI†) and the misfits for surfaces vectors, εa and εb, are depicted in Fig. 3a. Most of the points in the Fig. 3a diagonal correspond to the substrate (100) surfaces and the other series of points where εa ≠ εb mainly correspond to the substrate (110) surfaces. Ferroelectric thin-film thickness plays a critical role when modelling these interfaces, because polarization and efficiency can be significantly modified depending on it. While conventional solar cell efficiency typically increases with the thickness of the photosensitized material up to a limit,103,104 ferroelectric photovoltaics materials present a higher efficiency at the nanoscale.7,105,106 The ferroelectric critical thickness depends on different variables in which bulk free energy, surface energy and depolarizing energy are competing.107,108 These energies are primarily determined by the nature of the ferroelectric material, the substrate misfit strain, the presence of structural defects and the interaction between the ferroelectric thin-film and the electrode substrate.108 This is the reason why different critical thicknesses can be found for ferroelectric materials.108,109 For instance, Gao et al. found that there is no critical thickness for PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 but the polarization is significantly suppressed.110 In the case of KNbO3, we found that tensile strain reduces polarization for bulk and unsupported ultra-thin-films and Duan et al. reported a critical thickness of 1 and 1.8 nm when Pt and SrRuO3 are the electrodes respectively.111 The fact that the critical thickness depends on the support and the misfit made us opt for a two-layer KNbO3 thin-film, limiting the size of the calculations at screening. However, multilayer thin-films will be studied for the most interesting substrates. A total of 41 interfaces were modelled combining a two-layer KNbO3 thin-film with at least six atomic layer thick substrate slabs (Fig. S3, ESI†). In order to avoid local minima geometries (instead of the global minimum), different initial geometries were explored. These structures will be available in 2019 in the ioChem-BD platform112 and NOMAD repository.113 The electronic structure of all these systems was explored calculating their density of states, DOS, and band gaps (Fig. 3b). While 37% of the models present a metallic behavior; the average band gap of the rest of the interfaces is 1.54 eV, which is 0.21 eV lower than the bulk band gap. These results have been directly compared with the band gap values obtained for the KNbO3 thin-film to determine if the strain is the main variable that modifies the electronic structure when these thin-films are grown on top of the substrates (Fig. 3c). No clear trends can be extracted from Fig. 3c. The highest band gap values are obtained for KNbO3/BeO (2.55 eV) and KNbO3/SrF2 (2.5 eV) interfaces having an average misfit, a,b, of −2.09% and 3.08% respectively. On the other hand, the interfaces with the smallest band gaps are KNbO3/LaN (0.41 eV) and KNbO3/SnS (0.25 eV) with a,b being 0.73% and 2.83% respectively. The data clearly do not follow the same trend compared to the values obtained for the isolated strained thin-film (Fig. 3c), so there must be other variables to consider in order determine the final electronic properties of the interface.

(c) Calculated band gap for KNbO3/substrate interfaces (blue dots) with different average misfits, a,b, compared with the isolated KNbO3 thin-film band gap (orange line). 
3.3 Band alignment
In the previous section, it was shown that the lattice mismatch between the thin-film and the substrate is not the only factor that needs to be controlled to tune the electronic properties. In particular, the band alignment between KNbO3 and the substrate may also play an important role. The relative position of the bands of both materials controls the band gap, which is also important because the substrate acts as an electrode. Indeed, band alignment optimization is known to be crucial in increasing solar cell device efficiency, promoting the dissociation between photo-excited electrons and holes before recombination processes occur.114–117 As a first step, the interfaces have been classified into three types of heterojunctions (Fig. 4a).
 Fig. 4  Heterojunction classification based on the KNbO3 thin-film (orange) and substrate (blue) band alignment. Fermi energy is depicted with gray horizontal lines and band gaps with gray double head arrows. 
Type I heterojunctions correspond to straddling gaps and type II to staggered gaps. Different labels are used to highlight if the bottom edge of the conduction band corresponds to states projected on the KNbO3 thin-film or on the substrate. When the edge of the conduction band is mainly populated by states localized on the KNbO3 thin-film, “tf” label is used. On the other hand, “sub” label means that the edge of the conduction band corresponds to states localized on the substrate. Type III heterojunctions are broken gap systems which behave as metals. This classification (Fig. 4) has been made calculating the projected DOS for each atom of the system (Fig. S4 ESI†); the KNbO3/NaCl interface is used as an example in Fig. S4, ESI.† This interface is type Itf because the states below the Fermi energy and at the bottom edge of the conduction band are localized on KNbO3. The high ionization potential of NaCl and its more ionic character compared to KNbO3 make its valence band lower in energy and narrower than the KNbO3 valence band (Fig. S4, ESI†).
There are many systems presenting a band gap lower than that of the isolated and strained KNbO3 thin-film, but not all fulfill the conditions to be considered potential candidates. Photons are collected by the KNbO3 thin-film, so electron excitation to the conduction band is more likely if the higher states of the valence band around the Fermi level belong to the KNbO3 film. This requirement reduces the list of candidates to heterojunctions Itf and IIsub. Nine systems with heterojunctions Itf were found and all of them correspond to rock salt and fluorite structural prototypes. KNbO3/AgCl is the interface Itf with the lowest band gap, 1.61 eV, being approximately 0.1 eV lower than the KNbO3 bulk band gap value. Interestingly, AgCl is the substrate with the lowest band gap, 2.05 eV, compared to the other eight substrates. This is why the relationship between isolated substrate surface band gaps, Esubsg, and KNbO3/substrate band gap, EKNbOg3/subs, is explored (Fig. S5, ESI†). It appears that there is a direct correlation between Esubsg and EKNbOg3/subs which explains why a lower interface band gap is obtained for AgCl. Most importantly, KNbO3 is a p-type absorber,118 where minority carriers are electrons excited into the conduction band. Thus, electron injection from the KNbO3 thin-film conduction band to the substrate/electrode conduction band determines the efficiency of the solar cell. While the excited electrons have to overcome a barrier to be transferred to the substrate in heterojunctions Itf, there is not such a barrier in heterojunctions IIsub. Only one system was found with this type of band alignment, KNbO3/CdS. Although we could not find in the literature any experimental work describing CdS/KNbO3 based solar cells to validate the screening, CdS/KNbO3 systems have been reported before as good photocatalysts because of efficient charge separation when photo-excited.119 This behavior is due to an effective band alignment between both materials. Most significantly, the CdS/KNbO3 heterojunction has been characterized as type II in agreement with our predictions.120 These experimental results confirm that this approach is in the right direction to accelerate the search for potential candidates for solar cells based on thin-film ferroelectric oxides.
3.4 KNbO3/CdS
Once the broad multidimensional search space has been reduced to a few interesting systems such as CdS/KNbO3, larger and more computationally demanding models need to be built and studied. In this subsection, the CdS/KNbO3 interface is characterized including the use of hybrid exchange correlation functionals for the electronic and optical properties.
The band gap predicted for KNbO3/CdS is 1.35 eV (Fig. 5a), which represents a reduction of 0.4 eV with respect to the non-strained KNbO3 bulk band gap value. Moreover, the gap between the edge of the valence band and the first states of the conduction band localized on the KNbO3 slab is 1.40 eV. This value is consistent with the band gap values obtained for KNbO3 thin-films with similar strains to the CdS lattice parameter. Density of states, DOS, was also calculated with the HSE functional73,74 because the use of more than one U parameter, UCdeff = 2.1 eV and UNbeff = 2.1 eV, combined with the known GGA band gap underestimation, could lead to artificial band alignments.121 As expected, the HSE band gap (2.22 eV, Fig. 5b) is higher than PBE+U value (Fig. 5a) but it is still lower than the HSE bulk band gap value (2.66–3.23 eV).20,88 Few other changes are found in the HSE electronic structure compared to PBE+U calculations. While most of the states around the Fermi energy are localized in KNbO3 for the PBE+U DOS, the density of states localized in the CdS around the Fermi energy clearly increases for the HSE DOS. However, the bottom edge of the conduction band remains the same, with CdS being the main contributor. The polar nature of the KNbO3 (001) plane can produce surface reconstructions, including some defects at the interface. Potential modifications of the electronic structure due to this polar nature were explored using a reconstructed slab. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous experimental or theoretical studies of KNbO3 surface reconstruction. As an alternative, surface reconstruction proposed for KTaO3 was used to build a nonpolar slab model with surface defects. This reconstruction consists of an interlayer cation exchange at both surfaces of a 2 × 2 stoichiometric KTaO3 (001) slab, which stabilizes the polar perovskite surfaces.122 In order to preserve the commensurability with the CdS substrate, the interface model is based on a 6 × 2 slab containing 276 atoms (Fig. S6, ESI†). No significant changes were found on the gap or relative positions of the bands when DOS for this reconstructed interface was compared with polar slab DOS (Fig. S6, ESI†).

Total DOS is shown with a solid black line and KNbO3 and CdS DOS projections are represented in orange and blue colored areas respectively. (b) HSE DOS for the KNbO3/CdS interface. Total DOS is shown with a solid black line and KNbO3 and CdS DOS projections are represented in orange and blue colored areas respectively. (c) Imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric function, ε2(ω), for the KNbO3/CdS interface (green line), unstrained KNbO3 (KNbO3(u)) thin film (dashed orange line), strained KNbO3 thin-film (orange line), CdS slab (blue line) and the summation of KNbO3 and CdS signals (dashed black line). 
The relative positions between the KNbO3 and CdS bands play a key role in understanding the efficiency of the device. However, no information about electron injection is extracted from them. To shed some light on this point, optical spectra were simulated using the imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric function, ε2(ω), (Fig. 5c). An important shoulder below 3 eV appears in the KNbO3/CdS spectra (green line) which is not seen in the unstrained KNbO3 thin-film spectra (dashed orange line). Thus, this shoulder may be connected with the presence of the substrate. The spectra of both fragments, the CdS surface (blue line) and the strained KNbO3 thin-film (orange line), are also included in Fig. 5c. A 0.42 eV shift to lower energies is observed when the unstrained and strained KNbO3 thin-film spectra are compared, which is consistent with the band gap reduction previously mentioned. Moreover, the shoulder below 3 eV seems to be mainly related to CdS–CdS transitions. The summation of the spectra of both fragments (dashed black line) is also depicted to elucidate the electron injection mechanism between the thin-film and the electrode. This procedure has been successfully used before to discern between direct and indirect injection mechanisms in quantum dot (QD) solar cells.123,124 In QD solar cells, the injection mechanism is described as mainly direct (indirect) if the QD absorption peak changes (does not change) its position with respect to the isolated QD when adsorbed on the semiconductor. The intensity of KNbO3/CdS is slightly higher than the summation of the spectra of both fragments between 1.5 eV and 2.0 eV. This difference could be assigned to transitions from the top of the valence band which are localized on the KNbO3 system and the bottom of the conduction band localized on CdS following a direct mechanism. There are also some small changes between 2.5 eV and 3.5 eV where the KNbO3/CdS spectra are lower in intensity compared to the summation of the fragment spectra. However, both spectra match very well in most of the energy range. This supports the idea that most of the transitions in the spectra are CdS–CdS and KNbO3–KNbO3, with an indirect mechanism being the main channel for electron injection. The same trend is found when the HSE functional is used to compute the dielectric function, finding only a shift to higher energies of the simulated spectra but keeping the same features (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Absorption spectra can help analyze the electron injection mechanism but band bending models are needed to understand the interface and charge transfer and separation. There are different approaches to compute the band bending for this kind of heterostructure. Simulations based on 1D Schrödinger–Poisson solvers are convenient for large length scales because they are not exceptionally expensive.125 However, layer projected density of states, LPDOS, are frequently calculated when plane-wave DFT packages such as VASP are used.126,127 We have opted for calculating LPDOS using a three layer thick KNbO3 slab to create a band-bending model for this interface (Fig. 6a). While valence and conduction band edges of the CdS substrate remain at the same energy, there is a clear bending of the valence and conduction bands of the KNbO3 slab to lower energies when it gets closer to the interface. The apparent absence of a Schottky barrier and the more pronounced curvature at the conduction band compared to the valence band should facilitate the injection of photo-excited electrons into the substrate and more efficient charge separation. On the other hand, the band gap reduction due to the tensile strain vanishes after two KNbO3 layers, so the light harvesting performance of this interface strongly depends on the ferroelectric thin-film thickness.
 Fig. 6  (a) Band bending model using the conduction band, CB, and valence band, VB, edge energies from the layer projected density of states, LPDOS. CdS layers are in blue and KNbO3 in orange. The interface is at z = 0 Å. (b) Polarization, Pz, for each layer of the interface. CdS layers are in blue and KNbO3 layers in orange. The interface is at z = 0 Å. 
Finally, polarization, Pz, was calculated for the KNbO3 thin film, on top of the CdS substrate to ensure that bulk spontaneous polarization does not disappear. For the KNbO3 thin film, a Pz of 14 μC cm−2 was found. This is around a 50% reduction compared to the values predicted for the bulk, but it is in the range of experimental values obtained for KNbO3 thin films, 6–42 μC cm−2,101,128 and other ferroelectric materials which have been proposed for photovoltaic applications such as BaTiO3129 (26 μC cm−2) SbSI129 (25 μC cm−2) or CuPbSbS3130 (1.83 μC cm−2). Similar trends were found for the three layer thick KNbO3 thin film (Fig. 6b). Pz presents larger values at the interface and inner layers than on the surface. In any case, they are always slightly lower than that in the one-layer KNbO3 thin film but still in the range of the experimental values.
4 Conclusions
The main goal of this work is to provide a new approach to accelerate the design of new solar cells based on thin-film ferroelectric oxides. Computational materials databases have been combined with a high-throughput mismatch calculator to identify potential substrates for the epitaxial growth of KNbO3 thin films. These substrates were used to build interface models which have been studied by means of density functional theory. The influence of lattice mismatch and band alignment was analyzed to reduce the KNbO3 band gap and optimize electron injection between both surfaces. Once the large multidimensional search space has been reduced using databases and screening DFT calculations, the potential candidates are explored in detail with more computationally demanding models. CdS was found as a potential substrate/electrode for KNbO3 thin films, fulfilling the three main features that are required. First, the misfit between the CdS and KNbO3 lattices considerably reduces the band gap, improving its performance as a sunlight harvester. Second, its spontaneous electric polarization is partially preserved, guaranteeing effective charge separation. Third, the relative position of the bands enhances a fast charge transport from the KNbO3 to CdS conduction bands avoiding electron–hole recombination. An indirect injection seems to be the main mechanism when simulated absorption spectra are analyzed in detail. Although CdS is certainly not a low cost and environmentally friendly material, other new candidates can be found by expanding the search or using other ferroelectric oxides. This study is a good example of how computational materials databases combined with first principles calculations are excellent tools in spurring the development of new solar cell devices, thus reducing the variables that need to be explored experimentally.

 	Fig. 1  Some of the possible nonequivalent surfaces for ntf = 4 (blue) and nsub = 4 (yellow) with different primitive unit cells. Primitive surface vectors, a and b, are depicted for the thin-film (left) and the substrate (right). All possible superlattice surface vectors, u and v, are obtained using transformation matrices (more details in the ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 2  PBE+U band gap, Eg, (orange) and polarization, Pz, (blue) as a function of the in plane strain for the KNbO3 bulk (circles) and two-layer thin-film (triangles).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Misfits εa and εb between KNbO3 and the selected semiconductors and insulators. Prototypes: A = anatase, D = diamond, F = fluorite, RS = rock salt, W = wurtzite and ZB = zinc blende. (b) Calculated band gaps for the KNbO3/substrate interfaces. (c) Calculated band gap for KNbO3/substrate interfaces (blue dots) with different average misfits, a,b, compared with the isolated KNbO3 thin-film band gap (orange line).	 

 	Fig. 4  Heterojunction classification based on the KNbO3 thin-film (orange) and substrate (blue) band alignment. Fermi energy is depicted with gray horizontal lines and band gaps with gray double head arrows.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) PBE+U density of states, DOS, for the KNbO3/CdS interface. Total DOS is shown with a solid black line and KNbO3 and CdS DOS projections are represented in orange and blue colored areas respectively. (b) HSE DOS for the KNbO3/CdS interface. Total DOS is shown with a solid black line and KNbO3 and CdS DOS projections are represented in orange and blue colored areas respectively. (c) Imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric function, ε2(ω), for the KNbO3/CdS interface (green line), unstrained KNbO3 (KNbO3(u)) thin film (dashed orange line), strained KNbO3 thin-film (orange line), CdS slab (blue line) and the summation of KNbO3 and CdS signals (dashed black line).	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Band bending model using the conduction band, CB, and valence band, VB, edge energies from the layer projected density of states, LPDOS. CdS layers are in blue and KNbO3 in orange. The interface is at z = 0 Å. (b) Polarization, Pz, for each layer of the interface. CdS layers are in blue and KNbO3 layers in orange. The interface is at z = 0 Å.
