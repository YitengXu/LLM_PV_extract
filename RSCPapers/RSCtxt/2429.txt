    , Accepted 24th July 2015First published on 28th July 2015AbstractInverted pyramid-based nanostructured black-silicon (BS) solar cells with an Al2O3 passivation layer grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) have been demonstrated. A multi-scale textured BS surface combining silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and inverted pyramids was obtained for the first time by lithography and metal catalyzed wet etching. The reflectance of the as-prepared BS surface was about 2% lower than that of the more commonly reported upright pyramid-based SiNW BS surface over the whole of the visible light spectrum, which led to a 1.7 mA cm−2 increase in short circuit current density. Moreover, the as-prepared solar cells were further passivated by an ALD-Al2O3 layer. The effect of annealing temperature on the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells was investigated. It was found that the values of all solar cell parameters including short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and fill factor exhibit a further increase under an optimized annealing temperature. Minority carrier lifetime measurements indicate that the enhanced cell performance is due to the improved passivation quality of the Al2O3 layer after thermal annealing treatments. By combining these two refinements, the optimized SiNW BS solar cells achieved a maximum conversion efficiency enhancement of 7.6% compared to the cells with an upright pyramid-based SiNWs surface and conventional SiNx passivation.
Introduction
In recent years, the application of silicon nanostructures including silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and nanopores, also known as a kind of “black-silicon” (BS), has attracted intense attention. These structures can achieve ultra low (<1%) reflectance over a wide spectral (400–1000 nm) and incident angle range,1 which eliminates the need for conventional antireflection methods involving pyramidal texture and SiNx deposition normally used by industry production. The unique light trapping ability of the nanostructured BS surface is achieved by forming a density-graded interference between air and silicon substrates as well as prolonging the effective path length of incident light.2–7 More importantly, nanostructured BS can be easily formed in a large area within a short time by a metal-catalyzed-etching method, which has the potential for mass production.
Currently, although the achieved conversion efficiency (CE) of BS solar cells with a SiNW surface (above 18%)8,9 is comparable to that of commercially available cells, there are still two main obstacles that limit the further incremease in CE of current BS solar cells with a SiNW surface. The dramatically increased surface area of nanostructured silicon will lead to a high surface recombination rate of photon-generated carriers.10 Furthermore, the formation of a passivation layer on these surfaces is relatively difficult owing to the high aspect ratio and nano-scale morphology of the nanostructured BS surfaces. For instance, a conventional SiNx passivation layer grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) cannot conformally cover the nanostructured surface.11 To overcome the surface recombination problem, Toor et al. have reported an improved blue light quantum efficiency by reducing the depth of Si nanopores.12 But the photon harvesting merits of nanostructured Si surfaces are overwhelmed in this case. It is also reported that light doping can suppress the surface and Auger recombinations of nanostructured BS surfaces simultaneously.13 However, doping homogeneity and ohmic contact formation will become new problems. Recently, the concept of multi-scale textured (m-textured) surfaces have been proposed by forming nanostructures (such as Si/ZnO nanowires, nanorods, porous silicon, etc.) on micron-scale Si upright pyramids.14–20 As a result, the height of Si nanostructures can be greatly reduced without sacrificing light trapping ability. To resolve the passivation difficulty on Si nanostructures, in recent years, the application of Al2O3 film deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been proven to be useful, taking the advantages of its unique conformal and pin-hole free coverage ability on a Si nanostructured surface.21 In addition, it is reported that the ALD-Al2O3 film is very effective for passivating p-type silicon.22–24 Very recently, investigations have also revealed that the Al2O3 film exhibits good passivation quality on the n+ emitter of p-Si planar nanostructured cells.25,26
There have been simulation results indicating that the inverted pyramid Si surface has a superior photon harvesting ability to that of the upright ones.27 The passivated emitter with rear locally diffused (PERL) cell with a high CE of 24.7% uses inverted pyramids as an anti-reflection surface.28 Very recently, there have also been investigations on Si solar cells with nano-scale inverted pyramids.29 However, nearly all of the research on m-textured BS surfaces is based on upright pyramids. Additionally, investigation of ALD-Al2O3 passivation on m-textured surfaces is rare. In this work, a micro-scale inverted pyramid-based SiNW BS surface is prepared. Compared with the nano-scale inverted pyramid surface mentioned above, the proportion of plain area on a micro-scale inverted pyramid-based surface is much lower than that of a nano-scale pyramid-based surface, which is beneficial for anti-reflection purposes.30 In addition, Si surfaces with micro-scale inverted pyramids have the potential for mass production, as they can be simply and economically fabricated nowadays by one-step methods including nano-imprinting,31 laser ablation,32 or wet chemical etching.33 The micron-scale inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface fabricated in this work is found to be more efficient at light trapping than that of the most reported upright pyramid-based SiNW BS surface, leading to an increased solar cell performance in short circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.8 mA cm−2. The as-grown BS surfaces are further passivated by an 80 nm-thick Al2O3 layer grown by ALD. The effect of annealing temperature on the Al2O3 passivated BS cells is studied through analyzing its minority carrier lifetime and the related photovoltaic performance. Results show that a maximum enhancement in Jsc of 5.5%, and 7.6% enhancement in CE are achieved by the optimized BS cells compared to those of conventional SiNx passivated cells with upright pyramid-based SiNW surfaces.
Experimental
Boron-doped p-type monocrystalline silicon wafers with a resistivity of 1–3 Ω cm were used as the substrates. First, a thermally oxidized SiO2 film of about 200 nm was grown on the substrates. Then aligned square windows with a width of 10 μm were opened on the SiO2 layer by lithography and diluted hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching. The gaps between the square windows were 2.0 μm. The wafers were then immersed in 15 wt% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) at 75 °C for about 30 min to form inverted pyramids. After that, SiNWs were prepared on the surface of inverted pyramids by utilizing a two-step metal-catalyzed-etching method. First, silver nanoparticles were uniformly deposited on the surface of inverted pyramids in a mixed solution of 1 mM AgNO3 and 0.5 vol% H2O2 for 90 s at room temperature. Then, SiNWs were formed by immersing the wafers in a mixed solution of 12.5 vol% HF, 3 vol% H2O2 for 30 s at room temperature. After that, the wafers were soaked in concentrated HNO3 for 2 h to dissolve the silver dendrites and then immersed in diluted HF solution to remove the oxide. Some upright pyramid-based SiNW surfaces were also fabricated as a reference. The upright pyramids were prepared by immersing the wafers in a mixed solution of 2 wt% NaOH, 2 wt% Na2SiO3, and 10 vol% for 20 min at a temperature of ∼80 °C. The formation procedures of SiNWs on upright pyramids were the same as mentioned above.
For solar cell fabrication, the n+ emitter was formed using liquid POCl3 diffusion, the sheet resistance was about 50 Ω per square. After the phosphor silicon glass (PSG) was removed, Ti/Ag (200/2000 nm) was deposited through a metal mask by electron beam evaporation to form front grids. The area-fraction on the front surface was about 11% (the power loss induced by front grid shadow was not excluded in the Jsc and CE calculation), and the active area of each cell was 1 cm2. The back electrode was formed by screen-printing of aluminum paste. The front/rear electrode metallization and back-surface-field formation were realized by annealing the samples in a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) furnace in air with an ambient peak temperature of about 780 °C. The samples were then shortly immersed into diluted HF solution to remove the thin oxide layer and contaminant formed on the front surface of the samples during the formation/annealing step of the electrodes. After that, one batch of the cells was passivated by an 80 nm-thick Al2O3 film deposited by thermal ALD (BENEQ TFS-200) at 200 °C. Trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O were used as the precursors. After deposition, the cells were annealed under a N2 environment at different temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 °C in a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) furnace (Annealsys AS-ONE). Another batch was covered by a conventional SiNx layer with a thickness of 80 nm for comparison as reference cells, which was deposited using SiH4 and NH3 as reactants in a PECVD (Piotech SC-300) chamber at 400 °C.
Surface morphologies of the prepared samples were characterized by a SEM (EFI NanoSEM-650). Reflectance spectra were measured using a Lambda-750 spectrometer equipped with integrating sphere. The refraction indices of the as-deposited Al2O3 and SiNx films were measured to be around 1.65 and 2.1 from spectroscopic ellipsometry, respectively. The minority carrier lifetime mappings were obtained using a WT-2000 lifetime tester. Solar cell performance was tested under standard 1-sun illumination with an Oriel-94041A simulator and a Keithley-2400 sourcemeter. Data obtained was based on an average of about 6 wafers per cell.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the tilted scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a representative inverted pyramid-based SiNW BS surface. As can be seen, the SiNWs are uniformly distributed on the surface of inverted pyramids. Compared with the conventional upright pyramid-based SiNW surface shown in Fig. 1(b), the inverted pyramid structures are aligned in an ordered manner with a width of 10 μm, while the upright pyramids are randomly distributed with varied width ranges from 2 to 8 μm. The cross-sectional images of the inverted and upright SiNW surfaces are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d) respectively, which are obtained from the dashed line area indicated in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Although the side walls of inverted/upright pyramids are (111) plane oriented, the SiNWs are formed along the [001] direction. To guarantee a more accurate comparison of light harvesting ability between the two kinds of m-textured surface, the SiNWs with both kinds of pyramids are strictly maintained at identical height (720–730 nm), as it will greatly affect their light trapping ability as well as their solar cell performance.34

To evaluate the light trapping ability, the reflectance spectra of the plain Si surface, inverted pyramid Si surface, and upright pyramid-based surface are shown in Fig. 2. The reflectance spectra shown in Fig. 2(a) were measured in comparison to that of the plain Si surface and upright pyramid based surfaces. As can be seen, the plain Si surface exhibits a high reflectance (R) which exceeds 30% in whole visible light spectrum. After the inverted/upright pyramid geometries are formed, the value of R is suppressed. It can be observed that the Si surface with inverted pyramids shows a higher reflectance than that with upright pyramids. This mainly results from the high reflectance of the remaining plain platform between the inverted pyramids.30 After the metal-catalyzed-etching process, the formed SiNWs provide an index-graded anti-reflection buffer between silicon and air. As a result, the values of R on all three types of Si surface are significantly reduced. It is noted that the value of R on the upright pyramid-based SiNW surface shown is lower than that of the plain Si-based nanowire structure. That is because the side walls of the pyramid structures make reflected light more likely to enter the SiNW surface by multiple reflections.20 More importantly, the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface shows an average reflectance as low as 4% over the whole spectrum of 400–1100 nm. It is clear that the light trapping ability of the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface is better than that of the upright pyramid-based one. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the values of R on all inverted/upright pyramid-based surfaces are further suppressed after the deposition of the SiNx film. Owing to the wide band anti-reflection characteristic of SiNW structure, the inverted/upright pyramid-based surface with SiNW exhibits superior light harvesting ability for long wavelength photons to that of the bare pyramid surfaces. It is encouraging that the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface still exhibits a lower R than that of the upright pyramid-based SiNW surfaces when coated with SiNx film. The beneficial effect of the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface on the practical solar cell performance will be discussed later.

Three dimensional (3D) finite difference time domain (FDTD) analysis was carried out to gain insight into the light harvesting mechanism of the inverted/upright pyramid based SiNW surface. The simulation dimensions of the inverted pyramids (10 μm in width, 12 μm in height), upright pyramids (5 μm in width, 6 μm in height), and SiNWs (725 nm in height, with an area density of 6.4 × 109 cm−2) were averaged from the values determined from the SEM images shown in Fig. 1. In addition, an inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface of 5 μm in width and 6 μm in height is also added for comparison. In the simulation, the distribution of light intensity (|Ey|) of all the surfaces is calculated using λ = 550 nm. The wavelength is selected close to the peak irradiance of the solar spectra. The simulated results of the three surfaces are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c), separately. It is evident that |Ey| in the bottom of the 10 μm in width inverted pyramids based SiNW surface (region A1) is much stronger than that in the valleys between the 5 μm in width upright pyramids (region B1). This phenomenon can be explained by two reasons. On the one hand, in the case of the bare pyramid surfaces (without SiNWs), it is reported that around 37% of incident light experiences a triple bounce on the front surface of the inverted pyramids, while most rays undergo a double bounce on the upright pyramids.27 In this work, when SiNWs are added on the surface of the two types of pyramids (indicated in Fig. 3(d) and (e)), there is more chance for the reflected light to re-enter the SiNW surface in the inverted pyramids than in the upright ones. This assumption can be proved by comparing with the simulated results between Fig. 3(b) and (c). Results show that under the same geometric size of the pyramids, the |Ey| distribution between the side walls of the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface is still stronger than that of the upright pyramid-based SiNW surface. On the other hand, the actual fabricated inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface is twice as large as the size of the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface, the multiple-reflection effect on the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface is further promoted by the increased geometric size of the inverted pyramids. It can be seen from Fig. 3(a) and (c) that the |Ey| distribution on the 5 μm in width inverted pyramid-based surface (region C1) is further enhanced by the application of the 10 μm in width inverted pyramid-based surface (region A1). The increased bounce of reflected light on the 10 μm in width inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface increases the total absorption of the incident light, leading to the weaker reflected light intensity (region A2) than that of the 5 μm in width inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface (region C2). With the combination of the two effects, more light is absorbed into the Si substrate of the inverted pyramid-based SiNW sample with a width of 10 μm, leading to a stronger light distribution intensity below the Z < 0 area in Fig. 3(a) than that in Fig. 3(b). Moreover, the reflected light intensity above the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface with a width of 10 μm (region A1) is weaker than that of the upright pyramid-based ones with a width of 5 μm (region B1). This phenomenon agrees well with the reflection results shown in Fig. 2. The simulation findings reconfirm the superior photon harvesting ability of the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface.

To verify the effectiveness of the inverted pyramid-based SiNWs as an anti-reflection surface for solar cell applications, the corresponding BS solar cells were subsequently fabricated. They were coated by a PECVD SiNx layer to examine the performance of the cells prepared by a conventional industrial passivation process. The detected J–V parameters and CE are summarized in Table 1. Compared to the cells with an upright pyramid-based SiNW surface, the cells with an inverted pyramid-based surface exhibited an improvement in Jsc of 0.8 mA cm−2. This is mainly due to the superior photon capturing ability of the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface as indicated in Fig. 2(a), which led to the increase in photon generated carriers. We have demonstrated in our previous work that the value of Voc is very sensitive to the surface recombination rate for Si-based solar cells.35 In this work, the surface area of the two kinds of pyramid-based SiNW are identical because they are all exposed with (111) crystal planes. Moreover, the passivation quality for the as-prepared cells is similar because they are all coated by a SiNx layer. Accordingly, there is no obvious improvement in Voc performance of the optimized cells. Owing to the increased value of Jsc, the cells with an inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface exhibit a net increase in CE of 0.3%. As a result, the inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface is promising to take the place of the most reported upright pyramid-based surface for solar cell applications.

Although an improved cell efficiency is achieved by using an inverted pyramid-based SiNW surface for anti-reflection, the averaged Voc of 590 mV is relatively low compared to those of conventional SiNx passivated Si-based planar surface cells (typically around 630 mV).13 To further suppress the recombination of inverted pyramid-based SiNW surfaces, the SiNx layer was replaced by a 80 nm-thick Al2O3 layer grown by ALD for passivating the cells. As shown in Fig. 2(b), although R on a Al2O3 passivated surface was slightly higher than that on a SiNx passivated surface (owning to the lower refractive index of Al2O3 film comparing with that of SiNx passivated surface), the improved surface passivation quality by the application Al2O3 film can greatly compensate the Jsc loss induced by reflectance degeneration, which will be discussed later. A post-annealing treatment was made at various temperatures. The obtained J–V curve and the corresponding cell parameters are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, respectively. As can be seen, the Al2O3 passivated BS cells without annealing treatment show a smaller value of Voc than those of the SiNx passivated cells. It indicated that the as-grown Al2O3 layer grown by ALD has a poor passivation quality. As reported, there have been activated H atoms in the SiNx film during the deposition process of PECVD, which are beneficial for suppressing surface recombination on the silicon surface by reducing the surface state density of the silicon surface.36 However, the hydrogen (H) atoms in an un-annealed ALD-Al2O3 layer mostly exist in an inactivated hydroxyl (H–O) form.37 It is reported that the passivation quality of the Al2O3 layer can be improved greatly by annealing treatment.22,38,39 As listed in Table 2, all cell parameters including Voc, Jsc, and fill factor (FF) increased substantially when the Al2O3 layer was annealed at 300 °C. More importantly, the 450 °C annealed cells achieved a maximum CE value of ∼14.2%, a net increase in CE of 0.7% was obtained compared to those of the SiNx passivated ones. However the photovoltaic performance of the 600 °C annealed cell was largely degraded. The low Voc and FF value indicate a severe shunting effect within the cell. This kind of shunting effect was also observed in other kinds of Si nanostructured cells,10,26 which is caused by the melting of the top electrode into the PN junction area of the cells. Results show that an annealing temperature of 450 °C is an optimized value for Al2O3 passivated BS cells.

To further understand the mechanism responsible for the effect of different annealing temperatures on the photovoltaic performance of as-prepared Al2O3 passivated solar cells, the values of the minority carrier lifetime on the front surface of the cells were measured using a lifetime tester. Fig. 5(a) shows an image of the prepared BS solar cell. The lifetime mapping on the surfaces of unannealed, 300, 450, and 600 °C annealed cells are given in Fig. 5(b)–(e), respectively. It can been seen from Fig. 5(a)–(c) that the minority carrier lifetime (τ) on the cell surface increases with increasing annealing temperature from 0 to 450 °C. Previous works22,38,39 indicate that the increased τ after the annealing treatment is mainly as result of the formation of interfacial oxide layer, the interface hydrogenation effect, as well as the increased negative charge density inside the Al2O3 film. Moreover, it is well known that the Al2O3 film is most beneficial for passivating p and p+ surfaces due to the negative built-in charge. However in this work, the Al2O3 film was utilized for the passivation of n+ emitters. It is noted that the 50 Ohm sq−1 n+ emitters here have a surface doping concentration of ∼1020 cm−3 and a profile depth of ∼500 nm. This doping condition is suitable for the occurrence of the surface charge carrier inversion related passivation effect indicated by Hoex et al.40 and Richter et al.41 This passivation effect can also promote the photovoltaic performance of the BS cells. The low τ at the bottom part of the 600 °C annealed cell corresponds with the top electrode-induced shunting effect observed in Table 2.

The simultaneously increase in Jsc, Voc, as well as FF values under the optimized temperature of 450 °C can be explained as follows. The diffusion length (L) of photon generated carriers in silicon solar cells can be written as:42 (1)where D is a diffusion coefficient, which is a constant in silicon. After thermal annealing treatment, the value of L of the solar cells is increased with increasing τ. Thus, more carriers can diffuse to the electrodes and be collected by the cell. As a result, the value of Jsc increases accordingly. Based on the study of Nayak et al.,43 the suppressed surface recombination can greatly reduce the saturation current density (J0) of solar cells, which is most beneficial for increasing the Voc value. The annealing treatment on the BS solar cells can improve the formation quality of the ohmic contact between the front electrodes and SiNWs. In addition, the activated H atoms during the annealing process can purify the metal of the front electrode, which will reduce the related bulk resistance. These two effects can effectively decrease the series resistance of the cells, which is most beneficial for increasing the value of FF.22 It can be concluded that the annealing treatment is vital for improving passivation quality as well as enhancing photovoltaic performance of Al2O3 passivated BS solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, a black silicon solar cell was demonstrated by introducing an inverted pyramid-based silicon nanowire surface and an Al2O3 passivation layer grown by atomic layer deposition. The inverted pyramid-based silicon nanowire surface shows superior light trapping ability in the whole of the visible light spectrum over the upright pyramid-based one, resulting in an evident increase in short circuit current and improvement in solar cell performance. For the black silicon cells passivated by the Al2O3 layer, the optimized rapid thermal annealing temperature of 450 °C increases the minority carrier lifetime on the black silicon surface substantially, which leads to the simultaneous increase in short circuit current, open circuit voltage, as well as fill factor. Eventually, the optimized black silicon cells achieve a relative enhancement of 7.6% in conversion efficiency compared to those of conventional SiNx passivated cells with more commonly reported upright pyramid-based silicon nanowire surfaces. The approach reported herein could be extended to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of other kinds of nanostructured black silicon solar cells.
