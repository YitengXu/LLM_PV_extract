    , Accepted 1st March 2021First published on 3rd March 2021AbstractBinary transition metal-based nitrides are promising for overall water splitting. Morphology and heterojunction engineering is important to realize effective catalysis, but their simultaneous engineering remains a challenge. Herein, we have shown the designed synthesis of porous 2D molybdenum nitride/cobalt nitride heterojunction nanosheets (2D porous Mo2N–CoxN) based on controllable nitridation of Mo species modified Co(OH)2 (Co–Mo–O) nanosheets by cutting ZIF-67 polyhedra in Na2MoO4 aqueous solution. The combined advantages, including the favourable water dissociation kinetics due to the electron redistribution at the heterointerface as shown by theoretical calculations, the large accessible surface of the nanosheets and enhanced mass-transport ability of pores, endow the 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN with excellent electrocatalytic HER activity with a low overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10 of 29 mV, close to that of Pt/C) and good OER performance with η10 of 247 mV. An electrolyzer based on the 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN electrodes only needs 1.53 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and can be driven by a solar panel. The strategy is versatile and can be used to prepare other 2D heterojunction catalysts, such as W (V)–Co based catalysts.
Introduction
Hydrogen is the most promising clean energy with a high energy density.1,2 Water electrolysis driven by the low-voltage electricity from solar energy is a sustainable way to produce hydrogen.3,4 The two half-reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER, and oxygen evolution reaction, OER) of water splitting are “uphill” processes and require additional potential (overpotential), leading to high energy consumption.5 Noble metal-based catalysts (Pt, RuO2, etc.) are the most popular catalysts, using which the reaction activation energy can be reduced. However, the use of noble metal-based catalysts is greatly limited by their low reserves, high price and mono-functionality, which has fueled the demand for low-cost and effective bi-functional catalysts.6 Transition metal (TM)-based compounds, which have abundant reserves and low price, can activate H* and H2O through their d orbitals, being promising substitutes of noble metals for the HER and OER.7 The catalytic ability is closely related to the composition and morphology.8 It is imperative to rationally engineer the composition and structure of catalysts to regulate the electronic structure, enhance the mass/charge transfer ability and increase the accessible surface area.9,10
Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) with a noble metal-like electronic configuration around the Fermi level are a research hotspot in the catalysis field.11,12 TMNs can trap and activate protons and H2O, thus being promising alternatives to noble metals for water splitting. Many studies have been conducted on early TMNs (ETMNs) and late TMNs (LTMNs). Generally, ETMNs, such as Mo2N and WN, show good HER activity but poor OER activity because the corresponding oxides formed during the reaction are not very active for the OER.13 Notably, the oxides formed on LTMNs during the reaction are active for the OER. The synergy of LTMNs with the oxide layer endows the materials with good activity for the OER.14 Xie et al. have reported the synthesis of Co4N porous nanowire array/CC with an overpotential of 257 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10) for the OER.15,16 Yu et al. have shown 1D porous cobalt nitride on Ni foam with an η10 of 95 mV for the HER in KOH medium.17 Generally, LTMNs, for example Co4N, usually show good activity for one half reaction (OER) at the expense of the activity for the other half-reaction (HER), thus giving a moderate performance for overall water splitting. Therefore, it is important to design a catalyst with both good activity for the HER and OER. In this regard, heterojunction catalysts composed of ETMs and LTMs are promising for water splitting due to the electron redistribution at the heterointerface arising from the “3d electron complementary effect”. The performance can also be guided by contact with the reagents and the ability for mass/charge transfer. Thus, an elaborate interface and morphology engineering are needed. Typically, a 1D Co/Mo2N heterojunction needs a cell voltage of 1.57 V to drive 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting.18 Li et al. have shown that the MoO3/Ni–NiO hybrid enables overall water-splitting at 1.55 V to reach 10 mA cm−2 current density.19 A porous spindle-like MoO2–FeP heterojunction has shown an overpotential of 103 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the HER, benefiting from the electron transfer from MoO2 to FeP for the optimization of H2O and H* adsorption energies.20 Compared with 1D and 0D structures, 2D nanosheets are promising for catalysis due to their large accessible surface. Therefore, the rational design of 2D LTMN–ETMN heterojunctions is expected to facilitate highly efficient overall water splitting, but it is rarely reported.
Herein, we have shown a novel method for the synthesis of porous 2D molybdenum nitride/cobalt nitride heterojunction nanosheets based on cutting ZIF-67 polyhedra. Previous studies have shown that 2D (carbon) materials can be formed by breaking carbon tubes, fullerenes, etc.21,22 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous materials composed of TMs and ligands.23 Typically, ZIF-67 composed of Co2+ coordinated with 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) can act as a template for the synthesis of hollow materials by a selected replacement reaction.24 The phenomenon motivates us to think whether a controllable etching can break the structure, thus forming 2D nanosheets. Excitingly, we found that, in Na2MoO4 aqueous solution, ZIF-67 polyhedra can be etched and opened to form 2D Co–Mo based thin sheets. A controllable nitridation can facilitate their conversion into 2D porous cobalt nitride nanosheets modified by molybdenum nitride (2D porous Mo2N–CoxN nanosheets). The 2D porous heterostructures have combined several advantages favourable for electrocatalysis, including the large accessible surface of 2D nanosheets, the favourable water dissociation kinetics by the electron redistribution at the heterointerface and enhanced transfer/mass ability.25 Electrochemical tests have shown that porous Mo2N–CoxN nanosheets exhibit excellent HER performance with an η10 of 29 mV, which is close to that of commercial Pt/C. It also shows good OER performance with low η10 of 247 mV, which is superior to that of RuO2. The performance is much superior to that of the corresponding single-component CoN (HER η10 = 163 mV, OER η10 = 285 mV) and MoxN (HER η10 = 161 mV, OER η10 = 300 mV) catalysts. An alkaline electrolyzer using the 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN nanosheets as both the anode and cathode only needs 1.53 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, being superior to most Mo (Co) based catalysts. In addition, it can be driven by a solar panel for sustainable H2 production. The strategy is also versatile and can be used to prepare other 2D heterojunctions, such as W (V)–Co based catalysts.
Results and discussion
Structural and morphological characterization
Porous 2D molybdenum nitride/cobalt nitride heterojunction nanosheets were synthesized based on cutting ZIF-67 polyhedra (Fig. 1a). The ZIF-67 polyhedra were etched in a Na2MoO4 aqueous solution to give 2D Co–Mo–O nanosheets (denoted as Co–Mo–O). Through a controllable nitridation, the Co–Mo–O nanosheets were converted into porous 2D molybdenum nitride/cobalt nitride heterojunction nanosheets. During the synthesis, dopamine can interact with both Co species and Mo species, thus facilitating the combination of Mo and Co species. In addition, it can be converted into N-doped carbon during pyrolysis, which is favourable for improving the electrocatalytic performance. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Co–Mo–O sheets shows two crystal phases of Co(OH)2 and Na0.94H0.85MoO3 (Fig. 1b). The pattern is obviously different from that of ZIF-67 (Fig. S1†), indicating the cutting of ZIF-67 into the Co–Mo–O precursor.

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of ZIF-67 reveals a regular dodecahedron morphology with a smooth surface (Fig. 1c).26 As displayed in Fig. 1d, the Co–Mo–O precursor presents well-dispersed 2D sheets with a lateral size of about 1 μm and a rough surface. The atomic force microscope (AFM) image in Fig. 1e further proves the formation of nanosheets with a lateral size of about 1 μm and a thickness below 10 nm. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images (Fig. 1f and g) further confirm the formation of the 2D thin sheet. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1h) shows lattice fringes of 0.259 and 0.465 nm in two adjacent sites, corresponding to the (−311) plane of Na0.94H0.85MoO3 and (001) plane of Co(OH)2, respectively. The scanning TEM (STEM) image and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping in Fig. 1i show the uniform distribution of Co, Mo, Na, C, N, and O throughout the 2D nanosheet. Fig. S2† shows the thermogravimetric (TG) curve of the Co–Mo–O precursor and ZIF-67 polyhedra. It can be seen that the final weight loss of ZIF-67 is about 66.4%. However, it is about 42.8% for the Co–Mo–O precursor. The high loss weight of ZIF-67 compared to the Co–Mo–O precursor should be ascribed to the decomposition of the 2-MIM ligand in ZIF-67. The TG test further indicates the conversion of ZIF-67 into the Co–Mo–O precursor.27,28
The above analyses verify the formation of 2D Co–Mo–O sheets by using ZIF-67 polyhedra as the precursor. In order to better understand the morphology evolution process, a series of control experiments were conducted to explore the “cutting” process. First, the etching is performed only in pure H2O without adding sodium molybdate. As shown in Fig. S3a,† the XRD pattern of the sample shows the characteristic peak of Co(OH)2, indicating that the OH− from H2O plays the main role in etching ZIF-67 polyhedra during the synthesis. However, the Co(OH)2 sheets have irregular morphology in this case (Fig. S3b†), which suggests the positive role of Na2MoO4 in the formation of regular sheets.29,30 Furthermore, when the etching reaction is carried out in the water + ethanol (v/v = 1) medium, only a hollow structure can be formed. In particular, there is no obvious etching in the ethanol medium, which should be due to the lower basicity of ethanol than H2O and further confirms the important role of H2O in etching ZIF-67 polyhedra. Second, the time-dependent experiments show the evolution process from polyhedra to 2D thin sheets (Fig. 2). The hollow structure can be formed after etching for 2 hours in sodium molybdate aqueous solution (Fig. 2a). The formation of the hollow structure should be caused by the different diffusion rates of inner and outer Co2+ with OH−, which is similar to the nano-scale “Kirkendall effect”. The STEM image clearly shows the hollow structure and the corresponding EDS mapping reveals the uniform distribution of Mo, Co, O and C elements over the hollow polyhedra. As the etching time is extended to 4 hours, both 2D sheets and hollow polyhedra can be observed (Fig. 2b), indicating that some polyhedra have been cut into nanosheets. When the etching time is further extended to 6 hours, only 2D Co–Mo–O nanosheets can be observed as shown in the STEM image and the corresponding EDS mapping (Fig. 2c). The above results show the formation of 2D Co–Mo–O sheets through the ZIF-67 polyhedron etching–cutting process. Also, the size of the sheets has an important influence on the catalytic performance. Some reports have shown the synthesis of Co(OH)2 sheets,31 but they have larger size and thickness. In this work, the tunable size of ZIF-67 enables the synthesis of 2D Co–Mo–O nanosheets with controllable size (Fig. S4†). Although there are some reports about the formation of a hollow structure by etching ZIF-67,32 this is the first report to prepare 2D Co–Mo based thin sheets based on cutting ZIF-67 polyhedra.

TMNs are useful catalysts for water splitting. The 2D Co–Mo–O sheets are suitable precursors for the synthesis of 2D Co–Mo based nitrides. Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of the Mo2N–CoxN-5 sample prepared by the nitridation of the Co–Mo–O precursor in an NH3 atmosphere at 500 °C. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 43.72°, 50.85° and 74.95° correspond well to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of the Co5.47N phase (PDF# 41-0943), respectively. The diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 36.19 and 42.19° correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of the CoN phase (PDF# 16-0116). Besides, diffraction peaks belonging to the Mo2N phase (PDF# 25-1368) can be observed at 2θ = 37.68°, 43.16° and 45.02°, indicating the formation of Mo2N–CoxN composites. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Mo2N–CoxN-5 sample still maintains a sheet-like structure with a rougher surface than the original Co–Mo–O precursor, which implies the formation of the nanoparticles during the nitriding process.33,34 The AFM images (Fig. 3c and S5†) further demonstrate the presence of nanosheets. Also, the TEM image in Fig. 3d confirms that the 2D nanosheets are composed of small nanoparticles. In addition, we can obviously see the presence of many holes on the Mo2N–CoxN-5 sheets. The formation of the pores can be attributed to the loss of H2O from oxides/hydroxides during the nitridation process. The holes on the nanosheets can promote the transfer of electrolytes, being favourable for the improvement of catalytic activity.35 Also, a thin carbon layer with a thickness of several nanometers can be clearly observed (Fig. 3e). The carbon layer should originate from the decomposition of dopamine,36 protecting the catalyst and enhancing the electrocatalytic performance.20,30 The HRTEM image (Fig. 3f) shows lattice fringes of 0.238, 0.179 and 0.214 nm in the three adjacent particles, which correspond to the (112) plane of Mo2N, the (200) plane of Co5.47N and the (200) plane of CoN, respectively, and demonstrate the formation of heterojunctions. The EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 3g) reveals the uniform distribution of Co, Mo, C, and N throughout the 2D nanosheets.

XPS tests were performed to analyze the elemental components and valence in the samples. The survey spectra (Fig. S6†) show the peaks of Co, Mo, C, N, and O elements in the Co–Mo–O precursor and Mo2N–CoxN-5 sheets. As shown in Fig. 4a, the high-resolution spectrum of Co 2p for the Co–Mo–O precursor can be divided into four peaks. The low peaks at the binding energies of 781.9 and 796.7 eV correspond to Co2+ 2p3/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively, along with two satellite peaks (identified as “Sat.”). The high-resolution spectrum of Mo 3d (Fig. 4b) shows two peaks at 231.8 and 235.2 eV, ascribed to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo6+, respectively.19 The high-resolution spectrum of O 1s of the Co–Mo–O precursor (Fig. 4c) shows peaks for O–M (530.7 eV), O–H (531.5 eV) and adsorbed water (533.1 eV).20 The high resolution N 1s XPS spectrum displays three peaks belonging to N– (398.6 eV), –NH– (399.6 eV) and N+ (400.8 eV) in dopamine (Fig. S7†).37 In contrast, the corresponding elements shows different environments in the 2D Mo2N–CoxN-5 heterojunction. Fig. 4d shows the high-resolution spectrum of Co 2p of the Mo2N–CoxN-5 heterojunction. The peaks located at 781.7 and 796.7 eV can be attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co2+ in CoOx.38 The two peaks observed at 780.1 and 795.1 eV belong to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co–N (Co3+) in CoxN.39 Besides, the two weak peaks at 778.7 (Co 2p3/2) and 793.9 eV (Co 2p1/2) can be assigned to Co–Co in CoxN.40 Importantly, the Mo 3d spectrum can be divided into three pairs of peaks. The peaks at 228.8 and 232.2 eV can be assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo3+ in Mo2N.41 The presence of Mo3+ is favourable for the electrocatalytic reaction. The two pairs of peaks at 231.6/234.7 eV and 233.3/236.5 eV can be assigned to the high-oxidation-state Mo5+ and Mo6+, respectively.42–44 The presence of Mo6+ is related to the slight oxidation of nitrides.45 As shown in the N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 4f), the three peaks at 399.6, 397.9 and 396.5 eV can be attributed to pyrrolic N, pyridinic N and N–Mo/Co, respectively.46 Fig. S8† shows the Co XPS spectrum of the CoxN sheets. Obviously, the Co 2p peaks in Mo2N–CoxN-5 show a negative shift compared with the pure CoxN sheets, indicating the transfer of electrons between Mo and Co species. Correspondingly, compared with the Mo 3d binding energy in MoxN, the Mo 3d peaks for the Mo2N–CoxN-5 heterojunction shift to high binding energy.18,47 The results indicate the presence of electron transfer between Mo2N and CoxN, which can result in electron redistribution at the heterointerface and modulate the electronic structure for improving the catalytic performance.20,48,49

The microstructure can be regulated by changing the synthetic parameters. Fig. S9a† shows a SEM image of Mo2N–CoxN-4 obtained by heating the precursor at 400 °C. The sample presents a sheet-like structure, like the precursor. When the temperature rises to 600 °C, the sample shows obvious aggregation, which is not conducive to improving the catalytic performance (Fig. S9b†). We can observe the same diffraction peak positions in the XRD patterns of different samples, but with a difference in the intensity. Fig. S10a† shows the XRD pattern of the CoxN sheets. It can be seen that the sample is composed of CoN and Co5.47N. As shown in Fig. S10b,† there is obvious aggregation for CoN–Co5.47N samples obtained by the nitridation of 2D Co(OH)2, indicating the role of Mo species in the stabilization of the samples during the calcination.20 In addition, the ratio of Mo and Co species in the final nitrides can be adjusted just by tuning the amount of Na2MoO4 in the synthesis of the Co–Mo–O precursor (Fig. S11†). The adjusted structure is important for tuning and optimizing the catalytic performance. Notably, this synthesis strategy can be used to synthesize other 2D heterojunction catalysts. Typically, by replacing molybdates with tungstates and vanadates, the corresponding W- and V-species modified Co(OH)2 sheets can be obtained (Fig. S12 and S13†). After the nitridation of the Co–W–O and Co–V–O precursors, the corresponding 2D WN-CoxN and VN-CoxN nanosheet catalysts can also be obtained (Fig. S14 and S15†). The above results indicate that the present route provides a new avenue for the synthesis of 2D sheet-like hybrid materials.
Electrocatalytic performance
To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance, the HER activity of the porous 2D Mo2N–CoxN nanosheets was first investigated in 1 M KOH by adopting a standard three-electrode system, in which a carbon rod and Hg/HgO electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The polarization curves were obtained by a linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test without IR-correction (Fig. 5).

The inset in (e) is the equivalent circuit. (f) Polarization curves of Mo2N–CoxN-5 before and after 2000 CV cycles. The inset shows the time dependence of the catalytic current during electrolysis over the course of 48 h in 1.0 M KOH. 
As displayed in Fig. 5a, the 2D Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst shows the best HER activity among all the as-prepared samples with a low onset potential comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. As shown in Fig. 5b and Table S2,† Mo2N–CoxN-5 only needs an overpotential of 29 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much lower than those of CoxN (163 mV), Mo2N–CoxN-4 (120 mV), and Mo2N–CoxN-6 (57 mV) and close to that of a 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (18 mV). In addition, the pristine nickel foam and MoxN exhibit poor HER performance with a high overpotential of 252 and 161 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. S16†), which indicates the main contribution of Mo2N–CoxN nanosheets to the outstanding HER activity. In order to eliminate the influence of ohmic resistance, the LSV data of the Mo2N–CoxN catalysts with 90% IR compensation were also obtained. As shown in Fig. S17,† they only need a low overpotential to deliver a high current density. For the Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst, to deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, the required overpotentials are only 26 and 159 mV, respectively, implying its outstanding HER performance at large current density. Tafel analysis was performed to study the reaction kinetics. As presented in Fig. 5c, the Tafel slope for Mo2N–CoxN-5 nanosheets is 81 mV dec−1, much smaller than those of CoxN (193 mV dec−1), Mo2N–CoxN-4 (167 mV dec−1) and Mo2N–CoxN-6 (102 mV dec−1). The results suggest the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism on the 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst, for which the reaction rate is determined by the electrodesorption step (H2O discharge and desorption of H from the catalyst surface).50,51 The Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst shows better performance than Mo2N–CoxN-4 and Mo2N–CoxN-6 catalysts (Fig. 5a–c). Generally, nitrides have better HER activity than oxides. Due to the low nitridation temperature, the ratio of nitrides in Mo2N–CoxN-4 is lower than that of Mo2N–CoxN-5. So, the Mo2N–CoxN-5 sample shows better HER performance than Mo2N–CoxN-4. The poor performance of Mo2N–CoxN-6 is related to the large crystalline size and aggregation upon high-temperature treatment. Notably, all Mo2N–CoxN samples show better performance than CoxN and MoxN, emphasizing the benefit of constructing the heterojunctions for promoting the HER. Moreover, the 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 heterojunction shows the lowest overpotential and smallest Tafel slope among various control samples (Fig. S18†), further suggesting the importance of constructing a suitable interface for highly effective HER.
The catalytic activity is related to the number of active sites. The electrochemical specific surface area (ECSA) was studied to estimate the number of exposed active sites. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) roughly scales with the ECSA, and was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the voltage range of 0.12–0.22 V (vs. RHE) with different scan rates (Fig. S19†). As shown in Fig. 5d and S20,† the Cdl value of Mo2N–CoxN-5 is 10.34 mF cm−2, being higher than those of CoxN (4.01 mF cm−2), Mo2N–CoxN-4 (4.21 mF cm−2), and Mo2N–CoxN-6 (9.23 mF cm−2) and other control samples. The largest Cdl value of Mo2N–CoxN-5 indicates that 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 has more catalytically active sites than other samples, contributing to its good HER performance. Moreover, the Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst shows higher current density than the other catalysts at the same potential based on the ECSA-normalized LSV curves (Fig. S21†), indicating its higher intrinsic per-site activity. In addition, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm tests (Fig. S22†) reveal a larger specific surface area of 47.42 m2 g−1 for 2D Mo2N–CoxN-5 than that of the CoxN sample (29.86 m2 g−1) and most Mo and Co-based catalysts, which is related to its porous and sheet-like structure.25 A large specific surface area can promote rapid mass transfer and also facilitate the exposure of active sites, which is also beneficial to improve the catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. S23,† the Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst has the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.575 s−1 at an overpotential of 100 mV in 1.0 M KOH, which is higher than those of CoxN (0.005 s−1), Mo2N–CoxN-5-0.5 (0.407 s−1), Mo2N–CoxN-5-2 (0.507 s−1), and Mo2N–CoxN-5-5 (0.397 s−1). The high TOF value means that the Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst has high intrinsic activity, which is responsible for the good HER performance. Fig. 5e and S24† show the Nyquist diagrams of the catalysts. It can be found that the semicircular diameter of Mo2N–CoxN-5 (corresponding to the charge transfer resistance Rct) is much smaller than those of all control samples. The lowest charge transfer resistance of Mo2N–CoxN-5 should be due to the strong interaction between Mo2N and CoxN that can significantly increase the electron transfer rate.52
A good catalyst for the HER should capture more electrons to promote the subsequent HER reaction. The work function (WF) can be used to estimate the ability of a catalyst to capture electrons. The WFs of Pt/C, CoxN and Mo2N–CoxN-5 are 5.634, 5.399, and 5.441 eV, respectively, calculated based on a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) test (Fig. S25†). The work function value of Mo2N–CoxN-5 is higher than that of CoxN and close to that of Pt/C, indicating its stronger ability to capture electrons. This strong ability enables the easy reduction of H* to H2 on 2D Mo2N–CoxN-5 heterojunction nanosheets, thus giving rise to enhanced HER activity.7 In brief, Mo2N–CoxN-5 has a low overpotential, high TOF, and small Tafel slope, and shows good HER activity standing at the forefront of non-self-supported noble metal-free HER catalysts (Table S3†). Besides their good activity, the Mo2N–CoxN-5 nanosheets also display good stability for the HER. As shown in Fig. 5f, the polarization curve of the 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst after 2000 consecutive CV cycles almost completely overlaps with the original one. The current density shows a negligible decrease for 48 h, further demonstrating its excellent catalytic stability for the HER in 1 M KOH (Fig. 5f). In contrast, the HER performance of the catalyst prepared without adding dopamine is significantly decreased after 2000 CV cycles (Fig. S26†). The result proves the positive role of the carbon layer in promoting the catalytic stability.53
CoxN-based materials are promising for catalyzing the OER.48 The construction of the heterojunction can enhance the activity benefiting the optimized electronic structure at the interface. Thus, the 2D Mo2N–CoxN-5 heterojunction is expected to be active for the OER. As shown in Fig. 6a and S27,† the 2D Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst only requires an overpotential of 247 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The overpotentials of CoxN, nickel foam, MoxN, RuO2, Mo2N–CoxN-4 and Mo2N–CoxN-6 are 285, 420, 300, 319, 271 and 310 mV, respectively (Fig. 6b and Table S4†). Fig. S28† displays the LSV curves of the catalysts with 90% IR compensation. In this case, the Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst requires low overpotentials of 231 and 323 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. It is obvious that the 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 sheet shows the best activity among the samples under different conditions. The improved OER activity of the Mo2N–CoxN-5 sheets should be ascribed to the appropriate nitridation degree and grain size. Also, the catalytic performance of the 2D Mo2N–CoxN-5 sheet is governed by the ratio of Mo2N and CoxN. The overpotential of 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 is also lower than those of Mo2N–CoxN-5-0.5 (265 mV), Mo2N–CoxN-5-2 (280 mV) and Mo2N–CoxN-5-5 (310 mV) (Fig. S29a†). The low ratio of Mo and Co sources can result in the formation of a smaller interface, thus affecting the catalytic activity. On the other hand, the high ratio of Mo/Co can facilitate greater coverage of the CoxN substrate, which is also not favorable for enhancing the activity. The performance of 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 is also superior to that of most reported non-noble metal OER catalysts, such as Co4N (330 mV),54 Co3O4/N–GN (310 mV),55 CoOx/FeOx (308 mV)56 and MoO3/Ni–NiO (320 mV)19 (Table S5†). Fig. 6c and S29b† show the Tafel slope of all of our catalysts for the OER. The Tafel slope of 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 is 105 mV dec−1, which is lower than those of CoxN (170 mV dec−1), Mo2N–CoxN-4 (131 mV dec−1), Mo2N–CoxN-6 (181 mV dec−1) and other catalysts, demonstrating the faster kinetics of Mo2N–CoxN-5 for water oxidation. As displayed in Fig. 6d, the Cdl values of Mo2N–CoxN-5, CoxN, Mo2N–CoxN-4 and Mo2N–CoxN-6 are 76.76, 51.57, 71.75 and 46.94 mF cm−2, respectively. Obviously, 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 has the largest Cdl value among all of our catalysts (Fig. S30 and S31†). The larger Cdl values and the higher current density from the ECSA-normalized LSV (Fig. S32†) suggest that the Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst has an obvious advantage in terms of active surface area and active sites over other catalysts. The Nyquist diagrams shown in Fig. 6e further prove the good ability for the transmission of electrons. Furthermore, the catalyst also possesses good stability for the OER as shown in Fig. 6f, like that for the HER. Typically, the LSV curve after 2000 CV cycles almost completely overlaps with the initial one, and the I–t curve shows no obvious change after the 48 h OER test.

Based on the good performance for the HER and OER, a two-electrode electrolyzer employing the bifunctional 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst as both the anode and cathode is assembled for overall water splitting. As shown in Fig. 6g, the Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst has excellent activity with a low cell voltage of 1.53 V to acquire a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is better than the cells assembled based on Pt–RuO2 and most reported catalysts (Table S6†).57,58 Additionally, the faradaic efficiency (FE) values are about 100% for the HER and 95% for the OER after 60 min of electrolysis (Fig. S33†). More importantly, the electrolytic cell shows good stability under a constant voltage of 1.53 V, and only shows a slight current change after 86 hours of operation (Fig. 6h). The XRD, XPS and TEM tests show the good morphological, structural and compositional stability of the Mo2N–CoxN catalyst towards the HER (Fig. S34†). In addition, the composition of the Mo2N–CoxN catalyst changes to a certain extent during the OER process. Series tests (Fig. S35†) show the formation of oxides, which is considered as the active species for the OER, consistent with many previous studies.59 A solar power assisted water splitting device was assembled by combining with a commercial solar panel (Fig. 6i). The electrolyzer can be driven by a 1.53 V solar cell, for which the obvious H2 and O2 bubbles are observed, implying its potential value for converting low-voltage electricity into chemical energy.
In order to further understand the good activity, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The Gibbs free-energy of adsorbed hydrogen atoms (ΔGH*) is considered as an important parameter to evaluate the HER activity. The small negative values of ΔGH* indicate strong chemical adsorption (making desorption difficult), while the large positive values of ΔGH* represent weak H* adsorption (making adsorption difficult). More positive or more negative ΔGH* is not favorable for the HER. For an optimal catalyst, |ΔGH*| should be awfully close to zero from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, which makes both H* desorption and adsorption easier and thus promotes the HER.60 Therefore, the Gibbs free energy of the chemically adsorbed H* on the surface of the catalysts was calculated. The optimized models of CoN, Mo2N cluster and CoN–Mo2N are shown in Fig. 7a and S36–S40.† As shown in Fig. 7b, the |ΔGH*| value for Mo2N–CoN at the Co-1-site at the interface is about 0.025 eV, which is much lower than that on the Co-2-site (0.031 eV), Mo-1-site (0.089 eV) and Mo-2-site (0.197 eV) of the Mo2N–CoN heterointerface, and much lower than that on the Mo2N cluster (0.339 eV, Mo-site) and CoN (0.752 eV, Co-site). The substantial decrease of ΔGH* on the Mo2N–CoN heterojunction (close to zero) demonstrates an optimized H* adsorption ability around the heterojunction. Xie's group have proven that the ΔGH* of the Ni3N–Co3N heterostructure (about 0.04 eV) is much closer to the ideal ΔGH* of 0 eV, thus giving more favorable H* adsorption kinetics at the heterojunction toward the HER.61 Many reviews also indicate that the closer the ΔGH* of the catalyst is to zero, the higher the HER activity of the catalyst.62,63 Therefore, the suitable ΔGH* of the Mo2N–CoN heterojunction indicates that the interfacial interaction between Mo2N and CoN in the heterojunction is favorable for the effective adsorption and activation of the reactant, thus promoting the HER kinetics. Also, the calculated density of states (DOS) from Fig. 7c suggests that the electronic states of Mo2N–CoN-5 were occupied with higher density around the Fermi level than those of Mo2N and CoN, which means enhanced electron mobility at the Mo2N–CoN-5 heterojunction. To further elucidate the interaction of the Mo2N cluster and CoN in the heterojunction catalysts, the difference in the electron density was also calculated (Fig. 7d and e). Significant charge redistribution in the Mo2N–CoN heterostructure occurred with obvious electron accumulation and depletion regions at the heterointerface. The charge redistribution is consistent with the XPS results, and is conducive to the adsorption/desorption of intermediates during the electrocatalytic reaction, thus enhancing the catalytic activity.

Conclusions
In summary, we have proven a novel strategy based on cutting ZIF-67 for synthesizing 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN heterojunctions for effective HER and OER. The size of the 2D nanosheets and the ratio of Mo/Co can be regulated by adjusting the synthetic parameters. The 2D porous Mo2N–CoxN heterostructures have combined advantages of the large accessible surface of the 2D nanosheets, the optimized electronic structure resulting from the electron redistribution at the heterointerface and enhanced mass-transport ability of the electrolyte along the pores, which contribute to the superior HER performance close to that of Pt/C and OER activity superior to that of RuO2, as well as good stability in 1 M KOH solution. The cell assembled based on the 2D Mo2N–CoxN-5 catalyst can be driven by a solar panel at low voltage to realize sustainable H2 evolution. The flexibility in the synthesis makes the strategy suitable to construct W (V) species modified 2D Co-based sheets with a tuned structure.
