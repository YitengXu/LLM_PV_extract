By adjusting the reaction temperature and the amounts of surfactant and reducing agent, CdTe NRs of 80 ± 30 nm in diameter and 300–500 nm in length were prepared. It was found that uniform CdTe NRs can be obtained by reacting 0.4 g PVP, 5.0 ml AAAS and 2 mL CdCl2·2.5H2O aqueous solution at 150 °C for 12 h. By assembling the CdTe NRs into photodetectors, a photocurrent of 2.51 μA and a responsivity of 0.106 A W−1 were obtained under the illumination of 650 nm pulsed incident light for a period of 120 s under 300 K, a laser power of 23.7 μW and bias voltage of +1.0 V. The rise time and decay time of the device were found to be 81 s and 84 s, respectively.
Introduction
In recent years, with the depletion of fossil fuels, the development of new energy technologies has attracted widespread attention from governments and researchers, including nuclear energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, and marine energy technologies, etc.1–3 Among them, solar energy technology has experienced rapid development in recent decades, because of breakthrough achievements in preparation technologies for fabricating various photoelectric materials and advanced devices.4–7 A solar cell, in which the p–n junction is the core component, is a device that can convert solar energy into electric energy. When the p–n junction is irradiated with sunlight, photons with higher energy than the semiconductor band gap are absorbed, and electron–hole pairs become excited in the material.8,9 In order to obtain high photoelectric conversion efficiencies, the preparation of solar cell materials with excellent performance is a key factor.
Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is a II–VI semiconductor material that is widely used in solar cells because of its suitable bandgap (1.45 eV at room temperature) and ultra-high optical absorption coefficient in the visible spectrum. Recently, CdTe thin-film solar cells produced by First Solar reached a record efficiency of 22.1%.10 In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to studying the photoelectric response of CdTe nanomaterials.11–14 Based on this, the effective preparation of CdTe nanomaterials of uniform sizes has been a focus of development in this field. At present, many preparation methods of CdTe nanomaterials have been reported, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), template-directed electro-deposition,15–20 hydrothermal synthesis,21–28 solvothermal synthesis,29–35 and so on. Hydrothermal and solvothermal methods are widely used in the preparation of many tellurium and telluride nanomaterials because of their simplicity. However, the preparation process of CdTe nanomaterials has become complicated because of the use of highly toxic compounds, high pressures and temperatures (usually over 200 °C) and complex multi-step methods.36–39
In this study, we prepared CdTe nanorods (NRs) through a one-pot PVP-assisted solvothermal method. The impacts of the reaction temperature and the amount of surfactant and reducing agent on the morphology of the products were assessed. In addition, the photoelectric properties of the CdTe NRs were tested. The results show that the photocurrent of the device can reach 2.51 μA and its responsivity can reach 0.106 A W−1 at room temperature.
Experimental
Reagents
The main reagents used in the solvothermal synthesis, including potassium tellurite (≥98%, K2TeO3, MW: 253.79), CdCl2·2.5H2O (≥99%, MW: 228.35), ethylene glycol (≥99.5%, (CH2OH)2, MW: 228.35), L-ascorbic acid (≥99%, C6H8O6, MW: 176.12) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K-30), were of analytical grade. They were commercially available from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. and were used in this study without further purification.
Synthesis of CdTe NRs
In a typical synthesis procedure for fabricating CdTe nanorods, 0.1523 g of K2TeO3 (0.6 mmol) was put into a beaker and dissolved in 30 mL of ethylene glycol (EG) under vigorous magnetic stirring at 80 °C to form a homogeneous solution. After dissolving 0.4 g of PVP in the solution, the heater was turned off and the solution was cooled to room temperature. Then 5.0 mL of L-ascorbic acid aqueous solution (AAAS, 1.2 M) was quickly added, along with 2 ml of CdCl2·2.5H2O solution (0.3 M), and the mixture was continuously stirred for 2 minutes. After this time, the color of the solution changed to light yellow. It should be noted that the stoichiometric ratio of Te to Cd was 1:1. Finally, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a volume capacity of 50 mL and maintained at 150 °C for 12 h. After the autoclave had cooled to room temperature naturally, the final dark-gray product was centrifuged, washed several times with acetone and absolute ethanol, respectively, and dispersed in 20 mL of absolute ethanol for storage.
Characterization
The sample was characterized using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The accelerating voltage was set at 40 kV, with a current of 40 mA and a scanning rate of 0.1° s−1 in the 2θ range from 20° to 80°. The morphology of the as-grown product was examined using a FESEM (Hitachi High Tech SU 8010) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (JEOL 2010F) operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The content of Cd and Te in the solution after reaction was analyzed using ICP-OES (Thermo iCAP 6000). The current–voltage characteristics were measured with a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200-SCS) and a 650 nm laser was employed as the light source. Pulsed incident light with a period of 120 s was used for all measurements of the photodetectors.
Results and discussion
To illustrate the morphology and phase composition of the product grown from the PVP-assisted solvothermal process in this study, the XRD pattern as well as the SEM image are shown in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1a, we can observe that the product comprises NRs with relatively uniform distributions of length and diameter. According to the SEM image and the diameter distribution analysis (inset in Fig. 1a), the length and diameter of the NRs are about 300–500 nm and 80 ± 30 nm, respectively. Furthermore, according to the XRD pattern of the product shown in Fig. 1b, all peaks can be indexed to the cubic phase of CdTe with a cell constant of a = 0.6483 nm, and there are no impurity peaks. The XRD data are in good agreement with the standard literature data (JCPDS card number: 03-065-0880). This means that cubic CdTe was obtained using the present synthetic method. However, the peak intensity ratios of the XRD pattern of Te NWs and that of a powder sample show significant differences, suggesting that the growth process of the nanorods has a preferred orientation. Furthermore, the ICP-OES experiment shows that the reaction yield is 93.71%.

Fig. 2 shows the structural characteristics of the products obtained from the PVP-assisted solvothermal process with 0.4 g PVP, 5.0 ml AAAS and 2 mL CdCl2·2.5H2O aqueous solution at 150 °C for 12 h. Fig. 2a shows the TEM image of the CdTe NRs, revealing that the diameter of the NRs is ∼55 nm. It was found that the outer region of the NRs is coated with amorphous sheaths. Fig. 2b shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image taken from the area marked with a rectangular box in Fig. 2a. It reveals that the as-prepared NRs are highly crystallized and defect-free. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2b clearly shows a lattice spacing of 0.374 nm, corresponding to the plane of (111). This result indicates that the CdTe NRs are perfect single crystals with a growth direction along [111]. The inset in Fig. 2b shows the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of a single CdTe NR.

Effect of PVP and AAAS
To illustrate the impact of PVP and AAAS on the morphology of the product, we performed several experiments with different amounts of PVP and AAAS, as shown in Fig. 3. In the study of the effect of PVP and AAAS, we fixed other reaction conditions to be the same as those detailed in the Experimental section: 2 mL CdCl2·2.5H2O aqueous solution at 150 °C for 12 h. We found that 0.4 g of PVP and 5 mL of AAAS were the optimized amounts for preparing uniformly sized CdTe NRs, as shown in Fig. 3b. When the amount of AAAS was kept constant and the amount of PVP was reduced, the ends of the nanorods were sharp and the diameter distribution was wide, as shown in Fig. 3a. However, the CdTe NRs were rough and agglomerated easily under the same conditions when the amount of PVP was increased, as shown in Fig. 3c. This means that the amount of PVP is a key factor in the solvothermal process. In our previous study, PVP was also found to play an important role in the preparation of Te nanowires, nanotubes and nanorods.40,41 PVP has been successfully used as a surfactant, stabilizer and structure-directing agent in the preparation of 1D nanostructures. As a surfactant, a small amount of PVP can be adsorbed on the surface of the crystal nucleus. An appropriate amount of PVP is beneficial to obtain nanomaterials with smooth surfaces and uniform sizes. Further increasing the amount of the PVP increases the viscosity of the solvent and hinders atom diffusion.42 Therefore, excessive PVP will lead to product agglomeration. The same morphology evolution trend can also be seen when the amount of AAAS is 2 mL, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. For the impact of AAAS on the morphology of CdTe NRs, we found that a disorganized product was obtained when AAAS was omitted, as shown in Fig. 3g–i. This indicates that the reduction ability of ethylene glycol alone is not enough to obtain uniformly sized CdTe NRs. From Fig. 3d–i, we can clearly see that there are large amounts of nanoparticles mixed in with the products. Therefore, we chose 5 mL of AAAS as the optimized condition.

All scale bars represent 500 nm. 
Effect of reaction temperature
According to our experimental results, it was found that the reaction temperature is also an important factor affecting the morphology of the product. To understand the effect of the reaction temperature, synthesis experiments were carried out at 120 °C (Fig. 4a) and 180 °C (Fig. 4b). In the experiments studying the effect of temperature, we fixed other reaction conditions to be the same as those detailed in the Experimental section: 0.4 g PVP, 5.0 ml AAAS and 2 mL CdCl2·2.5H2O aqueous solution for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 4a, we found a large amount of massive coarse particles in the product, and a small number of rod-shaped nanoparticles were wrapped into them or scattered around them. This means that it is difficult to prepare CdTe nanorods with macro and uniform sizes at low temperature, such as 120 °C. As is well known, low temperatures mean that the viscosity of the solution increases and the reduction rate from Te(IV) to Te(0) and growth rate of crystals decrease. Furthermore, lower temperatures are not conducive to the conversion of Te to CdTe. Therefore, if we want to get CdTe nanorods of uniform sizes, we need to experiment at a temperature higher than 120 °C. On the other hand, a reaction temperature that is too high is also detrimental to the preparation of CdTe nanorods. Although there is a large number of rod-shaped products and the amount of coarse particles is significantly reduced in the product obtained at 180 °C, the dispersion of these rod-shaped products is very poor, and many nanorods grow together at one end. Because higher temperatures mean that the viscosity of the solution decreases and the reduction rate from Te(IV) to Te(0) and growth rate of crystal increases, the conversion rate of Te to CdTe was also accelerated at higher temperature. All these phenomena can be attributed to the lower viscosity of the solvent at high temperature.

Photoelectrical properties of the CdTe NRs
The photoelectric properties of a photodetector based on CdTe NRs were measured by illuminating the whole device with a laser at room temperature, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. It should be noted that we could only obtain a very small current when the CdTe NRs in an alcohol dispersion were dropped directly on the interdigital electrode and dried at room temperature, even at a bias voltage of 5 V, due to the large resistivity of the device. However, we found that a microampere level current can be obtained when the device was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 1 h. Therefore, all devices used in this study were pre-treated in a vacuum oven. In this study, a laser with a wavelength of 650 nm was used as the light source. Fig. 5a shows the I–V curve of CdTe NRs in dark. The linear behavior of the I–V curve indicates reliable ohmic contact between the CdTe NRs and integrated electrodes.

(b) Time-dependent photocurrent response to 650 nm pulsed incident light with a period of 120 s under 300 K, laser power of 23.7 μW and bias voltages of +1.0 V. 
CdTe is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of ∼1.45 eV at room temperature. Light illumination with energy greater than the band gap will generate electron–hole pairs in CdTe NRs. Under the action of an applied electric field, the electrons and holes will move to opposite electrodes, resulting in photocurrent, as shown in Fig. 5b. According to Fig. 5b, the photodetector based on CdTe NRs exhibited an obvious optoelectronic signal and excellent stability under a bias voltage of +1.0 V. When the device was exposed to light illumination with a wavelength of 650 nm, the current output was enhanced, because a large number of electron–hole pairs were generated in the CdTe NRs and moved under the electric field. The photocurrent ΔI, defined as the current difference between the laser irradiation (Ip) and dark (Id) conditions, was 2.51 μA at a bias voltage of +1.0 V under irradiation at 23.7 μW. The responsivity of the device, an important characteristic of a photodetector, can usually be calculated using the equation RI = ΔI/P, where ΔI is the photocurrent representing the current difference between laser irradiation (Ip) and dark (Id) conditions, and P is laser power irradiated on the photodetector. The responsivity of the CdTe NRs in this study can reach 0.106 A W−1 at a bias voltage of +1.0 V.
By further analyzing one of the response cycles in Fig. 5b, we could obtain the response time. The response time of photodetectors is usually based on the rise time and decay time. The rise time, defined as the time needed for the current to reach 63% of the maximum value, is about 81 s, while the decay time, defined as the time taken for the current to reach 37% of the maximum value of photocurrent, is about 84 s. This relatively long response time is mainly due to long-chain organic molecules coated on the surface of the CdTe NRs and the electrode spacing being far larger than the size of the nanorods, which reduces the effective transport of photogenerated carriers and improves the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs. Therefore, identifying methods to remove the long-chain organic compounds on the surface of the nanorods, or replace them with short-chain organic ligands, is key to improve the response performance of these devices. Research in this area is in progress and some results have been achieved.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized uniform CdTe NRs using a one-pot PVP-assisted solvothermal process under mild conditions. By adjusting the reaction temperature and the amounts of surfactant and reducing agent, CdTe NRs of 80 ± 30 nm in diameter and 300–500 nm in length were prepared. It was found that uniform CdTe NRs can be obtained by reacting 0.4 g PVP, 5.0 ml AAAS and 2 mL CdCl2·2.5H2O aqueous solution at 150 °C for 12 h.
By assembling CdTe NRs into photodetectors, a photocurrent of 2.51 μA and a responsivity of 0.106 A W−1 were obtained under illumination of 650 nm pulsed incident light for a period of 120 s under 300 K, with a laser power of 23.7 μW and bias voltage of +1.0 V. The rise time and decay time of the device were 81 s and 84 s, respectively.
