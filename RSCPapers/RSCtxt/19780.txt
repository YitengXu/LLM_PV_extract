    , Accepted 20th October 2014First published on 20th October 2014AbstractCaCuSi4O10 (CCS4O) shows a 430–800 nm broad excitation band and an intense 918 nm near-infrared (NIR) emission peak at room temperature (RT). The electronic structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) is discussed in an attempt to understand the small quenching effects in this highly concentrated Cu2+ material, which may be ascribed to the localization of 3d electrons of Cu2+ ion and weak interaction between Cu2+ ions. The assignments of photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) peaks are made based on the absorption spectrum and crystal field theory. In particular, we investigate the temperature-dependent PL spectra upon excitation by monochromatic light and simulated sunlight. The distinct variation in PL intensities with temperature upon the two means of excitation can be understood by configurational coordinate (CC) models, in which different thermal activation energies are considered. Furthermore, Ba2+-doped and Zn2+-doped series are used to illustrate the relation between the redshift of the PL peak and lattice expansion. The high thermal quenching temperature (555 K) and low concentration quenching (unchanged lifetimes when diluting Cu2+ ions) indicate that this phosphor has great potential as an inorganic dye for luminescent solar concentrator (LSC).
1. Introduction
The capacity of photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight to electricity makes them meet the long-term worldwide energy demand. However, at present, the contribution of photovoltaic energy is limited due to its relatively high cost per kilowatt-hour.1 For this reason, lowering the production cost or increasing the conversion efficiency is considered as the method to achieve wide application of photovoltaic cells.2–4 A luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) generally consists of a highly transparent polymer sheet doped with luminescent dyes and attached solar cells on the edges of the sheet. These organic dyes absorb incident sunlight and then give a red-shifted emission, a part of which will finally reach the solar cells on the edges through internal reflection.5–10 Due to the use of smaller solar cells and no need for expensive tracking, LSC has been considered as an alternative approach to lower the cost of photovoltaics. However, the development of LSC was initially limited by the large re-absorption losses owing to a significant overlap of the absorption and emission of the luminescent dyes5,7,8,10,11 and their poor stability under solar irradiation.7,10,12,13 Moreover, the visible emissions from these dyes do not match the band gap of attached Si solar cells (SSCs), resulting in the excess energy of the high-energy photons dissipated as heat.1,6–8,10
CaCuSi4O10 (CCS4O, Egypt blue), a well-known blue pigment from the Egyptian Empire Age with excellent chemical stability, features 430–800 nm ultra-broadband absorption and 920 nm NIR emission.14–16 The large Stoke shift between absorption and emission wavelengths would minimize the re-absorption losses for a CCS4O-containing LSC device. In addition, the 920 nm emission is slightly larger than the band gap of SSCs, which ensures near-unity conversion efficiency without excessive thermalization losses.17 Furthermore, a transparent matrix could be prepared with nanocrystal powders dissolved in polymers or glasses with good optical performance.18,19 For instance, through mixing Y3Al5O12:Er3+,Tm3+ powders and glass-forming raw materials and using the melting-quenching method, functional Y3Al5O12:Er3+,Tm3+ crystallites can be introduced into tellurate glasses forming glass ceramics with transparency.19 Analogously, it is possible to achieve a transparent LSC device via melting CCS4O phosphors into some kind of transparent glass, designed following the rules that the refraction index of glass is equivalent to that of CCS4O and the particle size of the CCS4O phosphor is small enough. Thus, CCS4O may be considered a good candidate for the inorganic luminescent dyes for LSC, provided that its thermal quenching properties are good enough under long-term exposure to sunlight. However, detailed investigations about the optical properties of CCS4O under ambient and high temperatures are still lacking. Moreover, it remains unknown why CCS4O exhibits outstanding luminescence even though the luminescent active center Cu2+ is highly concentrated.
Here, the electronic structure of CCS4O is studied by DFT to give possible reasons for the strong NIR emission of the highly concentrated Cu2+ system. The assignment of optical transitions is discussed according to crystal field theory. The temperature-dependent PL properties of as-prepared CCS4O phosphor stimulated by different monochromatic lights and simulated sunlight are investigated in detail. The PL behavior of Ba2+-doped and Zn2+-doped samples is also investigated to further understand the PL behavior of CCS4O.
2. Experimental and calculation details
Undoped, Ba-doped and Zn-doped CCS4O powder samples were synthesized by a conventional high-temperature solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric proportions of initial materials CaCO3, CuO, SiO2, BaCO3 and ZnO (analytical reagent) with 3 wt% Na2CO3 as fluxing agent were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar; subsequently, the mixture was repeatedly sintered at 950 °C for 5 h three times in air with several intermediate grinding steps.
The phase purities of the samples were identified by means of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips PW1830), using a graphite monochromator and Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. XRD data for Rietveld refinement was collected on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 ADVANCE) with a Cu target and a Ni filter. The step-scan mode was used with a setup of 40 kV × 40 mA, step 0.01°, 0.2 s per step. Rietveld refinement was conducted using the TOPAS-Academic program. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were taken with a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000) using polytetrafluoroethylene as a standard reference. We characterized normal PLE and PL spectra and fluorescence lifetime with a luminescence spectrometer (Edinburgh FLS920) at room temperature (RT). A continuous 450 W xenon lamp was used as an excitation source for PLE and PL spectra. Moreover, fluorescence decay spectra were determined with a microsecond μF900 xenon lamps as the excitation source. All of the fluorescence measurements were performed on a liquid nitrogen cooled NIR sensitive photomultiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu R5509-72). The thermal quenching properties of CCS4O are investigated through another luminescence spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon TRIAX320) equipped with a TAP-02 high-temperature accessory instrument (Tian Jin Orient-KOJI Instrument Co., Ltd, China) and a NIR PMT (Hamamatsu R5108). In this system, monochromatic excitation was produced on a continuous 450 W xenon lamp equipped with a monochromator, and simulated sunlight (Nbet, Solar-500) equipped with certain short-pass filters is used for continuous sunlight excitation, which only allows 430–800 nm wavelength light (matching well with the absorption range of CCS4O) to pass through.
First-principles calculations for CCS4O were performed using the CASTEP (Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package) software package,20 which is based on DFT. The 64-atom tetragonal ICSD #2650221 structure model (space group P4/ncc, no. 130) was used as the initial model. The initial cell parameters are a = b = 7.30(1) Å, c = 15.12(2) Å. A geometry optimization by the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method was performed on the model.20 For the calculations, a plane-wave basis set with the cut-off energy Ecut = 440 eV was chosen for expansion of valence-electron wavefunctions. The exchange-correlation functional was selected as local spin-polarized density approximation (LSDA). The criterion for self-consistency (SCF) was eigenenergy convergence within 10−9 eV per atom. The k-point set was set as a 6 × 6 × 3 Monkhorst-Pack grid (reciprocal spacing ∼0.02 Å−1) and the ultrasoft pseudopotential was constructed from the CASTEP database. For the geometry optimization, the convergence criterion was set as absolute net force within 10−3 eV Å−1. Then the electronic band structure of the optimized structure was calculated with the same electronic SCF parameters. During the calculations, a Hubbard U = 2.5 eV for 3d electrons of Cu was applied.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure, band structure and optical properties at RT

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of as-grown CCS4O phosphor; all of the diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the standard CaCuSi4O10 powder diffraction data (JCPDS no. 01-074-0828). The Rietveld refinement of CCS4O21 XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 1b. The crystal structure of CCS4O is tetragonal with space group P4/ncc, and its lattice constants according to the refinement are a = b = 7.30(6) Å, c = 15.13(2) Å, and cell volume V = 807.6(9) Å3. Si-centered tetrahedra, parallel to (001), are linked to form two Si8O20 sheets within the height of one cell, and each tetrahedron has one unshared corner.21 The Cu atom sites with D4h symmetry are at the centers of squares formed by four oxygens from the unshared corners, which is shown in the inset of Fig. 1b; such coordination is super-stable and characteristic of divalent Cu.21 The Ca atoms are situated in 8-fold coordination midway between sheets. The fragment of the CCS4O crystal structure viewed along the a axis is shown in Fig. 1c.

Fig. 2a shows the band structure and projected density of states (DOS) of CCS4O. A direct band gap of 3.65 eV is obtained at the G point in the Brillouin zone for the spin-down eigenstate (Beta). As seen from the total DOS of CCS4O, as well as the atomic partial DOS for the Ca, Cu, Si and O atoms in Fig. 2b, the main contribution to the top of the valence band comes from the Cu 3d orbital hybridized with O 2p, whereas the bottom of the conduction band is mainly formed from Cu 3p and Ca 4s orbitals. The subbands with distinctly opposite spin state (alpha) located above the Fermi energy level and the gap of ∼1.6 eV is derived from strong repulsion among the 3d electrons of the Cu2+ ion, which suggests that the 3d electrons of the Cu2+ ion are localized and the quenching effect might be small even at high Cu2+ concentrations in this material. The subbands are closely correlated with the optical behavior of CCS4O and it can be deduced that the electronic transitions between these subbands are spin forbidden with a relatively long decay lifetime.

The PLE spectrum of CCS4O, including a 440–720 nm broad band (deconvoluted into two separated Gaussian peaks at 536 nm and 621 nm), a 648 nm hybridized peak and a small peak at 764 nm, matches well with the absorption spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. It should be noted that the 630 nm absorption peak represents the average value of the 621 nm and 648 nm excitation peaks due to the insensitivity of absorption measurement. In addition, the strong 230 nm absorption peak should correspond to the optical band gap of CCS4O, which is larger than the calculated value. This may result from the calculation underestimating the band gap by about 30–50%.22Fig. 3c presents the emission spectra upon excitation at 621 nm, and an intense broadband NIR emission peak at 918 nm can be observed. The lifetime curve is shown in the inset of Fig. 3c, which can be fitted by single-exponential decay with a lifetime of 142 μs. The above results are consistent with the previous reports, based on which the PLE and PL peaks are all attributed to the d–d transitions of copper(II) ions (Cu2+).14,15 However, the detailed assignments of these peaks were not discussed. In order to get a comprehensive understanding of the spectroscopic properties, a reasonable assignment is presented based on the absorption spectrum and crystal field theory.

The energy levels of the Cu2+ ion in tetragonally distorted octahedral symmetry are determined from the crystal field Hamiltonian H given as follows:23 H = HF + νR + ν0 + νT(1)where HF is the Hamiltonian for the free ion, νR corresponds to the replacement of the six ligands by a spherically symmetric field, ν0 reflects the existence of the six negatively charged ligands located at the vertices of the octahedron and νT is the tetragonal perturbation. Ascribed to the fact that d orbitals could only accommodate 10 electrons, the Cu2+ ion with d9 electrons (considered as one “positive” electron) behaves like the ions with a d1 electron with an inverse energy level sequence. When a Cu2+ ion locates at an octahedral coordination environment (Oh symmetry), its free ion energy state would be split into two energy levels T2g + Eg according to group theory. Then the T2g level would be further split into E′g + B2g levels, whereas Eg would be split into A1g + B1g levels when the coordination symmetry lowers to D4h. The splitting energy levels of a Cu2+ ion with increasing distortion are illustrated in Fig. 4. Moreover, a significant effect of the spin–orbit coupling upon the spectrum of the Cu2+ complex is expected due to the large spin–orbit coupling constant λ, therefore the E′g energy level keeps on splitting into two sublevels; the formulas for the five energy levels can be expressed as follows:24 Eo = 6Dq − 2Ds − 6Dt(2) (3) (4) (5) Es = 6Dq + 2Ds − Dt(6)where the parameters Dq, Ds and Dt are referred to as the octahedral, second- and fourth-order tetragonal field parameters, respectively. The energy differences between the excited states (Eo, Ec, Eb, Ea) and the ground state Es correspond to the energies of the d–d transition bands, which can be obtained from the optical absorption spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3a. The four absorption peaks are named J1, J2, J3 and J4 in the order of low energy to high energy (the 630 nm absorption peak equals the average value of J2 and J3), therefore the above equations can be written as follows: J4 = −4Ds − 5Dt(7) (8) J1 = −10Dq (in the limit λ → 0)(9)

The estimated Ds = −3063 cm−1, Dt = −1281 cm−1 and Dq = −1309 cm−1, and they satisfy the relation of , which corresponds to the energy level splitting for Cu2+ in the most tetragonally distorted octahedral crystal field environment, treated as square-planar symmetry D4h.24 It was noticed that there is a deviation between the calculated and real values because of the ignored spin–orbit coupling constant λ, which is actually large (−803 cm−1).24 However, the splitting gap between Ec and Eb levels, according to the absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 3a, is about 670 cm−1, which is at the same magnitude as the spin–orbit coupling constant λ (−803 cm−1) and considerably smaller than the crystal field splitting 10Dq ∼ 103900 cm−1. Therefore, the abovementioned rough calculation can still lead to reasonable assignment of the PLE and PL peaks, labeled as shown in Fig. 3b and c. Such kind of calculation method has been applied to a Cu2+-doped Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O crystal, in which Cu2+ ions substitute for Mg2+ ions and possess only square-planar symmetry D4h, similar to that of Cu2+ ions in the CCS4O lattice.24
3.2 High-temperature spectra under monochromatic light excitation

Fig. 5a shows the high-temperature spectra upon excitation at 764 nm. With increasing temperature from RT to 573 K, the emission intensity increases gradually at the beginning, then starts to decline at a point exceeding 475 K. Moreover, the emission peak redshifts from 914 nm to 960 nm and the FWHM (full width at half maximum) is broadened, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5a. The temperature-induced tendency is reversible when cooling down. The high-temperature spectra excited with three other PLE wavelengths (536 nm, 621 nm and 648 nm) show similar tendencies.
 Fig. 5  Temperature-dependent PL spectra of CCS4O upon 764 nm excitation and the inset shows the relative peak position and FWHM (a); schematic configurational coordinate diagram of temperature-dependent PL intensity (b). 
At high temperatures, the population density of phonons increases, and the electron–phonon interaction is dominant, consequently the FWHM of emission spectra is broadened.25–28 In general, the emission peak shifts to lower energy with increasing temperature, which can be explained by the semi-empirical Varshni equation:26–28 (10)where E(T) is the energy difference between the excited states and ground states at temperature T, E0 is the energy difference at 0 K, and a and b are Varshni coefficients. On the other hand, the shift of the emission band with temperature depends on the crystal field strength Δ, which in turn is a function of the distance R between the absorption center and the ligands. Moreover, R is a function of the temperature through the expansion coefficient of materials: R(T) = R(0) (1 + αT), where α ∼ 10−5 is the linear expansion coefficient. Therefore,29 (11)
An expansion of the crystal lattice reduces the crystal field strength, which will induce a splitting of degenerate excited or ground states, and then result in the redshift of emission peaks with increasing temperature.26 The relation between lattice expansion and emission redshift will be discussed in detail later.
As the temperature increases, a decrease in the luminescence intensity is expected, due to the enhancement of the probabilities of multiphonon relaxation and energy transfer for quenching the emitting levels.26,29 The abnormal increase in the emission intensity at the beginning can be explained by the configurational coordinate (CC) diagram, as shown in Fig. 5b. After the 764 nm excitation, electrons first relax to the equilibrium configuration of the Ea state through vibrational relaxation; from this level, the system returns to the ground state and gives 914 nm emission via (I), which dominates at RT. As the temperature subsequently rises, thermally activated electrons are pumped from the Ea level to a higher sublevel E′a with the assistance of phonons in the CCS4O host and then electrons return to the ground state via (I). Moreover, the probability of non-radiative transition decreases because the energy barrier ΔE (the energy difference between the crossing point S and the bottom of the excited state) becomes larger (ΔE1 < ΔE2).30–33 However, with further increasing temperature, the vibrational energy makes the excited electrons reach the S2 point and then relax to the ground state non-radiatively along the route of S2 → S1 → Ro, resulting in the thermal quenching of luminescence. The explanation of this trend is demonstrated by Fig. 6a, in which the intensity maximum appears at a higher temperature for the sample excited by longer wavelength light. That is, a larger ΔE would result in a higher thermal quenching temperature. The emission intensities upon 536 nm, 621 nm and 648 nm excitations show similar tendencies as 764 nm excitation, because the electrons excited by higher energy light would first relax to the lowest excited state Ea in CCS4O.
 Fig. 6  Different receding rates of high-temperature PL intensities upon excitations at 536 nm, 621 nm and 764 nm (a) and the relative configurational coordinate model is presented in (b). 
However, it is noteworthy that the endpoint of the normalized PL intensity is lowest for ex536, medial for ex621 (ex648 nm is similar to ex621) and highest for ex764, which means the different receding rates for the three excitations: ex536 > ex621 > ex764, as illustrated in Fig. 6a. This kind of varying receding rates can be well understood via the CC model presented in Fig. 6b. At RT, the excited electrons in Eo and Ec states relax to the equilibrium configuration of the Ea state non-radiatively through intersection points S1 and S2, respectively, denoted as (I), then give 914 nm emission via another process (II). At a temperature high enough, the electrons in Eo, Ec and Ea states are thermally activated to S3, S4 and S5, respectively, and then they return to the ground state, presented as (III). It can be seen that the energy barrier decreases gradually in the order ΔE1 > ΔE2 > ΔE3, due to the increased Stokes shift.28 This should result in a gradually decreasing probability of non-radiative transition from the excited state to the ground state following the sequence Eo > Ec > Ea. Therefore, this causes the fastest drop in the emission intensity from Eo excited state, next is from Ec excited state and emission from Ea excited state has slowest decay rate.
3.3 High-temperature spectra under simulated sunlight excitation
As mentioned above, the large Stokes shift resulted in negligible re-absorption in the process of photon propagation, and a suitable emission wavelength for best-matching the photoresponse of SSC possibly make this phosphor a good candidate as an inorganic dye in LSC. Long-term exposure to sunlight requires remarkable thermal stability for daily use, thus it is more important to investigate its thermal properties under sunlight excitation.

Fig. 7a shows the transmission spectrum of simulated sunlight, which yields 430–800 nm transmission after being equipped with appropriate optical filters. It can be seen that the simulated excitation source covers the strongest solar irradiation area when compared with the standard solar spectrum. Fig. 7b gives the PL spectrum upon excitation by this simulated sunlight, which features 800–1100 nm broadband emission with center at 918 nm, similar to the PL spectrum under monochromatic light excitation. This indicates that the same emission center (Cu2+) is activated by different excitation systems. Moreover, significantly enhanced PL intensity should be expected because more excitation power is utilized under the broadband excitation.
 Fig. 7  Transmission spectrum of simulated sunlight and standard AM 1.5 global spectrum (a); PL spectra upon excitation by simulated sunlight (430–800 nm) (b). 
The temperature-dependent PL spectrum under 430–800 nm excitation is shown in Fig. 8a. Similar to the monochromatic light excitation, the emission peak red shifts from 918 nm to 960 nm and its FWHM gradually broadens because of increased electron–phonon interaction at higher temperatures,28 shown in inset of Fig. 8a. However, the PL intensity keeps reducing as the temperature increases from RT to 573 K, as depicted in Fig. 8b. The thermal quenching temperature T50, at which the emission intensity is 50% of its original value,34 can be evaluated to be about 555 K. These facts reveal that CCS4O phosphor yields intense luminescence with the wavelength matching the band gap of SSC. Moreover, the luminescence maintains good thermal stability under simulated sunlight excitation. Combined with its outstanding chemical stability as the ancient pigment,14–16 this kind of material should have great potential as an inorganic dye in LSC.
 Fig. 8  Temperature-dependent PL spectra of CCS4O upon excitation by simulated sunlight and the relative peak position and FWHM are shown in the inset (a); temperature-dependent PL intensity under sunlight excitation is presented in (b) and the inset shows the plot of ln(I0/IT − 1) versus 1/kT; The relative configurational coordinate model is given in (c). 
The thermal activation energy (ΔE) for the Cu2+ emission is determined by measuring the temperature-dependent PL intensity, which can be described by a modified Arrhenius equation as follows:26,29,31,34–36 (12)where I0 is the initial emission intensity, IT is the intensity at different temperatures, c is a constant for a certain host, ΔE is the activation energy (the energy required to raise the electron from the relaxed excited level into the host lattice conduction band), k is the Boltzmann constant (8.629 × 10−5 eV K−1), and T is the temperature (K). The inset of Fig. 8b shows the plot of ln[(I0/IT) − 1] versus 1/kT. According to the equation, the activation energy ΔE is calculated to be ∼0.55 eV. The relatively high activation energy confirms the high quenching temperature.
Compared with the monochromatic light excitation, the different tendency in PL intensity under broadband sunlight excitation could also be explained by the CC model in Fig. 8c. 430–800 nm excitation should simultaneously stimulate all of the splitting excitation energy levels of Cu2+, which intersect with the ground state at S1, S2, …… Sn, corresponding to the activation energy ΔE1, ΔE2, …… ΔEn. The photoexcited electrons finally relax non-radiatively to the equilibrium configuration of the Ea state and return to the ground state with 918 nm emission via (I) at RT. With increasing temperature, the thermal phonon-assisted transition makes these electrons in the excited state cross the relative intersection points to return to the ground state non-radiatively, shown as (II). No higher energy levels at non-equilibrium state are available to accumulate the thermally activated electrons when the electrons excited by 430–800 nm radiation populate all of the excited levels, thus the PL intensity keeps reducing.
3.4 Red shift of emission peak and the concentration quenching
In order to make a comprehensive analysis of the redshift of the emission, we select isovalent ions with a larger radius (Ba2+) to substitute for Ca2+ cations, which may induce a change in the crystal field environment around Cu2+ ions, thus causing the shift in emission wavelength. On another side, Zn2+ ions with similar ionic radius are expected to substitute for Cu2+ without changing the crystal field environment significantly. For CCS4O:Ba2+, a second phase BaCuSi4O10 starts to form when Ba doping exceeds the solid solubility (x = 0.1); however, the solid solubility of Zn2+ ions is less than 0.3 in the Zn-doped CCS4O series, as shown in Fig. 9a. The calculated lattice parameters are given in Fig. 9b; for CCS4O:Ba2+, the c value shows a gradual increase with increasing Ba2+ doping; however, it almost remains constant with Zn2+ doping in CCS4O:Zn2+. There is no clear change in the a value for these two series. This indicates that lattice expansion mainly happens to the c-axis in CCS4O:Ba2+ and Zn2+ doping hardly changes the crystal field environment around Cu2+. Furthermore, the lattice expansion should produce weaker crystal field strength around Cu2+ ions, according to eqn (11). Moreover, a gradual redshift of the emission peak and decrease in its lifetime are observed in Fig. 9c, which means that such a kind of lattice expansion is possibly related to the redshift in emission wavelength. The reduced emission lifetime may be ascribed to the higher possibility of energy transfer from activated ions to defects in the expansible lattice combined with the result of decreased emission intensity.37,38 The PL and lifetime spectra of CCS4O:Zn2+ are presented in Fig. 9d; no evident changes happen to the peak position and lifetime with increasing Zn2+ ion doping, which may be ascribed to the unchanged crystal field environment around Cu2+ after being replaced by ions with a similar radius. The result further confirms the relationship between the redshift in the emission peak and the lattice expansion. We may attribute the increased emission intensity in the Zn-doped series (x ≤ 0.02) to the flux effect of ZnO.29,39 The invariable emission lifetime with increasing Zn2+ doping contents may indicate inefficient energy transfer processes among Cu2+ ions,29 which could interpret the fact of insignificant concentration quenching in this highly concentrated Cu2+ material.

4. Conclusion
As-grown CCS4O phosphor yields intense broadband excitation covering 430–800 nm and 918 nm emission at RT; the assignment of excitation peaks is based on the absorption spectrum and crystal field theory. The negligible concentration quenching effect may be ascribed to the localization of 3d electrons of Cu2+ ions and weak interaction between Cu2+ ions in this material, according to calculation results. Temperature-dependent PL intensities detected by different monochromatic light excitations are observed to increase first and then drop, which can be explained by the CC model. Moreover, the different receding rates of emission intensities are ascribed to the various activation energies of the excited states. Furthermore, we investigate the thermal stability utilizing simulated sunlight. The exhibited decline in PL intensity should result from non-availability of higher non-equilibrium excited states in the excitation range. Finally, the lattice expansion may also account for the redshift in the emission besides the normal emission redshift with temperature. The good thermal stability and low concentration quenching make this phosphor a great candidate as an inorganic dye in LSC.
