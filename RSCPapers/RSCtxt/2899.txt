    , Accepted 4th September 2016First published on 5th September 2016AbstractThe development of active, robust, and nonprecious electrocatalysts for both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) is highly crucial and challenging. Herein, ultrafine Co2P nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet/carbon nanotube hybrids are prepared via a straightforward pyrolysis method. Impressively, the hybrids exhibit remarkable catalytic performance for both the OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH solution, with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at low over-potentials of 280 mV for the OER and 154 mV for the HER, respectively. More importantly, when fabricated as an alkaline electrolyzer, the hybrids afford 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.64 V with strong stability, rivalling the integrated performance of a commercial IrO2 and Pt catalyst couple. The achieved ultrahigh catalytic performance can be attributed to the nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped carbon nanosheets, carbon-encapsulated ultrafine Co2P NPs, high conductivity of incorporated carbon nanotubes, large surface area (199.94 m2 g−1), interpenetrated macro-/mesoporous structure, and the strong synergistic effect among these factors.
Introduction
The increasing energy demands and environmental concerns resulting from fossil fuel depletion have stimulated intense research in developing sustainable energy from renewable resources.1 Electrochemical water splitting, a combination of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the cathode, is an efficient and clean technology to produce high purity hydrogen fuel.2 Precious metal oxides (i.e., RuO2 and IrO2) and metal Pt have been explored as excellent catalysts for the OER and HER, respectively, while their large-scale industrial application is restricted by the prohibitive cost, scarce reserves, and poor durability.3 Currently, a series of robust catalysts have been established for either the OER or HER, for example, many nonprecious OER catalysts based on transition metal oxides/hydroxides function well in alkaline electrolytes;4–7 transition metal sulfides,8,9 selenides,10,11 carbides,12,13 and phosphides14,15 have shown promising HER catalytic performance in acidic electrolytes. However, to meet the practical application, the OER and HER should be carried out in alkaline electrolytes based on a single catalyst to achieve overall water splitting.16–19 Therefore, it is technologically important and urgently needed to develop a versatile bifunctional catalyst with satisfactory performance for both the OER and HER in alkaline media. The research based on such a thought has been proposed but is still in its infancy stage, and the corresponding catalytic systems have been scarcely reported thus far.
Recently, cobalt-based phosphides with different morphologies such as nanoparticles (NPs), nanowires, and nanosheets as well as films have received considerable attention as candidates for both the OER and HER.20–23 However, their poor conductivity and a lack of redox site availability hinder their further application. To eliminate the restrictions of such materials, several strategies have been employed, such as fabricating nanostructured cobalt-based phosphides on conductive substrates (like carbon nanotubes, CNTs),14,24 yet the biggest issue is that they are easily peeled off from the substrate surface during long-term electrochemical reactions, thus leading to inferior stability. Recently, heteroatom doped porous carbonaceous materials have attracted widespread attention because of their prominent electrochemical and structural properties.25–27 Encapsulating cobalt-based phosphides into porous carbon structures can resolve the aforementioned problems. The current prevailing strategy for manufacturing such materials is the high temperature pyrolysis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by phosphidation.28–31 Although significant success has been achieved, there are still various inherent problems: (i) it suffers from complex operation and time-consuming fabrication as well as high cost; (ii) it probably leads to the collapse of the porous structure, resulting in insufficient and non-uniform exposure of the active catalytic sites of the products; (iii) the resulting products are only nitrogen-doped carbonaceous materials, while recent studies have demonstrated that codoping carbons with nitrogen and other heteroatoms can significantly improve their catalytic performance owing to the synergistic effects between the heteroatoms by introducing larger asymmetrical spin and charge density relative to single doping.32–34 For the above reasons, the production of cobalt-based phosphides encapsulated in dual heteroatom-doped carbonaceous materials still remains a great challenge, and very few studies have succeeded in fabricating such materials with prominent activity and stability for overall water splitting in basic electrolytes.
Here we report, for the first time, the synthesis of ultrafine Co2P NPs encapsulated in N, P dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet/CNT hybrids by copyrolyzing glucose, urea, phosphoric acid, and Co(NO3)3·6H2O as well as CNTs. During the pyrolysis process, glucose, urea, and phosphoric acid are transformed into N, P dual-doped carbon nanosheets, which in situ encapsulate simultaneously formed ultrafine Co2P NPs, resulting in the robust stability and the strong interaction between the Co2P NPs and carbon nanosheets. In addition, CNTs are incorporated into carbon nanosheets, not only act as circuits for fast electron transfer, but also as spacers to create space for effective transport of reactants. Moreover, the special architecture can help with their excellent structural rigidity to prevent aggregation and significantly enhance their durability. Based on the above reasons, the resulting catalyst (denoted as Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs) exhibits high activity and stability toward both the OER and HER in alkaline electrolytes (1.0 M KOH), affording a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at over-potentials of 280 mV for the OER and 154 mV for the HER, respectively. Moreover, when Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs is used as an electrocatalyst for both the anode and cathode in an overall water electrolyzer, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.64 V and long-term durability (25 h) were achieved, thus behaving as a versatile electrode for efficient overall water splitting.
Material preparation
Reagents and materials
High-purity multi-walled CNTs (diameters: 30–50 nm, lengths: 0.5–2 μm) were obtained from Chengdu Organic Chemicals and used without pretreatment. Nafion (0.5 wt%) and IrO2 (99.99%, metal basis) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. The commercial Pt catalyst (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72) and other chemicals were obtained from Aladdin Industrial Inc (Shanghai, China). All chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and directly used as supplied. Ultra-pure water (18 MΩ cm) was used throughout all experiments.
Synthesis of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs
Typically, 10 g of urea, 0.5 g of glucose, 0.6 g of phosphoric acid (H3PO4), 0.2 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 100 mg of CNTs were dispersed in 100 mL of ultrapure water solution, followed by sonication for 10 min. Afterwards, the obtained mixture was stirred at 80 °C to remove water. Subsequently, the resulting solid powder was distributed on a porcelain boat and then transferred at the center of a horizontal quartz tube and heated up from room temperature to 800 °C with a rate of 3 °C min−1 for 2 h under an Ar flow (∼25 mL min−1). Finally, after cooling to room temperature naturally, the sample was subjected to an ultrasonic exfoliation process and washed with water to remove impurities and unstable composition, and then dried in a vacuum oven, yielding the final product Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs. The weight percentage of Co in Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs, as determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis, was 13.3 wt%.
Synthesis of Co2P@N, P-PCN
Co2P@N, P-PCN (without CNTs) was prepared through the same procedure except for no addition of CNTs.
Synthesis of physically mixed Co2P@N, P-PCN + CNTs
The synthesized Co2P@N, P-PCN was physically mixed with CNTs by strong sonication treatment to realize a very good dispersion and interaction between Co2P@N, P-PCN and CNTs, yielding physically mixed Co2P@N, P-PCN + CNTs. The Co content in mixed Co2P@N, P-PCN + CNTs was controlled to be equal to that in Co2P@N, P-PCN-CNTs (∼13 wt%).
Physicochemical characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a FEI (TecnaiTM F30, USA) microscope, equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX, TECNAI G2, USA) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on a Hitachi S-4800 (Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan) under high vacuum with an accelerating voltage of 7 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a powder X-ray diffractometer at 40 kV and 15 mA using Cu-Kα radiation (Philips X'pert Pro MPD, the Netherlands). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained using an ESCALAB210 (VG, UK) XPS spectrometer equipped with an Mg Kα source (1253.6 eV) at room temperature under 3 × 10−8 Torr. Raman spectra were obtained using a Jobin-Yvon LabRam HR80 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Inc.) with a 532 nm line of the Torus 50 mW diode-pumped solid-state laser under backscattering geometry. N2 adsorption isotherms were collected on a Tristar II 3020 instrument at the liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 °C). Surface areas were obtained by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using adsorption data in a relative pressure range of P/P0 = 0.05–0.30; pore size distributions were calculated using the adsorption branch of the isotherms by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method; and total pore volumes were estimated from the volume adsorbed at a relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.994. The elemental analysis was conducted by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on a Perkin Elmer (Optima-4300DV).
Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements
The preparation method of working electrodes containing investigated catalysts is illustrated as follows. In short, 5 mg of catalyst powder was dispersed in 1 mL of 1:1 v/v ethanol–water mixed solvent, and then the mixture was ultrasonicated for about 30 min to generate a homogeneous catalyst ink. Then, 5 μl of the ink (containing 25 μg of catalysts) was dripped on a polished glass carbon electrode (GCE, geometric area = 0.07 cm−2), leading to a catalyst loading of 0.36 mg cm−2. Next, Nafion aqueous solution (2 μl, 0.5 wt%) was dripped on the GCE and fully dried in air as a binder. The resulting electrode served as a working electrode. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl in 3.0 M KCl solution and the counter electrode was a Pt wire. All the potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation: ERHE = ESHE + 0.0591 × pH = EAppl + ϕAg/AgCl + 0.0591 × pH, in which ESHE is the potential versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) potential, EAppl is the applied potential vs. Ag/AgCl reference, and ϕAg/AgCl is the electrode potential of the KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode (0.198 V vs. SHE). All current densities were normalized using the geometric area of the GCE.
OER measurements
The OER activities of all samples were measured on an electrochemical workstation (CHI model 760E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Factory, China) and investigated by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method within the range of 1.0–1.8 V vs. RHE at a slow scan rate of 5 mV s−1, corrected by iR-compensation. The working electrodes were scanned several times until the signals were stabilized, and then the data were collected. For all testing, a flow of O2 was used to purge the electrolyte to ensure the O2/H2O equilibrium at 1.23 V.6 The over-potentials (η) at 10 mA cm−2 were calculated as follows: η = E (vs. RHE) − 1.23, considering O2/H2O equilibrium at 1.23 V. The Tafel slope was calculated according to the Tafel equation as η = a + blog|J|, where η denotes the over-potentials, b denotes the Tafel slope, and J denotes the current density. The stability was tested by means of chronopotentiometry and chronoamperometry measurements. The stability of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs was also evaluated by cycling the electrode potential (1.0 V to 1.7 V) for 2000 cycles at 0.2 V s−1, after which the LSVs were recorded. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at 5 mV and recorded at 1.50 V in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution. The electrochemically active surface areas of the samples were investigated from double-layer charging curves using cyclic voltammograms (CVs, 1.09 V to 1.14 V).
HER measurements
The HER activities of all samples were measured on the same electrochemical workstation and investigated by LSVs within the range of −1.0–0.2 V vs. RHE at a slow scan rate of 5 mV s−1, corrected by iR-compensation. 1.0 M KOH or 0.5 M H2SO4 (purged with pure N2) was used as the electrolyte. The Tafel slope was calculated according to the Tafel equation. The stability was tested by means of chronoamperometry measurements. It was also evaluated by cycling the electrode potential (−0.6 V to 0.2 V) for 2000 cycles at 0.2 V s−1, after which the LSVs were recorded.
Results and discussion
The synthesis process for Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs is illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, an ultrapure aqueous solution containing glucose, urea, phosphoric acid, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and CNTs was stirred at 80 °C to remove water. Secondly, the dried solid mixture was ground thoroughly and copyrolyzed at 800 °C in an Ar atmosphere. Finally, the obtained hybrids were subjected to the ultrasonic exfoliation process and washed with water to remove impurities and unstable composition, yielding the final catalyst Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs and the corresponding structural model. 
The morphology and microstructure of Co2P@N, P-PCN and Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs were first depicted by TEM and SEM techniques. As shown in Fig. 1a and S1a,† after copyrolyzing glucose, urea, phosphoric acid, and Co(NO3)2·6H2O under an Ar atmosphere, the obtained Co2P@N, P-PCN has a distinct two-dimensional nanosheet morphology. Besides, ample intertanglings and crinkles are observed obviously on the surfaces. To explore the fine structure of N, P-doped carbon nanosheets, the HRTEM image was taken. As presented in Fig. S2,† the carbon nanosheets are highly graphitized, which can be seen from the lattice spacing of 0.34 nm, corresponding to the lattice distance of the (002) planes of graphite.35 The formation of graphene nanosheets can be attributed to the sacrificial soft template of layered graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) that is formed when urea is thermally treated at 350–600 °C.36 When temperatures are higher than 750 °C, the layered g-C3N4 template will be decomposed and then the graphene nanosheets are formed.37,38 Urea was pyrolyzed and phosphoric acid was dehydrated to afford N and P sources, respectively. Besides, Co2+ ions reacted with phosphoric acid to form Co2P.39 Glucose was carbonized during the heating process to afford the C source. During the pyrolysis process, CNTs are incorporated inside the carbon nanosheets, making them hard to detach from the hybrids during OER and HER processes; furthermore, CNTs can act as circuits for facile electron transfer and create space for effective transport of reactants.26,40,41Fig. 1b and S1b† show the SEM images of the as-synthesized Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs. The corresponding EDX results (Fig. S3†) show the C peak at 0.20 keV accompanied by O, P, and N tail peaks, and three Co peaks at about 0.78, 6.91 and 7.64 keV corresponding to Co Lα, Co Kα and Co Kβ1, respectively. Besides, the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs is comprised of 58.16 wt% C, 3.74 wt% O, 7.85 wt% N, 17.65 wt% P and 12.60 wt% Co, respectively. Fig. 1c delineates the TEM image of the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs, in which no obvious Co2P NPs can be seen, due to the very small size of Co2P. As shown in Fig. 1d and S4,† during pyrolysis processes, the Co2+ was transformed into ultra-small and evenly dispersed Co2P NPs, encapsulated in the carbon nanosheets, which could also avoid aggregation of Co2P NPs and detachment from the hybrid material. The size distribution histograms indicated that more than 90% of the Co2P NPs were within the size range of 1.6–3.0 nm and the mean particle diameter was about 2.3 nm (Fig. S5†). To explore the fine structure of Co2P NPs, the HRTEM image was taken and is shown in Fig. 1e. It shows clearly lattice fringes and suggests good crystallinity of Co2P NPs, in accordance with that revealed by the XRD characterization (Fig. S6†). The lattice fringes with a d spacing of 0.221 nm are attributed to the (112) planes of Co2P.42 To further confirm the composition and element distribution of the catalyst, elemental mapping analysis was performed. Fig. 1f shows the HAADF-STEM image of the region where elemental mapping was carried out. It is observed that all five elements existed in the catalyst. The red, yellow, orange, green, blue, and purple colours correspond to the mapping of C, O, N, P, Co-K, and Co-L elements, respectively.

To demonstrate the structural defects of the as-prepared materials, Raman spectroscopy measurements were conducted (Fig. 2a). The appearance of the G-band of Co2P@N, P-PCN at 1578 cm−1 supports the formation of graphitic carbon during the pyrolysis process.32 The results are in agreement with those by HRTEM analysis (Fig. S2†). Similar to nanometer-sized graphite particles and chemically modified graphene flakes, the sample has also a broad D-band centered at 1356 cm−1, underlining the presence of disorder and a certain amount of heteroatoms.43 The intensity ratio of D to G bands (ID/IG) is traditionally used to evaluate the amount of defect and disordered structures.33,44 The ID/IG ratio increases from CNTs (0.72) to Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs (0.91), which can be attributed to the introduction of Co2P@N, P-PCN (1.01). This indicates that Co2P@N, P-PCN could bring more defect and disordered structures. Such defect and disordered structures, caused by the doping of heteroatoms, are greatly significant to boost the electrocatalytic performance of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs because of the enhanced p-bonding and electron donor–acceptor characteristics.45,46

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were performed to investigate porous features of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 2b, Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs exhibits a type-IV isotherm with a pronounced adsorption at medium and high relative pressures (0.4–1.0P/P0), demonstrating the existence of a large number of mesoporous within the materials.47,48 Using these plots, it was calculated that Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs had a high BET surface area of 199.94 m2 g−1. To further analyze the pore structures of the as-prepared materials, pore size distribution curves were plotted using the BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) method. As a result, the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs exhibits a wide pore-size distribution (the inset of Fig. 2b), and the average pore size and the cumulative pore volumes are 11.39 nm and 0.57 cm3 g−1, respectively. Many studies have demonstrated that porous carbonaceous materials with interpenetrated macro-/mesoporous structures are ideal electrocatalysts, as they maximize the electroactive surface area of catalysts and improve the transport rate of reactants (such as hydroxide ions) and reaction products (such as oxygen/hydrogen gas).47,49,50
To confirm the chemical constitution and the chemical bonding of constituent elements in Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNT hybrids, XPS was carried out. As presented in Fig. 3a, peaks corresponding to C, O, N, P and Co are clearly observed in the full scan spectra. According to the XPS data, atomic percentages of C (74.91 at%), O (3.27 at%), N (9.43 at%), P (9.38 at%) and Co (3.01 at%) can be reached. As shown in Fig. 3b, the C 1s spectrum was deconvoluted into five peaks located at 284.6, 285.2, 285.9, 287.2 and 289.1 eV, which can be attributed to C–C/CC, C–P/C–O–P, C–N/C–O, CO, and OC–O, respectively.51 It reveals that both N and P are doped in the carbon nanosheets in the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs. The high-resolution O 1s spectrum is also presented and fitted into two peaks at 530.8 and 531.6 eV (Fig. 3c), which correspond to hydroxyls and carboxyls, respectively.52 In this work, urea is selected as the N source and the amidogen of urea can react with hemiacetal hydroxyl derived from glucose to form high levels of N–C chemical bonds. As clearly shown in the high resolution XPS spectra of N 1s in Fig. 3d, doped N atoms exist in the form of the pyridinic-N (∼398.3 eV), pyrrolic-N (∼399.5 eV), graphitic-N (∼400.8 eV), and oxygenated N (∼403.7 eV),53 and the specific XPS results are displayed in Table S1 (ESI†). Plenty of experimental studies and theoretical calculations have ascertained that pyridinic N and graphitic N can act as efficient active sites for the OER.54 Due to the relatively high content percentage of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N in the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs, the carbon nanosheets themselves are beneficial to the catalytic performance for the OER. The doping type of the P doped in the carbon was also investigated through XPS analysis, as shown in Fig. 3e. The peak at 129.4 eV in the high resolution XPS spectrum of the P 2p core level is ascribed to P species in Co2P,39 whereas the peaks at 133.3 and 134.5 eV can be assigned to P–C and P–O,33 respectively. The presence of P–C species demonstrates that P is doped in the carbon nanosheets in the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs. In addition, the atomic ratio of Co to P is about 1:3.1 in terms of the XPS measurements (Table S1†), further confirming that P is doped in carbon nanosheets besides participating in the formation of Co2P. Recent studies have demonstrated that codoping carbons with N and P heteroatoms can significantly improve their catalytic performance;32–34 thus the N, P-doped carbon nanosheets in hybrids are beneficial to the OER and HER. High-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p are shown in Fig. 3f. The peaks at 778.8 and 792.7 eV are assigned to the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 of Co species in Co2P,55,56 also in accordance with that revealed by the XRD characterization (Fig. S6†). The peaks at 781.3 and 797.6 eV are assigned to the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 of the oxidized Co2+ species respectively, along with two apparent satellite peaks at 784.4 and 803.0 eV, which are ascribed to the shakeup excitation of the high-spin Co2+ ions.55,56

The OER activities of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs and other contrast samples were first evaluated by LSVs in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 at room temperature. Initially, the influence of mass loading of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs on OER performance was investigated. As shown in Fig. S7,† the current density improves when increasing the catalyst loading from 0.07 mg cm−2 to 0.36 mg cm−2. However, when the catalyst loading exceeds 0.36 mg cm−2, the current density begins to decrease. The reason might be that further increasing the catalyst loading results in thicker catalyst layers, causing confined mass transport and separation of catalyst from the electrode during the OER process.57 Thus, the optimal catalyst loading of 0.36 mg cm−2 was chosen for the further study.
To better investigate the OER activity of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs, the LSVs of other contrast samples were recorded under the same conditions (Fig. 4a). The CNTs exhibit negligible catalytic activity, and the Co2P@N, P-PCN also displays a low OER response with a high onset potential at ∼1.54 V vs. RHE, while the anodic current recorded on Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs provides an early onset potential at ∼1.46 V (correlated to an over-potential of ∼230 mV), beyond which the current rises rapidly as the potential increases, indicating that the incorporation of CNTs can significantly improve the catalytic activity. Noticeably, the OER performance of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs largely exceeds that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (99.99%, Alfa Aesar), which is commonly used as a reference to compare OER performance.58

(b) Comparison of the over-potentials for different catalysts at 10 mA cm−2. (c) Tafel plots of the catalysts above. (d) Chronoamperometric response at a constant potential of 1.51 V; inset in (d) LSV curves of the catalyst before and after 2000 cycles. 
We further compared the over-potentials required for different catalysts to deliver 10.0 mA cm−2 current density (Ej=10), which is the value expected for a 10% efficient solar water-splitting device.59 Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs generates a current density of 10.0 mA cm−2 at 1.51 V, lower than that of IrO2 (1.58 V), CoC2@N, P-MCN (1.63 V), and the corresponding over-potentials at 10 mA cm−2 are summarized in Fig. 4b. This excellent OER activity of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs is not only better than that of most of the state-of-the-art Co-based transition-metal electrocatalysts, but also superior to that of many other reported noble-metal catalysts. A detailed comparison of different highly active OER catalysts is shown in Table S2,† further confirming the outstanding catalytic behavior of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs. The catalytic kinetics for the OER were examined by Tafel plots (Fig. 4c). The Tafel slope of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs (72 mV dec−1) is lower than those of Co2P@N, P-PCN (85 mV dec−1) and IrO2 (79 mV dec−1), and comparable to that of the previously reported highly active OER catalysts (Table S2†), suggesting its favorable reaction kinetics.
It is well known that the performance of catalysts can be affected by their compositions. Herein, by tuning the weight percentages of CNTs to the starting mass of glucose, the composition–activity relationship was studied. As shown in Fig. S8,† both over-potentials and current density show a “volcano”-type relationship versus the weight percentage of CNTs, and Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs20 wt% exhibits the best OER activity. The results suggest that an appropriate increase of the weight percentages of CNTs would enhance OER activity by affecting the electrical conductivity of hybrids, while excess CNTs would reduce the ratio of active sites in Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs and suppress the catalytic activity for the OER.60,61
Except for the activity, high stability of the catalyst toward the OER is also critical for energy conversion systems. The chronoamperometric response demonstrates the high stability of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs, showing a slight anodic current attenuation of 3.3% within 22 h (Fig. 4d). The weight percentage of Co in Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs after the chronoamperometric test, as determined by ICP-AES analysis, was 12.56 wt%, almost the same as that before the durability test. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4d, after cycling the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNT catalyst continuously for 2000 cycles, the catalyst affords similar i–V curves as before, with negligible loss of anodic current. In the chronopotentiometric response, Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs affords a nearly constant operating potential of 1.51 V to deliver 10.0 mA cm−2 current density, whereas the potential of IrO2 increases within 8000 s (Fig. S9†), again revealing the stronger stability of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs. SEM and TEM characterization (Fig. S10†) demonstrates the nearly invariable morphology of the hybrids after the chronopotentiometry test. We reasonably believe that these observations result from the unique carbon structure, that is, CNTs and the uniformly distributed Co2P NPs are confined inside the carbon nanosheets.
The unique architecture endows Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs with catalytic performance much better than that of traditional OER materials. Firstly, during pyrolysis processes, CNTs are incorporated into the obtained Co2P@N, P-PCN and lead to strong interaction between CNTs and Co2P@N, P-PCN, which can highly improve the electron transfer capability and favor the high OER activity and stability. This can be confirmed from the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements that were carried out on Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs and Co2P@N, P-PCN. The corresponding Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 5a. The semicircular diameter in the Nyquist plots of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs is much smaller than that of Co2P@N, P-PCN, due to the smaller contact and charge transfer impedance.62 The corresponding results of Bode plots are in accordance with those of Nyquist plots (Fig. S11†).

Secondly, Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs also largely exceeds the physically mixed Co2P@N, P-PCN + CNTs in OER performance (Fig. 5b), which implies that the outstanding activity of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs with low resistance originates not simply from the increased electrical conductivity but also from a complex synergistic effect between strongly interacting Co2P@N, P-PCN and CNTs. A stability test of physically mixed Co2P@N, P-PCN + CNTs is carried out by means of a chronopotentiometry measurement (Fig. S12†). Although it has low over-potential (∼390 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at the beginning of the test, it is not stable in the long-term OER process and its over-potential grows quickly after about 2 h. Its inferior durability might be because of the weak interaction between Co2P@N, P-PCN and CNTs, resulting in the detachment of the CNTs during the OER process.
Thirdly, ultra-small Co2P NPs are uniformly embedded into the porous carbon nanosheets, not only can prevent Co2P NPs from aggregation and peeling off during prolonged electrochemical reactions, but also afford plenty of fully exposed active sites, thus affording a large electrochemically active surface area (Aechem). For the purpose of comparison, the Aechem values of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs, N, P-PCN/CNTs, and commercial IrO2 catalyst were investigated and compared. Due to the positive correlation among the value of electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), the scan rate (v) and A (Cdl ∝ v × Aechem), Aechem of the as-synthesized materials can be calculated from Cdl of the catalytic surface.6,63 The Cdl was measured from double-layer charging curves using CVs in a small potential range. A potential range of 1.09–1.14 V (Δ = 50 mV) vs. RHE was selected for the CV measurements because no obvious electrochemical features corresponding to faradic current were observed in this region. Furthermore, the dependence of the current on the scan rate in this region is linear for all materials, which is consistent with capacitive charging behavior.63 As shown in Fig. 6, the CVs exhibit an approximately rectangular shape of Cdl. The plot of current density (at 1.12 V) against potential scan rate has a linear relationship. By calculating the slope, Cdl of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs is confirmed to be 21.3 mF cm−2, which is remarkably higher than that of N, P-PCN/CNTs (2.0 mF cm−2), and even larger than that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (18.9 mF cm−2). Thus, the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNT catalyst with larger Aechem can afford more active sites exposed to the electrolyte and greatly contribute to its ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity.

Next, we evaluated the electrocatalytic HER performance of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs using a three-electrode system in alkaline (1.0 M KOH) and acid (0.5 M H2SO4) electrolytes, respectively (Fig. 7). The state-of-the-art commercial Pt catalyst (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72, Aladdin, China) and Co2P@N, P-PCN catalyst were also examined under the same conditions with the same loading (0.36 mg cm−2) for comparison. As shown in LSV curves (Fig. 7a), Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs can function well as an outstanding HER catalyst in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with an onset potential of about −33 mV, and a low over-potential of only 154 mV to reach current densities of 10 mA cm−2 (only 70 mV larger than that of the commercial Pt catalyst). The corresponding Tafel slope is 52 mV dec−1, comparable to that of the commercial Pt catalyst (43 mV dec−1) (Fig. 7b). These results are much better than those of Co2P@N, P-PCN and even recently reported non-noble metal-based HER catalysts (Table S3†). Furthermore, the LSV curves of the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNT electrode after 2000 cycles of continuous CV scanning show a negligible difference with the initial one (Fig. 7c). The chronoamperometric response also demonstrates the high stability of the catalyst, showing a slight cathode current loss of 1.9% within 25 h (inset in Fig. 7c). The above results indicate the remarkable HER activity and operation stability of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte.

(f) LSV curves of the catalyst before and after 2000 cycles in a N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte; inset in (f) chronoamperometric response at a constant potential of −0.126 V. 
What's more, similar results have been obtained when Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs was used in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 7d, Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs exhibits a low over-potential of 126 mV at 10 mA cm−2, superior to that of Co2P@N, P-PCN. The corresponding Tafel slope is 45 mV dec−1 (Fig. 7e). After cycling Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs continuously for 2000 cycles, the catalyst affords similar LSV curves as before, with negligible loss of the cathode current (Fig. 7f). The chronoamperometry test for the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNT catalyst shows an about 97.6% current retention after 25 h (inset in Fig. 7f). For the above reasons, the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs shows exceptional HER activity and stability in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes.
Based on the above results, we deduced that Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs could act as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolytes. Hence, we made an alkaline electrolyzer (1.0 M KOH) by using Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs deposited onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glasses (1 mg cm−2) as both the anode and cathode to extend this system towards practical electrolysis applications. Since IrO2 is well-established for the OER and Pt for the HER, the integration of IrO2 on the anode and Pt on the cathode was also tested for comparison. As shown in Fig. 8a, the catalytic current of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs is observed when the applied potential is larger than 1.52 V with a Tafel slope of 95 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8b), while the IrO2/Pt couple is able to catalyze water splitting with an onset around 1.54 V (Fig. 8a). Besides, the Tafel slope of the IrO2/Pt couple is 107 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8b), larger than that of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs. Moreover, a battery with a nominal voltage of 1.5 V can drive overall water splitting with obvious gas bubble release (Fig. 8c and S13†), confirming the high efficiency of the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNT electrode. These results suggest that the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNT electrode has potential applications in low-cost and energy-efficient water electrolysis.

(d) Chronoamperometric response at a constant potential of 1.64 V; inset in (d) chronopotentiometry curve of IrO2/Pt catalyst couples at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. 
It is worth mentioning that the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNT couple maintains excellent stability as manifested by the steady current density change after the 25 h stability test (Fig. 8d). However, the stability of the IrO2/Pt couple was much inferior to that of the Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNT couple (inset in Fig. 8d). The comparison of OER and HER performance in 1.0 M KOH solution for Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs with other non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts is shown in Table S4,† further confirming the outstanding catalytic behavior of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, ultrafine Co2P NPs encapsulated in N, P dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet/CNT hybrids have been synthesized successfully by copyrolyzing glucose, urea, phosphoric acid, and Co(NO3)3·6H2O as well as CNTs. The obtained materials exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic performance for water splitting due to the following five reasons: (i) Co2P has been proved to be very active for the OER and HER. Encapsulating Co2P NPs into the carbon nanosheets can result in strong interaction between the Co2P NPs and carbon structure, which remarkably enhances OER and HER performance; (ii) the N, P-doped carbon has also been demonstrated to be OER- and HER-active; (iii) the incorporation of CNTs can improve the conductivity; (iv) CNTs and the uniformly distributed Co2P NPs are confined inside carbon nanosheets to sustain the robust structural stability; (v) interpenetrated macro-/mesoporous structure with a high specific surface area provides fully exposed active sites, multi-dimensional mass/electron transport pathways, and easy release of gas bubbles. All these factors synergistically promote the overall catalytic activity of Co2P@N, P-PCN/CNTs for overall water splitting. This work also provides a new route to design and synthesize bifunctional electrocatalysts with integrated and enhanced properties. We anticipate this material will have broad applications in the fields of renewable energy systems and energy-intensive industries and so on.
