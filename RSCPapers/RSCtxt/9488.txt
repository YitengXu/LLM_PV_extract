    , Accepted 16th February 2017First published on 9th March 2017AbstractHalf-Heusler thermoelectric materials have attracted extensive research interest over the last two decades owing to their thermal stability, mechanical strength, and moderate efficiency. This article presents an ab initio theoretical evaluation of the electrical and thermal transport properties of three bismuth-based most promising thermoelectric alloys, selected out of 54 stable half-Heusler compounds. These are brand new compounds which are recently proposed to be stable (Nature Chem.7, 308 (2015)) and may have interesting properties. The calculated band structures of the three compounds, namely HfRhBi, ZrIrBi and ZrRhBi, served as a hint for their promising thermoelectric properties. HfRhBi and ZrIrBi turn out to be narrow band gap semiconductors while ZrRhBi is a moderate band gap semiconductor. A detailed study of the carrier concentration and temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient, power factor, lattice and electronic thermal conductivity and hence the figure of merit (ZT) is carried out. In contrast to most promising known thermoelectric materials, we found a high power factor for these materials (highest ∼17.36 mW m−1 K−2 for p-type ZrIrBi). All three systems (especially p-type) show high ZT values, as high as 0.45 for the ideal crystals. The maximum ZT and the corresponding optimal n- and p-type doping concentrations are calculated, which shall certainly provide guidance for future experimental work.
1 Introduction
The ever increasing demand for energy necessitates a concerted effort to broaden our energy resources (solar, fuel, wind, etc.) and at the same time a reduction in our energy consumption. As a matter of fact, a large fraction of the energy consumed throughout the globe is lost as heat, and conversion of even a small fraction of it to other forms of usable energy can significantly impact the global energy requirement. Significant efforts are under way to convert this waste heat into electricity using thermoelectrics. In addition, advances in thermoelectrics have led to the development of multistage Peltier coolers which can be used to achieve efficient cooling/heating.
The fundamental requirement for obtaining a promising thermoelectric material is to optimize a variety of conflicting properties. The conversion efficiency of thermoelectric (TE) materials depends upon the transport coefficients of the constituent material through a dimension-less figure of merit, ZT = (S2σT)/(κe + κL). Here, S, σ and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and temperature, respectively. κe and κL are the thermal conductivity due to electrons and phonons, respectively.
The value of ZT is a measure of how efficient the material is for both TE heating and cooling applications; the higher the value, the higher the efficiency. The main challenge for researchers is determining how to enhance the value of ZT, since the transport parameters S, σ and κ (κe and κL) are inter-related to each other. The electronic thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity are related to each other by the Wiedemann–Franz law, κe = LσT, in which L is the Lorentz number. This relation clearly shows that increasing the electrical conductivity also increases the electronic thermal conductivity, hence optimization of ZT turns out to be challenging. In earlier days, metals were used for TE applications because of their very good electrical conductivity but their ZT values were low since metals exhibit large thermal conductivity with a significant contribution from the lattice part (κL). Therefore, minimizing the lattice thermal conductivity is itself a challenge. Most popular TE materials are based upon Bi2Te3 and Si1−xGex, having a ZT value above 1 at their optimal temperature.2,3 Other bulk materials, such as complex chalcogenides,4,5 skutterudites6,7 and quasi-crystals,8 are potential candidates for TE applications in their pure and defect induced states. In addition to bulk systems, nanostructure9–11 and surface12 engineering is also widely used to enhance ZT.
Heusler alloys have been known to mankind since the beginning of the 20th century. They are known to exhibit a very rich magnetic behaviour which makes them a promising candidate for spintronic applications.13 They have good electrical and mechanical properties and thermal stability and the band gap (0–4 eV) is easily tunable by only changing the chemical composition, which makes them potential candidates for solar cell applications and topological insulators.13 However, in the last decade, ternary half-Heusler alloys (HHAs) have emerged as promising candidates for TE applications also due to the small value of their band gap, high Seebeck coefficient (S) value (up to several hundred μV K−1) and their appealing transport properties.
A very big advantage of considering HHAs for thermoelectric applications is that they can be easily synthesized as 100% dense samples14 and the efficiency (i.e. ZT) can be enhanced by the application of easy doping (either n-type or p-type) or by inducing impurities or defects. Another reason to consider HHAs is the high value of their power factor (S2σ), which is one of the most important criteria for TE applications.
HHAs can serve as high as well as moderate temperature TE materials and have the potential to replace some of the state of the art TE materials.15–25 In the last few years, there has been extensive effort to find new HHAs as potential TE materials. Until now, the most reliable HH compounds found are the family of MNiSn (M = Ti, Zr or Hf)-related compounds with maximum ZT values lying in the range 0.7–1.5.26–28 However, this (ZT)max is achieved by experimenting with various types of doping (e.g. mixing M-elements with each other or doping Sb with Sn etc.), nanostructuring10etc. The maximum ZT obtained for an ideal crystal of ZrNiSn (no doping), however, remains as 0.2–0.3.26 Among others, NbCoSn (ZT ∼ 0.15),29 TiCoSb (ZT ∼ 0.015),30etc. emerge to be good TE HH compounds. The main reason for not getting a high value of ZT in ideal crystals of HHAs is the high values of thermal conductivity and relatively lower power factor values. For example, the experimentally determined maximum power factor for a ZrNiSn-based alloy26 is 3.4 mW m−1 K−2 at 750 K, and for a TiCoSb-based alloy31 is 2.3 mW m−1 K−2 at 850 K. Although these power factors are relatively higher than those of most current TE materials, they are not so high as to enhance the figure of merit to a great extent. On the other hand, ultra low thermal conductivity has been found recently in a YNiBi system32 but with a very low ZT.
Although there exist several ideal HH crystals with relatively high ZT values, the hunt for more such alloys is still ongoing in order to find better TE materials. In fact, if one looks at the Inorganic Crystal Structural Database (ICSD)33 or Pearson’s Handbook34 there exist hundreds of HH alloys. More recently, a huge database1 has been created for such alloys with the total valence electron count (VEC) to be 18 in their primitive unit cell.18 Their main motivation was to report chemically plausible compounds that can have interesting properties but which were neglected in the past. They mainly checked the stability and some basic electronic structure properties of these compounds using high throughput first principles calculations. Because HH compounds with VEC = 18 have narrow band gaps and show promising TE properties, we have done a detailed band structure calculation35 of all of the stable compounds reported in ref. 1. The topology of these band structures helped in identifying three compounds HfRhBi, ZrIrBi and ZrRhBi which turn out to be quite promising with the maximum ZT reaching up to ∼0.45.
The purpose of this paper is to systematically evaluate and present a detailed electronic structure and electrical as well as thermal transport properties of these three alloys. Some of the key features of the present study are as follows: unlike some of the previous theoretical studies where the Seebeck coefficient (S) or electrical conductivity (σ) or the power factor (S2σ)36 or at best S2σ/κe37 is chosen as the parameter to dictate the thermoelectric performance or the optimal n-type or p-type doping levels, we used the figure of merit ZT as the comprehensive parameter for the same purpose, and all of the thermoelectric parameters reported in this paper correspond to that optimal (ZT)max. This can only be done with a reliable evaluation of the lattice thermal conductivity, which we have successfully done in the present manuscript (see Computational and theoretical details section for more information). In addition, keeping the device fabrication and application in mind, we have also calculated the elastic constants, bulk modulus (B) and Young’s modulus (Y) to assert the robustness of the three systems against various stresses. The mechanical stability of this class of compounds has been seldom reported38–41 in the past.
2 Computational and theoretical details

Ab initio simulations were performed using density functional theory (DFT)42 implemented within the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)43–45 with a projected augmented-wave basis.46 We used the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)47 scheme for the electronic exchange–correlation functional. A plane wave cut-off of 500 eV was used in all of the calculations. The tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections48 was used to calculate the density of states (DOS). Electronic structure optimization was converged within the energy error ∼10−5 eV. The cell volume, shape and atomic positions for all of the structures were fully relaxed using the conjugate gradient algorithm until the force on each atom fell below 0.01 eV Å−1. The Brillouin zone sampling was done using an automated Γ-centered K point mesh. A 20 × 20 × 20 K point mesh was used to perform ionic relaxation as well as self-consistent calculations. The spin–orbit coupling is found to have negligible effect on the band gap as well as the band topology near the Fermi level and thus is not taken into account in the present calculation.
The thermoelectric properties of suitable candidates were then calculated using the BoltzWann module49 of the Wannier90 package.50 This uses the Maximally Localised Wannier Function (MLWF) basis set51,52 by interpolating first principle plane wave results to determine the Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (σ) and the electronic part of the thermal conductivity (κe) using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Evaluation of the variable relaxation time from first principles calculation is quite difficult because it involves a complex scattering mechanism (carrier scattering, phonon scattering, defect scattering, boundary scattering etc.). This is why the constant relaxation time approximation has been ubiquitously used in most of the ab initio simulations of thermoelectric properties. Since there are no experimental data available for our systems of interest, we first did a calculation on a well explored half-Heusler system, namely ZrNiSn, for which plenty of experimental results are already available.53,54 We then fitted our simulated electrical conductivity (σ/τ) with experimental53σ and found the relaxation time (τ) to be around 9–10 fs in its optimal temperature region. Such a procedure has been justified in some of the previous literature37,55 and a typical range of τ which provided a reasonable comparison between theory and experiment (for a variety of systems) lies between 9–15 fs. Keeping this typical range of τ in mind we have used τ = 10 fs in our system of interest which, we believe, should give a reasonable qualitative trend of various thermoelectric properties. For transport calculations, we took 24 bands and 20 Wannier functions for all three systems. The frozen window was taken around the Fermi level (EF) in such a way that it included all of the states within a 2 eV range above and below the conduction and valence band edges, respectively.
The properties for n-type and p-type materials were evaluated based on the rigid band approximation, according to which the addition of donor or acceptor atoms does not affect the band structure of the material, but instead causes the chemical potential to shift. The chemical potential moves towards the conduction bands as electron doping increases and moves towards the valence bands as the hole doping increases. The output of the BoltzWann package is in terms of properties varying with respect to the chemical potential (μ). In order to study the transport properties in terms of the carrier concentration (nc) instead of the chemical potential, we use the equation , where D(E) is the density of states and f(E) is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function for electrons of energy E. At a fixed temperature, the integral can be performed over an entire energy range at a given chemical potential to give the corresponding carrier concentration value or vice versa.
To calculate the lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity (κL) we use the Boltzmann transport theory for phonons as implemented in the ShengBTE package.56 For this, we calculated the 2nd order inter-atomic force constants (IFCs) using the PHONOPY package.57 The 3rd order IFCs are calculated using the thirdorder.py module of the ShengBTE package using the small displacement method which generates atomic configuration files with required displacements. Here we took a 4 × 4 × 4 super-cell to accurately calculate the force constants for both the 2nd order and 3rd order IFC calculations. Interactions up to the fourth nearest neighbour are taken into account for the calculation of the 3rd order force constants. A detailed analysis based on phonon dispersion and phonon density of states is shown in the ESI†58 to better understand the interplay of the atomic masses and force constants. The Born effective charges on each atom and the macroscopic dielectric tensor are calculated using density functional perturbation theory on the primitive cell using a 16 × 16 × 16 k-mesh.
HHAs have a general composition of XYZ, where X and Y are transition elements with low and high electronegativities, respectively, and Z is a main group element. HHA crystallizes in a MgAgAs type structure (space group F3m (#216)), as shown in Fig. 1. Our structural optimization suggests that the most stable structure is the one with X at 4a (0, 0, 0), Y at 4c (0.25, 0.25, 0.25) and Z at 4b (0.5, 0.5 0.5) Wyckoff positions. For the TE analysis, specifically to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of the system, we made a super cell of 4 × 4 × 4 from a 3-atom primitive cell (shown in Fig. 1).

Further computational details about the formation energies and the mechanical properties are given in the ESI.†58 In order to gain confidence on the theoretical predictions of the three systems of our interest, we did a detailed calculation for a well studied similar compound, ZrNiSn, which showed reasonable agreement with the measured results.53 These details are also given in the ESI.†58
3 Results and discussion
The detailed theoretical analysis of the chemical stability, electronic structure, mechanical stability and TE properties for the three systems HfRhBi, ZrIrBi and ZrRhBi are summarized in this section. Table 1 presents the theoretically relaxed lattice parameters, the formation energies and the direct band gap values obtained from the electronic structure calculations. The large negative values of formation energies make these systems quite stable to external changes. The band gap values were estimated from the simulated band structures for these compounds. These energy gaps are simply the energy difference between the lowest conduction band minima and highest valence band maxima. The low band gap (≤1 eV) makes them potential candidates as TE materials.

As discussed, since the mechanical stability of the material is an important property for it to be used for device fabrication, and hence for thermoelectric application, we also calculated the elastic constants for the three systems. The relevant parameters required to check the mechanical stability of the material as per the Born–Huang criteria (see ESI†58 for details) are listed in Table 2. These parameters satisfy all of the criteria required for mechanical stability of all three systems. The calculated values of the elastic constants (B and Y) are comparable to those for standard metals. This suggests that they can be cut or drawn into different shapes without changing the properties up to a fairly high point.

4 HfRhBi
Electronic structure

Fig. 2 shows the band structure and atom-projected DOS for HfRhBi. It has a direct band gap of 0.173 eV at the Γ point. This low value of the band gap aids easy excitation of thermally excited electrons, increasing the electrical conductivity. Flat bands (causing a sharp DOS) at/near the valence band maxima near EF suggest a high value of effective mass for holes, implying that this material can be used as a potentially good p-type TE material. Since the conduction band states are very sharp near EF, the n-type figure of merit is expected to be less than the p-type. The high bulk modulus (≈127.6 GPa) and Young’s modulus (≈133.8 GPa) (see Table 2) along with the strong chemical stability suggest the material to remain robust in structure and electronic properties against pressure or other stresses.
Thermoelectric properties

Fig. 3 shows the Seebeck coefficient (S), power factor (S2σ), thermal conductivity κ (both lattice and electronic) and the figure of merit (ZT) as a function of carrier concentration nc (left) and temperature (T) (right) for both n-type and p-type HfRhBi. The nc dependence of all of the quantities are shown at six different temperatures (T). Two optimal doping concentrations [one each for (ZT)max at 1300 K and 900 K] are then chosen to plot the temperature dependence (right panel) for the same quantities.
 Fig. 2  Band structure (left) and atom-projected DOS (right) of HfRhBi. 
 Fig. 3  (Left) Carrier concentration dependence of the Seebeck coefficient (S), power factor (S2σ), thermal conductivity [lattice (κL), electronic (κe) and total (κ)] and figure of merit (ZT) for n- and p-type HfRhBi alloys at various temperatures (T). (Right) Temperature dependence of the same quantities for n- and p-type HfRhBi at two different optimal concentrations. 
As evident from the figure, the Seebeck coefficient for the p-type first increases with nc, reaches a maximum, and then decreases with a further increase in nc. The behavior for the n-type, however, is completely different. In the concentration range ∼1020 to 1022 cm−3, the electrical conductivity (σ) increases rapidly, and dominates the behavior of the power factor vs. nc. This corresponds to an optimal carrier concentration, (nc)max, based on the maxima in the power factor (S2σ) at a given temperature. However, looking at the variation of thermal conductivity (κ) vs. nc, κ shows a maximum at a relatively higher concentration than the optimal concentration, as estimated using S2σ. This changes the value of the optimal carrier concentration at which ZT achieves the maximum value. As such, the most common practice36 for estimating the optimal concentration based on a maxima in the S2σ is misleading. The variation of the thermal conductivity and hence its effect on ZT can completely change the value of (nc)max. We have chosen the nc dependence of ZT (instead of S2σ) to obtain the optimal carrier concentrations, (nc)max. The temperature dependence is plotted for one more carrier concentration having a ZT value ∼80% of the (ZT)max for comparison (1.96 × 1020 cm−3 for the n-type and 1.03 × 1020 cm−3 for the p-type).
For p-type HfRhBi, the maximum power factor was found to be ≈10.88 mW m−1 K−2 at 1300 K. At such a high temperature, due to thermally excited electron–hole pairs, the electronic part of the thermal conductivity (κe) becomes very large but at the same time the lattice thermal conductivity (κL) decreases drastically due to a decrease in the mean free path (Lph) of the highly agitated phonons. The ZT value is found to be 0.37. Even at lower temperatures (800–1000 K), the power factor lies in the range ≈6.2–8.4 mW m−1 K−2 which is much larger than the values obtained for most promising HH thermoelectric materials e.g. ≈3.4 mW m−1 K−2 for ZrNiSn26 and ≈2.3 mW m−1 K−2 for TiCoSb.31
For n-type HfRhBi at 1300 K, the Seebeck coefficient is less than that of the p-type. This is due to the lower value of the effective mass in the n-region, as is obvious from the band structure. The power factor and hence the ZT is also smaller. The optimal value of ZT at 1300 K is 0.27.
5 ZrIrBi
Electronic structure
The band structure and atom-projected density of states for ZrIrBi are shown in Fig. 4. This system has a similar band structure to HfRhBi near EF except for the fact that the top most valence band is flatter and the conduction band edges are steeper near the Γ point. Thus one can expect the Seebeck coefficient and power factor for ZrIrBi to be relatively higher than those of HfRhBi for the p-type system. However, the steeper conduction bands and a very slow rise in the value of DOS above EF suggest it to have a lower S and hence lower ZT value than those of HfRhBi for the n-type system. ZrIrBi has the highest mechanical stability out of the three systems with the bulk modulus ≈133.3 GPa and Young’s modulus ≈149.6 GPa (Table 2).
 Fig. 4  Band structure (left) and atom-projected DOS (right) of ZrIrBi. 
Thermoelectric properties
The variation of relevant quantities (S, S2σ, κ and ZT) with carrier concentration (left) and temperature (right) are shown in Fig. 5. Similar to HfRhBi, ZrIrBi is a good p-type TE material. Compared to HfRhBi, it has a larger power factor and lower lattice thermal conductivity (≈2 W m−1 K−1) over an intermediate as well as higher temperature range. At the optimal carrier concentration (nc)max = 8.79 × 1020 cm−3, it has a Seebeck coefficient of 255.9 μV K−1 and electrical conductivity of 26.5 × 104 Ω−1 m−1, yielding the power factor to be as large as ≈17.4 mW m−1 K−2 (at T = 1300 K). This gives a ZT value of 0.42. Notably, the ZT value does not reduce much until 900 K (ZT ≈ 0.38). As such, p-type ZrIrBi can be used as a promising TE material even at relatively low T.
 Fig. 5  The same as Fig. 3, but for the ZrIrBi alloy. 
For the n-type system, one can notice a shallower increase in the DOS near the conduction band edge arising out of steep bands near EF (see Fig. 5), thus making the effective mass relatively small and hence giving a smaller Seebeck coefficient value (95.6 μV K−1 at 1300 K). Since at high temperature, the contribution of κL to the total thermal conductivity is very small, ZT effectively depends on the S value (ZT ≈ S2/L, where L is the Lorentz number). Thus, in spite of having a high σ value (79.7 × 104 Ω−1 m−1, which is almost double that of HfRhBi), ZT (0.21) of ZrIrBi turns out to be smaller than that of HfRhBi.
6 ZrRhBi
Electronic structure
ZrRhBi is the most stable among the three HHA systems with a formation energy of 725 meV per atom. It has a direct band gap of 1.021 eV, higher than that of the other two systems, which may help in minimizing the contribution of minority carrier contributions to the Seebeck coefficient, thereby increasing the ZT value. Fig. 6 shows the band structure and DOS for ZrRhBi. As seen from the band structure, both the valence and conduction band edges are almost flat near the Γ point. Also, the DOS near EF shows a sharp increase, making the charge carriers heavier (higher effective mass helps to give a higher S value) which is a sign for it to be promising for both n-type and p-type TE applications.
 Fig. 6  Band structure (left) and atom-projected DOS (right) of ZrRhBi. 
Thermoelectric properties
ZrRhBi is found to have the highest values of TE figure of merit for both n-type and p-type systems, which is mainly attributed to the nature of the bands (Fig. 6). The nc dependence of S, S2σ, κ and ZT at various temperatures (300–1300 K) for both the n-type and p-type system are shown in Fig. 7. For p-type ZrRhBi, at 1300 K, the highest Seebeck coefficient (319.89 μV K−1) among the three systems is obtained. The electrical conductivity (8.7 × 104 Ω−1 m−1) is very low compared to that of HfRhBi and ZrIrBi at optimal (nc)max due to the larger value of the band gap (making it difficult for electrons to be excited), thus giving a smaller power factor ≈8.9 mW m−1 K−2 compared to the other two systems. Due to the large band gap, the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity is also small because of the difficulty in thermally excited electron–hole pairs reaching the conduction bands. In addition, the lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity is also smaller compared to that of the other two systems due to the highly agitated phonons. Thus, in spite of having the lowest electrical conductivity, ZrRhBi has the highest ZT value (∼0.43 at 1300 K) due to the extremely large S and lowest κ.
 Fig. 7  The same as Fig. 3, but for the ZrRhBi alloy. 
For n-type ZrRhBi, the Seebeck coefficients are slightly smaller than those of the p-type (at high T) but much higher than the S values obtained for n-type HfRhBi and ZrIrBi. Similarly to p-type ZrRhBi, the electrical conductivity is quite small, but the large value of S makes the power factor appreciable. The ZT value in this case is equally as large (0.45) as that of the p-type ZrRhBi.
7 Discussion
It is well known that electronic structure plays an important role in determining the thermoelectric performance of a given material. In this section, we will explain the reason for getting high ZT values in the three candidate systems. Such plausible reasons can alone serve as selection criteria for choosing suitable parent materials, in general, with promising TE properties.

Fig. 8 shows a closer view of the band structure and atom-projected density of states very near to EF for the three systems. For HfRhBi and ZrIrBi, all of the three constituent atoms have a slow rise in the number of states after EF, indicating low effective mass values which in turn reduce the n-type Seebeck coefficients. However, the p-type Seebeck coefficients for these two materials are higher due to the large DOS contribution (steep rise) of the atoms before EF (valence band edges). In contrast, for ZrRhBi, it is interesting to note that the contribution of all three constituent atoms to the conduction as well as valence band edge states shows a steep rise in the DOS. This makes ZrRhBi a good TE material both as n- and p-type.
 Fig. 8  Closer look at (left) the band structure and (right) the total and atom-projected DOS for HfRhBi, ZrIrBi and ZrRhBi near EF showing the valence and conduction band edges. 
All three systems discussed here are high temperature TE materials. At such high T, the κL contribution becomes very small compared to κe (see Fig. 3, 4 and 7) and hence can be neglected. This is because of the decrease in the mean free path (Lph) of the thermally agitated phonons which in turn reduces κL ( where vs and C are the velocity of sound through the material and heat capacity, respectively). Thus ZT becomes ZTe = (S2σT)/κe = S2/L, where κe = LσT. Therefore at high temperature, ZT essentially depends on the Seebeck coefficient of the material. This decrease in the mean free path of phonons is most prominent in ZrRhBi because of the large difference in the masses of the constituent atoms. This is also evident from the phonon dispersion curve (see ESI†58), which reflects the strong mass scattering and hence lowest lattice thermal conductivity.
With an increase in temperature, electron–hole pairs are generated, giving their individual contributions to the Seebeck coefficient. The total Seebeck coefficient can be expressed as S = (Snσn + Spσp)/(σn + σp). Since the Seebeck coefficients for electrons and holes have opposite signs, the total S is usually lower than either of the individual contributions, unless the direct band gap is large enough to minimize the minority carrier contribution.
At moderate temperatures, the figure of merit calculated by only considering the electronic thermal conductivity (ZTe) can be misleading because in this temperature range, the κe values are only somewhat larger or often even comparable to κL values. The figure of merit can also be expressed as . From the thermal conductivity curves (Fig. 3, 4 and 7) it can be seen that at around 300–400 K, the κL and κe values are almost equal, giving ZT = ZTe/2. Thus in the low temperature range, the role of κL is important and should not be ignored.
Since the Seebeck coefficient decreases with an increase in carrier concentration and increases with high effective mass, while σ increases with a small band gap and high mobility, a suitable band topology, optimal carrier concentration and band gap with high mobilities are desired for promising TE applications. These factors were carefully analyzed before choosing the three systems discussed here. There are still open avenues to further enhance the thermoelectric efficiency of these materials via nanostructuring, doping with suitable elements etc. The present work, however, sets an initial path to continue in this direction.
8 Conclusion
Over the years, there has been considerable effort to enhance the figure of merit (ZT) of thermoelectric materials by doping, surface engineering, nanoconstructions etc. This enhancement, however, very much depends on the ZT value of the parent ideal crystal. In the half-Heusler family, for example, the ZT value for the best parent materials (such as MNiSn (M = Ti, Zr or Hf), NbCoSb etc.) does not exceed ∼0.3. One of the main motivations of the present paper is to find new parent HH systems, with already large ZT values. Taking a hint from the band structure topology of a large combinatorial set of unreported HH compounds, we chose three systems, HfRhBi, ZrIrBi and ZrRhBi, to perform detailed electronic structure and electrical and thermal transport calculations for the TE properties. All three compounds are found to be chemically as well as mechanically strongly stable. They turn out to be efficient TE materials at high T. Table 3 shows the optimal TE parameters (nc, S, σ, S2σ and κ) corresponding the highest ZT value for n- and p-type materials at two different temperatures, 1300 and 900 K. The figure of merit (ZT) values for the three compounds lie in the range 0.21–0.45, with ZrRhBi having the largest value. The larger band gap (∼1 eV) of ZrRhBi along with the occurrence of more flat bands in its band structure gives rise to a higher S and hence higher ZT value at high T. These compounds show an unusually high power factor ranging from 5.2 to 17.4 mW m−1 K−2, which is responsible for the high figure of merit. Although the highest possible power factors for the three systems HfRhBi, ZrIrBi and ZrRhBi are 15.49 mW m−1 K−2, 22.57 mW m−1 K−2 and 19.70 mW m−1 K−2, respectively, they do not correspond to the (ZT)max values (see Table 3), showing that choosing S2σ as the deciding factor for optimal TE performance, as reported in much of the literature, is highly misleading. The calculated maximum power factor and optimal n- and p-type carrier concentrations corresponding to the maximum ZT values for all three systems certainly provide guidance for experimental work. Thermoelectric measurements on these new compounds are strongly recommended.
Table 3 Highest ZT values for both n-type and p-type systems and the corresponding optimal TE parameters for HfRhBi, ZrIrBi and ZrRhBi at 1300 K and 900 K. T, nc, S, S2σ, σ, κL and κ are in the units of Kelvin, 1020 cm−3, μV K−1, mW m−1 K−2, 104 Ω−1 m−1, mW m−1 K−1 and mW m−1 K−1, respectively
