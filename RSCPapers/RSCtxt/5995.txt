    AbstractAn electrochemically polymerized uniform column-like poly(3.4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:Pss) nanostructure synthesized on indium tin oxide substrate has been used as the buffer layer to construct a polymer bulk heterojunction solar cell, demonstrating 50% higher power conversion efficiency (from 2.56 to 3.86%) than that of using the spin-coated PEDOT:Pss as the buffer layer. The enhanced device performance is ascribed to the improved carrier transport from the highly dense, uniform column-like PEDOT: Pss nanostructure, which penetrates into the polymer blend film to improve the connection of the active layer with the anode while providing a large conducting area for charge transport. This approach is compatible with the state-of-the-art bulk heterojunction solar cells, thus offering a high throughput, low cost manufacturing process for a high performance device.

Broader context
The use of a vertically aligned nanostructure is one of the effective tactics to improve charge transport and reduce recombination in a polymer solar cell. In this work, different electrochemical techniques are investigated to electropolymerize various nano-structured PEDOT : Pss thin films, of which one with a uniform column-like nanostructure as the buffer layer can provide an efficient pathway to enhance the hole transport in a polymer solar cell, resulting in a substantial increase of power conversion efficiency in comparison to that with a spin-coated PEDOT: Pss buffer layer. Most importantly, this approach is compatible with the state-of-the-art bulk heterojunction solar cells to offer a high throughput, low cost manufacturing process with a great commercialization potential.

Introduction
Polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells as a renewable green energy resource have attracted considerable interest due to their prominent merits such as light weight, low manufacturing cost, flexible substrate, and large device surface area over other solar cells. Since the cost per watt of a photovoltaic cell is inversely proportional to its power conversion efficiency, it is critical to improve the relatively low power conversion efficiency for large scale commercialization. Since the past decade, the structure of ITO/PEDOT:Pss/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) blend/cathode has been the main structure of a polymer solar cell,1–6 in which ITO is used as the transparent anode with work-function of 4.5–4.8eV, and the buffer layer of PEDOT:Pss is incorporated to improve hole transfer from the active layer to the anode. By blending p-type (donor) P3HT and n-type (acceptor) PCBM, an interpenetrating network at a nanoscale is formed to provide a large surface area of the donor–acceptor interface for efficient dissociation of exciton, in which the nanoscale morphology of the active layer is essential to have a high efficiency device through greatly reducing the recombination of electrons and holes.7,8 In reported work, thermal annealing,2 solvent annealing,1,9 solvent additives,10,11 addition of a diblock copolymer12 and polymer demixing13 have been demonstrated to enhance the charge transport and minimize charge recombination through controlling the nanoscale morphology.
Further improvement of the conversion efficiency is still significantly limited by high recombination probability of electrons and holes during transport from dissociation sites to respective electrodes,14,15 a pathway of percolation networks in the polymer blend film.8,16,17 Since the nanostructure of a polymer film is very sensitive to its material properties and coating conditions, a great challenge remains to fabricate a controlled polymer nanostructure in a solar cell.18–20
Introduction of a vertically aligned inorganic nanostructure is one of the tactics to improve the charge transport since the extended nanostructure functions as a well-defined pathway with high mobility. Recently, a number of inorganic nanostructures (InP nanowire,21 TiO222,23 and ZnO nanostructures24) have been used in polymer photovoltaic devices to improve the charge transport. However, there are some severe limits to be used in a polymer solar cell. The growth of InP nanowire, ZnO nanorode and TiO2 nanotube requires a high temperature or vacuum system, which is not compatible with solution process-based polymer solar cells and cannot grow on a flexible substrate. In addition, all nanostructures discussed above are produced from n-type semiconductors with low hole mobility, and can only be used in an “inverted” configuration of cathode/n-type nanostructure/P3HT: PCBM/anode. Recently, Aryal,25 Lee26 and Ratcliff27 have reported that a tailored morphology of the organic active layer by nanoimprint lithography or electrodeposition can increase the interface area and enhance polymer crystallization to result in an enhanced power conversion efficiency. In this work, a nano-structured PEDOT:Pss layer was electrochemically grown on an ITO surface as a pathway to improve the hole transport. Various electrochemical techniques were investigated to electropolymerize different nano-structured thin films, and one unique structure with a uniform column-like nanostructure as the buffer layer shows enhanced hole transport, thus resulting in a substantial increase of power conversion efficiency in comparison to that with the spin-coated PEDOT:Pss as the buffer layer. The influence of the electrochemically prepared PEDOT:Pss structures on the device performance was studied to further understand the mechanism of the enhancement of the power conversion efficiency.
Experimental
Preparation of column-like PEDOT:Pss structure
PEDOT:Pss layer was prepared from an aqueous solution of 3.4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) (from Aldrich) monomer and styrene-4-sulfonate (NaPss) (from Aldrich). Distilled water was used to prepare all solutions. The solution consisted of 10 mM EDOT and 0.02 mM NaPss and was de-aerated by bubbling N2 for 30 min under vigorous stirring prior to use. Electrochemical polymerization was performed in a three-electrode cell with CHI660 electrochemical workstation. A pre-cleaned and patterned ITO substrate with a sheet resistance of ∼12 Ω/□ and area of (0.6 × 1) cm2 was used as the working electrode. A standard calomel electrode and a Pt rectangular electrode (1 × 2 cm2) were used as reference and counter electrode, respectively. Both chronoamperometry and Multi-current steps for constant current electroplating technique were used for the polymerization. The detail conditions of the electrochemical polymerizations are listed in Table 1.

Fabrication of polymer BHJ solar cell
The device fabrication process is shown in Fig. 1a. A PEDOT:Pss layer was electrochemically polymerized on the pre-cleaned and patterned ITO substrate with morphology controlled by polymerization conditions. After blow-drying the electrochemically deposited layer with nitrogen gas, a PEDOT:Pss (Baytron P VP A1 4083) layer was spin coated on the top at 8000 rpm followed by annealing at 140 °C for 10 min on a blocking layer to prevent direct contact of P3HT:PCBM blend with ITO substrate. As a reference device, only a spin-coated PEDOT:Pss layer was used. Then P3HT (from Aldrich, regioregularity ≥90.0%) and PCBM (from Nano-C (99.5% purity)) were separately dissolved in chlorobenzne, and then blended together with 1:0.8 wt/wt ratio. The blend solution was spin coated at 800 rpm for 30 s (the thickness was determined by AFM, ca. 120 nm), followed by drying in a covered petri dish for 20 min as that reported in ref. 9. Subsequently, a ∼150 nm aluminium film was deposited on the top of the active layer in vacuum (<1.5 × 10−5 Pa) to produce a complete device and was then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in vacuum to improve its crystallinity of the P3HT:PCBM blend. The spin-coating process was conducted in air, the device performance could be reduced due to the moisture and oxygen28 in comparison to devices fabricated in a glove box purged with nitrogen.

Characterization of PEDOT:Pss layer and device
The morphologies of the PEDOT:Pss layer were examined by electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6700F) and AFM (Veeco Metrology Group, Dimension 3100 SPM) using tapping-mode. The UV-vis transmission and absorption spectra were measured using Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. XRD spectra were conducted using a D8 advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS, German) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The characteristics of current density (J) versus voltage (V) were measured by Keithley 2420 in dark and under illumination of an Oriel solar simulator with 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G spectrum as well. The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated by standard Si photovoltaic cell. The area of all tested devices was 5.5 ± 0.2 mm2. All measurements were carried out in air at room temperature without encapsulation.
Results and discussion
Electrochemical polymerization is an economic and convenient method to deposit conducting polymer nanostructures.29,30 The morphology and electronic properties of PEDOT:Pss can be simply controlled by electrochemical polymerization conditions such as potential, current density, deposition time, monomer concentrations.31–33Table 1 lists the synthetic conditions and Fig. 2a–d show the resulted morphologies of the film characterized by SEM. The surface of PEDOT:Pss film prepared under condition A exhibits non-uniform distributed clusters with variable sizes in a range of 20–70 nm and a network structure connecting the clusters with the ITO surface. With condition C, the morphology (Fig. 2c) shows a continuous film. The PEDOT:Pss layer prepared by condition B exhibits a homogeneous island-like structure with diameters in a range of 30–70 nm and a density of ∼5 × 1011 cm−2. With condition D, the PEDOT:Pss film surface shows a uniform column-like structure with diameters in a range of 20–30 nm, column space in a range of 10–20 nm and high density (about 8 × 1011 cm−2) (Fig. 2d). It is very likely that the two level-constant current electropolymerization with high and low current density, respectively, could well control the nucleation and growth of PEDOT:Pss to produce a uniform column-like nanostructure. Our previous work has studied the detailed mechanism of the electrochemical polymerization of a conductive polymer.34

The scale is 100 nm. The corresponding large area FE-SEM images of different PEDOT:Pss layers are shown in the ESI(Fig. S1),† indicating whatever the experimental condition is, the surfaces of PEDOT:Pss by electrochemical polymerization are quite uniform on ITO substrate. 
The morphologies of PEDOT:Pss films prepared by spin coating and electrochemical polymerization are also distinguished by the AFM images (Fig. 3). The spin-coated film surface with rms roughness of ∼1.5 nm is quite smooth, while the electrochemically polymerized ones under conditions A and D are very rough with a rms roughness of 6.1 and 7.2 nm, respectively. The column-like structure produced by condition D is uniformly distributed on the ITO surface with high surface density of column-like structures. Based on SEM and AFM measurements, the condition D-deposited column structure has a surface “column” density of ∼8 × 1011 cm−2, an average diameter of ∼30 nm and column space of ∼10–20 nm. The results may indicate that the interface contact area of PEDOT and P3HT:PCBM could be increased by filling the nano-structured PEDOT:Pss layer with the P3HT:PCBM blend (∼10 nm in diameter),6,8,35 thus benefiting the hole transport in a polymer solar cell. The insertion of the electrochemically synthesized PEDOT:Pss nanostructure between ITO and the spin-coated PEDOT:Pss layer has a minor effect on the transmittance of ITO/PEDOT:Pss structure, since the measured average transmittances in the region 350–800 nm are about the same (∼82–84%) for both spin-coated and electrochemically deposited nanostructure + spin-coated PEDOT:Pss structures (see ESI, Fig. S2).†

Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves measured under AM 1.5G conditions and in dark for P3HT:PCBM solar cells made with different PEDOT:Pss buffer layers. The performance parameters obtained are summarized in Table 2. The spin-coated buffer based device (baseline) has a PCE of 2.56% (Jsc = 7.10 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.602 V, and FF = 60%), which is comparable to the reported values.36,37 As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, the device fabricated with electrochemically polymerized + spin-coated PEDOT:Pss composite buffer layer shows enhanced Voc compared with the baseline. Previous studies38–40 have demonstrated that the work-function of PEDOT:Pss layer can be modified by doping Pss. We believe that the slight enhancement of Voc comes from the higher work-function of the electrochemically polymerized PEDOT:Pss layer than that of the spin-coated one. The device made under condition C shows nearly the same Jsc and FF as the baseline device. The enhancement of PCE is due to a slightly increased Voc. As discussed above, Fig. 2c shows that the surface of the electrochemically polymerized PEDOT:Pss under condition C is a nearly continuous film, in which only some large island exists but without column-like structures. Such a continuous PEDOT:Pss buffer layer is hard to improve the carrier transport.

The most efficient device is the one fabricated under condition D, showing PCE of 3.86% under 1 Sun (Jsc = 10.46 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.615 V, and FF = 60%), which is about 50% higher than that of the baseline device. The devices made under conditions A and B have the same Voc and FF as the device made under condition D, but smaller Jsc than the latter, thus resulting in lower PCEs. As shown in FE-SEM and AFM images, the nanostructure of PEDOT:Pss polymerized under condition D is quite uniform with a higher interface contact surface area than the others, indicating that the higher Jsc is caused by the nanostructure. It is believed that the penetration of an electrochemically produced column-like nanostructure into the P3HT:PCBM film significantly increases the contact interface area to enhance carrier transport for higher Jsc. This can be verified by the J–V characteristic of devices in the dark (Fig. 4b) that the current density of the device with an additional electrochemically polymerized PEDOT:Pss layer is quite larger than that of the baseline device at forward-bias and the device dark current is affected by the structure of the PEDOT:Pss buffer layer. The influence of the additional buffer layer on the carrier transport can be estimated by the device series resistance (Rs).9,41 As listed in Table 2, the series resistance of the device with the additional electrochemically polymerized layer is lower than those without such a polymerized layer. This may be contributed from not only the enlarged interface surface area through the nanostructure penetrations, but also the covalent bonds between the electrochemically polymerized layer and the ITO surface42 to minimize the density of interface defects and thus reduce the contact resistance.
To further elucidate the influence of the structure of PEDOT:Pss on solar cell performance, the relation between the buffer layer surface property such as surface area and roughness deduced from AFM measurements and Jsc is summarized in Fig. 5, illustrating that the surface area and rms roughness of the electrochemically prepared PEDOT:Pss layer is much larger than the spin-coated one, and Jsc increases with increase of the surface area. For example, the surface area of the condition D prepared PEDOT:Pss layer is 5.1 μm2 for 4 μm2 scan area, which is about 25% larger than that of the spin-coated one (∼4.05 μm2), resulting in Jsc increase by 47% compared with the baseline cell (from 7.1 to 10.46 mA cm−2). It is known that increasing the surface area of the PEDOT:Pss layer leads to a larger interface area of PEDOT:Pss/P3HT:PCBM blend, which can mainly enhance the hole transport in a device. The fundamental limitation of the photocurrent of a polymer solar cell is from its low hole mobility in the donor polymer.43 In P3HT:PCBM solar cells, the electron mobility (3 × 10−7 m2 V−1 s−1) is one order larger than the hole mobility (2 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1).44–48 It is essential to improve the hole transport in a device to suppress the recombination of free electrons and holes for a larger Jsc. Thus the increased interfacial surface area by the electrochemically prepared buffer layer has a particular significance in Jsc enhancement.
 Fig. 5  Short-circuit current of the polymer solar cell versus the surface area of different PEDOT:Pss layers. All surface area and rms roughness data of PEDOT:Pss layer are deduced from the surface with area of 2 × 2 μm2. In the figure, A–D represent the different electrochemically polymerized PEDOT:Pss layer. The rms roughness of different PEDOT:Pss layers is also shown in the figure. 

Fig. 6 shows the measured morphologies of P3HT:PCBM blend films of different devices by detaching Al electrodes with an adhesive tape. The spin-coated PEDOT:Pss buffer layer results in a smooth P3HT:PCBM blend with rms roughness of 2.0 nm, which is consistent with previous results,9,49 but the devices with additional PEDOT:Pss electrochemically polymerized layers under conditions A and D display an island morphology of the P3HT:PCBM blend film with rms roughness of 4.7 and 5.9 nm, respectively, which are similar to those shown in Fig. 2a and d (Fig. 6c shows the morphology of the blend film with similar features as that in Fig. 2c). It can be inferred that the electrochemically deposited PEDOT:Pss layer can retain its nanostructure after its top spin-coated PEDOT:Pss deposition to further positively affect the P3HT:PCBM blend structure. The rougher morphology of the P3HT:PCBM blend film further supports the conclusion that the column-like structure can penetrate into the P3HT:PCBM blend film with better contact and large transport area, becoming an efficient pathway for hole transport. This enhancement mechanism can be schematically illustrated in Fig. 6e.

The UV-visible and XRD spectra were conducted to identify the structure of the polymer blend on two kinds of buffer layers. Almost identical UV-vis spectra of the active layers on two kinds of PEDOT:Pss layers (see ESI, Fig. S3) rule out that the Jsc increase is from absorption enhancement. It has been reported that the phase-separation of P3HT:PCBM blend and charge transport of the device are strongly related to the crystallinity of the heterojunction materials.1,2,9,44,50Fig. 7 shows the X-ray diffraction of the blend polymer film on the two kinds of PEDOT:Pss layers. The peaks at ∼5° (corresponding to the interchain spacing in P3HT associated with the interdigitated alkyl chains)51 of P3HT:PCBM blend films on the spin-coated + the electrochemically polymerized PEDOT:Pss composite buffer layer show larger intensity than that of the spin-coated PEDOT:Pss only buffer layer, indicating better crystallinity of P3HT on the nanostructured PEDOT:Pss layer, thus also benefiting the hole transport. This result is consistent with previous studies that the crystallinity of P3HT can be improved by nano-confinement of the P3HT:PCBM blend films.25,26

Conclusions
A novel electrochemically polymerized column-like PEDOT:Pss nanostructure with a uniform and high interface contact surface on the ITO surface was used as the buffer layer to fabricate polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells, demonstrating significantly enhanced Jsc in comparison with the conventional cells. The results clearly show that the better connection between electrochemically polymerized PEDOT:Pss and ITO substrate and the penetration of the formed highly dense column-like nanostructured PEDOT:Pss into P3HT:PCBM blend film mainly contributes to Jsc increase. Electrochemical polymerization is compatible with state-of-the-art bulk heterojunction solar cells and can be adapted for a high throughput, low cost manufacturing process. This economic and facile approach provides a new promising nanostructure to replace inorganic nanorods as an efficient pathway for improvement of charge transport in the bulk heterojunction solar cell.

Broader context
The use of a vertically aligned nanostructure is one of the effective tactics to improve charge transport and reduce recombination in a polymer solar cell. In this work, different electrochemical techniques are investigated to electropolymerize various nano-structured PEDOT : Pss thin films, of which one with a uniform column-like nanostructure as the buffer layer can provide an efficient pathway to enhance the hole transport in a polymer solar cell, resulting in a substantial increase of power conversion efficiency in comparison to that with a spin-coated PEDOT: Pss buffer layer. Most importantly, this approach is compatible with the state-of-the-art bulk heterojunction solar cells to offer a high throughput, low cost manufacturing process with a great commercialization potential.
