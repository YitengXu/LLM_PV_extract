    , Accepted 24th October 2016First published on 25th October 2016AbstractThe fine alignment of molecular energy levels can efficiently enhance the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and improve the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a novel polythiophene derivative donor with a low HOMO level of −5.6 eV was synthesized by copolymerizing carboxylate- and fluorine-substituted thiophene alternately. The introduction of fluorine downshifted the HOMO level of the polymer. On the other hand, a methyl-end-capped ITIC derivative, with elevated HOMO and LUMO levels, was selected as the acceptor in the pursuit of a higher VOC. A best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.6% with an extremely high VOC of 1.13 V can be obtained after careful morphology optimization. Besides, an unprecedented energy loss of 0.46 eV is seen in this device, which is comparable to perovskite solar cells and has been rarely achieved before in bulk heterojunction PSCs.
Introduction
The past decades have seen many significant achievements in the field of polymer solar cells (PSCs), with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of state-of-the-art devices surpassing 11% recently.1–3 As an alternative implementation for solar energy conversion with cost competitiveness, however, the device performance of organic photovoltaics still lags behind that of their inorganic counterparts.4 The bright outlook for PSCs has initiated a lot of investigative and predictive studies of the upper limits of PCE, in which the determination of energy loss (Eloss) is an issue that must be addressed as well as the determination of the maximum open-circuit voltage (VOC).5–7 Compared with their inorganic counterparts, including the perovskite solar cells, the significant intrinsic electronic disorder and the low dielectric constant of organic semiconductors bring about a more severe Eloss due to the recombination of charge carriers.8–10 Specifically, the VOC of perovskite solar cells can be as high as 1.1 V with a corresponding Eloss of 0.5 V,11 while in fullerene-based PSC devices with a similar optical bandgap, a VOC over 0.9 V is seldom seen. It is widely acknowledged that the general energy loss is 0.7 to 1.0 eV in efficient PSCs, when evaluated by comparing the optical band gap (Eg) with the VOC.12–16 Hence, although the quantum yield for converting photons into free charges can be nearly unity,17 the maximum achievable VOC falls short of the prediction limits. From this perspective, there is much room left for further improving the PCE. Many attempts have been made to construct PSC devices with a considerably high VOC or reduced Eloss.12–15,18–24 However, a dilemma lies in the fact that the photovoltaic conversion seems to be hampered in the devices with an extremely high VOC, as manifested in the significantly decreased short-circuit current density (JSC) and quantum yields.25,26 McGehee et al.26 interpreted that the driving force for charge transfer may be too small for efficient current generation in polymer:fullerene solar cells with VOC values above 1.0 V due to the existence of subgap charge-transfer (CT) bands.27
During the past decade, the PCE of fullerene-free PSC devices advanced rapidly, which set a new stage for the development of organic photovoltaics.1,28–32 Compared with fullerene-based acceptors, chemical modification is easier to implement in the non-fullerene acceptors, which endows them with great adjustability of energy levels, absorption spectra and molecular arrangement.33–36 Thus, the VOC can be tuned more efficiently considering that it is proportional to the offset between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor:  
Recently, many fullerene-free PSCs have been reported with a high VOC and a minor energy level offset between the donor and acceptor (D/A), i.e. ΔHOMO and/or ΔLUMO, which is less than the widely-acknowledged 0.3 eV of energy needed for dissociating the tightly-bound Frenkel excitons to produce spatially separated charges.1,14,37 It is confusing that the charge transfer occurs efficiently with such a narrow energy offset. Although the underlying origins of the driving force for charge transfer in such cases remain to be discussed (it may be the dipolar interaction, the favorable intermolecular arrangement and the morphology effect),38–40 it is worth noting that the VOC of fullerene-free PSCs indeed increased in comparison with that of their fullerene counterparts in some way. For example, we have found that the fullerene-free PSCs can work efficiently in spite of their much smaller ΔHOMO of 0.18 eV and driving energy for charge transfer of 0.09 eV (estimated from the difference between the energy of the CT state and the Eg) compared to the polymer:fullerene combination, coinciding with their enhanced VOC values.1 Therefore, minimizing the energy level offset between D/A to make it as small as possible in the fullerene-free PSCs may be a potential solution for constructing high-VOC devices.
Fluorination of polymer donors is a facile and feasible strategy to reduce the HOMO and LUMO energy levels simultaneously without sacrificing the absorption spectrum, which made it a widely adopted method in improving the devices' VOC.41–44 In previous work, we have reported an efficient photovoltaic polymer PDCBT, and a PCE of over 10% with a VOC of 0.94 V was acquired when blending it with the non-fullerene acceptor 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC).45 In order to enhance the VOC of the corresponding device, fluorine atoms were attached to the backbone of PDCBT and a new polythiophene derivative was synthesized, namely PDCBT-2F, as shown in Fig. 1. Benefiting from the introduction of fluorine, both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer downshifted with the optical bandgap being almost unchanged. On the other hand, the VOC also involves the molecular energy of the acceptor as discussed above. Hence, IT-M, a methyl-end-capped ITIC derivate, was selected as the electron acceptor.46 Both the LUMO and HOMO are elevated due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl group, which is favorable for enhancing VOC further and minimizing ΔHOMO as desired. The energy diagram of the donor and acceptor is depicted in Fig. 2a. It should be emphasised that although the HOMO energy levels of the two components are nearly equal, the photoinduced charge transfer process still functioned well, and a PCE of 6.6% with a very high VOC of 1.13 V can be obtained after careful morphology and architecture optimization. In addition, an unprecedented energy loss of 0.46 eV was seen in this device, which is comparable to inorganic solar cells and has been rarely achieved before in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the polymer
The polymerization of PDCBT-2F is depicted in Fig. 1. The synthesis of compounds 1 and 2, i.e. bis(2-hexyldecyl)-5,5′-dibromo-[2,2′-bithiophene]-4,4′-dicarboxylate and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-(3,3′-difluoro)-2,2′-bithiophene has been reported in previous work.47,48 The alkyl side chains of compound 1 were extended in order to counteract the adverse effect on solvation resulting from the introduction of fluorine. Then, PDCBT-2F was prepared by the Stille coupling reaction. The detailed synthesis procedure can be found in the Experimental section. High temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weight by using monodispersed polystyrene as the standard and chlorobenzene as the eluent. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PDCBT-2F is 27k with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.98. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. The thermal decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss of the polymer is 365 °C (more details can be found in the ESI†).
Optical properties and molecular energy levels
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the newly synthesized polymer in solid film and in chloroform (CF) solution are displayed in Fig. 2. The main absorption peak of the film is centered at 518 nm with a maximum absorption coefficient of ca. 8.5 × 104 cm−1, and the absorption onset is 652 nm corresponding to an optical bandgap of 1.90 eV. From the film to the solution, the absorption edge blue-shifts by ca. 15 nm with fading of the weak vibronic shoulder in the longer wavelength which implies the existence of ordered aggregation and strong π–π stacking interaction in the polymer film. The film absorption of IT-M is also presented in Fig. 2. It is obvious that PDCBT-2F demonstrates a well matched spectrum with IT-M, as they have different maximum absorption peaks, and together they have a broad coverage from 300 to 800 nm, which is favorable for light harvesting.
The HOMO level of PDCBT-2F was estimated from the onset oxidation potential determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement. The polymer donor possesses a low HOMO level of −5.59 eV assuming Fc/Fc+, the external standard, to be 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. In order to assess the energy level distribution between the donor and the acceptor, the p-doping curves of IT-M are also offered in parallel, and its HOMO level was estimated to be −5.56 eV. Clearly, PDCBT-2F has almost the same HOMO level as IT-M. The LUMO level of PDCBT-2F was determined to be −3.69 eV on the basis of the optical bandgap and the HOMO level, and is labelled in Fig. 2a.
Photovoltaic performance
According to the CV measurements, it should be noted that the HOMO level offset between the donor and the acceptor is close to zero, and such a minor offset is supposed to be insufficient for charge transfer in the traditional fullerene model. Hence, we fabricated the PSC devices by adopting the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDCBT-2F:IT-M/PFN-Br/Al in order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the blend, where PFN-Br is a conjugated polyelectrolyte and has been widely used as an electrode buffer layer in organic electronic devices.49,50 The devices' fabrication conditions including the D/A weight ratio, solvent additives and thermal annealing (TA) have all been carefully tuned in order to achieve the best performance. The blend solution was prepared in CF with a polymer concentration of 8 mg ml−1. The optimal D/A ratio was found to be 1.5:1 (detailed information can be seen in the ESI†). The as-cast film showed a very high VOC of 1.16 V with a PCE of 4.3%. In addition, some additives including 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and diphenyl ether (DPE) were introduced to tune the film morphology, respectively. However, a positive effect in elevating the PCE could only be seen when DPE was added, while the other three deteriorated the photovoltaic performance. Then the TA treatment temperature was varied between 100, 120, 140 and 160 °C (more information in detail can be found in the ESI†). Finally, combining the trace amount of additive (1 vol% DPE) and the TA procedure (120 °C for 10 minutes), an optimal PCE of 6.6% with a remarkable VOC of 1.13 V, a JSC of 10.43 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.557 was achieved (Table 1). The corresponding J–V curves are depicted in Fig. 3a. Given that the minimal optical gap of this D/A system is only 1.59 eV, strikingly the Eloss is only 0.46 eV, which is comparable to those of inorganic solar cells and has never been seen before in BHJ PSCs, as far as we know.

An external quantum efficiency (EQE) test (as shown in Fig. 3b) was performed to investigate the spectrum response of the device and to verify the JSC value obtained from the J–V test. The integrated current density value of the best device is 10.12 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the JSC obtained from the J–V test. In addition, the EQE spectrum covered from 300 to 790 nm, and a maximum EQE of 50% was observed at ca. 520 nm, which is rare in PSC devices with such high VOC and low Eloss.
Charge generation, recombination and transport
The charge generation and exciton dissociation processes were investigated by performing photocurrent analysis. Photocurrent density (Jph) was extracted from the J–V curves under light and dark conditions and plotted versus effective voltage (Veff) in Fig. 3c, where Veff = V0 − V (V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0). As shown in this figure, Jph shows a very strong field-dependence across a large bias range and does not fully saturate even at a high Veff over 10 V. The saturation current density (Jsat) is in fact over 16.6 mA cm−2, the maximum achievable Jph, considering it can be hardly saturated under limited reverse bias. Therefore, the charge carrier collection probability (Pcoll) under short-circuit conditions is less than 60%, when the value is calculated based on the assumption that Jsat = 16.6 mA cm−2. These results suggest that the exciton dissociation and charge extraction processes are hindered severely in this case while most highly efficient devices possess a Pcoll of around 90%,51 which can account for the lower JSC and PCE. The inferior Pcoll may be caused by the difficult separation of geminate electron–hole pairs under short-circuit conditions which can be easily achieved under the assistance of a strong electric field.26 Another complimentary possibility is that poor charge transport and/or nongeminate recombination hamper the charge extraction.52
Since geminate recombination is independent of charge carrier density as well as light intensity, the dependence characterisation of JSC and VOC at various light intensities was performed in order to analyse the nongeminate charge recombination dynamics of the devices.53 The correlation between JSC and light intensity (Plight) can be expressed as a power-law equation of JSC ∝ PlightS. A three-quarters power dependence on light intensity of JSC, i.e. S = 0.75, has been demonstrated in space-charge-limited devices, which results from the imbalance in charge mobilities.54 Generally, weak bimolecular recombination would lead to a linear dependence with an S value approaching 1. The extracted S value here is 1.0 (Fig. 3d), however, this should not be taken as evidence that there is no bimolecular recombination. Many examples have shown that the devices dominated by bimolecular recombination can also exhibit such a linear dependence.52
Another nongeminate recombination mechanism, referring to the degree of trap-assisted recombination, can be probed by fitting the equation of VOC ∝ kBT/qln(Plight), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature and q is elementary charge.53 In a bimolecular-recombination-dominated device the slope is kBT/q, while for a device with trap-assisted recombination dominating, a slope of 2 kBT/q is observed. As shown in Fig. 3d, the PDCBT-2F:IT-M device demonstrates a slope of 0.97 kBT/q (T = 300 K), suggesting that the trap-assisted recombination here was rather minor and bimolecular recombination may play the dominant role under open-circuit conditions.
In order to evaluate the charge transport and prove the nongeminate recombination mechanism, the hole and electron charge-carrier mobilities (μh and μe) were estimated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The device architectures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Blend/Au and ITO/ZnO/blend/Al were adopted to fabricate the hole-only and electron-only diodes, respectively. Applying the Mott–Gurney law of J = 9ε0εrμV2/(8L3) to fit the J–V curves of both the hole-only and electron-only diodes (as shown in Fig. 4a), the mobilities were determined accordingly from the intercept.52 Here, μh was 5.46 × 10−6 cm2 (V−1 s−1) and μe was 3.31 × 10−6 cm2 (V−1 s−1). The balanced hole–electron mobility doesn't lead to a space-charge-limited current, which is in good agreement with that which was concluded from the correlation between JSC and Plight. However, the relatively low mobility value means that a stronger electric field is needed to sweep out all of the charge carriers before they recombine, which may be responsible for the drastically reduced JSC in comparison with the relatively high Jsat value.52

Photoluminescence (PL) of the solid film is a useful tool for deducing information on the degree of phase separation and the photoinduced charge transfer. Fig. 4b depicts the PL spectra of the PDCBT-2F film, the IT-M film and the blend film. The excitation wavelengths for the donor and acceptor were 500 nm and 700 nm, respectively, and quartz was used as the substrate. The PL spectrum covered from 600 to 790 nm for the donor and from 700 to 870 nm for the acceptor. The spectral shape of the emission from the blend film (excited at either 500 nm or 700 nm) resembled that of the pure IT-M, which implied the complete quenching of PDCBT-2F emission and some residual fluorescence of the acceptor. These results indicate that almost all of the excitons initially generated on the polymer underwent efficient energy transfer to the electron acceptor at the heterojunction. On the other hand, some acceptor excitons decayed to the ground state instead of dissociating into spatially separated charges.
Taking the charge generation, transport and recombination into account, it is evident that the PDCBT-2F:IT-M system is less affected by the trap and space charge effects. Poor charge transport resulted in inferior charge extraction under forward bias and thus charge carriers decayed through nongeminate recombination. In addition, the PL test showed that the charge transfer from the acceptor to the donor was hampered, which suggested that geminate recombination may also contribute to the modest JSC and FF. Further investigations are needed to identify the dominant constraints of the modest PCE in more detail.
With a similar optical bandgap (ca. 1.6 eV) to perovskite solar cells, the PSC devices based on PDCBT-2F:IT-M attained almost the same level in both VOC (1.13 eV) and Eloss (0.46 eV) as the former, which has been almost never realized before in this field. However, the EQE and FF are still far behind those of the perovskite counterparts, limiting the further enhancement of photovoltaic performance. If the charge mobility and extraction could be improved significantly, for example, by carefully selecting the electrode buffer layer, higher PCE could be anticipated.
Film morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to reveal the surface and bulk morphology of the blend films. In order to gain a good understanding of the morphology evolution, the microscope images of both the as-cast film and the additive & TA film are shown in Fig. 5. The donor exhibited a fibril like appearance with crystalline structures, as seen in the TEM images. The as-cast blend film showed a smooth morphology with a root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.06 nm. The phase separation could hardly be distinguished from the AFM phase images. After introducing the additives and thermal annealing, the blend film showed relatively clear phase separation and the RMS value also increased to 1.90 nm. The fibril-shape domains of the donor enlarged obviously. The improved phase separation is favorable for forming bicontinuous channels for charge transport and suppressing bimolecular recombination, thus resulting in the higher JSC and FF.

Thermal stability
Considering that PSC devices usually work at high temperature due to solar illumination, good thermal stability of photovoltaic performance is beneficial for their application and commercialization. Non-fullerene acceptors have an edge over their fullerene derivatives in terms of the thermal stability of the film morphology, because these acceptors are unlike spherical PC71BM molecules which have a strong tendency to form large aggregates.1,55 Hence, we carried out a thermal stability test of the PDCBT-2F:IT-M devices by annealing the active layer under high temperature for a long time. Yang et al. concluded that degradation in PSCs may occur in the bulk of the active layer, the metal electrode and the interface between the active layer and electrode.56 In order to separate and identify the degradation of the film morphology from that of the electrode and the interface, the active layers without electrodes were subject to heat treatment (annealing at 100 °C) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, PFN-Br and Al electrodes were spin-coated and deposited on the active layers in sequence after the annealing procedure. The photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 6. Even after annealing the active layer at 100 °C for 100 hours, the PCE of the PDCBT-2F:IT-M-based devices only showed a slight drop, which suggested excellent thermal stability of the film morphology. We think that the strong intermolecular interaction between conjugated backbones stabilizes the morphology of the blend, and restricts movement and aggregation of the small molecules.57

Conclusions
In summary, a polythiophene derivative donor with a low HOMO level of −5.6 eV was designed and synthesized. In the pursuit of PSC devices with high VOC, fluorine atoms were introduced to simultaneously downshift the HOMO and LUMO levels of the donor. After selecting IT-M, with almost the same HOMO level as PDCBT-2F, as the non-fullerene acceptor, the PSCs exhibited a maximum PCE of 6.6% and a VOC as high as 1.13 V with an unprecedented Eloss of 0.46 eV. This very minor energy loss is around the same level as that of inorganic counterparts, in spite of the rather moderate PCE. Fig. 7 summarizes some efficient organic solar cells recently reported with low Eloss or high VOC (the corresponding details including references can be found in the ESI†). It is obvious that PDCBT-2F:IT-M exhibited remarkable photovoltaic features among them, with outstanding VOC and Eloss.

We carefully investigated the charge recombination and transport, film morphology and other factors, and concluded that the poor charge transport and geminate recombination may hamper the charge collection and thus limit the further improvement of JSC and FF. As many examples have been reported where the negligible driving force (evaluated by either ΔHOMO or ΔLUMO) seems to ensure efficient photovoltaic conversion, the decreased Eloss rather than the minor energy level offset should be responsible for the moderate photovoltaic performance. We believe that a certain degree of Eloss is a prerequisite for efficient charge transport. However, these results indicate that the non-fullerene acceptors exhibited great potential in constructing high performance PSCs with enhanced voltage and improved energy loss. On the other hand, minimizing the energy level offset would also be a crucial consideration when rationally designing and matching donors and acceptors in the future.

Instruments and measurements
A Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer was used to record 1H NMR spectra at room temperature. Elemental analysis data were recorded on a flash EA1112 analyzer. Absorption spectra of polymers in solid films were acquired from a Hitachi UH5300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The CV measurements were performed on a CHI650D Electrochemical Workstation. Glassy carbon, platinum wire, Ag/Ag+ and tetra-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M, Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, reference electrode and electrolyte, respectively. The J–V tests were carried out under a 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G spectrum through a Class AAA solar simulator.

Fabrication of the PSC devices
The PSC architecture adopted here was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. The devices were fabricated using the following procedures successively. At first, ITO glasses were cleaned by a surfactant scrub, water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath. Then, UV-ozone treatment was performed on the ITO surface for 15 minutes prior to the spin-coating of the PEDOT:PSS layer (35 nm thick). Annealing of PEDOT:PSS at 150 °C for 15 min was needed before moving it into a glove box with a nitrogen atmosphere to proceed with the next steps. The donor and acceptor were dissolved in CF at room temperature for more than 4 h with stirring to prepare the blend solution (8 mg ml−1, according to the polymer weight concentration). After the spin-coating of the active layer on the PEDOT:PSS, PFN-Br methanol solution (0.5 mg ml−1) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm on the active layer. Finally, about 100 nm of Al was deposited onto the active layer under high vacuum as the cathode with an effective cell area of 3.70 mm2.
