    , Accepted 6th April 2020First published on 6th April 2020AbstractLarge-area, free-standing silver (Ag) nanowire (NW) transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) are fabricated by a facile and high-throughput automatic-blade-coating assembly technique, enabled by the use of a flexible and transparent polymer matrix. Such developed TCEs exhibit high transparency, excellent conductivity, superior flexibility, long-term stability and strong structural integrity. The excellent flexibility allows the TCEs to be bent >10000 times without any performance degradation. As a proof of concept, these TCEs are used to fabricate flexible suspended particle devices (SPDs) for smart window applications. Our devices show a large change in their optical transmittance (60.2%) and fast switching time (21 s) as well as excellent stability, comparable to the best SPD performance data reported in the literature. Moreover, significantly better than commercial TCE-based devices, the SPDs based on our TCEs show excellent mechanical flexibility, which can be folded by 180° for more than 200 cycles without any obvious performance degradation. The present method for fabricating large area and ultra-flexible Ag NW TCEs may be extended to fabricate various NW-based nonplanar or curved electronic/optoelectronic devices in the future.
1. Introduction
Transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) are an essential component in various optoelectronic devices, including touch screen panels, liquid crystal displays, organic light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and smart windows.1–4 Indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films have been widely used in TCEs due to their excellent electronic properties and optical transparency.5–7 However, their industrial applications are limited by their high production cost and the scarcity of indium resources in the long run. What's more, the brittleness of ITO makes them incompatible for flexible devices.8–10 Considering all these challenges, alternative materials, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, metal meshes and metal nanowires (NWs), have been explored for the preparation of flexible electrodes for replacing ITO-based electrodes in next-generation optoelectronics.11–15 Among these materials, the networks of metal NWs hold great promise because of their high electrical conductivity and optical transmittance.16–19 Copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) have been considered as two of the best candidate metal materials for TCEs.20–22 Cu, however, is extremely vulnerable to species like H2O and O2, and suffers from rapid oxidation and consequently steep performance decline.23–27
Ag, as another very promising candidate for TCEs, has the highest electrical conductivity (6.3 × 107 S m−1) among all the metals and better oxidation/corrosion resistance than Cu, which provides it with huge market opportunities.28 High optical and electrical performance was obtained for Ag NW-based TCEs by a number of groups.29–32 However, these TCEs, while promising, suffer from inherent limitations that severely restrict their widespread practical application. For instance, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) has been widely used in the production of Ag NWs, which however introduces an insulating barrier around each NW and thus dramatically increases the contact resistance between NWs and decreases the overall electrical conductivity of TCEs. Common strategies, involving heating and plasmonic treatments, to get rid of the ligand layer often lead to damage to the plastic substrates and are not suitable for flexible device applications. Regarding electrode fabrication, various solution-based processes, such as spin coating,33 spray coating,34 vacuum filtration35 and rod coating,36 have been developed to prepare flexible TCEs. For example, Zhang and co-workers37 used a spin coating method to prepare a flexible Ag NW-polyethylenenaphthalate (PEN) TCE and applied it for solar cell applications. The Ag NW-PEN TCE showed comparable transparency and conductivity to a traditional ITO-based electrode. A very recent study by Won and co-workers38 reported a vacuum filtration method that achieved an ultra-thin/flexible Ag NW-polyimide (PI) TCE for electronic skin applications. The Ag NW-PI TCE showed excellent flexibility and stretchability and comparable electrical and optical properties to ITO electrodes. Dong and co-workers39 demonstrated flexible and high-performance Ag NW-PI TCEs prepared by a spin coating and patterning method and their use in nonfullerene organic solar cells. The fabricated flexible solar cells displayed a power conversion efficiency of 11.6%. However, these conventional film deposition processes cause several drawbacks for TCE applications, such as a non-uniform morphology, difficulty of scale-up, high junction resistance between NWs, poor adhesion to the substrate and low stability in harsh environments. To address these issues, alternative approaches, such as Langmuir–Blodgett,40 capillary printing,41 and modified bar coating,42 have also been attempted. However, the development of simple, scalable and cost-effective fabrication techniques for producing large-area, uniform, robust and flexible Ag NW TCEs still remains a great challenge.
In this paper, we scaled up the synthesis of Ag NWs by 200 times (from milligrams to 3.3 g in a one-batch synthesis) without using any additional organic stabilizers and further, developed a simple and low-cost method to produce large-area and high-performance transparent electrodes based on Ag NWs embedded in polymer films by scalable, automatic blade coating. The developed Ag NW TCEs showed high air stability and exhibited low sheet resistance with high optical transmittance, comparable to commercially available ITO TCEs. Moreover, unlike commercial ITO-based, flexible TCEs, they did not show any sign of the formation of cracks under mechanical stress and thereby demonstrated superior flexibility. As a proof of concept, we developed large-area (9 × 9 cm2) and ultra-flexible (folding angle up to 180°) Ag NW TCE-based suspended particle smart window devices for the first time. Smart windows are considered as the most promising alternative to traditional windows, which can smartly regulate indoor solar radiation by changing their optical transmittance in response to voltage or heat.43,44 However, the electrode technology in flexible smart windows remains stagnant, wherein inflexible ITO has been the main electrode material. By applying our Ag NW TCEs, the developed large-area, flexible SPDs can switch uniformly and rapidly (with 21 s response time) between transparent and opaque states. We further made “a smart beaker” by simply wrapping an ultra-flexible SPD around a laboratory beaker, straightforwardly demonstrating the concept of curved smart glass application. This work represents the first report of completely flexible SPDs using Ag NW networks as TCEs, which show much higher flexibility than commercial ITO-polyethylene terephthalate (PET) TCE-based flexible SPDs fabricated under the same conditions, while keeping all other device performances (e.g., response time, on-off transmittance variation amplitude, etc.) comparable. The outstanding performance of our Ag NW TCE-based SPDs suggests a promising avenue to develop a low cost TCE technology and flexible SPDs. Furthermore, the use of such TCEs in other flexible and extra-large electronics, such as nonplanar touch panel and curved displays, is expected to be readily implemented.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, >98%) and silver nitrate (AgNO3, >99.9%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. Ethylene glycol (EG, anhydrous, 99.8%), iodine (I2, 99.999%), 3-glydidoxypropylmethyl dimethoxy silane (97%), lauryl methacrylate (96%), 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (98%), calcium iodide (CaI2, 99.95%), 3-acryloxypropylmethyl dimethoxy silane (95%) and trimethylmethoxy silane were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. Sodium chloride (NaCl, lab grade), isoamyl acetate (>99%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, >99.5%), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (97%), 2-ethylhexanoate (≥99%), toluene (≥99.5%), acetic acid (≥99.7%), phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide, pyrazine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid dehydrate (2,5-PDA, 95%), ethanol and methanol (99.9%) were purchased from Fisher Scientific Co. The support polymer matrix chemical was supplied by Aleene. The ITO PET was purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd. All of the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Large-scale synthesis of Ag NWs
Ag NWs were synthesized by adding AgNO3 into EG with small amounts of NaCl and Fe(NO3)3. Typically, 1260 mL of EG was firstly hosted in a 5 L three-necked, round-bottomed flask at room temperature and heated to 110 °C for 1 h. Then, 30 mL of Fe(NO3)3 (40 mM) solution in EG and 6 mL of NaCl (30 mM) solution in EG were rapidly added to the above preheated EG solution. After 20 min, 300 mL of EG solution containing 5.2 g of AgNO3 was slowly added to the solution mixture. Finally, the mixture was kept at 110 °C for 15 h without magnetic stirring and then quickly quenched to room temperature. Ag NWs were collected by centrifugation, followed by two cycles of washing with IPA. The obtained suspension containing Ag NWs was diluted with IPA to certain concentrations for further use.
2.3 Preparation of large-area and ultra-flexible Ag NW TCEs
Prior to preparing a transparent Ag NW electrode using an automatic doctor blade film coater, the glass or PET substrates were first cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in soap water, acetone, deionized water and IPA sequentially and dried by using nitrogen gas. The Ag NW ink was prepared by dispersing Ag NWs in IPA solvent with a concentration of 5–10 mg mL−1. The glass or PET substrates were then fixed onto a flat vacuum chuck of the doctor blade film coater (as shown in Fig. S1†) with a vacuum pump while the Ag NW ink was pipetted in a line on top of the substrate. A film applicator was then quickly pulled over the Ag NW ink with a traverse pusher, spreading it across the surface of the glass into a thin, uniform film. The speed of the traverse pusher is very important and we found for our case, >50 mm s−1 was suitable. If the speed was below 50 mm s−1, we can't get a uniform NW film. Ag NW films with different transmittance can be obtained simply by varying the concentration of Ag NWs in the ink and the height of the film applicator. After that, a layer of transparent polymer was coated onto the surface of the Ag NW film in the same way and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for several minutes. Finally, the flexible, thin, free-standing Ag NW TCE was peeled off from the glass substrate.
2.4 Synthesis of polyiodide nanorods
In a typical reaction,45 I2 (4.5 g), CaI2 (3 g), nitrocellulose (13 g), and isoamyl acetate (137 mL) were loaded into a 250 mL three-neck flask at room temperature. The mixture was heated to 65 °C and maintained at this temperature for 40 minutes to form a homogeneous solution under vigorous stirring. The solution was then cooled down to 45 °C. After that 2,5-PDA (3 g), methanol (7.6 mL) and deionized water (0.6 mL) were added into the solution and kept at this temperature for 3 hours. The reaction solution was quenched with cold water, and then the mixture was ultrasonicated for 2 hours to form a uniform dispersion. Finally, the product was further purified by the dispersion/centrifugation process using isoamyl acetate to remove excess chemical and re-dispersed in isoamyl acetate for the next step of device preparation or various material characterization techniques mentioned below.
2.5 Preparation of the suspension medium
The suspension medium comprising polyalkylmethacrylate polymer was synthesized following the steps described below.46 First, lauryl methacrylate (48.88 g), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (1.13 g), 1-hexanethiol (4.09 g) and toluene (40 mL) were loaded into a 500 mL three necked flask. The mixture was heated to 60 °C under the protection of argon. Then, 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (0.4 g) dissolved in toluene (20 mL) was added into the flask under vigorous stirring. The reaction cell was kept at this temperature for 21 h and then was refluxed for 3 h. Finally, the purification procedure was carried out by using the short path distillation method at 90 °C.
2.6 Preparation of the polymer matrix
The polymer matrix was a siloxane polymer matrix and prepared by the polymerization of 3-glydidoxypropylmethyl dimethoxy silane and 3-acryloxypropylmethyl dimethoxy silane as follows:47 First, dimethyl diphenyl siloxane copolymer (45 g) was dissolved in toluene (380 mL) and refluxed for 1 h. Then, tin 2-ethylhexanoate (0.04 g) was added to the mixture. After 12 min, 3-glydidoxypropylmethyl dimethoxy (1.5 g) was further introduced. The mixture was allowed to react at 100 °C for 1 h. After that, 3-acryloxypropylmethyl dimethoxy silane (2.5 g) was slowly added dropwise into the mixture within 5 min for the first end-capping step. The capping reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h. Subsequently, trimethylmethoxy silane (15 g) was added for the final end-capping reaction, which lasted for 2 h. The resultant mixture was cooled down to room temperature and filtered by using a filter paper. Finally, the polymer was collected by layer separation and purified through the short path distillation method at 90 °C.
2.7 Fabrication of a large-area flexible Ag NW TCE-based SPD
The Ag NW TCE-based flexible SPD was prepared by a blade coating method. To prepare the flexible SPD, first, the photoactive layer was prepared as follows: a mixed suspension was obtained by mixing the polyiodide nanorods dispersed in isoamyl acetate with the polyalkylmethacrylate polymer. Subsequently, the solvent was distilled by using a rotary evaporator. The above suspension was then mixed with a UV curable siloxane polymer matrix and phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide to form the polymer composite, composed of numerous droplets embedded inside the polymer matrix. After degassing, the viscous polymer matrix with encapsulated droplets was deposited onto the as-prepared Ag NW TCE by blade coating and cured in a UV-ozone chamber for 30 seconds. Finally, the device was achieved by laminating another Ag NW TCE on the cured polymer matrix using a laminator.
2.8 Characterization
The structure of the synthesized Ag NWs was examined using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL 2100F, operated at 200 kV) and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; LYRA3, Tescan, operated at 10 kV). The crystal structure of Ag NWs was further studied by using an X-ray diffraction (XRD; D8 Advance, Bruker) spectrometer, using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15406 nm) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The morphology of the Ag NW TCE was characterized using a SEM (LYRA3, Tescan) operated at 10 kV. Transmission spectra of the Ag NW TCEs and related SPDs were acquired with a Cary 5000 ultroviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectrophotometer (Varian) at a scan rate of 600 nm min−1. The sheet resistance of the Ag NW TCE and ITO-PET TCE was measured by using a four-point probe (S-302). The topography of Ag NWs on glass, Ag NW TCEs and ITO-PET TCEs were investigated by using an atomic force microscopy (AFM; MultiMode 8-HR, Bruker). The bending tests were conducted at a bending rate of about 4 mm s−1 and at different bending angles. The Ag NW TCE and Ag NW TCE-based SPD were prepared by using an MSK-AFA-III-110 film coating system (MTI Corporation). The overall transmittance over the spectral range of 380 to 760 nm of the SPDs was measured by using a LS183 spectrometer (Linshang Technology).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a presents a schematic illustration for the preparation of Ag NW TCEs by a blade coating process using a Ag NWs-in-IPA dispersion. The Ag NWs were synthesized through a modified polyol process. The polyol process has been the most promising method for the production of Ag NWs by using PVP as a capping agent and ethylene glycol (EG) as both the solvent and the reducing agent to reduce AgNO3 to Ag.48–51 However, organic capping molecules introduce an insulating layer around NWs, which can dramatically increase the contact resistance between NWs in electrode applications.52–54 In this work, the Ag NWs were synthesized without specifically introducing any organic stabilizers; it was simply done by reducing AgNO3 in EG containing trace amounts of NaCl and Fe(NO3)3 at 110 °C for 15 h, following the approach developed by Lim and coworkers.55 But compared to the previous work, we have scaled up the reaction by 200 times (from <0.02 to ∼3.3 g), while maintaining the good morphology of Ag NWs, through modifying the experimental parameters and increasing the amount of reactants (Fig. S2†), demonstrating the high potential of this synthesis method for large-scale production. Significantly larger quantities of Ag NWs were synthesized. The representative TEM image (Fig. 1b) reveals their morphology. The NWs had a diameter in the range of 30–65 nm and a length of several tens of micrometers, as shown in the insets of Fig. 1b and S3.† The diameter and aspect ratio of Ag NWs are two key structural traits, which can determine the Ag NW TCE performance.56 A small NW diameter can keep light scattering at the minimum, while a high aspect ratio of the NWs (up to 400 is normally required) can provide good optical and electrical properties.56,57 The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum of the Ag NWs-in-IPA dispersion is shown in Fig. S4,† in which two absorption peaks were observed at 390 nm and 353 nm. They were attributed to the transverse localized surface plasmon resonance mode of one-dimensional Ag nanostructures and to bulk Ag, respectively.55,57,58 The crystalline structure of Ag NWs was studied by XRD. The diffraction peaks shown in Fig. S5† match the face-centered-cubic (FCC) pattern of Ag (JCPDS Card no. 04-0783), with peaks at 2θ values of 38.1°, 44.3°, 64.4°, and 77.4° indexed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections of Ag, respectively.58–60

The automatic blade coating system is mainly composed of three parts: a vacuum chuck, an adjustable film applicator with a micrometer resolution and a traverse pusher, as shown in Fig. S1.† The blade coating method exhibits more advantages than manual rod coating or spin coating in terms of higher film uniformity and easier operation as well as more convenient process scale-up. However, this automatic technique has so far rarely been applied in the fabrication of large-area NW TCEs, highly likely due to the relatively rough surface of the NW film processed with this technique. Herein, we explored it and developed a two-step approach to obtain high-quality Ag NW TCEs. To be more specific, in the first step uniform Ag NW networks were deposited onto a glass substrate by automatically dragging the film applicator at a constant velocity and predefined film applicator-substrate gap distance, followed by scraping of a flexible and transparent polymer matrix in Step 2. As a result, Ag NW networks partially embedded in the polymer matrix were prepared and can be readily peeled off from the glass surface. After the peel-off operation, a free-standing, flexible Ag NW TCE was obtained with Ag NWs partially exposed on the peeled surface providing high conductivity.
The uniformity and coverage of nanowires in the film can be controlled by varying the concentration of the Ag NW ink, the solvent used in the ink, the speed of the traverse pusher and the height of the film applicator (i.e., the film thickness). Fig. 1c shows a top-view SEM image of the conductive surface of a Ag NW TCE, revealing a dense network of the NWs. Such a network provides numerous charge transporting channels, leading to low sheet resistance of the resulting Ag NW films. In addition, “unoccupied” space in the Ag NW network film and low diffusive reflection from Ag NWs result in high optical transmittance. A 55° titled-view SEM image (Fig. 1d) shows that NWs are indeed partially embedded into the transparent polymer and appear fully connected with each other. The polymer here serves as both a binder and a “supporting substrate”. The embedment reduces the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of the electrodes from ∼30.2 nm to ∼7.4 nm (Fig. S6†) and also contributes to the effective passivation of Ag NWs by largely decreasing the exposure area of Ag NWs to their environments. Fig. 1e shows the photograph of an ultra-flexible Ag NW TCE hand-bent at 180°. Fig. 1f shows the photograph of the as-prepared Ag NW TCE with a large size of 19 cm × 9 cm, which is quite homogeneous and transparent over the entire area. The TCE is very flexible and can be bent repeatedly at 180° several thousands of times without any degradation of conductivity (Fig. 1g).
The optical transmission of the Ag NW TCE can be tuned by varying the height of the film applicator (i.e., the film thickness) and the concentration of Ag NWs in the suspension. For instance, as the concentration of Ag NWs increased by about 1.8 times while maintaining the height of the film applicator constant at about 20 μm, the transmittance at 550 nm and the sheet resistance of Ag NW films gradually decreased from ∼90% to ∼78% and from ∼50 Ω sq−1 to ∼10 Ω sq−1, respectively (Fig. 2a). The values of commercially available ITO-PET TCEs are also included in Fig. 2a for comparison. It is clear that with optimal fabrication parameters, both the transmission and conductivity of our Ag NW TCEs are better than those of commercial ITO-PET TCEs. The transmission spectra of Ag NW TCEs are presented in Fig. 2b, which demonstrates a constantly high transmittance over a broad wavelength range from 350 to 2000 nm, much better than the commercial ITO-PET electrode that shows considerable drop in transmittance in the near-infrared region. It is notable that the sheet resistance of the Ag NW film on glass or PET was remarkably reduced after application of the polymer layer. The reduced value supports the improved contact between individual Ag NWs, bough together or forming a tighter interface by the polymer during its solidification, in line with the tremendous reduction in film thickness when the transparent polymer is dried.

To be used in devices, such as smart windows, the NW TCE must meet certain requirements to ensure device stability both during and after the fabrication process. Usually, the metal-NW-network film has weak adhesion to the substrate and can be easily wiped or peeled off from the electrode substrate, causing the breakdown of the TCEs.16,61 The mechanical tape test has been commonly used to assess film adhesion to the substrate. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Ag NW-PET TCE, without any polymer, exhibits a large resistance increase after performing only one cycle of the tape test. Many Ag NWs were removed by the tape, owing to the poor mechanical adhesion of plain Ag NWs to the plastic substrate. In clear contrast, the free-standing Ag NW TCE (containing the binder polymer) developed herein shows significantly improved, excellent structural integrity and robustness in the tape test for at least 100 cycles (the maximum cycles we investigated herein). Essentially, there was only a small sheet resistance increase after the first tape test and then there was no further change in the subsequent, repeated tape operations, suggesting a strong interfacial interaction between the NWs and polymer.
 Fig. 3  (a) Variation in the sheet resistance of a plain Ag NW film (i.e., without the support polymer) on PET and the flexible free-standing Ag NW TCE developed herein as a function of the number of peeling cycles by tape. The insets show the photographs of the Ag NW-PET TCE and Ag NW TCE after the tape test. (b) Changes in the sheet resistance of the Ag NW film on PET and the flexible Ag NW TCE exposed to air at room temperature for 2 months. (c) Variation in the sheet resistance of the ITO film on PET and the flexible Ag NW TCE as a function of the number of cycles of automatic, repeated bending to a bending radius of 5 mm. The inset shows the TCE (highlighted by a red oval) and the bending test machine. The arrows denote the moving directions of the test instrument. (d) Variation in the sheet resistance versus bending radius for the flexible Ag NW TCE and ITO-PET TCE. 
Long-term stability is a great challenge for metal NW-based TCEs; the ease of oxidation of NWs in air might hinder their practical applications. For our designed Ag NW TCE, the partial embedment of Ag NWs into the robust transparent polymer matrix on the electrode surface can largely retard their oxidation. As shown in Fig. 3b, the sheet resistance of the Ag NW TCE remained nearly constant, without any additional device encapsulation, after its exposure to air under ambient conditions for two months, while that of the Ag NW-PET TCE became about 4 times higher than its initial value. The results suggest that the transparent polymer successfully protected the Ag NWs from oxidation over long term and maintained the high electrical conductivity of the films. These results underline the key role of the transparent polymer in enhancing the stability of the Ag NW TCE.
The Ag NW TCE also possesses superior flexibility, which is essential for emerging optoelectronic devices, such as flexible SPDs and solar cells. As shown in Fig. 3c, the flexibility of the Ag NW TCE was evaluated by measuring the sheet resistance change after automatic, repeated dynamic bending tests. Impressively, the sheet resistance remained unchanged after 10000 bending cycles. But in clear contrast, the commercial ITO-PET TCE (PET thickness: 125 μm) began to show the sign of cracks within the first few cycles of bending, resulting in a sharp increase in its sheet resistance. Since ITO is an inorganic material, it is inherently brittle and easily cracks when exposed to even a small strain. As for the Ag NW TCE, the flexibility of both NWs and the polymer themselves as well as the strong interface between them together endow the composite electrode structure with mechanical flexibility under compression. We further studied the mechanical durability of the Ag NW TCE and ITO-PET TCE by measuring the alterations of their sheet resistance after bending tests with different bending radii from 10 mm to 1 mm (Fig. 3d). The flexible Ag NW TCE remained highly conductive with litter variation in the resistance up to a bending radius of 1 mm (the smallest radius we could apply); however, commercial ITO films easily degraded even with a bending radius of 10 mm. The bending radius of 4 mm caused a sharp increase of the sheet resistance by about 102 times for the ITO-PET TCE.
With all these great advantages, including facile large-scale manufacturing, high broadband transparency, super electrical conductivity, remarkable oxidation resistance, strong structural integrity, excellent flexibility, and outstanding mechanical durability, the Ag NW TCE is expected to be readily applicable to the fabrication of practical optoelectronic devices. Here, as a proof of concept, we incorporated the Ag NW TCE into flexible SPDs. SPDs are mainly used in smart windows and glasses for minimizing energy loss, as well as improving human comfort. In our devices, a polymer matrix and a great number of embedded droplets containing numerous polyiodide nanorods were used as the electrooptically active layer, which was sandwiched between two flexible Ag NW TCEs (Fig. 4a). Fig. S7a† shows the schematic diagram of the SPD structure, which contains thousands of spheroid droplets in the active layer. The AFM image of the active layer further confirms the shape of the droplets (Fig. S7b†). When there is no external voltage, the nanorods are randomly distributed in the droplets due to the Brownian movement. As a result, a significant number of photons are blocked, which is termed the “off” (dark) state, as shown in Fig. S8a.† With an external electric field “on”, the nanorods are polarized in the spherical droplets and rotate to align themselves, which increases the optical transmittance of the device, known as the “on” (transparent) state (Fig. S8b†). Fig. 4b shows the optical image of the as-prepared flexible SPD with a large area of about 9 × 9 cm2 in the dark (“off”) state. The transmittance of the dark state of our SPD can be tuned to as low as 0.1%, which is appropriate for smart widow applications. With the application of alternating current (AC) voltage, our dark-blue device quickly became colourless and made the background clearly visible, as shown in Fig. 4c. Now the device is “on”.

The optical modulation range is a key performance parameter for the SPD. Fig. 4d shows the UV-vis-NIR transmission spectra of the devices, built on different TCEs, in their “off” and “on” states. All the devices under current investigation were deep blue in their “off” states and their transmittance at 550 nm was used for comparison because 550 nm is the most sensitive wavelength for human eyes. A typical Ag NW TCE-based SPD showed a low optical transmittance of 0.3% at the wavelength of 550 nm in its “off” state (blue curve). Upon the application of an AC voltage of 110 V, the SPD became transparent with an optical transmittance of 52.4% at 550 nm. With the decrease of the thickness of the active layer, the optical modulation range of the Ag NW TCE-based device can be increased by 60.2% (from 7.6% in the dark state to 67.8% in the transparent state; red curve). For comparison, SPDs fabricated using commercially available ITO-PET TCEs under otherwise the same conditions were also examined (black curve). They presented a similar optical modulation of 58.6% at 550 nm. The results confirm that the electro-optic response in terms of the optical modulation range for Ag NW TCE-based SPDs is comparable to that built on commercially available ITO-PET electrodes.
Another significant concern for SPD operation is the speed of the switching response. The switching response time of the devices was examined in detail by using a LS183 spectrometer, which is capable of rapidly yielding the data of overall transmittance integrated over a wavelength range of 380–760 nm (Fig. 4e). The switching time is defined as the time required for a system to reach 90% of the transmittance change between the transparent and dark states, unless otherwise specified.62–64 Compared to our previous work,27 the reversible switching time between the transparent and dark states was reduced to about 21 seconds by optimizing the structure and size of polarizable polyiodide nanorods encapsulated inside droplets embedded in the polymer matrix (Fig. 4e). The integrated transmittance over the spectral range of 380–760 nm increased rapidly from 0.1% to 47.8%, within 5 s after the AC voltage of 110 V was turned on, and dropped to 0.2% within 25 s after the power was shut off. Moreover, our developed SPDs were very stable and the transmittance contrast of the devices remained unchanged for at least 250 switching cycles (the maximum number of cycles we applied in this work). The reversible switching-on and -off times, as defined above, were estimated to be as short as 5 s and 16 s, respectively. The remarkable coloration/de-coloration behavior of the devices, along with a large light modulation magnitude, offered superior light-manipulation performance within the visible wavelength range, confirming their feasibility for practical applications.
To investigate the mechanical flexibility of the device and thereby their diverse use on curved surfaces, the Ag NW TCE-based SPD was curved and even folded by 180° and tested. Fig. 5a shows a SPD attached to the curved surface of a beaker, i.e., a “smart beaker”, which was deep blue in color in the dark state. After the application of an AC voltage of 110 V, the device quickly and uniformly became transparent, making the marker pens placed inside the beaker clearly visible (Fig. 5b). The super flexibility of the representative device was further demonstrated after it was folded by 180° (Fig. 5c and d), and it still maintained all its functionality of a quick and large response to an electric signal. Fig. 5e shows the cycle performance of the SPD-on-beaker and there was almost no change in the on-and-off transmission for at least 200 cycles. What is more, the Ag NW TCE-based SPD sustained a transmittance modulation of about 85% of the initial performance even when subjected to folding by 180° (Fig. 5e). The possible reason for the slight decrease of the transmittance modulation magnitude is the degradation of the electro-optically active layer after the 180° folding. Fig. 5f shows the comparison of the cycling behavior of the devices under different test conditions or fabricated with different TCEs. The device based on the ITO-PET TCE basically maintained its functionality after 200 cycles on the surface of the beaker with only 5% contrast degradation, while completely lost its function after 50 cycles under 180° folding conditions. Based on AFM images (Fig. 6a and b), the major reason for this failure was the formation of micrometer sized cracks in the ITO-PET TCE after the 180° folding (many cracks were observed in the sample; here, we just show one crack), which could result in a much higher sheet resistance. In strong contrast, no cracks were observed under AFM in the Ag NW TCE (Fig. 6c and d), which is consistent with the super high flexibility of the Ag NW TCE-based SPD. These results suggest that these new Ag NW TCEs can be potentially applied in various fields with highly demanding requirements especially in flexibility and wearability. In addition to Ag NWs, Ag nanofibers and yarn are also promising candidates for flexible TCEs, which have not been used in SPDs. In particular, Ag nanofiber or yarn electrodes exhibit excellent flexibility and stretchability as well as high optical and electrical properties due to the combination of ultralong nanofibers and fused junctions.65,66 Electrostatic spinning and blow spinning methods are highly effective techniques to prepare Ag nanofibers or yarn, although they are not available in every lab.66 It is also highly interesting to explore Ag nanofiber or yarn electrodes in smart window applications.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we present a facile and low-cost method to prepare large-area, ultra-flexible, stable, free-standing Ag NW based high performance TCEs. The success relies on the intelligent use of a flexible polymer and automatic blade coating. The electrodes showed a high transparency with superior electrical conductivity, excellent stability against oxidation, remarkable flexibility and robust structural integrity. Their high potential in flexible optoelectronics was well demonstrated in SPDs, which showed a large optical modulation >60% and a fast switching response ∼20 s. Compared with ITO-PET TCE-based SPDs, our Ag NW TCE-based devices showed significantly better flexibility and could maintain their functionalities after being folded up to 180° 200 times (the maximum cycle number under the current investigation), without forming any micro-cracks as occurred in the commercial ITO-PET TCE. Regarding the continuous operation on curved surfaces, we used a beaker as an example, demonstrating high contrast in the on-and-off states. Such high performance, flexible SPDs hold great promise in smart window/glass applications, which will have a profound impact on our daily life in the future. The simple route for fabricating large area Ag NW TCEs is also expected to pave the way for manufacturing next-generation flexible optoelectronic devices.
