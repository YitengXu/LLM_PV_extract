    , Accepted 28th January 2023First published on 30th January 2023AbstractThiophene and oligothiophenes have outstanding electronic properties, especially their electron-rich nature, which endows them with good interfacial contacts with perovskite layers, and hence makes them ideal building blocks for hole-transport materials (HTMs). In the current work, we successfully synthesized two novel HTMs with terthienyl (TTP) as the core structure and triphenylamine or 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine as the end-capping groups, and termed them THP-1 and THP-2, respectively. Compared with THP-2, THP-1 exhibited a more suitable energy level and appropriate three-dimensional molecular structure, leading to better optoelectronic properties for THP-1. After optimization, PSCs based on THP-1 as the HTM achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of as high as 20.47%, much higher than that of THP-2 (17.16%), and comparable to that of the control device based on spiro-OMeTAD (20.28%). Furthermore, the THP-1-based device maintained 71.5% of its initial efficiency, while the THP-2-based device and control device maintained only, respectively, 22.3% and 43.3% of their initial efficiency values, after 840 h aging tests at room temperature and under 30–45% relative humidity conditions, indicative of the excellent stability of the THP-1-based device.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered one of the most promising types of new-generation solar cells due to their low preparation costs and remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) levels.1–5 To date, a superior record PCE of 25.7% has been reached for PSCs, narrowing its PCE gap with crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells.6 Typically, excellent hole-transport materials (HTMs) with matched energy levels, high hole mobility, and high conductivity are indispensable to high-performance PSC devices.7–9 Thus far, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been the state-of-art HTM for high-efficiency PSCs.10–15 However, its complicated synthesis and purification has made its devices quite costly.16–24 Therefore, many researchers have expended great efforts to develop a low-cost HTM to replace spiro-OMeTAD.25–31
Oligothiophenes, as a part of the building blocks in HTMs, present an electron-rich nature due to containing S atoms, further facilitating the improvement of the intramolecular interactions and charge dissociation as well as the conductivity of HTM material.32–35 Based on these benefits, we designed and synthesized two HTMs, adopting the terthienyl (TTP) unit as the core building block and triphenylamine or 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine as the end-capping groups, and termed them THP-1 and THP-2, respectively (see Fig. 1). Compared with THP-2, THP-1 was found to display a more suitable energy level, higher hole mobility and remarkable film-forming properties. Finally, the PSCs based on THP-1 as the HTM showed a PCE of as high as 20.47%, much higher than the PCE of the PSC based on THP-2 (17.16%) and comparable with that of the control device based on spiro-OMeTAD (20.28%). Furthermore, the HTM THP-1-based device exhibited good stability, retaining about 71.5% of its initial PCE after an 840 h aging test under ambient conditions.

2. Results and discussion
THP-1 and THP-2 were easily synthesized in only three steps, namely Suzuki cross-coupling, free-radical substitution and Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reactions, which afforded a much simpler synthetic route compared with that to spiro-OMeTAD. Meanwhile, the costs of synthesizing THP-1 and THP-2 were calculated to be 66.85 $ g−1 and 33.77 $ g−1, respectively, much lower than that for spiro-OMeTAD (175 $ g−1). The detailed synthetic pathways, characterization analysis and cost evaluation for THP-1 and THP-2 are described in the ESI.† Furthermore, we took melting point measurements, and the melting points of THP-1 and THP-2 were measured to be 125 °C and 115 °C, respectively.
To gain insight into the relationship between the molecular structure and material properties, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations for THP-1 and THP-2. As shown in Fig. 1, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of THP-1 and THP-2 were in each case delocalized throughout the entire molecular backbone, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were in each case more concentrated at the central TTP unit. An obvious partial overlap between the HOMO and LUMO was observed, a feature beneficial for hole extraction and hopping. According to the DFT calculations, the HOMO energy levels for THP-1 and THP-2 were determined to be −4.39 eV and −4.24 eV, respectively, suggesting a significant effect of the extending of the π conjugation on the HOMO energy levels, namely effecting a lowering of the energy levels.
In order to characterize the optical and electrochemical properties of the THP-1 and THP-2 HTMs, UV-Vis absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry (CV) plots were acquired (see Fig. 2a and b), and the relevant data are presented in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, THP-1 and THP-2 showed similar absorption bands with maximum absorption peak (λmax) values of 443 nm and 419 nm, respectively. Compared with THP-2, THP-1 exhibited a slight red shift, which can be attributed to the flatter conformation of THP-1. The optical band gap (Eg) of the THP-1 and THP-2 HTMs were calculated, using the formula Eg = 1240/λonset, as 2.32 eV and 2.46 eV, respectively. Combined with the CV results shown in Fig. 2b, the LUMO energy levels of THP-1 and THP-2 were estimated to be −3.07 eV and −2.59 eV, respectively, which are both more positive than the level of the conduction band of the perovskite (−4.05 eV), indicating effective electron blocking and charge recombination suppression. Moreover, THP-1 exhibited a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.39 eV than did THP-2 (−5.05 eV), which can be attributed to the weaker electron-donation ability of the triphenylamine group. The deeper HOMO energy level of THP-1 not only supplied enough driving force for the hole extraction and transport, but also reduced the energy loss in the device (see Fig. 2c). Therefore, a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) of THP-1 was expected.

To investigate the hole transport properties of THP-1 and THP-2, we recorded their hole mobilities by using the current space charge limit (SCLC) method with the FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au structure. As shown in Fig. 2d, compared with the hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD (1.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), THP-1 and THP-2 showed higher, values, specifically calculated to be 6.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher hole mobility of THP-1 than that of THP-2 was attributed to the flatter molecular conformation of THP-1 facilitating intramolecular π–π stacking and hole hopping. The conductivity levels of the HTMs were also evaluated by using a two-contact conductivity setup method (see Fig. 2e). The details of the hole mobility and conductivity calculations for the HTMs are presented in ESI.† THP-1 presented a conductivity of 1.31 × 10−4 S cm−2, higher than that of THP-2 (9.64 × 10−5 S cm−2), indicating that a higher fill factor (FF) would be obtained for THP-1 when assessing photovoltaic performance.
To investigate the film-forming properties of the new HTMs, top-view morphologies of spiro-OMeTAD, THP-1 and THP-2 films spin-coated on top of respective perovskite layers were visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 3a–c. The THP-1 and spiro-OMeTAD films were observed to be relatively uniform, while THP-2 exhibited many pinholes at the film surface. Differences between the molecular structures of the two new HTMs apparently resulted in differences between their film-forming properties. Compared with the diphenylamine-based end group of THP-2, the triphenylamine-based units of THP-1 apparently made the molecule more planar, which in turn appeared to have improved its film forming. The better film quality of THP-1 was also confirmed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 3d–f, the THP-1 film exhibited a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 4.9 nm, much lower than that of the THP-2 film (11.7 nm), and comparable to that of the spiro-OMeTAD film (3.5 nm). The compact and uniform morphology of the THP-1 film was expected to be beneficial for the photovoltaic performance and stability of its PSC device.

To further evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the THP-1 and THP-2 HTMs, we fabricated PSC devices based on THP-1 and THP-2 each with an FTO/c-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM/Au device structure, with the spiro-OMeTAD-based device chosen as the reference. Data for the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves (Fig. 4a and Fig. S7, ESI†) of the devices based on, respectively, THP-1, THP-2 and spiro-OMeTAD were collected under a simulated solar illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), and the relevant photovoltaic characteristic data are presented in Table 2. As expected, the PSC device based on THP-1 produced an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.47% with a VOC of 1.13 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.90 mA cm−2, and FF of 75.8%, with this PCE much higher than that of THP-2 (17.16%) and comparable with that of the reference device (20.28%). The hysteresis index (HI) of the PSC devices based on THP-1, THP-2 and spiro-OMeTAD were calculated to be 0.019, 0.044 and 0.035, respectively, i.e., negligible HI values and hence indicating no obvious hysteresis for any of the devices. From the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra shown in Fig. 4b, the THP-1- and THP-2-based devices each showed a wide region of light response, between wavelengths of 300 nm and 800 nm. However, the THP-1-based device exhibited much higher IPCE values than did the THP-2 device, further resulting in the higher JSC of THP-1. Moreover, the integrated JSC values of the THP-1-, THP-2- and spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs were estimated to be, respectively, 23.18, 21.42, and 23.69 mA cm−2, values in good agreement with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. The higher IPCE and JSC values of the THP-1 based device mainly resulted from the efficient charge transport and suppression of charge recombination, characteristics evidenced by the measurements of the dependence of JSC and that of VOC each on light intensity as shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The α value of the THP-1-based device was determined to be 1.00, in contrast to the non-unity values of the THP-2-based (α = 0.96) and control devices (α = 0.92), implying more efficient hole extraction and transport for THP-1. Furthermore, THP-1 showed a much weaker dependence on light intensity, with a slope of 1.81KT/q, than did the THP-2-based (2.34KT/q) and spiro-OMeTAD-based (2.03KT/q) devices, suggesting more effective suppression of charge recombination for THP-1. In addition, the THP-1-based device showed a good reproducibility with an average PCE of 19.39%, in contrast to the 15.43% and 19.23% values for the THP-2- and spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, respectively (see Fig. S8, ESI†).

To better evaluate the application prospects of the new HTMs, long-term stability levels of unencapsulated devices based on THP-1, THP-2 and spiro-OMeTAD were further evaluated under 30–45% relative humidity (RH) at room temperature (see Fig. 5a). After an aging test for 840 hours, the THP-1-based device maintained 71.5% of its initial PCE, i.e., showing excellent stability, while the THP-2- and spiro-OMeTAD-based devices maintained only, respectively, 22.3% and 43.3% of their initial PCE values. Meanwhile, the THP-1 film displayed a water contact angle of 102°, greater than those displayed by the THP-2-based (100°) and spiro-OMeTAD-based (89°) films, and also much greater than that displayed by pure perovskite (55°), as shown in Fig. 5b and Fig. S9 (ESI†). Moreover, the steady-state power output (SPO) for the best devices based on THP-1, THP-2 and spiro-OMeTAD measured at the maximum power point (MPP) were 19.34%, 15.82% and 19.06%, respectively (see Fig. 5c), quite consistent with the J–V measurement results. Furthermore, we examined the stability of the device films based on THP-1, THP-2 and spiro-OMeTAD under conditions of high humidity (RH > 90%); see Fig. 5d. After aging for 48 h, the THP-2 film had faded, while the THP-1 and spiro-OMeTAD films barely changed, except for their edges, results consistent with stability measurement results. Therefore, the excellent stability of the THP-1-based device was concluded to mainly originate from its hydrophobicity and good film-forming properties, which apparently impeded the penetration of moisture into the perovskite and slowed down the degradation of the device.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized two low-cost TTP-core-based HTMs—termed THP-1 and THP-2, respectively—using easy synthesis and purification processes. Compared with THP-2, THP-1 showed a more appropriate three-dimensional structure, more suitable energy levels and superior optoelectronic properties. Finally, the PSC device based on THP-1 achieved an impressive PCE of 20.47%, comparable to that of the spiro-OMeTAD-based device (20.28%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated THP-1-based device exhibited good long-term stability, retaining 71.5% of its initial efficiency after being aged for 840 h, while the THP-2- and spiro-OMeTAD-based devices maintained only, respectively, 22.3% and 43.3% of their initial efficiency levels. The success of this work has provided new options of low-cost promising HTMs with TTP core building blocks for high-performance PSCs.
