    , Accepted 29th November 2017First published on 1st December 2017AbstractThe majority of organic semiconductors have a low relative dielectric constant (εr < 6), which is an important limitation for organic solar cells (OSCs). A high dielectric constant would reduce the exciton binding energy, reduce charge carrier recombination losses, and thereby enhance the overall device performance of OSCs. However, the development of organic/polymeric semiconductors with higher relative dielectric constants (εr > 6) has attracted a very limited attention. Moreover, high performance OSCs based on high dielectric constant photovoltaic materials are still in their infancy. Herein, we report an oligoethylene oxide side chain-containing non-fullerene acceptor (ITIC-OE) with a high relative dielectric constant of εr ≈ 9.4, which is two times larger than that of its alkyl chain-containing counterpart ITIC. Encouragingly, the OSCs based on ITIC-OE show a high power conversion efficiency of 8.5%, which is the highest value for OSCs that employ high dielectric constant materials. Nevertheless, this value is lower than those of ITIC-based control devices. The less phase-separated morphology in blend films due to the reduced crystallinity of ITIC-OE and the too good miscibility between PBDB-T and ITIC-OE are responsible for the lower device performance. This work suggests additional prerequisites to make high dielectric constants play a significant role in OSCs.
1. Introduction
As a promising solution-processable photovoltaic technology, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) concept have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to their unique advantages such as light weight, large area, and low-cost production.1–5 A significant limitation for the further performance improvement of OSCs is the low relative dielectric constant (εr < 6) of organic semiconductors. Such a low relative dielectric constant causes high exciton binding energy (several hundreds of meVs) and charge carrier recombination.6–11 Conversely, inorganic semiconductors and organohalide lead perovskites all have a high relative dielectric constant (εr > 10), which results in an exciton binding energy as low as 10 meV and negligible recombination.12 Therefore, organic semiconductors with a high dielectric constant are intriguing for further improving the device performance of OSCs. Theoretically, increasing the dielectric constant of organic semiconductors could reduce geminate and non-geminate recombination, mitigate space charge effects, lower the voltage loss, reduce the exciton binding energy, etc.7–11
So far, only a very few attempts at enhancing the dielectric constant of organic semiconductors have been reported. For example, Jen's group and Liu's group developed high dielectric constant conjugated polymers and fullerenes by introducing cyano-functionalized side chains, respectively, which show a dielectric constant of about 5.0.13,14 Hummelen and Koster et al. demonstrated that an oligoethylene oxide (OE) side chain is useful to enhance the dielectric constant of organic semiconductors (both polymer donors and fullerene acceptors) without sacrificing the charge carrier mobility and solubility.15,16 Afterwards, the use of OE side chains to improve the dielectric constant of organic semiconductors was further reported.17–19 Nevertheless, the high dielectric constants are still yet to be transformed to high performance OSCs. So far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs that employ high dielectric constant materials have been generally lower than 6%.13–19 Moreover, there is no report that reveals the reasons for these non-ideal device performances of high dielectric constant materials. In this context, it is very meaningful to develop novel high dielectric constant materials and to disclose the potential obstacles before converting high dielectric constants to high performance OSCs in practice.
In recent years, non-fullerene acceptors have attracted considerable attention because of their superior properties such as intense light absorption, adjustable energy levels, and ease of synthesis.20–25 The PCEs of OSCs with non-fullerene acceptors have increased from about 1% to over 10% owing to combined efforts including the development of new acceptors and matched polymer donors and device engineering.26–35 One of the most successful acceptors is ITIC (shown in Fig. 1), with which a PCE over 10% has been realized by many groups.31–34 The modification of ITIC mainly focused on fine-tuning the electronic structures and molecular packing in solid states, such as changing the position of solubilizing alkyl chains to enhance the light absorption coefficient, crystallinity, and electron mobility,36 introducing a peripheral substituent such as electron-donating methyl or electron-withdrawing fluorine atom onto the terminal acceptor groups to modulate the energy levels and charge transport properties.35,37 It is thus interesting to synthesize novel ITIC derivatives with a high dielectric constant for use as electron acceptors in OSCs.

Herein, we report an ITIC derivative (ITIC-OE) with OE side chains (Fig. 1), which shows similar optical properties and energy levels but a much higher dielectric constant as compared to ITIC. In the frequency range from 1 × 103 to 1 × 106 Hz, ITIC-OE shows a relative dielectric constant of about 9, which is two times larger than that of ITIC. This new acceptor offered a PCE of 8.5% when blended with a commercial polymer donor (PBDB-T, Fig. 1), which is the best result achieved for organic semiconductors with high dielectric constants. Nevertheless, this value is lower than those of ITIC-based control devices. The less phase-separated morphology of the blend films due to the reduced crystallinity of ITIC-OE and the too good miscibility between PBDB-T and ITIC-OE are responsible for the lower device performance. This work suggests additional prerequisites to make high dielectric constants play a significant role in OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Design and synthesis
The synthetic route (Fig. S1, ESI†) and detailed procedures for the preparation of ITIC-OE are described in the ESI.† The molecular structure of ITIC-OE is very similar to that of ITIC. The only difference between the structures of ITIC-OE and ITIC is that the second and the fifth carbon atoms of the alkyl side chains on the latter are replaced by oxygen atoms. This small change can lead to a significantly enhanced dielectric constant, while keeping the optical absorption and energy levels unchanged in ITIC-OE. Similar to ITIC, ITIC-OE is also very soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene, making it suitable for solution-processing.
2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical absorption spectra of ITIC-OE and ITIC in chloroform solutions and in films are compared in Fig. 2a and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. The absorption curves of ITIC-OE and ITIC show similar absorption profiles, while the wavelength of their absorption maxima (λmax) differs slightly. ITIC-OE shows a λmax at 671 nm in solution and at 718 nm in the film, leading to an 8 nm blue-shift and a 16 nm red-shift as compared to ITIC, respectively. Thus, ITIC-OE exhibits a red-shift of up to 47 nm from its solution to solid state, while the corresponding red-shift for ITIC is 23 nm. Correspondingly, the absorption onset of ITIC-OE is also slightly red-shifted with respect to ITIC, resulting in an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.57 eV for ITIC-OE and 1.58 eV for ITIC, respectively. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the absorption coefficients of the ITIC-OE film (9.93 × 104 cm−1) and the ITIC film (1.05 × 105 cm−1) are comparable, indicating that the OE side chain of ITIC-OE has little influence on the absorption coefficients of the materials.38

The electrochemical properties of the two acceptors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves are shown in Fig. 2b. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated with reference to the ferrocene internal standard (Table 1). The onsets of the oxidation potential and reduction potential are identical for ITIC-OE and ITIC. Correspondingly, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the two acceptors are almost the same (Table 1), indicating that the OE side chain of ITIC-OE has no influence on the energy levels of the materials.38
2.3. Dielectric constant
The dielectric constants of the materials with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/test film (100 nm)/Ca/Al were determined by capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements. The measurements were performed in the frequency range from 1 × 103 to 1 × 106 Hz. The relative dielectric constants (εr) were calculated from the equation of εr = Cd/ε0A, where C is the capacitance, d is the thickness of the tested film, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, and A is the device area (0.0516 cm2). Fig. 3 shows the relative dielectric constants of ITIC-OE, ITIC, and PBDB-T as a function of frequency. ITIC and PBDB-T show an εr of about 4.5 and 2.8 in the testing frequency range, respectively, which is in accordance with the common organic semiconductors.39,40 In contrast, ITIC-OE shows a doubling of εr (7.5–9.5) with respect to its reference molecule ITIC. The high relative dielectric constant of ITIC-OE originates from the better swiftness and flexibility of the OE side chains that can provide easier reorientations for dipole moments.15

The enhanced dielectric constant is attractive for improving the performance of OSCs in a few aspects. The Coulomb attraction within the charge-transfer exciton is decided by Eb = q2/(4πε0εrr0), where q is the elementary charge and r0 is the electron and hole separation distance. Clearly, the enhanced relative dielectric constant would facilitate more efficient charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface, favoring a higher Jsc and FF.7,10,13 Besides, it is reported that the higher dielectric constant could reduce the charge carrier recombination, also favoring a higher Jsc and FF.7,13 Additionally, Koster et al. suggested that an enhanced dielectric constant would reduce the singlet–triplet energy gap, thereby blocking the recombination pathways to the lowest energy triplet state from the charge separated state.7
2.4. Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the benefits that the high relative dielectric constant can contribute to, single component homojunction devices based on ITIC-OE and ITIC pure films were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ITIC-OE or ITIC/Ca/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The device parameters are listed in Table 2. As expected, the photocurrent of the ITIC-only device is negligible, which is further confirmed by the undetectable EQE response. In contrast, the homojunction device based on the ITIC-OE film shows a significantly increased photocurrent. The EQE maximum of this device approaches 4%, which ruled out the possibility of the leakage of the device. Moreover, the high resemblance between the EQE profile and the optical absorption spectrum unambiguously evidenced the charge generation in the pristine ITIC-OE film upon light illumination. These results clearly demonstrate the significance of a high dielectric constant. Notably, the performance of the ITIC-OE homojunction device is limited by the low Jsc and FF. Considering that ITIC-OE is a predominantly electron-transporting material, it is reasonable to speculate that ambipolar materials with high εr can achieve higher device performance.

Bulk heterojunction OSCs based on ITIC-OE were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:ITIC-OE/PFN-Br/Ag.41,42 Meanwhile, ITIC-based control devices were also fabricated for comparison following the optimized fabricating conditions reported in the literature.31,43 The J–V curves and EQE spectra of the best devices for each acceptor are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The champion results, average values, and standard deviations of device statistics from 10 devices based on ITIC-OE and ITIC are listed in Table 2. The device results of the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE devices under different fabricating conditions are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The ITIC-OE-based device shows the best PCE of 8.5% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 14.8 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.67. This PCE value is the highest result for OSCs based on materials with a relative dielectric constant over 5.0 (Table S3 in the ESI†). The maximum EQE value of the ITIC-OE-based device reaches 70% at around 700 nm, which evidenced the efficient charge generation and extraction in the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE solar cells. Nevertheless, ITIC-OE performs less efficiently than ITIC. Each photovoltaic parameter (Voc, Jsc, and FF) of the ITIC-OE-based device is slightly lower than that of the ITIC-based device, which thereby causes a noteworthy lower PCE. As presented in Table 2, the ITIC-based control device shows a PCE of 10.4% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 16.5 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.71. The slight decrease of Voc for the ITIC-OE-based device may be caused by the lower energy of the charge transfer state (ECT), which is consistent with the report that a higher dielectric constant could reduce ECT.44 The EQE of the ITIC-based device is higher than that of the ITIC-OE-based device over almost the whole wavelength range with a maximum EQE value of about 77% at 700 nm. We recognize that the slightly lower absorption coefficient of the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE film (Fig. S5b in the ESI†) should account for the lower EQE. In a word, the high dielectric constant of ITIC-OE did not provide better-performing OSCs in practice. Therefore, understanding the origin of the lower performance of ITIC-OE-based devices is crucial to further develop new high dielectric constant organic semiconductors for application in OSCs.
2.5. Charge generation, transport, and recombination
The photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiencies in the two blend films were thus studied firstly. The pure films of PBDB-T, ITIC-OE, and ITIC and the two corresponding blend films were excited at 500 nm to study the electron transfer from excited PBDB-T to the acceptor and at 710 nm to study the hole transfer from the excited acceptor to PBDB-T, respectively. As shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†), the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE shows a lower PL quenching efficiency (74%) than PBDB-T:ITIC (90%), suggesting that the electron transfer from the excited polymer donor to the acceptor for ITIC-OE is less efficient than that for ITIC in blend films. When excited at 710 nm, the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE shows a lower PL quenching efficiency (89%) than PBDB-T:ITIC (95%) (Fig. S6b in the ESI†), suggesting that the hole transfer from the excited acceptor to the polymer donor for ITIC-OE is less efficient than that for ITIC in blend films. The less efficient electron and hole transfer efficiencies in the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE blend film should account for the lower EQE and Jsc in OSCs.
We then studied the exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) of the solar cells.45Fig. 5a shows the photocurrent density (Jph, Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the light and dark current densities, respectively) versus the effective voltage (Veff, Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the voltage when Jph is equal to 0, and Va is the applied bias voltage) of the OSCs. The P(E,T) is defined by normalizing Jph with the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat). Under short-circuit conditions, the P(E,T) values of the OSCs are 89.4% and 94.5% for ITIC-OE and ITIC, respectively. The lower P(E,T) value of ITIC-OE signifies that ITIC-OE results in slightly lower exciton dissociation in OSCs under short-circuit conditions. This result is consistent with the lower Jsc and EQE of the ITIC-OE-based solar cells.
 Fig. 5  (a) Photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves of the OSCs; (b) light intensity dependence of Jsc of the OSCs; (c) light intensity dependence of Voc of the OSCs. 
The device performance, especially Jsc and FF, can be also affected by charge transport. The mobility of pure acceptors and their blends with PBDB-T was thus measured from single carrier devices by fitting the J–V data to a space-charge-limited current model. The results are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). In pure films, ITIC-OE and ITIC exhibit electron mobilities (μe) of 4.8 × 10−4 and 6.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, signifying the comparable pristine charge transport properties of the two acceptors. In BHJ blends, however, the electron mobility of the ITIC-OE-based film (1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) is one order of magnitude lower than that of the ITIC-based film (3.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Meanwhile, the hole mobilities (μh) of the two blend films are very similar (3.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDB-T:ITIC-OE versus 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDB-T:ITIC). Correspondingly, the μh/μe ratios for ITIC-OE- and ITIC-based blend films are 28.9 and 1.0, respectively. The lower μe and imbalanced hole/electron transport of the ITIC-OE-based blend film likely contribute to the lower FF and Jsc. Considering that ITIC-OE and ITIC show similar pristine electron mobility in the pure film, we speculate that PBDB-T:ITIC-OE forms a less optimal BHJ morphology than PBDB-T:ITIC. The more in-depth investigation on the BHJ morphology and molecular packing will give further explanation in the following parts.
The light intensity dependence of the Jsc and Voc was investigated to evaluate the charge recombination of the OSC devices. The correlation of the Jsc and the light intensity (Plight) obeys the power-law Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is an exponential factor that should be equal to 1 when the bimolecular recombination of the device is negligible.46 As shown in Fig. 5b, the α values of the fitted line for PBDB-T:ITIC-OE and PBDB-T:ITIC devices are 0.982 and 0.996, respectively, indicating that the ITIC-OE-based device shows a slightly higher bimolecular recombination loss than the ITIC-based device. The slope of the Vocversus ln(Plight) curve reflects the property of charge recombination under open circuit conditions. Monomolecular recombination or trap-assisted recombination is dominant when the slope is equal to 2.0kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature, while the slope value would be 1.0kT/q when only bimolecular recombination takes place.47 As shown in Fig. 5c, the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE and PBDB-T:ITIC devices exhibit a slope of 1.79kT/q and 1.34kT/q, respectively. The higher slope of the ITIC-OE-based device indicates that more monomolecular and/or trap-assisted recombination is involved, which may be due to the suboptimal morphology in the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE blend film.
2.6. Morphology and miscibility
The crystalline order of the polymer donor PBDB-T and the two acceptors in both pure films and in PBDB-T:acceptor blends was investigated by grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).48 As shown in Fig. 6a, the two-dimensional GIWAXS pattern of pure PBDB-T and ITIC films exhibits strong lamellar stacking peaks in the in-plane direction and π–π stacking peaks in the out-of-plane direction. However, the ITIC-OE pure film presents no obvious lamellar stacking peak and a much weaker π–π stacking peak, indicative of less crystallization. The corresponding coherence length (CCL) was calculated by using the full width at half maximum (FWHM). The (100) peak of both blends is attributed to the donor PBDB-T. The value of the CCL of the (010) peak is 2.81 nm for the ITIC pure film compared to CCL = 1.68 nm for the ITIC-OE film. Similarly, the CCL value of the (010) peak of the PBDB-T:ITIC blend is also larger than that of PBDB-T:ITIC-OE (CCL = 2.32 nm versus 1.80 nm). In summary, the smaller CCL of ITIC-OE implies that ITIC-OE is less crystalline not only in the pure film but also in the blend, which may explain the lower Jsc and FF of the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE system for the weaker charge separation and transport.

The morphology of the active layers was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AFM images and TEM images of the blend films are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†) and 7, respectively. No noteworthy difference can be found in the AFM images, but the TEM images of the two blend films differ significantly. At a higher magnification (Fig. 7c and d), clear lattice fringes corresponding to PBDB-T are observable in the TEM images of both ITIC-OE- and ITIC-based blend films. This is consistent with the crystallinity observed in GIWAXS. Comparing the morphologies of the blend films reveals that ITIC-OE leads to a much more uniform film than ITIC (Fig. 7a and b), suggesting a lack of appropriate phase separation in the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE film. The less phase-separated BHJ morphology in the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE film could be a reason for the enhanced charge recombination and imbalanced hole/electron transport, which consequently resulted in lower device performance of solar cells.
 Fig. 7  TEM images of the blend films based on ITIC-OE (a and c) and ITIC (b and d), respectively. The scale bar is 0.2 μm for (a) and (b), and 50 nm for (c) and (d). 
Since the structural difference between ITIC-OE and ITIC is only the oxygen atoms in the side chains of the former, we thus speculate that the different morphology of these two kinds of blend films is also caused by the different miscibility of the polymer donor with different non-fullerene acceptors.49 Therefore, contact angle measurements were performed to estimate the surface energies of the corresponding films. The relevant images are shown in Fig. 8 and the parameters are summarized in Table 3.50 The water and oil contact angles are 67.7 and 36.3° for the pure ITIC-OE film, and 90.2 and 21.9° for the pure ITIC film, respectively. Clearly, the OE side chains endow the ITIC-OE film with improved hydrophilic properties but reduced hydrophobic properties as compared to the ITIC film. As a result, the surface energy of ITIC-OE (45.81 mN m−1) is slightly reduced with respect to ITIC (47.37 mN m−1). Interestingly, the surface energy of the pure ITIC-OE film is closer to that of PBDB-T (42.59 mN m−1) as compared to ITIC mainly because of the identical oil contact angles of ITIC-OE and PBDB-T. The closer surface energies of the two components indicate that the PBDB-T:ITIC-OE blend has better miscibility than the PBDB-T:ITIC blend. The better miscibility further leads to more intimately mixed blends with less phase separation, as evidenced by the TEM images. The results indicate that modulating the miscibility of the two components in the active layer to form a proper BHJ morphology is a prerequisite to make high dielectric constant materials useful in OSCs in practice. Reducing the surface energy of the polymer donor to generate a proper difference in surface energy between the polymer donor and ITIC-OE would be a feasible solution to adjust the BHJ morphology. In specific, introducing fluorine atoms onto the backbone of PBDB-T or incorporating OE side chains could be helpful.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed a non-fullerene acceptor (ITIC-OE) with a high relative dielectric constant of up to 9.5 by introducing an oligoethylene oxide side chain for application in bulk-heterojunction OSCs. A high PCE of 8.5% was achieved, which is the highest value for bulk-heterojunction OSCs that employ high dielectric constant materials. The characterization of the intrinsic physical and optoelectronic properties suggests that ITIC-OE is promising for making highly efficient OSCs. In practice, the ITIC-OE-based devices show a slightly lower device performance than the reference ITIC devices, which is a collective result of imbalanced hole/electron transport, enhanced recombination losses, and a less optimal BHJ morphology. The essential reason is the reduced crystallinity of ITIC-OE and too good miscibility between ITIC-OE and the polymer donor PBDB-T, which in turn results in blend films lacking proper micro-phase separation. Further research involving high dielectric constant organic semiconductors should therefore focus on improving the dielectric constant and modulating the morphology simultaneously, which could be realized by rational molecular design.
