    , Accepted 1st March 2023First published on 21st March 2023AbstractLigand-free methods for the synthesis of halide perovskite nanocrystals are of great interest because of their excellent performance in optoelectronics and photonics. In addition, template-assisted synthesis methods have become a powerful tool for the fabrication of environmentally stable and bright nanocrystals. Here we develop a novel approach for the facile ligand-free template-assisted fabrication of perovskite nanocrystals with a near-unity absolute quantum yield, which involves CaCO3 vaterite micro- and submicrospheres as templates. We show that the optical properties of the obtained nanocrystals are affected not mainly by the template morphology, but strongly depend on the concentration of precursor solutions, anion and cation ratio, as well as on adding defect-passivating rare-earth dopants. The optimized samples are further tested as infrared radiation visualizers exhibiting promising characteristics comparable to those that are commercially available.
Introduction
Halide perovskites are a class of semiconductors, which have recently attracted a lot of attention due to their excellent photophysical and optoelectronic properties.1,2 These materials are successfully used in optoelectronics,3 nanophotonics4 and photovoltaics,5 in particular, for the development of light-emitting diodes,6 lasers,7 scintillators,8 solar cells,9 and photodetectors.10 The most commonly used laboratory methods of perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) synthesis are hot-injection11–13 and ligand-assisted reprecipitation.14 These methods heavily rely on the use of various ligands to control the shape and size of PNCs.15 Most of the approaches to PNC synthesis utilize various organic ligands, such as oleylamine, oleic acid or trioctylphosphine.16 The use of ligands helps to obtain monodisperse particles, control PNC growth, and passivate the defects, which results in a higher brightness and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Furthermore, various organic ligands such as zwitterionic ligands or organic acids were shown to significantly enhance the stability of PNCs.17–21 However, these organic components lead to the worse performance of PNCs, when it comes to the manufacturing of various optoelectronic devices, where charge carrier transport through the ligands is limited.
Therefore, ligand-free methods of PNC synthesis are of great interest, and include the solvothermal reaction,22 post-treatment,23–27 ultrasonication,28 microwave-assisted synthesis,29–31 chemical vapor deposition, microfluidic approach,32 mechanochemical method and others.33 However, these methods are either time-consuming,34 sensitive to atmospheric conditions,35 or demanding expensive equipment.36 Among these approaches, it is necessary to highlight a promising PNC synthesis technique that has attracted a lot of attention – the template-assisted method.37–40 According to this method, the size of the nanocrystals is sterically limited by their growth within the templates without the use of any ligands. For instance, mesoporous silica39 was studied as a template for bismuth-halide double-perovskite nanocrystal growth with the composition Cs2AgBiBr6, where three kinds of templates with different intrinsic forms were used (cubes, rods, and wires), which results in different geometries of nanocrystals leading to changes in the band gap energy. In the other work, a template approach was realized with a polydimethylsiloxane template to fabricate highly aligned 2D layered perovskite one-dimensional micro-wire arrays.38 The obtained structures possessed excellent uniformity, high-quality crystallinity, and high structural anisotropy, which allowed the fabrication of high-performance polarization-sensitive photodetectors. Overall, there are a number of various templates that are used to synthesize miscellaneous ligand-free perovskite nano- and microstructures. These templates include titania,41 polystyrene,42 metal–organic frameworks,43 and mesoporous silica44 that are utilized for the fabrication of perovskite nanostructures with different dimensionality, such as 1D-quantum dots, 2D-nanorods or nanowires and 3D-bulk materials. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study which conducts an in-depth investigation of how the variation of synthesis parameters influences the resulting optical performances of PNCs obtained by the template-assisted synthesis approach.
In this work, we develop a new facile ligand-free template-assisted approach to PNC fabrication with near-unity absolute quantum yield and extensively study how various synthesis parameters affect their optical properties. We show that the optical properties of the obtained PNCs are affected not only by the template morphology, they depend more on the concentration of precursor solutions, anion, and cation ratio, as well as on adding defect-passivating dopants. As templates for PNC preparation, we utilize CaCO3 vaterite micro- and submicrospheres. Vaterite is one of the polymorphic modifications of calcium carbonate that has a highly porous surface with the pore size lying in the range of tens of nanometers.45 PNCs are synthesized in the pores of vaterite spheres as the solvent evaporates, thus making the growth of PNCs confined to the pore size. We thoroughly study how different synthesis parameters such as perovskite concentrations, precursor ratios, template size, surface area, pore volume, and addition of dopants affect the optical properties of the obtained PNCs. Additionally, we carry out the comprehensive structural and optical characterization of the synthesized PNCs. Furthermore, the developed synthetic approach is not only facile and easily tunable, but also does not depend on conditions such as an air- and moisture-free atmosphere, which is confirmed by testing for 30 days. Moreover, we modify PNCs with Yb3+ and measure their PLQY and up-conversion properties. Finally, we discuss the potential of the obtained PNCs for use as infrared radiation visualizers, showing their excellent characteristics comparable to those available on the market.
Results and discussion
In this work, vaterite CaCO3 particles were utilized as a template material for the synthesis of PNCs (Fig. 1). For this, we chose two sizes of CaCO3 templates with the same chemical composition but with different morphologies, which allowed us to study the influence of template parameters on the resulting properties of PNCs to a greater extent. Submicro (Sub) and micrometric (Mic) sized particles of CaCO3 were obtained as described elsewhere.46 The vaterite spheres were soaked in a mixture of perovskite precursors (CsBr and PbBr2) dissolved in DMSO. Afterwards, the suspension of CaCO3 particles (Sub and Mic) was then deposited on a glass substrate via spin coating. As a result of DMSO evaporation CsPbBr3 PNCs were crystallized in pores of CaCO3.

(B) The influence of various synthesis parameters, such as the amount of perovskite precursors, the ratio between CsBr and PbBr2, and the amount of Yb used in synthesis on the optical properties of the obtained PNCs. 
According to SEM analysis (Fig. 2), the average sizes of CaCO3 submicrospheres (Sub) and microspheres (Mic) were 0.4 ± 0.2 μm and 4.7 ± 2.0 μm (Fig. 2B), respectively. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a backscattered electron detector showed the presence of PNCs (Fig. 2C and D) embedded into vaterite spheres and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirmed the presence of carbon (C), lead (Pb) and bromine (Br) (Fig. 2E). Moreover, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was performed in order to evaluate the pore sizes (3.5 and 14.4 nm for Sub and Mic, respectively) of CaCO3 (Fig. 2F). We assume that the pore size is one of the crucial parameters that manage the behavior of PNC formation. As we suppose, a change in the optical properties of the obtained PNCs occurs due to the decrease of PNC sizes that is caused by the alteration of synthesis parameters such as variation of the added amount of perovskite precursors and the sizes of pores. To this end, the surface area (39.2 and 13.6 m2 g−1 for Sub and Mic, respectively) and pore volume (0.138 and 0.062 cm3 g−1 for Sub and Mic, respectively) were measured.

Optimization of PNCs obtained in the pores of CaCO3 templates was achieved by the alteration of the synthesis parameters displayed in Table S1.† First, the amount of the added precursors (PbBr2 and CsBr) for the synthesis was changed with a constant amount of CaCO3 templates. The amount of precursors used was limited by two factors: on the one hand, the use of less than 0.6 μmol CsPbBr3 precursors led to an extreme decrease of the PL intensity. On the other hand, we did not use more than 6.3 μmol CsPbBr3, since this caused the growth of PNCs on the surface of the glass substrate instead of CaCO3 spheres. The PL spectra of the resulting PNCs obtained in the pores of the CaCO3 templates were measured. The highest wavelength maxima of PL spectra correspond to 516.8 nm for Sub and 518.4 for Mic spheres in the case of the addition of 6.3 μmol CsPbBr3 precursors for template-assisted synthesis (Fig. 3A). However, the decrease of the used amount of perovskite precursors results in a blue-shift of the PL spectra of the obtained CsPbBr3 for about 9.3 nm in the case of Sub and 6.9 nm in the case of Mic spheres (Fig. 3B and C). This can be attributed to the decrease of the PNC size, since the bandgap is directly related to the size of PNCs. A decrease of the nanocrystal size causes the widening of the bandgap, which leads to the shifting of the PL wavelength to the blue region due to the quantum confinement effect.47,48 It should be noted that the presence of Cl− ions can potentially affect the PL properties of CsPbBr3 PNCs. Thus, we used CaBr2 instead of CaCl2 which is commonly used for vaterite synthesis to avoid chloride ion contamination.45

(B) Typical PL spectra of CsPbBr3 obtained in CaCO3 templates (Sub and Mic). (C) Evolution of the maximum PL peaks of CsPbBr3 obtained in CaCO3 templates at different amounts of added perovskite precursors in mg. (D) Evolution of maximum PL peaks of CsPbBr3 obtained in CaCO3 templates at different added ratios of PbBr2:CsBr. 
The blue-shift of PL spectra is similar for two types of matrix spheres: Sub and Mic. The maximum peaks of PL spectra wavelengths vary from 508 to 517 nm for CsPbBr3 (Sub) PNCs and from 512 to 517 nm for CsPbBr3 (Mic) PNCs. As can be seen, the addition of the same concentration of the perovskite precursor solution to the Mic and Sub spheres results in a higher decrease of the PL wavelength in the case of Sub particles. For example, the addition of 3.3 μmol of CsPbBr3 precursors results in peak wavelengths of 514.4 nm for Sub and 516.6 nm for Mic vaterite spheres (Fig. 3C). Overall, the addition of the same amount of CsPbBr3 precursors leads to shorter PL wavelengths in the case of Sub spheres. Since we add the same concentration of the perovskite precursor to both Sub and Mic particles, but the Mic spheres have bigger pores that lead to higher amounts of precursor molecules in a single pore of Mic (Fig. 2F). This results in bigger crystals grown within the larger pores, and thus we observe a smaller PL shift in the case of Mic particles. Therefore, it can be seen that tuning of the size and spectral properties of PNCs can be achieved not only by the variation of the template pore size, but also through the variation of the added amount of perovskite precursor.
Our next step was to analyze the influence of the PbBr2:CsBr ratio on the optical performances of PNCs. We have varied the molar ratio between PbBr2 and CsBr from 1:1.0 to 1:1.5 (Table S2†) and measured how it affected the intensity and peak wavelength of PL. Interestingly, we have noticed that this change in ratio does not affect either the PL peak wavelength (Fig. 3D) or the PL intensity (Fig. S1†). Thus, the main contributing factor to the blue shift was the overall amount of perovskite precursors added to the vaterite spheres and the morphology of the spheres themselves.
Furthermore, we have investigated the influence of synthesis conditions on the PLQY. According to the performed measurements (Table S3† and Fig. 4), the PLQY of CsPbBr3 PNCs obtained in CaCO3 templates increases as we increase the CsBr amount and the ratio of PbBr2:CsBr changes from 1:1.0 to 1:1.5 in the molar ratio for both types of spheres (Sub and Mic). Additionally, the PLQY increases with the rise of the amount of perovskite precursors added to the synthesis. Generally, the addition of rare-earth elements, in particular Yb3+, results in an increase of the near-infrared PLQY of PNCs due to the quantum cutting effect.49–51 The electrons in the conduction band and the holes in the valence band reach the intermediate defect states, and then the energy is transferred to Yb3+ ions.52 Furthermore, Yb3+ is able to substitute the Pb2+ ions, and since the atomic radius of Yb3+ is smaller than that of Pb2+ this results in a decrease in the interplanar distance in the crystal lattice. Combined with the increase in the bonding energy this makes Yb3+-doped PNCs more resistant to external conditions. Moreover, the doping of PNCs with lanthanides results in a higher chance of oxidation of Pb0 defects to Pb2+, thereby increasing perovskite stability and emission efficiency.53 For this reason, to investigate the influence of the Yb3+ ions on the PLQY of fabricated CsPbBr3 PNCs, different amounts of Yb3+ (0–6 mol%) were added during the synthesis (Table S4† and Fig. 4). The presence of Yb3+ in Mic with the obtained PNCs was verified using ICP-AES (Table S5†). According to the obtained data, the PLQY increased by 20–30% in the case of the addition of Yb3+ to PNCs obtained at a ratio of PbBr2:CsBr = 1:1.5. PNCs obtained by the addition of perovskite precursors from 4 to 5.1 μmol with the addition of 4–6 mol% Yb3+ for Sub showed a PLQY close to 100%. The difference in the PLQY of PNCs synthesized with the addition of 4 mol% or 6 mol% of Yb3+ is not significant for Sub and Mic proving that at this added amount of Yb3+ the PLQY reaches its saturation level. Therefore, we can conclude that this amount of Yb3+ shows the saturation level. It can be noticed that the PLQY for Mic spheres after the addition of Yb3+ starts to decrease as the laser power density rises. We assume that this can be attributed to the ability of Yb3+ to passivate the defects in the formed PNCs, and thus the PLQY graph starts to form a plateau. However, with the further increase of the laser power density, the Auger recombination begins to prevail, which leads to a decrease in the PLQY.54
 Fig. 4  PLQY of Sub and Mic loaded with PNCs with and without the addition of Yb. From top to bottom: Sub, Sub with the addition of Yb (6 mol%), Mic, Mic with the addition of Yb (6 mol%). For the samples without the addition of Yb ratios of PbBr2:CsBr varied from 1:1 to 1:1.5. For the samples with the addition of Yb, the ratio PbBr2:CsBr was chosen as 1:1.15 and the concentrations of added Yb varied from 0 to 6 mol%. 
Upon achieving the maximal PLQY of CsPbBr3 PNCs obtained in CaCO3, we investigated their structural properties. For instance, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of a sample with the highest ratio of PbBr2:CsBr (1:1.5) indicates the formation of an orthorhombic perovskite phase (group Pbnm)55 and the vaterite phase of calcium carbonate CaCO3 (Fig. 5A).45 The obtained diffractogram contains intensive diffraction peaks corresponding to the crystallographic planes (002), (110), (020), (200), (004), and (220) of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 phase, along with the ones assigned to the planes (020), (120), (211) of the vaterite CaCO3 phase. However, we also can observe an intensive signal at 29.35°, which is attributed to the plane (213) of the tetragonal CsPb2Br5 phase. The formation of the tetragonal phase can be attributed to the peculiarities of the template synthesis approach and the difference in solubility of CsBr and PbBr2 in polar solvents.56,57 For instance, CsBr has high water solubility and easily can be washed from CsPbBr3, whereas the CsPb2Br5 tetragonal phase demonstrates low solubility in water and other polar solvents, and can completely or partially coat the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 phase during the CsBr washing process.56,57 Furthermore, the presence of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 phase is additionally confirmed by data from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Microphotographs show PNCs at the edge of CaCO3 spheres, in only regions that can be pierced through (Fig. S3†). A distance of 0.59 nm between the lattice planes corresponds to the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 phase. Moreover, the Moiré fringe was detected with a size of nearly 2.2 nm. It can be explained by the overlapping of the parallel lattice planes of CsPbBr3 or/and CsPb2Br5 phases.58 Thus, CsPbBr3 orthorhombic PNCs protected with tetragonal CsPb2Br5 can be obtained. Due to the low solubility of CsPb2Br5 in water this phase may serve as a protection layer against humidity in the atmosphere.

(B) XPS spectra of Mic with fabricated PNCs in CaCO3 templates zoomed of different regions. (C) XPS spectra of Mic with fabricated PNCs in CaCO3 templates before and after etching. 
Furthermore, it should be noted that despite the presence of the CsPb2Br5 phase in the CaCO3 phase we did not observe a shift in the PL peak wavelength (Fig. 3D). Thus, we assume that the amount of non-perovskite phases present is relatively small. If this was not the case, then a part of the precursor material would have been converted into a non-perovskite material, which resulted in a decrease of the size of the obtained PNCs and the consequent blue shift. Therefore, the increase of CsBr compared to PbBr2 does not lead to the formation of a CsPb2Br5 matrix, but of a thin shell on the surface of CsPbBr3 PNCs within the pores of CaCO3. We assume that the presence of this shell leads to the passivation of surface defects of the obtained PNCs. This idea is further supported by PLQY measurements which demonstrate that the samples with higher amounts of CsBr in the precursor solution had higher PLQYs (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we have investigated the single-photon PL intensity dependence on the excitation fluence for Mic samples (Fig. S2†). The slope γ of the dependence on a log–log scale is shown in the plots and it corresponds to the coefficient in I ∼ Fγ (I – PL intensity, F – excitation fluence). As we increase the amount of CsBr the slope changes from 0.41 to 0.95, which we link to the passivation of surface defects due to the formation of CsPb2Br5.
An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was carried out to investigate the chemical composition of the synthesized samples of Mic with PNCs (1:1.5 molar ratio). Fig. 5B shows the XPS spectra obtained from the surface of the freshly prepared sample (red line) and after ion etching (green line) to investigate PNCs within CaCO3. The primary structure of the XPS spectra that corresponds to the freshly prepared Mic with PNCs (red line) contains core photoemission lines C 1s (∼285 eV), O 1s (∼532 eV), Ca 2p (∼349.5 eV), and Cs 3d (∼726 eV). However, after ion etching (green line), the photoelectron lines Pb 4f (∼140 eV) and Br 3d (∼70 eV) appear in the spectrum. XPS spectra show that there are no observable signals from PNCs on the surface of Mic (before etching), and hence, we can conclude that PNCs on the surface of Mic were not formed. To understand the chemical state of the elements and determine the stoichiometry of the formed Mic loaded with PNC structures, the high-resolution spectra of the C 1s, O 1s, Ca 2p, Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d photoelectron lines were obtained after ion etching (Fig. 5B). In particular, the analysis of the high-resolution spectrum of Ca 2p and C 1s photoelectron lines (Fig. 5C) allows us to conclude that the majority of the synthesized material stoichiometrically is calcium carbonate CaCO3 and its defects are in the form of hydrocarbonates Ca(HCO3)2.59 A significant amount of CO3 corresponding to 290 eV in the high-resolution spectrum of the C 1s core line also indicates the presence of other carbonates in the sample. Thus, the analysis of the high-resolution spectra of the Cs 3d5 photoelectron line (Fig. 5C) revealed the presence of two components corresponding to the chemical bonds of caesium with bromine Cs–Br (724.8 eV) and with oxygen Cs–O (725.3 eV), which can be assigned to the formation of perovskite CsPbBr3 and carbonate caesium Cs2CO3.60,61 This explains the presence of the Cs 3d photoelectron signal in the spectrum before ion etching. Apparently, more active caesium enters into a chemical reaction with calcium carbonate on the surface of Mic forming defects in it. It should be noted that the absence of diffraction lines (Fig. 5A) corresponding to the crystalline phases of Ca(HCO3)2 and Cs2CO3 indicates their miniscule amounts, which are formed in the form of amorphous layers at the Mic and PNC interfaces. A detailed examination of the high-resolution spectra of Br 3d and Pb 4f7 (Fig. 5C) shows that the photoelectron lines of bromine and lead have components corresponding to Br–Pb (68.8 eV), Br–O (69.7 eV) and Pb–Br (138.8 eV), Pb–O (137.2 eV), respectively.62–64 The presence of the component with a Pb–O bond in the spectrum of Pb 4f can be eventually the result of the interaction of perovskite with calcium bicarbonate, which leads to the degradation of CsPbBr3 followed by recrystallization in CsPb2Br5, as evidenced by the results of XRD analysis (Fig. 5A). The presence of CsPbBr3 PNCs in the Mic is confirmed not only by the XRD method, but also by the quantitative calculation of the elements Cs, Pb, and Br from the components of the high-resolution spectra Cs–Br(3d), Pb–Br(4f7), and Br–Pb(3d) respectively, which gives the stoichiometric ratio of Cs:Pb:Br that is equal to 1:1:3 (Fig. 5C). In addition, it is worth noting that the signal of the C–C bond at 285 eV can be attributed to trace ethanol appearing after purification of the final product.
Additionally, the up-conversion of infrared (IR) radiation to green light was measured for different samples (Sub and Mic with ratios of Cs:Pb equal to 1:1.0, 1:1.3, and 1:1.5 either with or without Yb3+ 6 mol% doping). As a light source for pulsed laser photoexcitation we used a tunable femtosecond laser with an optical parametric amplifier (pulse duration 220 fs, wavelength range 400–2100 nm), the laser beam of which was focused into a spot with a diameter of 120 μm (Fig. S4†).
According to the obtained data, Yb3+-doping of PNCs did not significantly increase the upconversion in the near-IR region. Fig. 6A and B shows the dependence of the two-photon PL intensity normalized on a maximum value of the excitation wavelength. The absence of additional peaks for Yb3+-doped samples indicates that Yb3+ only passivates defects in the perovskite structure and does not embed in the lattice. The up-conversion efficiency shows the same dependence on the PbBr2:CsBr ratio as the PLQY, and the growth of the CsBr concentration leads to an increase in the upconversion efficiency (Fig. 6C and D). The addition of Yb3+ also increases the up-conversion efficiency of CsPbBr3 PNCs obtained in CaCO3 due to defect passivation. The up-conversion was measured under 800 nm laser excitation. The two-photon PL intensity dependence on excitation fluence is presented in Fig. 6E and F. The slope of the dependence on a log–log scale is given in tables on the plots and it corresponds to the coefficient in I ∼ Fγ (I – PL intensity, F – excitation fluence). Generally, for the two-photon processes in perovskite nanocrystals the coefficient is around 2 due to the domination of exciton recombination, while for the three-photon processes the coefficient is around 3.54 PNCs with about 10 nm sizes which are not aggregated with each other possess an average slope close to 2. In our experiments, two-photon PL from the Sub and Mic spheres has an average slope close to 2, however, slopes for Sub spheres are slightly greater than for Mic spheres (Fig. 6E and F). This effect can be explained by the shift of the excitonic absorbance peak to a shorter wavelength due to quantum confinement. In the case of Sub spheres particles with smaller sizes contribute not only to two-photon absorption, but also to three-photon absorption which results in higher slopes. Moreover, the addition of Yb3+ leads to defect passivation, which in turn increases the slope values.65

(J) A digital image of the prepared visualizer under IR irradiation (wavelength 1000 nm). 
Furthermore, the PNCs obtained via reported template synthesis show great air and humid stability. The PLQY of CaCO3 with PNCs was studied directly after the synthesis of PNCs and after 30 days of storing these spheres in open air (Fig. 6G and H). As can be seen, the PLQY did not change with time, and thus, it can be assumed that they are stable in open air. We attribute this effect due to both properties of CaCO3 and the presence of the CsPb2Br5 phase. Moreover, the developed synthesis approach does not require the use of dry reagents. Therefore, we believe that this is an important step towards facilitating perovskite synthesis, which generally requires air- and water-free conditions.
Generally, this work is dedicated to the investigation of limitations and possibilities of the template-assisted approach for the manufacturing of PNCs. Therefore, it is important to highlight several drawbacks of this approach when it comes to the real-life application of this method for the manufacturing of optoelectronic devices. The broad emission profile of the obtained PNCs may decrease the efficiency of devices created based on PNCs synthesized using this method. Furthermore, it is necessary to point out that the PNCs that are obtained using the template-assisted approach remain embedded within the matrix of the template. We believe that this is the main limiting factor for the application of the developed approach in device manufacturing. Thus, we assume that these problems might be solved using another type of template, for example, porous films of aluminum or titanium oxide, which we plan to investigate in our further research. Nonetheless, the template-assisted approach can still be utilized for applications that rely mainly on the optical properties of PNCs.
To demonstrate the practical application of the developed template-assisted approach based on CaCO3 spheres, we created an infrared (IR) laser visualizer (Fig. 6J). For this Mic CaCO3 with CsPbBr3 PNCs (1:1.5 and Yb 6 mol%) was used. Briefly, the spheres with perovskites were removed from the glass substrate using toluene and then concentrated via centrifugation. Afterwards, a concentrated suspension of CaCO3 with PNCs in a single drop was applied on the surface of a new glass substrate to obtain a thick layer of PNCs to increase the light–matter interaction volume. The produced visualizers were investigated at a wavelength of 1000 nm for femtosecond laser beam visualization without any focusing and showed performance comparable to the commercial laser viewing cards. The minimum fluence at which the visualizer operates was around 10 nJ cm−2. For the NIR laser viewing card that does not require charging with light, the minimum fluence equals 9 nJ cm−2, and for the viewing IR card made of a slow-fading phosphor material that requires charging with room light, the minimum fluence is 3 nJ cm−2.
Conclusion
We have developed a new approach for the manufacturing of PNCs, which does not require the use of any kinds of organic ligands and allows us to obtain perovskites with nearly 100% absolute PLQY. Generally, this work offers an in-depth study of template-assisted synthesis of CsPbBr3 PNCs in CaCO3 particles of different sizes. We have utilized the obtained optimized samples for an up-converting IR visualizer operating due to strong PL induced by two-photon absorption and exhibiting performance compatible with commercially available analogues. Finally, the synthesized PNCs protected by CaCO3 templates demonstrated not only excellent optical properties but also 30 days of stability, which, we believe, paves the way for efficient photonic devices for down- and up-conversion of light frequency.
Materials and methods
Synthesis and structural characterization of CsPbBr3 PNCs in CaCO3 spheres
CaCO3 submicrospheres and microspheres (Sub and Mic) were synthesized in a co-precipitation reaction by mixing CaBr2 and Na2CO3 and further used as templates. Afterwards, CsPbBr3 PNCs were obtained via a template-assisted method in CaCO3 spheres in simultaneous processes of CsPbBr3 precursor solution (CsBr and PbBr2 in DMSO) evaporation and PNC crystallization. Furthermore, CsPbBr3 NCs were used to coat glass substrates by spin coating. In the template-assisted synthesis concentrations of perovskite precursors, the ratios of PbBr2:CsBr and CaCO3 template parameters, such as pore size and surface area were varied. The optical properties of the obtained CsPbBr3 in CaCO3 spheres such as PL spectra and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) were further investigated. The obtained CsPbBr3 PNCs in CaCO3 spheres were comprehensively characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron (XRP) spectroscopy. To evaluate the pore sizes, intrinsic surface areas and pore volumes of CaCO3 spheres Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) measurements were made. To confirm the presence of Yb3+ in the obtained samples, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was utilized. The detailed description of the synthetic route and the full data set are presented in the ESI.†
Optical measurements
PLQY measurements were carried out using an integrating sphere (Labsphere), a continuous-wave laser as an excitation source (405 nm), and a QE Pro fiber spectrometer. Power attenuation was performed with filter wheels equipped with absorptive ND filters FW212 (Thorlabs).
The upconversion PL measurements were performed using a custom 10 W Pharos single-unit integrated femtosecond laser system and a high power optical parametric amplifier Orpheus-F as an excitation source. The excitation femtosecond laser was focused on a sample from behind with a 10× objective. The signal was collected using a 10× objective. The signal collected through the long-pass filter was guided to an Andor Kymera 328i imaging spectrograph with an Andor iDus CCD camera. A detailed description of the optical measurements and the full data set are presented in the ESI.†
