    , Accepted 7th May 2020First published on 12th May 2020AbstractPiezocatalysis and piezo-photocatalysis have recently emerged as promising strategies to address energy and environmental issues through harvesting mechanical energy. Herein, we report that electrical conductivity, rather than piezoelectric coefficient, is more decisive in determining piezocatalytic and piezopotential enhanced photocatalytic activities. The high electrical conductivity of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 leads to superior piezo-photocatalytic catalytic activity compared to other reported piezocatalysts for water splitting (H2 production of 158 μmol g−1 h−1), Cr(VI) reduction (first-order rate constant of 0.045 min−1), and degradation of organic pollutants (first-order rate constant of 0.061 min−1 for RhB) by introducing sunlight and ultrasonic mechanical vibration with a frequency of 20–80 kHz. Furthermore, the mechanical power, vibration frequency, and particle size of the material are important factors to optimize the piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic performance. This work provides a useful guide to design new piezocatalytic or piezo-photocatalytic materials by synergistically considering the electrical conductivity and piezoelectric coefficient.
1. Introduction
Semiconducting photocatalysts have garnered considerable research interest as a low-cost and environmentally friendly material for renewable energy generation and water pollutant removal.1–6 However, the efficiencies of photocatalysts are severely hindered by high rates of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.7 Introducing a built-in electric field in photocatalysts is highly desirable for separating electron and hole pairs.8–11 Recently, an intriguing phenomenon termed piezo-phototronic effect has been proposed by Wang et al.,12 by which the band structures can be tuned by mechanical stress induced piezoelectric polarization charges to control the photoexcited charge carrier separation and transport behaviors in piezoelectrics.13–15 This effect shows great advantages in the field of energy harvesting since it allows the use of waste mechanical energy resources (e.g. vibration, water/wind flow, and noise) from the surrounding environment. In particular, the piezoelectric polarization induced internal electric field can drive the photogenerated electrons and holes to move in opposite directions and participate in reduction and oxidation reactions, resulting in enhanced efficiency of photocatalysis (i.e. piezo-photocatalytic effect).16–21 Up till now, tremendous studies have been devoted to piezo-/ferroelectric nanomaterials for catalytic applications.12,16,17,22–31 For example, Xue et al. firstly demonstrated a ∼25% enhancement of photocatalytic activity by coupling with the piezoelectric effect in ZnO nanowires.17 Yu et al. showed that KNbO3 nanosheets exhibited greatly improved degradation efficiency for organic dyes (first-order rate constant of 0.022 min−1 for RhB), when both solar light and mechanical vibrations were utilized.25 Very recently, a high H2 production rate of 124.1 μmol g−1 was obtained with BiFeO3 nanosheets under ultrasonic vibration, by which the band can be tilted under the induced piezoelectric field.24 Despite these progresses, the fundamental picture of piezopotential induced catalytic reactions is still incomplete. Deep understanding of the decisive factors for piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic activities is of critical importance for exploring desirable piezoelectric materials to boost the solar/mechanical to chemical energy conversion efficiency.
Electrical conductivity is deemed to be one of the most vital parameters determining the performance of various catalytic processes.32–35 Generally, high electrical conductivity leads to the acceleration of charge transfer in material systems, resulting in improved catalytic activity. Unfortunately, piezo-/ferroelectrics are usually highly insulating, which hinders their application as catalysts. Perovskite-structured Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) holds great promise as lead-free piezoelectrics by virtue of their good piezoelectric properties (d33 value of ∼58 pC N−1), lower toxicity and high structural stability.36–41 More importantly, different from other commonly studied piezoelectrics, the relatively high electrical conductivity (∼10−5 S m−1) of BNT that is crucial for efficient charge transport makes it an optimum choice for catalytic applications. Herein, we report high piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic activity in BNT nanospheres for water splitting to produce H2, reduction of Cr(VI), and decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB) under solar and/or ultrasonic wave (providing external stress force) irradiation. The catalytic efficiency is among the top catalytic efficiencies of most reported piezoelectric materials so far (e.g. ZnO, BaTiO3 and KNbO3). We carried out piezoelectric potential simulation, piezoresponse force microscopy characterization, and band diagram analysis to elucidate the mechanism. Based on systematic analysis, we found out that the electrical conductivity of piezoelectric materials plays a key role in the piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic activity, offering a new perspective and simple selection criteria for developing high-performance piezocatalysts.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of BNT
BNT nanospheres (BNT-1) were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. Typically, 5.6 mL Ti(OC4H9)4, 3.88 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, and 14.4 g NaOH were dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water and magnetically stirred for 2 h. The mixture was then poured into a 100 mL Teflon autoclave and was heated at 160 °C for 24 h in an oven. Finally, the BNT-1 sample was obtained. The bulk BNT (BNT-2) sample was purchased from Shanghai Dianyang Corporation (China).
2.2. Materials characterization
The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2550 VB) using a Cu Kα source (λ = 0.154 nm) operated at 45 kV. The morphology was characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Merlin). A double-spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (Cs-corrected STEM, Thermo Fisher, Titan Themis G2 60-300) operated at 300 kV equipped with an XFEG gun and Bruker Super-X EDX detectors was used for structural analysis on the atomic scale. Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRAM HR Evolution spectrometer (Horiba Scientific) with a 532 nm solid-state laser excitation source. The surface electronic states were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250 Xi). The binding energy was corrected using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, ESCALAB 250 Xi) was performed using the He I (21.22 eV) emission line for excitation. The optical absorption spectrum was measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 750) equipped with an integrating sphere. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) was carried out using an Asylum Research Cypher ES atomic force microscope equipped with a Pt-coated Si cantilever (TipsNano, NanoWorld Arrow-EFM) with a resonance frequency of ∼75 kHz and a spring constant of ∼2.8 N m−1. The conductivity was measured by using an ST2722-SD electrical conductivity meter (Suzhou Jingge Electronics).
2.3. Piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic activity measurements
The piezo/photocatalytic activities were evaluated by water splitting for H2 production, reduction of Cr(VI), and decomposition of RhB. A Xe lamp (300 W, PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd.) was used as the light source (light intensity: ca. 200 mW cm−2), and an ultrasonic cleaner (Branson 2800, 110 W, 40 kHz) was used to provide periodic local mechanical strain. To provide different frequencies and powers, an ultrasonic cleaner of KQ-100VDE (Kunshan Ultrasonic Instrument Co., Ltd) was employed. The temperature of the suspension was maintained at 25 °C during the catalytic reaction process. The H2-production activity was tested using a Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas-circulation system (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd.). 20 mg of the BNT catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing 15% by volume of triethanolamine as a sacrificial reagent. To load Pt on the BNT catalyst, 0.2 mmol H2PtCl6 was added to the suspension and irradiated by the Xe lamp for 1 h before measuring the produced hydrogen. The suspension was then irradiated using the Xe lamp and/or ultrasonic cleaner. The evolved H2 was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Techcomp GC-7900) with Ar as a carrier gas. For Cr(VI) reduction and RhB degradation measurements, 50 mg of BNT powders were dispersed in 100 mL of K2Cr2O7 or RhB aqueous solution (10 mg L−1), respectively. The solutions were stirred in the dark for 1 h to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The suspensions were then irradiated using the Xe lamp and/or ultrasonic cleaner. The concentrations were determined using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussion
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, BNT has a perovskite structure (ABO3) in the rhombohedral R3c space group; Bi3+ occupies half of the A site, Na+ occupies the other half of the A site, and Ti4+ occupies the B site.42,43Fig. 1b shows XRD patterns for the BNT samples. The diffraction peaks of BNT-1 match well with the rhombohedral BNT (JCPDS no. 36-0340). No peaks belonging to other phases were observed, indicating high purity of the BNT material synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The XRD pattern for BNT-2 possesses a small amount of a secondary phase (Bi2Ti2O7, JCPDS no. 32-0118), in addition to the main rhombohedral BNT phase. As shown in Fig. S1,† the BNT materials exhibit relatively broad Raman peaks due to the overlapping of different modes and A-site disorder, which is typical for perovskite-based relaxor ferroelectrics.44 The first A1 (TO) mode observed at 137 cm−1 is associated with the Na–O (A-site) vibration,45 and the intense bands at 276 cm−1 and the broad bands between 430 and 670 cm−1 are dominated by the vibrations of TiO6 octahedra.46 The broad peaks between 700 and 900 cm−1 can be assigned to the A1(LO) and E(LO) overlapping bands.47

BNT-1 represents spheroidal particles with diameters of ∼50 to 200 nm (Fig. 1c), while BNT-2 consists of irregularly shaped particles with sizes ranging from ∼100 nm to 2 μm (Fig. S2†). The corresponding distribution histograms of BNT materials are shown in Fig. S3a and b.† Based on the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S3c†), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was calculated to be 12.33 and 1.72 m2 g−1 for BNT-1 and BNT-2, respectively. The high-resolution TEM image of BNT-1 is displayed in Fig. 1d, wherein well-defined lattice fringes were observed with spacings of about 0.390 and 0.276 nm, corresponding to the (101) and (012) crystal planes of BNT, respectively. Moreover, Bi/Na and O atoms are clearly visible in the atomic-scale STEM image (Fig. 1e). The corresponding EDS elemental mapping images demonstrate that Bi, Na, Ti, and O elements are homogeneously distributed throughout the BNT nanospheres (Fig. 1f–i).
High-resolution XPS spectra of BNT-1 show Bi 4f, Ti 2p, Na 1s, and O 1s regions (Fig. 1j), which are consistent with the EDS analysis results. The binding energies for Bi 4f5/2 (164.0 eV) and Bi 4f7/2 (158.6 eV) can be assigned to Bi3+. Two peaks observed at 464.3 and 457.9 eV are ascribed to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 respectively, confirming the presence of Ti4+. The XPS signal for Na 1s is located at 1070.8 eV, and the O 1s peak is centred at 529.5 eV. The valence-band energy (Ev) was estimated to be ∼2.29 eV by linearly extrapolating the leading edge of the UPS spectrum to the baseline (Fig. 1k). The position of the conduction band (Ec) was calculated to be ∼−0.97 eV by using the equation of Ec = Ev − Eg,48 indicating that the band positions of BNT are favourably positioned for splitting water to produce H2. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 1l) show that the absorption edge of BNT-1 is shifted toward shorter wavelengths relative to BNT-2. Accordingly, the indirect optical band gaps (Eg) of the BNT materials were calculated from the Tauc plot (inset in Fig. 1j) to be 3.26 (BNT-1) and 3.03 eV (BNT-2), similar to previous reports.49,50 The differences between the optical properties can be ascribed to the nanosize effects.51,52
First, the piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic performances of the BNT materials for water splitting to produce H2 were evaluated. Irradiation-time dependence curves of H2 production for the BNT samples under different conditions are shown in Fig. 2a (BNT-1) and Fig. S4a† (BNT-2), respectively. And the corresponding production rates are summarized in Fig. 2d. Obviously, no H2 was generated under only ultrasonic vibration, only light irradiation and both of them without the catalyst. The amount of H2 produced after 5 h under simulated solar light irradiation was 302 μmol g−1 for BNT-1, greater than the amount of H2 produced by BNT-2 (273 μmol g−1), which can be ascribed to the higher surface area of BNT-1. It is worth noting that the photocatalytic production of H2 was significantly enhanced by the assistance of ultrasonic vibration, reaching 773 μmol g−1 for BNT-1 after 5 h, more than twice the value under illumination alone. In addition, the piezo-photocatalytic H2 production experiment was repeated using the recycled BNT-1 sample (Fig. 2g), which showed excellent stability for three consecutive cycles.

We further evaluated the catalytic activity of BNT materials for Cr(VI) reduction and RhB decomposition under different conditions. The reduction curves for Cr(VI) are shown in Fig. 2b (BNT-1) and Fig. S4b† (BNT-2), respectively. And the comparison of the corresponding first-order kinetic rate constants is shown in Fig. 2e. The BNT-1 catalyst exhibited its highest activity (first-order rate constant of 0.045 min−1) when co-utilizing ultrasonic vibration and light irradiation, which is ∼6.5 times the activity under light alone, and ∼4.5 times the activity under ultrasonic vibration alone. The utilization in Cr(VI) reduction demonstrates the universal application of the piezocatalytic process in water treatment. Similarly, introducing ultrasonic vibration also greatly enhanced the performance of BNT for photocatalytic RhB decomposition (Fig. 2c and S4c†), with the optimal first-order rate constant reaching up to 0.061 min−1 for BNT-1. Moreover, the experiments were repeated using the recycled BNT-1 sample, and a similar level of activity (Fig. 2h and i) was maintained after three cycles, indicating high stability of the BNT catalysts under both ultrasonic vibration and light irradiation. Similarly, negligible removal efficiency was detected under only ultrasonic vibration, only light irradiation and both of them without the catalyst.
To examine the role of radical species in the piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic processes using BNT materials, a series of control experiments were carried out by introducing different radical scavengers into the reaction system. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA-2Na, 1 mmol L−1), 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ, 1 mmol L−1), and isopropanol (IPA, 1 mmol L−1) were adopted as scavengers for holes (h+), superoxide radicals (·O2−), and hydroxyl radicals (·OH), respectively. Under light irradiation alone (Fig. S5a†), the degradation ratio of RhB decreased significantly after adding IPA and BQ, whereas the catalytic performance decreased slightly after adding BQ, indicating that ·OH and ·O2− were the major active species for BNT samples. Similar phenomena were observed for the trapping experiment under both light illumination and ultrasonic vibration (Fig. S5b†). Therefore, the piezoelectric field induced in BNT by the external forces further promoted the separation of electron–hole pairs and thus the formation of ·OH and ·O2−, which result in a higher oxidizing efficiency.
The piezo-/ferroelectric properties of BNT-1 were investigated by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). Fig. 3a shows a representative topography image, revealing well-dispersed spherical particles with heights in the range of ∼50 to 200 nm, which is consistent with the SEM and TEM characterization. The piezo-/ferroelectric nature of the BNT nanostructures was clearly confirmed by the typical 180° piezoresponse phase-reversal hysteresis and the amplitude-voltage butterfly loop obtained under a 6 V DC bias field (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, to confirm linear piezoelectricity, we carried out point-wise first and second harmonic measurements,55,56 over a range of excitation biases up to ∼4 V at six locations on the sample. As shown in Fig. 3c, the first harmonic response is linear with respect to the applied bias and is greater than the second harmonic quadratic response, indicating linear piezoelectricity in BNT-1.57

(f) Comparison of the piezoelectric potential generated in typical reported piezoelectric materials with different sizes under pressure.16,25,53,54 
The finite-element method (FEM) was further employed to simulate the piezoelectric potential generated in BNT materials by ultrasonic waves. Considering the acoustic pressure (from 105 to 106 Pa) and the impact force caused by acoustic cavitation (∼108 Pa), FEM simulations were carried out under two pressures of 0.1 and 100 MPa, respectively.25 The diameter (Ø) of the particle was set to 100 nm and 1 μm for BNT-1 and BNT-2, respectively. Obviously, the simulated maximum potential output of BNT-1 (0.7 V, Fig. 3d) is higher than that of BNT-2 (0.4 V, Fig. 3e) at 100 MPa. Lower mechanical pressure (0.1 MPa) induced smaller maximum potential outputs (Fig. S6†). We also provided a detailed comparison of simulation results of other piezoelectric nanostructures reported previously. As shown in Fig. 3f, all these results follow similar trends, demonstrating that the mechanical force provided by ultrasonic waves deforms nanostructured materials more readily than bulk ones, and produces a larger potential difference that can accelerate the separation of photogenerated carriers more effectively.
To gain an in-depth understanding of the piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic effects, a series of controlled experiments for H2 production using the BNT-1 sample was carried out. First, we tested the H2 production performance by changing the ultrasonic frequency (Fig. 4a). The results showed that the piezo-photocatalytic activity was highly dependent on frequency, with the highest activity being achieved at around 45 kHz. Additionally, the H2-evolution tests at different ultrasonic powers (Fig. 4b) showed that the piezo-photocatalytic activity steadily increased with increasing the power of ultrasonic vibration. These results clearly prove that ultrasonic mechanical vibration plays a vital role in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity, which should be attributable to piezoelectric effects of the BNT materials.

To optimize the piezocatalytic activity, both the piezoelectric properties (providing electric field to drive the separation of electron–hole pairs) and the electrical conductivity (favoring charge transfer) of piezoelectric materials need to be carefully managed. Although the effect of piezoelectricity has been extensively studied, the contribution of electrical conductivity to the piezocatalytic properties is still not clear. To clarify this, we first established the correlation between the piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and electrical conductivity (σ) in typical piezoelectric materials. As displayed in Fig. 4c, materials with high σ possess low d33, and vice versa. Furthermore, the piezocatalytic dye degradation efficiency of BNT-1 was compared with previous results for RhB degradation using other piezoelectric materials. As shown in Fig. 4d, the first-order rate constant with BNT-1 (0.034 min−1) is superior to that of most reported piezoelectric materials such as ZnO (0.009 min−1),72 BaTiO3 (0.004 min−1)72 and NaNbO3 (0.016 min−1).73 Interestingly, it can be clearly seen that the first-order rate constants match well with the trend of σ values for a series of oxide piezoelectric catalysts. Obviously, materials with high σ (e.g. BNT) have high piezocatalytic activity. The experimental conditions of reported works using different piezocatalysts are summarized in Table S1.† It should be noted that the ultrasonic power for BaTiO3 and ZnO (200 W)72 is higher than that in our experiment (110 W). According to our results, lower power leads to lower activity (Fig. 4b). Even so, the piezocatalytic activity of BNT in the current work is drastically higher than that of BaTiO3 and ZnO, which suggests that electrical conductivity is the dominating factor of the catalytic performance. Moreover, the electrical conductivity of the BNT-1 based bulk sample was measured, showing a high conductivity of ∼1.4 × 10−5 S m−1 (Table S2†), and is consistent with previous results.64 Our analysis manifests for the first time that electrical conductivity plays a decisive role in the piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic performance, which might be helpful for selecting and designing piezoelectric material based catalysts.
Before establishing the band diagrams, first principles calculations were performed to understand the effect of external pressure on the band gap of BNT (Fig. S7†). It is clearly seen from Table S3† that the variation of Eg is negligible (less than 0.1 eV) for BNT materials over a wide range of mechanical pressures (0 to 500 MPa). Based on the above experimental results and theoretical analysis, we tentatively propose a possible piezo-photocatalytic reaction mechanism for BNT materials (Fig. 4e and f). When irradiated by simulated solar light irradiation, electrons and holes are photogenerated within BNT and occupy states in the conduction band and valence band, respectively. Meanwhile, external stress provided by ultrasonic vibration on piezoelectric BNT nanostructures induces a built-in polarization field (i.e., piezoelectric potential), resulting in downward band bending on one surface, and upward band bending on the opposite surface. As a result, the internal electric field induced by stress on the BNT nanostructures drives the photogenerated electrons and holes to drift efficiently in opposite directions, reducing the bulk recombination rate and enhancing the catalytic activity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated high-efficiency piezocatalytic and piezopotential enhanced photocatalytic activity of BNT nanostructures. The piezoelectric potential induced by periodic ultrasonic vibrations effectively separates photogenerated charge carriers, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity. As a result, the BNT nanostructures demonstrated about 2.6 times higher activity for H2 evolution (158 μmol g−1 h−1), 6.5 times higher activity for Cr(VI) reduction (first-order rate constant of 0.045 min−1), and 4.5 times higher activity (first-order rate constant of 0.061 min−1 for RhB) for RhB degradation compared to the activities under light illumination alone, with efficiencies exceeding those of most of the reported piezoelectric materials. We found that the piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic performances are strongly dependent on the mechanical power, vibration frequency, and particle size of the material. Moreover, recycling experiments showed satisfactory stability of BNT under solar irradiation and ultrasonic vibration. Importantly, we demonstrated for the first time that the electrical conductivity of piezoelectrics is the dominating factor for establishing efficient piezocatalytic or piezo-photocatalytic systems. This study has shed light on the potential of piezocatalysis and piezo-photocatalysis for water purification and renewable energy production by utilizing simulated solar light and weak mechanical energy and provided a new perspective for the selection and design of highly efficient piezo- or piezo-photocatalysts in future studies.
