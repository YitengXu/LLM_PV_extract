    , Accepted 24th July 2021First published on 27th July 2021AbstractThe electron transport layer (ETL) transfers the photogenerated electrons generated by the perovskite layer to the conductive glass substrate, which plays a vital role in the performance of the perovskite-based photodetector. SnO2, as a wide bandgap semiconductor, is a promising ETL material, but the interface electronic recombination between it and the perovskite layer limits the improvement of device efficiency. It is hopeful that {Mo132} will solve this problem. Here, we doped SnO2 with {Mo132}, which can simultaneously adjust the energy level of SnO2 and increase the crystallinity of the perovskite crystal, thereby reducing interface electronic recombination. The conduction band of the obtained composite material moves down by 0.11 V, which is more conducive to the transfer of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the doping of {Mo132} significantly increases the ultraviolet light absorption intensity of the composite material, which is conducive to the collection of sunlight. In addition, the oxygen vacancy content of the composite material is reduced, which is conducive to reducing the electron recombination center. Therefore, the photocurrent of the device is increased from 13.32 μA to 27.04 μA, an increase of about 1.03 times.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite materials have attracted extensive attention from researchers all over the world owing to their excellent performance, and they are widely used in solar cells,1–8 luminescent materials,9–15 photodetectors,16–31 photocatalysis32–34 and other fields. The main characteristics of organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites are that they have a tunable bandgap, a higher carrier migration rate, and a better light absorption efficiency.35–38 However, the perovskite film itself has ion migration and defect states,39–41 and the energy level mismatch also exists between the perovskite layer and the electron transport layer (ETL).42 These problems will lead to the accumulation of photogenerated electrons between the perovskite layer and the ETL, and reduce the efficiency of perovskite-based devices by producing interface electron recombination.43 TiO2 has been widely used as the ETL of perovskite-based devices due to its suitable energy level, but the energy-consuming high-temperature production process of TiO2 (>450 °C) limits its large-scale commercial application.44 Moreover, the instability of TiO2 under ultraviolet light will also cause the ultraviolet light decomposition of the perovskite layer.45–47
SnO2 is a wide-bandgap n-type semiconductor with a higher electron migration rate and is expected to replace TiO2 as the electron transport material (ETM).48 SnO2 has a low-temperature preparation process,49 so it can save energy to a large extent. Besides, SnO2 has good ultraviolet-visible and chemical stability, which can improve the stability of the device.48,50,51 However, compared with the electron mobility of the perovskite layer (0.5–30 cm2 V−1 s−1), the electron mobility of n-type semiconductor SnO2 (10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is still very low.52,53 The interface electron recombination caused by this difference in electron mobility will greatly reduce the device efficiency. Fullerene and its derivatives are a kind of carbon material with good electrical conductivity, which have been widely used in ETM. Typically, Liu et al. used fluoroalkyl substituted fullerenes and perovskites to form a heterojunction structure.54 This fullerene derivative realizes the effective passivation of the perovskite, reduces the hysteresis phenomenon, and improves the stability of the device. Fu et al. introduced the functional fullerene into the perovskite through the anti-solvent method, which can not only control the crystallization of the perovskite, but also passivate the surface defects of the perovskite, thereby improving the performance of the device.55 Additionally, the thickness of the thin SnO2 layer prepared by spin coating is about 30 nm, and the film has poor wettability, which will affect the quality of the perovskite layer grown on it.51,56 The method currently studied to improve the wettability of the SnO2 surface is doping. For example, Hui et al. modified SnO2 by doping red carbon quantum dots rich in hydroxyl and carboxyl ligands to improve the performance of the device.57 At present, studies have shown that fullerenes are a type of effective function material to reduce the interface electronic recombination of SnO2.58–60 However, the expensive cost and complex synthesis processes limit their wide application. Therefore, it is particularly important to find a substitute for fullerene materials.
Polyoxometalate is a kind of cluster compound composed of transition metal and oxygen, which has been widely used in photoelectric catalysis, photodetection and other fields due to the characteristics of acting as a shallow electron trap and effectively separating photogenerated excitons.61–71 Kepler-type polyoxometalates, as an important branch of polyoxometalates, have a special wheel-like structure. Among them, (NH4)42[MoVI72MoV60O372(CH3COO)30(H2O)72] ({Mo132}), as a polyoxometalate with an inorganic fullerene-like structure, is expected to become an inorganic material to replace fullerene. Its structure is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). {Mo132}is built up of 12 {Mo11} fragments of the type {(Mo)Mo5}{MoV1}5 with central pentagonal bipyramidal {MoO7} groups, such that the fivefold symmetry axes are retained in the resulting spherical object, which shows an overall icosahedral symmetry, which includes the respective C2 and C3 symmetry axes. The structure of fullerene C60 is also composed of a pentagonal face and a hexagonal face. Its molecular point group is Ih, with five-fold symmetry, which is consistent with the structural symmetry of Mo132. This spherical structure facilitates the transmission of electrons. {Mo132} has high redox activity and rapid electronic transfer capability. It has been used to modify photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells.72 Besides, the suitable energy level, abundant carboxyl ligands and wide ultraviolet-visible light absorption range of {Mo132} can elevate the performance of perovskite devices by improving the crystallization of the perovskite, reducing the interface electronic recombination and improving the light absorption.
ETL has an important impact on device performance. It is necessary to simultaneously adjust the energy level and electron mobility of SnO2 and solve the problem of growing a high-quality perovskite layer on the SnO2 layer. In this work, we doped the SnO2 with polyoxometalates {Mo132} containing abundant carboxyl ligands and applied it to perovskite-based photodetectors. {Mo132} is a kind of light-induced electron donor/acceptor, which not only enhances electron transport, but also adjusts the energy level of SnO2 to make it more compatible with the perovskite layer. At the same time, the abundant carboxyl ligands on {Mo132} can passivate the grain boundary of the perovskite layer and promote the increase of the crystallinity of the perovskite film, effectively solving the problem of uneven perovskite growth on the SnO2 layer. Disorderly existed COO− in Mo132 can coordinate with Pb2+ ions, delay the crystallization of PbI2, reduce the trap state of Pb2+, and realize the passivation effect of Pb2+, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).73,74 The doped SnO2@Mo132 has significantly improved crystallinity and ultraviolet light absorption intensity, and the doped SnO2 oxygen vacancy content is reduced. These are all beneficial to the reduction of electronic recombination of the device. Therefore, the photocurrent of the photodetector based on the composite SnO2@Mo132 is significantly increased by ∼1.03 times.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of Mo132
{Mo132} is synthesized according to the literature method.75 N2H4·H2SO4(0.8 g, 6.1 mmol) is added to 250 mL aqueous solutions of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (5.6 g, 4.5 mmol) and CH3COONH4 (12.5 g, 162.2 mmol). The color of the solution changes from blue to green. After that, 50%(v/v) CH3COOH (83 mL) is added to the solution. After placing the solution at room temperature for 3–4 days, red-brown {Mo132} crystals are obtained.
2.2 Preparation of SnO2@Mo132 precursor
A tin(IV) oxide, 15 wt% colloidal dispersion is diluted to 2.67 wt% with deionized water to obtain the SnO2 precursor. Mo132 (2–5 mg mL−1) is added to the SnO2 precursor solution and stirred at room temperature for 3 h to obtain a SnO2@Mo132 precursor solution.
2.3 Device fabrication
A schematic diagram of the preparation procedure and device structure of the device is shown in Fig. 1. SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132 precursors are spin-coated on clean ITO/glass at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min to obtain the electron transport layer (ETL). The perovskite precursor is prepared by dissolving 0.461 g PbI2 and 0.157 g CH3NH3I (MAI) in 1 mL of DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (v:v) solution and stirring for 12 h. The perovskite precursor solution is spin-coated on the ETL at 2000 rpm for 60 s and anneals at 70 °C for 30 min to obtain the perovskite layer. The preparation of the perovskite precursor solution, spin coating, and annealing operations are all completed in the glove box filled with N2.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of SnO2@Mo132 composite
To study whether the chemical structure of SnO2 has changed, we analyzed the infrared spectrum (IR) and X-ray diffraction spectrum (XRD) of SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132 (Fig. 2a and b). It can be seen from the IR of {Mo132} in Fig. 2a that the broad peaks in the region of 3600–3200 cm−1 correspond to ν(O–H), and the absorption peaks at 968 cm−1 and 935 cm−1 are attributed to the MoO bond, the absorption peak at 792 cm−1 is attributed to the Mo–O–Mo bond, and the absorption peaks at 1546 cm−1 and 1404 cm−1 are attributed to COO− and NH4+ groups, respectively, which are characteristic peaks of Kepler-type {Mo132}.76 With the doping of polyoxometalate and SnO2, it can be seen that the absorption peak intensity of COO− and NH4+ groups at 1546 cm−1 and 1404 cm−1 decreases. The absorption peak intensity of the MoO bond located at 968 cm−1 and 935 cm−1 also decreased, both of which indicate the interaction between polyoxometalate and SnO2. It can be seen from Fig. 2b that compared with the standard XRD card of SnO2, the diffraction peaks located at 26.31°, 33.86° and 51.83° correspond to the (110), (101) and (211) crystallographic planes, respectively.77Fig. 2b also shows that the main diffraction peaks of the doped SnO2 do not shift significantly but their intensity increases, indicating that doping of {Mo132} does not change the structure of SnO2 but can increase the crystallinity of SnO2 crystals. In addition, it is worth mentioning that no diffraction peak of {Mo132} can be observed in the XRD of the composite material, which is attributed to the low content of {Mo132}.

In order to further study the composite material SnO2@Mo132, we performed scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmittance electron microscope (TEM) tests on SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132 to characterize their morphology and crystallinity, as shown in Fig. 2c, d and 3. From the scanning electron micrograph, we can see that both SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132 layers can uniformly cover the ITO surface, with a grain size of 5–10 nm, which is consistent with the literature.78 Doping does not change the morphology of the SnO2 layer. This is consistent with the result observed at 20 nm in the TEM image. Fig. 3b and e are high-resolution TEM test images of SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132, respectively, and Fig. 3c and f show the corresponding electron diffraction patterns. Both can see clear lattice fringes and the lattice fringe spacings are measured to be 0.332 nm and 0.331 nm, respectively, corresponding to the (110) crystal plane of SnO2,79 which is consistent with the XRD test results, indicating that the SnO2 has high crystallinity before and after doping.

In order to further verify the existence of {Mo132} in the composite material and the chemical state of each element in the composite material, we conducted the X-ray energy spectrum (EDX) (Fig. S3, ESI†) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4, ESI†). Fig. S3 (ESI†) proves that {Mo132} is uniformly distributed in the SnO2 ETL. For SnO2, Sn 3d shows binding energies at 487.1 eV and 495.54 eV, while for SnO2@Mo132, Sn 3d shows binding energies at 486.5 eV and 494.95 eV. The shifted Sn 3d binding energy demonstrates that there is electron transfer between SnO2 and Mo132, rather than a simple physical mixing.80,81 This is consistent with the results of the IR test. O 1s shows binding energy at 530.4 eV (O1), 531.3 eV (O2) and 532.5 eV (O3), respectively. The low binding energy of 530.4 eV is ascribed to the O in the Sn–O bond, and the high binding energy of 531.3 eV and 532.5 eV are attributed to the oxygen vacancies (VO) and the dangling –OH on the surface of SnO2.82–84 We calculated lattice oxygen atoms (Olattice) and vacant oxygen atoms (Odefect) according to the area of each part under the O 1s curve, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). It is found that the [Odefect/Olattice] of SnO2@Mo132 is smaller than that of SnO2, which indicates that the surface oxygen defects of the doped film are reduced. Schematic illustration of the doped system of the composite is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Surface –OH groups and VO defects may become charge recombination centers that hinder carrier transport, thereby negatively affecting device performance. Therefore, reduced oxygen defects can also help improve device performance. The binding energies of Mo5/2 and Mo3/2 in the high binding energy region are 232.3 eV and 235.4 eV, respectively, which are characteristic peaks of fully oxidized MoIV atoms. The binding energies of Mo5/2 and Mo3/2 in the low binding energy region are 231.6 eV and 234.4 eV, respectively, which belong to the characteristic peaks of MoV atoms in the reduced state.85,86

We performed UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-vis) tests on SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132 to study their optical properties, as shown in Fig. 2e. Compared with pure SnO2, the absorption of composite SnO2@Mo132 in the entire ultraviolet and visible light region can significantly improve, which shows that the doping of {Mo132} improves the UV-visible light absorption of the composite material, which can also further increase the photocurrent of the device.
3.2 Characterization of perovskite films
As we all know, the quality of perovskite films determines the performance of perovskite-based devices. Therefore, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) tests on the perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  (a) Top SEM image of the perovskite film grown on SnO2@Mo132; (b) top SEM image of the perovskite film grown on SnO2; (c) grain size graph of the perovskite film grown on SnO2@Mo132; (d) grain size graph of the perovskite film grown on SnO2; (e) XRD. 
It can be seen from the top scanning electron micrograph that the perovskite layers grown on SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132 are dense and have relatively high crystallinity, which can be further confirmed by XRD patterns. We counted the grain size of perovskite layer, and analyzed the data with a Gaussian curve, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. Compared with the control film, the average grain size of the film grown on SnO2@Mo132 increased from 246.61 nm to 393.74 nm, which indicates that the rich COO− ligands in {Mo132} can promote the growth of the perovskite layer.87,88
The XRD pattern shows that the crystallinity of the perovskite layer is very high. There are two sharp diffraction peaks at 14.45° and 28.75°, corresponding to the (110) and (220) crystal planes of the perovskite, respectively. The perovskite film grown on SnO2@Mo132 has a significantly enhanced diffraction peak intensity on the (110), (200) and (224) crystal plane, indicating that the perovskite film grown on SnO2@Mo132 has higher crystallinity.
3.3 Characterization of device performance
To explore the influence of {Mo132} doping on device performance, we characterized the device performance of SnO2, Mo132 and SnO2@Mo132, respectively, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 6a. The figure shows that the photocurrent has high reproducibility after multiple light switches, indicating that the stability of this perovskite-based photodetector is very good. The performance improvement of the device with {Mo132} can be attributed to the excellent optical activity of {Mo132}, which acts as an electron donor/acceptor under light to accelerate electron transport. The photocurrent of the device with the composite material used as the ETL is significantly increased. On the one hand, the crystallinity of doped SnO2 has been improved, which has been confirmed by XRD tests. The improvement of crystallinity is beneficial to the improvement of device performance. On the other hand, the energy levels of each part in the device are shown in Fig. 6b.89,90 The electronic structural properties of these ETLs are investigated by UV-visible spectrum (UV-vis) and UV photoelectron spectrum (UPS) measurements, as shown in the Fig. S7 (ESI†). The energy levels of SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132 can be investigated by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to be 3.69 eV and 3.55 eV, respectively. The VB of SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132 can be obtained through the UPS spectrum. VB = hν − (Ecutoff − EVB), where Ecutoff is the high binding energy, EVB is the valence band, hν = 21.22 eV.91 The VB energy levels of pristine SnO2 and SnO2@Mo132 films lay at −8.21 and −8.18 eV, and the corresponding CB energy levels lay at −4.52 and −4.63 eV, respectively. The Mott–Schottky tests (Fig. S8, ESI†) also confirmed that with the addition of polyoxometalate, the flat band potential of SnO2 moved down, which means that the ECB of SnO2 moved down.92 The reduction of the energy level can promote the transmission of electrons from the perovskite layer to the SnO2 layer, thereby promoting the increase of current. At the same time, the COO− ligands in {Mo132} can promote the formation of larger-sized grains of perovskite,87,88 which can also effectively increase the photocurrent of the perovskite-based photodetector. In order to determine the optimal doping amount of polyoxometalate {Mo132}, we prepared a series of devices with different doping concentrations and tested the time-resolved photocurrent of the device as well as the corresponding I–V curve under simulated AM 1.5 illumination and 3 V bias, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. The time-resolved current curve shows that the optimal doping concentration of {Mo132} is 3 mg mL−1, and the corresponding photocurrent can increase from ∼13.32 μA to ∼27.04 μA. Interestingly, the performance of the device decreases as the concentration of polyoxometalate increases. This is attributed that the characteristic of large-size clustered Kepler polyoxometalate {Mo132} that tend to aggregate and cause the coagulation of the SnO2 colloidal precursor solution when the polyoxometalate concentration increases, thereby reducing the conductivity of SnO2.93 The I–V curve corresponding to the time-resolved current curve also shows that when the doping concentration of the polyoxometalate is 3 mg mL−1, the performance of the device is the best. Under the same light intensity, the photocurrent shows an upward trend with the increase of the bias voltage, because the bias voltage can provide power for the migration of electrons. The magnitude of the photocurrent is mainly reflected in the slope of the curve. The larger the slope of the curve, the higher the corresponding photocurrent.

(c) Time-resolved current curve of perovskite-based photodetectors doped with different concentrations of Mo132; (d) linear sweep voltammetry curves of Mo132 doped devices with different concentrations. 
Fig. S9 (ESI†) is the distensible view of time-dependent photocurrent. The rise time tr (the time it takes for the photocurrent to rise from 10% to 90%) and the fall time td (the time it takes for the photocurrent to decay from 90% to 10%) are recorded respectively.94 The figure shows that, compared with the control device, the tr of the device after doping with polyoxometalate is significantly shortened, which indicates that the doping of Mo132 can effectively inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes existing at the contact interface of perovskite and SnO2.
To verify the relationship between photocurrent and incident light intensity, we changed the light intensity (80 mW cm−2, 100 mW cm−2, 120 mW cm−2, 140 mW cm−2, 160 mW cm−2) to test the photocurrent and I–V curve of the device under the optimal doping concentration of 3 mg mL−1 (Fig. 7 and Fig. S10, ESI†).

The figure reveals that the intensity of incident light is directly proportional to the magnitude of the photocurrent. The increase in photon flux produces more photo-generated electrons as the intensity of incident light increases, thereby increasing the photocurrent of the device. The I–V curve shows that the photocurrent is also proportional to the bias voltage because the bias voltage can provide power for the migration of electrons. Responsivity (R) and the special detectivity (D*) are important parameters to measure the performance of photodetectors. Photoresponsivity (R) can be defined as the photocurrent generated upon incident light density, which can be calculated according to the following expression: (1)where Ip means photocurrent, Id is dark current, Plight is incident light intensity in the experiment, S is the active area. We drew the photoresponsivity curve under different light power, as shown in Fig. 7c. It can be seen from the figure that as the light power increases, the value of R gradually decreases, which is consistent with previous reports.
The specific detectivity (D*) is an important parameter of photodetectors, which represents the ability of photodetectors to detect weak light signals, which can be calculated according to the following expression: (2)where Idark is the current in the dark, S is the effective area of the photodetector under illumination, and q is the electron charge.95 The calculation result is shown in Fig. 7d.
In order to further verify that {Mo132} is the most suitable doping material in Kepler-type polyoxometalates, we synthesized a series of Kepler-type polyoxometalates {Mo154}, {Mo176}, {Mo72Cr30} and {Mo72Fe30}, and doped them into SnO2 at a concentration of 3 mg mL−1. The corresponding time-resolved current curve of the device is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). It can be seen from the figure that the performance of Kepler-type polyoxometalate-doped devices has generally improved, and the performance of {Mo132}-doped devices is the best. Therefore, {Mo132} with an inorganic fullerene structure is the best polyoxometalate for doping modification of SnO2.
In order to study the interface electron transport between the perovskite layer and the SnO2 layer, we conducted photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and SCLC tests, as shown in Fig. 8. The PL spectra of the perovskite layer spin-coated on different ETL layers are presented in Fig. 8a. Compared with the ITO/SnO2/perovskite sample, ITO/SnO2@Mo132/perovskite can observe more obvious PL quenching. This shows that photo-generated electrons can be transported to ETL more efficiently.96Fig. 8b shows that the fluorescence lifetime of the perovskite layer on SnO2@Mo132 is shorter, which indicates that there is less carrier recombination at the interface of the perovskite and SnO2@Mo132, and the charge extraction at the interface is faster. This is consistent with a previous study,96 and the results measured by PL. The SCLC curve is shown as Fig. 8. The dark current density of the photodetector processed by SnO2@Mo132 is lower than that of the pristine one. The result further proves that defect passivation toward undercoordinated Pb ions can effectively suppress dark current.25

EQE is a vital parameter to measure the photoelectric conversion capability of a photodetector. We tested the EQE of the devices before and after doping {Mo132}, as shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen from the figure that after doping {Mo132}, the EQE of the device has improved, which can be attributed to the increase in the electron transmission speed between the perovskite layer and the SnO2 layer.25
The stability test of the device is shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The doped device was tested for thermal stability at 85 °C, and it was found that the device could maintain 65% of the initial current after 70 h. The long-term stability of the device was tested in an ambient environment with an RH condition of 45 ± 5% without encapsulation, and it was found that after 200 h, the device can maintain 70% of the initial current with good stability. Signal stability was performed with a Gamry electrochemical workstation under a broadband noise generator (frequency = 0.05–8 kHz, peak = 1.5 kHz). The noise current is tested at 65 dB, 75 dB and 85 dB respectively. It can be seen from the figure that the current value of the device is relatively stable regardless of whether it is under light or dark conditions (Fig. S13, ESI†).
4. Conclusions
In total, we used simple doping methods to obtain the composite SnO2@Mo132 and applied it to the ETL of the perovskite-based photodetector. The composite material has the following advantages. First, the composite material has a more suitable energy level, so that the photogenerated carriers can be transported more effectively, thereby inhibiting the interface charge recombination. Second, the doping of polyoxometalates can reduce the oxygen vacancies of SnO2 and inhibit the charge recombination on SnO2. Third, the abundant carboxyl ligands in {Mo132} can promote the crystallization of the perovskite, thereby increasing the crystallinity of the perovskite layer. Fourth, the ultraviolet-visible light absorption intensity of the composite material is significantly improved because the polyoxometalate has good light absorption. Therefore, by using composite materials as the ETL, the photocurrent of the device has been improved a lot. Under simulated AM 1.5 illumination, the photocurrent of the best device is increased by about 2 times. This work provides a new idea for the application of polyoxometalate-based materials to modify semiconductor materials.
