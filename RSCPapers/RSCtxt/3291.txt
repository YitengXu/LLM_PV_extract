    , Accepted 27th July 2018First published on 27th July 2018AbstractAlthough numerous solar steam generation devices have been developed to remit energy and environmental crisis, challenges remain owing to restrained vapor transport in the devices and high cost of device fabrication. Herein, a novel “nano-fixation” strategy, inspired by biological fixation, is proposed to prepare a photothermal foam for solar steam generation in an inexpensive manner. The nano-fixation involves in situ crystallization of MoS2 nanocrystals on a melamine-derived carbon skeleton, restricting its shrinkage; this in turn yields foams with larger 3D macropores. Due to the unique structural advantages of the skeleton-fixed foam, i.e., large 3D macropores for steam transport, hydrophobicity and low density for localized heating, the hybrid foam shows a rapid water evaporation rate (1.458 kg m−2 h−1) with high energy conversion efficiency (90.4%) under 1 sun irradiation. In addition to the enhanced steam generation performance by this facile and low-cost device, the foam provides superior practical functionality as compared to many conventional photothermal devices including those employing selective oil adsorption and blocking of water leakage. More importantly, the proposed nano-fixation principle can also be applied for the preparation of Au NPs, Mo2C, or Fe/Fe3C-loaded carbon foams, thus showing great potential for various practical applications.
Introduction
In view of water scarcity and water pollution, steam generation through efficiently harvesting solar energy has been proven to be a technically feasible and green strategy, and it has been highly investigated.1–6 Steam generation, as a surface process, involves the absorption of solar energy, light-to-heat conversion, confinement of generated heat at the evaporative interface, and diffusion of water molecules from bulk water to the gas–solid interface. To date, most of the existing steam generation systems using solid photothermal agents often suffer from poor efficiency, owing to the restrained transport of water molecules in the devices as well as loss of solar energy in bulk water heating.7,8 From these perspectives, an ideal material for water evaporation should have high porosity, low density and self-floating ability. In an effort to fulfill these objectives, an advanced strategy can include rationally assembling active materials into their hydrophobic bulk form with abundant 3D porous structures. 3D porous architectures having intrinsic porous structures and channels as well as larger size along the z-direction as compared to 2D substrates9 are believed to be beneficial for enhancing their water evaporation performance. Previously, some attempts have focused on porous structures with meso/macropores such as vertically-aligned graphene sheet membranes and 3D-printed evaporators, which have been thoroughly investigated to facilitate the diffusion of water molecules for highly efficient water evaporation.4,7,10,11 Besides, Zhu's and Wang's groups have designed self-floating photothermal membranes with high hydrophobicity to gather solar radiation only at the water interface and prolong the life-span of photothermal agents for high steam generation performance.1,5 Despite these achievements, to date, constructing an all-in-one device simultaneously possessing a 3D porous structure and self-floating ability with low final cost as well as satisfactory performance via a simple fabrication technology still presents a major challenge in terms of scalability.
From these perspectives, carbon foam-based devices may be ideal candidates for low-cost and efficient solar steam generation. Many carbon foams have been facilely prepared by carbonizing natural or artificial organic monoliths; they exhibit low cost and high porosity, and they are light-weight as well as scalable. Such materials have been extensively prepared and incorporated with various substances, showing versatile properties in areas ranging from analysis to catalysis and water remediation.12–16 Particularly, carbon foams have also been demonstrated as self-floating devices with excellent hydrophobicity and low density for oil/water separation and as 3D substrates to support the growth of nanocrystals.13,14 Inspired by these observations, we hypothesize that the carbon foam can be a low-cost excellent support for photothermal nanocrystals, and it can simultaneously allow localized heating at the water interface and free transport of water molecules via photothermal agents for enhanced solar steam generation. However, the carbonization process, although endowing the foam with high hydrophobicity, can significantly decrease the size of the obtained carbon foam. This extreme skeleton shrinkage then gives rise to small-sized 3D macropores and low-porosity foams, restricting their performance. Therefore, to fully exploit the performance of the carbon foam-based device, it is necessary to confine the severe shrinkage of the foam skeleton, and further functionalization is also needed. In the fields of cytobiology, histology, and pathology, cytoskeleton fixation by formalin is an overwhelmingly popular choice and a critical step in the preparation of histological slices to prevent autolysis or putrefaction, thereby maintaining the morphology and structure of the tissue (Fig. 1a). Fixation can also increase the mechanical strength and stability of the treated tissues.17,18 This common case inspires the fixation of carbon skeleton by nanomaterials, described here for the first time (Fig. 1b), to prevent the shrinkage of foams during the carbonization process and enhance the performance of the resulting foams.

Based on the above-mentioned concepts, herein, a novel “nano-fixation” strategy is proposed to prepare a photothermal foam with large 3D macropores for highly efficient solar steam generation. The “nano-fixation” principle is defined as the in situ nucleation of exogenous nanocrystals on the foam skeleton during its preparation process; the shrinkage of the carbon skeleton can be restricted, thus obtaining a foam with larger 3D macropores and bigger volume than the foam obtained by annealing alone. For solar steam generation, foams with larger 3D macropores are designed by the nano-fixation principle and facilely realized via a co-annealing process, which involves in situ adhering of MoS2 nanocrystals on the skeleton of the carbon foam. This facile annealing method using readily available raw materials also meets the demand of simple and scalable fabrication of photothermal devices for steam generation. Compared to the pure carbon foam (CF foam), which exhibits extreme shrinkage, the MoS2-loaded carbon foam (CM foam) prepared in this study exhibits inhibited shrinkage, resulting in large pore volume and high porosity for water molecule diffusion (Fig. 1c), which leads to enhanced steam generation performance. Moreover, the resulting CM foam exhibits lightweight properties and hydrophobicity for self-floating as well as excellent light-to-heat conversion efficiency for water heating. As such, the functional foam is tailored for high photothermal conversion, localized heating and water molecule diffusion to the evaporation surface, thus resulting in high-performance solar steam generation. Moreover, the proposed nano-fixation principle is also carried out for the preparation of other functional foams such as AuNPs, Mo2C or Fe/Fe3C-loaded carbon foams, demonstrating the flexibility and universality of this novel nano-fixation principle.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a presents a schematic illustration of the synthesis process for the flexible CM foam. The detailed preparation process can be seen in the Experimental section. In this strategy, MF containing ATTM solution was dried in vacuum and annealed in argon atmosphere at 800 °C. During the annealing process, MF turned into CF foam, and the loaded ATTM was in situ decomposed into MoS2, facilely obtaining an MoS2-loaded carbon foam (CM foam). Fig. 2b shows the actual images of various foams. Interestingly, without ATTM loading, the volume of the resulting foam changed significantly by a factor of ∼15.6, whereas the foam with ATTM showed a smaller volume decrease by a factor of ∼6.8. This was because the adherence of ATTM-decomposed product on the skeleton of MF can effectively restrict both the vertical shrinkage and lateral shrinkage of foam microstructures. The microstructure changes in the foams were observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 2c and e, compared with that in the MF foam (Fig. S1a†), the interconnected skeletons of the foams were maintained well after high-temperature annealing, whereas the 3D network diameter and wall thickness decreased dramatically (Fig. S1b and c†). Without ATTM loading, the network diameter of the resulting foam changed significantly by a factor of ∼2.5, whereas the foam with ATTM loading showed a smaller diameter decrease by a factor of ∼1.9. Meanwhile, compared with the observations for the MF foam, the skeleton thickness shrank by a factor of ∼2.7 for the CF foam and only by a factor of ∼1.7 for the CM foam. For bare CF foam, the skeletons were smooth and densely packed (Fig. 2c and d). Inversely, the networks of CM foam were thick and loose with dense bumps (Fig. 2e and f). These dense bumps indicated the vast loading of MoS2 in the CM foam. In Fig. 2g, the SEM-EDX mapping of CM foam illustrates the uniform distribution of Mo and S over the entire CM foam skeletons. These microcosmic differences further demonstrated the restrictive shrinkage of the ATTM-decomposed product, which might provide larger surface area and higher porosity for the resulting foams.

To define the composition of the ATTM-decomposed product in the CM foam, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were conducted (Fig. 3). XRD analyses (Fig. 3a) indicated the coexistence of graphitic carbon and MoS2, according to the diffraction data for 2H-MoS2 (JCPDS no. 37-1492).19–21 Therefore, the main product of ATTM decomposition was MoS2. This was further verified by XPS spectra. As shown in the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S2†), except for C and N, significant Mo and S signals were detected. The high-resolution XPS spectrum showed that N 1s peaks were centered at 398.2 and 400.6 eV, and they were assigned to graphitic and pyridinic nitrogen, respectively (Fig. 3b). The distinct peak situated at 395.0 eV is the major characteristic peak of Mo 3p. Besides, in the high-resolution spectrum of Mo 3d, compared with pristine (NH4)2MoS4, CM foam exhibited a different Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 3c).22 Mo signals were mainly located at 232.2 and 229.0 eV, which were the characteristic peaks of 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of the +4 oxidation state of Mo, respectively, signifying that most MoVI species in ATTM were reduced to MoIV; a weak 3d3/2 peak at 235.3 eV corresponding to the +6 oxidation state remained, probably due to the transformation of MoVI in MoS42− to that of MoO3.22,23 The S 2p spectrum could be fitted into three peaks centered at 168.7, 163.1 and 161.9 eV (Fig. 3d). The binding energies at 163.1 and 161.9 eV could be assigned to S 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively, of S2− ligands. The binding energy at 168.7 eV was directly related to the oxidation state of S.24 Besides, it has been reported that the stoichiometry of MoSx can be calculated by the binding energy difference between Mo 3d5/2 and S 2p3/2.25 Therefore, based on the above-mentioned XPS results, the stoichiometry of MoSx in the CM foam was calculated to be MoS1.93, suggesting that MoS2 in CM foam containing only few oxidized molybdenum species is obtained after the annealing treatment. Raman analysis was then conducted to further characterize the CF and CM foams. As shown in Fig. 4a, the CF foam showed the appearance of the D peak at 1340 cm−1, which was ascribed to the disordered carbon or structure defects; it also exhibited a G peak at 1559 cm−1, indicating stretching vibrations of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms.13 However, in the spectrum of the CM foam, the D and G peaks slightly shifted to lower wavenumbers (1335 cm−1 for D peak and 1537 cm−1 for G peak), which might be associated with the interaction between the carbon skeletons and MoS2 nanocrystals. The intensity ratios of the D peak and G peak (ID/IG) were estimated to be 1.10 and 1.08 for CF and CM foams, respectively, which indicated that the ATTM pyrolysis process with gas release can affect the carbonization of melamine foam and the concentration of defect sites in the as-prepared foams. Besides, compared with the CF foam, the CM foam showed the appearance of peaks at 383.4 and 403.2 cm−1, corresponding to the in-plane E12g and out-of-plane A1g vibrations of MoS2, further indicating the formation of MoS2 nanocrystals in the CM foam.

The functions of bulk materials associated with interior structures are generally dependent on their open porosities.26 As a morphologically independent property, porosity is defined as the percentage of void space in a bulk material.27 Therefore, as an important parameter of bulk porous materials, the high porosity of CM foam was assessed and determined. As shown in Fig. S3a,† the CM foam was inert in ethanol. Soaking a piece of CM foam (∼0.8 cm−3 per piece) into a definite volume of ethanol did not increase the volume of the mixed system significantly (Fig. S3b†). Moreover, even after three pieces of CM foam were soaked, the volume of ethanol still showed negligible increase, indicating the high porosity of CM foam. The porosities of CF and CM foams were then determined to be 99.36% and 99.58% by mercury porosimetry, respectively. Besides, even after MoS2 loading, the CM foam prepared in this study still exhibited an ultralow density of 10.12 mg cm−3, which was lower than that of the CF foam (11.39 mg cm−3).
Additionally, another textural property of surface area was measured. Fig. 4b shows the surface areas of foams investigated by the N2 adsorption–desorption experiment. For CF foam, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was calculated to be 40.3 m2 g−1. The surface area of the CF foam prepared in this study contradicted the values reported elsewhere,28–30 which might be due to the different types of precursor melamine foams (e.g., Ledian in this study, Basotect® in ref. 28 and SINOYQX in ref. 29).28 In contrast, the adsorption–desorption isotherm of CM foam coincided with a type IV isotherm, and the BET surface area of the CM foam was calculated to be 322.7 m2 g−1. Pore analysis revealed that the majority of pores in CF and CM foams have sizes below 6 nm with a similar average size (Fig. S4 and Table S1†). However, the CM foam possessed larger pore volume than the CF foam. Therefore, combined with the results of the Raman analysis, the increased surface area of CM foam might be due to the combined effect of MoS2 coatings on the foam skeleton and more gas release during the pyrolysis of ATTM and melamine foam.12 The ultralow density, high porosity and large surface area together endow the CM foam with great potential for the production of filters, gas-flow controlling devices and adsorbents.
As one of the most important parameters of open-cell materials for hydrophobic applications, the contact angles of the as-prepared foams were measured. The commercial MF foam with amino groups showed high hydrophilicity, and it could immediately absorb water droplets (Fig. 4c), whereas the carbonized CF foam showed obvious hydrophobicity (Fig. 4d), corresponding with the previously reported elastic carbon foam.12 It can be seen from Fig. 4e that the contact angle of the CM foam was measured to be 133°, demonstrating the strong hydrophobicity of the CM foam. The hydrophobicity of CM foam was also examined by immersing it into organic solvents including toluene, hexane, phenixin, benzene, methanol and ethanol. As shown in Fig. S3c,† the CM foam could immediately absorb the solvents and sink to the bottom of the solvents. The improved hydrophobicity of CM foam might be due to the hydrophobic nature of the coated MoS2 and the surface roughness caused by the growth of MoS2 nanocrystals (Fig. 2f, 3d and e).13,31 These structural features of CM foam were also proved by its excellent oil/water separation performance (Fig. S5, S6 and Table S2†).
In all, the facile one-pot annealing process can result in the formation of a microporous MoS2-loaded carbon foam with large pore volume, high porosity, excellent hydrophobicity and low density. Besides, with the loading of in situ crystallized MoS2 nanoparticles, the extreme shrinkage of carbon foam can be efficiently inhibited, giving rise to a foam with bigger size, larger 3D macropores and higher porosity than the foam obtained by annealing alone. This phenomenon is herein defined as “nano-fixation”. The feasibility of this novel nano-fixation principle was also verified by the preparation of other functional foams such as carbon foams loaded with AuNPs,32 Mo2C33,34 or Fe/Fe3C.35 As shown in Fig. S7–S11,† these hybrid foams showed shrinkage-inhibited skeletons as well, demonstrating the flexibility and universality of this novel nano-fixation principle. Significantly, the inhibited skeleton shrinkage of hybrid foams might in turn stimulate the performances hindered by extreme skeleton shrinkage in pure foams.
Due to high hydrophobicity and low density, the loading of CM foam with photothermal MoS2 nanocrystals has great potential for solar steam generation.20,36,37 As shown in Fig. S3c,† the CM foam exhibits effective self-floating capability on the surface of water, further verifying the high hydrophobicity and low density of the foam. Importantly, this self-floating capability is necessary to allow interfacial heating. Besides, the macropores inside the CM foam (Fig. 2e) can allow the capillarity and evaporation of water molecules, ensuring continuous vapor generation. Before conducting the solar steam generation experiment, the light-to-heat conversion capability of the CM foam was evaluated by an infrared camera. Fig. 5a and b present the infrared photographs of CF and CM foams under 1 sun irradiation. Upon solar irradiation, the temperature of the CM foam increased quickly to 79 °C within 20 s, whereas the CF foam showed a lower temperature of ≈73 °C. With further irradiation, the CM foam showed a steady temperature of 90 °C, which was higher than the temperature of 83 °C for the CF foam. These results clearly demonstrated the higher energy conversion efficiency of the CM foam compared to that of the CF foam, which was imparted by MoS2 with strong absorption in the solar spectrum region.36

(e) Time course of water evaporation performance under light illumination (+) or in darkness (−) for CF and CM foams. 
After confirming the photothermal effect of CM foam, the water evaporation performance of the photothermal foam floating on the water surface was evaluated. Without solar irradiation, the water in beakers with CM or CF foam and without foam exhibited similar temperature profiles with a temperature of ≈30 °C. Upon solar irradiation, the temperature in the presence of the CM foam increased faster than that for pure water (Fig. 5c). The temperature on the foam surface increased from 30 to 37 °C within 180 s of illumination and then, it increased further to 45 °C within 1 h. In contrast, pure water with solar irradiation showed weak improvement in the water temperature. The insets in Fig. 5c are IR images of the beaker with solar irradiation times of 0 s, 180 s, and 60 min. Moreover, after 1 h of solar irradiation, the side-view IR thermal images of the beakers with and without CM foam showed significant differences in temperature profiles (Fig. 5d). For the beaker without the foam, a homogeneous water temperature profile is presented. In contrast, the beaker with self-floating foams showed a larger temperature gradient with a contrasting “hot-zone” on the water interface, indicating that the CM foam can intensively gather solar radiation at the water interface.
The solar steam generation performance and energy conversion efficiency of foams were calculated by measuring the weight change of water under one solar irradiation (1000 W m−2) in beakers. The time-dependent weight change profiles of water under different conditions are demonstrated in Fig. 5e. The solar steam generation capacities of foam were reflected by their evaporation rates, calculated from the slopes of the weight change curves. Because of the open-cell porous structures and larger evaporating areas of the foams, the intrinsic evaporation abilities of the CF and CM foams were 0.156 and 0.182 kg m−2 h−1, respectively, which were higher than that of the pure water (0.091 kg m−2 h−1). With the irradiation of 1 kW m−2 light, the evaporation rates of the CF and CM foams were calculated to be 1.203 and 1.458 kg m−2 h−1, respectively, which were 2.5 and 3.0 times that of pure water (0.481 kg m−2 h−1); additionally, the solar thermal energy conversion efficiencies were calculated to be 74.2% and 90.4% under only 1 sun irradiation, respectively. The conversion efficiency of CM foam was superior as compared to those of most hydrophobic self-floating materials (Table S3†), and it was also comparable with those of the state-of-the-art ones (Table S4†). The higher conversion efficiency of CM foam might be mainly due to the large 3D macropores for steam transport, hydrophobicity and low density for localized heating as well as the loading of photo-responsive MoS2 nanoparticles. Moreover, the CM foam showed stable performance in solar steam generation over 15 cycles with 3600 s irradiation for each cycle (Fig. S12†), suggesting the outstanding cycling stability of the device.
The current facile strategy for the preparation of the self-floating photothermal device via one-pot annealing is suitable for practical and scalable applications. To demonstrate the flexibility of CM foam for steam generation, a simulated all-in-one device (Fig. S13†), the prototype of which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6, was manually fabricated with lab-available materials. The device consisted of a piece of light transparent cling film, a tailored plastic dropper as an upholder, and two beakers (10 mL and 100 mL). The cling film and 100 mL beaker were simply connected by a bungee. The 10 mL beaker, regarded as the evaporation chamber, was filled with saline water and two small pieces of CM foam, which can spontaneously float on the surface of the saline water. Under light illumination, the saline water in the small beaker evaporated, and the vaporized water then condensed on the cling film and gathered at the bottom of 100 mL beaker (applied as condensing chamber or impounding reservoir). As such, ≈0.9 g of water condensate could be collected after 2 h exposure to 1 sun irradiation. In contrast, the same device without CM foam could only collect ≈0.07 g of water after 2 h exposure to 1 sun irradiation. Also, the photothermal foam was quite stable even after long-term solar exposure (over 100 h). These results highlight the great potential of the CM foam for practical applications such as in point-of-use freshwater extraction for emergency drinking water shortages.

Conclusions
In summary, we proposed a bio-inspired and versatile nano-fixation principle via the co-annealing process to prepare functional hybrid foams with large 3D porous structures for practical applications with enhanced performance such as solar steam generation. Nano-fixation promises the formation of foam with extensive 3D porous networks for steam transport, low density and good hydrophobicity for material self-floating at the water–air interface as well as heat localization. Finally, the all-in-one CM foam exhibited a high water evaporation rate of 1.458 kg m−2 h−1 and 90.4% energy conversion efficiency under 1 sun illumination (1 kW m−2). Additionally, the foam provided superior practical functionality over many conventional photothermal devices including those using selective oil adsorption and blocking of water leakage. Therefore, the facilely prepared melamine foam-derived steam generator holds great promise for the settlement of energy and environmental crisis. Moreover, the novel nano-fixation principle shows good universality in guiding the preparation of other functional foams and would find a variety of applications beyond solar steam generation.
Experimental section
Materials
Melamine foam (MF) was purchased from the Ledian Co., Ltd. and washed with ethanol prior to use. (NH4)2MoS4 (ATTM, 99.97%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received without further purification.
Characterizations
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted by an Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV).38 S-4800 (Hitachi, Japan) was used for obtaining field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using the Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer System.39 The BET surface areas of the foams were measured on Micromeritics Tristar II 3020. The sessile drop method was applied to measure the water contact angle under ∼30% humidity using a contact angle instrument (JY-PHa, Chengde). Raman spectra were recorded by a LabRAM ARAMIS Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). To accurately determine the porosities of foams, mercury porosimetry was conducted with a porosimeter (AutoPore IV 9500, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation).
Synthesis of foams
For the synthesis of CF foam, the ethanol-washed and tailored MF foam was carbonized in a tube furnace under Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 4 °C min−1. For CM foam, the tailored MF was first immersed into an ATTM solution of 5 mg mL−1, followed by drying in a vacuum oven. The ATTM-loaded MF foam was then pyrolyzed at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 4 °C min−1 under argon atmosphere. The as-prepared CM was then cooled to room temperature. AuNP-loaded carbon foam was synthesized by pyrolyzing HAuCl4-soused melamine foam at 600 °C for 2 h. Mo2C and Fe/Fe3C-loaded foams were prepared via the pyrolysis of (NH4)6Mo7O24 and Fe(NO3)2-loaded melamine foams, respectively, at 700 °C for 2 h.
Estimation of energy conversion
The energy conversion efficiency (η) of foam from solar energy to thermal energy was simply calculated using eqn (1): (1)here, QO is the output energy defined as power density of water evaporation, QI is the power density of the input light source (1000 W m−2), m is the water evaporation rate, and h is the total enthalpy of sensible heat (294 kJ kg−1, from 30 to 100 °C with a specific heat of 4.2 J g−1 K−1) and vaporization of water (2257 kJ kg−1). To precisely evaluate the energy conversion efficiency, the evaporation rates of water in darkness were deducted from all the corresponding evaporation rates measured under solar irradiation.
