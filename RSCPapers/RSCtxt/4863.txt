    , Accepted 5th December 2011First published on 4th January 2012AbstractTwo novel conjugated copolymers based on alkylbenzotriazole and benzothiadiazole with high electron affinities are investigated for applications in polymer field-effect transistors and solar cells. The electron withdrawing nature of these polymers allows for efficient electron injection and transport. We were able to realize ambipolar red light-emitting field-effect transistors with electron mobilities exceeding 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 using gold electrodes. All-polymer solar cells with open-circuit voltages larger than 1.2 V using the new polymers as electron acceptor are also demonstrated.
Introduction

Conjugated polymers have attracted broad attention as semiconducting materials in optoelectronic devices such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and solar cells. Due to their advantages of being solution-processable and compatible with flexible substrates, they offer great application potential. Whilst the performance of hole-transporting conjugated polymers has advanced rapidly over the past years, the number of high-performance electron-transporting materials has grown less rapidly. One of the main difficulties in this case is to synthesize conjugated polymers with suitably high electron affinities in order to allow efficient electron injection and transport stability.1–5 In particular, Suzuki polycondensation has been limited in its ability to produce electron accepting polymers due to the difficulties of recovering high-purity diboronic acids of electron-accepting arenes. We have recently reported the successful synthesis of electron accepting polymers by Suzuki polycondensation by using bis(trifluoroborate) functionalized monomers.6 This methodology has allowed us to synthesize a range of novel electron withdrawing polymers, such as copolymers based on alkylbenzotriazole and benzothiadiazole. Here we investigate the performance of two of these novel conjugated polymers in OFETs and solar cells. Their detailed synthesis is described elsewhere.6 In addition to their potential as electron transporters with comparably high mobilities in n-type OFETs, the two materials are useful for ambipolar light-emitting OFETs due to their relatively low bandgap and high photoluminescence efficiency. Moreover, they show promising performance as electron acceptors in polymer:polymer solar cells.

        OFET and solar cell performance
We compare the regular copolymer of alkylbenzotriazole and benzothiadiazole (P1) with a statistical copolymer of alkylbenzotriazole - benzothiadiazole and alkylbenzotriazole and bithiophene (P2). The chemical structures and energy levels of the two conjugated polymers are shown in Fig. 1(a). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy was determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) using an AC-2 Spectrometer (Riken Keiki), whilst the position of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was estimated using the energy of the edge of the corresponding absorption spectrum, plotted in Fig. 1(b). Using this approximation, relatively high electron affinities, and thus deep LUMO levels, of 3.4 ± 0.05 eV and 3.15 ± 0.05 eV are estimated for P1 and P2, respectively. These values make them of interest for the use as electron acceptor in all-polymer solar cells with the established donor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Furthermore, the relatively high electron affinities are favorable for good electron injection in OFETs using high-workfunction air-stable electrodes.

Also shown for their use in solar cells are the energy levels and the absorption spectrum of P3HT.2 Schematics of the utilized top gate/bottom contact OFET and solar cell architectures (both on glass substrates) are shown in (c) and (d). 
This allows using a top gate/bottom contact architecture with photolithographically patterned gold source/drain electrodes (30 nm thin) and a 550 nm thick poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or polystyrene (PS) gate dielectric, as well as a 10 nm thin semi-transparent gold gate electrode, illustrated in Fig. 1(c). P1 (Mn = 120k, Mw/Mn = 1.5) and P2 (Mn = 29k, Mw/Mn = 1.8) films were spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution (10 g l−1). As illustrated in Fig. 1(d), the solar cells were fabricated on ITO-coated glass covered with a thin (∼60 nm) layer of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonic acid). P3HT:P1/P2 solutions with a 1:1 weight ratio (P3HT: Rieke Metals, RR∼98%, Mw < 50000) were spin-coated from chlorobenzene and 2.5 vol.% 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) as co-solvent, yielding a layer thickness of 80–90 nm. The solar cells were completed with the evaporation of 100 nm aluminium as top electrode. All devices were fabricated in nitrogen atmosphere; solar cells were encapsulated.

Fig. 2 demonstrates the ambipolar charge transport properties by showing the output characteristics of PMMA-gated OFETs using P1 and P2. In these plots the dependence of the drain current Id on the drain voltage Vd is shown for a set of fixed gate voltages Vg. Whereas the electron transport characteristics for positive drain and gate voltages are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b) for P1 and P2, respectively, Fig. 2(c) and (d) show the hole transport characteristics for negative drain and gate voltages. The superlinear increase for low drain voltages in all cases is attributed to contact resistance, mainly due to the injection barrier into both the LUMO and HOMO level of the polymers using gold electrodes. Nevertheless, clean ambipolar charge transport with little hysteresis is achieved.
 Fig. 2  Output characteristics of PMMA-gated P1 and P2 ambipolar OFETs (L = 20 μm, W = 2 cm). The electron transport characteristics of P1 and P2 are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. The corresponding hole transport characteristics are shown in (c) and (d). 
To evaluate the charge transport properties quantitatively, the transfer characteristics of the respective P1 and P2 OFETs in Fig. 3(a) and (b) are analyzed. The curves plotting the dependence of the drain current Id on the gate voltage Vg for a given drain voltage Vd confirm that the two polymers yield reasonably well-balanced ambipolar charge transport without the need for low-workfunction metals. From the P1 transfer curve in Fig. 3(a) a relatively high (considering that these polymers are amorphous) electron mobility of μe = 3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 is extracted. Furthermore, a hole mobility of μh = 4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 is found. The corresponding threshold voltages are extracted to be Vth,e = 67 V and Vth,h = −57 V. As can be seen in the figure, the best performance is achieved for an annealing temperature of 290 °C, whereas annealing below the glass transition at 120 °C leads to about one order of magnitude lower mobilities. This behavior can be explained by the fact that the thermogravimetric analysis of P1 reveals a slight weight loss starting at around 230 °C,6 which is attributed to the removal of trapped solvent molecules. For P2 electron and hole mobilities are found to be of μe = 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh = 7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for annealing temperatures of 120 °C. A higher annealing temperature in this case leads to a reduction of the hole mobility by a factor of 5. Despite the slightly lower mobilities in P2, higher ambipolar currents are achieved due to low threshold voltages (Vth,e = 46 V, Vth,h = −34 V), which is of importance for strong light emission.7 Without losing the ability to use photolithography for source–drain patterning, the electron thresholds could be reduced further using zinc oxide as electron injection layer.8
 Fig. 3  Transfer characteristics of PMMA-gated P1 and P2 ambipolar OFETs (L = 20 μm, W = 2 cm). The respective curves for both materials with annealing below (120 °C) and above (290 °C) glass transition temperature are shown in (a) and (b). (c) Images of the light emission within the recombination zone of P1 and P2 OFETs. (d) Transfer characteristics of PS-gated OFETs based on P1 and P2 (L = 20 μm, W = 2 cm). 
Owing to their photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of about 8% and 12%, respectively, P1 and P2 emit red (and partly near-infrared) light in the ambipolar regime for intermediate gate voltages. Fig. 3(c) shows the visible light emission within the recombination zone of P1 and P2 OFETs. This zone tends to be close to the hole injecting electrode in P1 OFETs because of the significantly higher electron mobility, but it could be moved easily throughout the channel in case of P2 due to the more balanced transport.
By reducing the dipolar disorder at the active interface9 using PS as gate insulator with lower dielectric constant, the electron mobilities of the two polymers can be further enhanced. Electron mobilities of up to μe = 2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, deduced from the transfer curves in Fig. 3(d), can be achieved for P1 and P2, respectively. However, it is to be mentioned that in this case the threshold voltages are also larger. As a conclusion of the OFET characteristics it can be stated that particularly P1 demonstrates its capability as high-mobility electron transporter, whilst P2 is promising in ambipolar light-emitting OFETs due to the high ambipolar currents.
Despite the recent rapid progress in the performance of polymer:fullerene blends there is strong interest in finding new electron accepting polymers for solar cell applications which could lead to improved absorption and better energy level tuning to maximize the open-circuit voltage. The polymers presented here are of interest as they can potentially overcome the problem of poorly balanced electron and hole mobilities in polymer:polymer solar cells.10,11 Electron mobilities on the order of 10−3–10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, as seen in P1 and P2, allow for balanced electron and hole mobilities when blended with P3HT and prevent the build-up of space charge. Furthermore, both polymers have a small bandgap of 2.00 eV in the case of P1 and 1.85 eV for P2, desirable for photovoltaic applications (Fig. 1 (b)).
In Fig. 4, the external quantum efficiency spectra for both P3HT:P1 (a) and P3HT:P2 (b) are displayed. For the P3HT:P1 blend, an EQE of 6% is observed. Upon addition of 2.5 vol.% ODT to the solution,12 the EQE increases to 9.5%. ODT addition is even more beneficial for P3HT:P2 blends, where the EQE increases from 2% to 9%. The solar cell current–voltage curves of P3HT:P1 and P3HT:P2, acquired under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G mismatch corrected illumination, are shown in Fig. 4(c). Both blends exhibit high open circuit voltages of 1.08 V and 1.23 V for P1 and P2, respectively. These values are comparable to P3HT:F8TBT and P3HT:F8BT devices13 and only 0.2 V lower than the highest reported so far.14 The short-circuit current Jsc is found to be between 0.82 mA cm−2 for P2 and 0.95 mA cm−2 for P1. Power conversion efficiencies of 0.31% (P3HT:P1) and 0.24% (P3HT:P2) are obtained, exceeding efficiencies of P3HT:F8BT15 and P3HT:F8TBT without thermal annealing13 and that of blends of P3HT and poly{[N,N9-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,59-(2,29-bithiophene) (P(NDI2OD-T2)). Interestingly, it is found that the performance of the P3HT:P1/P2 blends exhibits its maximum for as-spun rather than annealed films.

We observe significant dependence of the photocurrent on electric field, i.e., the photocurrent continues to increase with increasing reverse bias voltage, leading to a low fill factor.11,16 The fact that the measured short circuit currents are considerably lower than the theoretical values of 1.28 mA cm−2 for P1 and 1.33 mA cm−2 for P2 estimated by integrating the EQE data in Fig. 4(a) and (b) suggests significant non-geminate recombination losses due to non-optimized morphology and/or field-enhanced charge generation at the heterojunction. Further investigation of the photophysics is needed, and there is clearly room for further improvement in device performance by optimizing blend morphology and device structure.
Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that novel high electron-affinity conjugated polymers can be used as high-performance electron transporting materials in n-type/ambipolar (light-emitting) OFETs as well as in all-polymer solar cells. These results confirm that the targeted synthesis of electron-transporting conjugated polymers derived from bis(trifluoroborate) monomers can yield substantial improvements in the performance of polymer-based optoelectronic devices.
