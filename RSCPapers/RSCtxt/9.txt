    , Accepted 7th September 2021First published on 18th September 2021AbstractSelf-assembled surface nanoscale structures on various ZnO facets are excellent templates for the deposition of semiconductor quantum dots and manipulation with surface optical transparency. In this work, we have modified the surface of c-, m- and a-plane ZnO single-crystals by high-energy W-ion irradiation with an energy of 27 MeV to observe the aspects of surface morphology on the optical properties. We kept ion fluences in the range from 5 × 109 cm−2 to 5 × 1011 cm−2 using the mode of single-ion implantation and the overlapping impact mode to see the effect of various regimes on surface modification. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy in the channeling mode (RBS-C) and Raman spectroscopy have identified a slightly growing Zn-sublattice disorder in the irradiated samples with a more significant enhancement for the highest irradiation fluence. Simultaneously, the strong suppression of the main Raman modes and the propagation of the modes corresponding to polar Zn–O vibrations indicate disorder mainly in the O-sublattice in non-polar facets. The surface morphology, analysed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), shows significant changes after ion irradiation. The c- and a-plane ZnO exhibit the formation of small grains on the surface. The m-plane ZnO forms a sponge-like surface for lower fluences and grains for the highest fluence. The surface roughness itself increases with the irradiation fluence as shown by AFM measurement as well as spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) analysis. The damage caused by high-energy irradiation leads to non-radiative processes and suppression of the near-band-edge peak as well as the deep-level emission peak in the photoluminescence spectra. Furthermore, the refraction index n and the extinction coefficient k of irradiated samples, determined by SE, have features corresponding to the particular exciton states blurred and are slightly lower in the optical bandgap region especially for the polar c-plane ZnO facet.
Introduction
Swift heavy-ion (SHI) irradiation has become an attractive method of nanomaterial design and nanostructure fabrication. Examples of SHI modification include the shaping of nanoparticles, the elongation of their lateral dimension, and ion-track engineering, where the impact of SHIs may be used for the modification of optical properties or the fabrication of waveguides applied in optics and bionics.1–3 The SHI irradiation process is specific because of the prevailing ion interaction with the solid matter with the prevalence of electron-stopping powers (the energy lost per unit length of the trajectory Se = (−dE/dz) due to electron excitation). For SHI, the electron-stopping powers are typically above the value of the threshold for latent track formation, which is in the range of 15–36 keV nm−1 for most of the related crystalline materials such as GaN, GaAs and Si.4,5 The large energy transfer through electron–phonon coupling causes significant material heating described by the thermal spike model. A thermal spike occurs within the picosecond time scale and results in localised melting and causes partial re-crystallisation or matrix amorphisation along the ion path. These amorphous ion tracks, several nm in diameter, exhibit a difference in interaction with light in contrast to the bulk crystal, variation in refractive index and change in light absorption.6 At the sample surface, a large amount of kinetic energy is rapidly transferred from the thermal spike to the material, causing an outburst of knock-out near-surface atoms. This leads to the modification of surface morphology on a nanometric scale, a change in surface roughness and the creation of nano-hillocks, craters with a wide range of diameters from 15 nm up to several hundreds of nm or rippled surfaces.7 The stopping power limits for surface modification are usually lower than for ion track creation and are connected to the threshold for thermal spike formation. The threshold for the energetic stopping limits in crystals for surface nano-hillock creation was estimated as follows: for Al2O3 about 10 keV nm−1, for MgO about 15 keV nm−1 and for ZnO crystal about 6.42 keV nm−1.8,9
Heavy-ion surface patterning is usually used to enhance an effective surface area, prepare surfaces of particular shapes and specify pattern periodicity,10,11 which leads to the tailoring of optical properties of semiconductors.12,13 It has been possible to obtain diverse types of self-organised periodic surface structures such as nanodot arrays, nanoholes, hillocks and ripples through ion bombardment of solids realised at a normal or grazing-incidence angle.14,15 Simultaneously, the impact of single-ion implantation on the nanostructuring of crystalline semiconductors (Si, SiC, ZnO) is prospective in the control of the creation of a particular defect, functionalised deep-level impurities, or the formation of single centres with possible application in quantum computing.1,16,17
Generally, ZnO functionalization can be realized by incorporation of additional dopants to the crystal structure, e.g. by introducing an additional precursor during the growth of a crystal or doping by ion implantation, when the change of final ZnO properties results from the direct interaction of ZnO matrix and dopant.18,19 Furthermore, manipulation with the intensity and position of photoluminescence peaks can be achieved by introducing additional crystal defects (vacancies or interstitials) through an irradiation process or by ZnO nanostructuring (e.g. preparation of ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods).20–23
As already shown, nanostructured ZnO surfaces with a larger effective surface area can enhance the photocatalytic activity and therefore significantly improve the sensing properties of ZnO,24,25 and may affect other optoelectronic devices such as surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices26 or solar cells, as presented in ref. 27. Therefore, ZnO surfaces intentionally modified with nanocrystals are extensively studied.
The ion irradiation process excels with high material purity due to the absence of additional precursors and chemical reactants. The surfaces of ZnO films and single crystals have already been successfully modified by the use of pulsed lasers or ion bombardment.28,29 Uniformly distributed nano-hillocks have been prepared on the relatively smooth surface of ZnO films by Au-ion irradiation with an energy of 75 MeV as a consequence of the energy transfer of a thermal spike.8 It has been proved that a ZnO single crystal nano-rippled by Ar-ion bombardment exhibits a certain level of optical damage and a change in optical constants.30 However, the origin of the optical signature of crystalline ZnO surface structures induced by SHI surface patterning is not completely understood.
Furthermore, current focus is given to the nanostructuring of polar c-plane ZnO facets, however, this facet exhibits spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization which may decrease the device efficiency caused by spatial separation of electrons and holes. This can be eliminated by the use of non-polar ZnO facets.31,32 Distinct radiation resistance and damage accumulation asymmetry have been shown for various ZnO facets modified by low-, medium- and high-energy ion irradiation33–35 as well as the influence of ZnO crystallographic facets on the synthesis of surface nanostructures observed in the case of SHI Au-ion surface nanostructuring.36 The aim of this work is the modification of particular ZnO facets caused by SHI in the low ion-fluence mode, where the impact of individual ions is expected. The surfaces of polar and non-polar ZnO crystallographic facets were modified by high-energy ion irradiation with heavy transition metals (W). The heavy ions are more appropriate for sufficient surface modification. Furthermore, transition metals can contribute to the optical characteristics due to their partly filled inner shell causing intra-shell transition and interaction with the host matrix and its defects which may induce a change in bandgap energy, shift in the luminescence peak or even modify the magnetic properties.18,37 Emphasis should be given to the investigation of the surface structure effect on the luminescence properties and light absorption and/or refraction in the context of a particular defect created by the SHI irradiation process.
Experiment
Hydrothermally grown single-crystalline ZnO substrates were purchased from the company Crystal GmbH in Germany. An experiment was performed using ZnO substrates (10 × 10 × 1 mm3) with three different crystallographic facets, one of which was polar, namely c-plane (0001), and two non-polar: a-plane (11–20) and m-plane (10–10). All samples were irradiated by heavy, energetic W8+ ions produced by a Tandetron tandem accelerator using a maximum terminal voltage of 3 MV. Irradiation was carried out at 7° in an off-axis mode to minimise the channelling effect and enhance surface modification.
The low ion fluence, set in a range from 5 × 109 to 5 × 1011 cm−2, was kept in a mode close to single-ion irradiation for the lowest ion fluence and overlapping impacts at the highest ion fluence to synthesise surface nanostructures. The estimated impact on an average area of 1 × 1 μm2 is 50 atoms for the fluence of 5 × 109 cm−2 (single-ion impact regime), where collision cascades of two neighbouring ions are far enough to consider them independent and an expected modification is strictly on a nano-scale. For the fluences of 5 × 1010 cm−2 and 5 × 1011 cm−2, it is 10 times and 100 times more, respectively. In this case, the collision cascades of ions can overlap (overlapping regime) and may enhance modification and creation of larger structures. To keep the ion fluence in a single-ion irradiation mode, the ion-beam current had to be precisely controlled during the ion irradiation. The irradiation system was accompanied by a movable Faraday cup and electronics adapted for the measurement of low currents from several fA up to several nA. The stability of the beam current was measured approximately half an hour before the ion irradiation itself and immediately after the irradiation, which took several minutes.
The energy of W8+ was set to 27 MeV when the electron-stopping powers were determined as 8 keV nm−1 in the surface region according to SRIM38 simulations. The SRIM software based on Monte Carlo calculations provides the full damage cascade simulation of the ion path depicted in Fig. 1a and the calculation of electron and nuclear stopping powers shown in Fig. 1b. It can be expected that the electron-stopping threshold for continuous latent track formation by SHI in crystalline ZnO will be higher or comparable to the values given for similar GaN (15 keV nm−1).4 Nevertheless, the surface modification can be achieved even with electron-stopping energies below this threshold.8,39

In the subsurface region, energetic ions maintain a straight trajectory with a lower number of recoils corresponding to the modification mainly by processes that are connected to the ion interaction with electrons via ionisation; on the other hand, the deeper-buried layer (projected range of ions 3.75 μm) is dominated by nuclear stopping powers and therefore accompanied by a dense collision cascade.
Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy in the channelling mode (RBS-C) was utilised for structural characterisation in the subsurface region using a He+ ion beam with an energy of 2 MeV with information depth up to 1.2 μm. The overall information about the structural changes after ion irradiation was provided by Raman spectroscopy to study the response of Zn and O sublattice to accumulated disorder. Surface-morphology modification and nanostructuring were followed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The grain size distributions were evaluated by the processing of AFM images. The segmentation of images to grain shaped motifs was realized through thresholding algorithms and the sizes of these motifs correspond to the size of particular grains.
Raman spectroscopy has been performed at room temperature using a Renishaw InVia Raman confocal microscope with a Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) beam focused on the sample surface with a penetration depth of approximately 0.5 μm. The laser beam spot size about 2 μm in diameter has been applied in the measurement. The output power was 50 mW. The detection of Raman spectra was carried out with a 100× objective and a TE-cooled CCD camera. The change in surface morphology was investigated by an Integra (NT-MDT) atomic force microscope in tapping mode. The measurement was implemented with diamond probes with a resonant frequency of 190–325 kHz and a spring constant of 5.5–22.5 N m−1.
The analysis of the optical response of the single-crystalline ZnO before and after modification by heavy energetic ions was conducted using micro-photoluminescence and spectroscopy ellipsometry. The micro-photoluminescence spectra were collected with an InVia Raman confocal microscope as well by means of a HeCd laser (325 nm, 22 mW) and detected with a TE-cooled CCD camera using a 20× NUV-long working distance objective. The analysed depth was close to 0.5 μm. The ellipsometry spectra were acquired in the range of 0.7–6.5 eV by a VASE ellipsometer (Woollam). The angle of incidence spanned the broad interval of 40°–80° to analyse the optical anisotropy of both pristine and irradiated ZnO surfaces. The penetration depth varies with the energy of the light used for measurement from several μm for energies below the ZnO bandgap (3.2 eV), up to several nm for energies above the bandgap. Non-polar a- and m-plane facets, with the optical axis lying in-plane, were measured in two sample orientations, where the optical axis was parallel and perpendicular with respect to the incidence plane, respectively. This enabled the determination of both ordinary and extraordinary complex refractive indices. The measurements on the polar c-plane facet, with the optical axis perpendicular to the surface, provided only average optical constants. In addition to the ellipsometry data, reflectance spectra were recorded for nearly normal incidence (with the same instrument) and both were analysed simultaneously by WVASE32 software. Since the backside of the samples was grounded, only a single interface (sample surface) was considered in numerical data treatment. ZnO dielectric function was parameterised by Tanguy40 and three Gauss oscillators to cover excitonic and interband electronic transitions in ZnO.
Results
Structural characterisation by RBS-C and Raman spectroscopy
RBS-C results do not exhibit significant modification in the subsurface region up to 1.38 μm (Fig. 2a–c) for any of the ZnO facets used. The slight crystal damage corresponds to the modification by energetic ions in the prevailing electron-stopping mode with a low-density collision cascade. However, the asymmetry between the facets used is evident even from the RBS-C spectra. The a-plane ZnO shows the highest resistivity due to radiation damage represented by a minimum change in the yield of backscattered ions measured by RBS-C for all the irradiation fluences used. In contrast to the a-plane ZnO, the radiation resistance of the m-plane ZnO is weaker33,34 and the yield of backscattered ions slightly increases even after irradiation with the lowest fluence of 5 × 109 cm−2. The modification of c-plane ZnO is appreciable mainly after irradiation with the highest fluence of 5 × 1011 cm−2. For the lower fluences, only a slight change in backscattered-ion yields has been observed.

Furthermore, we investigated the normalised minimum yield as a feature providing information about the Zn-sublattice disorder. The normalised yield χmin has been determined from the RBS-C spectra as the ratio between aligned and random yield in the region of interest between the 100–620 channel, which corresponds to the depth of 1.38 μm investigated by RBS with a 2 MeV He+ ion beam and is summarised in Table 1. The χmin in the channel range of 100–620 has been determined for pristine samples as well. Channelling in depth is influenced by additional effects such as multi-scattering; the dechannelling effect in higher depths is thus more pronounced, as a result of which the normalised yields for the pristine samples evaluated in the whole region of interest are higher than generally reported values determined in a region just beyond the surface peak, which should be for pristine samples around 3–4%.41,42 The χmin analysis confirmed the lowest increase of Zn-sublattice disorder in a-plane ZnO crystals observed also in ref. 36. For lower irradiation fluences, the χmin values remain nearly the same as for the pristine sample and the difference is in the range of the measurement uncertainty. For the highest fluence, the χmin values increase from 7.8 up to 10.1% in a-plane ZnO. The normalised yield in the region of interest of m-plane ZnO is higher than 19% even for the lowest fluence of 5 × 109 cm−2 and gradually increases with W-ion irradiation fluence, which represents the highest Zn-atom disorder induced by W-ion irradiation from all the crystallographic orientations studied. In the case of c-plane ZnO, the change in χmin is negligible for the lowest fluence. A further increase of the ion irradiation fluence leads to the enhancement of the normalised yield from 6.8% (pristine) to 9.8% and 11.7% for the fluences of 5 × 1010 cm−2 and 5 × 1011 cm−2, respectively.

ZnO crystallises in a wurtzite structure, which has several main peaks in the Raman spectra as shown in Fig. 3a–c. The most intensive modes, Ehigh2 and Elow2, situated at 100 and 430 cm−1, are connected to the vibration state of the non-polar bonds of O and Zn sublattices, respectively. Their intensity is strongly affected by changes in the crystal structure and reflects the crystal quality. Furthermore, the wurtzite ZnO shows a doubly-degenerate 2E2 mode at 203 cm−1 and a mode referred to as (Ehigh2–Elow2) at 330 cm−1, which is assigned to the second-order Raman scattering. In the case of non-polar (m- and a-plane) ZnO facets (Fig. 3b and c), the polarity of Zn–O bonding induces the propagation of A1 and E1 modes split into the longitudinal and transversal modes A1(TO), E1(TO) at 375 and 410 cm−1, and A1(LO), E1(LO) at 540 cm−1 and 575 cm−1, respectively. The A1 and E1 modes are highly sensitive to intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials directed along the basal plane for the A1 mode and perpendicular to the basal plane for E1.43,44
 Fig. 3  The Raman spectra of ZnO samples irradiated with W8+ ions with an energy of 27 MeV for (a) c-plane, (b) m-plane and (c) a-plane ZnO. 
Overall, the Raman spectra of the c-plane ZnO samples do not show a significant modification of the Ehigh2 and Elow2 peaks caused by the W-ion irradiation. It is clear from Fig. 3a that the lowest fluence does not cause any difference in the spectra of the irradiated sample in comparison to the pristine c-plane ZnO. Higher W-ion irradiation fluence (5 × 1010 cm−2) supports the propagation of A1(LO) and E1(LO) modes, whose intensity increases with further enhancement of the W-ion irradiation fluence.
Additionally, a significant decrease of Ehigh2 and Elow2 is accompanied by distinct structural modification in non-polar ZnO facets. The irradiation of m-plane ZnO with the lowest fluence does not lead to a change in Raman spectra, but the enhancement of irradiation fluence results in the gradual lowering of both E2 modes. The irradiation with the highest fluence also results in the appearance of A1(LO) and E1(LO) modes. The Raman spectrum of the a-plane ZnO irradiated with the fluence of 5 × 109 cm−2, presented in Fig. 3c, is not affected by the W-ion irradiation. However, the spectra of the modified a-plane ZnO above this fluence exhibit a rapid reduction of E2 modes with the rise of A1(LO) and E1(LO) modes.
Surface morphology
The irradiation effect on the surface morphology of ZnO crystals and the surface roughness have been estimated using 3 × 3 μm2 AFM scans. The surface roughness has been determined with the root mean square (RMS) of the surface height distribution.

Fig. 4a–d show the AFM images of the pristine and irradiated c-plane ZnO, whereas Fig. 5a–d show the AFM images of the pristine and irradiated a-plane ZnO. The irradiation effect is evident. The pristine sample shows a low surface roughness of 0.74 nm without any significant formations, only a slight porosity is observed being evidenced already before on the hydrothermally grown ZnO crystalline facets.46 The W-ion irradiation does not lead to a rapid change in surface roughness since for the lowest irradiation fluence the RMS parameter slightly increases to the value of 1.38 nm. For the highest irradiation fluence, the RMS parameter is estimated as 5.84 nm. However, the W-ion irradiation shows the impact on the surface morphology and causes the formation of grains. The fluence 5 × 109 cm−2 should correspond to the single ion implantation regime, where the damage caused by particular ions is separated. The single ion impact in c-plane ZnO shown in Fig. 4b indicates a low density of present grains, which seem to be separated from each other. A further increase of the irradiation fluence leads to the enhancement of grain density and its overlap. For the highest fluence (5 × 1011 cm−2), shown in Fig. 4d (overlapping ion-implantation mode), it seems that the density of the present grains is high enough to create a nearly continuous rough layer with objects reaching the heights of several dozens of nm. The higher the irradiation fluence, the broader the grain-size distribution (see Fig. 4) and the higher the portion of grains with a larger diameter.

 Fig. 5  A comparison of AFM 2D images for a-plane ZnO (a) pristine and irradiated with the fluences of (b) 5 × 1010 cm−2 and (c) 5 × 1011 cm−2 and extracted corresponding grain-size distributions of the samples irradiated using the following fluences (d) 5 × 1010 cm−2 and (e) 5 × 1011 cm−2. 
The roughness and surface morphology of a-plane ZnO are similar to c-plane ZnO. However, the morphology evolution is not as progressive with the W-ion fluence as in c-plane ZnO. The formation of separated grains starts with the fluence of 5 × 1010 cm−2 (see Fig. 5b) and even the highest irradiation fluence does not support formation of grains enough to create a completely compact layer. The RMS parameter seems to be increasingly less progressive in comparison to c-plane ZnO; nevertheless, in general, the RMS values reached are comparable, especially for the highest fluence. Looking at the distribution of the grain sizes, the a-plane ZnO irradiated with the fluence of 5 × 1010 cm−2 forms mostly small grains. The higher irradiation fluence leads to the broadening of the grain-size distribution and its shift to higher values for a-plane ZnO crystals.
The non-polar m-plane ZnO surfaces (see Fig. 6a–c) exhibit the highest level of surface modification. Even the surface roughness of the pristine sample (RMS = 1.82 nm) is higher than in the case of c-plane and a-plane ZnO. Irradiation leads to a rapid increase in surface roughness; for the highest fluence, it reaches RMS = 10.07 nm.
 Fig. 6  A comparison of AFM 2D images for m-plane ZnO (a) pristine and irradiated with the fluences of (b) 5 × 1010 cm−2 and (c) 5 × 1011 cm−2 and extracted corresponding grain-size distributions of the samples irradiated using the following fluences (d) 5 × 1010 cm−2 and (e) 5 × 1011 cm−2. 
From the AFM results, it seems that m-plane ZnO is much more modified than both previous crystallographic orientations. Simultaneously, the surface morphology is different for the m-plane ZnO facet, and the lower fluences represent a more sponge-like network with the nuclei of emerging grains (Fig. 6b), which is converted to the fully grainy pattern for the sample irradiated with the highest fluence (Fig. 6c). The m-plane ZnO surfaces exhibit more progressive modification by ion bombardment, as already observed in ref. 36. The specific m-plane structure can be a result of the aggregation of smaller defects supported by energy transfer from highly energetic W8+ ions; therefore, it can form a sponge-like network of grain clusters. The m-plane ZnO shows the widest grain-size distribution for the lower as well as higher W-ion irradiation fluence with the grain diameters reaching 100 nm.
Optical characterisation
The spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was used to investigate the surface roughness and mainly the optical constants, such as the refractive index n and the extinction coefficient k, and modifications before and after the W-ion irradiation. Wurtzite ZnO is a uniaxial optically anisotropic material whose optical properties are described by ordinary and extraordinary complex refractive indices (n − ik).47
However, the evaluation of ordinary and extraordinary optical constants for c-plane ZnO crystals is not easy because of the orientation of the optical axis that is perpendicular with respect to the c-plane.48 Therefore, the SE results for c-plane ZnO show only effective values of n and k, which are close to the ordinary constants (see Fig. 7a). For a-plane ZnO (Fig. 7b) and m-plane ZnO, both the ordinary and extraordinary n and k values have been determined. The SE spectra for m-plane ZnO are nearly identical to the results for a-plane ZnO and they are not presented in the article.
 Fig. 7  The refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) determined from the ellipsometric measurement for (a) c-plane and (b) a-plane ZnO pristine and irradiated with 27 MeV W8+ ions with the highest fluence of 5 × 1011 cm−2. 
The penetration depth of light in ZnO depends on the photon energy. For photon energies below the ZnO optical band gap, the material is thus optically transparent and light can penetrate a depth of several μm. In this transparent region, the SE spectra (recorded in the reflected beam) are hardly affected by the W-ion irradiation process and are comparable with pristine samples. Since the projected range Rp of W8+ ions is estimated to be around 3.8 μm with the standard deviation ΔRp (0.4 μm) and the W-ion irradiation fluences used are extremely low, we did not expect the W-enriched layer to contribute to the modification of optical properties in the transparent region. However, the SE spectra of the W-ion irradiated ZnO show a clear change of n (Fig. 7a and c) as well as k (Fig. 7b and d) coefficients in the absorption region of the energies above the bandgap.
All SE spectra of the pristine samples exhibit a sharp exciton peak at about 3.3 eV, which is typical of ZnO. This peak belongs to the A, B exciton doublet, which is not resolved in room-temperature measurements, and also C exciton or exciton–phonon complexes (EPCs), located on the higher energy shoulder of the A, B doublet peak (see the indication in Fig. 7).47 These features were much less visible in the SE spectra of the irradiated samples. The exciton peaks were blurred and slightly lowered after the W-ion irradiation. This was evident mainly for the extinction coefficient of the irradiated c-plane crystal, where the slight decrease of n and k was visible for energies above 3.25 eV (see Fig. 7a). The lowering of the optical constants can be attributed to the combination of the slightly growing disorder for samples irradiated with the highest fluence and the change in surface morphology.
As shown in the literature, amorphous and polycrystalline ZnO exhibits a lower refractive index than single-crystalline ZnO.49,50 The decrease of optical constants can thus be ascribed to a dislocation of lattice atoms in the ZnO matrix caused by ion irradiation.
A similar effect has been observed for doped silicon,51 where the doping leads to the lowering and smoothening of optical n and k functions, as well as for polycrystalline and microcrystalline silicon due to amorphisation.52 The surface-morphology modification by W-ion irradiation, observed with AFM, also contributes to the ellipsometric spectra. The presence of small grains on the ZnO surface and growing roughness may change the interaction of light with the samples and modify the spectra of optical constants. This is most remarkable above the bandgap because the penetration depth for these photon energies is only a few nm. Therefore, the obtained SE data were fitted against a sample model incorporating also surface roughness using the Bruggeman effective medium approximation.53
The SE-extracted values of surface roughness show a relatively smooth surface of the pristine samples with the roughness from 2.2 nm (m-plane) up to 3.7 nm (c-plane). The SE-extracted values of surface roughness show a relatively smooth surface of the pristine samples with the roughness from 2.2 nm (m-plane) up to 3.7 nm (c-plane). W-ion irradiation leads to an increase in the surface roughness; the SE-extracted roughness values are summarised in Table 2 and compared to AFM-determined RMS parameters. The smallest surface-roughness change was observed for m-plane ZnO, where the roughness increased to the value of 3.4 nm. In the case of c- and a-plane ZnO, the roughness exceeded 6.0 nm after irradiation. The surface roughness determined from ellipsometry is not identical to that determined from AFM, but it follows the same trend of increasing roughness after irradiation.

Fig. 8 presents the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine and irradiated samples. The PL spectra of crystalline ZnO show two bands around 376 nm and 540 nm. The sharp peak at 376 nm (3.3 eV) is assigned to the exciton recombination and it is referred to as a near-band-edge (NBE) peak. The origin of green luminescence (GL) represented by a broad deep-level emission (DLE) peak at 540 nm is not completely understood yet, but it is mostly associated with native-point defects in the crystal structure mainly to oxygen (VO) and zinc (VZn) vacancies or zinc antisites (OZn).21

All crystallographic ZnO facets show a similar decreasing trend of both NBE and DLE peaks. This can be related to the stress field generated by ion-irradiation disorder in the buried layer accompanied by the relaxation of the whole crystal, resulting in a non-radiative process.21,54 The irradiation with the low fluence of 5 × 109 cm−2 leads to small changes in the intensity of the PL spectra. Moreover, the PL results for a-plane ZnO exhibit only a small reduction of the DLE peak and the NBE signal copies the intensity obtained from the pristine sample. After the W-ion irradiation with higher fluences, the PL intensities rapidly drop for all facets. In the case of the m-plane ZnO, the irradiation with the fluence of 5 × 1011 cm−2 results in a nearly complete disappearance of the NBE peak. The shift of the PL intensity maxima was not observed after irradiation with W8+ ions.
Focusing on the NBE- and DLE-peak decline, the NBE/DLE intensity ratios are summarised in Table 3. The irradiation with the fluence of 5 × 1010 cm−2 is followed by the rapid reduction of both NBE and DLE peaks, whose intensity decreases below 22% for all ZnO orientations. The most progressive decline is observed for m-plane samples, where the NBE in the sample irradiated with the fluence of 5 × 109 cm−2 drops by nearly 50% compared to the pristine sample. Furthermore, the decrease to 1% of the original intensity was observed for the highest W-ion irradiation fluence. ZnO a-plane samples are the least affected by the W-ion irradiation. The NBE peak does not exhibit any difference between the intensity of the pristine and irradiated a-plane ZnO at the lowest fluence. The DLE peak decreases by about 16%. Both NBE and DLE peaks are reduced for the samples irradiated with higher W-ion fluence; moreover, the DLE peak of a-plane ZnO is reduced more progressively than NBE. In contrast to a-plane, the DLE peak of c- and m-plane crystals decreases less progressively than NBE. The above-mentioned phenomena can be correlated to distinct radiation damage in various ZnO facets caused by the energetic W-ion irradiation.

Discussion
Polar c-plane and non-polar a- and m-plane ZnO crystals have been irradiated by highly energetic W8+ ions to study the evolution of crystal damage in the subsurface layer as well as on the surface. The used energy of W8+ ions of 27 MeV (with energy transfer via ionization on the ZnO surface being 8 keV nm−1) was confirmed to be below the limit for ion track formation, however, according to the thermal spike model, this energy is sufficient for surface modification of ZnO6,8 as it has been evidenced by AFM measurement. The structural changes in the subsurface region (up to 1 μm) analysed by RBS-C and Raman spectroscopy have shown distinct behaviour of particular ZnO crystallographic planes under ion-irradiation conditions.
From the RBS-C measurement, the Zn sublattice of a-plane ZnO seems to be less affected by the W-ion irradiation and the yield of backscattered ions significantly increases only after ion irradiation with the highest fluence in comparison to the c-plane and mainly m-plane ZnO, in the latter of which the highest normalised yield has been evidenced. However, the Raman spectra of irradiated a-plane ZnO show a significant change, mainly exhibited by the rapid reduction of Ehigh2 and the appearance of A1(LO) and E1(LO) Raman modes. Raman spectroscopy reflects molecular vibration states, which also makes it sensitive to oxygen defects, in contrast to RBS-C, where the backscattered ion dechannelling is sensitive to specific defects connected to the disorder in Zn in the sublattice, such as the deformation of the atomic rows parallel to the incoming beam. On the other hand, it is not so sensitive to defects connected to the dislocation loops in basal planes, O displacements and O-sublattice disorder. In particular, the Ehigh2-peak reduction is related to the growing disorder in the O sublattice. Furthermore, the appearance of A1(LO) and E1(LO) polar modes is mostly attributed to the presence of VO.43 Therefore, we can assume that ion irradiation causes reorganisation of the O sublattice accompanied by an increase of VO in a-plane ZnO. In the case of c-plane samples, the irradiation does not cause a significant increase in the intensity of the Ehigh2 peak, and the A1(LO) and E1(LO) polar modes appeared only after irradiation with the highest fluence. This can indicate better resistance of the O sublattice of c-plane ZnO due to radiation damage. The creation of radiation defects is closely linked to the displacement energies of particular elements. In Cowen and El-Genk,55 simulations of the threshold energies for the creation of Frenkel pairs in metal oxides predicted the crystallographic-orientation dependence of displacement energies for oxygen as well as metal atoms and thus predicted distinct defect creation in particular crystallographic planes. Consequently, particular crystallographic ZnO orientations exhibit distinct sensitivity of the Zn- and O-sublattice against the radiation damage as previously showed in ref. 34 and 36.
AFM analysis shows the distinct surface morphology of particular ZnO orientations and the increase in surface roughness. The c- as well as a-plane ZnO surfaces tend to form small grains after irradiation as a result of quick melting caused by energy transfer from the thermal spike generated by the SHI in the subsurface area.8 The density of these grains increases with W-ion irradiation fluence. It leads to the overlap of particular grains and can form a continuous layer. Irradiated m-plane ZnO surfaces show dissimilar morphology; lower irradiation fluences create a sponge-like network that could be related to the aggregation of surface defects caused by higher surface mobility supported by the irradiation process. The highest W-ion fluence causes surface self-organisation and the formation of surface grains induced by increased bombardment with highly energetic ions and therefore higher energy transfer from W8+ ions to surface atoms. The distinctive surface morphology of polar and non-polar ZnO was observed even in our previous experiment with ZnO irradiation with Au 30 MeV,36 where non-polar m-plane ZnO exposed to energetic Au ions exhibited the formation of huge mounds, in contrast to the small hillocks created on c- and a-plane ZnO surfaces. However, the sponge-like stage of the m-plane facet was not observed in that experiment and Au irradiation leads to a much more progressive change in the surface morphology. The role in different surface modification in both experiments may be attributed to the variation of atomic mass and different chemical nature of the used elements since Au ions tend to aggregate and take an interstitial position in the crystalline lattice.56 This effect can influence defect reorganization and clustering of surface atoms, especially in non-polar m-plane crystals.56
The W-ion irradiation leads to the total luminescence and reduction in both NBE and DLE peaks in PL spectra connected to the creation of non-radiative processes. Generally, the non-polar a-plane facet seems to be less affected by irradiation and the reduction of peak intensities is lower in comparison to the other facets studied.33,36 The origin of green luminescence represented by the DLE peak is still not completely understood. Nevertheless, previously reported results show that VZn is a deep acceptor with low formation energy which may be the main source of green luminescence with the maxima position at 540 nm (2.3 eV).57,58 Therefore, it can be assumed that higher PL and mainly the DLE-peak intensity of irradiated a-plane ZnO in contrast to c- and m-plane ZnO is related to the better radiation resistance of the Zn sublattice, confirmed by RBS-C. The m-plane facet shows the highest decrease of NBE- and DLE-peak intensity as well as the highest Zn-sublattice disorder in RBS-C. In our previous experiment presented in ref. 36, the Au-ion irradiation caused a strong suppression of NBE as well as DLE peaks mainly in m-plane ZnO, also observed after W-ion irradiation. Furthermore, the W-ion irradiation affects spectroscopic ellipsometry data and leads to a decrease in the optical constant and blurring of the features belonging to particular excitons of ZnO crystals irradiated with the highest fluence mainly in the region above the bandgap energies. The modification of n and k spectra may be a result of both the slightly growing disorder, observed with RBS-C, and the significant change in surface morphology. This modification is most pronounced in the polar c-plane ZnO in the whole spectra around the bandgap and the energies above. In contrast, the non-polar a- and m-plane facets are only modified in the bandgap region; for the higher photon energies n and k, the functions of irradiated samples copy the function of the pristine sample.
Conclusion
The polar c-plane and non-polar a- and m-plane facets were irradiated with 27 MeV W8+ ions with fluences varying from 5 × 109 cm−2 to 5 × 1011 cm−2 to reveal the distinct effect of single-ion impact and overlapping-ion impact.
Particular crystallographic facets exhibit a distinct defect character caused by ion irradiation. The RBS-C has shown the strong radiation resistance of the Zn sublattice of a-plane ZnO, but the rapid change in Raman spectra indicates high O-sublattice disorder and the presence of VO. The defect character plays an important role in the optical properties of ZnO as well. Despite the significant presence of O defects, the NBE and DLE photoluminescence peaks were the least reduced after the irradiation in a-plane ZnO. On the contrary, the irradiation of m-plane ZnO promotes the strongest inhibition of photoluminescence, resulting from the highest accumulation of Zn defects, as proved by RBS-C.
The AFM measurement has revealed specific nanostructuring of particular facets with energetic W8+ ions. The c- and a-plane ZnO formed small separated nano-hillocks on the surface after exposure to low irradiation fluences with single-ion impact, which tended to accumulate and grow with increasing ion impact. Furthermore, the a-plane ZnO nanostructured surfaces exhibit the narrowest grain size distributions from all studied facets, which makes the a-plane ZnO a better candidate for applications, where the precise control of surface hillocks or nanocrystal size distribution is necessary. The m-plane ZnO exhibited two stages of surface modification, namely the sponge-like network for lower fluences and conversion to the grainy surface for the highest fluence. Simultaneously, the m-plane ZnO showed the highest roughness measured with AFM and a complex surface structure, which, depending on the purpose, can be beneficial for application, where the large effective surface area is needed e.g. catalytic reaction for gas molecule degradation.25
The prepared surface nanostructures further showed a clear effect on the interaction of light with ZnO crystal and change of refractive and extinction coefficients especially in the region above the bandgap, where the light penetration is limited to a depth of several nm.
It is clear that SHI modification with W8+ ions can be used for the control of optical properties by surface structuring on a nanometric scale. However, the role of the chemical nature of used SHI on the surface nanostructuring and optical response was not completely understood and has to be studied in future research.
