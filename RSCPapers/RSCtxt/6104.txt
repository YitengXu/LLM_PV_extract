    , Accepted 21st July 2014First published on 21st July 2014AbstractGreen strategy for high-efficiency and high-selectivity catalytic oxidation of alkanes is always a huge challenge for current catalysis chemistry and chemical production. Despite extensive development efforts on new catalysts for cyclohexane oxidation, current commercial processes still suffer from low conversion, poor selectivity, and excessive production of waste. We demonstrate the design and synthesis of composites made from carbon nitride (C3N4) and Au nanoparticles for a higher conversion efficiency of 10.54% and 100% selectivity to cyclohexanone photocatalyst systems without any oxidation or initiators under visible light for a total green oxidation of cyclohexane. C3N4/Au composites may provide a powerful pathway for the development of high-performance catalysts and production processes for the green chemical industry.
Introduction
The selective oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons is one of the most challenging and interesting subjects in current catalytic chemistry due to the inertness of the C–H bond and the huge economic benefit from fine chemicals production.1,2 Among various alkane oxidations, the selective oxidation of cyclohexane is attractive because its product, KA-oil (a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol), is an important intermediate in manufacturing Nylon-6 and Nylon-66.3 Because the products, cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, are substantially more reactive than the reactant cyclohexane, high selectivity (about 80%) to KA-oil is realized only at low cyclohexane conversion (only about 5%) using soluble cobalt catalysts in the modern industry. Moreover, the reaction conditions always need higher temperature, higher pressure, and an initiator or co-catalyst.4–7 However, a green catalytic process demands: (1) the proportion of raw material converted into product is as high as possible; (2) the catalyst is as selective as possible; (3) the cost of reduction or oxidation agent is as low as possible; (4) the use of safer, more environmentally benign raw materials and solvents or solvent free processes.
Carbon nitride (C3N4) has a smaller direct band gap due to the sp2 hybridization of carbon and nitrogen forming the π-conjugated graphitic planes.8 It has attracted widespread interest for many applications: as metal-free photocatalyst for degradation methyl orange,9 in water splitting (H2 or O2 evolution from water for its good visible-light response),10 as well as for the production of H2O2.11 This suggests that water will become a proper oxidant source for in situ production of an oxidant by a C3N4-based photocatalyst.
Metallic nanomaterials with localized surface Plasmon resonances (SPRs) have been extensively studied for their use in photocatalysis12 and solar energy conversion.13 Particularly, gold (Au) nanoparticles have been applied as a visible light-responding photocatalyst owing to their surface plasmon resonance.14,15 Recently, Liu et al. have reported that the combination of Au and carbon dots yielded 63.8% conversion efficiency and 99.9% selectivity toward cyclohexane oxidation using H2O2 as the oxidation agent under visible light.16
Based on the light-induced hydrogen peroxide generation property of C3N4 and photocatalysis property of Au nanoparticles, Au depositing on C3N4 (C3N4/Au) may construct a new efficient photocatalyst for total green cyclohexane oxidation. Here, we present the design and fabrication of C3N4/Au nanocomposites that served as photocatalysts for cyclohexane oxidation by water under visible light (>420 nm) without any oxidant or initiator. The C3N4/Aunanocomposites exhibit the highest activity, with about 10.54% conversion of cyclohexane and 100% selectivity to cyclohexanone. Also, the nanocomposite is efficient for its excellent recyclable property in the oxidation of cyclohexane.
Experimental methods
Chemical reagents
Unless otherwise noted, all materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Preparation of C3N4 nanocomposite
Carbon nitride (C3N4) was synthesized by a typical method.17 10 g of urea powder was put into an alumina crucible with a cover and then heated to 550 °C with a heating rate of 0.5 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace and maintained at this temperature for 3 h. The obtained light yellow powder was C3N4.
Preparation of C3N4/Au nanocomposite
0.2 g C3N4 (obtained by heating urea at 550 °C for 3 h) was added to an appropriate amount of aqueous 2.5 mM HAuCl3 and stirred for 12 h. After centrifuging, the precipitate was irradiation by UV light for 2 h. The resulting product was dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.
Characterization
The crystal structure of the resultant products was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a X'Pert-ProMPD (Holland) D/max-γAX-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained with a FEI/Philips Tecnai 12 BioTWIN transmission electron microscope and a CM200 FEG transmission electron microscope, respectively. The TEM samples were prepared by dropping the solution onto a copper grid with a polyvinyl formal support film and dried in air. Room temperature UV-Vis absorption was recorded on a Lambda 750 (Perking Elmer) spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum was recorded on a FTIR spectrometer (Spectrum One, Perkin Elmer) using a standard KBr pellet technique. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed with an unfiltered HeI (21.22 eV) gas discharge lamp at a total instrumental energy resolution of 100 meV. The gas chromatographs (GCs) were performed in a Varian3400 GC column with a cross-linked 5% PhMe silicone column (25 m × 0.20 mm × 0.33 μm) and a FID detector under the following conditions: carrier gas (N2) at 140 K; temperature program 60 °C, 1 min, 15 °C min−1, 180 °C, 15 min; split ratio, 6:1; injector, 280 °C; detector, 280 °C.
Photocatalysis activity test
The photocatalytic reactions were carried out under quite mild conditions. The reaction mixture of 0.5 g catalyst, 20 mL ultrapure water and 10 mL cyclohexane was magnetically stirred at 333 K in a round bottom flask with a condenser pipe in an oil bath for 6–36 h. Before the photocatalysis experiment, the air was removed by bubbling nitrogen into the mixture for 30 min. Further, the top of the condenser pipe was sealed with a rubber plug. The reaction was carried out under visible light (cutoff filter L-42 was used to remove λ < 420 nm light from the 300 W Xenon lamp). After the reaction, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation, and the products were directly analyzed by GC.
Hydrogen peroxide generation test
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) measurements were performed on a 2.0 mL reaction suspension. After reaction, the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. Then 0.5 mL volume of 1% o-tolidine in 0.1 M HCl was added to the supernate.18 This mixture was allowed to react for 2 min. Subsequently, it was acidified with 1 M HCl (2 mL), which caused the color of the dispersion to turn yellow. The yellow product was a protonated form of the 2-electron oxidation product of o-tolidine, which had a characteristic maximum at around 446 nm.
Rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) experiments
The hydrogen peroxide generation test was performed using a Pt disk (3.0 mm in diameter)-Pt ring rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) (Jiangsu Jiangfen Electroanalytical Instrument Co. Ltd). A platinum wire was the auxiliary electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, saturated KCl) was the reference electrode. The working electrodes were prepared by spreading them with catalysts dispersed in ethanol. Then the suspension was dropped onto the Pt disk. The RRDE experiments were performed with N2-saturation 0.1 M KOH at rotation rate of 1600 rpm. In KOH solution, the oxygen reduction was more sensitive to be detected. The potential of the disk was scanned from 0.8 V to 2.2 V vs. RHE at 10 mV s−1 while the potential of the ring was held constant at 0.55 V vs. RHE. O2 generated at the disc from water oxidation will be reduced to H2O under this potential. The current signal was recorded with a CHI 660C work station (CH Instruments, Chenhua, Shanghai, China). All electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature.
Electrocatalytic activity measurement toward hydrogen peroxide degradation
The electrocatalytic activities of C3N4 and C3N4/Au for H2O2 decomposition were tested in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell with a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. The working electrodes were C3N4-and C3N4/Au-modified glass carbon (GC) electrodes. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the C3N4 and C3N4/Au modified GC electrodes were obtained in ultrapure water containing 50 mM H2O2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
Characterization of C3N4/Au nanocomposite
In the present work, C3N4 fabricated by the thermal polycondensation of urea was dipped into HAuCl3 solution, and stirred for 12 h. The final product, the C3N4/Au photocatalyst, was obtained by in situ reduction with UV light irradiation for 2 h. The morphologies of the C3N4/Au photocatalyst were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Fig. 1a shows that many Au nanoparticles loaded on the C3N4 sheets. The typical spacing of Au of 0.235 nm, which corresponds to the 111 crystal face of Au, was detected by HRTEM and FFT (Fig. 1b). Three elements (C, N, and Au) were identified by the EDS element analysis of C3N4/Au (see Fig. S1†). The formation of C3N4/Au was also confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Compared with Au (Fig. 1c blue trace), the nanocomposite (Fig. 1c black trace) exhibits two extradiffraction peaks at 13.8° and 27.9° (as Fig. 1c red trace exhibited). The former peak at 13.8 belongs to an in-planar structural packing motif. Both peaks are the characteristic peaks commonly found in carbon nitride. The other peak at 27.9° is due to the stacking of the conjugated aromatic system, corresponding to the 002 crystal face of C3N4 and reveals an interlayer spacing of aromatic units of about 0.324 nm.19,20Fig. 1d shows the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of C3N4 (red trace) and C3N4/Au (black trace). Compared with C3N4, C3N4/Au shows an absorption band around 500 nm that can be assigned to Au nanoparticle plasma absorption.21 As a result, this may lead to higher photocatalytic activity.

As shown in Fig. S2,† FT-IR spectra reveal that the original C–N network of C3N4 remains mostly unchanged after the Au nanoparticles were loaded onto it. The typical breathing mode of the tri-s-triazine units at 806.5 cm−1, as well as its stretching mode in the 1200–1650 cm−1 region, are also found in the IR spectra of C3N4/Au. Specifically, the bands at 1315.7 and 1241.2 cm−1 respectively, correspond to the stretching vibrations of the connected units of N–(C)3 (full condensation) and C–N–C (partial condensation), whereas the bands at 1645.4, 1564.5, and 1408.3 cm−1 represent the stretching vibration modes of heptazine-derived repeating units.22
Catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane using C3N4/Au nanocomposites
In the catalysis experiments, the mixture of C3N4/Au composites (500 mg), cyclohexane (10 mL) and ultrapure water (20 mL) in a round bottom flask (100 mL) with water condenser underwent continuous magnetic stirring. The oxidation products were analysed by gas chromatography (GC). Fig. 2 shows the time dependence of the conversion and selectivity of cyclohexane oxidation to cyclohexanol with C3N4/Au as the photocatalyst driven by visible light (λ > 420 nm). It reveals that conversion efficiency increases with increasing reaction time, and the selectivity to cyclohexanone remained constant at 100%. After 24 h reaction, a high conversion efficiency of 10.54% was obtained.

Hydrogen peroxide generation by C3N4/Au nanocomposites
In most hydrocarbons oxidation reaction cases, H2O2 is introduced to the reaction system, which in turn releases HO˙ to oxidize cyclohexane to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. In a recent report, Chen et al. showed that hydrogen peroxide could be generated during the water-splitting process under light irradiation by C3N4.11 H2O2 can be detected using UV-Vis spectroscopy by adding the peroxide indicator o-tolidine immediately to the solution with a typical absorption peak at around 446 nm (Fig. 3a, red trace). However, for C3N4/Au, there is no H2O2 detected after Xe lamp irradiation for 12 h. This suggests that the Au nanoparticles on C3N4 play an important role in catalytic decomposition of the H2O2 produced in the reaction process.
 Fig. 3  (a) Free H2O2 in reaction solution after irradiation for 12 h. The reaction system is 500 mg catalyst dispersed in N2-saturated 200 mL ultrapure water containing 10 mL cyclohexane using C3N4/Au (black trace) and C3N4 (red trace) as catalyst. (b) Cyclic voltammograms of C3N4/Au (black trace) and C3N4-modified (red trace) GC electrodes in ultrapure water in (solid lines) and without (dash lines) the presence of 50 mM H2O2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
To test the H2O2 generation rate, 500 mg C3N4 was dispersed in 200 mL ultrapure water with stirring under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. S3,† the initial H2O2 production rate is 34.5 μmol h−1. The amount of H2O2 was calculated by the corresponding calibration curve (Fig. S4†). Note that as reaction time increases, the H2O2 generation rate becomes lower because H2O2 invariably poisons the photocatalysts. These results suggested that C3N4 could photocatalyze water oxidation to generate H2O2via a two-electron water oxidation process.
To further prove the catalytic effect of Au toward H2O2 decomposition, electrochemical tests were carried out in a typical three-electrode system with the C3N4 (Fig. 3b red trace) and C3N4/Au-modified (Fig. 3b black trace) GC electrode, respectively, as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrochemical behavior comparison of the two electrodes was measured using a cyclic voltammeter in ultrapure water in the presence of 50 mM H2O2 (Fig. 3b). After adding H2O2, the reduction current at 0.10 V (vs. RHE) was significant increased, which can be due to the decomposition of H2O2. This clearly shows that the C3N4/Au-modified GC electrode has a more positive onset potential (as shown in Fig. 3b solid lines) and a larger current at 0.10 V, indicating C3N4/Au has excellent catalytic ability toward H2O2 decomposition. This kind of catalytic ability can be attributed to the presence of Au on C3N4.
Theoretically, water can be oxidized to hydrogen peroxide by C3N4via a two-electron oxidation process. In Fig. S5b,† the optical band gap was determined to be 2.71 eV. Combined with the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement, as shown in Fig. S5a,† the CB and VB edge potentials of C3N4/Au are calculated as −0.80 and 1.91 V, respectively (detailed calculation in ESI†). To confirm the H2O2 evolution, a series of electrochemical measurements [with the rotating ring disk electrodes (RRDE)] were carried out.23 The potential on Pt ring is determined by a CV study. As shown in Fig. S6a,† the oxygen reduction peak is not found in water medium. The oxidation wave at 1.46 V and reduction wave at 1.08 V appear in the case of O2 addition, which contributes to oxide formation/reduction on the electrode surface.24 It has been reported that the ORR is easily happened in the alkaline solution. Thus, the potential of ORR is detected in 0.1 M KOH solution as shown in Fig. S6b.†Fig. 4a shows the steady-state hydrodynamic voltammograms (RRDE) for the OER at C3N4/Au modified Pt disk in N2-saturated ultrapure water at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. The top curve represents the corresponding Pt disk current (Idisk) of the relevant ring electrode (due to the reduction of O2 generated at the disk electrode). The Pt ring has an applied voltage of +0.55 V that can reduce O2 to H2O (Fig. S6b†). Obviously, the Pt ring current (Iring) is clearly observable, but is much smaller than its theoretical value of 157.06 (Idisk × N, N is the RRDE collection efficiency of 0.24), indicating the contribution of the 2-electron oxidation mechanism in the OER.
 Fig. 4  (a) Steady state voltammograms for the OER, in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH, at Pt disk (modified with C3N4/Au)–Pt ring electrodes (RRDE) at rotation rate of 1600 rpm. The Pt ring was polarized at +0.55 V vs. RHE. Potential scan rate of the disk electrode: 10 mV s−1. (b) The ESR signals of the DMPO-˙OH (aqueous solution) adducts for C3N4/Au-H2O system under visible light irradiation. C3N4/Au = 5 mg/50 mL; H2O = 10 mL; [DMPO] = 40 mM. 
A spin-trapping electron spin resonance (ESR) test was carried out to check the active oxygen species produced by the C3N4/Ausystem under visible light (λ > 420 nm). As shown in Fig. 4b, typical quartet peaks characteristic of the DMPO-˙OH (DMPO, dimethyl pyridine N-oxide) adduct appeared gradually upon light irradiation of the aqueous C3N4/Au system, which suggested that HO˙ is the active oxygen species in this photocatalytic oxidation process.25
To further confirm this point, a reactive species trapping experiment was carried out to investigate the reactive oxygen species in the photocatalytic oxidation process. In this procedure, three different scavengers, tert-butanol (a ˙OH radical scavenger), p-benzoquinone(BZQ, a O2−˙ radical scavenger) and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na2-EDTA, a hole scavenger) are used.26 The photocatalytic performances in Fig. 5 are shown that the addition of tert-butanol substantially reduced the photocatalytic activity for the oxidation of cyclohexane from almost 10.54% to 0.97% in 36 h. The introduction of BZQ and Na2-EDTA do not affect the photocatalysis results. This implies that an ˙OH radical is the main reactive species while O2−˙ radicals and holes do not contribute to photocatalytic performance. The addition of tert-butanol traps the ˙OH radicals, leading to low conversion of cyclohexane. This confirms that in the buffer solution containing C3N4/Au catalyst, a larger number of HO˙ will be produced by visible light irradiation. Thus, in present system, the generation of HO˙ can be concluded as represented in Scheme 1. First, H2O is partially catalytic oxidized to H2O2 by C3N4/Au under light irradiation via a 2-electron OER process. Then the HO2− decomposes to free HO˙, which is more stable and more active than the initial H2O2.

Surface plasma resonance effect study
Cyclohexane oxidation was further carried out with the C3N4/Au composite catalyst driven by light of different wavelengths (Fig. 6). This shows that the best conversion efficiency is obtained at 500 nm, the wavelength that matches the surface plasma resonance zone of Au nanoparticles (around 500 nm).

Proposed mechanism study
To further study the proposed mechanism, a series of control experiments was carried out. Table 1 lists the catalytic performances of different catalysts. The contrast of Au (entry 1) and C3N4/Au (entry 3) indicates that C3N4 plays a decisive role on the catalytic behaviour. No production is detected, as there is no C3N4. In a word, C3N4 as a H2O2 provider play an important role in the selectively catalyzed oxidation process of cyclohexane. If there are no Au nanoparticles, the conversion is only 2.62, as shown in entry 2 after 24 h, indicating that Au nanoparticles have a significant impact on the catalytic behaviour. In this case, the main product is also cyclohexanone with a selectivity of 72.66%. Au nanoparticles also have an effect on the selectivity of cyclohexanone generation. Light radiation is another factor for affecting the conversion and selectivity of cyclohexanone (entry 4, control experiment b). Without Xe lamp emission, the conversion of cyclohexane of C3N4/Au is reduced from 10.54% to 0, which should be because C3N4 cannot generate H2O2 without irradiation. Under the no catalyst condition, there is no Cy–OH or CyO found in the product (entry 5, control experiment c).

Moreover, we investigated the effect of Au amount on the oxidation of cyclohexanephotocatalytic performance. The experimental results are summarized in Table 2. The conversion increased remarkably from 3.25% to 10.54% with increasing Au amount (from 1% to 10%). Meanwhile, the selectivities of cyclohexanone remained constant at 100%. The highest conversion was 10.54% at a mass fraction of 10%. Higher Au content loading on the C3N4 surface increased the utilization of light and H2O2 decomposition, preventing its inhibition of C3N4 photocatalytic water oxidation activity. When the mass fraction is larger than 10%, the conversion and selectivity to cyclohexanone are both decreased. This may be due to excessive Au blocking of the C3N4 surface, leading to a decrease in the light absorbance.

Based on the above results and discussions, the proposed mechanism for the photo-induced catalytic ability of the present catalyst is described in Fig. 7. The surface plasma resonance of Au nanoparticles enhances the light absorption of C3N4/Au composites. The overall reaction is shown as follows:  
 Fig. 7  Proposed reaction mechanism for visible-light driven oxidation of cyclohexane on C3N4/Au. 
Under visible light, H2O was oxidized to H2O2 by C3N4 and then decomposed into hydroxyl radicals (HO˙), which serve as a strong oxidant for conversion of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone. In the process, Au nanoparticles under visible light play a key role in the eventual high conversion and selectivity under Xe lamp irradiation. The combination of C3N4 and Au nanoparticles create a new system to realize “green chemistry” on the cyclohexane selective oxidation: (1) The conversion of 10.54% is higher than before (presently only 5% in modern industry); (2) 100% selectivity to cyclohexanone; (3) no initiator or oxidant is used; (4) the reaction is carried out at 60 °C with visible light irradiation, which is mild and safe.
To evaluate the stability of the catalyst, the recycling of C3N4/Au was performed for the catalyze oxidation of cyclohexanone (Fig. 8). The catalyst is recovered by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and water, dried at 323 K in air. The average conversion rate of 10.37% and selectivity of 100% of cyclohexanone were very close to the original result (Table 1, entry 3). This catalytic system can also be applied to oxidation of cyclooctene under the same experiment conditions. Excellent catalytic activity (conversion: 32.41%, selectivity: 94.4% to epoxycyclooctane) was also observed.

Conclusions
In the present study, we have demonstrated that the oxidation of cyclohexane can be efficiently catalyzed under mild conditions without any oxidants or initiators by Au nanoparticles located on the C3N4. Remarkably high conversion of 10.54% and selectivity of 100% of cyclohexanone were achieved. The entire catalysis pathway was totally environmentally friendly and can be described as “a total green catalysis oxidation.” Moreover, the catalyst is stable in the reaction system with excellent repeatability. This may lead to new advances and applications pertaining to functional materials in energy and catalytic fields and related processes.
