    , Accepted 30th August 2022First published on 30th August 2022AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) hetero-phase homojunctions have become increasingly popular in recent years. This is because high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) require lower contact resistance and clean and atomically flat interfaces for efficient carrier transport. In these junctions, the channel is made of a semiconducting phase (2H), and the electrodes are in contact with semi-metallic (1T′) or metallic (1T) phases. This review describes the tunneling process in detail and demonstrates the creation of high-performance hetero-phase homojunctions. These techniques can assist in the development of novel electrical and optoelectronic devices. This overview of current nanomaterials research, we believe, will aid in the development of reliable and efficient metal–interlayer–semiconductor contacts for nanoelectronic and nanophotonics applications.

1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can have a wide range of compositions and dual phases of crystalline and electronic structures, giving these materials a wide range of interesting properties.1–12 The number of layers has a significant influence on the physical properties of the materials as well as defining the electrical and optical structures of 2D quantum systems due to quantum confinement and interlayer interactions. Because of their various layered structures, such as hexagonal 2H polytype to semimetal (trigonal 1T′ polytype) phases and distorted octahedral, the number of layers has a significant impact on the physical material characteristics. This is due to the organization of their structures. The difficulty of applying Moore's law to traditional silicon devices creates a significant barrier to future logic transistor progress. If 2D materials can be successfully fabricated, the nanoelectronic device scaling limit will be pushed even further. Traditional metal-oxide semiconductors based on Si, GaAs, and other materials lack the benefits of 2D materials. Some advantages include the absence of trapping states at the interface and surface, atomically thin thickness, and the ability to change the electronic structure. Because of these characteristics, 2D TMDs are regarded as potential candidates for high-performance electronics. Some 2D materials, such as h-BN, cannot be used to fabricate channel materials due to the presence of band gaps and must be avoided. Even if the band gap value can be controlled using defects,6,13–19 doping,16,20–23 or strain engineering,13,20,24 exact control is always an experimental and conceptual challenge. Monolayer MX2s have the most tunable band gaps of any 2D material discovered to date.18,25–29 Because of this, they have been the focus of a lot of research in field-effect transistors (FETs) and other nanodevices that use FETs.30–36
High-performance FET devices cannot be made directly from MX2s due to the high resistance to contact between the MX2s and the metal substrate.34,37,38 As a result, one of the most important challenges that must be met is lowering the resistance to contact between the MX2s and the metal substrate.39 Interfacial orbital overlap will make it easier for electrons to tunnel across the interface, according to the results of previous studies.34,40,41 On the other hand, a thorough examination of the impact of interfacial charge transfer has not yet been implemented on the MX2/metal design. To elaborate, the charge amount transferred will be influenced by the interfacial lattice coherency, the work function of the metals, and the way MX2 is stacked on top of the metals.42 As electrons flow from the metal to the MX2 layer, the phase stability of the MX2 membrane may change, which could cause a big change in the way the material contacts.43,44 The performance of MX2-based transistors has been the subject of several experimental publications in the past. These articles discuss the application of phase engineering techniques to improve the transistor performance.20,44 Even so, no research has been done to find out how the metal substrate might affect the stability of the phase. Tunneling currents, on the other hand, are abundant in 2D semiconductor-based Schottky junctions. This happens because these Schottky junctions have very narrow Schottky barrier widths.45 This causes large leakage currents to form, which makes the diode to use more power. At the moment, changing the width of Schottky barriers often depends on chemical doping on surface absorption, which is bad for the environment and does not work well for controlling electronic structures.46,47 Lattice defect healing is the best and most common way to lower the inherent defect doping of ultrathin 2D materials in a way that works well and stays the same.48 As a result, because of their structures, they are an ideal system for investigating layer-dependent properties. It is important to remember that the stacking orders or coordination geometries of atoms can be changed to change the properties of TMDs even more.49–57 1T′ (or 1T) phase group VIB TMDs, for example, in which one chalcogen layer is offset relative to the other to produce an M-centered octahedral, have shown an excellent ability to minimize resistance in electrical devices.58–60 Producing the semi-metallic 1T′ phase (or the metallic 1T phase) simply by intercalating with alkali metals,61,62 subjecting the material to mechanical stresses,63–65 modulating the electrical field,66,67 and so on is difficult. The use of phase transitions and phase-selective synthesis is in high demand. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process was recently used to directly produce a proposed Weyl semimetal known as 1T′ phase telluride (MoTe2, WTe2).68–70 MoTe2 has been shown to have two different polymorphic phases, which can be changed because their free energy values are close enough to each other. MoTe2 contains three distinct types of crystal phases: orthorhombic Td (Pmn21), monoclinic 1T′ (space group P21/m), and hexagonal 2H (space group P63/mmc).71,72 Furthermore, previous research has shown that the space group of the 1T' phase varies with the layer thickness. Samples with even layering remain monoclinic, as expected for the 1T′ phase, but their symmetry is now described by the symmorphic space group Pm.73
The number of people interested in using 2D hetero-phase homojunction has increased in recent years.74–78 This is because high-performance field-effect transistors necessitate a clean interface as well as a low contact resistance. The channel in these junctions is made of a semiconducting phase called 2H, and the electrodes are made of either a semi-metallic phase called 1T′ or a metallic phase called 1T. This review article explains the tunneling process in detail and shows how to build high-performance hetero-phase homojunctions. These methodologies can help in the development of novel electrical and optoelectronic devices. MoTe2, a 2D material with multiple phases, has been used in electrical applications. This examination of the current state of nanomaterials research will make it easier to create reliable electrical devices with low contact resistance. These techniques could be used to improve the functionality of electrical devices made of 2D materials.
There are three types of common contact modes: top contact, side contact, and vdW contact.79,80 These contacts are difficult to reach Ohmic nature in actual devices due to the presence of defects, vdW gap, and manufacturing challenges.34,80 By achieving Ohmic contact between 2D TMDs and electrodes, a novel contact mode known as atomic-level seamless contact has recently been developed to address limitations in the existing contact modes.79,81,82 In this case, the native chemical bonds that connect the 2D metals and TMDs directly demonstrate a seamless contact that can be used to realize ohmic contact.34 When compared to the previously mentioned three types of contact configurations, atomic-level seamless contacts have three distinct figures of merit. First, because there is no interface gap, atomic-level seamless contact represents the most promising path for achieving high-quality electrical contacts. Second, by avoiding the introduction of flaws and impurities from the step-by-step micro/nano fabrication processes, the Schottky barrier height could be reduced almost to zero when realizing Ohmic contact in electronics devices. The third is that short-channel devices that are naturally applicable to the large-scale integrated circuits and will have low power dissipation with the lowest contact resistance can be made using atomic-level seamless contacts. These benefits demonstrate the seamless contact's significant potential for use in creating an Ohmic contact interface.
2. 2D metals and 2H TMDs with theoretical approaches

Fig. 1(a and b) depicts schematic representations of various phase configurations, such as 2H and1T′, as well as top and side views of the following 2D material phases: MoTe2 has a trigonal hexagonal prismatic (2H-MoTe2) shape in its natural state (Fig. 1a), whereas 1T′-MoTe2 has an octahedral structure (Fig. 1b). Mo-based TMDs consist of Mo layers sandwiched between two chalcogen layers.1,2 TMDs exist in different phases such as 2H and 1T′ as shown in Fig. 1(a and b).

Although a further modification has been described, both the 1T and 1T′ phases have inversion centers in the monolayer. Spin-split bands are therefore not possible in any of these phases.9,10 The growth parameters that allow all three phases of MoTe2, including the undefined 1T phase, to form are discussed here, as well as the various ways that their properties can be checked using both experiments and computer simulations.4 As shown in Fig. 1c, the metallic character of MoTe2 can be seen in both the 1T and 1T′ phases. A structural phase transition from a hexagonal phase to a stable monoclinic (1T′) MoTe2 phase was also observed. This modification occurred in the material.83 When the bulk 1T′-MoTe2 crystals are stacked, they can transition from a semi-metallic to a semiconducting state. MoTe2 crystals have a maximum carrier mobility of 4000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a magnetoresistance of 16000% when exposed to 14 T and at 1.8 K. Due to interband spin-orbit coupling, the few-layered version of 1T′-MoTe2 has a bandgap opening of up to 60 meV.83 This was made possible by the material's few layers. The band structure of the monolayer 1T′-MoTe2 material was calculated using the hybrid functional (HSE06) for the exchange-correlation potential and the lattice constants determined by experiments. The hybrid functional was used to perform this calculation (Fig. 1d). In the absence of SOC, the two bands will meet on the Γ–X line at a point where there is no gap opening (red line). When SOC is present, however, there is no longer any degeneracy at the crossing site. This makes a very small bandgap of about 28 meV.83 This is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data. In the bulk 1T′ phase, the tight bandgap disappears, resulting in a semi-metallic 66 meV band overlap (Fig. 1d). This result agrees with the bulk transport data.83 Changing the number of MoTe2 layers in this way allows for a one-of-a-kind bandgap adjustment.
Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the symmetry of chalcogen atoms is the same in both the upper and lower layers (Fig. 1e). In contrast, the Te atoms are exactly in the middle of the hexagon in the 1T phase (Fig. 1e). In contrast, the Te atoms are exactly in the middle of the hexagon in the 1T phase (Fig. 1e). Similarly, for the 1T′ phase, the reconstruction of the distorted 1T phase results in a slight buckling3 between the two atomic planes (Fig. 1e). Note that the 2H phase is thermodynamically more stable under ambient conditions.4 The calculated lattice parameters are mentioned in Table 1. The 2H phase loses inversion symmetry near the K point of the Brillouin zone, which results in spin-split bands in the bulk materials, which leads to valleytronic performance5–7 and could be a potential material for spintronic applications.8 The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum lie at the different symmetry points. Thus, the 2H MoTe2 possesses an indirect band gap of 1.172 eV.

3. Coplanar semiconductor–metal circuitry on few-layer MoTe2via heteroepitaxy
Through crystal polymorphism, the electronic phase of atomically thin TMDs can be selectively stabilized as metallic or semiconducting. So, these polymorphs could be used as parts of two-dimensional electronic circuits. One of the most important things to do to make this work is to come up with a way to develop 2D polymorphs in the vapor phase that is both selective and sequential. Through a process called heteroepitaxy, different types of metallic (1T′) and semiconducting (2H) MoTe2 crystals can be joined together in the same atomic planes. This can be accomplished. To achieve the desired result of polymorphic integration, this approach may be taken.59 The newly formed polymorphic coplanar contact is atomically coherent, and it possesses a barrier potential that is restricted to a few nanometers in space and possesses a value of at least 25 meV as a bare minimum.59 Following that, the coplanar contact properties of a 1T′–2H–1T′ polymorph field-effect transistor (FET) were studied. The source and drain electrodes of this type of FET are made of two 1T′-MoTe2 crystals. For epitaxial stitching to happen on a 2H-MoTe2 crystal, the mole ratio of MoO3 to NaCl must be 2:1 (Fig. 2a and b; time = 6). Because lithography and liftoff were used to connect each phase to the end terminals of the Au electrodes on the SiO2/p + -Si substrates, it was possible to perform local characterizations both inside and across each phase in a back-gate FET configuration. This allowed each phase to be connected to the electrode end terminals (Fig. 2a). Both types of electrical connections were established on a 2H-MoTe2 channel that was otherwise identical so that a direct comparison could be carried out on the device itself. Covalent bonding enables the formation of completely coplanar contacts at the crystallographic boundary between one and two dimensions in 1T′-2H MoTe2 junctions. So, these junctions are made of two-dimensional semiconductors and metals that fit together perfectly at the atomic level.34,58,84 They also looked at the transfer curve, which was influenced by Vg, and discovered that the gate tunability of the 1T′-coplanar contact FET was significantly higher. As a result, the threshold voltage Vg,th was reduced to 8 V (as opposed to 40 V for Au-top contacts) and the on current was increased to 6.0 S at Vb = 50 mV (as opposed to 0.7 μS for Au-top contacts). Both of these differences are caused by the fact that the Au-top contacts have a higher threshold voltage (Fig. 2c). The temperature-dependent G plots (Fig. 2c, inset) show that the 1T′-coplanar contact FET is temperature-dependent only weakly and requires a factor of five or six less activation energy than other FETs. This is because the 1T′-coplanar contact FET has an additional layer of coplanarity on its gate, making it more temperature resistant. This is due to the coplanar structure of the 1T′-coplanar contact FET. As a result, the difference between channel G at Vg = 0 and channel G at 77 K is five orders of magnitude greater (Fig. 2c, inset).

Because both types of FETs use the same 2H-MoTe2 channel and have the same sheet resistance and gate capacitance, the contact type is responsible for any differences in the results of this head-to-head comparison. With their synthetic coplanar integration method, they were able to combine many TMD polymorphs into large regions, which show that a new 2D gadget design with atomic-level accuracy might be possible.59
4. Improvement in performance of 2H TMDs with 2D metals
4.1. Near-ideal van der Waals rectifiers based on Schottky junctions
Having control over metal–semiconductor interfaces, which may be affected by intricate Fermi pinning effects and defect states, is essential for all 2D semiconductor device technology applications. Using all-2D Schottky junctions made of the 2D metal 1T′-MoTe2 and the semiconducting monolayer MoS2, a nearly perfect rectifier was demonstrated.85 They demonstrate how the van der Waals integration of the two 2D materials can handle the strong Fermi pinning effect induced by traditional metals, resulting in a higher Schottky barrier height. To accomplish this, the height of the Schottky barrier was increased. Furthermore, the Schottky barrier width can be increased by 59 by repairing the initial atom vacancies in MoS2 and lowering the inherent defect doping. The 1T′-MoTe2/healed-MoS2 rectifier has a near-unity ideality factor of 1.6, a rectifying ratio of more than 5 × 105, and a high external quantum efficiency of more than 20%. Furthermore, the rectifier has a high internal quantum efficiency of more than 20%. Finally, they extend the barrier optimization technique so that it can be applied to different types of Schottky junctions. This lets them come up with a different way to improve the performance of electronic devices made out of 2D materials. The concept and approach of Schottky junction optimization are depicted in Fig. 3a–c. Fig. 3a and b show a summary of the differences between ordinary Schottky junctions and those that have been tuned using conventional and 2D metals. A traditional metal electrode is represented by the purple sphere, while 2D metal and semiconductor atoms are represented by the yellow, orange, and gray spheres. The Fermi pinning effect is represented by the red X. The Schottky junction depletion zone is represented by the yellow gradient sections. The strong Fermi pinning effect caused by both the lattice defects involved in classic two-dimensional (3D) metal evaporation, the falling metallic wave function of ordinary metals, and the interface states will result in the modest Schottky barrier height SB. In contrast, intrinsic defect doping in as-prepared 2D semiconductors results in a high carrier concentration and a narrow Schottky barrier width W. The Schottky diode leaks a lot of current in the opposite direction due to the Schottky barrier's low height SB and narrow width W.

4.2. 1L-MoS2 FETs contacted with 1T′ (ML)-MoS2 for enhanced mobility
As the number of layers went down, the critical electron injection concentration and time needed for the 2D MoS2 phase transition also went down. The layer-dependent density of states of 2H-MoS2, which affects phase stability after electron doping, was found to be the cause of the clear connection. This was shown to be true.88 Also, because the energy barrier for phase change is higher in monolayer MoS2 than in multilayer MoS2, the time it takes for reactions to happen is much longer in monolayer MoS2. The layer-dependent phase transition of 2D MoS2 makes it possible to chemically make semiconducting-metallic heterophase junctions and ultrathin electronic devices, enabling the future fabrication of rectifying diodes and all 2D field-effect transistors. The phase change of 2H-MoS2 into 1T (1T′)-MoS2 is thought to be caused by electron injection. The pristine 2H-MoS2 lattice collapses because these electrons occupy the lowest energy levels above the Fermi energy, resulting in a structural transition to the 1T phase, followed by a structural transition to the deformed phase (1T′). Regardless of the technique used to convert the 2H phase to the 1T (1T′) phase, they were able to make rectifying diodes and all 2D FETs by using chemically changed 2D M-S junctions as the main building blocks in their method. This was achieved by combining the vastly different phase transition propensities of 1L and more layered MoS2 to create 1T′-2H (M–S) junctions on the same MoS2 flake. This enabled the formation of 1T′-2H (M–S) connections on the same MoS2 flake. This was accomplished without the use of lithography. The forward/reverse current ratio of the rectifying diodes is 3 × 103 based on the 1T′ (9L)–2H (1L) MoS2 junction. (Fig. 3d). This research shows that rectifying diodes based on 2D heterophase junctions is not only feasible but also practical. Also, the 1L-MoS2 flakes can be turned into all-MoS2 FETs with two ML-MoS2 islands covering some of them if they are treated with n-butyllithium before the change. The 1T′ phase ML-MoS2 islands are used as a source and drain electrodes (see Fig. 3e inset). The device employs a 1L MoS2 semiconducting channel. Because of the lower contact resistance, this type of all-2D FET performed better than devices with metal contacts (Fig. 3e). This discovery holds great promise for the development of ultrathin, high-performance nanoelectronic devices. They started looking into what caused the layer-dependent and chemically induced structural change in MoS2 by doing spin-polarized DFT calculations on the relative stability of two MoS2 phases with different layers and electron injection. This was the first step in their investigation in the layer-dependent and chemically induced structural transformations of MoS2. The primary goal of the calculations was to determine how stable each phase was in comparison to the other.89 They discovered that the difference in energy between the two phases of MoS2 displayed a layer-dependent pattern in both neutral and electron-doped states. As the number of layers decreased, the ΔE of neutral MoS2 increased. This demonstrates that phase transitioning thinner MoS2 is more difficult than transitioning thicker MoS2.88 These findings explain how the electrical architectures of 2D TMDs affect their chemical properties and provide guidance on how to program them to change their chemical properties.
4.3. Enhancing 2H-MoTe2 photosensitivity by inserting 1T-MoTe2 interlayer contact
By connecting 1T-MoTe2 interlayers, structures for 2H-MoTe2 photodetectors were created.90 This work investigated photoconductivity spectroscopy, time-resolved photoresponse, frequency-dependent photocurrent, and illumination intensity-dependent photoresponsivity. By adding a 1T-MoTe2 interlayer contact, the photosensitivity of 2H-MoTe2 in PC spectra was found to increase by a lot. Different electrode contacts and measurements, like frequency-dependent photocurrent and time-resolved photoresponse, are used to find out how MoTe2 carrier kinetic decay works. By adding 1T-MoTe2 interlayer connections, they were also able to look into the Schottky barrier heights (SBHs) that came from the thermionic emission theory. They made a MoTe2 photodetector with 1T-MoTe2 as an interlayer contact so they could study how 2H-MoTe2 responds to light when it is in contact with different electrodes. A contact using an Ag contact on 2H-MoTe2 was also built to allow for comparison. Fig. 4a depicts a schematic illustration of the interlayer electrode connections of 2H-MoTe2 structures with Ag and 1T-MoTe2. Fig. 4b shows the photocurrent spectra of 2H-MoTe2 with electrode connections made of Ag and 1T-MoTe2. There is a peak at around 0.9 eV, which corresponds to the energy gap of 2H-MoTe2. By including a 1T-MoTe2 interlayer electrode contact, the photoresponse of 2H-MoTe2 was significantly improved. Based on the results, it seems that photodetection devices could use layered TMD semiconductors made from MoTe2.90

4.4. 1T′/2H/1T′ MoTe2 FET array
To incorporate 2D van der Waals semiconductors into silicon-based electrical technology, sheets that are extremely crystalline, homogeneous, and large must be manufactured. Wafer-scale single-crystalline 2H-MoTe2 semiconductors were created on an amorphous insulating material substrate.91 Tellurizing a single seed crystal that had been carefully placed triggered the growth of in-plane 2D epitaxy. The resulting layer of single crystals completely covered a 2.5-centimeter-diameter wafer while maintaining an incredible level of uniformity. The two-dimensional (2D) single-crystalline film made of 2H-MoTe2 could be used as a template for vertical rapid epitaxy in the future. As they were made, 2H-MoTe2 single-crystal transistor arrays had great electrical performance, good homogeneity, and 100% device yield. High device uniformity and reliability, as well as the monolithic integration technique, are very important. They thought that single-crystalline films would make a big difference in improving device uniformity and reliability. They created a large-scale coplanar heterophase 1T′/2H/1T′ MoTe2 FET array with optimized contacts directly on the developing substrate using a wafer-scale single-crystalline 2H-MoTe2 thin film and their previously described phase engineered growth approach. The array was made up of 1T′ and 2H-FETs92 (Fig. 4c).
According to the statistical results of the 10 by 10 MoTe2 FET array, the on-current, field-effect mobility, and on/off ratio were all extremely narrowly distributed (Fig. 4d–f). This indicates that the electrical properties of the devices are spatially homogeneous on a large scale. The use of a film composed of a single crystalline phase allows for a one hundred percent device yield. Because the energy differences between their 2H and 1T′/1T states are greater than those of MoTe2, applying this method to other TMDs will necessitate further investigation. However, 1T/1T′ TMD synthesis has made significant progress. For example, the stable 1T′ phase of MoS2 was directly produced using a CVD technique by selecting the appropriate K2MoS4 precursor.93 In addition, K2MoS4 was combined with S and Se to yield high phase purity 1T′ MoS2 and MoSe2.94 Meanwhile, heat annealing and laser irradiation are being used to investigate the transition from the 1T′ phase to the 2H phase. This process could be extended to various 2D materials as phase-engineering methods advance. Similar to silicon manufacturing, the electrical properties of semiconducting 2H-MoTe2 wafers can be adjusted by adding dopants such as Nb and Re to the Mo film before it is tellurized. Since this technology can be used on several different substrates, 2D semiconductors may become more common in CMOS systems.91 Artificial van der Waals heterostructures made of two-dimensional atomic crystals have a lot of potential for use in next-generation electronics, either as an active channel or a buffer contact layer. But real 2D heterostructure devices are still hard to make because the transfer processes involve impurities and make metastable and inhomogeneous heterostructures. The polymorph engineering approach of laser-induced phase patterning was used to create an ohmic heterophase homojunction between 2H and 1T'-MoTe2. This homojunction is stable up to 300 °C and increases the carrier mobility of the MoTe2 transistor by a factor of 50 while maintaining a high on/off current ratio of 106.95,96
5. Phase patterning for MoTe2 ohmic contact
The local phase shift in MoTe2 is caused by the Te vacancy, according to both in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy and theoretical calculations. This means that MoTe2 is a true 2D device with an ohmic contact. Phase patterning in 2D transistors may overcome the Schottky contact problem. Single-crystalline films, as well as the monolithic integration technique, were expected to improve device uniformity and reliability. To show the impact of the heterophase homojunction in Fig. 5a, transistors were made without the 1T′ buffer layer using neighboring 2H-MoTe2 flakes on the same SiO2 substrate. The effects of this novel homojunction in the MoTe2 transistor are depicted in Fig. 5b and c. With an Ion/Ioff current ratio of 106, the n-type transistor characteristics demonstrated ohmic contact behavior. Furthermore, the strong heterophase homojunction structure of MoTe2 transistors allows for stable high-temperature transport up to 300 °C. The Arrhenius graphs show that the height of the energy barrier in the phase-patterned device (shown as the 1T′ contact in Fig. 5b) decreases significantly. In phase-patterned devices, the Arrhenius plot energy barrier extraction provides clear confirmation of genuine ohmic contact with low energy barrier height. So, the carrier field-effect mobility is increased by a factor of 50 compared to a device with a standard 2H-MoTe2/metal contact (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, using phase engineering, it was discovered that seven MX2/metal complexes were capable of forming zero Schottky barrier connections.97 Based on their estimates of the charge at the interface and their contact resistance studies, they developed three distinct types of MX2/metal contacts that can be manufactured with varying contact resistances. These contacts can have different contact resistances. As a result, electrons traveling from the metal to the MX2 channel must overcome not only a large tunnel barrier but also a Schottky barrier. This has also been identified as the main problem with previously investigated MX2/metal connections.38,40,98 According to their findings, increasing orbital overlapping to some extent will result in the metallization of MX2 at the interface, potentially removing the tunnel barrier between the MX2 channel and the metal (Fig. 5d). If 1T′(1T′′)-MX2 is the energetically stable structure, we can expect third-type contacts to form, as shown in Fig. 5e. In this scenario, the structural phase transition would occur in the MX2 domain, which is close to the metal. The Schottky barrier, on the other hand, is removed because the Fermi level of 1T′(1T′′)-MX2/metal is greater than the conduction band minimum of 2H-MX2. Using cutting-edge phase engineering techniques, there are many ways to make such systems come into contact. Finally, numerous schematic ideas for putting their theoretical discoveries into practice were presented, some of which had already been tested.

Their discoveries not only provide a realistic theoretical reference for all MX2/metal contact behavior but also provide insight into viable solutions to the bottleneck of concurrent 2D transistors.
6. Optimizing 1T and 2H hybridization in MoS2 monolayers for supercapacitors
A study was done to see if the in-plane 1T-2H phase hybridization (1L) could be changed to make MoS2-based supercapacitors 100 times more capacitive.99 An ohmic heterophase homojunction between 2H and 1T' (MoTe2) was created using the polymorph engineering approach of laser-induced phase patterning. This homojunction is stable up to 300 °C and increases the carrier mobility of MoTe2 transistors by a factor of 50 while maintaining a high on/off current ratio of 106. Calculations based on first principles were used to build and relax a typical model that included 40% of the 1T phase, as shown in Fig. 6a. The system energies associated with a big supercell 9 × 9 were calculated for each model to see if such a structure could withstand 1T-2H hybridization (Fig. 6b). The results are satisfactory when compared to previous findings.100 Surprisingly, the hybridization process is only expected to increase the total energy of the system by 0.03 eV, less than 10% of the energy difference between the 1T and 2H phases (0.28 eV). This means that the hybridized system should be much more stable than the pure 1T phase and closer to the stability of the 2H phase. Furthermore, the densities of the states that comprise a hybridized monolayer were considered. Fig. 6c depicts the interaction of the d and p states as they cross the Fermi level. This demonstrates that, despite the hybridization process, hybridized MoS2 is still metallic and has high conductivity. The valence band maximum, also known as the VBM, and the conduction band minimum, also known as the CBM, can both be found near the 1T phase border. Furthermore, the VBM and the CBM in Fig. 6d show that the 1T phase is extremely important. Weak Ar-plasma bombardment was shown to produce mosaic structures by locally causing a 2H → 1T phase transition in monolayer MoS2.101

7. Argon plasma, structural and quantum-state induced phase transition in TMDs
Experiments with scanning tunneling microscopy have shown that these 2H → 1T phase transitions are kept going by point defects (single S-vacancies), and the widths of the 1T domains that are induced are usually only a few nanometers. Using a technique called “selected-area phase patterning,” it was possible to make MoS2 FETs with 1T phase transitions in the metal contact areas of the device. This made the overall performance of the device much better. Two H channels and two H contacts are included in the devices. Type II devices have 2H channels and 1T@2H contacts. Type-III devices, as shown in Fig. 7a, have 1T@2H channels and contacts. Fig. 7b depicts the typical transfer characteristics of the three different types of devices. Given that the pure 1T-phase is metallic, the gate dependence of the 1T@2H channel is much lower (see the purple curve in Fig. 7b). The gate modulation of the 1T@2H channel is significantly lower than that of the 2H-channel, which has a high On/Off ratio of 105. Because normalized currents with the 1T@2H-phase electrodes are about twice as high as those with the 2H-phase electrodes, the on/off ratios produced by this configuration are slightly better. The Ids–Vds curves for conventional 2H-MoS2/metal-contacted devices (blue line) and 1T@2H-MoS2/metal-contacted devices (red line) with channel lengths of L = 100 μm and W = 10 μm are shown. The 1T@2H-phase contacted device, which exhibits almost linear ohmic behavior, causes a noticeable increase in ON current. This novel method has the potential to make it possible to change the phase of ML-MoS2, a material with applications in electronics, optics, catalysis, and energy collection devices. Because of recent progress in phase transitions and related areas of physics, it is now possible to tell layered materials apart from solid-state materials that do not have layers.102

In Type-III devices, the channel is 1T@2H. (b) Back-gate monolayer MoS2 FET transfer characteristics are shown at Vds = 100 mV. Because of the metallic nature of the 1T phase, the type-III device has an F1T@2H channel that lacks gate modulation. Panels (a and b) adapted with permission from ref. 101.

Fig. 7c shows how the 2H and 1T phases are spread out across the world. Metal-source drain electrodes are only found in the 1T phase region. By making an ohmic junction with the metal electrode, the 1T phase region can connect to the 2H semiconducting channel. MoTe2 FETs have also been made with laser-driven phase engineering methods that do not use Li intercalants,103 demonstrating 50 times better mobility via homojunction manufacturing (Fig. 7d). The results of other studies have come to the same conclusions.104,105
8. Chemical conversion of MoS2 to Mo2C and Mo2C/MoS2 hybrid
The epitaxial production of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) results from the chemical conversion of MoS2 with thermal annealing under CH4 and H2.106 Experiment results show that changing the thermal annealing duration resulted in a completely converted metallic Mo2C from MoS2 and an atomically sharp hybrid structure via partial conversion of the semiconducting 2D material. The low contact resistance (1.2 kΩ·μm) and low Schottky barrier height (26 meV) of Mo2C/MoS2 hybrid junctions indicate the potential value of the materials as a critical hybrid structural building block in the future device applications. Density functional theory calculations are used to model the methods by which Mo2C develops and produces a Mo2C/MoS2 hybrid structure. The findings show that Mo2C conversion begins at the MoS2 edge and progresses through successive hydrodesulfurization and carbide conversion stages, forming an atomically sharp interface with MoS2via epitaxial Mo2C development.

Fig. 8a depicts an optical image of a FET device constructed with a lateral Mo2C/MoS2 junction. Fig. 8b compares the ID–VG transfer curves of a MoS2 FET (L = 2.5 μm, W = 10.2 μm). The red curves represent electrons injected from the Mo2C electrode into the MoS2 channel and measured under positive VDS, whereas the black curves represent electrons injected from the Ti electrode into the MoS2. The n-type transport properties of the Mo2C/MoS2 heterostructure FET devices were comparable to positive and negative VDS. The on-current associated with electron injection from the lateral Mo2C electrode was four times greater than that associated with electron injection from the vertical Ti electrode. Fig. 8c shows the Rc values obtained through gate modulation with various channel sheet resistance values (20 to 1.2 kΩ·μm with Rchannel from 106 to 105 Ω sq−1). The values obtained from the lateral Mo2C/MoS2 junctions were approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the values obtained from the vertical Ti/MoS2 junction.

9. 1L-WS2 lateral homosuperlattices with localized photoluminescence
Homojunctions and homosuperlattices are important structures that have received a lot of attention because of their potential applications in modern electrical and optoelectronic devices. However, managing crystalline phases in 2D monolayers remains challenging, especially when attempting to create lateral homogeneous connections in 1L-TMDs. It presented lateral homosuperlattices with alternating 1T and 2H domains in a 2D 1L-WS2 plane. The junction interfaces and irradiation PL with a lateral periodic distribution in the 2D plane of the 2H domains in homosuperlattices are laterally confined and separated by potential wells. The homosuperlattices research presented here may help to improve the understanding of lateral homojunctions and homosuperlattices on a monolayer plane, providing an alternative path to modulating optical and electrical properties in 1L-TMDs.

Fig. 9a shows a rough model of 1T–2H–1T alternating nanoribbons. Synchronous surface morphology and surface potential measurements were discovered to be useful in identifying and understanding homosuperlattices and their optical properties. The in situ AFM topography in Fig. 9b shows 1L-WS2 with a thickness of about 0.92 nm, according to the white height line profile. Fig. 9c shows a visible contact potential difference between the 1T and 2H phases in the related KPFM image. The surface potential of the 1T domain is higher, and the difference in surface potential between the 1T and 2H domains is approximately 48 mV. Fig. 9d depicts the energy band diagram for the 1T/2HWS2 lateral superlattice. The work function in the KPFM characterization is sensitive to the Fermi level of the 2D material (Table 2).

10. Electrode type and the tunnel barrier
The contact of a vertical 1T′/2H MoTe2 heterostructure does not outperform that of an in-plane 1T′/2H MoTe2 heterostructure, which may be attributed to the tunnel barrier caused by the tiny vdW gap at the interface (Fig. 10a and b).75 Tunnel barriers (caused by planar vdW gaps) plus Schottky barriers (caused by energy) offsets between the Au Fermi level and the electron affinity of 2H-MoTe2 (Fig. 10c).59

11. Summary and prospects
In summary, 2D hetero-phase homojunction has grown in popularity in recent years. This is because efficient carriers in high-performance FETs require low contact resistance. At these junctions, the channel is composed of a semiconducting phase (2H), and the electrodes are in contact with the 1T′ phase. These methods could aid in the development of new electrical and optoelectronic devices. 1T′-MoTe2 is less stable than 2H-MoTe2 due to the higher Te vacancy density in the 1T′ phase. It is necessary to passivate or encapsulate MoTe2 devices with ultrathin channels in an effective and accessible manner.113,114 Until now, the majority of experiments have been conducted on MoTe2, a material with a small band gap. There are no more reports to analyze based on bandgaps. However, the electrical properties and band structures of some 2D TMDs, like MoS2 and ReS2, differ significantly from those of MoTe2, indicating their potential for use in electronic devices with particular purposes. This makes it desirable to explore applying the phase-transition-assisted growth method to additional TMD materials. More research into 2D hetero-phase homojunction with other transient phases is needed to broaden this area. This makes it desirable to explore applying the phase-transition-assisted growth method to additional TMD materials. In MoTe2-based alloys (e.g., MoxW1−xTe2), reduced phase transition energy and emergent quantum state features have been observed.67,115 Future research in these areas could contribute to the development of MoTe2-based devices. Finally, this review discusses how to create high-performance hetero-phase homojunction. These strategies could help with the development of electrical and optoelectronic devices for low-contact resistance. Despite their potential, 2D TMDs with hetero-phase homojunction face challenges. To begin, monolayer 2D hetero-phase homojunctions must be synthesized and characterized, which necessitates precise thickness control and degradation prevention. Second, large-scale patterned heterophase homojunction arrays are required by the semiconductor industry. More investigation into 2D hetero-phase homojunction with other transient phases is needed.
