    , Accepted 24th March 2011First published on 5th May 2011AbstractIn this paper, ZnIn2S4 perpendicular nanosheet films have been directly deposited on FTO substrates by a facile hydrothermal method and investigated as the electrode materials for solar cells. The crystal structure, morphology, and optical properties of the obtained ZnIn2S4 films were characterized by measurements such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) and UV-vis spectra. The results revealed a uniform perpendicular ZnIn2S4 film with thickness of 4 μm and with an average nanosheet thickness of about 30 nm on FTO substrate, along with the band gap of 2.35 eV. The reaction conditions influencing the formation of ZnIn2S4 films, such as the substrate treatment and reaction time were investigated. A possible mechanism for the formation of ZnIn2S4 films on FTO substrates under hydrothermal conditions has been proposed. Furthermore, after heat treatment, the ZnIn2S4 film electrode exhibited a photoelectrical conversion efficiency of 0.23% in FTO/ZnIn2S4/polysulfide/Au liquid-junction solar cell under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2).
1. Introduction
In recent years, semiconducting materials of ternary chalcogenides ABmCn (A = Cu, Ag, Zn, Cd, etc.; B = Al, Ga, In; C = S, Se, Te) have received much attention because they display unique electronic and optical properties.1,2 Among these materials, ZnIn2S4 with a layered structure has attracted intensive studies, due to its potential application in different fields, such as charge storage, electrochemical recording, and photocatalysis.3–5 The absorption of ZnIn2S4 corresponds well with the solar spectrum, hence it is a potential material for energy conversion.6 As the physical/chemical properties of materials have a strong correlation with their shapes, sizes and structures, it is expected that the properties of ZnIn2S4 with novel structures would introduce new applications or enhance the performance of existing applications.7 Therefore, researchers globally have been competing to synthesize novel ZnIn2S4 nanostructures and investigate their potential applications.
Up to now, various ZnIn2S4 nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, and nanorods have been successfully fabricated by a variety of methods.8–10 For example, Gou et al. reported hydro/solvothermal synthesis of ZnIn2S4 nanotubes and nanoribbons using the organic solvents and surfactants.8 Hu et al. synthesized hierarchically ordered porous ZnIn2S4 submicrospheres via microwave-solvothermal process, and investigated their photocatalytic activity by degrading methylene blue.10 However, the attachment of nanostructured ZnIn2S4 material with structurally well-defined morphology onto a conductive substrate has been difficult to achieve and remains as a challenge. This disadvantage imposes barriers in the construction of device because stronger binding of electrode films onto conductive substrate is a necessary prerequisite for the fabrication of devices, especially for solar cells. There were relatively few reports on the deposition of ZnIn2S4 films on conductive glass substrates. The methods available in the literature are either physical deposition or chemical growth methods.11–15 The former includes single-source MOCVD,11 convergent-beam electron diffraction,12 and spray pyrolysis technique,13 which need complex apparatus or processing in noxious atmospheres. Meanwhile, increasing attention has been focused on the fabrication of ZnIn2S4 films by environmentally benign and inexpensive chemical methods, such as electrodeposition (ED)14 and chemical bath deposition (CBD).6 Comparing with the above methods to fabricate ZnIn2S4 films, hydrothermal synthesis as one of the wet chemistry methods can offer the advantages such as (1) inorganic materials with desired morphologies and controlled crystal orientations can be obtained, (2) simple, low-cost and does not require any sophisticated instruments, and (3) large scale synthesis can be achieved in the solution under mild conditions. By employing hydrothermal synthesis, several films have been synthesized recently.15,16 To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the fabrication of ZnIn2S4 film with perpendicular nanosheets structure on the conductive glass by a simple one step hydrothermal method and investigation of their application in solar cells.
Herein, we report on a facile one-pot hydrothermal process to fabricate ZnIn2S4 thin films with perpendicular nanosheets structure on FTO and their photovoltaic application. The formation of the ZnIn2S4 microstructure was associated with the reaction parameters such as the substrate treatment and reaction time. The effects of heat-treatment on the crystalline structure, morphologies and photoelectrical properties of ZnIn2S4 film were also further studied. In addition, a solar cell based on the structure of the FTO/ZnIn2S4/polysulfide/Au has been assembled to investigate its photovoltaic behavior.
2. Experimental
All of the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The FTO conductive glasses (sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1, Huogo, Japan) with dimension of 20 mm × 25 mm × 3 mm were washed with acetone, distilled water and ethanol under ultrasonication for 15 min. In a typical of synthesis of ZnIn2S4 film on FTO substrates, the first step was to treat the FTO conductive glass substrates. The cleaned substrates were soaked in piranha solution (3:1 concentrated H2SO4:30% H2O2) for only 1 min, as longer immersion time would result in the reduction of FTO conductivity,17 and then rinsed thoroughly with copious amount of distilled water.17,18 The FTO glass substrates were then washed in ethanol, dried in air and used for the experiments immediately. The pretreated FTO glass was placed vertically into a 22 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which had been fed with ZnSO4·7H2O (0.4 mmol), InCl3·4H2O (0.8 mmol), C2H5NS (TAA) (1.6 mmol) and 15 mL distilled water and stirred for 30 min. After that, the autoclave was sealed, maintained at 160 °C for 12 h, and cooled naturally to room temperature. Finally, a layer of yellow film was deposited on the FTO glass substrate. And the homogeneous thin film on FTO substrate was thoroughly washed with water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h under vacuum for further characterization. Different reaction times were set to investigate the formation process of the films, and the procedures were similar to the above process, just adjusting the reaction times.
As-obtained ZnIn2S4 films were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, EDS, XPS, and UV-vis techniques. XRD patterns were measured on a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffractometer (Cu K radiation) at a scanning rate of 4° min−1 in the range of 10–80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on JEOL-6700F microscope using an accelerating voltage of 10 kV, attached with EDS. XPS was detected by Kratos Axis Ultra DLD electron spectrometer at an accelerating voltage of 13 kV and a pass energy of 35.75 eV (PHI, PHI5300 system), in which the XPSPEAK software was used for the fitting of the XPS spectrum. TEM and HRTEM images were performed with a Philips Tecnai F20 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. UV-vis absorption spectrum of the film was measured by JASCO V-550. Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells based on ZnIn2S4 electrode before and after heat treatment at 400 °C for 30 min in an Ar atmosphere was evaluated with a device configuration of FTO/ZnIn2S4/polysulfide electrolyte/Au using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The measurement of current density–voltage curves was carried out in the dark and under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), using a XES-151 S solar simulator (San-Ei, Japan). The standard irradiance level (1 Sun conditions, 100 mW cm−2) was set using a calibrated c-Si reference solar cell. The active area of the cell was 0.16 cm2. The Au electrode was obtained by thermal evaporation, and the polysulfide solution electrolyte was the mixture of 1 M Na2S and 1 M S dissolved in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution.
3. Results and discussion
The phase and crystallographic structure of the obtained products were examined by XRD. Fig. 1 shows a typical XRD pattern of the thin film on the FTO conductive glass substrate. Also the XRD for the FTO substrate is shown in Fig. 1 to distinguish the FTO peaks. All the diffraction peak of the films were at 2θ = 21.6°, 28.9°, 32.4° and 47.2°, which could be indexed to planes (006), (102), (104), (112) of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS card No. 72-0773). No other diffraction peaks of impurity phase such as zinc sulfide and indium sulfide were observed besides the peaks that come from FTO glass substrate, indicating a good purity and completed reaction during our process. The photo in the top right of Fig. 1 reveals the FTO glass was covered by yellow ZnIn2S4 material, which adhered to the substrate tightly, and no exfoliation was observed.

The surface and cross section morphologies of the ZnIn2S4 thin film obtained at 160 °C for 12 h were characterized by SEM in Fig. 2. As can be seen in Fig. 2(a), the surface of the FTO conductive substrate was covered by numerous nanosheets. The nanosheets interconnect to form a net-like film, which illuminates that this film has a potentially large surface area. The magnified part showed that the thickness of the nanosheet was about 30 nm and the gap between them was about 300–1000 nm (Fig. 2(b)). From Fig. 2(c–d), it can be seen that numerous nanosheets were uniformly and densely distributed on the substrate. Higher magnification of the sample (Fig. 2(b)) indicates that the nanosheets almost grew perpendicularly against the substrate and constructed a film with the thickness of about 4 μm. The film consisted of a layer of ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles and a secondary layer of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets that attached to the first layer, which possessed thickness of about 1 μm and 3 μm, respectively. It can be speculated that during the reaction nanoparticles first were formed on the substrate and the nanosheets grew on the nanoparticles with further reaction.
The microstructure and composition of the as-obtained nanosheets were further investigated by HRTEM and EDS. Fig. 3(a) displays some individual nanosheets. The size of the nanosheets is about 3 μm, which is consistent with thickness of the film. The high resolution TEM image in Fig. 3(b) exhibits clear lattice fringes with spacing about 3.24 Å calculated from the line profile (inset in Fig. 3(b)), which is in coincident with the interplanar spacing of (102) plane of the hexagonal ZnIn2S4. Fig. 3(c) shows the selected electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, which presents a set of sharp concentric rings that can be well-indexed to the hexagonal phase of polycrystalline ZnIn2S4. And the two rings in the SAED pattern correspond to the (102), (112) reflection direction of the hexagonal ZnIn2S4. The EDS analysis of the nanosheets showed that the chemical components only consisted of Zn, In, and S, and their molar ratio was 1:1.92:4.10 (the signals of Sn, Ca, O and Au are from the FTO glass substrate and sputtered Au, respectively), which is in agreement with the stoichiometric ratio of ZnIn2S4.

The valence states of the ZnIn2S4 thin film were further characterized by XPS measurement. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of the ZnIn2S4 scratched from the film on FTO glass. As can be seen from the survey spectrum (Fig. 4(a)), the oxygen peak at a binding energy of 533.20 eV is due to the presence of H2O absorbed on the sample surface, and no obvious impurities, for In2O3 (O 1s for In2O3: 529.80, 530.30, and 530.50 eV) or chlorine ion, can be detected.19 The Zn 2p core (Fig. 4(b)) splits into 2p3/2 (1022.3 eV) and 2p1/2 (1045.1 eV) peaks, which are all in good agreement with the reported values for Zn2+. Similarly, In 3d shows two peaks at 444.6 eV and 452.2 eV, which are consistent with a valence of +3 (Fig. 4(c)). The S 2p peak of ZnIn2S4 at 162.0 eV (Fig. 4(d)) can be assigned to S2−. All these results indicated that only Zn2+, In3+, S2− were present in the product.

To further investigate on the formation of the ZnIn2S4 films on FTO conductive glass substrates, time dependent experiments were carried out, and SEM images were used to trace the growth process. Fig. 5(a–e) show SEM images of FTO glass substrate, pretreated FTO glass substrate and a series of interesting morphological evolutions of products obtained at the different hydrothermal periods (from 30 min to 24 h) while keeping other experimental conditions such as the temperature and reactants concentration the same. It can be seen that FTO conductive surface was covered by some columnar grains. After piranha treatment, some changes in surface morphology were found. The treatment led to larger, more irregular shaped islands/grains, which favored the adsorption of ions and formation of the film towards the substrate. After they were put into the autoclave and reacted for 30 min, the FTO surface was covered by ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles, which was demonstrated by EDS shown in the inset (Fig. 5(c)). With the hydrothermal reaction time to 6 h, some nanosheets started to grow from the surface and spread sporadically on the substrate (Fig. 5(d)). And these nanosheets could fully cover the substrate and become dense to form a net-like film with a prolonged reaction time. After 18 h, based on the nanosheets fully spreading over the substrate, the film was inhomogeneous, with some region covered by flower-like nanosheets. The magnified part shown in Fig. 5(f, g) revealed that the nanosheets were similar to that obtained at 12 h, and some of these nanosheets could assemble into flower-like microstructures. Under further hydrothermal reaction to 24 h, these flower-like superstructures continued to assemble into microspheres coating onto the surface of nanosheets. These microspheres possessed a diameter of 3–5 μm, which was similar to that of the obtained sedimentary product in the bottom of the autoclave (Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 in ESI†). But these microspheres weakly adhered to the nanosheets. It revealed that the film could grow up to a certain thickness, but was loosened over prolonged reaction time, although the film became thicker.

The insets are their EDS and magnified parts, respectively. SEM images (f) and (g) are magnified parts of image (e). 
The ability to control the crystal phases of multicomponent semiconductor thin films is a key factor for their applications. It was reported that the reaction rate took an important role in the formation of pure ZnIn2S4.8,19 In this reaction, TAA was used not only as the sulfur source but also as the chelated agent to bind the Zn2+ and In3+ ions so as to minimize the precipitation of the corresponding bulk compounds and form films on the substrates.8 In the solution, the Zn2+ and In3+ could coordinate with TAA to form Zn(TAA)n2+ and In(TAA)n3+. Upon heating of the precursor solution, Zn(TAA)n2+ and In(TAA)n3+ generated at the same time can further combined in situ to yield numerous ZnIn2S4 nuclei, in which the S2− was provided by TAA. The slow release of sulfur by TAA was suitable for the formation of ZnIn2S4 and the growth of ZnIn2S4 film on the substrate, revealing the reaction rate was determined by the decomposing rate of the chelated ions and the virtual concentration of free reactant ions. The synthetic reaction can be expressed as follows:  
Based on the SEM images observed for different reaction times and the above discussion, the formation process of netlike ZnIn2S4 nanosheets film during the hydrothermal reaction is proposed and shown in Fig. 6. It was found that the formation of uniform ZnIn2S4 films attached the FTO substrates underwent the following steps: (1) piranha treatment of FTO substrate; (2) formation of hetero-nucleation sites on the substrate surface; (3) growth of ZnIn2S4 film from the nucleation sites. Based on our experiments, FTO substrates without piranha treatment led to poor coverage ZnIn2S4 of the film when keeping other experimental conditions the same, which meant the piranha treatment was indispensable to the formation of the film tightly bound to the substrate. It was believed that a fair amount of surface -OH groups on the FTO surface could be formed by treating FTO with piranha, and then they were deprotonated in absolute ethanol, leaving lots of negatively charged surface oxygen sites.20 After adding reactants, the oxygen sites were presumably bound by chelated Zn and In ions such that the surface-bound [Zn(TAA)n]2+ and [In(TAA)n]3+ ions could subsequently function as nucleation sites for the growth of ZnIn2S4 nuclei. It indicated that the occurrence of heterogeneous nucleation was much more preferential than that of to homogenerous nucleation at the initial stage of reaction, due to the lower interfacial energy between substrate and solution. The growth rate of nuclei was slower because of the initial decomposition rate of the complex ions. And heterogeneous growth of nuclei corresponds to ion-by-ion deposition, resulting in nanoparticles aggregation to form a compact film, which was shown in Fig. 5(c). After the formation of nanparticles, crystal growth was divided into two steps: a mass transport and a surface kinetics process. The reactants were transported from the solution to the solution/substrate interface, leading to deposit on the substrate and crystal growth.21,22 The crystal growth could continue to proceed driven by a steep gradient of the reactants concentration generated around the growing crystals and substrates. With the consuming of the reactants, the process of the crystal growth continued and a layer of nanosheets film adhered to the substrate in the end. It was interesting to find that the nanosheets were perpendicular to the substrate. This phenomenon could be explained by “evolutionary selection” mechanism proposed by Van der Drift,23 which meant only the facets with the highest growth rate and perpendicular to the growth surface would be favorable to the crystal growth. In the case of the ZnIn2S4 nanosheets anisotropic growth, growth in the ab-direction was obviously faster than that in the c-direction, and thus the film became dominated by crystallites growing with their ab-planes perpendicular to the substrate. With the reaction time increasing, the release rate of the chelated ions accelerated and the homogeneous precipitation exceeded the heterogeneous one, and drastic precipitation began, which was dominated by cluster-by-cluster growth. These building units of the precipitate could appear as larger microstructures like nanosheets, which began to combine together to form a porous-like structure on the ZnIn2S4 nanosheets as another layer.24,25 When the reaction was over, the perpendicular nanosheets film was covered by some bulk precipitate in the form of microspheres from the sedimentary products. Consequently, this thicker microspheres film was associated with loose deposition of poor quality films.
 Fig. 6  Schematic process (a) of the FTO treatment by piranha solution and schematic illustration (b) of the growing process of ZnIn2S4 thin films on FTO glass substrates. 
It was demonstrated that the formation of films was determined by the degree of interfacial energy and the strength of coordination bonds of the chelating reagents. The modified FTO substrates could lower the solid/solution interfacial energy for the heterogeneous nucleation and led to adherent and uniform films. We expect that this preliminary mechanism study can shed light on the fabrication of other ternary sulfides by this simple chemical method.
The UV-vis absorbance spectrum of the ZnIn2S4 film obtained at 160 °C for 12 h is shown in Fig. 7. The sample presents a wide absorption in a wavelength range from UV to visible light, especially a strong absorption with a steep shape on the visible edge. The inset shows the band gap of the ZnIn2S4 film estimated from the plots of (αhν)2vs. hν, which was derived from its corresponding UV-vis absorbance spectrum. Due to the direct forbidden, the absorption characteristics of the sample obey the model equation: (αhν)2 = B(hν-Eg), where α is the optical absorption coefficient, h Planck constant, ν the photon frequency, B a constant, and Eg the energy gap.6 The extrapolated value (the straight line to the x-axis) of hν at 0 give an absorption band gap edge Eg corresponding to 2.35 eV. Also, the Eg of ZnIn2S4 samples obtained at 30 min, 6 h, 18 h, and 24 h was estimated to be 2.49, 2.42, 2.33, and 2.30 eV, respectively. It can be seen that the band gap edges of the films deposited with different times were closer to the reported values, in the range of 2.17–2.40 eV.8

The sample configuration of the ZnIn2S4 film directly deposition on FTO conductive glass substrate made easier for device fabrication. Therefore, the ZnIn2S4 film obtained at 160 °C at 12 h was chosen to investigate its photoelectric property, as the film was denser and adhered to the substrate stronger than the other films obtained by fewer time or longer time. The ZnIn2S4 film with an area of about 0.16 cm2 was assembled to form a photochemical cell in the form of FTO/ZnIn2S4/polysulfide/Au. The polysulfide electrolyte of 1 M Na2S and 1 M S dissolved in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution could improve the ZnIn2S4 stability through the oxidation of S2− ions.26,27 The performance parameters of the photoelectrochemical cells are given in Table 1. Fig. 8 shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves for the representative photochemical cells in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, based on the ZnIn2S4 film photoanode before and after heat treatment at 400 °C for 30 min in an Ar atmosphere. It can be seen that the photoelectrochemical cell could attain power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.23%, showing a higher efficiency than that of device (0.08%) with ZnIn2S4 film electrode obtained without heat treatment. This demonstrated that the heat treatment was a necessary step to improve the efficiency of solar cell. It was observed that ZnIn2S4 film remained in its purity and nanosheets structure even after heat treatment (Fig. S3 and Fig. S4 in ESI†). The crystallinity of ZnIn2S4 film was also found to be improved upon comparing the intensity of the ZnIn2S4 diffration peaks at 2θ = 28.9° and 47.2° with the FTO peaks in Fig. 1 and Fig. S3,† respectively. The molar ratio of Zn: In: S in the product was determined to be 1:1.90:4.01 by EDS and the band gap increased to be about 2.45 eV after heat treatment (Fig. S5 in ESI†). It was believed that the reproducible photovoltaic response was due to the novel nanosheets film and the heat treatment. The novel nanosheets film could make the redox couple transport fast between the electrodes through the vertical channels and therefore the decrease in the resistance of the cell and the recombination of the injected electrons.28 Heat treatment could decrease the concentration of defects and produce a recrystallization process to remove secondary phases that were detrimental for the electronic properties of the films.29 Also, heat treatment could facilitate decrease in dislocations, stresses, inhomogeneity, etc.30 Therefore, enhanced excitonic dissociated as well as improved electron transport due to the closer internanosheets resulted in an enhancement of the photovoltaic performance after treatment. The performance of the solar cell based on ZnIn2S4 film obtained by the hydrothermal method in this work is better than those of CdS (η = 0.091%) and SnS (η = 0.1%) thin films over the similar photoelectrochemical cells.31,32 Although the efficiency of our ZnIn2S4 electrode solar cell is lower than that of the well developed solar cells, such as copper indium gallium selenide solar cells, dye sensitized solar cells and silicon solar cells, this is the first demonstration of the photovoltaic behavior of the ZnIn2S4 electrode obtained by the hydrothermal method. In addition, further optimization and investigation such as the improvement of the fabrication, the addition of buffer layer, and doping of ZnIn2S4 film would increase the efficiency and demonstrate a promising application of the obtained ZnIn2S4 film as a photoelectrode in solar cells.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the direct deposition of ZnIn2S4 as perpendicular nanosheets structure on FTO conductive glass substrate by a facile hydrothermal method and their photoelectric applications. It was found that piranha treatment that was employed to modify the surface properties of the FTO conductive glass enhanced the film's uniformity and adhesion on the substrates. Good quality ZnIn2S4 film was obtained at 160 °C for 12 h using a mixed aqueous solution of ZnSO4·7H2O, InCl3·4H2O and TAA. The longer hydrothermal reaction time could lead to thicker film with the combination of nanosheets and microspheres. The optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the ZnIn2S4 nanosheets electrode were investigated; the optical bandgap was 2.35 eV, and photoelectric conversion efficiency of 0.23% was obtained under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The present study suggests an efficient way of sulfide fabrication for their application in nanoscale electric and photoelectric devices.
