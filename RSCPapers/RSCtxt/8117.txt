    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 5th May 2023AbstractThe effective application of solar thermal energy can enormously stimulate the potential of solar energy as a viable alternative to fossil fuel from the analysis of the present conversion efficiencies of solar energy. The efficiency can be further boosted by combining with other forms of solar energy, e.g., electricity. Based on the foregoing standpoint, a strategy of large-scale input of thermal energy superimposed on electricity is proposed for applying solar energy to wastewater purification in this study. The hybrid operation could significantly accelerate the thermodynamic and kinetic rates for chemical reactions. Herein, a reactor named central processing unit (CPU) was designed to serve as the transfer station for wastewater treatment. The CPU allows continuous cleaning of wastewater in contrast to ordinary intermittent processes. Generally, two different experimental systems were set up involving electric-field-induced pyrolysis (media-free) and high-temp-induced electrolysis (filled with solid media). Regarding the former, solar electricity was employed for the field intensity. While for the latter, the electrolysis function was coupled with the field intensity. The optimal treatment effect of the media-free system was obtained at 160 °C with a phenol degradation rate of 37.1% and COD removal rate of 36.04%. The purification operations of the system filled with a solid media were carried out with quartz sand and alumina as the cell fillings, respectively. A markedly improved outcome was achieved at 140 °C, with a degradation rate of 95.57% and COD removal rate of 92.51% in the alumina-mediated unit, while the indices with the quartz sand fillings were 65.68% and 64.15%, respectively. The synergistic strategy of solar utilization and the experimental results present a novel approach for treating wastewater that is efficient, continuous, green, and catalyst-free.
1 Introduction
An abundant and stabilized supply of energy is particularly significant for the prosperity and growth of a country.1 Human demands for energy are rising with the alternation of time, and the issue of resource scarcity has already been exposed. Additionally, the over-exploitation and excessive utilization of resources have led to a slew of inescapable environmental problems, such as global warming and water pollution, which pose serious threat to the survival of humans.2–4 The exploration and development of renewable energy is not only an inevitable trend in global energy structure transformation but a necessary means to alleviate the energy crisis and protect the environment.5–7 Solar energy possesses unmatched resource potential and is expected to substitute fossil fuels in meeting society's needs.8–11 Technologies related to solar utilization have obtained gratifying advancements in addition to conventional solar water heating12,13 and solar power,14,15 for example, solar desalination,16,17 solar pasteurization,18 solar disinfection,19 and solar photocatalysis.20–22
The danger of aquatic pollution lurks beneath the prosperous surface of industry. The common physical means cannot remove pollutants thoroughly. Microorganisms can be easily poisoned and inactivated during biological treatment procedures, and the processing cycles are usually lengthy. Routine chemical methods are incapable of cleaning pollutants in a green manner and have the limitation of secondary contamination. It is thus imperative to seek a facile and eco-friendly route for water purification. Lately, solar interfacial evaporation and solar photocatalysis have flourished in removing pollutants from water. Zhang et al.23 constructed a g-C3N4-based composite sponge solar steam generator for purifying organic wastewater. The degradation rates of methylene blue and rhodamine B were 99.2% and 91.07% after processing for 3 h under 1 sun irradiation, respectively. Chu et al.24 synthesized AgIO3/BiOIO3 heterojunctions by an in situ growth operation with BiOIO3 as the supporting substrates. The separation and migration efficiencies of charge carriers were significantly enhanced due to the high-quality close contact heterojunction interface. Consequently, the degradation rate of 2-sec-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol achieved was 95% under sunlight radiation for 2 h. Summarily, it is evident that the precisely crafted catalysts is pivotal for effective water treatment.
Yet, a relative blank area remains concerning the use of solar thermal and/or solar electric for removing organic contaminants from wastewater, apart from by solar photocatalysis. In recent years, our group have devoted lots of efforts toward the conversion of solar energy, including wastewater purification. Gu et al.25 separately examined the oxidation of nitrobenzene under electric, thermoelectric, and photo–thermal–electric fields. The degradation rate could be increased from 3.6% in a single electric system to 84.9% by triple coupling systems (1.2 V, 60 °C, 1 h) using nanocarbon/TiO2NTs/Ti electrodes. Nie et al.26 treated dye water under superheated conditions in a sealed reactor. The high flux of the solar-thermal energy effectively activated the contaminants and substantially reduced the electrolytic potential. The oxidation of methyl red achieved was 92.68% at 200 °C compared to 29.31% at 20 °C. The researches both demonstrate that the integration of solar heat with electricity could modify/alter the pathways of chemical reactions.27,28
The continuous treatment of wastewater is expected could be realized. In this work, one special central processing unit (CPU) was designed and applied that could allow the long-term uninterrupted degradation of contaminants with a single impetus from solar energy. The concept of dominant high-temp pyrolysis (T > 100 °C) and auxiliary electric field/electrolysis was adopted. The continuous purifying procedures of wastewater used ordinary metal electrodes and proceeded in a catalyst-free manner, in contrast to previous studies. Two different reaction systems were constructed for tuning the electric field intensity and/or electrolysis of solar, where the type of cell fillings included gaseous and solid materials. Quartz sand and alumina were employed as representatives of different surface roughnesses for investigation of the system filled with a solid. Phenol was chosen as the model substance on account of its extraordinary toxicity and tough degradability.29,30 The present research innovates the conventional disposal of wastewater in the liquid phase and achieves the objective of “pollutants could be oxidized once wastewater transited”. The experimental results exhibited that the rational strategy for substantially enhancing solar thermal utilization is suitable for degrading organic pollutants in wastewater.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Hybrid strategy utilizing solar heat with electric energy
Solar utilization in chemistry is the process of converting energy in the solar spectrum to obtain various field energies, such as thermal or electric energy, to act on target chemical reactions. The ratio of different field inputs can be modulated according to the properties of the chemical reactions.31 As described in Fig. 1, the reactions driven by solar energy can be divided into three types: photo, thermal, and electric. Transformation from solar to thermal is always the preferred choice taking the conversion efficiency and operability as the point of departure. Therefore, the purification of organic wastewater could be conducted on the assumption of large amounts of heat input.
 Fig. 1  Hybrid strategy for solar utilization in chemical reactions. 
The oxidation of organic pollutants is endothermic, which means a higher input of heat can promote a positive movement of the reaction. The thermodynamics and kinetics can be strongly strengthened in a high-temperature state, whereby pollutant molecules can reach the excited states rapidly and are then more likely to be removed. The introduction of solar electric can effectively facilitate the breaking of chemical bonds during pyrolysis, resulting in the conversion of stable contaminant molecules to small energy-containing molecules. The degradation pathway of contaminants may be subtly modified and the types or amounts of intermediate substances may be drastically reduces. Fig. S1† displays the theoretical electrolytic potentials of phenol at different temperatures. The trend of the curve indicates that improving the amount of solar thermal energy is conducive to increasing the oxidative degradation of pollutants. This viewpoint is consistent with the synergic energy utilization theory, which confirms the feasibility of the hybrid strategy for use in wastewater treatment.
2.2 Materials and devices

2.2.1 Electrodes. 
Ni was considered as the most suitable electrode material after screening the effectiveness for pollutant degradation as well as price. Nickel sheets and wires were purchased from a professional industrial manufacturer online. During the research, the electrodes were cut into a specific size (10 × 30 mm).


2.2.2 Reactors. 
Corundum crucibles were made with certain dimensions by a crucible manufacturer. The height and the inner diameter of the reactor were about 42.5 mm and 12.3 mm, respectively. The reactor had a total volume of ∼5 mL and could work even at 500 °C.


2.2.3 Solar-thermal unit. 
A solar reflector with a parabolic shape was employed to generate the necessary thermal energy for the reactions. The diameter of the reflector was 150 cm and the maximum temperature it could reach was 500 °C at the focus point.


2.2.4 Solar-electric unit. 
Photovoltaic modules equipped with battery storage devices were used as the power supply. The output voltages/currents of the battery box were regulated by a micro-regulator. More detailed information can be found in the ESI file.† A diagram of the outdoor experiment is shown in Fig. S2.†

2.3 Structure of the CPU

Fig. 2 displays a diagram of the continuous CPU utilized in the experiments, which was composed of a stainless-steel frame and crucible. The top of the corundum crucible was embedded in the annular recess of the bracket, and the bottom was placed in the circular recess of the skeleton. The inlet/outlet tubes inserted in the stainless-steel cover were heat-resistant and could be removed or replaced. The inlet tube was located in the lower part of the reactor, while the outlet tube was positioned in the opposite way. The electrode wires were covered with insulating tubes and the spacing of electrodes was fixed at 10 mm. The crucible and the stainless-steel lid were tightly fixed by bolts and nuts.
 Fig. 2  Structure diagram of the CPU. 
2.4 Experimental procedure
Na2SO4 was used to enhance the conductivity of wastewater. An oil bath device with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 was selected to supply the thermal input in order to ensure uniform heating. Certainly, the energy for heating could be completely supplied by the solar concentrator equipped with a tracking reflector.32,33 The specific CPU was laid in the center of the oil bath, and the variation of temperature was monitored by both a thermocouple and infrared thermometer. Experiments could not be initiated until the reactor reached the preset temperature (120 °C, 140 °C, 160 °C, 180 °C). The battery box providing electricity for the reactions could be charged by solar panels placed on the window.
Phenolic wastewater was injected into the CPU at a constant rate by using a microsyringe pump, which could be powered by a DC–AV converter. The overheating vapor generated from the droplets entered the condensing device through the outlet tube. The condensing unit was a U-shaped absorber bottle with porous glass plate that ensured adequate absorption of the vapor. The amount of liquid intake was kept the same for all the control groups. Accurate measurements of the liquid volume before and after the reaction were made. Several repetitive experiments were performed with identical parameters and the data presented in the following sections were the average of repeated experiments.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Media-free system (electro-field-induced pyrolysis)

3.1.1 Effect of temperature. 
Droplets reached boiling point instantaneously under the action of the superheated field and then filled the whole CPU as vapor. The intensity of the thermolysis and the reaction kinetics were both strengthened, which led to more pollutants being degraded. Nevertheless, it was not a case of: the higher the temperature, the better the removal effect of pollutant. The degradation rates of phenol actually presented a downward trend when T > 160 °C, as shown in Fig. 3a. The reason for this phenomenon was the ultrafast movement of molecules, which accelerated the outflow of vapors. As a result, a portion of the pollutants entered the condensation unit without sufficient thermal oxidation. The COD removal rates achieved the top rates at 160 °C, which was similar to the case of the degradation rates. The short residence time of the pollutants in the reactor resulted in a high COD solution (180 °C), despite the high-heat conditions shortening the degradation pathway of phenol and lessening the incomplete oxidation stages.
 Fig. 3  Degradation rate of phenol and removal rate of COD in the media-free system (a) under a single field of thermal energy; (b) under the hybrid fields of thermal and electric energy. 


3.1.2 Effect of the electric field. 
The wastewater vaporized and spread as the tiny droplets were subjected to high temperatures. Due to the reasons above-mentioned, the probability of inelastic collisions was elevated between the high-energy electrons and vapor molecules after the introduction of the extra electric field. More active species were generated by the stimulation of solar electric energy. Consequently, a wide range of complex and miscellaneous chemical reactions could be triggered, including the oxidation of phenol.

Fig. 3b shows the results of the synergistic effect of the thermal and electric fields. The optimum thermal parameter was 140 °C in terms of the degradation increment, in which the hybrid process was higher than the single field process by 8.02%. A weaker joint action of the two fields was visible at 180 °C due to the dominant role of the high heat. However, the mineralization could be kept at a higher level. The reason for this may be that the oxidative degree of the pollutants was effectively deepened under the electric field effect, resulting in a fast and direct oxidation of phenol to CO2.


3.1.3 Effect of the feed rate. 
The thermal atmosphere and the inlet unit are particularly important for purifying wastewater continuously. Accordingly, the effects of the feed rate on the treatment of phenol were investigated with the condition that each droplet could be vaporized individually. Apparently, the frequency of wastewater injected into the CPU was improved when the speed of the feedstock increased. However, the hot vapor escaped fleetingly before being effectively treated by the thermoelectric field if the next drop entered the reactor while the previous drop had evaporated but not fully diffused. The degradation level of contaminants was restricted by the narrower diffusion space and the shorter exposure time. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the purification results for wastewater were negatively correlated with the increase in feed rate, whereby the COD values were affected more obviously by the feed rates.
 Fig. 4  Degradation rate of phenol and removal rate of COD at different feed rates in the media-free system (under the hybrid fields of thermal and electric energy). 
On balance, the continuous degradation of pollutants in the media-free system was a complicated process, in which three variables adjusted and constrained each other. The temperature and feed rate controlled the residence time of phenol, which in turn maintained the utilization efficiency of the electric field. The electric field and feed rate could be used as feedback to the system to aid selecting the most suitable temperature. The temperature and electric field restricted the rational range of the liquid feed rate. Besides, the feed rate was also limited by the fixed reactor volume. Theoretically, the smaller the reactor volume, the slower the feed rate should be to ensure that each drop can diffuse individually. Hence, only one best matching feed rate exists when the reactor volume is fixed, as well as when the effects of heat and electricity are superimposed.

3.2 System filled with quartz sand (high-temp-induced electrolysis)
It was clear from the experiments with the media-free section that the degradation of pollutants could be ameliorated by prolonging the residence time in the CPU. Therefore, the following research overlies the influence of the “filling bed” on the system. van der Waals forces will form between contaminants and particles due to the nature of the solid particles. The high-heat environment for an extended period could be successfully established with the help of the cell fillings. Diverse sorts of solid media with smooth and rough surfaces were tested in the subsequent researches, and the influencing factors, such as temperature and electricity, were explored separately. Differently, solar-electro was utilized in the form of electrolysis superimposed on the electric field here rather than the application of a single field.
Quartz sand with smooth surface was selected as the filling layer at first. For the non-porous media, the diffusion paths for wastewater were mainly the gaps between each solid particle. The wastewater formed a thin disc-shaped liquid film on the surface of the filling medium after leaving the end of the inlet pipe. The liquid film might be torn into a lot of tiny droplets before vaporization on the high-temp solid surface.34 Those droplets vaporized upwards through the gaps among the particles presenting irregular cylindrical diffusion paths with weak edges (Fig. 5). The retention time of the pollutants could be significantly extended due to the blocking effect of the particles, besides from the adhesion forces too. We found that a reduction in the particle size of the non-porous fillings could improve the removal rates of pollutants after the pre-experiments, which could be attributed to the fact that the paths of wastewater through the filling bed became more tortuous. Unfortunately, fillings in smaller dimensions brought unnecessary troubles to the experiments, such as being carried to the condensation system with the flow or generating coagulation with the droplets, both of which disturbed the stability of the system to a certain degree. The proper size (120–180 mesh) of quartz sand was drawn after the test comparisons.

3.2.1 Effect of temperature. 
Both the degradation rates of phenol and the removal rates of COD under pure thermal action attained better levels compared with the unfilled system, as shown in Fig. 6a. The two indicators mentioned were 38.78% and 37.43% higher than that of the unfilled system at 140 °C, respectively. However, starting from 160 °C, the thermal effect of the solid fillings might cause a vapor layer to develop between the media surface and wastewater,35 which could weaken the adhesion of the solid media and pollutants, resulting in a faster release of the pollutants. Moreover, the high-temp environment also lessened the diffusive liquid film area. The time and space for phenol to cross the packed fillings were doubly limited, which was ultimately reflected in the reduction of the degradation rates. Notwithstanding this, the degradation increment of phenol at 180 °C was still 13.46% higher than that of the best of the media-free systems with the single thermal field, while the COD removal rate was higher by 11.31%.
 Fig. 6  Degradation rate of phenol and removal rate of COD in the system filled with quartz sand (a) under a single field of thermal energy; (b) under the hybrid fields of thermal and electric energy. 


3.2.2 Effect of solar-electric energy. 
Filling bed in continuous system coupled with the electric field could improve the removal rates of pollutants and intensify the role of the solid medium. A liquid film was formed on the surface of the granules before being vaporized. The electric field polarized and charged the particles under the action of the “liquid bridge” formed by the thin film. Each particle could be regarded as an individual electric field. The degradation rates of phenol could be certainly heightened by the efforts of micro electrolysis. Electrochemistry could oxidize approximately 7% of the additional pollutants when the temperature was below 160 °C compared to the single thermal action (Fig. 6b). Whereas the liquid film exhibited transient behavior and could even be disconnected with the intervention of superheat. Thereby, the duration of electrolysis was shortened and the effect got correspondingly worse. The degradation rate of phenol under the mixing field was just increased by 3.19% at 180 °C, and the increment in the COD removal rate was even lower. As portrayed in Fig. 6b, the optimal temperature was 140 °C, whereby the degradation rate was 65.68% and the COD removal rate was 64.15%.

3.3 System filled with alumina (high-temp-induced electrolysis)
From the conclusions summarized in the previous experiments, it is possible to infer that the residence time of the pollutants could be further extended by using porous media instead of non-porous medium. Hence, Al2O3 (100–140 mesh) was selected as the new cell fillings, which could offer prominent thermal stability and stable mechanical strength as a solid material with intricate structure and abundant distribution of pores. The adsorption capacity of the fillings on the pollutants was tested to eliminate potential interferences before the treatment of wastewater. Fig. S4† shows that the concentration of phenol could be maintained around the initial 200 ppm. Likewise, the reacted fillings underwent the same treatment process and the conclusion was consistent that the experimental results were not affected by the adsorption properties of the media.

3.3.1 Effect of temperature. 
The pores of the cell fillings provide various meandering escape routes for wastewater compared to the non-porous medium with smooth surface. Water was evenly distributed among the internal voids and external liquid films of Al2O3 (Fig. 5). Regardless of the academic limitations, if the filling effect of quartz sand can be regarded as a crow drinking water, then the effect of Al2O3 seems to be as a sponge absorbing water. The integral purification operation is just like sucking up water with a sponge and then squeezing the water out, yet the pollutants in wastewater can be removed by the hybrid thermoelectric process during this process.
The degradation rate of pollutants reached 80.25% at 140 °C with the efficacy of the thermal field alone, as shown in Fig. 7a. This promising consequence confirmed that Al2O3 would be a preeminent filling in the continuous system. In the course of pyrolysis, parts of the contaminants were converted into homologs or intermediates and then released into the condensation unit immediately due to the excessive molecular vibrational frequencies and movement velocities. Eventually, the removal rate of COD decreased from 71.53% to 48.46% when the temperature was increased from 140 °C to 180 °C. However, the rate at 180 °C was still about 10% higher than that in the quartz sand system in the same condition.
 Fig. 7  Degradation rate of phenol and removal rate of COD in the system filled with alumina (a) under the single field of thermal energy; (b) under the hybrid fields of thermal and electric energy. 


3.3.2 Effect of solar-electric energy. 
Compared with the liquid film on the surface of quartz sand, the mode of capillary diffusion showed greater continuity and uniformity. As such, the role of electricity could be boosted by Al2O3 even further. From the results described in Fig. 7b, the degradation rate of phenol reached 95.57% at 140 °C under the synergistic treatment, while the COD removal rate outstripped by 20.98% that achieved under the condition without electrolysis.
An experimental phenomenon appeared whereby the detectable current increased from zero to a fixed value and then returned to zero during the purification of wastewater when the electric field was introduced. The magnitude of the current was at the microampere level with the low electric intensity but could reach the milliamp or even amp level as the voltage continually increased; whereas, the duration of the current tended to change in the opposite way with the temperature increasing.
More energetic electrons could be generated by increasing the potential, which could strengthen the electrolysis behaviors of the continuous system toward pollutants. From the curves depicted in Fig. 8, the oxidizing effect of the pollutants was proportional to the amplification in solar-electro energy. Clearly, the COD removal rates were more affected by the electricity than the degradation rates. The reason was that the formation of active substances occurred more easily with the action of high voltage, and the pollutants could react with the actives more adequately. In addition, a portion of the phenol could be oxidized to CO2 in one step by electrolysis. As a result, the removal rates of COD were greatly improved. The degradation rate of phenol was 95.57% and the COD removal rate of wastewater was 92.51% under the hybrid fields of thermal and electro energy at 140 °C.

3.3.3 Recycling of Al2O3. 
The cell fillings play an indispensable role in the consecutive wastewater purification process. Meanwhile, the cost of technology should be taken into account, though there are no catalysts required. Therefore, it was necessary to examine the reusability of Al2O3. The rough oval granular surface of the filler could be seen at low magnification in Fig. 9a, while the bumpy surface was presented upon further magnification, as shown in Fig. 9b. The microscopic morphology of Al2O3 showed no changes when comparing the SEM images before and after use (Fig. 9c and d), which indicated the high-temp coupled electric process driven by solar did not cause damage to the skeletons of the particles.

Fig. 10 presents the XRD comparison of the medium. It can be observed that the crystal morphology and lattice strength of Al2O3 were maintained and the positions of the characteristic peaks did not shift. In conclusion, the solid fillings could be recycled after sonicating, washing, acidifying, and drying. Further experiments confirmed that the cell fillings could still retain a high level of capability for the purification of pollutants.

4 Prospects for power generation coupled with wastewater treatment
The applications of solar heat are the simplest and most convenient, both in daily life and experimental research on solar energy. Environmentally benign treatment processes of wastewater driven by renewable energy have long been on the agenda. Therefore, solar energy has been utilized in many areas, including thermal power generation36,37 and water purification.26,33 This section discusses and presents a schematic diagram of the prospects for simultaneous solar thermal power generation coupled with wastewater treatment in order to fully understand the theory of the hybrid solar energy strategy in this work.
The synergistic system comprising solar thermal power and wastewater treatment derived from the continuous system is shown in Fig. 11, which mainly consists of the central solar tower, PV module array, low/high-temperature molten salt storage tanks, and other devices. Heliostats can be employed to converge the sun's rays and to focus them on the heat receiver of the central tower,38,39 where the molten salt (KCl, KNO3, or eutectic mixed molten salts39) could be heated. Wastewater from industry can be pumped to the top of solar power plants and can exchange heat with the molten salts.40 A same unit could be set up in the central tower according to the concept of filling bed. The high-temp media could make the wastewater rapidly vaporize, which in turn would generate steam to drive a steam turbine. Furthermore, an electric field powered by solar panels or steam generators could be introduced to achieve thorough mineralization of wastewater. Also, maybe a gravity power generation unit could be designed for cleaning wastewater that has not been oxidized by solar energy based on the model structure data of the central tower. Besides, this part of the wastewater could be pumped into the filling layer cyclically. The molten salt storage device could provide the sustainable and steady power output even in the absence of light. The application model of the continuous system is a mechanical procedure that does not require much human intervention, from the viewpoint of practical purposes. The dual objectives of wastewater treatment and solar power generation would thus be achieved in an environmentally burden-free manner.

5 Conclusion
A novel strategy coupling hyper-thermal energy with electrochemical processes was designed to improve the utilization efficiency of solar energy in chemical reactions. Herein, the degradation of organic pollutants was accomplished by adopting more heat and less electricity. The special CPU was used to achieve the continuous treatment of wastewater mechanically with solar energy as the only power source. The reaction systems filled with different media were discussed depending on the types of solar electric field/electrolysis processes. The temperature, electric field, and liquid feed rate were mutually restricted and coupled in the electro-induced pyrolysis system (media-free). The degradation rate of phenol under the hybrid stage was improved by 5.08% compared with the single action of thermal, while the COD removal rate was enhanced by 9.63% (T = 160 °C). The superiority of fillings with rough surfaces was more prominent in the high-temp-induced electrolysis system (filled with solid media). The degradation rates of phenol and COD were 95.57% and 92.51% at 140 °C when Al2O3 was chosen as the padding with the synergistic action of pyrolysis and electrolysis. The Al2O3 was proved to be reusable by SEM and XRD analyses. Overall, the continuous and eco-friendly technology is proposed to remove organic pollutants from wastewater, which offers a new way for achieving water purification.
