    , Accepted 7th August 2019First published on 9th August 2019AbstractDesign of a green and sustainable approach for H2O2 synthesis is a meaningful subject. Herein, we propose a piezo-catalytic method for H2O2 production by utilizing a metal-free g-C3N4 catalyst, which has high activity for generating H2O2 only from H2O and O2 under ultrasonic vibration by means of converting mechanical energy to chemical energy. Without any organics, the ultrasonic-driven generation rate of H2O2 reached 34 μmol h−1. KMnO4 reduction experiments confirmed the generation of polarized electrons for g-C3N4 under ultra-sonication, while Au deposition on the edge of g-C3N4 after piezo-catalytic reduction of HAuCl4 indicated that the ultrasonic-derived piezoelectric polarization over g-C3N4 was along the g-C3N4 plane. The construction of C or N vacancies could change the piezoelectric response of g-C3N4, which was confirmed by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), and the result showed that the g-C3N4 containing C or N vacancies exhibited a weaker piezoelectric effect and poorer ultrasonic-assisted catalytic performance than pristine g-C3N4 due to the impairment of the crystal structure. Our work reports the piezo-catalytic effect of g-C3N4 and it may help provide a green and sustainable process of generating H2O2 directly from water and oxygen.
1. Introduction
As an important and green oxidant, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is widely used in chemical synthesis, bleaching and disinfection fields.1,2 H2O2 has also received much attention as an ideal energy carrier in fuel cells, replacing conventional H2 in virtue of its liquid form and safety.3 Currently, H2O2 is mainly produced by the anthraquinone method.4 Despite its large-scale production, some practical challenges still exist, such as industrial waste handling for the complex process, the requirements for Pd-based catalysts and energy substances of H2. A green and sustainable approach capable of producing H2O2 without noble metals and H2 is therefore desired.
Photocatalytic H2O2 production from H2O and O2 on semiconductors is one of the approaches that meet the above requirements.5,6 Nevertheless, the yield of H2O2 in the photocatalytic process is pretty low (∼1 μmol h−1). Recently, the piezo-catalytic effect of piezoelectric materials has attracted considerable attention.7,8 When applied with an external mechanical force, a strong piezoelectric polar field will be generated over these piezoelectric materials, while piezoelectric-induced electron–hole pairs separate under the polar field and result in catalytic performance on the material's surface. In 2010, Xu's group first proposed this new concept of piezoelectrochemical (PZEC) effect (also named the piezo-catalytic effect) and achieved direct water splitting through vibrating piezoelectric microfibers in water with an ultrahigh energy conversion efficiency of ∼18%.9 After piezo-catalytic water splitting, the piezo-catalytic effect has been subsequently employed in addressing environmental issues which include the elimination of rhodamine B10 and 4-chlorophenol,11 as the piezoelectric-induced electron–hole pairs can react with O2 or H2O and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as ˙O2− and ˙OH.12 However, there is still no report on H2O2 synthesis by coupling the piezoelectric and catalytic properties.
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a metal-free polymeric material which mainly comprises earth-abundant carbon and nitrogen elements, has attracted much attention due to its layered structure, easy preparation, and advanced performance in photocatalytic and electrochemical applications.13–18 For layered materials, the presence of gradients and asymmetrical structures can lead to apparent piezoelectric response,19 such as the piezoelectric effect induced by triangular-shaped holes in graphene nanoribbons20 and piezoelectricity in odd number layers of transition metal dichalcogenides.21 The piezoelectric properties of two-dimensional g-C3N4, which are caused by the presence of flexoelectricity and nanoscale triangular-shaped non-centrosymmetric holes, have been proved both theoretically by ab initio calculations and experimentally by state-of-the-art piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM).22 In addition, the ring structure of graphitic carbon nitride endows it with rich pyridine nitrogen sites which are demonstrated to be active sites for oxygen adsorption and activation.23,24 Combining all the above desirable properties, nonmetal g-C3N4 is therefore considered to be an ideal material for H2O2 production via the piezo-catalytic process.
In this work, g-C3N4 has been applied in catalytic oxygen reduction for generating H2O2 based on its piezoelectric properties. The piezo-catalytic effect of g-C3N4 was confirmed by a KMnO4 reduction experiment, while an Au deposition experiment was carried out to determine the direction of the polar field for g-C3N4 under ultrasonic waves. Without any organics, the generation rate of H2O2 from H2O and O2 can reach 34 μmol h−1. By controlling the energy input and reaction atmosphere, we confirmed that the power for H2O2 generation was from ultrasonic energy and the formed H2O2 came from the reaction of O2 and H2O. Moreover, we found that pristine g-C3N4 showed a stronger piezoelectric effect than g-C3N4 containing C or N vacancies as observed from piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), which was considered to result from the integrity of triangular-shaped non-centrosymmetric holes of pristine g-C3N4. Accordingly, pristine g-C3N4 exhibited higher H2O2 production than g-C3N4 containing C or N vacancies, despite g-C3N4 containing C or N vacancies possessing larger specific surface area.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
All chemicals were of analytical grade purity and obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd and used as received without further purification.

Bulk g-C3N4. 
Bulk g-C3N4 was prepared by the thermal polycondensation of melamine as follows: 5 g of melamine powder was put into an alumina crucible with a cover and heated to 520 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, then to 540 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 for another 2 h. The resultant yellow product was collected and ground into powder for further use.


Cv/Nv-C3N4. 
Cv-C3N4 (g-C3N4 containing C vacancies) was synthesized by calcining the as-prepared g-C3N4 in a tube furnace at 520 °C under an Ar flow for 2 h. Nv–C3N4 (g-C3N4 containing N vacancies) was synthesized by calcining the as-prepared g-C3N4 in a tube furnace at 520 °C under a N2 flow for 2 h.

2.2 Materials characterization
The samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction on a Rigaku powder diffractometer, and were scanned by using Cu Kα radiation with an operating voltage of 30 kV and operating current of 100 mA. A scan rate of 4° min−1 was applied to record the patterns in the range of 10–70°. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi 3010) equipped with an integrating sphere. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEOL JEM-2100F. The piezoelectric response of the as-prepared sample was characterized using an atomic force microscope (SPA-300HV) equipped with a ferroelectric test system. In a typical procedure of sample preparation for the piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) test, a drop of sample suspension was dispersed on a Si substrate coated with Pt by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution were measured using a surface area and pore size analyzer (V-sorb 2008 P, Gold APP).
2.3 Piezo-catalytic measurement

Reduction of KMnO4. 
g-C3N4 (100 mg) and KMnO4 (40 mg L−1) were added to 100 mL of pure water in a 500 mL Pyrex glass and thoroughly mixed by stirring. After that, the glass was placed in an ultrasonic cleaner (SK2200HP). With stirring, the suspension was treated by ultrasonic waves. The resultant supernatant was obtained by filtration. The concentration of resultant KMnO4 solution was determined by absorption spectrophotometry using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi 3010) equipped with an integrating sphere. The precipitate was collected and termed MnOx/C3N4. All the above reactions were carried out in the dark at night.


Au deposition on g-C3N4. 
g-C3N4 (100 mg) and HAuCl4 (containing 2 mg of Au element) were added to 100 mL of pure water in a 500 mL Pyrex glass and thoroughly mixed by stirring. After that, the glass was placed in an ultrasonic cleaner (SK2200HP). With stirring, the suspension was treated by ultrasonic waves. All the above reactions were carried out in the dark at night. The resultant products (termed US-1, US-2, and US-3, corresponding to the ultrasonic times of 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min, respectively) were centrifuged and washed with pure water. Au–Cv-C3N4 and Au–Nv-C3N4 were prepared by the same process with an ultrasonic time of 60 min. The above samples were then dried at 60 °C for 4 h for further characterization. The preparation of Xe–C3N4 (irradiation time of 60 min, termed Xe–C3N4) was analogous to that of US-3 except for replacing ultrasonic treatment with Xe light irradiation.


Piezo-catalytic H2O2 production. 
Normally, 0.05 g of sample was dispersed in 100 mL of pure water. The generation of H2O2 in air was carried out in a 500 mL Pyrex glass in an ultrasonic cleaner (SK3200HP) with stirring (300 rpm) using a power-driven stirrer (D2004W). The power of the ultrasonic cleaner is 150 W and the frequency is 53 kHz. The experiments in highly pure Ar, N2, O2 and air atmospheres were carried out in a 600 mL sealed double-deck Pyrex glass in the above ultrasonic cleaner. The amount of H2O2 in solution was determined by the iodometry method via a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi 3010) equipped with an integrating sphere. All the above reactions were carried out in the dark at night.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Proof of the piezo-catalytic effect of g-C3N4
The piezoelectric effect of g-C3N4 has been reported for years.22 However, the piezo-catalytic effect of g-C3N4 has never been investigated. An experiment to determine the piezo-catalytic effect is therefore needed. KMnO4 is a common oxidant whose strong spectral absorption peaks at 525 nm and 545 nm make it a promising titration reagent. In previous reports of the solar-to-chemical process, KMnO4 was used to determine the quantity of H2O2 by titration.6 Besides, it was also reported that KMnO4 can directly react with electrons.25 Thus, the reaction between KMnO4 and piezoelectricity-induced electrons or H2O2 was a good approach to verify the piezo-catalysis of g-C3N4. First, to exclude the possible reduction of KMnO4 only with ultrasonic waves, we treated KMnO4 under ultrasonic vibration in the absence of g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 1a, the absorbance of KMnO4 showed no decrease over time without adding g-C3N4, while the unexpected slight increase might be ascribed to the evaporation of H2O in the solution. This result eliminated the possibility of self-reduction of KMnO4 under ultrasonic treatment. In contrast, the KMnO4 in the suspension of g-C3N4 under ultrasonication was efficiently and continuously reduced (Fig. S1†), demonstrating the piezo-catalytic effect of g-C3N4. From UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) (Fig. 1b), compared with those of pristine g-C3N4, it can be found that the absorbance of the resultant g-C3N4 was improved in the full spectrum after KMnO4 reduction, which could be due to MnOx deposition on g-C3N4 after KMnO4 reduction. This result confirmed that the electrons can be generated over g-C3N4 with ultrasonic waves and they can participate in chemical reactions.

To figure out the direction of the ultrasonic-derived polar field in g-C3N4, experiments of piezo-catalytic reduction of Au3+ in the suspension of g-C3N4 with ultrasonic waves were carried out, as the preferential deposition of the noble metal reflects the migration of polarized electrons.25,26 The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of samples prepared by the piezo-catalytic process and photochemistry deposition are shown in Fig. 2. Compared with pristine g-C3N4, it can be found that the DRS of the Xe–C3N4 sample prepared by HAuCl4 photochemistry deposition showed enhanced absorbance, while the apparent peak (at about 550 nm) indicated the characteristic surface plasma resonance absorbance of Au nanoparticles.26 With respect to samples prepared by piezo-catalytic HAuCl4 reduction with different ultrasonic times, it can be seen that the absorbance at 500–800 nm gradually increased and the characteristic peak of Au nanoparticles became more and more prominent with the prolongation of ultrasonic time, which could be ascribed to the increasing Au deposition on g-C3N4, manifesting the reactive properties of polarized electrons and the piezo-catalytic effect of g-C3N4 further.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was subsequently employed to observe Au deposited g-C3N4 samples. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, Au particles were deposited on the surface of g-C3N4 by the piezo-catalytic method and photochemical method, respectively. In Fig. 3b, it can be found that Au particles prepared by the photochemical method (Xe–C3N4) were randomly deposited on the surface of g-C3N4, since every surface part of g-C3N4 could be excited under irradiation of Xe light and photo-induced electrons diffused in disorder. The corresponding schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 3d. In comparison, Au particles which were formed by the piezo-catalytic process (US-3) exhibited the shape of a plate and preferred to deposit on the edges of g-C3N4 (Fig. 3a), and none of the Au nanoparticles were observed in the plane of g-C3N4 (Fig. S2†). In general, the preference of Au deposition can reflect the transport of electrons. The result for US-3 indicated that electrons preferred to diffuse to the edges of samples instead of randomly distributing on the plane. Analogous phenomena of oriented migration of carriers have been reported in photochemistry and piezo-photocatalytic fields,27–29 in which the internal electric field was considered as the original driving force for carrier separation. Considering the layered structure of g-C3N4 and the source of the piezoelectric effect which comes from asymmetric triangular holes in the g-C3N4 plane, it is suggested that the ultrasonic-derived piezoelectric polarization of g-C3N4 was along the g-C3N4 plane, while the generated piezoelectric polarization field served as the driving force for the electrons’ oriented migration. The corresponding schematic diagrams are shown in Fig. 3c.

3.2 Piezo-catalytic H2O2 production
In view of the fact that piezo-induced electrons of g-C3N4 reacted with KMnO4 and HAuCl4, there is a big possibility that these electrons could also react with O2 and contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), so as to produce H2O2 in a green way. Therefore, experiments of producing H2O2 over g-C3N4 with ultrasonic waves were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4a, the yield of the H2O2 product in the suspension of g-C3N4 increased linearly with ultrasonic time, and the production rate of H2O2 reached 34 μmol h−1 without any scavengers, which is higher than the average level of H2O2 produced by the solar-to-chemical process (Table S1†). When the power of ultrasonic waves was downshifted to 50% of full power, the yield of H2O2 decreased to 10 μmol h−1 (Fig. 4a), indicating that higher power will contribute to a higher formation rate. Furthermore, the H2O2 product was negligible in the absence of g-C3N4, which proved that g-C3N4 was indispensable for ultrasonic-driven H2O2 generation. XRD, DRS and FTIR characterization of g-C3N4 showed that neither impurities nor extra phases existed before and after piezo-catalytic reactions, evidencing the stability of g-C3N4 during ultrasonic treatment (Fig. S3†).

(c) Ultrasonic-driven H2O2 production at different atmospheres for 0.5 h. (d) The schematic diagram of ultrasonic-driven generation of H2O2 over g-C3N4. 
To exclude the influence of mechanical energy input of stirring, a comparative trial was carried out in the absence of ultrasonic waves. No H2O2 was detected with different stirring speeds in the absence of ultrasonic waves, indicating that the energy for H2O2 generation was derived from ultrasonic energy. However, when applied with different stirring speeds, the production rate of H2O2 under ultrasonic treatment varied considerably. As shown in Fig. 4b, the highest H2O2 yield was obtained at a stirring speed of 100 rpm, while a higher stirring speed led to lower H2O2 production, which is possibly attributed to the fact that high stirring speed may impede the propagation of ultrasonic waves. Nevertheless, the production rate of H2O2 decreased dramatically without stirring. It is expected that H2O2 is derived from the interaction between O2 and H2O on g-C3N4, and stirring is helpful for the diffusion of O2. To verify the above hypothesis, experiments of controlling the reaction atmosphere were conducted to determine the role of O2 in the process of generating H2O2. As shown in Fig. 4c, when the atmosphere was O2, 3.4 μmol of H2O2 was obtained in the suspension of g-C3N4 with ultrasonic waves. In contrast, the H2O2 product was negligible when the atmosphere was N2 or Ar. Therefore, ultrasonic-driven H2O2 generation was considered to derive from the oxygen reduction reaction with H2O, and the schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 4d.
The mechanism for hydrogen peroxide production is suggested to derive from two pathways: one is the oxygen reduction reaction with piezoelectric-induced electrons and the other is the water oxidation reaction with piezoelectric-induced holes. O2 + e− → ˙O2−(1) ˙O2− + e− + 2H+ → H2O2(2) 2H2O + 2h+ → H2O2 + 2H+(3)
To explore the reaction path of H2O2 generation, experiments of introducing scavengers were performed. Benzoquinone (BQ) is used as a hydroxyl radical scavenger, while isopropanol (IPA) is a common superoxide radical scavenger. As shown in Fig. 5, compared with pure g-C3N4, the H2O2 yield decreased intensely with the addition of BQ, demonstrating that the superoxide radical was the intermediate of H2O2 generation. Interestingly, H2O2 production increased a lot after adding IPA, indicating that the hydroxyl radical was not a key point for H2O2 generation.

3.3 Correlation between the piezoelectric effect and piezo-catalytic performance
Current research studies of the piezo-catalytic effect have reported some factors which determine the piezo-catalytic performance of piezoelectric materials, such as the length and free charge of the piezo-catalyst.9,30 However, few literature reports discussed the intrinsic correlation between the piezoelectric effect and piezo-catalytic performance, which is of high importance to reveal the nature of piezo-catalysis. Considering the fact that the piezoelectric effect of g-C3N4 derives from nanoscale triangular-shaped non-centrosymmetric holes in the g-C3N4 plane, destroying the structure of g-C3N4 is expected to change the asymmetry of the g-C3N4 plane so as to adjust the piezoelectric effect. It has been reported that C vacancies and N vacancies could be created in the plane of g-C3N4 through thermal treatment in Ar and N2 flow, respectively.31–33 Herein, g-C3N4 containing C vacancies and N vacancies (denoted as Cv-C3N4 and Nv-C3N4) were prepared to investigate the correlation between the piezoelectric effect and piezo-catalytic performance.
XRD patterns of all the as-prepared samples exhibited obvious characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to graphite carbon nitride (Fig. 6a). In comparison with the diffraction of pristine g-C3N4, g-C3N4 containing C or N vacancies seemed to show no difference, indicating the well maintained crystalline phase after thermal treatment at Ar/N2 flow. However, from DRS in Fig. 6b, it can be found that Cv-C3N4 and Nv-C3N4 exhibited higher absorbance than pristine g-C3N4 in the visible light region, while Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement (Fig. S3†) showed that Cv-C3N4 (9.5 m2 g−1) and Nv-C3N4 (8.6 m2 g−1) possessed a larger specific surface area than pristine g-C3N4 (5.8 m2 g−1).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further performed to investigate the chemical compositions of carbon nitride samples. As shown in Fig. 6c, the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s for all samples could be fitted with three peaks at binding energies of 287.9, 286.4, and 284.6 eV, which were allocated to N–CN coordination in the carbon nitride framework, C–NHx (x = 1, 2) on the edges of heptazine units, and C–C groups of adventitious carbon, respectively.34 Apparently, the signals of N–CN for Cv-C3N4 and Nv-C3N4 were weakened compared with pristine g-C3N4, indicating the destruction of the carbon nitride framework after heat treatment with Ar or N2 flow due to the creation of defects. In addition, the area ratios of the N–CN peak to the C–C peak for pristine g-C3N4 and Cv-C3N4 were calculated to be 15.5 and 14.0, respectively. The decreased percentage of the carbon framework supports the existence of carbon vacancies in Cv-C3N4. With respect to the high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s (Fig. 6d), they could also be fitted with three peaks at binding energies around 398.3, 399.8, and 400.9 eV, which correspond to bi-coordinated (N2C) and tri-coordinated (N3C) nitrogen and NHx (x = 1 and 2) groups, respectively.34 It can be seen that the signal intensities of N2C in the frameworks of Cv-C3N4 and Nv-C3N4 declined in comparison with pristine g-C3N4, proving the formation of carbon or nitrogen defects further. As such, the peak area ratios of the N2C to N3C peak decreased from 5.6 to 4.5 for pristine g-C3N4 and Nv–C3N4, indicating that nitrogen vacancies were located at bi-coordinated nitrogen lattice sites.33 Based on the above characterization and previous reports,31–33 it's expected that Cv-C3N4 and Nv-C3N4 were obtained.
Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) was subsequently employed to explore piezoelectric responses of the as-prepared samples. In the PFM image, different contrasts represent different directions and strengths of piezoelectric polarization. The bright contrast area indicates that the direction of the applied electric field is consistent with the direction of polarization, while the dark contrast area shows that the direction of the applied electric field is inverse to the direction of polarization. As displayed in Fig. 7a and b, the morphology image (Fig. 7a) and piezoelectric response image (Fig. 7b) of pristine g-C3N4 showed the same clear outlines, which indicated that the piezoelectric response was generated for pristine g-C3N4. Besides, in Fig. S4,† g-C3N4 exhibited a clear resonant peak near 348 kHz at five different excitation voltages, confirming the piezoelectricity of g-C3N4. However, with respect to Cv-C3N4 (Fig. 7c and d) and Nv-C3N4 (Fig. 7e and f), the contrasts in their PFM images were almost constant, indicating weak piezoelectric responses, which could be attributed to the destruction of triangular-shaped non-centrosymmetric holes in the g-C3N4 plane. According to the above results, it is concluded that pristine g-C3N4 exhibited the strongest piezoelectric effect in these three samples.
 Fig. 7  AFM and PFM images of (a and b) pristine g-C3N4, (c and d) Cv-C3N4 and (e and f) Nv-C3N4. 
DRS of Cv-C3N4 and Nv-C3N4 after ultrasonic-driven HAuCl4 reduction experiments (denoted as Au–Nv–C3N4 and Au–Nv-C3N4, respectively) displayed apparent enhanced absorbance due to Au deposition (Fig. 8a), indicating the piezo-catalytic properties of Cv-C3N4 and Nv-C3N4. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 8b, the piezo-catalytic performance of pristine g-C3N4 for H2O2 generation was much higher than that of Cv-C3N4 and Nv-C3N4 (Fig. 8b), regardless of higher specific surface areas and more active sites of Cv-C3N4 and Nv-C3N4. It is expected that the introduction of C vacancies or N vacancies would destroy the integrity of the triangular holes. Since the piezoelectric effect of g-C3N4 derived from the asymmetrical structures of triangular holes, the impairment of the piezoelectric effect was inevitable with the creation of C/N vacancies, which was consistent with the result of PFM measurement. For piezoelectric materials, the output voltage is proportional to the intensity of the piezoelectric effect.35 Therefore, the stronger the piezoelectric effect a piezoelectric material possesses, the higher the reduction potential of piezoelectric polarization it will produce, which is suggested to result in a higher reaction rate.

4. Conclusions
In summary, non-metal g-C3N4 was employed to achieve ultrasonic-assisted H2O2 generation only from O2 and H2O in a green and mild way. The piezo-catalytic effect of g-C3N4 was verified by the ultrasonic-driven reduction of KMnO4, while Au deposition experiments revealed that the direction of ultrasonic-derived piezoelectric polarization of g-C3N4 was along the g-C3N4 plane. By constructing C and N vacancies in g-C3N4, we found that g-C3N4 containing C and N vacancies showed a weaker piezoelectric effect and lower piezo-catalytic H2O2 generation than pristine g-C3N4, which was considered to be due to the destruction of the integrity of triangular holes in the g-C3N4 plane. This work expands metal-based materials for piezo-catalysis to non-metal materials of g-C3N4, and helps provide a green and sustainable process for generating H2O2.
