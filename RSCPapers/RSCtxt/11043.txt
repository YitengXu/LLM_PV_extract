    , Accepted 15th February 2016First published on 19th February 2016AbstractWe investigate the photophysical properties of organic donor–acceptor dyad and triad molecular systems based on triphenylene and perylene diimide units linked by a non-conjugated flexible bridge in solution using complementary optical spectroscopy techniques. When these molecules are diluted in dichloromethane solution, energy transfer from the triphenylene to the perylene diimide excited moieties is evidenced by time-resolved fluorescence measurements resulting in a quenching of the emission from the triphenylene moieties. Simultaneously, another quenching process that affects the emission from both donor and acceptor units is observed. Solution ultrafast transient absorption measurements provide evidence of photo-induced charge transfer from either the donor or the acceptor depending upon the excitation. Overall, the analysis of the detailed time-resolved spectroscopic measurements carried out in the dyad and triad systems as well as in the triphenylene and perylene diimide units alone provides useful information both to better understand the relations between energy and charge transfer processes with molecular structures, and for the design of future functional dyad and triad architectures based on donor and acceptor moieties for organic optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Organic semiconductors have been widely investigated during the last decades due to their various applications in electronics and photonics including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1–3 organic lasers,4–6 organic solar cells7–9 and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).10–13 Among the various physical properties involved in the operation of organic optoelectronic devices, energy transfer and charge transfer processes play a key-role and have been extensively studied in a variety of ordered and disordered molecular systems.14–18 For instance, in conventional organic solar cells, photogenerated singlet excitons migrate via energy transfer19–21 to reach an interfacial region between donor (D) and acceptor (A) components, where they dissociate via an electron transfer process to produce photocurrent.22,23 In the case of OLEDs, light-emitting chromophores are generally dispersed into a wide bandgap host that allows energy transfer from the matrix to the guest molecules.24–27 For instance, high performance OLEDs with fluorescent emitters were recently demonstrated based on the use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules as assistant dopants which allowed an efficient energy transfer of both singlet and triplet excited states from the assistant dopants to the fluorescent emitters.28 A detailed understanding of the structure–properties relationship is still needed to design novel functional molecular or supramolecular systems presenting highly efficient charge and/or energy transfers suitable for organic optoelectronic applications. For this purpose, a variety of model molecular systems based on dyads and triads containing donor and acceptor units has been developed to explore and identify the underlying key processes that govern energy- and charge-transfer mechanisms in organic conjugated materials.29–43
Here, we study the photophysical properties in solution of two molecular systems based on triphenylene (TriPh) donor (D) unit and a perylene diimide (PerDi) acceptor (A) unit which are covalently linked together by non-conjugated flexible polymethylene bridges. The chemical structures of these compounds are shown in Scheme 1. The D–A dyad was recently synthesized and the synthesis of the D–A–D triad was reported by Cammidge et al.44,45 Both systems were shown to display liquid-crystalline properties. The TriPh moiety is a planar fused π-unit and a very-well known discotic mesogen with a hole mobility higher than 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a wide energy bandgap of 3.7 eV (Fig. 1a).46–49 As for the PerDi unit, it is a commonly used electron acceptor moiety which can self-organize into columnar structures. It exhibits high electron mobility in thin film OFETs.50–58 Previous studies have demonstrated that these two conjugated units present high potentials for organic electronics and photovoltaics.46–59 In particular, perylene diimides have been incorporated as energy- or electron-acceptors in various conjugated oligomers29–42 or polymers for the generation of double-cable polymers with attractive photovoltaic properties.60 In contrast to these systems already reported in the literature, the molecules investigated herein were specifically designed as precursors of photoactive liquid crystalline materials with a mesoscopic ordering of the donor and acceptor moieties. Such a strategy has been explored in perylene diimide–oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) bichromophores.57

The photophysical properties of the dyad and triad molecules in solution are investigated in this study by combining steady-state optical spectroscopy, time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) and subpicosecond transient absorption measurements. These photophysical properties are compared to those of the monochromophoric compounds. The results show an intricate interplay between photoinduced intramolecular energy and electron transfer processes which depends on the conformational effects allowed by the long aliphatic chain used as a spacer. It should be mentioned that the structural and self-organization properties of the dyad and triad molecules used in this study have been recently investigated.45 These liquid-crystalline compounds were found to self-organize at room temperature into columnar mesophases with well distinct stacks of donor and acceptor moieties. While such a donor–acceptor supramolecular architecture is of strong interest for optoelectronic applications, the present study in solution provides useful information that will be needed to assess the structure–property relationship in this class of promising organic materials. Obviously, this study is also very relevant to future works devoted to the design and the development of novel functional D–A molecular or supramolecular systems for organic optoelectronic applications.
Experimental section
The molecules used in this work were synthesized and purified following a procedure already explained in the literature.451H NMR spectra were recorded at 300 MHz on Bruker spectrometers in CD2Cl2. Tetramethylsilane was used as internal standard and the positions of the peaks are reported in ppm. The molecules were dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (Sigma-Aldrich) and quartz cuvettes were filled with the solutions for the photophysical measurements. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer. The concentration of the solution was adjusted to reach optical densities suitable for the PL and transient absorption experiments. Steady-state PL and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra were recorded using a Horiba-JobinYvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a three-slit double-grating excitation monochromator and a spectrograph emission monochromator both with a 2.1 nm mm−1 (1200 grooves mm−1) dispersion. For the steady-state luminescence measurements, the unpolarized excitation light source was a 450 W xenon CW lamp and the emission was detected at an angle of 90° for the dilute-solution measurements (10 mm quartz cell) using a red-sensitive Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube. The solution photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values were determined using quinine bisulphate (Fluka) in 0.5 M sulphuric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) solution as a standard reference because of its well-known PLQY of 54.6% and its very small sensitivity to oxygen quenching.61–64 The following equation was used to include the usual corrections: (1)where ϕ stands for PLQY, the subscripts x and r refer to the compound to be characterized and to the reference solutions, respectively. λ is the excitation wavelength, A(λ) is the absorbance, I(λ) is the relative intensity of the excitation light, n is the solvent refractive index, and D is the integrated area under the emission spectra.
Time-resolved PL measurements were carried out using a Noncollinear Optical Parametric Amplifier (NOPA) pumped by a fiber femtosecond laser (Amplitude Systemes Tangerine), and a streak camera (Hamamatsu PLP system) with a time resolution of about 10 ps. The pulse duration was 100 fs and the repetition rate was 10 kHz. The excitation wavelength used for our experiments was either 325 nm or 515 nm. The pumping intensity was controlled using a set of neutral densities. The PL was collected at the magic angle between the polarization of the excitation light and the polarization of the detected polarized light in order to avoid any polarization anisotropy effects. The photoluminescence decays were fitted by a single or double exponential model: (2)where I(t) is the photoluminescence intensity as a function of time, τPL is the PL decay time and αi is the pre-exponential factor associated with each decay time. α represents the amplitude of the components at t = 0 and ∑αi is normalized to unity. These parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data with a nonlinear least squares procedure.
Femtosecond transient absorption measurements were carried out using pump and probe pulses generated by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Pro XP, Spectra-Physics) working with an 800 nm output. A Mai Tai laser composed of a mode-locked titanium-doped sapphire (Ti3+:Al2O3) laser (Tsunami) and a diode-pumped continuous wave Nd:YVO4 laser (Millennia). The former was used as the seeding laser for the regenerative amplifier. The latter was used to pump the Tsunami. The regenerative amplifier was based on a Q-switched intra-cavity frequency doubled Nd:YLF laser operating at a repetition rate of 5 kHz and delivering 40 fs long pulses centered at 800 nm. The 325 nm pumping beam was obtained by 4th harmonic generation using two beta barium borate (BBO) crystals after the optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime, Spectra-Physics) operating at 1300 nm. The pump beam was attenuated to 2 mW using neutral density filters in front of the sample. The 725 nm probe beam was selected from a white light continuum probe generated in the visible range with half of the 800 nm regenerative amplifier output power and a 2 mm thickness sapphire crystal. The time delay between the pump and probe beam was varied up to 900 ps using a stable delay line. The time interval for the on-set measurement was ∼100 fs in stepping motor and the time interval for the decay measurement was ∼10 ps in stepping motor. Pump light was modulated using a mechanical chopper at 220 Hz and the differential transmission ΔT/T of the probe beam was determined as a function of the delay time with a photodiode and a lock-in detection. A filter cutting the light below 640 nm was used to reduce the potential impact of the scattered light coming from the pump beam and the emission from the PerDi moiety. The differential transmission was calculated as ΔT/T = (Ton − Toff)/Toff, where Ton and Toff correspond to the sample transmission with the pump beam on and off, respectively.65 Note that all the optical measurements were carried out at room temperature and with non-degassed samples.
Results and discussion
Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out in TriPh, PerDi and the dyad/triad dissolved in chloroform solution using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate.45 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of dyad and triad shown in Fig. 1 were determined from the first oxidation and reduction potentials displayed in Table 1. These HOMO and LUMO values are consistent with those measured in the monochromophoric TriPh and PerDi model compounds and suggest that a photo-induced excited charge transfer can occur between these two chromophores.

Energetics of photoinduced electron transfer
The redox potentials can be used to determine the Gibbs free energy of the intramolecular charge-separated state (GCS) of the donor–acceptor systems by using the Rehm–Weller equation:66–69 ΔGCS = e(ETriPhox − EPerDired) − Eexc + ΔE(3a) (3b) (3c)where ΔGCS is the charge transfer free energy (i.e. charge separation), Eox/red are the oxidation and reduction potentials of the donor and acceptor, respectively, Eexc is the excitation energy calculated as the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra, rTriPh and rPerDi are the radii of the donor and acceptor radical ions, εsolv and εref are the dielectric constants of the solvents used to characterize the optical properties (εDCM = 8.93 and εCHCl3 = 4.81) and to determine Eox/red, respectively, and are needed to account for polarity variation between optical and electrochemical measurements. ΔE is equivalent to the Coulombic energy needed to separate the charges taking into account the orientation energy changes of the solvent molecules surrounding the donor and acceptors groups. Rcc is the donor–acceptor center-to-center distance where photo-induced charge transfer occurs. In the case of dyad and triad molecules, the maximum unfolded center-to-center distance between the triphenylene and the perylene diimide moieties in the dyad and triad molecules is around 2.3 nm. Although it certainly corresponds to one of the less favourable molecular conformations for charge transfer in these systems, we assume that Rcc is equal to this value in the calculations to determine a limit value to ΔGCS. The values of ΔGCS for both the dyad and the triad are then calculated using eqn (3) and are shown in Table 1. Its negative values indicate that photoinduced electron transfer is an exergonic reaction whenever it occurs from either the photoexcited triphenylene unit or the photoexcited perylene diimide moiety. It is worth noting that the values of the Gibbs free energy of the intramolecular charge-separated state in dyad and triad molecules reported in Table 1 are very similar. This was expected since the dyad and triad molecules are placed in the same environment and contain the same donor and acceptor units separated by an identical alkyl bridge. However, it should be emphasized again that those values were calculated for the limit case where the non-conjugated bridge is completely unfolded. As it will be confirmed below, the distribution of molecular conformations of the dyad and triad molecules in solution is presumably different which should lead to stronger differences in the experimental values characterizing the charge transfer process in these materials.
Steady-state electronic absorption
The absorption spectra of the dyad and triad as well as the monochromophoric compounds were measured in dilute DCM solutions with concentrations in the range 0.5–2.0 × 10−6 mol L−1.71 Furthermore, we investigated the optical properties of a mixture of Triph and PerDi with a 1:1 molar ratio. Maximum absorption wavelengths and maximum emission wavelengths are listed in Table 2. The absorption spectra are displayed in Fig. 1b and Fig. S1a (ESI†). The absorption bands at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm are mainly due to electronic transitions associated with the TriPh unit while the lowest-energy absorption band in the visible region of the spectra is only due to the PerDi unit.59 These observations show that selective excitation of the perylene diimide chromophore is possible in the dyad and triad.

The maximum of the absorption from the TriPh unit alone appears around 280 nm, which has been previously attributed to the symmetry-allowed S0–S4 electronic transition. Low intensity peaks at 345 and 360 nm are related to the high symmetry-forbidden S0–S1 transition.72–74 The absorption spectra of the dyad and triad molecules in DCM show the same features below 400 nm. There are neither shifted bands nor additional bands, suggesting that there is no aggregation and thus no ground-state π–π interactions between the TriPh units in dilute DCM solutions. Regarding the absorption of the PerDi unit alone, the absorption peak at 524 nm corresponds to the (0,0) vibronic transition while the peak at 487 nm is attributed to the (0,1) transition. The position of these absorption peaks is found to be very similar in the dyad and triad cases. In addition, the peak-to-peak ratio between the (0,0) and (0,1) peak intensities is around 1.6, which indicates that there is no aggregation between the PerDi units in diluted DCM solutions.75,76 The absence of ground-state interactions and aggregation in DCM solutions is also fully supported by the investigation of concentration- and temperature-dependent electronic absorption (Fig. S2, ESI†), which showed no spectral changes at higher concentrations and at higher temperatures in DCM solution.
The absorption band associated with the PerDi unit in the dyad and triad solutions is broader than that of PerDi alone (Fig. 1b) and of the TriPh:PerDi blend (Fig. S1a, ESI†). This effect is stronger in the triad case where the vibronic structure of the absorption spectrum displays a smaller peak-to-valley intensity ratio. Noticeably, the blend solution, obtained with a concentration of chromophores close to those of the dyad and triad solutions, does not show this broadening suggesting that the effect in the dyad and triad solutions is due to intramolecular interactions. Moreover, one notices a clear hypochromic effect on the perylene diimide chromophore band in the absorption spectra of dyad and especially the triad in DCM (Table 2). Such effects can be explained by intramolecular proximity interactions between triphenylene and perylene diimide units.77 These interactions can occur preferentially for the population of folded conformers that have a shorter intrachromophoric distance than the fully extended systems. Indeed, it is known that, in solution, end-to-end cyclisation of bichromophoric molecules linked by alkane chains can occur in the ground state.78 A 1H NMR investigation showed only one set of resonance peak for each proton (Fig. S3, ESI†) of the dyad and triad. If different ground-state conformers are to occur, their interconversion must be fast on the NMR time scale.
As already mentioned,71 the degradation of the triphenylene unit in the dyad and triad molecules was observed to occur upon irradiation presumably due to the photo-acidity of the chloroform (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). As displayed in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†), we also measured the steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra of the dyad and triad molecules in ethyl acetate (AcOEt), diethyl ether (Et2O) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The absorption spectra in AcOEt and Et2O are similar to those obtained in DCM, showing a clear broadening of the absorption bands of both TriPh and PerDi units in the dyad and triad molecules. In contrast to the DCM case, a weak concentration dependence of the absorption spectra was observed for both dyad and triad molecules in AcOEt (Fig. S8, ESI†), suggesting that intermolecular interactions occur in that solvent. In DMSO, a dramatic effect is observed on both absorption bands of TriPh and PerDi chromophores. The use of solvents with a larger dipole moment than DCM induces strong broadening, which can be assigned to significant intermolecular interactions. In order to exclude a possible contribution from intermolecular interactions and to gain insights into the photophysical properties of isolated dyad and triad molecules, the photophysical measurements shown below will be carried out only in DCM.
Steady-state fluorescence emission and fluorescence quenching
The steady-state fluorescence spectra of TriPh, PerDi, TriPh:PerDi blend, dyad and triad in dilute DCM solutions were measured using an excitation wavelength of either 325 nm to photoexcite both triphenylene and perylene diimide units, or 495 nm to photoexcite the latter chromophore only. They are displayed in Fig. 1b2 and Fig. S1b (ESI†). The fluorescence spectrum of TriPh shows a maximum at 382 nm and four vibronic peaks. This is consistent with the emission spectrum previously obtained for a non-aggregated triphenylene solution.59 It is worth noting that the TriPh in DCM solution is weakly fluorescent with a fluorescence quantum yield of about 7%. In contrast, the emission from the PerDi moieties in solution is highly efficient with a fluorescence quantum yield of nearly 100%. The vibronic progression with the peaks observed at 523, 574 and 623 nm in the fluorescence spectrum is characteristic of the non-perturbed perylene diimide chromophore. The intensity ratio of these peaks remains unchanged in the dyad and triad in a range of concentration between 4.0 × 10−5 and 0.8 × 10−6 mol L−1 (2.1 × 10−5 and 1.1 × 10−6 mol L−1 for the triad), which confirms that the detected emission originates from non-aggregated chromophores.79 Importantly, neither excimer nor exciplex emission was detected in the fluorescence spectra of dyad and triad.
The 325 nm excitation wavelength excites both TriPh and PerDi units of the dyad and triad molecules. However, the fluorescence spectra of the dyad and triad solutions are dominated by the emission from the PerDi units, and only show a weak fluorescence from the TriPh moieties. The fluorescence quantum yield values were measured for dyad and triad solutions using two different excitation wavelengths, 310 and 495 nm. The results are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the emission from the TriPh group in the dyad and triad is quenched. As previously mentioned, photoinduced electron transfer from photoexcited triphenylene to ground-state perylene diimide can account in part for that quenching.80 The fluorescence excitation spectra (Fig. S1c, ESI†) show the contributions to the emission at 550 nm from the two chromophores in the dyad and triad molecules and demonstrate that electronic energy transfer also occurs. When compared to the spectrum of the PerDi alone in solution, the dyad and triad excitation spectra provide clear evidence of a contribution from the TriPh unit below 350 nm. This indicates that energy transfer from the triphenylene to the perylene diimide units takes place within individual dyad and triad molecules. It is however noticeable that this energy transfer does not lead to an expected increase of the PerDi emission intensity. On the contrary, its emission decreases in the case of the dyad and triad solutions as compared to the monochromophoric PerDi. An explanation is provided by the results obtained with the 495 nm direct excitation of the PerDi unit in the dyad and triad, indicating that a process quenches the PerDi singlet excited state in the polychromophoric systems. Here again, we have seen that photoinduced electron transfer is exergonic from photoexcited perylene diimide to ground-state triphenylene. It is worth noting that the fluorescence quantum yield of the PerDi in the mixture with Triph in the blend solution remains equal to unity (at the same chromophore concentration as those used in the dyad and triad solutions), which clearly demonstrates that the quenching processes observed in the dyad and triad solutions are intramolecular.
The experimental data and observations obtained at this stage can be used to draw a simplified Jablonski diagram showing the relative position of the energy levels and the photophysical events taking place in the dyad and triad (Fig. 2). The fluorescence quantum yield of the perylene diimide in dyad and triad obtained using an excitation at 495 nm can be written as: Φ495f = kf/(kf + knr + kCSh) = 0.38 (dyad) and 0.11 (triad). The related fluorescence quantum yield obtained using an excitation at 310 nm is given by the following equation: Φ310f = ΦEET × kf/(kf + knr + kCSh) = 0.07 (dyad) and 0.03 (triad), where ΦEET is the quantum yield of electronic energy transfer (EET) from triphenylene donor to perylene diimide acceptor. We can therefore extract the values of 0.18 and 0.27 for ΦEET in the dyad and triad solutions, respectively. The absorption and emission spectra displayed in Fig. 1b show an overlap between the fluorescence spectrum of the TriPh and the absorption spectrum of PerDi. As a consequence, intramolecular EET could occur from the donor to the acceptor via Förster-type dipole–dipole coupling.81–85 In order to assess the validity of the proposed kinetic scheme, we performed time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption measurements.

Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy
To investigate the fluorescence dynamics of the dyad, triad, TriPh, PerDi and the TriPh:PerDi blend in DCM, the solutions were prepared at the same concentrations of aromatic chromophores as those used for the steady-state photophysical measurements. The solutions were excited either at 325 nm, where both TriPh and PerDi units absorb light, or at 515 nm where only the PerDi group absorbs. Table 3 summarises the time-resolved fluorescence data.

Negative α values are associated with a risetime of the photoluminescence. The TriPh and the PerDi fluorescences are detected within the 400–410 nm and the 530–540 nm range, respectively. The TriPh is excited only at 325 nm. For PerDi, 325 nm and 515 nm excitation wavelength were used

As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the fluorescence decays of the TriPh and PerDi model chromophores in DCM solutions were measured using excitation wavelengths of 325 and 515 nm, respectively. These data were fitted using a single exponential decay function with fluorescence lifetimes of 8.0 ns and 5.0 ns for TriPh and PerDi, respectively. The values are consistent with the range of fluorescence lifetimes typically reported for these compounds.29,72,76 Noticeably and as expected, the spectral emission from the TriPh:PerDi mixed solution excited at 325 nm (Fig. S9, ESI†) matches the superimposition of the fluorescence spectra of the individual TriPh and PerDi units. In addition, upon excitation at 325 nm, the mixture shows PL dynamics which, within the experimental and fitting uncertainty, are identical to those observed for the pure solutions of the same molecules (Table 3). This is consistent with the steady-state results and conclusions.
The streak camera images displayed in Fig. 3a show the temporal evolution of emission spectra of the dyad and triad solutions illuminated at 325 nm. Whilst the emission spectra of the dyad and triad solutions measured over the Δt1 and Δt2 time ranges both display the typical spectral shape of the acceptor emission (Fig. 3b), it is noticeable that for both molecules, the maximum intensity of the emission does not occur right after the 325 nm excitation pulse but instead is shifted towards longer time. This is in contrast with the behaviour of the model monochromophoric molecules and their mixture (Fig. S9, ESI†). These observations show that the singlet excited state of perylene diimide is populated indirectly after the excitation pulse, which fully supports the occurrence of an intramolecular EET in the dyad and triad molecules.

(b) Integration of the streak camera images of the dyad (1) and triad (2) along the time axis near the regions marked as Δt1 and Δt2 in (a). The horizontal axis corresponds to the emission wavelength, the vertical axis to the time over which the emission is measured. The intensity of the emitted light is provided by the coloured scale. Integration of the data along the wavelength axis can be used to spectrally separate the emission kinetics from the TriPh and PerDi moieties, respectively. 
The fluorescence decays of TriPh moieties measured in the dyad and triad compounds upon excitation at 325 nm are shown in Fig. 4a. They display biexponential decays with time constants much faster than those measured in the isolated TriPh and in the blend solutions (Table 3). In a similar way, the fluorescence decays monitored at the PerDi acceptor emission band photoexcited at 325 nm in the dyad and triad were extracted from Fig. 3a and plotted in Fig. 4b. For both compounds, the kinetics of the acceptor emission is found to be biexponential with a short component having a negative preexponential amplitude, i.e. a risetime. It is worth noting that the risetime value is found to be similar to the short time component observed in the triphenylene emission. This observation shows the filiation between the two states as a result of EET. Upon the 515 nm direct excitation of the acceptor unit of the dyad and triad (Fig. S10, ESI†), no risetime of the PerDi* fluorescence intensity was observed and the fluorescence decays were fitted using a single exponential function with time constants of 3.0 and 1.5 ns in dyad and triad, respectively. These results confirm the quenching of the perylene diimide chromophore in dyad and triad, as observed by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. From these data, it is possible to extract the values of the kinetic rate constants, kCSh = 1/τPerDi′ − 1/τPerDi, where τPerDi′ and τPerDi represent the fluorescence lifetimes of the perylene diimide chromophore in the dyad/triad and in the model compound, respectively. One finds 1.3 × 108 s−1 and 4.6 × 108 s−1 for the dyad and triad, respectively. The efficiency of the photoinduced electron transfer is higher for the latter system. This is not due to a mere statistical effect because the rate constant for triad is more than twice the value obtained for the dyad. An electron transfer quantum yield can be determined using ΦCSh = 1 − τPerDi′/τPerDi. This gives a charge transfer quenching efficiency of ca. 52% and 66% for the dyad and triad, respectively. Here, it can be highlighted that, for dyad and triad, the quenching of the PerDi emission by direct excitation is only caused by the photoinduced electron transfer process that competes with the fluorescence process (since Φf of the PerDi model is 100%, we can exclude internal conversion and intersystem crossing). Therefore, the use of 1 − (Φf + ΦCSh) should result in a value of 0. However, one can find 10% and 23% for the dyad and triad, respectively, which implies that another process is involved in those systems. This result suggests that the simple Jablonski diagram proposed in Fig. 2 should be more complicated to fully describe the photophysics of the dyad and triad molecules. An additional process which could explain the apparent inconsistency could be an electron transfer in the folded dyad and triad systems.

(b) PL decays of the PerDi moieties in the dyad and triad solutions obtained after integration of the streak camera images in the spectral region of 530–540 nm. The DCM solutions were photo-excited at 325 nm. Red solid lines correspond to the fits. 
Similarly for the triphenylene chromophore, we can evaluate the sum of the electronic energy transfer and the charge separation rates as kEET + kCSe = (1/τTriPh′ − 1/τTriPh) = 1.125 × 109 s−1 for both dyad and triad (Table 3, note that the value of 0.8 ns represents the decay of the TriPh by fluorescence, formation of the CS and EET to the PerDi). It is now possible to evaluate and compare the efficiencies of electronic energy transfer and charge separation. The fluorescence quantum yields are given by: Φf = kf /(kf + knr + kEET + kCSe) and are 0.02 for the dyad and 0.005 for the triad. As the electronic energy transfer efficiencies are given by: ΦEET = kEET/(kf + knr + kEET + kCSe), one can evaluate the rate of the electronic energy transfer as kEET = kf·ΦEET/Φf. From Tables 2 and 3, the fluorescence efficiency for the TriPh alone is ΦTriPhf = kf/(kf + knr) = 0.07 and the decay time is τTriPhf = 1/(kf + knr) = 8 × 10−9 s, then kEET is 7.88 × 107 s−1 for dyad and 4.72 × 108 s−1 for triad. This shows that EET is ca. 6 fold faster in triad than in dyad. One can then deduce the values of kCSe equal to 1.05 × 109 s−1 for the dyad and to 6.53 × 108 s−1 for the triad.
According to the simple proposed kinetic scheme (Fig. 2), the populations of the excited states of the donor D and acceptor A moieties when both are photo-excited can be described by eqn (4) and 6, respectively.86 (4) (5) (6)With kD = k0D + kEET + kCTD being the decay rate of the donor including k0D the photoluminescence decay rate in the absence of acceptor allowing energy transfer, kEET the energy transfer rate and kCTD the decay rate of the donor describing the emission quenching due to photoinduced electron transfer. Eqn (5) represents the kinetic law obtained for direct excitation of the acceptor decaying with kA = koA + kCTA, where koA is the fluorescence decay rate in the absence of donor and kCTA the decay rate of the acceptor describing the fluorescence quenching due to photoinduced electron transfer. Eqn (6) gives the rate of the decay of the acceptor chromophore when excitation is set at the donor unit.
Based on eqn (4), the experimental fluorescence decay of the triphenylene part should display a monoexponential behaviour, but does not. Actually, we observed a bi-exponential behaviour, indicating that there are two kinetically distinct triphenylene species in the excited state. The scheme in Fig. 2 does not take in account any ground-state or excited-state conformers that would have distinct kinetic parameters. Electronic absorption has shown that weak intramolecular interactions between chromophores exist and are more pronounced in the case of triad. In Table 3, according to the previous equations, we can safely associate the 0.8 ns to the photoexcited triphenylene species that transfer energy intramolecularly to the perylene diimide unit. The time components of 4 and 1.7 ns in dyad and triad, respectively, arise from the triphenylene species that undergo a less efficient quenching event.
As shown in the ESI,† if we consider, in the kinetic model, that two types of conformers, corresponding to the folded and unfolded species, are present in solution, this still oversimplified model would lead to multiexponential dynamics on PerDi moiety, which are not observed using our current experimental setup. In that context, we prefer to use the simplest model proposed above which describes well the behavior of a large majority of molecular species present in the solution. It is evident that the kinetics of these dyad and triad systems in solution are more complex and we will propose below some possible scenarios in terms of molecular conformations in the ground-state which could explain these differences.
Subpicosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
Based on previously published transient absorption measurements carried out in a variety of perylene diimide derivatives,37,43,66,87,88 it is well established that PerDi* as well as the excited PerDi anion radical, noted PerDi˙−, both present strong and very similar excited state absorption (ESA) features with a maximum in the same range of wavelengths around 700–720 nm. Taking these previous reports into account for our transient absorption measurements, the dyad and triad in DCM solutions were excited either at 325 or at 400 nm. Similarly to the time-resolved fluorescence experiments, both TriPh and PerDi units are photo-excited when the solutions are irradiated at 325 nm while only the PerDi moieties absorb light at 400 nm. These femtosecond transient absorption measurements provide information on the charge transfer processes via the kinetics of PerDi˙− and on the energy transfer processes via the temporal evolution of PerDi* ESA.
As shown in Fig. 5a1 and a2, the transient absorption spectra of the dyad and triad solutions optically-pumped with sub-picosecond excitation pulses at 325 nm show a positive −ΔT/T with a maximum value at about 725 nm. The increase of that absorption signal occurs on a very short time scale (i.e. up to 2 ps, Fig. 5b1 and b2). The kinetic curves of −ΔT/T on a longer time scale, are displayed in Fig. 6a. They exhibit a more complex behaviour than those measured for the isolated TriPh and PerDi moieties and their mixture (Fig. S11, ESI†). First, the fast growing absorption occurring within 1 ps (Fig. 5b1 and b2) is followed by a decay lasting over time delays up to 30 ps. We attribute the fast rise component (fitted to ca. 0.3 ps, Table 3) and the following decay to the formation and recombination, respectively, of the photoinduced charge separated state, [TriPh˙+–PerDi˙−]. It is likely that at such time resolution, one probes photoexcited folded structures that react very rapidly as compared to the extended conformations. In order to obtain a rough estimate of the recombination time constant, this decay was fitted by the sum of a single exponential decay function and a constant term, leading to a time constant of about 26–28 ps (Table 3). These time constant values determined by TAS are much faster than those obtained by picosecond fluorescence decay measurements. Interestingly, these dynamics show that the recombination of the [TriPh˙+–PerDi˙−] states in both dyad and triad is significantly slower than its formation, by almost two orders of magnitude. Second, we observed an increasing absorption with significantly slower dynamics than the first one as it stretches over time delays up to 800 ps (Fig. 6a1 and a2). This slower risetime observed in Fig. 6a can be straightforwardly assigned to the energy transfer process from the TriPh to the PerDi units (note that this lifetime cannot be fitted since our window of measurements is only 800 ps). Furthermore, this interpretation is well supported by the transient absorption results obtained using a pump wavelength of 400 nm. As displayed in Fig. 6a and b, the dynamics of the transient absorption signal measured with the two different pump wavelengths (325 and 400 nm, respectively) show a similar behaviour for time delays up to 150 ps. For longer time delays, while the transient absorption signal obtained by pumping at 325 nm was related to energy transfer via an increase of the population of PerDi* with time (Fig. 6a1 and a2), the responses obtained with the pump wavelength of 400 nm show very slow decays of PerDi* ESA, which are not returning to zero, revealing a long-lived excited state (Fig. 6b1 and b2i.e. measured to be 2.4 and 1.7 ns by streak camera measurements for dyad and triad, respectively). Interestingly, transient absorption on isolated PerDi shows the same “plateau” (without the fast increase and decay) at 725 nm (Fig. S10, ESI†). In addition, when looking at the kinetic traces shown in Fig. 6a1 and a2, it can be seen that the ratio −ΔT/T of the transient absorption signal after CT formation to signal after 820 ps is 0.79 for the triad while this ratio is smaller in the case of the dyad (i.e. 0.68). When comparing Fig. 6b1 and b2, one can also see that the quantity of PerDi* after CT recombination is smaller in the triad than in the dyad. These observations suggest that quenching of the ESA by charge transfer is more pronounced in the triad than in the dyad.

This study demonstrates that intramolecular electronic energy transfer and photo-induced electron transfer processes take place and compete with each other in the dyad and triad systems. Those competing phenomena are highly dependent on the conformers that are present in solution. As illustrated on Fig. 7, photo-induced electron transfer is found to partly quench the emission of the perylene diimide when the acceptor moieties are photo-excited, with a more efficient process when the number of triphenylene unit is increased. This process is suggested to occur in any case since the PerDi* lifetime is monoexponential and has a value shorter than the PerDi model as measured with streak camera measurements. When the triphenylene units are excited, two different paths can occur. On the one hand, only photo-induced electron transfer is observed (Path 1) which explains the monoexponential behaviour of the PerDi*. On the other hand, both energy transfer and photo-induced electron transfer compete to the deactivation of the excited states of the donor units (Path 2, Fig. 7) via the different molecular conformations of the dyad and triad molecules in solution. In addition, the results obtained by transient absorption measurements demonstrated that, following photo-excitation of the dyad and triad molecules, the charge separated state is quickly formed within 0.3 ps and recombines more slowly within 26–28 ps. However, this could certainly be attributed to the folded dyad/triad (Fig. 7) since the observed recombination rates are faster than those obtained from the steady state data. Overall, these results indicate that energy transfer occurs predominantly for unfolded conformations of the dyad and triad where the distance between the donor and acceptor is large, still in competition with electron transfer while photo-induced electron transfer becomes the dominant quenching mechanism for significantly smaller distances, corresponding to the folded conformers.

Conclusions
We examined the photophysical properties in diluted dichloromethane solution of a donor–acceptor dyad and a donor–acceptor–donor triad containing triphenylene and perylene diimide units as electron donor and acceptor moieties, respectively, which are connected by a flexible non-conjugated linker. Steady-state absorption and photoluminescence measurements suggest that an energy transfer from the triphenylene to the perylene diimide units occurs and competes with another nonradiative quenching process. To clarify the excitonic processes taking place in the dyad and triad solutions, time-resolved photoluminescence and subpicosecond transient absorption measurements were then carried out. The results demonstrate that a conformational effect due to the long aliphatic chain bridging the triphenylene and perylene diimide units is responsible for an intricate interplay between photoinduced intramolecular energy and electron transfer processes. In folded conformers with small distances between triphenylene and perylene diimide units, charge transfer is the dominant mechanism for the deactivation of the excited states of both moieties. In unfolded molecular configurations, slow electronic energy transfer from triphenylene to perylene diimide unit takes place and is in competition with the electron transfer process. Also, solving the kinetic equation, we show that the electronic energy transfer process is 6 times faster in triad than in dyad which is not apparent from the luminescence quantum yield since the perylene diimide unit is quenched by the much faster charge transfer process. Overall, this study provides useful and important insights into the photophysical properties of dyad and triad molecular architectures based on donor and acceptor moieties. These results should be taken into account in the near future for an improved design of liquid-crystalline donor–acceptor semiconducting organic materials for optoelectronic applications.

Electrochemical measurements were carried out in chloroform because the solubility of the dyad and triad molecules is high enough in chloroform to allow reaching the higher concentration required for cyclic voltammetry (typically between 10−2 and 10−3 mol L−1). However, we observed photodegradation of the compounds in chloroform, which led us to use preferentially DCM for spectroscopic measurements.

This was deduced from electrochemical experiments in chloroform. It is believed that photo-induced electron transfer is also thermodynamically allowed in DCM. Indeed oxidation and reduction potentials of triphenylene and perylene diimide are poorly sensitive to solvent polarity. Moreover, the work term (eqn (3b)) in the Rehm Weller equation (eqn (3a)) will be higher in DCM, rendering the electron transfer even more thermodynamically favourable.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Streak camera images of the dyad (1) and triad (2) in DCM solution using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm; the signal intensity is normalized with the colored scale bar displaying 0.125 steps. (b) Integration of the streak camera images of the dyad (1) and triad (2) along the time axis near the regions marked as Δt1 and Δt2 in (a). The horizontal axis corresponds to the emission wavelength, the vertical axis to the time over which the emission is measured. The intensity of the emitted light is provided by the coloured scale. Integration of the data along the wavelength axis can be used to spectrally separate the emission kinetics from the TriPh and PerDi moieties, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) PL decays of the TriPh moieties in the (1) dyad and (2) triad solutions obtained after integration of the streak camera images in the spectral region of 400–410 nm. (b) PL decays of the PerDi moieties in the dyad and triad solutions obtained after integration of the streak camera images in the spectral region of 530–540 nm. The DCM solutions were photo-excited at 325 nm. Red solid lines correspond to the fits.
