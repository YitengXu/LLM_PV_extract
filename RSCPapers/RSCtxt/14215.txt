    , Accepted 17th November 2011First published on 20th December 2011AbstractOne of the possible solutions to the world's rapidly increasing energy demand is the development of new photoelectrochemical cells with improved light absorption. This requires development of semiconductor materials which have appropriate bandgaps to absorb a large part of the solar spectrum at the same time as being stable in aqueous environments. Here we demonstrate an efficient, computational screening of relevant oxide and oxynitride materials based on electronic structure calculations resulting in the reduction of a vast space of 5400 different materials to only 15 promising candidates. The screening is based on an efficient and reliable way of calculating semiconductor band gaps. The outcome of the screening includes all already known successful materials of the types investigated plus some new ones which warrant further experimental investigation.

Broader context
For almost 40 years, researchers have tried to identify semiconductors suitable for photoelectrochemical water splitting under solar light. Investigations have focused on oxides and, more recently, on oxynitrides, due to their good properties with respect to stability. Inspired by this, we have performed a comprehensive computational screening of more than 5400 oxide/oxynitride compounds in the cubic perovskite structure covering 52 metals. The screening is based on criteria for stability and for the size and position of the bandgap. The material should allow for collecting a significant part of the solar photons and be able to drive the uphill water splitting reaction. The calculations of the bandgaps go beyond standard (semi-)local DFT and take into account explicitly the derivative discontinuity providing realistic estimates of the gaps. We end up with 10 oxides and 5 oxynitrides as candidates for light harvesting materials including AgNbO3, BaSnO3, BaTaO2N, CaTaO2N, SrTaO2N, and LaTiO2N, which are well known in the water splitting community. We suggest 9 new combinations for further experimental investigation.

Introduction
The high living standard created in the world during the last century is to a large extent due to easy access to cheap fossil fuels. These resources are limited, and the ever increasing energy demands, together with the CO2 related climate problems, make the development of sustainable energy technology one of the most important problems of today.1 Direct harvesting and conversion of solar light to electrical energy in photovoltaic (PV) cells or to chemical energy by photoelectrochemical (PEC) reactions are the most obvious technologies to address this problem. Conventionally, both technologies rely on light collection in semiconductor (SC) materials with appropriate bandgaps that match the solar spectrum in order to obtain high energy conversion efficiency.2–4 Here, we demonstrate an efficient, computational screening of relevant oxide and oxynitride materials based on electronic structure calculations showing that less than 1 out of 350 materials are realistic candidates for light-induced splitting of water.
The tremendous increase of computational power over the last couple of decades, in combination with methodological improvements, has made it possible to guide the development of new materials using first principles quantum mechanical calculations. Examples include the development of battery cathodes,5 the construction of semiconductor superlattices,6 searching for high stability alloys,7 and, very recently, screening for high-performance piezoelectrics,8 for organic photovoltaics9,10 and for inorganic scintillator materials.11 Here, we show that a newly implemented density functional method allows for completely new possibilities of screening material properties involving their band gaps.
The properties determining the usefulness of a SC material as light harvester in a PEC cell include12,13 (i) a band gap allowing the utilization of a significant fraction of the solar spectrum; (ii) well positioned band edges relative to the water redox levels; (iii) high mobilities, allowing electrons and holes to reach the surface and reduce/oxidize the targets before recombining, and (iv) chemical/structural stability under irradiation. In addition, low cost and non-toxicity are necessary properties. Numerous efforts have been made to find an efficient material for splitting water into H2 and O2 under visible light irradiation going more than 40 years back to Honda and Fujishima's report on electrochemical photolysis using TiO2,14 but so far the ideal material has not been found.3
Here, we focus mainly on aspects (i), (ii) and (iv) mentioned above, namely the search for stable materials with optimal, well positioned, bandgaps. We consider metal oxides and oxynitrides, due to their high stability, and we concentrate on the cubic perovskite structure with general formula ABO3 (space groupPmm), due to the large variety of properties and applications of materials in this structure.15 We first consider the binary oxides where much experimental information is already available. The screening method is then applied to binary oxynitrides which generally have better positioning of the bandgap for water splitting compared to the oxides, but where much less experimental information is available, making theoretical screening necessary. Our study points to six new oxides and one oxynitride candidate for water splitting which should warrant experimental investigation.
Results and discussion
The first step is to find and validate an appropriate method for calculation of oxide and oxynitride stabilities and bandgaps. With respect to the stability, we use a standard DFT-GGA in the form of the RPBE-functional.16 (Details of the methods used in this paper can be found in the Methods section in the ESI †).
Reliable calculations of the bandgaps require a density functional beyond GGA. We use the so-called GLLB-SC functional17,18 which is demonstrated in Fig. 1 to predict the magnitudes of the bandgaps of a selection of non-magnetic metal oxides with different equilibrium structures19 within an absolute deviation of 0.5 eV—an accuracy sufficient for the present screening study. The computational cost of DFT-GLLB-SC is significantly lower than for many-body perturbation techniques such as the GW approximation and is crucial for the success of the screening. We use the GPAW code20,21 for all calculations presented in the following.
 Fig. 1  DFT calculated bandgaps of selected oxides. Comparison between the theoretical and experimental bandgap of non-magnetic metal oxides in their most stable structure. The gaps are calculated using both the standard PBEsol (blue triangles) and the GLLB-SC functional (red circles). The dashed line represents the perfect matching between experiments and theory. (Details of the calculations with a list of the calculated oxides can be found in Table 1 of the ESI†). 
A cubic perovskite (see structure in Fig. 2C) consists of large 12-coordinated cations at the so-called A sites and small 6-coordinated cations at the B sites. Compounds with different combinations of cation charges in the A and B sites, e.g. 1 + 5, 2 + 4, and 3 + 3, have been found in nature. We consider all the possible combinations of perovskites obtained starting from the non-radioactive metals of the periodic table.
 Fig. 2  (A) DFT calculated heat of formations per atom and bandgaps of perovskite binary metal oxides. (B) Each square represents an oxide with the lower, left triangle showing the formation energy with red indicating stability (and blue instability) while the upper, right triangle showing the bandgap with red indicating an advantageous bandgap in the range 1.5–3.0 eV. White indicates zero bandgap, purple indicates too small a gap, while yellow or blue indicates bandgaps larger than 3 eV. The pure chemical elements are sorted for increasing electronegativity. (C) reports the unit cell of the cubic perovskite structure. Data available at the web address: http://cmr.fysik.dtu.dk/. 
We define the formation energy, ΔE, of the perovskite metal oxides as the energy difference in the following reaction: A(s) + B(s) + 3H2O(g) → ABO3(s) + 3H2(g).(1)
We use water and H2 as reference for O2 instead of molecular oxygen, because the material we are looking for has to work in an aqueous environment. This choice is conservative with respect to O2 because water is more stable than molecular oxygen and hydrogen by 2.46 eV per water molecule. The reaction energy is calculated directly from the DFT total energies of the participating molecules and solids. We estimate the Gibbs free energy of the reaction with water in the liquid phase following Nørskov et al.22 to be within 0.1 eV of the calculated DFT total energy difference. We therefore simply use ΔE for the perovskite oxide to estimate the stability relative to the two metals in their most stable structures.

Fig. 2A summarizes the results for the formation energies per atom and bandgaps for the 2704 investigated oxides in the perovskite structure. In the figure, the square corresponding to a given oxide containing two metals is split into two parts with the lower, left triangle indicating the stability (from red to blue with decreasing stability) and the upper, right triangle the bandgap (Fig. 2B). The data are available in the database Computational Materials Repository,23 developed at CAMD, at the web address http://cmr.fysik.dtu.dk/.
The stability of a compound can be seen to be the result of three factors: (i) the sum of the possible oxidation numbers of the two metals has to be equal to 6 since the three oxygen atoms in the unit cell require 2 electrons each in order to form a compound without free charge; (ii) the radii of the A and B ions have to be in reasonable proportions and (iii) elements with low electronegativity are preferable for forming bonds with oxygen. The last factor is more relevant for the atoms in the A site due to the nonequivalence of the A and B ion positions.
The second design criterion we focus on is the size of the bandgap which we require to be in the range 1.5 eV to 3 eV. The lower limit comes about as the water-splitting threshold of 1.23 eV plus ∼0.25 eV to account for the electrochemical overpotentials.3 A more realistic limit may be even higher since the splitting of the quasi-Fermi level is smaller than the gap when the SC is under illumination.24 However, for tandem cells the lower bandgap limit is relevant.3 Beyond the higher limit of 3.0 eV too little of the solar spectrum is left to be of interest. Depending on construction of the solar cell device, the light capture in a cell may be thin or thick and we therefore perform the search for either the direct or the indirect gap. The color scale applied for the bandgap in Fig. 2 is chosen so that red indicates a gap in the design window. Compounds with good stabilities and gaps can thus be spotted as red squares.
We note that in accordance with Aguiar et al.,25 the bandgap is seen to decrease when increasing the electronegativity of the B ion or when increasing the crystallographic symmetry by adjusting the size of the A ion.
The stabilities and the bandgaps are somewhat correlated as can be seen in Fig. 3, where the pale orange area indicates the region we are interested in. It is a challenge to combine a small gap with a high stability. However, quite a few of the compounds with very small or zero bandgap also exhibit high stability. To this group belong all the perovskites with an odd number of electrons for which the bands at the Fermi level are not completely filled or empty even if considering the possibility of a spin up and spin down occupation.
 Fig. 3  Correlation between the heat of formation per atom and the bandgap for the oxide (black circles) and oxynitride (red squares) compounds. The region for candidates for solar light harvesting corresponds to the orange area. 
At this stage the screening identifies 43 binary oxides which fulfill the two design criteria: ΔE < 0.2 eV/atom and 1.5 < bandgap < 3.0 eV where we allow for a small positive energy of 0.2 eV/atom to allow for mildly metastable compounds. Many of the resulting candidates are in fact unstable towards a combination of restructuring and decomposition and we therefore expand our pool of reference systems used to assess stability to include not only the bulk metals but also the most stable single- and bi-metal oxides in their equilibrium structures as listed in the ICSD19 and the Materials Genome26,27 databases.
An additional criteria to stability and bandgap is the position of the band edges: for evolving both hydrogen and oxygen, the calculated gap should straddle both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution potentials (horizontal lines in Fig. 4). To estimate the band edges, we use an empirical method suggested and investigated by Butler and Ginley28 and validated by Xu and Schoonen.29 The scheme proceeds by positioning the middle of the gap at E0 + (χAχBχ3O)1/5, where E0 is the difference between the normal hydrogen electrode level and vacuum (E0 = −4.5 eV) and χM denotes the electronegativity of the neutral atom M in the Mulliken scale, and the two edges are obtained by adding or subtracting half of the gap.
 Fig. 4  The identified oxides and oxynitrides in the cubic perovskite structure with potential for splitting water in visible light. The figure shows the calculated band edges for both the direct (red) and indirect (black) gaps. The levels for hydrogen and oxygen evolution are also indicated. 
After considering the more stringent stability criterion and the positions of the band edges the procedure results in only 10 binary oxides as candidate materials as indicated in the left part of Fig. 4. (A more detailed list is found in Table 2 and Fig. 1 of the ESI† ). Some of these compounds are actually known to exist in other periodic structures, but including those in the pool of references does not change the list of candidates. However, two of the materials (SrSnO3 and CaSnO3) undergo lattice distortions and thereby obtain larger gaps beyond the visible light absorption limit. Two compounds are already known in the cubic perovskite structure: AgNbO3 and BaSnO3. Of these, AgNbO3 is well-known to split water in visible light in the presence of sacrificial reagents,30 while BaSnO3 performs less well because of defect-assisted recombination.31 It can be noted that if we relax the criterion on the bandgap we find oxides which can split water in UV light. 10 materials, like AgTaO3 and SrTiO3, which are well known to split water in UV light,12 have a gap in a range between 3 and 4 eV. To our knowledge no other cubic perovskites that can split water in visible light have been identified, and we therefore conclude that the screening procedure performs well and we turn our attention to the more unexplored territory of oxynitrides.
The oxynitrides are especially interesting from the point of view of the gap position relative to the energy levels for hydrogen and oxygen evolution. This is because the valence band (VB) edge is usually dominated by N p-orbitals which are higher in energy than the O p-orbitals, that mainly compose the VB of the oxides.
Using the same approach as for the oxides, we screen the possible combinations of two metals in the oxynitride cubic perovskite structure (ABO2N) using the same three design criteria as for the oxides, where we now also include the most stable single- and bi-metal nitrides (MxNy and M1xM2yNz) and the single-metal oxynitrides (MxNyOz) in the pool of reference systems. The chemical potential of a nitrogen atom is taken from the nitrogen molecule.

Fig. 5 reports the results for the formation energies per atom and bandgaps for the 2704 oxynitrides with the cubic perovskite structure. As also shown in Fig. 3, the oxygen substitution is followed by a general reduction in the size of the bandgap. The effect of more general anion substitution especially in relation to the size and the position of the bandgap is relevant for the design of new materials able to split water. An investigation of those effects will be performed in the future.
 Fig. 5  DFT calculated heat of formations per atom and bandgaps of perovskite binary metal oxynitrides. The color bars are the same as used in Fig. 2. 
The resulting five best candidates are shown in Fig. 4 and in more detail in Table 3 and Fig. 2 of the ESI.† Four of these combinations are already known (BaTaO2N, SrTaO2N, CaTaO2N and LaTiO2N) and perform well for hydrogen evolution.32 In fact, these compounds are, to our knowledge, the only cubic perovskite oxynitrides which have been shown experimentally to split water. We take this as a strong validation of our approach. The last compound, MgTaO2N, has not yet been investigated experimentally.
Conclusions
In summary we have demonstrated that fast computational screening with respect to stability and bandgap is an efficient way to discover new light harvesting materials for water splitting. The method is based on a special exchange-correlation functional that produces sufficiently reliable bandgaps at low computational cost. The method is verified by screening 2704 oxides with the cubic perovskite structure in order to find the best candidate for photoelectrolytic hydrogen production by water splitting. Ten materials, of which two are already known, fulfilled the requirements set up in the screening. This remarkable result shows the strength of the screening approach. We have continued with screening of oxynitrides in the same structure and found five possible candidates of which four are already known. To the best of our knowledge, the set of 15 candidates coming out from our screening includes all the compounds in the cubic perovskite structure that are known to be suitable for water splitting. It seems natural to move forward with the method for other materials that are relevant for photocatalytic water splitting or other related technologies, like thin film solar cells.
