    , Accepted 1st May 2012First published on 3rd May 2012AbstractPhotocorrosion, that causes rapid deactivation of Cu2O photocatalysts, was addressed by incorporating this oxide in a composite with reduced graphene oxide which acts as an electron acceptor to extract photogenerated electrons from Cu2O. Cu2O–rGO composite engineering also allows enhancing significantly photocatalytic activities of Cu2O for H2 generation.
The exploitation of renewable, carbon-free energy sources is one of the greatest challenges confronting us to address the increasing energy demand of our society and environmental issues associated with the use of fossil energy. Solar energy is the largest source available to us and can be converted into electricity through the photoelectric effect for direct use or stored in batteries.1 Alternatively, it can be converted into chemical energy stored within chemical bonds of reduced compounds such as hydrogen, methanol, methane, etc., i.e. solar fuels, ideally by employing a photo-electrochemical cell.2 In principle, a photo-electrochemical cell consists of a photoanode to capture solar energy and convert it into oxidative potential that is subsequently used for extracting electrons from water via water oxidation reaction eqn (1), and a cathode or photocathode to employ these energised electrons for hydrogen generation via proton reduction eqn (2): 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e(1) 2H+ + 2e → H2(2)
To efficiently exploit the solar spectrum, visible light absorption materials are preferred. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O), a direct band gap (2.17 eV) p-type semiconductor, appears as an attractive metal oxide photocathode material. It can also be easily used for large-scale applications as it is non-toxic, widely abundant and relatively cheap. Theoretical calculation estimated a maximal photocurrent of 14.7 mA cm−2 and an optimal solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of up to 18% based on the AM1.5 spectrum.3 Even though Cu2O has been reported as a visible light photocatalyst for H2 generation3–6 it suffers from the photo-corrosion phenomenon since the potentials of its reduction and oxidation into copper metallic and CuO lie within the band gap. As a photocathode, the photogenerated hole in Cu2O can be efficiently suppressed by electrons driven from photoanode or from a sacrificial electron donor. The limiting factor for the photostability of Cu2O is how fast the photogenerated electrons can be extracted from this material and used for driving hydrogen production to prevent or mitigate the self-reduction reaction. Combining Cu2O with an appropriate n-type semiconductor such as TiO2, ZnO, etc., which has more positive conduction bands, in an n–p junction allows efficient transport of photogenerated electrons from Cu2O to the n-type semiconductor conduction band that results in improving photostability of Cu2O.3,7–9
Herein we report the utilization of a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer to improve the photocatalytic activities as well as photostability of Cu2O nanoparticles. The schematic of composite photocatalyst engineering and its function is presented in Fig. 1. In this Cu2O–rGO composite, rGO acts as the electron acceptor to extract photogenerated electrons from Cu2O, thus resulting in an increased charge separation efficiency within this oxide semiconductor, while limiting its self-photoreduction process. With this, hydrogen photo-generation activities and stability of the Cu2O–rGO composite in neutral aqueous solution were found to be significantly higher than those found for pristine Cu2O.

Carbon nanomaterials (graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and C60) are being largely exploited as a smart support for engineering advanced materials for solar-to-energy conversion applications, thanks to their outstanding thermal and chemical stability, high specific surface area, etc. When composited with semiconductor, these carbon nanostructured supports act as good electron acceptors that help enhance charge separation within the semiconductor. As a result, enhancing photocatalytic activities were reported for semiconductor–CNT composites compared with the corresponding pristine semiconductor.10–13 Similar positive effects were achieved for semiconductor–rGO composites including TiO2–rGO,14,15 ZnO–rGO,16 CdS–rGO,15,17–19 mpg–CNx–rGO,20 and BiVO4–rGO.21 Since the Cu2O conduction band lies at a more negative potential than those of ZnO and TiO2 and at the same level to that of CdS,22 it is reasonable to expect similar electron accepting properties for the Cu2O–rGO composite.
To synthesize the Cu2O–rGO composite, copper(II) acetate (Cu(Ac)2) precursor was first loaded onto graphene oxide sheets (GO) dispersed in an aqueous solution. A similar strategy was employed by Kim and Park for loading the Cu(Ac)2 precursor onto the oxidized-CNTs surface.12 Both GO and oxidized-CNTs contain –COOH, –CHO, etc. functional groups that act as anchoring sites for the copper precursor. Treatment of the resulted GO–Cu(Ac)2 with NaOH solution resulted in precipitation of Cu(OH)2 on the GO surface which was subsequently reduced into Cu2O by using glucose solution at 100 °C. The Cu2O–rGO weight ratio was varied by varying the amount of Cu(Ac)2 and GO precursors assuming that the Cu(Ac)2 to Cu2O and GO to rGO conversion yields are unity. Pristine Cu2O was prepared by a similar procedure without using the GO support. To accelerate the hydrogen photo-generation process, we employed a platinum nanoparticles co-catalyst in this study. Platinum loading on Cu2O–rGO was kept at 1 wt%. To achieve this, a pre-calculated quantity of K2PtCl6 precursor was added into Cu(OH)2–GO suspension with glucose, which reduced this precursor into Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures. For simplicity in our discussion, we denote our composite as Cu2O–rGO(x) where x is the Cu2O–GO weight ratio.
We first investigated the morphology, chemical composition, and absorption properties of our composites by TEM, XRD, EDX and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 2A shows TEM and HRTEM images of the Cu2O–rGO(15) composite, which reveal homogeneous distribution of Cu2O nanoparticles (grain size of ∼10 nm) on rGO sheets. It was found that agglomeration of Cu2O particles occurred when the Cu2O content was increased. Larger size Cu2O particles (10–30 nm) were found on graphene sheets in the Cu2O–rGO(25) composite (Fig. 2B and S1†). XRD analysis clearly confirmed that the obtained deposits were Cu2O crystals (Fig. 2C). Platinum was not observed in either TEM or XRD analyses due to its low content in the Cu2O–rGO materials. Platinum signals were however found in EDX analysis (Fig. S2†). The control experiment clearly confirmed that black Pt nanoparticles were produced from the K2PtCl6 precursor in aqueous glucose solution at 100 °C. Fig. 2D shows UV-vis absorption spectra of pristine Cu2O and Cu2O–rGO composites. As expected, Cu2O–rGO composites showed higher absorption intensity in visible light compared with pristine Cu2O nanoparticles due to the additional absorption by rGO. Absorption intensity increased with increasing rGO content. Absorption of the rGO support does however compete with that of Cu2O. To achieve the highest activity for light-to-hydrogen conversion, the content of rGO within the composite was optimised. We found that Cu2O–rGO(x) composites with 15 ≤ x ≤ 25 were the best to fulfil two critical requirements: (i) having sufficient rGO support material to ensure high dispersion of Cu2O nanoparticles, and (ii) ensuring that rGO absorption does not reduce the light absorption of Cu2O.

We have investigated the photoelectrochemical properties of Cu2O–rGO composites as a photocathode for photo-assisted reduction of protons to hydrogen. For this propose, the Cu2O–rGO(15) composite was deposited as a thin film onto Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) by spin coating a suspension of this composite in ethanol. After drying overnight in a vacuum oven, a homogeneous film was obtained (Fig. S3†). A 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at pH7 was used as electrolyte solution, which represented the best compromise between activity and stability of the composites. Under visible light irradiation (150 W xenon lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter as a visible light source; power density on the FTO electrode was 100 mW cm−2), a photocurrent of 0.12 mA cm−2 was obtained at an applied bias of −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.23 V vs. RHE), which is four (4) times higher than that achieved for the pristine Cu2O/FTO electrode (0.03 mA cm−2) (Fig. 3A). This photocurrent enhancement clearly indicated that rGO acts as an electron acceptor that helps enhance charge separation within the Cu2O semiconductor.

(A) Transient photocurrent at bias −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.23 V vs. RHE) for the Cu2O/FTO electrode (square dots) and the Cu2O/rGO(15)/FTO electrode (bulk) using pH7 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer electrolyte solution, 100 mW cm−2 visible light irradiation. (B) Hydrogen photogeneration from methanol–H2O solution (v/v, 2/8) using Cu2O nanoparticles (i), mixture of Cu2O nanoparticles and rGO (25/1, w/w) (ii), and Cu2O–rGO(x) composite photocatalysts (x = 50 (iii), 15 (iv), 25 (v)). 
When we investigated the photostability of our Cu2O based photocathodes it was found that both pristine Cu2O and Cu2O–rGO(15) composite photoelectrodes showed stable photocurrent for at least 1 h under light irradiation in on–off mode (5 min irradiation and 5 min under dark condition per cycle). However, given that both catalytic reduction of protons into H2 and self-photoreduction of Cu2O into Cu can contribute to the photocurrent observed, we determined photo-to-hydrogen efficiency to assay photostability of Cu2O based photocathodes. At an applied bias of −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the Cu2O/rGO/FTO electrode generated 0.41 Coulomb photoelectrons after 1 h of irradiation and 1.4 μmol H2 was produced giving a faradic yield of 65% (Fig. S4†). This photocurrent-to-hydrogen yield is far from unity suggesting that part of the photocurrent (ca. 35%) was used in self-reduction of Cu2O into Cu. This was further confirmed by XRD analysis which showed the appearance of new Cu peaks at 2θ 43.5° and 50.6° (Fig. S5†). The self-photoreduction is more significant for Cu2O/FTO without graphene support. Only 70 nmol H2 was found after a 0.13 Coulomb photoelectron was generated (faradic yield of 10%).
In the above experiments, we applied a bias (0.23 V vs. RHE) to suppress photogenerated holes and drive photogenerated electrons to reduce protons to H2. Alternatively hole suppression can be achieved by using a sacrificial electron donor, such as methanol, Na2S/Na2SO3, etc. We chose to use methanol–H2O solution (2/8, v/v) and investigate the photocatalytic activities of the Cu2O–rGO composite for hydrogen evolution. In so doing we used a closed 50 mL Schlenk tube as the reaction vessel and adjusted the visible light source (150 W xenon lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter) to 100 mW cm−2 at the reactor surface. Gas produced during irradiation was sampled and analyzed by gas chromatography. Fig. 3B shows hydrogen evolution for Pt decorated-Cu2O nanoparticles without graphene support (curve (i)) and different Pt decorated-Cu2O–rGO(x) composites (curves (iii)–(v)). A control experiment employing pristine Cu2O nanoparticles without Pt nanoparticles decoration produced only trace of hydrogen. It was found that H2 generation reached a plateau after 5 h of irradiation using a Pt decorated-Cu2O nanoparticles photocatalyst indicating the complete deactivation of the Cu2O photocatalyst due to the self-photoreduction of this oxide into Cu0. Photoinstability of a Pt-decorated Cu2O thin film was also reported.3 We note that platinum is the best electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. Therefore, the deactivation of Pt-decorated Cu2O nanoparticles is likely due to less efficient interfacial interaction between Pt and Cu2O nanoparticles which could not allow an efficient electron injection from excited Cu2O to Pt catalyst. rGO has high specific surface area that allows enhancing interface with Cu2O nanoparticles. As a consequence, we observed longer lifetimes for all Cu2O–rGO composite photocatalysts compared with that of Cu2O nanoparticles, consistent with higher current-to-hydrogen efficiencies measured for composites. There was a linear evolution of H2 up to 15 h before achieving a plateau using a composite photocatalyst while the Cu2O nanoparticles photocatalyst without rGO support was completely deactivated after 5 h. We also performed a control experiment by employing a mixture of pristine Cu2O nanoparticles and rGO as a photocatalyst (Cu2O–rGO weight ratio was 25/1). This mixture showed comparable catalytic H2 photogeneration efficiency to that obtained for Cu2O nanoparticles without graphene support and it is significantly lower than those achieved for Cu2O–rGO hybrids (Fig. 3B, curve (ii)). This result indicates that physical mixing of Cu2O nanoparticles and rGO sheets does not result in an efficient charge transport at the Cu2O–rGO junction. Agglomeration of Cu2O into few hundred nm nanoparticles can be the reason for its poor interaction with rGO. In contrast, when Cu2O was grown in situ on graphene sheets, the latter acts as a stabilizer to ensure effective dispersion of small Cu2O nanoparticles (few ten nm particles) that resulted in a good electron transport between Cu2O and the rGO electron acceptor.
Along with enhancing photostability, employing a graphene electron acceptor resulted in a significant enhancement of photocatalytic activities of Cu2O nanoparticles (Fig. 3B, S6 and S7†) that consists with the increasing of photocurrent (Fig. 3A). However, it was found that employing an electrocatalyst for H2 evolution as a co-catalyst is still required. The control Cu2O–rGO(25) sample without Pt nanoparticles co-catalyst loading produced only trace of hydrogen. With 1 wt% Pt nanoparticles co-catalyst, highest H2 generation efficiency was achieved for the Cu2O–rGO(25) composite with an average H2 production rate of 264.5 μmol H2 gcat−1 h−1 that represents a factor of 3.5 higher efficiency compared with Cu2O nanoparticles without graphene. This catalytic enhancement is comparable to those reported for CdS–GO composites.15,17 It was found that H2 generation efficiency slightly depended on rGO and Cu2O content in the composites. Both higher rGO and lower rGO content have less efficiency. Increasing rGO content resulted in light absorption competition for Cu2O, whereas decreasing rGO content caused agglomeration of Cu2O nanoparticles. Both phenomena caused a decrease in the light harvesting efficiency of Cu2O that translated into lower catalytic efficiencies.
To conclude, we have shown that by utilizing graphene sheets as an electron acceptor the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production using visible light and photostability of Cu2O are significantly enhanced due to the formation of a p–n Cu2O–rGO junction. It was found that in situ growth and stabilization of Cu2O nanoparticles onto graphene sheets are required to achieve a good p–n Cu2O–rGO junction.
