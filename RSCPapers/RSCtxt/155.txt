    , Accepted 7th June 2021First published on 7th June 2021AbstractOxy-fluoride nano-crystallized glass-ceramics (NGCs), with integrated advantages of amorphous glasses and fluoride crystals, show great potential for applications in lighting, information storage and lasers. However, the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of traditional NGCs are restricted by the difficulty in the incorporation of the number of active ions into crystal structures due to the mismatch of the radius in the ionic substitution process. Herein, an in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy is proposed for the design and fabrication of NGCs with high PLQY. The strategy is suitable the precipitation of all kinds of rare-earth-fluoride nanocrystals in glasses and thus dramatically enhances the PL efficiency in upconversion and down-shifting emission. The upconversion PLQY of designed NGCs (2.77%) is 3 times larger than that of well-established NGC containing β-NaYF4 crystals (0.78%), which have widely been considered the most efficient NGC for upconversion luminescence. Moreover, the designed NGCs also exhibit higher optical transmittance and PL behaviors show more excellent photo-thermal stability, in comparison with that of traditional NGCs. Most importantly, low-threshold, high-slope-efficiency microsphere lasers have been successfully demonstrated by leveraging our well-designed NGCs. This strategy opens a new avenue for the design and fabrication of highly efficient optical gain micro-/nanomaterials for applications in emerging photonics devices.
1. Introduction
Rare earth (RE) ion-doped luminescent materials are garnering increasing interest owing to their potential in diverse applications in lighting, optical communication, microscopy, spectroscopy, and lasers.1–8 Among them, RE ion-activated fiber lasers play vital roles in national defenses, industrial manufactures, and chemical treatments.9–15 Generally, photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of the fiber laser materials are governed by the coordinated environments of RE ions in the host materials.16 Fluoride crystals, providing an environment featuring intrinsically low phonon energy, have been regarded as one of the most efficient host materials for photoluminescence (PL) ranging from ultraviolet to infrared windows.17–24 However, it's difficult to fabricate bulk or fiber counterparts from fluoride crystals, which prevent their applications in fiber lasers. Fortunately, this difficulty can be ideally overcome via the construction of oxy-fluoride nano-crystallized glass-ceramics (NGCs), which integrates excellent features of fluoride crystals (low phonon energy, high PL efficiency, etc.) with oxide glasses (easy fabrication of optical fiber, high optical transmittance, high thermodynamic stability, etc.).25–29
In past studies, traditional oxy-fluoride NGCs are designed and fabricated via a crystallization process governed by the host of precursor glass (PG).30–35 The compositions of glasses are elaborate and a large number of fluoride nanocrystals, including NaLn (Ln = Y, Lu, Gd)F4, LaF3, YF3, and KSc2F7 are precipitated from host glasses. For the enhancement of PLQY of NGCs, active RE ions are expected to enter these fluoride crystal structures via ionic substitution processes for Y3+, Lu3+, Gd3+, La3+ or Sc3+ ions, which usually possessed large ionic radius and occupied 12 or 8-coordinated sites in crystal structures. In these cases, the incorporation of RE ions into crystal structures are uncontrollable and lattice distortion might occur during the ionic substitution process. Actually, the quantity of active ions incorporated into crystal structures is usually small due to a severe mismatch of ionic radius between RE ions and substitutable ions. As a result, the PLQYs of these NGCs are much lower than those of crystal materials. Moreover, many remaining crystals not occupied by RE ions have no contribution to the enhancement of luminescence but will trigger severe issues of optical scattering and low optical transmittance in the glass. Alternatively, RE-fluoride crystals, e.g., NaYbF4, KYb2F7, and NaErF4,36–38 were designed to precipitate in NGCs for incorporation of other active RE ions to further decrease the resistance of ionic substitution, because the issue of ionic radius mismatch among different RE ions is quite small. For the precipitation of such RE-fluoride nanocrystals in NGCs, a large number of RE-fluorides (YbF3 or ErF3) are added into the compositions of glasses to replace the fluorides (LaF3, YF3, LuF3, etc.) in the traditional oxy-fluoride NGCs that acted as a part of the hosts to construct fluoride crystals rather than worked as dopants for luminescent centers. For example, Er: KYb2F7 NGCs containing 6.0 mol% YbF3 in compositions have been demonstrated to possess efficient upconversion (UC) luminescence when Er3+ easily entered the fluoride crystal lattices by substitution of Yb3+.39 Actually, the high-concentration RE ions in NGCs lead to heavy absorption of the exciting light and increased the probability of non-radiative transitions. In this case, the thermal effects of NGCs are huge and the thermal quenching of luminescence is severe, preventing their practical applications in photonic devices. To address these issues, it is highly desirable for the design and fabrication of novel NGCs with properties of highly efficient photoluminescence, weak thermal quenching of luminescence, and controllable incorporation of RE ions into the fluoride nanocrystals.
In this work, a strategy of in situ inducing nano-crystallization of RE-fluoride crystals by dopants, based on phase-separated glasses, is proposed to design a high-quality and high-efficiency oxy-fluoride NGCs. For this strategy, RE ions are confined within the compactly phase-separated fluoride networks, nano-crystallization occurred depending on the doping of RE ions and all RE ions are controllably and spontaneously incorporated into the fluoride crystal environments in the NGCs. Benefitting from the controllable nano-crystallization of this strategy, the NGCs exhibit high optical transmittance, highly efficient UC and down-shifting (DS) emissions and more thermally stable luminescence than that of the traditional NGCs. Moreover, the UC luminescence of our designed NGC possesses high PLQY, which is 3 and 7 times higher in comparison with that of the traditional NGCs containing β-NaYF4 and KYb2F7 crystals, respectively. Furthermore, lower-threshold and enhanced-slope-efficiency single-mode lasers were obtained in NGC microspheres as compared to those in PG microspheres. The nano-crystallization strategy successfully solves the key problem in engineering optical gain glass with co-existing performances of high optical transmittance, highly efficient luminescence, and excellent photo-thermal stability. More importantly, the strategy provides a significant opportunity for exploiting a variety of functional optical micro-/nanomaterials to be used in emerging photonic devices, in particular, special functional fiber lasers.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Samples with the nominal composition of (in mol%) xSiO2–(100− x)/2KF–(100 − x)/2ZnF2 (x = 50, 60 and 70) were chosen as host glasses. These samples will be referred to as 50Si-PG, 60Si-PG and 70Si-PG, respectively. REF3 was selected as a dopant source for the doping of RE ions. The doping concentrations of RE ions were set from 0.1 to 1.5 mol%. The glasses were fabricated by a melt-quenching method.16 A 20 g reagent grade stoichiometric mixture of SiO2, KF, ZnF2, YbF3, and ErF3 was mixed thoroughly in an agate mortar put into covered quartz crucibles and melted in an electric furnace at 1400–1550 °C for 20 min under ambient atmospheric conditions. Then, the melts were poured onto a brass plate and pressed by another brass plate to obtain PGs. The PG samples were heated at 520 °C to obtain 50, 60 and 70Si-NGCs according to differential thermal analysis (DTA) results as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The fabrication details of the traditional NGCs containing KYb2F7 and β-NaYF4 nanocrystals and the fabrication techniques of microspheres are presented in the “Experimental section” in ESI.†
2.2 Characterization
DTA experiments were performed using a STA449C Jupiter (Netzsch, Germany) in an argon atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 in the range of 25 to 800 °C to determine the heat treatment temperature. To identify the crystalline phase in NGCs, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D8 advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Switzerland) with Cu/Ka (λ = 0.1541 nm) radiation. For performing the morphological and element analysis, high angle annular dark field transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-TEM) and elemental mapping patterns were measured using FEI Talos F200x (FEI, USA), operating at 200 kV with the current on the specimen as ∼50 pA. TEM samples were prepared by mechanical polishing and ion-beam milling techniques to about 40 nm in thickness. Transmission spectra were measured using a UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA). UC and DS emission spectra of samples were recorded by using an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh, UK). A 980 nm laser diode was used as the excitation source. The emission decay curves were measured using the same spectrometer. A microsecond lamp was used as the excitation source. PLQYs of samples were measured using the same spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Lasing from the microspheres was detected using an optical spectrum analyzer (Yokogawa, Japan). A single-mode 980 nm laser diode was used as a pumped source for lasing from the facilely designed microspheres.
2.3 Simulation
In order to produce a structural model of the glass samples, classical MD simulations were performed via LAMMPS (large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator).40 The details of the simulations are presented in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
The schematic diagram of the in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy is shown in Fig. 1. In this work, an oxy-fluoride glass possessing phase-separated network structures was designed as the host glass. According to ligand field theory, RE ions possessing a large radius are preferred to locate in the fluoride networks rather than the silicon-oxygen networks.41 Thus, RE ions are confined within the fluoride-rich networks in the phase-separated glass (left). Ionic diffusion and rearrangement occur around RE ions in the fluoride-rich regions of the glass via appropriate heat treatments because RE ions possess a large ionic radius and high potential (middle). Thus, RE-fluoride nanocrystals were expected to be in situ precipitated in the NGCs via the heat treatment and all the RE ions were spontaneously incorporated into the fluoride nanocrystals (right), which exhibited low phonon energy and provided excellent environments for high-efficiency luminescence, rather than through the ionic substitution process of the traditional NGCs. Therefore, the nano-crystallization and the photoluminescence properties of NGCs can be intelligently governed by the doping of RE ions. These approaches offer significant opportunities for the design and fabrication of optical gain materials with highly efficient photoluminescence.

To validate the possibility of our idea, an oxy-fluoride glass system was carefully exploited for the following studies on the design and fabrication of optical gain micro-/nanomaterials and their photonic applications. XRD patterns of the host NGCs are shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), no feature of RE-fluoride nanocrystals can be found in the host NGCs without dopants, and the crystalline volume fraction for K2SiF6 in 70Si-NGC is smaller due to the higher viscosity in glass networks. XRD patterns of Yb3+ doped NGCs were measured (Fig. S2b, ESI†) as a representative investigation for the nano-crystallization in RE ions doped NGCs. Interestingly, the diffraction peaks of cubic KYb3F10 (NO. 74-2204) nanocrystals are observed in the XRD patterns of 0.5Yb3+ doped 60 and 70Si-NGCs, apart from the features of K2SiF6 nanocrystals. Moreover, it was also found that KYb3F10 crystals are easier to precipitate in Yb3+ doped 70Si-NGC. This is an anomalous nano-crystallization phenomenon because 70Si-NGC contains more SiO2 and possesses a higher viscosity in glass networks, which provides a large barrier for crystallization and is bad for the precipitation of fluoride nanocrystals.
Furthermore, the crystalline phases in the 70Si-PG and NGCs are carefully investigated. PG exhibits an amorphous state and the diffraction peaks of KYb3F10 crystals are enhanced dramatically by the increase of heat treatment temperature (Fig. S2c, ESI†). More interestingly, KYb3F10 crystals are precipitated in 70Si-NGC even when the doped concentration of Yb3+ is as low as 0.1 mol%, as presented in Fig. 2a. The intensities of diffraction peaks for KYb3F10 crystals enhance monotonously when the concentration of Yb3+ is increased from 0.1 to 1.5 mol%. However, the diffraction peaks of K2SiF6 crystals become weak along with the increase of Yb3+ content. By doping of 1.5 mol% Yb3+, crystallization in 70Si-NGC is absolutely different from that of the un-doped counterpart, and only KYb3F10 crystals are precipitated in NGC with heat-treatment. These results indicate that the nano-crystallization in the 70Si-NGC is highly dependent on the doping of Yb3+. The precipitation of RE-fluoride nanocrystals in NGCs is induced by the dopants, called the in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy in this work.

The TEM, HAADF-TEM images and 2D elemental mapping patterns of 1.5Yb3+ doped 70Si-NGC are shown in Fig. 2b–g. Fig. 2b shows that the nanocrystals are in situ precipitated among the glass matrix. The measured size of these nanoparticles is from 2 to 20 nm. The HAADF-TEM image, as shown in Fig. 2c, presents the magnified region containing several nanocrystals in the NGC. The TEM-mapping patterns (Fig. 2d, f, g) reveal that the distribution of Yb, F and K elements matches well with that of nanocrystal particles (Fig. 2b). Whereas, the distribution profile of Si elements is opposite to that of Yb, F and K elements in the nanocrystal particles. These results are clear evidence that only KYb3F10 nanocrystals are precipitated and no K2SiF6 crystal is precipitated in the NGCs. Moreover, the high contrast of the distribution profile for the Yb element indicates that most Yb elements are distributed in the crystal structures, directly proving that Yb3+ are thoroughly incorporated into the fluoride crystal structures in NGC after the heat-treatment.
To reveal the micro-level mechanism of the interesting nano-crystallizations and evolution of crystalline phases in the NGCs, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 1.5Yb3+ doped 70Si-PGs were performed and the local structure snapshots containing silicon and fluorine phases are shown in Fig. 2h. 70Si-PG exhibits an absolute and compact droplet phase-separation network structure. [SiO4] units built the framework of glass and [ZnF6] units constructing the separated fluoride networks. Moreover, the distribution patterns of K elements (Fig. 2i) show that most K+ distributes in the interface between silicon-rich and fluorine-rich phases to balance the valence of non-bridging oxygens and F− bond. According to the nano-crystallization kinetics theory,42 nanocrystals are preferentially precipitated in the low viscosity region of the glass network due to the low barrier for nano-crystallization. K+ ions, acting as network modifiers, can significantly reduce the viscosity of glass networks.43 Thus, K2SiF6 nanocrystals are precipitated near the interfaces of the two phases due to the interface-induced effects and lower viscosity via the gathering of K+ in the un-doped 70Si-NGC.
The distribution pattern (Fig. 2j) of Yb in 70Si-PG matches well with that of the separated fluoride networks, indicating that Yb3+ ions are all distributed within the compact fluoride environments. Yb3+, possessing a large ionic radius and large potential, works as nano-crystallization centers in the phase-separated glass networks.44 A large number of F− and K+ ions diffuse, rearrange and aggregate around Yb3+ ions to form KYb3F10 nanocrystals during the heat-treatment processes when Yb3+ ions are distributed within a short distance. Thus, the doping of Yb3+ directly leads to the precipitation of KYb3F10 nanocrystals in 70Si-NGC. For the high-doping NGC, a large quantity of F− and K+ ions are consumed to preferentially form KYb3F10 nanocrystals. As a consequence, the precipitation of K2SiF6 nanocrystals becomes quite difficult, while only KYb3F10 nanocrystals are precipitated in 1.5Yb3+ doped 70Si-NGC.
To further confirm the superiority of the 70Si-PG system for the in situ nano-crystallization, we also modeled the situations of 50Si-PG and 60Si-PG systems by MD simulation. The 50Si-PG system exhibits interpenetrating phase-separation networks (Fig. S3a, ESI†). Though a large number of K+ ions are distributed in the fluoride-rich regions (Fig. S3b, ESI†), KYb3F10 nanocrystals are difficult to precipitate in 50Si-NGC, due to longer distances between Yb3+ ions caused by the more dispersive distribution of Yb3+ in the interpenetrating phase-separation networks of 50Si-PG (Fig. S3c, ESI†). For the 60Si-PG system, the droplet phase separation emerges from the interpenetrating phase-separation region (Fig. S3d, ESI†). The distribution of Yb3+ is also more dispersive than that of 70Si-PG (Fig. S3f, ESI†), resulting in longer distances between Yb3+ and the smaller number of KYb3F10 nanocrystals precipitated in 60Si-NGC. Accordingly, the distribution of Yb3+ in the compactly phase-separated glass networks is mainly responsible for the in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization of KYb3F10 nanocrystals in 70Si-NGCs. Hence, the 70Si-NGC system is the most suitable for the controllable nano-crystallization of RE-fluoride nanocrystals in glass solids and for the thorough incorporation of RE into fluoride environments, providing great potential for the design and fabrication of highly efficient optical gain micro-/nanomaterials.
The transmission spectra of 1.0Yb3+ doped 70Si-PG and 70Si-NGC are shown in Fig. 3a. The main absorption peaks at 976 nm are observed in Yb3+ doped samples, which are attributed to the Yb3+:2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transitions. Owing to the optical scattering caused by the differences in refractive indexes between crystals and the glass matrix, the transmittance of NGC is lower than that of the PG sample in the range of 300–900 nm. The NGC is still transparent as presented in the inset in Fig. 3a and possesses high transmittance to about 90% at 650 nm with a thickness of 2.0 mm. However, transmittances of 50Si-NGC and 60Si-NGC decrease heavily in comparison with the corresponding PGs (Fig. S4a, ESI†), due to the main precipitation of KZnF3 and K2SiF6 crystals that possess larger size than KYb3F10 crystals (Fig. S2, ESI†). It is also found from Fig. S4b (ESI†) that the NGC containing β-NaYF4 crystals (XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S5, ESI†) possess a much lower transmittance in the visible region (∼49% at 650 nm), due to serious light scattering of large nanocrystal particles. In traditional β-NaYF4 NGC, the crystallization is governed by the host compositions (12 mol% YF3 and 7 mol% NaF) with high concentrations. The average size of crystals is as large as 45.9 nm and the crystalline volume fraction is as high as 37.3% as calculated in Fig. S5 (ESI†). By contrast, the crystallization of KYb3F10 in 70Si-NGC is governed by the small number of doped Yb3+ (1.0 mol%), leading to a smaller mean size (∼10.2 nm) and lower crystalline volume fraction (5.1%) as calculated from Fig. 2a. More interestingly, the transmittance of 70Si-NGC can be effectively regulated by the doping concentration of Yb3+, as shown in Fig. 3b and the inset. The transmittance increases obviously when the doping concentration is increased from 0% to 1.5%, due to the more precipitation of KYb3F10 nanocrystals that exhibit smaller dimensions than K2SiF6 nanocrystals. Therefore, the optical transmittance of the designed NGC is also governed by the doping of Yb3+ ions and 70Si-NGCs exhibit higher optical transmittance, thanks to the controllably in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization.

(e) UC emission spectra of 1.0Yb3+ doped 70Si-NGC, β-NaYF4 NGC and KYb2F7 NGC upon excitation of 980 nm LD with a power density of 79.2 W cm−2. (f) Photo-thermal-stability of UC emission between Yb3+ doped 70Si-NGCs and KYb2F7 NGC as a function of irradiated times by 980 nm lasers. 
As proved above, for the NGC sample, RE ions are all incorporated into the fluoride crystals, which possess low-phonon-energy environments and act as excellent matrices for efficient luminescence. Since the UC luminescence of Yb3+–Yb3+ pairs is sensitive to local environments, UC emission spectra of Yb3+ doped PG and NGCs were measured to verify the evolution of microstructures in RE doped samples during the heat treatment. As shown in Fig. 3c, upon 980 nm excitation, intense UC emission peaking at ∼480 nm is observed in the 70Si-NGC doped with Yb3+ at as low as 0.1 mol%, which is attributed to the cooperative UC emission process of Yb3+–Yb3+ pairs.45 However, no obvious emission peak is observed in 70Si-PG. Besides, weaker UC emission and no emission peaks were observed in 60Si-NGC and 50Si-NGC, respectively (Fig. S6a, ESI†). As proved by Fig. S2 (ESI†), only KZnF3 nanocrystals are precipitated in Yb3+ doped 50Si-NGC, and K2SiF6 nanocrystals are mainly precipitated in 60Si-NGC, while much more KYb3F10 nanocrystals are precipitated in the 70Si-NGC. Actually, Yb3+ ions are difficult to incorporate into KZnF3 or K2SiF6 nanocrystals due to the lack of an appropriate substitution site. Thus, the precipitation of KZnF3 or K2SiF6 nanocrystals makes no contribution to the UC luminescence of Yb3+–Yb3+ pairs. Owing to the precipitation of KYb3F10 nanocrystals in NGC, Yb3+ ions are all spontaneously incorporated into the fluoride crystal structures featuring low-phonon energy and the ionic distances between Yb3+ get shorter, which are beneficial for UC luminescence of Yb3+–Yb3+ pairs. Therefore, the nano-crystallization of KYb3F10 nanocrystals is responsible for the enhanced UC emission in NGC, and the process is quite easy in the 70Si-NGC system, making it an excellent candidate for the most efficient UC luminescence. The quantity of the precipitated KYb3F10 nanocrystals in the 70Si-NGC increases as the Yb3+ doping concentration increases (Fig. 2a). As a result, the UC emission intensity of Yb3+–Yb3+ pairs firstly increases, reaching a maximum at 1.0 mol% Yb3+, and then decreases when the Yb3+ content is further increased to 1.5 mol% due to the concentration quenching effect as shown in Fig. S6b (ESI†). Moreover, the lifetime of UC emission at 480 nm increases from 306 to 594 μs due to the precipitation of KYb3F10 nanocrystals in the 1.0Yb3+ doped NGC sample (Fig. 3d), indicating Yb3+ ions are well incorporated into the fluoride crystal structures featuring lower-phonon energy compared to glass networks. Additionally, the comparison of UC emission spectra for 1.0Yb3+ doped 70Si-NGC, the NGC containing β-NaYF4 nanocrystals and the traditional RE-fluoride NGC containing KYb2F7 nanocrystals (XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S5, ESI†) is demonstrated in Fig. 3e. No obvious UC emission peaks are observed in 1.0Yb3+ doped NGC containing β-NaYF4 nanocrystals, due to the small number of Yb3+ ions located in the nanocrystal structures. Compared to 70Si-NGC, the UC emission intensity in KYb2F7 NGC is still lower, although 6.0 mol% YbF3 was introduced into the glass. These results indicate that the Yb3+ doped 70Si-NGC designed by this novel nano-crystallization strategy is a more effective matrix for UC luminescence, in comparison to the well-established β-NaYF4 NGC and the classical RE-fluoride NGC containing KYb2F7 nanocrystal systems.
The photo-thermal stability of luminescence using a 980 nm laser was studied, as shown from the data in Fig. 3f. The relative intensity variation of UC emission in 1.0Yb3+ doped 70Si-NGC and the traditional KYb2F7 NGC decrease to 87% and 70%, respectively; after irradiation with a 980 nm laser (power density of 44.6 W cm−2) for 7 min. As shown in Fig. S7a and b (ESI†), irradiated by 980 nm lasers, the temperature on the surface of NGCs increases and the attenuation rate of the UC emission intensity becomes faster, along with the increase with the doping concentration of Yb3+. For KYb2F7 NGC, the temperature increase to 75 °C when irradiated by a 980 nm laser for 7 min, due to the superfluous absorption of excited lasers by the high-concentration doping of Yb3+ (Fig. S4b, ESI†).39 Hence, the thermal stability of luminescence in KYb2F7 NGC is poor and thus prevents its practical applications in photoelectronic devices. Thanks to the in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy, RE-fluoride nanocrystals can be precipitated in NGCs even when the doping concentration is low (0.1 mol%), while they can simultaneously keep highly efficient luminescence, which in turn reduces the thermal quenching of luminescence and thus enhances the photo-thermal-stability of the whole system.
Generally, Yb3+ is used as an excellent sensitizer ion for enhancing UC luminescence of NGCs, due to the large absorption cross-section for 980 nm lasers and efficient energy transfer to other active ions.46–48 The effective UC emission of Yb3+ in the designed NGC provides opportunities for achieving high-efficiency UC luminescence of other RE ions. It is seen from Fig. 4a that UC emissions of Yb3+–Er3+ pairs dramatically enhances in NGC, as compared to those of PG. The lifetime of the UC emission for Er3+ at 650 nm in the sample also increases from 0.29 to 0.99 ms (Fig. 4b) during the heat treatment due to the incorporation of RE ions into K(Yb/Er)3F10 (proved from data in Fig. S8a, ESI†) crystal structures featuring low-phonon energy environments and possessing the low possibility of non-radiative transition.

(c) UC emission spectra and (d) plots of irradiation power dependency on UC PLQY of 1.5Yb3+–0.2Er3+ co-doped 70Si-NGC, KYb2F7-NGC and β-NaYF4 NGC, the inset in (c) are the photos of samples (from left to right: β-NaYF4-NGC, KYb2F7-NGC and 70Si-NGC) irradiated by a 980 nm laser diode with a power density of 5.4 W cm−2. (e) DS emission spectra and (f) emission decay curves monitored at 1535 nm of 0.5Er3+ doped 70Si-PG and NGCs. 
Furthermore, the emission intensity of 1.5Yb3+–0.2Er3+ co-doped 70Si-NGC is even higher than the representative β-NaYF4 and traditional KYb2F7 NGCs (Fig. 4c). Irradiated by using a 980 nm laser diode with a power of 5.4 W cm−2, the 70Si-NGC sample looks much brighter than β-NaYF4 and KYb2F7-NGCs shown in the inset of Fig. 4c. The brightness of 70Si-NGC is even comparable to that of the commercial detection card coated with high-efficiency UC phosphors. The optimally measured PLQY values of β-NaYF4 and KYb2F7 NGCs are both below 1.0% as presented in Fig. 4d. Whereas, PLQY of 1.5Yb3+-0.2Er3+ codoped 70Si-NGC exceeds 1.0% when the power density of the exciting laser is higher than 4.8 W cm−2. When the power density is increased to 8.1 W cm−2, the optimal PLQY value is as high as 2.77%. Since β-NaYF4 and KYb2F7 NGCs were considered as the most efficient and well-established NGCs for UC luminescence in the past investigations,30 the more efficient emission in 70Si-NGC indicates that the UC luminescence efficiency of NGC material has been pushed forward by a big step.
Interestingly, this in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy is also suitable for the incorporation of RE into fluoride nanocrystals to enhance DS luminescence. As a proof of concept, NIR luminescent properties of Er3+ doped NGCs are studied here. Owing to the precipitation of KEr3F10 (Fig. S8b, ESI†), Er3+ ions are incorporated into the fluoride crystal environments, the DS emission intensity excited by 980 nm laser diode and emission lifetime at 1535 nm of the NGC samples is dramatically enhanced in comparison with those of the PG sample (Fig. 4e and f). The success in the demonstration of enhancement for DS photoluminescence offers significant opportunities for the design and fabrication of optical gain NGCs to achieve highly efficient near-infrared and mid-infrared luminescence, via the facile in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy.
More importantly, this in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy can be extended to all RE ions, either for single doping or for co-doping (Fig. S8a and b, ESI†). Although the precipitation of the RE-fluoride nanocrystals phase is quite sensitive to the RE ions radius, all the RE-fluoride nanocrystals embedded inside the NGCs can absolutely enhance both UC and DS luminescence, in comparison with their PG counterparts (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). All in all, the in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy provides significant opportunities for exploiting highly-efficient NGCs used as UC and DS optical gain materials for the potential opto-electronic applications covering a broad spectrum range of visible to the infrared window, in particular of lasers.
As proved above, the RE ions doped 70Si-NGC possesses high-efficiency luminescence, thermally-stable luminescence and high transmittance, which are beneficial for achieving highly efficient lasers. The lasing properties of Er3+ doped 70Si-NGCs were also investigated by using microspheres as resonant cavities. The schematic diagram of microsphere lasers is presented in Fig. 5a. A tapered fiber drawn from a single-mode silica fiber was applied to evanescently couple the pumped light into microsphere whispering modes and collect the lasing emission from the microspheres. By heat treatment of PG microspheres, fluoride crystals were precipitated in situ in NGC microspheres and RE ions were incorporated into the fluoride crystal environment (inset in Fig. 5a). The surfaces of PG and NGC microspheres are smooth due to the controllable nano-crystallization process as presented in the microphotograph shown in Fig. 5b and c. The microspheres were carefully moved close to the tapered fiber to make sure that the tapered fiber was in touch with the equatorial ring of the microspheres. The pump laser was successfully coupled into the microsphere and intense UC emission around the equatorial ring was observable by eyes, as shown in Fig. 5d.

(h) Input–output power plots of the lasing emission of the PG and NGC microspheres. 
As shown in Fig. 5e, when pumped by a 980 nm laser with a power of 43.0 mW, WGM laser output can be clearly observed in Er3+-activated PG and NGC microspheres (with the diameter of about 46.1 μm). The output power of the laser in the PG microsphere is 4.2 nW, while the laser output power in NGC microspheres was enhanced by 19 and 28 times when the microspheres were heat-treated at 520 °C for 5 and 10 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5f, single-mode laser peaks around 1533 nm were observed in the output spectra of NGC microspheres and the output power increases from 2.4 to 99 nW, when the pumping power is increased from 29.8 to 30.2 mW. For PG microspheres, single-mode laser peaks around 1535 nm are observed when the pumping power is increased from 43 to 46 mW (Fig. S11, ESI†).
Generally, whispering gallery mode (WGM) laser output from microspheres when the pump power exceeds the thresholds.49–51 The dependence of the output intensity and line width of the NGC microsphere as a function of the pumping density are shown in Fig. 4g. This is used to determine the lasing threshold of microspheres, which is determined by the intersecting point of the linear fitting at lower pumping power and superlinear fitting at higher pumping power, leaving a lasing threshold of 29.9 mW. The output power exhibits an obvious increase and the linewidth of the emission spectrum is sharply narrow if the pump power exceeds the thresholds. The lasing threshold and power-power conversion efficiency (η) of the microspheres are determined by plotting the laser output power as a function of the pumping power (Fig. 5h). The result from these plots reveals that η values sharply increased when the pumping power exceeded the threshold values in three microspheres. The pumping threshold of laser reduces dramatically from 42.1 to 37.0 and 29.9 mW when the microsphere was heat-treated at 520 °C for 5 h and 10 h, respectively. While the η value for NGC microsphere lasers enhances 2.9 and 50.1 times compared to the PG microsphere one after the heat treatments for 5 and 10 h, respectively. The lower pumping threshold and higher power–power conversion efficiency of the laser in NGC microspheres are ascribed to the controllable incorporation of RE ions into fluoride nanocrystals in NGC materials via the novel nano-crystallization strategy proposed by us. These results directly prove that our well-designed NGC is a significant material for achieving highly efficient lasing devices.
3. Conclusion
In summary, a novel oxy-fluoride lasing NGC was fabricated via an in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy. The strategy is suitable for designing all RE ions doped NGCs and various RE-fluoride nanocrystals are controllably precipitated in NGCs. In NGCs, RE ions are spontaneously incorporated into RE-fluoride nanocrystal structures via ionic diffusion and rearrangements during the heat treatments. As a result, both UC and DS emission intensities of the RE ions doped NGCs can be dramatically enhanced, as compared to those of the corresponding PGs. Interestingly, UC PLQY of the Yb3+–Er3+ codoped NGC (2.77%) is much higher than that of the well-established β-NaYF4 NGCs (0.78%) and the traditional KYb2F7 NGCs (0.42%). Moreover, the designed NGCs possess higher transmittance and more superior photo-thermal stability. Most significantly, more efficient lasers of Er3+ have been observed in the NGC microspheres in comparison with that in the PG counterpart. This further proves that the well-designed NGC is an appealing material for highly efficient optical gain. The dopant-induced crystallization strategy has overcome the barrier of the ionic substitution process caused by the mismatch of ionic radius in the traditional NGCs and pushed the luminescence efficiency of optical gain materials by a big step. Therefore, the more effective luminescence, higher transmittance, more superior photo-thermal-stability of the designed NGCs make them significantly optical gain materials for a broad photonic application, such as lasers, lighting, solar cells, and 3D information storages. The in situ dopant-induced nano-crystallization strategy opens a broad avenue for engineering a wide range of functional materials for emerging photonic applications.
