    , Accepted 6th January 2014First published on 7th January 2014AbstractWe fabricated the first solid state modules based on organometal halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3−xClx using Spiro-OMeTAD and poly(3-hexylthiophene) as hole transport materials. Device up-scaling was performed using innovative procedures to realize large-area cells and the integrated series-interconnections. The perovskite-based modules show a maximum conversion efficiency of 5.1% using both poly(3-hexylthiophene) and Spiro-OMeTAD. A long-term stability test was performed (in air, under AM1.5G, 1 Sun illumination conditions) using both materials showing different behaviour under continuous light stress. Whilst the poly(3-hexylthiophene)-based module efficiency drops by about 80% with respect to the initial value after 170 hours, the Spiro-based module shows a promising long-term stability maintaining more than 60% of its initial efficiency after 335 hours.
Dye solar cells (DSCs) are a suitable technology to realize large-area devices by using low cost processes and materials.1–4 These kinds of solar cells have already shown outstanding features including easy up-scaling, solution processing and applicability to flexible substrates.5,6 Alternative architectures called solid state DSCs (SDSCs) are investigated in order to resolve problems due to insufficient electrochemical stability of the liquid electrolyte under reverse bias conditions and thermal stress.7 The liquid electrolyte can be replaced with a hole transport material (HTM) for the dye regeneration process.8 Although small-area devices have been widely studied,8–11 there are very few reports showing the up-scaling of these devices. Recently, we have reported the first attempt to fabricate a SDSC module using an organic dye (called D35) as a light harvester and the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) polymer as HTM. A 2% PCE value was obtained for the series-connected SDSC module with an active area of 13.44 cm2.12
A new promising class of light harvesting materials, namely the hybrid organic halide based perovskites, have been recently employed to realize high efficiency photovoltaic solar cells.13 This kind of crystalline material shows good properties in terms of light harvesting (high absorption in a broad region of the visible spectrum) and electron and hole mobilities.14–24 A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15% was reported using CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized TiO2 together with the Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM for small-area devices.21 Alternative HTMs have also been studied to replace the Spiro-OMeTAD in order to reduce the fabrication cost of scaled-up devices.20,27 Perovskite solar cells made with polymeric HTMs such as poly-triarylamine (PTAA) and P3HT have shown a PCE of 12% and 6.7%, respectively.15 Recently, we have reported the use of a regio-regular, doped, and high molecular weight P3HT in combination with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx showing a PCE of 9.3% for small-area devices (0.1 cm2).23 However, scaling up to the module size is still an open issue for perovskite solar cell technology and reports on the feasibility of large-area devices are still missing. In this paper, the first perovskite-based monolithic series-type module was realised showing very promising results in terms of the power conversion efficiency, the reproducibility of the fabrication process and long-term stability. To achieve these results, important innovative procedures were implemented in order to realize an efficient up-scaling process including a customised formulation of TiO2 paste to realize a uniform thin titania scaffold by the Screen Printing technique; an appropriate cleaning procedure of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx in the interconnection area between single cells to realize a patterned perovskite deposition; and a c-TiO2 patterned deposition adapting and optimizing the one already reported in our previous work.12 Furthermore, two different HTMs were used, i.e. the Spiro-OMeTAD and the P3HT polymer both reaching a PCE equal to 5.1%. The P3HT was utilized as a cost-effective alternative material and also to test the reproducibility of the fabrication process.
The picture of a perovskite-based module is shown in Fig. 1a. Five single cells (active area of 3.36 cm2) are connected by using a monolithic scheme for series-interconnection with an overall active area of 16.8 cm2 and an aperture area of 25 cm2, as shown in Fig. 1b. The layout of the module allows the measurement of each cell individually. In fact, the gold cathode (i.e. the back contact) can be easily accessed when the module is not encapsulated. By masking all the cells except for the one under test and taking the current between the photo-anode and gold cathode of each cell, it was possible to extract the I–V characteristics of each large-area cell forming the module. Whereas the stability of un-encapsulated devices was sufficient to carry out single measurements, long-term degradation studies were carried out after encapsulating the module.
 Fig. 1  (a) Image of the monolithic perovskite-based module. (b) The monolithic interconnection scheme of the perovskite-based module. In particular, the length of the active area is equal to 48 mm, the width of each cell is 7 mm, the width of the etched FTO area is equal to 1 mm and the width of the contact area between the cells (where no c-TiO2 layer was deposited) is equal to 2.5 mm. 
SEM micrographs presented in Fig. 2a and b show the cross-section of the monolithic structure at different magnifications. The images confirm the expected thicknesses of the constituent layers: compact TiO2 = 110 nm, the TiO2 scaffold = 700 nm and the P3HT layer = 150 nm. As already shown by M. M. Lee et al.,13 CH3NH3PbI3−xClx in Fig. 2 produces a rough discontinuous capping layer over the TiO2 scaffold. Moreover, strong adhesion of the compact TiO2 layer (highlighted in Fig. 2b with green colour) over the FTO surface was obtained as reported in our previous work.11Fig. 2c and d show the difference between the morphology of the titania scaffold before (Fig. 2c) and after (Fig. 2d) the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite deposition. The presence of a continuous network of large CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite aggregating with a size of up to one hundred nanometers can be identified with crystals interpenetrating into the titania scaffold (which in turn is composed of distinguishable nanoparticles with a size of around 20 nm).

(b) Cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the perovskite based solar module with higher magnification. Each layer is coloured (FTO substrate, blue; compact TiO2 underlayer, green; perovskite–TiO2, yellow; P3HT polymer, red) and labeled to underline the architecture of the device. (c) Cross-sectional FE-SEM image of a sintered mesoporous TiO2 made with diluted screenprinted paste (18-NRT, Dyesol). (d) Cross-sectional FE-SEM image of a sintered mesoporous TiO2 made with diluted screenprinted paste (18-NRT, Dyesol) covered with a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer obtained by spin coating and annealing. The morphology is clearly different from the uncovered TiO2 of image (c), with emerging perovskite crystal. 
The main photovoltaic parameters of the large-area cells with the doped P3HT HTM are listed in Table 1. The results show average values of: VOC = 913 ± 40 mV, JSC = 10.6 ± 1.6 mA cm−2, FF = 51.2 ± 6.7% and finally a PCE = 5.0 ± 1.1%. Averages are calculated on the five large-area cells forming the module. The best cell shows a PCE equal to 6.3%. Interestingly, the VOC is very similar for each cell, whilst a ±15% relative variation in FF and JSC was measured between the constituent cells. This effect is probably due to the non-uniformity of HTM capping layers using the spin coating deposition technique. This aspect was confirmed by SEM characterization (Fig. 2a). In fact, photovoltaic parameters such as FF and JSC can be affected by the recombination processes occurring at the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/P3HT interface due to different thicknesses and quality of the P3HT capping layers deposited over the rough perovskite–TiO2 layer.20,23 This issue causes slight JSC mismatches between the constituent cells of the module limiting the module current to the lower one, as expected for the series-type configuration. Furthermore, a single perovskite-based solar cell using the Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM was fabricated. The best large-area cell using the Spiro-OMeTAD shows VOC = 896 mV, JSC = 10.1 mA cm−2, FF = 65.1% and PCE = 5.9%. Recombination in P3HT is faster compared to Spiro-based samples24 as can be observed from a smaller shunt resistance and fill factor of the P3HT cell with respect to the Spiro-OMeTAD one (FF = 51.2%, 210 Ω and FF = 65.1%, 1090 Ω, respectively). Fig. 3 presents the I–V characteristics of the perovskite-based solar modules together with the I–V of the best cells using both HTMs. Comparing the I–V measurements of the best solar cell and the module for both HTMs, we can affirm that the module layout was correctly designed since the ISC of the best cells is only slightly higher compared to the current of the modules with both HTM devices (+3% for Spiro-based and +11% for P3HT based, respectively). This proves that, notwithstanding the difficulty of obtaining a uniform deposition of the HTM on the large underlying patterned and rough surfaces using the spin coating technique, the fabricated modules have sufficient uniformity between the cells yielding a module ISC which is very close to the one of the best single cell.
Table 1 Main photovoltaic parameters measured on a large-area single cell using P3HT as HTM are reported. The device structure is FTO/c-TiO2/nc-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/P3HT/Au. Averages are calculated on the five large-area cells (active area of 3.36 cm2) forming the module

 Fig. 3  (a) I–V characteristics of series-connected large-area P3HT-based devices and best cells are reported. (b) I–V characteristics of series-connected large-area Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices and best cells. I–V characteristics are measured under standard illumination conditions AM1.5G (1000 W cm−2) under the class B Sun Simulator (solar constant 1200 KHS). 

Table 2 reports the main photovoltaic parameters of P3HT and the Spiro-OMeTAD. The module with the P3HT HTM shows VOC = 4.5 V, ISC = −36.8 mA, FF = 52.6% and PCE = 5.1% on the active area. The I–V characteristics of the P3HT-based module measured under different illumination conditions are shown in Fig. 4. The module under 0.3 Sun shows a higher PCE (6.7%) than the same device under 1 Sun, (ΔPCE/PCE = +30.0%). This behaviour could be mainly ascribed to a reduction of the influence of the series resistance, confirmed by a similar increase of FF (ΔFF/FF = +32.8%) when the device is illuminated under low light intensity.

A successive batch, composed of four modules, was fabricated in order to evaluate the reproducibility of the fabrication process utilizing doped P3HT as HTM. The results are summarized in Table 3. In particular, the average photovoltaic parameters, calculated on four samples, are VOC = 4.3 ± 0.4 V, ISC = 25.5 ± 5.6 mA, FF = 57.0 ± 7.9% and PCE = 3.7 ± 0.6%. These results assess the good reproducibility of the fabrication process. As previously reported, the relatively large standard deviation for the short-circuit current and fill factor can be ascribed to a non-uniformity in the large-area deposition of the P3HT capping layer due to the high surface roughness of the underlying perovskite layer.23 This problem could be solved by obtaining a smoother deposition of the perovskite layer by varying the deposition technique, as recently demonstrated.28 Afterwards, in order to evaluate the whole up-scaling process, we plot in Fig. 5 the PCE values for different device sizes obtained maintaining the same experimental conditions for each device size. The results show that the PCE drops by about 30% migrating from the 0.1 cm2 cell to the about 40 times larger one (3.36 cm2) for both HTMs. This drop could be due to different factors including the resistivity of the FTO electrode and the non-uniform perovskite deposition on the large-area substrates using the spin coating technique. Upon scaling from the large-area cell to the module, the PCE drops by about 14% for Spiro-based devices and 19% for P3HT-based devices. As previously reported, these slight decreases are due to the mismatch of ISC between the constituent cells forming the series-connected module. These results represent a significant starting point for future development of the perovskite-based modules.

 Fig. 5  Evolution of the PCE obtained during the up-scaling process using both HTMs: Spiro-OMeTAD (cyan colour) and P3HT (green colour) scaling the size of the active area (the small-area cell (0.1 cm2), the large-area cell (3.36 cm2) and the series-interconnected module (16.8 cm2)). The up-scaling process was carried out maintaining the same perovskite deposition procedure. 
Subsequently, a light soaking ageing test for 335 hours was performed to evaluate the long-term stability of the perovskite-based module using both HTMs under AM1.5 illumination conditions (1 Sun at 40 °C illuminated by class A Light Soaker in air) as shown in Fig. 6a and b. To evaluate lifetime, the sealing procedure was performed in a glove box environment as described in the experimental section to reduce the impact of moisture on the perovskite material. In parallel, the optical long-term stability of the perovskite was also tested by monitoring the absorbance spectra during the stability test for sealed and un-sealed FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx samples (as already reported by M. M. Lee et al.13). Interestingly, very little variation in the absorbance spectra was measured when the samples were sealed (≤4% at 500 nm). These results and procedures are reported in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 6a, a P3HT-based solar module shows insufficient long-term stability. In fact, the PCE drops drastically after about 170 hours (ΔPCE/PCE = −80% with respect to the initial value) due to a huge decrease of VOC (ΔVOC/VOC = −60%) and ISC (ΔISC/ISC = −65%). This issue is due to the photo-chemical degradation of the P3HT polymer when exposed to the light soaking test at 1 Sun (called “Burn in” effect), as reported in the literature.29–31

The encapsulated modules are maintained under VOC conditions during the light soaking test. (a) Long-term stability of the P3HT-based module after 170 hours. (b) Long-term stability of the Spiro-based module after 335 hours. 
The long-term stability of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based module is shown in Fig. 6b. The results show a significant decrease of conversion efficiency after about 72 hours due to a drop in the VOC of the module. As recently reported by Leijtens et al.,33 this effect could also be ascribed to a partial de-doping of the Spiro-OMeTAD that induces a change in its oxidation state in the first part of the light soaking test carried out under VOC conditions.32,33 From 72 hours to 330 hours, the PCE value remained stable. This characterization represents the first attempt to evaluate the long-term stability of the large-area device under standard illumination conditions using a class A Light Soaker at 1 Sun at 40 °C in air. These promising results open up a path for future further systematic studies on the effect of different sealing materials and procedures on lifetime.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this work was devoted to the definition of an efficient and reproducible up-scaling process of hybrid organic halide perovskite-based devices reaching a PCE of 5.1% on the large-area series-interconnected monolithic modules. Thus, to accomplish the purpose of achieving an efficient perovskite module, important innovative procedures were studied and optimized. Here we mention the key ones: the patterned deposition procedure for the TiO2 underlayer, the optimization of the monolithic interconnection between constituent cells, the uniform deposition of the thin titania scaffold by screen-printing and finally the large-area CH3NH3PbI3−xClx deposition by spin coating. Here, these fabrication processes were used for the first time to define a reproducible fabrication procedure applicable to large areas. A promising long-term stability was reached using the Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM under AM1.5 illumination at 1 Sun maintaining more than 60% of its initial PCE after 335 hours. To achieve better performance in terms of PCE and long-term stability, future developments will concentrate on the study of efficient sealants, the optimisation of the perovskite deposition and the cleaning procedure of the interconnection area between neighbouring cells.
Experimental section
FTO–glass substrates (Pilkington, 8 Ω per □, 57 mm × 57 mm) were etched using a raster scanning laser (Nd:YVO4 pulsed at 30 kHz average output power P = 10 W) to form the desired electrode patterns consisting of five FTO strips (10 mm × 57 mm) each separated by 1 mm wide etched areas. FTO patterned substrates were cleaned with detergent, de-ionized water and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. By using the spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) technique as reported,11 a compact c-TiO2 (120 nm) film was deposited onto the FTO surface (heated at 450 °C) after screen-printing of a metallic mask in order to obtain patterned c-TiO2 deposition. Then, the metallic mask was removed by immersing the substrate in an acid solution of TiCl4 and de-ionized water for 5 minutes at a later stage. A nanocrystalline (nc) mesoporous TiO2 layer (18NR-T paste, Dyesol, diluted with terpineol, ethylcellulose, isopropanol and ethanol) was screen-printed onto the c-TiO2 film and successively sintered at 480 °C for 30 minutes. The final thickness of the nc-TiO2 film measured using a profilometer (Dektak Veeco 150) was 700 nm.
A perovskite solution (composed of methylammonium iodide CH3NH3I and lead chloride PbCl2 in N,N-dimethylformamide, molar ratio 3:1) was spin-coated (2000 rpm for 40 s) over the nc-TiO2 film in air and successively heated at 120 °C for 45 minutes obtaining the final crystalline structure.
Afterwards, a doped P3HT solution (Merck, 15 mg ml−1, MW 94100 with LiN(CF3SO2)2N and 4-tert-butylpyridine in chlorobenzene additivies at concentrations according to previous work25,26) was in turn spin coated (30 s waiting time after the deposition onto the substrate, 600 rpm for 12 s and finally at 1500 rpm for 40 s) over the crystalline perovskite layer (capping layer thickness 150 nm). Both perovskite and P3HT layers were successively cleaned from the interconnection area between cells by using a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide and chlorobenzene (1:10 v/v). Subsequently, samples were introduced into a high vacuum chamber (10−6 mbar) to evaporate the Au layer used as the back electrode (thickness 150 nm) and to interconnect cells in the series configuration. The deposition mask for Au was fabricated by cutting (via a CO2 Universal Laser System) a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet. The module was tested in an air atmosphere without encapsulation under a class B Sun Simulator (Solar Constant 1200 KHS) at AM1.5, 1000 W m−2 calibrated using a Skye SKS 1110 sensor. The Sun Simulator is class B in the visible and near-infrared range (class B between 700 and 800 nm and class A in the rest of the 400–1100 nm range) and has a spatial uniformity <5% (3.5% in the 15 × 15 cm region of measurement). The single constituent cell was measured with a slit slightly bigger with respect to the active area (3.92 cm2). The thicknesses and morphologies of the constituent layers were evaluated from Cross-sectional Scanning Electron Microscopy micrographs (FE-SEM Leo Supra 35). The class A light soaker (Solaronix, model. SOLARTEST 65-STF65) was used to test the long-term stability under standard illumination conditions (AM1.5, 1000 W m−2) in air using a UV filter (150 μm thick PEN foil). The temperature was fixed at 40 °C by a chiller. To test the long-term stability of the perovskite-based module some changes have been made to the layout to allow an encapsulation of the devices. The module layout was slightly modified in order to permit the sealing procedure. Four single cells (active area of 2.88 cm2) were connected by using a monolithic scheme for series-interconnection with an overall active area of 11.52 cm2 keeping the same cell width, interconnection distance and thus the same aperture ratio of the unsealed device. The interconnection area between cells and the width of the cell were left unchanged. Thus, the device was sealed with a thermoplastic sealant deposited over the whole scaffold area at 90 °C and with a secondary sealing on the edge of the protective glass using a cyanoacrylate glue.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Image of the monolithic perovskite-based module. (b) The monolithic interconnection scheme of the perovskite-based module. In particular, the length of the active area is equal to 48 mm, the width of each cell is 7 mm, the width of the etched FTO area is equal to 1 mm and the width of the contact area between the cells (where no c-TiO2 layer was deposited) is equal to 2.5 mm.	 

 	Fig. 2  Cross-sectional FE-SEM images of a perovskite based solar module without the gold electrode. (a) Cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the perovskite based solar module with lower magnification. (b) Cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the perovskite based solar module with higher magnification. Each layer is coloured (FTO substrate, blue; compact TiO2 underlayer, green; perovskite–TiO2, yellow; P3HT polymer, red) and labeled to underline the architecture of the device. (c) Cross-sectional FE-SEM image of a sintered mesoporous TiO2 made with diluted screenprinted paste (18-NRT, Dyesol). (d) Cross-sectional FE-SEM image of a sintered mesoporous TiO2 made with diluted screenprinted paste (18-NRT, Dyesol) covered with a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer obtained by spin coating and annealing. The morphology is clearly different from the uncovered TiO2 of image (c), with emerging perovskite crystal.

 	Fig. 5  Evolution of the PCE obtained during the up-scaling process using both HTMs: Spiro-OMeTAD (cyan colour) and P3HT (green colour) scaling the size of the active area (the small-area cell (0.1 cm2), the large-area cell (3.36 cm2) and the series-interconnected module (16.8 cm2)). The up-scaling process was carried out maintaining the same perovskite deposition procedure.	 

 	Fig. 6  Evolution of normalized photovoltaic parameters (PCE, red squares; VOC, cyan circles; ISC, blue triangles; FF, green stars) using different HTMs under AM1.5G illumination conditions with a class A light soaker (Solaronix, SOLARTEST 65-STF65) at 1000 W m−2 and 40 °C in air. The encapsulated modules are maintained under VOC conditions during the light soaking test. (a) Long-term stability of the P3HT-based module after 170 hours. (b) Long-term stability of the Spiro-based module after 335 hours.
