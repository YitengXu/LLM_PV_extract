    , Accepted 13th October 2021First published on 14th October 2021AbstractHybrid redox flow batteries (RFBs) offer a much higher energy density compared to all-liquid RFBs. However, the negative electrodes of hybrid RFBs normally utilize metal deposition reactions (e.g., zinc metal), which suffer from severe dendrite growth and poor long-term stability, especially at high areal capacities and high current densities. Herein, we propose and demonstrate the use of high-loading solid conversion electrodes to replace metal deposition electrodes to achieve high cycling stability at high areal capacities/current densities in hybrid RFBs. Using a Fe3O4/Fe(OH)2 conversion negative electrode as an example coupled with a Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− posolyte, we demonstrated conversion type all-iron hybrid RFBs with an unprecedentedly high cycling areal capacity of 126.6 mA h cm−2 at 50 mA cm−2 for 200 cycles (1000 hours) and 215 mA h cm−2 at 60 mA cm−2 for 100 cycles (700 hours) without capacity decay. The solid conversion electrode eliminates dendrite issues and the limitations of metal areal capacity, and demonstrates superior areal capacity, current density, and cycling stability compared to conventional zinc metal negative electrodes. This approach offers a new direction for developing high-energy, low-cost, and long-lasting hybrid RFBs for large-scale grid energy storage applications.

Broader context
Hybrid redox flow batteries (RFBs) such as Zn-based RFBs offer a much higher energy density compared to all-liquid RFBs. However, they rely on metal dissolution/deposition electrodes, which suffer from severe dendrite issues and poor reversibility, especially at high areal capacities and high current densities. These inherent challenges of metal electrodes preclude their practical deployment for large-scale and long-duration energy storage applications. To break away from this intrinsic limitation, here, we propose and demonstrate the use of high-loading solid conversion electrodes (Fe3O4/Fe(OH)2) to replace metal deposition electrodes to achieve high cycling stability at unprecedentedly high areal capacities/current densities for hybrid RFBs. This work offers a new direction to address the long-unresolved metal dendrite/low areal capacity bottleneck of hybrid RFBs for large-scale and long-duration energy storage applications.

The widespread application of solar and wind power is hindered by their intermittent nature. Electrochemical energy storage systems bridge the gap between intermittent renewable power sources (e.g., solar and wind power) and user demands.1 The redox flow battery (RFB) is one of the most promising technologies for energy storage owing to its advantages of high safety, high efficiency, and low cost. However, conventional all-liquid RFBs suffer from low energy density, which significantly impedes their practical deployment in commercial buildings and industries. The active materials of conventional all-liquid RFBs are soluble in electrolytes such as vanadium,2 halides,3 polysulfides,4,5 and organic molecules,6 whose energy density is mainly limited by their low solubility (typically 0.5 to 3 M).7,8
Recently, tremendous efforts have been devoted to incorporating solid materials into flow batteries to boost energy density,9,10i.e. hybrid RFBs, owing to their unique advantages of high bulk densities and the wide range of material to select from.7,11 The negative electrodes of hybrid RFBs based on metal dissolution/deposition reactions (deposition type hybrid RFBs) including zinc,12–17 tin18,19 and iron20 have attracted great attention owing to their intrinsically high energy density. However, the deposition type negative electrodes of hybrid RFBs suffer from severe dendrite growth and poor reversibility especially at high areal capacities and high current densities.14 Therefore, hybrid RFBs are often operated at a low areal capacity (normally less than 50 mA h cm−2) or a low current density (normally less than 50 mA cm−2),21 which limits the total capacity of the hybrid RFBs and is insufficient to meet practical application requirements.11,22 Developing negative electrodes for hybrid RFBs with a high areal capacity and high current density without dendrite formation is critical for the achievement of high-energy and long-lasting RFB systems.
Here, we proposed and demonstrated the use of high-loading solid conversion electrodes to replace metal deposition electrodes to achieve a high cycling stability at a high areal capacity/current density in hybrid RFBs. A schematic comparison between the solid conversion type hybrid RFBs and the deposition type hybrid RFBs is shown in Fig. 1. For conventional metal solid electrodes, dendrite growth and poor reversibility result from repetitive metal deposition/dissolution (solid–liquid reaction) and a non-uniform local current distribution, which makes it difficult to achieve a high areal capacity and current density.23 In contrast, the proposed solid conversion type electrode materials that are homogeneously distributed in the three-dimensional conductive matrix (e.g., carbon felt or nickel foam) proceed via a solid–solid conversion between different redox states. The areal capacity and current density of conversion type solid electrodes can be tuned via electrode loading without dendrite limitations. To demonstrate this concept, we employed a ferrous ferric oxide (Fe3O4)/ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) conversion negative electrode as an example and coupled it with a widely used liquid posolyte ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63−) and ferrocyanide (Fe(CN)64−),24 and formed an alkaline conversion type all-iron hybrid RFB. This conversion type all-iron hybrid RFB demonstrated an ultrahigh areal capacity of 126.6 mA h cm−2 at 50 mA cm−2 for 200 cycles (1000 hours) and 215 mA h cm−2 at 60 mA cm−2 for 100 cycles (700 hours) without capacity decay, and highlights the promising direction of using conversion type solid electrodes for high-energy, low-cost, and long-lasting hybrid RFBs.

Results and discussion
The negative electrode reaction, positive electrode reaction, and overall reaction of the alkaline all-iron conversion type hybrid RFB are:
Negative electrode reaction: Fe3O4·4H2O + 2e−  3Fe(OH)2 + 2OH−(1)Positive electrode reaction: Fe(CN)63− + e−  Fe(CN)64−(2)Overall reaction: Fe3O4·4H2O + 2Fe(CN)64−  3Fe(OH)2 + 2Fe(CN)63− + 2OH−(3)
The electrochemical behaviors of the positive electrode and negative electrode redox pairs were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Fig. 2a. For the positive electrode, the CV was conducted with a carbon felt working electrode at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in an electrolyte of 10 mM potassium ferricyanide in 1 M KOH. The Fe3O4 negative electrode was obtained by a formation process starting from an Fe powder (Experimental procedures and Fig. S1, ESI†) and was used as the working electrode in the CV measurements in a 3 M KOH 1 M LiOH electrolyte. Fig. 2a shows the CV curves of Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64−and Fe3O4/Fe(OH)2 that are centered at 0.36 V vs. Hg/HgO (0.458 V vs. SHE) and −0.80 V vs. Hg/HgO (−0.702 V vs. SHE), respectively. The redox potential of Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− is higher than its thermodynamic standard redox potential (0.358 V vs. SHE), which can be attributed to the ionic strength effect25,26 that is also observed in other ferricyanide based flow batteries.27,28 An all-iron conversion type hybrid RFB with a full cell voltage of 1.16 V is achieved by combining the Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− posolyte and the Fe3O4/Fe(OH)2 negative electrode.

A conversion type all-iron hybrid RFB with three-dimensional iron electrode and potassium ferrocyanide cell (Fig. S2, ESI†) was assembled to further study the electrochemical performance of the proposed RFB. Fig. 2b shows a representative galvanostatic voltage profile of the conversion type all-iron hybrid RFB under the current density of 11.12 mA cm−2 (300 mA g−1 (per gram of Fe)) with the capacity at 11.12 mA h cm−2 (300 mA h g−1, 94% of the theoretical capacity of 319 mA h g−1). The cell achieved a coulombic efficiency of 99.83% and an energy efficiency of 80.49%. The capacity limit is set to avoid metallic Fe formation and hydrogen evolution side reaction.29 The 0.17% loss in coulombic efficiency could be attributed to the hydrogen evolution reaction from the negative electrode, the oxygen evolution reaction from the positive electrode,30 and/or the loss of active materials during dynamic electrolyte flow.
To examine the reaction mechanism of the solid conversion type negative electrode, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) on the three-dimensional iron electrodes at different charge/discharge stages, as shown in Fig. 3a. After the formation process and before the charging process (stage I), Fe3O4 (JCPDS No. 79-0416) is the major phase of the negative electrode. Upon charging to stage II (150 mA h g−1), diffraction peaks at 37.39°, 51.22°, 56.44° and 60.24° emerged, which could be indexed to the planes of (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0) and (0 0 3) of the Fe(OH)2 phase (JCPDS No. 13-0089), respectively. This shows that Fe3O4 was converted to the Fe(OH)2 phase during charging. On further charging to stage III (300 mA h g−1), the Fe(OH)2 phase became more prominent. Some Fe3O4 phase can still be observed at stage III since 300 mA h g−1 is less than the theoretical capacity (319 mA h g−1). During discharge, the Fe(OH)2 phase gradually disappeared until stage V, which shows that Fe(OH)2 was converted back to Fe3O4 during discharge. The XRD results confirmed that the negative electrode follows the designated reaction indicated in eqn (1).

A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine the morphology of the conversion iron negative electrode during the different charge/discharge stages (Fig. 3b–f and Fig. S3, ESI†). At stage I (Fig. 3b), the Fe3O4 bulk particles were embedded in the three-dimensional conducting carbon fiber matrix (carbon felts). The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping results (Fig. S4, ESI†) indicate that Fe, and O are uniformly distributed in the electrode. The negative electrode bulk particles were uniformly embedded in the carbon fiber matrix at all stages. No major morphological changes were observed during the charge/discharge of the Fe3O4 conversion electrodes, which is in strong contrast to metal deposition type electrodes that show growth of dendrites.23,31–33
To verify the practicability of this solid conversion type hybrid RFB, a long-term galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling test of the full flow cell was conducted using a three-dimensional iron electrode. Fig. 4a shows the galvanostatic voltage profiles of the flow cell at the 1st, 300th and 600th cycles at 80 mA cm−2 at 60 mL min−1. The achieved areal/gravimetric capacity at the 1st, 300th and 600th cycles was 24.9 (298.8), 24.8 (297.6) and 24.4 (292.8) mA h cm−2 (mA h g−1), respectively. During this 600 cycle long-term cycling test (375 hours), the gravimetric capacity and areal capacity showed a 2% decay after 600 cycles, which translates to a low-capacity decay rate of 0.0033% per cycle. This demonstrates the long-term stability of the conversion type solid electrode for hybrid RFBs. The reaction stability was further verified using XRD/SEM to compare the electrode composition/morphology before and after the long-term cycling. As shown in Fig. 4b, the XRD results show Fe3O4 (JCPDS No. 79-0416) remained as the major electrode phase before and after the long-term cycling as shown in Fig. 4a. As shown in Fig. 3g, the SEM results show no major morphological changes to the negative electrode after the long-term cycling, and show bulk particles uniformly embedded in the carbon fiber matrix. The EDX mapping analysis (Fig. S5, ESI†) shows that the element Fe, and O are uniformly distributed in the bulk particles. We analyzed the concentration of the ferrocyanide electrolyte in a flow cell before and after 100 cycles via UV-vis spectroscopy. The UV-vis spectroscopy result (Fig. S6, ESI†) reveals that no noticeable changes in ferrocyanide electrolyte concentration can be found after cycling, which is consistent with a previous report that revealed that ferrocyanide is relatively stable in alkaline media.30 The potential degradation mechanism of the iron electrode includes parasitic side reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction), and the loss of active materials during dynamic electrolyte flow, which can be improved by using electrolyte additives to suppress hydrogen evolution34 and an appropriate electrode structure design and binder selection to increase the mechanical strength of the electrode,35,36 respectively. The long-term flow cell cycling stability coupled with the compositional/morphological stability revealed by the XRD/SEM results support the practicability of the conversion type all-iron hybrid RFB.

To further demonstrate the unique advantages of the solid conversion type negative electrode such as high stability under high areal capacity, we prepared a three-dimensional conversion type iron negative electrode with a high areal capacity at 126.6 mA h cm−2 and performed flow cell measurements at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. The galvanostatic voltage profiles of the high-loading conversion all-iron hybrid RFB are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). A high gravimetric capacity was achieved at the 1st (297.07 mA h g−1), 100th (298.26 mA h g−1), and 200th (284.99 mA h g−1) cycles even at an ultrahigh loading of 422.12 mg cm−2. The corresponding areal capacity at the 1st, 100th, and 200th cycles was 125.4, 125.9 and 120.3 mA h cm−2, respectively. Significantly, the high loading conversion type negative electrode stably operated for more than 200 cycles (1000 hours) at a high areal capacity (Fig. 5a). We compared the cycling stability of the solid conversion type negative electrode with the Zn metal negative electrode under parallel conditions (same current density and same areal capacity). As shown in Fig. S8a and b (ESI†), the deposition type zinc flow batteries only cycled for 22 cycles with severe capacity fading due to the formation of dendrites, which is confirmed by the SEM image shown in Fig. S8c and d (ESI†). Furthermore, a conversion all-iron hybrid RFB with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 215 mA h cm−2 cycled at a current density of 60 mA cm−2 was demonstrated by increasing the thickness of the three-dimensional conversion type iron negative electrode (3 mm to 6 mm, after compression), as shown in Fig. 5b, this hybrid RFB with an ultrahigh areal capacity stably operated for more than 100 cycles and 700 hours. We note that the gravimetric utilization of the iron electrodes does not decrease significantly even at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 215 mA h cm−2. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the gravimetric capacity of the iron electrodes at 40.3, 126.6 and 215 mA h cm−2 was 298.67, 297.1, and 267.8 mA h g−1 respectively.

To further improve the practicability of the solid conversion type hybrid RFBs, we demonstrated two directions for future development. First, the commercial Nafion membrane has a high areal resistance in alkaline or neutral conditions,37 which is responsible for most of the voltage polarization observed in the all-iron hybrid RFB (Fig. S10, ESI†). In addition, the cost of Nafion membranes is very high (more than US$500 per m2).38 Therefore, it is necessary to replace Nafion with other low-cost and effective ion selective membranes. It was widely reported that the Fumasep E620K cation exchange membrane shows high ionic selectivity and low resistance (<1.5 Ω cm2) at a low cost (<US$25 per m2 at large scale production volumes).39 To demonstrate the feasibility of using Fumasep E620K in our solid conversion type hybrid RFBs, we performed a full cell cycling test at a current density of 40 mA cm−2 using a three dimensional conversion type iron negative electrode, as shown in Fig. 6a and b. The flow cell demonstrated an areal capacity of 40 mA h cm−2 (Fig. 6a) for 100 cycles without obvious capacity decay (Fig. 6b), which demonstrates excellent cycling stability with the Fumasep E620K membrane. Second, while potassium ferrocyanide posolyte is low-cost and highly stable, its solubility is less than 1 M, leading to a low full cell energy density.24 To improve the energy density of the full cell, we demonstrated a full cell using the conversion type iron negative electrode coupled with the high-energy-density posolyte potassium iodide (KI)13,40 with a charge-reinforced ion-selective (CRIS) membrane.5 The galvanostatic voltage profiles and the cycling stability of the conversion type Fe–I2 (4 M KI) flow cell at 20 mA cm−2 are displayed in Fig. 6c and d. The areal capacity of the 1st and 100th cycles was 43.15 and 42.85 mA h cm−2, which translates to a low average decay rate of 0.00695% per cycle, and further verified the cycling stability of the conversion type negative electrode at high areal capacities.

To examine if the iron conversion negative electrode can achieve a high volumetric capacity, we demonstrated two cells that coupled the ferrocyanide posolyte with a small amount of negolyte without flow (0.8 mL negolyte for 100 mA h) or with flow (8 mL negolyte for an 800 mA h cell), as shown in Fig. S11a and b (ESI†). This results in a high volumetric capacity of 119.25 A h L−1negolyte and 98.43 A h L−1negolyte, respectively. We further coupled a 4 M KI posolyte (4 mL negolyte and 6 mL posolyte for 400 mA h), as shown in Fig. S11c and d (ESI†), which demonstrated a high volumetric capacity of 99.17 A h L−1negolyte and a high energy density of 95.63 W h L−1negolyte (38.25 W h L−1negolyte+posolyte). The relatively low energy density of the ferrocyanide case is mainly due to the low solubility of potassium ferrocyanide, which could be further increased by utilizing a Prussian-Blue based redox-targeting electrolyte.41
We further compared two of the most critical performance metrics for hybrid RFBs (achieved areal capacity, and current density)21 for the conversion type all-iron hybrid RFBs with other reported hybrid RFBs (based on metal deposition type with a cycle number larger than 50 cycles). As shown in Fig. 7a and Table S1 (ESI†), our conversion type all-iron hybrid RFB achieved the highest areal capacity at current densities above 40 mA cm−2, and demonstrates the unique advantage and practicability of the solid conversion type RFB system.
 Fig. 7  (a) Comparison of conversion type all-iron hybrid RFBs with other hybrid RFB systems in terms of areal capacity, and current density with a cycle number larger than 50 cycles;13,15,16,27,32,33,40,55 (b) summary of the techno-economic analysis for conservation type all-iron hybrid RFBs with a Nafion 117 membrane (All-Fe@N117), conservation type all-iron hybrid RFBs with a Fumasep E620K membrane (All-Fe@E620K), a deposition zinc–iodide hybrid RFB (ZIFB),38 and a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB).42,43 
The cost of the RFB is one of the most significant factors in determining its potential for commercialization. The micro-sized iron powder used in this solid conversion type hybrid RFB is extremely low-cost, which offers significant advantages in cost reduction compared to conventional RFBs. Techno-economic analyses of the solid conversion type hybrid RFB were performed based the model of Darling et al.42,43 (see the detailed analysis in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 7b, our conversion type all-iron hybrid RFBs promise a much lower installed cost than that of conventional deposition type Zn–I2 hybrid RFBs (ZIFB).38 Interestingly, the conversion type all-iron hybrid RFBs using a Nafion membrane could achieve the DOE cost target (US$150 per kW h) with a 21.4 hour storage duration. Accordingly, we show that the solid conversion type hybrid RFB demonstrated good cycling stability with a 20 hour storage duration for 800 hours (Fig. S12, ESI†), which further proved their potential for long duration energy storage (this is difficult for deposition-based hybrid RFBs, and is normally shorter than 10 hours as represented by the dashed line in Fig. 7a). Furthermore, if Nafion is replaced by the low-cost Fumasep E620K membrane (Fig. 6a and b), the all-iron hybrid RFB could reach US$150 per kW h with a 5.51 hour storage duration. Based on the techno-economic analysis, the conversion type all-iron hybrid RFB developed is one of the most competitive energy storage systems for low-cost and long-duration energy storage applications.
Future work to improve this system is discussed next. First, currently only the Fe3O4/Fe(OH)2 redox couple is utilized but not the Fe(OH)2/Fe couple due to hydrogen evolution side reaction.35 Using additives to suppress hydrogen evolution reaction34 could potentially enable the use of the Fe(OH)2/Fe couple, which will reach 800 mA h cm−2 with current loading if Fe(OH)2/Fe (957.14 mA h g−1 Fe) is used. Second, the electrical conductivity of the conversion electrode is critical especially under high loading conditions, which could be improved following several methods to optimize the active materials such as carbon coating,44,45 nanostructure design,46–48 and electrode design.49 In addition, the flow field design tailored for thick electrodes should be studied. For example, the interdigitated flow field that forced electrolyte through the electrode is beneficial for the inner active materials to access the electrolyte and reduce the overpotential.50 Third, further optimization of electrolyte and electrode composition by adding de-passivating agents,51–53 wetting agents,52 and pore formers52,53 would significantly accelerate the formation process. Lastly, the limited flexibility in decoupling power and energy is a common drawback of all hybrid RFBs (e.g., zinc-RFBs and lithium-RFBs), which could be mitigated by cell structure designs such as flexible belt rotation.54
Conclusions
In summary, conversion type all-iron hybrid RFBs with high areal capacities (11.12 to 215 mA h cm−2), high stability and low cost have been demonstrated for scalable energy storage. Employing the conversion type solid electrode instead of the conventional metal deposition reactions eliminates dendrite issues and limitations on areal capacity. Using a Fe3O4/Fe(OH)2 conversion negative electrode as an example coupled with a Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− posolyte, we demonstrated conversion type all-iron hybrid RFBs with an unprecedentedly high cycling areal capacity of 126.6 mA h cm−2 at 50 mA cm−2 for 200 cycles (1000 hours) and 215 mA h cm−2 at 60 mA cm−2 for 100 cycles (700 hours) without capacity decay. This approach demonstrates the highest areal capacity for hybrid RFB cycling compared to all other deposition/solid type hybrid RFBs. Owing to the extremely low-cost active material iron, the techno-economic analysis shows that the developed conversion type all-iron hybrid RFB offers low installation costs, reaching US$150 per kW h for a 21.4 hour and a 5.51 hour storage duration when using a Nafion and a low-cost Fumasep E620K membrane. The demonstrated conversion type all-iron hybrid RFB is one of the most competitive energy storage systems for low-cost and long-duration energy storage applications.

Broader context
Hybrid redox flow batteries (RFBs) such as Zn-based RFBs offer a much higher energy density compared to all-liquid RFBs. However, they rely on metal dissolution/deposition electrodes, which suffer from severe dendrite issues and poor reversibility, especially at high areal capacities and high current densities. These inherent challenges of metal electrodes preclude their practical deployment for large-scale and long-duration energy storage applications. To break away from this intrinsic limitation, here, we propose and demonstrate the use of high-loading solid conversion electrodes (Fe3O4/Fe(OH)2) to replace metal deposition electrodes to achieve high cycling stability at unprecedentedly high areal capacities/current densities for hybrid RFBs. This work offers a new direction to address the long-unresolved metal dendrite/low areal capacity bottleneck of hybrid RFBs for large-scale and long-duration energy storage applications.
