    , Accepted 11th March 2022First published on 14th March 2022AbstractLayered two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities as sustainable energy materials owing to their high surface area per unit volume arising from the atomically thin architectures, chemically tunable in-plane electrical conductivity, electrocatalytic activities, absorption coefficient, and high stability. Physicochemical modifications of these layered TMDs with plasmonic nanostructures further enhance their optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical properties to saturation limits. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the structural and electrocatalytic properties of layered 2D molybdenum disulfides (MoS2) with and without plasmonic nanostructure modification for their application as an electrode for electrocatalytic hydrogen production via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The 2H-phase of 2D-MoS2 has limited active electrocatalytic sites and low electron conductivity; however, it can be phase transformed into a 1T phase with a larger number of surface catalytic sites and higher metallic conductivity. The structure and properties of the two phases of 2D-MoS2, their synthesis, mechanisms, and characteristics of phase transitions with or without plasmonic nanostructures are thoroughly discussed for their application as an electrocatalyst for the HER. Plasmonic hot electron-assisted 2H to 1T phase transformation in 2D-MoS2 provides enormous opportunities in producing hydrogen efficiently via water splitting. This article also discusses further initiatives required to develop 2D-MoS2 as a large-scale electrocatalyst for hydrogen production.Uttam SharmaUttam Sharma is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Ceramic Engineering under the supervision of Dr Santanu Das at the Indian Institute of Technology (B.H.U.), Varanasi, India.

1. Introduction
As the annual energy consumption of the world is estimated to reach around 778 Etta Joule by 2035, power production from conventional energy resources leading to an adverse environmental impact, thus, it has to be switched to eco-friendly renewable sources.1,2 Renewable energy resources have great potential to satisfy the increasing global energy demand; however, the constant supply of green energy is a significant challenge. Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements on earth in water and hydrocarbons, possessing unique fuel characteristics, e.g., high energy density, recyclability, non-polluting nature, and zero polluting combustion by-products (water), making it an ideal candidate from a future green-energy perspective.3,4 Sustainable hydrogen (H2) generation via photochemical and electrochemical water splitting can be a game changer to combat the global energy crises in an environment-friendly way.5 Apart from industrial applications, e.g., petroleum refining, metal refining, and ammonia production, H2 is nowadays used in various fields such as power production, transportation, and many other domestic applications.6–8 The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water splitting is a catalytic process, which requires a suitable catalyst with high catalytic activity towards water dissociation. Although noble metals, such as platinum (Pt), show high catalytic activities towards the HER, the high cost and scarcity limit their widespread applications.9
Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a group of atomically thin semiconducting materials commonly represented as MX2, where M is a transition metal, e.g., Mo, W, and X is a chalcogen atom, e.g., S, Se, and Te.10–17 For example, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), and tungsten diselenide (WSe2) are recently invented 2D-TMDs, which have created tremendous research interest in scientific communities for the HER. Owing to their unique characteristics such as a direct band gap, atomic-scale thickness, layered structure, and strong spin–orbit coupling, TMDs have drawn huge attention for diverse applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, energy harvesting and storage, flexible electronics, DNA sequencing, etc.15–18Fig. 1 shows the number of publications per year on graphene, MoS2, and other 2D materials depicting the exponential increase of published literature with a growing number of citations. The number of publications per year after 2019 has reduced, which indicates how COVID-19 has hampered the research work worldwide. In particular, it has been found that MoS2, one of the most studied materials of the 2D-TMD family, is a promising candidate for next-generation electronics and energy applications. In this regard, 2D-MoS2 has attracted considerable attention for their use in HER via catalytic water splitting owing to its relatively low cost, earth abundance,19 large in-plane charge transfer (>200 cm2 V−1 s−1),20–22 high catalytic activity,23 high absorption of solar radiation (2.8 × 106 cm−1),24–26 efficient interfacial charge transfer, high specific surface area (412.3 m2 g−1),174 good stability,28–30 and relatively low energy barrier that is associated with hydrogen adsorption and desorption (0.047–0.06 eV).31–35 Similar to graphene, MoS2 is also a layered material in which one molybdenum (Mo) atomic layer is sandwiched between two sulfur (S) layers, i.e. (S–Mo–S), to form a MoS2 monolayer. These MoS2 monolayers are vertically stacked and held together by weak van der Waals forces acting between adjacent S–Mo–S layers. As a result of such a weak van der Waals attraction and layered structure, even a relatively small amount of force causes sliding of these (S–Mo–S) monolayers against each other in order to produce 2D monolayer MoS2.36–39 Primarily, MoS2 exists in two different phases, namely 2H and 1T phases, semiconducting and metallic, respectively.40–43
 Fig. 1  Number of publications per year of various 2D materials (till June 2021): (a) graphene, (b) major TMDs, i.e., (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, MoTe2 and WTe2), (c) MoS2 and (d) other 2D materials (borophene, silicene, germanene, and phosphorene) showing that MoS2 is one of the most studied 2D post-graphene materials. [These data were generated from the Web of Science database on 01 July 2021 using the keywords “graphene”, “2D MoS2”, “molybdenum di-sulfide nanosheets”, “MoTe2”, “Borophene”, “MXene”, etc.]. 
Semiconducting 2H-MoS2 exhibits faster in-plane charge transfer; however, the electrocatalytic activities of the 2H phase are suppressed due to limited catalytically active sites for charge transfer on its basal plane and its semiconducting nature.30,44 As, 1T-MoS2 performs like a metal and participates in faster electrocatalytic charge transfer, thereby offering an efficient electrocatalyst for the HER. Recently, various techniques have been identified for direct phase transformation of MoS2 from 2H to 1T. These phase transformation techniques include chemical changes,45–48 introducing sulfur vacancies,49 heat treatment,50,51 electron beam treatment,50,52,53 applying strain,39,54 argon plasma-induced phase transition,55 and plasmonic hot-electron insertion in MoS2.56–59 Among these techniques, plasmonic hot-electron-assisted phase transformation draws substantial research attention because the process demonstrates faster water electrocatalysis with high stability and reliability. The plasmon-induced phase-transformation process could develop next-generation rapid HER due to its accelerated interfacial charge transfer, faster charge regeneration, and high efficiency.60–62
In this article, a comprehensive overview of plasmonic hot-electron induced phase transition in 2D-MoS2 from semiconducting (2H) MoS2 into metallic (1T) MoS2 is demonstrated. A detailed discussion is focused on the evolution of the optical, electrical, and catalytic properties of 2D-MoS2 associated with such hot-electron-assisted semiconducting to the metallic phase transition. Various charge-transfer processes and associated phase-transformation mechanisms are broadly depicted in this overview. In particular, this review presents an extensive outline of diverse plasmonic material-based hot-electron-induced localized phase transition mechanisms and their efficacy towards electrocatalytic and photo-electrocatalytic water splitting. Finally, the current status and future prospects of such a phase-transformation-assisted HER of MoS2 are also illustrated in this review.
2. Polymorphs of MoS2
MoS2 occurs naturally in the form of molybdenite and appears as a dark and shiny solid. A single layer of MoS2 consists of a molybdenum (Mo) atomic layer sandwiched between two sulfur (S) layers, as shown in Fig. 2a. Atoms within the S–Mo–S layer are covalently bonded to each other, while in bulk or few layer MoS2, a weak van der Waals force is acting between two adjacent S–Mo–S layers. Fig. 2a also shows (bottom panel) the arrangement of atoms in monolayer MoS2 from different viewpoints i.e., isometric view and top view. Based on the crystal structure, layer arrangement, and Mo–S coordination, MoS2 has four polymorphs as follows: distorted tetragonal (1T-MoS2), hexagonal (1H and 2H-MoS2) and rhombohedral (3R-MoS2) phases.63–68 In different phases of MoS2, the first digit indicates the number of layers of (S–Mo–S) present in the atomic layer arrangement; at the same time, alphabets represent the crystal structure, e.g., 1T indicates that it has one S–Mo–S layer and it has a tetragonal structure. The atomic arrangement, Mo coordination, and number of layers in a unit cell for all four polymorphs of MoS2 are shown in a later part (Fig. 3). The characteristic lattice parameters of the MoS2 layer are shown in Fig. 2b. The distances Mo–S and S–S within a layer are 3.16 Å and 2.41 Å, respectively; however, the perpendicular distances between Mo–S and S–S atoms in different layers are 1.58 Å and 3.17 Å, respectively.69

(b) Lattice structure of 1T′-MoS2; (c) lattice parameter and zigzag bonding of Mo atoms in the 1T′-MoS2 polymorph. 
2H-MoS2 is a naturally occurring and thermodynamically most stable polymorph and exhibits semiconducting behaviour with a band gap of 1.2–1.8 eV depending upon its bulk form or atomically thin monolayer form. Bulk MoS2 has an indirect band gap of 1.2 eV; however, the transition from an indirect to a direct band gap (1.8 eV) occurs with decrease in the thickness (monolayer or few layers) of MoS2. The lattice constants of 2H-MoS2 are α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, a = b = 3.16 Å, and c = 12.29 Å and the conductivity of 2H-MoS2 increases with increase in temperature and decreases with increasing thickness.69,71 In 2H-MoS2, molybdenum and sulfur atomic layeres are stacked in such a way that upper and lower sulfur layers are vertically aligned to each other as shown in Fig. 3a.72
The other polymorph of MoS2 is the distorted tetragonal (1T) phase, which is metastable and metallic in nature. In 1T-MoS2, one ‘Mo’ atom is in octahedral coordination with six surrounding ‘S’ atoms, as shown in Fig. 3a. The ‘Mo’ layer is sandwiched between two ‘S’ layers; however, the two ‘S’ layers are slightly offset, i.e., the upper ‘S’ layer is not exactly above the lower ‘S’ layer.
On the other hand, 1H-MoS2 with a trigonal prismatic structure is more stable than the 1T-MoS2 phase. Similar to 2H-MoS2, the 1H polymorph of MoS2 also has one ‘Mo’ atom octahedrally coordinated with six surrounding ‘S’ atoms, as shown in Fig. 3a. The ‘Mo’ layer is sandwiched between two ‘S’ layers, and the upper ‘S’ layer is directly above the lower ‘S’ layer. Correspondingly, 3R-MoS2 has a rhombohedral structure and is found only in the bulk form of MoS2, and 3R-MoS2 consists of three (S–Mo–S) layers per unit cell as shown in Fig. 3a. The lattice parameters of 3R-MoS2 are a = b = 3.17 Å, c = 18.38 Å, angles α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°.73,74 3R-MoS2 also exhibits the layered structure of (S–Mo–S) formed with ‘Mo’ atoms coordinated with ‘S’ atoms in a trigonal prismatic arrangement as shown in Fig. 3a.
The distorted form of the 1T phase is known as 1T′-MoS2 in which molybdenum atoms and sulfur atoms are in distorted octahedral coordination with lesser symmetry than 1T-MoS2 as shown in Fig. 3b. The distorted 1T phase (1T′-MoS2) is a modified form of 1T-MoS2 through some structural treatment like heating, applying strain, metal doping, etc. Unlike 2H and 1T, the 2D lattice of the 1T′ phase forms a rectangle with an orthorhombic crystal structure, which belongs to the space group Pmn21 (C2v). In a 1T′-MoS2 lattice, each Mo is connected with six S atoms and two Mo atoms in a zigzag fashion as illustrated in Fig. 3c. The Raman active vibrational modes are 147 cm−1, 151 cm−1 (J1), 216 cm−1, 223 cm−1 (J2), 286 cm−1, 333 cm−1 (J3), and 350 cm−1. It has superior charge transfer kinetics and catalytic activity; however, the HER activity of 1T′-MoS2 is commensurate with the 2H phase of MoS2. The Mo–Mo distance along the a-axis is 2.95 ± 0.06 Å, and the distance between adjacent Mo atoms within a zigzag chain is 2.70 ± 0.06 Å, while the distance between two zigzag chains is 3.68 ± 0.08 Å.75–77
The semiconducting nature of 2H-MoS2 can be explained by crystal field theory, which confirms that the symmetry induced splitting of the Mo 4d orbitals of the D3h-MoS6 unit generates three groups, viz. (1) a completely occupied Mo 4dz2, (2) unoccupied Mo 4dxy and Mo 4dx2–y2, and (3) unoccupied Mo 4dxy and 4dyz orbitals as shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4a shows the total and partial density of states (DOS) of 2H MoS2 and the distribution of valence or donor electrons in the Mo 4d orbitals.79 In 1T-MoS2, as shown in Fig. 4b, the ‘Mo’ 4d orbital forms degenerate dxy, dyz, and dxz (t2g), and dz2 and dx2–y2 (eg) orbitals. Due to the partially filled lower-lying t2g orbital, 1T-MoS2 exhibits metallic characteristics while displaying thermodynamically metastable or unstable characteristics.80 The electronic conductivity of the MoS2 metallic phase is in the range of 10–100 S cm−1, which is remarkably higher than that of its 2H semiconducting phase by an order of 107.81 In particular, the critical characteristic of 1T-MoS2 is the inter-layer spacing (∼1 nm), which is larger than that of 2H-MoS2 (∼0.65 nm), whereas the 1T phase generally is not found in bulk MoS2; however, it can be found in monolayer or few-layer MoS2.81

The optical and electronic properties of 2H-MoS2 can be adjusted via band gap tuning due to the quantum confinement effect.82 For example, when bulk MoS2 (∼1.29 eV) is reduced to 2D-MoS2 (∼1.8 eV), the photocatalytic activity of MoS2 increases. Similarly, the metallic 1T phase of MoS2 possesses several fascinating properties over naturally occurring 2H-MoS2, such as larger active sites on edges, enhanced catalytic sites on basal planes, and very high electronic conductivity. Although 1T-MoS2 can be prepared by various physical and chemical methods from 2H-MoS2, the 1T phase of MoS2 is highly unstable.27,83,84 Typically, performing 2H to 1T phase transformation in 2D-MoS2 is highly challenging, and only a few techniques that can convert 2H to 1T MoS2 have been reported to date.47,56,85–89
3. Synthesis of monolayer MoS2
A monolayer to few layers of 2D-MoS2 can be synthesized by various physical and chemical techniques, and this section provides a brief overview of popular and essential synthesis processes. Generally, the synthesis techniques of monolayer MoS2 can be categorized into (1) top-down and (2) bottom-up as represented in Fig. 5. Mechanical exfoliation, chemical exfoliation, rapid sonication, and electrochemical exfoliation can be classified as top-down techniques, whereas physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), solution-based chemical processes and electrodeposition are well classified as bottom-up approaches.
 Fig. 5  Different techniques for the synthesis of monolayer MoS2. 
Mechanical exfoliation (ME) is a well-accepted technique to produce crystalline, pure, and atomically thin 2D nanosheets of layered materials such as MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, graphene, etc.90,91 ME involves adhesive scotch tape to peel off thin crystals from the bulk of MoS2, where these freshly cleaved crystals can be deposited onto any substrates from the scotch tape, as demonstrated in Fig. 6a. A monolayer or few layers of MoS2 can be efficiently fabricated by this scotch tape-assisted mechanical exfoliation method. For example, a monolayer to quadruple layers of MoS2 were fabricated on a SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrate by mechanical exfoliation and the thickness of the exfoliated thin flakes was measured to be 0.8 nm, 1.5 nm, 2.1 nm, and 2.9 nm, which delineate one layer, two layers, three layers, and four layers of MoS2, respectively, as reported elsewhere.92
 Fig. 6  Illustration of (a) mechanical exfoliation technique; (b) chemical exfoliation and lithium intercalation; (c) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique; (d) synthesis of MoS2 nanosheets/flakes via the hydrothermal technique. 
Liquid phase exfoliation or chemical exfoliation, as shown in Fig. 6b, employ ion intercalation through layered 2D TMDs and solvent-based chemical exfoliation in a high-energy sonication process (Coleman method).93 This is a rapid method with high controllability to exfoliate monolayer MoS2 by electrochemical lithiation followed by subsequent sonication that yields 92% monolayer MoS2 as reported by Zhang et al.94 In fact, chemical exfoliation showed a high production rate of 2D nanoflakes of TMDs as compared to mechanical exfoliation; however, the use of sonication in chemical exfoliation could result in defect incorporation in the 2D lattice and could reduce the other properties of MoS2 nanoflakes.95
Over the time, the synthesis of large-area MoS2 with high structural uniformity and compositional homogeneity has been a serious challenge. In this regard, chemical vapor deposition (CVD)90,91 has drawn considerable attention because of its enormous potential to synthesize seamlessly wafer-scale, continuous single film TMDs with enhanced stoichiometric uniformity and subsequent structural homogeneity (Fig. 6c). The most prevalent precursors for the CVD synthesis of monolayer or few-layer MoS2 are ‘Mo’ compounds in powder forms (e.g., MoCl5, MoO3), ammonium/sodium thiomolybdates, MoS2 powder, etc.96–98 In a CVD techniques, 0.72 nm thin and uniform monolayer MoS2 was successfully deposited on a graphene treated SiO2 substrate where MoO3 and sulfur (S) powder were used as precursors.96 Correspondingly, a self-limiting CVD method was demonstrated to develop a uniform film of 2D-MoS2 of a few square centimeters area by using MoCl5 instead of MoO3.97,99,100
Most of the synthesis techniques belong to the top-down approach category. These techniques are sensitive to the environment, use harsh pre-treatment procedures, time-consuming, and use expensive and hazardous organic solvents, while hydrothermal synthesis is very attractive method due to economic and environmental advantages.101,102 Ren et al. fabricated monolayer MoS2 quantum dots for HER application via a hydrothermal technique using Na2MoO4·2H2O and C14H14S2 in DI water and ethanol at 220 °C for 18 h as shown in Fig. 6d. The electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding HER activity with a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec−1 and an onset potential of 160 mV.103 Electrodeposition is a technique used for the controlled deposition of materials on a conducting surface with the help of an electric current. The conducting material will be immerged in an ionic solution containing the material to be deposited. Noori et al. reported the synthesis of few layer semiconducting MoS2via an electrodeposition technique using dichloromethane, tetrabutylammonium tetrathiomolybdate, and trimethylammonium chloride (Table 1).104

MoS2 has a small interlayer spacing of ∼6.5 Å and therefore, alkali metal ions and Lewis bases can easily be intercalated through the interlayers of MoS2 owing to the smaller size of alkali metal ions. Alkali metal intercalation, e.g., Li+, Na+, and K+, by means of the liquid ammonia technique can drastically manipulate the structural and electronic properties of MoS2. After alkali metal intercalation, semiconducting MoS2 becomes superconducting because of the increase in the electron density and density of states of the Fermi surface via electron transfer from alkali metals to an empty band of MoS2.87,118,119 The 2H to 1T transition involves a two step process, in which the Na+ ions intercalate into 2H-MoS2 interlayers and form an intermediate 2H-Na0.25MoS2 phase in the first step, followed by the conversion of 2H-Na0.5MoS2 to 1T-Na0.5MoS2 phases with further addition of Na+ ions in the next step. Primarily, the 2H to 1T-Na0.5MoS2 phase transformation occurs due to inter-valance charge transfer between Mo3+ and Mo4+ ions and lattice destabilization in 2H-MoS2. Fig. 7 shows the schematic representation of sodium ions occupying the interlayer S–S tetrahedral sites and the transition of ‘Mo’ coordination from trigonal to octahedral.120 It was reported that sodium ions prefer to occupy the ‘S’ octahedral sites and the interlayer S–S tetrahedral sites due to low energy configuration, as shown in Fig. 7a.120 Consequently, the induced large strain and increased electronic energy destabilize the 2H-MoS2 lattice, which causes a lateral (horizontal) shift of the upper sulfur plane along the atomic plane resulting in the phase transition of 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 as shown in Fig. 7b.120 After alkali metal intercalation, the broad conduction band of the metal overlaps with the unoccupied d/p band of MoS2 resulting in the transfer of charge carriers to MoS2 such that AXMoS2 (where, ‘A’ represents alkali metals) is metallic with a significant increase in the free electron density over pure MoS2.119 Though the phase transition occurs from 2H to 1T, controlling the transition process in monolayer MoS2 is quite difficult due to the lack of control over number of layers, defects, size, and edge effect.56

Semiconducting to metallic phase transition via intercalation is highly challenging for monolayer MoS2 due to the unstable 1T phase, which quickly transforms back to the 2H phase upon heating at around 353 K. Strain engineering, on the other hand, is a very effective method for semiconducting to metallic phase transition in 2H-MoS2via interlayer plane gliding and displacement of the ‘S’ layer in the transverse direction. Hwang et al. reported phase transition from 2H to 1T by inner atomic plane gliding of neighboring (S–Mo–S) layers by a rolling process.121Fig. 8 illustrates the phase transition mechanism in 2H-MoS2 by strain engineering via a rolling process. In this method, the phase transition occurs due to the 3D strain generated by internal forces in the MoS2 lattice. The metallic phase emerges when the upper sulfur layer glides over a distance equal to a = 3.16 Å and occupies the center site of the hexagonal 2H phase. The transition is irreversible due to interlayer van der Waals interaction and is highly stable up to 473 K. Lin et al. reported that the phase transition could also be obtained by using an electron beam. Continuous irradiation of an electron beam results in the accumulation of negative charge and triggers the phase transition.50

5. Phase transition via plasmonic hot electron process
5.1 Synthesis of plasmonic metal/MoS2 hybrid structure
The synthesis of Au and Ag nanoparticles is a very well established technique reported elsewhere.128–130 Efficient electron transfer from metal nanoparticles to 2H-MoS2 requires the formation of an interface between metal and MoS2. For fabrication of metals (Au, Ag, transient metals, metal alloys)/2H-MoS2 hybrids, various synthesis techniques have been reported such as spin coating,131 drop casting,132 PAA template assisted electrodeposition,133 intercalation of plasmonic metals,134 doping of metals,135 self-assembly of metal nanoparticles on the MoS2 surface,136 femtosecond pulse irritation synthesis,137 and chemical integration of metal nanoparticles with MoS2.138
5.2 Hot electron generation and transfer
Plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), etc., integrated with 2D materials e.g., TMDs, graphene, etc., have shown immense potential for tuning the optical and electrical properties of 2D materials.57,139 Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is the collective excitation of the surface plasmonic NPs promoting the absorption, scattering of light, and photo-reactivity by a strong light–matter interaction.140 The energy stored in the LSPR can decay via three mechanisms as shown in Fig. 9a such as (1) relaxation from a non-Fermi to Fermi electron via electron–electron (e–e) scattering, (2) cooling of hot electron gas via electron–phonon (e–ph) scattering, and (3) heat dissipation from NPs to the environment via phonon–phonon (ph–ph) scattering. The generation of energetic (also known as hot-electron) electron–hole pairs by plasmonic decay via non-radiative (e–e) scattering is another essential characteristic of these NPs.141 The generated hot carriers fall back to the ground state, followed by thermalization and relaxing, as shown in Fig. 9a.140Fig. 9b illustrates a schematic representation of the time scale of hot carrier generation and the hot electron transfer and subsequently transfer back of hot electrons in the cases of clean metals, metals/adsorbates, and metals/semiconductors. The size of the NPs also influences the charge generation and transfer. Nordlander et al. reported that with an increase in the size of the Ag NPs, the hot-electron generation enhances while the energy of the charge carriers decreases.142 Sundararaman et al. reported that the energy distribution of generated hot electrons depends upon the band structure of the plasmonic NPs.143 In the case of clean metals, as shown in Fig. 9b, the generated hot carriers initially have a nonthermal distribution, which rapidly thermalizes to a Fermi–Dirac distribution by e–e and e–ph scattering (100 fs–10 ps). The generated heat is then dissipated to the environment (100 ps–10 ns). On the other hand, in the case of metal/semiconductor interfaces, the transfer of electrons occurs via two paths (a) indirect electron transfer and (b) direct electron transfer. The hot electron can either directly interact with the adsorbed molecules/semiconductor material on the metal surface or they can be transferred to the semiconductor interface via plasmon mediated electron transfer (PMET).144,145 As the electronic structure and the spatial distribution of the charge carriers (hot electron) over time at the interface have a great influence on the catalytic activities, understanding the processes at the interface is very important.146

The hot electron generation and charge transfer from anisotropic Au nanoparticles to the MoS2 monolayer are illustrated in Fig. 10. In the Au@MoS2 heterostructure, the hot electron transfer from gold to MoS2 competes with the LSPR emission and results in PL damping as the primary decay channel. Fig. 10a shows the interband transition, TSPR and LSPR using a 405 nm laser to produce the hot electron–hole pair. Fig. 10b demonstrates the interface of Au/MoS2 and the time frame of charge separation for the HER. Specifically, the hot electrons with energy higher than the Schottky barrier energy (∼0.8 eV) are transferred to the conduction band of 2D-MoS2, thereby activating phase transformation from 2H into 1T. It is evident from recent reports that the effective barrier height of the Au/MoS2 junction promotes a lower hot carrier recombination time (∼800 ps), which further enhances the stability of the 2H to 1T phase transformation, thus improving the HER performance of Au@MoS2 compared to other plasmonic nanoparticles.

To understand the plasmon-induced hot-electron transfer mechanisms for enhanced HER in Au NP@MoS2, single-particle PL was measured by Zhang et al.Fig. 11a–c show the single-particle PL images of various Au@MoS2 structures. The emission intensity of the Au NPs was found to be stronger than that of large-area 2D-MoS2. The weaker emission intensity of monolayer MoS2 can be attributed to the non-radiative decay. The intensity further decreases in Au@MoS2 due to PL quenching by MoS2 at the metal–semiconductor interface. Fig. 11d shows the experimental setup of confocal microscopy for single particle PL measurement, whereas the PL spectra of 2D-MoS2 and various Au nanostructures are shown in Fig. 11e. MoS2 shows a significant peak at 660 nm and a shoulder peak at 610 nm, while the PL peak of Au nanostructures was observed at 510 nm. A redshift in the PL peak of Au@MoS2 (540 nm) and broadening with much lower intensity than Au nanostructures can be seen in Fig. 11f, showing the strong interaction of Au and MoS2 resulting in PL quenching at the interface.

It should be mentioned that once the electron is transferred to the conduction band of the semiconductor, recombination probability become lower because there are no holes in the valence band of the wide band gap semiconductor, which results in a longer lifetime of the hot electrons.147
5.3 Effect of the Schottky barrier height (SBH) on plasmonic charge transfer
The Schottky barrier height (SBH) is the potential energy required by excited hot electrons for metal to semiconductor transfer. Fig. 12a shows the schematic representation of hot electron generation by surface plasmon decay and the hot electron transfer from the metal to the semiconductor conduction band. The Fowler law shows that the charge transfer efficiency in the indirect transfer mechanism is related to the SBH.140,148 I = c(hν − EB)n/hν(1)where ‘c’ is the Fowler emission coefficient, EB is the Schottky energy barrier, ‘n’ is a constant depending upon the intrinsic properties of the material, ‘h’ is plank's constant and ν is the frequency of the incident light. Previously, the SBH was calculated by using the Mott–Schottky equation, which states that the barrier height is the difference between the work function of the metal and the electron affinity of the semiconductor. ϕB = ϕM − χSC(2)where ϕB is the Schottky barrier height, ϕM is the work function of the metal and χSC is the electron affinity of the semiconductor. Both ϕM and χSC can be calculated by photoemission spectroscopy.149 Most of the recent studies manifest that ‘ϕB’ is not only dependent on the work function of the metal and semiconductor, but also dependent on the metal semiconductor interaction, which causes charge redistribution at the interface.149 A graphical representation showing the correlation between the SBH and metal work function for various metals is shown in Fig. 12b. Metal–semiconductor interaction at the interface creates an interfacial dipole and results in pinning of the Fermi level just below the conduction band of the semiconductor. Hence, for determining the SBH, an additional term, i.e., step potential is introduced in the Schottky–Mott rule given in eqn (2) and becomes: ϕB = ϕM − χSC − ΔV(3)where ΔV is the step potential and can be given by the ratio of the metal work function to the work function of the metal surface covered with MoS2. ΔV = ϕM/ϕAds/M(4)

The schematic representation of the energy band diagram of a typical metal and n-type semiconductor before and after the formation of the Schottky junction has been shown in Fig. 12c.
5.4 Schottky barrier height for MoS2/metal contacts
In MoS2–metal contact, the Schottky barrier heights used to vary with the work function of the metals. Fig. 13a shows the variation of step potential with the work function of different metals for MoS2/metal contacts. The electron affinity of MoS2 is in the range of ∼4.3 eV, while the work function of MoS2 is ∼4.7 eV. For metals having a work function higher than that of MoS2 (e.g., Au, Ni, Pd, Co, etc.), the SBH is linearly proportional to the metal work function as shown in Fig. 13b; however, for low work function metals (e.g., Ag, Al, Mn, Cr, etc.), the Fermi level gets pinned below the conduction band of MoS2 due to strong metal–MoS2 interaction at the interface. Such low work function metal generated Fermi-level pinning in MoS2 results in a finite potential barrier of ∼0.1–0.3 eV. A low SBH facilitates easy transfer of a hot electron from the metal to MoS2; however, the electron falls back rapidly to the metal surface and recombines with the hole counterpart. For high work function metals, the SBH helps in trapping the hot electrons transferred to the conduction band of the semiconducting material and prolongs their stay there in order to prevent recombination.61 In MoS2, the step potential is reported to be positive for high work function metals and negative for low work function metals. The negative step potential shows that the Fermi level is pinned, and the SBH is independent of the metal work function. Farmanbar et al. reported that the SBH could be lowered by metal surface modification by absorbing monolayer h-BN, as shown in Fig. 13c.152 The robust metal/semiconductor interaction, which is also responsible for Fermi level pining, can also be reduced by applying a boron nitride (BN) monolayer and lowering the overall SBH (Fig. 13d).

5.5 Mechanism of plasmonic hot-electron assisted phase transition in MoS2
Hot electrons generated by surface plasmon decay are transferred to the MoS2 monolayer via plasmon-mediated energy transfer (PMET). The electronic properties of MoS2 are changed drastically by Fermi level modulation after charge doping from plasmonic NPs to MoS2. Kang et al. demonstrated that the transient reversible phase transition from semiconducting to metallic MoS2 occurs by Au nanoparticle deposition on the MoS2 monolayer. Because of an atomically thin monolayer, the SBH for Au and MoS2 monolayers is less than 0.8 eV; hence the generated hot electrons are easily transferred to the conduction band of 2H-MoS2.56 In this regard, the 2H-MoS2 lattice becomes unstable by charge doping and causes a localized phase transition from 2H to 1T. Fig. 14a shows the schematic representation of hot electrons generated by plasmon decay and electron transfer in the MoS2 monolayer. The Mo 4d orbital of 2H-MoS2 is distributed in three groups: (1) completely filled generated orbital (dz2), (2) two empty degenerated orbitals dxy and dx2–y2, and (3) two empty degenerated orbitals dxz and dyz. Because the dz2 orbital is totally filled, 2H-MoS2 is very stable at room temperature.153 The semiconducting nature of 2H-MoS2 can be attributed to the completely filled dz2 orbital and empty degenerate orbitals. As soon as the charges (i.e., hot electrons) are injected in the monolayer, as shown in Fig. 14b, this excess charge occupies one of the degenerate orbitals (dxy), which results in a partially filled energy orbital and destabilizes the lattice structure.

The increased electronic energy of the MoS2 lattice and interfacial charge interaction between Au NPs and MoS2 cause sliding of the upper ‘S’ layer (as shown in Fig. 7b) in the armchair direction, thereby weakening the upper Mo–S bond. The Mo coordination changes from trigonal prismatic to octahedral and the rearrangement of the Mo 4d orbital into two groups of degenerated orbitals: (1) lower energy degenerated dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals and (2) higher energy degenerated dz2 and dx2–y2 orbitals. This as-transformed new phase of 1T-MoS2 shows metallic characteristics and is metastable because of its partially filled valence orbitals.153 Immediately, the charge rearrangement of valence electrons ensues (Fig. 14b), which acts as a driving force to gain thermodynamic stability. Thus, 1T-MoS2 transformed back to its stable 2H semiconductor phase. Furthermore, the injection of more hot electrons in MoS2 successively promote the permanent stabilization of the 1T phase.56 The phase transition from 2H to 1T can be confirmed by various physicochemical techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, XPS, UV-visible absorption, photoluminescence, synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).
6. Characterization of metallic 1T MoS2
It was evident from the previous discussions that the plasmonic nanoparticles deposited on monolayer MoS2 typically induce hot electrons at metal–semiconductor interfaces, thereby promoting phase transition from 2H to 1T. Several characterization techniques (e.g. UV-vis spectroscopy, PL spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, etc.) evaluate the plasmonic effects of NPs by correlating their structural and optical properties associated with 2D-MoS2 nanosheets. Fig. 15a, b, and c show the UV-vis, Raman, and PL spectra of MoS2, Au@MoS2, and Au@MoS2–ZnO, respectively. It is evident from Fig. 15a that Au@MoS2 has higher absorption in the visible range than pristine MoS2. As a benchmark, the UV-visible technique is one of the efficient techniques to identify the different phases of MoS2. In Fig. 15a, the UV-vis spectrum of the 2H phase shows two simultaneous absorption peaks at 613 nm and 660 nm, which primarily originate because of energy splitting of the valence band spin-orbital coupling with the lateral dimension in the 2H phase. The absorption spectrum of Au@MoS2 shows monotonic change except for a peak in the absorption spectra at 530 nm showing the metallic properties of 1T-MoS2. All three structures show in-plane mode E12g and out of plane mode A1g at 378 cm−1 and 404 cm−1 (Fig. 15b). These two Raman modes are characteristic of 2H MoS2. Besides these two peaks, additional vibrational modes also occur in the case of Au@MoS2 and Au@MoS2–ZnO structures. Fig. 15c shows the PL spectra of MoS2, Au@MoS2, and Au@MoS2–ZnO. The PL peak at 682 nm is attributed to the excitonic transition of direct band gap 2H-MoS2; however, when Au NPs are introduced, the PL intensity is significantly decreased and shifted towards a higher wavelength because of photon-exciton solid interaction.153 The optical transmission images and corresponding Raman and PL spectra are shown in Fig. 15d. Additional Raman peaks at 160, 230, 280, and 330 cm−1 are also seen in the Raman spectra of MoS2 with Au NPs. These additional peaks are characteristic Raman peaks of the metallic phase MoS2. The distinct peaks of the 2H phase at 378 and 404 cm−1 are still prominent even after Au doping, indicating that phase transition by the plasmonic hot electrons is a localized process. The blue shift of E12g and A1g vibrational modes occurs due to the increase of charge carriers in the conduction band of MoS2 owing to the hot-electron transfer at the interface. Another probable reason for the blue shift could be lattice strain generation and rise in the temperature of the system by charge doping. Fig. 15e shows various structures of MoS2. The photoluminescence spectra (PL) of hexagon structured MoS2 for 1T and 2H phases are compared along with the shift in the PL spectrum with an increase of the incident laser power (Fig. 15f). The PL intensity of the metallic phase is usually low as compared with the 2H phase, and the spectral shift in the PL intensity is primarily due to narrowing of the band gap of MoS2 due to phase transition from 2H to 1T.56

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a reliable and commonly used technique for phase identification, visualization of crystal structures, and atomic arrangement. Fig. 16a shows the TEM images of Au@MoS2 reported by Y. Shi et al.113 The TEM image shows randomly decorated Au nanorods on the as-prepared MoS2 monolayer. Fig. 16b depicts the UV-vis spectra of chemically exfoliated MoS2 (ce-MoS2), Au nanorods, and Au@MoS2. Chemically exfoliated MoS2 and Au@MoS2 show clear peaks near the UV region while gold and Au@MoS2 show peaks at around 813 nm. The red shift in the UV-visible spectrum of the gold decorated MoS2 essentially indicates a strong interaction between the Au nanorods and the MoS2 monolayer. XPS is another essential technique for the exact quantification of 1T and 2H phases. The XPS spectra of Mo 3d peak, S 2p peak, and Au 4f peak are shown in Fig. 16c, d, and e, respectively. Two characteristic peaks of Mo 3d corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 are generally found at 220 and 232 eV energies, respectively. The XPS spectrum of Au–MoS2 shows a positive shift of 0.29 eV compared to Au rods, which indicates electron transfer from the Au nanoparticles to the MoS2 monolayer. Fig. 16f also illustrates the Raman spectra of ce-MoS2 and Au @MoS2. The resulting blue shift of 2.43 cm−1 in the Raman spectra of Au@MoS2 is due to the interaction between Au and MoS2, which restricts the vertical vibration of the sulfur atoms.

Rani et al. investigated and reported the effect of Au NPs on the structural and optical properties of MoS2 nanosheets. For the synthesis of an Au@MOS2 hybrid, 2 ml dispersion of chemically exfoliated MoS2 was mixed with varying quantities of Au salt solution i.e. 2 μL, 4 μL, 6 μL and 8 μL (HAuCl4·3H2O) and kept for aging for 48 hours. These samples were named SET-I, SET-II, SET-III and SET-IV respectively. The effect of increasing the concentration of Au nanoparticles on XRD, Raman, and absorption spectra can be seen in Fig. 17. It can be seen in the Raman spectra that with an increase in the Au salt content from 2 to 8 μL, the intensity of the Raman peaks increased; however, a red shift in the peak can be seen, which might be because of the effect of lattice strain due to the MoS2 curvature (Fig. 17a). The absorption spectra of MoS2 and Au@MoS2 are compared in Fig. 17b. Upon Au addition into MoS2, a new peak corresponding to the Au plasmon band emerges, and the intensity of this new peak increases with increasing Au concentration. Fig. 17b clearly shows that with increasing the Au concentration the characteristic excitonic peak of 2H MoS2 is reduced and the absorption spectra approaches monotonic absorption throughout the visible range indicating the metallic behaviour of MoS2.154 In the XRD pattern of MoS2 and Au decorated MoS2, as shown in Fig. 17c, with an increase in the Au concentration, the MoS2 peak intensity is reduced. In contrast, the Au peak becomes prominent, which suggests the successful deposition of Au nanoparticles on MoS2. The Williamson–Hall (W–H) plot shows a linear variation of βcosθ with respect to sinθ and calculated lattice strain in MoS2 is higher than that in Au@MoS2 as shown in Fig. 17d.154 From the W–H plot (Fig. 17d), the slope of the curve indicates the lattice strain where the black curve typically demonstrates a higher slope, indicating higher strain in pure MoS2. The exfoliated 2H-MoS2 nanosheet has inbuilt lattice strain due to the edge effect, which was calculated to be of the order of 0.0018 and 0.0015 for 2H-MoS2 and Au@MoS2, respectively. This reduction in lattice strain could be attributed to the reduced crystallite size due to phase-transferred MoS2 upon loading of Au nanoparticles, loss of the crystalline fraction in Au@MoS2, and size-dependent broadening of the XRD peaks.154

These characterization techniques are crucial for understanding the role of plasmonic nanoparticles, their shape and size, and concentration, which significantly affect the structural and morphological aspects of 2D-MoS2. An appropriate characterization technique can visualize the in-depth mechanism of the phase transition from 2H to 1T. The effect of phase transition on the HER performance of MoS2 is discussed in the very next section.
7. Plasmonic assisted HER activity of Au NP decorated MoS2
Hydrogen generation by water splitting has shown immense potential to fulfill the energy demand. The overall water splitting can be achieved by photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and thermochemical processes with the help of various electrocatalysts. The hydrogen evolution reaction occurs at the cathode of electrochemical cell, while the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs at the anode. The half-cell reactions are given below:155
Reduction:2H+ + 2e− → H2; E0vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode) = 0
Oxidation:2H2O → O2 + 4e− + 4H+; E0vs. NHE = 1.23 eV
There are two pathways by which the HER can occur, namely the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism and Volmer–Tafel mechanism as shown in Fig. 18.33,66,155,156Fig. 18a1 shows the Volmer reaction in acidic medium in which a H2 atom binds to the catalyst surface (transient adsorption of H2) followed by either a Heyrovsky (Fig. 18a2) or a Tafel reaction (Fig. 18a3). Generally, the Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction exhibits a lower energy barrier for the electrochemical reaction than the Volmer–Tafel reaction.156 The mechanisms of Volmer–Heyrovsky responses are given below in both acidic and alkaline media:H3O+ + e− + * ↔ H* + H2O (Volmer acidic media)H2O + e− + * ↔ H* + OH− (Volmer alkaline media)H* + H3O+ + e− ↔ H2 + H2O + * (Heyrovsky reaction)H* + H2O + e− ↔ H2 + OH− (Heyrovsky reaction)

(b1) Volmer reaction in alkaline medium showing the adsorption of H+ atoms on the MoS2 surface. (b2) Heyrovsky reaction mechanism in basic media showing H+ atom desorption and H2 molecule evolution. (b3) Tafel reaction in basic medium, showing H+ atom desorption and H2 molecule evolution. 
Similarly, the Volmer–Tafel reaction mechanisms in both alkaline and acidic media are given below:H3O+ + e− + * ↔ H* + H2O (Volmer acidic media)H2O + e− + * ↔ H* + OH− (Volmer alkaline media)H* + H* ↔ H2 + 2* (Tafel Reaction)where ‘*’ represents an empty active site and ‘H*’ represents a hydrogen atom bound to an active site of the catalyst. In both the reaction pathways, the free energy of hydrogen (H2) adsorption, ΔGH, controls the adsorption and desorption of H+ on the catalyst surface. ΔGH = 0 implies that H2 neither binds too weakly nor too strongly for an ideal catalyst and yields higher HER activity.66Fig. 18b1 shows the Volmer reaction step in alkaline medium followed by either a Heyrovsky (Fig. 18b2) or a Tafel reaction (Fig. 18b3). A variety of materials have been studied as a catalyst for the HER. To date, platinum (Pt) has been used as the electrocatalyst electrode and shows the best HER performance owing to its low overpotential, low Tafel slope, and a high number of catalytically active sites for electron transfer efficiency. However, Pt is exceedingly expensive and is relatively scarce among the other precious noble metals. Indeed, an ideal electrode for the catalytic HER should exhibit a low reaction overpotential and lower Tafel slope (for example, the standard Pt/C electrode in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and basic (1.0 M KOH) electrolytes shows a Tafel slope of ∼30 mV dec−1 and 30–65 mV dec−1, respectively).102,157,158 Interestingly, MoS2 nanosheets, particularly in their metallic form (1T), exhibits excellent HER activities. The working mechanism of MoS2 as an electrocatalyst for the HER can be understood by the energetics of the reactions, rate limiting steps and the effect of different planes of MoS2 on the HER. First principles studies of the HER activity of 2H-MoS2 shows that, based on the reaction energy barrier for the Volmer reaction, various planes of 2H-MoS2 follow the order: MoS2 (103) > MoS2 (100)-Mo > MoS2 (100)-S > MoS2 (002).159 On the basal plane i.e. MoS2 (002), the Tafel reaction needs to overcome a high energy barrier as compared to the Heyrovsky reaction, which implies that the Volmer–Heyrovsky process is the main pathway of the HER on the basal plane of MoS2. However, both Tafel and Heyrovsky processes are kinetically and thermodynamically more favourable at the MoS2 edges instead of the basal plane.
A first principles study of the HER on 1T-MoS2 shows that the HER mechanism is most likely to occur at a surface H2 coverage of 12.5 to 25% due to the very fast Volmer step (activation energy ≈ 0.16 eV), whereas for the H2 desorption process, the Heyrovsky process (0.62 eV) has a much lower reaction barrier than the Tafel process (1.07 eV). Hence, the Volmer–Heyrovsky process is more favourable for the HER activity of the 1T-MoS2 basal plane.160
1T-MoS2 was first used as an electrocatalyst for water splitting by Lukowski et al. by synthesizing a flower-like MoS2 nanostructure via chemical exfoliation followed by phase transition from 2H to 1T via lithium (Li) intercalation.155 The report suggested that the electrocatalytic performance of MoS2 can be enhanced significantly by controlling nanostructures and structural polymorphs using various phase transition techniques such as chemical exfoliation or plasmonic hot-electron doping. The 1T-MoS2 polymorph exhibited a low Tafel slope of ∼43 mV dec−1 and low overpotential of −187 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2, suggesting outstanding catalytic activities of 1T MoS2 towards the HER. Similarly, Voiry et al. reported 1T-MoS2 from bulk MoS2 powder by using LiBH4 as an intercalant and showed that the HER activity significantly enhanced compared to 2H-MoS2 with a low overpotential of 100 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1.175 The significant reduction in the overpotential and Tafel slope indicated efficient HER activity attributed to the population of conduction band electrons of MoS2. They enhanced the interlayer spacing by introducing alkali metal intercalants into the MoS2 lattice. The interlayer spacing has a great impact on the HER performance of MoS2. It is already been established that MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing realizes enhanced HER activity.161,162
Kang et al. reported a localized phase transition in monolayer MoS2 with the help of plasmonic hot electrons and local sliding of the upper S plane due to stress and interaction between Au and MoS2.56Fig. 19 shows the HER performance of 1T MoS2 obtained by hot electron induced phase transition from 2H MoS2 using Au NPs. Using laser excitation, the measured onset potential of the reaction has been decreased by 0.5 V vs. RHE as compared to the onset potential under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 19a.89 Also, it was reported that the current density of the HER was increased by 50 × 10−3 mA cm−2 under the laser excitation and reached the highest current density of 125 × 10−3 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. HER input potential due to the phase transformation in MoS2.89 To further investigate the HER activity of 1T-MoS2, the Tafel slope was calculated and it was found that the Tafel slope decreased from 175 mV dec−1 in the dark to 170 mV dec−1 under 532 nm laser excitation. Additionally, the Tafel slope was further reduced to 155 mV dec−1 when the incident laser power was increased from 532 nm to 690 nm. The resonance excitation wavelength of Ag@Au nanorattles and MoS2 is 690 nm and 532 nm, respectively (Fig. 19b). The reported photocatalytic enhancement was attributed to the phase transition from 2H to 1T by plasmonic hot electrons and induced stress by nanoparticles. The Raman spectrum (Fig. 19c) of the MoS2 monolayer shows a blue shift for both the in-plane and out-plane vibrations and additional characteristic peaks, which suggest that phase transition has occurred by plasmonic doping. The inset of Fig. 19c shows the comparative Raman spectra of the 2H and 1T phases of 2D-MoS2. Fig. 19d shows the polarization curve for increasing laser power, and Fig. 19e shows the corresponding onset potential and current density at −0.5 V vs. RHE. From Fig. 19d and e, it can be seen that with increases in the laser power from 5 to 25 mW, a decrease in the onset potential occurred, which is an indication of the reduction of the barrier for the hydrogen reduction reaction.89 Meanwhile the current density increases due to a more significant number of hot electrons generated with high laser power. Similarly, Fig. 19f shows the polarization curve, and Fig. 19g shows the corresponding onset potential and current density with different reaction cycles (i.e., with each round of laser illumination) as a function of power varying from 0 to 25 mW. It was found that the onset potential decreases even after three reaction cycles, while significant hydrogen evolution (current density enhances from ∼25 × 10−3 mA cm−2 to ∼116 × 10−3 mA cm−2) was achieved after three rounds of laser illumination.89Fig. 19h shows the comparative rate of H2 production concerning time under 690 nm laser illumination and in the dark. The amount of H2 and O2 gasses evolved during the HER at an incident laser power of 25 mW as a function of time is shown in Fig. 19i.89

Li et al. demonstrated a TNTs@MoS2 core–shell heterostructure synthesis technique by a two-step anodic oxidation process. They reported a significant enhancement in the photocatalytic activities for water splitting and enhanced photocurrent of the TNTs@MoS2 electrode as compared with bare TiO2 nanotubes. The photocurrent increases from 2 × 10−4 A cm−2 to ≈2.8 × 10−4 A cm−2 upon excitation with a 532 nm laser.163 Y. Shi et al.113 fabricated MoS2 nanosheets by chemical exfoliation and then decorated them with Au nanorods for the electrocatalysis of water on a MoS2 nanosheet for the HER. As shown in Fig. 20a, Au–MoS2 exhibited the lowest onset potential of −0.22 V (vs. RHE), while the as-prepared ce-MoS2 showed a comparatively higher onset potential of −0.28 V (vs. RHE). In addition, a reduction of 0.16 V was found in the onset potential when Au–MoS2 is illuminated with an 808 nm laser. The current–time (I–t) curve of the as-prepared Au–MoS2 at −0.23 V is shown in Fig. 20b with and without laser excitation, which simply depicts that the increased laser response current is higher in Au–MoS2 as compared to pristine MoS2. This increased response of Au–MoS2 can be attributed to the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance effect of the Au nanorods by hot electron injection into 2D MoS2 layers. For a better understanding of the HER activity of the catalyst, Tafel plots were presented as shown in Fig. 20c. Au–MoS2 shows a minimum Tafel slope of ∼71 mV dec−1, while pristine MoS2 shows a Tafel slope of ∼94 mV dec−1. The activation energy at zero potential also decreases from 94.82 kJ mol−1 to 75.65 kJ mol−1 for Au–MoS2 compared to the pristine MoS2 monolayer, as shown in Fig. 20d.

In another study, Seo et al. manifested that Ag NPs also induce plasmon-based phase transformation in vertically grown 2D-MoS2 on ITO/graphene (G/MoS2), while improving the photoelectrochemical activity of the 2D nanosheet.164 Raman data showed that redshifts occurred in both in-plane and out-of-plane peaks owing to the plasmon-induced phase transition in MoS2 due to the stiffening of A1g and E12g peaks, as shown in Fig. 21a. Compared with G/MoS2, Ag deposited G/MoS2 showed more vigorous absorption intensity, as illustrated in Fig. 21b. The enhanced absorption was further attributed to the strong coupling between excitons and the surface plasmons of Ag nanoparticles with 2D-MoS2.164Fig. 21c shows that the Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL) study illustrated a longer lifetime (from 3.1 ns to 3.8 ns) of charge carriers for Ag decorated G/MoS2 as compared to G/MoS2 as a function of increasing Ag-layer thickness.164 The Nyquist plot of Ag/G/MoS2 showed maximum Rct(dark)/Rct(photo) for 4 nm thickness of Ag, which suggests the practical assistance of carrier charge transfer from Ag NPs to MoS2 layers as depicted in Fig. 21d.164 The enhanced Rct(dark)/Rct(photo) ratio was attributed to the SPR enhanced photogeneration and transfer rate of charge carriers. Similarly, Au–MoS2 hybrid nanoflower structures for hydrogen evolution catalysis were also found enhanced with a reduced overpotential and Tafel slope as reported by the Ziv et al. research group from Israel. It was found that the overpotential decreased from 420 mV for pristine MoS2 nano-flowers to 164 mV for Au@MoS2 nanoflowers and the corresponding Tafel slope decreased from 145 mV dec−1 to 50 mV dec−1 demonstrating the enhancement of the HER activities of the plasmon-enhanced nanostructures towards the HER (Table 3).165

Zhang et al. demonstrated a hot electron-driven HER, where anisotropic Au NPs were used as plasmonic nanoparticles on 2D 2H-MoS2. Fig. 22 illustrates the plasmonic gold nanoparticle decorated MoS2 monolayer that exhibited enhanced optical properties, structural integrity, and HER activity compared to a pristine MoS2 nanosheet. Fig. 22a, b and c show the TEM images of various Au nanostructures, i.e., Au nanospheres (Au-NS), Au nanorods (Au-NR), and Au nano-triangles (Au-NT), respectively, and the normalized UV-vis-NIR extinction spectra of pristine MoS2 and various Au nanostructures (Fig. 22d). Higher absorption from Au decorated MoS2 can be obtained as compared to the weak absorption of pristine MoS2. The normalized extinction spectra of various Au nanostructures, along with the apparent quantum efficiency, are shown in Fig. 22e.

8. Summary
In summary, 2D layered materials such as graphene and TMDs are potential energy conversion and storage candidates. 2D-MoS2, the most studied material of the TMD family, possesses unique structural and electronic properties such as a layered structure, relatively low cost, earth abundance, large in-plane charge transfer (>200 cm2 V−1 s−1), high catalytic activity, efficient interfacial charge transfer, good stability, and relatively low energy barrier that are associated with hydrogen adsorption and desorption. This review introduces the structural features of various polymorphs of MoS2, i.e., 1H, 2H, 1T, and 3R-MoS2. It has been observed that based on the atomic arrangement of layered MoS2, the optical and electronic properties of MoS2 change, such as 2H-MoS2 showing semiconducting properties, while 1T-MoS2 shows metallic properties. Different synthesis techniques such as mechanical exfoliation, chemical exfoliation, hydrothermal, and chemical vapor deposition are discussed in brief. Being metallic, 1T-MoS2 shows higher electronic conductivity, excellent stability in water, hydrophilicity, expanded interlayer spacing, enhanced active catalytic sites, and superior catalytic activity for the HER as compared to its 2H counterpart. Various 2H to 1T phase transition techniques include alkali metal intercalation, introducing sulfur vacancies, microwave plasma treatment, strain engineering, and plasmonic hot electron induced phase transition.
Among all the phase transition techniques, plasmonic hot electron induced 2H to 1T phase transition is a critical, however, least explored technique. This review aims to highlight the advantages and limitations of this unique technique concerning the HER. Here we have investigated the fundamental mechanism of hot electron generation at the metal–semiconductor interface and subsequent transfer of the hot electron in the conduction band of MoS2 to facilitate the HER activity. This paper briefly discusses the effect of the Schottky barrier height and Fermi level pining on hot electron transfer and hot carrier recombination. We have also outlined very comprehensive and most recent advances in the progress of the plasmonic hot electron induced phase transition technique of MoS2 and its application in the HER, which is very critically helpful to do further research in this field. It has been observed that the HER performance of 1T-MoS2 enhanced as compared to 2H-MoS2.
9. Outlooks and challenges
It is evident from recent research publications that the development of 2D atomically thin layered materials, such as graphene and TMDs, has stimulated a promising path for energy conversion and storage.16,166–173 Atomically thin 2D layered TMD materials have emerged with fascinating applications related to both scientific interpretations and technical perceptions. In particular, 2D-MoS2 is probably one of the highest studied layered materials compared to other layered TMDs due to its feasible band gap, high electron mobility, rapid semiconducting to metallic phase transformations, and higher rate of charge transfer, high electrocatalytic activity, and stability. Recently, for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2, several approaches have been introduced and demonstrated. In this regard, plasmonic hot-electron induced semiconducting (2H) to metallic (1T) phase transformation in MoS2 showed impressive performance in catalysis, energy conversion and storage, photoluminescence, photo-chemistry, photo-electrochemistry, and bio-sensing. Although plasmonic nanoparticle-induced phase transformation in MoS2 looks extraordinarily promising for improving electrocatalytic activity, a few key challenges persist for further developments as follows.
The semiconducting 2H-phase of MoS2 is the most stable phase, while the metallic 1T-phase is the most unstable. Using hot-electron injection in 2D-MoS2 nanosheets via plasmonic nanoparticles could lead to localized phase transformation occurring with low phase stability. For example, the metallic 1T-MoS2 phase is a metastable phase with a relaxation energy of ≈1.0 eV, and therefore can be easily converted into semiconducting 2H-MoS2, even without the influence of other external parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, etc.). Thus, it is crucial to understand the mechanism of phase stability, which could result in producing a more stable 1T phase of MoS2 and decelerate the reversible phase transformation towards the 2H-phase of MoS2. Essentially the mechanism of the hot-electron induced interfacial electron transfer process through 2D-MoS2 is still unclear and needs to be understood by designing experimental techniques and theoretical modeling.
Typically, various noble metal nanostructures have been used as plasmonic nanomaterials, which generate plasmonic hot electrons under the exposure of light followed by the insertion of hot electrons in the MoS2 nanosheets for 2H to 1T phase transformation. Controlling surface plasmonic electrons of those noble-metal nanostructures depends on the surface structures, morphologies, shape and size, defects, and electronic structures, including electronic surface-charge states, band structures, etc. In this context, the interfacial structure between noble metals and 2D-MoS2 significantly influences the charge transfer kinetics for a rapid phase-transformation process. Since the morphology of the nanostructures typically determines the contact area of the interface, the shapes of the nanostructures are fundamental to enable an efficient hot-electron transfer process. On the other hand, the shape, size, and surface charge concentration of metallic nanostructures could also lead to heterojunction formation, which could also lead to an efficient charge injection process and excellent stability.168,169 Similarly, surface defects in noble-metal nanostructures and surface defects in 2D-MoS2 primarily create charge-trap states, which could further hinder the localized charge-transfer process, thereby, could further prevent the phase transformation process.
The coverage of plasmonic nanoparticles on the MoS2 surface also plays a significant role in localized phase transformation in 2D-MoS2. The appropriate concentration and homogeneous distribution of nanostructures on MoS2 could significantly improve the phase transformation followed by the enhancement in catalytic activities for the HER. The homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles could further demand the proper design of plasmonic nanostructures decorated with 2D-MoS2 architectures for interpreting the desired amount of stable phase transformation and efficient electrocatalytic activity.
Generally, the use of noble metals as plasmonic nanostructures has several drawbacks, such as noble metals are rare, costly, and typically not earth-abundant. Also, noble-metal nanostructures can easily be corroded in an acidic medium; hence, they exhibit low longevity/reliability compared to metal-oxide, metal-carbide, and metal-nitride-based other plasmonic nanostructures. In this regard, new types of other plasmonic (non-noble metal-based) nanostructures (e.g., transition metal nitride, transition metal carbides, TiO2, TiN, etc.) need to be investigated accompanied by their hot-electron injection mechanisms. It is required to identify the best low-loss plasmonic materials where most of the noble metals dominate other compound materials (i.e., oxides, carbides, and nitrides) in terms of their quality factors in LSPR and SPP applications in the visible and NIR ranges. For example, transition metal nitrides and transition metal carbides in the form of the MXene phase could also have the potential for photoelectric or photothermal applications, although these materials are yet to be studied in this context. Again, introducing earth-abundant plasmonic nanostructures could solve some of the predominating issues with noble-metal-based nanostructures. However, a detailed study is required to understand the plasmonic behavior of such new types of nanomaterials, their hot-electron transferring mechanisms to 2D-MoS2 while improving the electrocatalytic activity towards the HER.
It is obvious that there is still a knowledge gap in the theoretical and experimental analysis of hot-electron induced phase transformation in 2D-MoS2. Subsequent theoretical modeling and simulation studies could also pave pathways to address those ongoing issues by selecting suitable nanostructured materials and designing the architectures. Extensive studies related to calculating the electronic and dielectric parameters of various plasmonic nanostructures/2D-MoS2 interfaces via density functional theory (DFT) calculations need to be enforced, and the DFT results are necessary for obtaining feasible understanding of the interfacial hot-electron transfer process mechanism in 2D-MoS2 whose experimental data are already available. Furthermore, the plasmonic properties of newly derived (non-noble metal) other nanostructures (e.g., transition metal oxides, carbides, and nitrides) need to be estimated by performing theoretical DFT simulations to determine their competence in MoS2 phase transformation as well as their HER activities. Also, the evaluation of the HER catalysis properties of 2H to 1T MoS2via DFT needs to be performed, while other optical properties of transition metal carbides and nitrides need to be figured out to manifest their usability towards localized phase transformation.
Overall, the recent advancements in plasmonic hot-electron induced phase transformation in 2D-MoS2 have seemingly demonstrated the immense potential of that field towards efficient hydrogen evolution reactions. Although some knowledge gaps persist, it is imperative to develop a profound understanding of the hot carrier excitation, injection, and induced-phase transformation in 2D-MoS2 and its mechanisms using gradual experimentation and theoretical analysis. Thus, finding out more suitable and high-performance new types of low-cost, earth-abundant plasmonic materials is inevitable in this context. Last but not least, some broadened and related areas also need to be explored, such as (1) activating the major active catalytic sites of MoS2 for the HER via new types of plasmonic nanostructures for expansive plasmonic resonance; (2) exploring other atomically thin 2D layered TMDs with potential to transform their semiconductor phase to a metallic phase; (3) interfacial engineering for efficient plasmon-induced processes in solar energy conversion, storage, heterogeneous catalysis, etc.; (4) widening the horizon on light–matter interaction in 2D materials. Finally, with the accelerated advancements in nanophotonics and nanoelectronics, it is unambiguous that there will not be unique plasmonic materials, which will be promising for every application at all spectral frequencies. Instead, some versatility and the combinations of materials must be introduced with calibrated and optimized applications with stable phase-transformation capabilities in 2D-MoS2. We believe that this comprehensive review will lead the way towards the advancement in perceptions, which will further accelerate the theoretical understandings and experimental surge, thereby opening up tremendous new possibilities in this field of research.
