    , Accepted 2nd October 2017First published on 6th October 2017AbstractPhotochemical vapor generation (PVG) is the newest subset of widely used vapor generation techniques to be coupled to atomic and mass spectrometries to provide enhanced analyte introduction efficiency. Improved detection power, minimization of potential spectral interferences and the promise of green chemistry serve as additional drivers. PVG has been successfully applied to the conventional suite of elements typically amenable to chemical vapor generation, such as As, Sb, Sn, Bi, Se, Te, Hg and Pb, as well as transition metals (Cd, Fe, Co, Ni and Os) and non-metals (I and Br). This tutorial provides an overview of developments and applications since its inception in 2003, including consideration of needed hardware (UV photochemical reactor and phase separator designs), reaction mechanisms and products, interferences, as well as benefits and short-comings. While significant advances have been made over the past decade in expanding the scope of elements amenable to PVG, the way forward demands elucidation of reaction mechanisms to support optimization, enhance prediction power and provide comprehension and control of potential interferences. In this connection, speculations on ultimate limitations, needed developments and future outlook are also presented. More applications to real-world samples are needed to sustain interest in the field and elicit further investment of research.
Introduction
Trace element analysis invokes many definitions, from simplistic statements of determination of analytes in the range below 1 mg kg−1 to more broadly framed concerns encompassing consideration of analyte levels which are sufficiently low that the sample requires special handling, the matrix effects are substantial, the analyte signal-to-noise response (S/N) is small with the available measurement technique, or the amount of sample available is very limited.1 Increasing demands for higher throughput, improved data quality and enhanced detection power have resulted in laboratories embracing a preferential use of the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) as both an excitation (ICP-OES) and ionization (ICP-MS) source for quantitation of inorganic trace elemental and speciated mass fractions because of its wide (multi-)element capability, relative robustness, wide dynamic range, precision and generally simple, yet diverse, sample introduction systems. Nevertheless, with the exception of direct sample insertion techniques,2 the ICP requires sample introduction either via aerosolization, wherein test specimens must be converted to (a) an aerosol of fine solid particles (achieved with arc/spark and laser ablation of materials in addition to electrothermal vaporization of solids/slurries and dried liquids); (b) an aerosol of fine liquid droplets (via thermospray, ultrasonic and pneumatic solution nebulization systems), or a vapor (gas chromatographic effluents and volatile metal species synthesized using derivatization techniques).3–8 Despite solution nebulization being the most popular means of sample introduction, numerous studies have addressed its limitations – the resultant aerosol properties influence the thermal characteristics of the plasma, impacting sensitivity, precision, LOD and the extent of interference effects.3–8 Apart from post aerosolization processing, such as the use of heated spray chambers,9 pre-evaporation tubes,10 cryogenic and membrane desolvation systems,11 low-flow nebulizers to limit plasma loading (typically <20–30 mg min−1 of water vapor)3,4,8,12 or reliance on the torch integrated sample introduction system (TISIS),13 augmenting the performance of typical nebulizer/spray chamber systems is thwarted by the characteristically inverse relationship between the flux of analyte atoms entering the sample delivery system and its efficiency of transfer to the plasma as sample uptake rate increases.7,8 Thus, attempts to augment S/N by increasing sample flux are met with diminishing returns due to enhanced aerosol density, increased droplet aggregation and loading effects in the spray chamber and plasma.7,14 Keeping in mind that the goals of sample introduction are the reproducible transfer of a representative portion of sample material to the atomizer cell with high efficiency and no adverse interference effects,6 Bings et al.4 concluded that the ideal sample for the ICP would be in a gaseous form.
Expectedly, coupling analyte derivatization or vapor generation (VG) techniques to atomic spectroscopy sources provides a potential solution to this conundrum. Vapor generation may be defined as a process whereby volatile or semi-volatile analyte species are (physico-chemically) synthesized from non-volatile precursors (usually ionic or organometallic) to permit their subsequent transfer from a condensed phase to the gas phase. With high efficiency vapor generators, sample flow rates (i.e., analyte flux) can be substantially increased without perturbing generation efficiency. In principle, a VG manifold operating at 100% derivatization efficiency with a sample flow of 5 mL min−1 could deliver a 125–250-fold greater flux of analyte to the plasma than a standard concentric nebulizer/cyclonic spray chamber system operating at 1 mL min−1 achieving 2–4% efficiency, or a 166-fold enhanced flux compared to operating a TISIS coupled with a 30 μL min−1 sample flow. As such, it is clear that corresponding relative detection limits can be substantially improved over solution nebulization (SN) techniques.15
Apart from the obvious benefits that accrue from the above simple considerations, use of VG offers further advantages, as summarized in Table 1, foremost of which is that the target analyte can be selectively separated from the matrix, which does not enter the source and hence does not contribute to potential physico-chemical matrix or spectral interferences. Admittedly, on balance, there are drawbacks to VG. Although the limited range of applicability, compatibility with specific matrices, species specific response and need for often potentially expensive and unstable reagents preclude widespread use, niche applications exist wherein its beneficial features have been exploited to optimal advantage.16

Over the course of some 50 years of development (following the classic application by Holak describing quantitation of As by generation of AsH3 (ref. 17)), the scope of analytical VG has continually advanced and now comprises chemical, electrochemical, sonochemical, thermochemical, photochemical and plasma mediated technologies. Many of these techniques have been relatively recently reviewed,16,18–26 and almost all have been coupled to emission, absorption, fluorescence and mass spectrometry detection platforms. By far, approaches to chemical vapor generation (CVG) are the most diverse, and include halide (As, Si), oxide (Os, Re, Ru), carbonyl (Fe, Ni, Co), cold vapor generation (Hg, Cd), volatile chelate formation (Cr, Be, Co, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Al, Ni, Mn, Yb, La, Eu and Y), oxidation (halogens) and alkylation reactions (with Grignard reagents, alkyl- and arylborates), as well as hydride generation (HG) for elements such as As, Sb, Bi, Se, Te, Ge, Sn and Pb. The latter technique remains the most popular and in recent years has expanded to encompass transition and noble metals (Ag, Au, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pd and Pt), although with relatively poor generation efficiencies and incomplete understanding of the nature of the resultant species.27,28
This tutorial review focusses on photochemical vapor generation (PVG). PVG has been successfully demonstrated with the conventional suite of elements typically amenable to chemical vapor generation, (As, Sb, Sn, Bi, Se, Te, Hg and Pb), as well as transition metals (Cd, Fe, Co, Ni and Os) and non-metals (I and Br). An overview of developments and applications of PVG since its inception in 2003,29,30 including consideration of photochemical reactor design, reaction mechanisms and products, interferences, as well as benefits, short comings and possible future directions is presented. As PVG shares some common ground with plasma mediated vapor generation techniques, this subject will also be briefly examined.31
Photochemical oxidation and reduction
Photochemistry encompasses chemical reactions that proceed under the influence of visible and/or ultraviolet light and the first law of photochemistry states that light must be absorbed by a compound in order for a photochemical reaction to occur. The rates of photochemical reactions are generally characterized by low apparent activation energies (a few kcal mol−1, which often reflect the temperature dependence of secondary thermal reactions), but respond directly to the incident photon flux.
Photolytic and photocatalytic processes induced by UV irradiation have enjoyed a lengthy and widespread dichotomy of use in analytical chemistry.26,32,33 On the one hand, photo-oxidation of matrices for the destruction of organic matter by generated ˙OH radicals (typically), sometimes augmented by addition of S2O82−, H2O2, Fenton reagent or O3, serve as the basis for many advanced oxidation processes in homogeneous systems while use of semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, CdS) gives rise to heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidations; destruction of organometallic species prior to quantitation is also well-served by such clean approaches to oxidation.
By contrast, photoreduction of toxic metals for water remediation and nanoparticle synthesis has been pursued for many years and touted for its industrial applications. In the natural environment, photo-mediated generation of volatile species from metal, metalloid and non-metallic elements occurs as solar radiation induces abiotic reduction and alkylation reactions in both the aquatic environment and troposphere, influencing the biogeochemical cycling of elements such as Hg, Br, I and S [e.g., ref. 34].
UV radiation comprises wavelengths between 100 and 400 nm, classified as UV-A (400–315 nm), UV-B (315–280 nm) and UV-C (280–100 nm). In the UV-C spectral region, sufficient photon energy is available for homolytic cleavage of C–C and many other bonds (e.g., 250 nm ∼ 540 kJ mol−1), as well as initiating mesolytic bond cleavage to yield radical-based reactions that lead to highly reducing environments in solutions containing low molecular weight carboxylic acids, alcohols and aldehydes.35,36 Amongst reactive species are the highly reducing ˙H, ˙R, hydrated electron [e(aq)−], CO and carboxyl [˙CO2−] radicals.35,37–40 Irradiation in the 200–100 nm range typically occurs under vacuum or purged conditions due to strong molecular absorption by atmospheric components and thus applications involving UV-C are fewer. However, proper design of the UV source itself has recently made the deeper UV-C region a convenient and readily accessible laboratory tool with which to pursue PVG.41,42
The first demonstration of photo-reduction of an aquo-ion to a volatile hydride was described by Kikuchi and Sakamoto43 in 2000; photocatalytic conversion of SeO42− to SeH2 occurred in the presence of TiO2 in a dilute solution of formic acid. The ramifications of this observation were soon realized by Guo et al.29,30 and served to launch the field of PVG for trace element analysis in 2003. Utilizing chemistry based on homogeneous photo-reduction, SeCO, SeH2, (CH3)2Se and (CH3CH2)2Se were generated in the presence of different low molecular weight (LMW) organic acids. The reaction products, formed in high yield following exposure to a UV-C low pressure mercury discharge lamp, were conveniently directed to atomic spectrometry sources for quantitation, enhancing sample introduction efficiency in a manner equivalent to classical CVG undertaken with tetrahydroborate reductant while suffering significantly fewer interferences from concomitant transition metals.
Over the past decade, a considerable number of PVG studies encompassing many additional elements (transition metals, halogens and semi-metals) have appeared but, despite substantial interest, the field of PVG remains in its infancy. As noted, photo-reduction processes can be implemented in a manner similar to CVG, not only for direct analysis, but with hyphenated techniques such as HPLC combined with post-column derivatization to provide speciation information as well. Uncharacteristically, reviews of this embryonic field began to appear only a short time after its inception,18,20,22,23,44 largely supported by inadequate information due to a limited applications base. More recently, and following publication of a considerably larger number of PVG studies, a more balanced outlook has surfaced,45i.e., “… research in this area suggests that PVG is a highly efficient method of vapor generation for certain analytes, though matrix effects have yet to be fully evaluated to test the analytical utility of the technique for real samples”.
Photochemical vapor generation
PVG confers a somewhat unique set of advantages in comparison to conventional CVG, as summarized in Table 2. Foremost amongst these are the elimination of the need for fresh and often expensive and unstable reductants, conferring some degree of green chemistry (i.e., the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the generation of hazardous substances) to the approach, the ability to premix reagents with samples and simplify hardware requirements, such as flow injection manifolds, as well as its broader range of application. On the other hand, because of its different mechanism of action, a new set of interferences arises from the presence of oxidants in the sample, as opposed to concomitant trace metals, which are deleterious to many CVG applications. These subjects will be discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.

Analytical applications of PVG essentially require suitable laboratory hardware as well as a sample composition and reaction medium conducive to achieving efficient radical-driven reduction reactions which selectively target the analyte species.

PVG hardware. 
The simplest embodiment of a generic PVG laboratory system is presented in Fig. 1. The basic principle of PVG for analytical application relies on generation of reducing radicals in aqueous solutions of samples dosed with LMW carboxylic acids (typically formic, acetic or propionic) by exposure to (primarily) UV-C sources. Although not widely used, alcohols and aldehydes have also exhibited some efficacy, at least for reduction of mercury.36 An efficient phase separator serves to transfer the reaction products (volatile analyte species, CO, CO2, H2, CH4)46 from the sample solution to an appropriate source for detection using a flow of Ar or He.
 Fig. 1  Implementation of generic PVG system. 
The major hardware components of a PVG system include the photo-reactor (typically comprising a UV-C source and a means of exposing the sample to this irradiation) and the gas–liquid phase separator (GLS) which, in addition to the composition of the irradiated sample solution, account for all parameters impacting the efficiency of analyte derivatization. In general, design considerations and analysis of system performance should be based on the aspiration of providing the largest flux of analyte possible to the detector. Thus, when comparing sample introduction efficiency for PVG with that for solution nebulization, account must be taken of the impact of sample delivery rate on both the derivatization and phase separation efficiencies. High sample flow rates, providing delivery of the greatest flux of analyte, can be limited by the photo-kinetics of the reactions involved as well as the speed of phase separation of the products from the liquid phase. Since the photo-efficiency is dictated by the absorption coefficients of active components of the sample, the spectral quality of the source, relevant photon flux and irradiation time available with a given photo-reactor, whereas phase separation efficiency is governed by hydrophobicity of the analyte species, its diffusion length across the liquid phase (i.e., thin or thick film) and the concentration gradient across the gas–liquid boundary, it is evident that constraints arise as to how rapidly samples can be propelled through the PVG system. Several important design considerations thus need to be accounted for.
Continuous sample processing in flowing systems is by far the most efficient and frequently employed for PVG as heating of the sample is minimized during irradiation and thin-film conditions can be readily achieved for both irradiation and analyte phase separation.47,48 As the absorption coefficient for liquid water lies in the range 103–105 cm−1 at <170 nm, photon penetration depth is on the order of 1 mm at 185 nm,31 typically much shorter in aqueous solutions of carboxylic acids where complete attenuation can occur across a 1 cm layer. Moreover, flow injection processing of samples can be conveniently combined with stopped-flow conditions to increase the time available for exposure of the sample to the UV field.48,49 Analyte reduction/derivatization is less efficient with batch reactors, despite being well-stirred, not only due to the latter effect, but as well to the typically compromised ability to achieve rapid and efficient gas–liquid separation in such systems. Long exposure times needed to achieve good yields for some elements in batch systems give rise to increased probability of simultaneous photolytic decomposition of analyte species, in direct competition with photo-formation.41,48,50–52 As a consequence, even in flow systems, an optimal UV irradiation time is generally encountered. Although thin-walled PFA (perfluoroalkoxy) and FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) tubing is preferred conduit for sample and gas transport due to its robustness and flexibility, the sample suffers significantly diminished photon flux (intensity) as a result of the lower UV-C transmission of these materials compared to quartz (particularly synthetic quartz, needed to efficiently access the vacuum UV region, i.e., 185 nm).
Although high pressure mercury discharge lamps have been used to irradiate samples,53 these sources typically require forced air or water cooling and are comparatively inefficient in that they emit predominantly a continuous spectrum with superposed mercury emission lines, tending to heat the sample more efficiently than photolysing it, and are efficacious only as a consequence of their high power levels. The preferred design of photo-reactor comprises a low pressure discharge lamp dominated by the characteristic line spectrum of mercury. Typically, and for convenience of use, a natural quartz envelope shrouds the lamp, preventing ozone formation but limiting the output spectrum to the major emission lines at 253.7, 313.2, 365.0, 404.7, 435.8, 546.1, 577.0 and 579.1 nm while suppressing the intense 184.9 nm deep UV transition. Low power mercury discharge lamps are available from many suppliers with power ratings ranging from a few W (e.g., Analamp, available from BHK Inc.) to several 10's W (e.g., available from Cole Parmer) output, taking the form of spectroscopic alignment pen lamps and inexpensive germicidal lamps, respectively. These sources are convenient in that the sample solution can be readily irradiated as it flows through quartz or PFA·FEP tubing placed in close proximity to the exterior lamp envelope. Additional flexibility is available in that the length and inside diameter of such conduits can be user selected and, in concert with the flow rate of the sample, readily used to vary the irradiation or residence time of exposure of the sample to the UV source. Moreover, as noted above, the use of a thin film of sample exposed to the UV field serves to mitigate the effects of extraneous absorption of source intensity as it penetrates the liquid medium, thereby delivering the UV intensity with high efficiency and minimizing the need for enhanced irradiation time for the processing of colored (highly absorbing) samples.47
Three further photo-reactor designs have found application for PVG, these being: a combined GLS and UV source comprising a pen lamp discharge mounted along the vertical axis of a cyclonic spray chamber to permit irradiation of the aerosol arising from a pneumatically nebulized sample;54 a commercial high-intensity, thin-film synthetic quartz flow-through photo-reactor that permits ready access to the 184.9 nm line without ozone generation;42 and deep UV (240–260 nm), low power (mW) LEDs.55,56 Performance comparisons of different designs of photo-reactors and sources have been made.51,54–58
Rapid removal of the volatile analyte species from the irradiated solution constitutes an additional critical step since, as noted above, decomposition and resolubilization of the generated analyte species may occur. Clearly, the combination of UV source and spray chamber permitting irradiation of an aerosolized form of the sample54 provides for both the thinnest film of liquid (i.e., μm-sized droplets) to be irradiated with highest efficiency, as well as the most effective means of phase separation since the vapor diffusion process rapidly occurs across a very thin liquid film and is further enhanced by the high phase concentration gradient arising from the flow of nebulizer gas (Henry's law). The shortcoming of this design is the limiting and relatively short irradiation time (a few s for a 30–50 mL spray chamber supplied with a 1 L min−1 flow of Ar), necessitating fast photochemical kinetics, as well as a limitation on the supply flux of sample if aerosolization is to be supported. Some advantage can be taken of a nebulizer/spray chamber for fast phase separation by feeding the photolysed sample from a conventional reactor directly to a nebulizer.59 This arrangement eliminates the aforementioned problem of short UV residence time, but does limit the analyte flux to the detector due to the need to support aerosolization at relatively low flow rates. It is also noteworthy that use of nebulization systems and spray chambers negates one of the potentially major benefits of PVG/CVG, that the sample matrix is not introduced into the detection system. Apart from this unique system, both passive and active GLS designs have been employed.48 Passive GLS relies on a flow of a thin-film of the irradiated liquid over a large inert surface in the presence of a counter-current of carrier gas. This approach works well for very hydrophobic analyte vapors but the flow rate of the sample is limited by the rate of phase separation (by diffusion), otherwise the sample solution is expelled to waste before separation can be efficiently completed. This problem is obviated with a GLS based on efficient mechanical sparging of the liquid by the transport gas before it is evacuated to waste and readily accomplished by directing the irradiated sample to/across a fritted disk through which the transport gas is passed, efficiently stripping the analyte from solution. Examples of passive and active GLS units are described in ref. 48.


Sample and generation media. 
In addition to the photo-reactor and GLS hardware, consideration of the chemical composition of the sample solution and added LMW carboxylic acids are significant variables impacting the PVG process. A rather brief review of these concepts is presented here as an in-depth examination is more appropriately reserved for subsequent sections relating to reaction mechanisms and interferences.
As noted earlier, not only has the presence of aldehydes and alcohols36,60,61 been shown capable of inducing PVG of mercury, but even diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC)62 has served as an efficient reductant. Nevertheless, use of LMW carboxylic acids, viz. formic, acetic and propionic, dominates due to their broad efficacy. Addition of these individual acids to the sample in concentrations ranging from 1–50% (v/v) is typical, and in some cases their mixture has proved beneficial,63,64 as has been the addition of photosensitizers, including trace metals63–65 and other reagents.58 Increasing the temperature of the reaction medium has, in some cases, been shown to enhance the yield of volatile analyte,51,56,66 but it is not clear whether this is due to enhanced derivatization efficiency or improved gas–liquid phase separation efficiency.67,68
Apart from the highly-reducing PVG media that accrues in the presence of carboxylic acids, advantage has been taken of simple photolysis of water to provide an oxidizing medium in which high generation efficiency of OsO4 can be achieved,67 although it has also been generated from a solution of 5% HNO3.69
The identification of PVG reaction products, including that of the volatile analytes as well as concomitant oxidation/reduction species, has generally been undertaken by direct GC-MS sampling of the effluent gasses from the photo-reactor or following their cryotrapping.46 Homolytic cleavage of the carboxylic acids used in reaction media yield hydrogen, carboxyl, methyl, ethyl, propyl and carbonyl radicals (ultimately forming H2, CH4, CO, CO2, CH3OH, C2H6) which reduce, hydrogenate, alkylate and carbonylate metal ions to produce reduced, hydrided, alkylated or carbonylated products. Table 3 identifies the principal analyte species generated. It is clear that irradiation of a formic acid medium is capable of giving rise to reduced (Hg0), hydrided and carbonylated species, as commonly found in nature, whereas acetic acid further permits methylation to occur and propionic acid can give rise to ethylated products. It should be noted that when using propionic acid it is possible to generate a significant mixed population of ethyl, methyl and hydrogen radicals such that all alkylated forms of a given element may be present in the PVG products. A similar pattern holds when acetic acid is used. To date, no specific identification of Sn, Sb, Pb, Cu or Os species arising from PVG has been reported; one may speculate that these species are: SnH2, Sn(CH3)2 and Sn(C2H5)2; SbH3 and Sb(CH3)3 and Sb(C2H5)3; PbH4 or Pb(CH3)4 and Pb(C2H5)4, and OsO4. Identification of the unstable species of Cu79 remains beyond the realm of speculation at this time.

A broader suite of elements is amenable to PVG than can be accomplished with hydride generation, as the former also includes those from the latter category.80 Moreover, the high generation yields, summarized in Table 4, lead to significantly enhanced sample introduction efficiencies and improved limits of detection in comparison to solution nebulization, somewhat because sample matrices are not admitted, but more so because the flow rates of sample delivered to the source can readily exceed those amenable to efficient aerosolization with a conventional nebulizer/spray chamber, thereby further enhancing the flux of delivered analyte.

Proposed mechanisms of PVG
A comprehensive approach to a mechanistic interpretation of chemical hydride generation was conceived some 40 years after its first application;21,25 it is possible that this will ultimately be achieved with PVG, if interest in the technique can be sustained. Apart from a single computational model based on photochemical generation of a reactive ketene intermediate (CH2CO) generated in acetic acid,85 there is a general consensus in the literature that PVG is the result of radical reactions initiated by the photolysis of carboxylic acids and ligand-to-metal charge transfer reductions and oxidations, as these are consistent with the majority of experimental data, including the identity of the resultant species and the impact of experimental parameters.46 As noted earlier, the generation of powerful carboxyl radicals [˙CO2−] enables a system containing oxidizing and reducing radicals (˙OH, ˙H and e(aq)−) to be converted into one that is dominated by reduction processes.38,39,86–89 A brief review of the proposed mechanisms of PVG is presented in the following; the reader is referred to original publications for a more in-depth treatment of individual analytes.46
Photolysis of a solution of formic acid yields a complex mixture of reductants: HCOOH ↔ H+ + HCO2−(1) (2) (3) (4) ˙OH + HCO2− → H2O + ˙CO2−(5) (6) H3O+ + e(aq)− → ˙H + H2O(7) ˙H + HCO2− → H2 + ˙CO2−(8) 2HCO˙ → HCHO + CO(9) 2HCO2˙ → HCOOH + CO2(10)
This series of reactions accounts for the various gas phase end products of photolysis, viz. a mixture of H2, CO and CO2. When higher order carboxylic acids such as acetic (R = CH3) and propionic (R′ = C2H5) are used, these give rise to ˙R and ˙R′ radicals, yielding the experimentally observed CH4 and readily accounting for the various volatile analyte species summarized in Table 3. Interestingly, Adams and Hart86 discussed photolysis and radiolysis of aqueous solutions of formic acid over 50 years ago, showing that the yield of CO increased with increasing concentration of HCOOH, elevated temperature, decreased pH and decreasing wavelength, experimental parameters that have all found impact with PVG studies and certainly playing a role in the generation of Ni(CO)4 and Fe(CO)5.66,76,81
Despite many years chronicling studies of transition metal assisted oxidation, decarboxylation and alkyl transfer reactions which occur in solutions of carboxylic acids, the photochemical literature is, unfortunately, essentially devoid of observation/discussion of metal PVG phenomena, as evident in a recent review of the field,35 which is frequently characterized by ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) reactions: M–O2CRn+ → M(n−1)+ + ˙O2CR → ˙R + CO2(11)
Few instances of metal–carbon bond formation have ever been reported, as in the case of a conjectured intermediate of Ni+ (NiCO2) in a solution of irradiated formic acid.90
Sturgeon and Grinberg46 attempted to formulate a comprehensive model for PVG based on reactions (1)–(11), the pH dependent formation of metal carboxylates, LMCT reductions and charge transfer to solvent (CTTS) oxidations (for the halogens).91 As noted earlier, the first law of photochemistry dictates that photons must be absorbed by a compound in order for a photochemical reaction to arise; reactions are similar whether they occur in the liquid or vapor phase. The rates of photochemical reactions are generally characterized by low apparent activation energies (a few kcal mol−1, which often reflect the temperature dependence of secondary thermal reactions). The UV absorption spectra of dilute solutions of formic and acetic acids show significant absorption of radiation corresponding to π–π* transitions below 250 nm. It may be relevant that absorption by formic acid occurs to a greater degree at 254 nm than does acetic acid,46 as this may account for the favorable increase in PVG yields of several analytes when a mixture of these acids is used as the generation medium as opposed to only acetic acid.63,64 In this regard, formic acid may serve as a “sensitizer” for the reaction. A further example of this is the differing LMCT bands exhibited by Fe(III) carboxylate complexes in either acetic or formic acids,46 with the former showing more intense absorption at longer wavelengths, but with both having many transitions which fully overlap the emission lines from low pressure Hg photo-reactor sources.
As an example, Baxendale and Bridge92 investigated the photoreduction of ferric compounds in 3% formic acid and reported optimal quantum yield in the narrow pH range 2–3.5. Interestingly, this also exactly corresponds with optimal pH for PVG yield of Fe(CO)5.81 A proposed LMCT reduction: (12)may constitute the beginning of a cascade of subsequent reductions: (13)ultimately leading to the formation of Fe0 and successive attack by CO in the reaction medium to generate volatile Fe(CO)5. Similar sequences may be envisioned for Ni(II) and Co(II). It is noteworthy to comment on the observation that optimal PVG conditions also include sample pH.76,81 Generally, most researchers have assumed that as the pH is lowered, decreased response occurs because of competitive re-oxidation or solubilization/destruction of the derivatized analyte species before it has an opportunity to escape to the gas phase. In light of the above, it is clear that LMCT reactions may be key to several processes and thus require an optimal pH for ligand complexation to occur. Alternatively, it should also be recognized that proton donors in solution (such as phosphate and ammonium species) may react by converting needed solvated electrons into hydrogen atoms,93 thereby shutting down important electron reduction mechanisms as the acidity increases.
Mercury was one of the first elements to be subjected to PVG using formic acid as a reductant70 and remains, along with several organometallic Hg species, the most frequently studied, as it is relatively easily photo-reduced in the presence of alcohols and aldehydes36 as well as undergoes sonolytic94 and thermochemical56 reduction in carboxylate media. Zhang95 has reviewed the literature devoted to photochemical redox reactions of mercury in the environment. In the simple case of Hg(II), typically present as the chlorocomplex, several possible reactions can be envisioned, including a primary photochemical process involving a LMCT reduction: (14) HgCli−1(i−2)− → Hg0 + HgCli(i−2)−(15)
It is noteworthy that the UV-Vis spectrum of an aqueous solution of mercuric chloride shows significant broad attenuation of UV starting at ∼260 nm, peaking at 205 nm and continuing down to near 180 nm. In the presence of 5% (v/v) acetic or formic acids, which also yield intense absorption peaks in the UV at ∼230 and 238 nm, respectively, the ligated complexes could also give rise to LMCT reductions such as: (16)
A similar set of reactions can occur for species such as methylmercury chloride, which also undergoes PVG in the presence of formic and acetic acids: (17) ˙CH3 + Hg(I)Cl˙ → Hg0 + CH3Cl(18)
Compelling evidence for such radical-based reactions was provided by Yin et al.61 who demonstrated that oxidation of mercaptoethanol in the reaction medium resulted in production of a cyclic disulfide ester with corresponding reduction of both inorganic and methylmercury species.
Selenium was the first element to be investigated for analytical purposes using PVG.29,30 As noted earlier, the study was inspired by a report from Kikuchi and Sakamoto43 who discussed the photochemical reduction of selenate in the presence of TiO2 catalyst to generate H2Se from solutions of formic acid. The catalyst was subsequently found to be unnecessary for PVG of Se(IV) and, in the presence of formic acid, both SeCO and SeH2 were detected,29,30 whereas with acetic and propionic acids, dimethyl- and diethyl-selenides, respectively, were synthesized. Formation of these compounds is in accord with expectation for radical-based reactions arising from the systems discussed above. Sturgeon and Grinberg46 proposed two possible scenarios to account for the PVG of Se(IV); a redox sequence involving release of a hydrated electron by photolysis of HCO2− (eqn (2)) and a cascade sequence of nucleophilic attacks by ˙R and rearrangements, as depicted in Fig. 2: HO–SeO–OH + e(aq)− → HO–SeO + HO−(19) HO–SeO + e(aq)− → SeO + HO−(20) (21) (22)or: SeO + ˙R → R–SeO˙ → R–Se˙ + ˙OH(23) R–Se˙ + ˙R → R2Se(24)Other elements, such as As, Sn, Sb and Pb, may also undergo similar e(aq)− reduction sequences (as outlined for Pb(II) by Pospisil et al.96), or nucleophilic attack.

Se(VI) is not amenable to PVG, possibly because it possesses no free lone pair of electrons to permit initiation of nucleophilic attack by ˙R radicals (cf.Fig. 2). Nevertheless, PVG of selenate has been successful, but typically through the intervention of titania as a photocatalyst.43 Following UV photon absorption by TiO2, an electron is promoted to the higher energy conduction band, leaving a positively charged hole in the valence band, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3. Amal and colleagues97,98 have investigated this phenomenon in detail; using Raman and other techniques they concluded that formic acid as well as Se(IV) and Se(VI) adsorb onto TiO2. Formate is an efficient hole scavenger which gives rise to reducing radicals by scavenging ˙OH. A series of reactions was proposed: (25) SeO42− + 3H+ + 2ecb− → HSeO3− + H2O(26) HSeO3− + 5H+ + 4ecb− → Se0 + 3H2O(27) Se0 + 2H+ + 2ecb− → H2Se(28) HCOO− + 2hvb+ → CO2 + H+(29) HCOO− + ˙OH → ˙COO− + H2O(30)
 Fig. 3  Photo-redox reactions catalyzed on the surface of a TiO2 particle; formic acid serves as the hole scavenger to minimize direct recombination of electrons and holes released from the conduction and valence bands, respectively. 
In a similar vein, photocatalytic reduction of mercury has been undertaken in the presence of TiO2 with speculation that direct reduction by ecb− occurs to liberate elemental Hg.36
Implementation of photocatalysts has been achieved using both heterogeneous and homogeneous systems. In the former, the added TiO2 (typically nano-anatase) is suspended in the sample solution while exposed to the UV field. Typically, no more than a 1 g L−1 slurry of TiO2 is employed, sufficient to confer photocatalytic activity while not impairing transmission of the UV flux through the sample.99 Use of semiconductor TiO2/ZrO2 and ZrO2 photocatalysts has been successfully developed for generation of H2Se from both Se(VI)100 and mercury species.101 These photocatalysts possess greater band gaps than TiO2 (5.0 eV) and thus should prove more efficient for reduction. Hou's research group has demonstrated the efficacy of photocatalysts based on metal organic frameworks (MOFs), crystalline hybrid inorganic/organic solids comprising metal (oxide) clusters interconnected by polydentate organic linkers.102,103 Their ease of synthesis, porosity, high surface area and efficiency for reduction of Se(VI) point to an attractive alternative for TiO2. Most recently, metal-free g-C3N4/CQD (carbon nitride/carbon quantum dots) composites have been synthesized and applied in a visible light source PVG system for Hg.104 The quest for ever more efficient photocatalysts continues.105 Homogeneous application of TiO2 photocatalyst can be conveniently accomplished by its physico-chemical immobilization on the interior wall of quartz tubing used to expose the sample to the UV field,68,106 eliminating the problems encountered with its sedimentation when slurry preparations are used.
Apart from use of physical photocatalysts to enhance the efficiency of PVG, several recent reports of homogeneous “sensitizers”, concomitant metal ions endogenous to, or spiked into, the sample solution63–65 as well as other reagents,58 have appeared that bestow enhanced PVG efficiency for some analytes. In the case of the metal ions, it may be speculated that addition of Fe, Cu, or Ni, or their mixtures, may alter the photo-absorption spectrum of the sample and/or change the kinetics of decarboxylation reactions as well as even alter the products of the reaction.37 The presence of Fe(III), for example, may promote production of ˙OH radicals through simple LMCT processes107 which subsequently alter the cascade of reactions leading to ˙CO2− as expressed by eqn (5), thereby altering the reduction capacity of the sample medium. Unfortunately, the field is not sufficiently developed to be able to offer more concrete reasons for such observations and significantly more data are required in order to interpret such results.
Iodine was the first non-metal successfully subjected to PVG74,108 for analytical purposes. In this respect, it is significantly different from the numerous metals that have been examined in that photolysis of iodide and iodate solutions containing low molecular weight organic acids leads to an oxidation reaction. Studies undertaken by Kloepfer et al.91 have pointed to an initially excited state (*) populated by charge transfer to solvent (CTTS). Rapid destruction of the CTTS state as the solvent rearranges the charge density leads to ejection of the electron into the solvent: (31)
The concept of “cage” reactions arises109 wherein the iodine atom–electron pair constitutes a loosely bound moiety which can either recombine or, through diffusion, interact with different partners to form the final product: [˙I(aq) + e(aq)−] + ˙R → RI(32)where ˙R = ˙H, ˙CH3 or ˙C2H5 as derived from photo-decarboxylation reactions of the added carboxylate ligands. Clearly, if ˙H combines with ˙I to form HI, the product remains dissociated in solution and thus no PVG volatile product is detected using a HCOOH medium whereas volatile compounds are readily released from CH3COOH. Similar reaction mechanisms can be invoked for bromine.75
This mechanistic model for PVG has been offered in an attempt to provide a framework to entice interested researchers to more closely evaluate these mechanisms, use them as a guide to further this field and to possibly minimize or control interferences by application of some of the basic principles. Significantly more information is needed before an understanding of equally complex issues relating to the temperature dependence of PVG yields and the role that catalysts and “sensitizers” play in promoting the photochemistry as these may influence the means by which insightful advantage can be used for the design of photo-reactors and manipulation of sample composition to guide method development.
Interferences with PVG
One of the more attractive features frequently ascribed to PVG (Table 2) is a reduction in interferences from concomitant elements when compared to that suffered by classical CVG techniques. Comparable vapor generation efficiency was reported for Se(IV) at up to 102-fold greater concentrations of Cu(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) in the sample than typically tolerated with HG.29 Nevertheless, following a further decade of study, it is now recognized that a new suite of relatively severe interferences occurs with PVG that is typically foreign to HG. Consistent with a reducing radical mechanism of PVG, a number of interferences arise from transition metal ions, notably Cu, Fe, Ni and Co, as well as common oxidants, including dissolved oxygen, nitrate and nitrite ions. Whereas the former group of interferences give rise to both suppressed as well as enhanced yields of photochemically generated analytes when present at low mg L−1 concentrations,45,48,64,66,110 that for the common anionic oxidants, including chloride, can manifest themselves typically in the low mM concentration range and are always suppressive.29,84
Although their specific mechanism of action remains elusive at this time, the positive impact of transition metals may derive from their possible concurrent role as sensitizers for accelerated photo-oxidation of carboxylic acids, as noted earlier, sometimes with specificity, e.g., Fe(III) enhances the rate of oxidation of HCOOH 100-fold more than it does that of CH3COOH.37 Suppressive interferences, on the other hand, may arise because such metal ions serve as simple oxidants, potentially inhibiting analyte reduction reactions by consuming needed reducing radicals:89,96 M2+ + e(aq)− → M+(33) M2+ + ˙CO2− → M+ + CO2(34) M2+ + ˙H → M+ + H+(35) M+ + e(aq)− → M0(36) M2+ + ˙CO2− → M0 + CO2(37)
It is noteworthy that contradictory observations can be found in the literature concerning the severity of interference imparted by the presence of endogenous or added trace elements. As an example, Campanella et al.51 reported significantly greater interferences from Cu(II), Ni(II) and Fe(III) than noted by Guo et al.29 during PVG of Se(IV), possibly due to their use of much lower concentrations of formic acid in the reaction medium as well as potentially different photo-reactors which influence the available photon flux and reaction temperature. In the case of Cu(II), interference was ascribed to the impact of reduced Cu metal being formed, consistent with eqn (36) and (37).
Dissolved oxygen, along with NO3−, NO2− and Cl−, are recognized quenchers of radical-based reactions due to their affinity for e(aq)− and ˙H and ˙R.46,109,111,112 Nitrate is a concomitant anion in many sample solutions prepared for instrumental analysis as it is frequently derived from nitric acid used to solubilize test samples or serves as a preservative for trace element content in solutions. Natural “contamination” of environmental aqueous samples by NO3− is unlikely to present a major problem in this regard because concentrations are typically in the μM range, some 2 orders of magnitude below which it constitutes a concern for PVG. Se(IV) in acetic acid constitutes a PVG system that is acutely sensitive to the suppression of generation efficiency in the presence of nitrate, wherein as little as 2 mM decreases response by 50%.113 Although never deliberately added to samples, nitrite is a product of the photoreduction of NO3− (ref. 114) and efficiency is even more affected by its presence, inducing similar suppressive effects at 10–20-fold lower concentrations than does NO3−. This may suggest that it is nitrite, rather than nitrate, that is directly responsible for the interference effects noted in PVG systems. Both anions participate in the complex redox equilibria operative in a PVG system, consuming photogenerated electrons (e(aq)−) and ˙H radicals,112,114 thereby making them less available for reduction of analyte species: NO3− + e(aq)− → ˙NO2 + OH−(38) NO3− + ˙H → ˙NO2 + OH−(39) ˙NO2 + H2O → NO3− + NO2− + 2H+(40) NO2− + ˙H → HNO˙2− → NO + OH−(41) (42) (43) (44) NO3− + H+ + ˙OH → NO3˙ + H2O → NO2 + H2O2(45) (46)
Additionally, nitrite may cyclically photo-regenerate nitrate (eqn (46)) by reaction with generated peroxide (arising from ˙OH). Note that reactions (42) and (43) create oxidizing ˙OH radicals33 which can rapidly react with ˙H species to effectively serve as a source of interference for PVG of hydrogenated analyte, such as SeH2. This may explain the impact of added NO3− on enhancing the amount of SeCO relative to SeH2 produced when PVG of Se(IV) is undertaken in formic acid media.29 Additionally, NO3− can react with the generated hydroxyl radical to produce a nitrate radical which will result in oxidizing peroxide species.115 Reactions (33)–(37), which may also be involved in the sequential reduction of analyte species leading to their PVG, may be suppressed in the presence of much higher (mM) concentrations of NO3− and NO2− as a consequence of their direct oxidation of the analyte.89
While it is relatively easy to remove dissolved gases from sample solutions, it is a difficult matter to eliminate or mask oxidizing anions and trace metals.113 Thus, as a general principle, nitric acid should be avoided or minimized when PVG is contemplated for quantitation. Strategies such as direct use of formic acid116 or tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH)84 should be considered for the solubilization of tissue samples. Microwave assisted dissolution of many matrices can be efficiently accomplished using minimal volumes of concentrated acids. Further minimization of the amount of oxidizing acids required can be achieved by using microwave assisted digestion and resorting to use of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction medium,117 reliance on use of more dilute acids,118 microwave induced combustion techniques119 and extreme temperatures and pressures available with the single reaction chamber.120 Alternatively, evaporation of concentrated residual acids present in digested samples and resolubilization of the residue in an (alternative) dilute acid, although time consuming, also provides an effective approach to sample preparation which minimizes interference from nitrate media.15,51,66,121 Under favorable circumstances, amelioration of suppression of response from endogenous trace elements may be accomplished by addition of chelating agents,113 but if significant molecular absorption from metal aquo- and carboxylate-complexes arises, the physical attenuation of available photon flux may seriously degrade the kinetics of PVG of the analyte.
Provided the PVG yield remains advantageous, use of isotope dilution techniques for quantitation when MS detection is available serve to circumvent interference effects when multi-isotopic analytes are being considered,15,23,63 otherwise matrix matched standards, best implemented via use of the method of additions, must be considered.
Analytical applications of PVG
Earlier reviews18,20,22,23 have summarized applications of PVG, at least up until 2011. By far, the most frequent targets have been mercury and selenium, focusing on determinations of both their total and speciated forms.122 Although applications of PVG remain relatively sparse compared to other methods of analysis, they have increased considerably in the past 6 years. Table 5 summarizes references describing the determination of Os, Co, I, Br, Sn, Cu, Te, Pb, Sb, As, Fe, Ni, Hg and Se in disparate matrices ranging from geochemical samples to natural waters, dietary supplements, sediments, biological tissues, gasoline, alcoholic beverages, herbal supplements and urine. Quantitation strategies have been based on external calibration standards, matrix matched and standard additions approaches, as well as isotope dilution.15,23,63,135,139 The advantages of the latter are clear when PVG yields are affected by endogenous matrix species in the sample solutions that contribute to radical quenching, sensitizing and simple source attenuation due to colored absorbers.

As with other vapor generation techniques, PVG has been utilized for both analyte preconcentration42,50,60,62,66,122,137,143,148,151,152 as well as species-specific quantitation for mercury and selenium.122 Speciation information has been achieved by making use of photo-reactor source characteristics,45,55,56,70 solution chemistry,62,84 photocatalysts,97,99–102 as well as conventional HPLC separations.70,71,99,101,153,154
A practical approach to PVG
Technical optimization of PVG systems should be based on guiding principles garnered from the above framework of evaluated current experimental systems as well as proposed photochemical reactions amongst analytes and potential interferents. Ideally, PVG should be achieved with high efficiency and specificity, free of interferences while incurring loss-free phase separation, transport and delivery of volatile species to detection systems. Practically, the often unknown composition of real samples presents significant challenges to these goals and implementation of an optimal sample preparation/treatment will dictate the degree of success. As discussed earlier, oxidants and radical scavengers in the prepared sample should be avoided or used with care. Dilution of prepared samples is one means of reducing such interferences but only when the enhancement in generation efficiency compensates for the dilution factor. Ultrasonic agitation of liquid samples prior to processing may prove beneficial in that dissolved oxygen can be removed.
Generation of needed reducing radicals in the sample medium requires absorption of source radiation by the LMW organic acid. With acetic and formic acids, this requires a deep UV-C source with output in the 250 nm and lower wavelengths.46 As such, inexpensive and readily available low pressure Hg discharge lamps in doped quartz envelopes (to limit output to >225 nm and eliminate ozone formation) can be considered most practical, as output is channeled into a few high intensity UV-C transitions. In the sole case of Hg(II), requiring simple reduction, it has been demonstrated that UV-B radiation may be used to accomplish this task.58 Use of broadband high pressure, high power Hg discharge lamps may also heat the sample (thereby possibly initiating thermochemical reduction reactions) as well as drive unwanted photochemical reactions (such as LMCT) predominantly occurring at longer wavelengths due to the presence of other metal–ligand complexes.46 Unfortunately, the impact of this is currently unknown and would require extensive investigation of not only source wavelength, but sample composition. Thus, use of expensive tunable or diode pumped solid state UV lasers could only be condoned as potentially useful tools for further fundamental investigations. Similarly, inexpensive high output diode laser bars, widely used for water processing technology, are currently not of interest as the shortest wavelength commercially available is 405 nm.
As thin-film irradiation conditions are desirable, due to the small penetration depth of UV-C in prepared sample solutions, and continuous flow systems more readily support throughput and control of reaction conditions, quartz or PFA/FEP conduits are recommended for exposure of the sample to the irradiation source. Synthetic quartz (suprasil) offers enhanced transmission of UV at deeper wavelengths (85% at 185 nm) but is clearly only of benefit if use of this radiation is deemed needed, otherwise 85% transmission efficiency of natural quartz at 250 nm is sufficient. The fragility and cost of quartz make polymeric PFA/FEP tubing extremely attractive, despite lower UV-C transmission efficiencies, which can be compensated for by using longer exposure times, if needed.
As with all VG methodologies, phase separation of the volatile product from the irradiated liquid sample is best served when an efficient mechanically sparged GLS is used to strip the analyte from solution,48 eliminating the impact of relative hydrophobicity on the efficiency. This is readily accomplished by directing the irradiated sample to/across a fritted support disk through which an inert transport gas is passed, or by application of ultrasound degassing.130 Minimization of dead volume and transport gas flow rate yields low dispersion and dilution of the effluent product for transport and detection.
With continuous or FI sample introduction, maximum benefit of PVG is realized when the fastest flow rate at which significant generation efficiency can be realized is used, as it is the flux of vapor generated element atoms directed to the detector that determines the S/N and ultimate relative LOD. This can be conveniently investigated by normalizing the response as a function of flow rate. A linear relationship between the latter and the flow rate reveals that neither generation efficiency is affected by irradiation time nor that phase separation efficiency is compromised as the flow rate increases and (possibly) overwhelms the GLS. Flow rates commensurate with such maximum response in light of (possible limited) sample usage should be selected. Alternatively, a “stop-flow” or “intermittent flow” approach48 may be selected wherein the flow rate of the irradiated sample to the GLS/detector is fixed and irradiation independently occurs using a sample volume, fully accommodated within the irradiated zone of the photo-reactor, exposed for varying irradiation time periods and then rapidly delivered to the GLS at a constant rate. This approach eliminates the interplay between irradiation time and flux of analyte to the detection system that occurs with continuous sample introduction.
Quantitation with PVG remains problematic and is generally achieved using the method of additions, which can be precisely undertaken in reproducible FI systems despite the presence of interfering species. With ICP-MS detection, isotope dilution of selected elements becomes an option. These measures compensate for matrix or generation interferences. Typically, only the simplest of sample matrices, such as natural waters, can be analyzed using an external calibration approach. Method development should include an examination of performance in single and mixed LMW acid media, influence of pH and the impact of common sensitizers such μg mL−1 concentrations of Cu(II) and Fe(III) and Co(II) added to the reaction medium.
PVG is a relatively inexpensive and simple system to implement and is fully compatible with diverse detection systems. It is evident that the variety of applications is expanding and with it, the practical knowledge base from which select experimental parameters will emerge to significance.
Plasma mediated vapor generation
Perhaps closely allied with PVG approaches, due to a potential common mechanism of action, are techniques that may be described as plasma mediated vapor generation. DC and high frequency non-thermal plasmas in He and Ar discharges are rich sources of UV radiation which can serve the same role as conventional photochemical reactors in that numerous free radicals can be generated in sample solutions exposed to such plasmas.155 The most useful variants are atmospheric pressure glow discharges, such as the solution cathode,155,156 and dielectric barrier discharges.157,158 With the former discharge, the plasma is in direct (electrodeless) contact with the liquid sample, thereby also permitting potential electrochemical reactions to occur (as with electrochemical hydride generation19). Electron transfer reactions at the interface have been increasingly studied159–162 in relation to the generation of volatile species and Bruggeman et al.31 have recently reviewed such discharges and presented a roadmap for their future implementation. Both sources are compact, operate at high efficiency and have been used to advantage for metal vapor generation, offering the same green chemistry as PVG, thereby complementing standard PVG approaches.
It appears that Zhu et al.163 were the first to report on the phenomenon of cold vapor generation of mercury from both inorganic and organo-mercury compounds using a solution cathode glow discharge (SCGD). The background electrolyte was 0.1 M HNO3 although the presence of LMW organic acids, such as 1% formic, enhanced the generation efficiency such that it was superior to a conventional CVG approach employing reduction by SnCl2. Several mechanisms were proposed, including simple solution sputtering (unlikely to selectively enhance vapor yields) and a thermal mechanism (similar to thermolysis action reported for mercury reduction56) as well as the intervention of radicals and free electrons. Significant interference was evident from the presence of chloride, which in hindsight is to be expected from the viewpoint of radical quenching, as well as Hg-complex formation. Decker and Webb156 have speculated on the mechanisms operative in SCGD but were unable to unequivocally identify specific modes of action, one of which was suggested to be PVG. Subsequent work from Zhu's laboratory further coupled the SCGD source to demonstrate vapor generation of iodine164 from pH 2 HNO3 with an estimated efficiency of 60%; the speciation of mercury when combined with HPLC using a mercaptoethanol mobile phase,165 and the vapor generation of Os166 from pH 1 HNO3 with an estimated 51% efficiency. Note that for iodine and osmium generation, oxidation is required, consistent with PVG mechanisms (as evidenced by eqn (31)).
The application of flow injection sample processing coupled with single drop SCGD vapor generation was demonstrated by Zheng et al. for detection of total mercury in fish tissues167 as well as Cd and Zn in samples of hair and paramecium cells.168 A glow discharge in an Ar/H2 mixture supporting a plasma was established between the tip of a tungsten electrode and a 5–20 μL liquid droplet. The low power (12 W) plasma was sustained using a compact ozone generator operating at 4 kV and 20 kHz. The typical experimental arrangement is depicted in Fig. 4. Mercury species were extracted from mg-sized tissue subsamples supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes using an L-cysteine/HCOOH mixture, which dramatically enhanced response. This was attributed to the increased reduction capacity of radicals generated from the formic acid by the glow discharge. Atomic fluorescence provided an absolute limit of detection of 0.2 pg. High generation efficiencies reported for Cd and Zn (90 and 80%, respectively) were achieved during the 10 s that the plasma discharge was used to process the liquid droplet and yielded absolute detection limits of 0.2 and 2 pg for Cd and Zn, respectively. Although high “sample introduction” efficiency is claimed, it is in reality high vapor generation efficiencies that were realized.

Most recently, Liu et al.169 demonstrated the advantage of a solution anode glow discharge arrangement for the plasma mediated vapor generation of volatile molecular species of both Zn and Cd from a pH 2 medium of HCl. Sensitivity was enhanced 10-fold over the conventional SCGD arrangement. It was postulated that electron transfer reactions occurred at the interface of the (550 V, 10 mA) 7 W DC microplasma and the liquid surface. A subsequent study using the same type of apparatus170 reported on the generation of volatile molecular (as well as atomic for Cd) species of Cd and Zn when the sample solution was introduced into the cathode compartment which housed a stainless steel capillary through which an Ar/H2 mixture was passed to sustain a plasma between the tip of the capillary and the sample solution surface. A pH 3.2 HCl medium was used for samples and analyses of stream sediment and rice reference materials was undertaken for Cd along with a simulated water sample for Zn. Interferences from concomitant species necessitated the use of the method of additions for quantitation of Cd in the stream sediment.
Dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) are finding increased use as low power, inexpensive and simple sources for optical spectrometry.141,158 Attention has recently turned to their potential use as sources for vapor generation. The first such applications of a DBD to replace a discrete photo-reactor appeared in 2011.171,172 Hou's group171 employed the DBD source to reduce Hg(II) in dilute solutions of formic, acetic or propionic acids by simply pumping the sample solution (at 2 mL min−1) through the concentric volume defined by a powered copper electrode encased in a dielectric quartz tube and that of an outer quartz tube wrapped in a counter electrode of copper foil. An Ar plasma, formed in the kHz high-voltage 20 W discharge, provided an intense UV spectrum with which to irradiate the passing sample. The Hg0 vapor so formed in this PVG system was phase separated in a GLS and directed to an ICP for detection in emission mode. The research group of Zhu et al. has also actively pursued the use of the DBD for vapor generation over the past few years. They utilized an approach similar to that of Zheng et al.171 Inorganic-, methyl- and ethylmercury were successfully reduced to Hg0 by subjecting a thin-film of the sample prepared in 1% formic acid to the DBD plasma.172 This was accomplished by manually dipping the quartz encased copper powered electrode into the sample solution and withdrawing an ∼6 μL volume of liquid which would form a uniform thin-film on its surface. The sample bearing electrode was then inserted into the DBD assembly and power applied to establish a 5 W discharge. Total mercury was determined in freeze dried urine and tuna fish reference materials. In a companion paper published the following year,173 reduction of mercury as thiomersal in samples that were again manually administered (∼8 μL) onto the glass sheath surrounding the powered electrode by physically dipping it into the sample solution and inserting it into a 7 W Ar DBD plasma was reported. The same group generated volatile Cd species (presumed to be CdH2)174 based on a flow-injected volume (300 μL) of a pH 7 aqueous sample to create a flowing thin-film of liquid over the powered electrode of a DBD supporting an 18 W Ar/H2 plasma for quantitation of Cd in natural water and a rice reference material. This was shortly followed up by a second such study which detailed the production of a volatile Zn species175 based on a similarly constructed 25 W He/H2 DBD plasma. More recently, Zhu's group has improved the performance of their earlier approach to Cd vapor generation174 by the addition of non-ionic surfactants to increase the reaction kinetics and improve product transport efficiency for the determination of both Cd and Hg in natural water reference materials.176 Subsequently, they incorporated an HPLC into the system to permit speciation of Hg for its determination as inorganic-, ethyl-, and methyl-mercury in a tuna fish certified reference material.177Fig. 5 illustrates the set-up for a thin-film dielectric barrier discharge plasma-VG system.

A somewhat more elegant design of such a source was described by Yang et al.178 wherein a sample was nebulized into a spray chamber from which the aerosol was directed through an Ar/H2 DBD and transported to an atomic fluorescence detection system. Hydrogen was required to yield signals from As, Te, Sb and Se with the suggestion that hydride generation had occurred within the plasma discharge. The potential shortcoming of nebulized solutions is, as mentioned earlier, the introduction of all sample components into the source and not simply the selective gating of the analyte, which perpetuates potential matrix and spectral interferences.
These approaches to PVG remain to be further explored and applied to more elements but are limited by the apparent low flow rates of sample solution that can be accommodated by the DBD reactors. Nevertheless, they provide an attractive venue for field deployment as advantage can be taken of their small size, high sensitivity, minimal power requirements and ease of integration into miniaturized spectrometer detection platforms. The same arguments obviously hold for use of atmospheric pressure glow discharges as PVG reactors as well as conventional PVG systems.127
Conclusions and outlook
Much of the “low hanging fruit” in this area has now been harvested, although an empirical push to broaden the list of elements amenable to PVG remains a relevant task. Suitable targets include Mo and W (volatile carbonyls of W and Mo have been identified in landfill gasses179), Cr and Cl. The latter element provides an example where research conducted in ancillary fields180 may provide insight on development of successful PVG approaches that circumvent the limited direct rationale now in use.
Although the past several decades have witnessed the commercial realization of powerful new instrumentation, including tandem MS coupled to ICP sources for enhanced detection power and control of spectral interferences, there will always remain a demand for enhanced detection power irrespective of current limits. Moreover, many laboratories do not have the resources to purchase or maintain such equipment and must rely on other atomic spectrometric techniques. For an expanding but niche collection of specific elements discussed herein, such improvements can be realized using VG techniques when other practical approaches have failed. Unfortunately, the fundamental problem with PVG is that it currently suffers from substantial and seemingly unpredictable matrix effects present in many real-world samples, which are difficult to avoid. Non-specific photo-chemical effects alter the analyte generation efficiency through radical quenching or sensitization reactions. Classical hydride generation techniques, now practiced for more than 40 years, are still the subject of fundamental study with the aim of bringing well-known interferences under control; without doubt, similar advances will be made to further understanding and widespread acceptance of PVG.
Reaction products of PVG appear to be accounted for based on reductions and radical based reactions which are fundamental to photochemical processes. These also appear to account for the effects of known interferences and help explain the impact of photo-reactor parameters on generation efficiency. Nevertheless, an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of PVG should render predictive power to this endeavor and potentially result in control over known interferences. Such achievements will impact not only the ultimate possibilities of how the future of this field may unfold, but also lead to the attainment of robust conditions for sustainable high-yield generation of analytes from a plethora of matrices. It is evident that the traditional tools of photochemistry need to be applied to this new area of study,181 including ESR for detection of radicals in solution, actinometry to assess photochemical efficiencies and stop-flow transient UV-Vis absorption spectra to provide the evidence needed to support the existence of intermediates such as free electrons and other species proposed herein. Additionally, more widespread use of electrospray-MS may prove useful for the detection of short-lived intermediates in solution produced during photolysis.73 Clearly, contributions from photochemists and inorganic chemists are needed in a multidisciplinary approach to support the analytical chemistry community in this endeavor.
Despite the need for additional mechanistic information, systematic investigation into the control/suppression/compensation of interferences, an expanded applications database and enhanced elemental coverage, the complementary nature of PVG positions it for a continuing role in ultratrace elemental analysis, as a stand-alone methodology for enhancing sample introduction efficiency when physically paired with other vapor generation approaches,121,182 or when combined with conventional solution sample introduction.183,184
The simplicity and compact nature of the needed apparatus, especially when UV LEDs are available, make for a potential field instrument when combined with a myriad of low power mini-plasmas and compact detection platforms.127,185
