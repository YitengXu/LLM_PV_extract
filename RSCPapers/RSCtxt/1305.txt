Broader context
Alkaline electrochemical water splitting has gained significant attention to solve the ever-increasing energy demand and environmental contamination. Owing to the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) in alkaline electrolytes, it is important to understand the mechanism of these two half-reactions and design efficient HER/OER electrocatalysts. Alkaline HER processes involve the slow kinetics of water dissociation, which even makes Pt metal suffer from poor activity. For the alkaline OER, four-electron–proton-coupling reactions also result in sluggish kinetics, and details regarding OER intermediates, energy barrier of each step, and active-phase evolution are unclear. This review describes the fundamental comprehension of alkaline HER/OER; bifunctional site construction using noble-metal- and nonnoble-metal-based HER electrocatalysts; and OER electrocatalyst design based on binding energy, electronic structure, lattice oxygen, and surface reconstruction. In addition, recent developments in bifunctional HER/OER electrocatalysts are also presented from the viewpoints of efficient construction of numerous active sites. In the near future, with the development of theoretical calculations, in situ advanced characterization, new synthesis strategies for catalytic materials, complete understanding of mechanisms, and industrial applications of alkaline water splitting will become the norm.

1. Introduction
Based on the current situation involving energy exhaustion and environmental pollution, renewable energy sources have received widespread attention.1–3 Hydrogen energy is attractive as one of the alternatives to traditional fossil fuels owing to its high mass energy density.4 Nowadays, hydrogen is largely produced via the steam reforming of natural gas that discharges a dramatic amount of carbon dioxide.5 In the quest for zero carbon emissions, electrochemical water splitting (2H2O + energy → 2H2 + O2, Fig. 1), has become one of the promising routes to convert renewable energy into hydrogen when electrical energy is provided in a sustainable manner using wind or solar power.6–11 Generally, water splitting is performed under acidic or alkaline conditions. The former is usually performed using a proton exchange membrane (PEM) with the merits of high energy efficiency and fast hydrogen production rate.12 However, acidic media also limit the electrocatalysts of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to precious metal and metal oxides, resulting in the high cost of PEM.13 Compared with acidic water electrolysis, water electrolysis in alkaline media broadens the range of electrocatalysts to earth-abundant materials, especially for OER electrocatalysts.14–17 However, there are still challenges in the fabrication of effective electrocatalysts for both alkaline HER (4H2O + 4e− → 2H2 + 4OH−) and OER (4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−) owing to their sluggish kinetics. Although noble electrocatalysts, such as Pt (HER) and Ir/Ru oxides (OER), have been employed as commercial materials, the excessive price and rare storage still restrict their large-scale applications in water splitting.18,19

Indeed, due to the unfavorable kinetics and high cost of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, enormous efforts have been made towards the development of electrocatalysts with efficient HER and OER performances.20–24 Apart from the precious metal-based electrocatalysts, nonprecious-metal-based materials, such as metal oxides,25 chalcogenides,26 phosphides,27 nitrides,28 and carbides,29 have been largely reported. However, the following challenges still exist: (1) alkaline HER processes involve multiple reactions and slow kinetics of water dissociation, which lead to approximately two orders of magnitude lower activity than that in acid, as well as the fact that they are more sensitive to the surface structure of the catalysts.30 (2) Alkaline OER also involves a 4-electron–proton transfer process, making it the rate-determining step (RDS) with high overpotential and complex reaction mechanism. (3) It is still unclear what exactly the active sites are and how to fabricate a highly active site. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the reaction mechanism and fundamental structure–activity relationship of HER/OER, and subsequently, design efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.
Herein, recent developments in the mechanical concepts of alkaline HER/OER and advanced electrocatalysts aimed at kinetics issues in alkaline media are summarized. Firstly, we briefly describe the thermodynamics of HER and OER. Secondly, based on the kinetics issues of alkaline HER, the design of precious and nonprecious electrocatalysts are reviewed. In addition, OER electrocatalysts with low energy barriers are presented via the energy tailoring of the adsorbed intermediates, electronic structure optimization, lattice oxygen participation, and surface rearrangement. Thirdly, recent advancements in the fabrication of bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting are further concluded briefly. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of alkaline water splitting are proposed. We hope that this review can provide valuable guidelines and further insights for researchers.
2. Fundamentals of alkaline electrochemical water splitting
2.1 Thermodynamics of alkaline HER reactions
In alkaline media, the activity of HER is ∼2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic media, and the reaction is sensitive to the surface structures of catalysts.31 Theoretical works revealed that HER activity was related with hydrogen adsorption (Had) in acidic media, which was composed of Volmer/Heyrovsky or Volmer/Tafel steps, as shown below:32,33
Volmer step: H+ + e− → Had
Heyrovsky step: H+ + e− + Had → H2
Tafel step: 2Had → H2
In alkaline media, it is vital to trade-off Had, hydroxyl adsorption (OHad), and water dissociation. The Heyrovsky and Volmer steps are described with water rather than protons as reactants.34,35
Volmer step: H2O + e− → OH− + Had
Heyrovsky step: H2O + e− + Had → OH− + H2
Therefore, breaking the strong covalent H–O–H bond is imperative in alkaline media rather than the weak covalent bond of H3O+. The rational design of electrocatalysts with good ability to dissociate water and binding hydrogen species can effectively improve alkaline HER performances. Based on the reaction pathway involved in the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps, four major factors might influence the alkaline HER performance, namely, water adsorption on active sites, water dissociation ability, hydrogen binding energy, and adsorption strength of aqueous OH−. Water adsorption is the first step of hydrogen evolution in alkaline media, which is much weaker than H3O+ adsorption in acidic media. Therefore, an enhanced metal–H2O bond can improve the subsequent HER performance. Recently, Baek and coworkers obtained low overpotential of 17 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which were lower than those of Pt/C in 1.0 M KOH solution obtained via Ru nanoparticles anchored on a nitrogenated holey 2D carbon structure (Ru@C2N).36 Moreover, the turnover frequency (TOF) values of Ru@C2N (0.76 H2 s−1 at 25 mV; 1.66 H2 s−1 at 50 mV) were also higher than those of Pt/C (0.47 H2 s−1 at 25 mV; 0.95 H2 s−1 at 50 mV). As shown in Fig. 2a, theoretical studies further suggested that Ru–H2O bond energies were higher in Ru@C2N, which facilitated water adsorption as well as overcoming the efficiency loss in the Volmer step. Then, inefficient water dissociation further limited the alkaline HER kinetics, even though various catalysts have exhibited superb performances in acids with optimal adsorption and recombination of the reactive Had.37–39 Therefore, improving the water dissociation ability can definitely improve the hydrogen evolution performance in alkaline solutions. In this regard, Markovic and coworkers designed a multistep system of metal oxides/metals; metal oxides provided water dissociation sites and metal sites acted as hydrogen intermediates for adsorption and association.30 In particular, they prepared Ni(OH)2/Pt islands/Pt(110) catalysts, where Ni(OH)2 preferentially nucleated on the Pt surface defects and covered the Pt islands. Corresponding experiments demonstrated that water was adsorbed at the binary section between the Ni(OH)2 and Pt domains, followed by water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption on the nearby Pt vacancy sites. Two Had intermediates recombined to H2 on the Pt surface and OH− desorbed to form Ni(OH)2 sites (Fig. 2b). In order to further improve water dissociation, Li+ cations were introduced into the electrolyte owing to their strong interaction with H2O and OHad. The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 reduced to ∼100 mV on Li+–Ni(OH)2/Pt islands/Pt(110), which is lower than that on bare Pt(110). Furthermore, recent studies revealed that hydrogen binding energy could be regarded as a descriptor in alkaline media. In acidic media, it has been generally claimed that optimal hydrogen binding energy (not too strong and not too weak) would result in high activity; a volcano plot was effectively formed when the exchange current density was plotted as a function of the M–H binding energy.40–43 However, owing to the different proposed reaction mechanisms, the applicability of hydrogen binding energy for HER in alkaline media is unclear. To better understand the versatility of hydrogen binding energy, Yan and coworkers explored the relationship between HER activity and hydrogen binding energy on a series of monometallic surfaces. As shown in Fig. 2c, volcano plots were formed in all the cases. Pt was still on the top of the volcano curve; Cu/Ag/Au was located at the right-hand side branch of the volcano curve with weak hydrogen binding energies and the contrary was true for W/Fe/Ni/Co/Pd with strong hydrogen binding energies.44 Finally, OH− adsorption could be another factor influencing the HER performance. According to the Sabatier principle, an intermediate binding energy can favor the overall reaction.45 If OH− adsorption is too strong, active sites will be occupied by the final products, leading to higher HER overpotential. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Baek and coworkers also found that the Ru/C2N hybrid had low affinity toward OH−, yielding better alkaline HER performance.36 However, a different view was presented by Yan and coworkers. They determined the HER polarizations and CVs of Pt in several buffer solutions over a wide range of pH values. They proposed that OH− adsorption did not directly take part in the reaction, while the OH− concentration in the media altered the hydrogen binding energy and, in turn, affected the HER performance (Fig. 2d).46 In addition, Durst and coworkers suggested that the quick recombination between H+ and OH− changed the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps, thereby influencing the alkaline HER performance.47

2.2 Thermodynamics of alkaline OER reactions
The OER process is considered to participate on surface metal sites (M), and a universalized mechanism of alkaline OER includes the following steps. The schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 3a. Firstly, M–OH forms via the 1-electron oxidation of hydroxide anions adsorbed on the active site. Then, M–OH transforms into M–O after a couple of proton and electron removals. Thereafter, M–O experiences two different pathways into forming O2 molecules. On one hand, two M–O species get combined and converted into O2 and M active sites. On the other hand, M–O converts into M–OOH after a hydroxyl anion gets coupled under 1-electron oxidation and then starts another proton-coupled electron transfer process, generating O2 and the initial active sites.48–50 A detailed understanding of this interaction between catalysts surface and OER intermediates is important for the overall OER performance improvement.51 However, it is difficult to entirely understand the RDS and confirm the kinetics descriptions of the OER owing to the above multiple intermediates. Fortunately, DFT calculations provide a simple insight into the individual reaction steps and reaction mechanism of each step, and extensive attention has been paid toward modeling the thermodynamics of electrochemical reactions over the past few decades.52–54 In particular, the reaction energy of each elementary step is determined by the deviation of adsorption energy of two intermediates, and the reaction free energy diagrams are formulated to determine the thermodynamically least favorable step, as shown in Fig. 3b. Reaction energies for each step are different owing to the irregular variations in the adsorption energies of the intermediate species; therefore, the corresponding RDS is known as the reaction step with the highest free energy.55 In an earlier work, Valdés and coworkers found that the strong binding of oxygen to the surface can increase the difficulty of MOOH formation, whereas the weak binding of oxygen to the surface can increase the difficulty of MO formation.56 Subsequently, Rossmeisl and coworkers found that β-MnO2 showed moderate oxygen binding energy and similar MO and MOOH formation energies, which resulted in a direct O–O recombination mechanism (M + H2O → MOH + H+ + e−; MOH → MO + H+ + e−; MO → M + 1/2O2).57 These equations are also applicable for a basic environment for the following reasons: (1) reactions in both acid and base involve the same intermediates and the same number of protons and electrons and (2) aH+ and aOH− are directly related by means of a pH/pOH scale since water is in equilibrium with H+ and OH−. The binding energy of the intermediates can also be influenced by the adsorbed species, solvent interactions, surface vacancies, and so on. For example, Nørskov and coworkers compared the OER activity of the rutile-type oxides of RuO2/IrO2/TiO2 and found that the surface coverage of the oxygen (O) and hydroxyl groups (OH) played a different role in OER performance. With regard to RuO2, O-covered surface had the largest free energy change for the formation of MOOH intermediates. However, on the HO-covered surface, MO intermediates were the least stable, indicating the influence of local conditions around the catalyst surface. Comprehensive research has shown that the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl groups stabilized the MOH and MOOH intermediates relative to the MO intermediate.54 In addition, Muckerman and Akimov et al. further explored the solvation interactions on the surfaces of GaN, ZnO, and GaN/ZnO alloys and found that the interactions between water molecules with catalyst surface would also influence the OER process. These results showed that hydroxide ions would bond with the surface Ga or Zn cations; meanwhile, N or O sites would accept protons from dissociated water molecules.58,59 Although these electrocatalytic materials are complex and catalytic activity is highly sensitive to a multitude of parameters, a single microscopic parameter is important to provide insights into the RDS of OER, which can facilitate materials design. Until now, many descriptors have been employed to express the catalytic activities of OER, including M–OH bonding energy, energy of the reaction step (ΔGO* − ΔGHO*), and certain electronic structural parameters (d orbital occupation, eg orbital filling, and O p-band center). With the guidance of thermodynamic analysis, electrocatalysts can be further developed with the aim to enhance the RDS and lower the energy barrier of oxygen evolution.

3. Mechanism-guided design of electrocatalysts for water splitting
3.1 HER electrocatalysts in alkaline media
In alkaline media, there are deficiencies in determining certain structure–performance relationships, and a majority of catalysts perform poorer in alkaline media than in acidic media, including Pt-based materials. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the HER activity from the viewpoint of mechanism and subsequently design the corresponding catalyst to improve the RDS that can reduce the reaction potential and improve the alkaline HER activity. In particular, for noble-metal-based catalysts, a rational catalyst not only requires high alkaline HER performance but also necessitates atomic utilization and low metal dosage owing to its scarce storage and high cost.60,61 On the other hand, alternative nonnoble-metal-based catalysts have also received considerable attention.28,62 As mentioned earlier, four major factors influence the alkaline HER activity to a certain extent, namely, water adsorption, water dissociation, hydrogen binding energy, and OH− adsorption. Therefore, it is worthwhile to understand the effect of these electrocatalysts on improving the alkaline HER performance from the viewpoints of these four factors. Herein, we will provide an overview of the recent studies regarding catalyst designs of noble-metal-based catalysts as well as a brief introduction involving nonprecious electrocatalysts. The performances of alkaline HER electrocatalysts are listed in Table 1.

3.1.1 Pt-Based materials. 
Facilitated by their appropriate hydrogen binding energies, Pt-based catalysts have usually acted as the benchmark for HER, and they exhibit relatively high hydrogen evolution activity.63–66 However, it is still terrible that the exchange current density of these catalysts in alkaline media is about 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic media owing to their poor water dissociation ability.31 Therefore, it is important to construct a rational structure with active sites for water dissociation. Such a groundbreaking work should involve the design of a Li+–Ni(OH)2–Pt interface, where the edges of the Ni(OH)2 cluster promote water dissociation and the Pt surface adsorbs the hydrogen intermediates for recombining into H2. In addition, the introduction of Li+ further strengthens the water dissociation ability because of the distributed HO–H bond.30 Thereafter, Markovic and coworkers further emphasized the significance of the water dissociation step and investigated whether this method could be successfully applied to Pt group metals (Ru, Ir, and Pt), IB group metals (Cu, Ag, and Au), and 3D transition metals (Ni, V, and Ti).67 As shown in Fig. 4a, the alkaline HER activity increases in the order of Ir > Pt > Ru owing to the enhanced Volmer step on the more oxophilic Ir surface than the Pt and Ru surfaces. IB metals exhibit the opposite activity in acidic and alkaline media, indicating that water dissociation might be the RDS. In addition, 3D transition metals showed similar activity in acidic and alkaline media, suggesting that native surface oxides were critical to the water dissociation step. Inspired by this bifunctional approach, Zheng and coworkers also designed Pt-decorated Ni3N nanosheet electrocatalysts to achieve alkaline HER at a current density of 200 mA cm−2 and overpotential of 160 mV.68 Ni3N species not only improved the electron conductivity but also promoted water dissociation with the ultrathin surface oxidation layer formed under the ambient atmosphere. Then, the H intermediate transformed into Pt sites and recombined into H2 molecules, yielding a low Tafel slope of 36.5 mV dec−1. To better fabricate bifunctional active sites, interfacial architecture would be the perfect method. Recently, Huang and coworkers designed Pt–Ni nanowires with abundant NiOx/Pt3Ni interfaces for electrochemical hydrogen evolution.69 On the NiOx/Pt3Ni interface, NiOx played its role in water dissociation and OH− electrostatic affinity, which promoted the Volmer step and avoided the blocking of Pt active sites by OH−. Subsequently, the OH− and H intermediates adsorbed onto the surface of NiO2 and vacant Pt, respectively, facilitating the realization of efficient alkaline HER performance. The obtained Pt3Ni3 nanowires/C-air catalyst yielded current densities of 39.7 (1 M KOH electrolyte) and 23.0 (0.1 M KOH electrolyte) mA cm−2 at overpotential of 0.07 V, respectively. However, commercial Pt/C catalysts only achieved current densities of 3.42 and 8.1 mA cm−2. Furthermore, they also tuned the Pt3Ni–NiS interface; the obtained heterostructure delivered a current density of 37.2 mA cm−2 at overpotential of 70 mV, which was 9.7 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts.70 With similar synergy effects with NiOx/Pt3Ni catalysts, water would be dissociated into the H intermediate and OH− on the NiS surface. Then, OH− would be anchored on the NiS sites owing to the stronger electrostatic affinity, and the H intermediate would transfer into the nearby Pt sites. Their DFT calculations further demonstrated that the NiS(100) surface had a lower dissociation barrier (0.32 eV) than the Pt(111) surface (0.89 eV; Fig. 4b). Moreover, the Pt3Ni(111) surface also exhibited additional applicable H binding energy (GH*) value than the NiS surface, which was worthwhile for Hads desorption and H2 evolution (Fig. 4c). Apart from interface engineering, the alloy structure provided another means for the construction of multiple sites. Lee and coworkers prepared hexapod Pt@Ni@Co alloy nanocatalysts that exhibited better HER activity than Pt/C and Pt@Ni catalysts. The introduction of Co facilitated the H–OH cleavage reaction for better Volmer step kinetics.71 Recently, doping was employed in Pt-based materials for alkaline HER. Wang and coworkers prepared N-modified Pt–Ni nanowires to deliver ultralow overpotential of 13 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. As shown in the DFT calculations (Fig. 4d), the analysis of the difference in the surface electron densities revealed that N doping could attract electrons from Ni and promote the interactions between Ni and N. This strong Ni–N coupling generated perpendicular empty dz2; the orbital closer to the Fermi level could accommodate electrons from water and provide active sites for water adsorption and activation. This energy diagram further revealed that Pt–Ni(N) had facile water adsorption energy (−1.21 eV) and low water dissociation energy barrier (0.89 eV), which are much lower than those of Pt–Ni (−0.67 eV and 1.15 eV). Moreover, the project density of states analysis further exhibited the electron states for favorable H–O activation and cleavage.72

3.1.2 Ru-Based materials. 
With a similar hydrogen bond energy (∼65 kcal mol−1) as Pt, Ru is also an ideal theoretical HER catalyst; further, the price of Ru is one-fourth that of Pt, which makes it a good alternative for use in HER.73,74 In addition, Ru even exhibits stronger water dissociation ability than that of Pt metal. Qiao and coworkers reported anomalous Ru/C3N4/C catalysts that exhibited small overpotential of 79 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and 2.5 times higher TOF values than those of Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 5a and b).75 DFT calculations revealed that both Rufcc (0.94 eV) and Ruhcp (0.51 eV) exhibited lower water dissociation energy barriers than the Pt surface (Fig. 5c). Considering the advantage of water dissociation, Wang and coworkers fabricated uniform Ru nanoparticles over N-doped carbon (Ru@CN) through the calcination of a solid mixture of D-glucosamine hydrochloride, melamine, and RuCl3.76 After the treatment of various amounts of melamine, Ru@CN-0.16 exhibited well-dispersed Ru nanoparticles (2.3 nm), the highest specific surface area value (632 m2 g−1), and the highest percentage of Ru0 (70%). The high Ru0 ratio promotes the adsorption of H intermediates on the Ru surface after water dissociation into Had and OH−, further enhancing the alkaline HER activity. The obtained Ru@CN-0.16 exhibited overpotential of 32 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalysts. In consideration of the water dissociation property of the Ru–CN structure and the relatively high price of Ru, it is meaningful to further reduce the particle size of Ru and improve the atomic utilization of Ru. In this regard, Feng and coworkers prepared single Ru atoms in an N-doped carbon matrix via the calcination of Ru3+ and polyaniline complex precursor on graphite foam (Ru/NC) under N2 protection.77 The obtained Ru/NC catalyst exhibited a geometric current density of 10 mA cm−2 and mass current density of 8 A mgRu−1 with overpotentials of 21 mV and 100 mV, respectively. Moreover, the TOF value of RU/NC was 4.55 s−1, which was 3.2 times higher than that of commercial Pt catalysts. Recently, new insights were obtained with regard to accelerating water dissociation kinetics and obtaining optimal hydroxyl adsorption via isolating Co atoms into the Ru lattice. Li and coworkers found that the energy barrier for water dissociation on a single RuCo1 surface was 19.28 kcal mol−1, which is much lower than that on the Ru surface (26.48 kcal mol−1), RuCo2 surface (23.01 kcal mol−1), and RuCo3 surface (21.89 kcal mol−1), as shown in Fig. 5d.78 Such sluggish water dissociation kinetics can be attributed to the increased OH− binding energy that results from the enhanced electron density at the saddle points around the Co atom. Therefore, OH− adsorbs on the active sites and blocks the consequent reaction. With the optimal balancing of HO–H cleavage and OH− affinity, the prepared Co-substituted Ru nanosheets yielded an alkaline HER current density of 10 mA cm−2 with low overpotential of 13 mV and Tafel slope of 29 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5e and f). As mentioned above, either water dissociation or hydrogen binding energy is important for both alkaline HER processes. With an appropriate hydrogen binding energy, catalysts can efficiently adsorb H intermediates and then release H2 molecules, promoting Heyrovsky, Volmer, or Tafel steps. Based on this mechanism, Chen and coworkers developed RuCo bimetallic alloy coated with N-doped graphene layers, which showed low overpotentials of 28 and 218 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA−2, respectively.79 The reason for the high alkaline HER activity was that the C–H bond was enhanced because of the high electronic density of the graphene shell with the RuCo alloy core, which further rationally decreased the hydrogen binding energy. Surprisingly, such materials could effectively act as an alkaline HER electrocatalyst and lower the cost by not necessitating the use of noble metals, facilitating promising industrial applications. Furthermore, Liu and coworkers synthesized hybrid RuCoP with a hydrogen binding energy similar to those of Pt catalysts and suitable water/OH− adsorption energy. Facilitated by the synergistic effects, hybrid RuCoP clusters exhibited low overpotentials of 11 and 23 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH electrolytes, respectively.80 In addition, other Ru-based materials were further synthesized, such as RuO2/NiO hybrid nanosheets,81 NiCoP@Ru nanoparticles,82 Ru–MoO2 nanocomposites,83 ligand-capped Ru nanoparticles,73 and hollow Cu2−xSRu structures.84 All of them exhibited highly efficient alkaline and acidic HER activities.

3.1.3 Pd-Based materials. 
Pd has certain significance with regard to water splitting applications owing to the lower cost of Pd than Pt electrodes. Pd is also a worthwhile hydrogen host and serves as a model system of H absorption and desorption.85 In this regard, Pd-based materials are a promising alternative for use in water reduction. As proven in earlier works, hydrogen binding energy can be the single description of HER activity both in acidic and alkaline media.47 Barman and coworkers synthesized porous Pd–CNx composites via the reduction of PdCl2 in the presence of CNx nanosheets with NaBH4. The Pd–CNx catalysts exhibit onset potential of 12 mV and Tafel slope of 35 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, while the onset potential (75 mV) and Tafel slope (110 mV dec−1) were much larger in 0.5 M KOH solution. The HER activity declined as the solution pH increased in relation to the increased hydrogen binding energy.86 However, it still faced the problem of sluggish kinetics in alkaline electrolytes due to the additional water dissociation step. Therefore, the construction of multiple sites was further employed on Pd-based materials. Xu and coworkers prepared core–shell Pd/FeOx(OH)2−2x nanoparticles, exhibiting a volcano-shaped correlation after plotting the HER activity as a function of FeOx(OH)2−2x coverage, which achieved an effective balance between the water dissociation and hydrogen formation steps, as shown in Fig. 6a and b. The CV curves further revealed that H adsorption/desorption signals on Pd (0.2–0.6 V vs. RHE) were weaker than those on the Pd/FeOx(OH)2−2x surface, further confirming the fast process of water cleavage and H transfer.87 Furthermore, it was feasible to design HER electrocatalysts in multiple pH conditions via hydrogen binding energy regulation and construction of multiple sites. Wong and coworkers, thereafter, synthesized flower-like NiCo2S4/Pd structures, which exhibited lower overpotentials of 87 and 83 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively (Fig. 6c and d).88 However, pure Pd and NiCo2S4 catalysts required overpotentials of 175/385 mV and 247/226 mV, respectively. To better configure the electronic structure and adjust the adsorption energy of the reactants/intermediates/products, an alloy structure is the ideal formation.89 For example, Štrbac and coworkers successfully decreased the adsorption energy of hydrogen intermediates with strong interaction between the Pd islands and Au substrate. To achieve these results, they deposited several different Pd nanoislands on the Au substrate and then studied the correlation between different types of structures and hydrogen evolution activity.90 Moreover, other alloy structures have also been reported to improve the alkaline HER activity, such as rGO–PdAu, Au2Pd6/MoS2 nanoclusters, and so on. With regard to rGO–PdAu catalysts, they yielded overpotential of 80 mV and Tafel slope of 149 mV dec−1, which were better than those for rGO–FePd catalysts.91 Zhu and coworkers also combined MoS2 and atomically precise Au2Pd6 to boost the alkaline HER activity, which provided further insights into performance enhancement. The obtained Au2Pd6-modified MoS2 exhibited a reduction of 91 mV in overpotential and 0.31 mV dec−1 Tafel slope as compared to those for pure MoS2. The DFT results also showed that Au2Pd6–MoS2 (−0.01 eV) exhibited optimal H adsorption that was better than those of Au2Pd6 (−0.04 eV) and MoS2 (1.83 eV), which facilitated the adsorption of H intermediates and release of H2.92 Overall, located at the top of the volcano, Pd exhibited appropriate H adsorption energy. Therefore, Pd-based materials are promising for acidic as well as alkaline HER with catalyst design inspired by different reaction mechanisms, such as Pd–metal alloy, Pd/support hybrid, core–shell structure, and so on.

3.1.4 Nonprecious materials. 
Apart from noble-metal-based HER electrocatalysts, earth-abundant materials have been largely used in alkaline media.93–99 In addition, several efforts have been devoted toward developing various strategies for the design of active structures based on alkaline media, such as components,100 interfaces,101 and defects.62 Facilitated by geometric and electronic constructions, the reaction kinetics (including water adsorption/dissociation, hydrogen adsorption/desorption, and OH− desorption) could be correspondingly accelerated.
In alkaline media, water adsorption is the first step, playing a critical role in high-alkaline HER. To promote this step, Zhang and coworkers prepared metallic Ni0.89Co0.11Se2via Co doping at an optimal level.102 The resulting specific electronic structure decreased the energy barrier for the adsorption of H2O as well as H intermediates in acidic media, making it an ideal HER electrocatalyst in the all-pH range. Similarly, several works, such as those involving NiPS and Se–NiCoS(OH) nanosheets, involved preparation using facile hydrophilic materials and improved water adsorption ability.103,104 To improve alkaline water dissociation, Yang and coworkers introduced Mn3O4 into metallic Ni through a one-pot hydrothermal method to improve the alkaline HER activity.105 Among them, Mn3O4 could promote water dissociation and generate H intermediates (Had) and then Had could adsorb on the nearby Ni sites and recombine into molecular hydrogen. With accelerated HER kinetics, the prepared Ni–Mn3O4 anchored on Ni foam exhibited overpotential of 91 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Recently, Feng and coworkers prepared a novel hybrid structure comprising atomically dispersed Ni–Nx species on a porous carbon matrix with embedded Ni nanoparticles (Ni NP|Ni–N–C) via the pyrolysis of dicyandiamide and Ni ions followed by an acid etching treatment.106 It was observed that Ni NP|Ni–N–C delivered small overpotential of 147 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 as well as low Tafel slope of 114 mV dec−1 (Fig. 7a and b). Both experimental and theoretical results revealed that Ni nanoparticles tailored the surface states of Ni–Nx sites such that OH− adsorption and lower water dissociation barrier were promoted (Fig. 7c and d). As mentioned earlier, transition metal phosphides (such as CoP, Ni2P, and MoP) have attracted considerable attention due to their efficient HER activities. Moreover, controlling the chemical compositions is considered to be a crucial method to design high-activity catalysts. In this regard, Hu and coworkers reported a bimetallic-structured phosphide electrocatalyst, namely, NiCo2Px. Self-supported NiCoOx nanowire arrays were prepared on commercial carbon felt by a wet chemical-hydrothermal route combined with the phosphorization reaction.107 In 1 M KOH electrolyte, NiCo2Px only required overpotential of 58 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that of CoPx (94 mV), NiPx (180 mV), and commercial Pt (70 mV). They proposed that undercoordinated Ni/Co centers would bond with O atoms; meanwhile, the dangling P atom would bond with H atoms. Therefore, molecular water would break down because of these two interactions and then dissociate into H atoms and OH−, releasing a free electron. The H atom further transferred onto a nearby vacant metal site anchored as adsorbed H, which further recombined into molecular H2. A similar phenomenon was also discovered in Ni-based materials, as shown in Fig. 7e. Mukerjee and coworkers reported Ni–Cr/C electrocatalysts with high mass activity for HER in 0.1 M KOH solution.108 The onset potential of HER was significantly improved as compared to other Ni alloys. This high activity was likely promoted by Ni/NiO sites and metallic Ni sites. The former performed as a sink for OHad, and the latter performed as a sink for Had. Moreover, NiOx species could be stabilized with the existence of the Cr2O3 phase and the induced Ni/NiOx interface facilitated H–OH cleavage and reduced the energy barrier of hydrogen evolution. Interestingly, interface engineering can also influence the balance of H adsorption and H2 desorption, consequently affecting the HER performance. It has been generally reported that the adsorption of H intermediates on active sites (Volmer reaction) was the RDS for several HER catalysts. From the viewpoint of thermodynamics, the ideal value of free energy for Had is zero, exhibiting a good balance between Had and H2 desorption. In this regard, Feng and coworkers constructed Ni3Se2 and Co9S8 interfaces through Ni–S binding.94 These electrocatalysts delivered overpotentials of 170 and 230 mV to achieve current densities of 20 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. The free energies of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGHad) were 0.42 and −0.31 eV for the S site of Co9S8 and Ni site of Ni3Se2, respectively. However, on the interface of the Ni3Se2/Co9S8 hybrid, these values dropped to 0.28 and −0.12 eV, respectively, leading to enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution performance. From the above typical samples, it could be concluded that earth-abundant materials have promising potential for alkaline hydrogen production. To better improve their performance, effective strategies, including metal alloying, interface construction, composition optimization, morphologies design, etc., are predominantly required for active surface structure and intrinsic conductivity with the guidance of clear mechanism concepts.

3.2 OER catalysts in alkaline media
The OER is often the rate-limiting step because of the sluggish kinetics associated with the O–H bond breaking and the consequent OO bond formation, as well as the 4-electron–proton-coupled process. The development of active and stable OER electrocatalysts is, therefore, imperative to improve the overall water splitting performance.109–115 Over the past few decades, various strategies have been devised toward the design of efficient OER materials from the aspects of binding energy modulation, electronic structure optimization, and surface engineering. In addition, the lattice oxygen mechanism has also been proposed and observed on several metal oxides, which further lowered the overpotential for oxygen evolution. Herein, we provide a review based on recent studies on OER catalyst development; recent OER electrocatalysts are listed in Table 2.

3.2.1 Binding energy optimization. 
With regard to the M–OH binding energy, the fundamental research dates back to 1955 when Rüetschi and Delahay found that the overvoltage decreases in a linear manner with an increase in the M–OH bond energy on Ag, Au, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Pd, and Pt surfaces.116 In view of phase transformation, Trasatti considered the enthalpy of lower-to-higher reaction (MOx + 1/2O2 → MOx+1) as the descriptor and then associated the volcano relationship between (MOx–MOx+1) and OER activity.117 As a result, precious metal oxides, such as IrO2 and RuO2, at the top of the volcano plot and transition metal oxides exhibited the order MnO2 > NiO > Co3O4 > Fe3O4. Considering all the OER intermediates (M–OH, M–O, and M–OOH), Rossmeisl and coworkers first provided a detailed picture of the reaction process on Pd/Au surfaces and found that the potential was restricted by the formation of HOO* species if the oxygen is bound too strongly, while the potential was limited by the oxidation of HO* if the binding of oxygen was too weak. In particular, they revealed that both Pt and Au surfaces bind O too strongly such that the formation of OOH* became the RDS. In addition, the scaling relationship could be effectively established between the binding energies of ΔGO* − ΔGHO* and ΔGHOO* − ΔGO* on the s series of metal surfaces.53 To establish a similar relationship on metal oxide surfaces, Rossmeisl and coworkers further calculated the binding energies of O*, HO*, and HOO* on three rutile-type oxide (RuO2, IrO2, and TiO2) surfaces. The results revealed that strong O* binding also resulted in strong HO* and HOO* bindings; therefore, the O* binding energy could be a single parameter.54 Subsequently, a universal scaling relationship between HO* and HOO* was found for all the studied materials, including rutile, perovskite, spinel, rock salt, and bixbyite oxides. They found that the difference between HO* and HOO* was always approximately 3.2 eV. Therefore, they further introduced a single descriptor (ΔGO* − ΔGHO*) to formulate the volcano plot: SrCoO3 and RuO2 were at the top of the volcano with a (ΔGO* − ΔGHO*) value of about 1.6 eV.118 However, the basic understanding of the elementary steps in OER is still deficient, and the guidance for the design of active sites of OER catalysts is also unclear without a specific catalyst surface. In this regard, Markovic and coworkers studied near monolayer (oxy)hydroxide films on single-crystal Pt supports and established the HO–M2+δ binding energy (0 < δ < 1.5) as the descriptor, where δ = 1 refers to the MOOH states for the OER region. The relationship exhibited the trend of OER activity as Mn < Fe < Co < Ni, which could be attributed to the maximum activity of Ni hydr(oxy)oxides for CO bulk oxidation owing to neither too strong nor too weak OH binding energy.119 To achieve near-optimal HO* energetics for OER, Sargent and coworkers designed atomically homogeneous FeCoW oxyhydroxides, exhibiting low overpotential of 191 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 500 h stability.120 The corresponding information is shown in Fig. 8. Their study showed that the adsorption energy of HO* was too weak on CoOOH and WO3 surfaces, whereas it was too strong on the FeOOH surface. Moreover, they also found that either adding Co into WO3 or adding W into CoOOH would lead to an average HO* adsorption energy of CoWO4 and W-doped CoOOH. They further estimated that the Co–Fe–W system would be formed in the near-optimal HO* energies for OER. Firstly, ΔGHO* and ΔGO* − ΔGHO* at the Co site could be rationalized by the deviation in the electron affinity between Co4+ and Fe3+. In addition, W doping would not only transfer a proton away from W6+ to the oxygen at the Co site but also produce compressive strain around the Co site, which further promoted oxygen evolution. Shi and coworkers used N doping to alter the electronic structure of the Co atom in CoS in addition to the energy barrier of OER, which exhibited small overpotential of 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In particular, the electron would transfer from the Co to N atom and cause the higher-oxidation state of the electron-deficient Co atom. With regard to the RDS of MO to MOOH, N-doped CoS could lower the free energy to 2.22 eV, which is smaller than that of pure CoS (2.34 eV), suggesting favorable OER performance.121 Recently, to achieve an optimal M–OH bond, Hu and coworkers prepared amorphous cobalt vanadium oxides (a-CoVOx) since CoOx and VOx are located at two opposite sides.122,123 With the optimal ratio of Co:V, the prepared a-Co0.75V0.25Ox was located at the top of the volcano and exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotential of 254 mV and low Tafel slope (35 mV dec−1).124 Yang and coworkers also designed a metallic Ni2P(O)/Fe2P(O) interface to enhance the OER performance and the obtained catalysts exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotential of 179 mV and low Tafel slope (42.7 mV dec−1). The surface phosphates could function as a proton-coupled electron transfer mediator and doped oxyhydroxides could promote MOOH formation, which further reduced the energy barrier of oxygen evolution.27

3.2.2 Electronic structure modulation. 
The electronic structure of metal oxides has been successfully described by molecular orbital principles, such as the d-band structure, eg occupancy, and O p-band center.125 Bockris and Otagawa found an inverse relationship between the numbers of d electrons in transition metal and the enthalpy of hydroxide formation; therefore, an increase in the number of outer electrons would weaken the M–OH binding strength.123 With the assistance of DFT calculations, Koper and coworkers further established a scale trend for the binding strength of OER intermediates and d-electron numbers and oxidation states.126 Further, eg occupancy was another electronic descriptor for OER electrocatalysts. Shao-Horn and coworkers reported a near-unity eg occupancy of surface transition metal ions, and high covalency in bonding to oxygen could improve the oxygen evolution activity of perovskite transition metal oxides (Fig. 9a).127 This was because the σ-bonding eg orbital might overlap with the O-related adsorbate than the π-bonding t2g orbital, which enhanced the electron transfer from the surface cations to the adsorbed intermediates. Furthermore, orbital localization could be induced by lowering the site symmetry and then modulate the surface electronic state. In their study, they found that Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) were located at the top sites of the volcano with the highest OER activity among all the studied oxides, as shown in Fig. 9b. The high oxygen evolution performance could be attributed to the t52ge∼1.2g electronic configuration of the Co cations of BSCF. However, the unstable BSCF particles would change into the amorphous phase during the OER process, while the balance between activity and stability is also important for OER catalysts. Thereafter, Shao-Horn and coworkers further reported that (Ln0.5Ba0.5)CoO3−δ exhibited the highest OER activity (Fig. 9c and d). Among them, (Pr0.5Ba0.5)CoO3−δ even performed better than BSCF.128 This study showed that the O p-band center could be used as a parameter to describe the OER activity and stability of double perovskite oxides. The position of the bulk O p-band center was strongly correlated with the oxygen surface exchange kinetics.129 DFT calculation results showed that moving the O p-band center closer to the Fermi level can increase the OER activities, while a considerable movement would decrease the oxide stabilities during the OER process. Such a development in combination with computational quantum and experimental nanotechnologies have brought about novel insights into the electrochemistry of OER processes at the atomic/molecular level, facilitating the formulation of promising strategies to create highly active oxide catalysts for OER to enable the large-scale application of water splitting. Recently, Qiao and coworkers constructed a series of molecule-level g-C3N4-coordinated transition metals as new M–N/C materials (Co–N/C, Ni–N/C, and Fe–N/C) for oxygen electrodes. DFT calculations showed that the catalytic ability was improved by the appropriate d-band position of the catalysts.130 A linear scaling relationship was achieved between the adsorption energies of O* and HO* or O* and HOO*, which could be attributed to the d-band position of M–N/C. Consider HO* as an example: strong HO* adsorption was caused by a high d-band center, while weak HO* adsorption was caused by the low d-band center, further demonstrating the role of the electronic structure.120 Huang and coworkers prepared double perovskite LaFexNi1−xO3 with Ni/Fe ratio of 8:2, exhibiting low overpotential of 302 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and low Tafel slope (50 mV dec−1). The higher hybridization between the transition metal 3d and O 2-p states yielded higher binding energy between the catalysts and adsorbed species. With the introduction of Fe into LaNiO3, the TM–O binding strength could be enhanced and electron transfer would be promoted, boosting the OER performance.131 To further tune the electronic structure in metal oxides, Park and coworkers synthesized oxygen-deficient triple perovskite Nd1.5Ba1.5CoFeMnO9−δ (NBCFM) on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) with a trilayer of single perovskite structures, as shown in Fig. 10a. The obtained products exhibited an oxygen-defect-enriched structure, fast charge transfer ability, and small hybridization of O 2-p and Co d orbitals. With regard to OER performance (Fig. 10b), NBCFM showed lower overpotential of 350 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and lower Tafel slope (81 mV dec−1) than those for Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF; 395 mV/86 mV dec−1) and NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (NBSCF; 374 mV/84 mV dec−1). The higher OER activity could be attributed to the oxygen deficiency and electronic construction. On one hand, numerous oxygen vacancies would act as charge species and improve charge transfer between the adsorbate and adsorbent. On the other hand, the small hybridization strength between O 2-p and Co 3d promoted the O p-band to the Fermi energy level, and therefore, enhanced the oxygen evolution ability, as shown in Fig. 10c.132 Recently, Liu and coworkers prepared a double perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (PBSCF) nanofiber. The computed Gibbs free energy showed that the step of HO* to O* was the potential-determining step and PBSCF. Furthermore, the lower Co oxidation states also almost optimized the eg electron filling on the surface and lowered the energy barrier for oxygen evolution. As a result, the obtained PBSCF with an optimal structure could exhibit a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotential of 358 mV and Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1, which were lower than those for the IrO2 catalysts (Fig. 10d–f).133

3.2.3 Lattice oxygen participation. 
Earlier, Heitbaum investigated the role of the oxide layer and oxygen evolution on Ru-based materials with 18O and found that 16O18O evolved on RuO2 in H218O solution and also evolved on the Ru oxide layer formed in the H218O solution.134 This observation could be explained by the direct oxygen evolution mechanism (M + H2O → M–OH + H+ + e−; 2M–OH → M–O + M + H2O; 2M–O → 2M + O2), where oxygen came from both H2O and RuO2. Moreover, a similar phenomenon was also observed on Ru0.9Ni0.1O2−δ,135 IrO2,136 and Co–Pi137 catalysts. The role of the lattice oxygen participation was further employed in perovskite oxides in view of their fast bulk diffusion rates and surface exchange kinetics. Bockris and Otagawa proposed that the surface O2− ions of oxides could accept a proton from water and form OH− and then the lattice OH− and adsorbed OH− would form adsorbed H2O2 and thereafter generate O2.138 In this regard, Stevenson and coworkers prepared phase-pure, catalytically active LaNiO3 catalysts with weak lattice oxygen bonds supported on N-doped carbon (NC). Therefore, the lattice (hydr)oxide of LaNiO3 would participate in the formation of adsorbed hydroperoxides during the OER cycles involving the formation of OH, O2−, and OOH− intermediates.139 The formation rate of HOO− intermediates would increase with a higher concentration of lattice oxygen, while the formed oxygen vacancies were filled by aqueous OH−. Moreover, facilitated by the nanostructure and conductive NC support, the obtained nsLaNiO3–NC catalyst exhibited a current density of 89 mA mg−1, higher than that of the IrO2 benchmark (36 mA mg−1). Thereafter, Stevenson and coworkers further prepared a series of LaBO3 perovskites (B = Ni, Ni0.75Fe0.25, Co, and Mn) with Tafel slopes of 42, 44, 51, and 145 mV dec−1, respectively, further confirming the abovementioned mechanism.140 Recently, Grimaud and coworkers observed surface reconstruction and Ir migration from the bulk to surface using La2LiIrO6 as a model catalyst. Their work suggested that active surface oxygen atoms could act as electrophilic centers to attract water–oxygen lone pairs. Interestingly, they also proposed a novel OER mechanism involving the lattice oxygen in catalysts, which participate in the migration from bulk to surface for filling the surface vacancies after O–O species form molecular O2.141 Based on this point, Shao-Horn and coworkers directly determined that O2 produced during the OER process on some highly active oxides could come from the lattice oxygen via in situ18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry.142 In their work, they used online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) to detect the lattice 18O of Co-based perovskites with different metal–oxygen covalency (LaCoO3, La0.5Sr0.5CoO3−δ, and Pr0.5Ba0.5CoO3−δ) in a 0.1 M KOH solution of H216O using cyclic voltammetry (CV). As a result, O2 with different molecular weights (16O16O, 16O18O, and 18O18O) generated during the OER was measured by in situ mass spectroscopy. In particular, they discussed the reaction mechanism involving the oxidation of lattice oxygen and concerted proton–electron transfer to explain the formation of 34O and 36O, as shown in Fig. 11a. With regard to 34O, the first three steps were involved in the proton–electron transfer on metal sites followed by 34O evolution and oxygen vacancy formation, as well as a subsequent proton–electron transfer step to regenerate the O–M–OH surface. A likely mechanism for 36O consisted of two main chemical steps, which create an O–O bond; subsequently, molecular oxygen form lattice oxygen sites via the formation of two oxygen defects. Thereafter, this occurred with two proton–electron transfers for filling the surface oxygen vacancies and two proton–electron processes for deprotonating the surface oxygen ions. Such different OER mechanisms largely rely on covalency (the deprotonation of surface hydroxyl groups) and oxygen sites could be activated when the Fermi level becomes pinned to the top of the O 2-p band for highly covalent oxides, resulting in electronic states near the Fermi level with substantial O 2-p characteristics. Different from the above results, Kolpak and coworkers proposed a new lattice oxygen participation mechanism on LaNiO3 and a series of ABO3 catalysts.143 In the lattice oxygen mechanism, OH− would first adsorb on the surface Ni site and the formed Ni–O species would transfer into Ni–OO species with oxygen vacancies by forming a bond with the nearby lattice oxygen. Secondly, the formed –OO species changed back into –OH and released O2 and e−. After that, aqueous OH− filled the oxygen vacancies and was protonated and adsorbed on the nearby lattice oxygen, as shown in Fig. 11b. Thereafter, the initial surface would form after deprotonation. This mechanism also revealed a relationship between the bulk stability and surface protonation concentration and strength. The increasing bulk oxygen vacancy decreased the material stability and could result in cation leaching and surface amorphization, which could be detected in several OER-active perovskites such as Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3−δ. However, inert OER did not undergo amorphization transformation.144 In addition, Jones and coworkers further investigated amorphization in IrOx catalysts. With the removal of Ir4+ and e−, holes could localize around the adjacent oxygen atoms and result in electron deficiencies on oxygen (O1−). These O1− species adsorbed on the surface and subsurface of IrOx catalysts and played an important role in O–O bond formation, which reduced the energy barrier of oxygen evolution.123 Furthermore, lattice participation is also suitable for spinel oxides. Recently, Xu and coworkers determined phase instability by activating lattice oxygen in ZnCoxNi2−xO4, leading to surface active oxyhydroxides. Facilitated by the optimal O 2-p band and metal d-band center, the obtained ZnCo1.2Ni0.8O4 catalysts even exhibited superior performance than the IrO2 benchmark.145

3.2.4 Surface reconstruction. 
In detail, the rapid surface reconstruction occurring for certain oxide catalysts during OER may involve multiple steps, including water adsorption, oxygen release, catalyst degradation, and cation dissolution (lattice oxygen evolution, redeposition, and amorphous surface formation) Therefore, the complexity of surface dynamics and poor knowledge of the kinetics associated with each step hindered our understanding of the OER process.146 Catalyst stability can either be represented by changes in the activity of the catalyst or by a more direct measure of the physicochemical properties of the catalysts (dissolution of the active component or agglomeration). Sometimes, catalyst dissolution creates a rougher surface with more active sites exposed to the electrolyte. Initial catalyst dissolution even creates more active catalyst structures (such as the core–shell structure from the initial dealloying process). Initial compositional instability manifests itself through an increase in activity. Apart from the sluggish OER kinetics, catalyst stability is another important challenge for commercial water splitting because many materials would experience severe structure corrosion and collapse after long-term OER processes.147 Therefore, the development of stable OER catalysts has also been researched over the past few decades. It is important to have a clear understanding of surface chemistry and consequently design active and stable OER catalysts. Herein, several strategies have also been proposed to maintain catalyst stability, such as doping strategies, morphology design, supporter optimization, and so on.
With regard to OER benchmark, IrO2 and RuO2 also suffer from instability. Cherevko and coworkers have found that RuO2 would transform into the hydrous compound RuO2(OH)2 and then get deprotonated into a higher oxidation state, namely, RuO4, under anodic conditions. The formed RuO2 was not stable in the electrolyte and then dissolved into a solution.148 IrO2 would experience a similar process during the OER process.149 However, early observations found that the enrichment of Ir on the surface of IrRu oxides would segregate and protect Ru from dissolution, thereby improving the stability. Moreover, Ir- and Ru-based oxides have also been investigated in mixtures with each other. In earlier works, bimetallic oxide systems such as RuxIr1−xO2 could significantly suppress deterioration and maintain the OER activity.150,151 Audichon and coworkers further synthesized a core–shell-like IrO2@RuO2 material with a high amount of active sites and accessibility for water molecules, which exhibited not only lower overpotential (300 mV) but also 96.7% stability (maintained even after 1000 cycles).152 Strasser and coworkers further constructed dealloyed metal-oxide IrNi@IrOx nanoparticles from IrNix precursor alloys through selective surface Ni dealloying and controlled surface oxidation of Ir. The obtained IrNi@IrOx exhibited a three-fold catalytic activity enhancement for oxygen evolution over IrO2 and RuO2, as well as an improvement in the intrinsic turnover frequency.153 As mentioned earlier, another strategy involves the well-known use of suitable corrosion-resistant high-surface-area and conductive supporters. Therefore, Strasser and coworkers further supported IrNi@IrOx nanoparticles on high-surface-area mesoporous antimony-doped tin oxide (IrNiOx/meso-ATO), exhibiting 20 h durability (Fig. 12a and b).154 Such a core–shell catalysts/oxide support concept provided a general strategy to reduce the amount of scarce Ir elements. The dealloying strategy was also employed to prepare highly conductive nanoporous architectures of iridium oxide shells on a metallic IrOx shell on a metallic Ir core, which were formed via the fast dealloying of Os from an Ir25Os75 alloy. This yielded a 30-fold improvement in the activity–stability factor in relation to conventional Ir-based oxide materials.155 A similar case has also been found in SrIrO3 electrocatalysts. Jaramillo and coworkers reported an IrOx/SrIrO3 catalyst via electrochemical testing by Sr leaching from the surface layers of thin films of SrIrO3 and a minor surface rearrangement of the resultant IrOx films (Fig. 12d). Their DFT results suggested that highly active surface layers were formed during Sr leaching from IrO3 or anatase IrO2 motifs (Fig. 12c). Theoretical results showed that the removal of the third layer of Sr could reduce the overpotential value to 0.28 V, which was much lower than that of the IrO3 film (0.47 eV) after filling the vacant (100) planes with oxygen as well as anatase overlayer (0.78 V).156 Structural self-reconstruction was also investigated by using nonnoble materials. Song and coworkers developed a new class of OER precatalyst, namely, Co2(OH)3Cl, and demonstrated that the etching of lattice Cl− would trigger phase reconstruction, approaching a stable state. After 100 cycles of CV etching activation, stable β-COOH catalysts exhibited numerous structural defects and offered several unsaturated coordination sites for direct O2 evolution. The activated Co2(OH)3Cl catalysts reached a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 270 mV overpotential and mass activities of 214.8 A g−1 at 300 mV overpotential, outperforming the performance of the IrO2 benchmark.157

4. Alkaline water splitting
4.1 Water splitting electrocatalysts
In practice, hydrogen and oxygen evolutions undergo two different reaction processes; this poses challenges for most materials since highly active HER catalysts might be inactive toward OER.158 Therefore, it is important to develop bifunctional HER/OER catalysts that can lower manufacturing costs and simplify the overall system design, and consequently, reduce the cost of hydrogen production.159 In this regard, tremendous efforts have been devoted toward designing efficient bifunctional HER/OER catalysts.160–167 With the guidance of the structure–activity relationship at the atomic level, advanced catalysts have been correspondingly developed. Here, we provide a brief summary on the recent developments on bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts, which was a focus on the construction of active sites and how they favor kinetic energy barrier with optimized adsorption and desorption of water molecules or intermediates species (*H for HER; *O, *OH, and *OOH for OER). Recent advances in the overall water splitting electrocatalysts are listed in Table 3.

Recently, transition metal compounds have been largely employed as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting, such as metal oxides/hydroxides,168,169 phosphides,170 sulfides,171 selenides,172,173 and so on. Defect engineering has been extensively performed to introduce the active phase in catalysts.174–176 Consider metal oxides as an example: single-layer MnO2 nanosheets exhibited half-metallic characteristic with doped Mn or O vacancies.177 Zhang and coworkers, therefore, synthesized bifunctional monolayer β-MnO2 (NS-MnO2) nanosheet arrays on nickel foam via the in situ hydrothermal method.178 The prepared NS-MnO2 showed low overpotentials for HER and OER (197 and 320 mV) at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slopes of 62 and 40 mV dec−1, respectively. Experimental results showed that NS-MnO2 contained abundant oxygen vacancies and associated Mn3+ active sites. Moreover, with the existence of Mn3+, HER could be promoted via the oxidation of Mn3+ to Mn4+ (Mn3+ + H2O → Mn4+ + 1/2H2 + OH−), and OER (4Mn3+ + 4OH− → 4Mn2+ + O2 + 2H2O) could be promoted via the disproportionation of Mn3+ to Mn2+ and Mn4+. Theoretical results further suggested strong water adsorption and semimetal properties of Vo-MnO2 with the total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) close to zero. Although defect engineering considerably enhanced the catalysts’ performance, the poor stability of defects is still a problem. In view of the poor stability of defects, Wang and coworkers proposed a defect-filling strategy. In particular, they synthesized P-filling Ov-Co3O4 (P-Co3O4) via the in situ treatment of Co3O4 with Ar plasma in the presence of the P precursor (Fig. 13a).179 As shown in Fig. 13b and c, the formed P-Co3O4 has a favorable adsorption energy of hydrogen (ΔGH*) of −0.08 eV, which is much smaller than those of Ov-Co3O4 (−0.28 eV) and Co3O4 (−0.23 eV). Oxygen vacancy and P filling further exhibited the RDS of OOH* to O2, and therefore, reduced the theoretical overpotentials to 0.42 and 0.39 V, respectively. However, pristine Co3O4 needed larger theoretical overpotential of 0.47 V and the RDS of O* to OOH*. In addition, the filling of P in the oxygen vacancy resulted in the production of additional Co2+ after electron transfer out of the Co 3d states, which modified the electronic properties as well as enhanced the electronic conductivity. Finally, the obtained P-Co3O4 exhibited marvelous water splitting performance. Inversely, oxygen atoms could also act as a dopant to regulate the electronic structure of transition metal phosphides. Li and coworkers synthesized a series of transition metal phosphides via treatment with phytic acid-crosslinked metal complexes.180 The oxygen atom in MoP not only improved the electronic conductivity but also elongated the M–P bond. The O-doped MP exhibited efficient HER activity with Gibbs free energy close to zero, yielding enhanced *H adsorption and H2 desorption. Moreover, they also found that the elongated Co–P bond further shifted the electron localization to the P sites and facilitated the conversion of Co to active Co3+ species, promoting the OER performance. As a result, a low voltage of 1.6 V drove a current density of 40 mA cm−2 for the overall water splitting. Apart from the above merits, the construction of active sites via heteroatom introduction could also introduce phase transitions. Zheng and coworkers found that MoS2 would change from the 2H to 1T phase with Ir adsorption. The produced Ir/MoS2 displayed good electrical conductivity, high hydrophilicity, and considerable heterojunction interfaces, which synergistically promoted the current densities to 10 and 20 mA cm−2 at cell voltages of only 1.57 and 1.62 V, respectively.181 As mentioned before, interface engineering provides another method for the construction of active sites. Recently, Xi and coworkers reported N-NiMoO4/NiS2 nanowires/nanosheets with abundant epitaxial heterogeneous interfaces, which facilitated the electron transfer from N-NiMoO4 to NiS2 that subsequently participated in H2/O2 evolution.182 Simply, Li and coworkers also demonstrated that the heterointerface of Ni(OH)2/Ni3S2 could promote the water dissociation step and OH− adsorption of HER, as well as maintain the OER activity.183

Generally, the catalytic activity is determined by both number and intrinsic activity of the active sites.184 Tremendous efforts have been devoted toward enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity via composition tailoring, heteroatom doping, defects engineering, interface optimization, or improving the density of active sites via morphological designs, size tuning, etc..104,185–187 Recently, amorphization has become a promising strategy for electrocatalyst design with the merits of high active-site density.188 For instance, Dong and coworkers grew 2D amorphous FePO4 nanosheets on Ni foam (Am FePO4/NF). These 2D nanosheets maximized the electrochemical active sites and the amorphous structure further provided more active sites for complete water splitting.189 Am FePO4/NF could facilitate oxygen evolution and maintain hydrogen evolution performance, too (Fig. 13d). Intrinsically, a disorder in amorphous FePO2 also has low-energy-level d-band center and decreased binding strengths of OH*, O*, and OOH* of the OER process with the RDS of OOH* formation (1.72 eV). However, the OH* formation step (2.02 eV) was the RDS for crystal FePO4, as shown in Fig. 13e and f. Such a strategy employing the amorphous characteristics was also employed in the CoNi hybrid, which was combined with 1T-MoS2via hydrazine-induced phase transformation. The obtained catalysts exhibited overpotentials of 70 and 235 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, it could also maintain 48 h stability at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and voltage of 1.44 V (Fig. 13g–i).190 Aiming at the high performance of bifunctional HER/OER catalysts, various strategies have been developed to improve the density and activity of active sites combined with an understanding of the intrinsic mechanism. Inevitably, industrial applications are still challenging; it is continuously endeavored to develop new materials and novel synthesis strategies and electrolysis devices, too.
4.2 Water splitting cell configuration
Apart from the viewpoint of electrocatalyst design, the water splitting cell configuration is also important for industrial hydrogen production. With regard to low-temperature water electrolysis techniques, alkaline and polymer electrolyte membranes are the two typical categories.191 Recently, water electrolysis using an anion exchange membrane (AEM) has also been developed owing to its low cost because of the use of nonprecious transition metal catalysts.192 These three water electrolysis devices are shown in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  Schematics of (a) alkaline water electrolysis, (b) PEM water electrolysis, and (c) AEM water electrolysis.197 Copyright 2018 Elsevier B. V. 
In alkaline electrolysis, Ni- and Co-based oxides are the most commonly used anode and cathode materials, respectively. Further, the most commonly used electrolyte is 30–40% KOH solution, which circulates through the electrode to create an alkaline environment.193 The anode and cathode are immersed in liquid KOH electrolyte, and the two chambers are separated by a porous diaphragm that transports OH− but not H2 and O2. The diaphragms are produced by ceramic oxides, such as asbestos and potassium titanate or polymers.194 Industrial alkaline electrochemical water splitting operates at a current density of around 400 mA cm−2 within the voltage range from 1.85 to 2.2 V. The conversion efficiencies could reach up to 60–80% within a moderate temperature range of 70–90 °C. The main advantages of alkaline electrolysis are low cost and long-term stability owing to the use of nonprecious electrodes. Most of the reported works are also adopted in this cell configuration to evaluate the water splitting performance. Typically, a two-electrode system, whose anode and cathode consist of active catalysts, is assembled. Then, a cell voltage is tested at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in addition to affording long-term stability.
With regard to PEM electrolysis, IrO2/C and Pt/C are the classical anode and cathode materials, respectively. A Nafion membrane is employed as a solid electrolyte rather than a liquid electrolyte. The role of the membrane is to conduct H+ between cathode and anode as well as separate the produced H2 and O2.12 The current density could reach 2000 mA cm−2 at 90 °C at a cell voltage of 2.1 V.195 Owing to the fast ion transportation in an acidic solution and high performance of electrode materials, the kinetics of the hydrogen and oxygen evolutions would be quicker than those in alkaline electrolysis.196 However, there are problems in catalyst stability owing to the acidic environment. Therefore, tremendous efforts have also been devoted toward developing high-activity stable OER catalysts in order to further elevate the overall water electrolysis performance.
Although alkaline water electrolysis and PEM have their own merits, KOH electrolyte is sensitive to CO2 in ambient air (CO2 + 2OH− → CO32− + 2H2O). This process not only reduces the number of OH− and ionic conductivity of the electrolyte but also the formed K2CO3 would block the ion transfer after depositing itself in the pores of the gas diffusion layer produced during water electrolysis. During the past few decades, AEM electrolysis has been developed owing to its low cost and high activity for water splitting.197 The overall reaction consists of HER and OER. Water is circulated through the anode to produce hydrogen and hydroxyl ions via the addition of two electrons. Then, hydroxyl ions diffuse through the AEM to the anode side and form oxygen by losing electrons. The overall reaction needs theoretical thermodynamic cell voltage of 1.23 V to split water at 25 °C. Owing to the sluggish kinetics of water splitting and ohmic resistance of the electrolyzer, additional voltage is needed to complete the reaction.
5. Conclusion and perspectives
One of the ways of building a better future is the pursuit of clean and renewable energy as an alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Electrochemical water splitting—which has accounted for 4% of the world's hydrogen generation—is playing an important role in hydrogen production in the pursuit of zero carbon emissions and a sustainable society. Alkaline water splitting broadens the range of electrocatalysts from noble metal and metal oxides to earth-abundant materials, making large-scale applications impossible. However, owing to the sluggish alkaline HER kinetics and complex 4-electron process of OER, it is still a challenge to design effective electrocatalysts. It is important to comprehend the reaction mechanism of HER and OER, as well as the fundamental structure–activity relationship, and subsequently, design an efficient structure of the electrocatalyst. In this article, we summarized the recent mechanism concepts of HER and OER and discussed the current understanding of the energy barrier, surface bonding, and adsorption and desorption energies. Moreover, the development of electrocatalysts of alkaline HER, OER, and overall water splitting was further reviewed.
In alkaline media, HER kinetics are more sluggish than those in acidic media. Four factors should be considered to improve the alkaline HER performance, namely, water adsorption on active sites, water dissociation ability, metal–hydrogen binding energy, and aqueous OH− on the active sites. In particular, the additional water dissociation deteriorates the activity of Pt metal in alkaline media. The poor water dissociation ability becomes the main obstacle for alkaline hydrogen evolution. To resolve the problem of slow kinetics under alkaline media, a dual-active site was proposed to combine the water dissociation sites and adsorption of H intermediates and recombination sites, which could be applied to more materials. The decoration of Pt group metals (Pt/Ir/Ru) on Ni(OH)2 surface, designing Pt-decorated Ni3/N nanosheets, and construction of NiOx/Pt3Ni interfaces are a part of the bifunctional approach. Then, hybrid structures such as Ru@C2N, Co-decorated Ru nanosheets, and Pd–CNx composites were further developed to improve water dissociation/OH− desorption abilities. Such a bifunctional approach was mainly combined with a noble metal and a nonprecious metal. To effectively reduce the cost of electrocatalysts and enhance hydrogen production, dual-active sites with nonprecious compounds would be worthwhile. With regard to hydrogen evolution, considerably higher attention is still required to be paid toward earth-abundant materials. This could not only accelerate hydrogen production but also increase current densities for practical applications in alkaline media. In addition, there is still a large gap between the theoretical and real HER catalysts, although extensive efforts have been devoted to this effect. Several electrocatalysts have even undergone structural transformation during the reaction. In this regard, in situ characterization and tests need to be further conducted to better understand the real active sites and then provide guidance for the design of highly efficient alkaline HER electrocatalysts.
With regard to alkaline OER, the main challenge involves the mechanism details, and considerable efforts have been devoted toward determining the reaction mechanism, exploring active sites, understanding structure transfer, and designing active and stable electrocatalysts. Theoretical analysis has facilitated the understanding of the condition of intermediates, energy barrier of each step, and therefore, guiding catalyst synthesis. However, owing to the dynamic change in OER catalysts, deficiency of the detailed OER process, and complexity of OER catalyst categories, it is difficult to give a specific conclusion for the OER mechanism. Commonly, binding energy (M–O, M–OH, and M–OOH) is mainly the basic benchmark for OER performance. Tremendous efforts have been devoted toward tuning the binding energy of OER intermediates via electronic and geometric structural engineering. With regard to perovskite oxides, electronic structures (eg electron, d-band center, and O p-band center) are the main optimization method for catalyst design. In addition, lattice oxygen activity and surface reconstruction also provide new insights into oxygen evolution under real conditions. Direct O–O binding was also observed in several transition metal oxides. With regard to oxygen evolution, in view of the dynamic transfer of active structure, catalysts or precatalysts should be further investigated in future research. In situ and operando characterizations should be conducted to determine the unknown information about the catalysts. For instance, in situ XAS can be used to explore changes in the redox state, binding length, and local environment of the active oxides. Moreover, in situ and operando Mössbauer spectroscopies, XPS/AP-XPS, and EC-AFM have also been gradually employed to better understand geometric and electronic structural changes. Although several groups have initiated such studies, there is a long way to popularize in situ/operando equipment to better explore catalyst compositions, morphologies, oxidation states, and intermediates.
Overall, several research efforts have been devoted toward investigating alkaline water splitting as well as designing bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts. In view of the industrial application of electrochemical water splitting, high current density and long-term stability are imperative. Therefore, both number and high activity of active sites need to be improved via catalyst design (such as single-atom design). In addition, owing to the complex nature of water splitting systems, bubble behavior and electrolyte effects should also be considered during catalyst design. It is noteworthy that the common comprehension of reaction processes and active sites is becoming more specific. With the development of theoretical calculations, characterization techniques, novel synthesis strategies, and new catalyst materials, we believe that a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and industrial applications of alkaline water splitting will become the norm.

Broader context
Alkaline electrochemical water splitting has gained significant attention to solve the ever-increasing energy demand and environmental contamination. Owing to the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) in alkaline electrolytes, it is important to understand the mechanism of these two half-reactions and design efficient HER/OER electrocatalysts. Alkaline HER processes involve the slow kinetics of water dissociation, which even makes Pt metal suffer from poor activity. For the alkaline OER, four-electron–proton-coupling reactions also result in sluggish kinetics, and details regarding OER intermediates, energy barrier of each step, and active-phase evolution are unclear. This review describes the fundamental comprehension of alkaline HER/OER; bifunctional site construction using noble-metal- and nonnoble-metal-based HER electrocatalysts; and OER electrocatalyst design based on binding energy, electronic structure, lattice oxygen, and surface reconstruction. In addition, recent developments in bifunctional HER/OER electrocatalysts are also presented from the viewpoints of efficient construction of numerous active sites. In the near future, with the development of theoretical calculations, in situ advanced characterization, new synthesis strategies for catalytic materials, complete understanding of mechanisms, and industrial applications of alkaline water splitting will become the norm.
