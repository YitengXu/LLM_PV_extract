    , Accepted 29th July 2020First published on 7th August 2020AbstractThe production of hydrogen using solar energy via a photoelectrochemical system is an effective technique for meeting present clean energy needs. Owing to the small bandgap and highly negative conduction band edge (−0.46 V) of Si, it is considered a promising photocathode material for solar hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, because of sluggish HER kinetics on the Si surface, bare Si electrodes have a high overpotential. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted wide interest as a promising alternative to Pt-based catalysts for producing hydrogen. Nevertheless, it suffers from sluggish kinetics for driving the process of HER because of its inert basal plane. Herein, HER performance was enhanced by doping a metal (cobalt) and a nonmetal (phosphorus) into MoS2. Doping MoS2 (CoPO-MoS2) on Si photocathodes with cobalt and phosphorous provides a current density of about 21.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V (vs. RHE) and a reduced Tafel value of 54.3 mV dec−1. The doped catalyst shows good stability up to 3 h with retention of about 85%. The flat surface of the Si photocathode has been chemically etched into pyramidal structures (SiMP) to reduce the loss due to reflection and enhance the catalytically active surface. Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure reveal that Co and P strongly coordinated with the MoS2 materials. Furthermore, the catalytic performance was enhanced by the defect sites on MoS2, thereby stimulating more S vacancies on the basal planes and S-edge sites. Defect engineering will hopefully provide a new research direction for the innovation and development of more active sites of CoPO–MoS2.
1. Introduction
The energy required to sustain economic development is predominantly produced from fossil fuels. Combustion of fossil fuels produces greenhouse gas emissions, thus causing accelerated or anthropogenic global warming. Hence, clean energy technologies must be developed to satisfy energy demands without harming the environment.1 Current technological developments focus on harnessing solar, wind, biomass, hydroelectric, ocean, and geothermal power to address energy scarcity.2 Solar energy provides clean energy with a marginal environmental effect. The solar power accumulated over the Earth is about 1.2 × 105 TW, of which only a negligible fraction is utilized in photovoltaics. Converting, storing, and distributing solar energy economically are challenging tasks. Semiconducting materials are capable of efficient absorption and conversion of solar illumination for water photoelectrolysis. Photoelectrochemical water splitting has gained intense interest in generating H2 from water as a clean fuel.3,4 However, splitting water into its components, namely, H2via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and O2via the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is thermodynamically difficult. Even after Honda and Fujishima reported TiO2 photoelectrolysis more than four decades ago, the current approaches remain to be focused on solving the water splitting problem by using new materials for both cathodic and anodic processes with a high obtainable voltage.5 The potential difference for electrochemical water electrolysis is about 1.23 V. n-type TiO2, CdS, and ZnO semiconductor catalysts are very efficient for water electrolysis.6 In the past decade, many researchers have made considerable progress in developing visible-light-driven photocatalysts for enhancing HER activity. The main objective is to build an efficient photocatalytic material for the HER in an unbiased configuration.4 The photocatalytic production of H2 involves various steps, such as light absorption by a semiconductor; generation of excited charges; and recombination, separation, migration, trapping, and movement of the excited charges to water to produce hydrogen.7
p-Si is considered a photocathode in terms of several photochemical aspects, such as (i) thermodynamic feasibility in terms of bandgap (1.12 eV), band bending, and light absorption at semiconductor/liquid interfaces; (ii) reaction kinetics, particularly charge transfer at semiconductor/electrolyte boundaries; and (iii) carrier recombination and light reflection at interfaces.8 Si can be fabricated into different geometries, such as nanowires and pyramids. These geometries possess a high surface area, which is advantageous for producing high photochemical activity.9,10 However, Si has sluggish surface kinetics because of the high adsorption free energy for hydrogen on p-Si, a condition that mitigates HER efficiency.11,12 These issues can be addressed by incorporating co-catalyst materials, such as noble metals like Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Os, Ir, Ag, and Au, which can improve HER efficiency.13 Although noble metals have a higher catalytic activity than other metals, they are expensive and rare.12,14
Transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit advantages over other materials as co-catalysts for photoelectrochemical HER because of their low cost and ease of availability.15 In particular, MoS2 has a layered structure in which the metal is sandwiched between two layers of sulfur that are held together by weak van der Waals forces.14,16 The S atoms present at the Mo-edge sites are capable of adsorbing 50% of H, that is, each alternate S atom can bind to one H atom.17 Hence, MoS2 is a promising co-catalyst for the HER.16 However, the catalytic activity of MoS2 is largely controlled through the edge sites because its basal plane is catalytically inactive. The basal plane of MoS2 is inert and has a smaller surface area than the active edges. The positive free energy for H adsorption on the MoS2 edge site as calculated using density functional theory is ΔGH = +0.08 eV, which infers the coverage of only one-quarter of the MoS2 edge by H.18 Moreover, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔGH) for MoS2 is almost close to that of Pt, indicating that MoS2 is a promising photocatalyst for the HER.16,19 Previous studies included cobalt-related materials, such as cobalt phosphate (Co–Pi), Co3O4, and other cobalt complexes, for the HER and OER.20–22
During the HER process, only the metallic edges are responsible for catalytic activity. Thus, most of the area of the basal plane remains unutilized. Therefore, the basal plane must be activated to use it effectively. Basal plane activation can be accomplished via various techniques, such as defect modulation,23–25 strain engineering,23,26 and chemical doping.27,28 Defect engineering strategies, such as heteroatom doping, have been developed and widely used in catalyst research.29 Catalytic defect engineering primarily aims to change the catalyst morphology to achieve a high active site exposure on one side of the catalyst30,31 and adjust its electronic structure to improve intrinsic activity and vice versa.29,32 In the present study, chemical doping was employed for basal plane activation. Chemical modification of MoS2 catalysts via heteroatom doping is a reasonable approach for improving HER activity. In our previous study, we incorporated various ratios of phosphorus into MoS2 to expose more edges and S-vacancies to achieve a high HER activity.33
In the present study, semiconducting 2H-MoS2 with a trigonal prismatic structure is modified by co-doping of heteroatoms cobalt (transition metal) and phosphorus (nonmetal) on Si micropyramids (SiMPs). The modified MoS2 is fabricated as a photocathode via thermal annealing. The effects of heteroatom doping of MoS2 on HER activity are explored. Doping MoS2 with Co activated the basal plane and caused S-vacancies to become closer to the Co-doped metal.34 Doping of MoS2 resulted in highly active edges and basal planes that enhanced HER activity through S-vacancies.33,35 Herein, the effective activation of the basal planes and S-edges has been illustrated using CoPO as the dopant. The optimized CoPO–MoS2 co-catalyst exhibited a current density of 21.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V (vs. RHE) with excellent stability up to 3 h. Furthermore, no phase transformation or catalyst oxidation occurs during the HER cycles. These results demonstrated the synergetic effects of defect engineering and basal plane activation.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1 Fabrication of Si micropyramids
Boron-doped p-type Si wafers (resistivity of 1–25 Ω cm) were used to prepare SiMPs via a general wet chemical etching method. In this process, 10 ml of isopropanol solution (5 vol%) was mixed with KOH (4.02 g) in 190 ml of deionized water (DI) and positioned on a hot plate at 90 °C for 15 min. The p-Si wafers were covered with Teflon tape, leaving about 1 cm2 for catalyst loading. The wafers were immersed in the hot solution mixture for 30 min, washed with DI water, and then dried under a N2 gas flow.
2.2 Fabrication of MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2/SiMPs
(NH4)2MoS4 and cobalt nitrate were used as procured without any further purification. About 0.5 mmol of each precursor was added into 10 ml of methanol and 20 μL of hexamethyldisilazane. The solution was ultrasonicated for 15 min. The SiMPs were immersed in 5 wt% HF to remove the native oxide layer. About 24 μL of the precursor solution was dropped on the SiMPs. The SiMPs were dried at room temperature and then annealed at 400 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C per minute for 2 h under a flow of 100 sccm 20% H2/N2 mixture. The CoMoS/Si catalyst was placed in an Al crucible, and a mixture of 0.25 g of S and 0.75 g of red P was placed in other crucibles. The powder was kept in a downstream position, and the reaction was conducted at 500 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere of 200 sccm. Jang et al. synthesized P:MoS2via the thin-film transfer method at a controlled S:P ratio. They found that P-rich MoS2 (S/P = 0.33) has enhanced HER performance.36 In the present study, the S:P ratio was fixed to about 0.33 for the synthesis of the different loading amounts of CoMoS2 decorated on the SiMPs via the thermal annealing method. About 1 mmol of (NH4)2MoS4 was used to fabricate MoS2/SiMPs. About 1 g of S was used to fabricate the MoS2 catalysts (Scheme 1).

2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
For electrochemical analysis without illumination, the electrodes were prepared using Ti foil, and the catalyst materials were deposited via the drop-casting method. High activity was obtained for 190 μL of the precursor solution. The electrochemical measurements were performed using a three-electrode cell in which the MoS2/Si, CoPO–MoS2/Si, MoS2/Ti, and CoPO–MoS2/Ti electrodes were used as the working electrodes. Ag/AgCl and graphite rods were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All photoelectrochemical experiments were conducted in 0.5 M aqueous H2SO4 solution (pH = 0.3), and electrochemical responses were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (760D, CH Instruments). The photochemical responses of MoS2/Si and CoPO–MoS2/SiMPs were measured using a 500 W Xe lamp (Gloria-X500A, Zolix) with an AM 1.5 filter as a solar simulator. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements of the photocathodes were performed at a voltage ranging from +0.35 to −0.35 V (vs. RHE) with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. LSV measurements of the MoS2/Ti and CoPO–MoS2/Ti electrodes were recorded from 0 V to −0.50 V (vs. RHE). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to determine the geometric double-layer capacitance (Cdl) for the HER at a non-faradaic potential ranging from +0.1 V to +0.2 V (vs. RHE) at various scan rates of 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV s−1.
2.4 Materials characterization
X-ray powder diffraction analysis was performed to examine the crystallinity of the materials by using a D2 Phaser diffractometer (Bruker) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54178 Å) radiation. Raman measurements were performed using a Thermo DXR microscope (532 nm laser light). Reflectance was observed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Evolution 220, Thermo). The morphologies of the materials were examined via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JSM-6700F-JEOL). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping was also conducted via FESEM (JSM-6700F-JEOL). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were carried out at the 24A1 and 44A beamlines of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Centre (NSRRC), Hsinchu City, Taiwan.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD and PEC analysis
In this study, SiMP photocathodes are fabricated via the wet chemical etching method and used as a photo absorber. CoP–MoS2 is decorated on the SiMPs via the thermal annealing method. The sharp peaks at 2θ values of about 33.5, 34.2, and 62 degrees in the XRD patterns in Fig. 1 are attributed to Si from the SiMPs. The diffraction peak at 2θ of about 14.4 degrees corresponded to the Miller index of (002) in the hexagonal MoS2/Si photocathodes. Based on the XRD patterns of the P-doped and undoped MoS2−xPx co-catalysts, the deposited layer is amorphous. The XRD patterns of the doped MoS2 co-catalyst at different loading amounts were recorded to further confirm the amorphous nature of the coated layer (Fig. S1†). Even after increasing the loading amount from 12 μL to 48 μL on the SiMPs, the signature peaks for MoS2 remained absent, thus indicating its amorphous nature. Such amorphous nature of the co-catalyst layer of the P-doped MoS2−xPx co-catalyst has been reported in our previous study.33 Further, amorphous MoS2 show higher catalytic activity without compromising the Mo-bonding.37

(c) Photocurrent density and onset potential at 0 V for the CoPO–MoS2 co-catalyst coated on the photocathode materials. 

Fig. 1b shows the illumination-driven HER performance of the doped and undoped MoS2 co-catalysts on the SiMP photocathodes. A three-electrode system was used to perform LSV in 0.5 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. Bare SiMPs showed no photoresponse at 0 V because of sluggish HER kinetics, whereas MoS2/SiMPs exhibited a positive onset potential of +0.097 V, and the current attained was −2.32 mA cm−2 at 0 V (vs. RHE). The current density and onset potential obtained for the optimized CoPO–MoS2/SiMP co-catalyst are −21.6 mA cm−2 and 0.234 V, respectively (Fig. 1c), which are superior to those of the undoped MoS2/SiMP photoelectrode. Such enhancement in the photocurrent of the doped co-catalyst may be attributed to the Co and P co-doping which increases the S vacancies and activated basal plane sites, thereby increasing the HER activity of the MoS2 photocatalysts.19,38,39
In order to examine the Co and P content and their role in the PEC HER process, the co-catalyst was modified by changing the Co ratio on the MoS2 catalyst while keeping the P content constant. As reported by Jang et al. the optimized S/P ratio in the P-rich co-catalyst shows higher catalytic performance towards the HER.36 Doping Co improves charge transfer and enhances the intrinsic activity of individual sites.40 Replacing S atoms by P creates unsaturated metal-based active sites and improves electron conductivity, hence boosting the activity of the catalyst.41 As reported by Duan et al. a variation in the cation and anion composition lead to lowering the overpotential with increase HER activity.42 Herein, we have followed a similar protocol and as a result of which, Co0.5P–MoS2 shows higher catalytic performance and excellent stability (Fig. S2†). Hence, the simultaneous doping of Co and P improves the HER performance due to facile charge transfer and exposing more active sites. The co-catalyst optimization has been further investigated by increasing the loading on the SiMPs. Upon increasing the catalyst loading amount from 12 μL to 48 μL on the SiMPs, the onset potential shifted to a more positive voltage, and a higher current density was observed (Fig. S3†). However, a further increase in the loading amount decreased the catalytic performance because of the blockage of light by the catalysts.43 Among all loading CoPO–MoS2 amounts, 24 μL was found to be the optimum amount.
3.2 Morphology and surface analysis

Fig. 2a and b, and S4† display the FESEM images of the co-catalysts coated on SiMPs after thermal treatment. The MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2 catalysts appeared homogeneously distributed on the surface of the SiMPs. FESEM images illustrate the pinhole-free coating on the SiMP surface. EDX analysis revealed the homogeneous distribution of Mo and S in undoped MoS2 and Mo, S, and P in the doped MoS2 co-catalysts (Fig. S5†). Fig. 2c depicts the reflectance spectra of bare SiMPs, and MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2 coated on the SiMPs. The profile of the reflectance spectra of both MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2 followed the same trend as that of bare SiMPs. However, the SiMPs coated with CoPO–MoS2 showed the lowest reflection, indicating that these SiMPs had the most photogenerated carriers. The reflectance characteristics of the CoPO–MoS2 co-catalyst further revealed the improved photoelectrochemical performance depicted in Fig. 1. However, the trend between MoS2 and bare SiMPs was different. The reflectance measurements could not provide sufficient knowledge of the photoelectrochemical performance of this co-catalyst. Hence, the spectra of the MoS2/Si and CoPO–MoS2/Si photocathodes were recorded to understand the vibrational characteristics of the materials. The Raman peaks at 382.7 and 408.1 cm−1 characterized by MoS2/SiMPs corresponded to the in-plane E12g and the out-of-plane A1g vibrational modes of the hexagonal MoS2 (2H-MoS2) phase, respectively. Subsequently, the addition of Co and P resulted in a slightly lower Raman shift of the in-plane and out-of-plane phonon modes, respectively. The interlayer in-plane vibration (E2g) in the basal plane of MoS2 is associated with the movement of Mo and S atoms wherein the two S atoms move in the same direction. In the case of the out-of-plane A1g mode, the two S atoms coordinated to Mo move in the opposite direction along the c-axis. Moreover, the Raman peaks shifted to the left suggesting the atomic sites in the MoS2 basal plane are modified by the addition of Co and P.44–48

3.3 Electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2 on Ti foil
The electrochemical properties of the catalyst materials were characterized using a three-electrode electrochemical cell. In this study, Ti foil was used as a substrate for the electrocatalytic measurements. Bare Ti foil showed no HER performance at 0 V to −0.5 V (vs. RHE).22,49–51 For this analysis, the loading amount used was 10 times higher than that for photochemical analysis. The optimized loading amount of CoPO–MoS2/Ti was about 190 μL. Fig. 3a presents the LSV curves for the electrode materials with iR compensation and background correction. The onset potential of MoS2/Ti was −0.33 V, whereas a positive shift to −0.217 V was observed for CoPO–MoS2/Ti, and its current density reached about 10 mA cm−2. This result was obtained likely due to heteroatom doping as more sulfur-terminated active sites were generated, a condition that lowered the activation energy of the reaction. These results confirmed the synergetic effects of defect engineering and structural modification in the presence of Co–PO on MoS2 catalysts to enhance HER performance. The two-electron process in the HER mechanism can be explained in two steps: the first is the Volmer step (H3O+ + e− + * → H* + H2O), followed by the Heyrovsky reaction (H* + H3O+ + e− → H2 + H2O) or the recombination step of the Tafel reaction (H* + H* → H2) (here * is the catalyst on the surface, and H* is the hydrogen intermediate). In the second step, the recombination of adsorbed hydrogen atoms yields hydrogen evolution. The Tafel slope values are shown in Fig. 3b. For MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2, the Tafel slope is about 72.8 and 54.29 mV dec−1, respectively. From the low Tafel slope values of the Co- and P-doped MoS2 catalysts, it can be inferred that the HER proceeds via the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism.

Double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is a measure of the effective electrochemically active surface area available between the solid–liquid interface of catalyst materials for driving the HER. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded within the potential range of +0.1 V to +0.2 V to evaluate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts (Fig. S6†). The voltammograms followed a rectangular shape without any prominent peaks, indicating the non-faradaic nature of the voltammograms. ECSA is directly proportional to Cdl of the electrode materials. The Cdl value for MoS2 was 0.325 mF cm−2, whereas that for CoPO–MoS2 improved to 3.41 mF cm−2 (Fig. 3c and d). Co and P doping enhanced the sulfur vacancies in the edges and basal planes and thus yielded active sites for the HER. CoPO–MoS2 probably provided more active sites for achieving optimal catalytic performance.
Catalytic stability is another criterion to evaluate HER performance. Polarization measurements were continuously recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4 for 3 h. Fig. S7a† illustrates the LSV of the CoPO–MoS2 co-catalyst. The co-doped MoS2 catalyst maintained a stable curve up to 85% in an acidic environment. The larger semicircle of MoS2/SiMPs in the Nyquist plot (Fig. S7b†) indicates the higher resistance of the electrode. The co-doped sample shows a negligible change in resistance before and after the LSV measurements indicating the higher stability of the co-catalyst. The ex situ Raman analysis of the photoelectrode before and after 3 h of cycles is shown in Fig. S8.† There are no signature peaks for the 1T-MoS2 phase of the CoPO–MoS2 electrode, ruling out any possibility of phase transformation during the HER cycle.
3.4 Core-level XPS analysis of MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2
XPS was performed to analyze the elemental composition and binding energy of the elements. Table 1 lists the binding energies of the Mo, Co, and P elements. The deconvoluted spectra of Mo 3d, Co 2p, and P 2p for MoS2 and Co- and P-doped MoS2 are depicted in Fig. 4a. The peaks at 228.8 and 232 eV corresponded to the Mo4+ for hexagonal (2H) Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, whereas that at 226.5 eV was attributed to 2S.52,53 The peaks at 230.7 and 233.9 eV were assigned to Mo5+, Mo 3d5/2, and Mo 3d3/2.54 Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 for Mo6+ were centered at 232.7 and 235.9 eV, respectively.55 The Mo6+ peak could be attributed to surface oxidation. Upon the introduction of Co and P to MoS2, the binding energy of Mo4+ shifted to a lower value as in the case of CoPO–MoS2/Si. The deconvoluted 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peaks of Mo4+ shifted to 228.5 and 231.6 eV, respectively. By comparison, 2S remained at 226.5 eV in CoPO–MoS2. Such a shift to lower binding energies after Co and P introduction indicated successful doping in Mo sites with a sulfur vacancy in the basal plane.33,56 This negative shift confirmed the strong interaction in the co-doped catalyst.31 As reported by Jun et al., the surface oxidation of Mo can be suppressed by heteroatom doping (phosphorus).41 In the present report, a similar observation has been made wherein there is no surface oxidation of Mo due to simultaneous doping of Co and P being observed. In XPS, the peaks at 229.8 and 233.1 eV were assigned to the defect center. In photocatalysis, these defect sites could be reduced to generate unsaturated catalytically ready Mo4+ centers for the HER.44,57 The HER activity improves because of basal and edge plane activation owing to the synergetic effects of defect engineering.44 Finally, the peak in the XPS pattern of Mo6+ in MoS2 modified with Co and P was absent. Hence, chemical modification suppressed the surface oxidation of MoS2. The peak at 134.8 eV corresponded to the characteristic 2p peak of PO43− (Fig. 4b).58 The good activity was due to the lone-pair electrons in the 3p orbital of phosphorous and the unoccupied 3d orbital, which can increase the local electron density. The S-vacancies in the MoS2 basal plane acts as electron deficient centers leading Mo sites as electron rich to attract proton for adsorption.47,59,60 The deconvoluted Co 2p spectrum shown in Fig. 4c illustrates the characteristic peaks of Co2+ and Co3+ centered at 781.08 and 797.28 eV, respectively.59

3.5 XAS local structure analysis of MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2
XAS was performed to examine the local structure, for example, the electronic and atomic structure, of MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2. The chemical states of the co-catalyst materials were illustrated via X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). For XAS measurements, the co-catalysts were coated on carbon cloth to avoid strong signals from Si.9 The XANES data were recorded in fluorescence mode (Fig. 5a). The Mo K-edge XANES showed no significant variations between the doped and undoped MoS2, indicating that both had a similar absorption edge.9,33 The EXAFS of Mo and Co K-edge was extracted from XANES to evaluate the chemical states of Co- and P-doped MoS2 (Fig. 5b). The absorbing atoms with higher valence states in the analyzed sample resulted in a chemical shift from X-ray absorption to that of stronger energy. These results illustrated that the absorption data for the Co K-edge in CoPO–MoS2 were from a different chemical environment from those for the Mo K-edge, indicating that a composite material was formed.

EXAFS patterns were recorded to investigate the basal and edge structures of the MoS2 and CoPO–MoS2 photocatalysts. The coordination number (N) of the basal plane corresponded to six metals and six sulfur atoms within the first and second shells. By contrast, the coordination number of Mo and S edges was about 6 or 4, respectively. Moreover, the exposed edge sites increased with the decrease in coordination number of the Mo cations, and the coordination number of the second shell decreased because of the S-vacancies. The HRTEM image of CoPO–MoS2 shows the defect formation along with the MoS2 fringes (dotted white circle) with a d spacing of 0.61 nm and 0.277 nm (Fig. S9†).
The detailed fitting results are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 5c demonstrates that the two peaks at 2.4 and 3.1 belonged to the Mo–S (first shell) and Mo–Mo (second shell) coordination shells. The peak intensity of EXAFS was proportional to the coordination number from the surroundings of the X-ray absorbing atoms. The coordination number of the first shell was different from that of the second shell, thus confirming that Co and P coordinated on the Mo-ions. Doping Co and P into MoS2 increased the coordination number of the second shell. These results suggested that Co and P activate both the basal plane and the S edge site. In turn, the activation creates more sulfur vacancies through defect engineering (Fig. 5d).35,38,61 Therefore, doping Co and P into 2H-MoS2 plays a vital role in boosting HER catalytic activity.

4. Conclusions
The highly catalytic basal CoPO–MoS2 was decorated on SiMPs via a simple thermal annealing method. The photocatalytic activity of the MoS2 basal plane for the HER was successfully activated by doping with Co and P. The activation can achieve more S-vacancies through atomic defect engineering. The defect structure of the modified Si photocathodes enhanced HER performance. The current density and onset potential of MoS2 was about −2.32 mA cm−2 and +0.097 V. The MoS2 catalysts displayed a higher current density of −21.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V (vs. RHE) after doping with Co and P. Co and P were successfully incorporated into the MoS2 materials as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and XAS. These defects created more S vacancies and thus activated the basal plane. The present study demonstrated how heteroatom doping can be used to improve HER performance and provides a better understanding of the internal functioning of heteroatoms.
