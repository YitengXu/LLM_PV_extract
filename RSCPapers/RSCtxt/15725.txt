    , Accepted 21st March 2016First published on 21st March 2016AbstractAs an important portion in perovskite solar cells, an electron transport layer (ETL) is essential for high efficiency perovskite devices. In this work, a flower-like TiO2 array layer grown on an FTO substrate was prepared by a low-temperature (80 °C) chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The flower-like TiO2 layer, which is composed of anatase TiO2 nanorods, was then utilized as an ETL for perovskite solar cells. As a result, excellent light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) and low recombination of electrons and holes lead to an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE, 15.71%) than that of traditional mesoporous TiO2 layer based perovskite devices (13.25%) with less hysteresis. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest PCE for all low-temperature processed three-dimensional (3D) TiO2 ETL based perovskite devices. Moreover, it is proved that our perovskite devices are highly reproducible. This work offers a novel method to achieve all low-temperature processed, reproducible and high-performance perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
As one of the third-generation photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been considered a promising alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices. Even though the PCE of DSCs has been improved to 13% by Mathew et al., large-scale commercialization of DSCs has been inhibited by serious leakage problems because of the use of liquid electrolyte solutions.1 By replacing the dye and liquid electrolyte solutions in DSCs with a perovskite active layer and solid-state hole transport materials, the solar cells based on perovskite materials have recently attracted considerable attention due to their high photovoltaic efficiency, low-cost and low-temperature processability.2–4 During the past five years, the PCEs of perovskite solar cells have been boosted from 3.81% to an impressive value of 22.1% confirmed by the national renewable energy laboratory, surpassing almost all solution-processed solar cells.5
In a typical perovskite solar cell, a perovskite active layer is sandwiched between an ETL and a hole transport layer (HTL). As a common n-type semiconductor, TiO2 has been widely utilized as an ETL and a scaffold layer in perovskite solar cells. However, the pore filling of the perovskite materials is a universal problem for this traditional mesoporous TiO2 ETL.6 Due to the full pore filling of the perovskite layer and excellent photo-generated electron transport properties, multidimensional TiO2 nanostructures prepared by a hydrothermal method have been widely employed as ETLs in perovskite solar cells.7–10 However, the PCEs (4.87–11.9%) are still low in these studies. Moreover, high reaction temperature (170–200 °C) and annealing temperature (450–500 °C) of these multidimensional TiO2 nanostructures lead to high-cost and are time-consuming, which restricts their further commercial applications. Aswani and co-workers have demonstrated a low-temperature (70 °C) processing of a dense nanocrystalline TiO2 layer as an ETL for perovskite solar cells, resulting a PCE of 13.7%.11 Dong and co-workers prepared a dense TiO2 layer using magnetron sputtering at room temperature, achieving 15.07% efficiency for flexible perovskite solar cells.12 However, all low-temperature processed 3D TiO2 ETL based perovskite devices with excellent PCE have not been reported so far.
Hence, we prepared a 3D flower-like TiO2 array, which is composed of one-dimensional (1D) anatase TiO2 nanorods, as an ETL for perovskite solar cells by a simply low-temperature (80 °C) CBD method. After adjusting the reaction time, the resulting flower-like anatase TiO2 array is well compatible with the deposition of a perovskite layer with full coverage by a sequential deposition method. High LHE and low recombination of electrons and holes are obtained under this condition. As a result, the perovskite solar cell based on the flower-like anatase TiO2 ETL demonstrates a high PCE of 15.71%, which is the best PCE for low-temperature processed 3D TiO2 ETL based perovskite devices and higher than that of traditional mesoporous TiO2 ETL based devices with less hysteresis. More importantly, such synthetic strategy paves the way for the development of all low-temperature processed flexible photovoltaic devices.
Experimental
Synthesis of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I)
The CH3NH3I was prepared according to a reported method.13 The hydroiodic acid (30 ml, 57 wt% in water, J&K) and methylamine (27.86 ml, 40% in methanol, Sinopharm) were mixed in a round bottomed flask under vigorous stirring. After reaction at 0 °C for 2 h, crystallization of CH3NH3I was achieved by evaporating the solvent at 60 °C for 1 h. The product was washed with diethyl ether three times and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The white coloured powder was collected and stored under an argon atmosphere before use.
Preparation of the flower-like anatase TiO2 electron transport layer and traditional mesoporous TiO2 layer on FTO substrates
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrate (NSG, 8 Ω per square) was patterned by etching with Zn powder and 2 M HCl diluted in DI water. The etched FTO substrate was then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath containing acetone for 20 min and ethanol for 20 min, rinsed with DI water and dried with clean dry air. The flower-like anatase TiO2 ETL was prepared by a modified low-temperature CBD method.14 In the CBD procedure, the reaction solution containing 50 ml of deionized water, 1 ml of HCl (Sinopharm, AR) and 3.35 ml of TiCl3 solution (15% in hydrochloric acid solution, Sinopharm) was magnetically stirred for 5 min and transferred into a beaker. The cleaned FTO glass was immersed in the solution, where the conductive side of FTO glass was placed upward, and the beaker was sealed and kept at 80 °C for 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours in a box furnace. After the reaction completed, the electrodes were washed with deionized water and ethanol and dried at 100 °C for two hours.
For the preparation of the traditional mesoporous TiO2 ETL, a compact TiO2 blocking layer was first made by spin-coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Aldrich) in 1-butanol (99.8%, Aldrich) solution on the FTO substrate at 2000 rpm for 20 s, followed by heating at 125 °C for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, the diluted P25 paste was spin-coated on the compact TiO2 blocking layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s, where the pristine P25 paste was prepared according to a previous report and diluted in ethanol (0.13 g ml−1).15 After annealed at 500 °C for 30 min, the mesoporous TiO2 film was immersed in 0.02 M aqueous TiCl4 (Sinopharm, AR) solution at 70 °C for 40 min. After rinsing with DI water and drying, the film was heated at 500 °C for 30 min.
Fabrication of hybrid perovskite solar cells
The CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer was deposited on the TiO2 ETL by a two-step deposition method.16 The 1 M PbI2 solution was prepared by dissolving 462 mg PbI2 (99.9985%, Alfa Aesar) in 1 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%, Alfa Aesar), stirring at 60 °C for 12 h. Then, the filtrated PbI2 solution was spin-coated onto the TiO2 ETL at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The PbI2 layer coated TiO2 ETL was dried at room-temperature for 10 min and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min to remove the DMF solvent. After cooling to room temperature, the PbI2 layer coated TiO2 ETL was immersed into 10 mg ml−1 CH3NH3I solution (70 °C) with 2-propanol (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) as the solvent for 2 min. The obtained CH3NH3PbI3 film was washed with 2-propanol twice and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The HTM was then deposited by spin coating 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s. A spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD in 1 ml of chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μl of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 ml acetonitrile, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) were added. Finally, 110 nm Ag was thermally evaporated on the spiro-MeOTAD-coated film to form the back contact. The obtained solar cells were left in a desiccator for 12 h before tested. All the device fabrication processes were carried out under controlled atmospheric conditions and a humidity of <1%.
Characterization
The morphology and structure of the flower-like TiO2 films were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S4800) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010F, F20, 200 kV). The XRD spectra of the prepared flower-like TiO2 films were measured using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Bruker D8 Advanced Diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV). The absorption spectra of the perovskite coated flower-like TiO2 films were measured by using a Cary 500 UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence measurements were acquired at room temperature with a UV-Vis-NIR fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluorolog-3-P) with an excitation wavelength of 600 nm. The solar cells were illuminated using a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91160, AM 1.5 globe) and the power of the simulated light was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). The J–V curves of solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The devices were masked with a metal aperture to define the active area of 0.0625 cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Newport-74125 system (Newport Instruments).
Results and discussion
The SEM images of low-temperature CBD processed flower-like anatase TiO2 layers on FTO substrates under different reaction times, without and with the perovskite layer coating, are shown in Fig. 1. After keeping the reaction vessel at 80 °C for 4 h, a layer composed of TiO2 nucleus was closely packed on the FTO substrate. Two hours later, the layer became more compact and thicker. As the reaction was further increased to 8 h, the flower-like structure was clearly observed and the thickness of the TiO2 layer increased apparently to around 300 nm (Fig. S1A†). This process was confirmed by the corresponding elemental mapping in Fig. S2,† where some regions with enrichment of Ti elements were found for 4 h and 6 h and the density of Ti elements increased obviously at 8 h after the flower-like structure appeared. When the reaction was extended to 10 h, more plump flower-like structure appeared. From the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. S1B,† some plump flower-like structures grew obviously in the vertical direction and the TiO2 layer was no longer planar. To reveal the crystal structure of the as-made TiO2 layer, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was measured. As shown in Fig. 2A, the main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.28°, 37.80°, 48.05° and 55.06° are assigned to the (101), (004), (200) and (211) planes, respectively, agreeing well with the anatase phase (JCPDS 21-1272). The impurity phase with a diffraction peak at 2θ = 30.56° could be attributed to TiCl3 traces. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2B) shows that the flower-like anatase TiO2 nanostructure is composed of ultrathin, single crystalline nanorods. Lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing d = 0.344 nm is consistent with the (101) crystal plane (inset in Fig. 2B).

After the two-step deposition method, the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer coated TiO2 ETL is obtained and the related SEM images are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1E, the typical morphology of the two-step deposition perovskite layer can be observed.17 However, there are some pores in the perovskite layer, which suggests that the thin TiO2 ETL could not support the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer perfectly to attain maximum coverage. With the forming of the flower-like TiO2 ETL, a full coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer is obtained (Fig. 1F and G). It indicates that the flower-like TiO2 ETL plays the same role as the traditional mesoporous TiO2 ETL to support the perovskite layer. With the reaction time of the flower-like TiO2 ETL extended to 10 h, the flower-like TiO2 ETL is no longer planar and 100% coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer is not attainable. As shown in Fig. 1E and H, the uncovering regions will lead to the direct contact between the ETL and hole transport layer (HTL), where the electrons and holes can recombine easily.18
To further investigate the LHE and recombination behavior of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer coated TiO2 ETL, we measured the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectrum and room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. As shown in Fig. S3,† the typical UV-Vis absorption spectrum with the absorbance decreasing gradually from 500 nm to 800 nm is presented, which is consistent with the results of a previous report.19 The light-harvesting efficiency of the perovskite-coated TiO2 ETL on the FTO glass is shown in Fig. 3A and the value of LHE is calculated by LHE = (1 − R)(1 − 10−A), where R and A represent reflectance and absorbance, respectively.20 As a result, the LHE of the perovskite-coated TiO2 ETL increases obviously with the increasing reaction time of the flower-like TiO2 ETL, especially for 8 h and 10 h. We could deduce that the flower-like TiO2 supported perovskite layer can absorb more photons, which might further influence the photocurrent.21
The PL spectrum was measured with excitation at 600 nm to investigate the charge transport and recombination behavior in the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer coated TiO2 ETL. As shown in Fig. 3B, the photoluminescence phenomenon is obvious for 4 h and 10 h TiO2 ETLs, which indicates that the electron–hole pair recombination is violent. Reduced coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer leading to the direct contact between the ETL and HTL (shown in Fig. 1E and H) is responsible for this phenomenon. Compared with the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer coated 6 h TiO2 ETL, the photoluminescence phenomenon of the perovskite layer coated 8 h TiO2 ETL is lowest. It might be because of the fact that the flower-like structure TiO2 ETL is formed after 8 h reaction, which provides a more effective interface contact than that of the 6 h TiO2 ETL. Therefore, the charge carriers generated in CH3NH3PbI3 can be effectively transported into a TiO2 electron conductor to avoid charge recombination behavior.22

The typical perovskite device architecture and possible schematic illustration of the extracting and transporting of electrons are shown in Fig. 4A and B. TiO2 ETLs synthesized under different reaction times were applied in the perovskite solar cells, the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of the perovskite solar cells were measured with a reverse scan rate of 0.15 V s−1 under a simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation (shown in Fig. 4C). Values of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit potential (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) of these perovskite solar cells are summarized in Table S1.† The Jsc, Voc and FF of perovskite solar cell based on the 4 h TiO2 ETL are 9.52 mA cm−2, 907.13 mV and 0.51 respectively, yielding a PCE of 4.42%. Less than 100% coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer, leading to obvious recombination between electrons and holes, is responsible for low Jsc, Voc and FF. After increasing the reaction to 6 h and 8 h, 100% coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer is obtained (shown in Fig. 1F and G) and PCEs increase to 11.69% and 14.19%, respectively, which is consistent with the result of the PL spectrum. Moreover, the Jsc increases from 19.58 mA cm−2 for the 6 h TiO2 ETL based device to 21.18 mA cm−2 for the 8 h flower-like TiO2 ETL based device. As shown in Fig. 3A, the flower-like TiO2 nanostructures in the 8 h flower-like TiO2 ETL are beneficial for the improvement of LHE, which further increases the Jsc. Compared to the 6 h TiO2 ETL based device, improved FF (from 0.62 to 0.69) of the 8 h flower-like TiO2 ETL based device demonstrates that the flower-like TiO2 nanostructure could offer a more effective interface for the transport of charge carriers to TiO2, which restricts the recombination behavior and improves the FF of solar cells. After the reaction time was prolonged to 10 h, the overgrowth of the flower-like nanostructure destroyed the formation of a perfect perovskite layer (shown in Fig. 1H). Uncovering regions provide the possibility of direct contact between the ETL and HTL. As a result, the recombination behavior occurs easily, which decreases the FF and PCE of the 10 h flower-like TiO2 ETL based device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured (shown in Fig. S4†) and the integrated current densities for 4 h, 6 h, 8 h and 10 h flower-like TiO2 ETL based devices were 8.86, 18.48, 20.44 and 20.52 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the measured Jsc. Fig. 4D shows the box charts of PCEs of perovskite solar cells based on different reaction time TiO2 ETLs. It can be concluded that the flower-like TiO2 nanostructures prepared under 8 h low-temperature CBD is the best performance ETL in this series of experiments.

Fig. 5A gives the J–V curve of the best performance solar cell, prepared by further controlling the experimental parameters. It demonstrates a PCE value of 15.71% with 22 mA cm−2, 985 mV and 0.72 for Jsc, Voc and FF, respectively. The EQE of the best performing flower-like TiO2 ETL based perovskite solar cell exceeds 80% across the whole visible region, shown in Fig. S5.† The integrated Jsc calculated from the EQE data is 20.98 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the measured Jsc. For comparison, a traditional mesoporous TiO2 ETL (300 nm in thickness) was also prepared and utilized in the perovskite solar cell. As shown in Fig. S6,† a PCE of 13.25% was obtained. It is speculated that our flower-like TiO2 structure can efficiently extract the photoelectrons from perovskite and transport electrons to the FTO substrate, which leads to the better performance.23–25 Moreover, comparable efficiency demonstrates that the low-temperature processed flower-like TiO2 nanostructure is a promising ETL to replace the traditional mesoporous TiO2 ETL. To investigate the reproducible properties of the flower-like TiO2 ETL based perovskite solar cell, the PCE of 30 individual cells based on the 8 h flower-like TiO2 ETL was statistically measured. As shown in Fig. 5B, devices based on the 8 h flower-like TiO2 ETL are highly reproducible.

(D) Photocurrent density as a function of time for a device held at a forward bias of maximum output power point. 
To reveal how the hysteresis affects the maximum power output of our devices and traditional mesoporous TiO2 ETL based devices, we measured the J–V curves using the scan direction from forward bias (FB) to short circuit (SC) with different scan rates (0.015 V s−1, 0.15 V s−1 and 1.5 V s−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5C and S7†). As a result, it displays an obvious hysteresis at higher scan rates, which is reduced at lower scan rates for both devices. This phenomenon is common for perovskite solar cells, which should be related to the morphology of the perovskite film and the selection of hole transport materials.26 Due to the prominent feature in the J–V hysteresis that appears near the open-circuit condition, we further calculated a modified J–V hysteresis index by eqn (1): (1)where JFB–SC(0.8Voc) and JSC–FB(0.8Voc) represent the photocurrent density at 80% of Voc.27 The calculated hysteresis index and other photovoltaic parameters are listed in Tables S2 and S3.† Under the same scan rate, the hysteresis index of the flower-like TiO2 ETL based device is lower than that of the traditional mesoporous TiO2 ETL based device, which indicates less J–V hysteresis in our devices. We then measured the photocurrent density as a function of time for a device held at maximum output power point (757 mV) under a simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation. The photocurrent stabilized at approximately 17.83 mA cm−2, yielding a stable PCE of 13.5% after 600 s, despite the obvious J–V hysteresis.28
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a low-temperature processed flower-like TiO2 ETL for efficient hybrid perovskite solar cells to replace the traditional mesoporous TiO2 layer. By controlling the reaction time, a uniform flower-like TiO2 array film was prepared on an FTO substrate. It demonstrates that the novel flower-like TiO2 nanostructure could efficiently improve the light harvesting efficiency and inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes in perovskite solar cells. Eventually, the best PCE of flower-like TiO2 ETL based solar cells has reached 15.71%. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest PCE for low-temperature processed 3D TiO2 ETL based perovskite devices. Moreover, the PCE of the flower-like TiO2 ETL based device is even higher than that of the traditional mesoporous TiO2 ETL based devices with less hysteresis. Such all low-temperature processed technologies with highly reproducible properties and excellent PCEs are beneficial for the industrial scale up of perovskite solar cells in new photovoltaic fields.
