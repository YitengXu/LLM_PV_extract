    , Accepted 22nd July 2017First published on 27th July 2017AbstractDye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs) have niche prospects for electricity-generating windows that could equip buildings for energy-sustainable future cities. However, this ‘smart window’ technology is being held back by a lack of understanding in how the dye interacts with its device environment at the molecular level. A better appreciation of the dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structure of the DSC working electrodes would be particularly valuable since associated structure–function relationships could be established; these rules would provide a ‘toolkit’ for the molecular engineering of more suitable DSC dyes via rational design. Previous materials characterisation efforts have been limited to determining this interfacial structure within an environment exposed to air or situated in a solvent medium. This study is the first to reveal the structure of this buried interface within the functional device environment, and represents the first application of in situ neutron reflectometry to DSC research. By incorporating the electrolyte into the structural model of this buried interface, we reveal how lithium cations from the electrolyte constituents influence the dye⋯TiO2 binding configuration of an organic sensitiser, MK-44, via Li+ complexation to the cyanoacrylate group. This dye is the molecular congener of the high-performance MK-2 DSC dye, whose hexa-alkyl chains appear to stabilise it from Li+ complexation. Our in situ neutron reflectometry findings are built up from auxiliary structural models derived from ex situ X-ray reflectometry and corroborated via density functional theory and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy. Significant differences between the in situ and ex situ dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structures are found, highlighting the need to characterise the molecular structure of DSC working electrodes while in a fully assembled device.
1 Introduction
Since the seminal demonstration of dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs),1 these devices have become a topic of increasing research interest, owing to their potential for low-cost, efficient and environmentally-friendly electrical power generation.2 Indeed, these factors, coupled with the transparent nature of DSCs and their ability to perform particularly well under diffuse light conditions, imbues this technology with niche prospects for ‘smart window’ applications.3–5 A typical DSC employs a photosensitive dye as the light harvester. This dye is adsorbed onto the surface of a TiO2 nanostructure, such that the photoabsorbed dye can inject an electron into the TiO2 conduction band; the dye⋯TiO2 composite thus acts as the working electrode of a DSC device. The electrical current passes to a counter electrode, composed of a transparent conducting oxide, which is classically coated by platinum to catalyse an electrolytic process whereby a liquid redox electrolyte (e.g. I−/I3−), that is sandwiched between the two electrodes, returns the photo-excited dye to its ground state, thereby completing the electrical circuit.6
To date, many different dye species have been synthesised and their power-conversion efficiency (PCE) examined in functional devices.7 Historically, dyes based on metal-centred complexes, such as ruthenium8,9 or zinc,10 have achieved the highest efficiencies; with a zinc porphyrin-based dye topping 13.0% efficiency,11 while another can reach 13.1% if co-sensitised with an organic chromophore.12 However, increasingly restrictive environmental regulations stand against the use of metals in these dyes; and some, such as ruthenium, are also scarce in natural abundance. These factors make such dyes expensive to produce and unsuitable for cost-effective, environmentally friendly photovoltaic technologies.
Metal-free organic dyes have recently superseded the maximum PCE of DSCs containing metal-based dyes, via the record-breaking efficiency of 14.3% being obtained using a DSC working electrode that features two co-sensitised metal-free organic dyes.13 A handful of singly-sensitised organic dyes have also been able to challenge the historical DSC efficiencies set by singly-sensitised metal-complex dyes.14,15 The development of metal-free organic-dyes is therefore taking the forefront of DSC research. Such developments are particularly compelling in view of the fact that metal-free organic dyes promise cheaper, more environmentally friendly synthetic routes and greater molecular design flexibility than their metal-containing counterparts.7
The dye is a particularly important constituent of a DSC device given it has a dual function: acting as the light harvester; and being responsible for the electron injection process that supplies the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor to which the dye is adsorbed, to initiate the electrical current in DSC circuitry. It is also commonplace to introduce alkyl chains into dye structures, to tune the corresponding dye⋯TiO2 interface against undesirable electron recombination or dye aggregation effects.7,16–19 Given that these electronic and molecular characteristics define the key functions of the dye⋯TiO2 working electrode,20–23 DSC performance is predicated on the nature of the structure, orientation and packing density of the dye at the TiO2 interface.
A range of materials characterisation techniques have been used to infer these dye structural attributes at the TiO2 interface. Such studies have generally been limited to ex situ methods,24 wherein average dye orientations on exposed TiO2 surfaces have been deduced via X-ray reflectometry25,26 or near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (NEXAFS).27,28 A few pseudo in situ infra-red spectroscopy29 or atomic force microscopy30 studies on dye⋯TiO2 composites (pseudo in situ in the sense that the composites reside within device-relevant solvents) have nonetheless inferred average dye orientations on TiO2 with help from theoretical calculations; while a similarly pseudo in situ NEXAFS31 study draws qualitative conclusions about dye orientation in solvents with the aid of corroboratory findings from photoelectron spectroscopy. Meanwhile, two recent ex situ scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) studies32,33 have experimentally imaged the anionic ruthenium-based dye, N3, residing on TiO2 surfaces. One of these studies33 also employed scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS)33 which distinguished various conformations of N3 dye anions existing on TiO2. The imaging part of this study was able to distinguish dye monomers from its dimers, but not molecular features at the resolution needed to discern dye structure, orientations or packing densities on TiO2 surfaces. One therefore needs a way to probe this dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structure at the atomic scale, and within a more closely emulated device environment, in order to complement these state-of-the-art developments in materials characterisation.
This work will show that the complementary use of X-ray and neutron reflectometry presents a way forward in this regard. To this end, we employ in situ neutron reflectometry to probe the buried interfacial structure of a DSC working electrode within a solid–liquid environment, and support our results with ex situ XRR measurements, density functional theory calculations and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a study where neutron reflectometry has been employed in DSC research. Moreover, the study is unprecedented in demonstrating how a materials characterisation tool can access this dye⋯TiO2 structure while it is embedded within a buried interface and submerged by a redox (I−/I3−) electrolyte solution, i.e. within a material environment that emulates a functional DSC device.
The subject materials for these reflectometry studies comprise thin films of TiO2 sensitised with one of two metal-free organic dyes and submerged within an electrolyte solution to create a solid–liquid interface. The high performance dye, 2-cyano-3-[5′′′-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-3′,3′′,3′′′,4-tetra-n-hexyl-[2,2′,5′,2′′,5′′,2′′′]-quaterthiophen-5-yl]acrylic acid (MK-2),34 and its smaller analogue, 2-cyano-3-(5-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)thiophen-2-yl)acrylic acid (MK-44), as shown in Fig. 1, were the two selected sensitisers. This choice reflects the wide interest that the MK series of metal-free organic dyes has attracted on account of their large molar adsorption coefficients,22 good long-term stability35 and high-performance,14 with MK-2 achieving one of the highest efficiencies for a metal-free organic dye of nearly 8%.34 In addition, DSCs that employ MK-2 have recently demonstrated success in their application as electricity-generating windows.36
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures and preferred TiO2 binding modes of; (a) MK-2; and (b) MK-44.37,38 Annotated lateral molecular lengths and widths are taken from their crystal structures which were derived from X-ray diffraction data.39 Since neutrons are able to detect hydrogen atoms much better than X-rays, additional values (in parentheses) for these lateral dimensions are presented which incorporates the explicit position and bond lengths of hydrogen atoms, whose presence may be discounted during XRR studies. It is notable here, that the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid hydroxyl group on MK-44 is not considered during these measurements, as when bound to the TiO2 surface, this hydrogen is only present via a hydrogen bond to the exposed TiO2 surface hydroxide groups. For reference, an average carbon-hydrogen bond length is considered to be 1.08 Å.40 
2 Experimental and computational methods
2.1 Preparation and sensitisation of TiO2 thin-films
In accordance with previous work,25 amorphous TiO2 thin films were deposited on silicon (100) wafers in order to provide the atomically flat surface required for reflectometry measurements. This practical requirement for TiO2 can be met while retaining device-relevant results: previous work has shown that organic molecules adsorb onto TiO2 with the same type of binding mode, whether they are sensitised onto amorphous or crystalline TiO2.41,42 These thin films were produced using an ASM Microchemistry flow-type, hot-walled, F-120 atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor, which was maintained at 1 mBar pressure and using a deposition temperature of 120 °C. Vaporous TiCl4 and H2O precursors were delivered from Peltier-cooled reservoirs maintained at 20 °C, following a sequential dosing scheme of 0.4 s TiCl4 exposure, a 1.0 s N2 purge, a 1.0 s H2O pulse and a final 1.5 s N2 purge.43 This process was repeated for 200 cycles. A TiO2 growth rate of ∼0.04 nm per cycle yielded a ∼8 nm thick TiO2 thin film. The surface appearance of this film was imaged via atomic force microscopy and its amorphous nature was confirmed by Bragg–Brentano X-ray diffraction measurements (see ESI, §1†).
Prior to dye sensitisation, these films were heated to 80 °C for a minimum of 30 minutes in order to remove any residual water on their surface. Successful water eradication was confirmed by performing X-ray reflectometry (§see 2.2) on the untreated substrate; whereupon the fits to the data required only a two-layer model, thus confirming the absence of any surface contamination such as residual trace amounts of water. Sensitisation was achieved by submersing the TiO2 films in a 0.3 mM dye solution of MK-2 (95%, Sigma-Aldrich) or MK-44 (synthesised via the method of Koumura et al.34) in 1:1:1 acetonitrile:tert-butanol:toluene for 20 hours. The resulting films were rinsed with neat acetonitrile and dried under a flow of nitrogen gas prior to being subject to reflectometry measurements.
2.2 X-ray reflectometry (XRR)
XRR measurements were conducted using a Panalytical X'pert Pro reflectometer that employed a Cu Kα X-ray source (λ = 1.541 Å). The X-ray beam was collimated using a Göbel mirror with a 0.1 mm slit and a post-sample parallel collimator. Reflectivity data were collected over a detector range of 0.1° < 2θ < 10.0°, incrementing in 0.02° steps, with a count time of 10 s per step. Data were acquired for the TiO2 substrate before and after its dye sensitisation, using the same substrate. The results were refined using the MOTOFIT package44 for Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) to reveal associated structural parameters, with X-ray reflectivity plotted as a function of the momentum transfer vector (Q) perpendicular to the TiO2 surface (eqn (1)). (1)
Nominal values for the X-ray scattering-length density (SLDx) for each layer were used to prepare initial structural models, using a three-layer approach, whereby values of 20.1 × 10−6 Å−2, 18.9 × 10−6 Å−2 and 31.2 × 10−6 Å−2 represented the silicon wafer, the native oxide layer and TiO2 film, respectively. SLDx values of 11.2 × 10−6 Å−2 and 12.7 × 10−6 Å−2 were calculated for MK-2 and MK-44 respectively, using (2): (2)where re refers to the classical electron radius (2.81 × 10−15 m), Z is the sum of atomic numbers (i.e. the total number of electrons) in each molecule (512 and 194 for MK-2 and MK-44 respectively), and V is the molecular volume of the dye, determined from its crystal structure (1284.34 Å3 and 428.96 Å3 respectively).39
2.3 Neutron reflectometry (NR)
Three electrolyte solutions were prepared and sequentially tested with the sensitised TiO2 substrate in a solid–liquid cell: neat deuterated acetonitrile (d3-MeCN, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich); 0.7 M LiI (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in d3-MeCN; and 0.7 M LiI & 0.05 M I2 (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) in d3-MeCN. For simplicity, these are henceforth referred to as solutions 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
Neutron reflectometry measurements were conducted using the Platypus time-of-flight reflectometer at the OPAL research reactor, ANSTO, Sydney, Australia.45 All measurements followed the same scan parameters using a cold neutron spectrum of 3.0 Å < λ < 18.0 Å, with a resolution ΔQ/Q = 5.1%. Beam profiles were collected at θ = 0.5°, 2.0° and 4° giving a maximum Q range of 0.006–0.300 Å−1. Three measurements were conducted on each dye using solutions 1–3; for solutions 2 and 3, neutron data acquisition was initiated 10 minutes after LiI or I2 had been added in order to ensure sufficient time for solution mixing and chemical reactions. Data were reduced taking into account direct beam transmission through the silicon substrate and corrected for background.
The reduced data were co-refined using the MOTOFIT package44 for Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) with Monte-Carlo re-sampling46 to reveal associated structural parameters and corresponding standard deviations, with reflectivity plotted as a function of the momentum transfer vector (Q) perpendicular to the TiO2 surface (see eqn (1)). Further details on this fitting process are provided in the ESI, §3 and §6.†
Nominal values for the neutron scattering-length density (SLDn) for each layer (Table 1) were calculated using (3) and used to prepare initial structural models. (3)where ∑bc is the sum of isotopic coherent scattering lengths in the molecule;47NA is Avogadro's constant; ρ is the mass density; V is the molecular volume of the dye, determined from its crystal structure; and M is the molecular mass.

All of the NR fits were modelled using a three-layer approach, with a 5 Å native oxide layer (SLDn = 3.47 × 10−6 Å−2). The SLDn of the silicon super-phase was fixed at 2.07 × 10−6 Å−2 and the TiO2 substrate at 2.10 × 10−6 Å−2 after initial model fitting. Since the length-scale of these dyes was on the limits of detection for these NR data, the interfacial layer roughness values were fixed in accordance with XRR results, with R = 2.5 Å, 2.5 Å and 3.5 Å for the silicon super-phase, native oxide and TiO2 interfaces, respectively (Table 1).
Reflectivity models were constructed and fitted to achieve the best least-squares fits. Models were constructed initially using two layers (SiO2 and TiO2) with a silicon super-phase. A third, dye layer was subsequently added to yield the simplest yet most physically reasonable model. The results presented here arise from the best fits to the data using these simple 3-layer models, applying physically reasonable values. It should be noted that when fits were attempted with model parameters completely unconstrained, the dye-layer thicknesses were greater than those calculated as the maximum possible thicknesses for a dye monolayer. As a result, it was necessary to constrain the dye thickness to a sensible range of values. Establishing such boundary conditions for the model ensured that physically reasonable results were realised, based on known dimensions and scattering-length densities of constituent molecules. Although this made fitting more difficult, consistent fits were achieved via a combination of co-refinement of similar data sets and Monte-Carlo re-sampling (see ESI for details, §5†).
2.4 UV/vis absorption spectroscopy
A single layer mesoporous TiO2 thin-film was prepared on a microscope slide by the doctor blade technique. This was then sensitised in a 0.3 mM solution of MK-44 dye in 1:1:1 acetonitrile:tert-butanol:toluene solvent for 5 minutes, before being subsequently rinsed with neat acetonitrile. The film was then treated with a 0.5 M solution of lithium iodide (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile (anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich), added via a pipette with a 5 s rinse, before being further rinsed with minimal amounts of neat acetonitrile. The absorption spectrum of the film was measured prior to and post lithium iodide treatment using a Cary 300 UV/vis Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). Further details are given in the ESI, §6.†
2.5 Density functional theory calculations
Electronic structure calculations of the dye⋯TiO2 interface were performed using density functional theory within the Gaussian09 software.49 A nine-unit TiO2 cluster50,51 was used to form a dye⋯TiO2 adsorption model. The structure and energy of the bidentate bridging and CN/COO adsorption modes24 were calculated with and without surrounding Li+ ions, respectively (see ESI, §6†). Geometry optimisations were carried out via the hybrid functional B3LYP52 coupled with the 3-21g* basis set. Frequency calculations were conducted in order to confirm that the optimised geometry possessed a minimum energy at same theory level.
3 Results and discussion
The ultimate goal of this work is to study the dye⋯TiO2 structure at a buried interface, i.e. under the environmental conditions which correspond to the DSC working electrode within a functional device. Within this scope, the structure, orientation and packing density of the dye at the TiO2 interface are sought. Reflectometry stands to be helpful since it can deliver such structural information via the measurement of dye⋯TiO2 layer thickness, density, and interfacial roughness.25,26 More specifically, neutron reflectometry (NR) is ideally suited to such a study, since the small size of a neutron and its zero charge gives it the ability to penetrate deep into a material. In addition, NR is generally able to distinguish interfacial layers from each other with good contrast, since neutron scattering-length density (SLDn), which defines this contrast, tends to be distinct for a given layer. Such distinction results from the complicated nature of neutron–nuclei interactions in neutron scattering.
To this end, the appropriate sample environment for such a study would comprise a solid–liquid environment of a DSC working electrode, wherein the dye-sensitised TiO2 solid is submerged by a redox electrolyte (I−/I3−) solution; thus, emulating the DSC working electrode within a functional device. However, since there appears to be no previous report of any DSC-based neutron reflectometry, let alone an in situ DSC-based neutron reflectometry study, it seemed logical to build up to this study by prefacing it with initial experiments on exposed DSC working electrodes using ex situ X-ray reflectometry (XRR). Therein, XRR has already demonstrated its use in the study of dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structures, and linking such structure with device performance.25 Accordingly, XRR studies can provide baseline interfacial structure details about the subject dyes on the TiO2 surface in a solid–air environment, prior to embedding the DSC working electrode within the electrolyte solution for the more complicated, and unprecedented, in situ neutron reflectometry investigations.
3.1 Dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structure of exposed DSC working electrodes
TiO2 films sensitised with MK-2 or MK-44 dye were first measured in a solid–air environment using ex situ XRR, to provide reference structural details about the exposed DSC working electrode for the subsequent in situ NR study. Each sensitised substrate was measured four times, at different points about the sample surface. Fig. 2 shows representative plots of experimentally observed and fitted data for MK-2 (red) and MK-44 (blue) adsorbed onto the amorphous TiO2 substrate (data sets showing all four measurements for each dye, and their SLDx profiles, can be found in the ESI, §2.2†). Structural parameters (SLDx; thickness; and roughness) for both the dye layer and TiO2 substrate (Table 2) were obtained from refinements of a three-layer model, consisting of: dye layer; TiO2 film; and a 5 Å thick native oxide layer on a silicon sub-phase. The SLDx of the native oxide layer and silicon substrate were fixed at 18.9 × 10−6 Å−2 and 20.1 × 10−6 Å−2 respectively.

3.1.1 MK-2 dye. 
3.1.1.1 Dye orientation on the TiO2 surface. 
Computational results have shown that the MK-2 dye binds to the TiO2 surface via a carboxylate bidentate bridging mode.37 For modelling purposes, the associated dye⋯TiO2 separation is taken as the average COO−⋯TiO2 bond length (2.05 Å).29 These reference structural parameters indicate that the maximum possible dye layer thickness (dmax) for a monolayer of MK-2 is 27.58 Å, cf. the sum of the dye⋯TiO2 separation, plus the fully extended length of the dye molecule, defined as the distance between atoms O2 and C52 in the crystal structure (25.53 Å; see ESI, §2.1†).39 A dye-layer thickness of dmax would therefore correspond to the situation where all dye molecules align perpendicular to the TiO2 surface.
The XRR results reveal an actual dye-layer thickness (dobs) of 23.2 ± 0.2 Å, indicating that MK-2 is adsorbed as a monolayer adopting a tilt angle (α) of 65.1 ± 1.1° with respect to the TiO2 surface plane (Fig. 3). The standard deviation for the tilt angle is presented as the error in the measured dye-layer thickness over the four XRR measurements.
 Fig. 3  Visualisation of (a) MK-2; and (b) MK-44 bound to a TiO2 surface (note that potential hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl group and exposed hydrogens of the TiO2 surface are emitted for clarity).34 Models were created using ChemBio3D (PerkinElmer). The dye⋯TiO2 separation was fixed at 2.05 Å and the molecular tilt adjusted to achieve a layer thickness representative of that observed by XRR. The tilt angle (α) of the dye bound to the TiO2 surface is calculated from dmax and dobs values using basic trigonometric considerations (as shown in previous work and ESI, §2.3†);25 the theoretical area-per-molecule (APM) of the dye, as projected onto the TiO2 surface, is calculated by multiplying the molecular width of the dye with its length (L) as projected on the TiO2 surface, L = dmaxcos(α). This calculation assumes a planar dye molecule which is reasonable in the case of the MK-2 and MK-44 dyes, given their crystal structures show exceptional levels of molecular planarity.39 
3.1.1.2 Dye coverage over the TiO2 surface. 
An SLDx of 10.1 × 10−6 Å−2 was observed for the MK-2 dye, corresponding to a dye layer with mass density of 1.11 g cm−3 (eqn (4)), which is comparable to other high performance dyes.26 (4)where NA is Avogadro's number, ρ is the mass density and M is the molecular mass of MK-2 (955.42 u). The average measured area per molecule (APM) as projected onto the TiO2 surface (61.6 ± 1.0 Å2) was determined from this SLD value, according to eqn (5): (5)where dobs is the observed dye-layer thickness. (6)
The associated dye surface concentration, 2.7 × 10−10 mol cm−2 (eqn (6)), is of a magnitude expected for a dye monolayer and is in good agreement with such concentrations measured in previous dye absorption studies on amorphous TiO2 films.25,53Eqn (7) determines a dye volume fraction (φ) of 0.90 ± 0.02 upon the TiO2 surface, similar to values obtained in the literature.18 (7)where SLDobs is the observed scattering-length density for the dye layer, and SLDcalc is the scattering-length density calculated using eqn (2) which assumes 100% surface coverage.
The maximum possible width of the MK-2 dye molecule is 18.23 Å, as defined by the separation between the C49 and C59 atoms in its crystal structure, whose vector lies perpendicular to the longest molecular axis (see ESI, §2.1†).39 The calculated APM for a single molecule is therefore given as 211.7 Å2 (Fig. 3). This effectively represents the maximum theoretical molecular footprint of the dye as per its projection onto the TiO2 surface.
3.1.1.3 Intermolecular spacing between dyes on the TiO2 surface. 
In previous work, it has been possible to estimate inter-dye spacing on the TiO2 surface via a measure of the intermolecular separation between parallel molecular planes of dyes.25 However, the literature suggests that the hexa-alkyl chains of adjacent MK-2 molecules intertwine significantly,14,54 the level of which is not directly determinable using XRR. Indeed, the fact that the theoretical molecular footprint of a single, isolated, MK-2 molecule is ∼3.5 times larger than that measured for those on the TiO2 surface, is suggestive of such intertwining occurring in this instance. The crystal structure of MK-2 shows adjacent molecules with up to five hexa-alkyl chain carbons intertwining (equating to a distance of up to ∼5.05 Å along each intertwining chain).39 Such an inter-digitation of alkyl groups would reduce the effective width of the MK-2 molecule on the TiO2 surface to ∼8.13 Å. Given the measured APM of 61.6 ± 1.0 Å2 and tilt angle of α = 65.1 ± 1.1° for MK-2 on TiO2, as determined by XRR at the given dye coverage, the intermolecular separation of MK-2 on the TiO2 surface will therefore be interdependent upon this chain inter-digitation. It is therefore deemed more appropriate to suggest a range of expected intermolecular separations, 3.26 Å–7.01 Å, dependent upon the extent of hexa-alkyl chain inter-digitation (see ESI, §2.4†) at the given dye coverage. It would also not seem unreasonable to postulate that molecules experiencing varying degrees of hexa-alkyl chain inter-digitation, and therefore intermolecular separation, may co-exist on the same surface.54

Zhang et al. have shown that small cyanoacrylic-bound dyes (similar in structure to MK-44) energetically prefer a binding mode which employs both the carboxylic acid and nitrile group of the cyanoacrylic acid moiety (Fig. 1(b)), over the bidentate bridging mode that is preferred for MK-2.38 They report a CN⋯TiO2 separation of 2.20 Å for this so-called CN/COO binding configuration.38 Steric hindrance associated with the hexa-alkyl chains in MK-2 appears to preclude the dye⋯TiO2 binding configuration indicated for MK-44, judging from its crystal structure.39 A molecular width of 13.35 Å was calculated for MK-44, as defined by the separation between O1 and C1 atoms in its crystal structure (see ESI, §2.1†).39MK-44 molecules may extend up from the TiO2 surface to a maximum, dmax, of 10.95 Å, as determined by the sum of the COOH⋯TiO2 separation (2.05 Å)29 and the molecular height of MK-44 which is defined as the distance between C3 and O2 atoms (see ESI, §2.1†) where the dye molecule would align perpendicular to the TiO2 surface (8.90 Å).39
The XRR results on MK-44 reveal a dye-layer thickness of 9.6 ± 0.2 Å. Based on the model structural parameters defined above, this suggests that a monolayer of MK-44 dye molecules exists, wherein the dye adopts an average tilt angle (α) of 61.2 ± 2.2° relative to the TiO2 surface (Fig. 3). This is indicative of the suggested binding geometry.
3.1.2.2 Dye coverage over the TiO2 surface. 
The SLDx for the MK-44 dye layer in the XRR structural model is 9.6 ± 0.2 × 10−6 Å−2, which corresponds to a dye layer with density of 1.09 g cm−3 (eqn (4)), very similar to that observed for MK-2. The average measured area per molecule (APM) as projected onto the TiO2 surface (59.3 ± 2.3 Å2) was duly calculated from eqn (5), and is comparable to a theoretical APM of 70.2 Å2. A dye surface concentration of 2.8 × 10−10 mol cm−2 was determined viaeqn (6), again comparable to that of MK-2. The ratio of observed and calculated SLD values (eqn (7)) yielded an MK-44 volume fraction (φ) of 0.75 ± 0.02 on the TiO2 surface. All of these factors indicate that a similar level of dye coverage was achieved for the MK-2 and MK-44 sensitized TiO2 samples used in these XRR experiments.
3.1.2.3 Intermolecular spacing between dyes on the TiO2 surface. 
The average inter-dye spacing on the TiO2 surface, as defined by the distance between parallel molecular faces in adjacent dyes, was estimated to be 4.4 ± 0.2 Å assuming no lateral overlap (Fig. 3(b)). This value lies outside the generally accepted range of distances for π⋯π stacking interactions (<3.3–3.8 Å).55 The presence of such interactions may have otherwise been assumed intuitively to be occurring between MK-44 molecules on the TiO2 surface, due to the small size and largely delocalised π-electronic structure of this dye. This value is nonetheless smaller than the theoretical 5.3 Å molecular length, as projected onto the surface, for an isolated MK-44 molecule, suggesting a minimal intermolecular facial overlap of 0.9 Å.

3.2 Dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structure of DSC working electrodes buried under a solution of I−/I3− redox electrolyte
Having obtained this reference structural information on the exposed MK dye⋯TiO2 interfaces via XRR, these interfacial structures were then probed within the functional DSC device environment using in situ neutron reflectometry. A solid–liquid sample environment, which emulated that of the working electrode within the functional DSC device, was created by submerging the dye⋯TiO2 solid interface within a redox electrolyte (I−/I3−) solution, which is bounded with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass coated with a platinum catalyst. Each interface was tested under two different electrolyte solution conditions, one containing LiI in d3-MeCN and the other hosting I2 as well as LiI in d3-MeCN. Each interface was also studied within a third solution that contained only d3-MeCN solvent, for the purposes of comparison. A deuterated solvent was used in order to enhance the SLDn contrast, and therefore the reflectometry signal of the dye–liquid interface. The calculated neutron SLDn values for MK-2 and MK-44 are 1.3 × 10−6 Å−2 and 2.7 × 10−6 Å−2 (eqn (3)), compared to 4.9 × 10−6 Å−2 and 1.3 × 10−6 Å−2 for the deuterated and hydrogenated isotopomers of acetonitrile, respectively. In situ neutron reflectometry was applied in transmission mode whereby neutrons penetrated through a silicon substrate to reach each solid–liquid sample environment, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The accompanying Fig. 4(b) shows how the SLDn variation of each layer of this emulated DSC device exhibits sufficient contrast for it to be used to discriminate NR signal exclusively from the desired dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structure.

Underlined values were fixed during the refinement procedure for the purposes of simplification and to minimise any model ambiguity. After initial model fitting, the solution SLDn was fixed based on the position of the reflectivity critical edge, which is proportional to the SLDn of the solution phase and defined as . The SLDn was shown to increase from solutions 1–3 (see ESI, §4)

These refined parameters were compared across the three solutions used, in order to assess the effect of the electrolyte medium on the MK-2 or MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structures. In the discussion that follows, XRR results are frequently used for reference, except where the dmax value is concerned. This parameter is re-defined for the NR study since the XRR data analysis ignored the hydrogen atoms present in the dye for the calculation of dmax, owing to their effective invisibility on account of the negligible X-ray scattering from hydrogen; while hydrogens produce significant neutron scattering and so will contribute towards the observed dye-layer thickness. The dmax values for the NR study therefore included hydrogens explicitly in their calculation. To this end, the molecular length of MK-2 was taken as the distance between O2 and H52 atoms along the molecular mean plane of its crystal structure (26.23 Å);39 and its molecular width (20.44 Å) was defined as the distance between the H59 and H49 atoms, whose corresponding vector lies perpendicular to the molecular length (see ESI, §2.1†). Accordingly, the maximum dye thickness of a monolayer of MK-2 (dmax) was computed by summing this molecular length with the reference dye⋯TiO2 binding separation (2.05 Å),29i.e. dmax for MK-2 is 28.28 Å, when considering hydrogen atoms.
The dmax value of MK-44 for NR data analysis (12.04 Å) was calculated in a similar fashion, arising from the sum of its molecular length of 9.99 Å, defined as the distance between atoms O2 and H3, plus the dye⋯TiO2 separation (2.05 Å). The molecular width of MK-44, was also re-determined to incorporate hydrogen explicitly for the NR studies, using the separation between atoms O1 and H1 (14.30 Å) to define the value. This width was employed in calculations that involve the molecular footprint of the dye as projected on to the TiO2 surface, for a specified dye⋯TiO2 binding configuration (see ESI, §2.1†).

3.2.1 Buried MK-2 dye⋯TiO2 solid interfaces. 
3.2.1.1 MK-2 dye⋯TiO2 solid interface submerged within an acetonitrile solution. 
NR results on the MK-2 dye⋯TiO2 interface under neat d3-MeCN (solution 1) reveal a dye-layer thickness of 23.6 ± 1.9 Å with an SLDn of 1.9 ± 0.1 × 10−6 Å−2. The surface roughness was fixed at 6 Å, based on XRR data, in order to simplify the modelling process. This yields a dye volume fraction of 0.82, in good agreement with the literature22 (although 0.08 lower than XRR results). This suggests that the dye exhibits good TiO2 surface passivation with respect to the solvent. Such protection of the TiO2 surface can be attributed to the presence of hexyl-alkyl chains on the thiophene moieties of MK-2.56
Using the same trigonometric considerations as per §3.1.1, a tilt angle (α) of 56.6 ± 7.1° was calculated. This means that the projection of a single molecule of MK-2 onto the TiO2 surface would theoretically occupy an area of 310.0 ± 58.9 Å2, by multiplying molecular width with the molecular length as projected onto the TiO2 surface (L = dmaxcos(α)). However, the measured APM, calculated using (eqn (5)), was 64.6 ± 5.2 Å2. This is five times smaller than the theoretical value of this area, suggesting that significant overlap of adjacent MK-2 dye molecules must be present. MK-2 dye molecules can overlap in two ways: facially, perpendicular to the plane of the molecular tilt, as described by the inter-dye spacing on the TiO2 surface; or laterally, via the inter-digitation of hexa-alkyl chains on adjacent MK-2 molecules (see ESI, §2.4†). As per the XRR study, it is not possible to measure directly the extent of dye overlap. It is therefore more appropriate to suggest a range of inter-dye separations. When MK-2 is confined within a crystal lattice, five carbons on the hexa-alkyl chains overlap.39 Assuming that this represents an upper boundary condition, lateral dye overlap could afford an effective dye molecular width that ranges anywhere from 9.79 Å (five-carbon overlap) to 19.89 Å (no overlap, Fig. 1). Based on the observed APM value, the facial dye overlap (inter-dye spacing) could therefore range from 3.26–6.62 Å, which is in good accord with the XRR findings.
3.2.1.2 MK-2 dye⋯TiO2 solid interface submerged within an electrolyte solution. 
Upon addition of lithium iodide, the MK-2 dye-layer thickness remains constant within error. However, the SLDn increases significantly to 2.5 ± 0.1 × 10−6 Å−2, corresponding to a lower dye volume fraction of 0.65 and higher measured APM of 80.7 ± 6.5 Å2. This indicates an increase in solvent ingress into the dye layer, which could result from desorption of weakly bound or physisorbed species induced by solvent⋯dye or lithium⋯dye interactions,37,57–59 or an increase in the bulk solvent density (see ESI, §4†).
NR measurements conducted after the formation of the I−/I3− redox couple, induced by adding iodine to the lithium iodide (solution 3), are associated with a very modest change in SLDn at best, corresponding to a dye volume fraction of 0.69 and measured APM of 81.4 ± 5.5 Å2. Indeed, the SLDn is the same as that of solution 2 within statistical error. This indicates that no further solvent ingress into the dye layer occurs during the evolution of the redox couple from the lithium iodide reference point.
The origins of this dye SLDn variation are presumably independent of the dye-layer thickness, given that there is no accompanying significant change in the dye-layer thickness observed upon addition of the electrolyte constituents. Such an elevation in dye SLDn implies a significant increase in the mass density of the dye layer, given all other parameters in eqn (4) are constants for a given dye. A tighter packing of molecules could result from enhanced ingress of solvent between the dye molecules; thus, an overall increase in the dye-layer SLDn. The inclusion of I− anions into the solution (with a large, positive coherent scattering length of 5.28 fm)47 may also contribute to this increase in mass density. As such, this effect is deemed to originate primarily from the solvent phase, as opposed to a rearrangement of dye molecules on the surface; indeed, the latter scenario would likely be accompanied by a change in the dye-layer thickness which is not observed.


3.2.2 Buried MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 solid interfaces. 
3.2.2.1 MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 solid interface submerged within an acetonitrile solution. 
NR results indicate that the MK-44 dye-layer is 9.2 ± 0.7 Å thick under a d3-MeCN environment (solution 1). Given the Q range of the neutron reflectometry measurement, this parameter carries a noticeable standard deviation. However, the fitted value is in good agreement with the XRR determination, and the effective dye-layer contribution is substantial (see Fig. S9 in the ESI, §3.1†). The corresponding tilt angle of the dye with respect to the TiO2 surface is 60.9 ± 7.9° while the calculated area per single molecule is 75.3 ± 18.3 Å2, in good agreement with the values observed using XRR. The observed dye SLDn is 2.9 ± 0.6 × 10−6 Å−2, slightly larger than the calculated value (2.8 × 10−6 Å−2; eqn (2)). This could indicate that the dye layer may be experiencing some solvent ingress, with a dye volume fraction of 0.94 (eqn (7)). It is worth noting that the volume fraction observed here is much higher than observed using XRR (0.75), and it represents a near-complete dye coverage over the TiO2 surface. This situation would imply a tight packing of dye molecules, which would manifest as shorter intermolecular distances. The APM of MK-44 in solution 1 was determined to be 50.5 ± 3.9 Å2 (eqn (5)), which implies an inter-dye spacing of 3.4 ± 0.3 Å. Indeed, this is short, suggesting that the dyes are somewhat condensed together.
3.2.2.2 MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 solid interface submerged within an electrolyte solution. 
The addition of lithium iodide to solution 1 (to create solution 2) results in a significant increase in dye-layer thickness, from 9.2 ± 0.7 Å to 15.9 ± 1.0 Å. The dye SLDn follows a similar trend, increasing from solution 1 to 2 but then remaining effectively constant between solutions 2 and 3. While the dye SLDn enhancement is bordering on statistical error assuming independent parameters, the dye layer and dye SLDn values follow the same trend between solutions 1–3 which suggests the changes have a correlated underlying structural origin. With this in mind, the increase in dye SLDn from solution 1 to 2 (Table 3) suggests a corresponding decrease in dye volume fraction to 0.57 (see eqn (7)). As already intimated, further addition of I2 (solution 3) sees all three parameters remaining relatively constant, with a dye thickness of 15.9 ± 1.0 Å and dye SLDn of 3.8 ± 0.4 × 10−6 Å−2 which corresponds to a slight reduction in dye volume fraction to 0.48 from solution 2.
This significant increase in dye-layer thickness realised upon the addition of the lithium iodide to the acetonitrile solution has important implications for the nature of the dye⋯TiO2 anchoring mode. The XRR results provide evidence that MK-44 anchors onto the TiO2 surface via a bidentate binding configuration involving the nitrile and carboxylic acid groups of the cyanoacrylate moiety when the DSC working electrode is exposed to air (see §3.1.2.1). Based on the comparable dye-layer thickness obtained in these NR results of MK-44 in solution 1, it would appear that this so-called CN/COO binding configuration is maintained when this dye⋯TiO2 interface is immersed in acetonitrile solution. However, the much larger dye-layer thickness observed by NR for this interface in solutions 2 and 3 is inconsistent with this CN/COO binding configuration. Rather, it would seem that the addition of lithium iodide to the acetonitrile solution somehow causes a change in the MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 binding configuration such that the dye stands taller upon the TiO2 surface, i.e. a thicker dye layer results. One might anticipate that such a change could result in an associated modulation of the dye SLDn since the mass density of the dye layer may be affected; indeed, a 25% variation in this SLDn is suggested by the NR data (see Table 3).


3.2.3 Influence of electrolyte constituents on the MK-44 dye binding configuration. 
A possible rationale behind these NR observations for MK-44 could involve a mechanism whereby the lithium cations (Li+) complex with the nitrile and carboxylate groups of the MK-44 dye, in a manner illustrated in Fig. 6. Indeed, Li+ ions have been shown to strongly interact with both the carboxylate and nitrile moieties of cyanoacrylic groups bound to other dyes57 on TiO2 surfaces. In such an event, the ability of the MK-44 dye to anchor onto the TiO2 surface via the cyanoacrylic acid in the CN/COO binding configuration may be perturbed owing to competing interactions between the cyanoacrylic acid and the lithium cation. Accordingly, it might become more energetically favourable for the dye to adopt another type of binding configuration to circumvent this competition. To that end, the dye would presumably revert to the more common bidentate bridging dye⋯TiO2 binding configuration, as is observed in the MK-2 dye (see §3.1.1.1).
 Fig. 6  Molecular structure of MK-44 with bidentate bridging geometry adopted in the presence of Li+ ions, indicating the dmax (15.74 Å) and molecular width (7.74 Å). The red shaded boxes indicate sections of the TiO2 surface which are potentially exposed to solvent/electrolyte upon the change in dye geometry. 
UV/vis absorption spectroscopy was employed to experimentally check this hypothesis. Thereby, a red shift in the MK-44 absorption spectrum was observed upon addition of lithium iodide to a film of MK-44 sensitised TiO2 (see ESI, §6,† for further details). This bathochromic effect is indicative of the formation of dye⋯Li+ interactions,58 consistent with our hypothesis of MK-44 dye⋯Li+ complexation, arising from our NR observations.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also employed in order to test this proposed mechanism. Accordingly, computational models of MK-44 and the structure shown in Fig. 6 were generated and geometry optimised, in the absence and presence of Li+ cations (see ESI, §7,† for computational details). In the absence of Li+ cations, the dye⋯TiO2 structure with a MK-44 CN/COO binding mode was determined to be 0.19 eV lower in energy than that of the more common bidentate-bridging mode (as observed in MK-2). This is consistent with our ex situ XRR findings and the in situ NR structural results before Li+ ions have been added to the solution environment. The energy reduction in this DFT comparison of adsorption modes is also consistent with the red shifting observed in the associated UV/vis absorption spectroscopy results mentioned above. Our DFT results are also corroborated by related computational work.38
The optimised geometry of the MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structure in the presence of Li+ was then calculated, assuming that isomeric geometry is maintained upon addition of this cation.60 Li+⋯N and Li+⋯O interactions were both considered as possible binding options while MK-44 was modelled according to two feasible adsorption modes, CN/COO and bidentate bridging. This afforded a total of six computational models of the dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structure in the presence of Li+ ions. The lowest energy model featured a Li⋯O interaction with a bidentate bridging adsorption mode. This stands to reason given that MK-44 will manifest in a deprotonated state in acetonitrile solution such that Li+ ions will be attracted to the negative charge on the carboxylate moiety.
These DFT results are also consistent with the NR measurements on the MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 interface submerged under solution 2 or 3, where lithium ions are present, as manifested by a much thicker dye layer (15.9 ± 1.0 Å in both cases), compared with that in solution 1 which is void of Li+ ions, cf. a MK-44 dye-layer thickness of 9.2 Å. Indeed, a change in MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 anchoring mode to a bidentate bridging geometry would result in a maximum possible observable dye-layer thickness (dBBmax) of 17.79 Å. This corresponds to the sum of the total length of the dye molecule, standing perpendicular to the TiO2 surface in this bidentate bridging mode (15.74 Å), and the 2.05 Å dye⋯TiO2 separation (Fig. 6), i.e. dBBmax corresponds well with the NR results on the MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 interface submerged under solutions 2 or 3.
The structural parameters that derive from this observed dye-layer thickness in solutions 2 and 3 also seem reasonable when considering a bidentate bridging dye⋯TiO2 anchoring mode: the tilt angle of the dye with respect to the TiO2 surface is 63.3 ± 7.5°, and the theoretical APM is 61.8 ± 16.2 Å, as determined by the product of the MK-44 molecular width (7.74 Å) and dBBmaxcos(α). This compares to the measured APM, as calculated using eqn (5), of 48.0 ± 3.0 Å and 57.1 ± 3.6 Å for solutions 2 and 3 respectively, indicating approximately one MK-44 molecule per measured area.
A further consequence of the surface rearrangement on this MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 interface is that a greater proportion of the TiO2 surface will likely become exposed to solvent. This can be rationalised as follows. Since the dye sensitisation process is conducted prior to the addition of lithium iodide, the dye coverage is limited by the molecular footprint that the dye molecules initially cast on the TiO2 as they bind in the CN/COO anchoring configuration. This molecular footprint is larger than that which would have been obtained if the dye had sensitised TiO2via the bidentate bridging mode where the dyes would have stood taller on the semiconductor surface. The initial binding of the dyes to TiO2 in the CN/COO mode will have therefore effectively blocked binding sites on the TiO2 surface that may have otherwise been accessible if the dyes had sensitised via a bidentate bridging anchoring mode. The large molecular footprint of the dye in the CN/COO binding configuration initially passivates the TiO2 surface to solvent ingress. Yet, upon addition of lithium iodide, whereby the binding geometry changes to the bidentate bridging mode owing to dye⋯Li+ complexation, the previously blocked TiO2 binding sites become exposed to solvent and thus electrolyte species. Since this occurs post-sensitisation, no additional dye molecules are available to occupy the vacancies created by this dye anchoring reconfiguration process. As such, this may have a detrimental effect on the photoelectrochemical performance of this dye in functioning DSC devices, as unwanted electron recombination reactions between the TiO2 and electrolyte could readily occur.21 Experimental evidence for this increased solvent ingress, as a function of dye⋯TiO2 binding reconfiguration, is indicated in the NR results via the slight increase in dye SLDn value observed between solution 1 and solutions 2 and 3, i.e. upon the addition of lithium iodide.

4 Conclusions
This study has employed ex situ X-ray and in situ neutron reflectometry in order to determine structural characteristics of the MK-2 and MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 interfaces that relate to their function as DSC working electrodes. These characteristics comprise the average orientation of the dye with respect to the TiO2 surface, the dye coverage of this surface, and average intermolecular spacing between dye molecules once self assembled as a dye⋯TiO2 interface. Both dyes self assemble onto the TiO2 surface as monolayers, with dye coverage ranging from 75 to 90%. The dyes anchor onto the TiO2 with tilt angles that subtend between 56.6 and 65.1°, depending on the sample environment. The hexa-alkyl chains that flank the sides of the MK-2 dye appear to be inter-digitated, thereby forming a close-knitted dye layer that passivates well the TiO2 surface from unwanted electron recombination effects. In contrast, the inter-dye spacing of MK-44 is sufficiently large that π⋯π interactions are ruled out.
These interfacial structures have been characterised within two sample environments: as exposed DSC working electrodes, and as working electrodes submerged under electrolyte solution that emulates the material conditions of the DSC functional device. The enabling of in situ neutron reflectometry to study these buried interfaces is particularly noteworthy since it represents the first time any materials characterisation method has probed the dye⋯TiO2 interface within an electrolyte solution.
As such, the study reveals some significant new findings in terms of the function of lithium ions that form part of the electrolyte constituents. Specifically, these Li+ ions are shown to complex with the MK-44 dye, to the extent that the MK-44 dye⋯TiO2 anchoring mode changes from the CN/COO to bidentate bridging configuration upon addition of the electrolyte solution. This structural rearrangement of dyes exposes the TiO2 surface to solvent and electrolyte attack which stands to deplete the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding DSC due to electron recombination effects.
Encouragingly, the results also show that the high-performance DSC dye, MK-2, does not undergo such a dye⋯TiO2 binding reconfiguration upon addition of the electrolyte constituents. Rather, the MK-2 dye is able to bestow the bidentate bridging mode from the process of dye sensitisation through to its functional device environment. The hexa-alkyl groups which extrude from the MK-2 dye, and are absent in MK-44, are presumably somewhat responsible for this stability in binding configuration. It is worth highlighting the specific role of the cyanoacrylate group in the salient results of this case study, and that this moiety has become probably the most popular anchoring group used for DSC dyes.24 To this end, the structural trends observed in this study may well be found in many other classes of dyes and they therefore stand to have broader relevance to the DSC field.

 	Fig. 1  Molecular structures and preferred TiO2 binding modes of; (a) MK-2; and (b) MK-44.37,38 Annotated lateral molecular lengths and widths are taken from their crystal structures which were derived from X-ray diffraction data.39 Since neutrons are able to detect hydrogen atoms much better than X-rays, additional values (in parentheses) for these lateral dimensions are presented which incorporates the explicit position and bond lengths of hydrogen atoms, whose presence may be discounted during XRR studies. It is notable here, that the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid hydroxyl group on MK-44 is not considered during these measurements, as when bound to the TiO2 surface, this hydrogen is only present via a hydrogen bond to the exposed TiO2 surface hydroxide groups. For reference, an average carbon-hydrogen bond length is considered to be 1.08 Å.40

 	Fig. 3  Visualisation of (a) MK-2; and (b) MK-44 bound to a TiO2 surface (note that potential hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl group and exposed hydrogens of the TiO2 surface are emitted for clarity).34 Models were created using ChemBio3D (PerkinElmer). The dye⋯TiO2 separation was fixed at 2.05 Å and the molecular tilt adjusted to achieve a layer thickness representative of that observed by XRR. The tilt angle (α) of the dye bound to the TiO2 surface is calculated from dmax and dobs values using basic trigonometric considerations (as shown in previous work and ESI, §2.3†);25 the theoretical area-per-molecule (APM) of the dye, as projected onto the TiO2 surface, is calculated by multiplying the molecular width of the dye with its length (L) as projected on the TiO2 surface, L = dmaxcos(α). This calculation assumes a planar dye molecule which is reasonable in the case of the MK-2 and MK-44 dyes, given their crystal structures show exceptional levels of molecular planarity.39

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic illustration of the dye sensitised TiO2 sample within the solid–liquid environment. The three different solutions (1–3) are represented by sections a-c respectively, where (a) is neat d3-MeCN; (b) is lithium (yellow) iodide (pink) in d3-MeCN; and (c) is the iodide:tri-iodide (pink, tri-atomic structure) in d3-MeCN formed upon addition of I2 to the previously stated LiI solution. These sections are displayed solely for the purposes of illustration; each solid–liquid interface was prepared and tested using individual solutions. The solution is bounded by FTO glass coated with a platinum catalyst. (b) SLDn as a function of increasing depth of the emulated DSC device architecture, revealing the neutron scattering contrast variation that permits the exclusive determination of dye⋯TiO2 interfacial structure within its buried interface environment.	 

 	Fig. 5  Reflectivity profiles for (a) MK-2 and (b) MK-44 dyes sensitised on an amorphous TiO2 thin-film and submerged within solution 1 (d3-MeCN, red), 2 (d3-MeCN + LiI, orange), or 3 (d3-MeCN + LiI + I2, green). The thin overlaid lines represent the co-refined models fitted to their corresponding datasets. Corresponding SLDn profiles are presented as Figure insets.
