, Accepted 8th April 2014First published on 13th May 2014AbstractThe present situation reveals the dependence on fossil fuels, which is seriously accountable for two major impediments: (i) global warming due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and (ii) the alarming consumption of energy assets. The reduction of green CO2 in terms of producing solar fuels would be an expedient accomplishment to resolve both problems, simultaneously. The review classifies different categories of photocatalysts applied in foregoing photocatalytic CO2 conversion processes with detailed information concerning operating conditions, preparation techniques and physical properties of catalysts, radiation sources, and selectivity. The categories are concentrated on metal oxides, sulfides, phosphides, and p-type and nonmetal oxide semiconductors. In addition, their modification by doping co-metals, noble metals, transition metals and non-metals for visible light response is emphasized. Besides, for harnessing solar fuel, the recent prospect and advancement of novel sensitized catalysts by dye elements, phthalocyanines and quantum dots (QDs) are also highlighted in this review. This technology needs more efficient solar active catalysts to increase production rates as well as selectivity. The recent scenario indicates that massive prospects and opportunities still exist in this area for further investigation on catalyst selection.Sreejon DasSreejon Das is a postgraduate research student in the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Malaya, Malaysia.

1. Introduction
World energy consumption has deep implications for humanity's social-economic-political sphere. For this reason, the global energy map is changing with potentially extensive consequences for energy markets and trade, and also by a growing world population.1–3 On the other hand, the world is gradually becoming aware that essential alterations will be required to meet the growing demand for energy. Maximum energy sources are inadequate to satisfy the growing global energy demand, which will double by 2050 and triple at the end of this century.4 According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,5 energy consumption rates remained vigorous in several developing countries, specifically in Asia (>4%). In North America, Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, consumption fell by 4.5%, 5% and 8.5%, respectively, because of economic breakdown.
Energy produced from fossil fuels has great importance because the latter can be burned (oxidized to carbon dioxide and water), producing significant amounts of energy per unit weight.6 Non-renewable fossil fuels yield takes millions of years, and these assets are being exhausted much faster than new ones are being made. Fossil fuel consumption is also threatening to the environment. During the period from 1961 to 2010, the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy 20137 estimated that the rate of energy consumption has shown an upward trend. Worldwide movement towards renewable energy production is therefore in progress to meet increased energy requirements. The main renewable sources such as sunlight, wind, tides, waves, geothermal heat, biomass and nuclear energy offer electricity with zero carbon dioxide emissions.8 Energy conversion from waste is one of the supportable sources to convert the unwanted biomass into 7 to 10 TW of energy.9–11 Other renewable sources like wind, hydroelectric and tide/ocean currents provide almost 2.1 TW, 1.5 TW and <2 TW of energy respectively.12 Conversely, these renewable sources are quite limited to meet the overall energy demand.
To fulfil the energy demand, nuclear energy, which generally is the part of the energy of an atomic nucleus released by fusion or fission or radioactive decay could be a promising renewable source. Currently, approximately 14% of the world's electric energy is provided by the nuclear energy.13 On the other hand, the protection of nuclear reactors is a forthcoming limitation of nuclear chain-reaction control, and safe storage of the extremely radioactive nuclear waste is still an unidentified pathway towards a low fossil-fuel consumption future.14 Natural disasters like earthquakes may have harmful impacts on the earth from the nuclear plants. Moreover, nuclear power is not able to produce liquid fuel for transportation purposes. Unlike nuclear energy, another sustainable and abundant source of energy is required without the introduction of harmful environmental effects.
Renewable solar energy is used to harness the sun's energy and convert it into usable products through solar heating,15,16 solar photovoltaics,17,18 solar thermal electricity,19 solar architecture,20,21 and artificial photosynthesis.22 The satisfaction of global energy needs for an entire year is achievable by harnessing solar energy on the Earth's surface. Solar fuel is formed by utilizing light to produce chemical energy23,24 by artificial photosynthesis, or thermochemical reaction. The development of inexpensive, limitless and clean solar energy technologies must have massive and long-term benefits. This progress will intensify global energy reserves through dependence on an original, infinite and mostly import-independent resource, increase sustainability, decrease pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil-fuel prices lower than through other means.
Besides energy needs, sufficient physical evidence suggests that climate change is mainly responsible for carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel burning.25–27 As stated by the International Energy Agency (2012),28 the goal of decreasing climate warming by 2 °C is becoming more difficult and costly each passing year. All tolerable carbon dioxide emissions would be locked-in by the remaining energy infrastructure if appropriate steps are not taken before 2017. Already, global carbon dioxide growth in the atmosphere was amplified by around 1.5 ppm (8 billion tons) per year from 1975 to 2002. Basically, the atmospheric carbon dioxide level inflated much more quickly by 2.25 ppm (12 billion tons) per year. Every year, more than 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide is added to our atmosphere.29 As estimated by the U.S. Department of Energy,30 natural processes can only absorb about half that amount.
Abundant CO2 can be an asset by using appropriate applications in solar-fuel transformation. The recycling process of CO2 can regulate global warming as well as fuel demand.31 Besides photocatalytic conversion of CO2, other conversion processes can turn CO2 into fuels illustrated in Fig. 1, but the disadvantages in those processes are the high temperature and high electrical voltage requirements to break down the CO2 molecules, limitations of raw materials, high-cost operation, and unsustainability. Photocatalytic transformation of CO2 into solar fuel is more sustainable and favorable than other technologies because of zero addition of additional energy consumption and environmental deterioration. In the beginning, photocatalytic CO2 conversion was conducted by an artificial lamp. Recently, interest has grown in the harnessing of solar power by advanced photocatalytic processes. The stability of catalysts and mild operating conditions are among the most significant reasons for choosing this technology.32,33 However, more intensive study and improvement are required to select active solar-driven novel catalysts and effective architecture of solar photoreactors for industrial applications. Moreover, there are some unanswered questions in this technology with the selectivity of the photocatalytic reactions and limited efficiency.

This paper concentrated on advancements in the photochemical transformation of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels. The second chapter of this paper provides a snapshot of current developments in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 on various types of semiconductors. Pure metal oxide semiconductors are cheap and the most commonly used photocatalysts in this technology like TiO2. To a large extent, this can be ascribed to its band structure, which is acceptable, but certainly not optimal for the reduction of CO2 driven by solar energy. The wide band gap (3.2 eV) limits the absorption of light into the UV range. The modification of metal oxide semiconductors by supporting materials helps to control the catalysts' size from crystal growth and facilitate the response towards visible light. The two most common methods for extending the absorption range to visible light are sensitization and doping. Doping metal on semiconductors acts as an electron trap to provide the electrons to the CO2. Besides, non-oxide semiconductors initially received a lot of attention. For example, the valence band of sulphide semiconductors is made of 3p orbitals of the sulfur atoms and is shifted upwards, compared with those of the oxide analogues, while the conduction band electrons are also more reductive.35 Interest has grown in the involvement of flexible substrates because they deliver a high surface area for catalysts on the films of substrates. In the mainstream, the review categorizes the different types of photocatalysts used in previous photocatalytic conversions of CO2 processes (with detailed information regarding the operating conditions, preparation techniques and physical properties of catalysts, radiation sources and selectivity) based on metal oxides, sulfides, phosphides, and p-type and non-metal-oxide semiconductors. In addition, these processes highlighted their modifications by doping co-metals, noble metals, transition metals and non-metals for visible light responses. Besides, the recent prospect and advancement of novel sensitized catalysts by dye elements, phthalocyanines and quantum dots (QDs) for harnessing solar fuels are prominent in this review.
2. Photocatalytic CO2 transformation based on catalysts
The transformation of CO2 into fuel by using solar light irradiation is an effective method because there is no addition of extra energy and no negative influence on the environment. The immediate requirement in this technology is to develop visible light-sensitive photocatalysts, which are prominent in CO2 recycling. Different types of photocatalysts have been already introduced by many researchers in this technology. Some of the catalysts exhibited high conversion rates and selectivity under visible light irradiation, while other catalysts were not feasible for visible light response and presented low yield rates. Researchers are still trying hard to advance the properties of catalysts in terms of solar fuel production. The reaction mechanism of selective photocatalysts under light irradiation is illustrated in Scheme 1. A concise classification of photocatalysts is also shown in Fig. 2, based on the recent development in photocatalytic CO2 transformation.

2.1 Metal oxide photocatalysts
Metal oxides as light-sensitive catalysts have been applied in several processes such as the breaking down of organic and inorganic materials to valuable products,23,36,37 water treatment,38,39 and self-cleaning40,41 processes. The leading approach of using metal oxide catalysts in CO2 conversion to carbonaceous fuel was introduced by Inoue et al.42 Variations in metal oxide photocatalysts have already been introduced by integrating foreign elements and other compounds with different supportive substrates43–46 for lessening its particle size, controlling its crystal growth, and increasing its surface area and pore volume. Various metal oxide photocatalysts, which were frequently studied in many photocatalytic CO2 reduction processes, are characterized in this section with sufficient information.
2.1.1 Surface unmodified metal oxide photocatalysts. TiO2 is a frequently used metal oxide in the photocatalytic transformation of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuel because it is an inert, corrosion-resistant and inexpensive semiconductor. In nature, TiO2 is established as three familiar minerals such as rutile, anatase and brookite. Among them, rutile and anatase phases indicate better efficiency under light radiation. Mutually, anatase and rutile phases reveal definite band gap energy at around 3.2 eV and 3.0 eV, respectively. The rutile phase is capable of absorbing visible light because of its comparatively low band gap energy, while the anatase form only displays its response to ultra-violet (UV) irradiation. Thus, the rutile phase is not used due to its ineffective photoactivity; the best photoactivity can be achieved by combining anatase with a slight amount of rutile.47 A clear idea of metal oxide semiconductors used in various studies for photocatalytic CO2 transformation is represented in Table 1. The light absorption by titanium-dioxide semiconductor is effective, while the semiconductor exhibits high surface area. The surface area of TiO2 is indirectly proportional to the size of particle; conversely, the size of the particle is directly proportional to the band gap energy. The semiconductor shows high band gap energy as a result of the shifting of valence band energy to lower energies after a certain decrease in the particle size, whereas band energy is intensely shifted to higher energies.48 On the other hand, significantly narrow band gap energy leads to inadequate redox potential to achieve oxidizing and reducing reactions. Therefore, it is compulsory to fix a structure that exhibits a settlement between the particle size and band gap energy range.49 Tan et al. investigated a combination of 80% anatase and 20% rutile forms as a photoactive catalyst.50 In Scheme 1(a), the photocatalytic conversion mechanism of CO2 on unmodified metal oxide semiconductor is sketched.

Commercial Degussa P25 is found to be slightly less active than modified TiO2 (anatase and rutile).51 It is indicated that unmodified TiO2 (P25) metal oxide semiconductors generally have high surface area as well as an affinity to organic impurities on their surfaces to facilitate the adsorption of organic compounds, which have the potential to perform as both an electron donor and a carbon source for the products.52 Besides, this type of metal oxide catalyst expresses better methane production, compared with the Degussa P25 treated by calcination and washing where CO is the major product.52,53 In various studies, product dissimilarity is also observed due to the treatment procedure on anatase TiO2 in several methods.54–56 For instance, treatment by the acidic solutions (1 M nitric acid) is suitable for formic acid formation due to the protonation of reaction intermediates into the reaction medium.54 Treatment with 2-propanol acts as a hole scavenger in CO2 photoreduction with anatase TiO2, where the methane formation rate was considerably higher. In addition, it was observed that in absence of 2-propanol, no methane was found.56 Moreover, the synthesis of TiO2 by the sol–gel method removes the presence of small brookite nanoparticles that normally arise in low-temperature formation reactions and considerably hinder the phase alteration to rutile at elevated temperatures.48,57
Some prospective metal oxide photocatalysts other than TiO2 were reported in many investigations. Inoue et al. studied three metal oxides, TiO2, ZnO and WO3, to understand their photocatalytic characteristics under UV light radiation.42 It was found that the yield of methyl alcohol increased as the conduction band becomes more negative with respect to the redox potential of H2CO3/CH3OH, whereas methyl alcohol was not produced in presence of the WO3 catalyst, which has a conduction band more positive than the redox potential of H2CO3/CH3OH. However, WO3 possesses low band gap energy (2.8 eV) with respect to visible light irradiation. G. Xi et al. synthesized the W18O49 catalyst in the form of nanowires with band gap energy of 2.7 eV for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to methane under visible light irradiation.58 The diameter of W18O49 nanowires is approximately 0.9 nm and hold a large number of oxygen vacancies. These oxygen vacancies indicate an outstanding competency on photochemical carbon dioxide reduction over the visible light region.
Metal oxides like Ga2O3, ZrO2, and MgO were reported in various studies as having wide band gaps, compared with other photocatalytic metal oxides.59–61 In those studies, methane and hydrogen were used as reductants for photoreduction of CO2, and CO was the major product.61,62 In the case of ZrO2, high photoreduction of CO2 is obtained when H2 is used rather than CH4. Moreover, it is found that some intermediates are formed when H2 is used for CO2 photoreduction over ZrO2 and MgO as a surface formate species, whereas the acetate is generated in lieu of the formate when CH4 is used as reductant over ZrO2.60,61 It was also observed that the surface bidentate formate species showed high photoactivity for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over ZrO2 and MgO.
Recently, visible light-responsive and other oxide catalysts fabricated through various routes like hydrothermal, solvothermal, and solid state reactions are widely used in the photochemical reduction of CO2 because of high yield rates. Microwave-assisted, hydrothermally derived monoclinic BiVO4 catalysts show higher ethanol yields (110 μmol h−1 per g of catalyst) than that of tetragonal BiVO4 due to anchored CO32− to the Bi3+ sites on the external surface through a weak Bi–O bond for receiving the photogenerated electrons effectively from the V 3d-block bands of BiVO4. The asymmetric behavior of the monoclinic phase around the Bi3+ ion is more effective than in the tetragonal phase. That is why, the Bi3+ ion shows a stronger lone pair behavior in the monoclinic phase for increasing the tendency of the Bi–O bond formation with CO32−.63,64 Y. Zhou et al. and Q. Liu et al. reported visible light-responsive, 9.5 nm thick Bi2WO6 nanoplates and UV-driven single-crystalline Zn2GeO4 nanobelts with a thickness of 7 nm, respectively.65,66 The ultrathin geometry encourages the charge carriers to transfer swiftly from inside to the external surface for effective participation in the CO2 photoreduction reaction. It also separates the photogenerated electron and hole progressively, ultimately decreasing the recombination rate.
It has been reported that hydrothermally prepared KNb3O8 and HNb3O8 nanobelts show high yields of methane, compared with the same catalysts derived from conventional solid state reactions and commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25).67 In the case of hydrothermal synthesis, this nanobelt-like morphology and protonic acidity give higher photochemical activity for methane production through hydrogen bonding, which is facilitated by the separating and trapping of photogenerated carriers at the interlayer surfaces of HNb3O8 and KNb3O8. Ferroelectric materials can be used as remarkable substitutes for the standard semiconductor photocatalysts. Ferroelectric characteristics lead to driving the electrons and holes apart because they possess internal dipoles. Therefore, this phenomenon decreases the probabilities of the recombination of carriers and also inhibits the reaction of redox products, driving the equilibrium towards product formation. For this ferroelectric behavior, the polar compound LiNbO3 was used by Stock and Dunn for photocatalytic CO2 conversion to formic acid under an Hg lamp or direct natural sunlight irradiation.68

2.1.2 Supported metal oxide photocatalysts. Several types of supportive materials were used in this technology, such as zeolite, mesoporous SiO2, kaolinite, Al2O3, montmorillonite and other pillar materials. Table 2 demonstrates the textural belongings of the silica supports and the TiO2-loaded samples with specific surface area, pore volume, and maximum pore size distributions.46 The mesoporous, SiO2-prepared material MCM-41 shows higher specific surface area having an average pore size of 2.3 nm. The pore structure of supported materials is a vital factor because it manages the transportation of reactants and products to and from the surface, and controls the size of the active surface area.74 The detailed information of supported metal oxide semiconductors investigated in previous studies are highlighted critically in Table 3. Titania charging on the silica matrix reduces the surface area of the supports and also decreases the pore volume, as the titania content increases. The reduction of pore volume indicates that the loading of semiconductor particles saturates the maximum space of the ordered channels within the support, which helps to control the catalysts' size from crystal growth. High catalyst loading can cause pore blockage inside the channels, although the interconnection among the parallel pore channels should have the ability to reduce this effect.75 The common photocatalytic reaction path for supported metal oxide semiconductor is illustrated in Scheme 1(b).

A catalyst on supported materials has been used in many photocatalytic aqueous systems due to their immobilization in terms of easier separation of the catalyst after the photocatalytic reactions. It is reported that supported photocatalysts exhibit lower activities than powdered TiO2 materials. However, treated photocatalysts show their high activity because of cyanide content and represent the dicyanoaurate photoreduction activity in order to reflect TiO2/GrSiO2 > Degussa P25 > TiO2/SBA-15. Depending on the treatment processes, TiO2/SBA-15 materials achieved up to eight times of high activity, compared with the Degussa P25 TiO2.76 The addition of Cu species on TiO2–SiO2 catalysts increased the overall CO2 conversion efficiency by suppressing the electron–hole recombination and increasing multi-electron reactions,77 compared with only TiO2–SiO2 matrices.78 It is reported that the addition of 0.5% Cu shows high specific surface area, but the addition of 1% and 3% Cu successively reduces the specific surface area. A multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-supported TiO2 composite catalyst is introduced by Xia et al. due to its unique electronic properties,70 and the results show a high conversion rate when a proper amount of MWCNTs is used as a support for TiO2. Moreover, the MWCNT-supported composite catalysts are able to lessen the accumulation of the catalyst particles and reduce the recombination of electron–hole pairs by moving it along the tubes. Carbon is used as a catalyst support in gas–solid reaction phases with suitable temperature and pressure under which the carbon support remains stable. In hydrogenation reactions, carbon-supported iron catalysts with high dispersions were used at 1 atm and <700 K because of carbon stability under this condition.74 The stability of activated carbon can be controlled by ZnO catalysts. The high reaction rate of the gasification of the activated carbon is carried out with CO2 by ZnO loading in low temperatures.79 The presence of an acidic medium in mixed oxide systems is suitable to achieve additional knowledge on the physical nature of photocatalysts.80 The oxide-supported catalysts are treated by an acidic medium due to the presence of an oxygen species in the reaction system that leads to a formation of basic nature of the catalyst, which was reported by M. Subrahmanyam et al.81 Zeolites are microporous, aluminosilicateminerals having porous structures as traps for molecules to analyze. Investigation shows that the TiO2 particles are highly distributed inside the pore channels of zeolite with tetrahedral coordination, which has high selectivity for the formation of CH3OH.82 At the same time, it was also found that Pt loading on TiO2 catalysts in the presence of zeolite support encourages the charge separation and increases the formation of CH4 in lieu of CH3OH by stimulating the reaction between the carbon radicals and H atoms formed on the Pt metals to produce CH4.
Recently, montmorillonite has been loaded with TiO2 structures to increase the surface area of TiO2 particles.45 Ultimately, in this research, the particle size of the catalyst was reduced from 18.73 to 13.87 nm and allowed efficient charge separation. The band gap of TiO2 was also reduced to 3.07 eV and could permit visible light irradiation during photoreduction of CO2 in the presence of water vapor. Effective charge transfer between the two semiconductors and the response to visible light are found in the FeTiO3–TiO2 catalyst due to its unique band structure (2.7 eV).83 When the loading of FeTiO3 increases on TiO2 from 10% to 50%, it shows a decrease in surface area accordingly from 55.8 to 35.7 m2 g−1. Due to the small surface area, a high content of FeTiO3 on TiO2 provides a low production rate. Kaolinite, which is a clay mineral with a layered silicate having one tetrahedral sheet connected through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina octahedral,84 is another promising supporting material in this technology. A kaolinite/TiO2 composite decreases the crystallite size of anatase TiO2. Kaolinite increases the effective surface area for TiO2 by avoiding TiO2 aggregates in suspension and prevents the recombination of electron–hole pairs. It also hinders crystallite growth and decreases particle sizes from 26 nm to 18 nm.85 23.2% AgBr is highly dispersed on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles, which exhibit strong absorption ability in the visible-light region and stability during repeated operations because of transferring photoexcited electrons from conduction bands of well-dispersed AgBr to that of TiO2.86 RuO2 is a favorable material which shows high electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability, intermediate hydrogen over-potential and the capacity to reversibly adsorb hydrogen for CO2 reduction.87 RuO2 supported on TiO2 nanotube-composite-modified Pt electrodes showed higher activity on electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol, compared with RuO2-modified Pt electrodes, according to the investigation of J. Qu et al.88 It is also found that RuO2–TiO2 nanotube-modified electrodes are more promising electrocatalysts than that of RuO2–TiO2 nanoparticle-modified electrodes due to the high dispersion of RuO2 on the TiO2 nanotubes surface with more surface area, creating more active sites. Photoreduction rates can be improved by the deposition of Pd metal on the surface of RuO2–TiO2, where photoelectrons are trapped by Pd, and photoholes are confined at the RuO2/SO32− site.89 WO3 and CeO2 were also applied on TiO2 support to investigate photocatalytic activity,73,90 where CeO2–TiO2 shows the visible light responsiveness. The loading of Rh on TiO2 containing 2% WO3 leads to the formation of more formic acid, compared with WO3–TiO2.73
Some other investigations were published based on the CuO, which is highly dispersed on TiO2.91,92 By using XRD analysis, it is found that the dispersion capability of CuO in the vacant sites of TiO2 was approximately 4.16 Cu2+ nm−2. The high percentage of CuO loading on TiO2 slightly reduces the surface area of catalyst particles, and this slight change in surface area is negligible to the reactivity of the catalyst.91 On the other hand, 1 wt% CuO–TiO2 exhibits high band gap energy (3.02 eV) with lower production yields than that of 3 wt% CuO–TiO2 (2.88 eV).91 Calcination temperature is also important in terms of production rates. 1 wt% CuO–TiO2 calcined at 450 °C represents greater activity than that of calcined at 350 °C and 550 °C.92
In addition, supported materials other than TiO2 are found at reasonable photocatalytic activity. The use of NiO on several metal oxides such as InTaO4 and InNbO4 are found in some publications for CO2 reduction to fuel.93–95 1 wt% NiO–InTaO4 catalysts have low band gap energy of 2.6 eV, which is highly responsive to visible light and can be used in different types of reactors like slurry, optical fiber and monolithreactors.93,96,97 In case of NiO–InNbO4 catalyst, it shows also better activity due to the presence of core–shell-type Ni0 and NiO on the surface and the presence of a small amount of Nb2O5 as a promoter under visible light irradiation.95
Zn2GeO4 is an important metal oxide catalyst in photoconversion technology, which is frequently used as a support for other oxide catalysts to enhance photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Zn2GeO4 catalyst contains some superior properties like low crystal defects, extraordinary specific surface area and favorable microstructure on the surface of the catalyst, but the band gap energy is high enough (4.65 eV) to show the visible light response.98 Sheaf-like, hyperbranched Zn2GeO4 nanoarchitecture was developed by Q. Liu et al., which was further modified by NH3 flow to a yellow Zn1.7GeN1.8O solid solution for CO2 conversion into carbonaceous fuel in the existence of water at ambient conditions under visible light irradiation.99 The modified catalyst shows low band gap energy (2.6 eV), which is used as a support for 1 wt% Pt and 1 wt% RuO2. Moreover, the loading of Pt and RuO2 on Zn1.7GeN1.8O gives a high conversion rate, which is able to arrest the electron–hole pairs by preventing the recombination of electrons and holes.

2.2 Modified/unmodified non-oxide catalysts
Non-oxide semiconductor photocatalysts are selected for CO2 recycling because of their low band gap energy to facilitate the photocatalytic response to the visible light region, and high conversion efficiency is achieved for their unique photobehavior. Elaborately major findings and characteristics of non-oxide semiconductors upon photocatalytic reactions are described in Table 4.

2.2.1 Metal sulphide semiconductors. It is investigated that semiconductor catalysts are one of the supreme sources for direct solar energy conversion. Many wide-ranging reviews already have been published on the advancement of oxide or non-oxide semiconductor photoactive materials.100–103 It was found that apart from the metal oxide semiconductor catalysts, metal sulphide semiconductor materials have effective photoactivity because of their outstanding ability to absorb the solar spectrum with high energy yields.104 Metal sulphides have comparatively high conduction band states more appropriate for enhanced solar responses than for metal oxide semiconductors, which are facilitated by the higher valence band states consisting of S 3p orbitals.104 It was reported that to absorb the entire UV and visible light region of solar irradiation, a ZnS–AgInS2–CuInS2 solid solution was capable due to an absorption edge of up to 800 nm.105 Fujiwara et al. investigated ZnS–DMF(OAc) for the CO2 photoreduction process.106 They found that the close interaction of acetate ions to Zn atoms inhibited the creation of sulfur vacancies as catalytic sites for CO production. Moreover, surface dimethylformamide (DMF) solvated Zn atoms give more efficiency to HCOO− formation. On the other hand, the addition of excess Zn2+ increases the size of ZnS–DMF(OAc) through the reaction between excess Zn2+ and the surface of ZnS–DMF(OAc) nanocrystallites. ZnS deposited on montmorillonite (MMT) was also fabricated by Kočí et al. with particle sizes of 3 nm to 5 nm, which provided significantly higher productivity, compared with the commercial TiO2 Degussa P25.107,108 They used cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA) with ZnS nanoparticles to inhibit the formation of bigger agglomerates. Different percentages of ZnS loading on porous SiO2 matrices were also applied to investigate the improved photocatalytic yields.109In 1979, Inoue et al. introduced non-oxide semiconductor catalysts (CdS, GaP and SiC) for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to fuel.42 Among them, CdS shows comparatively better yields in CO2 conversion. It is found from Table 4 that the narrow band gap (2.63 eV) CdS supported on montmorillonite exhibits a lower conversion yield than that of 3.89 eV ZnS deposited on MMT, but the CdS–MMT system has high stability in presence of CTA.108,110,111 Not only that, here CTA acts as a binder among CdS and MMT particles. Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 on CdS semiconductors with modified surfaces by various types of thiol compounds was performed in presence of 2-propanol solvent.112 In this study, the major products found were formate and carbon monoxide. The ratio of formate to carbon monoxide is highly dependent on the solvent and increases with increasing the dielectric constant of the solvent. Moreover, the surface modifier is used in this system to fix the surface Cd2+ sites, thus decreases the adsorption of CO2˙− on Cd2+ sites, which means that the formate yield will be increase with increasing the surface exposure of the modifier. Another study shows that extra Cd2+ addition to the CdS–DMF system forms sulfur vacancies on the surface of nanocrystallites because of the adsorption of excess Cd2+ on the surface.113 Over the surface of sulfur vacancies, CO2 takes electrons sequentially after developing a Cd2+OCOCO2 complex to react with another CO2, leading to the formation of CO as reported in the electrical CO2 reduction to CO.114
Yuan et al. investigated CdS–TNT loaded with Pt to carry out the photochemical reaction under visible light irradiation, but they found that the worsening effect of photochemical reaction occurs due to the adsorption of intermediate products (CO, O2 etc.) on Pt and the oxidation of Pt.115 Another approach was led by Li et al. for visible light-responsive photocatalytic CO2 reduction on modified CdS with 15% Bi2S3.116 The investigation shows that the Bi2S3 catalyst itself has higher photochemical activity and visible light response than that of CdS. The addition of Bi2S3 increased the photochemical performance of CdS, and a maximum yield was obtained 120 μmol h−1 g−1 catalyst. Cd–ZnS was investigated to compare the photocatalytic behavior with solid solutions of ZnS–CdS microcrystals.117 Cd–ZnS shows the highest activity than that of ZnS–CdS because Cd is more active in improving the quantum efficiency of the photochemical reduction of formate due to its ability to activate CO2 more effectively in the photoreaction. Zhang et al. introduced another metal sulphide semiconductor catalyst (MnS), which can be used under the solar spectrum more competently due to low band gap energy (3.0 eV).118 Similar to CdS, MnS semiconductor materials also have the distinct behavior of containing high-reducing conduction band electrons which are satisfactorily active for encouraging the reduction of CO2.118 That is why, MnS semiconductors deliver higher quantum efficiency than other common catalysts such as TiO2.

2.2.2 Metal phosphide semiconductor. The use of catalysts for photochemical purposes without incorporating co-catalysts such as p-type GaP and p-type InP have also been studied due to narrow band gaps to facilitate the visible light response.119,120 Basically, in the photoelectrochemical CO2 conversion process, p-type metal phosphides (GaP) were used mainly in methanol production but needed remarkably high over-potentials.121 However, high faradaic efficiencies for the photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO have also been investigated, while electrolytes are used in nonaqueous forms. Nevertheless, high over-potential is necessary to obtain high faradaic efficiency.122 Barton et al. found that p-type GaP was able to obtain faradaic efficiency of 100% while converting CO2 to methanol at low potentials, which was more than 300 mV below the standard potential of −0.5 V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE).121 Habisreutinger et al. reported that p-type GaP semiconductor exhibits low band gap energy (2.24 eV) and possesses high reducing conduction band electrons to ease the reduction of CO2.35 On the other hand, for CO2 photocatalytic conversions, it was detected that p-type InP provided high selectivity for formic acid in a photoelectrochemical cell.123 Moreover, according to Kaneco et al., p-InP is an active substantial for the photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2, which revealed higher positive potential of 0.2–0.4 V than that of p-Si and p-GaAs photocathodes in the electrolysis of methanol electrolyte.120
2.2.3 Other non-oxide semiconductors. Aurian-Blajeni et al. were carried out in the aqueous CO2 photoelectrochemical reduction by using p-GaP and p-GaAs as photocathodes.124 In case of p-GaP, the Faradaic yield decreases when the reaction is carried out at a more negative potential, whereas the opposite behavior is shown in the case of p-GaAs electrode. The different behavior of the two electrodes is probably connected to the greater stability of GaP towards anodic decomposition, while in the case of the unstable GaAs, the higher number of negative potentials provide a degree of cathodic protection. Modified p-type silicon (p-Si) electrodes with Cu, Ag, and Au foreign elements have been investigated by Hinogami et al., and were determined to have extraordinary activation energy for CO2 photoreduction.125 Metal element deposition on p-Si electrodes not only induce the photocatalytic activity but also produce high photovoltages. Moreover, CO2 photochemical reduction is activated by an upward shift of surface band energies of p-Si in terms of achieving energy levels, which is identical between the semiconductor and solution reactants.125 In another study, p-type SiC modified by Cu particles was also investigated to determine the photoelectrochemical ability in CO2 reduction.126Ti containing mesoporous silica thin-film materials have been introduced in the photochemical reduction of CO2 due to their unique and high photocatalytic performances.127 Spectroscopic analysis proved that Ti ions were highly dispersed in silica networks, and the silica thin films acted as effective photocatalysts during the photoreactions. Besides, the hexagonal pore construction inside the films revealed superior photosensitivity compared with the same pore-structured Ti-MCM-41 powdered catalyst.127,128 Moreover, FTIR investigation found that Ti containing silica thin film-possessed surface OH groups in various concentrations had a significant influence on CH3OH formation.128 Ikeue et al. also studied Ti containing β-zeolite treated with OH− and F− ions as structure-directing agents (SDA) showed hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties, respectively.129 Hydrophilic properties show high photocatalytic efficiency due to the easy interaction of H2O molecules with the tetrahedrally coordinated titanium oxide species on Ti–β-zeolite (OH) than on Ti–β-zeolite (F).

2.3 Doped photocatalysts
To introduce impurities into an extremely pure semiconductor, doping of foreign elements is deliberately inserted for the purpose of controlling its electrical properties. Due to large band gaps, unmodified semiconductor photocatalysts cannot effectively absorb solar radiation with photon energy 1.7–3.1 eV.131 To decrease its band gap energy, surface modification of the photocatalysts has been attempted by applying stress along the soft direction of a layered semiconductor,131 introducing oxygen vacancies in semiconductors,132 or incorporating foreign elements.133–139 The schematic photocatalytic view of a doped semiconductor is illuminated in Scheme 1(c). Not only that, the recent advancement in different types of doped metal and non-metal elements incorporated with semiconductors found in various research for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 has been reported in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.

2.3.1 Noble metal doped semiconductors. Doping metal on semiconductor acts as an electron trap to provide electrons to CO2. The photoexcited electrons are shifted from the conduction band of the semiconductor to doped metal to leave the holes on the surface of semiconductor.37 Noble metals, including Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Pt, Cu, Ni and Au, have been commonly used with semiconductors as dopants due to Fermi-level or electron-accepting areas at an energy just beneath the conduction band of semiconductors for the photochemical reduction of CO2. Among those metals, Pt was widely used in many investigations. For example, the TiO2 semiconductor was doped with 0.5 wt% Pt by wet impregnation to avoid very low photocatalytic activity.140,141 More homogeneous dispersion of 0.5 wt% Pt on the TiO2 surface drives the reaction rate swiftly in the both liquid and gas phases.142 It is found that Pt loaded on TiO2 transforms active sites from Ti4+ to Ti3+ by shifting electrons from TiO2 to Pt, and this phenomena facilitates visible light response.143 Another investigation shows that Pt doping on anchored titanium oxide catalysts within the Y-zeolite cavities encourages charge separation and increases the formation of CH4 in lieu of CH3OH by promoting the reaction between the carbon radicals and H atoms formed on the Pt metals.82 Pt-loaded alkali niobates ANbO3 (A = Na, K) photocatalysts were reported by Li et al.144 Results showed that KNbO3 exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than NaNbO3 because of having low band gap energy (Eg) and high mobile charge carriers. Here, Pt acts as a co-catalyst to provide the reactive site for hydrogen gas production easily in terms of low H2 over-potential on the Pt surface.145 It is also noticeable that increasing Pt proportion from 0.5 wt% to 1.0 wt% promotes the formation of hydrogen gas. The photocatalytic performance of micro- or mesoporous Zn2GeO4 loading with various percentages of Pt (from 0.5 to 2.5 wt%) was investigated by N. Zhang et al., from which the results evaluated the highest activity for 1.0 wt% Pt.146Ishitani et al. reported that Pd doped on TiO2 performed more effective photocatalytic activity than that of other metals loaded on TiO2, and it also increased the formation of CH4 instead of CO from CO2.147 On the other hand, Pd on the surface of TiO2 partially oxidized to form PdO during the progression of CH4 formation, which led to the deactivation of the Pd–TiO2 catalysts.52 Solymosi and Tombacz assumed that adsorption and photocatalytic behaviors of Rh were significantly influenced by the existence of an electronic interaction at the Rh–TiO2 interface.73 Moreover, the catalytic activity of Rh was affected by doping with altervalent cations (W6+) due to the variation of the electron concentration of the TiO2.148 Cu is another noble metal, which is eminent for its availability and low cost. Not only that, Cu loading on TiO2 was a prevalent approach in photocatalytic conversion of CO2 because of its high yield through the lowering of re-electron–hole recombination probability. According to Tseng et al., an optimal Cu-loaded titania (2 wt% Cu) was found to have the highest photochemical activity, which provided lower fluorescence intensity and resulted in higher methanol formation.149,150 Depending on the amount of Cu loading on TiO2, the formation of the hydrocarbon products has been changed also.151 Ag-doped TiO2 was also investigated in this technology reduced the band gap energy of TiO2 and shifted the band edge from the UV region to the visible region, according to the amount of Ag added.152,153 Ag co-catalyst-loaded on ALa4Ti4O15 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) has been published, and Ag acts as a CO2 reduction site to generate CO as reported in electrochemical reduction of CO2, where Ag was used as an electrocatalyst.154 Moreover, the plasmon effect has been developed by Au nanoparticles doped with TiO2 through increasing the visible light response.155–157

2.3.2 Transition metal doped semiconductors. To improve the photocatalytic activity and efficiency, transition metals are also investigated in many studies due to the high visible light conversion of CO2.158 The interesting thing about transition metals is that their valence electrons to exhibit several common oxidation states. Among the transition metals, Co, Mn, Ni, Cr, Mo, Fe, V, and Ti are commonly used as doping elements in photocatalytic technology to enhance the semiconductor performances under visible light. For visible light responsibility, Nishimura et al. synthesized Cr-doped TiO2 film by the sol–gel and dip-coating methods.159 They stated that a suitable percentage of metal doping on semiconductors improved catalytic activity, whereas excess percentages of dopant metal beyond the optimal level decreased the photocatalytic performances because of charge recombination. However, the H2 generation rate was more advanced for Fe-doped TiO2 than Cr-doped TiO2 because of avoiding the recombination in trapping both electrons and holes by Fe particles, whereas Cr can only trap one type of charge carrier.160 The experiment was done to characterize the different types of transition metals (V, Fe, Ce, Cu, Cr) doped TiO2, prepared by Pan et al.161 They reported that V and Fe were placed in the substitutional sites of TiO2, and Ce ions were dispersed in the interstitial sites, although Cr and Cu accumulated on the surface. The activity order was found in such a manner: Fe–TiO2 > V–TiO2 > Cr–TiO2 > Ce–TiO2 > TiO2 > Cu–TiO2, which indicates that the local structure and type of dopant have vital contributions on photocatalytic technology.The loading of transitional metal species on the framework nanostructure is a common practice for increasing the high dispersion of those species. Moreover, for surface immobilization, titanium species are confined onto mesoporous silica. This phenomenon is also effective for photocatalytic reactions of titanium particles as their photocatalytic activities intensely rely on the structures of active sites.162 It was found that high and exceptional photocatalytic reactivity was obtained for the reduction of CO2 with H2O to generate CH4 and CH3OH under UV irradiation, compared with the bulk TiO2.163

2.3.3 Co-metal doped semiconductors. The doping of bimetallic elements together on semiconductor photocatalysts has been validated as a potential method to advance the visible light response of photocatalysts. Suitable co-dopant combinations are necessary to enhance the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors because all of the co-dopant configurations are not appropriate for this technique.164 Fe as a co-dopant in the Cu–TiO2 catalyst has been investigated for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to ethylene at a quantum yield of 0.024%.165 An efficient charge transfer mechanism occurred in this combination between TiO2 and Cu as well as Fe as co-dopants. However, Cu co-doped with Fe–TiO2 on SiO2 support has also been examined under concentrated natural sunlight with high quantum yield (0.05%) and full absorption of visible light and compared to only Cu co-doped on the Fe–TiO2 counterpart.166 The photocatalytic performance of the Cu doped on Pt–TiO2 catalysts is influenced by the content of Cu loading. The high percentage of Cu loading expressively decreases the formation of H2 and improves the formation of CH4 and CO.167 Varghese et al. reported that Pt may have an effect on H2O activation, whereas Cu plays an important role in activating CO2 to CO.168 Bimetallic Ag–Pt were used with the TiO2 semiconductor catalyst as reported by Mankidy et al. who obtained a selectivity of CH4 of almost 80%, compared with TiO2 of 20% selectivity.169 Their investigation found that Ag species had a strong surface plasmon absorption band in the UV-vis region, while the Pt species did not show that behavior. However, the combination of bimetallic Ag–Pt has the ability to tune the electronic properties during photochemical reactions. Not only that, combined Ag–Pt can accumulate the electrons by Ag and transfer the interfacial electron charge from Pt.
2.3.4 Non-metal doped semiconductors. It has been broadly confirmed that doping or co-doping of semiconductor photocatalysts with non-metals such as C, N, S, B and F has shown considerably low band gap energy, compared with metal doping in different experiments, prominent to efficient photocatalytic activity during visible light irradiation.173–180 In Table 6, the update of major findings and detailed information regarding non-metal-doped semiconductors is given elaborately to evaluate their progress in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2. Compared with other non-metals, nitrogen-doped semiconductors show the most active results due to the narrow band gap.181 A high rate of solar conversion of carbon dioxide in the presence of water vapor to methane and other hydrocarbons is attained from nitrogen-deposited titania nanotube arrangements, as reported by Varghese et al.168 Particularly, low wall thickness of nanotube arrays promotes the transfer of efficient carriers to the adsorbing species. From the experiment, it was also found that the incorporation of Pt and Cu nanoparticles on the external surfaces of nanotube arrangements further increases the hydrocarbon yield under the outdoor global AM 1.5 sunlight with 100 mW cm−2 intensity. Both Suzuki et al. and Sato et al. studied p-type, photoactive, nitrogen-doped Ta2O5 linkage with metal-complex electrocatalysts, which revealed outstanding photochemical conversion of CO2 to formic acid under visible light irradiation by increasing the photoexcited electron transfer from the conduction band of the semiconductor to the metal complex.182,183 The co-catalytic (N-doped InTaO4 modified with Ni–NiO core–shell nanostructure) approach by Tsai et al. not only intensely increases solar light absorbance but also competently reduces the electron–hole recombination.184 The investigation with carbon-doped TiO2 was done by Xue et al. because doped carbon narrows the band gap, shifts the absorption to the visible light region and facilitates the charge separation efficiency.185 Hiroshi et al. reported that the hydrophilic behavior of C-doped TiO2 semiconductor exhibited visible light response, which was initiated from the localized C (2p) formed above the valence band.186 S-doped TiO2 has the ability to reduce the band gap energy and inhibits the alteration of anatase phase into rutile phase at elevated temperatures.187 Correspondingly, the doping of F on a semiconductor catalyst performs better by decreasing the band gap energy.188Results showed that iodine doping on semiconductor catalysts exhibited higher photochemical activity due to the closer ionic radii of I5+ and Ti4+ for substituting lattice titanium than other non-metal-doped elements like nitrogen, carbon, boron, and sulfur.189 Moreover, the replacement of Ti4+ with I5+ begins charge inequality to the formation of Ti3+ surface states that is able to arrest the photoinduced electrons and prevent charge recombination in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2.190 Zhang et al. found that iodine-doped TiO2 semiconductors calcined at 375 °C reduced particle sizes significantly and increased photochemical activity.190 It was also observed that 10% iodine deposition on TiO2 harvested maximum yield under visible light irradiation compared with the 5% iodine doping on TiO2.

2.4 Sensitized photocatalysts
For photocatalytic CO2 conversion, photosensitization of the catalyst is a promising technique which makes the catalyst more sensitive during light irradiation. This practice is generally conducted in photochemical applications under the light sources that have particular wavelength deficiencies for photoexcitation. The mechanism generates photoexcited electrons in the conduction band of photosensitizers under the light source of particular wavelengths, and the electrons are directly shifted to the conduction band of catalysts to make them photoactive under visible light irradiation.191 According to Tahir and Amin, photosensitization exclusively depends on the suitable sensitizer band gap that could absorb visible light irradiations, and the sensitizer conductance band needed to be higher (more negative) than the catalyst's conductance band to transfer electrons towards the catalyst.181 Some informative characteristics are represented in Table 7 for different types of sensitized photocatalysts, which are applied in many studies for increasing photocatalytic activity in order to obtain high photon efficiency and selectivity.

2.4.1 Dye sensitized photocatalysts. Dye sensitized photocatalysts are widely used in photochemical technology because of their ability to create photoactive electrons easily by visible light hitting the dye compound. This phenomenon helps to transfer those photoactive electrons from the dye to the catalysts' conduction band for activation during the visible light irradiation.37 An effective response to visible light and efficient electron transfer can enhance fuel yields. The charge separation can be effectively achieved by adding a co-catalyst to trap the electrons, which is depicted in Scheme 1(d).Li et al. reported that charging of Pt and RuO2 on dye sensitized hexagonal nanoplates to form micro-octahedron Zn2SnO4 enabled the accumulation of photoexcited electrons and holes, respectively.192 Dye sensitized, Pt loaded, nanosized {010} dominant anatase TiO2 rods were used to obtain exceptional surface atomic structure for optimum adsorption of dye molecules and encourage electron transmission from excited dye molecules to anatase TiO2.193 These occurrences also upgraded the current density and solar energy conversion efficiency of that system. Another investigation found that RuII(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)2-(NCS)2 (basically known as N3-dye) sensitized Cu–Fe loading on the P25 photocatalyst was able to absorb the wavelength of 400–800 nm from solar irradiation.194 Moreover, the results show that N3-dye is not suitable under artificial light (wavelength range is 320–500 nm) irradiation because before the irradiation, it is dispersed on the matrices of the photocatalysts; as a result, the dye does not show its full response to the light source but using concentrated natural sunlight N3-dye remarkably increases methane yield up to over 100%. Similar results were found by Wu and Chiou in that N3-dye gave effectual charge transfer with higher photoreduction under concentrated sunlight.195 Moreover, it was also found that N3-dye showed its stability for up to 6 h under both artificial light and concentrated sunlight. Ozcan et al. used perylene diimide dyes, which have revealed similar visible light response to the RuII(2,2′-bipyridyl)chloride hexahydrate.196 In this study, visible light performance of the dyes was in the following order in presence of Pt: Rubpy > BrAsp > BrGly.
Much attention has been given to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ cation because of its unique optical features. The combination of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and cobalt(II) chloride has been investigated over CO2 photoreduction, where Ru and Co complexes act as a photosensitizer and a catalyst, respectively.197 Absorbing photon energy, the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ cation transforms to the triplet state, denoted by [Ru(bpy)3]2+*. It was observed that the extra addition of bipyridine intensely reduced CO formation but raised the H2 yield. On the other hand, cobalt(II) chloride acts as an effective mediator for both CO and H2 productions and highly endorses CO yield. Co(bpy)32+ sensitized with Ru(bpy)32+ supported on a cation exchange Nafion film has been synthesized to carry out the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 for a period of more than 400 h under atmospheric pressure.198 High stability of the metal complexes is obtained by the suppression of the decomposition of the Ru complex fixed on the polymer surface. In this system, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ was immobile on a cation exchange polymer and [Co(bpy)3]2+ was mixed in a di-methylformamide (DMF) and tri-ethanol amine (TEOA) as a solvent and reducing agent, respectively. It is assumed that the photoinduced Ru complex transmits an electron to Co(II) complex, which acts as a reaction medium of CO2, and at that time, a tertiary amine (sacrifice reagent) reduced the oxidized Ru(III) complex.198

2.4.2 Quantum dots (QDs)-sensitized photocatalysts. A quantum dot-sensitized photocatalyst is one of the advanced approaches in photochemical conversion of CO2 because of its intrinsic optical and electrical behavior. These characteristics are strongly influenced by the size of quantum dots materials. Generally, chalcogenide metals (including CdSe or ZnS) are used with the semiconductors to facilitate the photon transformation of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels. In Section 2.2.1, there is a brief discussion about the metal sulfide (CdS and ZnS) semiconductors, which also have such unique optical properties as quantum dots materials. To understand the size reliance on the photochemical reduction of CO2, Wang et al. developed a PbS QDs-sensitized Cu–TiO2 catalyst of three different sizes of PbS QDs samples (3 nm, 4 nm and 5 nm).199 Among them, 4 nm PbS QD-sensitized Cu–TiO2 displayed the maximum CO2 transformation rate due to the absorption of visible spectrum (λ > 610 nm) and charge separation properties. It is found that small-sized dots can facilitate the blue edge of the spectrum, while the large-sized dot is closer to the red edge spectrum. Particularly, small-sized QDs inject electrons swiftly to the conduction band edge of TiO2 and large-sized QDs cover the visible region.200 Moreover, the electron transfer rate was very fast (less than 1 ns) from the excited PbS QDs state to the TiO2 conduction band state.201 Another investigation was conducted on the CdSe QDs-sensitized Pt–TiO2 composite heterostructure, which revealed a response to the visible light region (λ > 420 nm).200
2.4.3 Phthalocyanine sensitized photocatalysts. For visible light irradiation, metal phthalocyanines are also applied in CO2 photoreduction, which have outstanding semi-conductivity and chemical stability.202 The CoPc–TiO2 nanocomposites are characterized by Zhao et al.203,204 It was observed that excited CoPc molecules emitted the electrons to the conduction band of TiO2 during visible light irradiation; this phenomenon then improved the electron–hole separation process to increase the photocatalytic efficiency. From Table 7, it is found that the incorporation of 0.7% CoPc into TiO2 exhibited a high yield rate of formic acid (about 150 μmol g−1 h−1) than that of 0.5% CoPc addition to TiO2. In addition, their investigation was conducted on ZnPc–TiO2 and found that ZnPc has a higher selectivity of formic acid than metal catalysts by decreasing the recombination possibility of the hole–electron pairs.205 It is important that the excess loading of ZnPc can reduce the photocatalytic activity because the active TiO2 surface sites can be blocked by additional metal phthalocyanines, and the optimal amount is observed, 1.0 wt% ZnPc. However, according to the observation by Wang et al., the band gap of TiO2 can be minimized from 2.95 eV (at 0.6 wt% ZnPc) to 2.79 eV by loading 5 wt% ZnPc.206
2.4.4 Other photosensitizers. Enzymes have an effective sensitization facility to the red shift of TiO2, compared with other sensitizers.207 Woolerton et al. handled carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans (Ch)-derived carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHI) enzyme to functionalize the RuP-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles for CO2 photoexcitation.208,209 Anaerobic organisms, Ch contains five forms of CODH enzymes, each having active sites of [Ni4Fe-4S]. The subunit of these enzymes (Ni–CODHs) possesses a buried active site that is attached to the protein exterior by a chain of [4Fe-4S] clusters. Electrons can easily access or leave the enzyme by distal cluster (D-cluster) that is joined between the two subunits. In this experiment, visible light-excited RuP sensitizer nanoparticles transfer photoinduced electrons to TiO2 for easing its solar light activation.209,210 These electrons can easily get into the CODH enzyme through the D-cluster and also move through a second [4Fe–4S] cluster to the active site where the CO2 reduction has taken place.Recently, co-loaded novel metals are using the semiconductor catalysts as photosensitizers. For example, sensitized TiO2 film with Au nanoparticles is modified by Hou et al. for turning CO2 into fuels.211 Here, Au nanoparticles are photoexcited by the plasmon effect (the generation of robust electric fields by surface plasmon resonance of the Au nanoparticle), which shifts the photoinduced electrons from the Au to the TiO2. Another approach of sensitized TiO2 with Cu on supportive SiO2 is applied in terms of solar fuel production from CO2.77,212

2.5 Flexible substrate based photocatalysts
In photochemical reactions, the involvement of flexible substrates have generated interest because they deliver a high surface area for catalysts on the film of substrates such as polyethyleneterphthalate (PET), polyethylenenaphtalate (PEN), polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).218 However, the degradation of polymer substrates by solar irradiation depends on the operating period of atmospheric exposure.219 This photodegradation is carried out by a combination of photolysis and photocatalytic oxidation.218 The formation of volatile products due to photodegradation is another limitation in the case of polymeric substrates.220 Table 8 represents the full information of flexible substrate based photocatalysts, which are gathered from important investigations related to CO2 photoconversion.

Some aromatic polyesters such as PET, PEN and similar flexible substrates act in different ways under light irradiation, compared with olefins (PE and PP). Aromatic polyesters are able to absorb light with a long wavelength (<330 nm) due to the aromatic rings of carbonyl groups.220 Another important factor is the oxygen diffusion constant of flexible substrates. Higher oxygen diffusion constants may lead to oxidation in all parts of the surface.221 Comparatively, polymer degradation is lesser on the surface of the PET because of its restriction to diffuse oxygen, whereas the diffusion is higher in the PE.218,221,222
Use of a Nafion (perfluorinated polymers with sulfonate groups) thin film on Pd-loaded TiO2 nanoparticles was introduced by Kim et al. due to its stability against photocatalytic oxidation, and hence increases the photochemical conversion of CO2 under visible light irradiation.223 To provide multiple electrons, the Nafion layer can increase local proton activity inside the layer. It also helps to stabilize the intermediates and prevent the re-oxidation of the CO2 reduction yields because it inhibits direct interaction between products and surfaces of the catalysts. Another investigation shows that Nafion film acts as a good supportive material for catalysts due to cation exchange ability.198 This Nafion-supported Co(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+ system can increase the catalytic activity to a maximum of 400 h in atmospheric condition because of obstruction to the breakdown of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes that are trapped on the cation exchange polymer surface, and hence the separation of ligands is minimized. Low-band gap (1.5 eV) Cu2ZnSnS4 modified by the ruthenium complex polymer is a new addition to determine the photochemical performance of CO2 reduction under the visible light region, which shows high selectivity of the formate (>80%).224
3. Conclusions
The transformation of CO2 towards hydrocarbon fuels is a substitute approach to regulate both fuel crisis and global warming. Various inquiries have been undertaken to evaluate the photocatalytic performance over CO2 transformation into hydrocarbon fuels. This technology was found to be more promising, compared with other approaches such as thermochemical, electrochemical, and biological transformation technologies. In this paper, a general overview is emphasized on the behavior of different types of photocatalysts with respect to CO2 transformation into fuel. In various investigations, it was observed that most of the studies were carried out in the presence of artificial light sources. Recently, researchers have focused on direct solar fuel production by CO2 conversion. For such a phenomenon, the selective catalysts must have the desired band gap energy for visible light response. Previously, unmodified oxide and non-oxide semiconductors are widely used with or without supportive materials in this technology. However, some of them have high band gap energy and low conversion yields. To facilitate, some techniques have been followed to minimize band gap energy by doping the semiconductors with foreign elements like novel metals, transition metals, co-metals, and non-metals. It also influences the charge transfer rate and reduces the electron–hole recombination. Further, different substrate materials were used to achieve high surface area and the catalysts' immobilization during the photocatalytic irradiation. Recently, different types of sensitization techniques are incorporated to improve the photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation like dye sensitization, enzyme-based sensitization, QDs sensitization, and phthalocyanine sensitization. Both doped and sensitized semiconductors were employed for higher conversion. The selectivity of products not only depends on the catalysts' compositions but also on the choice of reductant and the solvent used in the catalytic system. Besides water, organic sacrificial reducing reagents are the most common reductants used in the photochemical CO2 conversion process. Although water is available and affordable, there are some limitations like low CO2 solubility, resulting in water splitting rather than CO2 reduction. Instead, methane and hydrogen were used as significant reductants in many investigations reported in this review. Other factors are definitely considerable for evaluating photocatalytic performance on CO2 reduction such as catalysts' dosage, reactants' ratio, reaction temperature, time, system pressure, pH, light intensity and wavelength. A clear idea is essential for understanding the reaction mechanisms together with charge carrier dynamics within the catalysts and at their interfaces with the metal co-catalysts. From this review, it is clear that the existing techniques are insufficient to make them applicable for the industrial production of fuels. As a result, the selection of solar-driven photocatalysts is essential for industrial solar fuel harvesting from CO2.
