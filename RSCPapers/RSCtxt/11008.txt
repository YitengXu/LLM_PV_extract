    , Accepted 9th September 2019First published on 10th September 2019AbstractThis study describes the synthesis and characterization of a non-peripherally tetra-substituted copper(II) phthalocyanine bearing 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenol groups. Some spectroscopic techniques such as FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MALDI-TOF, SEM and UV–vis were used to characterize the compounds. The novel molecule of 3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenoxy) phthalonitrile (1) was confirmed and its molecular structure and supra-molecular dynamics were revealed by the analysis of single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. Ligand (1) and its copper(II) phthalocyanine (2) were theoretically examined via HF and B3LYP, M06-2X methods by using the 3-21G, 6-31G and sdd basis sets. The calculated values of IR, NMR and UV–Vis spectra for ligand (1) and its copper(II) phthalocyanine (2) were compared with the experimentally obtained values. The absorbance and reflectance spectra, optical band gaps, refractive indices, and the optical and electrical conductivities of compound (2) for different concentrations were investigated in detail. We fabricated a photosensitive diode and investigated its photo-electrical properties under dark and light conditions.
1. Introduction
Phthalocyanines (Pcs) having interesting properties like high thermal stability, semiconductivity and photoconductivity are synthetic aromatic macrocycles and have been extensively studied due to their potential use in many organic electronic and optoelectronic devices, etc.1,2 However, the solubility of Pcs is a major problem that comes in the way of their use in such applications. Their solubility can be modified by inserting different metal ions into their inner core and/or by attaching different substituents at the peripheral and/or non-peripheral positions of the Pc-ring.3 Particularly, fluorinated phthalocyanines have been studied intensively by researchers due to the high electron withdrawing properties of fluorine atoms. Fluorine functional groups may increase Pc solubility because of fluorine having the highest electronegativity of all elements.4–6 Also, fluorinated phthalocyanines show an n-type behavior, while unsubstituted phthalocyanines exhibit a p-type behavior because of doping with the electron accepting properties of fluorine atoms.7,8
Because of their biological and technological importance, there are many studies in the literature on phthalocyanines which have both fluorine functional groups and a copper atom in their inner core.9–11 For example, in 2007, K. R. Rajesh et al.12 performed the solar cell characterization of CuPc using FTO and Al electrodes and then determined the photovoltaic parameters of the device by using the J–V characteristics and obtained the power conversion efficiency as 0.0024%. In 2010, C. Schuster et al.13 studied the ambipolar charge carrier transport properties of copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) experimentally in field-effect transistors and metal–insulator–semiconductor diodes at various temperatures and then presented the correspondence between the experimental results on thick films and the theoretical studies of single molecule contacts. In 2018, J. Chen et al.14 synthesized a novel series of fluorinated coumarin substituted zinc(II)/silicon(IV) phthalocyanines and the obtained results demonstrated that newly synthesized phthalocyanines could be good candidates for photodynamic therapy of cancer. Erdoğmuş and Nyokong15 reported the synthesis, characterization and photophysicochemical properties of FluXoro functional substituted zinc phthalocyanines and investigated the effect of fluoro-functional groups on the photophysical and photochemical parameters of zinc(II) phthalocyanines. Ragni et al.16 reported organic and organometallic fluorinated materials for electronics and optoelectronics. Wannebroucq et al.17 used phthalocyanines to build an electronic device, a p-type Molecular Semiconductor–Doped Insulator heterojunction (MSDI), in combination with lutetium bisphthalocyanine as a molecular semiconductor, and studied their chemosensing behavior. Gürol et al.18 examined the photochemical properties of fluorinated and nonfluorinated n-propanol-substituted zinc phthalocyanines. Mori and Shibata19 reported the synthesis and application of trifluoroethoxy-substituted phthalocyanines and subphthalocyanines. Martinelli et al.20 reported the synthetic aspects and electro-optical properties of fluorinated arylenevinylenes for luminescence and photovoltaics.
In this study, 3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenoxy) phthalonitrile (1) as a ligand and its non-peripherally substituted copper(II) phthalocyanine (2) were synthesized. The molecular structure of compound (1) was investigated and confirmed by the single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. Furthermore, its supramolecular stabilization dynamics were revealed by analysing the XRD results. The aim of the study is to investigate the UV spectra, and the electrical and optical properties of compound (2) for different concentrations in detail. Also, we aim to fabricate a photosensitive diode and to investigate its photo-electrical properties under dark and light conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and methods
Chloroform (CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF), 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenol, 3-nitrophthalonitrile, and CuCI2 were purchased from Merck and Alfa Aesar and used as received. All other reagents were obtained from Fluka, Aldrich and Alfa Aesar Chemical Co. and used without further purification. The purity of the products was tested in each step by TLC (SiO2, CHCl3/MeOH and THF/MeOH). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer spectrum two FT-IR spectrophotometer. Chromatography was performed with silica gel (Merck grade 60) obtained from Aldrich. All reactions were carried out under a dry N2 atmosphere. Routine UV–vis spectra were obtained using a quartz cuvette on an Agilent Model 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 spectrometer. Mass spectra (MS) were analyzed by MALDI SYNAPT G2-Si Mass Spectrometry. Elemental analysis (C, H and N) was performed using a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 elemental analyzer.
2.2. Synthesis

2.2.1. 3-(4-(Trifluoromethoxy) phenoxy) phthalonitrile (1). 
Under a N2 atmosphere, 3-nitrophthalonitrile (1.00 g, 5.78 mmol) was added dropwise to this mixture at 40 °C by stirring effectively for 3 days after mixing 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenol (1.13 g, 6.36 mmol) and finely ground anhydrous K2CO3 (∼2.30 g, excess) in DMF (10 mL). After cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, it was poured into ca. 150 mL of ice-water media. The obtained product was filtered and then washed with ca. 100 mL of water until the washings became neutral. The obtained product was dissolved in CHCl3 and washed with 5% NaHCO3 for removing the unreacted compounds. It was then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered. The product was further purified by silica gel chromatography by using a mixture of CHCl3:MeOH (100/3). Finally, it was crystallized to remove impurities in CHCl3/MeOH (50/10) and isolated by filtration, giving a pure crystallized light blue product.

2.3. X-ray data collection and refinement processes for compound (1)
The HKL data of compound (1) was collected at room temperature (T = 296 K) by using a Bruker APEX II Quazar three-circle diffractometer with mono-chromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The experiment was conducted by using a needle type colourless crystal with a size of 0.245 × 0.045 × 0.043 mm. In the experiment, a total of 6811 reflections were observed, of which 2467 were independent reflections and 1299 reflections were greater than 2σ (F2). The molecular structure was solved by using the direct methods in SHELXS and then refined by full-matrix least-squares refinements on F2 using SHELXL in the Olex2 program. First, all of the reflections were counted as isotropic until all of the atoms, except hydrogen atoms, were placed correctly. Then all of the atoms were refined as anisotropic. Finally, the hydrogen atoms were placed using the difference Fourier map and refined a few times as riding atoms. Finally, the goodness of fit was obtained as 1.051 and the refinement parameters with the reflections were obtained as R = 0.0710 (1299) and wR2 = 0.2198 (2467). Table 1 presents a summary of the refinement results and crystallographic information. The crystal stabilization dynamics of compound (1) was analysed by using the PLATON program.21 The check cif validation was done by using the check-CIF/PLATON web-based IUCr service.22 The crystallographic information file (cif) of compound (1) was uploaded to the data centre with the CCDC numbers 1889567.†

2.4. Calculation method
Theoretical studies are one of the most important tools used to compare the activities of molecules. Many programs and methods are used to make theoretical calculations. These programs can work in great harmony with each other. In this study, many programs such as GaussView 5.0.8, Gaussian09 AS64L-G09RevD.01, ChemDraw Professional 15.1, and Chemcraft V1.8 package programs were used in the preparation of molecules.28–31 These molecules were studied by the Hartree–Fock (HF)32 and Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP),33,34 and the M06-2X35 methods with the 3-21G, 6-31G and sdd basis sets. As a result of the calculations made on these basis sets, many parameters were obtained. HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) values were employed to obtain information about the activities of molecules by using these methods. Many parameters were obtained from quantum chemical calculations and these are called quantum chemical parameters such as EHOMO, ELUMO, ΔE (HOMO–LUMO energy gap), electronegativity (χ), chemical potential (μ), chemical hardness (η), electrophilicity (ω), nucleophilicity (ε), global softness (σ) and proton affinity (PA).36–45 (1) (2)
Ionization energy (I) and electron affinity (A) of the studied molecules were calculated with HOMO and LUMO energies that had the properties of electronegativity, global softness and chemical hardness by obtaining the following equations.46 (3) (4)
It is well known that global softness is defined as the inverse of chemical hardness. σ = 1/η(5) (6) (7)
The global electrophilicity index47 (ω) that was investigated by Parr et al., is the inverse of nucleophilicity and is given in eqn (8). Electrophilicity and nucleophilicity are used for the prediction of organic and inorganic reaction mechanisms. Nucleophilicity (ε) is defined as the inverse of electrophilicity in eqn (9). ω = μ2/2η = χ2/2η(8) ε = 1/ω(9)
2.5. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
SEM images of compound (2) were obtained to investigate its surface morphology properties with a JEOL JSM SEM 6060LV for ×100, ×250, ×500, ×1000, ×2500 and ×5000 magnifications at 20 kV.
2.6. Fabrication of a photosensitive diode
To produce a diode, we used a p-type Si (contains boron as a dopant, <100>) as a substrate, which was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. The p-type Si wafer was cleaved with a diamond cutter. Then, this wafer was chemically cleaned with the well-known RCA cleaning process,48 rinsed in deionized water (DIW) and dried by high purity nitrogen.49 To form the ohmic contact of the diode, silver (Ag) wire with a diameter of 2.0 mm and ≥99.99% trace metals basis was evaporated on the matt part of the p-Si wafer using the PVDHANDY/2S-TE thermal evaporation system. Then, we thermally coated compound (2) which was used as the active material on the bright part of the same wafer. The film thickness of compound (2) was found to be approximately 26 μm. On the other hand, to form the rectifier contact of the diode, an aluminum (Al) wire with a diameter of 1.0 mm and ≥99.99% trace metals basis was evaporated on an active compound (2) film layer in the form of circular dots of 1.930 mm diameter. Scheme 1 shows the schematic structure of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization
In this study, 3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenoxy) phthalonitrile (1) and its non-peripherally substituted copper(II) phthalocyanines (2) were synthesized. For this purpose, compound (1) and anhydrous CuCl2 metal salt were heated in a mixture of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) (3 drops) and hexanol (1.50 mL) at ca. 140 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 6 h (Scheme 2). The structure of the compounds was confirmed by using a series of spectroscopic techniques such as 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, FT-IR, mass spectra (MS) and UV–Vis. All the obtained results are consistent with the predicted structures.

Phthalocyanines are characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy. They give two strong absorption bands; one of them is called “Q band (at roughly 600–700 nm)” which is a single for metallophthalocyanines or split into two for metal-free phthalocyanines, and the other is called “B band (at roughly 300–350 nm)” in electronic spectra. Compared with the non-peripheral substituted phthalocyanine complexes, peripheral substituted complexes exhibit a blue-shift of about 20 nm in the Q-band region.50 The absorption spectra of phthalocyanine (2) shows intense Q bands at 687 nm in THF. The B band was observed at 340 nm for (2) (Fig. S1†).
In the FT-IR spectra, the formation of ligand (1) can be confirmed by the presence of peaks at 3059, 2246, 1414 and 1053 cm−1 corresponding to Ar–H, CN, CF3 and Ar–O–Ar, respectively (Fig. S2†). Also, the disappearance of the CN vibrational band of ligand (1) in the FT-IR spectra supported the formation of phthalocyanine (2) (Fig. S3†). The strong –C–F stretching band at 1465 cm−1 on the ring of phthalocyanine (2) was observed with a small shift compared to compound (1). It is seen that the obtained FT-IR values of compounds (1,2) are consistent with the results in the literature.51–53
The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of 3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenoxy) phthalonitrile (1) are very consistent with the expected structure. The carbon signals of the –OCF3 group of compound (1) were observed at 125.8, 122.3, 119.0, 115.6 ppm as a quartet in the DMSO (Fig. S4 and S5†).
In the mass spectra of compounds (1,2), the maximum molecular ion peaks were found in accordance with the theoretically calculated mass values, where the molecular ion peaks are at m/z 305.043 [M + H]+ for (1) (Fig. S6†) and at m/z 1280.449 [M]+ for (2) (Fig. S7†), respectively.
3.2. Results of the X-ray diffraction experiment for compound (1)
A triclinic (P) crystal of compound (1) formed with the unit cell parameters of a = 7.9064 Å, b = 8.1423 Å, c = 11.5605 Å, α = 98.881°, β = 106.291° and γ = 95.593°. There were two molecules in the unit cell and one of them indicated an asymmetric unit. Fig. 1 presents the atomic arrangement for the asymmetric unit with the atomic labels and the gravity centres (Cg). For clarity, the hydrogen atom labels are not provided in the figure. But the hydrogen atoms have been labelled with the same numbers as those of the carbon atoms to which they are bound (like C2–H2).
 Fig. 1  The atomic arrangement of the asymmetric unit for compound (1) with the atomic labels and centre of gravities (Cg). Cg1 and Cg2 represent the gravity centres for the C1–C6 and C9–C14 six-membered rings, respectively. 
In the asymmetric unit, no intra-molecular H⋯H interaction was observed. The C1–C6 and C9–C14 six-membered rings exhibited perfect planar mean-planes with the RMS values of 0.0023 Å and 0.0068 Å, respectively, and they conformed to an 82.5° dihedral angle. These two rings bound to the O1 atom with the bond lengths of 1.362 Å for C1–O1 and 1.405 Å for C9–O1. A bond angle of 117.3° formed for C1–O1–C9. The trifluoromethyl group bonded to the C9–C14 six-membered ring via C15–O2–C12 bonds with the bond angle of 120.3°. Thus, the trifluoromethyl group conformed out of the Cg2 plane with a 74.7° torsion angle for the C15–O2–C12–C11 bonds.
The solid stated crystal of compound (1) stabilized by the domination of five Cg⋯Cg and three Y–X⋯Cg inter-molecular interactions. These interactions are summarized in Tables S1 and S2,† respectively. In addition, only one strong donor–acceptor interaction is observed, which is C2–H2⋯N2, where the H2⋯N2 distance is 2.48 Å (symmetry code: 1 + x, y, z). A (100) view of the triclinic molecular assemblies of compound (1) with the stated unit cell. The blue dots indicate the C2–H2⋯N2 donor–acceptor interaction (Fig. S8†).
3.3. Quantum chemical calculation method
Theoretical calculations are widely used by researchers. A large number of parameters are obtained as a result of theoretical calculations. The chemical activities of molecules are compared by using these parameters. HOMO and LUMO, which are the most important parameters, are used to compare the chemical activities of molecules. The quantum chemical parameters obtained from theoretical studies are given in Table 2. By using these parameters, the chemical activities of the molecules can not only be compared but also the probabilities of chemical reactions can be investigated with these parameters.

The most important parameter obtained from the calculations is HOMO, which shows the tendency of the molecule to give electrons.54 Another most important parameter is LUMO, which indicates the tendency of the molecule to accept electrons in metal atoms.55
Many parameters were obtained by using these two important parameters. First, the ligand molecule was optimized on various basis sets. Using the resulting optimized structure, the HOMO, LUMO and ESP shapes of the ligand were plotted and are given in Fig. 2. Then, the optimized ligand was reacted with copper metal to form a complex, and the resulting complex is shown in Fig. S9.†
 Fig. 2  Optimized structure, HOMO, LUMO and ESP forms of compound (1). 
The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) was obtained from theoretical calculations by using the following equation: ΔG = EM–L complex − (EM + 2 + 4∑ELigand)(10)where EM–L complex is the sum of the electronic and thermal free energies of the metal-complex, Eligand is the sum of the electronic and thermal free energies of the ligand and EM + 2 is the sum of the electronic and thermal free energies of the metal ion. In order to calculate this value, the energy values of ligands and metal atoms are required.56,57 The energy values of the ligands and metal atoms are given in Table 2 and S3.† The energy value of the metal atoms was calculated at the Lanl2dz level. The energy values of the obtained complexes were calculated and the Gibbs free energy values are given in Table S4.†

3.3.1. NMR spectroscopy. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important methods used to determine the chemical structure and functional groups of molecules. The molecular structure is estimated according to the numerical values obtained from the interaction of atoms in a molecule. In this study, the ligand molecule in the HF/6-31++g (d, p) basis set in the gas, methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide phases was calculated. The chemical shift values of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule were calculated by using the gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) method.56,58 The atoms in the molecule were sequentially arranged and are given in Fig. S10.† The chemical shift values of the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule obtained in three different phases are given in Table S5.† As a result of these calculations, experimental chemical shift values versus theoretical chemical shift values were plotted, and are shown in Fig. S11.† In this graph, correlation curves were drawn for three different phases. Correlation curves were calculated for all phases by comparing experimental values against theoretical values. Following these, the R2 values that were found to be approximately 0.99 of the correlation graphs were calculated. The obtained R2 values showed that the experimental values were in great agreement with the theoretical values. As these values increased, the reliability of the calculations also increased. When the results obtained in these calculations were examined, it was seen that the chemical shift values of the hydrogen atoms attached to the aromatic ring are in the range of 7–9 ppm. The chemical shift of the carbon atoms in the aromatic ring is in the range of 106–163 ppm.


3.3.2. IR spectroscopy. 
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is another important method used to illuminate the structures of ligand and metal complexes. Infrared spectra are the frequencies of the vibrations of atoms in ligands and metal complexes. These occur when the rays sent to the molecule are converted into vibrations by atoms.59–63 As in other spectroscopic methods, the structure of the sample molecules is used in illumination. The IR spectra of the ligand and metal complexes were calculated on the basis of hf/6-31++g (d, p) in the Gaussian package program. The IR spectra obtained using the optimized structures of the ligand and metal complexes were used in the VEDA 4XX program for further investigations.56,58,64 The IR spectral peaks of the ligand and metal complexes obtained from the VEDA 4XX program are shown in Table S6.† The obtained theoretical and experimental spectra are compared, and although the spectra are quite similar, the numerical values in the spectra are different from each other. The experimental spectral numerical values of the studied molecules are lower than the theoretical values. The calculated wave numbers are different from the measured values. There are many reasons for this difference. Firstly, the theoretical values were calculated in the gas phase. In gas phase calculations, the environment is isolated and insulated. That is, there is no experimental intervention. However, interventions in experimental environments change experimental results.65–67 It was observed from the obtained spectra that the numerical values of the theoretically obtained spectra were 200 cm higher than the experimentally obtained spectral values in Fig. S12 and S13.† In experimental environments, the prepared solid-state intermolecular crystal packing effects, which are peculiar to this group of sensitive vibrational modes, are determined by the peripheral H atoms.60,61 This is the Doppler effect (or the Doppler shift) which is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. The reason why the obtained experimental numerical values are lower than computational values may be the Doppler shift.62 Doppler blueshift is caused by the movement of a source towards the observer. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency caused by relative motion, even outside the visible spectrum. Only objects moving at near-relativistic speeds toward the observer appear noticeably bluer to the naked eye, but the wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or another particle is shortened in the direction of travel.60 For example, the C–O band tensile vibration is experimentally observed at 1225 cm−1, which is about 200 cm less than the theoretical result at 1425 cm−1.


3.3.3. UV–Vis spectroscopy. 
Ultraviolet and visible light (UV–Vis) absorption spectroscopy refers to the spectra of molecules in electronic transitions. This method is based on the principle that the beam sent to the sample is absorbed by the sample. In this spectrum, the ligand was calculated in the basis set HF/6-31++g in different solvents namely gas (ε = 1), chloroform (ε = 4.711), methanol (ε = 32.613), dimethyl sulfoxide (ε = 46.826), water (ε = 78.355), and the n-methyl formamide-mixture (ε = 181.56) phase, as shown in Fig. S14.† In this figure, the ligand molecule has been studied in two ways: in different phases and how it affects the electronic transitions in different phases. When the dielectric constant of the solvent increases, the wavelength absorbed by the ligand increases.63,64 When the UV–VIS spectrum of the ligand in different phases is examined, it is generally seen that there are two basic peaks. At these basic peaks, it is assumed that n → π* and π → π* are electronic transitions.

3.4. Absorbance and reflectance spectra
Spectroscopy is an important technique that measures the interaction of molecules with electromagnetic radiation. Absorption spectroscopy measurements are carried out with molecules dissolved in solvents as they can be performed with films. Spectroscopic measurements are very sensitive and small amounts of materials are often sufficient for these measurements. To determine the electronic, structural and optical properties of a material, absorbance (Abs) is an important parameter. Fig. 3 shows the absorbance spectra of compound (2) for 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 μM concentrations. Compound (2) shows interesting results due to its behaviour in the near ultraviolet and visible regions. Compound (2) exhibits two dominant absorbance peaks (at 233 and 340 nm) in the near ultraviolet region and two dominant absorbance peaks (at 622 and 688 nm, which is the maximum peak) in the visible region. Of course, as the concentration of the solution increases, the absorbance value of compound (2) also increases. At wavelengths greater than about 740 nm, the absorbance remains minimal and constant. When the results obtained are compared with similar studies in the literature,68–70 it is seen that the absorbance values of compound (2) are greater than those in the studies in the literature.
 Fig. 3  The absorbance spectra of compound (2) for 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 μM concentrations. 
The ability of a material to reflect energy occurring on its surface is known as the reflection of a material. By reflection, the surface quality of the surface structure of a material can be defined and, of course, this occurs only when light falls on the surface of the material. For this, we evaluated the reflectance spectra of compound (2) for related concentrations as seen in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4, the reflectance varies considerably with concentration and increases with increasing concentration. These results also show that compound (2) is a good reflective material, especially at high concentrations, and that this compound is suitable for applications and devices requiring high reflective behavior.

3.5. Optical band gap
Band gap (the forbidden energy gap or the energy gap) in semiconductors is known as the difference between the energy of the lowest conduction band (CB) and that of the highest valence band (VB). Optical band gap (Eg) is a very significant parameter to investigate the semiconductor properties of a material.
The energy band gap is generally classified as direct allowed and forbidden transition. We determined that the optical transmission of compound (2) is a direct allowed transition, as described by the methods in the literature.71 Then, we obtained the direct allowed optical band gap (Egd) values of compound (2) for 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 μm from the (αhv)2 curves vs. photon energy (E) (α is the absorption coefficient) using the Tauc model72 as seen in Fig. 5a. The optical band gap of compound (2) decreases from 3.098 to 2.717 eV with increasing concentration. We can also see in Fig. 5b that the optical band gap decreases significantly with increasing concentration. This optical transition behavior and the optical band gap values indicate that compound (2) is a semiconductor and is suitable for the production of optoelectronic devices.

3.6. Refractive indices
The refractive index (n) is dependent on the wavelength of the incident light, is a dimensionless quantity and characterizes the speed of light in the environment. Refractive index has an important place in optical technology and applications in terms of investigating the properties of an interface between different environments.
There are many techniques to determine refractive index. Here, we calculated the refractive index values of compound (2) from various correlations (Kumar-Singh, Moss, Herve-Vandamme, Reddy and Ravindra)73 based on the optical band gaps obtained. Fig. 6 shows the curves of the refractive indices for related correlations and for 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 μm. The refractive index of compound (2) increases with increasing concentration and varies with various correlations.
 Fig. 6  The curves of the refractive indices of compound (2) for various correlations and for 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 μM. 
The angle (Φ1) of incidence is defined as the angle between the incident beam (ray) and normal. It is extremely important for determining the angle of refraction. The angle (Φ2) of refraction is defined as the angle between the refracted beam and the normal. The Φ1 and Φ2 expressions can be obtained by the following equations:74 (11)and (12)
The Φ1 and Φ2 values of compound (2) for 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 μM were calculated from eqn (11) and (12), respectively. Fig. 7 shows the Φ1 and Φ2 curves of compound (2) for related concentrations. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the angles of incidence and refraction of compound (2) change in an interesting way as the angular frequency changes. So, it is decreasing and increasing. This shows that compound (2) exhibits both normal and abnormal behavior.71,74

3.7. Optical and electrical conductivities
Optical conductivity (σop) is a material characteristic that connects the current density to the electric field for general frequencies, while electrical conductivity (σelec) is the characteristic of a particular electrical component and measures how easily electricity flows from electrical components for a given voltage difference. σop and σelec can be given by the following equations:75 (13)and (14)where c is the velocity of light. The σop and σelec values of compound (2) for 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 μM were calculated from eqn (13) and (14), respectively. Fig. 8(a and b) shows the σop and σelec curves of compound (2) for related concentrations, respectively. The optical conductivity (Fig. 8a) of compound (2) is in the order of 1010 S, while the electrical conductivity (Fig. 8b) of compound (2) is in the order of 102 S. Both conductivities increase with increasing concentration.

3.8. Surface morphological properties
We investigated the SEM images of compound (2) for different sizes. The SEM images of compound (2) for ×100, ×250, ×500, ×1000, ×2500 and ×5000 magnifications are shown in Fig. 9(a–f), respectively. As can be understood from the smaller scale SEM images, compound (2) is composed of large and small spongy structures on a clayey surface. As the SEM images are enlarged, the spongy structure becomes more pronounced.

We analyzed the SEM image of compound (2) and distributions of the specified particles (numbers of 1, 2 and 3) based on intensities, elements and concentrations as seen in Fig. 10. For this, we selected three regions (1, 2 and 3) on the SEM image of compound (2) and analyzed their intensities, elements and concentrations. Table 3 gives the names of these elements, intensities and concentrations of the regions 1, 2 and 3. The intensity and concentration of the C element are the highest for all three regions. The dominance of the Cu element in the compound can also be clearly understood from Table 3. On the other hand, the intensity and concentration values of the O, F and S elements also differ for each region. These different distributions of the respective elements can be attributed to the non-homogeneous SEM images and structural sizes of compound (2) in each region.3

3.9. Photo-electrical behavior of the diode
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode for the forward and reverse regions and under dark conditions and at 100 mW cm−2 were measured and are shown in Fig. 11(a and b) for non-logarithmic (I vs. V) and semi-logarithmic (ln I vs. V) currents vs. V, respectively. The p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode exhibits a rectifying (non-ideal) diode behavior in the forward-bias region as seen in Fig. 11a. When comparing the I–V curves under dark and light conditions in Fig. 11a, it can be said that the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode shows a very high sensitivity to light and the I–V characteristic is greatly affected by light. This indicates that compound (2) has very high sensitivity to light. Another result is that the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode shows a small ohmic characteristic at very low voltages, while it shows a rectifier at much higher voltages. As can be seen from Fig. 11b, the current values of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode under illumination in both the forward and reverse bias-regions are greater than the current values in the dark. This indicates that the current of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode increases with light, that is to say that photo current is formed.
 Fig. 11  The (a) non-logarithmic (I vs. V) and (b) semi-logarithmic (ln I vs. V) currents vs. V of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode. 
The rectification ratio (r) is an important parameter for a rectifying diode and is given by (15)where If is the forward current and Ir is the reverse current. The rectification ratio values of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode under dark conditions and at 100 mW cm−2 were found to be 1.793 × 104 and 1.661 × 103, respectively. These results show that the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode has good rectifier properties under both dark conditions and at 100 mW cm−2, but the rectification ratio in the dark is greater than the one under 100 mW cm−2.
For a non-ideal diode, the standard equation of the diode can be expressed by taking into account serial resistance and can be written by:29 (16)where Io is the reverse saturation current, q is the electronic charge, Rs is the series resistance, n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Io is given by: (17)where A is the contact area, A* is the Richardson constant and ϕB is the barrier height. The saturation currents of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode under dark conditions and at 100 mW cm−2 were obtained from the linear portion intercept of log I at V = 0. Thence, we calculated the ideality factor values of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode under dark conditions and at 100 mW cm−2 as 2.105 and 2.087, respectively. These ideality factor values indicate that the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode is a near-ideal diode and that compound (2) is suitable for diode applications. Then, we obtained the barrier height values of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode under dark conditions and at 100 mW cm−2 as 0.929 and 0.918 eV, respectively. This result shows that the barrier height can be reduced by light intensity. All these results indicate that compound (2) is suitable for electronic and photonic applications.
4. Conclusion
We have reported the synthesis and characterization of 3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenoxy) phthalonitrile (1) as a ligand and its “1(4),8(11),15(18),22(25)-Tetrakis-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenoxy) copper(II) phthalocyanine” (2). The XRD experiment confirmed that the single crystal of the novel compound (1) can be successfully synthesized by the method described in this manuscript. The interaction of the ligand molecule with copper metal was investigated in different basis sets. NMR, IR and UV–VIS spectra of the ligand and metal complexes were studied and the obtained values were compared with the experimental values. We investigated the UV spectra, electrical and optical properties of compound (2) for different concentrations in detail. Also, we fabricated a photosensitive diode and investigated its photo-electrical properties under dark and light intensity. Compound (2) is seen as a suitable material for applications and devices requiring high reflective behavior. The optical band gap of compound (2) decreases from 3.098 to 2.717 eV with increasing concentration. The fabricated p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode exhibits a near-ideal diode behaviour. The rectification ratio values of the p-Si/compound (2)/Al diode under dark conditions and at 100 mW cm−2 were found to be 1.793 × 104 and 1.661 × 103, respectively. All these indicate that compound (2) is suitable for electronic and photonic applications. Compared to similar studies in the literature, this study is quite novel and provides important contributions to the literature in terms of synthesized related material, properties examined with the related technique and the photosensitivity diode produced with new material.
