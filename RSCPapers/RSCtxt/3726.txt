    , Accepted 7th August 2020First published on 7th August 2020AbstractHybrid carbon materials are found to exhibit novel optoelectronic properties at their interfaces, but the related interfacial carrier dynamics is rarely explored theoretically. In this contribution, we have employed density functional theory (DFT) and DFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics methods to explore photoinduced interfacial electron transfer processes at interfaces between a single-walled carbon nanotube with chiral index (6,5) and C60 or C70 (C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65). We have found that with low E11 excitation, electron transfer takes place from CNT65 to C60 and C70 in both heterojunctions. This process is ultrafast and completed within about 200 fs, which is consistent with recent experiments. Differently, high E22 excitation does not induce electron injection to C60 in C60@CNT65; instead, “hot” electrons produced within CNT65 will be trapped in its higher conduction band for a while because of slow inter-band relaxation. By contrast, in C70@CNT65, high E22 excitation still can lead to ultrafast electron transfer to C70, but only a comparable amount of electrons are transferred (ca. 30%). Interestingly, electrons either remaining on CNT65 or transferred to C70 are trapped in the higher conduction band for a while, similarly, due to slow inter-band relaxation. The present results could be useful to guide the design of excellent interfaces of mixed-dimensional hybrid carbon materials for various optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
As one of the most abundant elements on earth, carbon has several allotropes, e.g. graphenes, fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes.1–6 Their unique optoelectronic properties allow them to have prospective applications in the fields of photodetectors, solar cells, and photocatalysts; therefore, past decades have witnessed extensive studies from both experimental and computational perspectives.7–16 Recently, combining different carbon allotropes to form mixed-dimensional carbon materials has aroused extensive research interest because of their novel optoelectronic properties.17–23 One of the most promising composite materials is to combine carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and fullerenes via noncovalent van der Waals interactions. In the past years, numerous experiments have been conducted to explore the optoelectronic properties of this kind of hybrid carbon materials.24–33 For example, Forrest et al. demonstrate that photogenerated excitons can be efficiently dissociated at interfaces of planar heterojunctions of CNTs and C60 and these hybrid carbon materials could be used as photodetectors.34 Tung et al. have found that hybrid CNT and C60 materials can be used as photovoltaic devices with a power conversion efficiency of 0.21%,35 which was later on increased to 0.85% by simply replacing C60 with C70.36 Dai et al. demonstrate that photoinduced interfacial electron transfer from CNTs to C60 can initiate metal-free and multifunctional electrocatalysis for oxygen and hydrogen evolution.37
It is obvious that the optoelectronic properties of hybrid CNT/fullerene materials are heavily related to photoinduced charge separation processes at interfaces. Thus, a deep understanding of photoinduced interfacial charge transfer dynamics is helpful for rationally improving the optoelectronic performances of these hybrid carbon materials. For example, Arnold and coworkers have employed a series of techniques to explore exciton dissociation and charge transfer at interfaces of heterojunctions between CNTs and polymeric photovoltaic materials including fullerenes.38–41 Blackburn et al. have employed ultrafast spectroscopies to explore the exciton dissociation and diffusion, interfacial charge transfer, and electron–hole recombination processes of heterojunctions of CNTs and fullerenes, in which electron injection to C60 is determined to take less than 120 fs.42–45 Recently, Gulbinas et al. have also applied ultrafast all-optical electric field strength measurement techniques to directly track interfacial carrier separation and motion dynamics of CNTs and C60. Photoinduced interfacial electron transfer is estimated to complete within 1 ps.46 In addition, D’Souza and Flavel's groups have also studied the effects of the diameters of CNTs on interfacial electron transfer.47,48 Computationally, Prezhdo and coworkers have carried out time-domain density functional theory (DFT)-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations on interfacial carrier transfer and electron–hole recombination dynamics of isolated CNTs and various hybrid CNT materials with organic polymers and porphyrins.49–51 Guo et al. have also investigated interfacial charge separation at interfaces of C60/MoS2 using a similar non-adiabatic dynamics simulation method.52 However, theoretical calculations are hardly reported for heterojunctions of CNTs and fullerenes except DFT calculations on the effects of chirality of CNTs on electron transfer to fullerenes.53
In this contribution, we have employed DFT calculations and time-domain DFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations to explore photoinduced interfacial electron transfer dynamics at interfaces of CNT(6,5) (CNT65) with C60 and C70 with different E11 and E22 excitations. It is found that both C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65 have similar ultrafast electron transfer processes with low E11 excitation. Interestingly, high E22 excitation makes interfacial electron transfer inhibited in C60@CNT65; by contrast, there remains substantial electron transfer occurring in C70@CNT65.
Simulation details
Our studied C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65 systems have 424 and 434 atoms, respectively. Their lattice parameters are a = 16.00 Å, b = 40.64 Å, and c = 42.47 Å. In order to avoid arbitrary interactions between periodic images, a vacuum layer thickness of 20.0 Å is used. Geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations are carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) method implemented in the Quickstep/CP2K package in which a mixed Gaussian and plane wave (GPW) basis set with a cutoff of 400 Ry is used.54,55 The generalized gradient approximation Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional (PBE) and the DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH basis set and Goedecker–Teter–Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials are used.56–60 The optimized structures are then used to calculate structural and electronic properties. In density of states (DOS) calculations, the hybrid HSE06 functional is also used.61–64 van der Waals interactions are described by the empirical dispersion correction method of Grimme.65 Due to the large size of our simulated systems only the gamma point is used in our calculations. The adsorption energy of C60 on CNT65 is estimated according to the following formula:E(ads) = E(C60) + E(CNT65) − E(C60@CNT65)where E(C60@CNT65), E(C60), and E(CNT65) represent the total energies of relaxed C60@CNT65, C60, and CNT65, respectively. Similarly, the adsorption energy of C70 on CNT65 can be obtained. Relaxed systems are heated to 300 K and then equilibrated for 1 ps with a time step of 1 fs for nuclear propagation, during which a five-order Nosé–Hoover chain thermostat technique is used to control the temperature.66,67 After that, 1 ps micro-canonical dynamics simulations are conducted, from which 100 initial conditions are generated for the above surface hopping simulations. For each set of initial conditions, 300 trajectories are prepared and in total 100 × 300 trajectories are run.68,69 The energies of all relevant adiabatic states and nonadiabatic couplings between different adiabatic states that are needed for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations are extracted and calculated from NVE trajectories. In the simulations time-dependent occupation numbers of adiabatic states pi(t) are averaged “on-the-fly” over 300 trajectories that share the same initial conditions. Finally, time-dependent electron amounts on C60 and C70 are calculated and averaged over all 100 initial conditions (see the ESI† for details). More details on the theoretical background are elaborated in the ESI† and our recently published work.70–73
Results and discussion
Heterojunction structures of C60 and C70 and CNT65 are optimized at the PBE+D3 level (see the top panel of Fig. 1).56,65 In both heterojunctions, C60 and C70 are physically adsorbed on CNT65. In the optimized structures, the distance between centroids of C60 [C70] and CNT65 is calculated to be 10.102 [10.478] Å in C60@CNT65 [C70@CNT65]. Upon heating to 300 K, the corresponding distance is increased to ca. 11.347 [10.576] Å. These long distances show that both C60 and C70 are physically adsorbed on CNT65 without chemical bonds formed. The adsorption energies are estimated to be 0.46 and 0.60 eV at the PBE+D3 level, which are marginally increased to 0.60 and 0.72 eV at the HSE06+D3 level.59

The projected density of states (PDOS) can help to understand the interfacial carrier transfer dynamics. Fig. 1 shows PBE+D3 calculated PDOS results of C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65 (see Fig. S1 for those with HSE06+D3, ESI†). Both the PBE+D3 and HSE06+D3 methods clearly show that they are type II heterojunctions in which the conduction band minimum (CBM) is from C60 or C70, while the valence band maximum (VBM) is from CNT65. The band gaps of both the C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65 heterojunctions are calculated to be 0.79 and 0.82 eV at the PBE+D3 level (1.13 and 1.12 eV at HSE06+D3). Accordingly, the band gaps of C60 and C70 are estimated to be 1.62 [2.18] and 1.69 [2.18] eV at the PBE+D3 [HSE06+D3] level, whereas CNT65 has band gaps of 0.93 and 0.93 eV [1.17 and 1.16 eV]. These data illustrate that adsorption of C60 or C70 on CNT65 has little influence on their band gaps even at different computational levels.
In-depth analysis of the PDOS of C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65 reveals several interesting points. It is clear from Fig. 1 that there exists a very small energy gap between the CBMs of C60 or C70 and CNT65, 0.14 [0.04] eV for C60@CNT65 and 0.11 [0.04] eV for C70@CNT65 at the PBE+D3 [HSE06+D3] level. Thus, in both heterojunctions, electron transfer from CNT65 to C60 or C70 is allowed thermodynamically and expected to be ultrafast when CNT65's CBM is populated with low E11 excitation energy. However, when high E22 excitation energy is given to excite CNT65, the situation changes. In C60@CNT65, when an electron in the valence band is excited into the second conduction band of CNT65, electron transfer from CNT65 to C60 will become very slow concerning the following two reasons. First, the second conduction band of C60 is much higher than the second conduction band of CNT65, which is 0.56 and 0.77 eV at the PBE+D3 and HSE06+D3 levels. Second, there is a comparable energy gap between the first and second conduction bands of CNT65, 0.38 and 0.45 eV at the same computational level, which greatly slows down the inter-band electronic transition. However, in C70@CNT65, the second conduction band of C70 largely overlaps the second conduction band of CNT65. The difference of their minima is merely 0.04/0.11 eV at the PBE+D3/HSE06+D3 level. Therefore, electron transfer should take place efficiently from CNT65 to C70 in C70@CNT65 when high excitation energy makes the second conduction band of CNT65 populated. Nevertheless, further cooling relaxation processes within either C70 or CNT65 should be slow because of the considerable energy gaps between the first and second conduction bands of CNT65 (0.36 and 0.45 eV) and C70 (0.51 and 0.60 eV at the PBE+D3 and HSE06+D3 levels). By contrast, the valence band of C70 or C60 is much lower than that of CNT65 in energy in both C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65 (see Fig. 1). Therefore, when CNT65 is excited, it has very little chance for interfacial hole transfer to take place. Instead, inter- and intra-band hole cooling processes within CNT65 prefer to occur. Because our present studies are focused on interfacial electron transfer motivated by recent experiments, hole cooling processes will not be discussed below.
Next we are focused on studying the initially excited electron states in these heterojunctions, which are useful to prepare nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of photoinduced interfacial electron transfer dynamics. For C60@CNT65, the lowest electronic transition takes place between the first valence and conduction bands of CNT65, i.e. from state-847 and state-848 to state-852 and state-853 (see Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, ESI†). The excitation energy is estimated to be 0.93 and 1.17 eV at the PBE+D3 and HSE06+D3 levels. This low excitation energy produces an excited electron in state-852 or state-853, both of which are higher than the CBM of C60. Thus, photoinduced interfacial electron transfer from CNT65 to C60 is favorable in energy. In comparison, a higher electronic transition is produced between the second valence and conduction bands of CNT65 with ca. 1.84 and 2.24 eV at the same computational levels. These electronic transitions are mainly from state-843 and state-844 to state-856 and state-857, therefore resulting in a hot excited electron in either state-856 or state-857. Nevertheless, both states are still much lower than the second conduction band of C60, i.e. state-871 to state-873. So, photoinduced interfacial electron transfer from CNT65 to C60 should be not available. For C70@CNT65, the situation is similar. The lowest and higher electronic transitions also occur between the first and second valence and conduction bands of CNT65. The corresponding excitation energies are predicted to be 0.93 [1.17] eV and 1.84 [2.23] eV at the PBE+D3 [HSE06+D3] level, respectively. As a result, an excited electron is promoted to occupy state-872 or state-873 with low excitation energy, or state-877 or state-878 with high excitation energy. These occupied electron states overlap the first and second conduction bands of C70 and interfacial electron transfer from CNT65 to C70 can happen in a favorable manner in terms of energetics. Fig. 2 shows selected electronic states relevant to interfacial electron transfer in C60@CNT65 [C70@CNT65], where state-849 [state-869] and state-852 [state-872] are primarily located on C60 [C70] and CNT65, respectively. Other relevant electronic states of C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65 are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†).

To quantitatively explore the photoinduced interfacial electron transfer dynamics between CNT65 and C60 or C70, we have carried out time-domain DFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of photoexcited C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65 heterojunctions under the classical path approximation.74–76 In the dynamics simulations, two different initial excited electron states are prepared for C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65. In the first one, an excited electron state is generated in the first conduction band of CNT65 because of the low E11 electronic transition; whereas, in the second one, an electron is promoted to the second conduction band due to the high E22 electronic transition. For C60@CNT65, with low E11 excitation, one can see ultrafast interfacial electron injection from CNT65 to C60 within ca. 200 fs as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 3. The initial electron transfer is very fast (50% in about 50 fs). At 200 fs, the electron transfer is almost finished. In conjunction with the fact that there is no reverse electron transfer observed at all, it demonstrates that electron transfer from CNT65 to C60 is a very favorable process thermodynamically. By contrast, with high E22 excitation, one does not see any interfacial electron transfer between CNT65 and C60. The electron amount transferred to C60 is nearly zero in the simulation time (see panel (b) in Fig. 3).

The electronic dynamics of C70@CNT65 is more complicated than that of C60@CNT65. First, the dynamical behavior of photoinduced interfacial electron transfer is highly similar with low E11 excitation. As shown in panel (c) of Fig. 3, electron transfer to C70 from CNT65 is also an ultrafast process. In the first 100 fs, ca. 80% of electrons have already moved to C70 and the population becomes much more stable after 200 fs. In addition, as with C60@CNT65, there is no reverse electron transfer phenomenon. However, the situation of C70@CNT65 is qualitatively different from that of C60@CNT65 upon the high E22 electronic transition within CNT65. On one hand, there is ca. 10% already located on C70 in the beginning (see panel (d) in Fig. 3). This differs from the other cases where its initial population is basically close to zero (see panels (a–c)). On the other hand, one can see a rapid increase of electron population on C70 from 10% to 30% in the first 100 fs. Afterwards, this 30% electron population is maintained until the end of the simulation time except some visible fluctuation.
How can we understand the above similarities and dissimilarities of the photoinduced interfacial electron transfer dynamics between C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65 with either low E11 or high E22 electronic transitions? In-depth analysis shows that these dynamical results are highly interrelated with related energy levels of C60 or C70 and CNT65. In C60@CNT65, when an excited electron is generated in the first conduction band of CNT65, interfacial electron transfer to C60 is highly favorable because donor electron states of CNT65 and acceptor states of C60 overlap greatly in energy (see panel (a) in Fig. 4). This will lead to very small energy gaps between two nearby electron states. As shown in panel (a) of Fig. 5, the energy gaps related to the first conduction bands of C60 and CNT65, i.e. Ei+1–Ei (i = 849–853), are all smaller than 4.0 kcal mol−1 and mostly around 1.5 kcal mol−1. These much small energy gaps benefit relevant electronic nonadiabatic transitions from C60 to CNT65, leading to ultrafast electron injection (see panel (a) in Fig. 3). Instead, when the high E22 electronic transition occurs in CNT65, excited electrons will be trapped in the second conduction band for a while because of the following two reasons. First, there are no acceptor electron states of C60 in the neighborhood of CNT65 in energy (see panel (a) in Fig. 4). Therefore, interfacial electron transfer from CNT65 to C60 cannot happen, which has been seconded in our nonadiabatic electronic dynamics in panel (b) of Fig. 3. Instead, excited electrons can decay via a nonadiabatic inter-band transition from the second to first conduction bands of CNT65. But, this relaxation channel will be heavily suppressed due to the comparatively large energy gap between these two conduction bands, which is calculated to be on average 8.0 kcal mol−1 as shown in panel (b) of Fig. 5. Of course, once the inter-band transition is finished, interfacial electron transfer from CNT65 to C60 will happen from the first conduction band of CNT65 as observed in the above E11 electronic transition. Finally, it should be noted that the present simulations do not see the inter-band transition because of the short simulation time. On the side of photoinduced hole dynamics, because there is not any overlap in energy between the hole states of C60 and CNT65 in either the E11 or E22 electronic transitions, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4, holes will stay in the first and second valence bands of CNT65 for some time, respectively.

In C70@CNT65, when the low E11 electronic transition takes place, the situation is similar to that in C60@CNT65. First, both first conduction bands of C70 and CNT65 are close to each other, which leads to much small energy gaps, as shown in panel (c) in Fig. 5, i.e. Ei+1–Ei (i = 869–873). These small gaps, on average 1.0 kcal mol−1, also make interfacial electron transfer happen efficiently. This point has been supported by dynamics simulations, where electron transfer is overall finished within 100 fs (see panel (c) in Fig. 3). In addition, because the first conduction band minimum of C70 is lower than that of CNT65, 0.11 and 0.04 eV at the PBE+D3 and HSE06+D3 levels, reverse electron transfer is not favorable and one can see a thorough CNT65-to-C70 electron transfer process. But, upon the high E22 electronic transition, it is more complicated. Because the second conduction bands of C70 and CNT65 have good overlap in energy, the energy gaps between donor states of CNT65 and acceptor states of C70 become small, which are also on average 1.0 kcal mol−1 [see Ei+1–Ei (i = 874–878) in panel (c) of Fig. 5]. This enables interfacial electron transfer from C70 to CNT65, so one can see rapid electron transfer whose population increases from 10% to 30% in panel (d) of Fig. 3. But, the interfacial electron transfer is not as complete as that observed in the low E11 electronic transition (see panel (c) in Fig. 3). High E22 excitation with CNT65 produces an excited electron in state-877 or state-878, which is a little higher than the second conduction band minimum of C70, i.e. state-876. Thus, interfacial electron transfer from CNT65 to C70 can happen. Nevertheless, the conduction band minimum of CNT65 i.e. state-874 is still lower than the second conduction band minimum of C70, 0.04 and 0.11 eV at the PBE+D3 and HSE06+D3 levels, and a large portion of electrons is finally located on CNT65 and only a small portion remains on C70. This is consistent with the electronic dynamics in panel (d) of Fig. 3, where only 30% of electrons are located on C70 at the end of the simulation time and a small but visible fluctuation is observed. Similarly, excited electrons in the second conduction band of either C70 and CNT65 can further decay to their first conduction bands, but the corresponding large energy gaps inhibit these processes to certain extent (see panel (d) in Fig. 5). So, one does not see these inter-band electronic transitions in our ultrafast electronic dynamics simulations. The situation of hole dynamics in C70@CNT65 is like that in C60@CNT65. Excited holes will be trapped in the first and second valence bands of CNT65 for a while in the low E11 and high E22 electronic transitions.
Conclusions
In summary, using DFT calculations, we have explored the interfacial properties of heterojunctions of C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65. It is found that interfacial electron transfer to C60 and C70 is thermodynamically allowed with low E11 excitation in both hybrid carbon heterojunctions; but, the case becomes complicated with high E22 excitation. In C60@CNT65, electron injection to C60 is unfavourable in energy and “hot” electrons produced are trapped in a high conduction band owing to relatively inefficient inter-band relaxation within CNT65. In C70@CNT65, electron transfer to C70 remains possible from the point of view of energy; but, further inter-band relaxation processes within either CNT65 or C70 are slow. These points are further verified by DFT-based time-domain nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. In these two heterojunctions, low E11 excitation within CNT65 leads to ultrafast electron transfer to C60 and C70 in that nearly all electrons are transferred in about 200 fs. The estimated time constant of 65 fs for C60@CNT65 is consistent with recent experiments.42–45 Dissimilarly, with high E22 excitation, there is no electron injection to C60 observed for C60@CNT65 in our 500 fs dynamics simulations. But, in C70@CNT65, high E22 excitation can lead to partial ultrafast electron transfer to C70. This could rationalize why replacing C60 with C70 in hybrid carbon materials of CNT with fullerenes can improve power conversion efficiencies in recent experiments.35,36 The present contribution could supply valuable information for designing mixed-dimensional hybrid carbon materials with excellent interfaces suitable for various optoelectronic applications.

 	Fig. 1  (Top) Schematic heterojunction structures of PBE+D3 optimized C60@CNT65 (424 atoms) and C70@CNT65 (434 atoms) (left and right); (down) PBE+D3 calculated projected density of states (PDOS) of C60@CNT65 and C70@CNT65.	 

 	Fig. 2  Frontier states of (left) C60@CNT65 (i.e. state-849 and state-852) and (right) C70@CNT65 (i.e. state-869 and state-872) relevant to interfacial electron transfer dynamics. See the ESI† for other similar states.	 

 	Fig. 3  Time-dependent electron amount that is transferred to (a and b) C60 or (c and d) C70 from CNT65 calculated based on our nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic diagrams of photoinduced interfacial electron transfer between C60 or C70 and CNT65 and relevant inter-band transitions in (a) C60@CNT65 and (b) C70@CNT65. See the text for discussion.	 

 	Fig. 5  Energy gaps of the two energetically nearest states (a) Ei+1–Ei (i = 849–853, 854–858) and (b) E854–E853 of C60@CNT65 and (c) Ei+1–Ei (i = 869–873, 874–878) and (d) E874–E873 of C70@CNT65 calculated based on all nonadiabatic dynamics trajectories.
