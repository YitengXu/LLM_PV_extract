    AbstractHere, we report the preparation of well-controlled nanoscale morphologies in photoactive thin films. The fabrication of bulk heterojunction structures in blend films of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) employed two steps to achieve first the in situ formation of self-organized P3HT nanowires using a marginal solvent, and second, phase separation via mild thermal annealing. Morphological changes in the active layers that had been spin-cast from a marginal solvent, with varying annealing temperatures, were systematically studied and compared to the morphologies of films spin-cast from a good solvent. The interpenetrating nanowire structure yielded power conversion efficiencies as high as 4.07% due to the enhanced charge transport. Hole and electron mobilities increased substantially to 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, due to the two step process of P3HT crystallization by nanowire formation and subsequent phase separation. Photovoltaic performances improved with increasing film thickness up to 300 nm as a result of the interpenetrating donor/acceptor network structure.
Introduction
In recent years, photovoltaic solar cells based on semiconducting conjugated polymers have been extensively studied as low cost alternative energy sources.1 Of particular interest are the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures, in which exciton dissociation is facilitated by a large interface area between the electron donor and acceptor, which overcomes the limited length scale (10–20 nm) of exciton diffusion in the conjugated polymer.2–6 Bicontinuous percolation pathways are essential within the bulk heterojunction structures to allow for efficient electron and hole transport to their respective electrodes without significant recombination loss.2–6 Among electron donor–acceptor pairs, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) have gained considerable attention due to their light harvesting and charge transport properties.7 The performances of P3HT:PCBM solar cells have improved, achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 4–5% under AM 1.5G conditions.8–11 However, photovoltaic solar cells fabricated without post-treatments showed low device efficiencies resulting from unoptimized active layer morphologies. In the P3HT:PCBM blend films, the P3HT chain stacking was suppressed by the presence of a fine dispersion of PCBM, and PCBM aggregation was not extensive because PCBM diffusion was hindered by the co-existing P3HT chains.12 Furthermore, the method of spin-coating, a thin film deposition method that is typically used to fabricate large-scale homogeneous films, kinetically disfavors ordered crystalline growth because of the rapid solvent evaporation that takes place during solidification of the thin film.13,14 Therefore, post-treatments such as thermal annealing were found to be necessary to promote recrystallization of P3HT through self-organization of the polymer chains and nanoscale phase separation.5,9–12,15,16
The annealing process controls the morphology of the active layer and enhances the electron and hole mobilities.17 Nevertheless, in most cases, the electron mobility (μe) is higher than the hole mobility (μh), which increases the recombination loss of the charge carriers.17 Furthermore, the nanoscale morphology can deteriorate if the PCBM domains grow beyond the length scale of exciton diffusion, thereby prohibiting efficient charge transfer.18 Thermal annealing at relatively high temperatures also has risks, such as oxidation and degradation of the functional layer.19,20 In addition to thermal treatments, solvent annealing can improve the nanoscale BHJ morphology by promoting polymer self-organization via control over the evaporation rate of the residual solvent.8,21,22 Aside from thermal and solvent annealing processes, annealing-free approaches have been developed. P3HT nanofiber formation is promoted through the cooling of a saturated P3HT solution.23 Mixed solvent approaches allow control over active layer morphologies in blend films.24–26 However, it is difficult to obtain optimized morphologies of P3HT:PCBM blend films through the above mentioned treatments, because P3HT crystallization and phase separation of the two components occur within a single step, and the two processes can, therefore, interfere with each other.5,18 It is difficult to effectively control both P3HT crystallization and PCBM diffusion to ensure both the presence of bicontinuous pathways for charge carriers and an appropriate interface area.5,18,22
In this report, we describe the preparation of a bulk heterojunction structure, formed by a two-step process consisting first of P3HT crystallization, through the addition of the marginal solvent, cyclohexanone (CHN), to the blend solution in chlorobenzene (CB), followed by the nanoscale phase separation achieved through mild thermal annealing. We measured the degree of crystallinity and phase separation in the P3HT:PCBM blend films with thermal annealing temperature. The interpenetrating network structure formed from the in situ self-organized P3HT nanowires in the bulk heterojunctions produced controlled bicontinuous percolation pathways that contributed to the enhanced hole and electron mobilities. We describe the procedure used to achieve these well-controlled bulk heterojunction morphologies formed through primary P3HT crystallization and subsequent thermal annealing to produce nanoscale morphologies for high performance polymer solar cells.
Experimental
Device fabrication
Regioregular P3HT (4002-E) and PCBM ([60]PCBM) were purchased from Rieke Metals Inc. and Nano-C Inc., respectively. Chlorobenzene and cyclohexanone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. All materials and solvents were used without further treatment. The blend solution of P3HT:PCBM (1:1, w/w) was prepared using chlorobenzene at concentrations of 25 mg ml−1, and stirred for 14 h in a glove box. A 500 μl aliquot of cyclohexanone (CHN) was added to 1 ml P3HT:PCBM solution, then stirred for another 2 h. Polymer solar cell devices were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates. The ITO samples were cleaned through sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, ethanol, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, followed by exposure to ozone for 20 min. To supplement this bottom electrode, a hole transport layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P TP AI 4083, Bayer AG) was spin-coated to a thickness of 30–35 nm, dried at 120 °C for 60 min, and then transferred to a N2-filled glove box. The photoactive layer was deposited by spin-coating the prepared P3HT:PCBM blend solution on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, followed by thermal annealing at various temperatures for 5 min. Finally, the metal electrodes of Ca (5 nm) and Al (800 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation under a high vacuum (1 × 10−6 mbar). The photoactive areas of the devices were 0.0575 cm2. The hole-only devices, used to investigate hole transport in P3HT:PCBM blend films, were fabricated as described, except that the top electrode was replaced with palladium (40–50 nm). Electron-only devices were also fabricated by spin-coating the active layer on glass/Al (50 nm) substrates, followed by the deposition of a Ca (5 nm)/Al (50 nm) cathode electrode.
Measurements
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G solar illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with an Oriel 1 KW solar simulator using a Keithley 4200 source measurement unit in a N2-filled glove box. The light intensity was calibrated with respect to the reference silicon solar cell with a KG5 visible filter (PVM 132) certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a photo-modulation spectroscopic setup (model Merin, Oriel) after illuminating the devices with monochromatic light from a xenon lamp. The monochromatic power density was calibrated using a reference silicon photodiode as a standard from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).
Characterization
P3HT:PCBM blend films, characterized by UV-Vis absorption, GIXRD, AFM, and film thickness measurements, were prepared on ITO-glass substrates as described above to allow for an accurate comparison. UV-Vis absorption spectra were acquired using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Varian, CARY-5000). Out-of-plane GIXRD measurements of the P3HT:PCBM blend films were performed at the 3C2, 8C1 and 10C1 beamlines (wavelength approx. 1.54 Å) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. The angle of the incident beam was fixed at 0.18°. Film thicknesses were determined with an ellipsometer (M-2000V, H. A. Woollam Co., Inc.) and corroborated with AFM measurements. The morphologies of the blend films were characterized with AFM (Digital Instruments Multimode) operated in tapping mode with a silicon cantilever, and TEM (Hitachi 7600) was operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 KV. The samples for TEM measurements were prepared as described for the device fabrication, with an active layer thickness of 100 nm. The active layers were floated on a water surface, transferred to the Cu grid, and kept under vacuum overnight.
Results and discussion
To control the morphology of the blend films, two separate steps were applied to the blend solution (2.5 wt%) in CB (Fig. 1). In the first step, CHN was added to the P3HT:PCBM blend solution, and the solution was aged at room temperature for 2 h to allow formation of the ordered precursors, which seeded the growth of P3HT nanowire. CHN is a marginal solvent for P3HT and has a higher boiling point than CB (see ESI,† Table S1), which enables the selective formation of P3HT nanowires through controlled P3HT crystallization from the preformed ordered precursors.23 Addition of a marginal solvent promoted the formation of ordered aggregates, short fibrils, and nanowire structures.24–30 However, in the presence of PCBM, a kinetically systematized approach was required to obtain P3HT nanowires. In a second step, after CHN addition, a subsequent thermal annealing step was performed by heating the films to temperatures between 80 °C and 200 °C for a relatively short time (5 min). This annealing step promoted further crystallization of P3HT and phase separation via PCBM diffusion and aggregation. The morphology of P3HT:PCBM blend films was easily controlled using these two separate steps: P3HT crystallization through addition of a marginal solvent and aggregation of PCBM molecules via diffusion of PCBM under relatively mild thermal annealing conditions. A systematic study of this procedure has demonstrated that the active layer morphology can be finely controlled by minimizing interference between P3HT crystallization and PCBM diffusion, which occurs in the conventional methods that employ a single thermal annealing step. Although P3HT crystallizes faster than PCBM during thermal annealing, the crystallization and diffusion processes of both components influence each other during the single step process.5,18 Mild thermal annealing can be an efficient way to retard the rate of PCBM diffusion, prohibiting PCBM overgrowth and reducing thermal degradation of the active layer morphology.

P3HT nanowires evolved during the aging period of the precursor solution and during spin-coating, and aggregated PCBM domains formed during the thermal annealing step. Red wires represent P3HT nanowires and gray dots represent PCBM domains. 
UV-Vis absorption spectra of the P3HT:PCBM blend solutions, with varying ratios of CB:CHN, were used to monitor the degree of P3HT self-organization, which corresponded to the preformed ordered precursors in the blend solutions (Fig. 2a). The UV-Vis spectra of the blend films represent the degree of P3HT crystalline ordering in the solidified blend films (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2a, the P3HT:PCBM blend solution, thoroughly dissolved in the good solvent CB, contained only one peak at 455 nm corresponding to the dissolved P3HT chains in solution in the absence of molecular ordering.25,30,31 Upon addition of CHN to the blend solution, an absorption peak at 600 nm appeared, and the intensity increased as the proportion of CHN increased, accompanied by a distinctive color change in the blend solution. A high degree of P3HT crystallinity was indicated by a red shift in the absorption band, clear vibronic shoulders appeared at long wavelengths (between 550 and 600 nm) as the enhanced interchain π–π* stacking, and increased absorption intensity.11,25,30–32 During the spin-coating process, P3HT:PCBM solutions with ordered precursors solidified into film structures as the majority of the solvent evaporated from the blend solution. The blend film cast from a mixed solvent showed higher crystallinity than the film cast from a good solvent, which agreed with the results from the solution UV absorption measurements (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2 clearly shows that the crystallinity of the blend films was enhanced by thermal annealing and marginal solvent treatment, and additional applications of thermal annealing associated with marginal solvent treatment allowed the film to crystallize more extensively, as indicated by the increased absorption intensity and the prominent vibronic features. The improved P3HT crystallinity, facilitated through self-organized chain stacking, can enhance not only the hole transport but also the light harvesting capabilities, improving the cell photocurrent.17

The absorption intensity saturated when the P3HT:PCBM blend film was annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. 
The crystallinity of P3HT in the blend films was also evaluated by grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements on the spin-coated blend films. Fig. 3 shows the out-of-plane X-ray diffraction patterns of blend films cast from mixed solvent and annealed at different temperatures, and a comparison is made with the GIXRD measurements from films cast from the good solvent. As shown in the inset in Fig. 3, the relative crystallinity of P3HT in the blend films cast from the mixed solvent was estimated by comparing the relative intensities at a specific position (2θ = 5.4°) corresponding to the (100) axis of the crystallite at various thermal annealing temperatures.18 The relative XRD intensities were evaluated by normalizing each (100) reflection intensity to the maximum (100) intensity measured among the blend films.18 Higher annealing temperatures enhanced the crystallinity through development of more extensive P3HT molecular ordering along the (100) axis. The extent of crystallinity saturated at annealing temperatures above 120 °C. P3HT chains self-organized to construct lamella-like crystallites, as indicated by the (100) reflection, which suggested that the molecular backbones and the side-chains were oriented parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the substrate in an edge-on structure.13,22,33,34 The relative intensity dropped slightly for films subjected to additional annealing at 200 °C, probably due to thermal degradation of the P3HT chains.19,20 The diffraction intensities of the films cast from the mixed solvent were higher than those of the films cast from the good solvent, regardless of the application of an annealing post-treatment. Considering that blend films with similar thickness contain approximately the same number of P3HT chains, it could be inferred that the film fabricated from the good solvent was not sufficiently crystallized, which was far from optimal.18 In contrast, by employing ordered precursors that had been formed in the marginal solvent mixture, the P3HT:PCBM blend film was found to be extensively crystallized and yielded an optimized morphology.
 Fig. 3  Out-of-plane grazing incident X-ray diffraction intensities of P3HT:PCBM blend films cast from CB/CHN and thermally annealed at 80 °C, 100 °C, 150 °C, and 200 °C, respectively, compared with blend films cast from CB, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C. The inset shows the variation in the relative (100) peak intensities of the films cast from the CB/CHN mixed solvent at various annealing temperatures. 
The nanoscale morphologies of the interpenetrating nanowire structures were visualized using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM). Fig. 4 shows typical TM-AFM height and phase images of P3HT nanowire morphologies in P3HT homopolymer films (Fig. 4a) and in P3HT:PCBM blend films (Fig. 4b). The P3HT crystalline nanowires readily formed due to the favorable stacking interactions between the P3HT chains and the unfavorable solvophobic interactions between P3HT chains and their marginal solvent, CHN (Fig. 4a).27,30 P3HT nanowires were also present (Fig. 4b) in the blend film, indicating the in situ formation of self-organized P3HT in the presence of PCBM.

TEM images, shown in Fig. 5, confirmed the morphology of self-organized P3HT nanowire structures in the blend films prepared from the mixed solvent. TEM also provided information on the variation in morphology with annealing temperatures. In these images, P3HT crystallites are indicated as bright structures, and PCBM domains are indicated as relatively dark regions, due to the density differences between P3HT and PCBM (P3HT: 1.1 g cm−3, PCBM: 1.5 g cm−3).5,18,26 In Fig. 5, the widths of the interpenetrating P3HT nanowires, which contribute to hole transport, were measured to be up to 20 nm, which matches the exciton diffusion length required for efficient exciton dissociation by charge transfer.4–7 The P3HT nanowires formed through the addition of a marginal solvent (Fig. 5a), and the density of the nanowires intensified at higher annealing temperatures (Fig. 5b–e). However, the relative degree of crystallinity increased with increasing annealing temperatures and leveled off, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3, because P3HT crystallites exist not only as nanowires, but as small nanocrystals which seemed to degrade upon annealing at 200 °C.19,20 The structure of P3HT in the blend films included crystalline nanowires, nanocrystals, and amorphous regions.18,35 During the annealing step, PCBM diffused and aggregated to form de-mixed domains, which organized the percolation pathways for electron transport. The PCBM domains grew with increasing annealing temperature as a result of the accelerated rate of PCBM diffusion (Fig. 5b–e).18 In the absence of thermal treatment, P3HT and PCBM were homogeneously intermixed (Fig. 5f). PCBM domains were not found to be well-organized solely through treatment with either marginal solvent or thermal annealing. The marginal solvent did not yield clearly distinguished nanoscale phase separation, although the interpenetrating P3HT nanowire structure was readily visualized. The marginal solvent, CHN, has more solubility for PCBM than for P3HT and a slightly lower vapor pressure than the main solvent, CB (see ESI,† Table S1), which was unable to yield nanoscale phase separation alone (Fig. 5a). The PCBM domains present in the annealed blend films cast from the good solvent, in contrast with the PCBM domains present in the blend films cast from the mixed solvent, were not well-organized at mild annealing temperatures of 80 °C and 100 °C (Fig. 5g and h), but they did form at annealing temperatures of 150 °C and 200 °C (Fig. 5i and j). The primary formation of P3HT nanowires from the ordered precursors in the mixed solvent allowed the PCBM molecules to freely migrate under relatively mild conditions, at thermal annealing temperatures as low as 80 °C, because the number of P3HT chains interspersed among the PCBM molecules was reduced (Fig. 5b and c).36 Such mild annealing conditions yielded relatively small and evenly distributed PCBM domains due to the low rate of PCBM diffusion.18 These PCBM domain properties not only produced extensive percolation pathways, but yielded an interface area for efficient charge separation. Therefore, the addition of CHN and subsequent mild thermal annealing permitted fine-tuning of the morphology of the interpenetrating nanowire, with evenly distributed PCBM domains, for the formation of bicontinuous percolation pathways and a large interface area between the P3HT and PCBM components.

Solar cells were fabricated using P3HT:PCBM active layers spin-cast from either the mixed or the good solvent. The performances and characteristics of these devices, with the temperatures of an additional annealing step, were measured and compared. The device properties are summarized in Table 1. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices and the corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are shown in Fig. 6a and b. The device fabricated from the good solvent without thermal annealing post-treatment showed a relatively poor performance of 0.79% PCE. After thermal annealing, the device performance was enhanced to a PCE value of 3.15%, due to the presence of increased crystallinity and phase separation. Without thermal annealing, the device performance reached a PCE of 3.02% through the addition of the marginal solvent, CHN, to the main solvent, CB, and the resulting PCE was comparable with that of the thermally annealed device fabricated from the good solvent. Upon mild thermal annealing at 80 °C and 100 °C, the blend films fabricated from the mixed solvent showed not only increased P3HT crystallinity but also PCBM domains, as shown in the TEM images (Fig. 5). Therefore, the device efficiencies were enhanced, yielding PCEs of 3.76% upon annealing at 80 °C, and 4.04% upon annealing at 100 °C. The IPCE spectra of the devices, shown in Fig. 6b, confirmed the increase in short-circuit current (Jsc), as indicated by the magnitude and broadened lineshape of the IPCE curves. The IPCE curves of devices formed from films that had been spin-cast from the mixed solvent displayed more broad plateau regions than devices formed from films that had been spin-cast from the good solvent, and the IPCE lineshape was consistent across all mixed solvent devices, with the exception of the device formed using a film that had been subjected to an additional annealing step at 200 °C. In particular, the red shift of the IPCE spectra, which agreed well with the red shift observed in the UV-Vis absorption spectra for the blend films, was interpreted as arising from the enhanced P3HT crystallinity and the resulting improved hole mobility, which will be discussed later.17

 Fig. 6  (a) Current density–voltage (J–V) curves, measured under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (simulated AM 1.5G), (b) incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the P3HT:PCBM solar cells, and experimental dark current densities measured (c) in the hole-only device, and (d) in the electron-only device configurations. The active layers of the blend films were fabricated from CB/CHN: as-cast (■), and thermally annealed at different temperatures, 80 °C (□), 100 °C (△), 150 °C (▽), and 200 °C (☆). The results are compared with those from CB: as-cast (●), and thermally annealed at 150 °C (○). Active layers of P3HT:PCBM films fabricated from CB had a thickness of 150 nm, those from CB/CHN had a thickness of 290–300 nm, and both of the thicknesses yielded optimal device performances. 
In contrast with the trends observed for films subjected to mild thermal annealing, annealing temperatures above 150 °C reduced device performances to 2.95% at an annealing temperature of 150 °C, which deteriorated further to 1.66% at an annealing temperature of 200 °C. The magnitudes of the IPCE results were also reduced, consistent with the observed decrease in current density of the devices. Furthermore, in the case of the device subjected to annealing at 200 °C, deterioration in the lineshape of the IPCE curve was observed, most likely due to the thermal decomposition of the P3HT crystalline structure, as shown by XRD (Fig. 3). We conjecture that annealing at relatively high temperatures accelerated the diffusion of the PCBM molecules and promoted the formation of PCBM aggregates, as shown in the TEM images (Fig. 5e).18 Thus, diminished device performances, as measured by the Jsc and fill factor (FF), were ascribed to the presence of overgrown PCBM domains, which acted as a defect and inhibited balanced charge transport.18 The degraded P3HT crystalline structure and overgrown PCBM domains, which were far larger than the exciton diffusion length (Fig. 5), reduced the interface area between the electron donor and acceptor components. The device parameters, therefore, were negatively impacted by annealing at high temperatures.
A drop in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) occurred for all devices after thermal annealing and marginal solvent treatment. Although the origin of Voc is still the subject of debate, it is widely accepted that the Voc for P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction solar cells is determined by the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the electron donor, P3HT, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the electron acceptor, PCBM.37 P3HT crystallization in the process of marginal solvent treatment and thermal annealing reduced the band gap in P3HT, assuming that the HOMO level of P3HT shifted upward due to the extension of the conjugation length as a result of interchain overlap, as indicated in the UV-Vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. 2.38,39 Therefore, the devices containing the P3HT:PCBM films with higher crystallinity resulting from the marginal solvent treatment and thermal annealing, showed lower Voc than the devices with films which have lower crystallinity.
The space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method was employed to evaluate the hole and electron mobilities of devices prepared with the various thin film active layers.40,41 Dark current densities (JD) were multiplied by the cube of the film thickness (L) to account for variation in the blend film thickness in hole-only devices (Fig. 6c) and electron-only devices (Fig. 6d). The hole and electron mobilities of blend films cast from the mixed solvent and subject to thermal annealing are shown, and the results are compared with the mobilities of devices fabricated from the good solvent (Table 2). Highly ordered π–π* conjugation, as described above (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), is known to improve the charge carrier mobility in blend films.5,8,17,42 To obtain efficient charge transport of the carriers, it is necessary to enhance the hole and electron mobilities to achieve a balanced mobility ratio.17,43 SCLC J–V characteristics were obtained in the dark from the hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Pd) and electron-only devices (Al/P3HT:PCBM/Al) as a function of the applied bias, which was corrected for the built-in potential: V = Vapplied − Vbi.17 The hole and electron mobilities were estimated by the dark J–V curves at low voltages, where the current is described by the Mott–Gurney square law: J = (9/8)ε0εrμ(V2/L3).44 Here, ε0εr is the permittivity of the polymer, μ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the film thickness. Through the process of nanowire formation, the hole mobility increased to 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, three orders of magnitude higher than the mobility of 2.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 in films cast from the good solvent, and one order of magnitude higher than the mobility measured in films subjected to thermal annealing, which showed a mobility of 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The hole mobility achieved by thermal annealing at 80 °C, 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, was nearly equal to the value of the film cast from the mixed solvent. Increases in the annealing temperatures above 150 °C decreased this mobility due to P3HT thermal degradation and non-optimal phase separation. The electron mobility was also enhanced by a factor of ten, to 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, during the process of nanowire formation, but this mobility was less than the mobility measured in devices fabricated from a good solvent with conventional thermal annealing at 150 °C, because the PCBM domains were not well developed. The electron mobility was optimized to 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, via the process of mild thermal annealing. In summary, the application of CHN treatment and mild thermal annealing maximized the hole and electron mobilities to 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The ratio between the electron and hole mobilities approached unity (μe/μh: 0.8–1.1), resulting in highly balanced carrier transport. The well-controlled morphology, obtained from marginal solvent treatment and thermal annealing, increased the carrier mobilities, particularly the hole mobility, through the development of P3HT nanowires, led to balanced charge transport in the active layer, and enhanced the photocurrent and FF.17,43 The hole mobility in devices fabricated from a good solvent, with subsequent thermal annealing, was insufficient to ensure efficient charge transport, and the hole and electron mobilities were less balanced than those measured for films cast from the mixed solvent with thermal annealing.

The J–V performances of the solar cells fabricated with thicker active layer films were enhanced, potentially through the formation of bicontinuous percolation pathways formed in the processes of marginal solvent treatment and thermal annealing, as suggested in Fig. 7a. The active layers were fabricated from the mixed solvent and annealed at 100 °C, according to the procedure described for producing optimized device efficiency, and the thickness was varied from 120 nm to 290 nm. For all film thicknesses, the lineshape of the J–V curve was maintained for the blend films cast from the mixed solvent (Fig. 7a). As a consequence of the controlled morphology, the photocurrent density increased from 8.60 to 10.9 mA cm−2, and the FF remained constant at 60%, with increasing active layer thickness, which implies that the carrier transport was unchanged with increasing active layer thickness. Therefore, the overall efficiency was enhanced from 2.85% to 4.04%. The enhanced hole and electron mobilities, which arose from the interpenetrating network structure, contributed to the charge transport and enabled the thick active layers to generate substantial photocurrent without significant recombination loss.6 In addition, P3HT nanowire structures contributed to the light absorption process due to the enhanced P3HT crystallinity.17 In contrast with the steady photovoltaic performances observed in films formed using the marginal solvent treatment, the photovoltaic performances of devices prepared from the good solvent with thermal annealing at 150 °C diminished with increasing film thicknesses (Fig. 7b); both Jsc and FF decreased with increasing active layer thickness. It is probable that the carrier percolation pathways could not be controlled in a single thermal annealing step because P3HT crystallization and phase separation occurred simultaneously.
 Fig. 7  Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the P3HT:PCBM solar cells with various film thicknesses. The active layers were fabricated (a) from the mixed solvent, CB/CHN, with thermal annealing at 100 °C, and (b) from good solvent, CB, with thermal annealing at 150 °C. J–V characteristics were measured under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (simulated AM 1.5G). 
In this study, we have presented a fabrication process for achieving an optimal active layer morphology through marginal solvent treatment and subsequent mild thermal annealing. Together, these two steps enhanced the charge transport and light absorption properties of the active layer films and improved device performances of polymer solar cells. P3HT crystallization was primarily initiated through the formation of nanowires using a marginal solvent, and the subsequent morphological changes, induced by mild thermal annealing, further crystallized P3HT and produced nanoscale phase separation. Through this two-step process, hole and electron percolation pathways became well-organized, with a compatible interface between the electron donor and acceptor components. We note that the dual process approach may be extended to other electron donor–acceptor pairs to yield high performance polymer solar cells. Although a systematic optimization of the active layer thickness, blend ratio, and annealing conditions remains, the dual process described here, which enables fine control over the nanoscale film morphology in blended films, constitutes a step forward for the commercialization of polymer solar cells.
Conclusions
The in situ formation of an interpenetrating P3HT nanowire morphology in bulk heterojunctions was obtained through the application of the dual process of marginal solvent treatment and subsequent mild thermal annealing. The separation of these two steps effectively reduced the interference between P3HT crystallization and phase separation. In the dual process, P3HT crystallization was primarily initiated in the first step, and nanoscale PCBM domains subsequently developed in the second step, to produce bicontinuous percolation pathways while maintaining a large interface area between the P3HT and PCBM components. Crystallization of P3HT was significantly enhanced by spin-casting from the mixed solvent. The nanoscale morphology of the active layer produced from the CB/CHN mixture with mild thermal annealing was well-organized, with interpenetrating P3HT nanowires and small evenly distributed PCBM domains. This was in contrast with the morphology produced by spin-casting from pure CB. The improved P3HT crystallinity and nanoscale morphology yielded PCEs as high as 4.04%, with a photocurrent density of 10.9 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 62.1%. The hole and electron mobilities resulting from the hole and electron percolation pathways increased to 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a balanced ratio of μe/μh = 0.8–1.1, which enhanced charge transport. The enhanced hole and electron mobilities enabled active layers as thick as 300 nm to generate enhanced photocurrents. Photovoltaic performances of the devices fabricated from the mixed solvent improved with the increasing thickness of the active layer, in contrast with the reduced device performances obtained from the good solvent. The two steps consisting of seeded P3HT growth and subsequent thermal annealing produced well-controlled blend morphologies in the active layers, yielding high performance polymer solar cells.
