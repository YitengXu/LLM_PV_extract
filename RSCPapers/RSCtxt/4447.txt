    , Accepted 23rd September 2019First published on 23rd September 2019AbstractDouble-anchored phenothiazine-cored sensitizers (YL1–YL4) having a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) entity as the N-substituent with various π-spacers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, 4-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene, and 4-heptyl-4-hexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene) are prepared for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The YL4-based DSSC exhibits the best solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of up to 9.79% and 10.87%, respectively, without and with the CDCA co-adsorbent. These values outperform the efficiencies of cells based on N719 (8.77%) and our previous outstanding double-anchored phenothiazine-cored dye (HL5, 8.53%). YL dyes possess double layered shelters for efficient blockade of dark current: the inner shelter from the dianchor skeleton and the outer shelter from clogged TPE units. Clogged TPEs also strengthen dye stability on the TiO2 surface. Under room light illumination (Philips T5 lamp), the YL4-based DSSC device exhibited high cell efficiencies of 27.54%, 26.81%, and 24.98% at 187 lux, 597 lux, and 1025 lux, respectively, showing great potential towards the Internet of Things (IoTs).
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been playing an important role in third-generation solar cells, and the best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of cells based on single ruthenium dye, zinc porphyrin dye and metal-free organic dyes have reached 11.5% (ref. 1) 13.0% (ref. 2) and 13.6%,3 respectively. Even higher efficiencies were reported for metal-free organic dyes based on a co-dyed single cell (14.3%)4 or a tandem cell (14.64%),5 using cobalt-based redox mediators. These efficiencies are very close to the threshold value required for commercialization (15%).6 Among the developed sensitizers (ruthenium, porphyrin, metal free dyes etc.), metal-free organic dyes have higher flexibility in molecular design, which may lead to a lower cost. In addition to higher PCEs, temporal stability is also of paramount importance for commercialization of DSSCs. Consequently, attention was also paid to stabilization of dyes against leaching from the photoanode (typically TiO2). Common strategies include TiO2 passivation4 and use of robust anchors in sensitizers.7 To this end, multi-anchoring dyes receive considerable interest.8,9 Potential benefits of these dyes include enhanced optical properties such as broader and red-shifted absorption, higher molar extinction coefficients, improved dark current suppression and stronger affinity to photoanodes.
Recently we developed a series of di-anchored organic sensitizers with good cell performance.10–12 Compared with mono-anchored congeners, they indeed not only more efficiently suppressed dark current, but also provided more electron injection pathways. We also found that the substituents at the nitrogen atom of phenothiazine-cored dyes of the (D(–π–A)2) (D = phenothiazine) type have profound influence on the device performance,10–12 such as light harvesting, dye aggregation and dark current suppression. Our preliminary results indicated that di-anchored dyes were more robust against leaching by KOH solution11 compared with mono-anchored dyes. We therefore continued the search for alternate N-substituents, which could retain the eugenic nature of these phenothiazine-cored di-anchored dyes and further improve the cell performance. In this regard, the tetraphenylethylene (TPE) entity, widely used for construction of organic light-emitting molecules,13–15 caught our attention. Light-emitting molecules incorporating TPE entities frequently have more intense emission in the solid state than in solution, i.e., aggregation-induced emission (AIE) or aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE), due to effective suppression of direct π–π stacking interactions and restriction of intramolecular rotation leading to non-radiative recombination.
We envisage that the incorporation of a twisted TPE entity at the nitrogen atom of phenothiazine-cored di-anchored dyes will disfavor π–π type aggregation, which frequently deteriorates electron injection of the photo-excited dyes. Besides, the possible mutual clogging of propeller-like TPE units from neighboring dye molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface could form an additional shelter to block the oxidized electrolytes from approaching the TiO2 surface and alleviate dark current. In addition, the embracing dye molecules via TPE-clogging may adhere more firmly to the surface of TiO2. Scheme 1 illustrates the double layered shelter concept of blockade of the oxidized electrolytes from approaching the TiO2 surface: (1) the double anchoring groups form the inner shelter to block the electrolytes nearby the TiO2 surface;10–12,16 (2) the clogged TPE entities form the outer shelter to block the electrolytes distal to the TiO2 surface. Herein we report new phenothiazine-cored di-anchored sensitizers having a TPE unit as the N-substituent of phenothiazine (YL1–YL4) and different π-spacers, as shown in Fig. 1a. DSSCs fabricated with these dyes achieved high efficiencies. To investigate the role of the TPE substituent, three congeners, YL5 (Fig. 1a), DCE4 (Fig. 1b),10–12,16 and HL5 (Fig. 1b)12 which have N-(triphenylethylene), N-(phenyl), and N-(2,6-bis(n-hexyloxy)phenyl) substituents at the phenothiazine core, respectively, were used for comparison.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of YL dyes

Scheme 2 shows synthetic routes of the new dyes (YL1–YL5). To ensure selective bromination at the 3 and 7 positions of phenothiazine for subsequent construction of conjugated bridges and anchoring groups, 3,7-dibromo-10H-phenothiazine17 was chosen as a starting material. Incorporation of the TPE entity at the nitrogen atom of phenothiazine was not successful via the direct palladium catalysed C–N coupling reaction between 3,7-dibromo-10H-phenothiazine and 1-bromo-4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)benzene. A two-step synthesis was adopted: (i) a nucleophilic substitution reaction between 3,7-dibromo-10H-phenothiazine and (4-fluorophenyl)(phenyl)methanone to provide 1; (ii) a condensation reaction of the ketone entity of 1 with diphenylmethane to form 2.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic routes of YL dyes. (i) 3,7-Dibromo-10H-phenothiazine, (4-fluorophenyl) (phenyl)methanone, t-BuOK, THF, 80 °C for 16 h. (ii) Diphenylmethane, n-butyllithium, THF, −78 °C, 12 h. p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, toluene, 110 °C for 3 h. (iii) Benzylmagnesium chloride, THF, 0 °C, 13 h. p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, toluene, 110 °C for 3 h. (iv) Tributyl(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)stannane, Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, 110 °C for 16 h. (v) POCl3, DMF, 60 °C, 18 h. (vi) Cyanoacetic acid, NH4OAc, AcOH, 120 °C. 
For comparison, the congener of YL2, YL5, which has triphenylethylene as the N-substituent of the phenothiazine core, was also synthesized via the condensation reaction of 1 with phenylmagnesium chloride to form 5. Compounds 2 and 5 then underwent a palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction18 using stannyl reagents without a protected formyl group (1,3-dioxolane) to afford 3, 4, and 6 or with 1,3-dioxolane to afford YL1al and YL2al. Formylation of 3, 4, and 6 was conducted using the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction to afford YL3al, YL4al and YL5al. Lastly, Knoevenagel condensation of the aldehyde with cyanoacetic acid provided the desired compounds, YL1–YL5.
Photo-physical properties
The UV/Vis absorption spectra of YL dyes (Fig. 2a, in THF) exhibited two major absorption bands at 350–420 nm attributed to the π–π* transition and at 420–650 nm corresponding to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor moiety. The absorption features are similar to those of our previously developed phenothiazine-based di-anchored dyes.10–12 All YL dyes are weakly emissive (Fig. S1a†), and the trend of the emission wavelength is parallel to that of the absorption, and all the corresponding photophysical data of YL dyes are listed in Table 1. Among the dyes having the same phenothiazine-based π-skeleton as YL2 with different N-substituents, the λabs values of the ICT bands for HL3,11DCE4,13DCE3,13YL5, YL2, HL512 and HL712 are 475 nm, 477 nm, 488 nm, 495 nm, 496 nm, 516 nm and 518 nm, respectively. Similar λabs values for HL3 and DCE4 indicate that the overall resonance/inductive effect of Ph is similar to the inductive effect of 2-ethylhexyl. From DCE4 to DCE3, there is a red shift of the absorption by ∼10 nm due to the slight resonance effect of the 4-hexyloxy group. Similar to DCE3, the two ortho-alkoxy substituents at the N-phenyl of HL5 and HL7 exhibit resonance contribution, leading to ∼40 nm red shift of the absorption spectra compared to DCE4. Likewise, for DCE12 and HL11 dyes, there is a large twist angle (81.5–83.9°, see computation) between N-linked phenyl and phenothiazine in YL dyes. However, incorporation of more conjugated phenyl rings into N-linked phenyl, i.e., YL2 or YL5, leads to a red shift (∼18 nm) and higher intensity of the ICT band.

On the other hand, extending the effective conjugation length of π-spacers (YL2–YL4) resulted in (1) red-shifted λabs of the π–π* transition band, (2) broader absorption edge of the ICT band (Fig. 2a), and (3) increased ε of the ICT band. YL4 has the broadest ICT absorption range extending to 610 nm and the highest molar extinction coefficient because of the rigidified and longest π-spacer, 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene entity.
Existence of J-aggregation of YL dyes on TiO2 is evident based on two observations: (1) compared with the solution spectrum (Fig. 2a), the absorption width at the half maximum of the YL dye/TiO2 thin film spectrum (Fig. 2b) is significantly increased; (2) there is prominent spectral broadening of the YL dye/TiO2 thin film spectrum in the long-wavelength region. The blue shift of the film λonset upon addition of the co-adsorbent (chenodeoxycholic acid, CDCA) provides additional evidence of J-aggregation of the dyes (Fig. S2†).
Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammograms of all YL dyes (Fig. S1b†) exhibited a reversible redox peak at about 1 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), attributable to the oxidation of the phenothiazine core.10–12 As expected, inserting extra electron-rich thiophene rings between phenothiazine and acceptors results in a cathodic shift of the oxidation potential,10–12,19i.e., YL3 and YL4vs.YL1, YL2, and YL5 (Table 1). There exists a second reversible wave in YL4. Obviously, the more planarized and delocalized skeleton of YL4 helps with stabilization of the higher oxidation state. The first oxidation potentials (Eox) of YL dyes (0.97 to 1.07 V vs. NHE) are all more positive than the redox potential of the iodide/triiodide electrolyte (+0.4 V vs. NHE),20 indicating the suitable energy staircase for dye regeneration. The excited-state potentials  of YL dyes (−1.07 to −1.22 V vs. NHE), calculated from the difference between the first Eox at the ground-state and the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0), are more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 semiconductor (−0.5 V vs. NHE),21 implying thermodynamically favored electron injection from the excited dye molecule to TiO2.

Theoretical computation
Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations of YL dyes were performed at the B3LYP/6-311G* level via the Gaussian 09 program package.22 The frontier orbitals of the compounds (Fig. 3) and their corresponding energy states are shown in Fig. S3.† The HOMO of the compounds mainly distributes from the phenothiazine entity to the conjugated spacers and only the phenyl entity directly connected to the nitrogen atom of phenothiazine has small contribution. The LUMO and LUMO+1 levels, having similar energies, mainly distribute from the acceptor to the π-spacer. The S0 → S1 transition of YL dyes is mainly from the HOMO to LUMO (Table S1†), indicating a charge transfer character of the transition. The ground-state dihedral angles between two neighboring segments of YL dyes are shown in Fig. S4.† Similar to the congeners with N-(2,6-bis(n-hexyloxy)phenyl) (HL5), there is a large dihedral angle (∼80°) between the TPE entity (YL1–YL4) or the triphenylethylene (YL5) moiety and phenothiazine. The twist angle between phenothiazine and neighboring thiophene is ∼30° for all dyes. The twist angle between the two neighboring thiophene rings in YL3 is also ∼30°. The near co-planarity of cyclopentadithiophene moieties with phenothiazine for YL4 is consistent with its most red-shifted and intense ICT band (vide supra). Based on the calculated Mulliken charge23,24 differences between the ground and excited states for selected segments in YL dyes (Fig. S5†), positive charges were found to locate on phenothiazine and the N-substituent (TPE or triphenylethylene), consistent with their donating character. In comparison, negative charges distributed mainly on both sides of π-spacers and anchors, implying double electron injection channels. The Mulliken charge calculation data are compiled in Table S2.†
Photovoltaic performance of the cells with YL dyes
The photocurrent density–voltage curves (Fig. 4a) and IPCE plots (Fig. 4b) of the DSSCs with YL dyes were constructed under simulated AM 1.5G illumination using I−/I3− as the redox mediator; the DSSCs with the congeners, DCE412 and HL5,11 were also fabricated for comparison. The DSSC performance data based on 10 cells are listed in Table 2; the corresponding statistical data are presented in Fig. S6.† It is worth noting that the dye loading amount of YL dyes (1.2–9.1 × 10−8 mol cm−2) is significantly lower in THF, compared to the dye loading amount (1.2–3.6 × 10−7 mol cm−2, Table 2) when using the ternary solvent system (DMSO/CH3CN/t-BuOH). In higher solubility solvent, stably solvated dyes will form and are more difficult to adsorb onto the TiO2 surface.25,26 Thus the YL dyes tend to be well distributed in THF rather than on the heterogeneous TiO2 solid phase, that is, the partition coefficient for the THF/TiO2 bi-phase is higher than that for the ternary solvent/TiO2 bi-phase. As a result, the ternary solvent system is obviously beneficial for higher dye loading of YL. Due to steric congestion of the TPE entity, YL dyes have a somewhat lower dye loading compared with DCE4 and HL5. YL1 and YL5 have a higher dye loading among the YL dyes, possibly due to their less steric congestion: the absence of hexyl chains in the former and removal of one phenyl ring from TPE in the latter. The higher dye loading does not lead to a better PCE; however (vide infra), YL2 exhibited higher VOC, JSC, and PCE (N-TPE) compared to YL5 (N-(triphenylethylene)) and DCE4 (N-phenyl). The best light harvesting (Fig. 2a and b) and most efficient dark current suppression (vide infra) of YL2 (4 phenyls) obviously result in its highest JSC and VOC values compared to YL5 (3 phenyls) and DCE4 (1 phenyl). In comparison, the worst light harvesting and least efficient dark current suppression (vide infra) of DCE4 lead to its smallest JSC and VOC values. YL2 and YL5 have similar dark current suppression efficiencies and therefore similar VOC values. Based on the IPCE spectra (Fig. 4b), DCE4 exhibits lower efficiencies throughout the whole spectral range, which suggests that it has inferior electron injection compared with YL2.

It is worth noting that the YL2-based DSSC (8.81%) exhibits slightly better JSC and PCE values than our previous HL5-based DSSC (8.53%), even though the latter has better light harvesting in solution (vide supra). From the IPCE plots (Fig. 4b), better photon-to-electricity conversion of the YL2-based device in the longer wavelength region is obvious. The TPE substituent certainly plays an important role in better cell performance of YL2 than HL5. We first checked the film spectra of the two dyes. Similar to the solution spectra, the film spectrum of HL5 was broader in the longer wavelength region compared with YL2 (Fig. 2b). The film spectra were also checked with addition of the CDCA co-adsorbent. From 0 to 5 mM of CDCA, the YL2/TiO2 film (Fig. S2b†) exhibited a significant blue shift of the spectrum, and the spectrum showed a further blue shift from 5 to 10 mM of CDCA. In comparison, the HL5/TiO2 (Fig. S2g†) film exhibited an obvious blue shift of the spectrum, but only a very slight blue shift from 5 to 10 mM of CDCA. Based on similar dye loading amounts of YL2 and HL5, the above observations suggest that clogging of the TPE entity in YL2 brings closer the neighboring YL2 molecules to form J-aggregates, and the gained light harvesting in the longer wavelength contributes to the photocurrent significantly. A similar phenomenon was reported by us for dithienobenzotriazole-based dyes.27 In contrast to HL5, dye aggregation still existed for YL2 after 5 mM of CDCA. This implies that more void spaces are available for CDCA in aggregated YL2 with clogged TPE (vide infra). It is worth noting that YL2 showed a better temporal stability than HL5 when the dye-adsorbed TiO2 film was soaked in the dye-leaching base solution (Fig. S7†). Possibly, clogging of the TPE entity in YL2 also plays an important role. Less dye leaching of YL2 may also lead to a better cell performance.
Despite higher dye loading, YL1 has a significantly lower PCE than YL2 (7.28% vs. 8.81%). The better light harvesting (Fig. 2) ability of YL2 certainly plays an important role in achieving its higher JSC value. The higher VOC value of YL2, benefitting from its smaller dark current (Fig. 4a) and better dark current suppression (see electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis, vide infra), should also be important. The presence of a portion of the dangling (non-adsorbed) YL1 dye without contributing to electron injection cannot be ruled out, however. Dangling dyes may also be present for the YL5 dye.
The extending conjugation length of the π-spacer (YL2–YL4) not only increases the JSC value due to better light harvesting (broader and more intense absorption, vide supra), but also increases the VOC value due to more effective dark current suppression. The YL4-based DSSC has the best cell efficiency of 9.79% due to its higher VOC and JSC values. This value surpasses those of the HL5-based (8.53%) and N719-based (8.77%, Fig. S8a†) DSSCs fabricated and measured under the same conditions. The higher cell performance of YL4 than HL5 can be rationalized by two reasons: (1) better light harvesting due to extension of the conjugation by replacing thiophene with 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene entity; (2) better dark current suppression due to the presence of the N-(TPE) substituent (vide infra, see electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and four hexyl groups.28–31 Further, with 10 mM of CDCA as the co-adsorbent, the efficiency of the YL4-based DSSC was increased to 10.87% (Fig. S8b†). To our knowledge, DSSCs using metal-free dyes and the iodide/triiodide redox mediator with PCEs surpassing 10% are very rare,28,32–34 and 10.87% represents the best PCE until now. The co-adsorbent is capable of suppressing dye aggregation and passivating the TiO2 surface, i.e., inhibiting dark current.35 However, the co-adsorbent can also compete with dye molecules for the adsorption site of TiO2 and adversely affect the photocurrent. Very significant improvement of the JSC value (>1 mA cm−2) and a small drop in dye loading (∼5% drop) even with 10 mM of CDCA for dye soaking implies that CDCA tends to occupy the void space of the adsorbed dyes instead of kicking off the dyes. Due to the longer conjugated spacer in YL4, more room under the clogged TPE shelter is expected for accommodation of CDCA without sacrificing dye loading.
For both YL2 and HL5, the efficiencies drop upon adding CDCA, and the HL5 dye has a larger decrement (HL5: 20%; YL2: 12%). In comparison, HL5 has a larger decrement in dye loading than YL2 (HL5: 45%; YL2: 11%). This further evidences that the sheltered space under the clogged TPE entity in YL2 helps with accommodation of CDCA without sacrificing dye loading. The clogged TPE substituents can also help with blockading the distal redox mediator from moving close to the TiO2 surface.
We also tried to introduce a cobalt redox mediator (tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) (bi/tri)-fluoromethanesulfonimide salt, Co-phen2+/Co-phen3+)12 into our best cell (YL4 with 10 mM CDCA), because the cobalt redox mediator generally provides more positive redox potential and therefore better cell performance. However, the cell performance of YL4 with 10 mM CDCA was poor (∼2%, Fig. S9†). Possibly, the double-layered shelter in YL dyes restricts diffusion of the bulky cobalt redox mediator and hampers effective dye regeneration.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was employed to investigate the interfacial charge transfer kinetics of DSSCs36 under dark conditions at an applied bias of −0.65 V. The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the dye-adsorbed TiO2/electrolyte interface was obtained from the diameter of the semicircle shown in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 4c) of the DSSCs. The larger Rrec directly points out a smaller dark current and therefore the better performance of dye with dark current suppression. The Rrec values (Table 2) for YL4, YL3, YL2, HL5, YL5 and DCE4 and YL1 are 560 ohm, 215.9 ohm, 175.8 ohm, 171.6 ohm, 161.4 ohm, 116.7 ohm and 104.6 ohm, respectively. A larger Rrec value indicates a smaller dark current. Long chain alkyl groups (hexyl) evidently alleviate charge recombination (dark current), which would increase the VOC value, for instance, YL1 (VOC = 0.71 V) vs.YL2 (VOC = 0.74 V). The slightly higher Rrec value of YL2 than HL5 suggests that the TPE entity could more effectively suppress the charge recombination compared with the N-(2,6-bis(n-hexyloxy)phenyl) entity. Dyes with a longer conjugated π-spacer (YL2–YL4) or higher number of phenyl entities on the N-substituent of phenothiazine (DCE4: 1 phenyl; YL5: 3 phenyls; YL4: 4 phenyls) could more effectively suppress charge recombination. A significantly larger Rrec value of YL4 than HL5 points out that the four hexyl chains in the spacer played a very important role in dark current suppression, as evidenced by the higher VOC value of YL4 (0.78 V) than HL5 (0.73 V). The larger Rrec value of YL3 (215.9 ohm) than HL5 (171.6 ohm) is in support of the shelter effect of the clogged TPE (vide supra) in YL3. Electron recombination lifetime (τr) was estimated from the Bode phase plot (Fig. 4d) via τr = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the maximum frequency. The order of the lifetime is in agreement with the charge recombination: the longer lifetime means less charge recombination.
DSSCs perform well in ambient light and are promising for indoor applications such as powering portable electronics (sensors, wireless transmitters, etc.) used in the Internet of Things (IoTs).37–39 In recent years, DSSCs for indoor applications attract more attention; however, reports in this aspect are still limited so far.40–48 Considering the good performance of YL2–YL4 dyes and their good spectral coverage with the T5 fluorescent lamp (Fig. S10†), the cells using YL2–YL4 and YL4 with 10 mM of CDCA were tested under T5 illumination at three different illuminances (187, 597, and 1025 lux), which is close to living room, reading room and supermarket situations, respectively. The cell performance data are listed in Table 3, and the J–V plots are shown in Fig. 5. The corresponding statistical data are presented in Fig. S11.† The DSSCs with YL2–YL4 dyes showed better cell efficiencies than those under 1 sun illumination (Table 2) owing to good spectral match with the T5 lamp and effective electron injection (good Jsc) under dim light conditions. Similar to the results obtained at 1 sun, YL4 (4-heptyl-4-hexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene) still exhibited higher VOC, JSC, and FF compared to YL3 (4-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene) and YL2 (3-hexylthiophene). When the light illuminance decreased from 1025 to 597 lux, the cell efficiencies of YL2–YL4 all increased due to the good maintenances of VOC and FF. When the light illuminances further decreased to 187 lux, the cell efficiencies of YL2–YL4 remained at 15.6–22.0% due to the severe VOC and FF drops. With addition of 10 mM of CDCA to YL4, the cell reached surprisingly high efficiencies of 27.54% at 187 lux, 26.81% at 597 lux, and 24.98% at 1025 lux. To our knowledge, these values are very competitive with the best DSSC performance at ∼0.01 sun and below 0.01 sun irradiance.40,42,46,48

J–V curves of the DSSCs using YL2–YL4 and YL4 with 10 mM of CDCA, measured using T5 fluorescent light at (a) 187, (b) 597, and (c) 1025 illuminance (lux). 
Conclusions
The newly developed YL series of sensitizers by the incorporation of a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) entity at the nitrogen atom of phenothiazine-cored double-anchored dyes not only enhanced the light harvesting but also formed double layered shelters for effective blockade of the oxidized electrolytes from approaching the TiO2 surface. The YL4-based DSSC device exhibits a best solar cell efficiency of 9.79% under simulated AM 1.5G illumination, surpassing that of the N719-based standard DSSC (8.77%). Upon addition of the CDCA co-adsorbent, the efficiency further increased to 10.87%, which is the best efficiency in the family of metal-free dye-based DSSCs using iodide/triiodide as the redox mediator. Additionally, under dim light conditions using a Philips T5 lamp, the YL4-based DSSC exhibited remarkable efficiencies of 27.54%, 26.81%, and 24.98% at 187 lux, 597 lux, and 1025 lux, respectively.
