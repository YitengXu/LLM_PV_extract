    , Accepted 24th January 2023First published on 27th January 2023AbstractState-of-the-art first-principles calculations are performed to investigate the thermoelectric transport properties in thallium-based fluoride perovskites TlXF3 (X = Hg, Sn, Pb) by considering anharmonic renormalization of the phonon energy and capturing reasonable electron relaxation times. The lattice thermal conductivity, κL, of the three compounds is very low, among which TlPbF3 is only 0.42 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K, which is less than half of that of quartz glass. The low acoustic mode group velocity and strong three-phonon scattering caused by the strong anharmonicity of the Tl atom are the origin of the ultralow κL. Meanwhile, the strong ionic bonds between X (X = Hg, Sn, Pb) and F atoms provide good electrical transport properties. The results show that the ZT value of TlHgF3 at 900 K is 1.58, which is higher than the 1.5 value of FeNbSb at 1200 K. TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 also exceed 1, which is close to the classical thermoelectric material PbTe:Na. Furthermore, we present the methods and expected effects of improving the ZT value through nanostructures.
I. Introduction
The largest difficulties facing humanity and science today are energy shortages, environmental degradation, and the societal issues they bring about.1–3 Finding clean, efficient, and environmentally friendly energy has become an increasingly urgent need for mankind. Thermoelectric (TE) materials can harness a variety of heat sources, including solar, geothermal, and waste heat, to generate clean electricity without adding to the existing pollutants.4–7 The TE material conversion efficiency is evaluated using the dimensionless merit figure ZT = S2σT/(κL + κe), where S is the thermopower, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the temperature, κL and κe denote the lattice and electrical thermal conductivity, respectively. To improve the ZT value, the power factor (PF), defined as S2σ, can be increased by methods such as carrier energy filtering8,9 and band alignment.10 Furthermore, reducing the thermal conductivity through the use of sublattice disorder,11 nanostructures,12 and anharmonicity,13–15 among other techniques, can significantly improve thermoelectric performance. Therefore, an optimal TE material should have the properties of a phonon-glass electron-crystal,16 that is, have poor thermal conductivity and good electrical conductivity at the same time.
Fluoride perovskites have been the subject of much theoretical and experimental research,17,18 and they can be used in optical lenses, radiation dosimeters, and the semiconductor industry.19,20 In 2016, van Roekeghem et al. reported the thermal conductivity of a large number of semiconductors with cubic perovskite structures using machine learning techniques and limited temperature phonon computations, among which the thallium-based fluoride perovskites TlHgF3, TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 all have ultralow κL values of less than 0.3 W m−1 K−1 at 1000 K.21 Many studies have predicted the stability of these Tl-based compounds,22 and TlHgF3 has been synthesized experimentally.23 According to a recent report by Pingak on the structural and electronic properties of Tl-based perovskites,24 we found that these materials have electronic structures with flat band and high dispersion coexistence. The former provides a larger S and the latter provides a higher σ, so the coexisting electronic band structure of the two features usually implies a larger PF.
Inspired by the above references, we investigated the thermoelectric transport properties of cubic thallium-based fluoride perovskites TlXF3 (X = Hg, Sn, Pb) which had not previously been reported. Using first-principles calculations, combined with self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory and the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), finite temperature effects are considered in the phonon calculations. Since the structure is unstable at low temperatures, the traditional solution of the BTE based on harmonic approximation (HA) fails to obtain the correct κL due to the presence of imaginary phonon frequencies.25 Therefore, when calculating phonon eigenvalues, lattice anharmonicity must be taken into account. The results show that significant quartic anharmonicity is crucial for the dynamical stability, and the hardening of the low-frequency acoustic branches makes the imaginary frequencies disappear. More importantly, the strong anharmonic phonon scattering and the low group velocity of acoustic phonons lead to an ultralow κL, where for TlPbF3 this is only 0.42 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K. Meanwhile, the strong bonding of X (X = Hg, Sn, Pb) and F atoms guarantees good electrical conductivity. We captured higher PF and ZT values in p-type TlHgF3, and in n-type TlSnF3 and TlPbF3, respectively, where the ZT of TlHgF3 reached 1.58 at 900 K. Furthermore, a smaller grain boundary size can significantly reduce κL but has little effect on the electron relaxation time,26 so we point out ways to further improve the thermoelectric performance by reducing the grain boundary size. This paper reports the excellent thermoelectric properties of three thallium-based compounds and elucidates the microscopic origins of ultralow κL.
II. Methodology
Cubic TlXF3 (X = Hg, Sn, Pb) belongs to the Pmm space group, and its primitive cell consists of five atoms in which the Tl, X, and F atoms are located at the body center, vertex, and edge, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Based on density functional theory (DFT),28,29 the projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials30 were used in the first-principles calculations to characterize the exchange of energy between the ionic cores and valence electrons. The exchange–correlation interactions are processed based on the PBE functional31 implemented in the VASP software package.32 In all DFT calculations, 500 eV was used as the cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set. A 10 × 10 × 10 k-point grid is used for structural optimization. The electron energy convergence criterion is set to 10−8 eV, and the force for ion relaxation is less than 10−6 eV Å−1. The optimized lattice constants are listed in Table 1, which are essentially consistent with previous studies. The dielectric permittivity and Born effective charge data calculated using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)33 are also listed in Table 1 and were used to calculate non-analytical corrections due to dipole–dipole interactions. The high-temperature thermal stability of these three semiconductors was tested via 20000-step (the time step is set to 2 fs for a total of 40 ps) ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations in a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell, as shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† Using the ALAMODE code,34,35 the harmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs) were captured via the finite displacement method,36 and the anharmonic IFCs were trained based on the compressed sensing (CS) technique37,38 (see ESI† for details). The κL values of these three fluoride perovskites were estimated within a 16 × 16 × 16 q-point mesh using the BTE of the relaxation time approximation (RTA).39

Taking input from first-principles calculations, we calculated the electronic lifetime and transport properties of TlXF3 (X = Hg, Sn, Pb) using the AMSET code.40 The macroscopic static dielectric tensor, effective phonon frequency, and the elastic constants were captured through DFPT calculations using the PBE functional, which are listed in Table S1 and Table 2, respectively. All three compounds satisfy the mechanical stability criterion for the cubic crystal structure: C11 > |C12|, C11 + 2C12 > 0, C44 > 0.41 The PBE functional was used to determine the electronic band structure, while the HSE06 functiona;42 was used to precisely estimate the electronic band gap. Meanwhile, reasonable electron relaxation times were captured by considering multiple scattering mechanisms, including acoustic deformation potential (ADP) scattering, polar optical (POP) scattering, ionized impurity (IMP) scattering, and grain boundary scattering. Solving the linearized BTE in a dense 61 × 61 × 61 k-point grid yields reasonable electron transport coefficients. Please refer to the ESI† for more details of these calculations.

III. Results and discussion
The harmonic phonon dispersion curves of three thallium-based fluoride perovskites TlXF3 (X = Hg, Sn, Pb) are shown as gray lines in Fig. 1(b)–(d). The presence of imaginary frequencies indicates that the material cannot maintain a cubic structure at zero temperature. From the HPDOS curves, the imaginary frequency is mainly provided by Tl and F atoms. However, as shown by the solid blue line of the phonon spectrum marked by SCP in Fig. 1(b)–(d), after considering the quartic anharmonic renormalization, the low-lying phonon modes harden significantly, and the imaginary frequency completely disappears, indicating that the material is dynamically stable at room temperature. The anharmonicity of the Tl and F atoms plays a crucial role in describing the temperature-dependent lattice dynamics of these three compounds. The overall phonon frequency increases as the temperature increases from 300 K to 600 K, consistent with the results for most materials with strong anharmonicity.44–46 TlHgF3 shows high dispersion in the frequency range of 150–350 cm−1, reflecting the large group velocity of optical phonons. As shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI,† TlSnF3 also exhibits the unique behavior that the group velocity of optical phonons is greater than that of acoustic phonons. Compared with TlSnF3, the low-frequency acoustic phonon branch of TlHgF3 is flatter, which leads to a lower acoustic phonon group velocity, as shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† In addition, all three materials have the characteristic that the acoustic branch intersects the optical branch, which provides more scattering channels. From the AHPDOS curves, the peaks in the low-lying modes cause phonon scattering to occur more easily. As shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI,† the three-phonon scattering phase space is promoted, especially for TlPbF3. Strangely, the peaks are mainly contributed by Tl atoms, although Pb atoms are heavier. The weakest vibrational intensity caused by the isolated situation of the Tl atom is the cause of this anomaly, as shown in Fig. 4(a).

Fig. 2 presents the lattice thermal conductivity κL values of the three fluoride perovskites at different temperatures. At 300 K, the κL of TlHgF3 and TlSnF3 is 0.80 and 0.88 W m−1 K−1, respectively, each of which is lower than the 0.9 W m−1 K−1 of quartz glass, the traditionally used low thermal conductivity material. The smaller acoustic phonon group velocity makes the κL of TlHgF3 lower than that of TlSnF3. TlPbF3 is as low as 0.42 W m−1 K−1, which is only one-fifth of the classical thermoelectric material PbTe.47 According to the Debye heat capacity model, when the ambient temperature is much higher than the Debye temperature (ΘD) of the crystal, its heat capacity (CV) tends to a maximum. As listed in Table 2, the ΘD of the three materials is very small, so it is easy to reach the high temperature limit, and the CV tends to be constant. Therefore, the reasons for the low thermal conductivity can be analyzed from two aspects: the phonon group velocity and the phonon lifetime (see eqn (S1) in the ESI†). Generally speaking, the group velocity of acoustic phonons for most materials is larger, combined with relaxation times that are much higher than optical phonons, resulting in κL being mainly contributed by the acoustic branch.48–50 However, the uniquely low acoustic phonon group velocity in TlHgF3 and TlSnF3 and the very low phonon lifetime in TlPbF3 suppress the contribution of the acoustic modes to thermal transport, as shown in Fig. 3(b)–(d). According to Fig. S4 in the ESI,† despite the small Grüneisen parameter of TlPbF3, its scattering phase space at low frequencies is very large. This induces a larger three-phonon scattering rate, resulting in extremely low acoustic phonon lifetimes. Therefore, the low group velocity and the strong anharmonic phonon scattering caused by the flat low-frequency acoustic branch in the phonon spectrum are the origins of the low κL.

(b–d) Lattice thermal conductivity spectra κL (ω) (cyan filled region beneath the curves) and relevant cumulative κL (purple lines) in (b) TlHgF3, (c) TlSnF3, and (d) TlPbF3. 
We calculated the isotopic scattering based on the isotopic abundance of each element in nature and found that the effect is small. Furthermore, setting the grain boundary size to 1 mm minimizes its effect on the overall scattering rate (see eqn (S2) in the ESI†). Therefore, our calculated κL is more inclined to be an overestimate, this obtaining a more conservative and more reasonable ZT value, rather than an artificially high one. Since an ideal single crystal of a certain size is difficult to produce in the laboratory, and since the actual grain size is relatively small, we give the grain boundary scattering rates and κL for different grain sizes, as shown in Fig. S5 of the ESI.† The results show that κL can be effectively reduced by limiting the grain boundary size, which is expected to improve the thermoelectric performance. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the cumulative κL of TlHgF3, TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 reached a maximum at the MFP of 14.72, 11.54 and 13.15 nm, respectively, indicating that the κL can be further reduced through nanostructuring. Of course, this approach also reduces the electrical conductivity and thus limits the electrical transport properties, which will be discussed later.
The average mechanical properties of the bulk polycrystals calculated according to the Hill method51 are listed in Table 2 and Table S2 of the ESI.† The Young's modulus and shear modulus of TlHgF3 are relatively small, indicating that its interatomic bonding is weaker.52 The results for Poisson's ratio53 and Pugh's ratio54 show that all three compounds are brittle materials. Moreover, the results of universal elastic anisotropy show that TlPbF3 has a large mechanical anisotropy, which may lead to the appearance of microcracks.55
As shown in Fig. 4(a) and Table S3 of the ESI,† Tl atoms bond weakly to their neighbors, and their strong anharmonicity leads to ultralow κL values. Meanwhile, the shared charge between X (X = Hg, Sn, Pb) and F atoms facilitates electron transport. From Fig. 4(b), TlHgF3 shows high dispersion near the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM), ensuring both high electrical conductivity and carrier mobility. This material, with low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity, exhibits typical characteristics of phonon-glass electron-crystals and is often a potential thermoelectric material. More importantly, the highly degenerate pockets of the VBM and the flat bands on the high symmetry line M–R provide a larger density of states, implying a larger Seebeck coefficient for p-type TlHgF3. Likewise, TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 exhibit similar behavior near the CBM. The coexistence of the high dispersion and the flat band of electronic structure contributes to the large power factor,56 which gives us more confidence in the thermoelectric performance of the three materials.

The total EDOS is represented by the light gray area, while the cyan, blue and purple lines represent the contributions of Tl, X (X = Hg, Sn, Pb), and F atoms, respectively. 
The calculation results from the HSE06 functional are shown in Fig. S6 of the ESI,† and the electronic energy band structure is essentially consistent with that of the PBE functional. We take the band gap value based on HSE06 as the input parameter, while the calculation of the electron group velocity continues to use the PBE functional. Compared with the GGA+U method used in ref. 27, our method is more reasonable because there is no experimental value for support and the setting of the U value is not reliable. To obtain reasonable electron relaxation times, we considered four scattering mechanisms: acoustic deformation potential scattering, polar optical scattering, ionized impurity scattering and electron grain boundary scattering, as shown in Fig. S7 of the ESI.† The grain boundary size is set to 1 mm, which is consistent with the phonon calculations. The results show that POP scattering dominates the electron lifetime, and this strong electron–phonon interaction is usually caused by the low-lying modes of optical phonons.57 For example, the high-frequency optical phonon branch of TlHgF3 softens significantly at the M and R points, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Subsequently, we calculated the electrical transport coefficients of the thallium based fluoride perovskites TlXF3 (X = Hg, Sn, Pb), as shown in Fig. 5. The variation trends of the Seebeck coefficient S and the electrical conductivity σ with the carrier doping concentration (nh or ne) of the three compounds are the same. The Seebeck coefficient S falls and the electrical conductivity σ rises, which is in line with most thermoelectric materials.58,59 Furthermore, S becomes larger with increasing temperature, while this trend is reversed for σ. The former is because the larger temperature difference leads to a more intense diffusion movement of carriers from the hot end to the cold end. The latter is caused by stronger electron–phonon scattering at high temperatures, as shown in Fig. S7 of the ESI.† For the electronic thermal conductivity, κe, this can be judged according to the Wiedemann–Franz law κe = LσT, where L is the Lorentz number, usually a constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Therefore, the change in κe with temperature is determined by the competitive mechanism of σ and T. The κe of TlHgF3 is larger at high temperatures, and the opposite is true for TlPbF3.

The wine red, dark cyan, and blue lines are indicated for 300 K, 600 K, and 900 K, respectively. 
Finally, we overcome the contradictory properties of S, σ and κe by adjusting the carrier concentration to capture the best power factor (S2σ) values for p-type TlHgF3, and n-type TlSnF3 and TlPbF3, respectively. Combined with the ultralow κL, the three thallium-based compounds exhibit excellent thermoelectric properties. Among them, the ZT value of TlHgF3 at 900 K is 1.58, which is higher than the 1.5 of FeNbSb at 1200 K.60 Also at 900 K, TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 reach 1.05 and 1.28, respectively, which are close to 1.4 for PbTe:Na.61 Furthermore, we found that the thermoelectric properties of these three materials can be effectively enhanced by limiting the grain boundary size. As shown in Fig. S8 of the ESI,† even considering the small size of 20 nm, the electron grain boundary scattering rate is still small, and is tens to hundreds of times smaller than other scattering. The small effect on the electrical transport and the significant suppression of thermal transport lead to a ZT value of 1.73 for TlHgF3 when considering the 20 nm grain boundary. The ZT values of TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 also reached 1.14 and 1.37 at the same grain boundary size, which is an increase of nearly ten percent.
In addition, after considering spin–orbit coupling (SOC), the electronic band structure of TlHgF3 shows no obvious change, whereas the CBM of TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 is split and the band gap is reduced due to the contribution mainly from the heavy element Tl, as shown in Fig. S9 of the ESI.† As shown in Fig. S10 of the ESI,† there is almost no contribution from Tl atoms near the Fermi level of TlHgF3, so its electrical transport parameters and thermoelectric properties do not change significantly after considering SOC. However, both the S and σ values of TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 decreased slightly upon considering SOC, and the ZT value also dropped below 1. TlSnF3, with a narrower band gap, exhibits a bipolar effect at 900 K; that is, due to high-temperature thermal excitation, the reverse electric field generated by minority carrier migration reduces S. Therefore, the incorporation of SOC is detrimental to the thermoelectric properties of TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 but has little effect on TlHgF3.
IV. Conclusion
Using first-principles calculations and the Boltzmann transport equation, we systematically study the mechanical and thermoelectric transport properties of cubic thallium-based fluoride perovskites TlXF3 (X = Hg, Sn, Pb). The mechanical stability and high-temperature thermal stability of these materials are demonstrated through elastic constant calculations and 40 ps AIMD simulations. By treating the effect of quartic anharmonicity on the phonon energy, the dynamic stability of the three compounds is verified and reasonable lattice thermal conductivity κL values are captured. The unique lower group velocity of the acoustic mode compared with the optical mode, combined with strong anharmonic phonon scattering, results in an ultralow κL that is smaller than that of quartz glass. By fully considering deformation potential scattering, polar optical scattering, ionized impurity scattering, and electron grain boundary scattering, we captured a reasonable electron relaxation time. The coexistence of high dispersion and a flat band enables p-type TlHgF3, and n-type TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 to have larger power factors. The ZT value of TlHgF3 at 900 K reaches 1.58, which is higher than that of the half-Heusler material FeNbSb. The ZT values of TlSnF3 and TlPbF3 also exceed 1, which is close to the classical thermoelectric material PbTe:Na. Furthermore, since the small grain boundary size can effectively suppress κL but has little effect on the electrical transport, we present the methods and expected effects in enhancing the thermoelectric performance that can be achieved through nanostructuring. This work points out the great application potential of thallium-based fluoride perovskites TlXF3 (X = Hg, Sn, Pb) in thermal management and thermoelectric fields.
