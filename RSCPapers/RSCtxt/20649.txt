    , Accepted 1st February 2021First published on 2nd February 2021AbstractConstructing a befitting structure for efficient charge separation and transport is highly required for photocatalytic water splitting reactions to generate hydrogen (H2). Herein, we successfully integrated a defective TiO2/MoP heterojunction with highly conductive carbon cloth (CC), for constructing a panel reactor with charge transfer channels to boost H2 evolution. As expected, the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers is effectively steered, resulting in high-efficiency charge migration and separation, and consequently improving photocatalytic activity. The optimal TiO2/MoP/CC exhibits a H2 generation rate of 14.7 μmol h−1 cm−2, up to 19 times higher than that of TiO2/CC. Our work can open up ways to optimize the photocatalytic performance by developing novel non-powder-based photocatalyst systems with good stability and recyclability.
1. Introduction
Converting sustainable solar energy into fuels such as hydrogen (H2) through photocatalysis is a promising technique to solve the current energy shortage;1–4 thus, developing high efficiency devices is a pivotal point. Among various metal oxide based photocatalysts for H2 generation, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has attracted extensive attention by virtue of its suitable conduction band position for proton reduction, environmental friendliness and good stability.5,6 However, the solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency is far below the actual requirement, suffering from the limited light harvesting and poor charge separation. Therefore, many attractive strategies to improve the H2 generation activity of TiO2 have been developed, including cocatalyst loading,7 heteroatom doping,8 defect introduction9 and heterostructure construction.10,11 Among them, cocatalyst loading is one successful technique.
Transition metal phosphides, such as FeP, Ni2P, CoP, etc., have been widely employed as cocatalysts in photocatalytic water splitting.12–15 In particular for MoP, its electronic structure is similar to that of Pt,16 thus presenting metal-like properties and good electrical conductivity. In addition, the metal–H bond formed on the surface of the transition metal will hinder the release of H2, while the introduction of P to form a metal–P bond can promote the release of H2 from the active site.17 For example, Yue et al.18 firstly reported the loading of MoP cocatalyst on CdS, exhibiting significantly improved H2 generation activity. In addition, designing efficient charge transfer channels could provide a strong driving force to maximize the separation of charge carriers, resulting in high efficiency charge utilization. For example, Liu and co-workers19 integrated CdS with a graphene nanoribbon to construct a charge transfer path that boosts the electrons transfer from CdS to the graphene nanoribbon, which dramatically improves the H2 generation efficiency under visible light irradiation.
Developing efficient and recyclable devices is most pivotal for energy conversion.20–24 Traditional powder photocatalysts suffer from easy agglomeration and difficulty in recycling, which restrains their large-scale application. It is believed that designing photocatalyst-based devices is an effective way to solve the problems mentioned above. Luo and co-workers synthesized TiO2 nanotube arrays/graphene/Cu2O on Ti mesh to achieve efficient photoelectrocatalytic performance.25,26 Commercial CC is widely employed as the substrate in electrocatalytic reactions by virtue of its high connectivity, conductivity and chemical stability.27,28 One expects that CC can serve as a supporter and electron collector to further improve the charge transfer rate, thus improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Besides, the introduction of defects into the photocatalysts not only boosts the separation of charge carriers but also provides abundant reaction active sites,29 greatly improving the photocatalytic performance.
Herein, as a proof-of-concept experiment, we designed a highly defective TiO2/MoP/CC composite exhibiting outstanding photocatalytic H2 generation activity. Amazingly, the resulting H2 generation rate reaches 14.7 μmol h−1 cm−2, which was 19 times larger than that of TiO2/CC. The experimental results clearly reveal that on the one hand, the self-supported CC can provide a large surface area for the growth of catalysts, thus inhibiting their agglomeration and increasing the contact area between TiO2 and MoP; on the other hand, CC acts as an electron collector, inducing the directional migration of photogenerated electrons in the order of TiO2 → MoP → CC. In addition, rich defects can increase the donor density and promote the transport of photogenerated charges. As a result, the separation of electron–hole pairs is highly improved. It is expected that this work can open up ways to optimize the photocatalytic performance by developing novel non-powder-based photocatalyst systems.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of MoP/CC
MoP/CC was synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal-calcination process.18,30 Typically, 2 mmol of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 14 mmol of (NH4)2HPO4 and 19 mmol of citric acid were added to 10 mL of deionized water. After being fully stirred for 30 min, the transparent solution with a piece of CC (1 cm × 1.5 cm) was transferred to a 40 mL stainless Teflon lined autoclave and heated at 140 °C for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the CC was dried in a vacuum system for 30 min. Subsequently, the as-prepared CC was calcined at 850 °C for 2 h under a N2/H2 (10 vol% of H2) atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. To remove possible impurities, the obtained CC was washed with 0.1 M HCl solution, and MoP/CC was successfully obtained. After calculation, the loading weight of MoP on CC was 3.0 mg, and the obtained sample was denoted as MoP/CC-3.0. Similarly, a series of MoP/CC-x (x = 0.6, 2.6 and 3.6) photocatalysts were also prepared by varying the precursors.
2.2 Synthesis of TiO2 and TiO2/MoP/CC
TiO2 was prepared through a facile hydrothermal process. Typically, 1.0 mL of TBOT was dropped into HAc (30 mL) solution with vigorous stirring for 10 min. Then the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL stainless Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 12 h. After cooling, the product was washed with ethanol for 3 times and dried at 80 °C for 24 h. After calcination at 500 °C for 2 h under an air atmosphere, the target TiO2 was obtained. A simple electrophoresis method was carried out to prepare TiO2/MoP/CC. The electrophoresis system consists of a direct-current power supply, an electrophoresis tank, an electrolyte (acetone), a cathode (MoP/CC) and an anode (FTO). Generally, 8 mg of I2 and 40 mg of TiO2 were fully dispersed in 20 mL of acetone by ultrasonication. The electrophoresis process was performed at a voltage of 50 V for 10 min. After that, the obtained CC was calcined at 500 °C for 2 h under a N2/H2 atmosphere with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. The mass difference before and after the electrophoresis process is the loading amount of TiO2. For comparison, TiO2/CC and TiO2/CC-N2 were prepared through a similar process under N2/H2 and N2 atmospheres, respectively.
2.3 Characterization
Structural characterization includes X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)measurements. Morphological characterization includes field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping. The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were employed to study the optical properties. Photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), surface photovoltage (SPV) and transient photovoltage measurements were recorded to explore the behaviors of photogenerated charge carriers. More detailed instrument parameters and test methods are presented in the ESI.†
2.4 Photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction
The photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments were performed on an automatic on-line trace gas analysis system (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfectlight Tec. Co., Ltd) by using a 300 mL Pyrex glass reaction cell. In a typical test, the CC-based photocatalyst was put into 10 vol% of triethanolamine aqueous solution under vertical irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp (as a simulated solar light source, 810 W m−2), and circulating cooling water was used to maintain the system at 5 °C. Generated H2 was detected and analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu Co., Japan) equipped with an MS-5A molecular sieve and a thermal conductivity detector with Ar as the carrier gas. The stability tests were performed for 6 repeated cycles with a total duration of 24 h, and the system needed to be evacuated after every cycle. The apparent quantum yields were measured under irradiation provided by a 300 W Xe lamp with band-pass filters with central wavelengths of 365, 380, 420 and 450 nm.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements including linear sweep voltammetric curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Mott–Schottky plots and current–time curves were carried out on an electrochemical analyzer using a three-electrode system (detailed methods are available in the ESI†).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Material characterization
The fabrication process of TiO2/MoP/CC illustrated in Fig. 1A involves two steps. In the first step, condensed MoP layers were grown on a CC substrate through a hydrothermal and subsequent calcination process under a N2/H2 atmosphere. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) reveals that the MoP layer is made up of small nanoparticles (NPs) with an average size of 90 nm, strongly and uniformly anchored on CC (Fig. 1D and E). The second step is the typical electrophoresis and N2/H2 treatment processes to grow the as-prepared TiO2 on MoP/CC. As shown in Fig. 1F and G, TiO2 NPs with a mean size of 70 nm are evenly decorated on the surface of MoP/CC. It needs to be emphasized here that the thermal treatment under a N2/H2 atmosphere could lead to defects in the photocatalyst. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping of TiO2/MoP/CC shows the uniform distributions of Mo, P, Ti and O within the C fiber (Fig. 2H), proving the existence of MoP and TiO2. In addition, the EDX spectrum further evidences the co-existence of every element in the TiO2/MoP/CC hybrid.

In order to investigate in more detail the microscopic morphology of the samples, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and selected area electron diffraction characterization tests were carried out. Fig. 2A shows the TEM image of the TiO2/MoP/CC sample. It can be seen from the HRTEM images (Fig. 2A1 and A2) that two lattice spacings of 0.351 and 0.279 nm are observed, corresponding to the (101) and (100) crystal planes of TiO231 and MoP,30 respectively. Some defects can also be clearly seen in both TiO2 and MoP (Fig. 2A1 and A2). Besides, for TiO2, the lattice fringe is obvious and regularly arranged in region 1, while distorted and even missing or amorphous lattices are observed in regions 2 and 3 (Fig. 2A1). Similar results can also be found in Fig. 2A2. Furthermore, the clear interface, lattice distortion and amorphous region between MoP and TiO2 can be clearly observed in Fig. 2C.32,33 These observations indicate that some defects exist in the TiO2/MoP/CC hybrid, originating from the N2/H2 treatment at high temperature. And two kinds of diffraction rings are detected in the selected area electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 2D), which are assigned to TiO2 and MoP phases (Fig. S2†), respectively, in agreement with the HRTEM results.
To explore the crystal structure and chemical composition of the obtained photocatalysts, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra were recorded. Fig. 3A shows the typical XRD patterns of TiO2/MoP/CC, MoP/CC and TiO2/CC. For MoP/CC and TiO2/CC samples, their characteristic peaks can be indexed to hexagonal MoP (JCPDS No. 24-0771)34 and the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272),35 respectively. For the TiO2/MoP/CC sample, characteristic peaks of both MoP and TiO2 can be observed, proving that the target hybrid is indeed synthesized. Fig. 3B displays the Raman spectra of TiO2/CC and TiO2/MoP/CC. For TiO2/CC, characteristic signals at 144.8, 393.1, 519.5 and 639.4 cm−1 are attributed to the Eg1, B1g1, A1g + B1g2 and E3g3 stretching modes of TiO2,31,36 respectively. Interestingly, a slight blue shift and broadening of the Eg1 peak in TiO2/MoP/CC are observed compared to that of TiO2/CC, which suggests the strong interaction between TiO2 and MoP.37 To confirm the existence of P and O vacancies (PV and OV), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was carried out on the as-prepared photocatalysts. As presented in Fig. 3C, EPR signals at g = 2.003 can be detected in the three samples, indicating the presence of unpaired electrons, further indicating the existence of PV and OV.33,38 In comparison, no EPR signal is observed for the TiO2/CC-N2 sample (Fig. S4†).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test was performed to analyze the chemical composition and the valence state of the samples. In Fig. 4A, the high-resolution Ti 2p XPS spectrum of TiO2/CC can be fitted into two peaks at 464.4 and 458.6 eV,33 attributed to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2. The O 1s XPS spectrum of TiO2/CC (Fig. 4B) shows three peaks at binding energies of 529.8, 531.3 and 532.3 eV, which are ascribed to lattice oxygen (Ti–O–Ti), defect oxygen (OV) and adsorbed water,39,40 respectively, while for TiO2/MoP/CC, an additional peak at 530.6 eV is observed, corresponding to the Ti–O–Mo bond. This result confirms that the TiO2/MoP heterojunction is successfully synthesized.41Fig. 4C and D show the XPS spectra of Mo 3d and P 2p for MoP/CC and TiO2/MoP/CC samples. For MoP/CC, P 2p can be divided into four peaks, assigned to P–C (133.5 eV), P–O (134.1 eV)42,43 and P–Mo (P 2p1/2, 130.4 eV; P 2p3/2, 129.5 eV)16 bonds, respectively. The P–C bond comes from the in situ growth of MoP on CC. As regards the Mo 3d region (Fig. 4D) of TiO2/MoP/CC, it shows three doublets assigned to Mo–P in MoP (Mo 3d3/2, 231.4 eV; Mo 3d5/2, 228.2 eV),44,45 Mo4+ (Mo 3d3/2, 235.2 eV; Mo 3d5/2, 232.1 eV) and Mo6+ (Mo 3d3/2, 236.4 eV; Mo 3d5/2, 233.2 eV) states, respectively. Importantly, the Ti 2p and O 1s (Ti–O–Ti group) XPS spectra of TiO2/MoP/CC both shift towards higher binding energies compared to those of TiO2/CC, while the P 2p (P–Mo group) and Mo 3d (Mo–P group) XPS spectra of TiO2/MoP/CC show negatively shifted binding energies with respect to MoP/CC. These results indicate the existence of strong interaction between TiO2 and MoP in the TiO2/MoP/CC composite. The difference in electronegativity of elements in the composite and the single component favors electron transfer from the donor to acceptor, that is TiO2 to MoP.33,46

3.2 Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic H2 generation performances of the as-prepared samples were evaluated in triethanolamine (10 vol%, as the sacrificial agent) solution under simulated solar light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 5A and S5,† both TiO2/CC and MoP/CC show low H2 generation rates, which are 0.76 and 0.10 μmol h−1 cm−2, respectively. Interestingly, when MoP was combined with TiO2 as a cocatalyst, the photocatalytic activities of the composite photocatalysts were significantly improved. The highest H2 generation rate of 14.7 μmol h−1 cm−2 is achieved on TiO2/MoP/CC-3.0, which is 19 times larger than that of TiO2/CC. Stability is also an important parameter to evaluate the performance of a photocatalyst; thus, a continuous 24 h photocatalytic H2 generation test over TiO2/MoP/CC was conducted under simulated sunlight irradiation (Fig. 5B). Clearly, the H2 generation amount of TiO2/MoP/CC showed no obvious decline after 6 cycles, exhibiting good stability, which can also be proved by XPS and TEM tests before and after reactions (Fig. S6 and S7†). To measure the apparent quantum yields, the photocatalytic performances of TiO2/MoP/CC were measured under different wavelengths (λ = 365, 380, 420 and 450 nm) (Fig. 5C and S8†). As a result, the highest apparent quantum yield of 0.906% is achieved at the wavelength of 365 nm. In addition, the trend of wavelength dependent apparent quantum yield values is highly consistent with the UV-vis DRS spectrum (Fig. 5D).

3.3 Optical properties

Fig. 6A shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of TiO2/CC, MoP/CC and TiO2/MoP/CC samples. Pure TiO2/CC exhibits an absorption edge at 380 nm, while MoP/CC shows the whole absorption in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm.18 For TiO2/MoP/CC, the absorption edge shows no obvious shift owing to the growth of TiO2 on the surface. According to the Kubelka–Munk method (Fig. S9†), the energy gaps of TiO2/CC and MoP/CC are calculated to be 3.24 and 1.45 eV,47 respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra under an excitation wavelength of 325 nm were recorded to explore the transfer and separation process of photogenerated charges, as shown in Fig. 6B. Generally, the more serious the charge recombination, the stronger the PL signal.48 As we can see, TiO2/CC shows a strong peak at a wavelength of 390 nm, which is ascribed to band-to-band transition, while for TiO2/MoP/CC, an obvious PL quenching is observed, indicating that the recombination of electrons and holes is inhibited. This result may be due to the formation of the TiO2/MoP heterojunction that promotes the separation and transport of carriers and improves their utilization, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation performance.13,14 Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were employed to analyze the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 6C). The average lifetime of TiO2/MoP/CC (0.49 ns) is shorter than that of TiO2/CC (1.08 ns), meaning that the charge transfer from TiO2 to MoP in the former is faster.49,50 The rapid charge transfer rate induces improved charge separation efficiency, which is a crucial factor for the enhanced catalytic activity. The specific surface areas of TiO2/CC and TiO2/MoP/CC are measured to be 37.1 and 36.1 m2 g−1 (Fig. S10†), respectively, suggesting that the surface area is not the reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity.

3.4 Photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the semiconductor character and determine the flat band potential of TiO2/CC and MoP/CC, Mott–Schottky plots were recorded. As shown in Fig. 6D, both samples show positive slopes, indicating their n-type semiconductor nature.51 Generally, the flat band potential value can be obtained by extrapolating the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot to the x-axis (i.e., 1/Csc2 = 0). As a result, the flat band potentials of TiO2/CC and MoP/CC specimens are recorded to be −0.79 and −0.46 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. It's generally acknowledged that the conduction band potential is more negative about −0.1 or −0.2 V than the flat band potential;48 thus, the conduction band potentials of TiO2/CC and MoP/CC are reckoned to be −0.99 and −0.66 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which are −0.79 and −0.46 V vs. NHE (ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V), respectively. Thus the valence band energies of TiO2/CC and MoP/CC can be calculated to be 2.45 and 0.99 V vs. NHE, respectively, according to the obtained energy gaps.
To elucidate the strong correlation between the charge behaviours and the enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation activity, transient photocurrent curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy plots were recorded. As depicted in Fig. 6E, the TiO2/MoP/CC photoelectrode shows much stronger photocurrent response compared to TiO2/CC, suggesting that the charge separation is significantly promoted owing to the modification of MoP cocatalyst.33 Meanwhile, the intensity of photocurrent displays no obvious attenuation after five light-on/off cycles, which is in line with the results of photocatalytic stability tests. The comparison of the current–time curves (Fig. S11A†) of TiO2/CC and TiO2/CC-N2 suggests that the incorporation of OV and PV plays a vital role in enhancing the separation of charge carriers in the TiO2/MoP/CC photocatalyst. Fig. 6F illustrates the typical electrochemical impedance spectroscopy Nyquist plots of the three samples as well as the equivalent circuit model, in which Rs and Rct represent the solution resistance and charge transfer resistance,52 respectively. It is apparent that TiO2/MoP/CC displays a much smaller Rct value (1.5 Ω) than TiO2/CC (2.4 Ω), meaning that the introduction of MoP and defects can reduce the transport resistance, benefiting from its good electron transfer capability,53 thus accelerating the charge transfer kinetics in the H2 generation reaction.45 In addition, the linear sweep voltammetric curves (Fig. S12†) reveal that MoP together with incorporated defects can effectively reduce the overpotential of the water reduction reaction,54 thus achieving improved photocatalytic H2 generation activity.
To further explore the separation and transfer pathways of photogenerated electrons and holes in TiO2/CC and TiO2/MoP/CC, lock-in-based surface photovoltage and transient photovoltage measurements were carried out. TiO2 is a typical n-type semiconductor with an upward surface band bending; when it is excited, the holes will transfer from the bulk to the surface, resulting in a positive signal.15 As shown in Fig. 7A, TiO2/CC exhibits a clear positive signal in the wavelength range of 300–380 nm, which is due to the band-to-band transition. Meanwhile, the signal peak in the visible light region under 480 nm can be ascribed to the sub-band-gap transition, which is caused by the surface trap states. Compared with TiO2/CC, the signal intensity of TiO2/MoP/CC was significantly weakened, which suggests that a large number of electrons were transferred from TiO2 to MoP, which partially offsets part of the positive signal. However, the surface photovoltage signal in the visible light region disappears for TiO2/MoP/CC, indicating that a large amount of electrons are transferred to MoP and the enhanced charge separation can weaken the surface trap states.55 In addition, a negative signal appears at 330–365 nm, which may be due to the fact that PV and OV in TiO2/MoP/CC can promote electron transfer to the surface and improve the charge separation efficiency. The related phase diagram is shown in Fig. S13.† It can be seen that a smaller phase retardation with respect to 0° can be observed for TiO2/MoP/CC in the range of 300–500 nm when compared to TiO2/CC, implying that the trend of photogenerated electrons moving to the outer surface is heightened.47
 Fig. 7  (A) Surface photovoltage and (B) transient photovoltage spectra of TiO2/CC and TiO2/MoP/CC samples. 
The transient photovoltage spectra depicted in Fig. 7B clearly reveal that both TiO2/CC and TiO2/MoP/CC show two signal peaks, which are Peaks 1 and 2, representing the charge separation under the laser excitation and charge transfer process, respectively. Moreover, the time corresponding to Peak 2 is the point where the charge recombination and separation are in dynamic equilibrium.56 The later the retardation peak appears, the slower the charge recombination rate is.54 Clearly, for TiO2/MoP/CC, the directional electron transfer is faster that it will take longer time (5 × 10−6 s) to recombine with holes compared to TiO2/CC (3 × 10−6 s). In other words, more photogenerated charge carriers over TiO2/MoP/CC participate in the photocatalytic reaction rather than recombination.
The charge transfer process and proposed photocatalytic H2 reaction mechanism are illustrated in Fig. 8. A typical type I heterojunction between MoP and TiO2 is formed in the TiO2/MoP/CC photoreactor. Under simulated solar light illumination, TiO2 and MoP can be easily activated to generate electrons and holes. Most conduction band electrons of TiO2 can easily and promptly transfer to that of MoP, and then inject into the CC substrate with high electrical conductivity, on which the H+ reduction reaction happens. Meanwhile, some holes will also migrate from TiO2 to MoP to oxidize the triethanolamine. Because of the high harvesting ability of triethanolamine to holes, most of the holes cannot transfer from TiO2 to MoP in fact; that is, the oxidation reaction mainly occurs on TiO2. As a result, the photogenerated electrons and holes are gathered at different semiconductors, leading to high charge separation in space. In addition, the rich defects in both TiO2 and MoP could act as electron traps, further accelerating the separation of charge carriers and prolonging their lifetimes. Besides, MoP has an excellent cocatalysis effect, which can reduce the activation energy of the H2 generation reaction.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully designed and constructed a defect-rich TiO2/MoP/CC panel reactor for highly efficient photocatalytic H2 generation for the first time. The optimized TiO2/MoP/CC displays remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 14.7 μmol h−1 cm−2 (apparent quantum yield of 0.906% at 365 nm), which is 19 times higher than that of TiO2/CC. The results of experiments demonstrated that (1) the incorporated PV and OV serve as electron traps, thus promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carriers; (2) the introduced MoP cocatalyst not only provides abundant active sites, but also lowers the overpotential for proton reduction; (3) the constructed hybrid supported on a highly conductive substrate provides a charge transfer channel that leads to photogenerated electron transfer in the order of (TiO2 → MoP → CC), resulting in efficient separation of electron–hole pairs. This design strategy sheds new light on the construction of efficient charge transfer channel based hybrid photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 generation.
