    , Accepted 11th April 2017First published on 24th April 2017AbstractThree conjugated D–A porphyrin dimers (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph linked with diethynylene, diethynylene-dithiophene and diethynylene-phenylene have been developed for bulk heterojunction solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies of 4.50%, 5.50% and 6.42%, respectively, when blended with PC61BM as the electron acceptor material.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention as a promising next-generation green technology because of their flexibility, light weight, and potentially low cost solution processability.1,2 With the rapid progress of OSCs in the past decade, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been achieved for single layer bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices based not only on polymers but also on small molecules.3–7 Since chlorophylls (porphyrin analogues) are natural light-harvesting materials involving photo to energy transfer processes, the study of porphyrins and their analogues on OSCs has been one of the hottest topics since the very early reports on OSC studies.8–10 Porphyrins show high extinction coefficients (ε), and their solubilities, photo and electrochemical properties and interactions with electron acceptor materials can be readily tuned by the peripheral substituents at both meso and β-positions.11,12 In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in solution-processed BHJ OSCs using porphyrin derivatives as electron donor materials since we reported conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) porphyrin donor materials with enhanced PCEs from less than 1% to 9%.13–18 Also, we still believe that porphyrin-based small molecules should play more roles in OSCs with reasonable structure optimization.
Oligoporphyrins usually show higher molar coefficient and longer wavelength absorption coverage than porphyrin monomers, which are beneficial for OSCs. And the conjugated porphyrin dimers usually lead to enhanced PCEs than the corresponding monomers.19–22 However, the PCEs are still low (1–2%), which are much lower than those of the conjugated electron D–A porphyrin monomers possibly because the conjugated D–A chemical structures can not only lower the energy band gaps but also facilitate the intramolecular charge transfer to enhance the OPV performance better than those of none D–A ones.17,23–27 Herein, by appending diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) electron acceptor units with ethynylene linkages to the porphyrin dimers that are bridged by diethynylene, diethynylene-dithiophene and diethynylene-phenylene, we design and synthesize three conjugated D–A porphyrin dimers (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph, respectively (Fig. 1a). Compared with the conjugated porphyrin dimers without acceptor units,19,20 the three compounds show significantly enhanced near infrared (NIR) absorption bands, and their BHJ OSCs with [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the acceptor materials show much higher PCEs of 4.5%, 5.5% and 6.42%, respectively.

The conditions and procedures for synthesizing the three conjugated D–A porphyrin dimers (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph are depicted in the ESI† (Scheme S1). The absorption spectra of the three compounds in solution and thin films are presented in Fig. 1b and c, respectively, and some important optical data are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† In a dilute THF solution, they show porphyrin Soret bands all at ∼470 nm and Q bands at 733 (with a very weak shoulder at about 750 nm), 710 and 733 nm with absorption coefficients of 0.99 × 105, 2.11 × 105 and 2.17 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at the NIR peaks for (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph, respectively. Apparently, all the Q bands are remarkably enhanced compared to the porphyrin dimers without electron acceptor units,20 indicating that the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is significantly improved by the conjugated acceptor units of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP). It is also noted that the Q band of (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph is the highest among the three conjugated D–A dimers compared to their Soret bands, indicating the strongest ICT.
In the solid state, while the Soret bands red-shift to 488, 502 and 493 nm, the red-shifts of the Q bands are 47, 67 and 95 nm to 758, 799 and 830 nm for (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph and (DPP-ZnP-E)2, respectively, indicating that their self-aggregation behaviors in the solid state are different and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph and (DPP-ZnP-E)2 show stronger tendency to pack closer than (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) are calculated from the onset wavelength (λonset) of the absorption spectra in thin films using Eoptg = 1240/λonset (eV) with values of 1.36, 1.45 and 1.41 eV for (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph, respectively.
In order to obtain the information of the frontier orbital energy levels of the three molecules, we investigated their redox behaviours by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile containing 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The onset oxidation (Eox) and reduction (Ered) potentials of (DPP-ZnP-E)2 were 0.66 and −0.94 V vs. Fc/Fc+, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI†), from which the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are calculated to be −5.09 and −3.49 eV according to the empirical formulas EHOMO = −e(φox + 4.8 − φ1/2,FeCp2) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(φred + 4.8 − φ1/2,FeCp2) (eV), respectively. Also, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −4.87 and −3.21 eV for (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T, and −5.03 and −3.34 eV for (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph, respectively. The difference in HOMO energy levels can be mainly ascribed to the different π-bridges with different electron donating abilities in the conjugated backbones. Their electrochemical band gaps are 1.60, 1.66, and 1.69 eV, respectively, confirming that conjugated D–A porphyrin dimers lower the band gaps than those of none D–A ones to some extent.19,20
Solution-processed BHJ devices were fabricated with the three conjugated D–A porphyrin dimers as the electron donor materials and PC61BM as the electron acceptor material with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC61BM/FNEZnP-OE/Al (ITO: indium tin oxide and PEDOT:PSS: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate)). The active layers were spin-cast with chlorobenzene (CB) solutions containing the donor and PC61BM in the weight ratio of 1:1 and 1% pyridine additive, and FNEZnP-OE serves as a cathode interlayer, which we reported previously.28 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2a (others are shown in Fig. S7–S10, ESI†), and the key photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. As seen in Table 1, the devices without any post-treatment based on (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph show low PCEs of only 0.86%, 2.03% and 3.21%, respectively, all with small FF values less than 40%, showing that even without any post-treatment the PCEs based on (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph are still much higher than those based on the porphyrin dimers without acceptor units.20 Furthermore, when the active layers are thermally annealed, the PCEs are enhanced significantly to 4.24%, 5.50% and 6.42%, respectively, contributed by the remarkably improved JSC and FF values, though the VOC values are slightly reduced. Similar to previous reports, the decrease of VOC but the increase of JSC and FF values can be attributed to the crystallinity enhancement of porphyrins.14,29 It is also noted that among all these un-optimized and optimized devices, the (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph-based ones show the best PCEs with the highest JSC and FF values, which can be partially ascribed to the best ICT among the three donors drawn from the absorption spectra. As shown in Table 1, all the devices based on (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T before and after thermal annealing show higher VOC values while (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T has a higher HOMO level, which can also be ascribed to the better crystallinity of (DPP-ZnP-E)2 and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph in the blends, as suggested by the absorption spectra of the pure films and blends since the better crystallinity can reduce the intermolecular distances and increase the HOMO levels, which leads to lower VOC values than those of (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T-based devices.30

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. 2b) of the three optimized devices were measured, from which the JSC values are calculated to be 14.37, 13.46 and 16.34 mA cm−2 for the devices based on (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph, respectively, which agree well with the measured values. As seen in Fig. 2b, all the devices show relatively high photocurrent generation in a wide wavelength range of 300–900 nm. The EQE curve of (DPP-ZnP-E)2-based devices exhibits a broader response range up to 950 nm, but the overall EQE values are relatively low, leading to a similar JSC value with that of (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T-based devices. In contrast, the EQE values of (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph-based OSCs are the highest from 300 to 810 nm especially with the highest EQE value of 68% at 487 nm and 58% at 788 nm, leading to the highest JSC value of 16.34 mA cm−2. We measured the hole mobilities of the three donor/PC61BM blend films using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S12, ESI†): the hole mobilities of (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph are 1.46 × 10−4, 3.35 × 10−4 and 4.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, the device based on the material with a larger hole mobility value shows a higher photovoltaic efficiency.
In order to get some information about molecular aggregation in blend films with PC61BM, the absorption spectra of the blends prepared under the optimized conditions were recorded (Fig. S11, ESI†). Though very weak shoulders can be seen, the main NIR absorption peaks are located at 756, 760 and 789 nm with shoulders at 810, 710 and 730 nm for the blend films of (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph with PC61BM, respectively. Compared to their absorption spectra in solution, the shoulders at ca. 710 and 733 nm could be ascribed to the amorphous states, and the red-shifts of the main NIR peaks are 50 and 55 nm for the blends of (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph, respectively. For the (DPP-ZnP-E)2 blend, the main NIR peak redshifts to 756 nm from 733 nm in solution. Though the redshift is only 23 nm, there is no obvious absorption peak of the amorphous state at ca. 730 nm. Furthermore, the 750 nm shoulder in solution shows a redshift of 60 nm to 810 nm in the blend. These observations are consistent with the conclusion drawn from the absorption spectra in the pure film that (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph and (DPP-ZnP-E)2 can form more ordered self-aggregations than (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T.
In order to investigate the charge generation and transportation properties in the OSCs, the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) of devices was measured (Fig. S13, ESI†) (Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively, and Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage.). When Veff is sufficiently high, Jph becomes saturated (Jsat) and almost all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and subsequently collected by the electrodes. Therefore, Jsat is only limited by the total amount of absorbed incident photons and the ratio Jph/Jsat can provide some information about the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency.31–34
As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), while the Jsat values for all of the devices are quite similar, the Jph values for the devices based on (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph are the largest at a certain Veff value before Jph is saturated, suggesting that (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph-based devices show the highest dissociation efficiency or charge collection efficiency. The higher charge collection efficiency also suggests a lower bimolecular recombination that is responsible for a larger FF value. Furthermore, while the devices based on (DPP-ZnP-E)2 show strong field dependence across the largest bias range and Jph becomes slightly saturated at Veff values more than 1.0 V, the Jph value of the (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph-based devices is almost saturated at a much lower Veff value around 0.4 V, which also suggests that the photo-generated excitons can be more efficiently dissociated into free charge carriers and subsequently collected at the electrode with suppressed bimolecular recombination, thus leading to a larger FF value in (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph-based devices.35
The surface morphology of the optimal active layers was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 3, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the blend films based on (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph are 0.71, 1.35 and 0.46 nm, respectively, indicating the good miscibility of the three donors with the PC61BM acceptor. Especially, not only a smoother surface but also a more bicontinuous phase separation is seen for the (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph:PC61BM blend film, which can provide a larger interface area between the electron donor and acceptor materials for more efficient exciton dissociation, thus leading to a higher JSC value.

In summary, three conjugated D–A porphyrin dimers (DPP-ZnP-E)2, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-2T and (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph were designed and synthesized for solution-processed BHJ OSCs. The three compounds show lower band gaps and broader absorption up to ∼900 nm with enhanced Q bands, and their optimized BHJ OSCs show PCEs of 4.50%, 5.50% and 6.42%, respectively, which are remarkably improved compared to those of solar cells based on the porphyrin dimers without electron acceptor units. Among the three donors, (DPP-ZnP-E)2-Ph shows the strongest NIR absorption peak, and the corresponding devices exhibit the best hole mobility and PCE, indicating that the ICT, self-aggregation, film morphology and therefore OPV performance can be tuned by the bridges of the conjugated D–A porphyrin dimers. Furthermore, considering that different electron acceptor units can be attached to porphyrin dimers, it is possible to design D–A porphyrin dimers with higher performance. Therefore, conjugated D–A porphyrin dimers are promising on OSCs.
