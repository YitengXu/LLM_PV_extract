The discovery of mesoporous metal phosphonate hybrid materials has opened great opportunities for new applications in catalysis, thanks to their homogeneous composition, combined merits of inorganic units and organic groups, and considerable porosity. In this review, we present the fundamentals of designing and optimizing hybrid mesostructures and the recent progress in the fields of metal phosphonate-based catalytic reactions. The catalytic reactions are divided into three categories based on the following elements, i.e., metal sites, organophosphonate moieties, and potential precursors of active metal phosphates. Each section highlights recent advances and the corresponding reactions are discussed in detail. Direct functionalization of the mesopore surfaces of the hybrids, such as sulfonation and supporting, features an elegant way to bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Moreover, remarks on the challenges and perspectives are presented for further exploration of mesoporous metal phosphonate hybrid heterogeneous catalysts.

1. Introduction
Catalysis is of tremendous significance in the areas of industrial production, scientific research, and even human daily life. A number of efforts have been made in the past for the rational design of catalysts so as to achieve desirable catalytic activity and selectivity although recovery of the catalysts was not really a serious concern. Classical homogeneous catalytic systems have been proven to be considerably efficient since they are well defined at the molecular level and readily soluble in reaction medium, ensuring sufficient contact between the catalysts and the reactants,1–5 but removing them from the reaction mixture to avoid contamination of the target products needs expensive and tedious purification procedures. Furthermore, in spite of their intrinsic superiority, the corresponding components usually consist of high-priced noble metal and/or ligands, making it difficult for homogeneous catalysts to find a wide range of applications in industrial processes.6,7 Accordingly, the recovery and reuse of catalysts have become important factors that should be taken into consideration, because of stringent ecological and economical demands from the viewpoints of green chemistry and sustainable environment and energy. To realize the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis synchronously, heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts and exploration of alternative heterogeneous catalysts represent feasible solutions.8,9
The intentional development of structured heterogeneous catalysts, underpinned by the knowledge of basic structure–function relationships, has been the motivation to deliver enhanced catalysis. Solid catalysts of inorganic frameworks with favourable mechanical rigidity and thermal stability including silicate- and phosphate-based molecular sieves,10–12 mesoporous carbons,13,14 carbon nanostructures,15–17 and metal oxides or sulfides18–21 have exhibited practical applicability. For instance, crystalline microporous zeolites have been proven to be extremely successful as catalysts in oil refining, petrochemistry, and organic synthesis for the production of fine and special chemicals.22,23 However, the dimensions and accessibility of the pores were restrained to the sub-nanometer scale; on the other side, materials with extra-large pores or supermicropores and inorganic framework compositions were synthesized,24 but the lack of flexibility of the inorganic networks and their inertness towards further functionalization have prompted researchers to explore organic–inorganic hybrid materials.
The use of hybrid materials composed of intimately cross-linked organic and inorganic building units on the molecular scale aims to integrate the superiority of both components within the backbones, holding promise for the formation of materials with mechanical and structural stability attributed to inorganic compounds and flexibility and functionality characteristic of organic compounds.25 The choice of metal centers and organic linkers can define the framework topology and affect the overall physicochemical functionality of the hybrid skeleton, which in turn can influence the performance of the hybrid materials for chemical, electrochemical, and biochemical activities, as well as the magnetic, electronic, and optical properties, or even a combination of them.26–29 These traits uncover a way to the creation of materials bearing diverse localized active groups or sites, leading to the generation of marvelous multifunctional hybrid materials with unique and unknown properties. Besides, the modulation of their interesting properties can be favoured by the interfacial features present in the hybrids, due to the molecular interaction existing between inorganic and organic phases, which is of paramount significance for catalytic processes in terms of transfer.
Heterogeneous catalysis dependent on organic–inorganic hybrids is quite intriguing as compared with that using purely inorganic catalysts. For the sake of catalytic reaction processes, adjustable functions can be obtained by judiciously selecting the organic bridging groups and inorganic precursors due to the well-aligned sequences of framework compositions.30,31 Moreover, it is probable to mimic the basic principles of natural enzymatic catalysis, wherein weak interactions such as electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between functional groups at fixed distances influence the reactivity of the catalysts.32,33 Mesoporous organosilicas and organo-functionalized mesoporous silicas have been used as efficient heterogeneous catalysts through the introduction of metal sites and organometallic ligands and post-modification. However, their further utilization towards practical applications is prohibited by the high price of organosilica reagents and the unfavourable synthesis strategy that leads to the inferior distribution of catalytic sites and even sacrifice of porosity, which may be due to the incompatibility between the metal sites and organosilica networks. Pyridine, sulfonate, and carboxylate based organic scaffolds have been used to construct organic–inorganic hybrids due to their strong coordinative interaction with metallic centers.34–37 In comparison to these organic linkage counterparts, metal phosphonates exhibit much higher thermal and chemical stability due to the corresponding tetrahedral nature and the strong affinity of organophosphonic ligating linkers to metal ions, making them promising in the fields of catalysis, energy conversion, adsorption, biotechnology and so forth.25,34,35,38–41
The different reactivity of phosphonic coupling molecules leads to structural diversity and physicochemical peculiarities of the resultant hybrid materials. At this juncture, metal phosphonates with especially high specific surface areas, controllable pore size, and large pore volume can contribute to the enhanced performance due to the homogeneous distribution of active sites on the hybrid pore walls. Several tactics have been employed to induce porosity in metal phosphonates. Adjustment of phosphonate linkers, generally involving insertion of non-pillaring phosphonic/phosphoric groups,42 extension of the microscopic dimensions and geometry of polyphosphonic bridging molecules,43–45 and attachment of a secondary functional group,46 provides reasonable methods. Recently, template-free approaches including nanocrystal self-assembly and formation of microemulsion based on preformed metal phosphonate nanoclusters or nanoparticles as building units have been adopted to prepare mesoporous metal phosphonate hybrid materials, wherein weak interactions among the building blocks, including atoms, molecules, and related secondary units are required to direct the assembly process.34,35,47,48 To synthesize mesoporous metal phosphonates with much more controllable mesoporosity, a surfactant-assisted sol–gel methodology has been thoroughly developed for the design of periodic mesoporous materials, in which the surfactant micelle scaffold acts as a lyotropic liquid crystalline phase, and subsequently, the oligomers from the condensation of inorganic/organic precursors condense and polymerize around the arranged micelles, leading to the assembly of an ordered mesostructure. Accordingly, a series of periodic mesoporous metal phosphonate materials with tunable pore size and mesophases can be successfully prepared by simply varying the surfactant types and controlling the synthesis conditions.49–54 One can thus choose the right strategy for the synthesis of mesoporous metal phosphonates, which mainly depends on the ultimate applications.
A number of reviews have summarized the synthesis, characterization, and emerging applications of metal phosphonates.25,31,35,55 However, only limited investigations of metal phosphonates have been carried out in heterogeneous catalysis as compared with their achievement in adsorption and separation. A brief introduction concerning metal phosphonates in the area of catalysis was presented previously,34,35,38 but the elaborate discussion and comparison of the origin of catalytic activities, reaction mechanisms and functional adjustment are still scarcely considered. On the consideration of the peculiarities of the mesoporous organic–inorganic hybrids of metal phosphonates and their recent achievements, this review provides comprehensive understanding of these kinds of heterogeneous hybrid catalysts based on three aspects, i.e., metal site based catalysis, catalytic activities of the phosphonate groups, and the extended functionalities via post-modification which is mainly dependent on homogeneously immobilized organophosphonate linkages, and potential of the synthesized metal phosphates. Here, it is noteworthy that the cooperative effect from both sides is indispensable to an actual reaction process. To facilitate reading of this review, the general synthetic approaches explored to date for the designed construction of mesoporous metal phosphonate hybrid materials are briefly described in the second part of this article. The catalytic reactions involving mesoporous metal phosphonates are summarized and discussed in detail, while the final conclusion part remarks on the future challenges and perspectives. It is suggested that the promising mesoporous heterogeneous metal phosphonate catalysts could receive intense attention from materials scientists and chemists who devote themselves to designing novel systems for burgeoning catalysis.
2. Strategies to introduce mesoporosity
The judicious design of well-defined mesoporous materials with large surface areas and controllable composition of pore walls and the intentional tailoring of mesoporous architectures afford potential application and advances in a diversity of fields including catalysis, adsorption, storage, separation, electronics, and bioapplications. The porous and structural capacities on the nano- or meso-scale can cater to the demands of emerging applications of large molecules. Consequently, scientific researchers across the world have been interested in the exploration and exploitation of mesoporous materials. With regard to classical mesoporous siliceous materials and carbons, the introduction of well-defined mesostructures seems easy since the key factors are widely known, such as surfactant types and their concentrations, system temperature, media, precursors, and so on. Samples synthesized even under similar conditions actually present distinctively distinguishing properties. For mesoporous metal phosphonate hybrid materials, the synthesis is somewhat different from that for inorganic porous materials, but their synthesis processes are still comparable. The use of organophosphonic bridging molecules makes the apparent strategies and the resultant mesoporosity much more abundant. The complicated synthesis systems vary with the change of microenvironment, and a complex combination of simple factors will offer great opportunities for creating different mesoporous architectures. Broadly speaking, extension of the dimensions of phosphonate groups, template-free self-assembly and surfactant-mediated strategies represent the three major routes to prepare mesoporous metal phosphonate materials, which are summarized in Fig. 1. Also, the syntheses, textures and physicochemical properties of mesoporous metal phosphonates are presented in Table 1.

2.1 Extending the dimensions of phosphonate groups
The adjustable properties of the original phosphonic linkages make the synthesis of mesoporous metal phosphonates different from that of mesoporous purely inorganic materials. It is pertinent to mention the layered structures of metal phosphonates, in which aryl- or alkyl-phosphonate molecules are coordinated to metal oxide layers with the aryl or alkyl functional groups tightly situated in the interlamellar spaces.56,57 The phosphonate pillars are too crowded to leave sufficient free spaces in the interlayer regions, so no or poor porosity is expected. As “dilution agents”, some small alkyl or aryl diphosphonic acids were inserted among the phosphonate pillaring groups to induce interlayer porosity.43 However, the resultant pore size is usually limited in the microporous range. Grafting secondary functional groups onto the pillared diphosphonic acids could lead to an increase in the surface area of the resulting hybrid materials, which was attributed to the formation of intralayer voids.46,58 This method was used to overcome the “close-pillar disposition”. This increase in porosity allowed the metal centers and phosphonate functionalities of the metal phosphonate to be accessible to the adsorbed molecules, which could be particularly valuable to catalysis. Amino acid derived phosphonates could be used to form mesoporous architectures of lanthanide phosphonate solids.59 Chiral (S)-N-(phosphonomethyl)proline was reacted with several lanthanides to form isostructural solids with 1D tubular channels about 4 nm in diameter. A large and multidimensional polyphosphonic bridging molecule, 1,3,5,7-tetrakis(4-phenylphosphonic acid) adamantane (TPPA), would disfavour the formation of the layered motif, thus resulting in an open framework.44,45 Through a non-hydrolytic condensation reaction, mesoporous titanium44 and vanadium45 phosphonates could be constructed using their corresponding metal alkoxide precursors. N2 sorption analysis confirmed the high surface area and mesopores with size centered around 3.8 nm of the mesoporous titanium phosphonate hybrid.44
Ligand extension is a direct way to improve the porosity, though the most multidimensional structures of phosphonates, which are not commercially available, complicate their synthetic technologies. Meanwhile, bridging linker expansion tends to reduce the surface areas and pore sizes because of the consequent interpenetrated structures, and dramatically reduces the stability of the hybrid frameworks.60,61 The ordered nanostructures or pores could only be retained with small mesopore sizes or constricted cages.
2.2 Template-free self-assembly
Self-assembly in the absence of any surfactants or templates typically initiates weak interactions among the precursor molecules or the preformed primary phosphonate building blocks,62 followed by ordered attachment to generate mesoporous frameworks. Zirconium phosphites–phosphonates with high surface area and large pore volume were obtained by simply changing the ratios and concentrations of the reagents.63 The formation of interparticle mesoporosity was attributed to the edge–edge interactions between rigid packets of a few pillared α-layers giving rise to stable aggregates with a house-of-cards structure. The preformed nickel phosphate nanoparticles could mediate the self-assembly process to conduct the formation of mesoporous nickel phosphate/phosphonate hybrid microspheres (Fig. 2a and b).64 The accessibility of this method lies in the insolubility of nickel phosphate in water and the nature of phosphonate claw molecules containing pyridinic nitrogen, which could facilitate hydrogen bonding interactions between the phosphate nanoparticles and the slowly formed phosphonates.

Time-dependent UV-vis absorbance spectrum for the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the presence of NiPPH and NaBH4 (c) and the plot of ln(C0/C) versus reaction time (d).64 
The ability of phosphonic groups to strongly coordinate to metal units promotes the deposition of dense metal phosphonates through regular methodologies. An aerogel approach involving sub/supercritical conditions could efficiently prohibit the metal ions and phosphonic linkers to orderly assemble into extended hybrid skeletons, due to the inhibited and mismatched growth and the following gelation in appropriate solvents by moderate heating,65,66 which result in adjustable textural properties and mesoporosity by changing precursor concentrations.
Sol–gel chemistry templated by the formation of micellar lyotropic assemblies generated by amphiphilic precursors has been widely adopted to prepare mesoporous materials.67 The unique hydrolysis properties of metal alkoxides and alkylmetals with or without a co-reactant depending on the desired chemical compositions can lead to fantastic porosity even under relatively mild conditions.68–70 Hierarchically mesoporous titanium phosphonates with mesostructured cellular foam pores were synthesized using tetrabutyl titanate.47 Indeed, the microemulsion generated from the hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate in the multicomponent system of water–alcohol–phosphonic acids served as the porogen. Different sorts of organophosphonic acids would influence the interfacial polymerization behavior and thus the resulting micro-morphology. Mesoporous titanium oxide–phosphonate nanorods could be synthesized using alkyl diphosphonic molecules.48
During the self-assembly processes, the synthesis parameters are of significance in influencing the structural properties of the mesoporous metal phosphonates. Diverse weak interactions on the molecular scale propel the template-free assembly to give mesoporous metal phosphonates. Regardless of the synthetic simplicity, the synthesis processes are difficult to control to some extent and these methods cannot afford the valid capability to adjust the porosity, texture, and even morphologies on demand. A more controllable method is required from the viewpoint of research and practical applications.
2.3 Surfactant assistance for uniform mesopore channels
The synthesis methodology for periodic mesoporous materials features the templating concept that was proposed over twenty years ago. The template-induced route for the formation of mesopores can be divided into two categories. The first one is the so-called hard templating. The prerequisite point of this method is the preformed ordered mesoporous materials with rigid or semi-rigid frameworks. Alternately, the negative replica of the templates can be obtained after filling the precursors into the void spaces. Especially, template removal requires harsh conditions such as calcination and strong acid or base treatment, making it technologically cockamamie, environmentally unfriendly, and not apposite to the preparation of mesoporous organic–inorganic hybrid materials.34,35,71,72 In contrast, the soft templating approach is more versatile, flexible and effective. The self-assembly which occurs during soft templating is a remarkable phenomenon that initiates the structuring of surfactants, precursors, and solvent molecules, and therefore, the mesostructures can be tuned by controlling the system parameters, solvents and the nature of supermolecular template molecules.
It should be noted that the high hydrolysis rate of metallic precursors causes microphase separation in most situations. A recent study has illustrated the roles of pH value and temperature in impacting the condensation and polymerization. Under extremely acidic conditions, the relatively controlled reaction speed could induce the formation of hexagonal aluminum phosphonate mesophases after slowly evaporating the solvents at room temperature.51–53 However, the less condensed and easily hydrolyzed frameworks caused extraction of the as-synthesized hybrids by mild acid treatment unworkable. Low temperature calcination was carried out but it might introduce impurities and destruct the mesophases. By increasing the pH value to around 4, the speed of hydrolysis of inorganic precursors was accelerated while a cryosel bath could create low-temperature conditions for slowing down the hydrolysis and condensation of the reactants.38,39,54
Metallic precursors can be pretreated with some ingeniously selected organic reagents to alleviate hydrolysis and improve interactions with surfactant micelles. Dissolving metal chlorides or nitrates in alcohol could produce metal alkoxide analogues but with a hydrolysis rate slower by several times,73,74 and ethanol with moderate polarity was usually used. A chelating polyalcohol, 2,2′,2′′-nitrilotriethanol (TEAH), could form a complex with aluminum atoms, thus proving its capability of harmonizing the rates of the hydrolytic reactions of the aluminum species in water–phosphonic acid media and the subsequent processes of self-assembly among the resulting inorganic polyanions and the surfactant aggregates.75–77 Also, a series of mesoporous aluminum monophosphonates and diphosphonates were successfully synthesized on the basis of this “atrane route”.76,77 In addition to alcohols, crown ethers of hydrophobic alkyls not only could capture metal ions to effectively isolate the metal cations embedded inside from the organic functionalities and thus to slow down the reaction rate, but also allowed the assembly between surfactants and hybrids, as well as the surrounding coordination expansion.78,79
A great deal of progress has recently been made in the field of mesoporous metal phosphonates. Unlike mesoporous silicas and carbons, the rational synthesis of metal phosphonate hybrids with uniform mesopore channels is a burgeoning area. The rapid hydrolysis of metallic species and the strong coordinating ability of organophosphonic groups prompted us to find the right ways to weaken these effects as much as possible, such as accomplishment via changing the synthetic conditions and adding organic chelates. It should be kept in mind that the key factors for the efficient assemblies of periodic mesophases include the control of the aggregation of precursors, sufficient interactions between oligomers/precursors and surfactants, and suitable size and charge of the building blocks. Additionally, different mesostructures lead to distinct physicochemical characteristics and thereby catalytic performance, although realizing mesostructure regulation is still a challenge in preparing periodic mesoporous hybrid materials. This may be due to the fact that the incompletely condensed hybrid network, the complex coordination chemistry between metal ions and organic bridges and the weak interactions among the organic components may converge to form relatively stable hexagonal phases.54,80–84
A variety of surfactants are capable of templating different mesopore sizes, which are determined by the hydrophobic/hydrophilic volume ratio of supermolecules. Ionic and oligomeric surfactants generally produce small mesopores in the range of 2–5 nm.26,27,51–53,76,77,85–91 Higher molecular weight Pluronic block copolymers can template mesopores 6–10 nm in diameter,39,51 and even larger mesopores using polystyrene–block-poly(oxyethylene) colloidal templates. Note that the judicious choice of suitable synthetic technologies would result in various types of mesostructured micromorphologies, such as nanospheres, nanofibers and films, of which the pore size could be precisely controlled by the involved soft supermolecules. Nonetheless, the shortcoming of the surfactant-assisted route is also apparent, i.e., the pore size is limited to within tens of nanometers, while sol–gel chemistry can create pores in the macroporous region though uncontrollable. Micelles and liquid crystals are virtually dynamic, which are readily altered when changes occurred under the surrounding conditions. Addition of aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons causes the swelling of micelle cores up to some point, which is one way to increase pore size in soft templating.
3. Heterogeneous catalytic applications
The catalytic applications of mesoporous metal phosphonates have been investigated in the past years. In this section, we discuss their potential in oxidation, hydrogenation, addition, asymmetric catalysis, electrocatalysis, and so on, which is presented based on metal sites, phosphonate groups, and the derivatives of metal phosphates. These are summarized in Fig. 3. Some recent progress is presented as follows.
 Fig. 3  A summary of potential heterogeneous catalytic reactions of mesoporous metal phosphonate materials. 
3.1 Metal site based catalysis
Transition and some main group metal elements are typically considered as outstanding metal centers to build metal phosphonate skeletons, due to their valuable capability of gaining and losing electrons and/or the corresponding apparent redox ability. Notably, the water solubility of metal phosphonates decreases with the increase of the valence of the metals.92 With regard to trivalent and tetravalent metal phosphonates, the considerable insolubility and stability permit their use under harsh conditions.

3.1.1 Photocatalysis. 
Much attention has been directed to titanium oxide-based photosensitizers for environmental remediation and energy conversion purposes. In response to the unfavourable band gap of titanium oxides, foreign element doping is an alternative route to extend the light absorption range and reduce the recombination probability of photoinduced electron–hole carriers. Since a variety of guest species can be introduced into the titania framework by using phosphonic acids, mesoporous titanium(IV) phosphonates are suggested to perform well in photocatalysis. With ethylenediamine tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) (EDTMP) being the organophosphonic linker, the band gap value of the hierarchical macro/mesoporous titanium phosphonates showed obvious narrowing compared with that of pure titania.93 The shift of the absorbance onset towards the lower energy region indicated that the titanium phosphonate materials might make better use of solar light, resulting in enhanced performance for organic dye decomposition. The pH value of the synthesis systems was an important factor to tune the band gap energies as pH conditions could affect the polymerization rate of precursors and the condensation degree of the final hybrid frameworks. Weakly alkaline conditions caused inferior photoactivity due to a small surface area.93 The red shift of the absorbance edge of titanium phosphonates as the phosphonic moieties were homogeneously doped demonstrates an impressive photocatalytic behavior.
Hexagonal mesoporous titanium phosphonates synthesized with the assistance of a surfactant were proven to be efficient photocatalysts under light stimulation94 in comparison with the phosphonates prepared in the absence of a surfactant.93 This improvement was attributed to the enhanced absorption in the visible light range and the periodic mesoporosity together with a high surface area, which could provide more active adsorption sites, and thereby increase the efficiency of photoabsorption through multiple scattering and improve mass transfer across the mesopores.95 Interestingly, after treatment with a mixture of organic dyes and heavy metal ions, mesoporous titanium phosphonates showed an even higher activity for the degradation of organic dyes (Fig. 4).94 This could be due to the formation of complexes of metal ions on the surface of the hybrid network, resulting in the emergence of a new broad absorption peak in the visible light region. This could thus give rise to better use of visible light. Also, optimization of the channel structures of mesostructures signifies a crucial way to elevate the catalytic activity.41,96 Cubic mesophases possess finely interconnected pore systems as compared with the hexagonal ones. By changing the molar ratio of the added surfactants and inorganic precursors, the different phases of the mesopores could be transformed into any of the other phases,54 and the resultant cubic mesoporous titanium phosphonates could be employed as useful photocatalysts for the degradation of organic contaminants. These materials are suitable catalysts because of the homogeneous incorporation of phosphors and carbon and the large surface area with highly-structured mesoporosity.

(d) Plot of one-pot heavy metal ion adsorption in wastewater treatment as well as Rhodamine B photodegradation by using PMTP-1 under simulated solar light irradiation.94 
One further step based on phosphonate-mediated photocatalysis is to find their qualification as photoanode materials in the photoelectrochemical field, in which photogenerated electrons transfer to the external circuit while separated holes from photosensitizers act as oxidants to oxidize electrolytes. Titanium phosphonate materials with a mesoscopic void space and a self-assembled nanostructure were synthesized using conjugated benzene-1,3,5-triphosphonic acid.97 Photosensitizer molecules (Rose Bengal) could be loaded into the mesopores via impregnation, demonstrating higher carrier mobility for photocurrent generation than that of other titanium oxide based nanomaterials. The traditional preparation of dye-sensitized electrodes of solar cells is accomplished by the adsorption of dye molecules onto pre-synthesized semiconductor membranes, which usually leads to a very low loading amount of photosensitive molecules.98 The over increase of the loading amount would cause dye aggregation, and the poor contact between the aggregated dye molecules and the photoanode materials could prohibit the transmission of photoelectrons. The sol–gel method allowed the homogeneous molecular-level penetration of large π-aromatic photosensitive groups, such as phthalocyanines with sulfonic or phosphonic acid groups, into the mesoporous network of the photoanode materials and the achievement of an unprecedented high loading amount of organic dyes, resulting in a significantly large loading amount of organic dyes, but without the disadvantages of dye aggregation and poor electron transmission caused by the isolation of single-dye centers by the surrounding semiconductor oligomers.99 The resultant mesoporous hybrids were proven to be efficient photocurrent conductors and better electrode materials than traditional dye-modified titania materials under the same experimental conditions. Stability is a key index as well from a practical point of view of solar cells. Phosphonic linkers were found to represent promising alternatives due to their higher affinity towards the surfaces of metal oxide semiconductors and stronger binding ability compared to carboxylic grafting groups,100,101 and would thus give better long-term stability of DSSCs.


3.1.2 Carbonyl activation. 
Recently, it has been reported that tin-doped molecular sieves could selectively activate carbonyl groups for oxidization due to their suitable Lewis acidity.102–104 The Baeyer–Villiger (BV) oxidation is the oxidative cleavage of a carbon–carbon bond adjacent to a carbonyl group, converting ketones into more complex and valuable esters and lactones. Mesoporous tin phosphonate materials were proven to have outstanding efficiency for BV oxidization reactions in the presence of suitable oxidants.105,106 The most fascinating observation on these hybrid catalysts was that the reaction proceeds efficiently in the absence of any organic solvents since the use of hazardous and ecologically unattractive organic solvents would produce carboxylic acid salts as by-products. Tin phosphonates with surface areas less than 400 m2 g−1 could catalyze the BV reaction in the presence of H2O2 to give high conversion and selectivity, for example, a conversion of 68% for cyclohexanone.105 Increasing the surface area could boost the catalytic activity. Without using any peroxide, micro- and meso-porous tin phosphonates with a high surface area of 723 m2 g−1 could achieve a relatively higher yield of 74% with respect to the initial yield for cyclohexanone with the help of molecular oxygen.106 There was no perceivable change in the activity of the catalysts during the recycling tests, revealing the stability of the heterogeneous hybrid materials. In the case of the Hantzsch ester synthesis reaction to produce 1,4-dihydropyridines,107 an important biological compound for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the CO group of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound could be activated by positively charged metallic Sn on the hybrid pore walls that simultaneously increase the nucleophilicity of CC, leading to the formation of 1,4-dihydropyridines with exclusive selectivity over 2-arylpyridines or 1,2-dihydropyridines under mild conditions.108
Mesoporous self-assembled hybrid molybdenum phosphonate nanomaterials showed high catalytic activity and recycling efficiency for the synthesis of bioactive 2-aryl benzimidazoles by the green and efficient one-pot condensation reaction of o-phenylenediamine and substituted aromatic aldehydes in excellent yields at room temperature, in which molybdenum(V) with vacant d orbitals in the hybrid framework played a crucial role in activating the carbonyl carbon of the substituted aldehydes.109 The corresponding high yield was positively correlated with the surface area. As the surface area decreased, mass transport through the porous channel was obviously impeded, which is reflected in the isolated yield of the product. Moreover, the number and uniformity of the catalytically active sites increased gradually with the decrease of the particle size. In contrast, iron phosphonate materials were catalytically active towards the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives (Fig. 5),110 but with lower activity compared with their molybdenum phosphonate counterparts.109 This might be related to the moderate Lewis acidic strength of molybdenum due to its larger atomic radius than that of iron atoms. It was speculated that the interaction between the catalyst and the carbonyl oxygen was strong enough to provide the effect of the substituents, while the amine groups of o-phenylenediamine were attached on the carbonyl carbon.109 The tertiary amine groups could help to eliminate the protons in the water-removal step, and the synergistic effect of the iron center and tertiary amine groups promoted the catalysis of the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives.
 Fig. 5  Supposed mechanism for the synthesis of benzimidazoles. The iron center in the catalyst activated the aromatic aldehyde and facilitated the attack of the amine. The tertiary amine groups in the catalyst helped to eliminate the protons in the water-removal step. The iron center activated the molecule for the second attack of the amine. Thus, the cooperative effect of iron and the tertiary amines in the catalyst induced the catalysis of the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives.110 
Environmentally friendly biodiesels are appropriate substitutes for the traditional fossil fuels in terms of sustainable development. Generally, biodiesels can be produced through acid-catalyzed esterification of long chain fatty acids with alcohols and base-promoted transesterification.111 Nevertheless, industrial processes using homogeneous catalysts are confronted with intractable drawbacks because of substantial generation of by-products and neutralization and separation problems.112 It is pertinent to mention that organic–inorganic iron phosphonates could fit the qualification in catalytic transesterification reactions under solvent-free conditions.113 It was proposed that the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon of the reactant ester group was the main driving force of the reaction. The conversion to the lower alkyl-substituted ester diminished with a decrease in the electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent on the ethyl-substituted acid group. Further optimization of the mesoporosity of iron phosphonates through a surfactant-assisted strategy may improve the mass transport capability so as to improve the apparent catalytic performance.114,115 Indeed, mesoporous tin phosphonate hybrids with crystalline pore walls performed well for the catalytic esterification of long chain fatty acids with methanol under mild reaction conditions.116 The catalytic reactions were found to be much faster as compared with those using homogeneous and heterogeneous tin-based catalysts.112 On one hand, the surface Lewis acidity made contributions to the catalytic activity; on the other hand, the suitable polarity of the crystalline pores facilitated the diffusion of polar methanol molecules across the mesopores.39


3.1.3 Catalytic hydrogenation and oxidation. 
Inspired by catalytic hydrogenation reactions using nickel nanosols as catalysts,117,118 mesoporous nickel phosphonate materials have been explored to reduce nitroarenes to anilines in the presence of sodium borohydride as a reducing agent much recently.64,119 According to the nickel phosphate-mediated self-assembly process, the synthesized mesoporous nickel phosphate/phosphonate microspheres exhibited excellent capacity for the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol under ambient conditions (Fig. 2c and d),64 which was even comparable with that of some noble metal nanocatalysts.120 The good hydrogenation capability was also confirmed by the reduction of 5-nitroisophthalate to 5-aminoisophthalate.119
Within the same group as nickel in the periodic table of elements, cobalt phosphonates were found to efficiently decompose organic contaminants with sulfate radicals of considerable reaction kinetics and thermodynamics.121 Therein, the tightly integrated divalent cobalt inside the hybrid networks exhibited strong activity towards activation of peroxymonosulphate to generate sulfate radicals, which possessed a more powerful oxidizing ability towards the decomposition of organic molecules as compared with hydroxyl radicals from H2O.122 The difference between the two radicals lies in the abilities of their redox partners as leaving groups, in which the bisulfate and sulfate ions are for the sulfate radical and the water molecule for the hydroxyl radical. Also, the hollow microstructures resulting from the self-templated microemulsion effect121,123 presented abundant active sites and thus promoted efficient adsorption and diffusion of reaction molecules to show a superior catalytic efficiency. The mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis was considered to involve a single electron transfer process, the oxidation of Co(II) with peroxymonosulfate and the formation of sulfate radicals as well as the reduction of Co(III) and the generation of peroxymonosulfate radicals.
Nonetheless, the mild oxidizing ability of H2O2 makes other porous metal phosphonates become potential heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation of aldehydes and olefins. Organic–inorganic hybrid tin phosphonate materials with mesoporous voids could effectively catalyze the radical polymerization of styrene at room temperature in the presence of aqueous H2O2 as an initiator under solvent-free conditions, whereas in the presence of an aprotic solvent, they facilitated the partial oxidation of styrene.124 The stability of the hydroxyl radicals formed during the polymerization reaction played an important role in the polymerization of styrene, and the absence of a solvent could stabilize the hydroxyl radicals due to the acidic nature of neat H2O2. The possible formation of tin hydroperoxo species at the hybrid surface in the presence of an aprotic solvent and H2O2 could facilitate the partial oxidation of styrene via initial epoxidation to styrene oxide,125,126 which underwent rearrangement and further oxidation to yield phenyl acetaldehyde and acetophenone.
Chromium oxophenylphosphate of fine microporosity and mesoporosity showed good catalytic activity in the liquid phase partial oxidation of aldehydes to the respective acids in the presence of dilute aqueous H2O2 as an oxidant at room temperature, accompanied with certain stability after three times of cycling experiments.127 In the presence of both the catalyst and peroxide, about 70% conversion of cinnamaldehyde was achieved.
Mesoporous vanadium phosphonate materials, constructed from multidimensionally dendritic tetraphosphonates without the use of any surfactant, could perform as excellent catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of benzylic alcohols with high reactivity and shape selectivity.128 The oxidation generally proceeded very smoothly with the formation of the corresponding benzylic aldehydes with high conversion and selectivity. Neither benzoic acid, a product of benzaldehyde over-oxidation, nor ethers from acid condensation of the benzylic alcohol substrates, were found in significant amounts as products in the reaction mixture.
A functionalized pore system with various metal nodes offers an invitation to use these nanoconfined spaces as nanoreactors, thus creating advanced mesoporous nanocomposites with rationally contrivable interfaces. In general, the catalytic activity mainly originating from the homogeneously distributed metal sites in the hybrid frameworks is closely relevant to the strength of Lewis acidity and the redox potential of the metal elements with multiple valences. Some mesoporous metal phosphonates have shown comparable catalytic acidity to the corresponding homogeneous metallic catalysts, which are sometimes inspired by the catalytic characteristics of metallic salts and their coordination compounds, metal oxides and phosphates. A second metal center is reasonable to be introduced into the phosphonate networks, and the mesoporous hybrids with two metals may facilitate catalytic applications due to improved features such as their multifunctional composition. The unique metal–metal and metal–support interactions may induce interesting catalytic activity and stability. However, to date, although a great diversity of phosphonate hybrid materials with various metallic nodes have been prepared on the basis of the gradually established metal phosphonate chemistry, catalysis supported by metal phosphonate materials remains in its infancy. Modifying and matching different factors to obtain further improvement of the catalytic activities and achieve a wider scope of catalytic properties have always been the aim of the synthesis of heterogeneous metal phosphonate catalysts.

3.2 Catalysis based on phosphonate groups
The interesting coordination chemistry of phosphonate ligands and the diverse types derived from nature or human-assisted synthesis have endowed mesoporous metal phosphonates with extensive capabilities for catalysis including acidity/alkalinity and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. It is viable to induce chemo-, regio-, stereo- and/or enantio-selectivity in the restricted space available. Post-modification on the integrated phosphonate bridging groups makes this area even further and deeper.

3.2.1 Ion exchange. 
Ion-exchange materials are very common for inorganic materials such as aluminosilicate zeolites, and attempts to realize the exchange of cations or anions can make the resultant catalyst suitable for the field of environmentally-friendly catalysis.129,130 General approaches to adjust the ion exchange ability of mesoporous metal phosphonates are illustrated in Fig. 6. For mesoporous metal phosphonates, the H+ exchange capacity was usually limited in conventional synthesis methods. Note that the H+ exchange capacity of these materials is derived from defective P–OH groups in the resultant solids,12 while the condensation between P–OH and metal ions often resulted in the extensive formation of P–O–Me (Me = Ti, Zr, V, Al, Sn, Fe, etc.) bonding modes instead of defective P–OH.131 The H+ exchange capacity substantially reflects the acid content, and acid content is one of the key elements to determine the catalytic activity and efficiency. One simple route to increase the exchange ability is to regulate the molar ratio of the inorganic and organophosphonic precursors.113 The atomic ratio of P and Fe could be varied from 0.50 to 0.59 in the series of the synthesized iron phosphonates by changing the P/Fe ratio in the range of 1 to 4. The uncoordinated phosphonic groups would exist in the form of defected P–OH in the porous architectures. The actual ion exchange capacity could be determined with a titration curve using NaOH. Mesostructured zirconium organophosphonates synthesized with the assistance of the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16TABr) displayed an ion exchange capacity of 1.65 mmol g−1, which was active in the acid-catalyzed synthesis of methyl-2,3-o-isopropylidene-β-D-ribofuranoside from D-ribose.132 This catalytic performance was comparable to that of liquid acid HCl and commercial ion-exchange resin NKC-9. The excellent catalytic activity could be attributed to the high surface area, which was beneficial for the distribution of the active sites and their exposure so that the reactants can readily attach to them, and the mesopores aided in the acceleration of mass transfer.
 Fig. 6  A summary of the general routes to enhance the ion exchange ability of mesoporous metal phosphonate hybrids. 
However, increasing the H+ exchange capacity of the resultant mesoporous metal phosphonates by adjusting the P/metal ratio is quite limited.133 In order to achieve a high concentration of acid in the desired metal phosphonates, a series of alkyl amines were used as protecting groups during the condensation process, based on the reversible reaction between alkyl amines and P–OH groups in the phosphonic bridging molecules.134 The alkyl amines first partially occupied the P–OH sites by acid–base reactions, followed by condensation between the added alkoxides and residual P–OH and PO groups. Extraction with HCl finally released the P–OH defects of the resultant solids, leading to a high acid content. However, in the absence of amines, the P/Ti ratio reached a plateau of 1.35–1.51 when the ratio of added P/Ti was larger than 1.75, due to the limit of the coordination ability of titanium with phosphonic acids. When ammonia was used instead of alkyl amines, the enhancement effect was hardly detected, probably because the inorganic amine was too volatile to form relatively stable bonds with P–OH in the competitive reaction with alkoxides. Remarkably, the resulting ion exchange ability was much higher than that of their other counterparts synthesized via other conventional methods.108,113,124,132 Taking the condensation reaction of D-ribose with methanol and acetone as an example, the yield of methyl-2,3-o-isopropylidene-β-D-ribofuranoside surpassed that of mesoporous zirconium phosphonate,132 implying the effectiveness of organic amine pre-protection. On the contrary, after treatment with NaOH aqueous solution, zirconium phosphonates could be used as solid basic catalysts for the Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with diethyl malonate or malononitrile and cyclohexanone with malononitrile under mild reaction conditions, presenting high catalytic activity with valuable stability and recyclability.135
The exclusive use of mesoporous metal phosphonates based on ion exchange can be promising for cycloaddition reactions which involve small-membered ring compounds and CO2, such as aziridines to oxazolidinones and epoxides to cyclic carbonates, both of which are vital intermediates for the production of industrial and pharmaceutical chemicals. Carboxylate metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) could catalyse these cycloaddition reactions.136–139 With the analogous hybrid networks of higher stability, the defective P–OH groups of mesoporous zirconium phosphonates could activate aziridine molecules, followed by a nucleophilic attack of CO2 to produce carbamates, showing outstanding activity, selectivity, and recyclability.140 The amino groups incorporated into the phosphonate linkages could activate the inert CO2, thus boosting the reaction conditions and lessening the reaction time, while preserving high conversion, yield, and regioselectivity.141 In other words, bifunctional hybrid catalysts containing moderate Lewis acidic and basic sites are preferred in the CO2 cycloaddition reactions.
However, further application of pristine metal phosphonates may be confined to the finite open metal sites and weak functional organic sites to a certain extent. Some functionalization methods have been applied to the mesoporous metal phosphonates to achieve high acid content and acid strength for efficient acid catalysis. Due to the hybrid nature, the organic fragments could be easily tailored by applying classical organic chemistry, for example, the sulfonation of alkyl or aryl groups in mesoporous metal phosphonates.
It has been amply demonstrated that mesoporous phosphonates, constructed from phenyl- containing phosphonic acids, are readily sulfonated.142–145 In the anhydrous state, the sulfonated porous biphenylphosphonates have been shown to be nearly superacids with roughly the acid strength of concentrated sulfuric acid,142 making them applicable to esterification reactions. The sulfonated mesoporous zinc phosphonates possessed high activity and recycling efficiency for the synthesis of different biodiesel compounds via esterification of long chain monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids using methanol as both the reactant and solvent at room temperature.145 Ordered mesoporous titanium phosphonate hybrid materials were functionalized by sulfonation with chlorosulfonic acid to form stable hydrosulfated esters, indicative of a strong solid acid,146 showing a much higher conversion (87.3%) than the unfunctionalized materials (4.9%) in the esterification of oleic acid and methanol for biodiesel production under ambient conditions. The relatively milder esterification conditions for the grafted sulfonate groups than those for pristine metal phosphonate Lewis acid catalysts could be responsible for the stronger acidity of Brönsted acid sites.147,148
From the viewpoint of sulfonate-mediated catalytic mechanisms, the sulfonation route would increase the hydrophilicity and create a slight positive charge on the carbonyl carbon by protonating the adjacent oxygen atom. The nucleophilic alcohol attacked the activated carbonyl carbon, thus producing water and esters. In fact, the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the mesoporous metal phosphonates can be intentionally tuned by incorporating different organophosphonic linkers,149,150 and as such, the catalytic activity and selectivity that are only confined to acid catalysis can be rationally adjusted to some extent. On the other hand, the stability of mesoporous metal phosphonates, due to the strong coordination between the phosphonate groups and metal atoms, makes them potentially applicable as water-tolerant catalysts to reactions such as ester hydrolysis.34,35,146,151,152 From the viewpoint of sulfonation processes, the limited chemical stability of metal phosphonate hybrids does not enable harsh functionalization conditions due to the risk of destroying the framework. In this sense, the use of acid-bound agents, such as pyridine146 and triflic anhydride,153 could circumvent this drawback of hybrid framework sensitivity and allow sulfonation of the mesopore surfaces at the same time.


3.2.2 Supported catalysts. 
The organophosphonate bridging moieties can immobilize a great number of metal ions on the basis of host–guest acid–base interaction. Combined with the mesoporous structures and large surface areas, a novel type of metal phosphonate-based supported catalyst can be envisioned. After Fe3+ was intercalated and coordinated to nitrogen and carbonyl groups inside the porous walls, the Fe3+-incorporated zirconium phosphonates could be used as catalysts for oxidation of formaldehyde in the presence of hydrogen peroxide,154 wherein the loaded Fe3+ could activate H2O2 to produce highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals125,155–157 towards formaldehyde oxidation.154 Similarly, immobilization of Co2+ on periodic mesoporous aluminum phosphonates could realize the heterogenization of the homogeneous high-performance modified Fenton reaction for oxidation decomposition of organic contaminants (e.g. phenol) in the presence of peroxymonosulfate.149 Likewise, noble metal ions could be immobilized onto the hybrid surface.158–160 Pd2+-complexed zirconium phosphonate materials possessed good activities for the hydrogenation of the carbon–carbon double bond.160 Here, the hydrogenation reactions were carried out easily in some solvents with an intermediate dielectric constant including alcohol, acetone and especially methanol. However, the palladium complexes lost their catalytic activities for hydrogenation in some solvents with a high or low dielectric constant such as glycol and chloroform. The solvent effect might contribute to the solubility and mutual solubility of catalytic centers in the palladium complexes.
Noble metals have been known for their catalytic performance. What is noteworthy is that the coordinated noble metal ions can be further reduced to nanoparticles or nanoclusters within the porous metal phosphonate matrices.159,161,162 Encapsulation of noble metal nanoparticles inside the metal phosphonate frameworks may extend their applications in catalysis by catalytic spillover. The size of loaded nanoparticles could be controlled by the synthesis techniques, i.e., reductant types and annealing temperatures.161 The use of alcohols could be attempted for large particles, while calcination would be preferred for small particles. The binding sites were no longer occupied after reduction and were available for further coordination. Increasing the reduction temperature had no evident effect on the final size of the nanoparticles, signifying that their growth was limited by the pore structure of the phosphonate matrix that would prevent nanoparticles from aggregation.161 This provides a simple way to control the size of the loaded active components. Colloidal Pt has been found to be an ideal catalyst for the reduction of water to hydrogen gas.163,164 The Pt nanoparticles inserted into the phosphonate substrate produce hydrogen photochemically from water under ultraviolet light illumination.159 The average rate of H2 production was 0.15 mL h−1 with a lower limit quantum yield of 4% based only on the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum in the presence of a sacrificial reductant. Disappointingly, the usefulness of these materials is limited to UV light, and strong UV light eventually destroys the system after long-term exposure. It is urgently required to optimize the system and design materials that absorb in the middle of the visible spectrum.
The homogeneous arrangement of phosphonate functional groups inside the hybrid walls realizes the monolayer adsorption behaviour of metal ions with high uniformity.38,54,64,87,118,123 Also, the doping effect of organophosphorus sources can extend the absorbance spectrum of titanium oxide up to the visible light region.47,93,133 Furthermore, the construction of heterojunction structures at the semiconductor interface is suggested to enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs during the photocatalytic process.17,20,165,166 Thereafter, mesoporous phosphonate–titania hybrid materials were prepared with the use of ATMP as the grafting group and triblock copolymer F127 as the template.167 The homogeneously anchored ATMP on the mesoporous walls allowed monolayer adsorption of Zn2+ by extensive coordination. Highly dispersed photoactive ZnO nanoparticles were then formed through the reaction with stoichiometric NaOH and a low-temperature annealing procedure (Fig. 7a). The resultant ZnO-coupled mesoporous phosphonated titanium oxide photocatalysts exhibited better photocatalytic activity and stability in the photodegradation of Rhodamine B under both UV and visible light irradiation than pristine mesoporous phosphonate titania, commercial titania P25, and mesoporous ZnO/titania. Similarly, the adsorbed metal ions could be directly oxidized to active metal oxides through high-temperature calcination, and the final supported materials could find their use in the area of catalytic oxidation.168,169 To make the high distribution of CuO nanoparticles, the Cu2+-saturated hexagonal mesoporous titanium phosphonate microspheres with high thermal stability underwent a high-temperature calcination process with the periodic mesostructures being hardly destroyed (Fig. 7b).170 The density and distribution of the surface organic functional groups could be tuned, which allowed facile adjustment of the dispersion of Cu2+ and the final CuO loading contents. Catalytic CO oxidation was taken as the probe reaction, and the CuO-supported mesoporous titanium phosphonates presented high catalytic activity and significant stability.

Metal ions or their derivatives including metals and oxides can be loaded onto mesoporous metal phosphonates, in which the coordination interaction initially promotes the supporting process and the homogeneous organic units allow for uniform dispersion. The strong interaction between hybrid supports and active components ensures the stability of the coupled catalysts. The high specific surface area and tunable pore size make the loaded active components adjustable concerning the amount and size. With regard to photocatalysis, metal sulfides and selenides generally possess narrower band gap compared with oxides, making sulfides and selenides promising for environmental remediation and photoelectric conversion on the condition that they are immobilized on suitable mesoporous metal phosphonate nanocomposites.
Although heterogeneous catalysts show superiorities in stability and reusability, the inferior catalytic activity in comparison with that of homogeneous catalytic systems should not be neglected. Consequently, based on the organosolubility of zirconium phosphonates designed recently,171–173 a novel type of recoverable and reusable zirconium phosphonate-supported Pd catalyst was reported using the concept of one-phase catalysis and two-phase separation (Fig. 8).174 The original zirconium phosphonates were readily soluble in CHCl3 and THF, whereas the supported Pd catalysts were only soluble in THF, and thus homogeneous catalysis was achieved in THF and the catalysts could be recycled by means of solid/liquid separation upon the addition of poor solvents such as petroleum ether after completion of the reaction.175 Their organosoluble properties made them suitable for homogeneous Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions of various substituted aryl bromides with arylboronic acids. Attractively, due to their organosolubility, homogeneity and the small size of Pd particles embedded in the zirconium phosphonate matrix, the supported palladium catalysts possessed high catalytic activities even at room temperature. This method can be easily extended to other metal catalysts.
 Fig. 8  Scheme of synthetic route to zirconium phosphonate-supported Pd catalysts.175 
Currently, mesoporous metal phosphonates have specialized functionality as a new category of materials for bioapplications, such as biosensing, bioimaging, drug delivery, and immobilization of enzymes and proteins.26,27,123,150,176–181 Remarkably, enzymes are natural catalysts, featuring high reactivity, selectivity, and specificity under mild conditions, and enzymatic catalysis has long been of great interest to chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries,181 though the use of enzymes for practical applications is often hindered by their low operational stability, difficult recovery, and lack of reusability under operational conditions.182 Immobilizing enzymes onto the mesoporous materials, which can improve enzyme stability, facilitate separation and recycling, and maintain the catalytic activity and selectivity, has been studied.181–183 A further step would bring about enzymatic activities of the biocatalysts and thus target products would be obtained. Mesoporous zirconium organophosphonates with tunable mesopores, high surface area and large pore volume exhibited high adsorption capacity for lysozymes and papain, accompanied by rapid adsorption equilibrium speed.177 The adsorption process involves physical surface interactions between the support matrix and the enzymes and can be driven by combined hydrogen bonding, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic effects. For instance, the loading amount of lysozymes for hierarchically porous aluminum phosphonates could be easily adjusted by using phosphonic precursors with different lengths of alkyl chains, noting that the longer the alkyl chain is, the higher the loading capacity reaches.151 Yet, these physical interactions alone are not enough to keep the enzyme from desorbing from the support during catalysis. To improve the interactions, additional groups such as carboxyl and amino, which could bind the enzymes tightly through covalent attachment involving amino acid residues of the enzymes, are introduced into the metal phosphonates. However, with regard to the mesoporous metal phosphonates, reports concerning these areas are still scarce, and subsequent research on this unexplored area is suggested.


3.2.3 Heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis. 
Asymmetric catalysis is of great importance for enantioselective synthesis of chemical compounds due to their critical significance for the pharmaceutical industry.184 Chirality in metal phosphonates may offer new opportunities for applications beyond the traditional fields of chirality. Under this circumstance, inspired by L-proline and its derivatives185 widely used as organic catalysts for a wide range of enantioselective transformations, mesoporous metal phosphonates have been investigated as supports for immobilization of covalently linked chiral organic catalysts on the basis of the L-proline moiety. Zirconium phosphonate-supported L-proline prepared by using (4R)-4-(phosphonooxy)-L-proline was tested in the direct asymmetric aldol addition of cyclohexanones to p-nitrobenzaldehydes, showing high diastereoselectivity (anti/syn up to 94:6) and high enantiomeric excess (ee) up to 97% (Fig. 9).186 A critical issue related to the unsatisfactory recoverability and reusability of the solid catalyst was due to the hydrolysis of the phosphate ester bond that linked L-proline to the host matrix. If a more stable phosphonate linkage was used to connect L-proline, no loss in activity and reproducible anti/syn and ee values were achieved after six cycles (Fig. 9).187 Cinchonidine with different arm lengths covalently immobilized onto the backbone of mesoporous zirconium phosphonate could be used for the preliminarily enantioselective addition of diethyl zinc to various aldehydes, which could be reused ten times without loss in the yield and enantiomeric excess.188 Chiral salen Mn(III), exhibiting excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity for the asymmetric epoxidation of various unfunctionalized olefins,189 was proven to be an active chiral component grafted on porous metal phosphonates.190 By grafting of diamines or polyamines on zirconium phosphonates and subsequent axial coordination with chiral salen Mn(III) complexes, the coupled hybrids exhibited great activity and enantioselectivity in the asymmetric epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins.190 Especially, in the epoxidation of α-methylstyrene, both the conversion and ee could exceed 99%.

In spite of the catalytic activity and stability of the immobilized chiral units, the synthetic processes remain complicated due to multiple steps such as pre-functionalization and immobilization. Amorphous zirconium phosphonates containing chiral functionalities such as 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol or 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl were prepared and used as efficient heterogeneous catalysts in the stereoselective addition of diethyl zinc to benzaldehyde, aldol condensation and hydrogenation of aromatic ketones and β-keto esters, showing a high level of enantioselectivity.191,192 A chiral borane of layered α-zirconium-N-(m-sulfophenyl)-L-valine phosphonate methanephosphonate was used in the asymmetric Mukaiyama aldol reaction.193 A porous, homochiral titanium phosphonate material based on a tripodal peptide scaffold was used as a heterogeneous reaction medium for the enantioselective hydration of styrene oxide.194 Thereafter, the encapsulation of achiral salen Mn(III) within the homochiral mesoporous titanium phosphonate resulted in a new heterogeneous asymmetric catalyst for the formation of the S-epoxide with high enantioselectivity and effective catalyst recovery.195
Direct grafting of chiral moieties and introduction of phosphonate-based chiral groups have led to the generation of plentiful porous metal phosphonates. Noticeably, previous studies about chiral metal phosphonates for asymmetric catalysis are still hindered by their inadequate mesoporosity and specific surface areas. Regarding the formation of chiral superstructures, perhaps the most well-known and well-studied system is the formation of chiral mesoporous silica.196–198 Chiral mesoporous siliceous materials can be created by using achiral or chiral surfactants.199 Since the surfactant-assisted synthesis methodology of mesoporous metal phosphonates actually refers to that of mesoporous siliceous materials, it can be assumed that chiral mesoporous phosphonates could be prepared in the presence of achiral surfactants or chiral phosphonate molecules and achiral surfactants, which can further enhance their asymmetric catalytic performance due to the maintenance of well-developed porosity at the level of fine pore systems.

4. Potential precursors of metal phosphates
Considering the intimate relationship between metal phosphonates and metal phosphates, mesoporous metal phosphonates may act as precursors for the preparation of metal phosphate counterparts with interesting structures and novel properties. The walls of metal phosphate molecular sieves are composed of oxygen atoms, which are larger than the metal and phosphorus atoms. The character of the micropore, therefore, is fundamentally determined by the arrangement of the oxygen atoms and the elements incorporated into the framework. However, the microporosity and accessibility are confined to small molecules. Calcination of metal phosphonates was validated to be an efficient way to prepare mesoporous metal phosphates,54,200–203 in which the organic parts of the phosphonates are released, leaving the porous inorganic phosphate networks. Alternatively, calcination of mesoporous metal phosphonates in an appropriate range of temperature, usually around that of the decomposition of the hybrid framework composition, can lead to the formation of “reproducible” mesoporous scaffolds of the metal phosphate walls,94 representing a feasible route to prepare mesoporous phosphates.
Nowadays, increasing demands have stimulated tremendous interest in alternative energy conversion and storage systems including metal–air batteries and fuel cell devices that are all intensively reminiscent of electrocatalytic processes, such as oxygen evolution reaction.204,205 A key technical challenge for promoting the oxidative half-reaction which splits water to oxygen and protons is the discovery of efficient catalysts.206 However, many of the most promising results have been provided by noble metals (compounds and oxides of iridium and ruthenium) and expensive graphene-based nanostructures.207–211 Significantly, the voltage that is required to attain a given catalytic activity, referred to as overpotential, limits the electrocatalytic efficiency. Along these lines, considerable attention has been focused on cobalt-based materials and related compounds, and particular interest was sparked by a series of recent reports by Nocera and co-workers on cobalt phosphate materials containing oxyhydroxide layers that operate as electrocatalytic water-splitting catalysts.212–219 Electrokinetic studies suggested a mechanism involving a rapid, one-electron, one-proton equilibrium between Co(III)–OH and Co(IV)–O, in which a phosphate species was the proton acceptor, followed by a chemical turnover-limiting process involving oxygen–oxygen bond coupling.213–215 Interestingly, the self-repair peculiarity of the phosphates ensured the long-term stability of the catalyst systems. Nanostructured Co(PO3)2 materials derived from thermal processing of a molecular precursor could be decorated on nickel electrodes and further evaluated as anodes for water oxidation electrocatalysis in nearly neutral phosphate-buffered water (Fig. 10).219 Catalytic onset occurred at an overpotential of about 310 mV, which was 100 mV lower than those observed for Co3O4 nanoparticles with a comparable surface area and cobalt phosphate thin film catalysts (CoPi)212 under identical conditions. A per-metal turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.10–0.21 s−1 was observed at an overpotential of 440 mV, which was comparable to the highest rate reported for a first-row metal heterogeneous catalyst. Spectroscopic studies revealed that the surface of the Co(PO3)2-based electrocatalyst underwent restructuring during electrocatalysis, resulting in bound CoOx species supported by the underlying Co(PO3)2 structure. The anions in the catalyst material, as well as the nature of the interaction between the catalytic, surface-bound species and the support material appeared to play roles in water oxidation catalysis. Investigations of cobalt-based inorganic materials with a range of anions should help to develop structure–function relationships and pave the way to the discovery of more efficient catalysts. One should keep in mind that cobalt phosphates are usually operated in neutral solutions and exhibit instability under strongly acidic and basic conditions, making them promising in natural environments. An electrolyte environment that has good proton-accepting properties is favourable for sustained catalyst activity at an appreciable current density, while the phosphate electrolyte is an efficient proton carrier and can preserve a stable local pH environment for high catalytic activity.220 Additionally, it functions as an acceptor of the protons derived from water oxidation and participates in the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) activation of oxygen (Fig. 10). Other alternative electrolytes that are able to support catalysis are desirable as long they have sufficient proton-accepting capacity in the pH region of interest and are stable under the conditions of catalysis.

Catalytic onset of the nanostructured Co(PO3)2 catalyst at a significantly lower potential was observed. The nonlinearity of the catalytic current at high overpotentials was due to large changes in the electrode area arising from vigorous bubble formation.219 (c) A working model for the Co-phosphate oxygen evolution.214 
Mesoporous zirconium phosphates with large surface area and thermally stable acidity could be synthesized by calcination of mesoporous zirconium phoshonates.221 The acidity was confirmed to be coming from strong Lewis and Brönsted acidic sites.222,223 These mesoporous zirconium phosphate materials with high acid density showed excellent catalytic activity in the biodiesel reaction for the effective conversion of long chain fatty acids to their respective methyl esters.223 Large pore size which favoured the diffusion of large organic molecules contributed to the enhancement of catalytic ability. High catalytic activity could be attributed to the large surface area and the presence of a large number of acidic sites located at the surface of the materials. The catalysts showed negligible loss of activity after five repetitive cycles, suggesting the high chemical stability and reusability of the mesoporous zirconium oxophosphate framework. The thermal stability of acidic sites for the resulting metal phosphates would be suitable for some harsh applications such as dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes which needs high temperature.224,225
Crystalline metal phosphate catalysts have already played important roles in practical industrial production. However, there are still few studies on metal phosphonate-derived phosphates for catalysis. The consumption of organic functionalities and the escape of volatile components including CO2 and H2O during heat treatment under aerobic conditions may create novel porosity, as compared to conventional techniques for synthesis of metal phosphates. Apart from the above mentioned electrocatalysis, esterification and dehydrogenation reactions, metal phosphate semiconductor-mediated photocatalyis226,227 can be visualized. Conversely, under anaerobic conditions, the decomposition of homogeneous organic materials can lead to the formation of carbon networks, on which the phosphate species are highly dispersed.228,229
5. Conclusions and outlook
This review has highlighted the progress of mesoporous metal phosphonates for heterogeneous catalysis, aimed at shedding light on the origins of their activity and providing basic principles for designing high-efficiency metal phosphonate catalysts. Metal phosphonate hybrid materials with combined peculiarities of organic and inorganic components have become a burgeoning member of the heterogeneous catalysts. Through ligand extension, template-free self-assembly, and supermolecular template-induced strategies, reasonable introduction of mesopores into the metal phosphonate frameworks can hugely improve the catalytic activity and influence the selectivity and reaction processes. The relatively strong bonding between phosphonic molecules and metal joints ensures the network stability and homogeneous distribution of catalytic sites, and therefore, mesoporous metal phosphonates have been shown to outperform other porous materials in some catalytic areas. The metal nodes can perform as Lewis acid sites and redox centers, holding promise for reactions involving activation of carbonyls and molecular oxygen, hydrogenation, and oxidation. The organophosphonate groups show inherent functionalities and capacities for post-modification including sulfonation, bromination, grafting and supporting. As a consequence, the rational choice and ingenious functionalization can make mesoporous metal phosphonates promising in the fields of biofuel and drug synthesis, chiral catalysis, and environment and energy relevant catalysis. Bearing the similarities to metal phosphates, preformed mesoporous metal phosphonates can be used as sources for phosphate counterparts with novel physicochemical properties, which are reminiscent of MOF-derived materials.230,231 In this way, further development based on this new and versatile synthesis method is very interesting and necessary; for example, cobalt phosphates as alternative electrode materials exhibited high oxygen evolution activity.232 To sum up the research advances and efforts, great potential and huge challenges coexist in this field. Catalysis based on mesoporous metal phosphonate materials is still at its early research stage.
Heterogeneous catalysis, not confined to metal phosphonates, is indeed an intense host–guest interaction process occurring at the interfaces, and many relevant fundamental aspects are not fully understood. It is urgent to clearly unravel the catalytic mechanisms, which is regarded as a prerequisite to guide the design of efficient hybrid heterogeneous materials. Good predictive power arises from in-depth insights into the catalytic mechanisms and the correlation between the properties and performance of the materials. A combination of in situ experimental analysis, isotope labelling, theoretical investigation, nanoscale probing, and atomic scale modelling would be valuable to get such insights.
Besides the requirement of fundamental mechanistic studies, it is of paramount importance to make efforts for the enhancement of the thermal and hydrothermal stability of mesoporous metal phosphonate materials. A solution to this issue is to resort to the crystalline mesopore wall. This is a factor that should be regarded in practical catalytic applications. The mesostructure with crystalline pore walls has long been a hot topic. Noticeably, the unpredictable ligating mode of phosphonate groups would facilitate the formation of networks with low degrees of order. On the consideration that crystallization usually accompanies the collapse of mesostructures, the interactions between surfactants and hybrid species or the roles of surfactants should be of more importance. If the crystallization can occur on the condition that surfactant micelles are immobilized inside the mesostructured scaffolds, confined crystallization on hybrid mesopore walls may be realized. Also, the use of ionic block copolymers with amine headgroups is expected. Adjusting the synthetic parameters such as temperature and time could realize the control of mesophases.232–236 Reducing the reaction rates of metallic precursors represents another method to contribute to the formation of well-structured mesopores. Alleviation by organic reagents, low temperature and supercritical conditions would possibly aid in the design of mesoporous metal phosphonates with crystalline walls. On the other hand, crystalline metal phosphonates usually have structures which are difficult to characterize. Exploration of high-throughput hydrothermal or solvothermal techniques and advances in powder X-ray diffraction modelling and refinement will significantly increase the number of structurally characterized crystalline metal phosphonates, and it will be exciting to watch this field as it develops.
The increasing interest in the field of mesoporous metal phosphonate-based heterogeneous catalysis will be amplified. In modern times, the solid state chemistry, organic synthesis, and electronic techniques have reached a high level of sophistication. It is reasonable to imagine that metal phosphonates of desired mesostructures and catalytic functionalities can be designed on the molecular scale in the future. These advances must be made in conjunction with analytical and resolved studies that will further elucidate the true value of hybrid materials. Undoubtedly, realizing the fantastic promise held by mesoporous metal phosphonates requires ongoing research attention and efforts from various disciplines to address the formidable challenges. The lack of industrial applications does not signify that the interest in metal phosphonates has been hindered; on the contrary, a huge amount of efforts has been contributed to identify their potentialities and intrinsic limitations, stimulating the exploration of novel methodologies that point to new materials with enhanced physicochemical and catalytic properties.

 	Fig. 3  A summary of potential heterogeneous catalytic reactions of mesoporous metal phosphonate materials.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a, b) TEM images of periodic mesoporous titanium phosphonate (PMTP-1). (c) UV/Vis diffuse-reflectance spectra of PMTP-1 before (solid line) and after Cu2+ ion loading (dashed line). (d) Plot of one-pot heavy metal ion adsorption in wastewater treatment as well as Rhodamine B photodegradation by using PMTP-1 under simulated solar light irradiation.94	 

 	Fig. 5  Supposed mechanism for the synthesis of benzimidazoles. The iron center in the catalyst activated the aromatic aldehyde and facilitated the attack of the amine. The tertiary amine groups in the catalyst helped to eliminate the protons in the water-removal step. The iron center activated the molecule for the second attack of the amine. Thus, the cooperative effect of iron and the tertiary amines in the catalyst induced the catalysis of the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives.110

 	Fig. 10  (a) Comparison of CVs of three different materials at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (all of the electrocatalysts were deposited on Ni foam), and (b) comparison of LSVs of the catalysts. Catalytic onset of the nanostructured Co(PO3)2 catalyst at a significantly lower potential was observed. The nonlinearity of the catalytic current at high overpotentials was due to large changes in the electrode area arising from vigorous bubble formation.219 (c) A working model for the Co-phosphate oxygen evolution.214
