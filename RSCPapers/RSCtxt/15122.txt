    , Accepted 20th September 2022First published on 20th September 2022AbstractThe conversion of low-cost and abundant precursor substances into value-added chemicals through electrochemical techniques is a key element to build a renewable energy-chemistry cycle. Among the various available possibilities, the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) has attracted more and more interest, as it can provide a novel route for ammonia (NH3) synthesis driven by electricity from renewable sources. However, the faradaic efficiency (FE) and production rate of NH3 are still limited by the multiple involved electron–proton-transfer steps and strong competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction. The rational design of efficient catalysts can contribute to overcoming these challenges. Herein, we report the synthesis of free-standing Cu-MOF-based materials as NITRR catalysts. Under electrochemical reduction conditions, the Cu-MOF electrode encounters both chemical reconstruction and structural change. The Cu species are partially reduced and form a unique Cu/Cu2O/CuO heterostructure, resulting in remarkable NITRR performance. At a potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE, the FE of NH3 is as high as 99.5% with a production rate of 5.9 mg h−1 cm−1. A satisfactory half-cell energy efficiency of 35.1% is achieved as well. Desirable stability is confirmed by a cycling test. Such an electrolyzer can be driven by a solar cell under the irradiation of natural sunlight for continuous NH3 production.
1. Introduction
Ammonia (NH3) plays a crucial role in the production of agricultural fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, energy storage, ammunition, and in many other fields.1–3 These wide applications result in high NH3 demand with a market value of ∼70 billion U.S. dollars per year.4 The Haber–Bosch process is the dominant route for large-scale NH3 synthesis, accounting for over 80% of NH3 supply. However, it has to be carried out under harsh conditions (high temperature >300 °C and high pressure >200 bar) and hydrogen is needed as a reactant that is nowadays still mainly produced by steam reforming of methane from natural gas. The Haber–Bosch process requires specific plants and is operated in a highly centralized production mode that causes additional demands on transportation.3,5 With an annual NH3 production of 200 million tons, an estimated amount of 2% of global energy is utilized in the Haber–Bosch process along with 1.5% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission (1 ton of NH3 production releases 1.87 tons of CO2).6 In stark contrast, an electrochemical technique for NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions driven by electricity from renewable sources would be a carbon-neutral alternative to the Haber–Bosch process.7,8 The emerging electrochemical N2 reduction (NRR) with H2O as a proton and electron source is up to now limited by the chemical inertness and low solubility of N2 in aqueous electrolytes as well as the strong competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), leading to its low faradaic efficiency (FE) and production rate towards NH3.9–11
Besides N2, nitrate (NO3−) is another potential nitrogen source. It has a relatively lower bond dissociation energy (NO: 204 kJ mol−1vs. NN: 945 kJ mol−1), which causes lower kinetic barriers compared with the NRR.12 In consequence, some researchers have also found that NH3 can be synthesized through electrochemical NO3− reduction (NITRR) under ambient conditions.13–17 Due to the higher concentration of NO3− in comparison to N2 in aqueous electrolytes, NH3 can be produced at a larger space–time yield and can be collected via resin exchange, which offers a promising method for the scale-up of NH3 production.13 It is also worth noting that the NITRR is a promising technology to convert wastewater to value-added NH3.18,19 Based on the need to move towards energy use from sustainable sources and pollution mitigation, NH3 synthesis via the NITRR can be regarded as a promising contributor to an “artificial nitrogen cycle”. However, there are still some challenges for this technique that have to be solved. The NITRR is a process involving multiple electron–proton transfer steps within a complicated and often not well understood mechanism, leading to several possible N-containing products, including NO2−, N2, N2H4 and NH3.18,20 Considering the strong competition from the HER in water-based electrolytes, a general design strategy towards catalysts with desirable NH3 selectivity with a high FE and NH3 production rate still needs to be developed.13,21
To resolve these issues, recent efforts have been devoted towards the design of novel electrocatalysts with high efficiency.22,23 Ru- and Cu-based materials are among the excellent candidates for NH3 production by the NITRR, but the cost and earth abundance of Ru would restrict its application in future on-scale processes.24–28 It has also been reported that pure Cu catalysts commonly show product inhibition in the NITRR due to their strong adsorption of NO2− intermediates.28 Therefore, strategies for the modulation of textures and electronic structures of Cu-based materials should be applied to break these limitations.12,28 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of functional nanoporous materials that stand out due to their high specific surface area, chemical tunability, and well-defined crystalline structure, which make them attractive for application in gas storage and separation, catalysis, and sensing.29–33 However, the electrocatalytic applications of MOFs are limited by their low conductivity and stability.34 In view of this, the coordinating metal species connected by organic ligands in pristine MOFs can be further converted into high-surface-area metal oxides or sulfide-based materials through electrochemical methods, which might provide sufficient conductivity and/or electrocatalytically active sites.35,36 Our recent work has demonstrated that three-dimensional and binder-free electrodes can increase catalyst loading and enhance the durability, resulting in improved NH3 production performance in the NRR.37 To the best of our knowledge, self-supported Cu-MOF-derived structures prepared via electrochemical reconstruction have not been studied in the NITRR yet.
Herein, we report a design strategy for such materials, namely the synthesis of a Cu-MOF supported on Cu foam (denoted as Cu-MOF@CF) through a simple hydrothermal reaction, which is then converted into a Cu/Cu2O/CuO nanohybrid (denoted as Cu(O)@CF-A, A: activation) through electrochemical methods. The retained high-surface-area structure of Cu(O)@CF-A as well as the formed new Cu/Cu+/Cu2+ interface provides a high density of catalytically active sites and regulates the adsorption strength of the intermediates. At a potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE, the Cu(O)@CF-A electrode exhibits the highest FE of 99.5% with an NH3 yield rate of 5.9 mg h−1 cm−2 and a high chemical selectivity of 97.1% toward NH3. Such an electrocatalytic system could also be driven by natural sunlight to allow for continuous NH3 production. Isotope labeling experiments indicate that the NH3 indeed originates from the NITRR. It is also proposed that the formed Cu/Cu2O/CuO interfaces are vital to improve the NH3 formation.
2. Results and discussion
u-MOF@CF was synthesized according to a modified previous report (Fig. S1†).38 Cu(OH)2 was firstly formed via alkaline solution engraving of a CF surface as a metal precursor (Cu(OH)2@CF), followed by a hydrothermal reaction with terephthalic acid (TA) as an organic ligand to generate Cu-MOF@CF (C11H11CuNO5). The optical color of such a film changed from initially green for Cu(OH)2@CF to blue for Cu-MOF@CF (Fig. S1†). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that Cu(OH)2 nanowires with a diameter of ∼150 nm were grown on the bare CF surface (Fig. S2†). Notably, this morphology was conformally transformed into dense and interconnected MOF nanosheets supported on the CF surface with a uniform distribution of Cu, O, and C elements (Fig. S3†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images also show the typical nanosheet structure of Cu-MOF@CF with a smooth surface (Fig. S4†). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Cu-MOF@CF have low intensity for the MOF but match well in position with the theoretical peaks of C11H11CuNO5 (CCDC No. 687690) and pure CF (Fig. S5a†), indicating the successful synthesis of Cu-MOF@CF (Cu(OH)2 + C6H4(COOH)2 + DMF → Cu-MOF + H2O).37 Besides, three peaks located at 1618, 1394 and 1502 cm−1 in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. S5b†) are ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the –COO groups and the para-aromatic C–H groups of the organic linkers in the MOF structure, respectively.39
Electrochemical activation was conducted in 0.1 M KOH and tracked via cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Notably, the electrodes underwent obvious color change from blue to dark red within the process (Fig. S1†). As shown in the SEM images (Fig. 1a and b), the morphology of the Cu-MOF@CF nanosheets was transformed into Cu(O)@CF-A nanoribbons. Notably, no characteristic XRD signals of the MOF structure can be observed after activation (Fig. 1c), indicating the completed transformation of Cu-MOF@CF. Three obvious diffraction signals at 2theta = 43.3, 50.3, and 73.8° correspond to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of Cu, respectively.40 In addition, new XRD reflections appeared at 35.4 (002) and 38.7° (111) indicating the existence of CuO. A minor peak at 36.4° can be attributed to the (111) crystal plane of cubic Cu2O.40 In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1d), different areas with crystal lattices of 2.08 Å, 2.46 Å, and 2.75 Å are in good agreement with the Cu (111), Cu2O (111), and CuO (110) planes, respectively. Despite the strong XRD reflections from the CF substrate, the existence of surface Cu is still demonstrated by HRTEM analysis with clear Cu/Cu2O/CuO heterointerfaces marked by solid red lines (Fig. 1d and S6†). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern was also indicative of the presence of Cu, Cu2O and CuO structures (Fig. 1e). The uniform distribution of Cu and O was indicated by the EDS mapping results (Fig. S7†). Based on the above results, it is speculated that during the electrochemical activation process, Cu-MOF@CF is transformed into CuO, which is then partially reduced to Cu2O and Cu species.

The electronic structures of Cu and O atoms in Cu-MOF@CF and Cu(O)@CF-A were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments. As shown in the Cu 2p spectra of Cu(O)@CF-A (Fig. S8†), two satellite peaks between 941.5 eV and 943.9 eV are assigned to Cu2+.40 Comprehensive deconvolution of high-resolution Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 peaks shows XPS signals of different Cu species. The peaks at 935.3 eV and 954.8 eV also suggest the existence of Cu2+, while two peaks at 933.6 eV and 953.4 eV are assigned to Cu1+ or Cu0 (Fig. S8†).39 The Auger spectrum (Cu LMM) was further applied to distinguish Cu1+ and Cu0 species (Fig. 1f), which shows the obvious presence of Cu0 (568.2 eV) and Cu2+ (568.6 eV), besides Cu1+ (569.5 eV).41 The Cu 2p XPS results of Cu-MOF@CF exhibit similar binding energies, but with a higher content of Cu2+. Besides, the Cu LMM spectrum shows the absence of Cu0 in Cu-MOF@CF. Therefore, the above results are all consistent with the XRD and HRTEM results, indicating that the electrochemical activation process gives rise to the ternary composition of Cu, Cu2O and CuO in Cu(O)@CF-A. For the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectrum of Cu-MOF@CF (Fig. S9†), two peaks with binding energies at 531.6 and 532.8 eV are assigned to O atoms in C–O and COOH groups, respectively. Notably, the newly appeared peak in Cu(O)@CF-A with a binding energy of 531.3 eV is commonly associated with oxygen vacancies (OVs).42 Therefore, a Cu/Cu2O/CuO heterojunction network with a high density of OVs was formed due to the lattice distortion of Cu, Cu2O, and CuO in such a heterostructure. It is also speculated that the stabilization of Cu2+ at negative potentials could be achieved by the N-protecting effect during the MOF reconstruction as well as the enhanced electron transfer at heterointerfaces.
Cu(O)@CF-A was used as a binder-free electrode to evaluate its NITRR performance in an H-cell, which was separated by a Nafion membrane (117) to avoid Pt deposition on the working electrode and NH3 re-oxidation in the anodic part. By comparing the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M KOH + 0.01 M KNO3 as electrolyte solutions (Fig. S10†), a large augmentation of current density with the addition of KNO3 reveals an excellent NO3− reduction activity. The LSV curve in 0.1 M KOH suggests the poor HER activity of Cu(O)@CF-A, which on the other hand could increase the FE toward NH3. Within the current response range, chronoamperometric tests were then carried out at different given potentials (Fig. S11†). The electrolyte solution after the test was collected to detect possible liquid products via the well-established indophenol spectrophotometric method. Standard curves of NO3−, NO2− and NH4+ were first recorded by preparing a series of standard solutions with known concentrations (Fig. S12†). Impressively, the FE toward NH3 can reach values above 90% (Fig. 2a) over a wide potential range from −0.2 to −0.6 V vs. RHE with a remarkable NH3 yield rate of more than 5 mg h−1 cm−2 (Fig. 2b), demonstrating the dominating role of the NITRR. At a potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE, the electrode with Cu(O)@CF-A exhibits the maximum FE of 99.5% with an NH3 yield rate of 5.9 mg h−1 cm−2. The slight decline of the FE to 87.9% at −0.6 V vs. RHE is attributed to the gradually emerging HER, which is demonstrated by increased FE toward H2 (Fig. S13†).

(c) The change of NO3−, NO2−, and NH3 concentrations with increasing time at −0.3 V vs. RHE. (d) The FE and yield rate toward NH3 in the 10-cycle test. 
Overall, such NITRR performance is comparable to or better than that of most of the state-of-the-art catalysts, especially when compared to other Cu-based electrocatalysts (Table S1†). The FE for NO2− was also calculated (Fig. 2a) and is expectedly much lower than that for NH3. The concentration-based (chemical) selectivity toward NH3 was calculated to be as high as 97.1% at −0.3 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2b) and remained over 90% at other potentials, revealing the high practical NH3 selectivity of the electrode operated with the Cu(O)@CF-A electrocatalyst. Furthermore, the concentrations of NH4+, NO2− and NO3− were plotted against time at the potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2c). With increasing reaction time, the content of NO3− displays a sharp decrease along with an increasing content of NH4+, resulting from the conversion of NO3−. Notably, the reaction rate gradually decreases over reaction time, which can be explained by the constantly lowering concentration of NO3−. After 60 minutes, over 99% of NO3− was converted to NH4+ and the content of both remained unchanged after that. Besides, the concentration of NO2− increased and then decreased, suggesting that NO2− as an intermediately present by-product of medium concentration was also converted to NH4+. Notably, other N-containing products including N2O (Fig. S14†), N2H4 and NH2OH cannot be detected (Fig. S15†), further indicating the high selectivity of the Cu(O)@CF-A electrode toward NH3. Besides activity and selectivity, stability is also an important parameter to evaluate a catalyst. A continuous cycling test was thus conducted. Within 10 cycles, NO3− conversion and NH4+ selectivity both remain at high levels with only small fluctuation (Fig. 2d). The FE toward NH4+ and the NH3 production rate also remain largely unchanged. The SEM images of the Cu(O)@CF-A electrode after this cycling test demonstrate its structural stability during electrochemical operation (Fig. S16†). The HRTEM images (Fig. S17†) also indicate the preservation of the Cu/Cu2O/CuO heterostructure with rich hetero-interfaces after the cycling test, which is consistent with the XPS results (Fig. S18†). The desirable stability of the active sites results in the outstanding stability of ammonia synthesis in the cycling tests.
In addition, some control experiments have been carried out (Fig. 3a), including NH4+ detection in pure KOH and KOH + KNO3 solution before and after electrolysis, respectively, precluding possible nitrogen contaminations from the electrolyte, H-cell, Nafion membrane, electrode, and air. To comply with the rigid protocols for NH3 detection, a 15N isotope labeling experiment was also conducted to further verify the origin of the nitrogen for ammonia (Fig. 3b).43 Standard NMR spectra of 15NH4+ and 14NH4+ were firstly recorded for comparison. The typical double peaks are thus assigned to 15NH4+ by using 15NO3− as a reactant, which is obviously different from the triple coupling peaks of 14NH4+ in 14NO3− containing electrolyte.44 This provides strong evidence that the nitrogen in NH4+ indeed originates from NO3− reduction. A standard NH4+ curve was also established through the internal standard NMR method (NH4+/maleic acid) (Fig. S19†), as the NMR test is also a very precise tool for the quantification with high accuracy. Accordingly, the concentration of NH4+ can be calculated and compared with the value obtained from UV-vis spectra (Fig. 3c), which shows very close results. This thus indicates that the indophenol blue method is also a reliable tool for NH4+ quantification and the above results are accurate and convincing. In addition, a pure carbon paper substrate was also applied in the NITRR (Fig. S20†) with a weak current density and an almost zero NH3 yield. It can thus be concluded that carbon paper shows negligible activity in the NITRR.
 Fig. 3  The electrode with the Cu(O)@CF-A catalyst was applied in the following measurements: (a) UV-vis absorption spectra in different electrolyte solutions, including: 0.1 M KOH, 0.1 M KOH containing 0.01 M NO3−, 0.1 M KOH after the NITRR and 0.1 M KOH containing 0.01 M NO3− after the NITRR. An indophenol indicator was used as a color reagent. (b) 1H NMR spectra of standard 15NH4+, 14NH4+, and the sample by using 15NO3− and 14NO3− as the reactants, respectively. (c) The comparison of the NH3 yield rate obtained through UV-vis and 1H-NMR methods. (d) The comparison of the FE and yield rate toward NH3 in 0.1 M KOH with different NO3− concentrations of 0.01 M and 0.001 M at the potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE. 
Considering that most of the sewage treatments are under neutral conditions with low NO3− concentration, it is also important to study the applicability of the Cu(O)@CF-A electrode under such conditions. By using an electrolyte solution containing 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.01 M NO3−, a remarkable FE above 90% is still obtained within the potential range from −0.5 V to −0.7 V vs. RHE (Fig. S21†). A lower NO3− concentration of 0.001 M in 0.1 M KOH was also applied as an electrolyte in the NITRR. Not surprisingly, the NH3 yield rate exhibits an obvious decrease due to the mass transfer limitation at the lower NO3− concentration, but the impact on the FE and selectivity for NH3 production remains low (Fig. 3d). The energy efficiency (EE) of the NITRR is also important to evaluate its practical application. According to the calculated results, an EE of 35.1% can be achieved in the NITRR at the potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4a). In order to break the limit of the central-treatment mode, natural sunlight was applied in the NH3 synthesis. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was integrated in the anodic part by using one of the best reported OER catalysts, namely NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) (Fig. S22†).45 A commercial solar cell with a voltage of 3 V was used to drive the whole device (Fig. S23a†). Under the irradiation of natural sunlight, there are continuous gas bubbles formed in the anodic part (Fig. S23b†), which can be assigned to O2 from the OER. Importantly, no obvious bubbles can be seen in the cathodic part (Fig. S23c†). Within a reaction time of 6 hours, the NH3 yield shows a gradual increase with an obvious decrease of the NO3− concentration (Fig. 4b), indicating the successful NO3− conversion to NH3 driven by the solar cell. Due to the reduced NO3− concentration, the NH3 yield rate slows down and over 96% of NO3− has been removed after 6 hours.

(b) NH3 yield and NO3− conversion rate of the NITRR driven by a solar cell (3 V) under the irradiation of natural sunlight during the daytime. (c) The comparison of the FE and yield rate of NH3 for Cu(O)@CF-A, Cu(OH)2@CF, Cu-MOF@CP and pure CF. (d) Current densities were plotted against the scan rate (10–50 mV s−1) to calculate the EDLC values of Cu(O)@CF-A, Cu-MOF@CF, Cu(OH)2@CF, Cu-MOF@CP and pure CF, which can represent the ECSA of the electrodes. 
The remarkable NITRR performance of Cu-MOF-CF-A renders it important to elucidate its possible activity origin. Structurally, the self-supported and binder-free Cu(O)@CF-A electrode can provide a high catalyst loading and thus a high density of active sites. Furthermore, the CF substrate is beneficial for the electric conductivity. Thus, a Cu-MOF-powder catalyst without a CF substrate was synthesized as a reference (Fig. S24a and b†). It was then made into a catalyst ink and coated on carbon paper as an electrode, followed by the similar electrochemical activation procedure as applied for Cu-MOF@CF. At the potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE, the Cu-MOF exhibits a lower FE and NH3 production rate of 84.5% and 2.61 mg h−1 cm−1, respectively, with also a much lower NH3 selectivity of 58.05% (Fig. 4c), indirectly verifying the unique advantage of the self-supported structure.
The effect of electrochemical activation on the MOF-derived structure was also investigated. The Cu(OH)2@CF precursor was thus applied as an electrode in the NITRR. After electrochemical activation, denoted as Cu(OH)2@CF-A, it exhibits an FE and NH3 production rate of 84.73% and 2.94 mg h−1 cm−1 (Fig. 4c), respectively, which are worse than those of Cu(O)@CF-A, illustrating that the MOF-derived Cu(O)@CF-A is beneficial for accelerating the NITRR. The electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of the different electrocatalysts were also measured by calculating the corresponding electrical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) (Fig. 4d).46 The EDLC results indicate that Cu(O)@CF-A has the largest ECSA, which is 1.40, 1.91, 2.05 and 14.01 times that of Cu-MOF@CF, Cu(OH)@CF-A, Cu-MOF@CP and CF, respectively, explaining the higher intrinsic activity of Cu(O)@CF-A. The ECSA was also estimated by probing the redox reaction of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide using CV measurements (Fig. S25†). This also indicates that the Cu(O)@CF-A electrode has the highest value of ECSA (Table S2†). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves of the various electrodes were also measured (Fig. S26†). The smallest impedance value of Cu(O)@CF-A indicates a fast electron transfer with less resistance in the electrocatalytic reaction. Thus, adsorbed NO3− can thus easily accept electrons to form the intermediates, promoting the process of NH3 synthesis.
According to the in situ FT-IR spectra (Fig. S27†), the bands at 1355 and 1247 cm−1 are assigned to NO3− and NO2−, respectively.25 The peaks at around 1191 and 1667 cm−1 are derived from NH2OH and NH2, respectively, which are important N-containing intermediates to form NH3 (at around 1478 cm−1). Combining these detected intermediates and some previous reports, the reaction pathway can be deduced (Fig. S28†). Due to the unique structure of the Cu-MOF material, a ternary Cu/Cu2O/CuO heterostructure was successfully constructed after the electrochemical activation. Abundant accessible heterointerfaces provided by self-supported Cu(O)@CF-A could firstly promote NO3− activation and further mass transfer. Meanwhile, these heterointerfaces are also beneficial for optimizing the intermediate adsorption (such as NO2− and *NOH) and reducing the reaction energy barrier.28 In addition, Cu2O has a significant inhibitory effect on the HER.47 NO3− could then be reduced to NO2− according to the Schmid mechanism, which is considered as the rate-determining step.48 After several electron–proton-transfer steps, NH3 is formed as the final product.22 The differences in the lattice indices of Cu, Cu2O, and CuO also result in a large amount of defect sites (oxygen vacancies), improving the nitrate adsorption and reduction for ammonia synthesis.22
3. Conclusions
In summary, the electrochemical activation of Cu-MOF materials has been demonstrated to create catalytically active sites toward the NITRR. Benefiting from the self-supported structure with more reaction sites and strong interaction within the Cu/Cu2O/CuO heterostructured net derived from a MOF material as a precursor, the Cu(O)@CF-A electrode could improve the charge transfer and stabilize some key intermediates in the NITRR. As a result, it exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic performance for converting NO3− to NH3 with a remarkable FE, selectivity and production rate toward NH3 at low overpotential, also along with a remarkable EE of the NITRR. Isotope labeling experiments also indicate that NH3 products are derived from NO3− reactants. This first case study shows that the design of various MOF-derived heterostructured materials may open up a new avenue for catalyst design to achieve highly efficient and sustainable NH3 synthesis. Additionally, construction of a solar energy-to-ammonia synthesis system will provide a promising strategy to overcome the centralized production mode and promote large-scale application in treating wastewater and obtaining value-added products.

Synthesis of Cu(OH)2@CF. 
A piece of copper foam (CF, 1 cm × 2 cm) was washed first with 1 M HCl solution, then with ultrapure water and finally with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min to remove possible oxide layers and other contaminants, followed by drying under vacuum at 60 °C for overnight. 1 g NaOH (25 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL water, and then mixed with 10 mL water containing 0.285 g (NH4)2S2O8 (1.25 mmol). The pretreated CF was immersed in the above solution and stirred for several minutes. An obvious color change of the CF surface was observed, attributed to the formation of Cu(OH)2. Subsequently, Cu(OH)2@CF was taken out and washed with water several times, in a vacuum oven.

The as-obtained Cu(OH)2@CF was applied as a Cu precursor, and immersed in 30 mL DMF solution with 0.022 g (0.133 mmol) TA. The mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave, which was sealed and kept at 120 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the sample was taken out and washed with DMF, acetone, and ethanol several times. The finally obtained Cu-MOF@CF was dried under vacuum overnight before working as an electrode.


Synthesis of Cu(O)@CF-A. 
The activation of the Cu-MOF@CF electrode was achieved by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 within a potential range between −0.5 V and −1.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) until the curves achieved steady state to obtain Cu(O)@CF-A. 20 cycles were conducted in the treatment. A gradual darkening of the surface on Cu(O)@CF-A was clearly seen.


Synthesis of NiFe LDH. 
26
A piece of nickel foam (NF, 1 cm × 2 cm) was washed thoroughly to remove possible oxide layers (washing solutions: 1 M HCl solution, ultrapure water and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min), followed by drying under vacuum overnight at 60 °C. 1.455 g (5 mmol) Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.37 g NH4F (10 mmol) and 1.5 g urea (25 mmol) were dissolved in 40 mL water, and the pre-treated NF was immersed in this solution. After stirring for 10 minutes, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave, which was sealed and kept at 120 °C for 6 h. After the reaction, the sample was taken out and washed with water/ethanol several times. Finally, the obtained NiFe LDH@NF was dried under vacuum overnight before working as an electrode.


Synthesis of Cu-MOF@CP. 
0.604 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 30 mL DMF solution with 0.022 g (0.133 mmol) TA. The mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave, which was sealed and kept at 120 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the sample was taken out and washed with DMF and ethanol several times, respectively, followed by drying under vacuum overnight. Afterwards, 5 mg Cu-MOF powder was dissolved in the mixture solution containing 0.9 mL absolute ethanol and 0.1 mL Nafion solution (5 wt%) to form a homogeneous ink via sonication. 0.4 mL catalyst ink was then loaded onto carbon paper (CP, 1 cm × 1 cm).

Material characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD, λ = 1.5406 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Tecnai G2 20 ST (FEI) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi-S8100) was carried out at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectra were recorded on an Agilent at 400 MHz for protons. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on an AXIS Nova spectrometer (Thermo K-alpha) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The C 1s peak of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV was used for all the calibration of the binding energies. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were also carried out at room temperature on a Bruker EMXPLUS. UV-vis spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a UV-6100 spectrometer. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on an IR-21 spectrometer.
Electrochemical measurements
CHI760E was used as an electrochemical workstation. All the electrochemical measurements were carried out with a three-electrode system, containing an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a counter electrode of platinum foil (1 × 1 cm2), and a working electrode of Cu-MOF@CF (1 × 1 cm2) without further treatment (corresponding to an estimated catalyst loading of ∼0.6 mg cm−2). A typical H-cell was applied in all the tests, separated by a Nafion membrane (117). The Cu-MOF@CF and Ag/AgCl electrodes (double junction) were placed in the cathodic part while the counter electrode was put in the anodic part. The Nafion membrane was pretreated by heating in 5% H2O2 aqueous solution, 5% H2SO4 solution and ultrapure water, respectively. The recorded potentials (vs. Ag/AgCl) were finally normalized to the RHE reference scale according to the relation E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.222 + 0.059 × pH. All the potentials applied were compensated by 95% of the measured resistance.
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR)
An Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution (pH = 13) with a certain amount of KNO3 was used as an electrolyte. Firstly, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were conducted in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with and without KNO3 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The current densities were normalized to the geometrical surface area (1 cm2). Chronoamperometry tests were then conducted at different given potentials under continuous stirring (300 rpm). The electrolyte solution was collected from the cathodic part after each experiment for the following detection of nitrogen species. All the electrolytes were stored in a fridge (3 °C, no more than 2 days). Cycling tests were conducted at the same potential (−0.3 V vs. RHE) and 1 hour for each run, followed by collecting electrolytes and then changing with fresh electrolytes for the next run. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was performed on an Invenio-R spectrometer. The obtained Cu(O)@CF-A served as the working electrode. Platinum foil and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The applied potential was −0.3 V vs. RHE. The double layer capacitance (Cdl) can reflect the value of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). Cdl was tested via CV measurements at various scan rates (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mV s−1) in a non-faradaic potential window (−0.2–−0.26 V vs. RHE). The capacitive anode and cathode current differences at a certain potential (−0.23 V) were then plotted against the scan rates of CV. The slope value of such a linear relationship is thus Cdl. ECSA was also estimated by probing the redox reaction of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide using CV. Different catalysts were peeled off from the substrate and prepared into inks. 0.1 M KCl solution containing 50 mM ferricyanide was initially degassed with Ar and used as an electrolyte. ECSA can be estimated from the Randles–Sevcik equation. The Randles–Sevcik equation is as follows: Ip = (2.69 × 105)n3/2AD1/2Cv1/2(1)Ip is the peak current (A), n = 1, D is the diffusion coefficient of K3Fe(CN)6 (7.9 × 10−6 cm2 s−1), C is the concentration of K3Fe(CN)6 (50 × 10−6 mol cm−3), v is the scan rate (V/s) and A is the electrode area (cm2).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS has been conducted in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte within a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with a signal amplitude of 5 mV using an A.C. impedance test system. It was conducted at the potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE. Before the measurements, the Cu foam was pretreated with acid solution to remove some possible surface oxides.

Detection of NO3−. 
5 mL electrolyte solution was mixed with 1 mL of 1 M HCl and 0.1 mL of 0.8 wt% sulfamic acid solution. The mixture was left to stand at room temperature for 30 min, followed by UV-vis spectrophotometry measurements. The absorbance of NO3− was calculated according to the following equation: Anitrate = A220nm − 2A275nm. The NO3− calibration curve was plotted by preparing a series of KNO3 solutions with different known concentrations. The absorbance of the blank sample was subtracted as background correction for NO3− as well as for the following N-species detection.


Detection of NO2−. 
The NO2− indicator was prepared by dissolving 20 g p-aminobenzenesulfonamide in a mixed solution of 250 mL water and 50 mL of phosphoric acid, followed by adding 1 g N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride. 5 mL electrolyte solution was then mixed with 0.1 mL NO2− color reagent. After complete reaction (20 min), it was characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry with an absorbance at 540 nm, assignable to NO2−. Similarly, the calibration curve was also plotted to determine the NO2− concentration.


Detection of N2H4. 
The Watt and Chrisp method was used to detect N2H4. The color indicator was prepared by dissolving 5.99 g of para-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde in 300 mL of ethanol and 30 mL of concentrated HCl. 1 mL N2H4 color reagent was then added into 2 mL electrolyte solution. After complete reaction (1 h), it was characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry.


Detection of NH2OH. 
49
1.0 ml electrolyte solution was mixed with 1.0 ml phosphate buffer (0.05 M) and 0.8 mL water, followed by adding 0.2 ml trichloroacetic acid solution and 1.0 mL 8-quinolinol solution. Under vigorous stirring, 1.0 mL sodium carbonate solution (1 M) was added, and the mixture was transferred to an oil bath (105 °C) for 1 minute. After cooling down to room temperature, it was characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry.


Detection of NH3. 
The indophenol blue method was applied to quantify NH3. The color indicator was prepared by mixing 1 M sodium hydroxide solution with 5 wt% salicylic acid and 5 wt% sodium citrate. 2 mL color reagent was added into 2 mL electrolyte, followed by adding 1 mL oxidation reagent of 0.05 M sodium hypochlorite solution and 0.2 mL of 1 wt% sodium nitroferricyanide solution. The mixed solution was left to stand for 1 h and then measured by UV-vis spectroscopy. The absorption peak appearing at around 655 nm is assigned to NH4+. A calibration curve was also measured for quantification.

Isotope labeling experiments
K15NO3 was used as a nitrogen source in the NITRR to clarify the NH3 origin. The electrolyte solutions contain 0.1 M KOH and 0.01 M K15NO3. After the electrocatalysis, the electrolyte in the cathodic part with obtained 15NH4+–15N species was taken out and the pH was adjusted to weak acid by addition of 3 M H2SO4. 1H NMR (400 MHz) with maleic acid as an external standard was conducted for the detailed quantification, which can be compared with the UV-vis results. A similar 15NH4+ calibration curve was firstly obtained according to the following procedures: a series of 15NH4+–15N solutions (15NH4Cl) with known concentrations (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 ppm) were prepared as standards; these standard solutions of 50 mL each were then mixed with 0.02 g maleic acid; 0.5 mL of the above solution was further mixed with 100 μL deuterium oxide (D2O) and 100 μL of 4 M H2SO4 for the NMR test; the calibration was achieved using the peak area ratio between 15NH4+–15N and maleic acid (the 15NH4+–15N concentration and the area ratio were positively correlated).
The NO3− conversion, selectivity, faradaic efficiency (FE), mass (m) and production rate of the different N-species: these values were calculated according to the following equation: (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) m(NH3) = C2 × V(8)where C0 is the initial concentration of NO3−, ΔC(NO3−) is the concentration difference of NO3− before and after the reaction, C1 is the concentration of NO2−, C2 is the concentration of NH3, F is the Faraday constant, V is the volume of the electrolyte solution in the cathodic part (40 mL), Q is the total amount of charge passing the electrode, t is the reaction time, and A is the surface area of the working electrode (1 cm2).
Energy efficiency (EE)
The EE of the half-cell energy for NH3 production is defined as the ratio of fuel energy to applied electrical power. It can be calculated with the following equation: (9) represents the equilibrium potential of the NITRR to ammonia (0.69 V); FENH3 is the faradaic efficiency of NH3; 1.23 V is the equilibrium potential of water oxidation; E is the applied potential vs. RHE in the NITRR.
NITRR driven by a solar cell (3 V)
An Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution (pH = 13) with 0.01 M KNO3 was used as an electrolyte solution. Cu(O)@CF-A was used as the cathode for the NITRR, while NiFe LDH synthesized as described above was used as the anode for water oxidation. These two electrodes were then separated by a Nafion membrane (117) in an H-cell, and then connected with a 3 V solar cell. The whole set-up was taken out and irradiated under sunlight. Time-tracking experiments were carried out by collecting small amounts of electrolytes at intervals for product detection.
