    First published on 9th March 2020AbstractGold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are of considerable interest for diverse applications in areas such as medicine, catalysis, and sensing. AuNPs are generally surface-stabilized by organic matrices and coatings, and while the resultant organic compound (OC)/AuNP hybrids have been explored extensively, they are not suitable for certain applications (e.g. those necessitating reversible redox behaviour and/or long excited-state lifetimes), and they often suffer from low photo- and/or thermal stability. Transition metal complex (TMC)/AuNP hybrids have recently come to the fore as they circumvent some of the aforementioned shortcomings with OC/AuNP hybrids. This review summarizes progress thus far in the nascent field of TMC/AuNP hybrids. The structure and composition of extant TMC/AuNP hybrids are briefly reviewed and the range of TMCs employed in the shell of the hybrids are summarized, the one-phase, two-phase, and post-nanoparticle-synthesis synthetic methods to TMC/AuNP hybrids are discussed and contrasted, highlighting the advantages of variants of the last-mentioned procedure, and the utility of the various characterization techniques is discussed, emphasizing the need to employ multiple techniques in concert. Applications of TMC/AuNP hybrids in luminescence, electrochemical, and electro-optical sensing are described and critiqued, and their uses and potential in imaging, photo-dynamic therapy, nonlinear optics, and catalysis are assessed.

1. Introduction
Hybrid materials (those formed from the combination of two different materials) have attracted ever-increasing attention due to their promise for technological applications in photovoltaics,1–3 energy storage,4 catalysis,5,6 sensors,7 imaging, and medicine.8–10 The disparate hybrid materials investigated thus far include mixed-metal oxides, organic compounds (e.g. dyes, pharmacophores, biological probes), or inorganic compounds (e.g. transition metal complexes) embedded in sol–gel matrices or in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), inorganic particles (e.g. clusters, transition metal nanoparticles, quantum dots) embedded in polymers, inorganic particles coated with organic compounds, and layered organic–inorganic materials. This array of hybrid materials, in which the components bring distinct properties and the combination may offer new or enhanced properties, affords versatility in the design and tailoring of multifunctional devices.8,9,11
In amongst the plethora of possible components of such hybrids, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in particular have attracted considerable interest because of their potential use in sensors,12,13 nonlinear optics,14 solar cells,15,16 medicine,13,17–20 imaging,13,19,21,22 and catalysis,23–25 applications in which one or more of their quantum size effects, high surface energies, and high surface-to-volume ratios can be advantageously exploited.26 The properties of AuNPs can be readily tuned because they depend on the AuNP size and shape as well as the stabilizing ligands present on the surfaces, and all of these can be systematically modified.24 AuNPs possess good stability, they are available from a variety of well-established procedures,19,27,28 and they display a rich surface functionalization chemistry with a broad variety of organic matrices and coatings (organic compound/AuNP hybrids), flexibility that has been exploited in the drive to afford novel hybrid multifunctional materials.29–31
These advantages have resulted in strong interest in organic compound/AuNP hybrids,15,32,33 but far fewer reports of transition metal complex (TMC)/AuNP hybrids have appeared. This is surprising, because the hybridization of AuNPs with TMCs may address some of the inherent limitations of organic molecules for applications such as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy/mapping (FLIM) (e.g. organic compounds often exhibit short fluorescence lifetimes associated with a lack of triplet states; these impede efficient temporal discrimination in time-gated fluorescence).41 Moreover, organic dyes are prone to photo and thermal degradation under the experimental conditions required for imaging and microscopy techniques;34,35 in contrast, TMCs are generally robust. The structural and electronic properties of TMCs can be fine-tuned by varying the metal atom, the coordination sphere, the coordination geometry, the oxidation state, etc., in contrast to solid-state materials (e.g. perovskites and mixed-metal oxides) and organic compounds (e.g. dyes and fluorophores). Solid-state materials lack the predictability and flexibility of molecular synthesis that is important for facile preparation and tailoring of properties for specific needs.36 In most cases, the performance of solid-state materials depends on bulk properties (e.g. lattice periodicity, structural defects, grain boundaries, purity, etc.) which are variables that are difficult to control by conventional solid-state synthesis techniques employing high temperatures and/or pressure.36–38 Solid-state materials are often poorly soluble in common organic solvents and are generally suspended in a polymer matrix for studies of their properties, which represents a major limitation due to the need for advanced instrumentation to study this type of material.39 Solid-state materials and quantum dots are generally composed of large amounts of heavy metal atoms; these can be highly toxic, which is a serious limitation for bioimaging and medicinal applications.34,40
Organic compounds possess a limited range of functional groups with the possibility of reversible oxidation, and they generally exhibit short excited-state lifetimes. Coordination and organometallic TMCs exhibit intense low-energy absorption bands that can be metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) or ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) in character;41,42 in particular, TMCs can afford access to low-energy singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) MLCT excited states with interesting and potentially useful photophysical properties such as large Stokes shifts, long lived excited-state lifetimes (in the nanosecond to millisecond regime), and moderate quantum yields, as a consequence of strong spin–orbit coupling and strong π-backbonding between the ligands and the metal.41,42 TMCs have therefore been proposed as promising materials for applications in optical limiting (OL),43 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), light-electrochemical cells (LECs), solar cells, photodynamic therapy, and imaging and microscopy.41,44 Additionally, TMCs often exhibit one or more reversible metal-centred oxidation processes, and the combination of useful properties make TMCs attractive for applications such as electrochemical sensors,45 optical switches and sensors,46,47 and in areas such as catalysis,48,49 energy storage,50 polymer science,51,52 and medicine.53,54
These various advantages of TMCs over organic molecules and solid-state materials also propagate to their AuNP hybrid materials. The combination of TMCs and AuNPs generally results in hybrid materials with good solubility and low toxicity, allowing their use in biological and medicinal applications. The toxicity of TMCs is generally determined by the nature of the coordination sphere, which can be tuned to afford materials suitable for biological applications.41 Energy and charge transfer can occur between the TMC and AuNP resulting in cooperative effects. The characteristic MLCT transition band usually overlaps with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band (collective oscillation of electrons at the surface of the AuNP), giving rise to interesting phenomena such as enhanced singlet oxygen generation,55 strong two-photon absorption (2PA),56 and high quantum yield.57 The hybridization of highly soluble redox active species (e.g. TMCs) with plasmonic nanostructures (e.g. AuNP) affords the prospect of electrochemical sensors with outstanding sensitivity towards the quantification of species of biological importance.58 This review of the emerging field of coordination/organometallic TMC/AuNP hybrids contains a summary of the major synthetic approaches to these hybrids, together with the common techniques deployed for characterization, and highlights applications of TMC/AuNP hybrids in optical,59 electrochemical,58 and electro-optical sensing,60 imaging and microscopy,61 photodynamic therapy (PDT),62 nonlinear optics (NLO),56 and catalysis.63,64
2. Hybrid design
TMC/AuNP hybrids possess a core–shell composition (Fig. 1), with an AuNP core and a shell of surface-stabilizing ligands. The stabilizing ligands are a key component of AuNP-hybrid materials because they define the colloidal stability, the solubility, the charge on the surface, and the potential applications, the last-mentioned depending on additional functionalities that the ligands may contain.24 The ligands in the shells of AuNP hybrids can be classified as auxiliary stabilizing ligands (ASLs) or functionalized stabilizing ligands (FSLs). The ASLs are responsible for the solubility and the colloidal stability of the hybrid; in most cases, they are employed in the synthesis of the AuNPs and are then exchanged (partially or totally) by the FSLs (see Section 3.3). The FSLs contain the active components, i.e. the TMCs, that are attached to the AuNP surfaces to provide the functionality (e.g. catalytic, luminescent, redox activity); FSLs can also enhance the solubility.
 Fig. 1  Core–shell model of TMC/AuNP hybrids. 
The FSLs can be linear, branched, dendritic, or polymeric in composition, and they generally contain one or more heteroatoms (or building blocks containing one or more heteroatoms) that function as gold anchoring groups (Fig. 2). Linear or rod-shaped molecules have the TMC at one terminus of the molecule and are connected via a spacer to the gold-anchoring group, in order to minimize steric effects. Similar compositions have been reported with dendrons, but in these cases the anchoring groups are located at the dendron foci. When metallated stars or dendrimers are employed in the hybridization of AuNPs, the gold anchoring groups are located in the interior of the dendrimers at the branching or bridging points. In all reports thus far, the metal complexes have been positioned at the periphery of the FSL to minimize steric effects and to maximize the interaction with the environment as well as the surface functionalization.
 Fig. 2  Linear, branched and dendritic architectures of TMC-containing FSLs. 
The solubility of AuNP hybrids is highly dependent on the peripheral functional groups, so the possibility of incorporating either ionic or neutral TMCs can be exploited to tune the AuNP solubility (if the metal complex is ionic, it is likely that the hybrid will be soluble in polar protic solvents, and if neutral it will likely dissolve in organic solvents). For example, surface functionalization of AuNPs with the dicationic Ru(II) complex 165,66 results in water-solubility, a key requirement for biological probes, and a remarkable improvement in the solubility of metallated phthalocyanines in biological environments is seen following hybridization with AuNPs.67 In contrast, the exchange of citrate anions by the cationic Re(I) complexes 5 (e.g.40–43) results in aggregation of the AuNPs due to neutralization of the charges at the AuNP surfaces.68
Anchoring groups can be readily incorporated at the metallo- ligands by well-established wet chemistry procedures such as copper-catalyzed alkyne–azide 1,5-cycloaddition (CuAAC), palladium-catalyzed carbon–carbon cross-coupling reactions (e.g. Negishi, Suzuki, Stille), and classic nucleophilic and electrophilic substitution reactions. Commonly used anchoring groups employed in the synthesis of TMC/AuNP hybrids include primary,59,69–71 tertiary,72 and quaternary73 amines, carboxylic acids (attached as carboxylates),57,69,74,75 1,2-dithiolanes,61,68,76 disulfides,77 dithiocarbamates,78 thioethers,79 sulfonates,57 and heterocycles such as pyridines,65,80–83 thiophenes,56 and 1,2,3-triazoles,56,63,84,85 but thiols have been the most intensively investigated by far,86–100 because the high binding affinity of gold and sulfur atoms affords long-term stability of the resultant hybrids.101
Extant TMC/AuNP hybrids involve TMC fragments such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) (1),66,102 [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]2+ (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) (2),61,103 [Ru(terpy)2]2+ (terpy = 2,2′,6′,2′′-terpyridine) (3),104,105 [Ru(phen)3]2+ (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) (4),70,80,105 [Re(CO)3(bpy)(py)]+ (py = pyridine) (5),68,106,107 Rh(COD)Cl(py) (COD = η4-1,5-cyclooctadiene) (6),87 RuCl2(py)(Cy) (Cy = η6-p-cymene) (7),87 Fe(CCR)(dppe)Cp* (dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, Cp* = η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) (8),84trans-[Ru(CCR)2(dppe)2] (9),56trans-[Pd(SR)Ph(PBu3)2] (10),108 RuH(SR)(CO)(PPh3)3 (11),96 ferrocene (12),109 biferrocene (13),110 and others,85,109 as well as large macrocycles such as phthalocyanines (14) (M = Co, Ni, Zn, Mg, Al) and porphyrins (15) (M = Zn, Pd)59,111 because of their physical properties and their robustness (Fig. 3). The good solubility of the TMCs in conventional organic solvents, and thereby the ease of processing, stems from the ancillary ligands such as phosphines,88,101 carbonyls, pyridines, and polypyridines.112–114

3. Synthesis of the hybrids
TMC/AuNP hybrids have been prepared by standard wet chemistry methods that can be classified as one-phase,115,116 two-phase,117 or post-nanoparticle in nature, the last-mentioned employing ligand exchange,98,118 coulombic and van der Waals interactions,119 and wet chemistry on the shell of the AuNPs.119 These methods have different features that can be exploited to afford AuNPs with different shapes and sizes. This section focuses on syntheses of pseudo-spherical particles or nanospheres, which have been the most widely explored TMC/AuNP hybrid shape. The ligands that have been used in the synthesis of AuNP hybrids and the synthetic methods employed are summarized in Tables 2–6, with selected FSLs being depicted in Fig. 4.

3.1. One-phase method
The one-phase method, commonly known as the Turkevich method, and which was later modified by Frens, involves the reduction of a hot solution of a gold salt in the presence of a stabilizing ligand and a reducing agent. While it has typically afforded AuNPs 10–120 nm in diameter,115,116 the size distributions of the AuNPs can be easily tuned within the range 1–10 nm by changing the reducing agent:gold salt ratio.120 When the proportion of reducing agent is decreased, the size of the AuNPs increases, while a larger stoichiometric amount of reducing agent results in a decrease in the size of the AuNPs. The one-phase method offers a simple way of preparing AuNPs with a broad size distribution and allows the preparation of larger AuNPs via the seed-mediated growth method.121 A remarkable aspect of the one-phase method is that the reducing agents (e.g. sodium ascorbate, sodium borohydride, sodium citrate) also function as the stabilizing ligands. AuNPs can be prepared in the presence of a range of metallocene-containing stabilizing agents (ferrocene (16) and its derivatives (17–22), or ferrocene-containing polymers (23–25) and dendrimers (26)) without the need for heat, a procedure that affords well-defined spherical 13–45 nm diameter AuNPs.63,84,85,110,122 A mixture of TMC and ASL can be used to prepare TMC/AuNPs with improved properties using the one-phase method. For example, a mixture of thiol-tethered phthalocyanine (74, 92) and thiol-appended poly(ethylene glycol) results in TMC/AuNP hybrids with enhanced solubility in aqueous solutions.123,124 However, the one-phase method is not a broadly applicable procedure because certain coordination and organometallic complexes (e.g. metal alkynyl complexes56) and organic building blocks (e.g. thiophene125) are sensitive to the acidic/basic and/or oxidizing/reducing environments employed.
3.2. Two-phase method
Due to the aforementioned shortcomings with the one-phase method, attention turned to the two-phase method. The two-phase method pioneered by Brust and Schiffrin employs a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC), such as tetra-n-octylammonium bromide (TOAB), in an organic solvent (e.g. toluene, dichloromethane) to transfer a gold salt (Au3+) from an aqueous solution to the organic phase.117 The stabilizing agent is then added (n-dodecanethiol was employed in the original work, but more recently, a panoply of sulfur- and amine-based ligands have been used), followed by a mild reducing agent, such as NaBH4, to generate the thiol-coated AuNPs. In an analogous fashion to the one-phase method, varying the thiol:gold saIt ratio results in AuNPs with differing size distributions: a high thiol:gold ratio leads to small diameter AuNPs (<2 nm), while a low thiol:gold salt ratio leads to larger AuNP core sizes (ca. 5 nm). This method affords highly stable small to ultra-small AuNPs with diameters in the size range 1–5 nm (and with a narrow size distribution) that can be isolated by precipitation and then re-dispersed in common organic solvents. Degradation of the TMC can occur due to the strongly acidic and oxidizing environment employed in the two-phase method, but this problem can be avoided by using an excess of the PTC, thereby forming a more persistent amphiphilic micellar structure in the organic solvent that effectively encapsulates and isolates the ionic species.56,125
3.3. Post-nanoparticle-synthesis methods
Several methods for the introduction of TMCs after AuNP synthesis have been deployed, the general routes being summarized below, and examples being depicted in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Selected examples of post-nanoparticle-synthesis methods: (A) ligand place-exchange, (B) chemistry-on-the-shell syntheses, and (C) coulombic interactions. 

3.3.1. Ligand place-exchange reaction. 
The ligand place-exchange reaction (LP-ER) method (or “ligand exchange method”) is a post-nanoparticle-synthesis surface functionalization technique based on the replacement of the stabilizing ligands at the surface of AuNPs (Scheme 1A).98 This method allows precise control over the size of the core and composition of the shell, and is one of most common methods used for the preparation of TMC/AuNP hybrids. The AuNPs are prepared either by the one-phase or the two-phase methods, and the ASLs are then replaced by FSLs via a ligand exchange reaction. The nature of the ASLs is crucial, as the ASLs must possess the following three characteristics to be suitable for the synthesis of TMC/AuNP hybrids: (i) good solubility in conventional solvents, (ii) high stability in solution and solid state, and (iii) the anchoring groups must have equal or lower binding affinity than the FSL for gold. Good ligand solubility is required to disperse the nanomaterial in a suitable solvent, high stability of the ligands is required to maintain the shape and size distribution of AuNPs over time, crucial for processability purposes, while the third-mentioned, directly related to the binding strength of the anchoring group to the AuNP surface, is needed for efficient replacement of ASLs by FSLs. ASLs employed in the synthesis of TMC/AuNP hybrids include citrate,69,105 TOAB,104,126n-dodecylamine, n-dodecanethiol, n-hexanethiol,86,87,127 mercaptooctanoate, PEGylated thiols (thiol-containing poly(ethylene glycol)s),128,129 and more sophisticated surfactants such as tiopronin (N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine),130N,N-trimethyl(undecylmercapto)ammonium,130 Zonyl™ fluorosurfactants (FSAs),61,102,103,131 and Triton™ X-100 (a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative).73 The difference in binding strength and size of the ligands determines the reaction rate and the degree of surface functionalization of the shell of the AuNP hybrid.98 The functionalization of the shell can be quantitative or partial, and this can be easily controlled by exploiting differences in the binding strengths of FSL-Au and ASL-Au, available from scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) studies of self-assembled monolayers of alkyl amines, thiols and carboxylic acids supported on an Au(111) surface:132–COOH (Au–O, 8.4 kJ mol−1) < –NH2 (Au–N, 65 kJ mol−1) < –SH (Au–S, 167 kJ mol−1)
For example, if quantitative ligand place-exchange is required, an ASL containing an –NH2 or –COOH group can be employed initially, to be replaced by an SH-containing FSL. Partial ligand exchange is targeted when a lower degree of surface functionalization is required, or when the ligand exhibits poor solubility or compatibility with the surface of the AuNP. Whenever partial ligand place-exchange is sought, the ASL should have a binding strength approximately equal to the FSL. The rate of the ligand exchange reaction decreases as the length or bulkiness of the auxiliary ligand increases.
It is important to account for the surface charge of the AuNP hybrid when carrying out the ligand exchange reaction. Electrostatic and coulombic interactions between charged species can lead to modification or aggregation of the AuNP cores during LP-ERs. For example, structural modifications of the AuNPs are observed during exchange of citrate ASLs by ruthenium(II) bipyridyl complexes containing anchoring groups with low affinity for gold (e.g. amine (27), ketone (28) or carboxylic acid (29, 30)); in contrast, no structural variations are observed in this system with thiol anchoring groups (31, 32),69 although aggregation of 15 nm diameter AuNPs occurs during ligand exchange of citrate anions by thiol-tethered [Ru(phen)3]2+ complexes (69–71).105 The use of surfactants such as Zonyl™ and Triton™ X-100 can reduce this aggregation of the AuNPs through surface charge stabilization and core isolation, resulting in a high loading of FSLs.61,73,102,103,131 The use of mixed layers of stabilizing ligands has also been shown to prevent precipitation of triethylene glycol thiol-coated AuNPs, during a LP-ER between n-triethylene glycol thiol and n-alkylthiol-tethered [Ru(bpy)3]2+ cationic species (35).133
Overall, the ligand exchange method has advantages: it permits the use of a pre-determined AuNP core size, and it is the method of choice when the TMC employed is sensitive to high temperatures (one-phase method), mild reductants, or strong acidic or oxidizing agents (one- and two-phase methods).


3.3.2. Direct covalent chemistry on the shell. 
TMCs have also been introduced at the periphery of the AuNP hybrid shell via chemical reactions at AuNP-bound functional groups, e.g. via copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne coupling (CuAAC) or by simple coordination chemistry (Scheme 1B). CuAAC has been employed to attach a broad variety of functional moieties of biological interest such as proteins, peptides and DNA to AuNPs; however, reports of CuAAC being used to attach TMCs to AuNPs are limited. Ferrocenyl-containing species (e.g.33, Scheme 1B) have been linked to the shell of AuNPs under CuAAC conditions,134 but this procedure necessitates strong gold-ligand attachment; aggregation of the AuNPs has been observed when CuAAC is employed at ligands attached to AuNPs through weak anchoring groups such as carboxylate.135 Coordination chemistry on the shell of the hybrid is also relatively unexplored compared to the methods described in Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.1: among limited examples, rhenium(I) carbonyl species have been successfully coordinated to the carboxylated periphery of AuNPs,136 and the chloro ligand of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 has been displaced by pendant thiol groups at triazine-coated AuNPs.96


3.3.3. Coulombic interactions. 
Self-assembly in solution of a charged TMC (usually cationic) and charged functional groups at the periphery of an AuNP (carboxylates, quaternary amines, and ionic counter ions (e.g. citrate anions)) is a procedure that was employed in early reports of TMC/AuNP chemistry (Scheme 1C).130,137 This method has some flexibility (the TMCs assembled at the surface of the AuNPs can be readily displaced by other cations in solution), but it has since been replaced by synthesis methods affording more robust TMC–AuNP linkages.

4. Characterization techniques
TMC/AuNP hybrids have been characterized using a range of techniques, including NMR (Fig. 5A), IR (Fig. 5B), and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 5C), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Fig. 5D), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Fig. 5E), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 5F), UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 5G), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Fig. 5H), zeta-potential studies (Fig. 5I), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 5J), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectroscopy (OES), and mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. 5K). Each technique provides useful insight into one or more of the size distribution, stability, surface functionalization, composition, and morphology of the nanomaterial; the information obtained from each technique is summarized in Table 1. The hybrid nanomaterials should be characterized using several complementary techniques in concert, in order to remove ambiguities associated with the use of a single technique, and to have a clear understanding of the material properties. A comprehensive review regarding conventional and advanced techniques to characterize a diverse array of nanomaterials has appeared recently.138,156

An estimate of the formula weight (FWt, in grams per mole) of TMC hybrids is needed to obtain concentration-related molecular (nanomaterial) properties (such as molar absorptivity coefficients, two-photon absorption cross-sections, etc.) and other useful merit figures that allow comparison between species with disparate compositions and architectures. The FWt of a hybrid can be estimated from the sum of the average number of gold atoms per AuNP core (NAu) and the average number of complexes (Ncomplex) in the shell (eqn (1)), assuming there are no other stabilizing ligands present: FWt = NAu × AtWtAu + Ncomplex × FWtcomplex(1)NAu, the number of Au atoms per AuNP, can be estimated according to eqn (2) (where ρ is the density of gold, D is the diameter of the AuNP core in nm, AtWtAu is the atomic weight of gold, and NA is Avogadro's constant). Eqn (2) can be reduced to eqn (3):163 (2) NAu = 30.8960D3(3)where the average AuNP diameter D can be obtained from TEM or SEM analysis and Ncomplex can be estimated using NAu as reference together with the Au:metal ratio, the latter determined from ICP-OES/MS analysis or any other elemental analysis technique. The error associated with the FWt can be propagated into other merit figures by using standard error propagation statistical analysis.164

5.1. Sensing

5.1.1. Optical sensing. 
AuNPs can either enhance or decrease (quench) the luminescence properties of molecules located in close proximity, and this characteristic has been exploited for sensing applications.12 Fluorescence quenching occurs at short distances (ca. 0–5 nm), while spatial variation of the incident light field (ca. 0–15 nm) and changes in the radiative decay rates (ca. 0–20 nm) are seen over longer distances.165
Late transition metal complexes with closed-shell electronic configurations can exhibit long-lived excited-state lifetimes (τ ≈ 100 ns to ms) and afford low energy singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) MLCT transition bands as a result of strong spin–orbit coupling via intersystem crossing.166 These have been shown to be promising probes for time-gated luminescence, because their long lifetimes and large Stokes shifts (10–100 nm) facilitate signal discrimination from self-quenching of the luminescence of the probe and the autofluorescence of the biological samples (which is usually short lived, much less than 10 ns), thereby enabling fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and mapping (FLIM).41,61
In view of the attractive properties of AuNPs and TMCs, their hybrids have been proposed for sensor applications, since a greater degree of signal quenching would be expected for molecules exhibiting larger luminescence intensity due to the proximity of AuNPs. The resulting sensing devices will show enhanced sensitivity, as suggested by the Stern–Volmer equation (eqn (4)),93 which relates fluorescence intensity of an emitter (e.g. a TMC) in the presence (I) and absence (I0) of a quencher (e.g. a AuNP) to the bimolecular quenching constant (kq), the non-quenched lifetime (τ0) and the quantum yield (Q) of the fluorophore: (4)
It is clear from eqn (4) that compounds with longer excited-state lifetimes are (unsurprisingly) quenched more readily than compounds possessing shorter excited-state lifetimes. TMCs usually possess considerably longer excited-state lifetimes than organic dyes due to spin–orbit coupling, so TMCs with long-lived excited states are anticipated to display higher sensitivity in optical sensing devices when attached to a AuNP.
Resonance energy transfer (RET) is an important mechanism for quenching the fluorescence of molecules surrounding AuNPs.13,167 Plasmon oscillations relax non-radiatively through electron–electron collisions, electron-lattice phonon and electron-surface interactions, leading to AuNP absorption processes.13,167 The distance between the fluorophore and the AuNP has a strong influence on the fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime.168 The latter are governed by the rate of energy transfer (kT), which is given by eqn (5):93 (5)where R0 is the Förster radius and r is the distance from the fluorophore to the AuNP surface. From eqn (5), it can be seen that fluorophores in close proximity to the AuNP surface will exhibit a larger kT than those positioned further away, resulting in stronger quenching of the emission and reduced lifetime of the luminophore. Assessing RET in chromophore/AuNP hybrids is highly effective for determining interparticle distances.169
Recent studies of optical sensors containing TMC/AuNP hybrids have involved the displacement/attachment of a fluorophore from/to the surface of an AuNP by means of LP-ER, or a spatial rearrangement at the AuNP surface resulting from a chemical stimulus recovering/quenching the luminescence of the TMC. Table 2 shows TMC/AuNP hybrids explored as optical sensors.119 Early examples exploited electrostatic interactions between [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (34) and surface-charged 1.8–2.2 nm AuNPs with anionic (carboxylate, 34-AuNP-1) and cationic (quaternary amine, 34-AuNP-2) functional groups on the periphery of the shell, which resulted in a 70% quenching of the luminescence.130 The electrostatic interaction is reversible because the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminescence was recovered on addition of cations such as K+, Ca2+, and NEt4+. To understand the mechanism of quenching by the AuNP hybrids, the fluorescence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (34) has been assessed before and after hybridization with 10 nm diameter (mercapto)octanoate-coated AuNPs with the use of time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC).137 The main quenching process in the hybrid 34-AuNP-3 is believed to involve electron-transfer from the MLCT excited-state to the surface of the AuNP, followed by back electron-transfer. The lifetime decay plots of the hybrids reveal a tri-exponential decay attributed to (i) the complex adsorbed directly to the surface of the AuNP, (ii) the adsorbed complex interacting electrostatically with the stabilizing ligands at the surface of the AuNP, and (iii) the free complex, and this collective behaviour affords a method of characterizing the nature of the adsorbates at the surface of AuNPs. Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and TCSPC studies suggest that the strong quenching seen when the n-heptanethiol-tethered ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl derivative (35) is attached to triethylene glycol-coated AuNPs corresponds to a concentration-dependent electron-transfer between the adjacent ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl moieties present in the shell of the TMC–AuNP hybrid (35-AuNP).133

Differences in AuNP core diameters in the range 10–100 nm have little to no influence on the quenching efficiencies of the metal-containing chromophores.59,61,102 In contrast, the degree of luminescence quenching is highly dependent on the distance of the chromophore from the AuNP surface, and is related to the distance-dependent increase in rate of nonradiative decay that results from electron- or energy-transfer (kET) from the chromophore to the AuNP core.93 The emission of the ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl derivative 36 is strongly quenched when closely bound to the surface of 17, 60, and 120 nm AuNPs (estimated radial distance 0.7 nm from the AuNP surface), whereas an increase in luminescence is observed when the length of the spacing unit between the complex and the anchoring group is increased from compound 36 (36-AuNP-1-3, QY = 0.02) to 37 (37-AuNP-1-3, QY = 0.05, radial distance 1.6 nm) and on to 38 (38-AuNP-1-3, QY = 0.09, radial distance 2.5 nm).102
Hybrids of the adamantane-tethered ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl derivative 39 or the rhenium(I) tricarbonyl polypyridyl derivative 40 and β-cyclodextrin-capped 13 nm diameter AuNPs (39-AuNP and 40-AuNP, respectively) display dual sensing properties (Fig. 6).106 In the former, the bpy ligands are connected through n-alkyl spacer groups to adamantane fragments which participate in host–guest interactions with the β-cyclodextrin pockets on the surface of the AuNPs. The AuNP hybrids possess steroid- and esterase-sensing capability by means of fluorescence recovery; this is effected either by displacement of the complexes (steroid sensing) or by cleavage of the ester bond present in the bpy ligand of the complexes (esterase sensing). Similar esterase sensing studies of AuNPs hybridized with Re(I) complexes (41-AuNP, 42-AuNP, 43-AuNP, 44-AuNP) have shown that a greater spectral overlap of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption band and the emission band of the fluorophore (and thereby enhanced energy transfer) results in higher quenching efficiency,68 an outcome also seen with the 1,2-dithiolane-tethered ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl derivative (45) and the rhenium(I) tricarbonyl polypyridyl derivative (46).106 Quenching from Förster resonance energy-transfer (FRET) in similar esterase-sensing systems that are linked by a covalent bond to the AuNP surface is also possible;107 this has been exploited in AuNPs coated with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ moieties labelled with DNA that have been used as luminescence probes for the detection of deoxyribonuclease (DNase).174

Even more complex designs have been explored for biomolecule recognition. For example, streptavidin (SA)/bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PEG/AuNP hybrids have been employed as molecular recognition sensors for the biotin-functionalized PEGylated ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl derivative (47) or palladium(II) porphyrin (48) (47-AuNP and 48-AuNP, respectively) (Fig. 7).59 Luminescence quenching efficiencies of ca. 80% are observed after recognition of the complexes by the SA/BSA/PEG/AuNP at an estimated radial distance of 4 nm.
 Fig. 7  Phosphorescent metal complexes 47 and 48 attached via streptavidin–biotin recognition to 20 and 40 nm diameter AuNPs; the residual AuNP surface is sealed with either BSA or PEG.

Overall, the degree of quenching induced by the AuNP core in such sensing applications is highly dependent on (i) the position of the LSPR band compared to the emission band of the TMC (in general, a better spectral overlap between these two bands favours quenching due to energy- or electron-transfer to the AuNP core in the excited-state), (ii) a shorter radial distance, and (iii) non-covalent interactions (which afford a stronger degree of quenching if the AuNP surface and the TMC are in close proximity). All three factors are important in the application of fluorescent sensors and labels, and all must be considered when designing luminescent AuNP-hybrid materials.


5.1.2. Electrochemical sensing. 
Ferrocene and its derivatives display exceptional stability in their accessible redox states and have consequently been explored as electrochemically-responsive modules in molecular electronics and sensor applications.175 AuNPs can function as electron shuttles in solution or when supported at an electrode surface, because they can stabilize variable charge at their periphery; as a result, AuNPs have potential in nano-electrodes applications. Hybridization of AuNPs with redox-active ferrocenyl moieties is therefore an attractive prospect (Table 3). For example, n-octylthiol-coated AuNPs have been partially surface-functionalized with ω-thiooctylferrocene (49), and the ferrocene units employed as a reference in the calculation of the diffusion constant and the capacitance of the AuNP core of the hybrid 49-AuNP.176,177 The charging capacitance of fully ferrocenylated hexylthiolate-stabilized AuNPs (50-AuNP-n, n = 1–5) increases considerably when several ferrocene groups are present in the shell (allowing a larger amount of charge per volume); these hybrids can transfer up to 60 electrons per ω-thiohexylferrocene/AuNP (hybrid core diameters ca. 2.2 ± 0.2 nm).179 The capacitance properties are highly dependent on hybrid size (core + shell), with higher capacitance per unit volume being found on decreasing the (core + shell) diameter.179

The same trend is observed for the capacitance at the electrical double-layer at the core surface, a higher capacitance being found for smaller AuNP diameters; this outcome suggests that smaller AuNPs are more suitable for electrochemical devices. With this in mind, AuNP hybrids with the ω-thiohexylferrocene FSL 50 have been particularly intensively studied,91,92,94,95,100,127,179,180 examples of applications being discussed below. Biferrocenyl/AuNP hybrids 51-AuNP-1-3, 52-AuNP, 53-AuNP, 54-AuNP, and 55-AuNP are electrodeposited on gold and platinum electrodes at potentials positive of the second oxidation process at the biferrocenyl units. The surface morphologies of the resultant materials have been characterized;181,183–185,188,193 similar studies have been undertaken with a ferrocenyl-coated AuNP (56-AuNP).189 Varying the solvent when electrodepositing a poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane)thiol/AuNP hybrid (57-AuNP) has a strong influence on the resultant surface-patterning and self-assembly;190 pure chloroform affords AuNPs with an interparticle distance of 12 nm, whereas increasing volume fractions of cyclohexane result in aggregation of the hybrid AuNPs and an interparticle distance of 4 nm. The volume of the hybrid can also be controlled electrochemically; the poly(ferrocenyl)ated dendrimer/AuNP hybrid 58-AuNP exhibits three reversible and stable oxidation states in solution which result in a “breathing” of the material by oxidation-state-dependent expansion and contraction of the dendrimer.84
The attachment of ferrocene-functionalized stabilizing ligands to AuNPs has afforded sensors for the detection of species of biological importance, such as ascorbic acid (AA),58,94,95,194 uric acid (UA),58,194 acetaminophen (AC),58,194 H2PO4−,191,192,195 dopamine (DA),58,72,194 DNA,89,127 lectin,97 and ATP.190,191 In these systems, ferrocene is conjugated to a biological probe in order to be recognized by the specific target; the response is then recorded by electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry127,191 and differential pulse voltammetry.58,71,72,76,97 In many cases, signal amplification is effected by the presence of multiple ferrocene units at the surface of the AuNPs. Sensitivity comparable to fluorescence techniques has been achieved in the detection of DNA by electrodes consisting of ferrocene-capped streptavidin/AuNP hybrids (50-AuNP-2).89,127 Mannosyl-substituted ferrocene/AuNP hybrids (59-AuNP, 60-AuNP) have been employed in the electrochemical sensing of lectin, with detection limits three orders of magnitude better than standard colorimetric techniques.97 A nona(silylferrocenyl)dendron/AuNP hybrid (61-AuNP) deposited on a platinum electrode has afforded re-usable electrodes that display selective recognition of [H2PO4]− and [ATP]2−, even in the presence of other anions such as Br−, Cl−, HSO4− and NO3−.190,191
More complex devices comprising multiple 1,1′-bis(1,2-dithiolane)ferrocene/AuNP hybrids (62-AuNP) have been used for the detection of antigens (human immunoglobin G antigen (HIgG Ag)), dopamine, electrolytes, and drugs,76 and a multicomponent example comprising AuNP hybrids of 1,1′-ferrocenylbis(methylene lipoic acid ester), BSA, and antibodies supported on a carbon electrode has been used for the sensitive and selective detection of human HIgG Ag.76 Hybridization of ferrocene-coated AuNP hybrids (63-AuNP) with carbon nanoclusters (CNC), graphene, and glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) has allowed simultaneous and ultrasensitive detection of AA, DA, UA and AC by differential pulse voltammetry.58 The hybrid nanomaterial exhibits a wide dynamic range of quantification (comprising two linear ranges) for measurement of the analytes (Fig. 8). Attachment of Ni(II) phthalocyanine/AuNP hybrids (64-AuNP) to a gold electrode containing self-assembled monolayers of 1,6-hexanedithiol has afforded a nanostructure with high sensitivity for the detection of hydrazine (limit of detection (LOD) = 5 × 10−8 M).71

5.1.3. Electro-optical sensing. 
TMCs have played a fundamental role in the development of optoelectronic technology (e.g. cyclometallated complexes of Ir(III) in solar energy conversion, LEDs,196 and light-electrochemical cells (LECs)). The electro-optical properties of Ir(III)/AuNP hybrids are of interest because AuNPs enhance the local electromagnetic field due to the LSPR. While this area remains little-explored, the photocurrent produced by a [Ru(bpy)3]2+-viologen/AuNP hybrid (65-AuNP) deposited on a gold electrode is enhanced by one order of magnitude compared to similar electrodes lacking AuNPs (photocurrent action cross-sections at 460 nm: 4.6 μA mW−1 cm−2 and 0.31 μA mW−1 cm−2, respectively),60 and electrofluorochromism studies of cyclometallated Ir(III) complexes 66 and 67 revealed modulation of the electro-optical properties on proceeding to the hybrids 66-AuNP and 67-AuNP;81 the hybrids display reduced electrofluorochromism and reduced potential-dependent electro-optic response compared to the free complexes 66 and 67, respectively (Fig. 9).82

TMCs with a d6 electronic configuration possess interesting photophysical properties useful in imaging and microscopy.41 They can exhibit (i) a large Stokes shift, which minimizes self-quenching of the signal and helps distinguish luminescence of the probe from autofluorescence, (ii) long-lived excited-state lifetimes that can be beneficially exploited to remove the autofluorescence by time-gated luminescence microscopy, and (iii) excitation and emission at longer wavelengths that permit imaging with deeper tissue penetration. Additionally, the luminescence profile of complexes can be easily modified by changing the metal centre, the coordination sphere, the functional groups of the ligands and, in some cases, the oxidation state. AuNPs are electron rich materials. Their flexible surface chemistry can be exploited to attach a broad variety of chromophores that can afford enhanced spatial resolution for imaging biological environments. AuNPs can be employed in both reflective and thermal imaging. Although it is attractive to hybridize AuNPs with luminescent TMC probes in the pursuit of novel materials for imaging, the high quenching efficiencies of AuNPs towards the luminescence of the surrounding environment render it necessary to optimize the quantum yields of the TMC/AuNP hybrid materials.
The quantum yields of the complexes depend strongly on their radial distance from the AuNP core; when the metal-containing chromophore is far from the core, the quantum yield (QY) and lifetime (τ) of the fluorophore are described by the free-space condition: QY = kr/(kr + knr)(6) τ = 1/(kr + knr)(7)where kr is the radiative rate and knr is the non-radiative rate. As the chromophore approaches the gold surface, the radiative and non-radiative rates increase, and the QY and τ of the hybrids are described by the following equations: QY = kr/(kr + knr + ket)(8) τ = 1/(kr + knr + ket)(9)where ket is the energy and electron transfer rate attributed to the presence of the AuNP core. The immediate environment of the fluorophore does not significantly alter kr, but strongly influences the fluorescence lifetime and intensity due to changes in knr and/or ket induced by the AuNP core.
Despite the well-known luminescence quenching of AuNPs due to energy- or electron-transfer processes (ket), TMC/AuNP hybrids can be engineered to display sufficiently high quantum yield to be detected by standard fluorescence microscopy techniques (Table 4). While no variation in the emission or excitation profile of the rhenium(I) tricarbonyl pyridyl complex 68 is seen on attachment to 3.1 nm AuNPs (68-AuNP),129 the emission lifetime of the hybrid 68-AuNP is shorter than the free complex 68, and features a second component in the decay profile (τ = 116.8 ns, τ1 = 110 ns, τ2 = 6.8 ns), in contrast to the mono-exponential decay observed for 68 (τ = 133 ns). The Ru(II)-polypyridyl complexes (69–71) have been attached to ca. 4 nm diameter AuNPs by ligand exchange (69-AuNP-1, 70AuNP-1, 71-AuNP-1), resulting in quenching efficiencies ca. twenty times greater than those of the free complexes. The quantum yields of the red-emitting TMC/AuNP hybrids are still sufficient to image HeLa cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy in the range 600–700 nm, by excitation of the MLCT band of the complexes using a 488 nm laser.104 The same ligands have been attached to 15 nm diameter AuNPs coated with thiol-modified DNA (69-AuNP-2, 70-AuNP-2, 71-AuNP-2) and the uptake of the hybrids into live HeLa cells monitored by fluorescence confocal microscopy imaging and TEM.105

Long-chain fluorinated surfactants (FSAs, e.g. Zonyl™) attached to the AuNP surface enhance the quantum yields of Ir(III) and Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes without variation in the λem and, more importantly, avoid the luminescence quenching trade-off ordinarily associated with the AuNP core (Fig. 10).61,102,103,131,171,172 For example, surface functionalization of AuNPs with the fluorinated auxiliary ligand Zonyl™ 7950® affords a three- and four-fold quantum yield enhancement in Ir/AuNP hybrids of 13 nm (72-AuNP-1) and 100 nm (72-AuNP-2) diameter, respectively.103 The luminescence of 72 in the hybrids is less oxygen-sensitive than the free complex because the Zonyl™ FSA shields the complex from environmental oxygen. Similarly, the quantum yield of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (0.02) increases to 0.09 on proceeding to the hybrid [Ru(bpy)3]2+/AuNP by using Zonyl™ FSA and fine-tuning the radial distance of the complex.102 The luminescence properties of the hybrids do not change when varying AuNP diameters over the range 10–100 nm,59,61,102,131 but are strongly dependent on the length of the spacer between the metal complex and the anchoring group, and this radial distance of the complex relative to the AuNP surface can be optimized: for example, the quantum yield of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ is 0.02 when the complex is located ca. 0.7 nm from the AuNP surface (C2 spacer), but three- and five-fold enhancements in the QY are observed when the distance is increased to 1.6 nm (C6 spacer) and 2.5 nm (C12 spacer), respectively.102

The functionalized [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex 73 has been deprotected in situ to give the corresponding dithiol, which was then anchored to AuNPs of 13 and 100 nm diameter, enabling dual imaging of the hybrids in a cellular environment.131 The luminescence properties of the hybrids 73-AuNP-1 and 73-AuNP-2 are independent of the size of the AuNP, and the resolution with the 100 nm core diameter hybrids is sufficient to permit single-particle imaging via confocal microscopy. The core has been imaged by reflection microscopy (λex = 488 nm, λem = 478–498 nm) and the Ru(II) complex imaged by fluorescence (λex = 453 nm, λem = 555–800 nm) (Fig. 10). The strong luminescence of the hybrid allows the imaging of particles associated with condensed DNA material in the nucleus of A549 cells.131 An analogous hybrid comprised of functionalized [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (74) supported on 10–100 nm diameter AuNPs is a promising material for imaging microvascular blood flow;103 the hybrid containing the complex attached to 25 nm diameter AuNPs (74-AuNP-2) displays strong two-photon luminescence which has been used in two-photon lifetime imaging in cells. Detection of the fluorescence signal can be performed using two channels, one channel detecting the long lifetime of the complex (740 ns) and the other detecting the shorter component corresponding to the AuNP (450–590 ns).61 All examples above display low cytotoxicity in biological environments.
Metallophthalocyanines have also been successfully hybridized with AuNPs, with strong changes in their photophysical and photochemical properties; their exceptional singlet oxygen generation capability has prompted studies in photodynamic therapy (Section 5.3). Finally, functionalization of the surface of water-soluble sodium mercaptopropanoate (NaMP)/AuNPs with 188Re(I) carbonyl compounds has been explored for potential application in radioisotope imaging.134
5.3. Photodynamic therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising procedure in the treatment of cancer. In PDT, excitation of photosensitisers with light of a suitable wavelength (usually in the red or NIR) results in the generation of highly cytotoxic, reactive singlet oxygen.197,198 Metallophthalocyanines (MPcs) and porphyrins are promising candidates in PDT.199 These 18 π-electron conjugated systems possess strong absorption bands in the wavelength range 600–800 nm at which biological tissue displays its maximum transparency, thereby allowing deeper penetration. In addition, they have long-lived triplet excited states capable of efficiently transferring electrons or energy to adjacent species, and as a result can afford high singlet-oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ).200 AuNPs can enhance the charge and energy transfer processes of the surrounding environment due to an increase in the non-radiative rate, leading to a more efficient generation of singlet oxygen.201 They have also been employed as platforms for drug delivery due to their excellent biocompatibility;202 AuNPs have been functionalized with water-soluble ASLs to deliver hydrophobic drugs to specific tissue sites without modification of the molecular structure of the drug. Hybridization of MPcs with AuNPs is therefore of considerable interest, and leads to enhancement in the therapeutic performance in PDT due to (i) the increase in the singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ) by plasmon-enhanced light absorption of the chromophore, (ii) the synergetic effect of photothermal treatment by AuNPs and singlet oxygen generated by the phthalocyanine, (iii) the delivery of higher concentrations of the MPc photosensitizer to the tumour cells, and (iv) improvements in the solubility of phthalocyanines in polar protic solvents and biological environments.62,197 Indeed, one of the major drawbacks of MPcs (M = Al, Cu, Co, Mg, Ni, Zn) is their poor solubility in polar protic solvents, particularly water, which restricts their applications in medicine;200 hybridizing MPcs with AuNPs can solve this problem. For example, hybridization of the toluene-soluble thiol-tethered Zn(II) phthalocyanine 75 with TOAB/AuNPs affords 75-AuNP-1 (Table 5), which can be redispersed in ethanol.55 A remarkable 50% enhancement in the generation of singlet oxygen is seen for the hybrid 75-AuNP-1 (ΦΔ = 0.65) compared to the free complex 75 (ΦΔ = 0.45),55 an observation that lead to the introduction of different ionic functional groups such as carboxylate,75 quaternary amines and sulfonates,57 and non-ionic functional groups such as amines,158 pyrrolidone,203 thiols,55,75,83 thioethers,57,73,75,79,204 and disulfides205 at the MPc to facilitate interaction with the AuNP surface, with the expectation of improving the overall solubility of the hybrid in biological environments. However, aggregation of the AuNPs can occur due to the resulting close-packing of the Pcs on the AuNP surface, and in these cases surfactants such as Triton™ X-100 have been employed to preserve the colloidal stability of the hybrids.73

Most MPc/AuNP hybrids exhibit greater triplet as well as singlet oxygen quantum yields than the analogous free complexes; the decreases in luminescence quantum yields and increases in triplet excited-state lifetimes arise from the strong interactions of the MPcs with the AuNP cores, and this correlates strongly with increased generation of singlet oxygen.
The shape of the AuNPs has a key effect on the progress of the LP-ER; while the CTAC (CTAC = cetyltrimethylammonium chloride) ASLs are displaced with aggregation of AuNP stars, the spherical AuNP analogues undergo LP-ER with MPcs to afford stable hybrids. The spherical hybrid 79-AuNP prepared by this procedure displays an 11-fold increase in its quantum yield compared to that of the free sensitizer.57 Varying the number of linking units, the radial distance of the complex with respect to the AuNPs, the type of anchoring group, and the metal centre have all been explored, in efforts to maximize the ΦT and ΦΔ values; as expected, proximity of the MPcs to the AuNP surface results in strong quenching and a decrease in luminescence quantum yield, together with an increase in singlet oxygen generation. Quenching in MPc/AuNP hybrids results from exciton-plasmon interactions following aggregation of the phthalocyanines on the surface of the AuNP.206 Mie theory suggests that the maximum absorption enhancement is expected at an AuNP diameter of ca. 80 nm, with an enhancement factor of 5.3 compared to the free complex assembled as a monolayer on a gold surface. Studies to assess the influence of the anchoring groups have shown that, for a series of AuNP hybrids with phthalocyanines bearing a carboxylic acid (81), four thioether units (82) or one thiol group (83), the highest enhancement in ΦT is observed for the thiol-tethered phthalocyanine/AuNP hybrid 83-AuNP, from 0.63 for the free complex 83 to 0.71 for 83-AuNP;75 mild fluorescence quenching is observed for the tetra-(thioether) MPc-functionalized 84-AuNP.79 Tethering via ionic functional groups, such as quaternary ammonium salts, results in an increase of ca. 15% in ΦT when the Mg2+ (85) or [Al(OH)]2+ (86) phthalocyanines are hybridized with 5.4 nm diameter AuNPs (85-AuNP, 86-AuNP).73 Comparison of AuNPs, gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Au@Fe3O4), and quantum dots (QDs) hybridized with zinc(II) (87) or indium(III) (88) MPcs158 shows the highest ΦΔ values for the AuNP hybrids (e.g.88-AuNPΦΔ = 0.92 cf.88-Au@Fe3O4ΦΔ = 0.46 and 88-QDsΦΔ = 0.34). Compared to the free MPcs, the MPc/AuNP hybrids (M = Co2+ (90), Cu2+ (91)) exhibit almost double the length of the lifetimes, whereas the nickel- and zinc-containing hybrids 89-AuNP and 92-AuNP show similar lifetimes to the free complex 92.203
Zn(II)Pc/AuNP hybrids slow tumour growth of amelanotic melanoma following in vivo PDT, and with a lower persistence of the hybrid than the free MPc in the tissue.205 Related studies have further defined their potential in PDT. Hybrids of Zn(II)Pc 75 and AuNPs that are stabilized with cellulose, lactose, TOAB, or molecules of biological importance such as antibodies, lectins, carbohydrates, peptides, aptamers, and folic and hyaluronic acids possess good solubility in biological environments and function as recognition sites for targeting certain types of cancer.62 Indeed, the hybrids 75-AuNP-1-3 and 93-AuNP are effective in the treatment of amelanotic melanoma, breast cancer and colon adenocarcinoma.62 The hybrids function in two ways: the AuNP enhances the performance of the photosensitiser (the MPc) in PDT, and the hybrids exhibit negligible dark cytotoxicity and efficient cytotoxicity when excited at 633 nm. Similar observations were reported for Ni(II)Pc/citrate-capped/AuNP hybrids 94-AuNP-1. Chitosan has also been incorporated (94-AuNP-2) to improve TMC/AuNP hybrid delivery to the biological environment.74 However, while outstanding anti-tumor activity has been observed in MPc/AuNP hybrids, the mobility of hybrids at the biological site is greatly reduced, in contrast to free MPcs which diffuse readily in biological environments.62 Greater control over the duration of the drug/host interaction is needed for implementation of these hybrid nanomaterials in biological systems.
5.4. Nonlinear optics
The NLO and particularly nonlinear absorption (NLA) properties of molecular and nano-materials are of great interest because of their potential applications in medicine, 3D patterning, optical data storage, optical limiting (OL) and telecommunications.43,207–209 AuNPs exhibit NLA in processes including saturable absorption (SA), two-photon absorption (2PA), excited-state absorption (ESA), and two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) because of highly polarizable valence band electrons at the AuNP surface,210,211 and they can enhance the NLO response of the surrounding environment by coupling the incident electromagnetic radiation with LSPR.14 AuNPs have responses on the femtosecond to nanosecond timescale, which is attractive for ultrafast applications such as OL devices for eye and optical sensor protection. However, bare AuNPs or weakly-stabilized AuNPs often precipitate or suffer structural modifications under the intense laser radiation required to observe NLO phenomena,212 so effective passivation of AuNPs is a necessary step to exploiting their potential.
TMCs exhibit intense MLCT and LMCT transitions that arise from the strong dπ–pπ orbital overlap between the metal centre and the ligand; as a result, they are of significant current interest in applications such as 2PA imaging and OL.213 The redox reversibility exhibited by certain TMCs can be exploited to introduce electrochemically-triggered NLA switching which permits greater control of the optical properties of molecular materials.214 Various studies have shown that TMCs display much larger NLA activity than their organic counterparts; this is particularly the case for metallated porphyrins and mono- and bis-alkynyl complexes of the late transition metals.44,215–217
The LSPR of AuNPs behaves as a strong dipole when it interacts with the electric component of the incident electromagnetic field, and thus the NLA responses of TMC/AuNP hybrids can be enhanced at the surface of the AuNP (Table 6). Hybridization of the Ir(III) complex 74 and AuNPs results in a 53-fold enhancement of σ2 at 760 nm compared to the free complex (74 38 GM cf.74-AuNP2 2000 GM), the enormous increase being attributed to the LSPR of the AuNP core.61 A blend of gold nanoparticles and the tetra-substituted ZnPc 95 in THF solution shows NLA due to self-healing of the AuNPs (95-AuNP),212 attributed to AuNP aggregation and surface passivation induced by 95 after melting of the AuNPs. The blend displays better OL performance than the AuNP or the ZnPc alone, and indeed has better OL performance than a fullerene benchmark with similar linear transmittance to 9 ns pulsed laser radiation at 532 nm (note that bare AuNPs precipitate under the same experimental conditions). The tris(1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) complex 96 exhibits NLA at short wavelengths (550–600 nm, assessed via the Z-scan technique and a 130 fs pulsed tunable laser), while the hybrid 96-AuNP (resulting from its attachment to 2–3 nm diameter AuNPs) is a saturable absorber in the same wavelength range;218,219 these TMC/AuNP hybrids are possible sensitizers in two-photon PDT.219

Exceptional 2PA performance is seen in metal alkynyl-based stars 97–99 attached to AuNPs of sizes ranging from 2.5 to 4.6 nm, with the highest 2PA cross-section of 3000000 GM at 500 nm (using 130 fs pulses) being observed for 98-AuNP.56 The organoruthenium/AuNP hybrids are highly transparent in the vis-NIR region, and exhibit better NLA performance at longer wavelengths than purely organic hybrids of a similar size (e.g.98-AuNPσ2,750 = 46000 ± 8100 GM, 99-AuNPσ2,800 = 130000 ± 32000 GM cf. n-dodecanethiol-coated AuNP σ2,750 = 23000 ± 4300 GM). AuNP hybrids of the organoruthenium OPEs 100, 101, 102, and 103, which possess different length arylalkynyl spacers, display strong 2PA activity in the UV-vis region and unprecedented 2PA performance in the second biological window (101-AuNPσ2,1050 = 20000 ± 10000 GM, 102-AuNPσ2,1050 = 26000 ± 4000 GM, 103-AuNPσ2,1050 = 38000 ± 13000 GM). Again, the organometallic/AuNP hybrids show superior performance to their organic counterpart, for which weak NLA activity is seen at wavelengths beyond 800 nm (σ2,1050 = 540 ± 130 GM).164
Ru(II) complex/AuNP hybrids have been used for sensing thiol-containing amino acids such as glutathione (GSH), homocysteine (Hcy) and cysteine (Cys) by exploiting changes in NLO properties. The thiol species displace complex 104 from the surface of the hybrid 104-AuNP, thereby recovering the 2PEF activity of the AuNP and the σ2 profile of the complex (104σ2 = 350 GM at 800 nm). This permits detection of the analytes with high sensitivity (LOD of 2.15 × 10−8 M (GSH), 4.86 × 10−8 M (Hcy), 4.86 × 10−8 M (Cys)) and over a wide range of concentrations (from 10−8–10−5 M).70
Hybrids of the ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes 105–107 and 42 to 47 nm diameter AuNPs exhibit 2PEF (105-AuNPn = 0, σ2 = 7.8 GM; 106-AuNPn = 1, σ2 = 187 GM; 107-AuNPn = 2, σ2,808 = 105 GM) and high photothermal therapy efficiency (η) in living cells (105-AuNPη = 25.9%; 106-AuNPη = 33.3%; 107-AuNPη = 23.5%).80 Photothermal images of the hybrids at equal concentrations (Fig. 11a) reveal that 106-AuNP reaches ca. 60 °C in ca. 5 min (this is the highest temperature from the series) upon excitation with an 808 nm laser with an intensity power of 0.8 W cm−2 (Fig. 11b). Cell viability studies on HeLa cancer cell cultures indicate that 106-AuNP is not cytotoxic when not irradiated (Fig. 11c), but irradiation at 808 nm with power intensities ranging from 0.3–1.0 mW cm−2 induces cell death of more than 80% of the culture; in contrast, the free complex 106 displays poor activity (Fig. 11d), suggesting that this hybrid could be a promising anti-cancer agent in photothermal therapy, and a luminescent probe in 2PEF imaging.

5.5. Catalysis
AuNPs possess a high surface energy and a high surface-to-volume ratio, and have consequently been explored as catalysts for a broad variety of organic reactions (e.g. nucleophilic additions, hydrogenation,220 oxidative coupling, carbon–carbon coupling, etc.).23,25,222 TMCs are fundamental to organic synthesis, and have been applied inter alia in various carbon–carbon and heteroatom-carbon cross-coupling reactions and hydrogenation reactions. Compared to individual AuNPs or TMCs, TMC/AuNP hybrids have been considerably less explored as catalysts; early studies have been reviewed elsewhere.119,223 Since these earlier reviews, polyferrocenylated/AuNP hybrids have been examined as catalysts for the reduction of p-nitrophenol, and shown to exhibit considerably higher activity than organic thiol-capped AuNPs,63,64 while hybrids of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and AuNPs coated with thiolated branched 1,3,5-triazines have been assessed as catalysts in Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling; although conversions of up to 85% were noted,96 the AuNPs did not provide any enhancement of activity compared to the TMC.
6. Conclusions and future prospects
The hybridization of molecular materials with AuNPs is of continuing interest to the scientific community due to the potential enhancements in chemical and physical properties that can ensue. Although hybridization of AuNPs with organics has thus far dominated this field, as summarized above the hybridization of AuNPs with TMCs has been shown to afford nanomaterials with enhanced properties that are of interest in applications such as photodynamic therapy, nonlinear optics, imaging and sensors.
This exciting contemporary field is simultaneously affording significant challenges and opportunities. The hybridization of disparate materials (in the present case transition metal complexes from the field of molecular chemistry and AuNPs from the nanoparticle domain), with their distinct synthetic procedures and physical properties, poses challenges in synthesis and characterization because the synthetic procedures and characterization techniques usually deployed for the TMC or AuNP in isolation may not be appropriate for the hybrid material. As a consequence of these difficulties, the majority of the TMCs to have been exploited thus far in AuNP hybrid syntheses have been robust “classical” examples that have straightforward syntheses and well-defined properties (e.g. porphyrins and ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl derivatives from coordination chemistry, ferrocene derivatives and metal alkynyls from organometallic chemistry). We can confidently anticipate that, as familiarity increases in handling the unique synthesis/characterization requirements of these hybrid materials, the broad palette of extant TMCs will be exploited in the search for new and enhanced properties. Simultaneously, the hybridization of TMCs with gold nano-crystals with shapes other than spherical or pseudo-spherical (e.g. nano-rods, nano-triangles, nano-plates, nano-cubes, etc.) is expected to increase, because hybridization with non-spherical nanoobjects will extend the capabilities of hybrids (for example, providing field enhancement at longer wavelengths, and thereby potentially affording access to materials functioning in the biological or telecommunications windows; as one possibility, the two LSPR modes present in gold nanorods can enhance the optical properties of TMCs displaying absorption in the visible and/or NIR (e.g. MPcs, porphyrins), and this is beneficial for applications in photothermal therapy, imaging and nonlinear optics56,61,62). The hybridization of TMCs with AuNPs that is the focus of this review is, in a sense, a microcosm of a wider trend in chemistry; viewed more broadly, the hybridization of TMCs with nanomaterials is opening new vistas at the nexus of coordination chemistry/organometallic chemistry and nanoscience, and exciting new developments in this frontier area can be confidently anticipated.
As has been highlighted in this review, the strong enhancement in singlet oxygen generation of MPc/AuNP hybrids compared to that of the individual components promises novel anti-cancer drugs, assuming that other necessary aspects of PDT performance (biocompatibility, bio-mobility) are addressed. The simultaneous photo- and thermal-therapy from the combination of MPcs and AuNPs is also an excellent example of the multifunctionality that is possible with hybrids. Other multifunctional TMC/AuNP hybrids have been exploited for multimodal imaging, while hybridization to afford novel theranostic materials also has considerable potential.
TMC/AuNP hybrids have been shown to be efficient electrochemical sensors and a critical component in multicomponent devices for the recognition of species of biological importance with exceptional sensitivity. The incorporation of TMC chromophores with reversible redox events into hybrids is also expected to enhance optical switching, with applications as advanced photonic materials. Examples of TMC/AuNPs suitable for electro-optical sensors and NLO devices remain scarce, but recent progress has demonstrated their promise in NLA applications. TMC/AuNP hybrids may also be suitable for applications in energy storage and energy conversion (e.g. redox flow batteries, solar cells), but if the redox processes occur in solution, challenges remain in the careful design of the shell of the hybrids, so as to avoid aggregation of the AuNP cores.
Finally, as mentioned above, while most of the “classic” TMCs have been hybridized with AuNPs and there remain many potential TMC candidates yet to be explored, a more crucial need is for quantitative structure–property studies to allow a detailed understanding of distance dependencies and associated quenching; in most reports so far, such studies remain to be promulgated.
