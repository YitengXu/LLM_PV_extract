    , Accepted 11th May 2015First published on 12th May 2015AbstractOrganic electronic devices are expected to be easily scalable and highly cost-effective, presuming the good solution processability of high-performance organic semiconductors. However, there are cases where an organic compound with promising semiconducting properties lacks adequate processability and does not form well-performing thin films through conventional solution-based deposition techniques. The photoprecursor approach, in which a soluble photoprecursor is solution-deposited on a substrate and then converted to a target material by in situ photoreaction, can be an effective means to evade such a problem. Herein, we describe a comparative evaluation of thin films deposited by three different methods; i.e., vacuum deposition, photoprecursor approach, and direct spin coating. Two highly crystalline molecular semiconductors, hexyl-substituted anthra[1,2-b:4,3-b′:5,6-b′′:8,7-b′′′]tetrathiophene (C6-ATT) and anthra[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (or bent anthradithiophene, C6-BADT), are employed in this study along with the corresponding newly synthesized α-diketone-type photoprecursors. In the case of C6-ATT, thin films prepared through the photoprecursor approach are as good as those obtained by vacuum deposition in terms of surface smoothness and space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) mobility, while direct spin coating affords highly inhomogeneous films. For C6-BADT, on the other hand, employment of the photoprecursor approach is not as effective, albeit it is still advantageous as compared to direct spin coating. These results highlight the power and limitations of the photoprecursor approach, and will serve as a basis for the preparation of practically useful organic devices through this unique approach.
1. Introduction
Solution processability is an important consideration in designing organic semiconductors, as facile and large-scale preparation of high-quality active layers is the key to achieving cost-effective organic devices.1–8 However, some molecular compounds with promising semiconducting properties are not well compatible with conventional direct solution deposition, typically because of too strong self-interactions. Such interactions often lead to undesirable formation of large aggregates, or even complete insolubility in customary solvents for intended solution-deposition processes. Unsubstituted acenes9 and tetrabenzoporphyrin10–14 represent this class of compounds, and their use in solution-processed devices has been largely limited owing to the lack of general approach to obtain smooth, homogeneous films that can be favourably used in, for example, organic solar cells or light-emitting diodes.15
The precursor approach, in which a well-soluble precursor compound is solution-deposited and then converted in situ to a target semiconductor, has been proposed to evade the above-mentioned obstacle. Among various types of precursor compounds, α-diketone-type photoprecursors of acenes are characterized by the extremely mild reaction conditions for their post-deposition conversion, where only visible-light irradiation is required.16 Several α-diketone-type precursors have been employed in the preparation of organic field-effect transistors and photovoltaic cells comprising hardly soluble acene compounds.17–21 In the case of pentacene and 2,6-di(2-thienyl)anthracene, this approach can afford high-quality semiconducting thin films that are comparable to the corresponding vacuum-deposited films in terms of charge-carrier mobility.19,21
Meanwhile, to our knowledge, there is not yet a report on direct comparison between the photoprecursor approach and conventional solution processes. Such a comparison will answer the question of whether the photoprecursor approach is merely a means to enable indirect solution deposition of insoluble materials, or holds any substantial difference from the direct solution deposition regarding the quality of resulting thin films. With these in mind, we have prepared α-diketone-type photoprecursors of two known soluble p-type semiconductors, tetrahexylanthra[1,2-b:4,3-b′:5,6-b′′:8,7-b′′′]tetrathiophene (C6-ATT) and dihexylanthra[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (C6-BADT) (Fig. 1). Derivatives of ATT and BADT have been the subject of interest in several studies on charge-carrier transport characteristics.22–28 These thieno-annulated anthracene systems have also been examined as building units of polymeric semiconductors.27,29
 Fig. 1  Structures of C6-ATT, C6-BADT, and their α-diketone-type photoprecursors 1 and 2. 
In the following sections, we describe the synthesis and reactivity of the α-diketone-type photoprecursors of C6-ATT and C6-BADT (compounds 1 and 2, respectively), as well as the difference between the thin films deposited through vacuum deposition, the photoprecursor approach, or direct spin coating. It is shown that, in the case of C6-ATT, the photoprecursor approach can provide thin films whose structural and (opto)electronic characteristics are similar to those of the vacuum deposited counterparts, while direct spin coating affords considerably lower quality films having large grains and cracks. The other compound, C6-BADT, is indicated to have stronger self-interactions compared to C6-ATT, and employment of the photoprecursor approach is not sufficient to obtain smooth films under the examined conditions. Nevertheless, the C6-BADT films prepared by the photoprecursor approach are still of higher quality than the directly spin-coated samples when the same solvent system and spin-coating conditions are employed.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The synthetic pathway to photoprecursor 1 is outlined in Fig. 2. C6-ATT was synthesized by the known oxidation of tetrathienylbenzene 3 with iron(III) chloride,25,30 employing slightly modified conditions from the reported ones to obtain an improved yield of 86%. C6-ATT is well soluble in common organic solvents (e.g., >10 mg mL−1 in chloroform), allowing straightforward purification by column chromatography. The Diels–Alder reaction of C6-ATT with vinylene carbonate was conducted by heating at 180 °C in an autoclave for 3 days to afford carbonate 4 in 76% yield. Compound 4 was hydrolyzed under basic conditions in 98% yield, and then subjected to Swern oxidation to afford the target α-diketone 1 as a yellow powder in an isolation yield of 28% after purification by silica gel column chromatography and recrystallization.

For clarity, only the first carbon atom is shown for each hexyl substituent, and the hydrogen atoms are omitted. 
The synthesis of photoprecursor 2 was performed as summarized in Fig. 3. The indium-catalyzed cyclization developed by Fürstner et al.31 afforded C6-BADT in 90% yield, which is as soluble as C6-ATT. This protocol gave higher yields and reproducibility in our hands, and allowed easier scale up compared to the known photochemical reaction employed in the cyclization of 2,5-bis(2-thienyl)-1,4-divinylbenzene.27 Similar to compound 1, the target α-diketone-type photoprecursor 2 was synthesized from C6-BADTvia the Diels–Alder addition with vinylene carbonate, hydrolysis under basic conditions, and Swern oxidation using trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) as an activator of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). After purification by silica gel column chromatography and recrystallization, compound 2 was isolated as a yellow powder in 57% yield.

For clarity, only the first carbon atom is shown for each hexyl substituent, and hydrogen atoms are omitted. 
Hence, the syntheses of new photoprecursors 1 and 2 were completed in few steps from the corresponding thienoanthracenes C6-ATT and C6-BADT, respectively. The final products and intermediates were unambiguously identified by 1H and 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopic measurements. In addition, the structures of 1 and 2 were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis as shown in Fig. 2b and 3b (see also Fig. S6 in ESI†). C6-ATT, C6-BADT, compounds 1 and 2 were all purified by recrystallization, and their purities were checked to be >99% by high-performance liquid chromatography prior to use in the preparation of thin films.
2.2. Photoreactivity
α-Diketone-type photoprecursors 1 and 2 are smoothly converted to the corresponding anthracene derivatives C6-ATT and C6-BADT, respectively, upon photoirradiation in solution. The quantitative one-to-one conversion was confirmed by monitoring the reactions with NMR and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4a, precursor 1 in CDCl3 shows a 1H NMR peak at 5.50 ppm corresponding to the bridgehead protons (Ha), which decreases and eventually disappears over the curse of the photoreaction. Concomitantly, a peak emerges at 8.67 ppm, which can be ascribed to the anthracene protons (Hb) of C6-ATT. The reaction completed without formation of any detectable side products in these measurements. The change in photoabsorption is associated with a clear isosbestic point at 439 nm (Fig. 4b), indicating the constant reaction stoichiometry and the absence of a secondary reaction. The quantitative conversion of 2 was also shown by the same experiments (Fig. S1 in ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Change in (a) NMR and (b) UV–vis absorption during the conversion of 1 to C6-ATT under photoirradiation. The NMR spectra were taken in CDCl3, while UV-vis spectra were measured in toluene. See ESI† for Experimental details. 
The reaction quantum yields (Φr) were determined based on the change in UV–vis absorption at the initial stage of each photoreaction (see the Experimental section for the method). The results show that increased thieno-annulation leads to lower efficiency of the photoreaction; namely, the Φr values in toluene are 0.37 for the parent anthracene diketone (ADK), 0.25 for the doubly thieno-annulated derivative 2, and 0.21 for the quadruply thieno-annulated derivative 1 (Table 1). At the same time, the Φr values of precursors 1 and 2 are still considerably higher than those of tetracene diketone (TDK, Φr ≈ 0.1) and pentacene diketone (PDK, Φr = 0.027). Here, Φr rapidly decreases with linear extension of the acene framework from ADK to TDK and to PDK, while the nonlinear thieno-annulation from ADK to 1 and to 2 results in relatively minor decrease in Φr.

Based on the above observations, photoreaction in the solid state was expected not to be a problem for 1 and 2, considering that PDK, which has a much lower Φr than 1 and 2, can be photoconverted to pentacene both in the thin-film and single-crystalline states.19,32 The solid-state conversion of precursors 1 and 2 to C6-ATT and C6-BADT, respectively, was monitored by IR spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 5. The carbonyl stretches of the α-diketone unit are observable around 1730 cm−1 for thin-film samples, which disappear upon irradiation of 470 nm light at 200 mW cm−2 for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere, indicating completion of the photo-induced decarbonylation in the films. Note that these conditions are the same as those employed for the photoconversion of the α-diketone-type precursor of linear anthradithiophene,18 while a longer reaction time is needed for PDK.19

2.3. Optoelectronic properties of thin films
UV–vis absorption characteristics are essentially the same for the three differently prepared films in each case of C6-ATT and C6-BADT. Specifically, the absorption spectra of C6-ATT films consist of five major peaks at around 330, 344, 380, 411, and 437 nm associated with an absorption onset at 445 nm (2.79 eV) regardless of the deposition process (Fig. 6a).
 Fig. 6  UV-vis absorption spectra of thin films deposited by the three different methods: (a) C6-ATT (b) C6-BADT. 
Similarly, C6-BADT films show absorption peaks at about 295, 390, and 425 nm associated with an absorption onset at around 445 nm with little variations among the three differently prepared samples (Fig. 6b).
Both compounds show redshift of the photoabsorption peaks in the solid state as compared to in solution. The degree of redshift is larger for C6-BADT, the longest-wavelength absorption peak of which shifts by ca. 0.10 eV from 411 to 425 nm associated with considerable broadening of all the peaks. This indicates perturbation of molecular electronic structure in the thin films through nonspecific intermolecular interactions involving multiple modes and degrees. The corresponding redshift is smaller for C6-ATT, being only 0.04 eV from 431 to 437 nm with relatively minor broadening of the peaks. Consequently, the absorption onset of C6-BADT is essentially the same as that of C6-ATT in the thin-film state. These observations indicate that C6-BADT has somewhat stronger intermolecular interactions than C6-ATT in the solid state. At the same time, no effective, specific intermolecular interaction that leads to the emergence of a new peak is indicated in these spectra even for C6-BADT. This is in contrast to the case of pentacene deposited by the photoprecursor approach, which shows long-wavelength absorption and fluorescent peaks that can be attributed to the formation of π-stacks in the solid state.33
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies of C6-ATT and C6-BADT in the thin-film state were estimated by photo-electron spectroscopy (PES) in air.34 Here again, the difference in the deposition process does not lead to major changes; namely, the observed HOMO energies are from −5.52 to −5.47 eV for C6-ATT and from −5.43 to −5.39 eV for C6-BADT (Table 2 and Fig. S2 and S3 in ESI†). The HOMO levels were also estimated from the onset of the first oxidation potential (Eoxonset) in cyclic voltammograms (CVs) according to the known empirical equation HOMO = −Eoxonset −4.8 eV, where Eoxonset is referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium standard.35 The obtained values are −5.25 and −5.40 eV for C6-ATT and C6-BADT, respectively (Fig. S4 in ESI†). Thus, C6-BADT has a lower HOMO level than C6-ATT in solution according to the CVs, which parallels the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. S5 in ESI†). On the other hand, the PES measurements indicate that the HOMO level is higher for C6-BADT in thin films. This discrepancy is assumed to be caused by the difference in intermolecular interactions in the condensed phase, as observed in the UV–vis spectra of the thin films. The LUMO levels were also estimated based on the equation LUMO = HOMO + Eg,opt, where Eg,opt stands for the optical band gap obtained from the UV–vis absorption spectra of thin films. The values are summarized in Table 2.

2.4. Structural characteristics of thin films
Thin films of C6-ATT and C6-BADT were prepared on ITO/glass substrates with a MoO3 buffer layer, which were also used for the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements described in the next section. Vacuum deposition was performed at a rate of 1.8 nm min−1 and a pressure of 1.2 × 10−4 Pa. Deposition by the photoprecursor approach was conducted by spin coating of a 10 mg mL−1 solution of photoprecursor 1 or 2 in chloroform at 800 rpm, followed by irradiation of 470 nm light at 200 mW cm−2 for 30 min in a nitrogen atomosphere. Direct solution deposition was first tried by spin coating of a 10 mg mL−1 solution of C6-ATT or C6-BADT in chloroform at 800 rpm as in the case of the photoprecursor approach; however, highly inhomogeneous films with visually observable cracks were obtained in these cases. The unfavourable morphology can be ascribed to the high tendency of C6-ATT and C6-BADT to aggregate from the chloroform solutions, and in turn, it is a clear manifestation of the power of the photoprecursor approach to afford smoother films based on such materials. The quality of directly spin-coated films was improved when a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and chlorobenzene was used as solvent, so that the resulting films look homogeneous to the eye.
The microscopic surface morphology of the resulting films was investigated by tapping-mode atomic-force microscopy (AFM), and the crystallinity of the films was examined by out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fig. 7 shows the results for three differently prepared samples of C6-ATT. The vacuum-deposited film has a relatively smooth surface with a root-mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.94 nm (Fig. 7a). It also has a moderate crystallinity showing a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.62° (d = 19.1 Å) associated with a weak diffraction at 2θ = 9.25° (d = 9.56 Å) (Fig. 7d). Although these peaks do not match with the diffraction pattern simulated from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data (Table S3 in ESI†), the d-spacing calculated for the first diffraction is close to the lateral molecular dimension of C6-ATT (∼21 Å, Fig. S6a in ESI†), indicating an edge-on mode arrangement of molecules towards the substrate. The thin-film deposited via the photoprecursor approach has a smoother surface having an RMS value of 0.69 nm, and the difference between the highest and lowest points is only about 5 nm in the observed area (Fig. 7b). The XRD pattern is similar to that of the vacuum deposited film, but with weaker peak intensities so that the second peak cannot be distinguish from the noise (Fig. 7e).
 Fig. 7  AFM images (a–c) and out-of-plane XRD patterns (d–f) of thin films of C6-ATT. Thin films are prepared by vacuum deposition (a and d), the photoprecursor approach (b and e), or direct spin coating (c and f). 
The surface morphology of the film directly spin-coated from a chloroform–chlorobenzene (1:1) solution is significantly different from the two described above—the film contains large grains, whose lateral dimensions reach a few μm or even larger (Fig. 7c). The height difference within the observed area is over 50 nm, which is similar to the average thickness of the film (ca. 50 nm). This high roughness prevents the film from being employed in the SCLC measurement, since the effective film thickness and interface area are hard to define. It would also be unfavourable to employ such a highly inhomogeneous film in electronic devices. The X-ray diffraction from the directly spin-coated film is significantly stronger compared to the films prepared by vacuum deposition and the photoprecursor approach (Fig. 7d–f). This indicates that large crystalline domains are formed in the direct spin-coating conditions, which correlates well with the observation of significantly large domains by AFM.

Fig. 8 summarizes the results for C6-BADT. The vacuum-deposited film of C6-BADT has larger grains compared to the corresponding C6-ATT film, indicating a higher tendency of the former compound to aggregate than the latter. This is consistent with the results of UV–vis and ionization potential measurements described earlier in Section 2.3. On the other hand, the surface roughness is similar for the two cases; specifically, the RMS values are 1.94 and 1.66 nm for the vacuum deposited C6-ATT and C6-BADT, respectively (Fig. 7a and 8a). The XRD measurement gave four distinct peaks at 2θ = 4.91, 9.90, 14.7, 19.8° corresponding to the d-spacings of 18.0, 8.93, 6.03, and 4.48 Å, respectively (Fig. 8d). The first peak is not very far from the (001) diffraction of the previously reported single-crystal structure (c = 22.2 Å), indicating an end-on-mode arrangement of molecules against the substrate.27 The deviation of about 4 Å may be explained by a tilt of molecules in relation to the c* axis in the thin-film state compared to the α (90°) or β (91°) of the single-crystal unit cell, or difference in the orientation of alkyl chains.
 Fig. 8  AFM images (a–c) and out-of-plane XRD patterns (d–f) of thin films of C6-BADT. The samples are prepared by vacuum deposition (a and d), the photoprecursor approach (b and e), or direct spin coating (c and f). 
The XRD pattern of the C6-BADT film deposited by the photoprecursor approach is similar to that of the vacuum-deposited film, having a strong diffraction at 2θ = 4.89° associated with weak diffractions at 9.82, 14.7, and 19.9°, although the third peak is hard to distinguish from the noise (Fig. 8e). On the other hand, the AFM images show different features between those two films; namely, the film prepared from the photoprecursor 2 has larger, but structurally less defined domains (Fig. 8b). The RMS value is as large as 19.2 nm, with the difference between the highest and lowest points exceeding 100 nm within the scanned area. Further investigation has revealed that the film deposited by the photoprecursor approach is similar to the directly spin-coated films in terms of surface roughness in the case of C6-BADT. The RMS value for the directly spin-coated film is 16.4 nm, and the difference between the highest and lowest points is over 100 nm (Fig. 8c). On the other hand, the grain size is much larger for direct spin coating, probably because of the use of a higher boiling-point solvent (chlorobenzene) and thus slower growth of crystallites. In accordance with this, the intensity of X-ray diffraction is much stronger for the directly spin-coated film (Fig. 8f).
These results demonstrate the potential and limitations of the photoprecursor approach. It can be stated that the solution processability of highly crystalline materials is generally improved by employing the photoprecursor approach. This was manifested by the difference in the quality of C6-ATT and C6-BADT films when chloroform was employed as a solo solvent—direct spin coating led to cracked films whereas the films were visually homogeneous when deposited by the photoprecursor approach. Indeed, the film quality in terms of microscopic surface morphology and crystallinity is as high as the vacuum-deposited film in the case of C6-ATT. For C6-BADT, on the other hand, the quality of the thin film prepared by the photoprecursor approach is considerably lower than the vacuum-deposited sample. The intrinsic aggregation property of C6-BADT seems to have a more profound effect than that of C6-ATT, and is hard to overcome just by employing the photoprecursor approach at least under the examined conditions.
2.5. Space-charge-limited-current measurements
The charge-carrier mobility in C6-ATT deposited by the photoprecursor approach was measured by the SCLC technique. While the field-effect mobility probes the property of materials only at the interface with gate dielectrics, the SCLC method evaluates the bulk mobility, and thus would be more suitable when comparing bulk qualities of thin films.
Hole-only devices with the structure of [ITO/MoO3/C6-ATT/MoO3/Al] were fabricated for the measurements. As shown in Fig. S7b of ESI,† a carrier mobility of 2.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained when the active layer was deposited by the photoprecursor approach. This value is in the same range as that obtained for a vacuum deposited film (1.79 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, Fig. S7a in ESI†), which is reasonable considering that these two deposition methods afford thin films having similar crystallinity and morphology as described in Section 2.4. The directly spin-coated film of C6-ATT is too rough to obtain a reliable mobility by the SCLC method, because its effective thickness is hard to define. For the same reason, SCLC mobilities were not measured for the solution-processed films of C6-BADT.
3. Conclusions
We have synthesized new α-diketone-type photoprecursors 1 and 2, and evaluated the thin films of C6-ATT and C6-BADT deposited by the photoprecursor approach in comparison with those prepared by vacuum deposition and direct spin coating. The syntheses were completed in good overall yields from the known starting materials, and the target photoprecursors were unambiguously identified by spectroscopic analyses and single-crystal X-ray diffractometry. The comparative evaluation revealed that, in the case of C6-ATT, the photoprecursor approach provided thin films that have considerably higher quality than the directly spin-coated samples, and are comparable to the vacuum deposited counterparts in terms of surface morphology and SCLC mobility. In contrast, the photoprecursor approach had only limited success under the examined processing conditions in the case of C6-BADT, which seemed to have a stronger tendency to self-aggregate in comparison with C6-ATT according to the spectroscopic and microscopic analyses.
These results show that the photoprecursor approach is more than just a way to enable the use of solution-based techniques for deposition of insoluble (or hardly soluble) materials. Rather, this approach also extends the range of applicable solution-processing conditions for soluble semiconducting materials. As observed for C6-ATT, the photoprecursor approach can afford thin films of much higher quality than direct solution deposition without an extensive search for processing conditions. Even in the more difficult case of C6-BADT, the film quality is higher for the photoprecursor method than direct spin coating when the same solvent (chloroform) was employed. It would be worth noting here that the α-diketone-type photoprecursors 1 and 2 are well soluble in common organic solvents and not strongly aggregating, so that their thin films are highly homogeneous without forming large grains in a wide variety of spin-coating conditions (different solvent systems, solution concentrations, spin rates, etc.) (Fig. S8 in ESI†). This considerably simplifies the optimization of solution-deposition conditions, and is highly advantageous especially when the choice of solvent is limited—a typical example is the solution processing of multi-layer thin films by employing orthogonal solvent systems. In addition, the photoprecursor approach allows us to control the film morphology through adjusting the photoreaction conditions including the light intensity and duration, or by the use of small amounts of solvent additives.19 Further investigation along these lines is underway in our group.

4.1. Synthesis and structural characterization of compounds

General. 
Anhydrous THF (super plus grade, stabilizer free), toluene (super plus grade), and CH2Cl2 (super grade) were obtained from Kanto Chemical and used as received. Anhydrous DMSO (super dehydrated grade) was obtained from Wako Chemical, and used as received. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine was distilled and stored over KOH. All the other solvents and chemicals were of the reagent grade and obtained commercially and used without further purification. Room temperature, or rt, means 20–25 °C. Thin layer chromatography and flash column chromatography were performed on Merck Silica Gel 60 F254 (Art. 5554) and Kanto Silica Gel 60N (spherical, 40–50 μm), respectively. 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JNM-AL300 or a JNM-ECP400 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane or solvent resonances as internal standards. Mass spectra were recorded on a JEOL AccuTOF/JMS-T100LC (ESI), JEOL JMS-700 (EI), or a Bruker Autoflex II (MALDI-TOF) instrument. Infrared spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-4200 spectrometer with an ATR PRO450-S attachment. Melting points were measured on a Stanford Research System OptiMelt MPA100 apparatus.

4.2. Photoreaction quantum yield determination
A chemical actinometer (K3[Fe(C2O4)3])36 was used for quantum yield determination of the photochemical reaction of ADK in toluene. A square quartz cuvette (10 mm I.D.) that contained a deaerated solution (3.0 mL) of ADK was irradiated with 468 nm light through a monochromator (Ritsu MC-10N) using a 500 W xenon lamp (Ushio XB-50102AA-A). The photochemical reaction was monitored by using a JASCO UV/vis/NIR V-570 spectrophotometer. The quantum yields were determined from the increase in the absorbance of anthracene at 378 nm in the beginning of the reaction. The Φr values of other compounds (TDK, PDK, 1, and 2) were measured by the relative method using the value for ADK (Φr = 0.37) as the standard.
4.3. Film preparation and characterization
Three methods were employed to prepare the films of C6-ATT and C6-BADT: (a) vacuum deposition of C6-ATT or C6-BADT with a deposition rate of 1.8 nm min−1; (b) the photoprecursor approach in which a solution of 1 or 2 in chloroform (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 800 rpm for 30 s and the resulting film was irradiated with a blue LED (λ ≈ 470 nm) at 200 mW cm−2 for 30 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox; (c) direct spin coating of a solution of C6-ATT or C6-BADT in chlorobenzene/chloroform (1:1 by volume, 10 mg mL−1) at 800 rpm for 30 s. The thicknesses of the resulting films were measured by Bruker DektakXT. UV-vis absorption spectra of thin films on glass substrates were recorded in air using a JASCO V-650 spectrometer. Ionization energies were measured on a Bunko Keiki AC-3 photoelectron spectroscopy instrument. The surface morphology of organic films was observed using an SII SPA400/SPI3800N atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode with a silicon probe at a resonant frequency of 138 kHz and a force constant of 16 N m−1 (SII, SI-DF20). The bulk structure of thin-films was evaluated by out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). Hole mobility characteristics were measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method using an Agilent Technologies 4155C Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer operated by Interactive Characterization Software (ICS), version 3.6.0.
