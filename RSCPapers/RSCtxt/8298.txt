    , Accepted 20th December 2018First published on 20th December 2018AbstractDesigning efficient yet robust photoanodes for water oxidation stands out as a major bottleneck in the realization of a feasible photoelectrochemical tandem cell for solar water splitting. Spinel copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) has been recently reported as a potential candidate photoanode, exhibiting an extended light absorption (band gap of 1.9 eV) with respect to traditional metal oxides. However, limiting factors dictating the poor performance (0.5 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs. RHE) remain unclear. Here, CuFe2O4 thin-film photoanodes were examined using frequency-dependent electrochemical techniques, namely photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS), to provide a detailed description of the photogenerated charge carrier behaviour under operational conditions. Results evidenced a strong Fermi level pinning during oxygen evolution caused by the accumulation of surface intermediates and a relatively slow rate of charge transfer (ktran ∼ 5 s−1). Moreover, the short hole diffusion length (Lp ∼ 4 nm) and the low charge collection efficiency (below 10%) further prevent efficient charge extraction. Overall, these findings point towards the need of both film nanostructuring and surface engineering to further advance this photoanode.
Introduction
Converting solar energy into high-value chemicals (e.g. hydrogen, methane, ethylene, etc.)1,2 offers not only a promising way to store energy in fuels that could replace fossil sources, but also represents a sustainable route to produce vital chemical feedstocks for industry.3–7 Among the different technologies capable of solar-to-chemical conversion, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) tandem cell concept has drawn much attention in virtue of its simplicity in design and maximum predicted conversion efficiency (>20% for solar-to-hydrogen conversion). However, finding low-cost photoanode materials capable of oxidizing water into oxygen while also combining a high-conversion efficiency with a long-term stability arises as the current bottleneck for the realization of this technology.8 Semiconducting materials based on metal oxides such as TiO2,9 α-Fe2O3,10 BiVO411 and WO312 have been extensively studied, with BiVO4 recently showing benchmark stability (>1000 h) and conversion efficiencies. However, its performance is limited by a relative large band gap energy (Eg = 2.4 eV).13 Thus new materials are urgently needed. Currently, the family of spinel ferrites with a general formula MFe2O4 (M: Cu, Mg, Zn, etc.) is receiving increasing attention for PEC water splitting,14–16 leveraging the broad tunability of optoelectronic properties attainable by changing the divalent cation M.
Spinel copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) has been recently reported as a photoanode for water oxidation, with the advantage of displaying a relatively narrow Eg (∼1.9 eV) compared to common metal oxides used for this application.17 However, the photocurrent displayed by this material (∼0.5 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) lies far below that reported for its counterpart, ZnFe2O4 (1.7 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs. RHE).18 However, contrary to the intensive research carried out in past years on ZnFe2O4,17,18 only a couple of reports have dealt with CuFe2O4,19 providing a rather vague description of the parameters that govern its low photoelectrocatalytic response. In a previous study,17 our group elucidated that surface and, especially, bulk recombination were responsible for the poor performance, although information regarding the kinetics of the competitive processes occurring in the bulk and at the interface with electrolyte, or the energetics across the interface during operation remained unexplored.
Here, with the aim of providing a complete description of the photogenerated carriers behaviour in the bulk and at the interface with the electrolyte during operation, a set of frequency-domain electrochemical measurements, viz. photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS), were employed to investigate state-of-the-art CuFe2O4 photoanodes. Results evidenced a strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) during the oxygen evolution that correlates accordingly with the built-up capacitance at the interface and the relatively slow rate of charge transfer. More generally, a complete overview of the physico-chemical and (photo)electrocatalytical properties of this material is provided, unveiling the intrinsic limitations for solar-to-energy conversion and directing future investigations to address them.
Experimental
Synthesis of CuFe2O4 photoanode
Nanostructured CuFe2O4 photoanodes were synthesized by a solution-based chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach, previously reported by our group.17 Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (Solaronix TCO10-10) were positioned vertically and immersed into aqueous solution containing 0.15 M iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 99+%, Acros) and 1 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 99+%, Acros). The CBD was carried out at 100 °C for 5 h to grow β-FeOOH on the FTO. After rinsing with deionized water and drying with compressed air, the β-FeOOH thin films were placed on a 100 °C hotplate where a solution of 0.1 M copper(II) nitrate hydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was drop-cast on top of the β-FeOOH. Samples were then introduced into a tube furnace (MTI OTF-1200X-S) preheated at 800 °C for 15 minutes to form spinel type CuFe2O4. After cooling to room temperature, samples were soaked in 7 M HNO3 (4 h) to etch away excess CuO. Finally, an annealing at 550 °C for 5 hours was performed. A complete characterization of the morphology, optical properties and Raman spectrum is included in the ESI.† A roughness factor of 4, estimated from the scanning electron microscopy images (Fig. S1†), was considered for the analysis of the impedance measurements and the Gärtner model.
Photoelectrochemical characterization
A 3-electrode configuration (CuFe2O4 working electrode, a platinum counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode) was set up in a Cappuccino-type cell with an aperture area of 0.238 cm2. A Xenon arc lamp (Newport 66921, 450 W), calibrated to AM 1.5G, was used as light source for photocurrent and impedance measurements. Monochromatic illumination at 452 nm was provided from an array of RGBW Star LEDs (Cree) with a calibrated incident photon flux of 1.09 × 1021 m−2 s−1. Unless otherwise stated, the CuFe2O4 photoanode was illuminated from the substrate side in 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH 13.6, Reactolab SA). For experiments containing sacrificial agent, 0.5 mL of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%, Reactolab SA) was added into 9.5 mL of 1 M NaOH solution. Electrochemical measurements were carried with a Bio-Logic SP-300 potentiostat coupled with the EC-Lab (V11.12) electrochemical platform. For linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 was used. For PEIS measurements, the voltage perturbation was applied within a frequency range from 100 kHz to 50 mHz with a 25 mV sinusoidal amplitude. An equivalent circuit modelling software ZView (Scribner Associates) was used to fit the PEIS data. The applied potentials in all the measurements were referred to the RHE using the following conversion: VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.197(1)
Intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage measurements
For both IMPS and IMVS experiments, a white LED (Cree XLamp MC-E White) running at 3 V (200 mA) DC background was used as the light source. The white LED was powered by a triple power supply (HAMEG HM8040-2) and its light intensity was sinusoidally perturbated by an arbitrary function generator (Tektronix AFG3021C) with a peak amplitude of 200 mV and a modulation frequency range from 100 kHz to 50 mHz. The same 3-electrode configuration as described in the previous section was used. In IMPS experiments, the applied potential on working electrode was controlled by a potentiostat (Thompson Electrochem model 251) and was additionally monitored by a general digital multimeter (UNI-T UT58B). The intensity-modulated photocurrent response was recorded by a digital phosphor oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO7254C) via a 50 Ω series resistor (Velleman E6/E12). In IMVS experiments, the intensity-modulated open-circuit photovoltage response was recorded with the oscilloscope. The entire IMPS/IMVS setup was enclosed with blackout materials to prevent interference from ambient light. IMPS data was processed and fitted using a custom program written with the Python programming language. The lmfit package for Python was used to perform curve fitting with nonlinear regression.

In situ UV-Vis measurements
A 3-electrode setup configuration was set up in a cuvette (Hellma Analytics OS, 10 mm) fixed with a 3D printed cuvette extender. A CuFe2O4 thin film was specially cut into a size of 9 × 50 mm to fit into the cuvette as a working electrode. The setup was settled inside a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) and controlled with a Bio-Logic SP-50 potentiostat. The baseline was recorded under open circuit conditions.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows current–voltage characteristics of a typical CuFe2O4 measured under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation and in the dark. As expected, a photoanodic current is recorded, with an onset at approximately 1.0 V vs. RHE and reaching values of 35 μA cm−2 and 0.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and 1.6 V vs. RHE, respectively. These samples, whose performance matches well with that previously reported,17 will be used as a model material to study the parameters that limit the performance in CuFe2O4 photoanodes.
 Fig. 1  Current–voltage characteristics of CuFe2O4 photoanode measured at simulated 1 sun condition and dark condition in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. 
To begin to separately understand the electrical properties of the bulk CuFe2O4 and the semiconductor–liquid junction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was first carried out. Fig. 2 illustrates the Nyquist plots obtained at four representative applied potentials in the dark (Fig. 2a) and under illumination (Fig. 2b). In the presence of light, the impedance spectra are characterized by two semicircles. The high frequency semicircle relates to the electrical response in the space charge region and the low frequency semicircle is assigned to the interfacial charge transfer behaviour. Qualitatively, the size of the low frequency semicircle is observed to decrease with increasing bias. This suggests an amelioration in charge transfer that is clearly supported by the increased photocurrent. Indeed, this behaviour is consistent with similar studies on α-Fe2O3 photoanode reported by Hamann and co-workers.20 A quantitative description of the electrical properties can be obtained by fitting the impedance spectra to an equivalent circuit. The proposed equivalent circuit, previously used in similar systems,21 consists of series resistance RS, bulk capacitance Cbulk, resistance of hole trapping to surface states Rtrap, surface state capacitance CSS and charge transfer resistance from surface states to oxidize water Rct,ss (Fig. 2b inset). In the absence of illumination, the impedance response displays only one semicircle and can be fit by the Randles circuit that consists of RS, Cbulk and charge transfer resistance from bulk Rct,bulk (Fig. 2a inset).

Fig. 3a shows the Mott–Schottky plot constructed with the values of Cbulk extracted from the impedance spectra measured in the dark condition and under illumination. The positive slope in the well-defined linear region confirms the n-type character of the CuFe2O4 thin films, whereas its value reveals a donor density ND of 3.83 × 1018 cm−3 under illumination and 3.61 × 1018 cm−3 in the dark (considering a dielectric constant19 of 20 and the aforementioned roughness factor of 4). The higher ND under illumination is consistent with the addition of light-induced free charge carriers. Similar behaviour has also been found in α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.22 The value of ND is similar to that previously reported for nanoparticulate CuFe2O4.19 Likewise, a positive shift in the flat band potential (Vfb) from 0.73 V to 0.78 V vs. RHE is a sign that surface states charging under illumination introduce a downward shift of the band edges.22 It is worth noting that the photocurrent onset potential (potential where the photocurrent reaches 10 μA cm−2) is delayed with respect to Vfb by around 175 mV. This is a common feature of semiconductor photoelectrodes where the high degree of surface charge recombination and accumulation prevent efficient charge separation.23 It is worth noting that the slope of Mott–Schottky plot obtained under illumination decreases in the range from 1.3 V to 1.5 V vs. RHE, suggesting an sluggish development of band bending in this region. This has been typically associated with the so-called FLP, whereby in this range of potential operation we could expect that most of the applied potential drops across the Helmholtz layer rather than across the space charge region. In the voltage region before the FLP, the depletion width W can be estimated by: (2)where ε is dielectric constant of CuFe2O4 and ε0 is vacuum permittivity. At 1.3 V vs. RHE, W is estimated to be 18 nm. Since W is sufficiently smaller than the feature size (ca. 100 nm Fig. S1†), Mott–Schottky analysis of the CuFe2O4 film is reasonably valid. However, this small depletion width caused by the high ND can prevent an efficient charge separation process if the diffusion length of free charges is also small (vide infra).

Assuming a density-of-state effective mass for electrons mde of 20 × 10−31 kg,24 the effective density of states in the conduction band NC is given by:25 (3)where k is Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature and h is Planck constant. NC is estimated to be 8.07 × 1019 cm−3. Since ND/NC < 0.05, CuFe2O4 prepared by the method employed in this study is a nondegenerate semiconductor.26 The Boltzmann statistics can be applied:25 (4)where ECB is conduction band position and EF is Fermi level. At flat band condition, ECB is found to be around 78 mV above EF.
Following the analysis of the parameters extracted from PEIS, CSS reveals the build-up of interfacial capacitance caused by the accumulation of charges at the electrode/electrolyte junction during the water oxidation reaction. This can be directly converted into a density of surface states (DOS) by:22 CSS = q × DOS(5)

Fig. 3b shows both DOS related to the charges accumulated at the interface and the photocurrent recorded under chopped light-illumination. As shown, DOS are fit with a Gaussian function, whose integration reveals a total density of surface states NSS of (1.88 ± 0.03) 1014 cm−2. Note that this value of NSS is above the threshold considered to cause FLP23 in agreement therefore with the fact that this DOS falls within the potential range where the FLP was found to occur in the Mott–Schottky plot. In fact, this phenomenon of FLP has also been described by Bisquert, Hamann and co-workers on α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.22 Overall, the existence of FLP added to the previously discussed small W, could further hamper an efficient charge separation process.
Interestingly, the magnitude of the anodic photocurrent transient spikes, as shown on the intermitted photocurrent response superimposed on Fig. 3b, typically related to the surface recombination between photogenerated electrons and accumulated-holes at the interface, matches quite well with the energetic distribution of DOS, reaching both a maximum at around 1.42 V vs. RHE. This result supports the notion that CSS corresponds to accumulated-holes at the electrode/electrolyte interface. We note that the energetic location of DOS lies next to the onset of photocurrent, in agreement with a recent report on α-Fe2O3 photoanodes22 and many other metal oxide photoelectrodes.17 These findings suggests that surface charge accumulation is a pre-requisite to trigger water oxidation reaction, and that these accumulated-holes correspond to intermediates species of the reaction, likely surface hydroxyl groups and high-valent metal–oxo complexes.27 We therefore hypothesize that these DOS are indeed intermediate states involved in the water oxidation reaction, rather than intrinsic surface traps. In fact, in our previous study,17 we evidenced the presence of the latter at 0.75 V vs. RHE by using rapid-scan voltammetry. To further support our hypothesis, in situ UV-Vis spectroscopy was utilized to track the high-valent transition metal intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction. The in situ UV-Vis spectrum displayed in Fig. S7† revealed a broad absorption band centred around 500 nm when CuFe2O4 was held at 1.8 V vs. RHE to perform water oxidation. Interestingly, this band is very similar to that previously attributed to Fe(IV)O intermediate species on α-Fe2O3 photoanodes,28,29 although it appears to blueshift in CuFe2O4. We hypothesize that the band shift is probably caused by the presence of Cu in high proximity to Fe in the lattice, which could affect the ligand-field splitting of surface-associated Fe(IV)O species. In fact, similar effects have been reported in other systems, for instance, the presence of phosphate ions in solution has demonstrated to alter the d–d transitions associated to Mn3+ species during water oxidation reaction.30
In order to gain new insights into the charge carrier dynamics within the bulk and at the interface with the electrolyte, IMPS and IMVS measurements were next performed. Based on the generalized IMPS theory proposed by Ponomarev and Peter, intensity-modulated photocurrent response j(ω) can be expressed as:31 (6)where jh denotes the hole current towards interface and τd is the mean transit time for photogenerated electrons. ktran and krec are pseudo-first order rate constant for charge transfer and recombination, respectively. CSC and CH represent capacitance of the space charge layer and the Helmholtz layer. Here, α (0 < α ≤ 1) was introduced as a non-ideality factor. In the case where α = 1, the last term of eqn (6): 1/(1 + iωτd) corresponds to an ideal Debye relaxation model with a single time constant (τd). The case where α < 1 corresponds to a Cole–Cole relaxation model32,33 where a dispersion of relaxation time constants is considered around the value of τd. This dispersion accounts for surface inhomogeneity and frequency dependent dielectric constant.34 First, compared with an ideal planar surface, nanostructured films like the ones reported herein, could display a complex carrier behaviour induced, for instance, by having a small portion of fully depleted features.35 Second, the dependency between dielectric constant of CuFe2O4 and frequency was reported by Selvan et al.36 and can be attributed to the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars polarization.37–39 Note, for example, that for an ideal semiconductor–liquid junction, α = 1, an IMPS response would display one or several regular semicircles in the Nyquist plot.

Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist plots obtained for the IMPS measurements as a function of the applied potential. Note that the deformation of the semicircles could be accurately described by eqn (6) with the introduction of an α = 0.9, which accounts for the observed broadening. From the fitting of the complex IMPS plot a τd value of approximately 0.6 ms and independent of the voltage was extracted (Fig. S5†). Commonly, τd is considered a metric of the bulk transport, i.e., the longer the value the higher the degree of trapping/recombination.40,41 Similar values on the order of milliseconds have been reported previously in nanostructured thin-film photoanodes of α-Fe2O342 and WO3,41 suggesting that processes controlling bulk trapping/recombination are similar among these systems. However, it must be noted that this parameter does not contain all the information regarding bulk recombination. Indeed, recombination processes are known to occur in the bulk (such as α-Fe2O3)43 at much shorter timescales (<μs), out of the scope of this technique. Therefore, we cannot discard that differences in the carrier dynamics at the sub-microsecond time scale after carrier photogeneration could explain the poor yields of charge separation reported for CuFe2O4.17,44
 Fig. 4  Nyquist plot of IMPS response measured from 0.7 V to 1.6 V vs. RHE, including the corresponding fitting curves using eqn (6) (solid lines). 
The analysis of complex IMPS plots also revealed the charge-transfer (ktran) and surface recombination (krec) rate constants, which are presented as a function of the applied potential in Fig. 5. Interestingly, two distinct regions are noticeable in the plot. One, at low applied potentials (from 0.7 V to 1.1 V vs. RHE) where ktran remains constant while krec decreases from 8 s−1 to 5 s−1, and a second region at applied potentials above 1.1 V vs. RHE, where ktran increases while krec remain steady in the range of 3 s−1 to 2 s−1. Within the first region, small photocurrents are recorded although transient spikes are already noticeable, whereas in the second region the photocurrent starts to increase steadily. The behaviour observed at lower applied potentials suggests that no FLP exists, or at least not to a significant degree, and that the poor photocurrent development might be related therefore to intrinsic bulk limitations that prevent an efficient charge separation. At higher applied bias, the steady increase in ktran but constant krec are indicative of FLP. Broadly speaking, the accumulation of photogenerated holes at the interface would cause that within this potential region, additional applied bias would drop across the Helmholtz layer, rather than across the space charge region, leaving unchanged the degree of band bending (krec remains constant) but causing the band edges to shift downwards in energy increasing the driving force for charge transfer (ktran increases). These findings agree with the build-up of intermediates inferred from the PEIS measurements and suggests that the relatively slow rate of charge transfer (ktran ∼ 5 s−1) plays a critical role in the occurrence of FLP. Interestingly, the region ktran exceeds krec is where photocurrent starts to increase. This clearly indicates that the competing surface recombination will strongly limit the effectiveness of the water oxidation reaction. Note that other metal oxides have shown faster charge transfer kinetics, viz. the ktran of BiVO4 and α-Fe2O3 have been reported with an magnitude of 10 s−1 to 100 s−1.45–47

To further advance in the understanding of the bulk electronic properties of this materials, IMVS measurements were carried out. This technique has been widely used for characterizing the electron lifetime in solar cells such as perovskite solar cells,48 dye-sensitized solar cells49 and polymer solar cells.50 More recently, a few reports have explored the implementation of this tool to interrogate photoelectrochemical systems. The advantage of IMVS is that, since it is performed in open circuit conditions (i.e., no current flowing across the interface), the extracted information corresponds primarily to the bulk properties without influence of charge transfer characteristics.47,51 In brief, the angular frequency at the minimal value, fmin(IMVS), of the IMVS Nyquist plot is inversely related to the first-order electron lifetime τn: τn = (2πfmin(IMVS))−1(7)

Fig. 6 displays the Nyquist plot corresponding to the IMVS response of the CuFe2O4 photoanode, where only one semicircle is located in the fourth quadrant. τn, derived from highlighted point in the IMVS response, is approximately equal to 2.7 ms. This value represents the lifetime of the majority carriers in the system under open circuit conditions, showing good agreement with IMVS measurements of other photoelectrodes.52,53 It is worth noting that this value should be taken with caution since, as mentioned above in the case of τd, this lifetime suggests a low degree of bulk recombination in the system but leaves aside all recombination processes occurring at much shorter timescales that are not accessible by this technique. However, this value, in context with similar analysis performed in other materials allows to qualitatively compare the bulk characteristics and point out that recombination at very short timescales could dictate the overall response.

Combining both IMPS and IMVS data, bulk electron behaviour such as diffusion coefficient Dn and diffusion length Ln could be calculated by the following equations:54 (8) (9)where d is the film thickness and is estimated to be 300 nm (Fig. S1†). Based on the value τn and τd that extracted from IMVS and IMPS, Dn and Ln are found to be around 37.5 μm2 s−1 and 318 nm, respectively. These values are consistent with those reported by Andrade et al. for α-Fe2O3 photoanodes55 and Krüger et al. for nanocrystalline TiO2.54 This confirms that the majority carriers transport characteristics are similar to those of other metal oxides. The value of Ln is close to d suggests that the majority carrier diffusion is not limiting the charge collection.
To evaluate the charge transport behaviour of both minority and majority carriers in the film, photocurrent experiments using monochromatic light and in the presence of hole scavenger in solution were performed. As depicted in Fig. 7a, substrate-side (SSI) and electrolyte-side (ESI) monochromatic (452 nm) illumination allows to selectively photogenerate carriers close to the substrate or to the electrolyte interface, given the estimated photon penetration depth of 100 nm in our CuFe2O4 thin film. The ratio of the photocurrent density measured using ESI and SSI is shown in Fig. 7b where a value close to 1 of jESI/jSSI is observed at both cases. This further confirms that the majority carrier transport does not limit the photocurrent, in agreement with Ln. Based on the Gärtner model,56 the minority carrier diffusion length and doping concentration can be estimated with the following equation:57,58 (10)where η is the external quantum efficiency of the sacrificial photo-oxidation under 452 nm illumination, α is the absorption coefficient, Vfb,eff is the effective flat band potential estimated from the Gärtner current (Fig. S6c†)47,56 and Lp is the minority carrier (hole) diffusion length. Based on absorbance measurement in Fig. S3,†α was estimated to be 99800 cm−1. Fig. 7b displays the plot of ln(1 − η) vs. (V − Vfb,eff)1/2 where a linear region is obtained at the band bending development voltage range (Fig. 3a). Based on the linear fit of this region, ND and Lp are estimated to be 4.39 × 1018 cm−3 and 4 nm, respectively. Compared with Mott–Schottky analysis, ND extracted from the Gärtner model results in a higher value that is attributed to more photogenerated charge carriers under monochromatic illumination. The value of Lp, close to α-Fe2O3 photoanodes (2–4 nm),59 points out that the short minority carrier diffusion length could play an important role in the poor photocurrent response. This short Lp is characteristic of iron-based n-type metal oxide semiconductors due to polaron defect states.60 Combining incident photon flux (I0) and α, the absorption profile (I(d)) of CuFe2O4 can be determined with the following equation, plotted in Fig. 7c. I(d) = I0e−αd(11)

Assuming all the charges generated inside the depletion region can be 100% extracted and photogenerated holes within 4 nm outside the depletion region can diffuse into the region, one can expect a maximum photocurrent density of 3.4 mA cm−2 at 1.3 V vs. RHE in the range of W + Lp. Therefore, in a planar electrode, a significant portion (∼93%) of the photogenerated charges cannot be effectively extracted. Additionally, measured photocurrent (Fig. S6a†) is only around 10% of the predicted maximum photocurrent, despite the modest roughness factor of 4, which would be expected to increase the measured photocurrent in the case of a minority carrier transport limitation. This result suggests the presence of severe recombination that is limiting the overall charge extraction, likely, bulk recombination processes in the sub-microsecond timescales that are out of the scope of the techniques employed in this work.
Data extracted from these frequency-resolved electrochemical techniques and monochromatic illumination experiments affords the construction of a semi-quantitative band diagram for the n-type CuFe2O4, highlighting the bulk electrical properties and photoelectrochemical characteristics of this material (Fig. 8). The key physical parameters are labelled in the band diagram and their meaning is explained in the figure caption. Briefly, a Eg of around 1.9 eV is considered, on the basis of the direct optical transition determined in our previous report.17 Under flat band conditions (Fig. 8, left), the Vfb is considered to be around 0.78 V vs. RHE, and the Fermi level is approximately 80 mV below the conduction band, as dictated by ND. Under operation, the intermediate species possess a suitable energetic position to drive water oxidation. Note that although the PEIS measurement revealed these DOS related to the intermediate species to be centred around 1.4 V vs. RHE, they are expected to be more oxidative. More specifically, their actual potential will be given by this value adding the photovoltage generated (splitting of the Fermi levels) at this particular applied bias. Likewise, the rates of charge transfer and recombination evidence rather slow reaction kinetics competing with a relatively fast surface recombination, bringing therefore a scenario where the effective charge transfer is certainly limited. Finally, the small values of W and Lp limit the photoactive part of the film to a few tens of nm, losing therefore most of the absorbed photons.

ECB = conduction band edge, EF = Fermi level, EVB = valence band edge, Eg = band gap, NC = effective density of states in the conduction band, ND = donor density, d = film thickness, W = depletion width, τn = first-order electron lifetime, τd = mean transit time for photogenerated electrons, Dn = electron diffusion coefficient, Ln = majority carrier (electron) diffusion length, Lp = minority carrier (hole) diffusion length, Vfb = flat band potential, EH2O/O2 = water oxidation potential, NSS = total density of surface states, ktran = first order charge transfer rate constant and krec = first order recombination rate constant. 
Overall, CuFe2O4 photoanodes exhibit a series of intrinsic limitations both in the bulk and at the surface that need to be addressed to advance its performance. From an energetic standpoint, the native Vfb value is significantly more positive than those reported for other metal oxides such as α-Fe2O3 (Vfb around 0.4–0.6 V vs. RHE)59 or BiVO4 (Vfb around 0.1–0.2 V vs. RHE).61 This limits the maximum photovoltage generated by this material, and in turn, the performance of a complete device. Approaches directed to engineer the surface with dipole molecules or surface charged overlayers could help to readjust the band edge positions.51 Likewise, the fact that the strong bulk recombination reported previously17 could be directly related to the short Lp, suggests that constructing nanostructured films with feature size in the order of tens of nanometres is necessary to improve charge extraction. The small W together with the short Lp accounts for a very low (below 10%) theoretical charge collection efficiency. However, recombination processes occurring at much shorter timescales that could partially contribute to the overall bulk recombination are beyond the scope of these frequency-domain techniques. Alternative techniques that could interrogate the carrier dynamics in these shorter timescales are necessary to understand this issue, whereas new synthetic routes capable of affording a less defective bulk material must be sought.18 From a kinetic point of view, the very unfavourable situation of a ktran slower than krec must be addressed by passivating the recombination centres either using surface reconstruction approaches47 or electrocatalyst, that could additionally accelerate the rate of charge transfer.46
Conclusions
Solution-processable CuFe2O4 thin film photoanodes were investigated by means of a set of frequency-domain electrochemical techniques (viz. PEIS, IMPS and IMVS) to provide a complete description of bulk and interfacial electrical/photoelectrochemical properties of this material and unveil the parameters limiting their performance for photo-water oxidation reaction. PEIS measurements revealed a significantly positive Vfb (0.78 V vs. RHE) that anticipates a poor photocurrent onset as well as a small W that is responsible for a low charge collection efficiency. More importantly, IMPS demonstrated that the rate of charge transfer is slower than that of other metal oxide photoanodes, which poses a serious bottleneck for efficient solar water oxidation and contributes to the poor photocurrents reported. Data extracted from IMVS brought up a relatively long majority carrier lifetime and majority carrier diffusion length, suggesting that majority carrier transport does not limit the photocurrent. Monochromatic illumination experiments further confirmed a very short hole diffusion length (∼4 nm) that limits the charge collection process. These findings not only demonstrate a reliable route to characterize spinel ferrites photoelectrodes but also can help to guide appropriate surface/bulk treatments for optimizing this type of materials.
