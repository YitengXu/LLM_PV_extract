    , Accepted 1st November 2013First published on 1st November 2013AbstractAmericans have a reputation for being ‘energy hogs’, using more per capita than in most places around the world. We also unnecessarily waste energy through inefficient energy transfer systems that continually leak it into our environment in the form of heat. Most of this waste heat is low-grade, 40 °C to 200 °C, a level that is generally considered economically infeasible for recovering at high efficiency. The rapid development of thermoelectric (TE) materials in the past decade has raised new hopes for the possibility of directly converting some of this waste thermal energy back to electricity through the Seebeck effect. Although the use of nanowires and nanocrystals in TE materials has been recently shown to improve the performance, it remains unclear whether the production of such materials can be made in scalable, reliable, and economical ways. Most of the previous research in this field has been limited to laboratory-scale device fabrication and to measurements performed on single nanowires or thin films of nanocrystals or heterostructures with maximum dimensions of hundreds of micrometers. Usually only milligrams of these nanomaterials can be obtained. Moreover, there are large variations between different batches. In this feature article, we discuss our contribution to solve the scalability challenge in TE nanomaterial production. Through a rational design of compositional-modulated nanowire heterostructures, we can explore new platforms to optimize the TE performance in bulk nanocomposites and to study the beneficial effects at the interfaces, such as energy filtering, modulation doping and phonon scattering.Yue WuProf. Yue Wu joined Purdue University as an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering in August 2009.

Introduction
According to a survey by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the year 2012,1 nearly 58.1% of the total energy generated in the USA (58.1 quads out of 95.1 quads; a quad is a unit of energy equal to 1015 BTU, or 1.055 × 1018 joules) was rejected into the environment. The majority came from power plants, transportation, and manufacturing industries. Most of this waste heat is low-grade, 40 °C to 200 °C, a level that is generally considered economically infeasible for recovering at a high efficiency. In addition, the theoretical Carnot efficiency is quite low from about 5% to 35%. The practical efficiency may range from 2 to 15%. Even with 2% efficiency it may be worthwhile to recover a small fraction of this huge amount of waste energy. Thermoelectric (TE) devices, which can convert thermal energy to electricity, are considered a promising way to reduce energy waste in various areas,2 such as power plants and automobiles.3 At the same time, TE devices can be solid-state coolers by pumping heat from cold to hot. They could therefore be used in many applications, such as laser diode cooling, electronic chip cooling, portable coolers; a combined potential market of billions of dollars is expected.4 Furthermore, compared to traditional heat engines, TE devices use electrons/holes as the “working fluid” so they are more mechanically reliable.4 However, in spite of the rich applications and advantages, the low conversion efficiency and high cost of TE materials restrict their large-scale deployment.5
A dimensionless number, ZT, calculated by S2σT/κ, determines the efficiency of TE materials. S is Seebeck coefficient, σ is electrical conductivity, κ is thermal conductivity and T is the average operating temperature. In principle, to achieve high ZT it requires high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. However, these three intrinsic properties of materials are interrelated and cannot be independently tuned. The Mott equation for the Seebeck coefficient is often used to explain the trade-off between the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity.6 If degenerate semiconductors, such as metals and heavily doped semiconductors, are considered, the Mott equation can be written as (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, q is the electron charge, n(E) and μ(E) are carrier concentration and mobility, respectively. Eqn (1) shows that the Seebeck coefficient increases with the decrease of carrier concentration and mobility, which actually would reduce the differential electrical conductivity, according to σ(E) = qn(E)μ(E).(2)
An easier way to understand the trade-off is by comparing the positions of the average energy of moving electrons and the Fermi level which was well stated by A. Shakouri in his reviews.5,7 The Seebeck coefficient is the energy difference between the average energy of moving electrons and the Fermi level. In semiconductors with low carrier concentration, the Fermi level is in the band gap and far away from the band edge, leading to a high Seebeck coefficient. Doping semiconductors to a higher carrier concentration moves the Fermi level close to or even into the band and causes a symmetrical differential electrical conductivity distribution around the Fermi level, which in turn reduces the Seebeck coefficient. In conclusion, instead of independently increasing either Seebeck coefficient or electrical conductivity, the optimization of S2σ, defined as the power factor, is much more meaningful. An additional dilemma exists between electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity is contributed by both phonons (κl) and electrons (κe).8 The electron contribution is directly related to electrical conductivity by the Wiedemann–Franz law: κe = LσT(3)where L is the Lorenz constant. By applying the Wiedemann–Franz law, the expression of ZT can be rewritten as (4)

Eqn (4) indicates that to achieve high ZT it requires a unique material structure called “phonon–glass electron–crystal”,9 which is quite difficult to realize in traditional materials. Due to the interrelations among the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, the optimum ZT of bulk materials was around one for several decades.10
To resolve the dilemma among the three properties, nanostructured materials have recently been introduced to thermoelectrics and proved to be able to further push the boundaries of maximum ZT. For example, Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattice thin films reach a ZT of 2.4 at room temperature,11 PbSeTe/PbTe quantum dot superlattice thin films have a ZT of 1.6 at 300 K.12 These superlattice thin films are usually fabricated using molecular beam epitaxy that requires delicate facilities and only produces micro-thickness thin films even after a long period of time,13 which can serve quite few specialized applications in thermoelectrics.14 Later on, instead of making quantum well and quantum dot structures, researchers began to make nanostructured bulk materials. For example, AgSbTe2/PbTe bulk pellets embedded with “nanodots” reach a ZT of 1.7 at 700 K.15 BiSbTe nanocomposites made by ball milling and hot press outperformed commercialized BiSbTe modules and have a peak ZT of 1.4 at 373 K.16 Recently, PbTe nanocomposites with SrTe nanoinclusions even reach a ZT of 2.2 at 900 K, which is the best ever reported for bulk TE materials.17
According to the above reports, the significant enhancement of ZT in these nanostructured materials mostly comes from the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity without a significant sacrifice in electrical conductivity. Bulk nanocomposites possess many nano-features inside the body, such as alloying defects, nanoinclusions and grain boundaries; these lattice distortions can effectively interfere with phonon transport and reduce lattice thermal conductivity.18 In fact, phonons have a rather wide mean free path distribution from 1 nm to 1 μm19 and the ideal nanostructured materials should have all-scale hierarchical architecture. In other words, in addition to using defects created by alloying that effectively scatter short mean free path phonons,20 researchers also introduce a second phase, commonly nanosize inclusions, in nanostructured bulk materials in order to scatter the mid and long mean free path phonons and reach extremely small thermal conductivity.17,21 Of course, the lattice distortion could potentially hinder electron transport as well, but the influence is less significant mostly because the sizes of nanograins are larger than the dominating mean free path of electrons.22 Actually, electrons are more likely to be scattered by the band offset between grain boundaries of two different phases. In the two most successful nanostructured materials, the Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattice11 and the PbTe/SrTe nanocomposite,17 the researchers intentionally selected two phases with a nearly zero band offset in order to minimize the interference with electron transport.
However, manipulating the electronic properties of TE materials wisely could potentially enhance the power factor, which in turn could further increase ZT. A few strategies have been proposed to enhance the power factor. For example, quantum confinement effects23 and resonant impurity levels6c,24 can create a local increase in the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level and such sharp features introduce an additional scattering mechanism in the Mott equation (eqn (1)), which can enhance the Seebeck coefficient. However, as for nanostructured bulk materials, energy filtering and modulation doping seem to be more promising. The energy filtering effect introduces energy barriers to block the transport of low-energy electrons so that the average energy of the moving electrons is moved further from the Fermi level, leading to an enhanced Seebeck coefficient.25 The most common way of creating energy barriers is to introduce a second phase to the matrix with a small band offset; this method has been used to demonstrate the energy filtering effect successfully. For example, InGaAs/InGaAsP heterostructures were used to selectively emit hot electrons over the band offset at junctions, leading to evaporative cooling.26 Sb2Te3 with Pt nanoinclusions was shown to possess a slightly enhanced power factor over pure Sb2Te3 because of an increased Seebeck coefficient and only slightly decreased electrical conductivity.27 Bi2Te3 with Bi nanoinclusions enhanced the Seebeck coefficient compared to a pure Bi2Te3 sample at the same carrier concentration, implying the energy filtering effect, and ZT was improved by a factor of 2 with the addition of thermal conductivity reduction.28
Modulation doping is another interesting technique, in which dopants are separated from the matrix so that charge carriers can transport freely without ionized impurity scattering; this leads to a simultaneously high mobility and carrier concentration.29 The advantage of modulation doping in thermoelectrics is electrical conductivity improvement at the same carrier concentration and Seebeck coefficient. In real material design, a heavily doped second phase is usually used to dope the matrix instead of traditional ionized impurity dopants. For example, B (p-type) or P (n-type) doped Si nanoinclusions were embedded in the Si80Ge20 matrix and both cases have an enhanced power factor compared to those of traditionally doped samples, Si80Ge20Bx and Si80Ge20Py.30 Work from the same group on Si70Ge30Px nanoinclusion doped Si95Ge5 also showed an enhanced power factor compared to that of the traditionally doped Si95Ge5Py sample.31 Based on previous research, many factors could play a role in energy filtering and modulation doping, such as the concentration and size of the nanoinclusions as well as the band alignment between two phases.25,30–32 Therefore, it is non-trivial to fabricate nanostructured materials that can fully take advantage of the beneficial effects, e.g. phonon scattering, energy filtering, and modulation doping.
One common way to fabricate nanostructured materials is through a top-down approach where solid-state reactions, such as zone melting33 and the Bridgman method,34 are first used to synthesize materials that are then ball milled into nanopowders.35 For example, several nanostructured TE bulk materials mentioned above were fabricated with this top-down approach, which proves that the top-down approach has been extremely successful in thermoelectrics. However, there are still drawbacks for the top-down approach. For example, such solid-state reactions are usually time consuming and energy intensive (require over 1000 °C for a reasonable reaction rate)36 and ball milling is also time consuming and could potentially give inconsistency in size control as well as introduce many undesirable impurities.37
To overcome the drawbacks mentioned above, we have developed a bottom-up synthetic approach to produce telluride nanowires and nanowire heterostructures that show potential for the enhancement of thermoelectric properties in previous literature.38 We focus our research on tellurides because they have proven to be the best TE materials at various temperature ranges.39 Our method possesses several advantages. First, the synthesis is through solution phase reactions that are more time and energy efficient compared to solid-state reactions and ball milling. For example, the highest reaction temperature in our synthesis is 160 °C and the longest reaction time is 3 hours. The reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure and no over pressure is generated during the entire process. Second, the as-synthesized nanowires and nanowire heterostructures have a more uniform morphology and size distribution compared to ball-milled nanopowder. Third, our synthesis method provides great flexibility for material design. Through tuning reaction conditions and critical reactants, different telluride nanowires and nanowire heterostructures with various telluride components can be successfully synthesized with controllable sizes and compositions, which leaves room for the optimization of material systems for energy filtering, modulation doping and phonon scattering.
What makes the approach even more appealing is the scalability of the solution phase reactions.40 In our process, we have carried out two initial experiments on scaling up the reaction solution volume from 15 ml to 800 ml (approximately 54 times) in an industrial standard 1 liter batch reactor for the synthesis of PbTe and Bi2Te3 nanowires. The reactor is composed of three major parts: a reaction vessel, a heating fluid and a temperature controller. Basically, the reaction solution in the vessel is heated by the heating fluid flowing in the jacket wrapping the vessel and the temperature of the reaction is controlled through the temperature controller. Initial results have shown that the synthesis of PbTe and Bi2Te3 can be successfully scaled up and each batch can produce over 17 grams with yield over 94% calculated from the starting precursors, demonstrating the scalability of our method.41 After the synthesis, the products are washed with water and ethanol and then dilute hydrazine hydrate solution is used to strip off the organic ligands from the nanostructures.42 The nanostructures are then dried into a powder for further processing and characterization.
Ultra-thin Bi2Te3 nanowires
Synthesis and characterization of Bi2Te3 nanowires
The synthesis of Bi2Te3 nanowires involves two major steps: growth of ultra-thin Te nanowires and conversion from Te to Bi2Te3 nanowires. The two-step reaction takes 2 hours in total and the highest reaction temperature is 160 °C. The detailed synthesis procedure is described in our previous work.43 The intermediate (Te nanowires) and final products (Bi2Te3 nanowires) were first characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns of Te and Bi2Te3 nanowires can be indexed to pure Te (JCPDS no. 36-1452) and Bi2Te3 (JCPDS no. 65-3750) phases without impurity peaks identified (Fig. 1). However, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peaks is quite broad, which makes the differentiation between the two patterns difficult. Therefore, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was then used to identify the elemental composition before and after Bi2Te3 conversion and the comparison (Fig. 1) clearly shows that Bi peaks only appear after the conversion. The atomic ratio between Bi and Te in the final product given by the EDS result is 2:3.56, which was also confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to study the morphology evolution during the two-step reaction. The low-magnification TEM images of the intermediate product show the nanowire morphology of Te with a uniform diameter of 5 ± 1 nm (Fig. 2A–C). After the conversion Bi2Te3 retains the nanowire morphology with a narrow distribution and the average diameter increases from 5 nm to 8 nm (Fig. 2D–F). This is much thinner compared to Bi2Te3 nanowires synthesized using triphenylbismuthine and Te nanowires in a previous report.44 Notably, the nanowire surface becomes quite rough after the conversion and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (insets in Fig. 2B and E) show that Bi2Te3 nanowires have multiple crystalline domains, which is different from the single-crystalline nature of Te nanowires. One possible reason could be the unit cell volume expansion by about 5 times during the conversion from Te to Bi2Te3, which generated a large lattice strain and caused the dislocation in Bi2Te3 nanowires.

Te–Bi2Te3 and PbTe–Bi2Te3 nanowire heterostructures
Synthesis and characterization of Te–Bi2Te3 nanowire heterostructures
We designed a synthetic approach to synthesize Bi2Te3 nanowire heterostructures. A few methods can be found in the literature for synthesizing Bi2Te3 nanowire heterostructures, but templates,45 complex surfactants,46 or catalysts47 are needed in the synthesis. Our simple and catalyst-free synthesis involves three steps. The first two steps involve growth of Te nanowires and growth of two Bi2Te3 plates at the two ends of the Te nanowire (Fig. 3A). The detailed procedures can be found in our previous work.48 The critical difference is that anhydrous hydrazine was used in Bi2Te3 nanowire synthesis while hydrazine hydrate solution (80%) was used in Bi2Te3 nanowire heterostructure synthesis. The intermediate product, Te nanowires, and the final product, Te–Bi2Te3 heterostructures, are first characterized with XRD (Fig. 3B). The pattern of Te–Bi2Te3 heterostructures shows Te (JCPDS no. 36-1452) and Bi2Te3 (JCPDS no. 15-0863) phases after Bi precursor injection. TEM images demonstrate the morphology transformation from nanowire to “barbell” heterostructure (Fig. 4A and C) and the uniformity of the nanoparticle sizes. Interestingly, the diameter of the Te nanowire part before (36.62 ± 1.46 nm) and after (36.92 ± 1.86 nm) the growth of Bi2Te3 plates remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the Bi2Te3 grows selectively at the ends. HRTEM images were taken on the wire and plate parts whose lattices can be indexed to Te and Bi2Te3, respectively (Fig. 4B and D). HRTEM images were also taken at the interface of Te and Bi2Te3 to study the growth (Fig. 4E). The resolved lattices show that the growth direction of both the Te and Bi2Te3 is 〈001〉 along which there is a favourable lattice mismatch as low as 1.62%, suggesting epitaxial growth of Bi2Te3. One possible reason for the selective growth of Bi2Te3 plates is that the two ends of the nanowire usually have the highest reactivity.49 However, when anhydrous hydrazine was used instead in Bi2Te3 nanowire growth, the strong reducing environment triggers fast generation of Bi (reduced from Bi(NO3)3) that could potentially quickly cover the whole Te body and override the preferable growth of Bi2Te3, which was observed in a previous paper.43,47

Synthesis and characterization of PbTe–Bi2Te3 nanowire heterostructures
If the previous two-step synthesis is followed by a third step, the Te nanowire center part can be converted to PbTe at only 160 °C. The detailed procedures can be found in our previous work.48b In order to study the effect of composition on the TE properties of PbTe–Bi2Te3 heterostructures, two different compositions, PbTe/Bi2Te3 = 2:1 (Sample 1) and PbTe/Bi2Te3 = 27:1 (Sample 2), were synthesized by tuning critical reactants and precursors. The two samples were first characterized with XRD (Fig. 5D and E). Both spectra can be indexed to PbTe (JCPDS no. 38-1435) and Bi2Te3 (JCPDS no. 15-0863) phases and the intensity of Bi2Te3 peaks becomes stronger as the Bi2Te3 fraction increases. The actual Bi2Te3 molar percentages, identified by EDS, are 33.4% (theoretical value: 33.3%) and 3.38% (theoretical value: 3.57%) for Sample 1 and Sample 2 (Fig. 5F and G) respectively, which proves that the composition control was quite successful.

TEM images confirm that the “barbell” morphology was maintained after the conversion from Te to PbTe (Fig. 6A and C). Also, the Bi2Te3 plates of Sample 1 are significantly larger than those of Sample 2 due to the composition difference between the two samples. Moreover, HRTEM images at the interface (Fig. 6B and D) show that the axial directions of PbTe and Bi2Te3 are perpendicular to (111) and (006) planes. The calculated lattice mismatch is 4.01%, which is small enough to tolerate epitaxial interfaces.

Measurement of thermoelectric properties
While the investigation of the unique properties of our nanowires and nanowire heterostructures at the single nanowire level is in progress, we have mainly focused on the studies of their electrical and thermal properties at the bulk nanocomposite level. The nanowires and nanowire heterostructures are compressed into cylindrical discs and cut into appropriate shapes for measurements. The choice of compression method and conditions affects material properties. In particular, the material's grain size can increase significantly when high temperature and long compression time are applied.50 To preserve small grain size and yet produce materials with high relative density and mechanical strength, spark plasma sintering (SPS) and induction hot pressing are two preferred compression methods. For SPS, material is loaded in a graphite die, compressed uniaxially, and heated by passing large pulsed DC current through the material.51 Induction hot pressing similarly involves a graphite die and uniaxial pressure; however, heat is generated by radio frequency induction coils.52 Both methods can achieve very fast heating rates, allowing consolidation times as short as five minutes, and leading to many TE nanocomposites with excellent properties.17,53 Conventional hot pressing can employ a variety of heating methods, that require longer times for heating and cooling, yet these are also commonly used to create high performance nanocomposite thermoelectric materials.16,54
To evaluate the performance of bulk nanocomposites, the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity must be measured. The Seebeck coefficient is measured by placing the material between a heat source and a heat sink, applying a small temperature gradient, and measuring the open circuit voltage. This measurement can be performed by commercial systems such as the ULVAC RIKO ZEM line of instruments as well as home-built systems.55 For bar-shaped samples, electrical conductivity can be measured by creating four co-linear electrodes, performing current–voltage measurements, and carefully measuring all three dimensions of the central portion of the sample.56 In addition, the electrical conductivity of cylindrical or square disc-shaped samples can also be measured using van der Pauw's method.57 Studies on bulk nanocomposite TE materials can also benefit greatly from estimates of the carrier concentration measured using the Hall effect. This is because conclusions about the influence of phenomena such as energy filtering in nanocomposites should be confirmed by observing an increase in the Seebeck coefficient over that of the corresponding bulk material with the same carrier concentration.58
Thermal conductivity was historically measured using a steady state method, which was inaccurate at high temperatures due to radiation.59 More recently the thermal conductivity of materials has often been measured indirectly by measurements of the thermal diffusivity, specific heat, and density by the laser flash method, differential scanning calorimetry, and dimensions and mass measurements, respectively.60 Comparison of the measured specific heat with that obtained by the Dulong–Petit law can be used to either increase confidence in measurement accuracy, or point out peculiar behaviour in nanocomposites. Additionally, the thermal conductivity of nanocomposites can be measured by the photoacoustic technique and the 3ω technique to ‘cross-check’ results and similarly increase confidence in measurement accuracy.61
Using our studies on the PbTe–Bi2Te3 nanowire heterostructure-based bulk nanocomposite as an example, these nanowire heterostructures were mass-produced and washed with hydrazine hydrate solution (10% by volume) to remove capping ligands and then vacuum-dried into powders. Hot press and sequential 0.5 hour annealing were used to fabricate the pellets whose TE properties were measured. The detailed consolidation procedures can be found in our previous work.48b Digital photos of the two pellets show a slight color variation because of the composition difference (insets, Fig. 7A and B). HRTEM images taken on the both pellets clearly show the nanodomains from both PbTe and Bi2Te3, which indicate that the nanofeatures were preserved during hot press and annealing (Fig. 7A and B).
 Fig. 7  (A and B) Cross-section HRTEM images of the sample PbTe/Bi2Te3 = 2:1 and the sample PbTe/Bi2Te3 = 27:1 pellets, which clearly show nanoscale PbTe and Bi2Te3 crystal domains and preserved grain boundaries inside the nanocomposites.

The TE properties of the PbTe–Bi2Te3 nanocomposites were measured from 310 K to 650 K (Fig. 8). The electrical conductivity of Sample 2 increases from 39 to 113 S cm−1 at 550 K and then decreases to 105 S cm−1, higher than that of Sample 1 which increases from 28 to 90 S cm−1 (Fig. 8A). The difference can be understood with two aspects: (1) Sample 1 has more two-phase interfaces because of its higher Bi2Te3 composition; (2) the relative density of Sample 2 (76.27%) is higher than that of Sample 1 (68.22%) although they were fabricated under the same consolidation conditions. Due to the significant porosity and un-doped feature in both samples, their electrical conductivities are much lower than those of bulk doped n-type Bi2Te3 (980 S cm−1)62 and PbTe (526 S cm−1)63 but still comparable to those of other PbTe-based nanocomposites, such as PbTe/BaTe (150 S cm−1 at 750 K)21a and PbTe/PbSnS2 (140 S cm−1 at 500 K).21b The Seebeck coefficient of both samples (Fig. 8B) is improved compared to the highest Seebeck coefficient of bulk n-type Bi2Te3 (240 μV K−1)62 and PbTe (270 μV K−1).63 This could be due to the energy filtering effect at the interface of PbTe and Bi2Te3 as these two materials have a band offset of 0.2–0.8 eV depending on the orientation of crystal planes.28,64 The most interesting property of our samples is the extremely low thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of Sample 1 ranges between 0.333 and 0.610 W m−1 K−1 that is slightly lower than that of Sample 2 (0.575–0.515 W m−1 K−1) (Fig. 8D), which is significantly lower than the lowest thermal conductivity of bulk n-type Bi2Te3 (1.4 W m−1 K−1)62 and PbTe (1.4 W m−1 K−1)63 and even lower than that of our Bi2Te3 nanowire composite sample (0.92 W m−1 K−1).43 In order to extract the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity and explain the different temperature dependence of the two samples, a numerical fitting was carried out on the thermal conductivity data of both samples. The detailed description of the method can be found in our previous paper.48b The result reveals two important facts: (1) the bipolar contribution to the total thermal conductivity, which usually becomes stronger as temperature increases,8 decides temperature dependence of both samples. The bipolar effect starts to dominate at 350 K for Sample 1 and 550 K for Sample 2 and makes the total thermal conductivity start to increase after these two threshold temperatures; (2) the extracted lattice contributions are 0.27 and 0.32 W m−1 K−1 at the temperature of optimum ZT for Samples 1 and 2, respectively whereas bulk n-type Bi2Te3 and PbTe have much higher lattice contribution of around 0.8 W m−1 K−1.62,63 The extremely low lattice thermal conductivity is due to extensive grain boundaries and two-phase interfaces observed in our nanocomposites. The size difference of the two phases could potentially scatter phonons within a wide range of mean free path (Fig. 7). The peak ZT of Sample 1 is 0.72 at 570 K and the peak ZT of Sample 2 reaches 1.20 at 620 K, which is slightly higher than that of the best n-type bulk PbTe (1.19) at the same temperature.63

Based on the TE property data, enhanced Seebeck coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity are the main reasons for the decent TE performance in our samples. However, the ZT is not significantly enhanced compared to those of bulk materials and there are still many challenges and also opportunities in our nanowire and nanowire heterostructure synthesis and TE performance optimization.
Challenges and opportunities
Our nanocomposites synthesized from solution phase reactions have already achieved extremely low thermal conductivity, but there is still much room for optimization of electrical properties and the power factor. As discussed in the introduction, the most direct way to optimize the power factor is through tuning the carrier concentration by intentional doping.62,63,65 However, unlike doping bulk materials, doping nanomaterials can be quite difficult mainly due to the “self-purification” mechanism: the impurity formation energy in nanomaterials is much higher than in bulk materials and the dopants only need to travel a short distance to reach the nanomaterial surface.66 The most common way to dope nanomaterials is to include impurities in precursor solutions, but it is not always successful and requires much fine-tuning of reaction conditions.67 Recently, we have successfully doped PbTe nanocrystals (12 and 50 nm) with this strategy and the doping indeed has a great influence on the power factor.68 By applying a similar strategy we hope to alter the carrier concentration in the nanowire and nanowire heterostructures in order to optimize the power factor.
In addition to tuning carrier concentration, we can also design and synthesize materials to investigate other interesting effects for power factor improvement, such as energy filtering and modulation doping. Both effects involve two phases in the nanocomposites, which make nanowire heterostructures ideal for such investigation. Instead of worrying about the mixing uniformity of the two-phase mixture, nanowire heterostructures can provide great homogeneity in nanocomposites according to our experience. More importantly, by taking advantage of the flexibility of our material synthesis, optimization of those effects is feasible. Band alignment between two phases is very important in both effects. In energy filtering, the power factor increases first and then decreases with increasing energy barrier height generated by the band offset.25 In modulation doping, the doped phase should have a higher conduction band edge or lower valence band edge for n-type or p-type doping to favor carrier movement to the matrix phase.30–32 Two telluride phases in the heterostructure can be carefully chosen or selectively doped to satisfy the requirements. The relative amounts of the two phases can also play an important role. In energy filtering, the power factor also first increases and then decreases with the concentration of the minority phase.25 As a matter of fact, the energy barrier height and minority phase concentration are not independent in deciding the power factor; the energy barrier height decides the position of the optimum minority phase concentration.25 In modulation doping, the concentration of the doped minority phase decides the carrier concentration that directly relates to power factor optimization.30–32 The composition of our heterostructures can be tuned by adjusting the ratio between precursors as demonstrated in PbTe–Bi2Te3 heterostructures.48b The flexibility of our heterostructures gives us opportunities to systematically study and optimize the energy filtering or modulation doping effects for thermoelectrics. In addition to nanowire heterostructures, metallic nanocrystals acting as nanoinclusions can also be introduced to a single-phase nanowire matrix, which provides another method for energy filtering or modulation doping studies.
Another challenge is to improve the relative density of our composite while minimizing the grain growth. G. Chen and Z. Ren recently reviewed the consolidation methods used in nanostructured bulk materials and the best materials have a relative density of 95–100%,54 which is higher than the relative density of our nanocomposites (70–80%). Investigations of the influence of pressure and temperature during the pressing or sintering on the properties of nanocomposites are of major importance and we expect that optimizing the consolidation conditions will play a significant role in future improvement of TE properties.
Conclusions
Over the past 20 years, thermoelectric research has achieved substantial progress and ZT has been improved from ∼1 to 2.2–2.4 by nanostructuring materials. The major improvement in ZT is attributed to the reduced thermal conductivity from extensive phonon scattering at grain boundaries in nanostructured materials. Further opportunities for ZT enhancement could lie in electron transport manipulation for a higher power factor. Solution-phase synthesis of nanomaterials provides an energy and time-efficient, scalable, and low-cost way to make nanostructured thermoelectric materials. Our preliminary results show that telluride nanowires and nanowire heterostructures can be synthesized in solution, which provides another way to make bulk thermoelectric nanocomposites in addition to the top-down approach. The consolidated pellets from nanowires and nanowire heterostructures possess extremely low thermal conductivities that lead to ZT enhancement. Moreover, nanowires and nanowire heterostructures could provide novel platforms to study energy filtering and modulation doping. Of course, in order to optimize the material systems for electron transport, many challenges still remain to be addressed. More delicate control on materials synthesis and fabrication is expected in our future work.

As an undergraduate student, he did research in solution-phase synthesis of nanostructured materials, and published 13 peer-reviewed papers with 492 citations in well-cited journals, including The Journal of the American Chemical Society and Inorganic Chemistry. His Ph.D. research at Harvard University focused on the gas-phase synthesis of semiconductor nanowires and nanowire heterostructures through chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition, and the self-assembly of nanowires into functional nanoelectronic memory and logic devices. His Ph.D. research led to 10 publications with 3181 citations, including two in Nature, one in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one in The Journal of the American Chemical Society, and four in Nano Letters. At Berkeley, he advanced the science of the nanocrystal-based photovoltaic solar cells, especially those made from non-toxic and abundant materials. He published 4 papers with 483 citations, including one in Nature Materials, two in Nano Letters, and one in Chemistry of Materials. After joining Purdue University, he has published 14 peer-reviewed papers with 103 citations. His research has gained recognition by peers worldwide. Based on his independent work at Purdue, he has had 17 conference presentations (including 5 invited talks), 6 invited talks at industrial companies and federal government research labs, and 13 invited colloquium/seminar presentations at other universities. His publications H-factor is 20 for 40 peer-reviewed publications with 4259 citations.
