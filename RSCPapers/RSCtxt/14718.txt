    , Accepted 19th December 2019First published on 19th December 2019AbstractUnderstanding the photocatalytic–activity–defects relationship of titanium oxynitride nanotubes (TiON-NTs) is important for tailoring their photocatalytic performance. Herein, we fabricated highly ordered and vertically aligned nanotube arrays of TiON-NT-functionalized with iridium nanoparticles denoted as (Ir/TiON-NTs) for solar-driven water splitting. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and variable-energy positron annihilation spectroscopy (VEPAS) were performed to quantify the vacancy-type defects of Ir/TiON-NTs relative to TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs. The results display that the Ir/TiON-NTs exhibit abundant defects such as small nitrogen vacancies, larger size vacancy clusters, and small voids. The obtained photocurrent density of the Ir/TiON-NTs (11.3 mA cm−2) is about 3.97, 5, and 11.89 times higher than that of Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs, respectively. The Mott–Schottky analysis revealed the highest significant negative shift in the band potential and the lowest donor density of Ir/TiON-NTs compared to its counterparts. This result is attributed to the unique structural and compositional merits of Ir/TiON-NTs despite the abundant defects, which delay the charge recombination and improve the photocatalytic activity. The presented study may open new frontiers on engineering the defects of metal oxynitrides with metal-based catalysts for photocatalytic applications.
Introduction
One-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NTs) are among the most promising photocatalysts, due to the great abundance, chemical stability, reactivity, and low toxicity of Ti.1–3 However, the inferior visible light absorption and large bandgap of TiO2 limit its photocatalytic activity.4–9 Various efforts have been devoted for surmounting these limitations that involve doping TiO2 with nonmetal elements (e.g., C, P, F, and S) and noble metal deposition.10–14 To this end, N-doped TiO2 nanotubes (TiON-NTs) have narrower band-gaps, higher stabilities, and better visible light adsorption properties compared to un-doped TiO2.15–18 This result originates from the merging of the p-state of the N-atom with the O2p-states of the TiO2-NTs, which form impurity states over the valence band and upshift the valence band edge of the TiO2-NTs.19 For instance, TiON-NTs exhibit a superior photocurrent density than un-doped TiO2-NTs.17 Analogously, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and visible-light responses of TiON-NTs were significantly higher than those of TiO2.16 Moreover, by N-doping, the photocatalytic performance of TiON could be enhanced through functionalization with metal-based cocatalysts, such as Au, Pt, and Pd, owing to their in-built catalytic activity.20–25 In general, the Schottky junction formed between the TiO2-NTs and metal nanoparticles (NPs) accelerates the charge transfer and retards electron–hole recombination.21,22,26 For instance, Au/TiO2-NTs displayed a 1.6-fold enhancement in the water-splitting efficiency than TiO2-NTs.27 Similarly, Pd/TiO2-NTs improved the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) remarkably compared to TiO2-NTs due to the fast charge transfer between Pd NPs and TiO2-NTs.28 Recently, Ag/TiON-NTs displayed a superior water splitting activity to TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs.29
Unlike other metal-based catalysts, Ir NPs are ubiquitously promising due to their outstanding intrinsic catalytic performance towards water splitting than NPs with other noble metals.30,31 Thus, coupling the unique catalytic merits of Ir NPs with the outstanding physicochemical properties of TiON-NTs can arguably enhance the photocatalytic water splitting performance. This is because Ir NPs can introduce electron scavenger sites inside TiON, which then delay the electron–hole recombination and enrich the charge carrier efficiency.13,32 For instance, the photocatalytic degradation activity of Ir/TiON NPs towards eosin yellow reached 99.6%.32 Despite the significant progress in the synthesis of TiON, its fabrication in the form of nanotubes with and without metal-based catalysts has been rarely reported relative to other nanostructures.18 Moreover, the photocatalytic defects relationship of TiON with and without metal catalysts has not yet been emphasized.33–37 Notably, few studies have highlighted the effect of N-doping on the formation of vacancy-type defects in TiO2 cubic rock salt, nanobelts, and microspheres.36,38,39 Thus, it is critical to understand the relationship between defects and the catalytic performance of Ir/TiON-NTs to maximize its utilization in various photocatalytic applications.
Herein, we have synthesized Ir/TiON-NTs via electrochemical anodization, followed by annealing under ammonia and the impregnation method. Unlike previous reports, the as-synthesized Ir/TiON-NTs are composed of ordered and vertically aligned nanotube arrays ornamented with Ir NPs, which can be directly used as photoanodes. In addition, we employed PALS and VEPAS to quantify the photocatalytic-activity-defect relationship in the Ir/TiON-NTs compared to TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs. Moreover, the photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance of Ir/TiON-NTs is benchmarked relative to Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Titanium foil (0.25 mm thick, purity 99.8%), ethylene glycol (99.8%), potassium hexachloroiridate (K2IrCl6 99.98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Munich, Germany).
Synthesis of TiON-NTs
Initially, TiO2-NTs were synthesized using the electrochemical anodic oxidation method using two electrodes, including a Ti foil as a cathode and platinum foil as an anode, connected to a DC power supply.29 All of the samples were anodized for 120 minutes under 30 V at room temperature in an aqueous solution containing EG (40 mL), NH4F (7 mL), and H2O (3 ml). Finally, the anodized foils were washed using ethanol and annealed under air at 450 °C (2 °C min−1) for 4 h. Then, the resulting TiO2-NTs were annealed under an ammonia flow (200 sccm) at 600 °C (2 °C min−1) for 2 h to obtain TiON-NTs.
Synthesis of Ir/TiON-NTs
Ir/TiON-NTs were prepared via a modified impregnation approach that involves the immersion of the as-fabricated TiON-NTs in 10 mL of EG containing 183 mg of K2IrCl6, followed by heating to 190 °C for 2 h and then drying to room temperature. The final Ir/TiON-NTs products were purified via consecutive washing and gentle sonication (∼1–2 seconds) cycles using isopropanol 3 times, dried at 80 °C for 2 h and kept for further characterizations.
Material characterizations
Scanning electron microscopy ((SEM), Hitachi S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and a transmission electron microscope ((TEM) TecnaiG220, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) were employed to investigate the shape and composition of the as-prepared nanostructures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a (Ultra DLD XPS Kratos, Manchester, UK) spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV) under a UHV environment (ca. 5 × 10−9 Torr). X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded on an X'Pert-Pro MPD diffractometer (PANalytical Co., Netherlands). The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded using a (UV2550, Shimadzu, Japan) spectrophotometer. A PALS system with a time resolution of approximately 180 ps and positron lifetime spectrum >5 × 106 counts was used. The VEPAS was measured at the slow-positron system of Rossendorf (SPONSOR) beamline. Doppler-broadened spectra representing the positron annihilation distribution for each energy were recorded using a single high-purity germanium detector with an energy resolution of 1.09 ± 0.01 keV at 511 keV.
Water-splitting reaction
The photoelectrochemical performances were determined using a conventional three-electrode photo-glass cell on a Gamry electrochemical analyzer (reference 3000, Gamry Co., USA) using a platinum wire (counter electrode) and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference electrode), while the working-electrodes were our prepared photoanodes. An ozone-free xenon lamp ((100 mW cm−2) with an AM 1.5 G filter, Abet Technologies, USA) was used as a light source. The obtained current densities were normalized to the geometric area of the working electrodes, and all potentials were corrected for the IR-drop using the current interrupt method.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the fabrication process of typically as-synthesized Ir/TiON-NTs including the initial electrochemical anodization of Ti foil to form TiO2-NTs, followed by annealing under ammonia to form TiON-NTs, and finally impregnation with an Ir precursor to form Ir/TiON-NTs. Fig. 1a shows the SEM image of TiO2-NTs obtained in a one-dimensional nanotube morphology with an average longitude of 1.3 μm. The nanotubes were highly aligned, compacted, and sand-smoothed without any noticeable cracks, implying their uniformity (Fig. 1b). The average diameter of each inner pore is 70 nm, and the wall thickness is 5 nm (Fig. 1c). Then, the nitridation of the TiO2-NTs was performed via annealing under gaseous ammonia to direct the formation of TiON-NTs (Fig. 1d).

Interestingly, the TiON-NT arrays retained their porous nanotube architecture without any noticeable debris or cracking, which indicates their morphological stability (Fig. 1d).40 Hereafter, Ir/TiON-NTs were formed via the in situ chemical reduction of Ir precursors in the presence of TiON-NTs (Fig. 1e). This drove the formation of uniform and monodispersed sphere-like Ir NPs with an average diameter of about 5 nm uniformly distributed over the exterior hollow voids of TiON-NTs (Fig. 1f).

Fig. 2a shows the high-angular dark field scanning electron microscope HAADF-STEM image of Ir/TiON-NTs, which suggests the formation of porous nanotubes arrays with smooth surfaces. The elemental mapping analysis exhibited the homogenous distribution of Ti, O, N, and Ir in the as-formed Ir/TiON-NTs (Fig. 2b–e). The estimated atomic ratios of Ti/O/N/Ir were about 34.04/61.05/3.9/1.01, respectively, suggesting the formation of Ir/TiON-NTs. The EDX analysis also demonstrated the presence of Ti, O, N, and Ir with atomic ratios similar to those obtained by the elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 2f). Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) showed that the atomic ratios of Ti/Ir were about 33.9/1.1, respectively. We carried out EDX at different sites of the nanotubes (Fig. S1†). Ti, O, and N were all coherently distributed at the surface and the inner and bulk areas of the nanotubes. Notably, the content of the N-dopant decreased at the bulk of the nanotubes relative to that at the surface, while Ir NPs were only centered at the surface of the nanotubes.

Fig. S2† shows the XRD diffraction patterns of the as-synthesized Ir/TiON-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs, which all display the typical facets of the anatase phase with few rutile facets, in line with the (ICSD: 172914).41,42 After annealing under ammonia, the intensities of the diffraction patterns related to the anatase phase decreased significantly along with an increase in the diffraction patterns for the oxynitride cubic phase (ICSD: 426340) and the few diffraction patterns for TiN (ICSD: 236801).35,43 There was also a minor red shift in the diffraction patterns of the TiON-NTs relative to the TiO2-NTs owing to the substitution of some oxygens with nitrogen atoms, which led to a contraction of the TiO2 lattice.41,44 After the functionalization of TiON with Ir NPs, the diffraction patterns of Ir (98-042-6948) were resolved except a slight decrease in the intensities of the anatase and TiON phases. The diffraction peak of TiON at 27° somehow disappeared after functionalization with Ir NPs; this phenomenon is unclear at the current moment. The diffraction patterns of Ir/TiON-NTs lie between the peaks of TiO2-NTs and TiON-NTs, implying that both the O and N atoms are randomly disordered in the anion sites of the TiON-NT structure.45 These results suggest that the nitridation process led to the partial replacement of O with N owing to the anion exchange between O and N that initially occurs at the surface of the TiO2-NTs, and then presumably steadily penetrates into the inner region. These results agree with the EDX results, which confirm the presence of N atoms throughout NTs.
The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p of TiO2-NTs displayed two main peaks assigned to Ti 2p3/2 at 458.1 eV and Ti 2p1/2 at 465.4 eV. Moreover, the spectra of Ti 2p in TiON-NTs and Ir/TiON revealed additional two peaks at 457.2 eV and 463.7 eV, which were assigned to the Ti3+ of the N–Ti–O bonding in the oxynitride phase (Fig. 3a).46,47 This result was evidenced by the red shift of the Ti spectra for TiON-NTs and Ir/TiON-NTs. This originated from the nitrogen vacancies formed via the nitridation, which led to the electron capture by Ti4+ and simultaneously the Ti3+ defects.18,19 Analogously, the O 1s spectra of all the materials possess two peaks at 530.1 eV for the lattice oxygen (Ti–O) and at 532.2 eV for the adsorbed hydroxyl (Ti–OH) (Fig. 3b). The O 1s spectra of TiON-NTs and Ir/TiON-NTs were shifted negatively relative to that of the TiO2-NTs due to the substitution of some O sites with some N-atoms during the annealing under ammonia. The N 1s of the TiON-NTs and Ir/TiON-NTs spectra revealed three peaks at 397.1, 398.6 and 401.2 eV, which were assigned to NTi–O, Ti–O–N, and NOx, respectively (Fig. 3c).18 These results were in line with those of the previous reports on N-doped TiO2 nanostructures.29,40,48 Intriguingly, the N 1s peaks of Ir/TiON slightly red-shifted relative to those of TiON-NTs owing to the electron capture of Ir NPs. The Ir 4f spectra exhibited two peaks attributed to Ir 4f7/2 at 61.7 eV and Ir 4f5/2 at 64.8 eV as well as Ti3+ at 457.5 and 464.1 eV, both of which shifted towards higher binding energies relative to those of pure Ir 4f (Fig. 3d).46 This result is attributed to the electronic interactions of Ir with Ti, O, and N. The surface composition of typically prepared Ir/TiON-NTs shows that the atomic ratios of Ti/O/N/Ir were about 46.05/51.04/2.9/1.1, respectively.

The UV-vis DRS analysis of the as-prepared materials showed the significant effects of nitridation and Ir NPs on the enhancement of the UV-light absorption of Ir/TiON-NTs than that of its counterparts (Fig. S3†). In particular, the UV-vis spectrum of Ir/TiON-NTs significantly red-shifted relative to that TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs.49 This effect is due to the alterations in the electronic structure of TiO2-NTs with Ir NPs and N-dopant, which decreases its bandgap energy and boosts the visible-light responses. This effect was further proven by calculating the bandgap energy of the as-formed materials using the following equation:ανh = A(νh − Eg)1/2where α, ν, h, A, and Eg are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, blank constant, constant, and bandgap energy, respectively. The bandgap of Ir/TiON-NTs (2.41 eV) is inferior to that of TiON-NTs (2.6 eV) and TiO2-NTs (3.15 eV). This demonstrates the enhancement in the visible-light absorption and charge carrier efficiency of Ir/TiON-NTs relative to their referenced materials.29,49
This was further proven by benchmarking the IPCE in 0.1 M KOH under 0.7 VSCE using a two-electrode system, including a Pt wire as a counter electrode and our prepared Ir/TiON-NTs, Ir/TiO2-NTs, and TiON-NTs as working electrodes (Fig. 4a). All of the materials showed a steady increase in the IPCE efficiency between 520 nm and 300 nm (Fig. 4b). Intriguingly, at a lower wavelength, the IPCE efficiency of Ir/TiON-NTs (38.5%) was higher than that of TiO2-NTs (31%), TiON-NTs (5.3%), and Ir/TiO2-NTs (2.1%). This indicates the substantial coupling effects of the N-dopant and Ir NPs on increasing the visible light responses and accelerating the reaction kinetics of Ir/TiON-NTs.50 This is further seen in the superior IPCE efficiency of Ir/TiON-NTs (525 nm) relative to their counterparts at any wavelength (Fig. 4b). This result demonstrates the quick and efficient charge carrier efficiency of Ir/TiON-NTs, attributed to its abundant defects, which delay electron–hole recombination.37,51,52 We also measured IPCE under 0.82 VSCE. The IPCE of Ir/TiON-NTs (42%) is significantly superior to that of TiO2-NTs (27%), TiON-NTs (8%), and Ir/TiO2-NTs (26.2%) (Fig. 4c). This is in addition to the higher IPCE of the Ir/TiON-NTs at lower wavelengths relative to their referenced catalysts (Fig. 4d). The fluctuation in the IPCE efficiencies of the as-made materials is mostly attributed to their different defect contents.

Triggered by the structural and compositional merits of Ir/TiON-NTs, its photoelectrochemical water splitting was benchmarked compared to Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs.18,32 Prior to the measurements, CVs were recorded for 50 cycles in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KOH at 100 mV s−1 between −0.7 and 1 V for removing any impurities from the electrodes. Then, LSVs were recorded on the as-prepared materials in 0.1 M KOH at 10 mV s−1, which displayed the presumable superior photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity of Ir/TiON-NTs than those of Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs (Fig. 5a). The obtained current density of Ir/TiON-NTs is significantly greater than those of Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs under any applied potential, as indicated by the dashed lines in (Fig. 5b). This result reveals the rapid water oxidation kinetics of Ir/TiON-NTs. Intriguingly, the photocurrent density of Ir/TiON-NTs (11.3 mA cm−2) at 0.92 V is about 3.97, 5, and 11.89 times higher than those of Ir/TiO2-NTs (2.84 mA cm−2), TiON-NTs (2.25 mA cm−2) and TiO2-NTs (0.95 mA cm−2), respectively (Fig. 5c). This originates from the unique catalytic merits of Ir NPs and physicochemical properties of TiON.13,38 The obtained photocurrent density of our newly synthesized Ir/TiON-NTs (11.3 mA cm−2) is significantly greater than that of previously reported TiON-NTs (6 mA cm−2), Si/TiO2 nanowires (0.7 mA cm−2), TiON + Co nanowires (0.616 mA cm−2), and TiON nanowires (0.23 mA cm−2) in addition to pure IrO2 (9.0 mA cm−2) and RuO (7.1 mA cm−2) measured under similar reaction conditions.29,39,53,54

The determined onset potential (EOns) of Ir/TiON-NTs (1.48 V) is substantially inferior to that of Ir/TiO2-NTs (0.74 V), TiON-NTs (0.72 V) and TiO2-NTs (0.76 V) (Fig. 5c). This consequently indicates the fast water oxidation kinetics of Ir/TiON-NTs than their counterparts, Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs, and can be plausibly attributed to the great electron attraction ability of N-dopants and Ir NPs, both of which accelerate the water oxidation kinetics at lower potentials.55Fig. 5d displays the Tafel plot of our typically synthesized materials at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. In this sense, the estimated Tafel slope of Ir/TiON-NTs (0.4 V dec−1) is lower than that of Ir/TiO2-NTs (0.42 V dec−1), TiON-NTs (0.55 V dec−1) and TiO2-NTs (0.8 V dec−1) (Fig. 5d). This further indicates the quick water oxidation activity of Ir/TiON-NTs.
LSV measurements were obtained for the typically synthesized materials under dark (Fig. S4†). The results reveal that the obtained photocurrent densities of Ir/TiON-NTs, Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs were slightly lower than their activities under light irradiation.
Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were obtained for the as-made photoanodes (Fig. S5†). Accordingly, Ir/TiON-NTs provided the lowest diffusion transfer resistance in the high-frequency region of the Nyquist plot relative to its referenced photoanodes. This result clearly indicates the favorable diffusion transport kinetics and charge transfer for Ir/TiON-NTs.
Fig. S5† shows the Mott–Schottky analysis performed on the as-synthesized materials at 100 Hz between −1 V and +0.5 V under darkness and light. The results revealed that a significant anodic shift in the flat-band potential along with a decrease in the donor density (Nd) of Ir/TiON-NTs relative to that of Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs (Fig. S5† and Table 1). The same trend was also observed under darkness; however, the Nd under light was slightly higher. This is attributed to the abundant defects in Ir/TiON-NTs, which reduce the near-midgap trap states and facilitate electron transfer, allowing for more electrons to reach the conduction band of the photoanodes.

These results indicate that the combination of Ir NPs and N-dopant enhanced the water oxidation activity of Ir/TiON-NTs significantly. This is because both the N-dopants and Ir NPs can tailor the concentration and the nature of the defects inside Ir/TiON-NTs, resulting in a tunable visible-light absorption and photocatalytic performance towards the water-splitting reaction.13,56Scheme 2a displays the energy level diagram for the as-made materials, which reveal that in Ir/TiON-NTs, Ir and N-dopant inserted additional Ir 5d and N 2p bands over the O 2p valence band of TiO2-NTs, while the N-dopant introduced only an N 2p band in the TiON-NTs. This reduced the bandgap of TiO2 from 315 eV to 2.6 eV in TiON-NTs and to 2.41 eV in Ir/TiON-NTs as well as shifted the optical absorption to the visible light region. Scheme 2b shows the proposed mechanism for the water oxidation on Ir/TiON-NTs. Under light illumination, the electrons move from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) and leave holes behind in the CB. Ir NPs trap O2 molecules and generate peroxide radical anions (O2˙) and hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) that act as oxidative species and subsequently oxidize water under low potentials, and this result is in good agreement with that of previous reports.32,57

Therefore, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy was employed to investigate the size, nature, and concentration of the defects/vacancies inside the as-synthesized materials as a function of air-annealing, ammonia-annealing, and/or Ir NPs. Table 2 shows the positron lifetimes (τ1, τ2, and τ3) as well as the related intensities (I1, I2, and I3), respectively, obtained using PALS. Ubiquitously, a shorter lifetime (τ1) is attributed to the free annihilation of positrons in a defect-free crystal, which were determined to be 179.4, 186.2, and 188.5 ps for TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs, and Ir/TiON-NTs, respectively.58

The longer positron lifetime (τ1) for Ir/TiON-NTS implies that both Ir NPs and N-dopant introduced great amounts of small neutral Ti3+ vacancies into the TiO2 lattice structure, and this is in good agreement with the XPS results. Consequently, the relative intensity (I1) of Ir/TiON-NTs (80.2%) is lower than that of TiON-NTs (81.3%) and TiO2-NTs (84.2%). The longer positron lifetime τ2 values of all the samples were significantly higher than their τ1 values due to the diffusion of positions throughout their lattices until reaching the grain boundaries, which involve myriad boundary-like defects.58 Particularly, the τ2 of Ir/TiON-NTs (301 ps) is greater than that of TiON-NTs (297 ps) and TiO2-NTs (292 ps) (Table 2). This indicates that Ir/TiON-NTs contain some larger size vacancy clusters, resulting from the interactions between the small neutral Ti3+ vacancy associates. This is attributed to the lower electron density in the larger-sized defects than in the small size defects, which lead to a decrease in the annihilation rate and a corresponding increase in the positron lifetime. The I2 of Ir/TiON is also higher than that of TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs. However, these values were significantly lower than the I1 values. The low ratios of I1 to I2 is a clear indication of a reduction in the relative concentration of the bulk defects to the surface defects. This result suggests that the boundary-like defects in Ir/TiON-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs account for a greater proportion relative to the natural monovacancies.
In general, decreasing the concentration of surface defects leads to a substantial increase in the electron–hole separation efficiency and subsequent enhancement in the photocatalytic activity. All the samples displayed the most extended lifetime component (τ3), which is ascribed to the annihilation of orthopositronium atoms formed in their large voids (Table 2). The τ3 of Ir/TiON-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs were estimated to be 12.84, 11.4, and 10.23 ns, respectively. The greater τ3 of Ir/TiON-NTs indicates the formation of fewer voids of nitrogen-vacancy associates on the nanoscale in the crystalline grains of TiO2 due to the N-dopant and Ir NPs. This is further seen in the higher I3 of Ir/TiON-NTs than that of TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs.36,51
VEPAS was also used to gain more insight into the defect states in the typically synthesized materials. Fig. 6 reveals the S and W parameters as a function of positron energy. The S and W parameters describe the proportion of annihilation of positrons with low-momentum and high-momentum electrons, respectively; moreover, both parameters provide information about the size and concentrations of the structural defects, such as cation vacancies. Higher S and lower W parameter values mean a greater defect concentration.
 Fig. 6  Plot of both S and W parameters versus the positron energy and penetration depth of typically prepared NTs relative to the as-received Ti-foil. 
It is obvious that both the S and W parameters depend on the incident positron energy (E) as well as the penetration depth. Both the S and W parameters fluctuate with the increase in the positron energy over different thicknesses.36,42,58–60 Mainly, positrons penetrate deeper into the samples with increasing energy until reaching a plateau at high energies because all of the positrons are annihilated in bulk.36,60 Thus, the S parameter value initially drops slightly while the W parameter value increases slightly in the Ir/TiON-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs at 300–350 nm, followed by a steady increase in S and decrease in W as the positron energy increases. The typically prepared samples show an S parameter around 0.56 and W parameter around 0.05 at shallow positron energies, which are higher and lower than that of as-received Ti-foil, respectively (Fig. 6). This result implies that the positron annihilation occurs at the surface of the samples under low energies as found for the highest S and the lowest W parameters at the first 300 nm.42,59 This result indicates the higher defect concentrations in Ir/TiON-NTs than those in counterparts TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs. Intriguingly enough, the as-synthesized NTs exhibited some vacancy-type defects at the highest positron energy. Fig. 7 shows the plot of the S parameter against the W parameter, which indicates that all the measured data lie on a single line; however, Ir/TiON-NTs displayed the highest concentration of defects, whereas the Ti-foil displayed the lowest defects.

S parameter versus W parameter plot. 
Hence, all the positron results showed that Ir/TiON-NTs possess a higher concertation of defects compared to TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs. This is possibly attributed to Ir NPs and N-dopant, which reduce the density of the valence and core electrons, which increase the lifetime of positrons beside decreasing the positron momentum distribution.58
Based on these results, the superior photocatalytic water-splitting efficiency of Ir/TiO-NTs results from coupling the unique catalytic merits of Ir NPs with the outstanding physicochemical properties of TiON-NTs. Indeed, a porous one-dimensional nanotube morphology with a high surface area provides abundant active catalytic sites for O2 molecules. Both Ir NPs and N-dopant decrease the bandgap energy of TiO2 and maximize the UV-vis light absorption. This effect is in addition to the increase in the concentration of nitrogen vacancies, larger sized vacancy clusters, and small voids of vacancy defects, which retard the electron–hole recombination.58 Moreover, Ir NPs can produce electron scavenger sites over TiON-NTs, which delay the electron–hole recombination during the photo-electrochemical catalytic water-splitting reaction. This effect occurs because the defects form inter-bandgap states beneath the conduction band and provide additional charge carriers, resulting in a significant enhancement in the photoelectronic lifetime.
Conclusion
Ir/TiON-NTs were synthesized using electrochemical anodic oxidation, followed by annealing under ammonia and impregnation approaches. Both Ir and N-dopant reduced the band-gap energy, boosting the UV-vis light adsorption and enhancing the IPCE efficiency of TiO2. Moreover, the water-splitting activity of Ir/TiON-NTs is significantly superior to those of Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs due to the presence of Ir NPs and N-dopant, which enhance the electron–hole separation. Positron VEPAS and PALS revealed the higher nitrogen-vacancy concentrations, larger vacancy clusters, and smaller voids in vacancy defects of Ir/TiON-NTs relative to those of TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs. Thus, the presented study emphasizes the first experimental results on the relationship between defects and photo-electrochemical performance of Ir/TiON-NTs. This study may open new avenues for engineering the defects of metal oxynitrides ornamented with metal-based catalysts for potential photocatalytic applications.
