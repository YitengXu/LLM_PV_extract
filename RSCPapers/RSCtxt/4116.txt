    , Accepted 7th December 2016First published on 7th December 2016AbstractThiophene derivatives, including thieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (TBT), benzo[b]thiophene (BT), 2-phenylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (PTT) and 2-phenylthiophene (PT), have been introduced as donors for the construction of triarylamine organic dyes (M52, M53, M56, M57 and M52A). The absorption, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties as well as the stabilities of these dyes are systematically investigated and compared with the reference dye (M55), whose donor is composed of the hexyloxybenzene (HOB) unit. It is found that introducing the TBT, BT, PTT or PT donors positively shifted the HOMO and LUMO levels of the organic dyes, providing a larger driving force for regeneration and reducing the energy loss for electron injection. In addition, we found that M52, which contains the TBT unit, exhibited better photovoltaic performance and photostability as compared to the reference dye. In contrast, M53 displayed the lowest efficiency and stability of these dyes, indicating that the BT unit is not a good building block for donors. Interestingly, upon the incorporation of the mixed donor (TBT–HOB), M52A achieved a desirable driving force for regeneration without a loss in light absorption, thus resulting in a further improved photovoltaic performance with respect to that of M52. This work demonstrates that introducing donors based on thiophene derivatives is a good strategy for tuning the energy levels and thereby enhancing the efficiency of the resulting devices.
Introduction
Energy conversion and storage are central to the sustainable development of mankind owing to growing global energy demands.1,2 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much interest as a promising renewable energy supply device, owing to their high efficiency, ease of fabrication, and capability for being processed under ambient conditions.3,4 Undoubtedly, the development of more effective sensitizers is the key for further advances in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of DSSCs. The last decade has witnessed a rapid growth in the use of ruthenium(II) dyes,5–7 porphyrin dyes8–12 and metal-free organic dyes.13–53 Notably, metal free organic dyes offer a large diversity in their molecular structures and show high efficiency values.
It is well known that the donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) framework employed by organic dyes facilitates charge transfer from the ground to the excited state, and increases light absorption. To optimize the photophysical properties as well as the photovoltaic performances of these organic dyes, exploring new electron donors, π-bridges and acceptor moieties is necessary. One primary aim of the molecular design of organic dyes is the modification of energy levels. Appropriate energy levels (HOMOs and LUMOs) could reduce the energy loss associated with dye regeneration and electron injection. In addition, energy level control has to take into account the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO, which is closely related to the absorption of the organic dyes. Recently, energy level control has been a hot topic in photosensitizer research. For example, Xie et al. found that the addition of electron-deficient groups, such as benzothiadiazole (BTD) and benzooxadiazole (BOD), lowers both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the corresponding organic dyes, avoiding energy “waste”.36 Wu et al. optimized the LUMO level of the panchromatic sensitizer FNE32 with an identical auxiliary electron acceptor, leading to a significant increase in efficiency by almost 95%.40
With this in mind, we extended our studies by employing thiophene derivatives, i.e. thieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (TBT), benzo[b]thiophene (BT), 2-phenylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (PTT) and 2-phenylthiophene (PT), to construct four new organic dyes, M52, M53, M56 and M57, respectively (Fig. 1). To further assess the characteristics of the thiophene derivatives as electron donors in terms of their photophysical properties and photovoltaic performances, we prepared the counterpart M55 (Fig. 1), which features a dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine electron donor, as a reference dye. Interestingly, introducing the TBT, PTT and PT units as the electron donor species shows two desirable characteristics in comparison to the hexyloxybenzene (HOB) electron donor: (1) a positive shift in the HOMO and LUMO levels of the organic dyes, providing a large driving force for regeneration and reducing the energy loss from electron injection; (2) increasing the stability of dyes. In contrast, BT is inferior to other donors in terms of its efficiency and stability. Furthermore, we also designed and synthesized a novel dye (M52A, Fig. 1) containing a mixed donor (TBT–HOB). In this customized dye, the TBT unit mainly lowers the HOMO and LUMO level, while the HOB unit maintains the donor strength and red shifts the absorption peak. This result indicates that we can control the molecular energy levels of organic dyes by changing the combinations of the mixed donors. Consequently, M52A, which contains mixed donors, achieves a better photovoltaic performance than all of the other dyes. This work demonstrates that introducing donors based on thiophene derivatives is a good strategy for tuning the energy levels of organic dyes, and thereby enhancing the efficiency of the resulting devices.

Experimental
Materials and instruments
The synthetic routes for the M52, M53, M55, M56 and M57 dyes are shown in Scheme 1. Pd2(dba)3, dppf, Pd(PPh3)4, and t-BuONa were purchased from Energy Chemical (China). The synthesis procedures for M52A are provided in the ESI.†N,N-Dimethylformamide was dried over and distilled from CaH2 under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Phosphorus oxychloride was freshly distilled before use. Dichloromethane was distilled from calcium hydride under a nitrogen atmosphere. All other solvents and chemicals used in this work were analytical grade and were used without further purification.
 Scheme 1  Schematic routes for the studied dyes: (a) t-BuONa, Pd2(dba)3, Xphos, toluene, reflux, 8 hours; (b) piperidine, cyanoacetic acid, CHCl3/CH3CN (v/v, 1/2), reflux, 8 hours. 

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-300 or AM-400 spectrometer. The chemical shifts are reported relative to TMS. High resolution mass spectra were obtained using a Micromass GCT-TOF mass spectrometer. The melting points were recorded using a RY-1 thermometer and the temperatures were uncorrected.
General procedure for the synthesis of 3a–e
To a 100 mL two-neck round-bottom flask, 20 mL anhydrous toluene, compound 2 (187 mg, 0.33 mmol), compound 1a–e (0.98 mmol), anhydrous sodium tert-butoxide (188 mg, 1.95 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (45 mg, 0.05 mmol) and XPhos (47 mg, 0.10 mmol) were added. The mixture was refluxed for 8 hours in the dark under argon. After cooling to room temperature, H2O and ethyl acetate were added. The organic layer was separated and dried in Na2SO4. The solvent was evaporated and the remaining crude product was purified by column chromatography to give the desired compounds 3a–e.

Results and discussion
Photophysical properties
The electronic absorption spectra of diluted DCM solutions of these dyes were recorded to evaluate their photophysical properties, and the corresponding properties are summarized in Table 1. As depicted in Fig. 2, the major absorption peaks (λmax) for M52, M53, M56, M57 and M55 are at 511, 523, 506, 492 and 531 nm, respectively. Although the conjunction of TBT is larger than that of BT, M52 exhibits a blue-shifted maximum absorption wavelength as compared to that of M53. This shift indicates that the donor strength of TBT is weaker than that of BT. As the fused ring breaks, the donor strengths of PTT and PT are further reduced. M56 and M57 show a blue-shifted absorption peak compared to that of M52 and M53, respectively. It is valuable to note that the alteration of the electron donor from PT (M57) to PTT (M56) brings forth a red shift of λmax from 492 nm to 506 nm, in contrast to the trend observed for M52 vs. M53. This result indicates that the influence of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene/thiophene on the donor strength is dependant on the connection mode between the thiophene derivatives and the benzene units. On the other hand, we can find that the first absorption peaks of M52 (368 nm) and M56 (370 nm) are red shifted by around 20 nm compared to that of M53 (346 nm) and M57 (345 nm), respectively. Therefore, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene is superior to thiophene in terms of absorption in the region of short wavelengths. With respect to BT, TBT, PT and PTT, the donating capability of HOB is stronger. Thus, M55 displays a red-shift in its absorption band in comparison to M52, M53, M56 and M57. Interestingly, the absorption peak of M52A at long wavelengths is not changed with respect to that of M55, even though one HOB unit in M55 was replaced by TBT. This comparison indicates that the intramolecular electron transition of D–π–A organic dyes is controlled by the strong donor rather than the weak donor.

 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of the sensitizers, measured in DCM. 
Like other organic dyes, these organic dyes exhibit high molar extinction coefficient (ε, over 36 × 103 M−1 cm−1), which is beneficial for the light harvesting capability of the corresponding solar cell device. In addition, the molar extinction coefficients of M52, M52A, M56 and M57 are comparable to that of M55, indicating that the thiophene derivatives contribute to the light absorption of the dyes. Note that M52 displays the highest molar extinction coefficient among these dyes, with a value of 60.5 × 103 M−1 cm−1. In contrast, the molar extinction coefficient of M53 is lower. This suggests that introducing more thiophene units in the organic dyes can enhance their light absorption.
The absorption spectra of the dyes on 3 μm-thick TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 3. The major absorption peaks for the M52, M53, M56, M57, M55 and M52A sensitized electrodes are at 464, 472, 470, 463, 460 and 470 nm, respectively. Compared to their absorption spectra in the DCM solution, the ICT bands for the M52, M53, M56, M57, M55 and M52A sensitized electrodes are blue-shifted by 47, 51, 43, 32, 61 and 57 nm, respectively. This can be attributed to the deprotonation54 rather than the H-aggregation of the dyes. It can be found that the degree of blue shift of the sensitized electrode increases in the order M57 < M56 < M52 < M53 < M52A < M55, in good agreement with the absorption results in solution. Therefore, the degree of blue shift of the sensitized electrode depends on the donor strength of the organic dyes. In other words, the stronger the donor strength, the greater the blue-shift of the sensitized electrode.
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of the sensitizers on 3 μm TiO2 transparent films. 
The electrochemical properties of the dye sensitized TiO2 films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, 0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte (Fig. 4a). The derived energy levels are tabulated in Table 1. The potential was externally calibrated using the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) redox couple, and was then calculated vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, E1/2(Fc+/Fc) = 0.63 V vs. NHE), respectively. The first oxidation potentials of the M52, M53, M56, M57 and M55 sensitized electrodes, which correspond to the removal of an electron from the amine group furthest away from the electron-withdrawing segment, were determined to be 1.07, 1.02, 1.07, 1.06 and 0.89 V (vs. NHE). Notably, compared to M55, the incorporation of thiophene based electron donors in M52, M53, M56 and M57 resulted in a significantly positive shift of the HOMO, indicating that the charge transfer interactions from the amine to the acceptor become difficult. Because of the introduction of a TBT unit as a donor, the HOMO of M52A (0.97 V vs. NHE) is higher than that of M52. Among the dyes that feature thiophene derivative based donors, M53 exhibits a relatively low HOMO level, indicating that the donor strength of BT is stronger than that of TBT, PTT and PT.
 Fig. 4  (a) CV of the sensitized electrodes. (b) HOMOs, LUMOs and energy gaps of the studied dyes, based on the CV measurements. 
As presented in Fig. 4b, the calculated driving forces for the regeneration of M52, M53, M56 and M57 by Co(phen)32+/3+ (0.62 V vs. NHE) are 0.45, 0.40, 0.45 and 0.44 V, respectively. By contrast, M55 possesses a much lower driving force of 0.27 V. In this respect, TBT, BT, PTT and PT are superior to HOB when incorporated as the electron donor. Note that the driving force for the regeneration of M52A (0.35 V) is higher than that of M55 (0.27 V). Nevertheless, the introduction of TBT in M52A does not lead to a loss in its light harvesting capability. In fact, the main absorption peaks of M55 and M52A overlap each other. Importantly, the HOMO and LUMO levels of M52A are at a more reasonable position with respect to M55, in view of the energy level matching. These UV-vis and CV results indicate that the TBT units in M52A mainly lower the HOMO and LUMO levels, while the HOB units maintain the donor strength and thus red shift the absorption peak. Apparently, the TBT–HOB donor is superior to the donor in M55 in view of the modulation of the energy levels. We think this finding is interesting, since the contradiction alleviates between the modulation of energy level and light harvesting.
Photovoltaic device performance with a cobalt-based electrolyte
DSSCs based on the prepared sensitizers (0.5 mM) were fabricated in conjunction with the tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II)/(III) redox couple. No deoxycholic acid (DCA) or other coadsorbates were added to the dye bath during the preparation of the devices, since the DTP spacer in these dyes contributes to the suppression of dye aggregation. To estimate the photocurrent of these devices, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded for each device and the results are shown in the Fig. 5a. Although the maximum IPCE value of M52A was almost the same as that of M52, M52A shows a better performance with a slightly broader IPCE response in the 580–700 nm region. This is in agreement with the experimentally observed absorption difference between M52A and M52. In addition, the IPCE of M52A is better than that of M55, despite the fact that the absorption onset is very similar for both species (Fig. 5b). These comparisons suggest that the mixed donor (TBT–HOB) is superior to the unmixed donor (e.g.TBT–TBT or HOB–HOB) in terms of the photocurrent performance.

It is noteworthy that the maximum IPCE values of M52 are much higher than those of M53. However, the main cause of the attenuation in the IPCE values for M53 was not the light harvesting. As presented in Fig. 5b, we can see that the height of the absorption plateau from 450 to 550 nm for M53 is close to that of M52. Additionally, the absorption of the M53-coated TiO2 films in contact with the Co-phen electrolyte is over 90%. In fact, the dye load amount of M53 is higher than that of M52. Our experiments indicate that the dye load amounts of the TiO2 electrodes based on M52, M53, M55, M56, M57 and M52A are 4.51 × 10−8, 7.43 × 10−8, 4.86 × 10−8, 4.46 × 10−8, 6.67 × 10−8, and 4.32 × 10−8 mol cm−2, respectively. The higher dye load amounts of M53 and M57 can be attributed to their smaller donors. So, the inferior IPCE behavior of M53 is related to the regeneration efficiency and collection efficiency of the devices (see discussion of IMVS). By contrast, the IPCE difference between M56 and M57 was not significant, indicated by the similarity of the photocurrent data for M56 and M57.

Fig. 6 displays representative J–V characteristics of the devices based on the Co-phen electrolyte, with all device parameters summarized in Table 2. The DSSC based on the M53 dye shows the lowest PCE value of 6.31% with a relatively low short circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 12.5 mA cm−2, consistent with the experimental observations of the IPCE values. The TB to TBT alteration substantially increases the JSC to 14.3 mA cm−2. Moreover, the introduction of the TBT unit successfully realized a significant increase in VOC (90 mV). Thus, DSSCs based on M52 achieved a better PCE of 8.33% under AM 1.5G simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2). It should be noted that this efficiency is higher than that of M55 (PCE = 7.61%) under the same conditions, suggesting that thiophene derivatives are promising building blocks for electron donors. Moreover, it is also valuable to note that M52A exhibits an enhanced PCE relative to both M52 and M55, suggesting that the employment of a mixed donor is a rational strategy for the optimization of organic dyes. The PCE of the M52A sensitized DSSC reaches 8.59%, with VOC = 0.855 V, JSC = 15.0 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.67. In contrast to M52 and M53, the PCE gap between M56 (PCE = 7.47%) and M57 (PCE = 7.12%) is small, showing a similarity of the photovoltaic parameters. Nevertheless, PTT is better than PT in terms of the resulting PCE values for M56 and M57.

It is important to note that, regardless of the connection mode between the thiophene derivatives and the benzene units, organic dyes (M52 and M56) with a donor containing the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit are always better than those (M53 and M57) containing the thiophene unit. Therefore, we conclude that thieno[3,2-b]thiophene is a better building block for an electron donor. It should be emphasized here that the PCE value of the M52 cell is higher than that of the M56 cell under the same conditions, suggesting the advantageousness of the fused connection mode in the electron donor.
Although the donor of M53 possesses a fused structure, the VOC (780 mV) of the device is the lowest among these dyes. The short and small structure of BT in M53 could affect the kinetics of charge recombination and thus the resultant photovoltaic performance. To clarify the origin of the observed attenuation of VOC for M53 and to scrutinize the recombination kinetics of the cobalt cells based on these organic dyes, controlled intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements were performed. The differences in the VOC values between these devices depend on two factors: the shift of the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2 and the charge recombination rates of the cobalt cells.

Fig. 7a displays the relationship between the extracted charge density (dn) at open circuit and the VOC values for these cobalt cells. It can be seen that the logarithm of the dn values increases linearly with the VOC for all devices. At a given dn, the differences in VOC between these devices are not significant (within 10 mV). This implies that modification of the electron donor has no obvious influence on the CB edge of TiO2. Therefore, the difference in VOC is closely related to the charge recombination rates of the cobalt cells.
 Fig. 7  (a) Charge density at open circuit as a function of VOC and (b) electron lifetime (τ) as a function of the pseudo-Fermi level (EF,n) for the cobalt cells based on M52, M53, M55, M56, M57 and M52A. 

Fig. 7b shows the relationship between the Fermi-level of TiO2 (EF,n) and the lifetimes of these cobalt cells. DSSCs based on M52 exhibit a longer lifetime at certain EF,n values in comparison to those of DSSCs based on M53. This may originate from the fact that TBT is longer than BT, i.e. the length of the donor affects the lifetime of the devices. For example, the lifetime of M55 is 2.55-fold higher than that of M53, and the former contains two long alkoxy chains at the termini of the dyes. Apart from the length of the donor, the rigidity of the donor is another important factor that influences the lifetime of the cell. This deduction can be confirmed by the fact that the lifetimes of M52A based DSSCs are longer than those of M55 based DSSCs, with one HOB unit of the M55 replaced by a TBT unit in the former. Although PTT in M56 is superior to TBT in terms of its length, the lifetime of M56 based cells is lower than that of M52 based cells. The connection mode between the thiophene derivatives and benzene units could affect the rigidity of the donor, lowering its ability to retard charge recombination. Overall, the lifetime order shown in Fig. 7b is consistent with the difference in the VOC values. We also carried out electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements under dark conditions (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) to understand the kinetics of charge recombination, and the results are consistent with the IMVS measurements.

Long-term stability is a big challenge for DSSCs, and must be addressed before DSSCs can successfully enter into the photovoltaic market for any application. The stability of the photosensitizer is known to be a limiting factor on the performance stability, because the photosensitizer is one of the most important components of this type of device. Here, we investigated the redox-stability and photo-stability of the dye-sensitized electrodes.
Cyclic voltammetry was employed to evaluate the redox-stability of the dye-sensitized electrodes. As depicted in the Fig. 8, all of the sensitized electrodes showed a damping behavior as the scanning times increased. We found that the M53 sensitized electrode showed a rapid attenuation in the oxidation and reduction processes. The M55 sensitized electrode shows a similar behavior, indicating that the dihexyloxy substituted triphenylamine is not stable during the oxidation and reduction processes. In contrast, the M52, M56 and M57 sensitized electrodes are more stable. The attenuation speed of the oxidation and reduction peak is slow. It is also noted that a slow damping behavior is present both in the oxidation and the reduction processes for the M52A sensitized electrode. The voltammograms of M52A still maintained a highly symmetrical and reversible behavior after ten scans, in sharp contrast to that of M55. Clearly, the introduction of the TBT unit in the triarylamine donor increases the stability of the dye. Overall, thiophene derivatives such as TBT, PTT and PT are beneficial to the redox-stability of the dyes when they are used as the electron donor.

Furthermore, absorption spectra were acquired to evaluate the photo-stability of dye-sensitized electrodes. These electrodes were placed outside under sunlight. As depicted in Fig. 9, all of the sensitized electrodes showed a degradation behavior as the time increased. However, the photo-degradation rates of these electrodes are not different. We found that the M53 and M55 sensitized electrodes showed a rapid degradation during the test. Their main absorption peaks have almost disappeared after 4 days of illumination. In contrast, the absorption values of the main absorption peaks of the M52, M55, M56 and M52A sensitized electrodes are over 1.0. The light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) of sensitized electrodes can be calculated based on the intensity of the light absorption (α), LHE = 1–10−α.3 The LHE would be 90% when α is equal to 1.0. Thus, the M52, M55, M56 and M52A sensitized electrodes maintained a good light absorption capability. Overall, the results of the photo-stability test suggest that TBT, PTT and PT are beneficial to the photo-stability of the dyes when they are used as electron donors. Note that the main absorption peaks of all the dyes (Fig. 9) seriously decreased after 4 days of illumination, while that of the M52 based cell remained almost constant after 6 days of sun soaking. Recently, Huang et al. found that TBT derivatives have excellent photo-oxidative stability.55 Therefore, the superior photostability of M52 can be attributed to the existence of two TBT units in the donor part. In addition, we used thermogravimetry (TG) to investigate the thermal properties of the donor units of these dyes (Fig. S3, ESI† and Fig. 4).

A preliminary experiment for stability measurements has been performed using cobalt cells based on M52, M53, M55, M56, M57 and M52A under sunlight soaking. Values for JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE were recorded over a period of 6 days, since the liquid electrode is volatile. As presented in Fig. 10, the JSC, VOC, and PCE values of the M52 based cell remained almost constant after 6 days of sun soaking. In contrast, the JSC and PCE (the PCE remained at 63% of the initial value after test) values of the M53 based cells dropped quickly. The poor photostability of the M53 sensitized electrodes is one cause of this phenomenon. The PCE values of M55 dropped by around 10% during the test. On the other hand, the M56 and M52A based cells exhibited a good stability; the PCE values of M56 and M52A remained at 95% and 93% of the initial value after their tests, respectively. In short, M52, M56 and M52A, which contain the TBT and PTT unit in the donor are more stable than the reference dye, which contains the HOB unit in the donor, when working as a sensitizer in DSSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, five organic sensitizers (M52, M53, M55, M56, M57 and M52A) based on thiophene derivative donors (TBT, BT, PTT and PT) have been designed and synthesized. Compared with M55, the incorporation of the TBT, PTT and PT donor in M52, M56 and M57 positively shifted the HOMO and LUMO levels of the organic dye, providing a large driving force for regeneration and reducing the energy loss associated with electron injection. In addition, the redox and photo stability of the dyes were improved. Photovoltaic measurements revealed that, regardless of the connection mode selected, the benzo[b]thiophene moiety is superior to that of thiophene, i.e.TBT is better than BT, and PTT is better than PT. The M52 dye with double TBT units exhibited a better efficiency and stability than the reference dye, M55, whose donor is composed of double HOB units. In contrast, M53 displays a lower efficiency and stability among these dyes, indicating that the BT unit is not suitable for use as a donor. Specifically, in M52A, the TBT unit mainly lowers the HOMO and LUMO level, while the HOB unit maintains the donor strength and raises the HOMO level. As a consequence, M52A achieves a further improved photovoltaic performance with respect to that of M52. Importantly, M52, M56 and M52A, which contains the TBT and PTT units in the donor, are more stable than the reference dye, which contains HOB units in the donor, when working as a sensitizer in DSSCs. This work demonstrates that the incorporation of thiophene derivative based donors is an effective strategy for tuning the energy levels and enhancing the stabilities of organic dyes.
