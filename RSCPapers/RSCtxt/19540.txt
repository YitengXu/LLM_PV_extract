    , Accepted 26th February 2016First published on 26th February 2016AbstractIn this article, we report a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole based donor–acceptor small molecules, PDPP-OC8, PDPP-EC8, PDPP-EG and PDPP-CNEC8, with different phenyl containing flexible terminal side chains such as alkoxy (–OC8H17), ester ((–CO)OC8H17), ester with glycol ((–CO)(O(C2H4O)3–CH3)) and cyano acrylate with an octyl side chain ((–CN)(CO)OC8H17), respectively, via direct arylation. A comparative analysis has been done on their opto-electronic properties such as absorption, HOMO, LUMO, band gap, thermal properties, packing nature and hole mobility. The physical properties of the four small molecules were studied using absorption spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, cyclic voltammetry, differential scanning calorimetry and charge carrier mobility measurements. In comparison to molecules with alkoxy terminal side chains, those with ester and cyano acrylate terminal side chains exhibit (i) a lowered optical band gap from 1.65 eV (alkoxy) to 1.43 eV (ester) and (ii) a broad absorption covering the solar spectrum from 500 to 800 nm. From the results we are able to conclude that the terminal side chains significantly alter their optical and electronic properties. Density functional theory calculations have been carried out to substantiate the opto-electronic characteristics and further understand the effects of terminal alkyl chains.
1. Introduction
Over the last two decades organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on solution processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems comprised of polymer/fullerene blends have been of much attraction to the research community because of their unique advantages such as low cost, light weight, flexibility and large area device fabrication using various printing methodologies.1 Even though impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 10% in single junction and 11% in tandem devices have been realized in polymer based donor materials, their batch to batch variations in molecular weight, polydisperse nature and purity can lead to variations in their processing properties and device performances.2 In contrast to polymers, small molecular donor materials are highly attractive owing to their monodisperse nature, definite molecular structure, specific molecular weight, excellent purity and less batch to batch variation.3 Inspiring success in their power conversion efficiencies of over 10% in a single layer has been reported based on small molecules as donor materials.4 Among various small molecular organic semiconductors, thiophene flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based materials have received more interest for organic solar cells. Their well conjugated fused aromatic framework favors strong π–π interactions, good absorption in the visible range and their electron deficient lactam groups make DPP a strong acceptor. Combining DPP with a variety of donor materials offers the development of a wide range of push–pull or donor–acceptor (D–A) systems. These systems exhibit a low band gap due to intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and the acceptor.5 In general, such types of D–A systems can be effectively built using traditional cross coupling methodologies like Suzuki, Negishi, Stille, etc. The main drawback of cross coupling is that it needs an organometallic precursor such as organoboron or organotin components which require a multi-step monomer synthesis and expensive purification and release toxic byproducts during coupling. Recently a new technique named direct arylation, an alternate to traditional cross coupling methodologies, has emerged as a convenient tool for synthesizing organic conjugated materials. The advantages of direct arylation are the simplicity of the reactant and the absence of an organometallic precursor which makes it cheap, time effective and environmentally benign.6 Recently Welch and coworkers reported a series of DPP based small molecules with different end groups and demonstrated that α-C–H bonds of thiophene–DPP can be subjected to direct arylation using palladium catalysis.7,8 Thus, a DPP flanked thiophene segment should be the perfect candidate for the study of direct arylation.9 However, in contrast to polymers, small molecule based semiconductors suffer from unsatisfactory film formation and poor morphology because of their inherent crystalline nature which results in low device performance. This can be overcome by elegant molecular design and by controlling side chain engineering.10
Selecting a rigid conjugated backbone helps in enhancing π–π interactions and also favors solid packing. Apart from using side chains for solubility purposes, a recent study reveals that it has an ability to control absorption, emission, HOMO, LUMO, band gap, morphology and molecular packing. On the other hand, there is no appropriate protocol for selecting this flexible side chain.11 Therefore, designing a donor material with the appropriate side chain with an appropriate length and functional group are the key factors for controlling their crystalline nature, solubility, and miscibility and the orientation of small molecules in thin films which in turn control the charge separation and charge transport properties. Herein, we report four different solution processed small molecules as donor materials via direct arylation, with a chromophoric thiophene flanked DPP moiety bonded to a phenyl group containing various flexible terminal side chains. The effect of different functional flexible side chains in the optical property, band gap, packing nature, and HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the four small molecules has been investigated in detail. To gain an in-depth understanding of the opto-electronic profiles of the four small molecules, theoretical calculations have been carried out using Density Functional Theory (DFT).12
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
2,5-Dioctyl-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione was prepared, according to the literature procedure.13 4-Bromophenol, 4-bromobenzaldehyde, octyl cyanoacetate, piperidine, 4-bromobenzoic acid, 1-octanol, potassium carbonate, tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate, triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, N,N-dimethylacetamide, Pd(OAc)2 and pivalic acid were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification.
2.2 Instrumentation

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker NB 400 MHz using CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS, d = 0) as the internal standard. Molecular weights of the small molecules were confirmed using Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker ultraflextreme MALDI-mass spectrometer using a 4-HCCA (α-hydroxycinnamic acid) matrix. Thermal stability was analyzed using a Mettler TOLEDO TGA/SDTA 851e at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of small molecules were obtained using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. Cu Kα wavelength was used for XRD experiments. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed using a DSC Q100 (TA Instruments). DSC curves were recorded at a scanning rate of 10 °C min under a nitrogen flow. Electrochemical analyses were performed using cyclic voltammetry using CH instruments, a CHI 600D electrochemical work station with platinum disc as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and platinum wire as a counter electrode. The experiments were carried out by coating a thin layer of small molecules in a platinum disc electrode and measurements were taken in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded using a Varian Carey 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. For the solid state, spin coating was done on quartz from solution in chloroform with a concentration of 1 mg ml−1.
2.3 Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 ab initio quantum chemical software package.14 The ground state geometries of all of the molecules were optimized in the gas phase using the hybrid Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP)15 along with the 6-31G(d) basis set. The B3LYP functional has been proven to be reliable for its optimum prediction of properties for DPP based systems.16 Frequency calculations were performed at the same level of theory to check for consistency in the optimized geometries. The excited state properties of the systems were calculated using the time dependent-DFT theory (TD-DFT) using the hybrid PBE exchange correlational functional (PBE0)17 in combination with the 6-31G(d) basis set. Single-point TD-DFT calculations for the first 20 singlet–singlet vertical transitions were carried out using the optimized geometries of the systems. The solvent environment was incorporated using the polarizable continuum solvation model (PCM) with chloroform as solvent.18
2.4 Mobility measurements

Device fabrication. 
Hole only devices of the small molecules were fabricated on a patterned ITO coated glass substrate. After patterning, the substrates were thoroughly washed with soap solution. Then the substrates were ultrasonicated in deionised water for 15 minutes. As a final cleaning step, the substrates were boiled in RCA solution for 15 minutes and then ultrasonicated in deionised water for 15 minutes. RCA solution is a mixture of H2O2:NH4OH:H2O in the proportions of 1:1:5. After drying the substrates with a nitrogen gun, PEDOT:PSS was spin coated. PEDOT:PSS solution was prepared by mixing 2 parts water to 1 part PEDOT:PSS followed by filtering the solution with a 0.45 micron filter and then spin coating at 1000 RPM for 60 seconds. Spin coated PEDOT:PSS was annealed at 120 °C for 20 minutes. After letting the substrate cool at room temperature, the active material was spin coated. Active material solution was prepared in chloroform with a concentration of 10 mg ml−1 and the solution was stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 4 hours. Solutions were filtered with a 0.45 micron filter and then spin coated at 1000 rpm for 60 seconds. The gold (Au) electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 10−5 millibar. The initial deposition rate was 0.1 A s−1 and after depositing 15 nm of the electrode, the rate was slowly increased to 1 A s−1 and after 50 nm, the rate was increased to 5 A s−1. The mobility was calculated by fitting the SCLC model to the I–V characteristics from the following equation,  where J is the current density, d is the film thickness of the active layer, μ is the hole mobility, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), V is the voltage applied and Vbi accounts for various barriers in the device. The Vbi can be determined from the transition between the ohmic region and the SCLC region.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The targeted four small molecular structures are displayed in Fig. 1 and their synthetic routes are shown in Scheme 1. All of the molecules were synthesized using direct arylation under ligand free conditions using 3 equiv K2CO3, 33 mol% pivalic acid (PivOH), 5 mol% Pd(OAc)2 and anhydrous dimethylacetamide (DMA) at 110 °C for 16 h to achieve the target small molecules PDPP-EC8, PDPP-EG, PDPP-OC8 and PDPP-CHO in yields of 57%, 61%, 58% and 47%. Coupling or branching defects were observed in MALDI even after purification with column chromatography.19 All four of the small molecules were carefully purified using recrystallisation thrice with ethylacetate. The final molecular structures of the systems were confirmed using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and MALDI-TOF (for spectra see ESI†). The synthesized molecules exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene.

3.2 Geometry
The optimized geometries from the DFT calculations along with the dihedral angles of each molecule are displayed in Fig. 2. It can be noted that the calculated dihedral angles of the molecules vary between 15° to 26° degrees. Also, the systems PDPP-EC8 and PDPP-EG are showing almost similar conformational twists (≈23°) along the backbone. The introduction of the PDPP-CNEC8 unit induces less conformational twist in the order of ≈16° when compared to other systems. This may be due to the limitations induced in the steric twisting by the vinylene double bond. Among the four molecules, PDPP-OC8 shows the largest torsions of about ≈26°. These results exhibit the influence of various side chains on the backbone planarity of the molecule and thereby the effect on the inter-molecular packing and conjugation of the system.

3.3 Optical properties
The ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) absorption spectra for the four small molecules in dilute chloroform solution and spin coated thin film are shown in Fig. 3. Their corresponding optical parameters are listed in Table 1. All the molecules exhibit two distinct absorption bands at shorter and longer wavelength regions attributed to π–π* and internal charge transfer. Such an absorption profile reflects the typical donor–acceptor π-conjugated system.20 Compared to solution, all the molecules exhibit red shifts in both shorter and long wavelength regions in thin film. This is due to strong intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state. The optical band gap in the solid state derived from the onset of absorption spectra decreases in the order of PDPP-OC8 > PDPP-EC8 ≈ PDPP-EG > PDPP-CNEC8, with a decrease in Eg (by ca. 0.1–0.2 eV). It is noteworthy that PDPP-CNEC8, PDPP-EG and PDPP-EC8 exhibit broad absorption covering the solar spectrum in the range of 500 to 800 nm. Specifically ∼120 nm red shift is observed in the onset of absorption (λonset) when replacing the alkoxy side chain with an electron-withdrawing ester substituent side chain, their optical band gap in thin film is reduced from 1.65 to 1.43 eV. The absorption maxima (λmax) also show a red shift in both solution and thin film when replacing alkoxy with ester. This may be due to strong π-intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Particularly electron withdrawing side chain substituted molecules PDPP-EG, PDPP-CNEC8, and PDPP-EC8 show a discernible vibronic shoulder attributed to molecular rigidity and an aggregating nature in the solid state7,21,22 whereas PDPP-OC8 with an alkoxy side chain exhibits narrower absorption and a sharp onset. The TD-DFT results substantiate the experimental results and the absorption profiles of the molecules extend over a broad range from ≈300 to 700 nm. The dominant lower energy band (≈600 to 700 nm) transitions of the systems are the intra-molecular charge transfer absorption peaks which mainly arise from HOMO → LUMO transitions. Each system exhibits another important peak at the high energy band (≈300 to 400 nm) of a π–π* nature with HOMO−2 → LUMO transitions. The simulated absorption spectra of the systems show that changing the terminal end groups from PDPP-OC8 to PDPP-CNEC8 results in bathochromic shift of the absorption maxima from ≈600 to 690 nm. It is important to note that the molecule PDPP-CNEC8 exhibits a maximum red-shifted absorption at about ≈690 nm. Analysing the electron density contours of the small molecular systems is significant in understanding the nature of their transitions. In all the molecules, the HOMOs are delocalized mainly on the central thienyl DPP unit whereas the LUMOs extend from DPP to the phenyl fragment except for PDPP-OC8. This is because of the electron withdrawing nature of the side chain.

3.4 Thermal properties
In order to analyze the thermal transitions of the four donor small molecules, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was performed and the results are depicted in Fig. 4. Their melting and crystallization temperatures are presented in Table 1. The melting temperatures (Tm) of PDPP-EC8, PDPP-EG, PDPP-CNEC8 and PDPP-OC8 are 227, 197, 229 and 236 °C respectively and their corresponding crystallizing temperatures (Tc) are 209, 185, 215 and 225 °C. Among the four molecules, PDPP-OC8 exhibits the highest melting and crystallization temperature which indicates its rigid solid packing. Compared to PDPP-EC8, PDPP-EG exhibits lower melting and crystallization temperatures due to the highly flexible nature of the glycol chain.23PDPP-EC8 exhibits double transitions at 221 and 104 °C probably due to its liquid crystal nature, and these behaviors are not shown for the other three molecules because the nature of the flexible side chain to the conjugated core, which is essential for LC behavior, may be reduced.24 The thermal behavior of small molecules has been further investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. 5 and their corresponding decomposition temperatures were listed in Table 1. All of the small molecules possess good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures greater than 300 °C (5% weight loss) under an N2 atmosphere.

3.5 Electrochemical properties
In order to understand the electronic energy levels of small molecules, cyclic voltammetry has been carried out. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can be estimated from the onset of oxidation and reduction potential which corresponds to the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) of small molecules.
Cyclic voltammograms of the small molecules in thin film are displayed in Fig. 6 and their electrochemical parameters are shown in Table 1. From the oxidation and reduction onset values, the HOMO and LUMO levels can be calculated with respect to the ferrocene standard by the following eqn.25 HOMO = − IP = −(Eox + 4.41) (eV)(1) LUMO = − EA = −(Ered + 4.41) (eV)(2)
 Fig. 6  Cyclic voltammograms for small molecules in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at the rate of 0.1 V s−1, with Ag–AgCl as the reference electrode. 
The electrochemical band gaps calculated from the above equation are in good agreement with the optical band gaps. From Fig. 6 all of the four molecules exhibit an irreversible oxidation and reduction wave and a similar redox process was also observed for other dpp based molecular systems.26 Specifically, the HOMO energy levels of both PDPP-OC8 (−5.31 eV) and PDPP-EC8 (−5.36 eV) are similar, however much variation is noticed in the LUMO energy levels of PDPP-OC8 (−3.62 eV) to PDPP-EC8 (−3.82 eV). This clearly highlights the electron-withdrawing ester effect in PDPP-EC8. This effect significantly lowers the LUMO levels for PDPP-EC8 and PDPP-EG which reduces the band gap. The frontier molecular orbitals of the four systems were calculated using DFT and compared with the experimental CV results. The calculated energy levels of the small molecules are shown in Fig. 7. Although DFT calculations have limitations in the accuracy of the predicted molecular energy levels, the trends in variations of these energy levels can be reliable. The theoretical results show that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are consistent with the experimental results. It can be observed from these energy levels that the HOMO energies range from −4.55 to −5.13 eV while the LUMOs range between −2.35 and −3.19 eV. The energy gaps of the various side chain functionalized small molecules are in the order PDPP-OC8 > PDPP-EG ≈ PDPP-EC8 > PDPP-CNEC8. It is interesting to see that the glycol and the alkoxy functionalized systems show similar energy levels. These results indicate that the system PDPP-CNEC8 maintains the lowest energy gap among the four candidates.

3.6 X-Ray diffraction (XRD)
In order to understand the packing nature of the small molecule thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed in thin film, spin coated from glass substrate. The XRD patterns of the four small molecules are displayed in Fig. 8. All of the four small molecules exhibit first order diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.76 for PDPP-OC8, 2.96 for PDPP-EC8, 3.08 for PDPP-EG and 3.44 for PDPP-CNEC8 corresponding to d-spacing values of 18.33, 29.62, 28.52 and 25.67 Å, respectively which are attributed to interchain ordering. From the figure it is clear that PDPP-OC8 exhibits a second order diffraction peak at 2θ = 9.20 and 13.80 which corresponds to the d values of 9.63 and 6.42 Å attributed to side chain ordering, and the third order diffraction peak at 2θ = 18.50 corresponds to 4.81 Å attributed to intermolecular d spacing.22,27 From the above result, it was clear that PDPP-OC8 exhibits highly ordered organization in the solid state.

3.7 Hole mobility
The hole mobility of the pristine small molecules was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule/Au, and their SCLC curves are shown in Fig. 9. The hole motilities of PDPP-OC8, PDPP-EC8, PDPP-EG and PDPP-CNEC8 were estimated as 1.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 7.17 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.69 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. Compared to PDPP-EC8, PDPP-EG and PDPP-CNEC8, the hole mobility of PDPP-OC8 improved by two orders of magnitude probably due to the electron donating nature of the alkoxy group which was different from the other three (electron withdrawing substitution). The results were also well correlated with the XRD results as discussed above.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully synthesized a series of DPP based small molecules using direct arylation methodologies. The four small molecules were confirmed by NMR and MALDI-TOF MS. A comprehensive study has been performed using absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, XRD and hole mobility in order to analyse how the functional side chain substitution impacted on the HOMO, LUMO, band gap, and the optical and device performance. We find that a simple replacement of the alkoxy group with ester leads to a drastic change in their absorption profile (by ≈0.2 eV and 120 nm red shift on onset) highlighting the effect of the electron withdrawing nature of the terminal position. Of all of the four molecules PDPP-OC8 exhibits the highest carrier mobility, due to highly ordered structure and strong intermolecular interactions which were clearly supported by XRD data. The theoretical calculations provide more insights regarding the nature of the small molecules. The simulated absorption spectra and the charge density plots reveal the effect of the side chains on the optical properties of the molecules. We have also identified a coupling defect occurring in thienyl DPP, conveniently identified by MALDI-mass. Thus a basic understanding on the selectivity of the C–H monomer in direct arylation has yet to be carefully understood and proper optimization of the reaction conditions is an essential tool for assuring the reaction yield and purity.
