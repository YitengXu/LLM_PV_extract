Characteristic tests indicate that the 1D RTiO2 arrays are tetragonal in shape with a square top surface, whereas the branched ATiO2 particles are nanoconic in shape with exposed {001} facets. As a result, the RTiO2@ATiO2 photoanode, sensitized by the N719 dye, harvests a solar energy conversion efficiency of 5.68%, which is nearly 3 times higher than that found in the RTiO2 array-based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), which demonstrates that the RTiO2 nanorods decorated by ATiO2 nanocones are helpful in enhancing the solar energy conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Anatase and rutile are the most important crystal structures of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and have potential applications in artificial photocatalysis and dye- or quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs or QDSSCs).1–3 Usually, anatase exhibits higher photo-catalytic activity than rutile because of the greater number of oxygen vacancies in anatase, whereas rutile has a wider range of photoresponse because of its smaller band gap.4 Therefore, the combination of the two phases induces spatial charge separation and reduces electron–hole recombination, which leads to an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.5 An important application of TiO2 is that it serves as the photoanode material of DSSCs,6 QDSSCs7 and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).8 Recently, some significant efforts have been focused toward improved light harvesting and increased collection efficiency of devices by designing and fabricating novel TiO2 architectures.9–14 In terms of DSSCs, photoanode materials play important roles in loading dye molecules, and collecting and transporting photo-generated electrons, which have been found to strongly influence the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. In 1991, TiO2 nanoparticles were first used as photoanode materials of DSSCs and harvested 7.1–7.9% of the power conversion efficiency (PCE).15 To date, a record of 12.3% PCE for a liquid-electrolyte DSSC was obtained in 2011 by the use of a TiO2 nanocrystalline film.16 Although TiO2 nanoparticles have high specific surfaces for the adsorption of dye molecules, their disordered network with numerous grain boundaries weakens electron mobility and results in slow transport and fast recombination of photo-excited electrons. Research results have demonstrated that the trap–detrap diffusion process of electron transport in porous films is a major limiting factor for achieving a high PCE.17,18 Alternative strategies for the replacement of TiO2 nanoparticles include the use of hierarchical architectures.19–21 TiO2 based nanoparticle branched nanorods exhibit beneficial properties such as enhanced light scattering, enormous high surface areas and fast charge transport; these properties result in an improvement in their PCE and thus make them ideal for DSSCs.22
Herein, we combine the strategies of branched structures and phase junctions to build an ordered TiO2 architecture, which is composed of rutile TiO2 trunks (RTiO2) and anatase TiO2 branches (ATiO2). RTiO2 are grown hydrothermally in vertical arrays on a substrate (fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)) covered by a TiO2 compact layer, which is assembled by the floating-transfer method beforehand, and ATiO2 are deposited on the arrayed RTiO2 through a liquid-phase deposition (LPD) process (as shown in Scheme 1). Ultimately, ordered TiO2 with hierarchical core–shell structures (RTiO2@ATiO2) are constructed with large specific surfaces for harvesting dye molecules and with heterojunctions for improving the electron transfer from ATiO2 to RTiO2.23 The idea is to employ an anatase–rutile heterojunction to combine the functions of ATiO2 for light harvesting and RTiO2 for fast electron transport. In addition, the anatase–rutile heterojunction is beneficial to improve the electron transfer in TiO2, and hence suppress electron recombination at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte.24 As a result, RTiO2@ATiO2 exhibits nearly 3 times higher efficiency than that of the bare RTiO2, which demonstrates its potential use in DSSCs.

Results and discussion
Usually, FTO substrates and sintered TiO2 photoelectrodes are treated with TiCl4 solution for some time and heated repeatedly to form a compact layer before immersing them in dye solutions.25 Undoubtedly, a lot of time and energy are consumed, as well as the initial structures are defiled to a certain degree. Herein, a green and convenient method is employed to prepare the compact layer, which covers the surface of the FTO substrate directly, by a floating-transfer method, as described in the experimental section. The FE-SEM images of the compact layer are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the layer is composed of compact TiO2 nanoparticles and the surface of the layer is mostly smooth, and the thickness of the layer is about 60 nm. This compact layer can efficiently prevent the electrolyte from contacting the FTO substrate directly and improve the collection of electrons in the FTO substrate.26 Moreover, the adhering property between the TiO2 film and the FTO substrate is different due to the presence/absence of the compact layer and the growth habits are changed greatly by the TiO2 compact layer. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the RTiO2 film (Fig. 2a) is integrated with the FTO substrate when the compact layer is present, whereas it comes off easily (Fig. 2b) when it is absent. The cross-sectional views (insertions of Fig. 2) clearly show that the RTiO2 film is contacted with the FTO substrate closely via the compact layer after hydrothermal reactions, whereas a visible gap (red arrow marked) is formed in the absence of the compact layer. As is well known, the TiO2 film and the FTO substrate must maintain good contact to guarantee better transmission of electrons from RTiO2 to the FTO substrate, and it is expected to obtain a higher efficiency of electronic collection. Moreover, different growth habits of RTiO2 can be found in the two types of substrates. As shown in the cross-sectional views of Fig. 2, the distance between the nanorods increases when the FTO substrate is covered by the compact layer, and the average diameter, as determined from the FE-SEM image in Fig. S1,† is about 140 nm for the RTiO2 growing on the compact layer, which is slightly larger than that of the RTiO2 growing on the FTO directly (about 100 nm). Generally, materials grown as RTiO2 on the FTO substrate directly should be perfect because of its appropriate size and density, however, in terms of the application for DSSCs, better electronic transmission and high dye harvesting of the electrode are more important. Moreover, better crystal structures (Fig. S1b†) and larger distances between rods are suitable for the following step to deposit the ATiO2 branches.

Fig. 3 presents typical FE-SEM and TEM images of the RTiO2 samples grown on the FTO substrate, which is covered with a TiO2 compact layer, after hydrothermal reaction 3 times. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, the as-prepared samples have orderly and uniform morphologies in a large scale, and no agglomeration phenomenon can be found. Furthermore, aligned TiO2 rods are grown vertically on the FTO substrate. A cross-sectional view of the RTiO2 samples is shown in Fig. 3b. Clearly, the length of the TiO2 nanorods is found to be more than 6 μm together with the compact layer, and the growth direction of the rods is well vertical to the FTO substrate. Fig. 3c and d indicate that the TiO2 rods are tetragonal in shape with square top facets. From the high-magnification SEM image shown in Fig. 3d, we can observe that the obtained TiO2 nanorods are aggregates of much smaller TiO2 square crystals on the top surface, which can be attributed to the etching of HCl in the reaction system.27 Fig. 3e and f are bottom views of the samples, which are scraped from the FTO substrate. It can be seen from Fig. 3e that the surface between the compact layer and the FTO substrate is rough and several holes can be observed. Fig. 3f clearly shows that these holes are not connected. Moreover, the compact layer is composed of dense nanoparticles, which can efficiently prevent the electrons collected by the FTO substrate recombining with the electrolyte or holes on the valence band.28 The phases and crystal structures of the RTiO2 samples are confirmed by the lattice image of Fig. 3h. The distances between the lattice fringes, 0.324 and 0.229 nm, can be assigned to the (110) and (200) facets of the rutile TiO2 phase, respectively, which suggests that the TiO2 nanorods grew along the [001] axis (Fig. 3g) and the phase of the rods is rutile. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3i) displays the single-crystalline nature of the TiO2 nanorods, which could be indexed to the pure rutile TiO2 phase.

Fig. 4 displays the XRD patterns of the FTO substrate and the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 4b, besides the diffraction peaks of SnO2 (the FTO substrate), all the diffraction peaks that appear upon nanorod growth agree well with the tetragonal rutile phase (P42/mnm; PDF#21-1276, a = b = 0.4493 nm and c = 0.2959 nm). Compared to the powder diffraction pattern, the (002) diffraction peak is significantly enhanced, and some diffraction peaks including (110), (111), and (211) are weak or absent, which indicates that the RTiO2 film is highly oriented with respect to the substrate surface and the RTiO2 nanorods grow in the [001] direction with the growth axis parallel to the substrate surface normal. Weak or absent diffraction peaks that are normally present in polycrystalline or powder samples is a strong indication that the rods are not only aligned but are also single crystalline throughout their length. These conclusions are confirmed by HRTEM and SAED measurements.

To well understand the effect of reaction time on the morphologies of the RTiO2 nanorods and the TiO2 compact layers, we carried out a series of experiments at the same temperature for different times. The SEM images of the as-prepared samples taken from top- and the bottom-views are shown in Fig. 5. When the hydrothermal reaction time was 6 hours (Fig. 5a) and 12 hours (Fig. 5b), the morphologies of the RTiO2 were tetragonal in shape with square top facets, however the surfaces of the samples shown in Fig. 5a are more rough than that shown in Fig. 2b, which indicates that the crystal grown for 12 hours is better. However, when we prolonged the reaction time (e.g. 24 hours and 50 hours), no square top facets could be found in the samples (Fig. 5c and d) and the entire surface of the rods is rough and composed of aggregates of much smaller TiO2 crystals (Fig. 5c2 and d2). It can be found from the bottom-view images of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 5a3,4–d3,4) that the compact layers become smooth gradually with an increase in reaction time, which suggests that the etching of HCl becomes severe during a long reaction time, which is bad for growing high quality films. Therefore, we set 12 hours for 1 reaction cycle to prepare a high quality RTiO2 film, and the length growth of the RTiO2 films growing for different reaction cycles are shown in Fig. S2.†

The vertically arrayed RTiO2 nanorods grown by the hydrothermal steps can serve as the backbone of the branched ATiO2, and conic TiO2 with high quality can be deposited directly on them by the LPD method. Fig. 6a–d present top- and cross-views of the FE-SEM images of the as-prepared RTiO2@ATiO2 architecture fabricated using the hydrothermal reaction combined with the LPD method. Clearly, TiO2 particles are loaded on the surface of tetragonal RTiO2 crystals uniformly to obtain the hierarchical architecture, RTiO2@ATiO2 core–shell structures. Moreover, the morphology of the deposited TiO2 is conic, and the cones have a length size of 40–50 nm, which are assembled orderly on the RTiO2 backbones and look like flowers seen from the top view. Fig. 6e is the TEM image of the RTiO2@ATiO2 architecture, which agrees well with the results of the SEM images in Fig. 6d. Fig. 6f is the HR-TEM image of a single TiO2 nanocone, which shows anatase TiO2 crystalline lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to anatase {101} facets. Particularly notable is the interfacial angle of 68.3° labeled in the corresponding fast-Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 6f1, inset), which is identical to the theoretical value (68.3° ± 3°) for the angle between the {101} and {001} facets,29 and suggests that the as-prepared TiO2 nanocones have exposed {001} facets on both the top and bottom of the nanocones. This orientation is preferred because {001} facets possess superior activity, as described in the previous literature.30 The growth behavior of the conic ATiO2 was discussed in detail in our previous report.30,31 As a conclusion, TiO2 nanocones have exposed {001} facets on both top and bottom of the cones, and the exposed {001} facets are much more reactive than the thermodynamically stable {101} surface, which indicates that excellent performances would be provided by these structures. The XRD patterns (Fig. 4c) confirm that the as-prepared sample has rutile TiO2 (RTiO2) and anatase TiO2 (ATiO2) with good crystallinity, and the SnO2 peaks are caused by the FTO substrate. Moreover, in comparison to the RTiO2 nanorods, the as-prepared RTiO2@ATiO2 architecture exhibits a rough surface. Clearly, this hierarchical structure has larger internal surfaces than that of the arrayed RTiO2 nanorods, and we estimate that it can highly harvest dye molecules for a good DSSC performance.

Fig. 7 shows the J–V characteristics for the DSSCs with the arrayed RTiO2 nanorods and arrayed RTiO2@ATiO2 architecture. The cell parameters of these devices are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that the cell made from the arrayed RTiO2 nanorods exhibits an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.75 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 5.07 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.53 and PCE (η) of 2.02%. This efficiency is much higher than that of the rutile TiO2 NRs reported by Guo.27 It is interesting to note that after loading nanoconic TiO2 on the arrayed RTiO2 rods, the JSC, VOC and FF for the arrayed RTiO2@ATiO2 architecture cell varies significantly and reaches 13.41 mA cm−2, 0.81 V and 0.52, respectively. The PCE reached 5.68% accordingly, which is nearly 3 times higher than that of the arrayed RTiO2 nanorods cells. Fig. S3† shows the J–V curves of the arrayed RTiO2 DSSC (a) and the arrayed RTiO2@ATiO2 DSSC (b) fabricated under the same conditions at different times, which are used to evaluate the efficiency deviation of the cells. The photovoltaic performance data and the average deviation for the DSSCs based on arrayed RTiO2 and arrayed RTiO2@ATiO2 are listed in Table S1.† It can be seen from Table S1† that the efficiency deviation for the RTiO2 cells is 0.09 and 0.21 for the RTiO2@ATiO2 cells, which indicates the good repeatability of the cells.

To evaluate the capability of the photo-anode for harvesting dye molecules, dye desorption tests were carried out and the corresponding results are listed in Table 2. The relationship between the absorbance (A) and concentration (c) of the dye is based on the Lambert–Beer law (eqn (1)), and the obtained adsorptive capacity (Ac) data are calculated using eqn (2): 
A = kcl
(1) 
(2)where k is the molar extinction coefficient, which is 1.41 × 104 dm3 mol−1 cm−1 at 515 nm for the N719 dye, l is the thickness of the cuvette (1 cm) and Ga is the geometric area of the electrode (0.36 cm2). As shown in Table 2, the average dye adsorption is 2.603 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for the RTiO2 electrode, and this reaches 3.861 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for the RTiO2@ATiO2 electrode, which is 1.5 times higher than that of the RTiO2 electrode. Clearly, the TiO2 coating can improve the dye adsorbed greatly on the electrode, which agrees well with the inset shown in Fig. 7. Although the present 1-dimensional nanorod structure could reduce the charge recombination and accelerate the charge transfer rate in the film due to low surface traps,32 the relatively low specific surface area leads to a decrease in the dye adsorption of the TiO2 film, resulting in less photon excited electrons injected to the TiO2 conduction band, and consequently to a lower efficiency. As a preferable strategy, the nanoconic TiO2 coating greatly increases the specific area for high dye harvesting, hence increasing the efficiency of the cell.

To further understand the effect of the RTiO2@ATiO2 architecture on the performance of the cell, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at the open circuit potential (VOC) of the cell with an amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 10−2 Hz to 105 Hz. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist and Bode plots of the two cells in the absence of illumination. It is observed from EIS that the two cells have similar semicircles at the high frequency region (105 to 103 Hz). However, at the low frequency range, the semicircles become smaller for the RTiO2@ATiO2 cell compared with that of the RTiO2 cell. Equivalent circuits, as given in Fig. 8c, are adopted to fit the EIS data. As shown in the equivalent circuit, R1 represents the series ohmic resistance existing in the external circuit, and CEP is constant phase element resulting from the capacitor components in the solar cell. Rct1 represents the charge transfer resistance corresponding to the charge transfer process occurring at the interface between the counter electrode (loaded Pt electrode) and electrolyte containing the redox couple I−/I3−, and Rct2 represents the charge transfer and recombination resistance related to the electron transport process within the semiconductor films and the charge transfer process at the semiconductor (RTiO2 or RTiO2@ATiO2)/dye/electrolyte interfaces. The values of each element fitted by the Z-view software using the equivalent circuit are listed in Table 3. It can be seen from Table 3 that the values of R1, Rct1 and CEP1 are similar for the two cells because they have similar counter electrodes and external circuits, whereas the values of Rct2 and CEP2 are greatly different. The electron lifetime (τe = Rct2 × CEP2) values are calculated to be 21.7 ms and 45.2 ms for RTiO2 and RTiO2@ATiO2, respectively. The electron lifetime (τe) of RTiO2@ATiO2 is evidently increased compared to RTiO2. This result indicates that a suitable TiO2 coating could prolong the electron lifetimes in TiO2 nanowire photoanodes and facilitate the collection of photo-exited electrons by conductive substrates, which might be contributed by the high electron mobility of 1D RTiO2 and large recombination resistance between the interface of RTiO2 and ATiO2, which suppresses electron recombination with the electrolyte and dye molecules and enhances the lifetimes of the photo-excited electrons. Moreover, the RTiO2@ATiO2 electrode has a larger effective surface area than that of the RTiO2 electrode, which improves the dye harvesting efficiency (photos in Fig. 4) and offers more opportunity to inject electrons into the conduction band of ATiO2. Indirectly, the lifetime of the photo-excited electrons can be prolonged and an excellent performance of the cell can be obtained.

Conclusions
In conclusion, an arrayed architecture, the RTiO2@ATiO2 core–shell structure, has been constructed via hydrothermal reaction followed by liquid phase deposition. Ordered ATiO2 cones with a high specific surface help for the efficient harvesting of dye molecules, and arrayed RTiO2 rods with good conductivity help for fast electron transport. Moreover, the anatase–rutile heterojunction at the interface helps the rutile nanorods to efficiently collect photo-injected electrons from the anatase nanocones, thus reducing electron recombination with the electrolyte and dye. The results of solar cell testing show that the addition of an ATiO2 shell to arrayed RTiO2 rods significantly enhances the overall cell efficiency, which reaches 5.68% for the RTiO2@ATiO2 architectured solar cell from 2.02% for arrayed RTiO2 nanorods.
Experimental
Preparation of compact layer
The TiO2 compact layer is prepared by a floating-transfer method, herein. Briefly, a mixture solution of tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OBu)4), anhydrous ethanol and acetylacetone (C5H8O2) (v/v/v = 1:5:1) is dropped into water by a pipette. As a result, a sheet is formed immediately in the water due to the hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate, which floats on the surface of the water. Then, it is lifted by a clean substrate (FTO) carefully and dried in air at 80 °C for 12 hours before being sintered at 450 °C in an oven for 30 minutes to form a TiO2 compact layer covered FTO substrate.
Growth of RTiO2 nanorods
Arrayed RTiO2 nanorods are grown vertically on the TiO2 compact layer by a hydrothermal approach. In a typical synthetic process, a precursor solution containing 30 mL of H2O, 30 mL of HCl (37 wt%) and 2 mL of tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OBu)4) is put into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a total volume of 100 mL. The FTO substrate covered with the TiO2 compact layer is then immersed into the solution vertically. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 150 °C for 12 hours in an electric oven. After the reaction, the as-prepared product was washed with deionized water and further dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 8 hours before being sintered at 450 °C in an oven for 3 hours.
Loading of branched ATiO2 nanocones
The calcined substrate coated with arrayed ATiO2 nanorods was immersed vertically in a freshly prepared LPD solution (50 mL) containing (NH4)2[TiF6] (0.05 mol L−1) and H3BO3 (0.05 mol L−1). The pH value of the LPD solution was adjusted to 2.9 by adding HCl (2 mol L−1) and incubated at 50 °C for 3 hours. After the reaction, the sample was washed with water and dried at room temperature, and then calcined at 450 °C for 3 hours in an oven under air atmosphere. Ultimately, the hierarchical RTiO2@ATiO2 architectures vertically covering the conductive glass were obtained.
Solar cell device fabrication
Dye sensitization was performed by immersing RTiO2@ATiO2 films (or RTiO2 films) in 0.3 mmol L−1 N719 ruthenium dye (Dyesol, Australia) in ethanol solution for 18 hours at room temperature in a sealed beaker. Afterwards, the sensitized films were washed with anhydrous alcohol, and then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 2 hours. To evaluate their photovoltaic performances, solar cells were assembled in a typical sandwich-type cell by placing a platinum-coated conducting glass on the dye-sensitized electrode separated by a 65 μm polymer spacer (Surlyn1702). Platinized counter electrodes were fabricated by electrochemical-deposition in H2PtCl6 solution (5.0 mmol L−1 in water) onto the FTO glass. An electrolyte was made with 0.3 mol L−1 LiI, 0.05 mol L−1 I2, 0.6 mol L−1 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 mol L−1 tert-butylpyridine in dry acetonitrile. The electrolyte was introduced from a hole made on the counter electrode into the space between the sandwiched cells.
Measurement and characterization
The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded using an electrochemical system (CorrTest, CS350) under one sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (BJPLSS, PL-X500D). A 500 W xenon lamp served as the light source and its incident light intensity was calibrated with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell to approximately AM 1.5 G one sun light intensity before each measurement. The active area of the photoanode was 0.36 cm2.
The morphologies of the samples were examined via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; ZEISS Ultra, Germany) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100HR, Japan). Crystallographic information for the sample was obtained with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8 Advance, Germany).
