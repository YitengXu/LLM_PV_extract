    , Accepted 9th November 2016First published on 10th November 2016AbstractAmong the multifarious kinds of small molecular photovoltaic materials, squaraines are quite attractive due to their facile and low-cost synthesis, intense and broad absorption in Vis-NIR spectral regions with very high molar extinction coefficients. Nevertheless, one key factor limiting the performance of squaraine-based organic solar cells (OSCs) is their low fill factor (FF), which is ascribed to the low hole mobility of the active layer. Here, we successfully reported a large π-extended bis(squaraine) electron donor, namely D-BDT-SQ, that showed one order of magnitude enhanced hole mobility in the donor–acceptor composite film, up to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.41% with a high FF of 0.60 was achieved for solution-processed bulk heterojunction OSCs when the working temperature of devices was 80 °C, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the record PCE among those reported for squaraine-based single-junction OSCs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages including low cost, light weight, flexibility and large-area fabrication.1,2 Thanks to the great research efforts, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.7% has been achieved in polymer-based single-junction OSCs.3 In comparison with their polymeric counterparts, small molecular (SM) photovoltaic materials should be more promising because of their well-defined molecular structure, accurate molecular weight, and high purity without batch-to-batch variation as well as facile molecular modulations.4,5 Yet currently, the development of SM donor materials has lagged behind that of polymeric ones, and the record PCE of SM-based OSCs was just 10.1%.6 Hence chemists need to show more enthusiasm for the development of high-performance SM photovoltaic donor materials.
Recently, squaraines have received more and more attention as electron donor materials for organic photovoltaic applications,7–10 such as tandem solar cells,11,12 inverted solar cells,13,14 and ternary solar cells,15–18 due to the following two highly important reasons: (1) squaraines possess intense and broad absorption in Vis-NIR spectral regions with high molar extinction coefficients of about 105 M−1 cm−1, leading to a large short-circuit current density (Jsc); (2) their facile and low-cost synthesis are desirable for commercial application.19,20 However, in most cases, the PCEs of squaraine-based solution-processed BHJ-OSCs are limited to ∼5%, which is ascribed to their low fill factor (FF) arising from their rather low hole mobility (μh) in the donor–acceptor (D–A) composite active layers (typical μh: 10−6 to 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).21–28 Therefore, it remains a great challenge to design squaraines showing high hole mobility in the active layer together with a low bandgap and a deep HOMO energy level, so that high FF and PCE could be achieved.
Here, we report our findings that D-BDT-SQ (Scheme 1), a novel bis(squaraine) derivative bearing a planar geometric structure and a large π-extended conjugation system, could display not only a much enhanced μh of up to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in BHJ-OSCs, but also a low optical bandgap of 1.36 eV and a relatively low HOMO energy level of −5.15 eV. Based on our previous work,26S-SQ (Scheme 1) showing relatively high photovoltaic performance and good geometric planarity was employed as the A subunit, while benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDT),29 the well-known planar building block in high-performance polymer photovoltaic materials, was used as the D subunit to construct the A–D–A-structured bis(squaraine) derivative D-BDT-SQ. To gain insight into the structure–property relationship, a reference BDT-modified squaraine BDT-SQ (Scheme 1) was also prepared. Solution-processed BHJ-OSCs with the D-BDT-SQ/PC71BM (1:7, wt%) as the active layer could display an impressive PCE of as high as 7.41% at 80 °C, which was much higher than that of S-SQ- and BDT-SQ-based devices (5.52% and 5.75%, respectively). The much higher photovoltaic performance of D-BDT-SQ than that of S-SQ and BDT-SQ could be mainly attributed to the much higher μh of the D-BDT-SQ-based device, leading to an excellent FF of 0.60. Note that this is the first report of squaraine-based single-junction OSCs whose PCE exceeds 7%.

2.1 Instruments and characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL 400 (400 MHz) spectrometer. The high resolution mass spectrum (HR-MS) was obtained from a Shimadzu LCMS-IT-TOF. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a SEIKO EXSTAR 6000 TG/DTA 6200 unit under a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The purity of the objective squaraines was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, EZChrom Elite, Hitachi, equipped with DAD and RI detectors). The ground-state geometries and electronic structures of the objective squaraines were calculated with Gaussian 09 software, using density functional theory (DFT) based on B3LYP/6-31G(d) and B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) levels. The absorption spectra of both solution and thin-film samples of the objective squaraines were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer. The solution samples were prepared in chloroform solution at a concentration of 3.0 × 10−6 mol L−1, while the film samples were obtained by spin-coating from chloroform solution (5 mg mL−1, 1400 rpm) on quartz substrates. The morphologies of the active layers were analyzed through atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode under ambient conditions using a Bruker instrument.
Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out in 2.5 × 10−4 mol L−1 anhydrous dichloromethane (DCM) with 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4, as the supporting electrolyte) under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a PC controlled LK 2006A electrochemical workstation. The CV system was constructed using a Pt disk as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. Ferrocene was used as an internal standard. The electrochemical potential was internally calibrated against the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+), which has a known reduction potential of −4.80 eV relative to the vacuum level. The HOMOs of the objective compounds are calculated according to the following equation:HOMO = −[Eonsetox + 4.8]where Eonsetox is the onset oxidation potential vs. Fe/Fe+.
2.2 Device preparation and characterization
Electron acceptor PC71BM was purchased from Solarmer Energy, Inc. and used as received. Small molecular bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated using indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass as the substrate. The sheet resistance of ITO is 10 Ω sq−1. Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min each. The cleaned substrates were dried in an oven at 65 °C for 12 h before use. The substrates were treated by UV-ozone for 20 min, and then immediately transferred into a high vacuum chamber for deposition of 8 nm MoO3 at a pressure of less than 1 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 0.20 Å s−1. Subsequently, photoactive layers (thickness: 70 nm, 3000 rpm/45 s) were fabricated by spin-coating a blend of squaraines and PC71BM in chloroform with a total concentration of 30 mg mL−1 in a N2-filled glovebox at 40 °C. Finally, the substrates were transferred back to the high-vacuum chamber, where BCP (4 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited as the top electrode at pressures of less than 6 × 10−5 Pa with a rate of 0.20 Å s−1 and 2 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 1.5–4.0 Å s−1, respectively, resulting in a final OSC with the structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/SM:PC71BM/BCP (4 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active area of OSC cell is 9 mm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) characterizations of organic solar cells were performed on a CEP-2000 integrated system manufactured by Bunkoukeiki Co. The integration of EQE data over an AM 1.5G solar spectrum yielded calculated Jsc values with an experimental variation of less than 5% relative to the Jsc measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G light illumination.
Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/SM (70 nm) or SM:PC71BM (70 nm)/MoO3 (8 nm)/Al (100 nm) and ITO/ZnO (20 nm)/SM (70 nm) or SM:PC71BM (70 nm)/BCP (4 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively. Mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using space charge limited current (SCLC),30 and the J–V curves of the devices were plotted as J0.5versus V using eqn (1): (1)where J is the current density, L is the film thickness of the active layer, μh is the hole mobility, μe is the electron mobility, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), and V (=Vappl − Vbi) is the internal voltage in the device, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the relative work function difference of the two electrodes.

The solid was recrystallized from a 10:1 volume ratio of dichloromethane and hexane mixture to afford a black solid (0.54 g, 75%), mp 303–304 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 12.41 (s, 4H, –OH), 7.84 (s, 2H, ArH), 7.71 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz, ArH), 7.66 (d, 2H, J = 1.6 Hz, ArH), 7.39 (t, 4H, J = 4.0 Hz, ArH), 7.18 (t, 4H, J = 6.0 Hz, ArH), 7.09 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz, ArH), 6.99 (d, 2H, J = 3.2 Hz, ArH), 6.97 (t, 2H, J = 7.6 Hz, ArH), 6.34 (s, 4H, ArH), 5.91 (s, 2H, CH–), 4.70 (t, 2H, J = 8.0, 2.8 Hz, –NCH–), 4.08 (t, 4H, J = 7.2 Hz, –NCH2–), 3.92 (t, 2H, J = 7.6 Hz, –CH–), 2.94 (d, 4H, J = 6.8 Hz, –CH2–), 2.11–1.90 (m, 10H, –CH2–), 1.85–1.64 (m, 20H, –CH2–, –CH3), 1.53–1.36 (m, 20H, –CH2–), 1.03–0.93 (m, 18H, –CH3); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 172.5, 171.1, 169.4, 163.1, 153.0, 146.2, 143.9, 143.8, 143.3, 141.8, 138.9, 137.6, 137.0, 136.8, 131.6, 127.9, 127.4, 126.7, 125.6, 124.9, 123.7, 122.6, 120.3, 119.1, 113.8, 110.7, 105.0, 96.7, 88.0, 68.7, 50.1, 45.5, 44.2, 41.5, 34.6, 34.3, 33.7, 32.5, 29.4, 28.9, 26.8, 25.8, 24.3, 23.1, 20.3, 14.2, 13.8, 11.0; purity: 100% (HPLC, eluent:THF/H2O = 83:17); HR-MS (ESI): m/z [M + 2H]+ calcd for C106H112N4O8S4, 1697.7397; found, 1697.7400; elemental anal. calcd for C106H110N4O8S4: C 75.05, H 6.54, N 3.30, S 7.56; found, C 75.08, H 6.84, N 3.25, S 7.50.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ are illustrated in Scheme 2. The two new objective compounds were synthesized by Stille coupling, hydrolysis and condensation reactions. Their molecular structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Both BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ exhibited good solubility (>12 mg mL−1) in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, etc. In addition, both BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ could form high-quality films through a spin-coating procedure, indicating that they are very suitable for solution-processed OSCs.32 As shown in Fig. 1, in comparison with S-SQ, both BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ displayed 50 °C higher decomposition temperature, suggesting that the incorporation of BDT core with squaraine scaffolds should be beneficial to the thermal stability of the resulting compounds.

3.2 Optical properties
The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the three squaraines in chloroform (3.0 × 10−6 mol L−1) and thin solid film states are shown in Fig. 2, and the data are summarized in Table 1. In dilute solution, in comparison with S-SQ, BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ exhibited a 34 nm and 47 nm red-shifted absorption maximum, respectively, indicative of their more extended π-conjugation systems endowed by the BDT-modification. This deduction was further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, since in both BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ, their dihedral angles between the BDT core and indolenine moieties were calculated to be as small as ∼25° (Fig. 3). With the aid of the planar conformation of the S-SQ segment, both BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ were calculated to show quite planar geometries. It is noteworthy that D-BDT-SQ displayed a very high molar extinction coefficient of ∼4.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1, nearly twice as high as that of S-SQ and BDT-SQ (∼2.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1). In comparison with their dilute solution samples, BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ both showed much bathochromic-shifted (∼40 nm) and broadened absorption spectra over the range from 550 to 850 nm in thin film state. It should be pointed out that the newly emerged absorption bands in both BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ at 300–450 nm, which may trigger more efficient light harvesting, should arise from the π–π* transition of BDT unit. The optical bandgaps of BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ were calculated to be 1.39 and 1.36 eV, respectively, which is 0.02 eV and 0.05 eV lower than that of S-SQ. To our knowledge, this is one of the lowest bandgaps of squaraine photovoltaic materials.7,33

3.3 Electrochemical properties
From cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, the HOMO energy levels of BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ were estimated to be −5.16 and −5.15 eV, respectively (Table 2, Fig. 4), which were highly consistent with the DFT calculation results (−5.17 and −5.14 eV, respectively, Fig. 5), validating the reliability of our computation results. The HOMO energy levels of the new squaraines matched well with those of PC71BM.34 It is quite interesting that in addition to the narrower bandgap, the BDT-modification on S-SQ could also result in an ∼0.05 eV lower HOMO energy level than that of S-SQ (HOMO = −5.10 eV).26 As a consequence, higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) may be realized if S-SQ was replaced by BDT-SQ or D-BDT-SQ as the donor material in OSCs.34 Moreover, deduced from the HOMO energy levels and the corresponding optical bandgaps, the LUMO energy levels of BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ were calculated to be −3.77 and −3.79 eV, respectively, which were 0.20 and 0.22 eV lower than that of S-SQ (LUMO = −3.57 eV),26 hence yielding lower bandgaps.

3.4 Hole mobility
The hole transporting properties of the three squaraines were evaluated by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S1†).30 In comparison with the μh of the neat S-SQ film (0.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), that of the BDT-SQ film is 60% higher (1.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1); but that of the D-BDT-SQ film is as high as 2.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 260% higher than that of the S-SQ. The highest μh of the D-BDT-SQ-based sample could be rationally attributed to its largest π-conjugation system among all three compounds.
3.5 Organic solar cells
To demonstrate the potential application of the three squaraines in OSCs, BHJ devices with a conventional structure of ITO/MoO3/SM:PC71BM/BCP/Al were fabricated, in which squaraine and PC71BM acted as the electron donor (D) and acceptor (A), respectively. The optimized D/A ratio should be 1:7, yet with variation of the D/A ratio from 1:3 to 1:9, the changes on the PCEs of the corresponding devices were quite small (5.06–5.56%, Table S1, Fig. S2 and S3†), implying that the performance of D-BDT-SQ-based OSCs was not sensitive to the D/A ratio, which should be considered as a valuable merit for practical applications. It is noted that the PCE of the D-BDT-SQ-based OSC could reach as high as 5.75% under such a low composition of 15 wt%, validating the excellent molar extinction coefficient of the squaraines.
To gain insight into the structure–property relationship, two reference devices with S-SQ or BDT-SQ as the donor were also fabricated at a D/A ratio of 1:7 (Table 3, Fig. 6). In comparison with the S-SQ device, the BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ ones exhibited 0.05–0.06 V higher Voc, which coincided well with their HOMO energy levels. However, the two reference devices showed nearly identical Jsc and FF; while the D-BDT-SQ-based device showed a significantly enhanced Jsc and FF relative to the two reference devices. Hence the slightly higher PCE of the BDT-SQ than that of the S-SQ device (4.11% vs. 3.82%) should merely stem from its higher Voc, but the high PCE of 5.75% of the D-BDT-SQ-based device is attributed to its simultaneously enhanced Jsc, FF and Voc. In principle, Jsc correlates highly with the light harvesting capability, carrier mobility, and morphology of the active layer.35–38 To elucidate the origin of the enhanced Jsc in the D-BDT-SQ-based device, we investigated the EQE curves of the three as-prepared devices. As shown in Fig. 6(d), in comparison with the S-SQ-based device, the other two devices based on the BDT-modified squaraines showed higher EQE values in the region of 300–600 nm, which is partially attributed to their additional absorption in 300–450 nm endowed by the BDT segment, as their absorption of blend films shown in Fig. 7. Yet in the region of 600–850 nm, the EQE values of BDT-SQ-based and D-BDT-SQ-based devices were much lower and higher than those of the S-SQ-based device, respectively. Since BDT-SQ and D-BDT-SQ displayed quite similar absorption characters in the wavelength range of 600–750 nm, the much higher EQEs of the D-BDT-SQ device than that of the BDT-SQ device should stem from the better charge carrier mobility and/or morphology of its active layer. Further atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization results revealed that the D-BDT-SQ/PC71BM and S-SQ/PC71BM blend films showed quite similar morphologies with a relatively ideal phase separation extent in photovoltaic devices (RMS = ∼1.50 nm, Fig. 8). In the case of the BDT-SQ/PC71BM composite film, it displayed a much smoother surface (RMS = 0.66 nm), indicative of the formation of inferior interpenetrating networks within the BDT-SQ-based device (Fig. 8). While according to the μh and μe (electron mobility) data of the active layers (Table 3), the S-SQ/PC71BM and BDT-SQ/PC71BM composite films possessed quite comparable μh (∼2.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (∼1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Taking into consideration that in the neat-film state, BDT-SQ displayed a 60% higher μh than S-SQ, the nearly identical μh of their D/A blended films should arise from the unfavorable morphology of the BDT-SQ/PC71BM film sample. In contrast, the μh and μe of the D-BDT-SQ/PC71BM composite film are 1.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and both are significantly higher than those of the S-SQ/PC71BM and BDT-SQ/PC71BM samples. Consequently, the higher μh and μe of its active layer should be the main reason accounting for the higher EQE values of the BDT-SQ-based device than the two reference devices in the wavelength range of 300–850 nm, but the lower bandgap of D-BDT-SQ together with its intensified absorption in the region of 300–450 nm should also contribute effectively to the high Jsc of the D-BDT-SQ-based device, as evidenced by the absorption of blend films shown in Fig. 7, while the much higher FF of the D-BDT-SQ device than the two reference devices (0.50 vs. 0.41) could be attributed to its much higher μh and better balanced μe/μh (Table 3), as we discussed above.

Upon thermal annealing (80 °C, 15 min), the PCEs of all three squaraine-based devices increased, but the D-BDT-SQ device continued to show the highest PCE (6.33% vs. 4.31% and 4.77%). As depicted in Table 3, the enhanced PCEs of these devices should be attributed to their enhanced Jsc and FF, which originated from the higher charge mobility and better morphologies of the active layers (Fig. 8) than those of their as-cast samples. It is noted that this is also the first report of squaraine-based solution-processed BHJ-OSCs with PCE over 6%, when the devices were measured at room temperature.
Taking into consideration that the outdoor working temperature of OSCs is generally higher than room temperature, these OSC devices were measured at 80 °C.39 Excitingly, all their PCEs notably improved because both the Jsc and FF were observed to be enhanced significantly (Table 3, Fig. 6). In fact, under thermal testing, the PCEs of the S-SQ and BDT-SQ devices increased to 5.52% and 5.75%, respectively, while that of the D-BDT-SQ device was enhanced to as high as 7.41%. As shown in Table 3, with increasing the temperature from room temperature (r.t.) to 80 °C, both electron and hole mobility increased, which can be explained by the thermally activated carrier transport.40,41 For example, the μh of the D-BDT-SQ-based device increased by 168% at 80 °C, while the μe only enhanced by 41% compared to that at r.t. Therefore, the μe/μh ratio of the D-BDT-SQ-based device dropped from 2.2 to 1.2. This higher μh together with the better balanced μe/μh of the active layers at high temperature, leading to much higher charge carrier extraction efficiency, and hence higher Jsc and FF could be achieved.
4. Conclusion
In summary, by linking two planar S-SQ moieties with a planar BDT bridging unit, a novel bis(squaraine) derivative, namely D-BDT-SQ, was constructed. In comparison with S-SQ and BDT-modified monosquaraine BDT-SQ, the bis(squaraine) D-BDT-SQ displayed one order of magnitude enhanced hole mobility of up to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in BHJ-OSCs, which is attributed to its larger planar molecular geometry and π-extended electronic structure than those of S-SQ and BDT-SQ. Additionally, the integration of the BDT unit with the S-SQ scaffold could also endow squaraines with a red-shifted absorption band, narrow optical bandgap and lower HOMO energy level. As a result, D-BDT-SQ-based solution-processed BHJ-OSCs could exhibit not only considerably enhanced Jsc and FF compared to the S-SQ- and BDT-SQ-based reference devices, but also higher Voc than the S-SQ device, leading to an impressive PCE of 7.41%. Note that this represents the record PCE of squaraine-based single-junction OSCs reported so far. These exciting results demonstrated that this novel π-extension strategy should be an effective way to achieve high-performance photovoltaic materials capable of showing much enhanced carrier mobility together with narrow bandgaps and relatively deep HOMO energy levels. Since the properties of squaraines can be easily tuned by modification of their chemical structure, we believe that there is still great room for the development of high performance squaraine-based photovoltaic materials.
