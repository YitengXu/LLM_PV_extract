    , Accepted 3rd August 2016First published on 3rd August 2016AbstractStudies on Sc3+-based nanomaterials have been reported in recent years. However, most of the as-prepared nanomaterials are hydrophobic, thus complicated surface encapsulation renders them hydrophilic for biological applications. In our work, we used water soluble polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a chelating agent and a classic hydrothermal method to prepare water soluble cubic K2NaScF6 nanocrystals (NCs) for the first time. Different ratios of NH4F/RE (3, 4, 5, 6) have been studied in the crystalline phase transformation from KSc2F7 to K2NaScF6 NCs. When the ratio is over 6, an unusual hexagonal NaYbF4 phase separation phenomenon can be observed. In addition, Yb3+/Er3+ ion pairs have been doped into the K2NaScF6 NCs to verify that they are better up-conversion luminescence matrix materials than KSc2F7 NCs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, lanthanide-doped luminescent materials have attracted a lot of attention due to their potential applications in solid state lasers, solar cells, fluorescent probes and many other areas.1–7 The luminescence process mainly includes up-conversion (UC, transforms two or more low-energy photons into one higher-energy photon) and down-conversion (DC, transforms one high-energy photon into one or more low-energy photons). Neither the UC nor DC process can act without the participation of the ion's energy level (known as the Dieke diagram).8–12 Lanthanides have abundant energy levels because of their unique electronic configuration and these energy levels can be selected and designed to absorb or emit designated light.13 This is the reason why lanthanides are popular in the optical field. In addition, the host material is also an important factor that affects the luminescence efficiency of lanthanides. Among earth-based oxides, fluorides, phosphates and vanadates, fluorides are particularly attractive not only due to their low-energy phonons, which lead to increased luminescence efficiency, but also due to the availability of several synthetic routes to synthesize them in the colloidal form. Another excellent host material for Ln3+ ion doping and especially for UC is K2NaScF6 NCs, which has not been studied in great detail at the nanoscale, as well as controlled synthesis under varying experimental conditions.14–18
In the periodic table, scandium (Sc) sits at not only the very top of group IIIB, but also the very beginning of the transition metals. Sc3+ ion-based fluorides such as NaScF4, Na3ScF6, KSc2F7 and K2NaScF6 have been prepared and reported.19–22 Under 980 nm excitation, Yb/Er doped Sc3+ ion based UC nanocrystals usually give a strong red UC luminescence at 660 nm, which is suitable for bio-probes.23–26 Water solubility is also a prerequisite for these nanomaterials to be applied as bio-probes. However, most of these Sc3+ ion based fluorides were prepared through a solution-based co-thermolysis of metal complex precursors at temperatures above 300 °C. The as-prepared NCs are hydrophobic, thus complicated surface encapsulation is required to render them hydrophilic for biological applications. Besides, suitable applications normally require the UC nanocrystals to have precise parameters, such as size, shape, crystallographic phase, chemical composition, and the desired luminescence properties. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the K2NaScF6 growth process is necessary.
Here, we used water soluble polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the chelating agent and NH4F as the fluorine source to prepare water soluble cubic K2NaScF6 NCs for the first time. PVP is a highly biocompatible polymer, its accumulation in vital organs is very low and the active groups on PVP make it easy to further modify these NCs. These properties of PVP are highly desired in bio-material studies.27,28 In subsequent experiments, by adjusting the ratio of NH4F/RE and the amount of PVP, the crystalline phase of the product transformed from KSc2F7 to K2NaScF6 NCs, and the size of both K2NaScF6 and KSc2F7 NCs decreased. Furthermore, a series of ion pairs such as Yb/Er, Yb/Ho, and Ce/Tb have been doped into the K2NaScF6 NCs, and the results showed that cubic K2NaScF6 NCs are excellent UC and DC luminescent matrix materials.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Sc(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), Yb(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), Er(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), Ho(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), and Tb(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%) were supplied by Yutai Qingda Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. China. Polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 (PVP, 58000 g mol−1), NaNO3 (AR), KNO3 (AR), NH4F (AR) and ethanol (AR) were supplied by Beijing Fine Chemical Company.
2.2 Synthesis of the cubic K2NaScF6 NCs
Polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 (PVP, 1.5 g) was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) to form a transparent solution. Then, 0.44 mmol of Sc(NO3)3, 0.05 mmol of Yb(NO3)3, 0.01 mmol of Er(NO3)3, 1 mmol of NaNO3 and 2 mmol of KNO3 were added into the PVP solution under strong stirring. NH4F (3 mmol) was dissolved in 2 ml of water, added dropwise into the above solution, and continuously stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, the above solution was transferred into a polytetrafluoroethylene autoclave, and then heated at 180 °C for 12 hours. The final product was obtained by centrifugation and washed with ethanol several times. The other samples were prepared by a similar process, only replacing the appropriate reactant.
2.3 Characterization
The crystal structures and phase purities were analyzed by a Rigaku RU-200b X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) using nickel-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The sizes and morphologies of the samples were investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi H-600). Low- to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. UC spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer which was equipped with a power-controllable 980 nm CW diode laser.
3. Results and discussion
XRD patterns of the samples that were synthesized at different NH4F:RE molar ratios and different amounts of PVP are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. The details of the reaction NH4F:RE molar ratio, amount of PVP and crystallographic phase of the product NCs are shown in Table 1. In all these reactions, the Na:RE molar ratio is 2:1 and the K:RE molar ratio is 4:1, the only difference is the concentration of NH4F. When the NH4F:RE molar ratio is 3:1, the XRD pattern of the product NCs are shown in Fig. 1a. All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the standard XRD pattern of KSc2F7 (JCPDS 77-1321) and no other peaks can be found in this pattern.

When the proportion of NH4F was increased to a higher ratio 4, 5 or 6, some new diffraction peaks can be detected and their intensity increased with the increase of NH4F's concentration. These new peaks can be indexed to the standard XRD pattern of K2NaScF6 (JCPDS 73-337), and the diffraction peaks belonging to KSc2F7 become weaker as the NH4F:RE molar ratio increases. At this time, the crystallographic phase of the products is a mixture of K2NaScF6 and KSc2F7. When the NH4F:RE molar ratio reaches the value of 6:1, the diffraction peaks of KSc2F7 cannot be detected any more; these products are pure K2NaScF6 NCs. When the ratio continuously increases to 8:1 or 12:1, some unexpected diffraction peaks have been detected. These peaks belong to hexagonal NaYbF4 (JCPDS 27-1427). This phenomenon may be due to the big difference between the rare earth ionic radii of Sc (0.0885 nm) and the doping ion Yb (0.1008 nm). Compared with NaYbF4, the nucleation speed of KSc2F7 and K2NaScF6 is much faster, and with the low-fluoride source, the crystal growth of KSc2F7 and K2NaScF6 will soon run out of F− ions, therefore the formation of NaYbF4 is difficult. When there is excess of the fluorine source, the remaining F− and Yb3+ ions will form NaYbF4.20
In order to study the effect of the surfactant PVP on the crystallographic phase and the morphology of the products, we adjust the amount of PVP from 0.5 g to 1.5 g with the NH4F:RE reaction ratio at 3 and 6, and the other reaction conditions remain unchanged. The XRD patterns of these products are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding TEM images are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 2, adjusting the amount of PVP does not change the crystallographic phase of the products; the diffraction peaks of the resulting XRD patterns of the products are well indexed to those of the original standard XRD pattern. However, the morphology of these NCs changed obviously, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a and c show the TEM images of the NCs which were prepared using NH4F:RE = 6, PVP = 0.5 g and NH4F:RE = 6, PVP = 1.5 g. These NCs are ellipsoidal K2NaScF6. Comparing these two TEM images, it can be seen that when the concentration of PVP is increased, the radius of K2NaScF6 NCs decreases from 155 nm to 122 nm, and the size of the nanoparticles becomes more uniform. Fig. 3b and d show the TEM images of rod-like KSc2F7. Compared with K2NaScF6, adjusting the amount of PVP has a similar effect on KSc2F7, but more significant. When the amount of PVP is 0.5 g, the morphology of the KSc2F7 crystals is inhomogeneous: the diameter of these NCs is about 47 nm and the ratio of length to diameter can be more than 50 or less than 2. But when the amount of PVP is increased to 1.5 g, the morphology of the KSc2F7 crystals is a homogeneous nanorod, the diameter of the NCs is still about 47 nm, but the ratio of length to diameter distribution is narrower, from 2 to 8.

A schematic illustration for the possible formation process is shown in Fig. 4. Generally, the growth process of crystals can be separated into two steps, an initial nucleating stage and a subsequent crystal growth process. In the low amount of fluoride source environment, Sc3+ ions tend to react with F− and K+ to form orthorhombic KSc2F7 crystal nuclei. Due to different crystal growth rates in different directions, it will eventually epitaxial grow into a rod-like KSc2F7 crystal. While in the high amount of fluoride source environment, Sc3+ ions tend to react with F−, Na+ and K+ to form an isotropic cubic K2NaScF6 crystal, therefore it will epitaxially grow into a spherical K2NaScF6 crystal. Besides, in these crystal growth processes, PVP plays an important role in regulating the morphology of the crystals. As the amount of PVP in solution increased, the opportunity for the monomers to attach to the nucleated seeds becomes lower and the differences between the growth directions become smaller, which resulted in a smaller crystal size and more uniform crystal morphology.

In order to compare the UC luminescence properties of K2NaScF6 and KSc2F7, we doped Yb3+/Er3+ ion pairs into these two luminescent host materials with the same concentration and excited these two materials by the same 0.4 W cm−2 980 nm laser. Their UC luminescence spectra are shown in Fig. 5. As is shown in the figure, we can observe the 519 nm, 551 nm and 650 nm characteristic emission peaks of Er3+ ions from the spectra of both materials between 500 nm to 700 nm; they can be attributed to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively. The UC luminescence intensity of K2NaScF6 NCs is much stronger than that of KSc2F7 NCs. K2NaScF6 NCs shows better luminescence performance in UC emission.

To investigate more details about the luminescence property of K2NaScF6 as an efficient luminescent host, we doped 10 mol% Yb/2 mol% Ho and 10 mol% Ce/5 mol% Tb into the K2NaScF6 NCs. Fig. 6 and 7 show the UC spectra of K2NaScF6: 10 mol% Yb/2 mol% Ho NCs under 980 nm excitation and the DC luminescence spectrum of K2NaScF6: 10 mol% Ce/5 mol% Tb NCs under 260 nm excitation, respectively. As is shown in Fig. 6, three characteristic emission peaks of Ho3+ ions can be observed, 536 nm, 548 nm and 657 nm; they can be attributed to 5F4 → 5I8, 5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions. Among them, the intensity of the green luminescence peaks (536 nm, 548 nm) is the highest; the other emission peaks are much weaker. As is shown in Fig. 7, under excitation of 260 nm UV light, the emission spectrum shows a broad band and a group of characteristic emission lines at 488 nm, 541 nm, 586 nm and 617 nm, which are ascribed to the 5D4 → 7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) transitions of Tb3+ ions, respectively. Of these characteristic lines of Tb3+ ions, the green luminescence peak at 541 nm is the most prominent one.

 Fig. 7  DC luminescence spectra and corresponding water solution luminescence photo of K2NaScF6: 10 mol% Ce/5 mol% Tb NCs under 260 nm excitation. 
As shown in Fig. 8a and b, when Yb/Er or Yb/Ho ion pairs were excited by a 980 nm laser, compared with the Er3+ or Ho3+ ion, the concentration of the Yb3+ ion is higher and the absorption peak at 980 nm is wider; most of the 980 nm light is absorbed by the Yb3+ ion, then through an energy transfer (ET) process between Yb3+ and Er3+/Ho3+ transfers the energy from Yb3+ to Er3+/Ho3+ ions. In Fig. 8a, two ET processes from the Yb3+ to Er3+ ion excite the 4I15/2 level to 4I11/2 and 4F7/2 levels, then nonradiative relaxations from the 4F7/2 level to 2H11/2, 4S3/2 or 4F9/2 levels, finally back to the background 4I15/2 level, emitting 519 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2), 551 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) green light, 650 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) red light. In addition, when the Er3+ ion stays at the 4I11/2 level, it may nonradiatively relax to 4I13/2, then one ET processes excite the 4I13/2 level to 4F9/2 levels, then back to the 4I15/2 level, also emitting 650 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) red light. As shown in Fig. 8b, when Yb/Ho ion pairs were excited under 980 nm, two ET processes from the Yb3+ to Ho3+ ion excite the 5I8 level to 5I6 and 5F4, 5S2 levels, then back to 5I8, emitting 536 nm (5F4 → 5I8), 548 nm (5S2 → 5I8) green light, or nonradiative relaxation to the 5F5 level, then back to 5I8, emitting 657 nm (5F5 → 5I8) red light. In addition, when the Ho3+ ion stays at the 5I6 level, it may be excited to 5F5 through one ET process. In Fig. 8c, when Ce/Tb ions were excited by 260 nm UV light, the Ce3+ ion absorbs 260 nm UV light and is excited to the 5d level, then transfers energy to the Tb3+ ion. After a series of nonradiative relaxation, finally the Tb3+ ion reaches the 5D4 level, subsequently goes back to the 7DJ (J = 3, 4, 5, 6) levels and emits different light: 488 nm (5D4 → 7F6), 541 nm (5D4 → 7F5), 586 nm (5D4 → 7F4) and 617 nm (5D4 → 7F3).

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, water soluble cubic K2NaScF6 NCs have been prepared by a classic hydrothermal method using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a chelating agent. By increasing the ratio of NH4F/RE (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12), we achieved the crystalline phase transformation from KSc2F7 to K2NaScF6. When the amount of PVP is increased from 0.5 g to 1.5 g, the size of both K2NaScF6 and KSc2F7 NCs decreases. Yb3+/Er3+ ion pairs have been doped into the K2NaScF6 and KSc2F7 NCs to confirm that K2NaScF6 is a better UC luminescence matrix material than KSc2F7 NCs. Besides, the diameter of PVP modified K2NaScF6 NCs is about 120 nm, which exhibits excellent water solubility. These excellent features of K2NaScF6 NCs make them a good candidate for applications in lanthanide-based luminescent bioprobes.
