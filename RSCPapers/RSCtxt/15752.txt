    , Accepted 16th February 2012First published on 9th March 2012AbstractCu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is acknowledged as an alternative to traditional p-type semiconductors. Traditionally obtained CZTS, however, is mostly kesterite or stannite phase, which features a tetragonal crystal cell. Herein, novel orthorhombic CZTS has been synthesized via an ethylenediamine-assisted hydrothermal method. Ethylenediamine plays an important part in the construction of the orthorhombic phase. Kesterite CZTS was also obtained in an ultrapure water system without ethylenediamine. The structure was confirmed by XRD, XPS and HRTEM. The band gap of the orthorhombic CZTS is about 1.45 eV, which approaches the optimum value for solar photoelectric conversion. What's more, we found that this orthorhombic CZTS is metastable. After annealing at 500 °C, a phase transformation from the orthorhombic structure to the tetragonal kesterite structure was achieved. The photoelectric response was also characterised, which demonstrated its potential for application in photovoltaic devices.
Introduction
Research into highly efficient and cost-effective solar cells has become more and more important due to the world's constantly growing energy demands.1–3 Among the numerous potential materials for thin film solar cells, chalcopyrite-based thin solar cells using CuInxGa1−xS(Se)2 (CIGS) as the absorber film show good chemical stability and high efficiency for photoelectric conversion.4,5 However, the limitation in supply of the rare In and Ga metals has restricted the further development of CIGS solar cells. Cu2ZnSnS4, which has a similar structure to CIGS, a suitable optical band gap energy and is naturally abundant in the environment, is anticipated to be a substitute for CIGS.6–13 In fact, the theoretical limit of the power conversion efficiency for CZTS is as high as 32.2%, according to Shockley–Queisser photon balance calculations.9 Experimentally, thin film solar cells based on CZTS have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 7.3%14 and 8.4%,15 which promote the research into CZTS and its application in the field of thin film solar cells.
Most I2–II–IV–VI4 compounds crystallize with a superstructure of the zinc-blende (ZB) or wurtzite (WS) type, showing the tetragonal stannite (ZB-derived) or the orthorhombic wurtzite–stannite (WS-derived) structure as reported in the literature.16 It is well known that the total energy for these compounds depends on the sum of the Madelung and strain energy, so that different contributions of the Madelung and strain energy make various I2–II–IV–VI4 compounds have different ground state structures.17 Generally speaking, I2–II–IV–VI4 compounds prefer the WZ-derived structures when the group-I and group-II cations have stronger ionicity, but the priority of the WZ-derived structures becomes weaker when the group-IV cations and group-VI anions are larger. Experimentally, compounds with the orthorhombic structure have been reported, such as Cu2ZnGeS4, Cu2ZnGeSe4, Cu2CdGeS4, etc.16–20 The majority of experimental and theoretical studies show that CZTS has a kesterite structure which features a tetragonal cell.21–27 Recently, wurtzite phase CZTS nanocrystals rather than the typical kesterite phase have been made by a hot-injection method.28 These investigations indicate that the formation of a crystal phase is closely related to the reaction conditions.
In this study, we report the synthesis of orthorhombic CZTS using a hydrothermal method with the assistance of ethylenediamine. The orthorhombic structure is based on a double wurtzite cell in which the arrangement of the anions is hexagonal close-packed. It has a Pmn21 space group. The products were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction patterns (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-Visible absorption spectra. Ethylenediamine and the annealing temperature play important roles in the process of the CZTS phase transition between the tetragonal and orthorhombic structures. Films were also fabricated to study the electronic properties of the as-synthesized CZTS.
Experimental
Preparation of materials
Tin dichloride (SnCl2·2H2O) and zinc chloride powders (ZnCl2) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co. Ltd. Copper chloride (CuCl2·2H2O) and thiocarbamide were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Ethylenediamine was purchased from Tianjin Dengke Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All the chemicals were analytical-grade reagents and were used without further purification. Orthorhombic CZTS was synthesized via a hydrothermal method with the assistance of ethylenediamine. In a typical experiment, 0.5 mmol of ZnCl2, 0.5 mmol SnCl2·2H2O, 1 mmol CuCl2·2H2O and 4 mmol thiocarbamide were dissolved in a 40 ml mixed solvent of ultrapure water and ethylenediamine (volume ratio = 1:1) with magnetic stirring. Then the precursors were transferred into a 55 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 24 h. Afterwards it was cooled to room temperature, a black precipitate was collected which was washed with ethanol several times and dried under vacuum.
Characterization of samples
The XRD patterns were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) (the tube voltage and electric current were 40 kV and 20 mA). The structure and morphology were studied by TEM (JEM-1011, 100 kV) and HRTEM (JEM-2100, 200 kV). Raman spectra were collected on a LabRAM HR 800 system (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) using a 17 mW air-cooled He–Ne laser with the 632.8 nm wavelength as the excitation source. All spectra were calibrated with respect to the silicon Raman mode at 520.7 cm−1. Chemical composition analysis of the as-synthesized CZTS crystals was determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford INCA Sight X, Mn Kα) performed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F). XPS was performed by an ESCALAB 250 instrument using a source of Al Kα radiation. UV-Visible absorption spectra were conducted using a U-4100 UV-Visible/NIR spectrophotometer. Current–voltage curves were performed using an electrochemical analyzer with a xenon lamp (∼100 mW cm−2) as light source.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the orthorhombic CZTS
An XRD pattern of the orthorhombic CZTS synthesized by an ethylenediamine-assisted hydrothermal method at 200 °C for 24 h (the volume ratio of added ethylenediamine and ultrapure water is 1:1) is shown in Fig. 1. All the peaks appearing at 2θ = 27.05, 27.34, 28.56, 30.58, 30.95, 39.77, 47.60, 48.29, 51.76, 56.32 can be attributed to the lattice planes of (210), (020), (002), (211), (021), (212), (400), (230), (023), (402) in simulated orthorhombic CZTS. The enlarged view of the diffraction peaks in the 2θ range of 26–32.5° is shown in the inset. Compared with the wurtzite phase CZTS reported in the literature,28 the diffraction peak of orthorhombic CZTS in the vicinity of 27° is divided into two peaks, which is consistent with the simulation results. The orthorhombic structure of CZTS (space group Pmn21) is based on a double wurtzite cell16,17 (see electronic supplementary information for details†), which is a more accurate description of this wurtzite-derived structure. In an ideal structure model (Fig. S1†), the sulfur anions in the orthorhombic structure are hexagonally close packed, as exhibited in the wurtzite structure, while the cations have an ordered arrangement. Planes of zinc(II) and tin(IV) cations are separated by planes containing only copper(I) cations.16 In fact, the cations of Cu and Zn are usually disordered in the structure of I2–II–IV–VI4 compounds because Cu and Zn are close in atomic number and have similar ionic radii.29

Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of as-synthesized CZTS. The lower-magnification TEM image (Fig. 2a) reveals that most of the CZTS particles display a plate-like morphology, with sizes varying from 20 to 50 nm. Fig. 2b displays the high-resolution TEM image of CZTS. The interplanar spacings of 2.9 and 3.1 Å are in accordance with the (211) and (002) planes of orthorhombic CZTS. The lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 0.31 nm corresponds to the (002) plane of orthorhombic CZTS, while as mentioned in references,24,30–32 the same value of d is ascribed to the (112) plane of kesterite CZTS. The diffraction spots in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Fig. 2c correspond to the (210/020), (002), (212), (400/230), (023), and (402) planes of orthorhombic CZTS. Further structural information is determined from the Raman spectra. Fig. S4† shows the room temperature Raman scattering results of CZTS powder synthesised in different solvents. The most intense Raman peak at about 331 cm−1 is clearly observed for kesterite CZTS synthesised in ultrapure water.30 Orthorhombic CZTS has a similar Raman spectra to kesterite CZTS. This indicates that their main vibration modes are similar, although they have different arrangements of atoms and belong to different space groups. The composition of the CZTS particles can be confirmed using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S2†), which shows that the as-synthesized CZTS particles contain Cu, Zn, Sn and S.

XPS characterization of the CZTS crystals shows the valence states of the constituent elements in Fig. 3. The copper 2p peaks located at 851.6 and 931.8 eV, and a peak splitting at 19.8 eV indicate Cu(I). The zinc 2p peaks at 1044, with a peak separation at 23 eV and 1021 eV indicate Zn(II). The peaks of the tin 3d located at 498.3 and 486.9 eV indicate Sn(IV) with a splitting peak at 8.4 eV. The sulfur 2p peaks in the spectra are located at 163.4 and 162.3 eV which are consistent with the 160–164 eV range of S in the sulphide phases. These results are consistent with those reported in the literature.6,31,38

Room temperature UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 4 was used to analyze the optical properties of the as-synthesized CZTS crystals. The band gap (Eg) of orthorhombic CZTS can be estimated by plotting (αhν)2versus hν, where α is the absorption coefficient and hν (h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency) represents the photon energy. The value of Eg is estimated at 1.45 eV by extrapolating the linear portion to the x axis (hν), compared with the reported values for kesterite CZTS (1.4–1.6 eV)31,32 and wurtzite CZTS (1.4 eV)28 in the literature. Such a band gap value is close to the optimum value for photovoltaic applications.

To further analyze the detailed electronic structure, we calculated the band gap structure and electronic states of orthorhombic CZTS. We performed first-principles calculations using density functional theory with the GGA-PBE functional (GGA: generalized gradient approximation; PBE: Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof). The calculated band gap of orthorhombic CZTS is shown in Fig. S3a.† Since this calculation method usually underestimates the band gap significantly,17,39 the calculated band gap of orthorhombic CZTS is lower than the obtained experimental value. Fig. S3b† is the density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of orthorhombic CZTS. It is clearly shown that the top of the valance band is mainly made up of Cu 3d and S 3p, while the bottom of the conduction band consists of Sn 5s and S 3p orbitals.
Phase selective synthesis and phase transition
In order to understand the phase selective synthesis process, we studied the factors influencing the synthesis of orthorhombic CZTS and the phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal. The XRD patterns of the orthorhombic CZTS crystals synthesized with different volume ratios of ethylenediamine and ultrapure water are shown in Fig. 5. The XRD pattern of CZTS synthesized without ethylenediamine matches well with the tetragonal kesterite type CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575). With the increase of ethylenediamine, the characteristic XRD peaks of orthorhombic CZTS are more and more obvious indicating that the crystalline structure of CZTS is gradually transformed into the orthorhombic structure. Although the orthorhombic and tetragonal structures belong to different space groups, their arrangements of atoms in the crystal structures are similar in a sense. Hence, the three strongest peaks of these two structures are at almost the same positions as in the experimental XRD patterns shown. However, this orthorhombic CZTS is metastable and the phase transformation from orthorhombic to tetragonal could be achieved by annealing orthorhombic CZTS at certain temperatures. Fig. 6 displays the XRD patterns of as-synthesized CZTS before and after annealing at different temperatures for 2 h in a sulfur atmosphere. The as-synthesized CZTS annealed at 450 °C for 2 h still maintains the orthorhombic structure. However, the XRD pattern shows that the structure of the CZTS particles annealed at 500 °C changes into kesterite type. These data show that the phase transition temperature of the as-synthesised orthorhombic CZTS is about 500 °C. Hence, a phase transition would occur when orthorhombic CZTS is annealed at or above this temperature.

The simulated XRD patterns of orthorhombic CZTS and the XRD pattern of kesterite CZTS (JCPDS 26-0575) are shown below.

Many II–VI semiconductor nanomaterials have both ZB and WZ structures. Among most of these compounds, the two structures are almost identical except for the stacking sequence of successive layers and the small difference in internal energies.16 The Gibbs free energy curves of the ZB and WZ structures cross each other in their phase diagram, indicating that the phase transition would occur under certain conditions. It has been mentioned in references that the formation of unique phase II–VI semiconductor compounds is mainly due to the surface energy of the particles.33 Recently, researchers have developed a hydrothermal synthesis route34 in the presence of organic solvents which could exchange particles’ surface energy to prepare wurtzite phase products at low-temperature. Experiments show that the hexagonally structured crystallites of II–VI compounds are easily formed in the presence of ethylenediamine.34,35 Herein, ethylenediamine is introduced as an auxiliary solvent to synthesize orthorhombic CZTS. Ethylenediamine is well known as a common chelating ligand for coordination compounds, as a result of having two hydrophilic functional groups of –NH2. The formation of chemical bonds on the surface of the CZTS particles between the surface metal atoms and the –NH2 groups could exchange the surface energy of the CZTS crystals, just like the synthesis of wurtzite II–VI compounds,36,37 which allows the existence of metastable orthorhombic CZTS. Additionally, the difference in the lowest total energy between the wurtzite-derived and zinc-blende structures of CZTS is very small (6.0 meV atom−1),17 so a phase transition from orthorhombic to kesterite could be achieved easily.
Photoelectric response
To analyse the electrical properties of as-synthesized orthorhombic CZTS, films were fabricated by dripping the concentrated crystal dispersion on sodium lime glass with ethylene glycol as the solvent. Fig. 7 shows the current–voltage curve of the as-synthesized CZTS film measured in the dark and under illumination. The tested results show that the resistivity of orthorhombic CZTS films under illumination becomes smaller than in the dark, indicating that the film has potential for solar energy conversion applications.

Conclusions
In summary, orthorhombic CZTS has been successfully synthesized by an ethylenediamine-assisted hydrothermal method. Ethylenediamine plays a key role in the synthesis of the wurtzite-derived structure. Orthorhombic CZTS particles transform into the kesterite structure when they are annealed at 500 °C. It shows that the orthorhombic structure is a metastable phase for CZTS. The band gap of as-synthesised CZTS is about 1.45 eV, which approaches the optimum value for solar photoelectric conversion. The photoelectric response of the as-synthesized CZTS film indicates that it has potential applications in solar energy conversion.
