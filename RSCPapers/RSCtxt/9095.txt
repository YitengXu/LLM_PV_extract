    , Accepted 6th May 2016First published on 9th May 2016AbstractSolar cells containing upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) used as a power source in biomedical nanosystems have attracted great interest. However, such solar cells further need to be developed because their substrate materials should be biocompatible, flexible and highly luminescent. Here, we report that freestanding silk fibroin (SF) films containing a mesh of silver nanowires (AgNWs) and β-NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals with metal-enhanced fluorescence behavior can be fabricated. The freestanding composite films exhibit properties such as good optical transparency, conductivity and flexibility. Furthermore, they show significantly enhanced upconversion fluorescence due to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) of AgNWs compared to the SF–UCNP films without AgNWs. The freestanding composite films with metal-enhanced fluorescence behavior show great promise for future applications in self-powered nanodevices such as cardiac pacemakers, biosensors and nanorobots.
Introduction
Biomedical nanosystems composed of nanodevices and a nano-power-source may show potential applications in real-time biomedical monitoring and detection. However the development of these nanosystems is partly limited by power supply. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a new power source to replace batteries since batteries not only greatly limit the portability of the nanosystems but also dramatically increase the size and weight of the nanosystems.1,2 In order to resolve the above-described problems, “self-powered nanotechnology” which provides energy produced from the environment for nanosystems was introduced in 2006 by Wang.3 After that, several self-powered nanotechnologies including nanogenerators,4–6 biofuel cells7–9 and 980 nm laser-driven solar cells10–13 have been reported. Among them, 980 nm laser-driven solar cells firstly reported by Chen10 as a green energy have attracted more and more attention. It is well known that there is little absorption of near-infrared (NIR) light ranging from 700 to 1000 nm by biological tissues. For example, the typical penetration depth into biological tissue of 980 nm light could be up to several centimeters.14,15 Unfortunately, light-absorbing materials used for solar cells cannot efficiently absorb NIR light. For example, the most commonly used dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are ruthenium-based dyes with a large optical bandgap of 1.8 eV, which can only absorb light less than 700 nm.
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) can convert infrared light into visible light, which show potential applications in bioimaging, sensors, lasers, photodynamic therapy and solar cells.16–19 Incorporating UCNPs into solar cells provides a feasible way to power biomedical nanosystems. Chen10 firstly reported the fabrication of 980 nm laser-driven dye-sensitized solar cells (980LD-PVCs) by incorporating UCNPs into N3 dye-sensitized TiO2 films. These 980LD-PVCs efficiently provided output power even when covered by intestinal layers.
Despite this, there still exist several main shortcomings for 980LD-PVCs. One of them is the fragility of devices since ITO glass is used as the substrate. In order to power nanodevices in vivo, 980 nm laser-driven solar cells should be biocompatible, nontoxic and flexible. Therefore, how to develop a substrate with properties such as biocompatibility,20 flexibility as well as good conductivity and transmittance is a great challenge.
Low upconversion luminescence efficiency is another shortcoming due to the small absorption cross-sections of the dopants,21 which eventually leads to insufficient photoelectric conversion efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of up-conversion luminescence.22,23 A variety of methods such as a core–shell nanostructure,24 phase transition25 and plasmon enhancement21,26,27 have been developed to improve the fluorescence intensity of UCNPs. Among these methods, plasmon enhancement has attracted extensive interest. For instance, Piatkowski28 revealed efficient coupling between plasmons in a single Ag nanowire and UCNPs. Last but not the least, for application in solar cells, UCNPs are usually located in front of the solar cells to minimize incident light scattering through post-processing,29,30 which complicates the device fabrication.
Currently, the typical flexible substrates are mostly composed of synthetic polymers, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyimide (PI), and poly-ethylene naphthalate (PEN). However, these petroleum-based substrates are difficult to degrade which are not environmentally friendly.31 Silk fibroin (SF) is a natural macromolecular fibrous protein derived from silkworm (bombyx mori) cocoons. SF displays excellent mechanical and optical properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability and implantability.32,33 Compared to substrates based on synthetic polymers, our previous work showed that the AgNW/SF substrate is biocompatible and shows biodegradability properties while maintaining good flexibility, conductivity and mechanical properties.34–36 In order to solve shortcomings of 980 nm laser-driven solar cells as mentioned above, AgNWs and β-NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals were employed on silicon substrates by spin-coating in this research. Then the nanocomposites were embedded into silk fibroin to obtain freestanding composite films (SF–AgNWs–UCNPs films). Microstructure, fluorescence spectra, optical transmittance, conductivity and flexibility of the SF–AgNW–UCNP films were characterized. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time the fabrication of transparent and conductive SF–AgNW–UCNP films with metal-enhanced fluorescence behavior has been reported.
Experimental
Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals
Typically, 0.78 mmol of Y(CF3COO)3, 0.2 mmol of Yb(CF3COO)3, 0.02 mmol Er(CF3COO)3, 2 mmol NaF and 20 mL of solvent (10 mL OA/10 mL ODE) were added to a 50 mL three-necked flask simultaneously and degassed at 100 °C for 1 h under vacuum. In the presence of nitrogen, the mixture was then heated rapidly to 320 °C and kept at this temperature for 1.5 h under vigorous magnetic stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the products were precipitated by the addition of ethanol, separated by centrifugation, and washed repeatedly by ethanol and water. The resulting nanoparticles could be redispersed in various non-polar organic solvents.
Preparation of the composite films
The transmittance and conductivity properties of composite films mainly depend on the concentration of AgNWs. The optimal concentration of AgNWs (0.5 mg mL−1) has been chosen in previous work.35 The isopropanol solution of AgNWs (0.5 mg mL−1, Suzhou Coldstones technology co., Ltd) and NaYF4:Yb,Er cyclohexane solution (0.5 mg mL−1) were spin-coated onto a polished silicon wafer substrate in turn. Then the aqueous SF solution was dropped onto the wafer substrate. After the water was naturally evaporated at room temperature, the composite films were carefully peeled off from the silicon wafer to obtain the composite films.
Characterization
The morphology of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals and composite films was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (HT7700, Hitachi, Japan). The XRD pattern of the product was collected utilizing Cu Kα X-ray radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA using X'pert pro diffractometer (Philips, Holland).37 The luminescence spectra was measured using an FLS980E spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd, UK).38 The transmittance spectrum was measured using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (UV2550, Shimadzu, Japan).39 The resistance was tested using the four-point probe method. The bending test for evaluating the films' flexibility was performed using a KES-F hand meter (KES-FB4, KATO, Japan).
Results and discussion
The schematic illustration of the preparation of SF–AgNW–UCNP films is shown in Fig. 1. The AgNWs were firstly spin-coated onto a silicon wafer (Fig. 1a). Then UCNPs were spin-coated onto the silicon wafer coated with AgNWs (Fig. 1b). In the next step, the aqueous SF solution was dropped onto the silicon wafer (Fig. 1c). The SF films were formed after water was vaporized and the films were carefully peeled off from the silicon wafer (Fig. 1d). Finally the freestanding SF–AgNW–UCNP films were obtained (Fig. 1e). Instead of directly spin-coating AgNWs/UCNPs on SF films, this method could provide a good flatness of the freestanding SF films.36

Characterization of UCNPs
NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals used in this work were synthesized by the thermal decomposition of rare-earth and sodium fluorides in a high boiling point solvent composed of oleic acid and 1-octadecene. Particle size and uniformity are measured by TEM shown in Fig. 2a. It can be seen that these nanocrystals are almost spherical and uniform. The average size of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals is calculated to be ∼20 nm (Fig. 2c).

Fig. 2b shows the XRD pattern of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals prepared (upper) which agrees well with the calculated values of the hexagonal NaYF4:Yb,Er (JCPDS No. 28-1192) (lower). No peaks of any other phase are found, indicating the high purity of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals.
Morphology of SF–AgNW–UCNP films
The morphology of the AgNWs is characterized by SEM as shown in Fig. 3a. According to the SEM image, the diameter of the AgNWs ranges from 30 to 40 nm and the length varies from 10 to 20 μm. Owing to embedding the AgNW mesh into SF films instead of directly spin-coating them on SF films, the AgNWs are well buried in the SF films with good distribution and intercross (Fig. 3b), which improve their adhesion to the SF films. Spin-coated NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals disperse around the AgNWs randomly, and a small amount of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals even distribute on top of the AgNW network (Fig. 3c). The inset in Fig. 3c is the photograph of freestanding SF–AgNW–UCNP films, which obviously show transparency.

Fluorescence properties of SF–AgNW–UCNP films
Different concentrations of UCNPs are used to understand the impact of the SF–AgNW–UCNP films on the fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence intensity generally increases with increasing concentration of UCNPs until it reaches a maximum (0.5 mg mL−1) and begins to decrease as quenching dominates over enhancement.26 Therefore, the concentration of AgNWs and UCNPs used is 0.5 mg mL−1 for both.
The upconversion luminescence spectra of SF–UCNP films and SF–AgNW–UCNP films are shown in Fig. 4. The UC emission spectrum (excited at 980 nm) of SF–UCNP films and SF–AgNW–UCNP films shows green and red emissions located around 522, 543 and 659 nm, which correspond to the 4f configuration transitions of Er3+ from 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 to the ground state 4I15/2. For the composite films integrated with NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals and AgNWs, the fluorescence intensity increases remarkably due to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) of AgNWs.28,40 The fluorescence enhancement factor of SF–AgNW–UCNP films compared to SF–UCNPs film is calculated to be 3.

Optical transmittance of SF–AgNW–UCNP films
Optical transmittance of the SF–AgNW–UCNP films is shown in Fig. 5. During the experiments, ITO–glass, ITO–polyethylene naphthalate (ITO–PEN) and pure SF films were chosen for comparison. Pure SF films display an excellent visible light transmittance of 90%, making it an ideally optical substrate.32 When the SF films are embedded with AgNWs and UCNP nanocrystals, the SF–AgNW–UCNP films display a transmittance of 80% in the visible light range, which is similar to ITO and higher than ITO–PEN, but weaker than pure SF films due to light absorption and reflection from the AgNW network.34

Conductivity and flexibility of SF–AgNW–UCNP films
The resistance of the SF–AgNW–UCNP films (13 Ω sq−1) as shown in Fig. 6 is comparable to the commercial ITO–PEN substrates (12 Ω sq−1). After the bending test was performed 100 times, the conductivity of SF–AgNW–UCNP films remains approximately constant at less than 20 Ω sq−1. But the conductivity of ITO–PEN increases to over 1000 Ω sq−1 after being bent just 10 times and over 18000 Ω sq−1 after being bent 100 times. The results show that SF–AgNW–UCNP films exhibit excellent flexibility and electrical conductivity properties.

Conclusions
In summary, freestanding silk fibroin (SF) films with metal-enhanced fluorescence behavior containing silver nanowires (AgNWs) and β-NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals were fabricated. The freestanding composite films exhibit a conductivity of 13 Ω sq−1 with a transparency of 80% and retain good conductivity after being bent for up to 100 times. Most importantly, the freestanding composite films show significant enhancement of upconversion fluorescence compared to SF–UCNP films without AgNWs. Furthermore, there is no need for post-treatment to introduce UCNPs into solar cells during subsequent device fabrication. Our work reveals that AgNWs not only form conductive networks used as transparent conductors,41 but also enhance upconversion fluorescence intensity through surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Since they are biocompatible, transparent, flexible and conductive, the freestanding composite films with metal-enhanced fluorescence behavior show potential applications in fabricating solar cells to power biomedical nanodevices such as cardiac pacemakers, biosensors and nanorobots.
