The synthesis is simple and no expensive metal catalyst is involved. All compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR and mass spectraometry. UV-Vis absorption spectra and B band-excited fluorescence emission spectra were also obtained. The synthesized porphyrins were applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Up to 3.05% conversion efficiency was realized for 3d under our experimental conditions, attributed to the two long alkoxyl chains present at the ortho positions of the meso-phenyl group. The influences of the position and the number of the alkoxyl chains at the macrocyclic meso-phenyl group on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs are well explained via DFT calculations. It was shown that the VOC and JSC of the sensitizers are determined by μnormal, ΔGinject and LHE.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC),1 which represent a new efficient light to electricity conversion technology, have been considered as a promising alternative to conventional silicon-based photovoltaic technologies. The key component of a DSSC is the dye sensitizers which anchor on the surface of a semiconductor, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2). Therefore, the properties of the dye molecules are critical in determining the cell performance and much effort has been devoted to the development of efficient dye sensitizers. Polypyridyl ruthenium complexes1–7 had been regarded as the most efficient sensitizers and an overall light to electric power conversion efficiency (η) of up to 11% was achieved by using N3-based DSSCs. However, since ruthenium is a rare metal, the high cost and the environmental issues caused by the production of ruthenium complexes limited their wide application. Therefore, development of simple and efficient dyes without metal or with cheap metals, such as Cu or Zn, is now an area of intensive investigation in DSSC research. Numerous organic dyes, such as coumarin,8–10 indoline,11,12 oligoene,13 thiophene,14–16 triarylamine,17–19 perylene,20–22 cyanine,23–25 emicyanine derivatives26,27 and porphyrins have been explored as potential sensitizers in DSSCs. Among them, porphyrins have become promising candidates used as sensitizers in DSSCs due to their vital roles in natural photosynthetic systems and strong absorption in the visible region, as well as readily tuneable optical, photophysical and electrochemical properties by peripheral substitutions.
To date, the most efficient porphyrin sensitizers feature push–pull structures. For example, a porphyrin-based DSSC was recently reported to reach η of over 12%, which is the highest η ever realized for DSSCs.28
However, preparation of push–pull type porphyrin sensitizers will require multistep synthesis. In particular, introducing the “push” and “pull” groups will normally employ expensive metal (Pd)-catalyzed C–C coupling reactions and C–N bond formation under strict reaction conditions, which will eventually increase the manufacturing cost of final cells. Therefore, production of simple and efficient porphyrin sensitizers still remains a challenge to address for the future practical application of porphyrin-based DSSCs.
Recently, Wang's group29 reported that utilization of natural chlorophyll-related porphyrins as cost-effective dye sensitizers in DSSCs achieved up to 2.9% conversion efficiency. More recently during the course of our studies on DSSCs using simple porphyrin sensitizers, He and co-workers30 published their results in the investigation of cost-effective DSSCs with a simple meso-acrylic acid substituted zinc porphyrin as a sensitizer; η of 5.1% was realized. However, preparation of monobromo-substituted porphyrin and subsequent Pd[0]-catalyzed Heck coupling to introduce the acrylic acid anchoring group will again increase the synthesis steps.
Herein, we want to report our preliminary findings in our studies on DSSCs based on simple porphyrin sensitizers. In this report, four simple trans-AB-porphyrins 3a–3d (Scheme 1) were designed and synthesized. The carboxylate anchoring group was introduced at the porphyrin synthesis stage. A benzene ring between the carboxylic acid and porphyrin ring functions as a spacer. The synthesis of these porphyrin-sensitizers is simple and no expensive metal is involved. Preliminary UV-Vis and fluorescence studies are presented in solution. The DSSCs based on these porphyrin sensitizers are fabricated and 3.05% conversion efficiency was achieved for porphyrin 3d under our unoptimized conditions, which suggested that porphyrin 3d is a promising candidate for DSSCs. Photovoltaic parametres (VOC and JSC) of the dyes were further investigated by theoretical calculation.

Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
It is well known28,31,32 that long alkoxyl chains attached to the phenyl ring at the meso position of the porphyrin core can increase the solubility of the resultant porphyrin-sensitizers. Furthermore, four alkoxyl chains at the ortho positions of two opposite meso-phenyl rings are believed to be able to wrap the porphyrin core and thus effectively reduce dye aggregation.33,34 Therefore, in our studies, porphyrin 3a without alkoxyl chain, porphyrin 3b, 3c with mono-alkoxyl chain at different (ortho and para) positions of the phenyl ring, and porphyrin 3d with bis-alkoxyl chains at the ortho positions of the phenyl ring were designed. The syntheses of porphyrins 3a–3d are shown in Scheme 1.
The four free base trans-AB-porphyrin dyes 1a–1d are readily accessible via MacDonald [2 + 2] porphyrin synthesis. Thus, dipyrromethane reacted with two different types of aromatic aldehydes leading to 2a–2d. The subsequent metalation by using Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and base hydrolysis afforded the zinc-porphyrin sensitizers 3a–3d.
The porphyrins 3a–3d were then fabricated into DSSC devices. The current–voltage results of the corresponding devices would also allow us to investigate how the position and the number of the alkoxyl chains affect the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.

The UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 1) of these compounds in solution exhibit the features typical of porphyrin rings, with an intense Soret band in the range 400–500 nm and less intense Q band in a range from 550 to 750 nm. They also show similar molar absorption coefficients in the spectra. For the fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2), major emission bands of 3a–3d are all found at ∼587 nm. No significant spectral shift was observed for the four dye molecules, which is similar to the Q band absorption pattern obtained in UV-Vis absorption spectra.
These results indicate that introducing alkoxyl chains at the macrocyclic meso-phenyl rings has no significant influence on the electronic properties of the porphyrin core. However, it was found that the fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) are slightly different between 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d. This result is probably due to the different number and positions of the alkoxyl chains present at the macrocyclic meso-phenyl ring for 3a–3d, which would determine the dihedral angle between the porphyrin core and the substituted meso-phenyl ring and the electronic effects of the substituent at the meso-phenyl ring (the electron-donating property of the alkoxyl group). It is known that those different dihedral angles35–37 and electronic effects38–40 could result in different conjugations between the porphyrin core and the substituted meso-phenyl ring, which would thus influence the fluorescence quantum yields for the dye molecules.
Next, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs incorporated with porphyrins 3a–3d and N719 were obtained under our experimental conditions, as shown in Fig. 3. The detailed cell fabrication and measurement procedures can be found in the ESI.† The relevant parameters are summarized in Table 2.

The overall efficiencies of the devices display a trend of increase from 3c (1.76%), 3b (1.95%), 3a (2.33%), to 3d (3.05%)41 with porphyrin 3d being the most efficient sensitizer. It was also found that the overall efficiency of 3d-sensitized solar cell has reached almost half of the cell performance of a N719-sensitized solar cell (6.84%) fabricated under the same experimental conditions. Interestingly, the overall efficiency of the simple porphyrin 3a-based solar cell is higher than those of the porphyrins 3b, 3c that contain a single alkoxyl chain at the macrocyclic meso-phenyl group. The porphyrin 3b with a single alkoxyl chain at the ortho position of the meso-phenyl substituent gave the poorest overall efficiency.
The highest overall conversion efficiency of 3.05% for 3d among porphyrins 3a–3d arises from the greater JSC and VOC obtained for porphyrin 3d than those for 3a–3c, which could be attributed to the two long alkoxyl chains present at the ortho positions of the meso-phenyl group. It is believed that the two long alkoxyl chains can partially wrap the porphyrin core, which will thus lead to the reduced dye aggregation and retarded charge recombination. The poor photovoltaic performance of 3c results from its lowest JSC value (4.03 mA cm−2) among 3a–3d.
DFT calculation and theoretical explanation
In order to gain insight into the electron distribution of the frontier and related orbitals, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. We adopted a simple porphyrin–TiO2 model (Fig. S1, ESI†) to simulate the interfacial interaction between dye and nanomaterial.42 The energy gaps between the HOMO − 1, HOMO and LUMO, LUMO + 1, were obtained, according to the four orbital model of Gouterman.43 Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the energy gaps and energy levels of the dyes and the dyes binding to TiO2. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the energy levels of the LUMOs for the dyes are all higher than that of the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles (∼4.2 eV).44 Thus, the electron transfer from the dye sensitizer to the semiconductor TiO2 will be kinetically favoured. It is also shown that the HOMO is located in the porphyrin ring, whereas the LUMO is delocalized to Ti atoms, suggesting a good electronic coupling between porphyrin and TiO2 nanoparticles.
From Fig. S1 (ESI†) it is clear that this series of dyes possesses similar energy gaps and energy levels. Therefore, to further understand how the position and the number of alkoxyl chains would affect the efficiencies of this series of dyes, a theoretical analysis of the characteristics of the newly developed dye molecules is needed.45

Eqn (1) is well known as the equation to calculate the efficiency of the solar cell. (1)Based on eqn (1), it is known that VOC and JSC are the vital factors to determine the performance of the dye in the device. The VOC of the DSSC can be determined by eqn (2),46 in which Ec is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor, Eredox is electrolyte Fermi-level, kT represents the thermal energy, nc is the number of electrons in the conduction band and NCB stands for the accessible density of conduction band states. (2)After the adsorption of the dye on the surface of TiO2, the shift of Ec is demonstrated as:47 (3)In eqn (3), q is the electron charge, μnormal represents dipole moment of the individual molecule vertical to the TiO2 surface and γ equals the concentration of the dyes on the surface. ε0 and ε are the permittivity of dyes under the vacuum and with dielectric monolayer. Based on the eqn (2) and (3), it can be obviously known that the dye with larger μnormal will enjoy the higher open-circuit voltage. Fig. 4 shows the μnormal values of this series of dyes. The sequence of the dipole moment of dyes is dye 3d(4.06) > dye 3a(2.24) > dye 3c(2.23) > dye 3b(2.09), which is in accordance with the sequence of open-circle voltage (dye 3d > dye 3a > dye 3c > dye 3b).
 Fig. 4  The dipole moment of dyes perpendicular to the surface of the TiO2. 
The dipole moment, which exerts an influence on the VOC value, is clearly influenced by the position and the number of the alkoxyl chains on the macrocyclic meso-phenyl group. The porphyrin 3d with two long alkoxyl chains at the ortho positions of the macrocyclic meso-phenyl group gives the largest μnormal value and thus, the VOC value of 3d is significantly higher than those of 3a–3c. A single alkoxyl chain at the ortho or the para position of the macrocyclic meso-phenyl group, as for 3b and 3c, has a small influence on the μnormal value according to the calculation results shown in Fig. 4 (compare the μnormal value of 3a with those of 3b and 3c); therefore, the VOC values for 3a–3c are similar.
Another significant parameter JSC is expressed by eqn (4): (4)In eqn (4), LHE is the light harvesting efficiency at the given oscillator strength. Φinject represents the efficiency of the injection and is proportional to the driving force of injection ΔGinject, which is determined by the equation ΔGinject = Edye − λmax − ECB. In the definition of ΔGinject, Edye is the vertical ionization potential of the dye on the ground state; λmax equals the vertical transition energy, and ECB represents the energy of the conduction band of the semiconductor. For the same structure of DSSC, the efficiency of collecting light (ηcollect) can be viewed as a constant. On the basis of eqn (4) and the above definitions, the relevant parameters were obtained and listed in Table 3.

It can be seen that the order of ΔGinject is consistent with that of the JSC value. Dye 3d, which possesses the largest ΔGinject and relatively high LHE, actually shows the highest JSC value. In contrast, dye 3c, which has the lowest LHE and relatively low ΔGinject, bears the lowest JSC. The four dyes possess similar LHE. So the main difference lies in the driving force. The larger driving force of injection means stronger capacity for donating electrons. Therefore, according to above results, it can be suggested that the capacity for donating electrons of the porphyrin can be improved by the presence of two alkoxyl chains at the macrocyclic meso-phenyl group.
The overall results obtained for VOC and JSC of 3a–3dvia DFT calculations are consistent with the values obtained from our experiment, which also provide a future direction for molecular design.
Conclusions
In our studies, four simple trans-AB-Zinc-porphyrin sensitizers were developed and applied in DSSCs. The synthesis of these sensitizers is simple. When applied in DSSC, dye 3d exhibits a η of 3.05%, which reaches almost half of the cell performance of a N719-sensitized solar cell (6.84%) under our unoptimized conditions, demonstrating its potential use for cost-effective dye-sensitized solar cells. The influences of the position and the number of the alkoxyl chains at the macrocyclic meso-phenyl group on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs are well explained via the DFT calculations. In the future, detailed studies on the photophysical and photoelectrochemical properties of the developed porphyrin sensitizers will be performed. Further performance improvement via optimizing the measurement conditions and modification of the molecules, such as introducing longer alkoxyl chains, is also in progress.
Experimental section
Materials and instrumentation
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. 2-Hexyloxybenzaldehyde, 4-hexyloxybenzaldehyde and 2,6-dihexyloxybenzaldehyde were prepared as previously reported.34,48 All chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (300–400 mesh or silica H). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AV 400 MHz spectrometer at 298 K. CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 was used as solvent and TMS as internal reference. The chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (δ) relative to the appropriate reference signal: residual chloroform (δH 7.26) or DMSO (the quintet centered at 2.50 ppm). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were measured on Bruker Autoflex Tof/Tof III instrument. UV-Vis spectra of the dyes in THF were detected on Shimadzu UV-1800 in 10 mm quartz cell spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer, and emission wavelengths λ are reported in nm.
Device fabrication
The TiO2 suspension was prepared using P25 following a literature procedure.1 The film was prepared by screen printing on a precleaned FTO glass. The film was then annealed at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. Finally the TiO2 film was treated with an aqueous TiCl4 solution (50 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with ethanol, and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After the film was cooled to 100 °C, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into the dye (3a–3d and N719) solutions (0.3 mM in ethanol) for 2.5 h. The sensitized electrode was then rinsed with ethanol, and dried. A sandwich cell consisting of the porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 electrode as the working electrode and a Pt foil as the counter electrode was fabricated. The electrolyte (0.06 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) was injected into the space between two electrodes. The irradiated area of the cell was 0.159 cm2. The photovoltaic measurements were then performed. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded on Keithley 2400 Source meter (solar AAA simulator, oriel China, calibrated with standard crystalline silicon solar). The dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes were irradiated under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The power conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC is calculated from short-circuit photocurrent (JSC), the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), the fill factor (FF) and the intensity of the incident light (Pin) according to eqn (5): (5)
Measurement of fluorescence quantum yield
Emission spectra were obtained from dilute THF solutions in 10 mm path length fluorescence cuvettes with Aλexc < 0.1. Quantum yields were determined by comparing the integrated corrected emission spectra to 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) whose quantum yield is well-known (0.11) in benzene.40 The main procedures are described as following.
1. Record the UV-Vis absorbance spectrum and note down the absorbance at the excitation wavelength (3a: 412 nm, 3b: 413 nm, 3c: 413 nm, 3d: 413 nm) to be used for five solutions with increasing concentrations of the chosen sample.
2. Record the fluorescence spectrum of the same solution in the 10 mm fluorescence cuvette (add to a solvent blank) from 550 to 750 nm using above recorded excitation wavelength for different dye molecules.
3. Calculate and plot a graph of integrated fluorescence intensity (that is, the area of the fluorescence spectrum) vs. absorbance. The fitting curves should be a straight line with gradient m and intercept = 0.
4. Finally, calculate the fluorescence quantum yield, according to eqn (6):49,50 (6)Where the subscripts s and t denote standard and test respectively, Φ is the fluorescence quantum yield, Grad the gradient from the plot of integrated fluorescence intensity vs. absorbance, and η the refractive index of the solvent.
DFT calculation method
All the computations were performed with the Gaussian 03 software package.51 Full ground geometry optimization of dyes 3a–3d was carried out by using hybrid functional B3LYP with basis set 6-31g(d, p), which has been proved to be suitable for the porphyrin and its analogues.52–56 Frequency calculations, which are used to calculate the total energy of molecules and check whether the geometries are lowest energy or not, are performed at the same level. However, the B3LYP always overestimated transition energy for this type of large conjugated energy when doing TDDFT calculation. To calculate the excitation state and redox potential, we employ the polarizable conducive model (PCM) to simulate the solvent effects of ethanol. According to the current research results, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional BP86 with the basis set 6-31+g(d, p) can make the computational results fit the experimental data well.57–62
Synthesis

General procedure for synthesis of 1. 
To a degassed solution of dipyrromethane (146.2 mg, 1 mmol), methyl 4-formylbenzoate (82.1 mg, 0.5 mmol), and aromatic aldehyde (0.5 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (100 ml) was added F3CCOOH (0.6 mmol, 44 μl). The mixture was stirred in the dark for 3 h and then DDQ (0.9 mmol, 200 mg) was added. After the solution was stirred at room temperature for another 1 h, Na2CO3 (106 mg, 1 mmol) was added and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The product was isolated by column chromatography (silica gel) using CH2Cl2–hexane = 1/2 as eluent. Recrystallization from CH2Cl2–CH3OH gave a red solid (0.05 mmol, 10%).

General procedure for synthesis of 2. 
To a solution of porphyrin 1 (1 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) was added a solution of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (283 mg, 1.29 mmol) in CH3OH (10 mL). After the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 0.5 h, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was extracted with CH2Cl2. The solvent was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and removed under reduced pressure. The product was recrystallized from CH2Cl2–CH3OH to give a red solid (0.95 mmol, 95%).

During the reviewing of this paper, some progress has been made for the improvement of the solar to electricity conversion efficiency (η) by using dye 3d as the sensitizer. Under our new experimental conditions (mainly by optimizing the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer), a η of 4.06% is reached. However, under these conditions, the cell performance of a N719-sensitized solar cell drops and the conversion efficiency is 6.52%. Further studies on optimizing the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer (for example, using different scattering layers) is still in progress.
