    , Accepted 6th December 2020First published on 9th December 2020AbstractIn this study, various Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3:0.5 at% Ho3+ (NBT:Ho) ceramics with different Yb3+ ion doping concentrations were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method. Under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser, the NBT:Ho sample exhibited four distinguished emission bands centered at 525, 548, 656, and 753 nm. By co-doping Yb3+ ions into NBT as the sensitizers, the up-conversion luminescence of Ho3+ ions was greatly enhanced. The mechanism for up-conversion luminescence was determined to be a two-photon absorption process. The DFT simulations revealed that the Ho3+ 4f orbitals pass through the Fermi level and thus f–f transitions could be highly sensitive to temperature variation. Green emissions at 525 and 548 nm were ascribed to the two thermally coupled excited states 5F4 and 5S2 transferring to the ground state 5I8, respectively. The temperature-dependent population between 5F4 and 5S2 could be interpreted by Boltzmann's distribution in the range of 167–377 K. The relative sensitivities were calculated to be 6.14% K−1 at 167 K and 1.03% K−1 at 377 K, and the corresponding absolute sensitivities were estimated to be 0.09 × 10−3 K−1 and 2.11 × 10−3 K−1, respectively. The temperature resolution was calculated to be about 0.053 K at 167 K and 0.319 K at 377 K. The excellent repeatability of the NBT:Ho3+ ceramics was demonstrated by means of successive heating–cooling cycles in the range of 167–377 K. The above investigation results demonstrate the promising application of NBT:Ho in cryogenic optical thermometers.
1. Introduction
Contrary to general down-conversion luminescent materials, which convert high energy light with short wavelength into low energy light with long wavelength through Stokes shift process, up-conversion materials absorb low energy photons to emit high energy radiation through sequential absorption of multiphoton mechanism, known as anti-Stokes shift process.1 This suggests that up-conversion luminescence generally exhibits visible and/or ultraviolet (UV) light emission from up-conversion materials under near-infrared (NIR) radiation. Due to their distinct luminescence properties, up-conversion materials have significant potential applications in medicinal chemistry, solar cells, fingerprint detection, displays and optoelectronic devices.2–5
The performance of up-conversion phosphors is highly dependent on the host material and doping activators thereof. Usually, the designed sensitizers are co-doped with activators to enhance the up-conversion luminescence efficiency and intensity. Lanthanide ions (Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+) with f-electron configurations are widely used as activators because of their ladder-like energy levels and long-lived metastable transitional excited states, which are good to uphold more population at low-energy excited states for the follow-up absorption of excitation energy and the further transition to higher energy levels. It is well known that Yb3+ ions are commonly used as sensitizers due to the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition possessing a large absorption cross-section for 980 nm NIR radiation as well as high energy transfer efficiency between the excitation states of Yb3+ ions and the metastable intermediate states of Ho3+, Er3+ and Tm3+ ions.6–10 So far, the inorganic host materials used for up-conversion luminescence are mainly fluorides, oxides, phosphates and titanates, among others.11–15 Generally, the lower the phonon energy of a host material, the fewer the multi-phonon relaxation or non-radiation transition processes of activators and sensitizers, and thus the higher the efficiency and intensity of up-conversion luminescence.16 Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT) is a promising lead-free piezoelectric material with a large remanent polarization of Pr ∼ 38 μC cm−2 and a high coercive field of Ec ∼ 73 kV cm−1.17 Impressively, NBT host features a relatively low phonon energy of 578.6 cm−1 compared with other oxides and potentially can be used as a host material for up-conversion luminescence.18 In 2007, Chen et al. reported strong green (550 nm) and red (670 nm) up-conversion emissions in Er3+-doped NBT ceramics for the first time.19 Du et al. found that the up-conversion luminescence performance of the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–0.01Er ceramic was significantly enhanced by electric poling.20 Jiang et al. revealed that doping Er3+ ions into NBT single crystal slightly decreases its dielectric permittivity, dielectric loss and transmittance, and that integrating up-conversion and piezoelectric properties allows it to be potentially used as a multifunctional device.12
Recently, optical temperature sensors based on up-conversion luminescence have drawn much attention. The optical thermometry mechanism is a fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique, which is carried out by determining the luminescence intensity ratio of two thermally coupled energy levels (with a gap less than 2000 cm−1) and is independent of the fluctuation of excitation intensity and the loss of light transmission.6,8 Researches focus on the improvement of sensitivity, which is defined as the slope of FIR vs. temperature plots. Du et al. reported that NBT:1 at% Er/1 at% Yb ceramic achieved a maximum sensitivity of about 0.0031 K−1 at 400 K based on FIR of 525 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 550 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) under 980 nm excitation.21 Du and his colleagues also found the effect of tri-doping Mo on the temperature sensing properties based on the same two thermally coupled levels (2H11/2, 4S3/2) of NBT:Er/Yb ceramics.16 Huang et al. clarified the up-conversion photoluminescence of NBT:xYb/yPr ceramics via 980 nm excitation and studied the temperature sensing properties by employing FIR of 525 nm (3P1 → 3H5) and 545 nm (3P0 → 3H5).22 Liu et al. reported up-conversion luminescence and electric properties of NBT-BT:Tm3+/Yb3+ ceramics, of which the temperature sensitivity based on FIR of 699 nm (3F2 → 3H6) and 665 nm (1G4 → 3F4) was calculated to be 0.0068 K−1.23 To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports on the up-conversion luminescence and optical temperature sensing properties of Ho3+ doped pure NBT ceramics.
In this work, a series of NBT:0.5 at% Ho ceramics doped with different concentrations of Yb3+ ions were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction. The Rietveld structure refinement by using the GSAS package and the first-principle simulation by using VASP were conducted to investigate the crystal structure, band structure and density of states. The up-conversion luminescence mechanism and energy transition process were studied in detail. Finally, optical thermometry based on the green up-conversion luminescence intensity ratio of 525 nm (5F4 → 5I8) to 548 nm (5S2 → 5I8) was investigated according to Boltzmann's distribution.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials and synthesis
A series of NBT:0.5 at% Ho,x at% Yb (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5) ceramics were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction. Anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, Aladdin 99.99%), bismuth oxide (Bi2O3, Macklin 99.99%), titanium dioxide (TiO2, Aladdin 99.99%), ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3, Hawk 99.99%) and holmium oxide (Ho2O3, Hawk 99.99%) were used as raw materials. The raw powders were weighed accurately according to the chemical stoichiometry and ball-milled for 24 h with a moderate amount of ethanol and zirconia grinding balls in a planetary milling machine. The resulting slurry was transferred to an oven at 60 °C for drying. Thereafter, the dried powder was grounded and pre-calcined in a muffle furnace at 900 °C for 2 h. After this, the calcined powder was re-grounded, pressed into discs with a diameter of 15 mm, and further sintered at 1100 °C for 6 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the prepared ceramics were characterized.
2.2 Characterization
The powder X-ray diffractive (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D8 Advance (Bruker, Germany) X-ray powder diffraction system using nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 10–80°, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Specifically, ceramics of NBT:0.5 at% Ho and NBT:0.5 at% Ho/0.9 at% Yb were grounded to fine powder and were measured in the 2θ range of 10–120° (step length: 0.02°) for the Rietveld refinement using the GSAS package. The morphologies and elemental surface analysis were simultaneously carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-IT500A) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was executed by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB Xi+). The absorption spectrum was recorded by a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi UH4150). The up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) spectra at room temperature were obtained by a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-7100) attached with a 980 nm laser (adjustable power up to 2 W). The UCPL at various temperatures (77–467 K) and cycling measurements were obtained with a steady state spectrometer (FLS 980, Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with a cryostat instrument (Oxford DN).
3. Results
3.1 Phase and morphology
X-Ray diffraction patterns of various Yb3+ doped NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ are shown in Fig. 1(a). With an increase in the Yb3+-doping concentration to 0.9 at%, all the diffraction peaks matched well with that of the pure trigonal NBT (JCPDS # 04-012-5540) and peaks at 38.5124° indicated that the space group is R3c.24 Meanwhile, when the Yb3+-doping concentration was further increased, the Yb-related heterophase Yb2TiO5 emerged and was identified by peaks at 30.5091°. The detailed crystal structure information of NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ and NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+, 0.9 at% Yb3+ was investigated by Rietveld refinement (2θ: 10°–120°) with GSAS, as shown in Fig. 1(b and c). All calculated peaks show good correlation with the experimental XRD patterns. Furthermore, the convergency factor Rp and residual variance factor Rwp are all less than 6%, confirming the phase purity of the as-prepared phosphors. The lattice parameters and refinement parameters are listed in Table 1. Generally, substitution of Bi3+ ions (1.08 Å) by Yb3+ ions (0.858 Å) leads to a lattice contraction. However, the results of Rietveld refinement show that when Yb3+ ions are co-doped into NBT:Ho3+, the lattice constants increase and so does the cell volume. This may be attributed to the low evaporation of Na+ ions (1.02 Å) caused by doping Yb3+ ions, resulting in a lattice expansion.25Fig. 1(d) presents the crystal structure of the NBT host, where the Ti4+ ion is coordinated by six O2− to form an octahedral structure, while one Bi3+ ion is surrounded by eight Ti–O octahedrons and forms an irregular octahedron with six vertex O2− ions. By introducing rare earth ions into the Bi3+ octahedral sites, lattice distortion due to radius mismatch exacerbates the symmetry of the crystal field for promising performance of luminescence centers.26

Fig. 2(a) and (b) display the SEM surface morphologies and the selected-area elemental mapping images of NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ and NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+,0.9 at% Yb3+ ceramics, respectively. The surface morphologies indicate that crystal grains with different sizes adhere to each other in the ceramic. Interestingly, the doping Yb3+ ions contribute to crystallinity optimization, grain growth and thus up-conversion luminescence enhancement for NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+. Besides, the elemental mapping images show that all the marked elements were distributed homogeneously and the dark mappings of Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions confirmed the relative low doping concentrations. Fig. 2(c) and (d) depict C 1s XPS spectra for NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+. The XPS survey spectra exhibited obvious signals of Na+, Bi3+, Ti4+, O2−, as well as a weak Ho3+ 5s signal located at 49.5 eV. These results indicate the existence of Na+, Bi3+, Ti4+, O2−, and Ho3+, and the absence of any other considerable ions in the NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ sample.

3.2 Absorption spectra
The normalized optical absorption spectra of pure NBT, NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+, and NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+,0.9 at% Yb3+ ceramic samples are shown in Fig. 3. There is a big data fluctuation at 800 nm due to the change in the light source of the instrument, but this did not affect the experimental results. For pure NBT, there is only one absorption peak at 392 nm, which is its intrinsic absorption. In case of NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+, the intrinsic absorption peak shifted to 378 nm, and the characteristic absorption peaks of Ho3+ ions located at 451 nm (5I8 → 5F1), 485 nm (5I8 → 5F3), 539 nm (5I8 → 5S2,5F4), 645 nm (5I8 → 5F5) and 1147 nm (5I8 → 5I6) appeared. It is worth noting that there is no obvious absorption peak around 980 nm, leading to weak up-conversion emission under the excitation of a 980 nm laser. By introducing 0.9 at% Yb3+ ions into NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+, a strong absorption peak near 980 nm arose due to the ground-state absorption of Yb3+ ions (2F7/2 → 2F5/2). Besides, the characteristic absorption peaks of Ho3+ ions were slightly increased, and the intrinsic absorption peak shifted to 380 nm. Therefore, doping Yb3+ ions is beneficial to enhance the up-conversion luminescence intensity and efficiency for NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+.

3.3 Band structure and density of states
In order to unveil the effect of doping Ho3+ ions on the band structure of the NBT host, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation of NBT:Ho was realized by using “Vienna ab initio simulation package” (VASP) code on a (3 × 3 × 1) NBT supercell, with the lattice parameters (a = b = 16.3842 Å, and c = 13.5352 Å). The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed for the DFT calculations. Besides, the ion–electron interaction was described by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. Fig. 4(a) provides the calculated electronic band structure of NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+, demonstrating the indirect band gap (2.457 eV) nature of NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+. In addition, the shadow band enveloping the Fermi level was composed of seven discrete topspin levels of Ho3+:[Xe]4f10. Besides, the shadow band was close to the valence band top with a 0.0554 eV gap, which is 2.125 eV away from the conduction band bottom. Fig. 4(b) shows the partial and total density of states for NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+. It was found that Ti4+ and Bi3+ ions make the main contribution to the conduction band, while O atoms make the most contribution to the valence band. The 4f orbitals of doped Ho3+ ions pass through the Fermi energy level. Along with the increase in the temperature, the relative position of Fermi level and Ho3+ 4f orbitals also showed variation. As we know, electrons near the Fermi level are sensitive to temperature variation. Therefore, Ho3+ 4f electrons, responsible for up-conversion luminescence, could be highly affected by the temperature variation even at low temperature range. As a result, effects of Ho3+ doped NBT phosphor on optical thermometry, especially for cryogenic temperatures, could be anticipated.

3.4 Up-conversion photoluminescence of NBT:Ho/Yb
The UCPL of Ho3+ single doped NBT samples are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that the emission intensities reach its maximum when the Ho3+ doping concentration was 0.5 at%. According to the absorption spectra displayed in Fig. 3, Yb3+ ions co-doped into NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ as sensitizers could enhance the absorption capability at 980 nm and thus improve the up-conversion luminescence as well. The up-conversion spectra of NBT:0.5 at% Ho/x at% Yb under the 980 nm laser irradiation (8.0 W cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5(a). Obviously, all the emission band profiles have almost no changes, but intensities varied with the Yb3+ ion concentration. The spectrum integral intensity relative to NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+vs. Yb3+ ion concentration is plotted in Fig. 5(b). It is noted that the luminescence of NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ without Yb3+ ions was almost invisible to the naked eyes under the 980 nm irradiation, as shown in the inset photos of Fig. 5(b). However, with the increase in Yb3+ ion concentration up to 1.1 at%, the up-conversion luminescence became brighter and the integral intensity increased by almost 128 times. Moreover, further increase in Yb3+ ion concentration reduced the integral intensity, which could be mainly ascribed to the concentration quenching effect ignoring the consequence of a little amount of Yb2TiO5 heterophase, as clarified in Fig. 1(a).

Going back to the spectra in Fig. 5(a), for NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ irradiated by the 980 nm source, there were two green emissions centered at 525 and 548 nm, one red emission centered at 656 nm, and one near-infrared emission centered at 753 nm. Similar up-conversion luminescence spectra have been reported in many Ho3+ ion doped materials, such as (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3, (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3–SrTiO3, CaBi4Ti4O15 and ZrO2,27–30 and the optical characterizations of green emissions are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Accordingly, the corresponding transitions for green, red and near-infrared emissions are Ho3+:5F4 → 5I8, 5S2 → 5I8, 5F5 → 5I8, and 5F4, 5S2 → 5I7, respectively. These transition processes could be interpreted by the schematic energy level diagrams of Ho3+ ions, as shown in Fig. 5(c). After absorbing energy from the 980 nm pump laser, Ho3+ ions at ground state 5I8 are excited to an intermediate state little higher than 5I6 and then quickly relax to the excited state 5I6. Ho3+ ions at 5I6 then transfer to a higher excited state 5F4 by either absorbing the pumping photons or cross relaxation (CR) process of 5I6 + 5I6 → 5I8 + 5F4. After this, a large proportion of Ho3+ ions at 5F4 relax to the lower state 5S2 for the strong 548 nm emission by further transferring to 5I8 and the remaining Ho3+ ions transfer to 5I8 for the weak 525 nm emission. Besides, the residual Ho3+ ions at 5F4 and 5S2 transfer to the excited state 5I7 for the weak 753 nm emission. As for the medium 656 nm emission associated with transition from 5F5 to 5I8, the population of 5F5 could be ascribed to the non-radiation (NR) process from 5F4 and 5S2 and absorption transition from the low excited state 5I7 populated by the NR process from 5I6. Interestingly, the emission at 525 nm in NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ could not be distinguished due to the doping of Yb3+ ions. In addition, along with the increase in the Yb3+ ion concentration to 9 at%, the whole emission peak intensity increased and widened, as well as shifted to the larger wavelength to a small extent, as shown by the inset in Fig. 5(a). This is because doping Yb3+ ions into the Bi3+ octahedral sites could further induce a lattice distortion and reduce the symmetry of the crystal field around the Ho3+ ion luminescence center. As a result, 5F4 and 5S2 levels of Ho3+ overlap to form an energy band, as shown in Fig. 5(d). Besides, through the energy transfer (ET) mechanism, the doping Yb3+ ions could assist the ground state absorption (GSA) and excited state absorption (ESA) processes to increase the population in the excited states, and therefore enhance the up-conversion luminescence.
To figure out the up-conversion luminescence mechanism, spectra of NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ and NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+/0.9 at% Yb3+ irradiated by the 980 nm laser at various pump power densities were obtained, as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (d), respectively. It can be seen that all the emission peak intensities increased along with the increase in pump power, while the profiles had no change except for the peak broadening. As is well known, the up-conversion luminescence intensity (I) and the pump power density (P) satisfy the following relation:31I ∝ Pnwhere n is the number of low energy (980 nm) photons absorbed by the UCPL process, which can be calculated by the slope of the fitted line of log(I) vs. log(P). Fig. 6(b) and (e) show the logarithmic curves of I vs. P. According to the linearity fitting results, n values are around 1.6 for samples either with or without doping Yb3+ ions, suggesting that the up-conversion luminescence of Ho3+ ions in the NBT host is a two-photon absorption process, which is in agreement with the above discussions on the energy level diagrams. Fig. 6(c) and (f) exhibit decay curves for the characteristic luminescence peaks of Ho3+ ions in NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ and NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+/0.9 at% Yb3+ on excitation with a 980 nm laser. All the decay curves could be well fitted to a single-exponential function expressed as below:32  where I0 is the initial intensity, I(t) is the intensity at time t, and τ is the decay lifetime of luminescence. Therefore, the τ values were found to be 82.8542, 51.8499, 38.5229 and 23.6322 μs for emissions at 525, 548, 656 and 753 nm in NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+, respectively. However, by co-doping Yb3+ ions, the τ values were increased to 113.5246, 153.2550 and 114.5133 μs for emissions at 548, 656 and 753 nm, respectively. These results confirm the energy transfer from Yb3+ ions to Ho3+ ions. In conclusion, the doping Yb3+ ions do not change the mechanism of up-conversion luminescence but assist the population of excited states through energy transfer to Ho3+ ions and thus enhance the luminescence intensity.

3.5 Optical thermometry of NBT:Ho

Fig. 7(a) shows the temperature-dependent up-conversion luminescence spectra of NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ under a 980 nm laser irradiation (14.4 W cm−2). The rise in temperature induced an increase in the full width at half maximum (FWHM), as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Besides, the relative intensity under different temperatures is plotted in Fig. 7(b). It obviously revealed that along with the increase in temperature, the UCPL intensities of green emission at 548 nm (Ho3+:5S2 → 5I8) and near-infrared emission at 753 nm (Ho3+:5F4,5S2 → 5I7) diminished on the whole, while the intensities of green emission at 525 nm (Ho3+:5F4 → 5I8) and red emission at 656 nm (Ho3+:5F5 → 5I8) first increased and then decreased. Particularly, the changes in the trend of 525 nm and 548 nm were opposite in the temperature range of 167–377 K. Also, the energy gap of the 5F4 and 5S2 excited states was calculated to be 799 cm−1 based on the spectra. Therefore, it is of interest to explore the potential of these two adjacent thermally coupled levels for a cryothermometer based on the 5F4 → 5I8/5S2 → 5I8 emission ratio. Accordingly, thermally coupled levels share population according to Boltzmann's distribution. Concretely, the higher energy level gains more population from the lower energy level as the temperature increases, leading to an enhancement in the high-energy irradiation and decline in the low-energy irradiation.29 In terms of Boltzmann's distribution, the FIR between the two green emission bands centered at 525 and 548 nm based on the two thermally coupled levels (5F4, 5S2) can be described as follows:8  where I, N, B, ΔE, k, and T are the integral luminescence intensity, the electron occupation number, a proportionality constant, the energy gap between 5F4 and 5S2 levels, the Boltzmann constant (0.695 K−1 cm−1), and the absolute temperature, respectively.

(e) Variation of absolute sensitivity (Sa) and relative sensitivity (Sr) as a function of temperature. (f) Thermal cycling measurement of FIR between 167 K and 377 K. 
As shown in the inset of Fig. 7(c), the FIR of I525/I548 increases with an increase in the temperature from 77 to 467 K. However, the plot could be well interpreted by the Boltzmann law in the temperature range of 167–377 K. As for temperatures lower than 167 K or higher than 377 K, the population of the excited states of 5F4 and 5S2 could be disturbed by the transition process to 5I7 for 753 nm irradiation (5F4, 5S2 → 5I7), the relaxation process to 5F5 for 656 nm irradiation (5F5 → 5I8), cross relaxation process from 5I6 to 5I8 and 5F4, and the phonon-induced relaxation process between the two thermal-coupled levels, leading to a swing from Boltzmann equilibration.33 According to the fitting results, the energy gap ΔE was calculated to be 1023.74 cm−1 with a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.99801. The range of linearity of the Arrhenius plot indicated that the Boltzmann distribution could effectively describe the thermometer's behavior from 377 K down to 167 K, as shown in Fig. 7(c).
Generally, the temperature response or sensitivity is a critical parameter to evaluate the performance of a thermometer. The relative sensitivity (Sr) is a figure of merit for comparing the performances of different thermometers. The absolute sensitivity (Sa) gives information about the variation of temperature, which could be discriminated. Accordingly, the Sa and Sr are expressed as:34    
Another important parameter to assess the performance of a cryothermometer is the temperature uncertainty δT, which can be described as:35  Fig. 7(d) and (e) exhibit the temperature dependence of δT, Sa and Sr, respectively. At 167 K, the Sr, Sa and δT were calculated to be 6.14% K−1, 0.09 × 10−3 K−1, and 0.053 K, respectively. However, when the temperature was increased up to 377 K, the Sr, Sa and δT were estimated to be 1.03% K−1, 2.11 × 10−3 K−1 and 0.319 K. Furthermore, the high repeatability of the NBT:Ho3+ ceramics was evaluated and demonstrated by means of four successive heating–cooling cycles in the range of 167–377 K, as presented in Fig. 7(f). These outstanding sensitivity, uncertainty and repeatability values are far superior than that of the previously reported Ho3+ ion doped up-conversion materials, as shown in Table 2. In conclusion, it is anticipated that NBT:Ho3+ could be used for optical cryo-thermometry.

The CIE chromaticity coordinates of NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ excited by a 980 nm laser at different temperatures were calculated based on the spectra in Fig. 7(a) and are displayed in Fig. 8. The CIE coordinates were (0.3633, 0.6570) at 77 K and (0.4011, 0.5845) at 467 K, and the emitting colors evolute from green to yellow-green along with a temperature increase from 77 to 467 K. As a result, this temperature-dependent color emitting behavior could be used as a safety sign in low-temperature environment due to the high sensitivity of green light to human eyes.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, various Yb3+ doped NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ ceramics were fabricated by the solid-state reaction method. Under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser, NBT:0.5 at% Ho3+ exhibited four distinguished emission bands centered at 525, 548, 656, and 753 nm. With the Yb3+-doping concentration lower than 0.9 at%, all the samples were pure trigonal NBT with the space group of R3c. The doping Yb3+ ions contributed to crystallinity optimization, enhanced the absorption capability at 980 nm, and promoted the up-conversion luminescence. All the up-conversion luminescence was determined to be a two-photon absorption process. With the structural parameters obtained by the Rietveld refinement, the DFT simulation revealed that the Ho3+ 4f orbitals pass through the Fermi level and thus f–f transitions could be highly sensitive to temperature variation. The population between the two thermally coupled levels 5F4 and 5S2 could be interpreted by Boltzmann's law in the range of 167–377 K. Based on the temperature-dependent FIR of I525/I548 (5F4 → 5I8/5S2 → 5I8), the Sr was calculated to be 6.14% K−1 at 167 K and 1.03% K−1 at 377 K, and the corresponding Sa was estimated to be 0.09 × 10−3 K−1 and 2.11 × 10−3 K−1, respectively. The temperature resolution increased from 0.053 K to 0.319 K along with the change in temperature from 167 K to 377 K. According to the thermal cycling measurement of FIR between 167 K and 377 K, the excellent repeatability of NBT:Ho was demonstrated. The results suggested that the green up-conversion NBT:Ho phosphors could be promising candidates for cryogenic optical thermometers.
