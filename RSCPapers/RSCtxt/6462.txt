    , Accepted 13th November 2022First published on 18th November 2022AbstractDeveloping thickness-insensitive interface layers is still a challenge for meeting the requirements of large-scale production of high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we have prepared the solution-processed and thickness-insensitive MoOx hole transport layers (HTLs) with n-doping strategy. Two reducing agents with different volatility, i.e. volatile hydrazine hydrate (HH) and non-volatile glucose (GLC), were introduced as n-type dopants in precursor solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (AHM). It is confirmed that Mo(VI) is partially reduced to Mo(V) due to the n-doping effect in both of the MoOx films prepared from the AHM:HH and AHM:GLC precursor solutions. Electrical conductivities of both the AHM:HH and AHM:GLC films are significantly increased after optimization. Benefitting from the improved conductivity of the AHM:HH HTLs and the matched energy level alignments, the resultant devices demonstrate superior photovoltaic performance and outstanding tolerance to the AHM:HH thickness variation. When the AHM:HH HTL thickness is increased from 10 to 150 nm, the efficiency of resultant device is merely decreased about 10%. The devices based on the 150 nm-thick AHM:HH HTLs still offer a PCE of 14.35%, among the highest values for the OSCs with over 100 nm-thick HTLs reported to date.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn world-wide attention since they are low-cost, flexible and compatible with large-area solution-processed manufacturing, enabling them as a promising renewable energy technology.1–4 In the past several years, OSCs have developed rapidly and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was boosted from approximately 10% to 19% benefitting from the development of novel donor and acceptor materials as well as the optimization of device engineering.5–10 In addition to the contribution of organic photovoltaic materials for the efficient photovoltaic conversion, the charge transport layers inserted between the electrodes and active layer also play an important role in efficient charge extraction by tuning the work function of the electrodes, minimizing the energy barriers and reducing the interfacial recombination.11–14 However, state-of-the-art OSCs usually achieved high PCEs with quite thin hole/electron transport layers (HTLs/ETLs) (∼5–40 nm) and the photovoltaic performance would decay significantly with further increase of the interlayer thicknesses.15–17 The lack of thickness tolerance is unfavourable for large scale manufacturing of PSCs since it is quite difficult to fabricate such thin and uniform high-quality films by high-throughput solution-processing technologies. Considerable efforts have recently been devoted to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs with thick active layers.18,19 Nevertheless, high-efficiency devices based on thick charge transport layers are rarely reported. It is particularly essential to develop thickness-insensitive interface layers applicable for large-scale manufacturing of high-performance OSCs.20
With regard to the ETL materials, the research on HTL materials is still rare to date.21 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most commonly used HTL material in conventional structure OSCs due to its high conductivity and superior solution processability.22–24 Nevertheless, in the view of device stability, PEDOT:PSS and its derivatives have their inherent acidic, corrosive and hygroscopic characteristics, which may lead to physical and chemical degradation of the OSCs.25,26 Several transition metal oxides, such as nickel oxide (NiOx), vanadium oxide (V2O5) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx), have been investigated as HTL materials owing to their excellent optical and electrical characteristics.27–31 Among them, MoOx possesses superior hole extracting/electron blocking properties and has been widely utilized as HTLs in inverted OSCs. However, some drawbacks still limit its practical application in solution-processed OSCs. Firstly, MoOx films prepared by thermal evaporation under high vacuum with a strictly controlled deposition speed is not suitable for the large-area solution-processed OSCs.32,33 Secondly, due to its relatively low hole mobility, the MoOx layers should be relatively thin and almost no more than 10 nm, otherwise it would result in seriously decreased fill factor (FF) of the OSCs.34–36 It is still a challenge to develop solution-processed MoOx HTLs for OSCs that can work efficiently under thick film condition.35–37 On the other hand, n-type doping has been revealed as a potential method to enhance the conductivity of MoOx HTLs.29,38–41 Ma et al. found light illumination-induced transformation of Mo(VI) to Mo(V) and n-doping in the HMoO3 precursor nanoparticles, which leads to the increased conductivity of the solution-processed MoOx film and comparable efficiency of OSCs to the control device based on the evaporated MoO3 HTL.41
We herein report a kind of solution-processed and thickness-insensitive MoOx HTLs by n-doping the precursor solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (AHM). Two kinds of reducing agents with different volatility are used as n-doping dopants, i.e. volatile hydrazine hydrate (HH) and non-volatile glucose (GLC), respectively. The n-type doping effect is confirmed in the resultant MoOx films with Mo(VI) being partially reduced to Mo(V) by adding the two kinds of dopants and meanwhile the work function (WF) of the two films is decreased from −5.64 eV of the as-pristine film to −5.27 eV and −5.43 eV, respectively. The MoOx films prepared with the two doped precursor solutions exhibit increased conductivity as compared to the as-pristine MoOx film. The AHM:HH and AHM:GLC films are used as HTLs in OSCs based on the PM6:N3 active layer. An optimal PCE of 15.92% is achieved in the OSCs with 10 nm-thick AHM:HH HTLs. More importantly, the OSCs can maintain almost 90% of its maximum PCE with the AHM:HH HTL thickness increased to 150 nm, which still delivers a considerable PCE of 14.35% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.84 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.21 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 70.88%. This is one of the highest efficiencies reported for the OSCs with over 100 nm-thick HTL. However, for the devices with the AHM:GLC HTLs, the JSC is decreased greatly when the AHM:GLC HTL thickness is increased to 150 nm. These results indicate that the AHM:HH film is an excellent thickness-insensitive HTL and provide a simple but valuable method to prepare thick HTLs for high-efficiency OSCs.
Results and discussion
The preparation procedure of MoOx HTLs in this work is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The mixed precursor solutions of AHM doped with/without the reducing agent (HH or GLC) were spin-coated on ITO glass substrates followed by thermal annealing at 180 °C for 20 min to obtain the n-doped MoOx films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were employed to confirm the n-doping effects in the resultant MoOx films and the results are shown in Fig. 1(b and c). For the as-pristine MoOx film made from the AHM precursor solution, the Mo 3d core level exhibits two symmetric peaks with binding energies of 235.85 and 232.70 eV for the Mo 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 band respectively, which are well consistent with the values of Mo(VI) in thermally evaporated MoO3.42 It indicates that the as-pristine AHM film only possesses Mo(VI) species and consists mostly of MoO3. For the AHM:HH films with HH being introduced as a reductant, an obvious shift to low energy region is observed for both 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 bands that are centred at 235.70 and 232.55 eV, respectively. Similar phenomenon is also found in AHM:GLC films and the Mo 3d doublet peaks locate at 235.70 and 232.55 eV. These results imply that Mo(VI) was partially reduced to Mo(V) species by HH or GLC n-type dopants, which might increase the charge carrier density and improve the electronic properties of the resultant MoOx films.43

(c) UPS curves in the Fermi edge and the secondary edge region of the MoOx films prepared from the AHM, AHM:HH and AHM:GLC precursor solutions, respectively. 
UPS spectra were measured to estimate the charge extraction capability of the AHM, AHM:HH and AHM:GLC films. Base on the UPS spectra shown in Fig. 1(c), the work functions can be calculated by the equation below:44,45φ = hv − (Ecutoff − Eonset)where φ is the absolute value of work function, hv is 21.22 eV, the excitation energy of He used for the UPS measurement, Ecutoff and Eonset are the cutoff and onset energies of the UPS spectra. The full UPS spectra are given in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The AHM film has a work function of −5.64 eV, and the values decrease to −5.27 and −5.43 eV for the AHM:HH and AHM:GLC films, respectively. The decreased work functions can be attributed to the occurrence of n-doping effect via reduction reaction, which is consistent with the XPS results. Compared to the as-pristine AHM film, the AHM:HH and AHM:GLC films with lower work functions could reduce the energy offset between the polymer donors and ITO electrodes and help to facilitate hole extraction in OSCs.
The morphologies of the AHM-based films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the images are presented in Fig. 2. Compared to the as-pristine AHM film, the addition of a small amount of HH (AHM:HH = 8:1 and 4:1, w/w) does not change the film morphologies and a quite smooth surface is obtained in the AHM:HH films. As the ratio of AHM:HH is increased to 2:3, some large aggregates are presented in the film, which could be ascribed to the alkaline nature of HH reducing the solubility of AHM in the solutions. When the neutral GLC was used as n-type dopants, in contrast, all the films with different AHM:GLC ratios show uniform surfaces and no significant aggregation is observed.

The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of devices with a structure of ITO/AHM, AHM:HH or AHM:GLC (150 nm)/Al were measured to investigate the electrical properties of the AHM-based films. As shown in Fig. 3(a and c), the I–V curves of all the devices demonstrate linear relationship implying the Ohmic contact behaviour between the electrode and the various AHM layer. The direct current conductivity (σ) of the AHM-based films can be estimated from the I–V curves with the equation of I = σAd−1V, where A is the device area and d is the thickness of the AHM-based films.46 As shown in Fig. 3(b), the calculated conductivity of the AHM:HH films gradually increase with the HH concentration due to the n-doping effect. When the AHM:HH ratio is increased to 4:1, the resultant film exhibits the highest conductivity of 3.73 × 10−5 S cm−1, which is almost 40% higher than 2.72 × 10−5 S cm−1 of the neat AHM film. Further increase of the HH content causes the decreased conductivity that is probably ascribed to the morphology change in the resultant film. In the case of the AHM:GLC films as shown in Fig. 3(d), the highest conductivity of 3.70 × 10−5 S cm−1 is achieved with a AHM:GLC ratio of 8:1 and the conductivity decreases rapidly with a higher GLC content. Since all the AHM:GLC films show smooth morphologies, the decreased conductivity of AHM:GLC films may be originated from the insulated property of non-volatile GLC, which remains in the resultant films even after thermal annealing at 180 °C and impedes the hole transport.

In addition to the charge-transport properties, the optical transmittance should be also considered for the interface layers used in OSCs. The transmission spectra of the pure AHM, AHM:HH (4:1, w/w) and AHM:GLC (8:1, w/w) films and their thickness dependence of transmittance at 550 nm are given in Fig. S2 (ESI†). All the AHM-based films exhibit high transmittance in the visible region and the transmittance is gradually lowered with increasing the thicknesses. In the case of pure AHM films, even though its thickness is increased to 150 nm, the transmission is still over 92% enabling efficient photon absorption of the active layers in OSCs. Compared to the corresponding AHM films, the doped AHM:HH films demonstrate slightly decreased transmission especially in the range of 600–1000 nm due to increased absorption, which further proves the existence of n-doping effects.41 As for the AHM:GLC films, the significantly decreased transmittance with increased thickness is probably ascribed to the amino-carbonyl reaction occurred between the non-volatile GLC and ammonium molybdate during thermal annealing processes at 180 °C. Finally, the 150 nm-thick AHM:GLC film attains merely a transmittance of 75% at 550 nm, which would reduce the efficient absorption of the active layers when it was used as HTLs in conventional OSCs.
Since they demonstrate both high conductivity and uniform film morphology, the AHM:HH (4:1) and AHM:GLC (8:1) films were selected to serve as the HTLs in the OSCs with a conventional structure of ITO/HTL/active layer/PFN-Br/Al as shown in Fig. 4(c). The control device based on the pure AHM HTL was also prepared for comparison study. The polymer PM6 and small molecule N3 were used as electron donor and acceptor, respectively, and PFN-Br was used as an electron-transport layer. The chemical structures of these materials are shown in Fig. 4(a). The energy level diagram of ITO, PM6, N3 and various HTLs are shown in Fig. 4(b), where the work function of pure AHM, AHM:HH (4:1) and AHM:GLC (8:1) was calculated from UPS as mentioned above.

The OSCs with the different AHM-based HTLs were fabricated. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1–S3 (ESI†) for the OSCs with thickness-varied AHM, AHM:HH (4:1) and AHM:GLC (8:1), respectively. Fig. 5 shows the J–V and EQE curves of the devices with 10 nm-thick and 150 nm-thick HTLs and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 1. It is shown in Fig. 5(a) that all the devices with 10 nm-thick HTLs exhibit high JSC values indicating excellent hole extraction capability of the thin AHM, AHM:HH (4:1) and AHM:GLC (8:1) films. The device with 10 nm-thick pure AHM film as the HTL attains a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 25.62 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69.03%, delivering a PCE of 14.53%. A higher PCE of 15.92% is achieved for the OSCs based on 10 nm-thick AHM:HH HTL. The improved photovoltaic performance is mainly originated from the slightly increased VOC and FF, which can be attributed to the matched energy level and the enhanced conductivity of the AHM:HH HTLs. Similarly, the device based on the 10 nm-thick AHM:GLC HTL also delivers a considerable PCE of 15.94% with a VOC of 0.83 V and a FF of 73.91%. However, when the HTL thickness is increased to 150 nm, the photovoltaic performance of resultant devices is quite different as shown in Fig. 5(b). The device based on 150 nm AHM HTL gives a significantly decreased PCE of 8.29%, which is mainly limited by a low FF and JSC, being attributed to the weak charge collection ability of the thick AHM HTL to result in severe charge recombination. On the contrary, the OSC based 150 nm-thick AHM:HH HTL achieves a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 24.21 mA cm−2, a FF of 70.88% and a final PCE of 14.25%, which remains 90% of its maximum value. It is worth noting that the devices based on 150 nm-thick AHM:GLC HTL show a significantly declined JSC of 21.42 mA cm−2 and finally a decreased PCE of 12.60%. It may be ascribed to the decreased transmittance of the thick AHM:GLC film limiting the efficient light absorption of the active layer.

EQE spectra of the devices with 10 nm and 150 nm HTLs are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively. All the devices based on 10 nm-thick HTLs exhibit similarly high EQE in the whole range of 350–900 nm, indicating excellent hole extraction abilities of the thin AHM-based films. However, the EQE of the devices based on 150 nm-thick HTLs are changed very much due to the different optical and electrical properties of HTLs. The EQE value of the device with 150 nm-thick AHM HTL is significantly decreased with comparison to the control device with 10 nm-thick AHM HTL. However, the device based on 150 nm-thick AHM:HH film demonstrates a slightly reduction in EQE spectra owing to their high conductivity of the n-doped AHM:HH film. In the case of the device with 150 nm-thick AHM:GLC HTL, the EQE diminishes dramatically due to the increased absorption of AHM:GLC HTL as mentioned above, which is consistent with the low JSC value measured from the J–V curve.
The detailed photovoltaic parameter changes of the OSCs based on different HTLs as a function of HTL thickness are plotted in Fig. 6. For the OSCs with different type of HTLs, the VOC shows no significant changes with increasing the HTL thickness. The introduction of HH and GLC in AHM precursor solution really increases the VOC of the resultant OSCs. For the OSCs with pure AHM as HTL, both JSC and FF decrease rapidly resulting in significant reduction of PCE. However, the AHM:HH-based devices exhibit almost unchanged FF and slowly decreased JSC values with the HTL thickness increasing from 10 nm to 150 nm, which may be attributed to the enhanced hole-transport capability as well as the high transmittance of the AHM:HH films. Even if the AHM:HH thickness is increased to 150 nm, the PCE of the resultant device slightly decreases to 14.35%. It confirms that the addition of volatile reductant HH in AHM precursor solution can effectively improve the thickness tolerance of the resultant MoOx HTL and facilitate the high-performance OSCs with thick HTLs. When non-volatile GLC is used as reducing agent in AHM precursor solution, FF values of the OSCs are also slightly decreased with the AHM:GLC thickness due to the high conductivity of the resultant MoOx HTLs. However, the JSC is decreased with the AHM:GLC thickness due to its increased absorption in the visible region, and finally leads to the relatively low PCE in OSCs with thick AHM:GLC HTLs.

The charge dissociation and collection status in the OSCs with 10 nm and 150 nm HTLs were further investigated and the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on effective voltage (Veff) were plotted in Fig. 7. Jph is given by JL–JD, where JL and JD are the illuminated current density under 100 mW cm−2 and the dark current density, respectively. Veff is defined as V0–V, where V0 is the voltage at Jph being 0, and V is the applied bias voltage.47 For all the devices, Jph increases sharply with the Veff in the low effective voltage region and reaches saturation current (Jsat) at Veff ≥2.0 V, where all of the photogenerated excitons are assumed to be separated into free carriers and be effectively collected by the respective electrodes. The exciton dissociation (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) given in Table 2 were estimated from Jph/Jsat at short-circuit condition and at the maximal power point, respectively. It is seen that all the devices based on 10 nm or 150 nm HTLs exhibit similar ηdiss. Whereas, the ηcoll are 86.94%, 88.72%, and 86.23% for the devices with 10 nm HTLs of pure AHM, AHM:HH (4:1) and AHM:GLC (8:1), respectively, implying the efficient charge extraction capability of the resultant thin MoOx films. The calculated ηcoll drops to 79.94% in the 150 nm AHM-based device while the ηcoll of the 150 nm AHM:HH (4:1) and AHM:GLC (8:1) devices are still kept at 86.07% and 84.76%, respectively. The improved ηcoll in AHM:HH and AHM:GLC-based devices is attributed to the enhanced conductivity of the n-doped MoOx films.

The dependence of VOC and JSC on the illuminated light intensity (Plight) was measured to estimate the charge recombination status of the OSCs with 10 nm and 150 nm HTLs. The relationship between JSC and Plight can be described as JSC ∝ (Plight)α, where α is the power-law exponent that represents the extent of bimolecular recombination.48 As shown in Fig. 7(c) and Table 2, the α values are 0.979, 0.983 and 0.979 for the devices with 10 nm-thick HTLs of pure AHM, AHM:HH (4:1) and AHM:GLC (8:1), respectively, indicating the bimolecular recombination is nearly negligible in the three devices. With increasing the HTL thickness to 150 nm, the AHM:HH (4:1)-based device exhibits the highest α value of 0.980, in which the suppressed bimolecular recombination is consistent with the enhanced hole extraction capability. The slope of VOCversus the natural logarithm of Plight was given as nkT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature in Kelvin, and q the elementary charge.48 For the devices based on 10 nm-thick HTLs, the slopes are almost equal to kT/q, indicating negligible trap-assisted recombination in these OSCs. However, the slopes are 1.26, 1.16 and 1.25 kT/q for the devices with 150 nm HTL of pure AHM, AHM:HH and AHM:GLC devices, respectively. The trap-assisted charge recombination is effectively suppressed in the OSCs with 150 nm-thick AHM:HH HTL. These results reveal the introduction of volatile n-dopant HH in AHM precursor solution produces superior MoOx HTLs that can facilitate charge collection even under thick film condition leading to improved JSC and FF. In terms of the AHM:GLC films, the insulated GLC residual in the resultant MoOx film would result in JSC loss due to its noticeable absorption in the visible region.
Conclusion
In summary, we have prepared a kind of solution-processed MoOx HTLs for high efficiency OSCs by using n-doping strategy. The MoOx layer can be readily prepared from the AHM precursor solutions doped with n-type dopants HH and GLC. Both the AHM:HH and AHM:GLC films demonstrate enhanced conductivity since the Mo(VI) is partially reduced to Mo(V) to form the n-doped MoOx. The work functions of the resultant n-doped MoOx are decreased from −5.64 eV to −5.27 eV and −5.43 eV for the AHM:HH and AHM:GLC-based films, respectively. Due to the improved hole extraction capability as well as the matched energy level alignments, the OSCs based on AHM:HH HTLs demonstrate high photovoltaic performance and excellent tolerance to the HTL thickness variation. The OSC based on 10 nm-thick AHM:HH HTL obtains an optimal PCE of 15.92%. Moreover, the OSC with 150 nm-thick AHM:HH still achieves a remarkable PCE of 14.25%, about 90% of the maximum value. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest efficiencies for the OSCs with over 100 nm-thick HTLs. In the case of the OSCs with 150 nm-thick AHM:GLC HTL, though a high FF is still achieved, the limited JSC due to noticeable absorption of AHM:GLC decreases the PCE of the resultant OSCs. This work provides a simple and viable method to prepare solution-processed and thickness-insensitive MoOx HTLs that may be compatible with large-scale production of high-performance OSCs.
Experimental
Materials
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) were purchased from Heraeus Materials Technology Germany. Ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (AHM) was bought from Sigma-Aldrich. PFN-Br and PM6 were obtained from Solarmer Material Inc. The acceptor material N3 was purchased from Yirou Photovoltaic Technology Co. Ltd. Hydrazine hydrate (80%, H4N2·H2O) and glucose (GLC) were bought from Xilong Scientific Co. Ltd. Chloroform (CF) was obtained from Xilong Scientific Co. Ltd. Chloronaphthalene (CN) was purchased from TCI Shanghai. All the materials and solvents were used without further purification.
Device fabrication
The OSCs in this work were fabricated with a conventional architecture of ITO/HTL/PM6:N3/PFN-Br/Al. The ITO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 7 Ω per square were subjected to ultrasonic cleaning sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The cleaned ITO glasses were then cleaned with O2 plasma treatment for 3 min. AHM precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving AHM and HH (or GLC) in water at different weight ratios and stirred for 30 min. Then the precursor solutions were spin-coated on the ITO glass substrate at different speed followed by thermal annealing at 180 °C to form MoOx HTLs with different thickness. Then, the samples were moved into a glove box to spin-coat the active layer and ETL. The PM6:N3 blend solution in CF (1:1.2 in weight, 17.6 mg mL−1) was stirred at 60 °C for 30 min and 0.8 vol % CN was added into the solution. The PM6:N3 solution was spin-coated onto the various MoOx HTLs to produce the active layer and then the samples were annealed at 90 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, PFN-Br solution in menthol (0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the Al cathode was thermally deposited with a shadow mask in a vacuum chamber. The active area of a cell was ca. 8 mm2.
Measurement and characterization
The XPS and UPS measurements were carried out on ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific. USA). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained on Philips XL-30 ESEM FEG SEM FEI. The transmittance spectroscopy was measured on an Agilent Cary 60 spectrophotometer. Illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated solar light. The EQE of the devices was measured on spectral response measurement system (Enlitech QE-R).
