    , Accepted 27th July 2012First published on 22nd August 2012AbstractThis work reports a facile and cost-effective method for synthesizing photoactive α-Fe2O3 films as well as their performances when used as photoanodes for water oxidation. Transparent α-Fe2O3 mesoporous films were fabricated by template-directed sol–gel chemistry coupled with the dip-coating approach, followed by annealing at various temperatures from 350 °C to 750 °C in air. α-Fe2O3 films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, XPS, FE-SEM and electrochemical measurements. The photoelectrochemical performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes was characterized and optimized through the deposition of Co-based co-catalysts via different methods (impregnation, electro-deposition and photo-electro-deposition). Interestingly, the resulting hematite films heat-treated at relatively low temperature (500 °C), and therefore devoid of any extrinsic dopant, achieve light-driven water oxidation under near-to-neutral (pH = 8) aqueous conditions after decoration with a Co catalyst. The onset potential is 0.75 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), thus corresponding to 450 mV light-induced underpotential, although modest photocurrent density values (40 μA cm−2) are obtained below 1.23 V vs. RHE. These new materials with a very large interfacial area in contact with the electrolyte and allowing for a high loading of water oxidation catalysts open new avenues for the optimization of photo-electrochemical water splitting.
A. Introduction
Because of a steadily worldwide increasing demand and of the anticipated shortage of fossil fuels, energy supply will be one of the greatest challenges of this century. This entails the exploitation of carbon-neutral energy sources such as solar energy. Solar energy harnessing, while attainable at correct efficiencies through photovoltaics, has the drawback of only being available during the day. Conversion of sunlight to a form of usable and storable fuel remains a formidable challenge.1 The production of a fuel such as hydrogen through water splitting utilizing only fully renewable resources such as water and photons is an appealing solution to durably store large amounts of energy.2 For short and mid-term development, the basic approach consisting in coupling photovoltaic cells with electrolyzers is mature with an overall solar-to-hydrogen (STH) yield of 18%.3 However, H2 production directly from sunlight at the interface of semi-conductor materials in a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) would be an ideal long-term solution because such an integrated device will be cheaper to fabricate and superior in terms of STH yield.4,5
Newly developed materials and techniques show promise for solar H2 production although no sustainable and cost-effective solution to the problem has been identified yet. Recent achievements have been reported regarding the design of H2-evolving photocathode materials.5–9 Semiconductor metal oxides such as WO3,10–13 α-Fe2O3 (hematite),14–17 BiVO418–22 or combinations of these materials23,24 which absorb part of the visible solar spectrum have been investigated as photoanode materials. Hematite in particular has received much attention due to excellent chemical stability, high natural abundance of iron and low cost. Its favorable optical band gap of ∼2.2 eV theoretically allows a STH efficiency of 12.9%.25 Experimental STH efficiency is practically much lower due to the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity of hematite26 resulting in short lifetime of photo-generated charge carriers (≤10 ps)27,28 and the short hole diffusion length (∼2–4 nm).29 Additionally surface valence band holes are kinetically inefficient for multielectronic water-oxidation, making non-productive recombination processes more competitive.30,31 To overcome these limitations, different synthesis approaches have been explored in order to design nanostructured layers.16,32–36 Indeed, a very large interfacial area between an electrolyte and a semiconductor facilitates the charge collection by shortening the diffusion length for photo-excited holes. Among the different techniques explored, the atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD)16 and the atomic layer deposition (ALD)15 have led to materials with excellent photoelectrochemical water splitting performances. For example, an increase in the plateau photocurrent has been observed for the dentritic α-Fe2O3 films synthesized via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD).16 Nano-rods/wire arrays,34–37 nanonets14,38 or porous colloid-based32,39–41 films are other very attractive morphologies for enabling a high photon harvesting efficiency. However, these syntheses approaches need specific and/or costly instruments such as atomizers, chemical vapor deposition or spray-pyrolysis systems and use toxic and flammable metal–organic precursors. Developing facile, safe, and cost-effective methods to synthesize nanostructured α-Fe2O3 films is then highly desirable.
Hematite has been mainly considered so far in the literature as a photocatalyst for water oxidation under strongly alkaline conditions.15 Near-to-neutral conditions however appear relevant in the perspective of assembling a complete PEC cell.42 In such a device, the hematite photoanode material, whose conduction band potential is positive to the equilibrium potential for H2 evolution, will be associated with another semi-conducting material (or a p–n junction) that will provide the additional voltage required for H2 evolution.4,43 Such semi-conducting materials are not likely to withstand alkaline conditions; this is particularly true for silicon-based materials as recently emphasized by Nocera et al.42 Second, there have been major advances in recent years for the design of both H2 and O2-evolving catalysts working under near-to-neutral conditions and with low overpotentials44 while only few have been optimized under strongly alkaline conditions. We also note that alkaline conditions are rather favorable when considering water oxidation, which is at the expense of H2 evolution facilitated at lower pH. Therefore, the search for new materials displaying PEC properties for water oxidation at near-to-neutral pH values is key for future developments.
We report here a facile, cost-effective and versatile method to fabricate nanostructured α-Fe2O3 thin films. These films were synthesized through the “sol–gel” chemistry combined with the dip-coating approach. To create pores, a thermostable template was added to the sol–gel solution. After depositing the hybrid organic–inorganic films, various treatments under air are used to tune the crystallinity, the size of particles and pores or the thickness of the films and to optimize PEC performances. Compared to spray-pyrolysis, APCVD or ALD methods, the proposed method avoids the use of expensive equipment and metal–organic precursors. When combined with cobalt-based water-oxidation catalysts this new material displays promising activity for light-driven water oxidation under near-to-neutral aqueous conditions (pH = 8) with an onset potential of 0.75 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), thus corresponding to 450 mV photo-potential or light-induced underpotential and current densities reaching 40 μA cm−2.
B. Experimental section
Chemical
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (99.99% purity) and ethanol (EtOH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, polyisobutylene–polyethyleneoxide (PIB-b-PEO; reference P4973-ibEO: MWPIB = 7000 g mol−1, MWPEO = 8500 g mol−1) was purchased from Specific Polymer. All the chemical reagents used in the experiments were obtained from commercial sources as guaranteed-grade reagents and used without further purification.
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated substrates were commercial. Two different FTO substrates were used: SOLEMS, YSUB/ASAHI120/1 (10 × 30 mm) and SOLARONIX-48205 (2.2 mm, 5 × 5 cm). The last sample is described as a thin FTO layer deposited on a quartz support that allows heat-treatment at high temperature. FTO-coated quartz substrates have been used for samples with heat treatments above 600 °C.
Solution
100 mg of PIB-b-PEO was dissolved in a mixture of 5.6 g EtOH and 0.4 g H2O by careful heating to 70 °C for 1 hour. After cooling for several minutes, 0.8 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was added and the acidity of solution was controlled by adding 0.5 g of HNO3 in order to avoid the formation of iron hydroxide or oxyhydroxide. Then, the solution was stirred for 48 h. The resulting clear solution was used to produce thin films via dip-coating.
Films synthesis
Dip-coating was performed at a relatively low humidity (≤20%) and at 70 °C. The FTO substrates were dip-coated into the sol solution and withdrawn with a speed of 3.5 mm s−1; this procedure produced hybrid films of about 200 nm thickness. The films were calcined directly at various temperatures (350 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C) for 60 min or 750 °C for 30 min in air. Multi-layers (up to 5 layers) were also prepared in order to increase the thickness of the α-Fe2O3 mesoporous films. In this case, the hybrid organic–inorganic films were only heat-treated at the desired-temperature for 5 min for stabilization. After cooling, a new layer was deposited by setting the same experimental conditions. This process was repeated until reaching the desired number of layers. Finally, the multilayer films were treated at the final temperature as described above to form pores and to crystallize the particles within the inorganic walls.
Characterization
The thickness (h) and the refractive index (n) of optical films were measured by ellipsometry under UV-visible light at variable angles.45,46 Thermal ellipsometry analysis was performed between 80 and 500 °C to determine the most adequate heat-treatment for the transformation of the hybrid organic–inorganic film into a crystalline mesoporous films.
Measurements were performed in the wavelength range of 400 to 900 nm, using a covered heating unit connected and monitored by a programmable temperature regulator. The thermocouple regulator was directly in contact with the sample. After dip-coating, the as-prepared hybrid organic–inorganic films deposited onto silicon wafer were heated at 80 °C for 10 minutes inside the covered heating unit, just before analysis measurements. Data analysis was performed with Wvase32 software, where ellipsometric Ψ and Δ angle plots were fitted using a single Lorentz oscillator layer model with one oscillator with center energy fixed at zero and other with free center energy in the UV-visible domain.
The microstructures of the films obtained after different heat treatments were observed by Field Emission (FE) Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi).
The crystalline structure of the mesoporous Fe2O3 films was determined using a prototype X-ray diffractometer equipped with a curved position sensitive detector (120°, Inel). A fixed-incidence monochromatic CoKα impinging parallel beam is obtained by reflection on a flat Ge(111) crystal. Cobalt radiation was used instead of the more usual copper radiation to avoid sample fluorescence. The beam cross section was 0.05 × 6 mm2, producing a rectangular 3 × 6 mm2 beam footprint on the sample at a fixed incidence of 1°. At this incidence, the attenuation length inside the hematite sample is about 0.7 μm. The grazing incidence diffraction patterns (0° < 2θ < 120°, Δ2θ = 0.015°, α = 1) were refined using the Rietveld software XND.47,48 The broadening components related to finite crystallite size and microstrain were determined after taking into account the specific corrections for the instrumental broadening related to the grazing incidence setup.49
XPS spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer operated at 350 W using standard Al radiation. The pressure was below 5 × 10−8 Pa. The spectrometer was calibrated by assuming the binding energy of the Au4f7/2 line to be at 83.4 eV relative to the Fermi level. The reported BEs were corrected to account for the charging effects by assigning the BE value of 284.6 eV to the C1s line of carbon; carbon was present as contamination in the outer layers. Mesoporous films were introduced into the XPS chamber using a fast entry lock system. The peaks were assigned using the NIST XPS database.50
Photo-electro-chemical measurements
Photocurrent measurements were performed in a specific cell with a flat glass window and three compartments. A three-electrode configuration has been systematically used. The hematite-coated FTO/glass or FTO/quartz sample has been connected to a brass wire thanks to a silver conducting paint (Radiospare) and the connection covered by electrolytic tape (polyimide, Hi-bond HB830). This sample is used as the working electrode. A Pt wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl/KCl 3 mol L−1 (hereafter denoted Ag/AgCl, E0(Ag/AgCl) = 0.21 V vs. NHE) have been used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively, and placed in distinct compartments separated from the main compartment by glass frits. The distances between the electrodes are small, and ohmic losses can be neglected. We used potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 mol L−1, pH = 8) and NaOH (1 mol L−1, pH = 13) as electrolytes. The hematite electrode was scanned at 5 mV s−1. The potential is reported relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode potential (RHE) whose potential is defined as E(RHE) = −0.059 pH. Thus potentials measured versus the Ag/AgCl electrode can be converted versus the RHE by using the following formula: Evs. RHE = Evs. Ag/AgCl + E0(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 pH. The Ag/AgCl reference electrode has been calibrated in the above described experimental setup using the [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− couple in phosphate buffer. (E([Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4−) = 0.20 V vs. Ag/AgCl in KPi buffer at pH = 7).51
The samples were illuminated with a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel, ozone free) operated at 280 W coupled to a water-filled Spectra-Physics 6123NS liquid filter for elimination of IR radiation, a Spectra-Physics 59472 UV cut-off filter (λ > 400 nm) and a 0.5 cm2 circular mask. Irradiance at the substrate surface was measured to 600 mW/cm2 (∼6 sun) thanks to a Coherent PowerMax-USB PM150-50C Power Sensor.
Quantification of evolved O2 has been done with a Perkin-Elmer Clarus 500 gas chromatograph equipped with a porapack Q 80/100 column (6′ 1/8′′) thermostated at 40 °C and a TCD detector thermostated at 100 °C.
Co(II)-impregnation was done by dipping the mesoporous α-Fe2O3 thin films in a Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution (10 mmol L−1) solution for 1 hour. The Co-α-Fe2O3 thin film is then washed with deionized water and dried prior to photoelectrochemical measurement. We found that performing this impregnation procedure three times yields optimized photocatalytic performances.
Electro-assisted deposition of O2-Cocat (or Co–Pi)52,53 was done in a three-electrode setup where Pt mesh was used as a counter-electrode, mesoporous α-Fe2O3 thin films as a working electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. The electrolyte solution contained 0.5 mmol L−1 Co(NO3)2·6H2O in a 0.1 M potassium phosphate (KPi, pH 7) buffer, as described elsewhere for the preparation of a similar composite photoanode.54–56 Deposition was achieved at 0.90 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 500 s corresponding to 3 mC cm−2 passing through the electrode.
Photo-electro-assisted deposition of O2-Cocat was as described above for the electro-assisted deposition procedure except that the sample was illuminated and poised at 0.40 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 750 s. Higher current densities (150 μA cm−2) are obtained under these conditions corresponding to 6 C cm−2 passing through the electrode.54,57
Quantum efficiency measurements have been carried out according the setup illustrated in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Light from a xenon lamp (Lot Oriel LSN555) passing through a monochromator (Spectra-Physics Cornerstone 130) is used to illuminate the photoelectrode from 300 to 800 nm with a rectangular spot of 10 nm spectral width. The photocurrent response as a function of the applied potential was measured with a potentiostat (PAR 263A). The optical power arriving on the sample has been previously measured (Newport 1830-C) behind a strip similar to the cell window and a correction was applied to take into account the glass/liquid interface encountered by the optical beam under the real conditions of voltage–current measurements. The curve in Fig. S11 (ESI†) represents the optical power vs. wavelength used to determine samples' IPCEs.
C. Results
Nanostructured α-Fe2O3 thin films were prepared onto FTO-coated glass substrates via the dip-coating approach from sol–gel solutions. These solutions consisted of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in a mixture of ethanol and water containing polyisobutylene–polyethyleneoxide (PIB-b-PEO) organized in spherical micelles (∼20 nm, estimated from Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) measurement, see Fig. S1, ESI†).
High temperature annealing of the hybrid organic–inorganic films is then required to obtain a crystalline material with an open porosity network. We thus studied the thermal behaviour of the hybrid organic–inorganic Fe2O3 films through thermoellipsometry analysis (TEA, Fig. 1) in order to propose the adequate heat-treatment that (i) keeps the organization of pores defined by the organization of the template in the hybrid organic–inorganic films and (ii) allows the crystallization of the inorganic walls. The ellipsometric data, tan(Ψ) and cos(Δ), were fitted with the Lorentz Oscillator model and the thickness (h), the real (n) and imaginary (k) parts of the complex refractive index of the films were evaluated. The variation of the film thickness as a function of the temperature is reported in Fig. 1 (see Fig. S2, ESI† for refractive index). The derivate of the Fe2O3 thin film thickness curve exhibits four main peaks, related to various phenomena. The first peak at low temperature corresponds to small variations of the thickness. This step can be attributed to the evaporation of residual solvents such as H2O and EtOH. Between 150 °C and 220 °C, a variation of both the thickness and refractive index is observed and corresponds to the decomposition of both PEO and PIB blocks to CO, CO2 gases. Between 300 °C and 400 °C, a lower decrease of the thickness (∼13.6%) with the temperature appears, due to the crystallization of Fe2O3 nanocrystallites (nucleation-growth), in agreement with XRD investigations that show the presence of hematite peaks on X-ray diffraction patterns for 400 °C-calcined films. The decomposition of the different blocks thus occurs prior to the crystallization of Fe2O3 at around 400 °C. At higher temperatures collapse of the mesostructure occurs since the size of the nanoparticles becomes similar to the size of the inorganic walls of the pore-solid architecture. During the heat-treatment under air, the film thickness evolves from 220 to 270 nm. This is due to the decomposition of the organic components and the crystallization of the inorganic wall. Note that the film thickness of one-layer mesoporous films heat-treated at 500 °C has also been evaluated by FE-SEM analyses and the value is comparable to the one estimated from ellipsometry, within the experimental errors.
 Fig. 1  Thermoellipsometry analysis (10 °C min−1) of the hybrid organic–inorganic films: variation of the thickness (dark blue) and derivate of the thickness (red) as functions of the temperature. The films were initially stabilized at 80 °C. 
The as-synthesized films are transparent after different heat treatments from 350 °C to 750 °C. Note that only a dwelling time of 0.5 h at 750 °C (instead of 1 h at lower temperatures) was used to limit the degradation of the FTO layer. At 500 °C, the resulting films are red-orange, transparent (Fig. 2a) and exhibit the crystalline structure characteristic of the hematite α-Fe2O3 single phase (JCPDS 33-0664) as shown in Fig. 2b.

The ex situ X-ray diffraction analyses performed on samples heat-treated at 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C and 750 °C confirmed the presence of the hematite single phase. In contrast, the films heat-treated below 300 °C are amorphous. Rietveld refinements of the grazing incidence diffraction patterns measured on the mesoporous thin films show that the hematite structure is stoichiometric within the experimental errors. The profile modeling includes instrumental, crystallite size and strain broadening. The crystallite size of α-Fe2O3 was determined (see Table S1, ESI†) and it increases with the temperature. The crystallite size is about ∼14 nm at 400 °C and becomes two times larger at 500 °C (∼30 nm). While no microstrain is observed at low temperature, this broadening component becomes significant at 500 °C and above, witnessing a possible change of the contacts between the nanocrystals during the annealing of the mesoporous films. This effect was already observed in NiO-CGO mesoporous composites.58 Indeed, FE-SEM micrographs show that films heat-treated up to 500 °C maintain the pore-solid architectures formed during the self-assembly of the template into the organic–inorganic films (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  SEM images collected for α-Fe2O3 thin films heat-treated at 500 (top left) and 750 °C (top right) in air. Cross-section of a 5-layer mesoporous hematite film heat-treated at 750 °C (∼230 nm) (bottom center). 
In contrast, upon heating the films up to 750 °C, re-organization of pores is observed, followed by an increase of both particles size (as seen by X-ray diffraction) and neck size between particles (as seen by FE-SEM micrographs, Fig. 3).
The heat treatment has also an obvious effect on the color of the film (Fig. 4a). Mesoporous films heat-treated below 300 °C appeared yellow compared to the red films obtained after annealing at higher temperatures. The UV-visible spectra of hematite films display a broad absorption band extending to 600 nm with a maximum at 400 nm. The transitions at ∼400 nm and ∼550 nm have been previously assigned to ligand field 6A1 → 4E and a ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition 6t1u↓ → 2t2g↓, respectively.59 The optical properties of the multilayer mesoporous films treated at 500 °C for 1 hour (Fig. 4b) have been also investigated. As expected, the intensity of the absorption spectra increases as the thickness of the mesoporous films increases (Fig. 4c). FE-SEM indicates that the 5-layer mesoporous α-Fe2O3 films heat-treated at 750 °C exhibit a thickness of ∼250–300 nm (Fig. 3, bottom center).

The photoelectrochemical performances of the 5-layer mesoporous films have been first evaluated under the conditions classically used in the literature (1 mol L−1 NaOH aqueous solution, pH 13). Samples treated at temperatures above 600 °C displayed a significant photoelectrochemical response when assayed in such an alkaline electrolyte. Photocurrent values of up to 0.3 mA cm−2 could be measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE for 5 layer mesoporous films heated to 750 °C (Fig. 5, black traces and Fig. S6, ESI†). A plateau at 0.54 mA cm−2 was then observed at more positive potentials. For films heat-treated at 750 °C, we found that an impregnation with a Co(II) solution shifts the polarization curve towards more positive potentials (∼100 mV, Fig. 5, blue trace) as previously described for samples annealed at 800 °C and evaluated under similar alkaline conditions.16
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent density vs. applied potential (j–V) plots recorded at 5 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH (black, pH 13) and 0.1 KPi buffer (red, pH = 8) in the dark (dashed) and under illumination (plain) for pristine 750 °C heat-treated 5-layer mesoporous films. The photocatalytic response (pH = 13) of the 5-layer mesoporous films heat-treated at 750 °C and modified by Co-impregnation is shown as a blue trace. 
More interestingly, we also explored the photoelectrocatalytic properties of the 5-layer mesoporous films in phosphate buffer (pH = 8; 0.1 mol L−1). Under these conditions, significant photocurrent densities were only observed for films treated at 750 °C and the current density value measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE was smaller (0.15 mA cm−2, Fig. 5, red traces and Fig. S7, ESI†). When the 5-layer mesoporous films heat-treated at 750 °C were impregnated with Co(II) solution, no improvement of PEC performances could be measured.
The measured photocurrent for 5-layer mesoporous films heat-treated at 750 °C is comparable to values reported in the literature in which only films annealed at similarly high temperature, (usually 800 °C) exhibit high photocurrent. The photocurrent value observed at the plateau compares well with the 0.56 mA cm−2 value reported under similar conditions by Sivula et al. for hematite films prepared by a solution-based colloidal method and displaying a very similar morphology.32 However, it is known32,60 that elevated sintering temperatures cause the Sn4+ ions to migrate from the FTO substrate to the α-Fe2O3 film where they act as electron donating substitution impurities and enhance the electronic conductivity. Actually the X-ray photoelectron spectrum recorded in the thickness of our mesoporous α-Fe2O3 films heat treated above 600 °C (see Fig. S1, ESI†) displays new peaks at 487 and 495 eV attributed to the 4d and 3d binding energies of Sn.
With the aim to evaluate the impact of the nanostructure on the PEC performance, we then focused on the PEC properties of 5-layer samples heat-treated at 500 °C. Indeed, these samples retained the pore-solid architecture created during the assembly of the template into the hybrid organic–inorganic films. As very small photocurrents were observed for such films, we evaluated their PEC activity in the presence of cobalt-based electrocatalysts in phosphate buffer (pH = 8; 0.1 mol L−1). Fig. 6 shows that simple impregnation of the hematite sample with a Co(II) salt improves the photocurrent. Under such conditions, the onset of the photocatalytic wave was observed at 800 mV vs. RHE (plain red trace). The photocurrent plateaued at a value of ∼40 μA cm−2 for potential values more positive than ∼1 V vs. RHE. For comparison, dark O2 evolution catalyzed by the deposited cobalt ions (dotted red trace) is observed with an onset potential of 1.6 V vs. RHE.

Chronoamperometric measurements were then carried out at applied potentials of 1.03 vs. RHE with sequential dark and illumination periods for pristine and Co-impregnated hematite films. In these studies, the experiment was performed at high bias (1.03 V/RHE) in phosphate buffer with and without a catalyst. The transient photocurrent response is shown in Fig. 7 with very reproducible values after several cycles. As previously described, photocurrent transients were observed when light is switched on and off. The anodic transients are assigned to the charging of the hematite/electrolyte interface capacitance while steady-state photocurrent corresponds to sustained catalytic O2-evolution.26,61 As previously described, cathodic transient currents correspond to the reduction of surface trapped holes.61

A faradic yield for water oxidation close to unity (0.9 ± 0.2) could be measured during a long irradiation period (30 min) through the gas chromatographic quantification of O2 accumulated in the headspace gas of the cell.
We then investigated other strategies to decorate the photoelectrode surface with the cobalt-oxide catalyst (O2-CoCat) developed by D. Nocera.52,53Fig. 8 compares the PEC response of a photoanode modified through impregnation with cobalt nitrate (black trace) with those of electrodes on which O2-CoCat has been deposited either electrochemically (red trace)54–56 or photo-electrochemically (blue trace) as initially described by Gamelin et al.54,57

Buffer 0.1 M KPi (pH = 8). 
Clearly, the electro and photo-electrochemical methods both lead to a decrease of the light-driven O2-evolution onset potential values as compared to the impregnation method. In both cases, the presence of O2-CoCat is evidenced by the wave with onset potential at ∼1.5 V vs. RHE and corresponding to O2 evolution on the linear voltammograms recorded both in the dark and under irradiation (Fig. 8; Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). We note that the photo-electrochemical deposition method allows for a higher O2-CoCat activity at potentials more positive than 1.5 V vs. RHE as compared to electrodeposited material. This can arise for a photo-electrodeposition process occurring within the porous 3D network of the material while electrodeposition mainly proceeds at the external electrode/electrolyte interface. In contrast comparable photocurrent values are measured in the plateau region whatever the deposition method. The small variations observed are within the experimental errors at the level of the synthesis of the mesostructured films and the decoration of the surface of the mesostructured films.
The incident photon to current efficiency (quantum efficiency) measured in KPi (pH 8) buffer at 1.0 V vs. RHE (plateau region) is shown as a function of wavelength in Fig. 9. IPCE values decrease from 25% at 300 nm to 0% at 600 nm, reproducing previously reported IPCE data.17,41,62,63 The same IPCE values are obtained at 1.23 V vs. RHE. We could also measure similar quantum efficiencies on mesoporous hematite films on which Co-based electrocatalysts were deposited using the three above-mentioned methods. This is consistent with the fact that similar photocurrents are measured under white light irradiation (Fig. 8).

D. Discussion
Mesoporous hematite films heat-treated at 750 °C exhibit high photocurrents under strongly alkaline conditions. Such a high activity is due to the doping of the hematite film by Sn ions from the FTO substrate during sintering and is perfectly reproduced in our samples synthesized via the sol–gel process after annealing at 750 °C (Fig. 5). Additionally, upon heating the particle–particle contact is much larger, improving the electronic conductivity throughout the nanoarchitecture. The addition of cobalt-based surface catalysts leads to a small shift of the photocurrent response towards more positive potentials. The PEC responses of these films are significantly lower when assayed at pH = 8. This contrasts with the previous report from Zhong and Gamelin on Si-doped hematite deposited through APCVD,55 which, to the best of our knowledge, is the only PEC study carried out on Co-modified hematite under near-to-neutral conditions.
In this study, we focused on such near-to-neutral conditions that deserve further investigation in the context of the fabrication of a full PEC cell. To the best of our knowledge, the only other studies carried out at neutral pH are from Hamann et al. and concern unmodified ALD deposited hematite.64,65 Similarly to those ALD synthesized films, our mesoporous films treated at rather low temperature (<500 °C) do not contain extrinsic dopant elements that usually improve the PEC efficiency of the hematite photoanode.17,26,60,66,67 Importantly, the use of an organic template in the “sol–gel” chemistry combined with the dip-coating process allows the formation of nanostructured films composed of nanocrystallites of α-Fe2O3 organized in a porous 3-D network. The utilization of low sintering temperatures allows the retention of the nanoarchitecture induced by the organic template with two advantages: on one hand, the material displays an extended electrode/electrolyte interface which leads to high loading of deposited electro-catalysts; on the other hand, the thickness of the inorganic walls is small which allows holes to reach the surface, where catalysis could occur, before experiencing bulk recombination.
We observed that in this case the decoration of hematite with electrocatalysts has a marked effect on the photocurrent associated with water oxidation. While the pristine hematite samples show only marginal properties for light-driven water oxidation, we could show that decorating the surface of 5-layer mesoporous films heated at 500 °C with cobalt-based electrocatalysts triggers the appearance of a photocatalytic wave with 750 mV vs. RHE onset potential and ∼40 μA cm−2 plateau photocurrent density (pH = 8, 0.1 M KPi buffer). We note that the onset potential for the PEC response observed here is significantly more negative than the one reported by Hamann et al. at neutral pH for unmodified ALD-prepared hematite samples. This clearly states that the addition of the electrocatalyst reduces the electron–hole recombination through the consumption of the holes for O2 evolution at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The photocurrent value measured at the plateau does not depend on the deposition method used (impregnation with Co(II) ions and electro or photo-electrodeposition of O2-CoCat),54 which speaks for the PEC performances in this region not to be limited by surface catalysis but to be controlled by light absorption, charge generation and transport within hematite. The very high surface area of our mesoporous samples and the resulting high loading of the electrocatalysts provide a rationale for such a behavior. Overall these results show that when the mesostructured films exhibit low electronic conductivity, the decoration of the nanoarchitecture with O2-evolving catalysts results in higher photocurrent values.
In addition to water oxidation catalyzed at Co sites, two distinct roles of the catalytic layer have been formulated in the recent literature: (i) the cobalt-based layer selectively extracts photogenerated holes, preventing them from recombining with photogenerated electrons staying in the hematite phase; (ii) the cobalt-layer and hematite form a Schottky-type heterojunction, which expands the depletion layer within hematite due to an increase of the band bending and reduces the density of electrons at the interface between both materials, thus expanding the lifetime of photogenerated holes in hematite.68 However, the last hypothesis has been drawn from measurements on samples sintered at high temperature and assayed under strongly alkaline conditions. Such conditions are not optimal conditions for O2-CoCat, which (i) may have a distinct composition at high pH and (ii) requires surrounding phosphate anions as electron relays, to catalyze water oxidation. Fig. 7 clearly shows how the presence of the cobalt-based electrocatalysts sustains photocurrent at constant values depending on the potential (28, 26 and 10 mA cm−2 at 1.23, 1.10 and 0.9 V vs. RHE respectively) through the efficient utilization of photogenerated holes for achieving water oxidation. Switching light on and off gives rise to anodic and cathodic transients, the shape of which depends on applied potential and light intensity are observed, as previously observed in the literature.19
Further studies are thus needed to determine the mechanism at work in the case of the present study.
E. Conclusions
Here we have shown that nanostructured hematite films can be synthesized through sol–gel chemistry if the sintering process is kept at relatively mild temperature. These materials, combined with various Co-based electrocatalysts, display photoelectrocatalytic activity under near-to-neutral conditions which has been rarely investigated so far surprisingly. Importantly, these films display one of the most positive onset potential for PEC water oxidation among other reported hematite-based materials corresponding to 450 mV light-induced underpotential with regard to thermodynamics. We are currently investigating the modification of the electronic conductivity of these mesostructured hematite films through anionic (F) and cationic (Nb, Si, Ti…) doping in order to increase the plateau photocurrents. The sol–gel approach will permit us to preserve the 3-D nanoarchitecture, thus keeping the advantage of having an extended electrode/electrolyte interface on which catalysts can be loaded to increase the performances of the photoanode.
