    , Accepted 14th September 2017First published on 14th September 2017AbstractPhotocatalytic overall splitting of H2O into H2 and O2 using Z-scheme systems is a promising method for solar hydrogen generation. Most currently designed Z-scheme systems are usually based on precious metal cocatalyst modified semiconductor photocatalysts, thus exploiting noble-metal-free cocatalysts to replace precious metals is of huge interest. Herein, a noble-metal-free Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system was constructed by using MoS2/CdS as the H2 evolution photocatalyst, Co3O4/BiVO4 as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst and a [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple as an electron mediator under visible light irradiation. It is found that the H2 and O2 evolution rates are approximate to an ideal ratio of 2:1, and the highest H2 and O2 evolution rates under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) are found to be 14.5 and 7.1 μmol h−1, respectively, with an excellent stability exceeding 12 h. The apparent quantum yield reaches up to 1.04% at wavelength λ = 420 nm even without any noble metal. The excellent stability and efficiency of this designed Z-scheme system in neutral water demonstrate its potential use for solar hydrogen generation. This work provides a noble-metal-free approach to construct the Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system.
Introduction
The conversion of solar energy into hydrogen fuel via artificial photosynthesis represents a promising strategy to address the looming energy crisis and environmental problems.1–5 However, owing to the complexity involved in the 4-electron transfer process, the photocatalytic overall water splitting is hard to occur kinetically. In the field of solar hydrogen generation, the photocatalytic overall water splitting process is usually addressed as two separated half-reactions, water reduction to evolve H2 and water oxidation to produce O2.6–10 In these water reduction/oxidation half-reaction systems, the other half-reaction was replaced by a sacrificial reductant and oxidizer, respectively. During the past four decades, considerable effort has been devoted to studying these half-reactions in detail, including the operation, kinetic analysis, and charge transfer of photocatalysts and providing valuable insight into the reaction mechanism for photocatalytic water reduction and oxidation reactions.11–20 The high apparent quantum yield obtained in both water reduction and oxidation half-reaction systems indicates that the essential components are already in hand for constructing the photocatalytic overall water splitting system, at least at the proof-of-concept level.
Despite much progress being made in the field of both water reduction and water oxidation half-reactions, the design of an efficient overall water splitting system is still a huge challenge. To date, two main types of photocatalytic overall water splitting systems have been explored. The first approach is based on a semiconductor photocatalyst which has suitable potential to achieve overall water splitting.21–25 It can be accepted that most of the previously reported H2-evolution semiconductor photocatalysts have suitable thermodynamic potentials for overall water splitting, but they were inactive in practical applications owing to the poor separation of photogenerated charge. Loading of both H2 evolution reaction and O2 evolution reaction cocatalysts on semiconductor photocatalysts is an efficient strategy to inhibit the recombination of charge carriers,21,22 but the quantum efficiency is still low. The second approach is a Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system, inspired by natural photosynthesis.26–31 The Z-scheme system that typically consists of a H2 evolution photocatalyst (HEP), an O2 evolution photocatalyst (OEP) and an electron mediator is an efficient method to convert solar energy to H2 fuel. To this end, many HEPs (such as Pt/SrTiO3,32 SrTiO3:La,Rh,33 LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N,34 CaFe2O4,35 Pt/metal sulfide,36 Pt/TaON,37 Pt/Ta3N5,38etc.), OEPs (Mo:BiVO4,26 PtOx/WO3,39 CoOx/Ta3N5,40 BiVO4,41etc.) and electron mediators (reduced graphene oxide,42 Au nanoparticles,26 IO3−/I−,43 Fe3+/Fe2+,44 I3−/I−,45etc.) have been widely investigated to construct efficient Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting systems. The relatively inefficient charge transfer between the water reduction photocatalyst and water oxidation photocatalyst is regarded as the undesired deactivation processes inside the Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting system, which tremendously restricts the photocatalytic performance of the Z-scheme system. Therefore, it remains highly challenging to suppress backward reactions and improve the charge separation efficiency in the Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting system. Additionally, most of those previously reported Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting systems employing noble metal loaded-semiconductors as the HEPs or OEPs, and the high cost and scarcity of precious metals limit their practical application. Thus, the development of the noble-metal-free Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system with efficient charge separation is extremely desirable.
In photocatalytic water reduction and water oxidation half-reaction systems, noble-metal-free MoS2/CdS46–48 and Co3O4/BiVO4 (ref. 49 and 50) composites have been demonstrated to be a highly efficient HEP and OEP, respectively. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study regarding the combination of a MoS2/CdS water reduction photocatalyst and a Co3O4/BiVO4 water oxidation photocatalyst for constructing the Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system has been reported to date. Accordingly, it is expected that the combination of MoS2/CdS and Co3O4/BiVO4 is promising to obtain a highly efficient and low-cost Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system. Herein, we report an efficient Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system that is comprised of a MoS2/CdS HEP, a Co3O4/BiVO4 OEP and a [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2/[Co(bpy)3](PF6)2 (Scheme S1†) electron mediator in pure water. It is interesting that the designed Z-scheme system exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting even without any precious metal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system has been exploited without any noble metals. The results obtained provide new insights into the construction of a noble-metal-free Z-scheme system for solar-to-H2 conversion.
Experimental
Materials
Ammonium hexafluorophosphate (NH4PF6), cadmium acetate dehydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O), 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy), sodium molybdate dehydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), thiourea, cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), bismuth oxide (Bi2O3), vanadium oxide (V2O5), silver nitrate (AgNO3), lactic acid and methanolic bromine were used as received from Alfa Aesar China (Tianjing) Co. Ltd. All solvents were used as received from Hangzhou Mick chemical instrument Co., Ltd.
Preparation of BiVO4 powders
Particles of BiVO4 were prepared by a solid–liquid state reaction as reported in the literature.51 Bi2O3 and V2O5 were used as the starting materials. Typically, 5 mmol Bi2O3 and 5 mmol V2O5 were added into 100 ml of 0.75 M nitric acid solution to form mixed solution under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 48 h. Then the product was collected via centrifugal separation and washed with deionized water three times. The resultant BiVO4 powders were obtained after being dried at 80 °C for 12 h.
Preparation of Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs
Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs were prepared by an impregnation method.36 1 g BiVO4 was added into 5 ml of 6.22 mM cobalt(II) nitrate solution to form a suspension solution, which was dried at 80 °C to obtain mixed solid. The mixture was then transferred into a quartz crucible and then calcined at 450 °C for 3 h in an air atmosphere to obtain the 0.25 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 OEP. The 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25 and 1.50 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs were prepared by similar preparation processes in the presence of 5 ml of 12.44, 18.66, 24.88, 31.10 and 37.32 M cobalt nitrate solutions, respectively.
Preparation of CdS nanoparticles
Typically, 3 g cadmium acetate dehydrate and 3 g thiourea were added into 100 ml of ethylene glycol and then stirred at 150 °C for 16 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The precipitate was segregated by centrifugation and then washed with deionized water three times. The product was dried at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain yellow CdS nanoparticles.
Preparation of MoS2/CdS HEPs
MoS2/CdS HEPs were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Typically, 15 mg sodium molybdate dehydrate and 30 mg thiourea were added into 35 ml of aqueous solution containing 1 g CdS under stirring. The solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated at 210 °C for 24 h, and cooled to room temperature naturally. The suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min and then washed with deionized water three times to obtain the brown precipitate. Finally, the product was calcined at 400 °C for 12 h under an argon atmosphere to obtain 1 wt% MoS2/CdS composite photocatalysts. The 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 wt% MoS2/CdS samples were prepared according to similar preparation processes by changing the amounts of both sodium molybdate dehydrate and thiourea. Finally, all MoS2/CdS samples were calcined at 400 °C for 12 h under an argon atmosphere.
Preparation of [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2
The [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2 complex was synthesized according to a previously reported procedure.52 50 ml of methanolic solution of 2,2′-bipyridine (2.34 g) was added dropwise into 5 ml of 1 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution. After the mixed solution was stirred for 3 h and at room temperature, 2 equivalents of NH4PF6 in 5 ml of deionized water were added to form a precipitate. The brown product was filtered and washed with deionized water three times, and then dried under vacuum to obtain [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2.
Preparation of [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3
30 ml of methanolic solution of 2,2′-bipyridine (2.34 g) was added dropwise into 5 ml of 1 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution. After the mixed solution was stirred for 3 h and at room temperature, 2 equivalents of methanolic bromine were then added into the mixed solution, and stirring continued for 2 h. The solution was first filtered to remove the precipitate present, and then was evaporated under vacuum to remove the solvent. The resultant solid sample was then redissolved in 50 ml of methanol, and then 3 equivalents of NH4PF6 in 5 ml of deionized water were added into the filtrate to obtain a yellow precipitate. The precipitated product was filtered and washed with deionized water three times, and dried under vacuum to obtain the [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 complex.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) of samples was performed in the range of 10–80° (2θ) by using a Rigaku-miniflex6 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) of all samples was obtained by using a Varian cary 500 UV-vis spectrophotometer with an integration sphere and BaSO4 as the reference sample, and the DRS was converted from reflection to absorbance by the Kubelka–Munk method. Field emission scanning electron microscopic (FE-SEM) images of samples were acquired by using a Carl Zeiss Gemini ultra-55 field emission scanning electron microscope. The crystallite morphologic micrograph of samples was recorded on a JEOL JEM-2010 field-emission transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured on a VG ESCALAB MKII XPS photoelectron spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray source. All binding energies were corrected by referencing the C 1s at 284.8 eV. The amounts of Mo and Co elements present in MoS2/CdS and Co3O4/BiVO4 composites were quantitatively determined by using inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, optima 2100 DV, Perkin-Elmer). Raman spectra were measured by using a J-Y T64000 Raman spectrometer equipped with a 532 nm laser excitation. Cyclic voltammetry was performed by using a three-electrode electrochemical cell equipped with a glass-carbon working electrode, a platinum-wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (0.20 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode). The saturated KCl solution was used as an electrolyte. The concentration of Cd2+ was performed by atomic absorption spectrometry (Unicam 939).
Photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photocatalytic water splitting experiments were examined in a Pyrex glass reactor (350 ml) with a top window connected to a gas-circulation system. The reactor was side-irradiated by using a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) and an output intensity of 200 mW cm−2. In a typical photocatalytic water splitting experiment, the 100 mg HEP and 100 mg OEP were dispersed with constant stirring in 250 ml aqueous solution containing 50 μM [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2 and 50 μM [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3. Before irradiation, the suspension was degassed by evacuation to remove any dissolved air. The evolved gases were determined by using an gas chromatograph (JieDao GC1609, MS-5A column) equipped with a TCD detector using Ar as the carrier gas. The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at 293 K using water-circulation equipment. For photocatalytic H2 and O2 production half-reactions, lactic acid and AgNO3 were used as the sacrificial agents, respectively. Apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of the H2 evolution system was estimated according to the following equations: (1) (2)where P is the input optical power; λ is the wavelength of light source; h is Planck's constant; c is light speed; t is the irradiation time.
Results and discussion
The crystal structures of the as-prepared MoS2/CdS HEPs loaded with different amounts of MoS2 from 0 to 6 wt% (vs. CdS) were examined by XRD. As shown in Fig. S1,† all MoS2/CdS samples exhibit XRD patterns similar to that of bare CdS. The six broad peaks located at 2θ = 25.4°, 26.9°, 28.6°, 44.1°, 48.3° and 52.5° correspond respectively to the (002), (100), (101), (110), (103) and (112) planes of hexagonal wurtzite (JCPDS no. 65-3414).53 It should be noted that the XRD patterns of all MoS2/CdS samples surprisingly show no obvious diffraction peaks of MoS2 although its features clearly appeared in Raman, TEM and XPS analyses, as discussed later. This can be ascribed to the low amount and relatively low diffraction intensity of MoS2.
Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the structure of MoS2/CdS composites. As shown in Fig. S2,† the bare CdS shows two peaks at 295 cm−1 and 597 cm−1, which can be assigned to the characteristic peaks of the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons of CdS.46 The Raman spectrum of the 4 wt% MoS2/CdS composite also shows the characteristic peaks of CdS, which is consistent with the CdS sample. Significantly, two characteristic peaks of MoS2 were also observed at 377 cm−1 and 403 cm−1, which were ascribed to the E2g and A1g vibrational modes of 2H-MoS2, respectively.8 The optical properties of MoS2/CdS HEPs were measured by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S3,† the bare CdS sample performs a 520 nm absorption band-edge in the visible light region, corresponding to a band gap energy of 2.4 eV, which agreed with the previously reported result.54 As MoS2 was introduced into CdS, all MoS2/CdS samples exhibit strong absorption in the long-wavelength range, which can be assigned to the existence of MoS2.
It should be noted that the absorption in the long-wavelength range strengthens with the loading amount of MoS2, which is in agreement with the color of MoS2/CdS samples that changes from yellow to grey.
The morphology of bare CdS, MoS2 and MoS2/CdS composites was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S4,† the SEM image of the bare CdS sample shows that the product consists of spherical particles with diameters of 40–60 nm. The pure MoS2 sample obtained by the hydrothermal approach was self-assembled to form 3D large-sized microspheres (Fig. S5†). When MoS2 was incorporated, there is no obvious morphological change observed for the 4 wt% MoS2/CdS composite illustrated in Fig. 1a, which could be attributed to the small amount of MoS2 and its homogeneous distribution. Although the MoS2 component loaded on the surface of CdS was not observed by SEM, it can be demonstrated by TEM and HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 1b, the MoS2 nanosheets were almost uniformly grown on the surface of CdS, and the number of layers can be easily identified to be 3–5 (Fig. 1c). The HRTEM image of the 4 wt% MoS2/CdS composite illustrated in Fig. 1d reveals fringes with lattice spacings of ca. 0.61 nm and 0.29 nm, which can be indexed to the (002) plane of hexagonal MoS2 and the (200) plane of wurtzite CdS, respectively.55

X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) analysis was used to study the chemical state of the as-prepared MoS2/CdS HEPs. As shown in Fig. 2a, the XPS survey spectrum identified the presence of Cd, S and Mo. In the high resolution XPS spectra of Cd 3d (Fig. 2b), two characteristic peaks located at 404.9 and 411.7 eV with a binding energy splitting of 6.8 eV indicate the presence of Cd2+.56Fig. 2c shows the S 2p XPS spectrum of MoS2/CdS, where two different peaks at 161.4 and 163.5 eV correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively.48 Binding energies of 228.3 and 231.8 eV are indicative of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 in the high resolution Mo 3d spectra (Fig. 2d) which correspond to Mo4+.48 The XPS analysis results confirm that the deposited Mo element exists in MoS2.

Fig. S6† illustrates the XRD patterns of bare BiVO4 and Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs loaded with various amounts of Co3O4. As for the pure BiVO4 sample, all diffraction peaks can be readily indexed to the monoclinic scheelite phase of BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 14-0688).51 However, no diffraction peak corresponding to Co3O4 was observed for these Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs. This may be due to the small amount of Co3O4 and its high dispersion on the surface of BiVO4. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-synthesized Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs were investigated and are shown in Fig. S7.† The bare BiVO4 shows absorption from the UV through the visible range up to about 510 nm. The steep shape of the absorption edge between 495 nm and 510 nm indicated that the visible light absorption of the BiVO4 sample is attributed to the band-gap transition, corresponding to the band gap of 2.5 eV. As for these Co3O4/BiVO4 composite OEPs, the absorption spectra showed a combination of the spectral absorption features of BiVO4 and Co3O4 alone, with BiVO4 harvesting mainly photons with wavelengths less than 510 nm while Co3O4 absorption extends into the long wavelength region (λ > 510 nm). The absorption intensity of Co3O4/BiVO4 composites in the long wavelength region increases with the Co3O4 content. The morphology of pure BiVO4 and Co3O4/BiVO4 composites was visualized by SEM. A typical low-magnification SEM image illustrated in Fig. S8† shows that the bare BiVO4 consisted of a large number of micrometer-sized particles with a tetragonal zircon structure. After Co3O4 was introduced into BiVO4 at 550 °C, the 1.5 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 composite shows the morphology (Fig. S9†) similar to the original BiVO4, indicating that the thermal treatment has no influence on the morphology, as well as the crystalline phase of BiVO4. Although the Co3O4 component exhibited in the Co3O4/BiVO4 composite was not observed in the SEM image, it can be demonstrated by the following TEM and XPS analyses. As shown in Fig. S10,† the TEM image of the 1.5 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 composite clearly shows that the Co3O4 nanoparticles with diameters of 5–10 nm were grown on the surface of BiVO4. The chemical composition of the Co3O4/BiVO4 composite was investigated by XPS. The survey XPS spectrum illustrated in Fig. S11† shows that the sample was composed of Bi, V, O and Co. In the high-resolution spectrum of Bi 3d shown in Fig. S12,† two strong peaks at 157.8 and 165.2 eV were attributed to Bi 3d5/2 and Bi 3d3/2, and were characteristic of the Bi3+.57 Besides, the sample shows two V 2p peaks: a lower peak at 516.1 eV corresponding to V 2p3/2 and a higher peak at 524.2 eV corresponding to V 2p1/2 (Fig. S13†).57 The O 1s peak at 530.2 eV illustrated in Fig. S14† is evidence of the O element in BiVO4 and Co3O4.58 In Fig. S15,† the Co 2p XPS spectra exhibit two spin–orbit split peaks with the 2p3/2 peak at 780.2 eV and the 2p1/2 peak at 795.5 eV with a binding energy splitting of 15.3 eV, confirming the existence of both Co2+ and Co3+ in Co3O4.59 The XPS results further confirm the presence of Co3O4 and BiVO4 in the composite.
Photocatalytic H2 generation of various MoS2/CdS HEPs was conducted in 250 ml of 0.2 M ascorbic acid aqueous solution under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The H2 generation rates of various MoS2/CdS HEPs are summarized in Fig. 3a. The bare CdS sample showed a poor photocatalytic activity for H2 production with a H2 evolution rate of 87 μmol h−1 g−1, which is related to the low separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pair. The photocatalytic performance of MoS2/CdS HEPs gradually increases with the increase of MoS2 mass fraction from 0.5 to 1.5 wt%, and then decreases with the increasing amount of MoS2. The 1.5 wt% MoS2/CdS sample shows the highest H2 evolution rate of 10200 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 124 times higher that of bare CdS. When the loading amount of MoS2 is less than 1.5 wt%, the H2 evolution rate increases with the increasing amount of MoS2, which can be assigned to the increasing active sites for the H2 evolution reaction. However, over loading of MoS2 on CdS resulted in the decreasing H2 evolution rates, which could be attributed to the light shielding effect of MoS2. A similar result has been observed in previous studies.47,48 On the other hand, photocatalytic activity toward O2 generation for all the as-prepared Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs was examined using AgNO3 as the sacrificial electron acceptor in aqueous solution. No O2 was detected in the absence of any component of the Co3O4/BiVO4 OEP, AgNO3 or irradiation, indicating O2 production by photolysis of sacrificial solution. The introduction of Co3O4 results in a significant enhancement of O2 generation. As shown in Fig. 3b, the photocatalytic activity of Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs for O2 evolution increases first, and then gradually decreases with further loading of Co3O4. The maximum O2 evolution rate of 2720 μmol h−1 g−1 was observed for the 1.5 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 OEP, which is nearly 22 times more than that of the pure BiVO4 sample. When the loading amount of Co3O4 exceeds 1.5 wt%, the photocatalytic performance of Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs increases with the increasing amount of Co3O4. This phenomenon is related to the light shielding effect of Co3O4 loaded on the surface of BiVO4. Furthermore, the mass fractions of MoS2 and Co3O4 in the 4 wt% MoS2/CdS and 1.5 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 samples were determined by ICP-OES to be about 3.67 and 1.44 wt%, respectively (Table S1†), which is close to the theoretical values.
 Fig. 3  (a) The rate of H2 production on MoS2/CdS HEPs loaded with various amounts of MoS2 under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) in 250 ml of 0.2 M ascorbic acid aqueous solution containing the 50 mg photocatalyst. (b) The rate of O2 production on Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs loaded with different amounts of Co3O4 under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) in 250 ml of 0.2 M AgNO3 aqueous solution containing the 50 mg photocatalyst. 
Photocatalytic overall water splitting into H2 and O2 under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) was also examined for the Z-scheme systems combined with MoS2/CdS composites as the HEPs, Co3O4/BiVO4 composites as the OEPs, and the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple as the electron mediator. Control experiments show that no H2 and O2 can be observed when the photocatalytic system was employed in the absence of any component of MoS2/CdS, Co3O4/BiVO4, the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple or light, indicating all of these components were essential for the water splitting reaction, and the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction operated via the Z-scheme carrier transfer mechanism between the OEP and HEP mediated by the redox mediator. As shown in Fig. 4, the photocatalytic water splitting activity is strongly dependent on the chemical components of both MoS2/CdS HEPs and Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs. Fig. 4a shows the evolved H2 and O2 as a function of irradiation time with different Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs. The photocatalytic system based on the 1.5 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 OEP shows the highest activity, and the rates of H2 and O2 evolution were estimated to be 14.5 and 7.1 μmol h−1, respectively, after 4 h of visible light irradiation. The apparent quantum yield reaches up to 1.04% at 420 nm. We noted that the Z-scheme system exhibits a lower apparent quantum yield than those of Z-scheme systems based on SrTiO3:La,Rh/Au/BiVO4 (5.9%, 418 nm),33 Ru–SrTiO3:Rh/BiVO4 (1.6%, 420 nm),41 and SrTiO3:Rh/BiVO4 (1.7%, 420 nm),60 but its activity is comparable to those of many other Z-scheme systems illustrated in entries 1–17 in Table S2.† Simultaneous generation of H2 and O2 is observed in Fig. 4, and the H2/O2 ratio is close to 2, indicating a balanced reduction and oxidation of H2O. The control experiment shows that the photocatalytic system consists of CdS, BiVO4 and the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple produced no appreciable amount of gas, which can be attributed to the poor separating efficiency of photogenerated charge in bare CdS and BiVO4. This hypothesis was supported by the poor photocatalytic performance of both bare CdS and BiVO4 in a half-reaction system shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the pH of reaction solution before and after irradiation remained nearly the same, confirming that the evolved H2 and O2 are originated from water splitting. On the other hand, the dependence of the photocatalytic performance on the chemical component of MoS2/CdS HEPs is shown in Fig. 4b. The maximum amount of evolved gas was observed when the 4 wt% MoS2/CdS HEP was used, which is consistent with the result obtained in Fig. 3a. The above-mentioned results indicate that the highest activity was obtained by combining the 4 wt% MoS2/CdS HEP and 1.5 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 OEP, which could be attributed to a balance between the benefit of the more active sites at high cocatalyst content with the need of the photocatalyst for light absorption at high photocatalyst content. The amounts of both MoS2 and Co3O4 can significantly affect the photocatalytic activity of this Z-scheme system. The photocatalytic performance of the Z-scheme system gradually increases and then decreases with the increasing amounts of both MoS2 and Co3O4. The increasing photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the increasing active sites of Co3O4 (or MoS2) for the O2 (or H2) evolution reaction. However, a further increase in the amount of cocatalysts results in a decrease of the photocatalytic activity, which is related to the shading effect. As a consequence, a suitable amount of cocatalysts loaded on both WPRs and OEPs is crucial for optimizing the photocatalytic activity of the Z-scheme overall water splitting system. As compared to these H2 and O2 evolution half-reaction systems (Fig. 3), the overall water splitting system exhibited a lower photocatalytic activity, which could be mainly ascribed to back electron transfer between the redox couple and photocatalysts. On the H2 evolution reaction side, water reduction competes with the reduction of [Co(bpy)3]3+ by the photogenerated electrons, whereas on the O2 generation side, water oxidation competes with the oxidation of [Co(bpy)3]2+. Furthermore, the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple can absorb a fraction of light, which could be another reason for the low photocatalytic activity of the Z-scheme overall water splitting system.

(b) The evolution rate of H2 and O2 with irradiation time from water for different MoS2/CdS HEPs (0.1 g) in a Z-scheme system containing the 0.1 g 1.5 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 OEP, 50 μM [Co(bpy)3]3+ and 50 μM [Co(bpy)3]2+ under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). 
After the compositions of both MoS2/CdS HEPs and Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs were optimized, the effect of the redox couple on the photocatalytic performance of this Z-scheme system was studied. As illustrated in Table 1, it was found that the photocatalytic performance of the Z-scheme system was also dependent on the concentration of the cobalt complexes redox couple. It should be noted that both H2 and O2 evolution rates increase with the increasing amount of cobalt complexes and then gradually decreased. When the total concentration of the redox couple is less than 100 μM (entries 1–3), the photocatalytic activity significantly increases with the increasing amount of the redox couple, which can be attributed to the increasing active sites for charge carriers transfer. At higher concentration (entries 3–5), the amount of evolved gas decreased with the increasing concentration of cobalt complexes, possibly because of the fact that the cobalt complexes could compete with both the HEP and the OEP in harvesting light. In the absence of either [Co(bpy)3]3+ (entry 6) or [Co(bpy)3]2+ (entry 7), the Z-scheme systems are still active for photocatalytic overall water splitting but exhibited lower performance. During photocatalytic reactions, the [Co(bpy)3]3+ component can be generated by the photocatalytic oxidation of [Co(bpy)3]2+ using MoS2/CdS HEPs. On the other hand, the [Co(bpy)3]2+ component can be formed by the photocatalytic reduction of [Co(bpy)3]3+ using Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs. Previous studies have shown that the free Co2+ ions can be liberated from cobalt complexes.61,62 To rule out the contribution of free Co2+ ions to the water splitting reaction, Co2+ ions were used as the redox mediator. It is noted that no considerable gas was observed when free Co2+ ions were used to replace the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple (entry 8), indicating that the activity is mainly due to the cobalt complexes rather than Co2+ ions decomposed from cobalt complexes.

Owing to the importance of the stability of a photocatalytic system for its practical application, the photocatalytic stabilization of the designed Z-scheme system was tested by cycling photocatalytic overall water splitting experiments. The cycling tests in the Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system using 1.5 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 as the OEP, 4 wt% MoS2/CdS as the HEP and the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple as the electron mediator is illustrated in Fig. 5. The H2 evolution rate during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycles was found to be 14.5, 13.4 and 12.8 μmol h−1, respectively. In general, CdS photocatalysts suffered from poor stability owing to the photocorrosion phenomenon of CdS. That is, S2− in CdS can be oxidized by photogenerated valence band holes, resulting in the dissolution of Cd2+ ions. In this study, the photocorrosion of CdS was evaluated by measuring the Cd2+ concentration in the solution. After 4 h of visible light illumination, the concentration of Cd2+ in the solution measured by atomic absorption spectrometry was observed to be 75 mg l−1, indicating that 3.13% of CdS was destroyed during the reaction process. Furthermore, the decomposition products delivered from the cobalt complex electron mediator were extracted from reaction solution and characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The GC-MS analysis shows that 2,2′-bipyridine dissociates from the cobalt complexes (Fig. S16†). These results indicate that the slight decrease in the photocatalytic performance could be attributed to both the photocorrosion of CdS and the decomposition of the cobalt complex electron mediator.

To investigate the potential of the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple, cyclic voltammetry measurement was conducted. A saturated potassium chloride solution consisting of 20 μM [Co(bpy)3]2+ and 20 μM [Co(bpy)3]3+ was measured at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. S17,† the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple exhibits a reversible peak with a potential of 0.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.35 V vs. the NHE), which is related to the reversible reaction of [Co(bpy)3]2+ ⇌ [Co(bpy)3]3+ + e−. The electrochemical analysis shows that the redox potential of the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox medium was suitably located between the conduction band (CB) of BiVO4 (ECB = 0 V vs. the NHE)63 and the valance band (VB) of CdS (EVB = +1.5 V vs. the NHE).64 Therefore, the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple has the capability to transfer charge carriers between the CdS HEP and BiVO4 OEP.
Based on the aforementioned results and discussion, the proposed mechanism of photocatalytic overall water splitting in the Z-scheme system based on the MoS2/CdS HEP, Co3O4/BiVO4 OEP and [Co(bpy)3]2+/[Co(bpy)3]3+ redox couple is illustrated in Fig. 6, and the transfer routes of photoinduced charge carriers in this system are summarized in Scheme S2.† Upon irradiation of visible light, an electron is excited from the CB to the VB of the light-harvesting semiconductors (CdS and BiVO4), creating photoinduced charge carriers (eqn (S1)† and (2)). The conduction band energy level of CdS (ECB = −0.9 V vs. the NHE)63 is much more negative than that of MoS2 (ECB = −0.13 V vs. the NHE),48,65 providing ample driving force for electron transfer from CdS to MoS2 (eqn (S3)†), and then the electron-rich MoS2 can reduce water to H2 (eqn (S4)†). The positively charged CdS (EVB = +1.5 V vs. the NHE)64 can be regenerated to the original state by accepting an electron from [Co(bpy)3]2+ (eqn (S5)†) owing to the more negative [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox potential (E([Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+) = 0.35 V vs. the NHE, pH 7). On the other hand, BiVO4 has both a more positive VB level (EVB = +2.5 V vs. the NHE)64 for hole injection to the VB of Co3O4 (eqn (S6)†) and the sufficiently negative CB level (EVB = 0 V vs. the NHE)66 for the reduction of [Co(bpy)3]3+ to [Co(bpy)3]2+ (eqn (S7)†), thus BiVO4 can act as an efficient light-harvesting semiconductor for water oxidation. At last, the hole-rich Co3O4 can oxidize water to generate O2 (eqn (S8)†).

Conclusions
In summary, a noble-metal-free Z-scheme photocatalytic overall splitting system was constructed by using a MoS2/CdS composite as the HEP, a Co3O4/BiVO4 composite as the OEP and a [Co(bpy)3]2+/[Co(bpy)3]3+ redox couple as the electron mediator. The effect of chemical compositions of MoS2/CdS HEPs and Co3O4/BiVO4 OEPs on the photocatalytic performance of the Z-scheme system was investigated. The Z-scheme system based on 4 wt% MoS2/CdS and 1.5 wt% Co3O4/BiVO4 exhibits the highest photocatalytic performance with a H2 and O2 evolution rate of 14.5 and 7.1 μmol h−1, respectively, with an excellent stability exceeded 12 h. The apparent quantum yield reaches up to 1.04% at 420 nm, which is comparable with the previously reported systems based on noble metal modified semiconductor photocatalysts. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of applying noble-metal-free cocatalysts with suitable semiconductor photocatalysts for visible-light-driven photocatalytic overall water splitting in a Z-scheme system.
