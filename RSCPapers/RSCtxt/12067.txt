    , Accepted 21st January 2020First published on 21st January 2020AbstractInterfacial adsorption configuration plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and thus, theoretical investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of different absorption configurations on stoichiometric and defective TiO2(101) surfaces on the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of DSSCs. Herein, calculations of isolated dyes and dye/TiO2 systems were performed on the donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) type porphyrin sensitizers bearing different donor moieties and an α-cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group (T1–3), using DFT and TD-DFT methods. And, for the first time, comparative analysis of interfacial electron transfer (IET) and density of states (DOS) were carried out on dye/TiO2 systems with stoichiometric and defective surfaces to provide further insight into the electronic factors influencing the efficiency of DSSCs, which can well explain the experimental variation trends of JSC and VOC values. It turned out that attachment via the carboxyl and cynao groups in a tridentate binding mode can result in more efficient IET rates and an upshifted conduction band in comparison with those of the bidentate attachment. More interestingly, we found that the adsorption configuration on defective surfaces containing an O2c vacancy induced more upshifted CBM and relatively fast IET, especially for the bonding mode through two O atoms of the carboxyl group.
1 Introduction
Since the first report by Grätzel and coworkers in 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been intensively researched and developed as a promising alternative to conventional silicon-based photovoltaic devices, due to their relatively low-cost preparation processes and good photovoltaic performance.2–14 As one of the essential components of a DSSC, sensitizing dyes exert a crucial influence on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. In the past decades, many kinds of high performance dyes, such as ruthenium complexes,7,8 metal-free organic dyes,9,10 and zinc-porphyrin dyes11,12 have been synthesized and investigated for application in DSSCs. Zn–porphyrin analogs have been studied extensively, since they provide a highly flexible platform for the development of efficient sensitizers due to the ease of their structural modifications and the broad light absorptions.12–16 So far, the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs with porphyrin sensitizers has reached over 13%.11
The Zn–porphyrin sensitizers featuring a donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) structure have been thoroughly investigated both experimentally and theoretically.16–24 Theoretical investigations have been performed on the ground states and excited states of isolated dyes to analyse the critical factors that influence the JSC and VOC of DSSCs. Based on previous studies, it is believed that the critical factors related to the dye sensitizers in influencing the cell performance normally involve (i) a smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap25 and good energy level alignment with the TiO2 conduction band (CB) and different redox mediators;17,26 (ii) good coplanarity across the donor and anchoring group, which is favorable for intramolecular charge transfer;27 (iii) low values of reorganization energy of sensitizers (Ereg), ionization potential (IP), and electron affinity (EA) indicating more efficient hole–electron separation, easy release of electrons and high energy barrier for electron recombination;28,29 (iv) efficient intramolecular electron transfer upon photoexcitation, which could be described by calculating the distance from hole centroid to electron centroid (DCT), the value of average hole–electron distance (Δr), and the amount of charge transferred to the anchoring group during S0 → S1.30,31
In order to reduce the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of the sensitizers and enhance the intra-molecular charge transfer process, the electron-withdrawing group has been incorporated into the conjugated bridge as the auxiliary acceptor (AC).32,33 In many previous studies,13,34–37 the cyanoacrylic acid moiety (CN) has been widely introduced as the AC and anchoring group. It is reported that the CN group favors the localization of excited electrons on the anchoring group and hence facilitates the electron injection into TiO2.36 Moreover, the CN group might stabilize the LUMO level and induce a red shift of the electronic absorption band of the dyes.35,37 However, it was also reported that when the CN moiety was introduced into the π bridge, it might form an electron trap28,29 and lead to a weak interfacial interaction between the LUMO and Ti 3d orbital,13 unfavorable for the electron injection from the excited dye to TiO2. Thus, the role of CN as the AC group still needs to be further clarified and, in particular, further theoretical analysis of the dye/TiO2 interfacial adsorption configuration involving CN as the AC group is highly in demand to provide new insights towards a clear understanding of the effects of adsorption modes on the DSSC performance.
Recently, the adsorption configurations of sensitizers on stoichiometric TiO2 anatase (101) surface and the interaction between the adsorbates and the TiO2 have received growing attention. The bidentate bridging, with the two oxygen atoms of the carboxylate bound to the two neighboring Ti atoms and one proton transferred to a nearby oxygen atom, has been widely accepted as a stable adsorption mode for carboxylate–dye anchoring on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface.38–40 However, the IR spectra of the sensitizers absorbed on the TiO2 surface, which contained the cyanoacrylic acid moiety as the anchoring group and the further computational analysis disclosed that the CN groups could also be involved in interfacial anchoring with the tridentate configuration.41–43 Meng and colleagues41 adopted a segment of L2 dye containing the thiophene moiety and cyanoacrylic acid to investigate all possible adsorption configurations and the effects of Ti–N bonding on photovoltaic performance. They proposed a tridentate adsorption mode with one O atom and the N atom attached to two neighboring Ti atoms and the other O atom bonded to the TiO2 surface through a hydrogen bond. The Ti–N bonding not only has a crucial influence on the stability of the adsorbate, but also leads to high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and ultrafast interfacial electron injection. Later, Tsai and coworkers42 employed density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the adsorption configuration and confirmed Meng's conclusion that tridentate and bidentate bridging configurations coexist in the dye–TiO2 system. Their study suggests that the bidentate bridging structure is a kinetically trapped adsorption configuration and the tridentate mode is a thermodynamically stable one.
Zhu and colleagues investigated adsorption dynamics of two anchoring moieties (benzoic acid and cyanoacrylic acid) and found that the CN group could efficiently participate in interface bonding on a TiO2 surface, especially for the defective TiO2(101) surface with oxygen vacancy.44 The absorption energies of different interfacial structures were well-compared, but how different adsorption configurations on both stoichiometric and defective TiO2(101) surfaces influence the JSC and VOC values still remain unclear. Herein, we explored the D–π–A type Zn–porphyrin sensitizers (T1–3) previously synthesized by Zhang et al.,15 wherein the dyes use CN as an acceptor and anchoring group, but differ from each other by varying the donor moieties as shown in Fig. 1. Bidentate and tridentate absorption configurations are both sterically allowed for these three molecules. Density of state (DOS) analysis and interfacial election transfer (IET) simulation were performed to understand how different absorption configurations on stoichiometric and defective TiO2(101) surfaces influence the JSC and VOC values. It clearly showed that the attachment via the carboxyl and cyano groups in a tridentate binding mode can result in more efficient IET rates and an upshifted conduction band in comparison with the bidentate attachment at the ideal surface. More interestingly, the adsorption configuration on the defective surface containing O2c vacancy induced more upshifted CBM and relatively fast IET, especially for the bonding mode through two O atoms of the carboxyl group.

2 Computational methods
2.1 Isolated dyes
To evaluate the role of the donor moiety and cyano group on the photovoltaic properties of D–π–A zinc porphyrin dyes, all the calculations for isolated dyes were performed with density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) using the Gaussian 09 code.45 The ground-state geometries for isolated T1 to T3 dyes were optimized in vacuum at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level,46 followed by frequency analysis to confirm that the structures are local minima (Fig. S1, ESI†). To compare theoretical excitation energy with experimental UV-vis spectrum, the vertical excitation calculation analysis was performed at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level,47 using dichloromethane as the solvent within the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM). The contribution of molecular orbitals (MO) in the electronic transitions are generated using the GaussSum program.48
2.2 Dye/TiO2 systems
To model the TiO2 nanoparticle, we employed a (TiO2)38 cluster, obtained by appropriately cutting an anatase slab exposing the majority (101) surface, which has been widely used previously.49–51 The T1–3 dyes were absorbed onto the (101) surface of the TiO2 clusters with bidentate bridging40 and tridentate configuration,41 since the two modes have been previously reported as coexistent ones42 and they are sterically allowed for T1–3 molecules. Furthermore, we also simulated the partially reduced TiO2(101) surface by introducing an O2c vacancy and modeled T1–3 adsorption configurations with the cyano group and carboxyl group sitting at Ti5c sites and O2c vacancies. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), we studied the three most stable conformations reported by Zhu et al.44 The dye/TiO2 systems were optimized at the PBE/DNP level using the DMol3 program package52,53 from Materials Studio. Then, single-point calculations were performed at the HES06/6-31G(d) level (PCM, acetonitrile) using the G09. To gain further insight into interfacial electronic coupling between the dye and TiO2, density of states (DOS) calculation was performed using the Multiwfn code.54
2.3 Interfacial electron transfer (IET)
In order to gain insight into the interfacial electron transfer from adsorbates to TiO2, quantum dynamics simulations were performed for dye/TiO2 systems using the method developed by Rego and Batista, employing the semiempirical extended Hückel (EH) approach.55 This simulation method has been successfully used to estimate IET rates and explain experimental trends.56–58 The description of this method is given in the ESI.† Electron injection from the LUMOs of T1–3 were investigated. As shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), the Kohn–Sham particle states are matched well to the EH orbitals. Simulations were performed for the total time of 500 fs with a step-size of 0.1 fs. To avoid artificial recurrences of electrons, absorbing potentials were placed on the Ti atoms.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 GS and ES calculation
As shown in the optimized conformation (Fig. S1, ESI†), the lower coplanarity in T3 resulted in the diminished electron delocalization between the donor and porphyrin ring, and subsequently the lower HOMO level and the blue shift of the light-absorption in the UV-vis spectrum.15 The presence of a CC double bond in the donor group may lead to good conjugation between the two phenyl rings, but a large dihedral angle between the donor moiety and porphyrin ring results in relatively inefficient electron transfer. In the case of dye T2, the C–C single bonds in the donor group reduced the twisted angle between the two phenyl rings in the diphenylamino group and enhanced the coplanarity between the phenyl rings and the porphyrin ring, favoring intra-molecular electron transfer. The calculated frontier MOs and their corresponding energy levels of the three organic dyes T1–3 are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is found that all the HOMO electrons of all three dyes are mainly distributed over the donor units, while the LUMO electrons are predominantly located on the π-bridge and cyanoacrylic units. The effective intra-molecular charge transfer and significant accumulation of electrons at the anchoring group in the LUMO can facilitate electron injection into the conducting band of TiO2. The HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 MOs of T1 and T3 are mainly localized on the porphyrin ring, while the HOMO−1 of T2 is distributed on both the donor unit and porphyrin. The HOMO−LUMO gaps of T1–3 are as follows: T1 (2.32 eV) ≈ T2 (2.33 eV) < T3 (2.47 eV), leading to a redshift of the UV-vis spectrum in the order of T1 ≈ T2 > T3. The LUMO levels for the three dyes are almost the same (−2.87 eV for T1, −2.88 eV for T2, and −2.89 eV for T3) due to the same π-bridge and acceptor. Hence, the red-shift of the absorption band should be ascribed to the HOMO destabilization as a consequence of the enhanced coplanarity between the donor moiety and the porphyrin rings.

Table 1 lists the excited energy and transition contributions of isolated T1–3 dyes simulated at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in dichloromethane solution. The calculated results are in close agreement with experimental values, which confirms the reliability of the method and the level of theory. The results clearly show that the electronic transitions which contribute to the characteristic B and Q bands mainly arise from the transitions from the HOMO, and HOMO−1 to LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals, which supports the Gouterman's four-orbital model. The Q bands of T1–3 mainly originate from the HOMO to LUMO transition (52% for T1, 48% for T2, and 46% for T3) with a minor contribution from the HOMO−1 to LUMO+1 orbitals (35% for T1, 39% for T2, and 40% for T3), exhibiting effective intra-molecular charge-transfer characteristics. In addition, it is also observed that the MO contribution of the HOMO → LUMO for Q bands decreases in the order (T1 > T2 > T3) while the HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 contribution increases in the order (T1 < T2 < T3). Effective intra-molecular charge-transfer associated with the HOMOs → LUMO transition also shows major contribution to the B band absorption for T1–3.

3.2 Binding modes of dyes on TiO2
Since tridentate (T) and bidentate bridging (BB) configurations coexist in the dye/TiO2 system,42 and the two configurations are both sterically allowed for T1–3, geometry optimization and single-point calculations were performed for T1–3 with the two configurations in this work. The optimized BB and T structures are presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The T1–3 dyes with BB model were adsorbed almost upright onto the TiO2 surface, while the dyes bound onto TiO2 through the T model have a larger tilting angle. The calculated Ti–O distances of T1–3 on TiO2 with the BB model are in the range of 2.08–2.23 Å. These values fall within the range of 2.03–2.24 Å, as reported previously.28,59 The calculated Ti–N distance of T1–3 on TiO2 with the T model is 2.18 Å, and the Ti–O distances are in the range of 1.93–1.97 Å, which is significantly shorter than Ti–O bond length in the BB model leading to a stronger interaction between Ti and O atoms. It is found that the Ti–N and Ti–O bond lengths in the dye–TiO2 systems are almost the same for all three dye molecules T1–3 with the same adsorption configuration. As listed in Table 2, adsorption energies of T1–3 in the T mode are lower than those in the BB mode by 0.36–0.71 eV, which confirms that the T absorption mode increases the interface stability due to the formation of the extra interaction with the substrate.

3.3 IET simulation
According to the indirect electron injection mechanism,38 the electrons are initially promoted to the low-lying excited states upon excitation, followed by the relaxation to the S1 state, and then injected to the conduction band edge of TiO2. Table 1 shows that the LUMO and LUMO+1 play a crucial role in the process of photo-induced excitation. Since the LUMOs are mainly distributed at the anchoring moieties of T1–3, whereas the LUMO+1 orbitals are located at the porphyrin rings, the former should favor electron injection due to the relatively strong electronic coupling between the donor states of the dyes and acceptor states of the semiconductor. Hence, the following DOS and IET analysis focuses mainly on the LUMOs of T1–3. Quantum dynamics simulations for the LUMOs, which were selected as the initial donor states, were performed to estimate IET rates and to explain experimental trends. Fig. 3 presents the IET results. Survival probability, P(t), is defined as the probability that at time t the electron is still localized in the dye. Approximate characteristic IET times were calculated from the single exponential fitting to the survival probabilities with the constraint P(0) = 1. The values of R2 for the fitting are all greater than 0.99.
 Fig. 3  Survival probability, P(t), from IET simulations (solid line) and exponential fitting (dashed line) for the LUMOs of T1 (blue), T2 (red) and T3 (black) propagating into TiO2 slabs with bidentate bridging mode (a) and tridentate mode (b). The two insets report the survival probability in the first 2 fs. 
The IET rate of each dye from the LUMO of the initial donor state in the bidentate bridging configuration (1247–1404 fs) is much slower than that in the tridentate mode (51–70 fs). The more efficient IET from the LUMO in the tridentate configuration can be attributed to the CN group, which leads to a strong interaction between the excited dyes and the TiO2 acceptor states. The characteristic IET times from the LUMO of each dye with the tridentate configuration are all less than 100 fs (51 fs for T2, 54 fs for T1, and 70 fs for T3). This result is consistent with the experimental observation (listed in Table 2) for JSC values (9.68 for T2 > 7.45 for T1 > 6.43 for T3). The IET times from the LUMOs of T1–3 in the bidentate bridging configuration also show the same trend. Hence, for T1–3, CN group plays a crucial role in facilitating a fast IET from the excited states of dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 and thus in enhancing the performance of DSSCs. As shown in Fig. S6–S8 (ESI†), the LUMO undergoes an ultrafast IET via Ti–N and Ti–O bonds in T mode. The IET through Ti–N is more efficient, as the rapid dumping of electron density into TiO2 through the Ti5c–N and the adjacent Ti atoms is observed during the process of IET. Within the first 5 fs of dynamics, the Ti atoms surrounding the binding site accumulate a large amount of electron density due to the low diffusion rate. After that, electron density in TiO2 diffuses away from the bonding site.
3.4 DOS analysis
Density of states (DOS) plotting with associated MO isosurfaces is a well-established approach to investigate interfacial electronic properties and the band edge shift.60 The hybrid functional HSE06 has been employed in the DOS analysis, since it has been verified to predict relatively accurately the band gap.61 DOS and projected density of states (PDOS) curves of the dye have been plotted using the Gaussian function with a standard deviation σ = 0.50 eV. Following the reported method,51 conduction band minima (CBM) of TiO2 were estimated through linear fitting of the PDOS curve in a range from 20% to 80% of the maximum height; the intercept of this line with the energy axis was taken as the CBM.51 The theoretically calculated DOS and PDOS of TiO2 cluster in vacuum and acetonitrile and all the dyes absorbed on ideal TiO2 surface with BB and T adsorption configurations are summarized in Fig. 4 and 5. The calculated HSE06 level TiO2 band gap in vacuo is 3.1 eV, which is a slight underestimation of the experimental band gap of bare TiO2 anatase (3.2 eV) and the band gap of a 2.4 nm TiO2 nanoparticle (3.4 eV).62 The calculated CBM energy position of bare TiO2 is −4.37 eV, which is 0.37 eV lower than the experimental value.63 Upshifted valence band maxima (VBM) and CBM in acetonitrile are presented in Fig. 4, leading to a 0.3 eV larger band gap than that in vacuo. Since dyes absorbed on the TiO2 cluster are all compared in acetonitrile, the effect of the solvent is not considered in this work.

Based on the calculated PDOS plots depicted in Fig. 5, the CBM positions for T1–3 in BB and T adsorption configurations shift following the order of T2 > T1 > T3. This trend matches well with the VOC change (740 mV for T2, 730 mV for T1 and 660 mV for T3) in the DSSC performance. It is also found that the CBM position shift is directly related to normal dipole moment component pointing away from the TiO2 surface (μN) induced by dye adsorption. The μN values were calculated for T1–3 on the adsorbed structures without the TiO2 cluster. The μN values for T1–3 in the BB mode (in Table 2) increase in the order T2 (1.37 D) > T3 (1.17 D) > T1 (0.53 D). In the T mode, a similar trend of the normal dipole moment component occurred (8.07 D for T2, 6.59 D for T1 and 5.92 D for T3). The calculated results reveal that the greater the μN, the higher the VOC, which is consistent with the conclusion obtained by previous studies.41,64 It is observed that interface Ti–N bonds of the dye/TiO2 system in the T configuration induce an upward shift of CBM, which is closer to the LUMOs of the dyes, compared to the BB mode without the interface Ti–N bond. Previous studies41 show that the upshifted CBM reduced kinetic redundancy, so that enhanced VOC values of T1–3 adsorption with the T mode can be inferred.
3.5 Defected TiO2(101) surface
It was reported that the CN group can efficiently participate in surface adsorption on the reduced TiO2(101) surface, resulting in more stable adsorption configurations.44 However, the effects of adsorption configurations at the reduced surface on IET and CBM shift remain unclear. We thus simulated defected TiO2(101) surface by introducing an O2c vacancy in a (TiO2)38 cluster due to the computational cost considerations. IET and DOS analysis was performed at the optimized geometries of the three most stable conformations reported by Zhu et al.44 As shown in Fig. S2 and Table S2 (ESI†), the adsorption configuration (DNO) with one O atom of the carboxyl group inserted into the O2c vacancy and the other O atom and N atom sitting at the neighboring Ti5c sites was the most stable with the highest adsorption energy (−1.79 eV for T1, −1.77 eV for T2 and −1.76 eV for T3). When one O atom of the carboxyl group adsorbs at the O2c vacancy, the adsorption of the N atom at the neighboring Ti5c site results in a less stable configuration (DN), giving lower adsorption energies (−1.72 eV for T1, −1.71 eV for T2 and −1.75 eV for T3). The configuration (DO) with one O atom in the O2c vacancy and the other O atom at the neighboring Ti5c site gives the lowest adsorption energies (−1.47 eV for T1, −1.44 eV for T2 and −1.26 eV for T3). As can be seen from Table 1 and Table S2 (ESI†), the adsorption energies of T1–3 on the defective TiO2 surface is significantly higher than those on the ideal TiO2 surface, which indicates that a reduced TiO2 surface may lead to more stable configurations.
As can be seen in Fig. 6, the IET times from the LUMO of T1 in different adsorption configurations decrease in the order BB (1320 fs) > DNO (132 fs) > DN (107 fs) > DO (90 fs) > T (54 fs). The IET times from LUMOs of T2 and T3 in different configurations also show the same trend (shown in Fig. S5, ESI†). Fig. S6–S8 (ESI†) illustrate that the T mode undergoes rapid IET due to the efficient electron injection through the N–Ti5c bond. However, on the defective surface, the O–Ti bond formed between the O atom of the hydroxyl group inserted into the vacancy and the neighboring Ti atom gives rise to a more effective IET than N–Ti5c bond. It can be observed in Fig. 7 and Fig. S9 (ESI†) that the defected TiO2(101) surface induces an upward shift of conduction band PDOS with respect to CB-PDOS curves for BB and T modes, which could lead to an enhanced VOC. The CB of TiO2 in the dye/TiO2 system with DO adsorption configuration is more significantly upshifted compared with the values for DNO and DN configurations. Therefore, adsorption configurations T and DO are beneficial for JSC of DSSC with Zn–porphyrin dyes, due to more efficient interfacial electron injection from excited dyes to TiO2. DO configuration on the defective surface is expected to produce higher VOC while maintaining efficient IET.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we performed a detailed computational study of Zn porphyrin dyes T1–3 absorbed on stoichiometric and defected TiO2 surfaces in various adsorption configurations to analyze the influence of the interfacial O–Ti bond, N–Ti bond and O2c vacancy on the IET process and CBM shift, and to reveal the effects of the CN group as an anchoring moiety on the performance of DSSC. For isolated dyes, distorted coplanarity between the donor moiety (D) and porphyrin ring (P) caused the blue-shift of the absorption band due to the stabilized HOMO. After adsorption on the surface of TiO2, the cell sensitized by the dye with good D–P coplanarity (T2) attained higher JSC and VOC due to the more efficient IET and upshifted CBM. The calculated normal dipole moment demonstrated the trend of CBM shift and experimental VOC. The results from the DFT and TD-DFT calculations agreed well with the experimental observations, and therefore the method employed has been proven to be reliable for the investigation of interfacial adsorption configurations.
Upon comparison of IET rate and CBM shift for each dye with different adsorption configurations (BB, T, DNO, DN, and DO) on stoichiometric (unreduced) and defective (reduced) TiO2 anatase (101) surfaces, the presence of a CN group as the anchoring moiety is beneficial for Zn–porphyrin dyes involving the interface N–Ti bond, producing stable adsorption and higher VOC, while maintaining efficient IET from excited dyes. The dye/TiO2 system with the T configuration in the stoichiometric surface gave rise to the most efficient IET through the interface N–Ti bond at the expense of lower CBM compared with DNO, DN and DO, which might result in lower VOC. On the defective surface, adsorption with one O atom of carboxyl group inserted in the O2c vacancy induced more upshifted CBM. N–Ti and O–Ti bonds play a crucial role in the primary electron-injection event. It is expected that the DO configuration in the defective surface tends to enhance VOC and JSC of DSSC, since it could result in more upshifted CBM, while maintaining rapid IET.
To sum up, the present study of the effects of interfacial adsorption configuration on the VOC and JSC of DSSCs provides clues for sensitizer design and TiO2 surface treatment, for example, by involving the CN group to enhance JSC, and introducing surface defects enabling the DO mode to enhance VOC, while maintaining relatively high JSC. Further theoretical investigations will be focused on improving the DSSC performance through cosensitization with different interfacial adsorption configurations on defective TiO2(101) surfaces.
