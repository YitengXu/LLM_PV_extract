    , Accepted 4th December 2014First published on 4th December 2014AbstractTwo diacetylide-triphenylamine hole-transport materials (HTM) with varying redox potential have been applied in planar junction TiO2–[CH3NH3]PbI3−xClx solar cells leading to high power-conversion efficiencies up to 8.8%. More positive oxidation potential of the HTM gives higher VOC and lower JSC illustrating the role of matching energy levels, however both HTMs gave efficient cells despite a difference of 0.44 V in their redox potentials.
The recent development of lead halide perovskite based solar cells has led to a step change in the efficiencies of solution-processable solar cells culminating recently in certified power-conversion efficiencies reaching the range 16–18%.1 The exceptional performance of these devices has been attributed to key properties of the perovskite layer including excellent electron and exciton mobility and direct band gap of appropriate energy for visible light harvesting.2
To date, Spiro-OMeTAD has been most commonly used as the HTM in the highest efficiency cells, however this material requires an expensive multi-step synthesis and shows hole-transport too low to carry all generated current.3,4 In response, there has been increased recent interest in developing new HTMs aimed at addressing these limitations.3–12 This work has explored alternative HTM structures, in particular based on the triarylamine and carbazole motifs,6–11 leading to impressive power-conversion efficiencies (PCE) reaching around 14%.6 In general however, these studies have paid limited attention to the exact redox properties of the new HTM provided the value lay approximately close to Spiro-OMeTAD, despite the fact that this molecule was designed for OLEDs and employed in solid-state dye-sensitised solar cells (ssDSSC) rather than perovskite cells.
Our recent work has led to a new diacetylide-triphenylamine (DATPA) series of HTMs,13 prepared by a simple synthetic route, which in turn allows much easier tuning of electrochemical and other properties through varying the substituent R groups. These were studied as HTMs in ssDSSC and showed promising properties in comparison with Spiro-OMeTAD, with the key difference being the differing redox potentials. In this work, we now report a new dimethyl amino substituted HTM (Me2N-DATPA) with very low first oxidation potential. We have used this, and our previously-reported (in the context of ssDSSC) MeO-DATPA, to prepare planar-junction TiO2–[CH3NH3]PbI3−xClx solar cells, the first perovskite cells that use the DATPA HTM series. This represents the first study specifically showing the effect of varying redox potential of structurally-similar HTMs on cell performance parameters.
The new Me2N-DATPA molecule (Fig. 1a) was synthesised by a similar route to that we already reported for MeO-DATPA.13 This involved Ullmann coupling to form the triarylamine fragment, followed by Sonogashira coupling to add a trimethylsilyl acetylide fragment and, after deprotection to remove the trimethylsilyl unit, a final oxidative homocoupling to form the central diacetylide unit (see ESI† for full details).

The arrow indicates the first oxidation potential from which EHOMO is derived and (c) molecular orbital distribution for Me2N-DATPA at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory (isodensity = 0.04). Absolute HOMO and LUMO energy values are experimentally obtained (see Table 1). 
Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction (XRD) were obtained by layer addition in EtOAc/DMSO. Me2N-DATPA crystallised in the space group P21/n and showed one molecule in the asymmetric unit (ESI†). The structure is arranged with the central diacetylide moieties approximately parallel between molecules. As expected the geometry around each triphenylamine is approximately planar and viewed along the long molecular axis, the molecules form herringbone arrangements that run in alternating directions. No intermolecular interactions are within van der Waal radii, however the positioning of Me2N- groups on the periphery of the molecule enables N⋯N contacts of 4.722 Å and 5.171 Å that link the molecules in a 2-D sheet (Fig. 2). Since the HOMO extends across the whole molecule including the peripheral nitrogen atoms (Fig. 1c) such contacts can enhance effective hole transport within the material.

To assess the essential energy levels of Me2N-DATPA, electrochemical analysis (cyclic and square-wave voltammetry) were performed to obtain the HOMO energy level. Spectroscopic methods (absorption and emission) were used to determine the gap and thus the LUMO energy level. Full details are given in ESI† and a summary of the resulting data given in Table 1 compared also with Spiro-OMeTAD and MeO-DATPA. Firstly, this confirmed little visible absorption by Me2N-DATPA, in keeping with MeO-DATPA such that neither will significantly compete with the perovskite layer in the solar cell for light harvesting. The three HTMs differ markedly however in first oxidation potential, with that of Me2N-DATPA being 0.44 V less positive than MeO-DATPA and 0.17 V less positive than Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 1b). This makes the new Me2N-DATPA HTM a significantly stronger donor molecule (i.e. stronger hole acceptor) than either of the other two HTMs used to prepare the solar cells.

These observations were generally reinforced by calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory with C-PCM in CH2Cl2, which showed a difference in HOMO energy levels of around 0.3 eV between Me2N- and MeO-DATPA. The delocalisation of the HOMO onto the peripheral substituents (Fig. 1c) explains the large shift in oxidation potential upon changing from MeO- to Me2N-, and also favours the strong interactions between HOMOs of adjacent molecules required for effective hole transport.
To assess the hole-transport properties, a space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was used according to the methodology reported in detail in ESI† (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4).13 This involved a spin-coated layer of the HTM on an ITO/PEDOT-PSS substrate, followed by an evaporated gold counter electrode. Since the ITO and gold work functions are close to the HTM HOMO level, this creates a hole-only device from which the mobility can be determined. This led to a room-temperature value of 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Me2N-DATPA and lower values at reduced temperature, in keeping with a thermally-activated process. In comparison with our previously-reported value of 6.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MeO-DAPTA under the same conditions, the slightly higher mobility for the new HTM may arise from N⋯N interactions involving the peripheral Me2N groups of the former as shown in Fig. 2. Overall however, the two values differ by only a factor of two and it seems likely that the significantly altered redox potential will play a larger role in solar cell performance.

We prepared perovskite solar cells in keeping with previously reported methods and as described in detail in ESI.† DATPA derivatives and Spiro-OMeTAD were doped with protic ionic liquids following the method similar to that previously published15 and as described more in detail in ESI.† All cells were prepared in a single continuous study using identical methods over 20 repeat cells for each HTM, enabling reliable comparison between the DATPA HTMs and Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The latter showed the highest power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.6%, however the corresponding values of 8.8% and 8.0% for MeO- and Me2N-DATPA respectively are remarkably high for the first studies of new HTMs, given that Spiro-OMeTAD has undergone extensive optimisation of the doping and processing procedures over many years.

Although the overall PCEs for the DATPA HTMs are similar, consideration of their VOC and JSC values reveals different origins to their respective performance. The average JSC is increased by 2.5 mA cm−2 in changing from the weaker electron donor MeO-DATPA to the stronger Me2N-DATPA indicating that the ability of the hole to be transferred efficiently to the HTM plays a crucial role in these cells. On the other hand, the HOMO level of Me2N-DATPA is closer to vacuum, expected to lead to a smaller splitting of the quasi Fermi levels upon illumination between the TiO2 and the HTM and this leads to the smaller VOC for the latter.
We have prepared a new hole-transport material with a very strong hole-donor capability, adding to the redox-tunable series of substituted-DATPA HTMs we reported previously in the context of ssDSSC.13 For the first time we have applied two DATPA molecules as the HTMs in perovskite solar cells leading to excellent efficiencies in both cases, despite the large difference in hole-donor strength. Close inspection indicates a trade-off in VOC with JSC as the HTM redox potential is changed, however the differences are perhaps not as great as might be expected; a 0.44 V difference in oxidation potential between the DATPA HTMs leads to only a 0.12 V difference in average VOC of the resulting cells. Likewise a difference in average JSC of only 2.5 mA cm−2 is observed despite the 0.44 V difference in driving force for hole transfer. In contrast with solid or liquid–electrolyte dye-sensitised solar cells, this implies a wide tolerance of perovskite solar cells to function well with HTMs of greatly differing redox potential, suggesting a wider palette of HTMs might be explored for the further development of these devices.
