The 1:1 D/A ratio showed the shortest charge transport time (τd) and the longest charge diffusion length (Ln) according to , leading to the highest device performance among the three ratios.
Introduction
A growing need for cheap and affordable energy with ubiquitous energy resource has drawn attention towards organic solar cells (OSCs). OSCs have attractive attributes such as low-cost, flexibility, light-weight, abundancy, sustainability, environment-friendliness and manufacturing-ease on large area flexible substrates.1–12 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells comprising an interpenetrating network of a photoactive conjugated polymer (an electron donor) and a fullerene derivative (an electron acceptor) provide an efficient interfacial area for exciton dissociation10,13–16 and a bicontinuous pathway for effective charge transport. Photons are absorbed in the conjugated polymer resulting in the generation of excitons that diffuse to the interface between the polymer and the fullerene derivative.17 The generated excitons dissociate at the interface into electrons and holes, in which electrons are accepted by the fullerene derivative. Presently, widely used fullerene derivative electron acceptors are [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM). Electron donor materials are the major contributors to the absorption of polymer:PCBM based solar cells.6 Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most widely used commercially available donor materials in single junction polymer solar cells.18–21 However, P3HT has poor absorption in the longer wavelength regions limiting its full utilization of the solar spectrum.17,20 Since the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs is estimated primarily from the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor, the HOMO energy level of P3HT which is ∼4.9 eV generating a Voc of around 0.6 V hinders higher Voc.7 More importantly, donor–acceptor alternating copolymers have been employed as an approach to modify the bandgaps and HOMO/LUMO energy levels, as well as to increase Voc through lowering the HOMO energy level of conjugated polymers.17
In this work, we report photovoltaic devices and their transient study on a dodecyloxybenzothiadiazole-based copolymer (PBDT-ABT-2) by copolymerizing alternating benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor and dodecyloxy substituted benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (ABT) acceptor units. Previous studies have shown that ABT acceptor units in poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT12) have broader absorption band characteristics and effective electron affinity suitable for efficient photovoltaic device performance.10 A large planar conjugated structure is also associated with BDT donor units.19,20,22 In addition, high solubility of this copolymer was ensured by introducing long and branched alkyl groups, octyl (C8), decyl (C10) and dodecyl (C12), as side chains. Photovoltaic devices with various copolymer:PCBM ratios including 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2 were studied using transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements. From the TPV and TPC measurements, the charge recombination times (τn) were found to be 21.1 μs, 12.6 μs and 10.5 μs, and the charge transport times were 1316 ns, 422 ns and 707 ns for the 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2 D/A ratios, respectively. The 1:1 ratio showed the shortest charge transport time (τd) and the longest charge diffusion length (Ln), leading to the highest device performance.
Experimental section

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route of the compounds and copolymers. All chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources without purification. Solvents for chemical synthesis were purified by distillation. Chemical reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-octyldodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (compound 3) was synthesized by a reported route.23 4,7-Dibromo-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (compound 4) was also prepared by a reported route.24 Compound 4 and 5-tributylstannyl-2,2′-bithiophene were used to prepare compound 5 according to a literature method with some adjustments.24

5,6-Bis(dodecyloxy)-4,7-di(2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (5)
Compound 4 (1.325 g, 2 mmol) and 5-tributylstannyl-2,2′-bithiophene (2.73 g, 6 mmol) were dissolved in toluene (20 mL), and purged under a nitrogen atmosphere for 30 min. Subsequently, Pd(PPh3)4 (230 mg) was added into the flask, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 120 °C for 24 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted by diethyl ether three times. The organic layer was washed with water twice, and then dried by anhydrous MgSO4. After removing the solvent under vacuum, the residue was recrystallized from alcohol to obtain dark red crystals. The yield was 95%.

Compound 6 was prepared by the bromination of compound 5, which was synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction between 2-tributylstannylbithiophene and compound 4. Compound 4 was obtained owing to the commonly used synthetic procedure from a previous work.24 Finally, 1H and 13C NMR were utilized to characterize the chemical structure of compound 6. Specifically, compound 5 (1.2 g, 1.44 mmol) was dissolved in chloroform (50 mL) and acetic acid (50 mL), and then N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (0.534 g, 3 mmol) was added in one portion. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature in the dark for 12 h. The reaction mixture was extracted using diethyl ether three times. The organic layer was washed with water twice, and then dried using anhydrous MgSO4. After removing the solvent under vacuum, the residue was recrystallized from alcohol to obtain dark red crystals, the yield was 98%. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ (ppm) 8.46 (d, 2H), 7.19 (d, 2H), 7.0 (s, 4H), 4.12 (t, 4H), 2.03 (m, 4H), 1.47 (br, 98H), 1.26 (m, 36H), 0.74 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ (ppm) 151.59, 150.64, 139.09, 137.75, 133.54, 131.66, 130.77, 123.72, 117.18, 111.24, 83.43, 74.55, 31.98, 30.47, 29.79, 29.74, 29.66, 29.44, 26.11, 22.75, 14.18.
Synthesis procedure of copolymer PBDT-ABT-2

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route of the polymer PBDT-ABT-2. Using the effective Stille polymerization, the alternating copolymer PBDT-ABT-2 was successfully obtained and characterized using 1H NMR. The alternating copolymer poly2-octyldodecyloxy-benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene-alt-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-4,7-bis(dithiophen-2-yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (PBDT-ABT-2) was prepared by a typical Suzuki polymerization. The detailed polymerization is described below. Compound 3 (0.277 g, 0.25 mmol) and compound 6 (0.248 g, 0.25 mmol) were dissolved in toluene (15 mL), and purged under a nitrogen atmosphere for 30 min. Subsequently, Pd(PPh3)4 (15 mg) was added into the flask, and the reaction mixture was stirred and refluxed for 48 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into methanol. The collected solid was re-dissolved in chloroform and filtered to remove the metal catalyst. Then, the copolymer solution was concentrated and precipitated in a large amount of methanol. The solid was further purified using a Soxhlet extractor for 12 h in order with methanol, acetone as a solvent, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The yield was 72%. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ (ppm) 8.51 (br, 2H), 7.10–6.70 (br, 8H), 4.22 (br, 8H), 1.48–1.10 (br, 98H), 0.91 (br, 18H).
Absorption spectroscopy
The absorption spectra of PBDT-ABT-2 pristine solution, solid film, and PBDT-ABT-2/PCBM solid films were recorded using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. A glass substrate was used as reference for PBDT-ABT-2 pristine solid film whereas the Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS structure was used as reference for PBDT-ABT-2/PCBM films since PBDT-ABT-2/PCBM films were deposited onto the Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS structure.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization
Topography and phase images of PBDT-ABT-2/PCBM films were taken using an Agilent 5500 AFM microscope. A Si tip (Budget Sensors, Tap 300 L, resonant frequency: 300 KHz, force constant: 40 Nm−1) was used for measurements via tapping mode. Software Gwyddion was used to analyse the AFM images.
Electrochemical measurements
The cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were carried out using a VersaSTAT3 electrochemical workstation from Princeton Applied Research. It was equipped with carbon as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and platinum wire as a counter electrode. All the electrodes were kept in anhydrous acetonitrile with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte under a nitrogen atmosphere at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted to determine the HOMO energy level of PBDT-ABT-2 in an electrolyte of 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 in anhydrous acetonitrile. The working electrode was a carbon electrode coated with the polymer film.
Transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent
Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) were studied using a dye laser coupled with a nitrogen laser to generate pulses at specific wavelength which can form a short transient in the device under test. A pump laser pulse from the OBB's Model OL-4300 nitrogen laser (crisp pulse at 337 nm) was illuminated in the device to obtain transient optical excitation. The model 1011 dye laser was used as an excitation source (pulse duration <1 ns and repetition rate ∼4 Hz). The TPC was measured using 20 ohm external series resistance to operate the device in short circuit. Similarly, TPV was measured using an oscilloscope with 1 MΩ internal impedance. While performing the experiment, the wavelength of the pulse was adjusted close to the absorption peak (575 nm) of the donor polymer. An Agilent MSO 07034B mixed oscilloscope (350 GHz, 2 Gsa s−1) was used to record generated transients. Thus the recorded data were fitted with mono-exponential decaying function and carrier lifetime and charge transport time of the device were calculated.
Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
The substrates comprising indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass with a sheet resistance of ∼15 Ω □−1 were sequentially cleaned with detergent, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min each. After drying the cleaned substrate in a N2 gas stream, they were treated with the O2 plasma for 20 minutes. A thin layer (∼30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios™ P VP AI 4083) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm spin speed for 1 min on the cleaned ITO substrates which were then annealed at 145 °C for 10 min. PBDT-ABT-2/PCBM solutions with different weight ratios 10 mg/20 mg (1:2), 10 mg/10 mg (1:1) and 10 mg/5 mg (1:0.5) were prepared in 1 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB). These photoactive blends were deposited through the spin-casting process, inside a N2-filled glove box. The cathode consists of Ca (∼25 nm) and Al (∼100 nm) thermally evaporated under a high vacuum (less than 4 × 10−6 mbar). Fabricated devices were post-annealed at 60 °C for 5 min inside the glove box. A Keithley 2400 source-measure unit was used to characterize the current–voltage behaviour of the devices. AM 1.5G solar spectra were simulated using a xenon lamp, from Newport, using a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) calibrated mono-crystalline silicon diode as a reference cell. The cell area was 0.16 cm2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements under short-circuit conditions were performed through a set of system with a xenon lamp passing through a monochromator (Newport).
Results and discussion
Absorption spectra
The UV-vis absorption spectra of solid film and solution of PBDT-ABT-2 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene is shown in Fig. 1a. The absorption spectra of PBDT-ABT-2 in solid films showed 15–20 nm redshift compared with that of solution, which could be due to stronger interaction between polymer chains on solid films.19PBDT-ABT-2 has peak absorption at ∼575 nm and at ∼563 nm for film and solution respectively. The absorption onset is at ∼695 nm suggesting an optical bandgap of 1.78 eV. Relative to the absorption peak, PBDT-ABT-2 exhibited broad absorption in the absorption range 400–700 nm. The broader absorption is characteristic of an ABT unit. Fig. 1b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDT-ABT-2/PCBM films at different D/A ratios for corresponding device performance. For 1:2, 1:1 & 1:0.5 D/A ratios of PBDT-ABT-2/PCBM, peak absorptions are 0.36, 0.40 and 0.53, respectively, at 575 nm.

Electrochemical measurements
To determine the HOMO energy level of PBDT-ABT-2, electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used. Ferrocene was used as external reference and showed two peaks of 0.54 V and 0.46 V. E1/2(Ferrocene) was calculated to be 0.5 V by finding the midpoint between the two peaks. The HOMO energy level was determined by HOMO = − [Eox − E1/2(Ferrocene) + 4.8] eV, where Eox is the oxidation onset potential versus Ag/AgCl. Eox was estimated from Fig. 2. The LUMO energy level of the film from PBDT-ABT-2 was estimated from the difference between HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgaps (Eg-opt = 1240/λonset) of the polymer films (LUMO = HOMO + Eg-opt) (Table 1).

Photovoltaic properties

Fig. 3 shows the schematic of the normal polymer solar cell structure. ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al is the device structure with ITO as the anode and Al as the cathode. PEDOT:PSS layer acts as the hole transport layer and Ca acts as the electron transport layer. The active layer is a mixture of PBDT-ABT-2 and PCBM.

An optimum phase separation is required to form a bicontinuous and interpenetrating network to ensure a large interfacial area for exciton dissociation and a continuous percolating path for hole and electron transport to the corresponding electrodes.25 This traditional view of an interpenetrating network of pure polymers and fullerenes with discrete interfaces has been re-visited by recent studies on phase purity, interface morphology and ordering of materials at different length scales.26–28 The active layer of polymer/fullerene OPV was found to include hierarchical nanomorphologies. These hierarchical nanomorphologies with optimum crystallinity and intermixing of polymers with fullerenes have shown an improvement in the exciton dissociation and hence the performance. OPV properties also depend on various factors like crystallinity, phase-separated morphology, molecular stacking, the relative miscibility of the components, etc.29 In addition, during fabrication of PSC devices with new polymer donor materials, the D/A ratio is one of the most important parameters to be considered to examine the photovoltaic performance.25
As shown in Fig. 4, among the three different PBDT-ABT-2:PCBM D/A ratios (1:2, 1:1 and 1:0.5), device performance with the 1:1 D/A ratio gave highest power conversion efficiency which could be due to an optimum donor–acceptor ratio. The transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements (to be discussed in a later section) show that the 1:1 D/A ratio exhibited the shortest charge transport time (τd) and longest charge diffusion length (Ln). A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼3% with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 7.63 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V and a fill-factor (FF) of 53.74% was obtained. Maximum EQE of 52% was achieved for the 1:1 D/A ratio that showed Jsc of 7.96 mA cm−2, which is close to Jsc from I–V measurements (Table 2).

In bulk heterojunction solar cells, the arrangement of the donor and acceptor networks has a great impact on charge generation and charge transport. Engineering the photoactive morphology is of great importance for enhancing charge transport and large interfacial areas for exciton dissociation.30,31 In addition, a balanced hole and electron transport is required for the device to produce maximum photocurrent.32,33Fig. 5 shows AFM (1 × 1 μm) topography images of (a) 1:0.5, (c) 1:1, and (e) 1:2 D/A ratios and phase images of (b) 1:0.5, (d) 1:1, and (f) 1:2 D/A ratios. In the AFM topography images, the 1:1 D/A ratio (Fig. 5c) indicates the formation of fibril structures of polymer and PCBM chains that help for better charge transport which also agreed with the shortest charge transport time obtained from transient analysis. Such fibril structures are not found in the 1:0.5 (Fig. 5a) and 1:2 D/A (Fig. 5e) ratio images. Prior work by others reported that fibril structures improved charge transport.18,34

Fig. 6 shows the TPV and TPC curves that can be used to find carrier recombination time (τn) and transport time (τd) for the devices with different D/A ratios. As observed from transient photovoltage curves, carrier recombination time (carrier lifetime) decreased with an increase in acceptor concentration. This is consistent with previous reports by Dennler et al.33 who also found that the lifetime of charge carriers decreased as the acceptor content increased in a conjugated polymer/fullerene bulk-heterojunction solar cells. In our work, the values of τn were found to be 21.1 μs, 12.6 μs and 10.5 μs for the 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2 D/A ratios, respectively. From transient photocurrent curves, τd was minimum about 422 ns for the 1:1 ratio compared with 707 ns and 1316 ns for 1:2 and 1:0.5 D/A ratios respectively (Table 3). As the donor:acceptor ratio increased from 1:0.5 to 1:1, the percolation path along the acceptor phase might have increased and led to a lower electron transport time. However, when it increased from 1:1 to 1:2, the much higher concentration of the acceptor might have isolated the polymer phase resulting in a longer transport time. Devices with higher τn and lower τd are desirable to achieve a higher photocurrent.35,36 Although the 1:1 D/A ratio showed lower τn compared with the 1:0.5 D/A ratio, but the value of τd was lowest among other ratios. There is a trade-off between τn and τd for higher device performance.35,36 The ratio (τn/τd) between the carrier recombination time and the transport time is largest for the 1:1 D/A ratio, showing the longest charge diffusion length according to the equation of  which was commonly used in the photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells,35,37 where Ln is charge diffusion length. As the charge transport time for the 1:1 D/A ratio is lowest with the longest charge diffusion length, it could be the dominating factor for highest device performance despite the lower carrier recombination time as compared to the 1:0.5 D/A ratio.

Conclusion
A new copolymer (PBDT-ABT-2) based on benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene donor and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole acceptor units was prepared. The copolymer exhibited a bandgap of 1.78 eV and a HOMO energy level of −5.17 eV. A solar cell based on this PBDT-ABT-2/PCBM (1:1 D/A ratio) yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼3%, showing potential in photovoltaic applications. Maximum EQE of 52% was achieved which showed Jsc of 7.96 mA cm−2 that was close to Jsc from I–V measurements. Photovoltaic devices with various polymer:PCBM ratios including 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2 were studied by transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements. From the TPV and TPC measurements, the charge recombination times (τn) were found to be 21.1 μs, 12.6 μs and 10.5 μs, and the charge transport times (τd) were 1316 ns, 422 ns and 707 ns for the 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2 D/A ratios, respectively. The 1:1 ratio showed the shortest charge transport time (τd) and the longest charge diffusion length (Ln), leading to the highest device performance.
